https://openalex.org/W44069967,"The distribution of entangled states between distant locations will be essential for the future large-scale realization of quantum communication schemes such as quantum cryptography and quantum teleportation. Because of unavoidable noise in the quantum communication channel, the entanglement between two particles is more and more degraded the further they propagate. Entanglement purification is thus essential to distil highly entangled states from less entangled ones. Existing general purification protocols are based on the quantum controlled-NOT (CNOT) or similar quantum logic operations, which are very difficult to implement experimentally. Present realizations of CNOT gates are much too imperfect to be useful for long-distance quantum communication. Here we present a scheme for the entanglement purification of general mixed entangled states, which achieves 50 per cent of the success probability of schemes based on the CNOT operation, but requires only simple linear optical elements. Because the perfection of such elements is very high, the local operations necessary for purification can be performed with the required precision. Our procedure is within the reach of current technology, and should significantly simplify the implementation of long-distance quantum communication."

https://openalex.org/W1886027281,"The limited ranges of the wild progenitors of many of the primary European domestic species point to their origins further east in Anatolia or the fertile crescent. The wild ox (Bos primigenius), however, ranged widely and it is unknown whether it was domesticated within Europe as one feature of a local contribution to the farming economy. Here we examine mitochondrial DNA control-region sequence variation from 392 extant animals sampled from Europe, Africa and the Near East, and compare this with data from four extinct British wild oxen. The ancient sequences cluster tightly in a phylogenetic analysis and are clearly distinct from modern cattle. Network analysis of modern Bos taurus identifies four star-like clusters of haplotypes, with intra-cluster diversities that approximate to that expected from the time depth of domestic history. Notably, one of these clusters predominates in Europe and is one of three encountered at substantial frequency in the Near East. In contrast, African diversity is almost exclusively composed of a separate haplogroup, which is encountered only rarely elsewhere. These data provide strong support for a derived Near-Eastern origin for European cattle."

https://openalex.org/W1582655487,"Chromophyte algae differ fundamentally from plants in possessing chloroplasts that contain chlorophyll c and that have a more complex bounding-membrane topology. Although chromophytes are known to be evolutionary chimaeras of a red alga and a non-photosynthetic host, which gave rise to their exceptional membrane complexity, their cell biology is poorly understood. Cryptomonads are the only chromophytes that still retain the enslaved red algal nucleus as a minute nucleomorph. Here we report complete sequences for all three nucleomorph chromosomes from the cryptomonad Guillardia theta. This tiny 551-kilobase eukaryotic genome is the most gene-dense known, with only 17 diminutive spliceosomal introns and 44 overlapping genes. Marked evolutionary compaction hundreds of millions of years ago eliminated nearly all the nucleomorph genes for metabolic functions, but left 30 for chloroplast-located proteins. To allow expression of these proteins, nucleomorphs retain hundreds of genetic-housekeeping genes. Nucleomorph DNA replication and periplastid protein synthesis require the import of many nuclear gene products across endoplasmic reticulum and periplastid membranes. The chromosomes have centromeres, but possibly only one loop domain, offering a means for studying eukaryotic chromosome replication, segregation and evolution."

In an effort to identify molecular target(s) of CEP-1347 in the JNK cascade, JNK1 and known upstream regulators of JNK1 were co-expressed in Cos-7 cells to determine whether CEP-1347 could modulate JNK1 activation. CEP-1347 blocked JNK1 activation induced by members of the mixed lineage kinase (MLK) family (MLK3, MLK2, MLK1, dual leucine zipper kinase, and leucine zipper kinase). The response was selective because CEP-1347 did not inhibit JNK1 activation in cells induced by kinases independent of the MLK cascade. CEP-1347 inhibition of recombinant MLK members in vitro was competitive with ATP, resulting in IC50values ranging from 23 to 51 nm, comparable to inhibitory potencies observed in intact cells. In addition, overexpression of MLK3 led to death in Chinese hamster ovary cells, and CEP-1347 blocked this death at doses comparable to those that inhibited MLK3 kinase activity. These results identify MLKs as targets of CEP-1347 in the JNK signaling cascade and demonstrate that CEP-1347 can block MLK-induced cell death.

These kinases are key regulators involved in cellular responses to environmental stress, cytokines, and initiators of cell death (1Cobb M.H. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 479-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar, 2Tibbles L.A. Woodgett J.R. Cell. Mol. Life. Sci. 1999; 55: 1230-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). In particular, the JNKs and a substrate of the JNKs, c-Jun, have been implicated in the progression of neuronal cell death (3Mielke K. Herdegen T. Prog. Neurobiol. 2000; 61: 45-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). In differentiated PC12 cells and primary sympathetic, hippocampal, and cerebellar granule neurons, activation of c-Jun leads to cell death (4Estus S. Zaks W.J. Freeman R.S. Gruda M. Bravo R.

Conversely, a dominant negative mutant of c-Jun can block death induced by trophic factor withdrawal or potassium depolarization. In addition, death of hippocampal neurons induced by kainic acid is prevented in mice lacking the jnk3 gene or in mice expressing mutations in c-Jun at its JNK phosphorylation sites (8Yang D.D.

Genet. 1999; 21: 326-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Agents that can block the JNK signaling cascade may have therapeutic impact in preventing neuronal cell death that has been observed in a variety of neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's, Huntington's, and Alzheimer's (10Michel P.P. Lamberg N. Ruberg M. Clin. Neuropharmacol. 1999; 22: 137-150PubMed Google Scholar, 11Waggie K.S. Kahle P.J. Tolwani R.J. Lab. Anim. Sci. 1999; 49: 358-362PubMed Google Scholar, 12Robertson G.S. Crocker S.J. Nicholson D.W. Schulz J.B. Brain Pathol. 2000; 10: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The JNKs are activated by the dual specificity MAP kinases (MAPKKs) MEK4/MKK4 and MEK7/MKK7 (13Deijard B. Raingeaud J. Barrett T. Wu I.H. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 5259-5262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Upstream of the MAPKKs, there are multiple MAPKK kinase (MAPKKK) families that regulate JNK activity, including the mixed lineage kinase (MLK) and MEKK family, as well as Tpl-2, a member of the Raf family (2Tibbles L.A. Woodgett J.R. Cell. Mol. Life. Sci. 1999; 55: 1230-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Overexpression of constitutively active MEKK1 or MEKK5/ASK1 causes death of sympathetic neurons, whereas inhibition of JNK activation by dominant negative variants can block cell death caused by trophic factor withdrawal (22Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5045) Google Scholar, 23Kanamoto T. Mota M. Takefa K. Rubin L. Miyazono K. Ichijo H. Bazenet C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 196-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Many of the MAPKKKs are regulated by small GTPases via a Cdc42/Rac-interactive binding motif. Similar to overexpression of the MEKKs, expression of constitutively active Cdc42 leads to death of sympathetic neurons and of PC12 cells (24Bazenet C.E. Mota M.A. Rubin L.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3984-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Therefore, kinases and small GTPases located upstream of JNK/c-Jun may be participants in neuronal cell death processes. CEP-1347 (KT7515), a derivative of the natural product K-252a found in broths of Narcodiopsis bacterium,demonstrates neuroprotective properties (25Kaneko M. Saito Y. Saito H. Matsumoto T. Matsuda Y. Vaught J.L. Dionne C.A. Angeles T.S. Glicksman M.A. Neff N.T. Rotella D.P. Kauer J.C. Mallamo J.P. Hudkins R.L. Murakata C. J. Med. Chem. 1997; 40: 1863-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). CEP-1347 promotes survival of a variety of primary neurons in cell culture, including dorsal root, sympathetic and motor neurons, and PC12 cells after either trophic factor withdrawal, DNA damage, or oxidative stress (26Borasio G.D. Horstmann S. Anneser J.M.H. Neff N.T. Glicksman M.A. Neuroreport. 1998; 9: 1435-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 27Maroney A.C. Glicksman M.A. Basma A.N. Walton K.M. Knight E.

Neff N.T. Tolkovsky A.M. Park D.S. Yan C.Y.I. Troy C.M. Greene L.A. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1901-1912PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, CEP-1347 effectively maintains survival of motor neurons in several in vivo models of programmed cell death, such as developmental cell death of postnatal rat motor neurons of the spinal nucleus of the bulbocavernosis or of chick lumbar motor neuronsin ovo and of adult rat hypoglossal neurons subjected to axotomy (29Glicksman M.A. Chiu A.Y. Dionne C.A. Harty M. Kaneko M. Murakata C. Oppenheim R.W. Prevette D. Sengelaub D.R. Vaught J.L. Neff N.T. J. Neurobiol. 1998; 35: 361-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Furthermore, neurons are spared in the presence of CEP-1347 after mice are exposed to toxins such as ibotenic acid or 1-methyl-4-phenyl tetrahydropyridine (30Saporito M.S. Brown E.R. Carswell S. DiCamillo A.M. Miller M.S. Murakata C. Neff N.S. Vaught J.L. Haun F.A. Neuroscience. 1998; 86: 461-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 31Saporito M.S. Brown E.M. Miller M.S. Carswell S. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 288: 421-427PubMed Google Scholar). Investigating the mechanism of action of CEP-1347, it was first discovered that concentrations of CEP-1347 needed to promote survival after trophic withdrawal of differentiated PC12 cells, primary embryonic motor neurons, and sympathetic neurons or after treating mice with 1-methyl-4-phenyl tetrahydropyridine were the same as those needed to inhibit JNK activation, suggesting that these two activities were related (27Maroney A.C. Glicksman M.A. Basma A.N. Walton K.M. Knight E. Murphy C.A. Bartlett B.A. Finn J.P. Angeles T. Matsudam Y. Neff N.T. Dionne C.A. J.

In an effort to elucidate molecular targets of CEP-1347 in the JNK signaling cascade, we demonstrated that CEP-1347 inhibits the MLKs in vitro and in intact cells at concentrations that block MLK3-induced cell death.

The SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cell line was kindly provided by Dr. June Beidler (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Rye, NY). Cos-7, CHO, and SH-SY5Y cells were grown at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 10% CO2:90% air in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2 mm glutamine, 1 mm pyruvate, 50 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and either 10% bovine serum (Cos-7 cells) or 10% fetal bovine serum (SH-SY5Y and CHO cells). All cell lines were detached for passaging by adding 0.25% trypsin. Spodoptera frugiperda cells (Sf21) (34Hink W.F. Nature. 1970; 226: 466-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar) were grown in suspension as previously described (35Meyer S.L. Lang D.M. Forbes M.E. Knight Jr., E. Hirsch J.D. Trusko S.P.

Expressions were performed with Sf21 cells grown in suspension in serum-free Ex-Cell 420 medium (JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, KS). The cDNAs for MKK4b and MKK7β1 were polymerase chain reaction-amplified from human placenta and brain, respectively, sequence-verified, and inserted into pcDNA3.1. The cDNA encoding a dominant negative (K113A) mutation of MKK4b was generated by polymerase chain reaction-mediated site-directed mutagenesis (36Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R.

Subsequent studies with full-length human MLKs were performed with the following constructs: MLK3, kindly provided by Richard Spritz (43Ezoe K. Lee S.E. Strunk K.M. Spritz R.A. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 935-938PubMed Google Scholar) (University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI), and MLK1 and MLK2 cloned from a human brain cDNA library. The cDNA encoding the kinase-inactive K144R mutation of MLK3 was generated by polymerase chain reaction-mediated site-directed mutagenesis (36Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar). MLK2 and MLK3 were subcloned into pcDNA-3.1, whereas MLK1 was expressed with an NH2-terminal His6-XpressTM epitope fusion partner in the vector pcDNA4/HisMax (Invitrogen). Cos-7 cells were plated to 80% confluency in 60-mm dishes and transfected with 2 μg of test cDNA and 2 μg of hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged JNK1 constructs using LipofectAMINE as recommended by the provider (Life Technologies, Inc.). Two days after transfection, the cells were treated with either 0.0125% Me2SO or 500 nm CEP-1347 for 2 h, rinsed with ice-cold phosphate buffered saline followed by lysis in 0.4 ml of Triton buffer (1% Triton X-100, 50 mm sodium chloride, 10 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 30 μm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm sodium vanadate). Immunoprecipitation and kinase assays were performed as previously described (44Maroney A.C. Lipfert L. Forbes M.E. Glicksman M.A. Neff N.T. Siman R. Dionne C.A. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 540-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Lysates from Cos-7 cells were normalized to protein concentration. The HA-tagged JNK1 was immunoprecipitated with the HA-antibody. Immunoprecipitates were rinsed three times with Triton buffer followed by a final wash in kinase buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 20 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm sodium vanadate). Reactions were incubated in kinase buffer containing 1 μm ATP, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 1 μg/sample of AP-1 substrate for 15 min at 30 °C. The kinase reaction was stopped by addition of sample buffer. Samples were heated to 80 °C for 5 min, and proteins were separated by electrophoresis on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Quantitation of results was performed on a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager (Sunnyvale, CA). A c-Jun luciferase reporter system called PathDetectTM (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was transfected into 150-mm dishes of Cos-7 cells at 40–50% confluency with LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.), as recommended by the manufacturer, along with other cDNA constructs as indicated. The composition of the transfected cDNA consisted of 45% pFA-Luc, 5% pFA-Jun, and 50% pcDNA3 vector containing either MLK3 or pFC-MEKK1 (Stratagene). After 24 h, the cells were detached with trypsin and seeded to a 24-well plate at 2 × 105 cells/well. After the cells were attached, they were washed with serum-free medium containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum and treated with either 0.01% Me2SO (control) or 500 nm CEP-1347 in the same medium overnight. At the end of the incubation, the cells were lysed in buffer provided from the Promega luciferase kit, and luciferase activity was measured as recommended by the manufacturer. Luciferase activity was normalized to protein concentration as measured by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Luciferase activity is expressed as pg of luciferase by comparison to a standard curve constructed with firefly luciferase (Sigma, catalog no. L1759). Portions of the MLK family members were expressed with an NH2-terminal GST fusion partner in insect cells. The region was chosen based on the in vitro kinase activity of the fusion protein, with the NH2 terminus beginning with the last 5 amino acids of the Src homology 3 domain through the end of either the kinase domain (MLK1 and MLK3) or the dual leucine zipper (MLK2). Recombinant viruses were prepared using the Bac-to-Bac (Life Technologies, Inc.) baculovirus system following the manufacturer's protocol. Expressed GST fusion proteins were purified using glutathione affinity chromatography (33Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene. 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar). Kinase assays were performed using the Millipore Multiscreen trichloroacetic acid “in-plate” format as described for protein kinase C (45Pitt A.M. Lee C. J. Biomol. Screening. 1996; 1: 47-51Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Each 50-μl assay mixture contained 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 5 mm EGTA, 15 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, K m of ATP (60 μm for MLK1 or 100 μm for MLK2 and MLK3), 0.25 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 2% Me2SO, and 500 μg/ml myelin basic protein. Reaction was initiated by adding purified recombinant kinases (50, 150, and 100 ng of GST-MLK1KD, GST-MLK2KD/LZ, and GST-MLK3KD, respectively). Samples were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding ice-cold 50% trichloroacetic acid, and the proteins were allowed to precipitate for 30 min at 4 °C. The plates were then washed with ice-cold 25% trichloroacetic acid. Supermix scintillation mixture was added, and the plates were allowed to equilibrate for 1–2 h prior to counting using the Wallac MicroBeta 1450 PLUS scintillation counter. The kinase inhibitory activity of CEP-1347 was evaluated at various concentrations (0.001–10 μm) in order to determine IC50 values. Data were analyzed using the sigmoidal dose-response (variable slope) equation in GraphPad (San Diego, CA) Prism. Double reciprocal plots of CEP-1347 versusATP were generated in the MLK1 reaction under assay conditions described above. Kinetic data were fitted to equations for competitive, noncompetitive, or uncompetitive inhibition using the BASIC versions of the computer programs of Cleland (46Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 103-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1929) Google Scholar). CHO cells were plated at 6.9 × 105cells/100-mm dish. After 24 h, the cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE Plus (Life Technologies, Inc., catalog no. 10964-013), with 25% MLK-1, 5% MLK-2, or 4% MLK-3, where the remainder of total cDNA was composed of dominant negative (dn) MKK4 cDNA substrate. The ratio of MLKs to dnMKK4 was predetermined to be in the linear range with respect to MLK expression and phosphorylation of the dnMKK4 substrate. Four h after the transfection, complete growth medium was added. On the following day, cells were replated at 2 × 104cells/well in 96-well plates. The next day cells were treated with CEP-1347 for 1 h, washed in cold PBS, and lysed in Triton buffer on ice for 10 min. Lysates were then assayed for phospho-MKK4 activity in a phospho-MKK4 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. FluoroNunc Maxisorp 96-well plates were precoated with 100 μl/well goat anti-mouse IgG at 330 ng/well in 0.1 msodium bicarbonate. After a 1-h incubation at 37 °C, the wells were washed five times with TTBS (0.05% Tween in Tris-buffered saline). Each well was coated with MKK4 monoclonal capture antibody at 100 ng/well in Superblock for 1 h at 37 °C. Wells were washed again five times with TTBS and blocked with Superblock for another 1 h, followed by repeated washing with TTBS. Lysate samples, normalized to protein, were diluted 50% in Superblock, added to the wells, and then incubated overnight at 4 °C. Further washing as described above was followed by incubation with the phospho-MKK4 antibody at a 1:500 dilution in Superblock for 1 h at 37 °C. After repeated washing (five times), wells were treated with goat anti-rabbit alkaline phosphatase at 1:2000 in 2% bovine serum albumin/TBS for 1 h at 37 °C. This incubation was followed by three washes with TTBS and three washes with TBS. 4-Methyl-umbelliferyl phosphate substrate (0.02 mg/ml) was dispensed in diethanolamine/MgCl2 buffer (1m diethanolamine, pH 9.6, 1 mmMgCl2) and allowed to incubate for 20 min at 37 °C. Fluorescence was read on the CytoFluor (PerSeptive Biosystems, Foster City, CA) (excitation filter, 360 nm; emission filter, 460 nm). Each data point represents the average of triplicate samples. Phospho-MKK4 in treated wells was expressed as a percentage of Me2SO control treatment. IC50 values were determined using GraphPad Prism software, with fixed upper and lower limits of 100 and 0%, respectively. CHO cells were plated to 80% confluency in 24-well dishes and transfected with either pCMV-EGFP (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) alone or with pCDNA3.0-MLK3. For each well, 0.5 μg of DNA and 2 μl of Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) were used. CEP-1347 was added at the indicated concentrations immediately following the transfection. Cells were washed, and the medium was changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum 9 h after the transfection in the presence of CEP-1347. Two days later, cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde and stained with Hoechst dye to visualize nuclei. Within an experiment, the nuclei of at least 100 transfected cells (as judged by EGFP fluorescence) were scored for apoptotic appearance (condensed and fragmented chromatin) per well in duplicate for each condition. Data given are the percentage of apoptotic nuclei relative to total number of cells for each condition after subtracting background cell death due to the transfection alone. SH-SY5Y cells were preincubated with either 0.1% Me2SO or 500 nm CEP-1347 for 1 h prior to UV irradiation for 45 s in a UV2400 Stratolinker (Stratagene). The cells were then returned to the incubator for another 3 h followed by lysis in Triton buffer. Lysate from Cos-7 cells overexpressing MLK3 or from SH-SY5Y cells treated with UV irradiation were run on a Nupage 3–8% Tris acetate gel, transferred to Millipore polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and probed with an MLK3 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, catalog no. 536) as previously described (28Maroney A.C. Finn J.P. Bozyczko-Coyne D. O'Kane T. Neff N.T. Tolkovsky A.M. Park D.S. Yan C.Y.I. Troy C.M. Greene L.A. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1901-1912PubMed Google Scholar). For the phospho-JNK immunoblots, lysates were run on a 10% gel and the membranes were probed with a phospho-JNK antibody (New England Biolabs catalog no. 9251). Blots were stripped by washing twice for 30 min at 70 °C in buffer containing 2% SDS, 62.5 mm Tris (pH 7.5), and 100 mm2-mercaptoethanol. The blots were reprobed with JNK antibody from PharMingen. Secondary antibodies conjugated to alkaline phosphatase or horseradish peroxidase were used at a 1:20,000 dilution. Blots were analyzed using ECL reagent or enhanced chemifluorescence reagent as described by the manufacturer (Amersham, Piscataway, NJ). The enhanced chemiflorescense blots were quantified on a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Many proteins leading to JNK activation have been delineated in the JNK cascade through overexpression studies in Cos-7 cells, because these cells are highly amenable to efficient transfection. To define the molecular target(s) of CEP-1347 in the JNK signaling cascade, co-transfection experiments were performed with HA-JNK1 and upstream regulators of the JNK signaling cascade in the presence or absence of CEP-1347. Initially, to define broadly the level at which CEP-1347 acts, Cos-7 cells were co-transfected with HA-JNK1 and activated forms of Cdc42 or Rac (47Teramoto H. Coso O.A. Miyata H. Igishi T. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27225-27228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), to determine whether the site of inhibition was upstream or downstream of these small GTPases. At 48 h after transfection, JNK1 activation was 58- and 24-fold higher in Cos-7 cells co-transfected with HA-JNK1 and activated Rac or Cdc42, respectively, compared with its activation in Cos-7 cells transfected with HA-JNK1 alone (Table I). Addition of CEP-1347 (500 nm) inhibited JNK1 activation induced by activated Rac and Cdc42 by 86 and 95%, respectively (Table I). These data indicated that potential targets of CEP-1347 in the JNK signaling cascade were either the small GTPases directly or proteins downstream of the small GTPases and upstream of HA-JNK1. No specific binding of [3H]CEP-1347 to these small GTPases was detected (data not shown), indicating that the targets of CEP-1347 were downstream of the GTPases Rac and Cdc42.Table IComparison of the effect of CEP-1347 on HA-JNK1 activation induced by upstream regulators of JNK1 activityProteinActivationInhibition in the presence of CEP-1347Fold%RAC1QL5886CDC42QL2495KHS574GCK4100NIK692MEKK1(ΔN)1111MEKK5/ASK11630MLK33498MLK21372MLK13795DLK761LZK580TPL-21230MKK7α170MKK7β14019MKK4β40Cos-7 cells were grown to 80% confluency and transfected with HA-JNK1 alone or with various constructs at a 1:1 ratio as indicated in the left column.

Yeast ORC binds specifically to origins of replication and serves as a platform for the assembly of additional initiation factors, such as Cdc6 and the Mcm proteins. Human homologues of all six ORC subunits have been identified by sequence similarity to their yeast counterparts, but little is known about the biochemical characteristics of human ORC (HsORC). We have extracted HsORC from HeLa cell chromatin and probed its subunit composition using specific antibodies. The endogenous HsORC, identified in these experiments, contained homologues of Orc1-Orc5 but lacked a putative homologue of Orc6. By expressing HsORC subunits in insect cells using the baculovirus system, we were able to identify a complex containing all six subunits. To explore the subunit-subunit interactions that are required for the assembly of HsORC, we carried out extensive co-immunoprecipitation experiments with recombinant ORC subunits expressed in different combinations. These studies revealed the following binary interactions: HsOrc2-HsOrc3, HsOrc2-HsOrc4, HsOrc3-HsOrc4, HsOrc2-HsOrc6, and HsOrc3-HsOrc6. HsOrc5 did not form stable binary complexes with any other HsORC subunit but interacted with sub-complexes containing any two of subunits HsOrc2, HsOrc3, or HsOrc4. Complex formation by HsOrc1 required the presence of HsOrc2, HsOrc3, HsOrc4, and HsOrc5 subunits. These results suggest that the subunits HsOrc2, HsOrc3, and HsOrc4 form a core upon which the ordered assembly of HsOrc5 and HsOrc1 takes place.

Saccharomyces cerevisiae origins of DNA replication are short, ∼100-base pair (bp)1 segments that consist of two essential regions: the A domain, which contains a conserved 11-bp consensus sequence (ACS) that is required for origin function, and the B domain, which contains several stimulatory elements (6Campbell J.L.

Genetic and biochemical data indicate that specific ORC subunits from the latter organisms, like those of S. cerevisiae, are required for the initiation of chromosomal DNA replication (20Carpenter P.B.

The conservation of ORC as well as other initiation factors strongly suggests that there are common mechanisms for initiating DNA replication shared by all eukaryotes. However, despite this high degree of evolutionary conservation, the identification in other eukaryotes of ORC binding sequences comparable with the S. cerevisiae ACS elements has so far proved elusive. Origins of DNA replication in S. pombe are large, AT-rich elements that lack a common consensus sequence (23Maundrell K. Hutchison A. Shall S.

The binding of S. pombe ORC to origins of DNA replication appears to be mediated in large part by a unique N-terminal domain of SpOrc4 that contains multiple copies of a motif that binds to AT tracts (26Chuang R. Kelly T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2656-2661Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Purified D. melanogaster ORC has been shown to interact with multiple sequences in ACE3, a cis-acting element that is required for the specialized DNA replication process that occurs during chorion gene amplification, but it is not yet clear that this interaction is relevant to initiation of DNA replication at origins of DNA replication in somatic cells (27Austin R.J.

Indeed, Orc6 is the least conserved of all of the ORC subunits.S. cerevisiae Orc6 is very weakly related to S. pombe Orc6 but not to any known metazoan Orc6 (17Moon K.Y. Kong D. Lee J.K. Raychaudhuri S. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12367-12372Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that S. cerevisiae Orc6 is not required either for specific binding of ScORC to the ACS or for formation of multi-subunit complexes containing the ScOrc1-ScOrc5 (35Lee D.G.

Given the possibility of differences in ORC function among eukaryotes it will be important to identify and characterize HsORC. We report here that endogenous HsORC consisting of a complex of five subunits (HsOrc1-HsOrc5) can be extracted from HeLa cell chromatin. We have also expressed the HsORC subunits in insect cells using the baculovirus system and have identified a complex containing all six subunits. Using this system we have probed the protein-protein interactions between the subunits that are necessary for assembly of the complex. Our results suggest that the HsOrc2, HsOr3, and HsOrc4 proteins form the core complex to which HsOrc5 and HsOrc1 bind in an ordered manner. HsOrc6 appears to be the most weakly bound subunit in the complex. The identification of human ORC should facilitate the identification of replication origins in human cells. To generate antibodies, the six HsORC subunits were expressed individually in bacteria as recombinant fusion proteins tagged with either the His6 epitope or the glutathione S-transferase (GST) moiety. For HsORC1, the 1050-bp sequence that encodes the C- terminal 350 amino acids was amplified using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene), oligonucleotides 5′-CGCGGATCCCAAGACATCTACAATTTTGTGGAA-3′ and 5′-CCGGAATTCCTCGTCTTTCAGCGCATACAGCAC-3′ as primers, and the plasmid pGEX-HsORC1 2D.

Oligonucleotides 5′-CGCGGATCCATGGACTGCTGTGTAGATATAAAATCC-3′ and 5′-ATAAGAATGCGGCCGGAAAAATGAGTATTAGTGGAAATTC-3′ were used as primers, and a HeLa MATCHMAKER cDNA library (CLONTECH) was used as template to amplify a 284-bp fragment that encodes the first 96 amino acids of HsORC3. Oligonucleotides 5′-CGCGGATCCTGCCGGCGCCATGGGGTCGGAGCTGATCGGG-3′ and 5′-ATAAGAATGCGGCCGCTCACTCTGCTGTAGCCTTTTGAGC-3′ were used as primers, and a HeLa MATCHMAKER cDNA library was used as the template to amplify a 799-bp fragment that encodes the full-length HsOrc6p. The HsORC3 and HsORC6 PCR products were digested withBamHI/NotI and individually cloned into the corresponding sites in the plasmid pET28a. For HsORC4, a 1290-bp fragment that encodes the full-length protein was amplified using oligonucleotides 5′-CGGGATCCATGAGCAGTCGTAAATCAAAGAGTAAC-3′ and 5′-TCCCCCCGGGTCATAACCAGCTTAGTGAGGATG-3′ as primers and the plasmid pBluescript II SK+-HsORC4 (a kind gift of Dr. A. Dutta, Harvard Medical School) as template. The PCR product was digested withBamHI/SmaI and cloned into theBglII/PvuII sites of the plasmid pRSETb (Invitrogen). An 810-bp fragment that encodes the first 270 amino acids of HsORC5 was amplified using oligonucleotides 5′-CGGGATCCATGCCCCACTTGGAAAACG-3′ and 5′-TCCCCCCGGGTCAGAGATAAACAGTCTGCATAG-3′ as primers and the plasmid pBluescript-HsORC5 (kindly provided by Dr. J. Hurwitz, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center) as template. The PCR product was processed and cloned into the plasmid pRSETb in a similar manner as that used for HsORC4. All HsORC constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Recombinant proteins that contained the His6 epitope tag were expressed in bacteria and purified on a nickel resin column according to instructions provided by the manufacturer (Qiagen, Inc.). Recombinant fusion proteins that were fused with the GST moiety were expressed in bacteria and purified on a glutathione column according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The purified proteins were used as antigens to inject rabbits and obtain antigen-specific polyclonal antisera (Covance Research Products, Denver, PA). For expression of HsORC1 in insect cells, the full-length gene was first amplified by PCR using oligonucleotides 5′-CGGGATCCGCCGGAAGCCATGGCACACTACCC-3′ and 5′-GCTCTAGATTACTCGTCTTTCAGCGCATACAG-3′ as primers and the plasmid pGEX-HsORC1 as template. The PCR product was then digested withBamHI/XbaI and cloned into the corresponding sites in the plasmid pFastBac1 (Life Technologies, Inc.). The baculovirus vector containing HsORC2 was constructed by amplifying the full-length gene by PCR using oligonucleotides 5′-GAAGGCCTGTTGGCAACAATGAGTAAACCA-3′ and 5′-GGGGTACCTCAAGCCTCCTCTTCTTCCTTTTC-3′ as primers and a HeLa MATCHMAKER cDNA library as template. The PCR product was digested withStuI/KpnI and cloned into the corresponding sites in the plasmid pFastBac1. PCR products containing the HsORC3 and -6 were made by using oligonucleotides 5′-CGGGATCCCAGTAAGACCATGGCTACGTCCTC-3′ and 5′-GGGGTACCCTAGCAGCCTCCCCATGTTAGTCT-3′ and oligonucleotides 5′-CGGGATCCTGCCGGCGCCATGGGGTCGGAGCT-3′ and 5′-GGGGTACCTCACTCTGCTGTAGCCTTTTGAGC-3′ as primers, respectively, and a HeLa MATCHMAKER cDNA library as template. The construct containing HsORC4 was made by amplifying the full-length gene by PCR using oligonucleotides 5′-CGGGATCCATTTGTTGAAATGAGCAGTCGTAA-3′ and 5′-GGGGTACCTCATAACCAGCTTAGTGAGGATGT-3′ as primers and the plasmid pBluescript II SK+-HsORC4 as template. The vector encoding the HsORC5 gene was made by amplification of the full-length gene by PCR using oligonucleotides 5′-CGGGATCCGCCTGCCAGAATGCCCCACTTGGA-3′ and 5′-GGGGTACCTCACAAGAAATCATACAAGTATTT-3′ as primers and the plasmid pBluescript-HsORC5 as template. After digestion withBamHI/KpnI, the PCR products containing the HsORC3, HsORC4, HsORC5, and HsORC6 genes were individually cloned into the corresponding sites in the plasmid pFastBac1. The constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. All recombinant viruses were produced and amplified according to the manufacturer's instructions (Bac-to-Bac TMBaculovirus Expression Systems, Life Technologies, Inc.). Spinner cultures of HeLa cells were grown at 37 °C in Spinner minimum Eagle's medium with glutamine (Quality Biological, Inc.) and supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 µg/ml). Nuclei were prepared exactly as described by Challberg and Kelly (38Challberg M.D. Kelly T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 655-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were prepared by first extracting the nuclei with OPB2 buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.01% Tween 20) plus 100 mm NaCl on ice for 1 h. After centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, the resulting pellet was then extracted with OPB2 buffer plus 500 mm NaCl on ice for 1 h. The suspension was centrifuged at 140,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was used in immunoprecipitation experiments. Sf9 insect cells were cultured at 27 °C in Grace's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin (50 units/ml), streptomycin (50 µg/ml). For expression of various HsORC complexes, Sf9 insect cells were grown to ∼7 × 106 cells in 10-cm plastic dishes, co-infected with various combinations of recombinant baculoviruses expressing HsORC subunits, each at a multiplicity of infection of 5, and incubated at 27 °C for 48 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 5 min and then washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline (10 mmNa2HPO4, 1.8 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.3, 140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl). Nuclei were prepared as described by Challberg and Kelly (38Challberg M.D. Kelly T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 655-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and lysed by incubation with ISLB (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.4 m sorbitol, 150 mmpotassium acetate, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mmMgSO4, 1% Triton X-100) on ice for 5 min. The suspension was centrifuged at 21,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the resulting pellet was extracted with OPB2 plus 500 mm NaCl on ice for 1 h. The supernatant collected after centrifugation at 21,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min was used in immunoprecipitation experiments. For immunoprecipitation experiments, anti-HsORC2 and the anti-HsORC3 antibodies were separately cross-linked to rProtein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described in Harlow and Lane (39Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1988: 522-523Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The solution 0.1 mNa3BO3, pH 9.0, was used in all steps instead of 0.2 m Na3BO3, pH 9.0. Cross-linking was achieved with dimethyl suberimidate 2HCl (Pierce) at a final concentration of 20 mm. Immunoprecipitation experiments were performed by incubating either HeLa cell nuclear extract or baculovirus-infected Sf9 insect cell nuclear extract with cross-linked antibody beads for 2–3 h at 4 °C. The suspensions were then washed 3 times with 10× bead volume of OPB2 buffer plus 500 mm NaCl. The immunoprecipitated proteins were released from the beads with 1% SDS and analyzed by 10% SDS/PAGE followed either by transferring separated proteins to nitrocellulose membranes and Western blotting or staining by silver. For Western blotting, the following concentrations of antibodies were used; HsORC1 (1:1000), HsORC2 (1:6000), HsORC3 (1:3000), HsORC4 (1:1000), HsORC5 (1:3000), and HsORC6 (1:3000). Goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Pierce) was used as the secondary antibody at a concentration of 1:6500. A fraction of the baculovirus-infected Sf9 insect cell nuclear extract containing all six of the HsORC components was applied to a Superdex™-200 HR 10/30 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with OPB2 buffer plus 500 mm NaCl. Fractions (500 µl) were collected and analyzed for HsORC subunits by 10% SDS/PAGE followed by transferring to nitrocellulose membranes and Western blotting. To begin biochemical characterization of HsORC, we first raised polyclonal antibodies against recombinant forms of the six subunits that had been individually expressed in bacteria and purified by affinity chromatography. The specificity of these antibody preparations was assessed in several ways. Western blotting experiments demonstrated that each antibody recognized an endogenous HeLa protein with the molecular weight expected for the corresponding HsORC subunit. In addition, antigen competition experiments were performed for five of the six HsORC subunits (HsOrc5 could not be tested in this manner because of insolubility of the antigen). In every case tested, the signal detected by Western blotting could be eliminated by preincubation of the antibodies with an excess of the appropriate antigen but was not affected by preincubation with an excess of control antigen (data not shown). Finally, each antibody specifically recognized the corresponding HsORC subunit when individually expressed in insect cells using the baculovirus system (see below). To examine the localization of HsORC subunits in human cells we carried out subcellular fractionation experiments. HeLa cells were disrupted by Dounce homogenization at low ionic strength, and the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were separated by centrifugation. The nuclear fraction was then extracted sequentially with 100 and 500 mm NaCl to elute proteins bound to chromatin with different affinities. Western blot analysis revealed that the HsOrc2-HsOrc6 subunits were found almost exclusively in the 500 mm NaCl chromatin extract. A significant fraction of HsOrc1 was present in the same fraction, but HsOrc1 was also detected in the cytoplasmic and 100 mm NaCl chromatin extract (data not shown). This result suggests that a portion of cellular HsOrc1 is either not associated with the other HsORC subunits or is more weakly bound. Preliminary experiments established that our polyclonal HsOrc2 antibody could be used to specifically and quantitatively immunoprecipitate the HsOrc2 present in the 500 mmchromatin extract. Fig. 1 shows an experiment in which we probed such immunoprecipitates for the other HsORC subunits. Western blot analysis revealed that HsOrc1-HsOrc5 were co-immunoprecipitated with similar efficiencies by the HsOrc2 antibody (Fig. 1 A). None of the subunits was detected in control experiments with a preimmune antibody. HsOrc6p was not found in the immunoprecipitated fraction, suggesting that it is not part of the endogenous complex or is dissociated by washing the immunoprecipitates in 500 mm NaCl (Fig. 1 A). We also examined the complexity of the immunoprecipitated fraction by SDS/PAGE followed by silver staining. Fig. 1 B shows that the immunoprecipitates obtained with the antibody against HsOrc2 contained five major proteins not present in control immunoprecipitates. The mobilities of these proteins were consistent with the calculated molecular weights of HsOrc1-HsOrc5 proteins and were the same as the corresponding bands observed by Western blotting. As previously observed, HsOrc2 protein appeared as a closely spaced doublet at ∼72 kDa. To a first approximation, the bands corresponding to HsOrc2-HsOrc5 stained with similar intensities, suggesting that they were present in roughly equal amounts. On the other hand, HsOrc1 consistently stained with lower intensity, suggesting that it may not be as abundant as the other HsORC subunits in the 500 mm chromatin extract. In fact, the amount of HsOrc1 protein in the immunoprecipitates varied somewhat from experiment to experiment, suggesting that the reduced level of HsOrc1 may be due in part to uncontrolled losses during fractionation. These conclusions are subject to the caveat that the relative intensity of silver staining is not always a reliable indicator of abundance, so further work will have to be done to establish the stoichiometry of the various subunits. The pattern of bands in the HsORC immunoprecipitate is strikingly similar to that observed for X. laevis ORC (xlORC) immunoprecipitated with antibody against xlORC2 (40Carpenter P.B. Dunphy W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24891-24897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Indeed, the similarity even extends to the fact that xlOrc3p, like HsOrc3, consistently stains more intensely than the other subunits. In the case of xlORC it was demonstrated that xlOrc3 stains aberrantly with silver and is actually equimolar with the other subunits. Thus, our data indicate that HeLa cell chromatin contains tightly bound complexes comprised of HsOrc1-HsOrc5. Our data also suggest that some of these complexes may lack HsOrc1. Consistent with this possibility, we show below that complexes containing either HsOrc1-HsOrc5 or HsOrc2-HsOrc5 are stable. To facilitate the biochemical characterization of HsORC, we cloned cDNAs encoding each of the six HsORC subunits into baculovirus expression vectors and isolated the individual recombinant viruses. Sf9 insect cells were co-infected with all six recombinant baculoviruses, and after 48 h, 500 mm nuclear extracts were prepared by a method similar to that employed to isolate HsORC from HeLa cells (see “Experimental Procedures”). Recombinant HsORC was immunoprecipitated with the antibody against HsOrc2 and analyzed by SDS/PAGE. Examination of the silver-stained gel revealed that all six HsORC proteins were co-immunoprecipitated with HsOrc2 (Fig.2 A). The bands corresponding to HsOrc2, HsOrc3, HsOrc4, and HsOrc5 proteins stained with similar intensity, indicating that they were present in roughly equivalent amounts. The bands corresponding to HsOrc1 and HsOrc6 proteins were less well stained, suggesting the possibility that they might be present in sub-stoichiom"

https://openalex.org/W2068450796,"In this report, we demonstrate an interaction between subtilisin NAT (formerly designated BSP, or nattokinase), a profibrinolytic serine proteinase from Bacillus subtilis, and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1). Subtilisin NAT was purified to homogeneity (molecular mass, 27.7 kDa) from a saline extract of B. subtilis (natto). Subtilisin NAT appeared to cleave active recombinant prokaryotic PAI-1 (rpPAI-1) into low molecular weight fragments. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization in combination with time-of-flight mass spectroscopy and peptide sequence analysis revealed that rpPAI-1 was cleaved at its reactive site (P1-P1′: Arg346-Met347). rpPAI-1 lost its specific activity after subtilisin NAT treatment in a dose-dependent manner (0.02–1.0 nm; half-maximal effect at ∼0.1 nm). Subtilisin NAT dose dependently (0.06–1 nm) enhanced tissue-type plasminogen activator-induced fibrin clot lysis both in the absence of rpPAI-1 (48 ± 1.4% at 1 nm) and especially in the presence of rpPAI-1 (78 ± 2.0% at 1 nm). The enhancement observed in the absence of PAI-1 seems to be induced through direct fibrin dissolution by subtilisin NAT. The stronger enhancement by subtilisin NAT of rpPAI-1-enriched fibrin clot lysis seems to involve the cleavage and inactivation of active rpPAI-1. This mechanism is suggested to be important for subtilisin NAT to potentiate fibrinolysis. In this report, we demonstrate an interaction between subtilisin NAT (formerly designated BSP, or nattokinase), a profibrinolytic serine proteinase from Bacillus subtilis, and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1).

Commun. 1993; 197: 1340-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) (formerly designated BSP, or nattokinase), a serine proteinase from Bacillus subtilis, has been reported to have potent fibrinolytic activity (1Fujita M. Nomura K. Hong K. Ito Y. Asada A. Nishimuro S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 197: 1340-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 2Sumi H. Hamada H. Tsushima H. Mihara H. Muraki H. Experientia. 1987; 43: 1110-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). The enzyme is composed of 275 amino acids with a molecular mass of 27.7 kDa in its mature form (1Fujita M. Nomura K. Hong K. Ito Y. Asada A. Nishimuro S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 197: 1340-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). DNA sequence analysis showed that subtilisin NAT was 99.5 and 99.3% homologous to subtilisins E and Amylosacchariticus, respectively (3Nakamura T. Yamagata Y. Ichishima E. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1992; 56: 1869-1871Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). It is also homologous to other members of the subtilisin family (BPN′ 86% and Carlsberg 72%), and sequences are conserved especially around the three amino acids (serine 221, histidine 64, and aspartic acid 32) essential for the catalytic center of serine proteinases. The mechanism for this enzyme to potentiate fibrinolysis is not fully understood. Subtilisin NAT is reported not to possess plasminogen activator activity but appears to directly digest fibrin by limited proteolysis (4Fujita M. Hong K. Ito Y. Fujii R. Kariya K. Nishimuro S. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 1995; 18: 1387-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). However, this direct cleavage of fibrin does not seem to account for all of the enhancement of the fibrinolytic activity that has been observed without affecting the fibrinolytic cascade. To explore other possible mechanisms, we have looked for interactions between subtilisin NAT and the physiological inhibitors of fibrinolysis, plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1)1 (5Loskutoff D.J. Sawdey M. Mimuro J. Prog. Hemost. Thromb. 1989; 9: 87-115PubMed Google Scholar) and α2-antiplasmin (α2-AP) (6Aoki N. High A.H. Roberts H.R. Molecular Basis of Thrombosis and Hemostasis. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1995: 545-559Google Scholar). These inhibitors are both members of the serine protease inhibitor superfamily (SERPINs). The SERPINs are proteolytically cleaved and inactivated by a variety of proteases including members of the subtilisin family (7Komiyama T. Gron H. Pemberton P.A. Salvesen G.S. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 874-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). PAI-1 is the primary inhibitor of tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) and regulates fibrinolytic activity in the vasculature at the initial step of the fibrinolytic cascade (5Loskutoff D.J. Sawdey M. Mimuro J. Prog. Hemost. Thromb. 1989; 9: 87-115PubMed Google Scholar). Evidence for the significance of PAI-1 in the regulation of fibrinolysis has been documented by both epidemiologic studies and experimental animal models including transgenic (8Erickson L.A. Fici G.J. Lund J.E. Boyle T.P. Polites H.G. Marotti K.R. Nature. 1990; 346: 74-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) and gene knockout animals (9Carmeliet P. Schoonjans L. Kieckens L. Ream B. Degen J. Bronson R. De Vos R. van den Oord J.J. Collen D. Mulligan R.C. Nature. 1994; 368: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar). High PAI-1 activity is directly related to impaired fibrinolysis (10Hamsten A. de Faire U. Walldius G. Dahlen G. Szamosi A. Landou C. Blomback M. Wiman B. Lancet. 1987; 2: 3-9Abstract PubMed Scopus (1424) Google Scholar), and low activity is associated with bleeding disorders (11Schleef R.R. Higgins D.L. Pillemer E. Levitt L.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 1747-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 12Fay W.P. Shapiro A.D. Shih J.L. Schleef R.R. Ginsburg D. N. Engl. J. Med. 1992; 327: 1729-1733Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The fibrinolytic activity determined by the balance between tPA and PAI-1 can be altered by changing the gene expression of either molecule under a variety of physiological or pathological conditions (13Humphries S.E. Panahloo A. Montgomery H.E. Green F. Yudkin J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 457-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Their balance could also be altered as a consequence of the interaction of PAI-1 with serine proteases other than plasminogen activators in plasma (14Urano T. Ihara H. Suzuki Y. Takada Y. Takada A. Semin. Thromb. Hemostasis. 2000; 26: 39-42Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Like other SERPINs, PAI-1 inhibits plasminogen activator activity by forming a stoichiometric complex through its reactive site in the C-terminal region, the so-called strained loop (15Travis J. Salvesen G.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 655-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (1484) Google Scholar, 16Carrell R.W. Evans D.L. Stein P.E. Nature. 1991; 353: 576-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The strained loop of SERPINs is exposed to the outside of the molecule and is very susceptible to proteolytic digestion as shown for both PAI-1 (17Wu K. Urano T. Ihara H. Takada Y. Fujie M. Shikimori M. Hashimoto K. Takada A. Blood. 1995; 86: 1056-1061Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and α1-antitrypsin (18Ottonello L. Dapino P. Scirocco M. Dallegri F. Sacchetti C. Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 24: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) using neutrophil elastase and for other members using snake venom and bacterial metalloproteases (19Kress L.F. Catanese J. Hirayama T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 745: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In the present study we examine the possible interaction between subtilisin NAT and PAI-1 or α2-AP to clarify the mechanism for subtilisin NAT to enhance fibrinolytic activity. We found that subtilisin NAT cleaved PAI-1 at the P1-P1′ peptide bond by limited proteolysis, resulting in the effective enhancement of tPA-induced clot lysis of PAI-1-enriched fibrin. Subtilisin NAT was purified from a saline extract of B. subtilis (natto) as previously reported (1Fujita M. Nomura K. Hong K. Ito Y. Asada A. Nishimuro S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 197: 1340-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) by techniques of ammonium precipitation and column chromatography using butyl-Toyopearl (Tosoh Co., Tokyo, Japan), CM-Toyopearl (Tosoh Co.), and Sephadex G-50 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After the purification to homogeneity, the protein concentration was determined by the BCA protein assay reagent kit from Pierce. The cultivation of bacteria expressing PAI-1 and the purification of active non-glycosylated rpPAI-1 have been previously described (20Lawrence D. Strandberg L. Grundstrom T. Ny T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 523-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 21Urano T. Strandberg L. Johansson L.B. Ny T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 209: 985-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Purified active rpPAI-1 was stored at −80 °C before use. The concentration of active rpPAI-1 was determined by titration with two-chain uPA (20Lawrence D. Strandberg L. Grundstrom T. Ny T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 523-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) of which the active site concentration was prevoiusly determined by titration with 4-methyl-umbelliferyl-p-guanidinobenzoate (22Jameson G.W. Roberts D.V. Adams R.W. Kyle W.S. Elmore D.T. Biochem. J. 1973; 131: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Glu-plasminogen was prepared from freshly frozen plasma by lysine-Sepharose affinity chromatography (23Deutsch D.G. Mertz E.T. Science. 1970; 170: 1095-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (1672) Google Scholar). Human fibrinogen was purchased from Enzyme Research Laboratories, Inc. (South Bend, IN), and trace amounts of contaminated plasminogen and plasmin were removed by passage through lysine-Sepharose. After treatment with 1 mm (final concentration) phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (purchased from Sigma), the material was dialyzed exhaustively against 50 mm Hepes (analytical grade and purchased from Sigma) buffer containing 100 mm NaCl. α2-AP was purchased from Biopool (Umeå, Sweden). Human thrombin was purchased from Welfide Corp. (Osaka, Japan). Single-chain tPA was kindly provided by Dai-ichi Pharmaceutical Co. (Tokyo, Japan). The chromogenic substrate S-2444 (l-pyroglutamyl-glycyl-l-arginine-p-nitroanilide) and human plasmin were purchased from Chromogenix AB (Mölndal, Sweden). rpPAI-1 (1.7 μm) was incubated with subtilisin NAT (0.5 nm) for various intervals (0, 10, 30, and 60 min) at 37 °C, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of the sample buffer for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). The samples were then subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE. The latent form of rpPAI-1 was obtained by the incubation of active rpPAI-1 at 37 °C for 48 h (24Lawrence D.A. Strandberg L. Ericson J. Ny T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20293-20301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and its specific activity was confirmed to be undetectable after the treatment. The latent form of rpPAI-1 was also treated by subtilisin NAT as mentioned above, and the proteolytic action of subtilisin NAT was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The specific activity of rpPAI-1 toward plasminogen activators after interaction with subtilisin NAT was estimated by a two-step assay (25Urano T. Ihara H. Suzuki Y. Nagai N. Takada Y. Takada A. Fibrinolysis Proteolysis. 1999; 13: 264-271Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). rpPAI-1 (10 nm) was incubated with increasing concentrations of subtilisin NAT for 1 h at 37 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 100 mm NaCl and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. After the addition of two-chain urokinase (final concentration, 100 IU/ml, ∼10 nm), the mixture was incubated for another 30 min at 37 °C. S-2444 (final concentration, 1.0 mm) was then added, and its hydrolysis was continuously monitored by absorbance at 405 nm. The PAI-1 activity was inversely proportional to the amount of uPA preserved in the incubation mixture. The amount of S-2444 hydrolyzed by subtilisin NAT was estimated using the above assay conducted in the absence of uPA, and this value was subtracted although it was almost negligible. The rate of the hydrolysis of S-2444 in the presence of rpPAI-1 and absence of subtilisin NAT was considered to represent the rate at full activity of rpPAI-1 (0% inhibition). The rate of the hydrolysis in the absence of rpPAI-1 was considered to represent fully inactivated rpPAI-1 (100% inhibition). SDS-PAGE was performed according to Laemmli (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), and protein bands were stained by Coomassie Brilliant Blue. A broad range molecular weight standard was purchased from Bio-Rad. 96-well microtiter plates were used for the clot lysis assay. 2 μm fibrinogen, 1 μm Glu-plasminogen, 0.2 nm tPA, 4 nm rpPAI-1, and various concentrations of subtilisin NAT (0, 0.016, 0.032, 0.063, 0.13, 0.25, 0.5, and 1 nm) were added to individual wells, and the clot formation was initiated by the addition of 0.2 unit/ml human thrombin. Absorbance at 405 nm in each well was measured every 15 min until the time of complete clot lysis employing an automatic microtiter plate reader (Plate Analyzer ETY-300, TOYO, Tokyo, Japan). To analyze the possible effect of subtilisin NAT on direct fibrin dissolution, the clot lysis time was determined as mentioned above in the absence of tPA. Another set of similar experiments without rpPAI-1 was also conducted employing a much lower ( 1100) concentration of tPA (2 pm) to analyze the effect of subtilisin NAT on fibrin clot lysis in the absence of PAI-1. All of the assays were conducted at 37 °C. α2-AP (2.0 μm) was incubated with subtilisin NAT (0.5 nm) for various intervals (0, 10, 30, and 60 min) at 37 °C, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of the sample buffer for SDS-PAGE. The samples were then subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE. Fibrinogen (2.0 μm) was also treated with subtilisin NAT (0.5 nm) in a similar way, and its cleavage was analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE after reduction. The molecular mass of the intact and the cleaved forms of rpPAI-1 was determined using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) in combination with a time-of-flight (TOF) mass analyzer (AXIMA-CFR, Shimadzu Solutions for Science/Kratos Analytical, Kyoto, Japan) in the Life Science Department, Analytical Instruments Division, of Shimadzu Co. The instrument was externally calibrated using apomyoglobin (horse) and its dimer form. Sinapinic acid in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and acetonitrile (70:30) was used as matrix. A 0.7-μl protein sample (∼1.2 pmol of rpPAI-1) and 0.7 μl of matrix solution were mixed on the sample plate and were subjected to analysis. Automatic amino acid sequence analyses were performed by using an Applied Biosystems protein sequencer (model 476A, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) according to the established principles. For N-terminal sequence analysis, rpPAI-1 (1.8 μm) was incubated with 0.5 nmsubtilisin NAT in a final volume of 100 μl for 24 h at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped, and the sample (∼180 pmol of rpPAI-1) was lyophilized and loaded onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (ProSpin, Applied Biosystems) after reconstitution and desalting. Data were analyzed by the Applied Biosystems model 610A data analysis program. Subtilisin NAT was purified to homogeneity with a molecular mass of ∼28 kDa (Fig.1). Peptide sequence analysis after trypsin digestion revealed that the protein was subtilisin NAT. The specific activity for hydrolysis of S2251 (0.5 mm) was 20.7 mmol/min/mg. In a fibrin plate assay, which was calibrated using human plasmin, the specific activity was 55.8 casein units/mg. After incubation with a catalytic amount of subtilisin NAT (∼0.5 nm), active rpPAI-1 (1.7 μm) was cleaved into smaller fragments in a time-dependent manner (Fig.2 A). The molecular mass of the main fragment was ∼39 kDa, which is similar to the size of the cleaved form of PAI-1 generated by plasminogen activators through cleavage of its reactive site (21Urano T. Strandberg L. Johansson L.B. Ny T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 209: 985-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 27Declerck P.J. De Mol M. Vaughan D.E. Collen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11693-11696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar cleavage was observed even in the presence of vitronectin, a protein cofactor known to maintain PAI-1 activity (data not shown). We also analyzed the interaction between the latent form of rpPAI-1 and subtilisin NAT to see a possible difference in its susceptibility to subtilisin NAT because the latent form of PAI-1 adopts a unique conformation in which its reactive site is buried inside the molecule (28Mottonen J. Strand A. Symersky J. Sweet R.M. Danley D.E. Geoghegan K.F. Gerard R.D. Goldsmith E.J. Nature. 1992; 355: 270-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). The latent form of rpPAI-1 appeared to be more resistant to subtilisin NAT digestion with only a small fraction being cleaved into the expected fragments (Fig. 2 B). Thus, complete insertion of the reactive site loop into the molecule seems to make it resistant to cleavage by subtilisin NAT. Active rpPAI-1 was incubated with different concentrations (0.02–1.0 nm) of subtilisin NAT for 1 h, and the residual PAI-1 activity was estimated by its specific activity toward uPA. rpPAI-1 lost its specific activity after incubation with subtilisin NAT in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.3). Half-maximal inhibition was obtained at ∼0.1 nm subtilisin NAT by a double-reciprocal plot of subtilisin NAT concentration and its inhibitory effect. This inactivation of PAI-1 activity by subtilisin NAT suggests that rpPAI-1 was proteolytically cleaved at a site close to its reactive center. The subtilisin NAT cleavage site in rpPAI-1 was analyzed by automated Edman degradation and MALDI-TOF/MS (Fig. 4) using an unfractionated subtilisin NAT digest of rpPAI-1 (Fig. 5). Automated sequence analysis of the subtilisin NAT digest of rpPAI-1 gave two residues of an approximately 1:0.5 ratio for the first seven steps. One sequence was consistent with the N-terminal sequence of PAI-1 (N-Val-His-His-Pro-Pro-Ser-Tyr; average, 58.8 pmol), and the other was a new sequence consisting of N-Met-Ala-Pro-Glu-Glu-Ile-Ile (average, 26.8 pmol). The latter sequence originates from the C-terminal portion of the intact PAI-1 molecule and corresponds to amino acid residues 347–353. The subtilisin NAT cleavage site in PAI-1 appears to be between the residues Arg346-Met347, which forms its reactive site (P1-P1′).Figure 5SDS-PAGE of subtilisin NAT digest of active rpPAI-1 used for peptide sequence analysis and MALDI-TOF/MS spectrum analysis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) MALDI-TOF/MS analysis gave two high molecular mass peaks of 42679.2 and 38875.1 Da and a low molecular mass peak of 3835.6 Da (Fig. 4). These peaks correspond to intact rpPAI-1 (calculated mass, 42769.3 Da, −90.1 Da), the N-terminal fragment of cleaved rpPAI-1 (1) (calculated mass, 38983.8 Da, −108.7 Da), and the C-terminal fragment of cleaved rpPAI-1 (347) (calculated mass, 3803.6 Da, +32.0 Da), respectively. This was consistent with the results obtained by peptide sequence analysis of the rpPAI-1 digest and confirmed that the cleavage site was the P1-P1′ site. The difference between the measured molecular mass and the theoretical mass (10 to ∼100 Da) was within the accuracy range for this size of protein (>30,000 Da), although a mass accuracy of ±0.05% is normally obtained for peptides with this instrument. Minor peaks of 21393.41 and 19496.71 Da correspond to doubly charged species of 42679.2 and 38875.1 Da, respectively. Another minor peak of 7674.48 Da corresponds to a dimer of the 3835.6-Da peptide and is probably formed as an artifact of the MS analysis. α2-AP, another important inhibitor of fibrinolysis and member of the SERPIN family, did not appear to interact with subtilisin NAT (no complex formation or cleavage products) (Fig. 6 A). The Aα chain of fibrinogen was cleaved, although the Bβ and γ chains were resistant to subtilisin NAT under the conditions employed (Fig.6 B). The fibrin clot lysis time induced by 0.2 nm tPA was 0.40 ± 0.02 h and was prolonged by the addition of 4 nmactive rpPAI-1 to 29.1 ± 2.4 h. Subtilisin NAT dose dependently shortened clot lysis time, reaching 7.6 ± 0.6 h at 1 nm subtilisin NAT (Fig.7 A). To evaluate the direct influence of subtilisin NAT on fibrin dissolution, similar clot lysis assay was conducted in the complete absence of tPA. The dissolution of the fibrin clot, however, was not observed over a period of 40 h even in the presence of the highest concentration of subtilisin NAT (1 nm) (data not shown). We then analyzed the effect of subtilisin NAT on rpPAI-1-depleted fibrin clots, employing a lower concentration of tPA ( 1100, 2 pm) to make the clot lysis time long enough (5.8 ± 0.1 h). The clot lysis was also shortened by subtilisin NAT in a dose-dependent manner (3.0 ± 0.1 h at 1 nm subtilisin NAT), albeit to a lesser extent (Fig. 7 B). This enhancement of clot lysis time in the absence of rpPAI-1 is most likely caused by direct digestion of fibrin as previously reported (1Fujita M. Nomura K. Hong K. Ito Y. Asada A. Nishimuro S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 197: 1340-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 29Fujita M. Ito Y. Hong K. Nishimuro S. Fibrinolysis. 1995; 9: 157-164Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The clot lysis times both in the presence and absence of rpPAI-1 were expressed as a percentage of the time obtained without subtilisin NAT in each assay and were compared (Fig. 7 C). The extent of the enhancement was more dramatic in the presence of rpPAI-1, suggesting that the inactivation of PAI-1 by subtilisin NAT plays a crucial role in the effective lysis of PAI-1-enriched fibrin clots. The subtilisin-like serine protease (subtilase) superfamily is one of two large serine protease superfamilies (the other being the (chymo)trypsin-like serine protease family) (30Siezen R.J. Leunissen J.A. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 501-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). This subtilase superfamily contains large numbers of proteases of extremely widespread occurrence in plants, bacteria, yeast, and eukaryotes. It contains a large group of proprotein convertases, which have attracted a great deal of attention recently (31Nakayama K. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar, 32Seidah N.G. Chretien M. Brain Res. 1999; 848: 45-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar, 33Bergeron F. Leduc R. Day R. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 24: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Both chymotrypsin and subtilisin have well conserved arrangements of catalytic His, Asp, and Ser residues, but they are located in radically different protein scaffolds, β/β for chymotrypsin and α/β for subtilisin (30Siezen R.J. Leunissen J.A. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 501-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). Subtilisin NAT is a member of the subtilisin family, whose members have rather broad substrate specificity due to larger and more hydrophobic S1 and S4 binding sites (34Perona J.J. Craik C.S. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 337-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). Its potential to enhance fibrinolytic activity was first reported by Sumi et al. (2Sumi H. Hamada H. Tsushima H. Mihara H. Muraki H. Experientia. 1987; 43: 1110-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). The analyses of its nucleotide sequence (3Nakamura T. Yamagata Y. Ichishima E. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1992; 56: 1869-1871Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and amino acid sequence (1Fujita M. Nomura K. Hong K. Ito Y. Asada A. Nishimuro S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 197: 1340-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) confirmed that this enzyme belonged to the subtilisin family, showing strong homology with both subtilisin E (from B. subtilis) (35Stahl M.L. Ferrari E. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 158: 411-418Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and subtilisin J (from Bacillus stearothermophilus) (36Kurihara M. Markland F.S. Smith E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 5619-5631Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although subtilisin NAT was shown to enhance fibrinolysis, its precise mechanism is not known. It does not activate plasminogen but is reported to directly digest fibrin especially in its cross-linked form (29Fujita M. Ito Y. Hong K. Nishimuro S. Fibrinolysis. 1995; 9: 157-164Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In the present study we found a second mechanism by which subtilisin NAT enhances fibrinolysis through cleavage and inactivation of PAI-1. Because PAI-1 is the primary inhibitor of fibrinolysis and regulates total fibrinolytic activity by its relative ratio with tPA, its inactivation is directly related to the enhancement of fibrinolysis. Cleavage of PAI-1 at its reactive center loop has been demonstrated for activated coagulation factors (37Berrettini M. Schleef R.R. Espana F. Loskutoff D.J. Griffin J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11738-11743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and neutrophil elastase (17Wu K. Urano T. Ihara H. Takada Y. Fujie M. Shikimori M. Hashimoto K. Takada A. Blood. 1995; 86: 1056-1061Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), both members of the (chymo)trypsin serine protease family. The interaction of SERPINs with other members of the subtilisin family has also been reported. Subtilisins BPN′ (38Abe O. Kuromizu K. J. Biochem. 1989; 105: 66-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and Carlsberg (7Komiyama T. Gron H. Pemberton P.A. Salvesen G.S. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 874-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), which are both homologous to subtilisin NAT, cleave and inactivate α1-antitrypsin. The latter was shown to cleave α1-antitrypsin at two distinct sites within the reactive site loop including its P2 site (7Komiyama T. Gron H. Pemberton P.A. Salvesen G.S. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 874-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Although it does not possess inhibitory activity, ovalbumin, another SERPIN, was also shown to be cleaved by subtilisin Carlsberg (39Huntington J.A. Patston P.A. Gettins P.G. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 613-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This cleavage was not observed when conformationally modified ovalbumin (S-ovalbumin), in which the reactive center loop is fully inserted into β-sheet A, was treated with subtilisin Carlsberg. This is consistent with data in our present study that showed active rpPAI-1 was more susceptible to subtilisin NAT digestion than the latent form whose conformation is known to be similar to that of S-ovalbumin (28Mottonen J. Strand A. Symersky J. Sweet R.M. Danley D.E. Geoghegan K.F. Gerard R.D. Goldsmith E.J. Nature. 1992; 355: 270-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). The reactive center loop of active SERPINs is exposed above the plane of the molecule and is essential for forming a stoichiometric complex with their target serine proteases, providing a “bait” residue (P1 residue) in the strained loop that acts as a pseudo-substrate for the target protease (16Carrell R.W. Evans D.L. Stein P.E. Nature. 1991; 353: 576-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). An interesting feature of PAI-1 is that the active molecule spontaneously converts into a latent molecule (40Levin E.G. Santell L. Blood. 1987; 70: 1090-1098Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), in which the strained loop is fully inserted into the molecule as a central strand (28Mottonen J. Strand A. Symersky J. Sweet R.M. Danley D.E. Geoghegan K.F. Gerard R.D. Goldsmith E.J. Nature. 1992; 355: 270-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar) generating an apparently smaller Stokes' radius (40Levin E.G. Santell L. Blood. 1987; 70: 1090-1098Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The decreased susceptibility of latent rpPAI-1 to subtilisin NAT digestion, therefore, appears to be due to its compact conformation with the reactive site loop inserted into the molecule. In addition to the plasminogen activators, there are a number of serine proteases that can reduce PAI-1 activity through complex formation or proteolytic cleavage. As a result of these interactions the fibrinolytic balance is shifted toward increased tPA activity (14Urano T. Ihara H. Suzuki Y. Takada Y. Takada A. Semin. Thromb. Hemostasis. 2000; 26: 39-42Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Wu K. Urano T. Ihara H. Takada Y. Fujie M. Shikimori M. Hashimoto K. Takada A. Blood. 1995; 86: 1056-1061Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,37Berrettini M. Schleef R.R. Espana F. Loskutoff D.J. Griffin J.H. J. Biol.

Haemostasis. 1998; 80: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This is based on the fact that tPA is a unique enzyme possessing intrinsic specific activity in its single-chain form (42Stack M.S. Madison E.L. Pizzo S.V. High A.H. Roberts H.R. Molecular Basis of Thrombosis and Hemostasis. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1995: 479-494Google Scholar) unlike other members of the (chymo) trypsin serine protease family. The amount of active enzyme activity in this case is simply determined by its relative concentration over its specific inhibitor. Several activated coagulation factors, including factor XIa (37Berrettini M. Schleef R.R. Espana F. Loskutoff D.J. Griffin J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11738-11743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), calcium-bound factor Xa and thrombin (41Urano T. Nagai N. Matsuura M. Ihara H. Takada Y. Takada A. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1998; 80: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and neutrophil elastase (17Wu K. Urano T. Ihara H. Takada Y. Fujie M. Shikimori M. Hashimoto K. Takada A. Blood. 1995; 86: 1056-1061Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), have the ability to interact with PAI-1. The inactivation of PAI-1 by these activated coagulation factors is considered to be one of the mechanisms responsible for the well known phenomenon of coagulation-associated enhancement of fibrinolysis (14Urano T. Ihara H. Suzuki Y. Takada Y. Takada A. Semin. Thromb. Hemostasis. 2000; 26: 39-42Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study subtilisin NAT was also shown to be able to enhance tPA-induced clot lysis of rpPAI-1-enriched fibrin by inactivating PAI-1. Subtilisin NAT also shortened tPA-induced fibrin clot lysis time in the absence of rpPAI-1, although to a lesser extent. The effect was likely caused by direct digestion of fibrin by subtilisin NAT as previously demonstrated both in vitro (29Fujita M. Ito Y. Hong K. Nishimuro S. Fibrinolysis. 1995; 9: 157-164Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and in vivo (4Fujita M. Hong K. Ito Y. Fujii R. Kariya K. Nishimuro S. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 1995; 18: 1387-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the fact that subtilisin NAT shows similar activity both in plasminogen-rich and plasminogen-poor fibrin plates. We also demonstrated subtilisin NAT-induced partial digestion of the Aα chain of the fibrinogen molecule. Although we did not analyze the cleavage site in fibrinogen, lysine is a candidate for the P1 residue of the cleavage site, since P1-lysine is a characteristic of preferable substrate for subtilisin NAT (1Fujita M. Nomura K. Hong K. Ito Y. Asada A. Nishimuro S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 197: 1340-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 2Sumi H. Hamada H. Tsushima H. Mihara H. Muraki H. Experientia. 1987; 43: 1110-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Because similar partial digestion of fibrin by plasmin is known to enhance fibrinolysis by providing a C-terminal lysine in the Aα chain that binds to both plasminogen and tPA (43Suenson E. Bjerrum P. Holm A. Lind B. Meldal M. Selmer J. Petersen L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22228-22237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), this may be another mechanism for subtilisin NAT to enhance fibrinolysis. The fact that subtilisin NAT, like plasmin, is able to directly digest fibrin and the finding that subtilisin NAT preferably hydrolyzes a synthetic substrate for plasmin (H-d-Val-Leu-Lys-p-nitroanilide) (1Fujita M. Nomura K. Hong K. Ito Y. Asada A. Nishimuro S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 197: 1340-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) prompted us to analyze a possible interaction between subtilisin NAT and α2-AP. Subtilisin NAT, however, neither formed a high molecular weight complex with α2-AP nor cleaved it. Therefore, inactivation of α2-AP does not seem to be involved in the enhancement of fibrinolysis by subtilisin NAT. This, in turn, suggests that the cleavage of PAI-1 by subtilisin NAT is a rather specific phenomenon. In the present study we have shown that subtilisin NAT inactivates PAI-1 by limited proteolysis of its reactive site. This mechanism seems to allow this profibrinolytic enzyme to initiate effective lysis of PAI-1-enriched fibrin clots. We thank Michio Fujie and Masako Suzuki for invaluable technical assistance."

NSF and SNAP serve to regulate the functional status of SNAP receptors (SNAREs) that play a major role in the final stage of vesicular transport. It is generally believed that the final event of docking and fusion of vesicles with the target compartment is mediated by interaction between v-SNAREs on vesicles and t-SNAREs on the target membrane (11Söllner T.

Although GS27/membrin has also been implicated in intra-Golgi transport (25Lowe S.L. Peter F. Subramaniam V.N. Wong S.H. Hong W. Nature. 1997; 389: 881-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), a recent study suggests that syntaxin 5, GS27/membrin, Sec22b, and Bet1 form a SNARE complex that functions in homotypic fusion of ER-derived COPII vesicles (26Xu D. Joglekar A.P. Williams A.L. Hay J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39631-39639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), which may lead to the formation of dynamic large transport intermediates referred to as vesicular-tubular clusters (VTC) or ER-Golgi transport containers/carriers that actually undergo subsequent fusion with the Golgi apparatus (27Stephens D.J. Pepperkok R. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1053-1059PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this possibility, Sec22b and Bet1 are preferentially associated with the intermediate compartment (IC) and behave like constituents of intermediates involved in ER-Golgi transport (16Zhang T. Wong S.H. Tang B.L. Xu Y. Peter F. Hong W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1157-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 19Zhang T. Wong S.H. Tang B.L. Xu Y. Hong W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 435-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Although preferentially associated with the Golgi apparatus, a significant portion (particularly an alternatively spliced longer form) of syntaxin 5 is associated with the IC and may be a component of the transport intermediate (24Rowe T.

Cell. 1997; 8: 1777-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The majority of GS28 is associated with thecis-Golgi and is implicated in both ER-Golgi as well as intra-Golgi transport (20Subramaniam V.N. Peter F. Philip R. Wong S.H. Hong W.

Yeast Ykt6p was originally identified by co-immunoprecipitation with Sed5p and is required for ER-Golgi transport and/or intra-Golgi transport (29Sögaard M. Tani K. Ye R.B. Geromanos S. Tempst P.

A recent study also showed that a significant portion of Ykt6p is associated with the vacuole and is involved in yeast vacuole homotypic fusion, suggesting that it may participate in multiple transport events (31Ungermann C. von Mollard G.F. Jensen O.N. Margolis N. Stevens T.H. Wickner W. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1435-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Mammalian proteins (Ykt6) homologous to Ykt6p have been identified, and the human gene can rescue the lethality of Ykt6p gene deletion in yeast (30McNew J.A. Sögaard M. Lampen N.M. Machida S.

DNA Cell Biol. 1999; 18: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Among the 35 known mammalian SNAREs (33Bock J.B. Matern H.T. Peden A.A. Scheller R.H. Nature. 2001; 409: 839-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar), Ykt6 is the most conserved across different species, suggesting an indispensable function in protein traffic. Another unique feature of Ykt6p and Ykt6 is that they contain COOH-terminal CAAX motif for prenylation. Despite these information, the exact subcellular localization, detailed functional studies, and interacting partners of Ykt6 have not been reported. In this study, we have generated specific antibodies against mammalian Ykt6 to investigate the subcellular localization, interacting partners, and functional involvement of Ykt6 in protein traffic in mammalian cells. Our results suggest that Ykt6 forms a SNARE complex with syntaxin 5, GS28, and Bet1; participates in ER-Golgi transport; and is involved in maintaining the integrity of the Golgi apparatus. For the production of recombinant glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein, the coding region of Ykt6 (residues 1–198) was retrieved by PCR with oligonucleotides 1 (5′-GGC GCT CTA GAC ATG AAG CTG TAC AGC CTT AGT-3′) and 2 (5′-GG CGG CTC GAG TCA CAT GAT TGC ACA GCA AGA-3′) from a mouse kidney cDNA library and its sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The polymerase chain reaction products were digested with XbaI and XhoI. The gel-purified DNA fragment was subcloned into the compatible sites of the bacterial expression vector pGEX-KG (34Guan K. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1635) Google Scholar). The ligated DNA was transformed into DH5α cells, and ampicillin-resistant colonies expressing the GST fusion protein were screened as described (25Lowe S.L. Peter F. Subramaniam V.N. Wong S.H.

Purification of GST-Ykt6 was performed as described previously (35Lowe S.L. Wong S.H. Hong W. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 209-220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For the preparation of polyclonal antibodies against Ykt6, GST-Ykt6 (400 µg) emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant was injected subcutaneously into New Zealand White rabbits. Booster injections containing similar amounts of the antigen emulsified in incomplete Freund's adjuvant were performed after 2, 4, 6, 9, and 12 weeks. Rabbits were bled 10 days after the second and subsequent booster injections. Affinity purification of specific antibodies was performed using the GST-Ykt6 coupled to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose (3 mg/ml Sepharose bead). Affinity purification was carried out as described previously (35Lowe S.L. Wong S.H. Hong W. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 209-220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

Briefly, cells grown on coverslips were washed twice with PBSCM (PBS containing 1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mmMgCl2) and then fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBSCM for 30 min at 4 °C. After sequential washing with PBSCM, 50 mm NH4Cl in PBSCM, and PBSCM, cells were permeabilized with PBSCMS (PBSCM containing 0.1% saponin) for 20 min at room temperature. Incubation with primary antibodies (5–10 µg/ml) in fluorescence dilution buffer (PBSCM with 5% normal goat serum, 5% fetal bovine serum, and 2% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.6) was performed for 1 h at room temperature. After washing three times with PBSCMS, cells were incubated with rhodamine- or FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were then washed five times with PBSCMS, mounted with Vectastain (Vector Laboratories), and then viewed. Confocal microscopy was performed using a Bio-Rad MRC1024 scan head connected to a Carl Zeiss Axiophot microscope equipped with epifluorescence optics. For temperature treatment of cells, NRK cells were incubated at 15 °C for 3 h and then processed for immunofluorescence microscopy. Infection of cells with the ts045 strain of VSV and the subsequent processing for immunofluorescence microscopy were performed as described previously (16Zhang T. Wong S.H. Tang B.L. Xu Y. Peter F.

Cell. 1999; 10: 435-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Ykt6-specific antibodies (100 µg) bound to protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were incubated overnight with 3 mg of Golgi extracts in incubation buffer (20 mm Hepes pH 7.2, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mmEDTA, 0.2 mm ATP) with 1% Triton X-100 at 4 °C. Beads were then washed twice in incubation buffer with 0.5% Triton X-100, and then twice in incubation buffer with 0.2% Triton X-100). Immunoprecipitates were separated on SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblot using antibodies against Ykt6, syntaxin 5, GS28, Bet1, Sec22b, GS27, Vti1-rp2, and syntaxin 6. Total membranes, cytosol, and fractionated membranes were derived from rat liver (37Subramaniam V.N. Krijnse-Locker J. Tang B.L. Ericsson M. Yusoff A.R.B.M. Griffiths G. Hong W. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2405-2414PubMed Google Scholar). Membranes were extracted, and the extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a Hybond-C extra nitrocellulose filter. Immunoblot analysis was performed as described (16Zhang T. Wong S.H. Tang B.L. Xu Y. Peter F. Hong W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1157-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 19Zhang T.

The ER to Golgi transport assay using semi-intact cells was performed as described previously (16Zhang T. Wong S.H. Tang B.L. Xu Y. Peter F. Hong W. J.

Briefly, NRK cells grown on 10-cm Petri dishes as a confluent monolayer were infected with a temperature-sensitive strain of the vesicular stomatitis virus, VSVts045, at 32 °C for 3 h. The cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine (100 µCi/ml) at the restrictive temperature (40 °C) for 10 min and perforated on ice by hypotonic swelling and scraping. These semi-intact cells were then incubated in a complete assay mixture of 40 µl, containing (in final concentrations) 25 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.2, 90 mm KOAc, 2.5 mm MgOAc, 5 mmEGTA, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm ATP, 5 mm creatine phosphate, 0.2 IU of rabbit muscle creatine phosphokinase, 25 µg of cytosol, and 5 µl (25–30 µg of protein; 1–2 × 105) of semi-intact cells. Additional reagents were added as indicated under “Results.” For a standard assay, samples were incubated for 90 min at 32 °C and transport terminated by transferring to ice. The membranes were collected by a brief spin, solubilized in 60 µl of 0.2% SDS, 50 mm sodium citrate (pH 5.5). After boiling for 5 min, the samples were digested overnight at 37 °C in the presence of 2.5 units of endoglycosidase H (endo H) and the reaction was terminated by adding 5× concentrated gel sample buffer. The samples were analyzed on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The transport was quantified using a PhosphorImager system (Molecular Dynamics). For antibody inhibition of transport assay, Ykt6 antibodies were added into the complete assay mixture and incubated on ice for 60 min to allow the antibodies to diffuse into the semi-intact cells. In the case of the two-stage assay, after a stage I incubation for 60 min at 32 °C in a complete assay mixture supplemented with 12.5 mm EGTA but without Ca2+, membranes were spun for 20 s at full speed in an Eppendorf table-top centrifuge and subsequently resuspended in fresh assay mixture with Ca2+by pipetting up and down 10 times with a yellow pipette tip. Additional reagents were added as indicated under “Results.” Samples were incubated for 30 min at 32 °C, and transport was terminated. This was performed essentially as described previously (16Zhang T. Wong S.H. Tang B.L. Xu Y. Peter F. Hong W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1157-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 19Zhang T.

Cells were infected with VSV ts045 at 32 °C for 1 h, followed by incubation at 40 °C for 2–3 h. Cells were rapidly transferred to ice and washed immediately with ice-cold washing buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 90 mm KOAC, 2 mm MgOAc). Cells were permeabilized with digitonin (20 µg/ml in the washing buffer) on ice for 5 min. Coverslips were then transferred to 16-mm wells in washing buffer and incubated for 20 min on ice to release the cytosol. Coverslips were incubated in transport mixture supplemented with rat liver cytosol in the presence or absence of indicated antibodies on ice for 1 h, followed by an incubation at 32 °C for 2 h. Transport was terminated by washing with ice-cold washing buffer, and the cells were fixed immediately by 3% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C for 30 min. Microinjection was performed under an inverted Zeiss Axiophot 35 microscope with a heated stage using an Eppendorf micromanipulation system as described (39Xu Y. Wong S.H. Tang B.L. Subramaniam V.N. Zhang T. Hong W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21783-21789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Injected cells were further incubated at 37 °C for 60 min before fixation. Microinjected cells were identified by the detection of microinjected antibodies using anti-rabbit secondary antibodies conjugated with FITC. The coding region of mouse Ykt6 predicts that it is very hydrophilic in nature and does not possess a transmembrane-spanning domain. However, Ykt6 contains a carboxyl-terminal CAAX motif, suggesting that this protein may be post-translationally modified by the addition of a 15- or 20-carbon isoprenoid group (30McNew J.A. Sögaard M. Lampen N.M. Machida S. Ye R.R. Lacomis L. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Söllner T.H. J. Biol.

Prenylation of yeast Ykt6 is required for its membrane association, which is critical for its biological function (30McNew J.A. Sögaard M. Lampen N.M. Machida S. Ye R.R. Lacomis L. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Söllner T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17776-17783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). When the total membrane fraction derived from NRK cells was analyzed by immunoblot using Ykt6 antibodies, a major polypeptide of about 26 kDa was detected (Fig.1 A, lane 1). Detection of this polypeptide was abolished by pre-incubating antibodies with recombinant GST-Ykt6 (Fig.1 A, lane 3) but not with GST (Fig.1 A, lane 2). To study the cellular distribution of Ykt6, we separated soluble and membrane fraction from rat liver homogenate. When equal fractions of rat liver cytosol (rlc) and total membranes were analyzed by immunoblot, it was found that ∼70–80% of total Ykt6 exists in the cytosol whereas the remaining 20–30% are membrane-associated (Fig. 1 B). The detection of cytosolic pool of Ykt6 is not due to contamination of vesicles containing Ykt6 because, under the same condition, the vesicle-associated membrane protein Bet1 was not found in the cytosol (Fig. 1 C). We further analyzed the distribution of Ykt6 using equal amounts of rat liver cytosol, total membranes (TM), microsomal membranes (MM), and Golgi/IC enriched membranes (GM) (16Zhang T. Wong S.H. Tang B.L. Xu Y. Peter F. Hong W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1157-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 19Zhang T. Wong S.H. Tang B.L. Xu Y. Hong W. Mol. Biol.

Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2405-2414PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis of these fractions with Ykt6 antibodies showed that Ykt6, like Golgi/IC-enriched Bet1, is enriched in the Golgi/IC enriched membrane fraction (Fig. 1 C). Unlike Bet1, which is exclusively membrane-associated, Ykt6 is also detected in the cytosol. To determine the type of association of Ykt6 with the membrane, we extracted the Golgi/IC enriched membrane fraction with PBS, 2 m KCl, 2.5m urea, 0.15 m sodium bicarbonate (pH 11.5), 1% Triton X-100, or 1% Nonidet P-40. It was found that the membrane pool of Ykt6 was not solubilized by PBS, 2 m KCl, 2.5m urea, or 0.15 m sodium bicarbonate (pH 11.5) (Fig. 1 D, lanes 1–8) and was only partially solubilized by 1% Triton X-100 or 1% Nonidet P-40 (Fig.1 D, lanes 9–12). This suggests that the membrane pool of Ykt6 behaves as an integral membrane protein. Our results suggest that Ykt6 is enriched in the Golgi membrane, in addition to its presence in the cytosol. To gain understanding about the biochemical and functional aspects of Ykt6, we have investigated its interaction with other SNAREs operating in the early secretory pathway. Golgi extracts were immunoprecipitated with immobilized Ykt6 antibodies, and the immunoprecipitate was analyzed by immunoblot (Fig. 2). As expected, Ykt6 itself was efficiently immunoprecipitated. In addition, significant amounts of syntaxin 5, GS28, and Bet1 were detected. GS28 and syntaxin 5 are two cis-Golgi SNAREs involved in ER-Golgi and intra-Golgi transport events (20Subramaniam V.N.

It also mediates the dissociation of lipid-poor or lipid-free apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) from HDL. Remodeling is enhanced markedly in triglyceride (TG)-enriched HDL (Rye, K.-A., Jauhiainen, M., Barter, P. J., and Ehnholm. C. (1998) J. Lipid. Res. 39, 613–622). This study defines the mechanism of the remodeling of HDL by PLTP and determines why it is enhanced in TG-enriched HDL. Homogeneous populations of spherical reconstituted HDL (rHDL) containing apoA-I and either cholesteryl esters only (CE-rHDL; diameter 9.3 nm) or CE and TG in their core (TG-rHDL; diameter 9.5 nm) were used. After 24 h of incubation with PLTP, all of the TG-rHDL, but only a proportion of the CE-rHDL, were converted into large (11.3-nm diameter) and small (7.7-nm diameter) particles. Only small particles were formed during the first 6 h of incubation of CE-rHDL with PLTP. The large particles and dissociated apoA-I were apparent after 12 h. In the case of TG-rHDL, small particles appeared after 1 h of incubation, while dissociated apoA-I and large particles were apparent at 3 h. The composition of the large particles indicated that they were derived from a fusion product. Spectroscopic studies indicated that the apoA-I in TG-rHDL was less stable than the apoA-I in CE-rHDL. In conclusion, these results show that (i) PLTP mediates rHDL fusion, (ii) the fusion product rearranges by two independent processes into small and large particles, and (iii) the more rapid remodeling of TG-rHDL by PLTP may be due to the destabilization of apoA-I.

Ehnholm C. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 613-622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Evidence of the importance of PLTP in HDL metabolism comes from studies of mice transgenic for human PLTP. These animals have increased levels of pre-β1-migrating HDL, the initial acceptors of cellular cholesterol in the first step of the reverse cholesterol pathway, and are also resistant to intracellular cholesterol accumulation (10Albers J.J. Tu A.Y. Paigen B. Chen H. Cheung M.C. Marcovina S.M. Int. J. Clin. Lab. Res. 1996; 26: 262-267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Jiang X.C. Francone O.L. Bruce C. Milne R. Mar J. Walsh A. Breslow J.L.

Studies of PLTP knockout mice have shown that PLTP is essential for maintaining normal HDL levels in plasma (13Jiang X.C. Bruce C. Mar J. Lin M. Ji Y. Francone O.L. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 907-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been reported recently that PLTP-mediated transfers of phospholipids between HDL and other lipoprotein classes are not interchangeable with the phospholipid transfers that are mediated by cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) (14Kawano K. Qin S.-C. Lin M. Tall A.R. Jiang X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29477-29481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The mechanism of the remodeling of HDL by PLTP is poorly understood. Although there is evidence that particle fusion and the dissociation of lipid-poor or lipid-free apoA-I are involved (7Lusa S. Jauhiainen M. Metso J. Somerharju P. Ehnholm C. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 275-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 8Korhonen A. Jauhiainen M. Ehnholm C. Kovanen P.T. Ala-Korpela M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 910-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), nothing is known about how the interaction of PLTP with HDL is regulated or the events that occur when HDL are remodeled into large and small particles. In addition, the reasons why remodeling is enhanced in TG-enriched HDL are not understood. The present study was undertaken in order to address these issues. The results show that the PLTP-mediated remodeling of reconstituted HDL (rHDL) containing cholesteryl esters as the sole core lipid (CE-rHDL) and rHDL that are enriched with TG (TG-rHDL) involves the formation of a large, unstable fusion product, which either (i) rearranges into small particles in a process that is not accompanied by the dissociation of apoA-I or (ii) loses two molecules of apoA-I to form a more stable, large conversion product. The results also show that these processes occur independently and that the enhanced PLTP-mediated conversion of TG-rHDL into large and small particles may be due to the destabilization of apoA-I. HDL were isolated from pooled, autologously donated samples of human plasma (Gribbles Pathology, Adelaide, South Australia) by ultracentrifugation in the 1.07 <d < 1.21 g/ml density range (15Rye K.-A. Garrety K.H. Barter P.J. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 215-224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The HDL were delipidated by standard techniques (16Osborne Jr., J.C. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128A: 213-222Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The resulting apo-HDL were subjected to anion exchange chromatography on a column of Q Sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) attached to an FPLC system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (17Weisweiler P. Clin. Chem. Acta. 1987; 169: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This gave homogeneous preparations of apoA-I, which appeared as a single band after electrophoresis on a 20% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Phast System; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and staining with Coomassie Blue. Lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase was isolated from samples of pooled, human plasma as described (18Mahadevan V. Soloff L.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 752: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 19Rajaram O.V. Barter P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 835: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Activity was assessed using 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine (POPC)/unesterified cholesterol (UC)/apoA-I discoidal rHDL labeled with [1α,2α-3H]cholesterol ([3H]UC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as the substrate (20Piran U. Morin R.J. J. Lipid Res. 1979; 20: 1040-1043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The assay was linear when less than 30% of the [3H]UC was esterified. The preparation used in this study generated 2.36 µmol of CE/ml lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase/h. CETP was prepared as described (21Rye K.-A. Hime N.J. Barter P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 189-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Transfer activity was assessed as the transfer of [3H]CE from [3H]CE-HDL3 to low density lipoproteins (22Burstein M. Scholnick H.R. Morfin R. J. Lipid Res. 1970; 11: 583-595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Tollefson J.H. Lui A. Albers J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: E894-E902PubMed Google Scholar). The assay was linear when less than 30% of the [3H]CE transferred from HDL3 to low density lipoproteins. Activity is expressed in units/ml, with 1 unit being the transfer activity of 1 ml of a preparation of pooled, human lipoprotein-deficient plasma. The CETP used in this study had 22 units of activity/ml. PLTP was isolated from samples of pooled human plasma by ammonium sulfate precipitation, ultracentrifugation, Macroprep Hydrophobic Interaction chromatography (Bio-Rad), DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow chromatography (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and heparin-Sepharose Fast Flow chromatography (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (9Rye K.-A. Jauhiainen M. Barter P.J. Ehnholm C. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 613-622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These procedures were carried out at room temperature on an FPLC system. PLTP activity was determined as the transfer of 1,2-di-[1-14C]palmitoyll-3-phosphatidylcholine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) from 1,2-di-[1-14C]palmitoyll-3-phosphatidylcholine-labeled small unilamellar egg PC vesicles to HDL (24Damen J. Regts J. Scherphof G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 712: 444-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The activities of the PLTP preparations used in this study ranged from 1.7 to 3.1 µmol of phospholipid transferred/ml of PLTP/h. Activities in individual incubations are presented in the figure legends. The PLTP preparations were free of CETP and lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase activities and appeared as single bands after electrophoresis on a 20% SDS Phast gel (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and silver staining. Discoidal rHDL containing POPC, UC, and apoA-I were prepared by the cholate dialysis method (25Matz C.E. Jonas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4535-4540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and converted into spherical CE-rHDL by incubation at 37 °C for 24 h with low density lipoproteins and lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (26Rye K.-A. Garrety K.H. Barter P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1167: 316-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The spherical CE-rHDL were isolated by ultracentrifugation at 4 °C in the 1.07 < d < 1.21 g/ml density range, with two 24-h spins at the lower density and a single 16-h spin at the upper density (15Rye K.-A. Garrety K.H. Barter P.J. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 215-224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 1.07 g/ml spins were carried out at 55,000 rpm using a Beckman Ti 55.2 rotor in a Beckman L8-M ultracentrifuge. The 1.21 g/ml spin was carried out at 100,000 rpm using a Beckman TLA 100.4 rotor in a Beckman TL-100 Tabletop ultracentrifuge. The CE-rHDL were dialyzed extensively against Tris-buffered saline (10 mmTris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) containing 1 mmEDTA-Na2 and 0.01% (w/v) NaN3 (TBS) before use. Spherical CE-rHDL were enriched with TG by incubation at 37 °C for either 2 or 20 min with the phospholipid/triglyceride emulsion, Intralipid (KabiVitrum AB, Stockholm, Sweden) and CETP (9Rye K.-A. Jauhiainen M. Barter P.J. Ehnholm C. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 613-622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under these conditions, 12 and 32%, respectively, of the rHDL CE were replaced by TG. The TG-rHDL were isolated by ultracentrifugation as described for CE-rHDL and dialyzed against TBS before use. All incubations were carried out in stoppered plastic tubes in a shaking water bath maintained at 37 °C. Details of the individual incubations are presented in the figure legends. When the incubations were complete, the rHDL were isolated by ultracentrifugation in the 1.063 < d< 1.25 g/ml density range with a single spin at the upper and lower densities. The spins were conducted at 100,000 rpm for 16 h at 4 °C using a TLA 100.4 rotor in a Beckman TL-100 Tabletop ultracentrifuge. The rHDL were concentrated in a CF25 membrane cone (Amicon®) and then applied to a prepacked HR 10/30 Superose-6 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) attached to an FPLC system. The rHDL were eluted from the column at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. Fractions were collected at 1-min intervals. CE-rHDL and TG-rHDL were either maintained at 4 °C, incubated at 37 °C for 24 h in the absence of PLTP, or incubated at 37 °C for 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 h in the presence of PLTP. Aliquots of the unprocessed incubation mixtures were subjected to nondenaturing 3–40% polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis, transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose membranes, and immunoblotted with polyclonal sheep anti-human apoA-I antiserum (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The transferred bands were detected by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (27Liang H,-Q. Rye K.-A. Barter P.J. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 25: 1187-1199Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). To study phospholipid transfers from vesicles to rHDL, [14C]POPC-labeled small unilamellar POPC vesicles were mixed with unlabeled CE-rHDL or unlabeled TG-rHDL and incubated at 37 °C for 1, 3, 5, 10, and 20 min in the presence of PLTP (24Damen J. Regts J. Scherphof G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 712: 444-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The vesicles were precipitated with a MnCl2/heparin solution (24Damen J. Regts J. Scherphof G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 712: 444-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 28Warnick G.R. Albers J.J. J. Lipid Res. 1978; 19: 65-77Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the [14C]POPC content of the rHDL in the supernatant was determined by liquid scintillation counting (Beckman LS 6000 TA Liquid Scintillation Systems, Beckman Instruments, Inc., Fullerton, CA). Precipitation of the vesicles with MnCl2/heparin was quantitative, while more than 95% of the rHDL remained in solution. To study phospholipid transfers from rHDL to vesicles, [14C]POPC-labeled CE-rHDL and [14C]POPC-labeled TG-rHDL were incubated with unlabeled small unilamellar POPC vesicles and PLTP. The [14C]POPC-labeled CE-rHDL were prepared by incubating unlabeled CE-rHDL (6.6 µmol of PL) and [14C]POPC-labeled small unilamellar POPC vesicles (0.66 µmol of PL) with PLTP at 37 °C for 3 h. The radiolabeled CE-rHDL were isolated by ultracentrifugation and then either incubated at 37 °C for 20 min with Intralipid and TBS, or enriched with TG by incubation at 37 °C for 20 min with Intralipid and CETP. The resulting [14C]POPC-labeled CE-rHDL and [14C]POPC-labeled TG-rHDL were isolated by ultracentrifugation. PLTP-mediated phospholipid transfers from the radiolabeled rHDL to unlabeled, small unilamellar POPC vesicles were determined by incubation at 37 °C for 1, 3, 5, 10, and 20 min (24Damen J. Regts J. Scherphof G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 712: 444-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Transfer rates were calculated as the slope of the initial, linear section of plots of the percentage of phospholipid transferred between the rHDL and vesicles as a function of time. The binding of PLTP to CE-rHDL and TG-rHDL was studied using surface plasmon resonance analysis on a BIAcore 2000 system. Rabbit anti-mouse Fc (RAMFc) was covalently attached to CM5 research grade sensor chips as described (29Curtiss L.K. Bonnet D.J. Rye K.-A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5712-5721Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Purified monoclonal antibodies were injected individually at 10 µl/min and captured at 25 °C by the RAMFc. The human apoA-I-specific antibodies AI-1.2 (120 µg/ml), AI-11 (5 µg/ml), and AI-137.1 (13.5 µg/ml) were used individually to capture CE-rHDL and TG-rHDL. The human PLTP-specific antibody, mAb 66 (100 µg/ml) was used to capture the PLTP. The analyte PLTP or rHDL was exposed to the immobilized rHDL or PLTP, respectively, at 25 °C with a buffer flow rate of 10 µl/min. For the apoA-I-specific mAb studies, a typical experiment consisted of the generation of a single chip of immobilized RAMFc followed sequentially by exposure of each flow cell to the same concentration of antibody and rHDL (25 nm). Then, 40 µl of PLTP analyte (125–1000 nm) was injected, with each flow cell receiving a different analyte concentration. For the PLTP-specific mAb studies, the RAMFc chip was exposed sequentially to 100 µg/ml of mAb 66 and 1 µm PLTP followed by CE-rHDL or TG-rHDL at 100–6000 nm. Data were analyzed with the BIAevaluation version 3.0 software, and the Langmuir model for 1:1 binding was used to calculatek a and k d rate constants. Epitope mapping was performed using a Peptide-Spot filter containing 140 peptides, each 13 amino acid residues long, with 11 amino acid overlaps (Jerini Bio Tools, GmbH, Berlin, Germany). The filter was first soaked in methanol for 10 min at room temperature and further treated with monoclonal antibody mAb 66 as described (30Huuskonen J. Jauhiainen M. Ehnholm C. Olkkonen V.M. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 2021-2030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The bound antibodies were detected by ECL (30Huuskonen J. Jauhiainen M. Ehnholm C. Olkkonen V.M. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 2021-2030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). According to this analysis, mAb 66 reacts with the region of amino acids 225–235 of PLTP, ASTSNLDMDFR. The molecular model of PLTP (31Huuskonen J. Wohlfahrt G. Jauhiainen M. Ehnholm C. Teleman O. Olkkonen V.M. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1123-1130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) predicts that this peptide region, especially the sequence STSN, is in a turn on the surface of PLTP and well exposed for antigenic reactions. 2G. Wohlfahrt, personal communication. Phospholipid acyl chain and head group packing order was determined by labeling rHDL with 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH) and 1-(4-trimethylammoniumphenyl)-6-phenyl-1,3,5-hexatrienep-toluenesulfonate (TMA-DPH) (32Prendergast F.G. Haugland R.P. Callahan P.J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 7333-7338Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 33Lentz B.R. Barenholz Y. Thompson T.E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 4521-4528Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar), respectively. Steady state fluorescence polarization of the DPH- and TMA-DPH-labeled rHDL was measured at 5 °C intervals from 5 to 50 °C using an excitation wavelength of 366 nm. The molar ratio of rHDL phospholipid/probe was 500:1, and the final phospholipid concentration was 0.5 mm. Lipid-water interfacial hydration was assessed by labeling the rHDL with 6-propionyl-2-(dimethylamino)-naphthalene (PRODAN) (34Weber G. Farris F.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 3075-3078Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). Uncorrected 390–600-nm emission spectra of the PRODAN-labeled rHDL were recorded using an excitation wavelength of 366 nm and excitation and emission band passes of 5 and 6 nm, respectively. The molar ratio of rHDL phospholipid/probe was 500:1, and the final phospholipid concentration was 0.5 mm. The ratio of the emission intensities at 440 and 490 nm was measured at 5 °C intervals from 5 to 50 °C. The unfolding of apoA-I in CE-rHDL and TG-rHDL was assessed by incubation with 0–8 m guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) (21Rye K.-A. Hime N.J. Barter P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 189-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 35Pace N.C. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 266-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (2412) Google Scholar). The rHDL were added to aliquots of 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing varying concentrations of GdnHCl. The final apoA-I concentration was 20 µg/ml. Wavelengths of maximum fluorescence were determined from 300–380-nm emission scans using an excitation wavelength of 295 nm. The respective excitation and emission band passes were 10 and 5 nm. Initial readings (t = 0 h) were made at 25 °C, immediately after the rHDL were added to the GdnHCl. Subsequent measurements were made after 2, 5, 8, and 24 h of incubation at 25 °C. Nondenaturing 3–40% polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis was used to quantitate rHDL size (36Rye K.-A. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 335-346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue and scanned with a Sharp JX-610 scanner (Sharp, Japan). Imagemaster software was used to quantitate particle size by reference to high molecular weight standards of known diameter (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Agarose gel electrophoresis was used to determine rHDL surface charge (37Sparks D.L. Phillips M.C. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 123-130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A Cobas Fara centrifugal analyzer (Roche Diagnostics, Zurich, Switzerland) was used for the compositional analyses. ApoA-I concentrations were determined either by the method of Lowry et al. (38Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as a standard, or by an immunoturbidometric assay (39Hopkins G.J. Barter P.J. Metab. Clin. Biol. 1982; 31: 78-81Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Enzymatic kits (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were used to measure phospholipid, UC, and total cholesterol concentrations. CE concentrations were calculated as the difference between the total cholesterol and UC concentrations. TG was quantitated enzymatically (40Bergmeyer H.U. Bergmeyer J. Grassl M. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. VCH Weinheim, Germany1985: 1-160Google Scholar). The number of apoA-I molecules/particle was determined by covalently cross-linking the rHDL with bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (41Staros J.V. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 3950-3955Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). The cross-linked rHDL and a control sample of cross-linked, lipid-free apoA-I were electrophoresed on nondenaturing polyacrylamide gradient gels. The number of apoA-I molecules/particle was determined by reference to the cross linked lipid-free apoA-I. Analysis of variance, two-factor with repeated measures, was used to assess differences between data sets. Significance was determined as p < 0.05. The data analysis package in Microsoft Excel 98 was used for these analyses. Spherical CE-rHDL, prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures,” were enriched with TG by incubation for 20 min with Intralipid and CETP. The respective diameters of the CE-rHDL and TG-rHDL were 9.3 and 9.5 nm, and their PL/UC/CE/TG/apoA-I molar ratios were 95.3/6.8/68.1/1.8/3.0 and 103.2/6.2/54.2/22.9/3.0 (Table I). The small amount of TG in the CE-rHDL probably represents traces of Intralipid co-isolating with the rHDL rather than spontaneous transfer of TG from Intralipid to the rHDL (21Rye K.-A. Hime N.J.

Since cross-linking with bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate showed that the CE-rHDL and TG-rHDL both contained three molecules of apoA-I/particle, the stoichiometries are expressed relative to three molecules of apoA-I. As judged by agarose gel electrophoresis, TG enrichment did not affect rHDL surface charge, with the CE-rHDL and TG-rHDL both having electrophoretic mobilities of −0.49 µm·s−1/V·cm−1.Table IPhysical properties of CE-rHDL and TG-rHDLrHDLStoichiometry PL/UC/CE/TG/apoA-IStokes diameter1-aDetermined by nondenaturing 3–40% polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis.Number of apoA-I molecules/particle1-bDetermined by cross-linking.Electrophoretic mobility1-cDetermined by agarose gel electrophoresis.mol/molnmµm · s−1/V · cm−1CE-rHDL95.3/6.8/68.1/1.8/3.09.33−0.49TG-rHDL103.2/6.2/54.2/22.9/3.09.53−0.49Spherical CE-rHDL (final CE concentration 0.1 mm/liter) were incubated with Intralipid (final TG concentration 4.0 mm/liter) in the absence and presence of CETP (final activity 2.7 units/ml) at 37 °C for 20 min.

The final volume of the incubation mixture was 68.0 ml. When the incubations were complete, the rHDL were isolated by ultracentrifugation. Stoichiometries were determined as the mean of triplicate determinations, which varied by less than 10%. CE-rHDL and TG-rHDL size was not affected by incubation for 24 h in the absence of PLTP (Fig. 1). After 24 h of incubation in the presence of PLTP, ∼76% of the original CE-rHDL were converted into large (11.3-nm) and small (7.7-nm) particles. The remaining CE-rHDL were unchanged in size. When the TG-rHDL were incubated for 24 h with PLTP, they were completely converted into large (11.3-nm) and small (7.7-nm) particles, thus confirming the earlier report that TG-enrichment enhances the remodeling of HDL by PLTP (9Rye K.-A. Jauhiainen M. Barter P.J. Ehnholm C. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 613-622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The large and small conversion products were resolved by gel permeation chromatography (Fig. 2). The lipid and protein constituents in the rHDL that were either maintained at 4 °C or incubated at 37 °C in the absence of PLTP eluted as a single peak between fractions 12 and 27. This reflects the monodispersity of the rHDL preparations. The large particles generated by incubation in the presence of PLTP were enriched in CE, while the small conversion products were enriched in apoA-I. Selected fractions were pooled as indicated (↔) and subjected to nondenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (Fig. 3).Profiles A and B show, respectively, the CE-rHDL and TG-rHDL, that were either maintained at 4 °C or incubated at 37 °C for 24 h in the absence of PLTP.Profiles C and D represent the large (11.3-nm) and small (7.7-nm) conversion products, respectively. The number of apoA-I molecules/particle in the pooled samples was determined by cross-linking (Table II). Whereas the original CE-rHDL and TG-rHDL contained three molecules of apoA-I/particle, the large and small conversion products contained four and two molecules of apoA-I/particle, respectively. The composition of the pooled samples and the recoveries of the individual rHDL constituents are shown in Table II. The large particles contained approximately twice as many phospholipid and core lipid molecules as the original rHDL, indicating that they are derived from a fusion product. Following incubation with PLTP, the recovery of rHDL core lipids exceeded that of the surface constituents. This indicates that phospholipids and UC as well as apoA-I dissociated from the CE-rHDL and TG-rHDL during the incubation.Figure 3Size distribution of the pooled rHDL fractions.

https://openalex.org/W1986574665,"F1 is an adhesin of Streptococcus pyogenes which binds the N-terminal 70-kDa region of fibronectin with high affinity. The fibronectin binding region of F1 is comprised of a 43-residue upstream domain and a repeat domain comprised of five tandem 37-residue sequences. We investigated the effects of these domains on the assembly of fibronectin matrix by human dermal fibroblasts, MG63 osteosarcoma cells, or fibroblasts derived from fibronectin-null stem cells. Subequimolar or equimolar concentrations of recombinant proteins containing both the upstream and repeat domains or just the repeat domain enhanced binding of fibronectin or its N-terminal 70-kDa fragment to cell layers; higher concentrations of these recombinant proteins inhibited binding. The enhanced binding did not result in greater matrix assembly and was caused by increased ligand binding to substratum. In contrast, recombinant or synthetic protein containing the 43 residues of the upstream domain and the first 6 residues from the repeat domain exhibited monophasic inhibition with an IC50 of ∼10 nm. Truncation of the 49-residue sequence at its N or C terminus caused loss of inhibitory activity. The 49-residue upstream sequence blocked incorporation of both endogenous cellular fibronectin and exogenous plasma fibronectin into extracellular matrix and inhibited binding of 70-kDa fragment to fibronectin-null cells in a fibronectin-free system. Inhibition of matrix assembly by the 49-mer had no effect on cell adhesion to substratum, cell growth, formation of focal contacts, or formation of stress fibers. These results indicate that the 49-residue upstream sequence of F1 binds in an inhibitory mode to N-terminal parts of exogenous and endogenous fibronectin which are critical for fibronectin fibrillogenesis.

Mosher D.F. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 1363-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Fibronectin extracellular matrix is also important for adhesion and invasion of certain pathogenic bacteria. Bacteria express surface molecules known as adhesins ormicrobial surface componentsrecognizing adhesive matrixmolecules(MSCRAMMs),1 which mediate binding to extracellular matrix molecules (2Joh D. Wann E.R. Kreikemeyer B. Speziale P. Hook M. Matrix Biol. 1999; 18: 211-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). A number of adhesins have been identified, cloned, and analyzed for their binding to fibronectin, and some have been determined to be virulence factors and potential targets for the development of vaccines (3Guzmán C.A. Talay S.R. Molinari G. Medina E. Chhatwal G.S. J. Infect. Dis. 1998; 179: 901-906Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Streptococcus pyogenes is an extracellular pathogen responsible for diseases of varying severity, from nonsuppurative infections of the pharynx and skin to necrotizing fasciitis and toxic shock syndrome (4Bisno A.L. Stevens D.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 334: 240-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). S. pyogenes expresses several fibronectin-binding molecules that have been implicated in the invasion of epithelial cells (5Molinari G. Talay S.R. Valentin-Weigand P. Rohde M. Chhatwal G.S. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 1357-1363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Cue D. Dombek P.E. Lam H. Cleary P.P. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 4593-4601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Ozeri V. Rosenshine I. Mosher D.F.

Dis. 1998; 178: 147-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Parasitization of epithelial cells is believed to allow bacteria to escape from immune surveillance or antibiotic treatments and therefore to favor persistent or recurrent infections. F1 of S. pyogenes (9Hanski E. Caparon M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6172-6176Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), also called Sfb1 (10Talay S.R. Valentin-Weigand P. Timmis K.N. Chhatwal G.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 531-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), is a typical adhesin in its organization with its C terminus anchored on the bacterial cell wall, followed outwardly (C to N terminus) by a series of five 37-residue sequences repeated in tandem (RD5) and the so-called upstream nonrepetitive domain (UD) (Fig.1). The binding of F1 to fibronectin has been localized to UD and RD5, but the binding regions do not match the homology units just described (11Sela S. Aviv A. Tovi A. Burstein I. Caparon M.G. Hanski E. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 1049-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 12Ozeri V. Tovi A. Burstein I. Natanson-Yaron S. Caparon M.G. Yamada K.M. Akiyama S.K. Vlodavsky I. Hanski E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 989-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). As depicted in Fig. 1, the first fibronectin binding motif, referred to as the functional upstream domain (FUD), encompasses the 43 residues of UD plus the first 6 residues of the first 37-residue repeat of the RD5 region. The second fibronectin binding motif, referred to as functional repeat domain (FRD), consists of 44 amino acids and includes the C-terminal part of one 37-residue repeat and the N-terminal part of the next; it begins and ends with the MGGQSES sequence in the middle of each repeat. Binding of FRD has been localized to the most N-terminal 27-kDa fragment of fibronectin, whereas binding of the FUD was localized to a larger region of fibronectin that includes the 27-kDa fragment and adjacent gelatin binding domain (12Ozeri V. Tovi A. Burstein I. Natanson-Yaron S. Caparon M.G. Yamada K.M. Akiyama S.K. Vlodavsky I. Hanski E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 989-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The fibronectin-binding adhesin of Staphylococcus aureus also recognizes the N-terminal 27-kDa fragment (13Mosher D.F. Proctor R.A. Science. 1980; 209: 927-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 14Joh D. Speziale P. Gurusiddappa S. Manor J. Hook M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 897-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The mechanism of fibronectin matrix assembly requires that fibronectin bind at or near the cell surface to polymerize into fibrils (1Magnusson M.K. Mosher D.F. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 1363-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 15Schwarzbauer J.E. Sechler J.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 622-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). One region of fibronectin which is critical for assembly lies in the N-terminal 70-kDa catheptic D fragment, which binds reversibly to cells with the same affinity as intact fibronectin (16McKeown-Longo P.J. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 364-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Although the 70-kDa fragment does not become incorporated into insoluble matrix, it competes for the insolubilization of intact fibronectin, a process that takes place subsequent to reversible binding of fibronectin to cells (16McKeown-Longo P.J. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 364-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The binding activity of the 70-kDa fragment is largely in the N-terminal 27-kDa subfragment (16McKeown-Longo P.J. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 364-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 17McDonald J.A. Quade B.J. Broekelmann T.J. LaChance R. Forsman K. Hasegawa E. Akiyama S. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1463-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), and each of the five type I repeats of the 27-kDa fragment is required for strong binding (19Sottile J. Schwarzbauer J. Selegue J. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12840-12843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 70-kDa fragment also binds to cryptic sites elsewhere in fibronectin which are important for assembly (20Chernousov M.A. Fogerty F.J. Koteliansky V.E. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10851-10858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Morla A. Ruoslahti E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 421-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 22Hocking D.C.

Internalization of fibronectin-coated S. pyogenes by cells is mediated by the integrins α5β1 or αvβ3 (7Ozeri V. Rosenshine I. Mosher D.F. Fässler R. Hanski E. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 625-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), cell surface receptors that recognize the cell adhesion sequence RGD in fibronectin. Cell adhesive activity of fibronectin is cryptic in soluble fibronectin (27Ugarova T.P. Zamarron C. Veklich Y. Bowditch R.D. Ginsberg M.H. Weisel J.W. Plow E.F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4457-4466Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 28Grinnell F. Lang B.R. Phan T.V. Exp.

The mechanism by which F1 mediates bacterial invasion of epithelial cells, therefore, is hypothesized to involve binding of F1 to the N-terminal part of fibronectin with consequent exposure of the integrin binding RGD-containing domain of fibronectin. This proposed process is in some ways similar to what is hypothesized (1Magnusson M.K. Mosher D.F. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 1363-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) to occur during fibronectin matrix assembly, i.e. the N-terminal part of fibronectin binds surface sites on attached cells resulting in exposure of integrin binding and self-association sites on fibronectin required for its insolubilization (30Zhong C. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Brown J. Shaub A. Belkin A.M. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 539-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 31Hynes R.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2588-2590Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). We have investigated if the fibronectin binding motifs of F1 influence fibronectin matrix assembly, e.g. increase fibronectin polymerization by exposing cryptic sites involved in self-assembly or decrease polymerization by blocking binding sites for cell surface molecules or for fibronectin itself. We found the effects of F1 motifs to be complex but mostly inhibitory. The 49-residue sequence of FUD, in particular, has potent inhibitory activity, most probably resulting from binding to the N-terminal sites of fibronectin responsible for binding to molecules at cell surfaces. Bovine serum albumin (BSA), fatty acid-free BSA, and monoclonal mouse antibody to human vinculin were from Sigma. Rhodamine-phalloidin and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Monoclonal antibody IST-9, which recognizes the EDa type III module present in cellular but not plasma fibronectin was from Harlan Sera-Lab (Loughborough, U. K.). Polyclonal antibodies to fibronectin were raised in rabbits. Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) was from Avanti Polar Lipids (Birmingham, AL). Soluble rat tail type I collagen was from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Human plasma fibronectin and the 70-kDa fragment were isolated and radiolabeled with 125I as described previously (16McKeown-Longo P.J. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 364-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 32McKeown-Longo P.J. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 466-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Vitronectin was purified from human plasma (33Bittorf S.V. Williams E.C. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24838-24846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The proteins were stored in aliquots at −70 °C. The His-tagged constructs corresponding to various regions of theS. pyogenes adhesin F1 have been described previously (12Ozeri V. Tovi A. Burstein I. Natanson-Yaron S. Caparon M.G. Yamada K.M. Akiyama S.K. Vlodavsky I. Hanski E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 989-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The nomenclature utilized in this paper, depicted in Fig. 1, is as follows. FUD corresponds to the functional upstream domain (clone pUR4) which encompasses the nonrepeated domain and 6 amino acids from the first repeat region. FRD corresponds to the functional repeat domain (clone RD2–8) encompassing the region from the middle of one repeat to the middle of the next, beginning and ending with the sequence MGGQSES. RD5 corresponds to the five repeats in tandem (clone RD217) and thus contains four FRDs.FF1 encompasses the entire functional F1 region (clone UR19) from UD to the end of RD5. Constructs were transfected intoEscherichia coli. Colonies were monitored for protein expression by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis after induction with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. His-tagged proteins were extracted and purified on nickel nitrilotriacetic acid-Sepharose as described by the manufacturer (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). Fusion proteins were analyzed for purity by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of SDS. Concentrations of FRD and RD5 were estimated using the BCA Protein Assay Reagent Kit (Pierce) with soybean trypsin inhibitor as a standard. Concentrations of FUD and FF1 were estimated by absorbance at 280 nm. Estimates of concentration were validated by amino acid analyses (Protein/Nucleic Acid Shared Facility at the Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee). Peptides corresponding to FUD as well as the N- and C-terminal truncations indicated in Fig. 1 were synthesized and purified by high performance liquid chromatography at the Macromolecular Chemistry facility in the Department of Clinical Chemistry, MalmöGeneral Hospital and Lund University, Malmö, Sweden. Concentrations were based on weights of dried peptides. Preparation of FITC-labeled fibronectin or 70-kDa fragment was carried out as described previously (32McKeown-Longo P.J. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 466-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 34Peters D.M. Portz L.M. Fullenwider J. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). FITC-labeled FUD, FRD, RD5, and FF1 were prepared using a similar technique. Human foreskin dermal fibroblasts (AH1F) were a gift from Lynn Allen-Hoffmann (University of Wisconsin-Madison). MG63 human osteosarcoma cells were from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Fibronectin −/− mouse fibroblasts had been derived from the fibronectin −/− embryonic stem cells as described previously (35Saoncella S. Echtermeyer F. Denhez F. Nowlen J.K. Mosher D.F. Robinson S.D. Hynes R.O. Goetinck P.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2805-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Intergen, Purchase, NY). Tissue culture plastic 1.5-cm2wells (24-well plates) were coated with fibronectin, vitronectin, or collagen type I at 3–10 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline overnight at 4 °C. Cells (3 × 105 in 0.5 ml/well) were seeded in DMEM and 0.2% BSA and studied 4–16 h after seeding. Binding of fibronectin to cells was assayed using 2–4 nm125I-labeled fibronectin (1–2 μg/ml) or 3–4 nm125I-labeled 70-kDa fragment (0.2–0.3 μg/ml) in 0.5 ml of DMEM and 0.2% BSA as described previously (36Zhang Q. Checovich W.J. Peters D.M. Albrecht R.M. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1447-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar).125I-Labeled 70-kDa fragment was also used at 50 nm when binding to fibronectin-null cells to compare quantitative binding to the binding of FITC-labeled 70-kDa observed by immunofluorescence. Fusion protein or peptide was added at the concentration indicated in the text. Fatty-acid free BSA was used when 400 nm LPA was included. Monolayers were incubated with the labeling mixture for 60 min followed by three washes with Tris-buffered saline and recovery of bound label by the addition of 1 nNaOH. Unlabeled 715 nm 70-kDa fragment or 1,000 nm fibronectin (molecular weight assumed to be 450,000) was included in some wells to assess nonspecific binding. Specific binding was determined by subtracting the nonspecific binding (always < 40% of specific binding for conditions in which no inhibitor was present) from the total binding. For visualization of bound exogenously added FITC-labeled fibronectin, 1 × 105cells/well in 0.5 ml were plated in wells containing adhesive protein-coated coverslips and incubated in DMEM and 0.2% BSA for 2–18 h, as indicated in the text. Fusion protein or peptide to be tested as potential modifier was added immediately prior to the addition of 40 nm FITC-labeled fibronectin. After being incubated for 60 min at 37 °C, cells were washed twice, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, and washed again. Coverslips were mounted using Vectashield (Vector, Burlingame, CA). Cells were viewed on an Olympus epifluorescence microscope with a microphotography attachment. For visualization of endogenous fibronectin, cells were plated on adhesive protein-coated coverslips in the presence of test agents and incubated for 24 h. After washing and fixation, cellular fibronectin was detected using 10 μg/ml IST-9 followed by incubation with FITC-conjugated or rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. Coverslips were mounted for microscopy as described above. Visualization of FITC-labeled fibronectin or 70-kDa fragment on fibronectin-null cells was carried out as above except for the following modifications. 3 × 105 cells were plated on collagen-coated coverslips for 2–4 h followed by incubation with 20 nm FITC-labeled fibronectin or 50 nm FITC-labeled 70-kDa fragment for 1 h at 37 °C in the presence or absence of various concentrations of FUD or RD5. Coverslips were then treated as above and photographed by fluorescence and phase-contrast microscopy. For visualization of FITC-labeled FUD, FRD, FF1, or RD5 together with previously deposited exogenously added plasma fibronectin, a similar procedure was followed as described above for visualization of FITC-FN. Fibronectin-null fibroblasts were plated and incubated on collagen-coated coverslips for 2–4 h. Plasma fibronectin at 130 nm was added to half of the coverslips and incubated for 16–24 h. Medium was removed, and cells were incubated with 40 nm FITC-labeled FUD or 120 nm FITC-labeled FF1, RD5, or FRD. Coverslips were washed, fixed, and incubated with polyclonal antibody to fibronectin followed by anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to rhodamine. For detection of focal contacts and stress fibers by double fluorescence, 5 × 104 cells were plated on fibronectin-coated coverslips and allowed to adhere and spread for 2 h in the presence or absence of test peptide. Cells were fixed for 10 min with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, washed, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min, washed, and blocked with 5% BSA for 2 h. Coverslips were incubated with rhodamine-phalloidin simultaneously with 20 μg/ml mouse anti-human vinculin IgG for 2 h at room temperature followed by FITC-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG for 1 h. Coverslips were then mounted with Vectashield as described above. Cell adhesion assays were carried out on fibronectin-, vitronectin-, or BSA-coated wells in 96-well plates, essentially as described previously (37Wennerberg K. Lohikangas L. Gullberg D. Pfaff M. Johansson S. Fässler R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 227-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), except that cells were plated in the presence or absence of test peptide. Cell growth analyses for dermal fibroblasts or MG63 cells were performed by plating 5 × 103cells/well in 96-well plates in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum in the presence or absence of 500 nm recombinant FUD or synthetic peptide. Replicate plates were monitored for cell number on days 1, 3, and 5 by metabolic activity as assessed by the MTS assay performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Madison, WI). Relative cell number was determined by comparison with a standard curve obtained with a known number of cells plated 1 h prior to the assay on each day. Coverslip cultures treated in the same way were stained for examination of fibronectin matrix by immunofluorescence at the end of the 5-day assay. Additional experiments were carried out on 24-well plates in which the cells were incubated for 5 days in the presence and absence of synthetic or recombinant FUD, and cell number was measured by trypsin treatment and counting on a hemocytometer. We studied the effects of His-tagged fusion proteins corresponding to FUD, FRD, RD5, and FF1 containing both FUD and RD5 (Fig. 1). To assess possible effects on fibronectin matrix assembly, the four fusion proteins were included at increasing concentrations in culture when plating human dermal fibroblasts on fibronectin-coated coverslips. After overnight incubation, cells were fixed and analyzed by immunofluorescence utilizing IST-9, which recognizes cellular fibronectin. In the presence of 50 nmFUD, fibronectin matrix was largely absent in the monolayer after overnight culture, whereas in the presence of 50 nm FRD or RD5, fibronectin matrix was similar or only slightly inhibited compared with control (Fig. 2). The effect of FF1 was similar to that of RD5 (not shown). To assess quantitatively their effects on matrix assembly, fusion proteins were included in assays measuring amounts of exogenously added125I-labeled fibronectin or 125I-labeled 70-kDa fragment bound to fibroblast monolayers. At concentrations of 100–500 nm, FUD inhibited almost 100% of the binding of 4 nm fibronectin or 70-kDa fragment to cell monolayers (Fig.3, A and B). The IC50 values for inhibition by FUD were ∼10 nm. RD5 and FF1 were also inhibitory in the concentration range of 70–500 nm. RD5 and FF1 were more inhibitory for 70-kDa fragment than for intact fibronectin. At concentrations of 1–5 nm, RD5 or FF1 enhanced binding of fibronectin or 70-kDa fragment. FRD, like FUD, was solely inhibitory but >100-fold less active. These results indicate that constructs with just the FUD sequence or a single FRD sequence inhibit binding, whereas constructs with repeat sequences in tandem stimulate binding of fibronectin or 70-kDa fragment to cell monolayers at concentrations subequimolar to equimolar to the ligand but are inhibitory at higher concentrations. FUD was studied further because of its strong, monophasic capacity to inhibit matrix assembly. FUD, like each of the recombinant fusion proteins, contains a free cysteine residue in the sequence immediately after the N-terminal His tag (12Ozeri V. Tovi A. Burstein I. Natanson-Yaron S. Caparon M.G. Yamada K.M. Akiyama S.K. Vlodavsky I. Hanski E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 989-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and forms dimers as assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the absence of reducing agent (not shown). To test whether the activity of FUD is influenced by the additional sequence, we studied FUD as a synthetic 49-residue peptide and a series of related peptides truncated at the N-terminal or C-terminal ends (Fig. 1). As shown in Fig.4, A and B, the 49-mer blocked binding of 125I-labeled fibronectin or125I-labeled 70-kDa fragment to cell monolayers with an IC50 of ∼10 nm, similar to the IC50 of the FUD fusion protein. The absence of the N-terminal KDQSPLA resulted in the loss of inhibitory activity by at least 100-fold. Peptides lacking N-terminal 20 or 37 residues, resulting in peptides of 29 and 12 amino acids, completely lacked activity. Peptides corresponding to the first 7 (7-mer) and 20 (20-mer) amino acids were also synthesized and tested. The 7-mer did not have inhibitory activity. The inhibitory activity of the 20-mer, like the 42-mer, was at least 100-fold less than activity of the 49-mer (Fig.4 C). Inhibitory activity was not increased when 20-mer and 42-mer were added simultaneously (data not shown). Thus, most or all of the entire sequence and/or length of the 49-mer is required for optimal inhibition of fibronectin or 70-kDa fragment binding to cell monolayers. Similar results were obtained whether cells were plated on fibronectin, vitronectin, or collagen and in the absence or presence of LPA, a stimulator of fibronectin matrix assembly. The peptides were also tested for their ability to affect assembly of endogenous fibronectin, as ascertained by immunofluorescence using antibody IST-9, and exogenous FITC-fibronectin. As shown in Fig.5, 500 nm 49-mer attenuated deposition of both FITC-fibronectin and endogenous fibronectin by cell monolayers. Loss of exogenous or endogenous fibronectin was nearly complete; only short strands of fibronectin remained. The 42-mer (Fig.5) or 29-mer or 12-mer (not shown) did not visibly affect either exogenous or endogenous fibronectin assembly. Unattached cells do not generally deposit a fibronectin matrix, and a lack of a fibronectin matrix adversely affects cell cycle progression of adherent cells such as Chinese hamster ovary, simian virus 2 cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells (38Sechler J.L.

Res. 1998; 82: 548-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We therefore tested the 49-mer for possible effects on cell adhesion and growth. As shown in Fig.6 A, 500 nm 49-mer, a concentration that nearly fully blocks fibronectin matrix assembly, did not affect adhesion to fibronectin or vitronectin. Focal adhesions (determined by staining for vinculin) or stress fibers (determined by staining with rhodamine-phalloidin) were not disrupted by the treatment with 49-mer (Fig. 6 B). To assess possible effects on proliferation, FUD was added at the time of plating of dermal fibroblasts or MG63 cells in medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. As assessed by cytosolic NADPH activity measured with the MTS reagent, there were no significant differences in growth curves over 5 days in the presence or absence of FUD (Fig. 6 C). Similar results were obtained with the 49-mer when cells were suspended by trypsin treatment at various times and counted on a hemocytometer (not shown). To address the possibility that FUD was inactivated or that cells overcome the inhibitory effect of the peptide during prolonged culture, coverslip cultures of dermal fibroblasts or MG63 cells grown for 5 days in 10% fetal calf serum in the presence or absence of FUD were processed"

The NOSs typically show a bidomain structure in which an N-terminal oxygenase domain containing binding motifs for iron protophyrin IX (heme), (6R)-tetrahydrobiopterin (H4B), and Arg is fused to a C-terminal reductase domain that contains binding sites for FMN, FAD, and NADPH. A calmodulin (CaM) binding site is located between the oxygenase and reductase domains.

In nNOS and eNOS, CaM binding requires elevated Ca2+ and is readily reversible, whereas CaM binding to inducible NOS (iNOS) occurs at extremely low Ca2+ concentrations and is essentially irreversible (22Cho H.J.

NOS are only active in dimeric form. It is therefore critical to explore why and how dimerization influences their catalysis. Various aspects of dimerization have mainly been studied in nNOS and iNOS. In order to dimerize, nNOS and iNOS monomers must first incorporate heme, and the dimeric NOS structure is further stabilized by binding H4B and Arg (29Klatt P. Pfeffer S. List B.M. Lehner D.

The dimeric interaction primarily involves the oxygenase domains of two subunits, with the reductase domains interacting loosely as monomeric tails (32Ghosh D.K. Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1444-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The electron transfer pathway between the reductase and oxygenase domains in a dimer has only been established for iNOS (33Siddhanta U. Wu C. Abu-Soud H.M. Zhang J. Ghosh D.K. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol.

Thus, in iNOS heme reduction occurs exclusively “in trans,” and this helps explain why dimerization is required for its activity. However, it is not known if heme reduction occurs through the same path in other NOS isoforms, and it is unclear how CaM binding might control the process. To address these issues, we generated and characterized four nNOS heterodimers composed of a full-length subunit and a nNOSoxy partner subunit. Such heterodimers have a single reductase domain attached to a dimeric oxygenase domain. The heterodimers contained point mutations to inhibit homodimer formation (G671A) or prevent Arg binding (E592A) (Fig. 1). In addition, we utilized a soybean CaM protein and CaM-troponin C chimeras that are known to support different rates of heme reduction in wild type nNOS relative to mammalian CaM (25Gacchui R.

The UV-visible spectra were recorded on a Hitachi U3110 Spectrophotometer in the absence and presence of 10 mm Arg and 20 μmH4B. The ferrous heme-CO-adduct absorbing at 444 nm was used to quantitate heme protein content using an extinction coefficient of 74 mm−1 cm−1(A444–A500). Dimer and monomer content of the mutant full-length nNOS proteins were estimated using an Amersham-Pharmacia Superdex 200HR column equilibrated with 40 mm EPPS, pH 7.6, containing 10% glycerol, 3 mm DTT, and 0.25 mNaCl after overnight incubation of the proteins with and without Arg (10 mm) and H4B (100 μm). Molecular weights of the protein peaks were estimated relative to protein molecular weight standards. Wild type nNOSoxy or nNOSoxyE592A proteins were first incubated at a concentration of 30–40 μm with 3 m urea in 40 mm EPPS, 3 mm DTT, and 10% glycerol for 2.5 h at 15 °C to generate their monomers. The samples were then diluted 10-fold with 40 mm EPPS, 10% glycerol, and 3 mm DTT and incubated at different concentrations (0–1.5 μm) with 0.3 μm of full-length G671A nNOS or full-length G671A/E592A nNOS.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3687-3695Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) with modifications. Protein samples were mixed with 20 μl of sample buffer containing 0.125 m Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 4% (w/v) SDS, 20% (w/v) glycerol, and 0.02% (w/v) bromphenol blue and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in an ice-water bath at a constant current of 16 mA on 1-mm slab gels (7 × 8 cm) using a Mini Protean II apparatus from Bio-Rad. Gels and buffers were equilibrated at 4 °C prior to electrophoresis. In a separate experiment, the same samples were boiled in the additional presence of 10% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol before being subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under similar conditions as described above. Subsequently, gels were stained for protein with Coomassie Blue R-250. The apparent molecular mass of the heterodimer and its component G671A and nNOSoxy subunits were determined using the Bio-Rad prestained SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis standards myosin (subunit mass 197 kDa), β-galactosidase (subunit mass 115 kDa), bovine serum albumin (subunit mass 89 kDa), and ovalbumin (subunit mass 52 kDa). After the incubation to promote dimerization, heterodimer NO synthesis was assayed in 96-microwell plates by diluting each sample to 100 μl with assay buffer such that each well contained a final concentration of 40 mm EPPS, 3 mm DTT, 4 μm FAD, 4 μm FMN, 200 μm H4B, 20 mm Arg, 0.9 mm EDTA, 1.2 mm Ca2+, 0.9 μm CaM, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 18 units/ml catalase, and 10 units/ml superoxide dismutase. NADPH (1 mm) was added to each well to start the reaction. These were then incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, and the reaction was stopped by enzymatic oxidation of NADPH. Griess reagent (0.1 ml) was added to each well, and the absorbance was measured at 550 nm in a microplate reader. Nitrite produced by the heterodimers was quantified using NaNO2 standards. In some cases, the heterodimer NO synthesis was also assayed using the spectrophotometric oxyhemoglobin assay (16Stuehr D.J. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20547-20550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Siddhanta U. Presta A. Fan B. Wolan D. Rosseau D.L. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol.

After the dimerization incubation, sample aliquots were transferred into cuvettes containing 40 mm EPPS (pH 7.6), 0.3 mm DTT, 4 μm FAD, 4 μm FMN, 100 μm H4B, 10 mm Arg, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.8 mm Ca2+, 0.6 mm EDTA, 0.9 μm CaM, 100 units/ml catalase, 10 units/ml superoxide dismutase, 5 μm oxyhemoglobin, and 300 μmNADPH in a total reaction volume of 300 μl. Heterodimer concentration was maintained at 0.2 μm in the cuvette. The reactions were initiated by adding NADPH and run for 3 min at 37 °C. The NO-mediated conversion of oxyhemoglobin to methemoglobin was monitored at 401 nm and converted to a rate of NO synthesis using a difference extinction coefficient of ε401 = 38 mm−1cm−1. Similar assays contained ScaM1 V144M protein or CaMTnC chimeras at 3 μm final concentration. NADPH oxidation rates were measured at 340 nm in the presence of oxyhemoglobin under identical conditions, and the rate of NADPH oxidation was calculated using an extinction coefficient of ε340 = 6.2 mm−1cm−1. H2O2-dependent nNOS oxidation of NOHA to nitrite was assayed in 96-well microplates at 37 °C as described previously (39Adak S. Wang Q. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33554-33561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) with modification. The assay volume was 100 μl and contained 40 mm EPPS, pH 7.6, 300 nm nNOS heterodimer or homodimeric nNOS, 1 mmNOHA, 1 mm DTT, 25 units/ml superoxide dismutase, and 100 μm H4B. Reactions were initiated by adding 30 mm H2O2 and stopped after 10 min incubation at 37 °C by adding 1300 units of catalase. Nitrite was detected at 550 nm after adding Griess reagent (100 μl) and quantitated based on nitrite standards. All samples were equilibrated at 25 °C under anaerobic conditions in EPPS buffer (pH 7.6) saturated with CO. The cuvette contained a heterodimer formed from 3 μm of either G671A or G671A/E592A full-length mutant with 6 μm wild type nNOSoxy, in CO-saturated 40 mmEPPS buffer, pH 7.6, containing 0.5 mm DTT, 100 μm H4B, 10 mm Arg, 3 μm CaM, 0.9 mm Ca2+, and 0.6 mm EDTA. Concentrated anaerobic NADPH solution was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mm, and successive spectral measurements were recorded. After spectral change had stopped, a small amount of dithionite solution was added, and the spectrum was recorded again. Heme reduction was measured as the absorbance difference between 444 and 500 nm and was quantitated using the initial spectrum recorded without NADPH as a base line and the dithionite-reduced spectrum as representing 100% reduced heme. Arg binding affinity was studied at room temperature by perturbation difference spectrometry according to methods described previously (6Gacchui R. Ghosh D.K. Wu C. Parkinson J.P. Crane B.R.

The buffer contained 40 mm EPPS, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 10 μm H4B, and 2 μm enzyme. 1 mmimidazole was added to the cuvette prior to titration with Arg (0–1m). The Kd of Arg was calculated by double reciprocal analysis of the absorbance differencesversus substrate concentration. The G671A mutation in rat nNOS is analogous to the previously characterized G450A mutation in mouse iNOS, which completely inhibits homodimer formation but permits heterodimer formation with either wild type monomers or monomers that contain a distinct mutation (34Siddhanta U.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6260-6270Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We thus hoped that G671A nNOS would display a similar phenotype to facilitate heterodimer formation. The nNOS E592A mutation is analogous to the previously characterized E371A mutation in mouse iNOS and E361A mutation in human eNOS. Both mutations completely prevent Arg binding in homodimeric NOS (6Gacchui R. Ghosh D.K. Wu C. Parkinson J.P. Crane B.R. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5097-5103Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 44Chen P.F. Tsai A.L. Berka V. Wu K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6114-6118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and studies with iNOS show that a heterodimer containing only one E371A mutation displays normal Arg binding in the partner subunit that does not contain this mutation (34Siddhanta U.

This is consistent with crystal structure data showing that Glu371 is a key protein residue that holds substrate Arg above the heme in the active site by forming hydrogen bonds between its carboxylate group and two guanidino nitrogens of Arg (9Crane B.R Arvai A.S Ghosh D.K.

Wu C. Parkinson J.P. Crane B.R. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5097-5103Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar,44Chen P.F. Tsai A.L. Berka V. Wu K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6114-6118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), we expected that its mutation would also prevent Arg binding in nNOS. Gel filtration of full-length nNOS mutants purified in the absence of Arg and H4B showed that G671A was predominantly monomeric but still contained some detectable dimer, whereas the E592A/G671A double mutant was almost completely monomeric (Fig. 2). In comparison, wild type nNOS purified under identical conditions was predominantly dimeric (Fig. 2, inset), consistent with previous reports (29Klatt P. Pfeffer S. List B.M. Lehner D. Glatter O.

Chem. 1995; 270: 17791-17796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The gel filtration profiles of G671A and the double mutant did not change after incubating the proteins overnight with 10 mm Arg or 100 μm H4B alone or in combination (Fig. 2). Gel filtration of nNOSoxyE592A showed that it was predominantly dimeric (data not shown), consistent with the analogous iNOS mutant (6Gacchui R. Ghosh D.K. Wu C. Parkinson J.P. Crane B.R. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5097-5103Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We conclude that (a) the G671A mutation causes a partial defect in nNOS homodimer formation that cannot be overcome by Arg or H4B and (b) the E592A mutation does not prevent nNOS dimer formation. UV-visible spectra of purified nNOS G671A, G671A/E592A, and nNOSoxyE592A under various conditions are shown in Fig.3. Reduction by dithionite in the presence of CO allowed formation of ferrous heme-CO complex absorbing at 444 nm for all three proteins (Fig. 3,insets). This indicates proper heme incorporation with cysteine thiolate axial ligation. Spectra of the ferric proteins in buffer containing DTT show a split Soret absorbance at 380 and 460 nm in all cases. This is characteristic of a bis-thiolate in which the ferric NOS heme iron has bound DTT (46Ghosh D.K. Wu C. Pitters E. Moloney E.R. Mayer B. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10609-10619Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). There is also some absorbance present at 415–430 nm in the spectra of G671A and nNOSoxyE592A that is due either to incomplete DTT binding or some binding of imidazole carried over from the purification. Adding Arg alone brought about a weak but discernible shift in the spectrum of G671A that indicated displacement of bound DTT by Arg and a shift toward a high spin state (Fig. 3, trace B,upper panel). Adding Arg failed to produce this change in the spectra of G671A/E592A or nNOSoxyE592A mutants (trace B, middle and lower panels). The addition of H4B alone caused a shift in the spectra toward high spin in all three mutants, indicating that H4B displaced some bound DTT (trace C, all panels). The H4B effect was most prominent in nNOSoxyE592A, consistent with this protein being predominantly dimeric. Further addition of Arg to the H4B-bound proteins slightly increased"
https://openalex.org/W2078537682,"In this study we investigated the molecular mechanisms whereby insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) induced Twist gene expression and the role of Twist in the anti-apoptotic actions of the IGF-1 receptor. In NIH-3T3 fibroblasts overexpressing the human IGF-1 receptor (NWTb3), treatment with IGF-1 (10−8m) for 1 and 4 h increased the level of Twist mRNA as well as protein by 3-fold. In contrast, insulin at physiological concentrations did not stimulate Twist expression in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts overexpressing the human insulin receptor. The IGF-1 effect was specific for the IGF-1 receptor since, in cells overexpressing a dominant negative IGF-1 receptor, IGF-1 failed to increase Twist expression. Pre-incubation with the ERK1/2 inhibitor U0126 or expression of a dominant negative MEK-1 abolished the effect of IGF-1 on Twist mRNA expression in NWTb3 cells, suggesting that Twist induction by IGF-1 occurs via the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway. In vivo, IGF-1 injection increased the mRNA level of Twist in mouse skeletal muscle, the major site of Twist expression. Finally, using an antisense strategy, we demonstrated that a reduction of 40% in Twist expression decreased significantly the ability of IGF-1 to rescue NWTb3 cells from etoposide-induced apoptosis. Taken together, these results define Twist as an important factor involved in the anti-apoptotic actions of the IGF-1 receptor.

Insulin and IGF-1 receptors (IR and IGF-1R, respectively) share the same overall structure. They are composed of two extracellular α subunits containing the ligand binding domain and two transmembrane β subunits possessing tyrosine kinase activity (1Yarden Y. Ullrich A.

Both receptors are capable of binding insulin and IGF-1, but each receptor binds its own ligand with a 100–1000 fold higher affinity than that of the heterologous peptide. IR and IGF-1R have intracellular downstream events that are highly similar. Both receptors phosphorylate on tyrosine residues the same substrates such as the insulin receptor substrate proteins (1 through 4 (Refs. 3Myers M.G. Sun X.J. Cheatham B. Jachna B.R. Glasheen E.M.

Despite close similarities in their receptor structure and signaling pathways, insulin and IGF-1 have different physiological functions (11Liu J.P. Baker J. Perkins A.S. Robertson E.J.

Insulin acts primarily as a regulator of metabolism, whereas IGF-1 functions predominantly in the control of cell growth, cell survival and differentiation. In order to understand the molecular basis for the different functions of the IGF-1 and insulin receptors, we previously used cDNA microarray expression profiling to identify genes that are differentially regulated by IGF-1 and insulin in mouse fibroblast NIH-3T3 cells. 2J. Dupont, J. Khan, B. H. Qu, P. Metzler, L. Helman, and D. LeRoith, submitted for publication. The mRNA level of Twist was increased more than 2-fold following 90 min of IGF-1 stimulation. However, no increase in Twist expression was observed following insulin stimulation. Twist belongs to the basic helix-loop-helix family of transcription factors, which play a central role in cell type determination and differentiation in both vertebrates and invertebrates (15Olson E.N. Klein W.H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). The basic helix-loop-helix proteins are defined by the basic domain that mediates specific DNA binding and the helix-loop-helix domain that acts as a protein-protein interaction domain (16Kadesch T. Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 49-55PubMed Google Scholar). Twist is expressed in mesodermal and cranial neural crest cells during embryogenesis (17Thisse B. Stoetzel C. Gorostiza-Thisse C. Perrin-Schmitt F. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2175-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). It has been implicated in the inhibition of differentiation of multiple cell lineages including muscle (18Spicer D.B. Rhee J. Cheung W.L. Lassar A.B. Science. 1996; 272: 1476-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 19Hamamori Y. Wu H.Y. Sartorelli V. Kedes L. Mol. Cell.

Biochem. 1999; 75: 566-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). For example, in C2C12 myoblasts (22Hebrok M. Wertz K. Fuchtbauer E.M. Dev. Biol. 1994; 165: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) as well as in ES cell-derived embryoid bodies (23Rohwedel J. Horak V. Hebrok M. Fuchtbauer E.M. Wobus A.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 220: 92-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), Twist expression inhibits muscle differentiation. In C2C12 cells, this inhibition was reversible by blocking Twist expression using an antisense Twist oligonucleotides. In chicken skeletal muscle, the induction of Twist by hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) enables the satellite cells to proliferate and prevents differentiation (24Leshem Y. Spicer D.B. Gal-Levi R. Halevy O. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 184: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Although the inhibitory mechanisms are as yet unclear, some hypotheses have been proposed. In vitro, some studies show that both murine and Drosophila Twist protein can inhibit the expression and activity of myogenic genes. The suggested mechanisms involve the inactivation of the myogenic factors such as MyoD through heterodimerization with Twist or through inhibition by Twist of myogenic factors binding to DNA (18Spicer D.B. Rhee J. Cheung W.L. Lassar A.B. Science. 1996; 272: 1476-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 22Hebrok M. Wertz K. Fuchtbauer E.M. Dev. Biol. 1994; 165: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Twist has also been demonstrated to inhibit apoptosis in mouse embryonic fibroblasts that express both E1A and Ha-Ras (C8 MEF), a cell line in which apoptosis has a demonstrated dependence on p53 function (25Maestro R. Dei Tos A.P. Hamamori Y. Krasnokutsky S. Sartorelli V. Kedes L. Doglioni C. Beach D.H. Hannon G.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2207-2217Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). It is well known that IGF-1 is a powerful inhibitor of apoptosis caused by a variety of injuries in various cells. For example, addition of IGF-1 inhibits apoptosis induced by serum withdrawal in PC12 cells (26Parrizas M. Saltiel A.R. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 154-161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar), IL-3 withdrawal in hemopoietic cells (27McCubrey J.A. Steelman L.S. Mayo M.W. Algate P.A. Dellow R.A. Kaleko M. Blood. 1991; 78: 921-929Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as well as by c-Myc overexpression (28Harrington E.A. Bennett M.R. Fanidi A. Evan G.I. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3286-3295Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar), anticancer drugs (29Dunn S.E. Hardman R.A. Kari F.W. Barrett J.C. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2687-2693PubMed Google Scholar), and transforming growth factor β1 in fibroblasts (30Hsing A.Y. Kadomatsu K. Bonham M.J. Danielpour D. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5146-5149PubMed Google Scholar). However, in different cell types and depending on the apoptotic stimulus, the mechanisms by which the IGF-1R protects cells from apoptosis vary considerably. In this study, we investigated the mode of IGF-1 action on Twist gene expression and the role of Twist in the anti-apoptotic effects of IGF-1. We show that IGF-1 increases mRNA as well as protein levels of Twist in vitro in mouse fibroblasts overexpressing the human IGF-1R (NWTb3), whereas insulin fails to affect Twist expression in mouse fibroblasts overexpressing the human IR (IR cells). Moreover,in vivo, IGF-1 injections increased Twist expression in mouse skeletal muscle where Twist is predominantly expressed. We also investigated which IGF-1R signaling pathway was involved in the induction of Twist expression using different pharmacological inhibitors and a dominant negative MEK-1 construct. The results indicate that the MAPK pathway is primarily involved in IGF-1-induced Twist expression. Finally, using an antisense strategy in NWTb3 cells, we show that Twist is positively involved in the IGF-1 inhibition of apoptosis induced by etoposide treatment. The radionuclide [α-32P]dCTP (6000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Recombinant human IGF-1 (rhIGF-1) was a gift of Genentech (South San Francisco, CA). PI3K-specific inhibitor LY 294002 and etoposide were purchased from Sigma. Both MEK1/2-specific inhibitor U 0126 and p38 MAPK-specific inhibitor SB 202190 were from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). The stock solutions of pharmacological inhibitors such as LY 294002, U 0126, and SB 202190 were all prepared in Me2SO at a concentration of 1000-fold, so that when they were added to the culture medium, the concentration of Me2SO was below 0.1%. Monoclonal anti-actin (clone AC) was obtained from Sigma. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to phospho-Akt (Ser473), Akt, phospho-Erk1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204), and cleaved caspase-3 were purchased from New England Biolabs Inc. (Beverly, MA). Rabbit polyclonal antibody to PARP, which reacts with the PARP full-length and the 24/31-kDa, cleaved PARP product, was from Oncogene (Cambridge, MA). Rabbit polyclonal antibody to Erk1 (C16) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). All antibodies were used at a 1/1000 dilution in Western blotting. The dominant negative construct of MEK-1 (pCDNAIII-MEKA) was kindly provided by Dr. J. S. Gutkind (NIDCR, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MA). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to Twist and the Twist antisense pcDNA3 construct were kindly donated by Dr. C. A. Glackin (Division of Molecular Medicine, Loma Linda University, Loma Linda, CA). MCF-7, COS-7, C2C12, and PC3 cells were obtained from ATCC (Rockville, MD). The parental mouse embryonic fibroblast NIH-3T3 cell line expresses ∼16 × 103 IGF-IR/cell (31Blakesley V. Kato H. Roberts C.T. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2764-2769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The NWTb3 cell line established in our laboratory expresses the normal human IGF-IR at a level of ∼4 × 105 receptors/cell (31Blakesley V. Kato H. Roberts C.T. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2764-2769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The NKR1 cell line, where the Lys1003 residue at the ATP-binding site was replaced by arginine (NKR1 mutant) (32Kato H. Faria T.N. Stannard B. Roberts C.T. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2655-2661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), expresses the dominant-negative human IGF-IR (∼ 3–7 × 105receptors/cell). The IR cell line, a gift from Dr. S. Taylor (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD), expresses the human wild-type IR at a level of about 2 × 106 receptors/cell (33Levy-Toledano R. Accili D. Taylor S.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1220: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The parental NIH-3T3, MCF-7, COS-7, C2C12, and PC-3 cell lines were routinely cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, and 300 µg/mll-glutamine in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 (37 °C). NWTb3, IR, and NKR1 cells were cultured in the same medium with the addition of Geneticin (0.5 g/liter, Life Technologies, Inc.). For Twist antisense, the transfection method using Effectene (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. Subconfluent NWTb3 cells were transfected with either hygromycin pcDNA3 (Hygro, negative control) or Twist antisense hygromycin pcDNA3 construct (TWIAS). After 48 h, the cells were cultured in the same medium supplemented with Geneticin (0.5 g/liter) and hygromycin (0.2 g/liter, CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). Male C57BL/6j mice weighting 15–20 g were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) at 3 weeks of age. They were maintained on a 12-h light/12-h darkness cycle in a temperature-controlled room and given free access to commercial mouse chow and water. Mice were fasted overnight, anesthetized with avertin (15 ml/kg body weight) intraperitoneally, and abdominal cavities were opened and the inferior vena cava exposed. A bolus of IGF-1 was then injected. For dose responses we utilized 0.5–10 mg/kg IGF-I, and for the time course we utilized 2.0 mg/kg IGF-I. Cell lysates were prepared in lysis buffer A (10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) containing various protease inhibitors (2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mg/ml leupeptin, 10 mg/ml aprotinin) and phosphatase inhibitors (100 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate). Lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 × gfor 20 min at 4 °C, and then the protein concentration in the supernatants was determined using the BCA protein assay. 50 µg of total protein samples were electrophoresed in a SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline plus 0.1% Tween for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were probed with the various antibodies as indicated in the figure legends. After extensive washing, bands were detected with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies followed by enhanced chemiluminescence. Densitometry was performed by scanning the radiographs and then analyzing the bands with the MacBas version 2.52 software (Fuji Photo Film U.S.A., Inc.). PARP catalyzes the ADP-ribosylation of nuclear proteins at the sites where DNA strands break spontaneously and thereby facilitates the repair of this DNA damage (34Allen R.T. Cluck M.W. Agrawal D.K. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 427-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). A critical step in the regulation of apoptosis is the proteolytic inactivation of PARP by caspases (34Allen R.T. Cluck M.W. Agrawal D.K. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 427-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Hygro and TWIAS cells were plated in 100-mm dishes in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. After 16 h of incubation, medium was changed to DMEM with 1% FBS and cells were treated or not with 25 µm etoposide. Etoposide is a topoisomerase II inhibitor that induces cell cycle arrest or apoptosis when applied in high concentrations (35Qu B.H. Karas M. Koval A. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31179-31184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). After 2 days of treatment, IGF-1 (10−8m) was added or not for 24 h and cell lysates were prepared in the lysis buffer containing 50 mm Pipes (pH 6.5), 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Chaps, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 20 µg/leupeptin, 10 µg/ml pepstatin, 10 µg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cleavage of PARP and caspase-3 in Hygro and TWIAS cells were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-PARP and anti-cleaved caspase-3 antibodies. Cells (Hygro and TWIAS) were washed twice in Hepes buffer (10 mmHEPES, 140 mm NaCl, and 2.5 mmCaCl2) at room temperature as described before (36Karas M. Zaks T.Z. Liu J.L. LeRoith D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 4441-4450Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Cells were resuspended in 0.2 ml of Hepes buffer supplemented with 2 µl of annexin-V-FLUOS (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 5 µl of 7-amino-actinomycin solution (Via-Probe; PharMingen) and were incubated for 15 min at room temperature in the dark. The staining was analyzed by flow cytometry using a FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). At the indicated times after treatment with IGF-1, mouse tissues were excised and frozen immediately. Total RNA from tissue was extracted using TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. The same technique was used to isolate total RNA from cells stimulated or unstimulated. 20 µg of total RNA from tissue or cells was separated by denaturing formaldehyde electrophoresis, then transferred by capillary blot to positively charged nylon membrane overnight, and immobilized by exposure to UV light. Blots were prehybridized for 2 h at 42 °C in a buffer containing formamide 50%, 5× Denhardt's, 1% SDS, 5× SSC, and 100 µl/ml salmon sperm and hybridized overnight at the same temperature with 2 × 106 cpm/ml [32P]dCTP-labeled DNA probe in a buffer containing 50% formamide, 2.5× Denhardt's, 1% SDS, 5× SSC, and 100 µl/ml salmon sperm. The Twist 32P-labeled probe using the Rediprime labeling kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was generated from cDNA of Twist obtained from a microarray study (clone ID 479 367 from Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL). Finally, blots were washed to high stringency and hybridized radioactivity was measured using a PhosphoImager apparatus (FujiFilm, Stamford, CT). Autoradiography was also carried out at −70 °C. The integrity and the quantification of different transcripts were assessed using the human RNA 18 S probe from Ambion, Inc. (Austin, TX). NWTb3 cells were seeded the day before the transfection. Cells were then transiently transfected using the Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions with 1 µg of a MEK-1 dominant negative construct (MEK-1 (−/−) or an empty vector (empty vector). 24 h after transfection, cells were switched to serum-free medium (DMEM) for 16 h, followed by the addition of IGF-1 (10−8m, 90 min), and then total RNA was extracted. In order to check ERK1/2 phosphorylation in NWTb3 cells transfected with the MEK-1 (−/−) construct and compare with cells transfected with vector alone, cells were starved overnight 24 h after transfection and stimulated with IGF-I (10−8m, 10 min at 37 °C). Protein extracts were prepared as described previously, and Western blot analyses were performed with anti-phospho Erk-1/2 antibody to detect Erk-1/2 phosphorylation induced by IGF-I stimulation as well as with an Erk-1 antibody to detect Erk-1/2 protein levels. To characterize the differential effects of insulin and IGF-1 on Twist expression in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts, cells overexpressing either the human IR (33Levy-Toledano R. Accili D. Taylor S.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1220: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) or IGF-1 receptor (NWTb3, Ref. 31Blakesley V. Kato H. Roberts C.T. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2764-2769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) were treated with various concentrations of insulin or IGF-1, respectively. Expression of Twist was then determined by Northern blot analysis. As shown in Fig.1 A, incubation for 90 min with IGF-1 (10−9m) or (10−8m) increased the abundance of Twist mRNA in NWTb3 cells by ∼2- and ∼3-fold, respectively. Interestingly, in IR cells, treatment with insulin (10−9m) or (10−8m) for 90 min failed to increase Twist mRNA levels (Fig. 1 B). However, a very high concentration of insulin (10−6m) increased Twist mRNA. Thus, physiological concentrations of IGF-1 and non-physiological concentrations of insulin stimulate Twist mRNA expression in NWTb3 or IR fibroblasts, respectively. In order to demonstrate that IGF-1 increases Twist expression through the IGF-1R, NIH-3T3 parental cells and a cell line overexpressing the dominant negative human IGF-IR, NKR1 cells (32Kato H. Faria T.N. Stannard B. Roberts C.T. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2655-2661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were stimulated with IGF-1 (10−8m) for 90 min. It has been previously shown that NIH-3T3 cells express ∼16,000 IGF-IR/cell as compared with the NWTb3 cells (∼4 × 105IGF-IR/cell). As shown in Fig. 2, the increase in Twist expression in response to IGF-1 was observed only in NWTb3 cells overexpressing normal IGF-IRs as compared with parental NIH-3T3 and NKR1 cell lines. The lack of identifiable response in the parental NIH-3T3 cells is mostly due to the fewer number of IGF-I receptors. Taken together, these data demonstrate that IGF-1R activation is necessary to increase Twist expression. We also studied the level of Twist mRNA and protein in NWTb3 cells treated with IGF-1 for various times. Using Northern blot analysis, we show that IGF-1 (10−8m) increased Twist mRNA level maximally after 4 h of stimulation. This effect is reduced after 8 h and abolished after 16 h of stimulation (Fig. 3 A). We also show that the amount of Twist protein (26 kDa) increased 3-fold after 4 h of IGF-1 treatment (Fig. 3 B). This increase was observed up to 12 h of IGF-1 treatment. However, after 24 h of stimulation, the effect of IGF-1 was abolished. Thus, the time course for Twist protein expression correlates well with the expression of Twist mRNA induced by IGF-1. These observations demonstrate that the stimulatory effect of IGF-1 on Twist gene expression in NWTb3 cells leads to the production of Twist protein under these conditions. In order to study the signaling pathways involved in IGF-1's induction of TWIST expression, inhibitors specific for p38, ERK1/2, and PI3K were used. First, we determined the active concentration of each inhibitor. NWTb3 cells were treated for 1 h with the inhibitors prior to the IGF-1 stimulation (10−8m, 10 min). Western blot analysis (Fig.4 A) revealed the dose-dependent inhibition of SB 202190 (p38 pathway), U 0126 (ERK1/2 pathway), and LY 294002 (PI3K pathway), respectively, on the IGF-1-induced p38, ERK1/2, and Akt phosphorylation. As shown in Fig. 4 A, 50 µm LY 294002 was able to inhibit Akt phosphorylation induced by IGF-1 and in the same manner, 0.5 µm U 0126 and 50 µm SB 202190 inhibited ERK1/2 and p38 phosphorylation, respectively (Fig. 4 A). Western blot analyses, performed to detect all forms of Akt, ERK1/2 and p38 kinases, revealed that protein levels were similar among the samples. Moreover, we found that the same dose of each inhibitor (50 µm LY 294002, 0.5 µm U0126, and 50 µm SB 202190) also inhibited Akt, MAPK, and p38 in vitro activities respectively (data not shown). Fig. 4 Bindicates that neither PI3K pathway inhibitor LY 294002 nor p38 inhibitor SB 202190 affected IGF-1-induced Twist expression. However, the addition of U0126 abrogated the increase of Twist expression induced by IGF-1 stimulation. Thus, in NWTb3 cells, the expression of Twist induced by IGF-1R activation is apparently mediated through the MAPK pathway. In order to confirm this result, NWTb3 cells were transiently transfected with a dominant negative MEK-1 construct (MEK-1 (−/−)). Upon IGF-1 stimulation, there was an 80% reduction in ERK1/2 phosphorylation after transfection of the dominant negative construct (Fig. 5 A). Northern blot analysis was performed on NWTb3 transfected with MEK-1 dominant negative (MEK-1 (−/−)) or empty vector (empty vector) as a control (Fig. 5 B). Upon IGF-1 stimulation, in cells transfected with empty vector, Twist mRNA expression was increased by 2.5-fold as compared with unstimulated cells. However, when NWTb3 cells were transfected with a dominant negative MEK-1, the IGF-1-induced Twist expression was not observed. Thus, the inhibition of the MAPK pathway, either by a specific ERK1/2 inhibitor (Fig. 4 B) or by the expression of MEK-1 dominant negative in NWTb3 (Fig. 5 B), results in inhibition of the IGF-1-induced Twist mRNA expression. Twist has been shown to be implicated in the control of diverse developmental processes in different tissues as well as inhibition of apoptosis (25Maestro R. Dei Tos A.P. Hamamori Y. Krasnokutsky S. Sartorelli V. Kedes L. Doglioni C. Beach D.H. Hannon G.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2207-2217Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). In order to determine the role of Twist in the anti-apoptotic action of IGF-1, we generated Twist antisense clones (TWIAS). The Twist antisense clones were developed by stable transfection of NWTb3 cells with pcDNA3-hygro-TWIAS expression vector as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Several hygromycin resistant clones were analyzed by immunoblotting using an anti-Twist antibody. Three clones were selected, designated as AS-1 to AS-3. In parallel, NWTb3 cells were stably transfected with the pcDNA3 hygromycin empty vector and two control clones (hygro1 and 2) were generated. Twist (26 kDa) immunoreactivity was reduced by 40–45% in the AS-1, AS-2, and AS-3 compared with the hygro1 and hygro2 clones (Fig.6 A). Control and TWIAS cells were preincubated or not with 25 µm etoposide for 48 h (a dose that induces apoptosis (35Qu B.H. Karas M. Koval A. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31179-31184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 38Sell C. Baserga R. Rubin R. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 303-306PubMed Google Scholar)), and then IGF-1 (10−8m) was added or not to the medium for an additional 24 h. Apoptosis was determined by annexin-V staining, which measures the translocation of phosphatidylserine to the outer plasma membrane, one of the earliest detectable events in the induction of apoptosis (39van Engeland M. Nieland L.J. Ramaekers F.C. Schutte B. Reutelingsperger C.P. Cytometry. 1998; 31: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (1552) Google Scholar). In both control (hygro1) and Twist antisense (TWIAS-2) NWTb3 cells, the percentage of apoptotic cells represented less than 5% in basal state (DMEM with 1% FBS) and about 30% after etoposide treatment for 48 h. IGF-1 treatment (10−8m) for 24 h decreased the percentage of apoptotic cells to 8 ± 1% (p < 0.001) and 20 ± 3% in control and Twist antisense cells, respectively. The level of necrotic cells (annexin-V- and 7-amino-actinomycin-positive) was similar (about 10%) in both control and Twist antisense cells under these conditions. We also determined the level of PARP (Fig. 6 C) and caspase-3 cleavage (data not shown). A critical step in the control of the apoptotic DNA fragmentation is the"

These experiments suggest that the BLM helicase interacts with a variety of nuclear proteins to perform functions in DNA replication, recombination, or repair.To understand the role of the BLM helicase in maintaining genomic stability, a yeast two-hybrid screen was used to identify proteins that directly interact with BLM; the DNA mismatch repair protein MLH1 was identified. Far Western analysis and immunoprecipitations confirmed the direct interaction of these two proteins through the C terminus of BLM.In vitro assays did not demonstrate a role for BLM, however, in DNA mismatch repair. These data suggest that the BLM helicase and MLH1 may function cooperatively in maintaining genomic stability independent of DNA mismatch repair.RESULTSTo identify protein partners of the BLM helicase, cDNA segments encoding the N terminus, helicase domain and C terminus were cloned into a GAL4-yeast two-hybrid vector and used to screen a human B-lymphocyte cDNA library (Fig.1 A). The C terminus of BLM, amino acids 1036–1417, identified five clones, two of which contained a full-length cDNA encoding the DNA mismatch repair protein MLH1 (Fig. 1 B).IVTT products were mixed and immunoprecipitated to investigate the interaction between BLM and MLH1. MLH1 is present when mixed with the C terminus of BLM and immunoprecipitated with an antibody specific for BLM (Fig. 2). The C terminus of BLM is detectable when mixed with MLH1 and immunoprecipitated with an MLH1-specific antibody. The N-terminal and helicase domains of the BLM helicase were unable to co-precipitate with MLH1 (data not shown). These data provide further evidence that BLM and MLH1 interact in vitro through the C terminus of BLM.Figure 2Immunoprecipitations of in vitrotranscribed and translated ( IVTT ) protein products demonstrate the interaction between the C terminus of BLM and MLH1.

The first lane of each Western blot contains K562 NE and insect cell lysates infected with BLM baculovirus (BLM) as a control to show the size and specificity of α-BLM (Novus), α-MLH1 (PharMingen) and α-RPA (Santa Cruz) antibodies. In A, the second lane contains mixed lysates immunoprecipitated with an IgG control while thethird lane contains mixed lysates immunoprecipitated with α-MLH1. In B, the second lane contains K562 NE immunoprecipitated with goat IgG, the third land contains K562 NE immunoprecipitated with α-BLM (Santa Cruz), the fourth lane contains mixed lysates immunoprecipitated with goat IgG, and the fifth lane contains mixed lysates immunoprecipitated with α-BLM (Santa Cruz). In B, the Western blot was probed with α-MLH1. Fig. 3 C shows the same Western blot asB stripped and probed with α-RPA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Far Western assays were performed to confirm the in vitrointeraction of the C terminus of BLM and MLH1. Protein induction studies in bacteria show that the C terminus of BLM was expressed at high levels in E. coli but was only present in the insoluble fraction (data not shown). The C terminus of BLM was consequently isolated under denaturing conditions using nickel chromatography and then slowly dialyzed into buffer. Purified fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie staining to identify several fractions that were more than 90% pure. Far Western assays then confirmed that the C terminus of BLM and MLH1 interact in vitro. Briefly, the C terminus of BLM was bound to PVDF membrane and incubated in nuclear extracts; bound proteins were eluted. Western blot analysis with an α-MLH1 antibody detected a 90-kDa band (as well as some smaller degradation products) that co-migrates with both the lysate control and IVTT MLH1 (Fig. 4). Although high salt washes greatly diminished the interaction between the two proteins, membrane alone and membrane coated with a nonspecific protein, cytochrome c, did not bind MLH1 demonstrating the specificity of the BLM-MLH1 interaction. MLH1 was also expressedin vitro by IVTT and was capable of binding to the immobilized C terminus of BLM (Fig. 4).Figure 4Far Western assays demonstrate the interaction between the BLM-C terminus and MLH1. Lane 1contains 25 µg of K562 nuclear extract (NE) to show the size of MLH1. The sample in lane 2 is IVTT-MLH1, which includes 10 µl of the IVTT-MLH1 mixture used in these experiments.Lane 3 shows proteins bound to BLM-C protein following incubation in 25 µg of K562 NE. Lane 4 shows protein bound to BLM-C protein following incubation with 25 µg of K562 NE and a 500 mm NaCl wash. Lane 5 shows protein bound to BLM-C protein following incubation with 10 µl of IVTT-MLH1.Lane 6 shows protein bound to PVDF membrane blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk following incubation with 10 µl of IVTT-MLH1.Lane 7 shows protein bound to cytochrome cfollowing incubation with 10 µl of IVTT-MLH1. Samples were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To test for in vivo interactions, K562 NE were used for immunoprecipitation with α-BLM or α-MLH1 antibodies. MLH1 was co-immunoprecipitated with BLM from K562 NE but was not present in the IgG control immunoprecipitates (Fig. 5). Endogenous BLM could not be detected when lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibodies that recognize MLH1. This may be due to the low expression levels of BLM in this cell line, its cell cycle-specific regulation, or the binding affinity of the BLM antibodies. It should be noted that Wang et al. have immunoprecipitated MLH1 and identified BLM, although the reverse experiment was not performed (13Wang Y. Cortez D. Yazdi P. Neff N. Elledge S.J. Qin J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 927-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar).Figure 5BLM and MLH1 interact in vivo. K562 nuclear extracts were immunoprecipitated with α-BLM antibodies or a goat IgG control. Lane 1contains lysates from K562 NE showing the size of MLH1. Lane 2 contains an immunoprecipitation from the same extracts using a goat IgG as a negative control. Lane 3 contains an immunoprecipitation from the same extracts using an α-BLM antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Finally, the functional significance of the interaction between BLM and MLH1 was tested by examining the ability of BS cell extracts to carry out DNA mismatch repair by measuring their ability to repair mispaired substrates in vitro. M13mp2 DNA was used as a repair substrate and contained a covalently closed (+) strand and a (−) strand with a nick (to direct repair to this strand) located several hundred base pairs away from the mispair in the lacZαcomplementation gene. The (+) strand encodes one plaque phenotype (either colorless or blue) and the (−) strand encodes another plaque phenotype. If the unrepaired heteroduplex is introduced into anE. coli strain deficient in methyl-directed mismatch repair, plaques will have a mixed phenotype due to expression of both strands. However, repair in a repair-proficient human cell extract will reduce the percentage of mixed plaques and increase the ratio of the (+) strand phenotype relative to that of the (−) strand phenotype as the nick directs repair to the (−) strand.BS cell extracts repair a G-G mispair as efficiently as a HeLa cell extract, which is repair proficient (Fig.6 A). Repair is observed regardless of whether the nick is 3′ or 5′ to the mismatch, consistent with the bi-directional repair capability of the human mismatch repair system. The change in the ratio of blue to colorless plaques (Fig.6 B) indicates that repair is specific for the minus strand as directed by the nick in that strand. The BS extract also repairs substrates containing an A-C mismatch or either of two different unrepaired nucleotides. In contrast to these results, extracts of cell lines exhibiting microsatellite instability and having mutations in any of four mismatch repair genes (hMSH2, GTBP,MLH1 , or PMS2) are uniformly deficient in strand-specific mismatch repair (data not shown). These results suggest that BLM does not directly function in the mismatch repair pathway but may play crucial roles in the processing of heteroduplex formations during replication, recombination, or other types of DNA repair.Figure 6DNA mismatch repair activities of BS and HeLa cell extracts are equivalent. A, repair efficiency in percent of a G-G mispair at position 88 in thelacZα-complementation gene in extracts of BS or HeLa cells. B, the ratio of pure blue to pure colorless plaques from extracts of BS or HeLa cells. The results reflect counting more than 500 plaques/variable. In addition to the results shown, repair in an extract from BS cells was also observed for the following substrates, with the (+) strand listed first, the (−) strand listed next (where a dash indicates a missing nucleotide), and the position of the mismatch listed last: C*A at 87, 25% repair; *T at 91, 86% repair; C* at 132–136, 82% repair. These substrates all contained a 3′-nick at position −264.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONYeast two-hybrid screens with specific domains of the BLM helicase were used to identify putative protein partners of BLM. With the C terminus of the BLM helicase as bait, candidate proteins were identified including the human DNA mismatch repair protein MLH1.In vitro immunoprecipitations and far Western analysis demonstrated a direct interaction between MLH1 and the C terminus of BLM. Finally, mixed lysate immunoprecipitation with cells over-expressing full-length BLM and in vivoimmunoprecipitations confirmed the interaction. Our results demonstrate that MLH1 is a protein partner of the BLM helicase in addition to topoisomerase IIIα and replication protein A (14Brosh J. Li J.L. Kenny M.K. Karow J.K. Cooper M.P.

Mastrangelo M.A. Dewolf W. Ellis N.A. Marciniak R.A. Yin Y. Jaenisch R. Guarente L. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1162-1167PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro DNA mismatch repair assays were performed to determine whether the BLM helicase is necessary for DNA mismatch repair. Cell extracts lacking functional BLM helicase activity were competent for DNA mismatch repair. These data suggest that the BLM/MLH1 interaction may be important for specific DNA repair events independent of the repair of single DNA mismatches.The BLM helicase is implicated in DNA replication, recombination, and/or repair. The primary defect leading to hyperrecombination in BS cells may be due to improper processing of DNA intermediates at stalled replication forks during DNA synthesis (21Lonn U. Lonn S. Nylen U. Winblad G. German J. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 3141-3145PubMed Google Scholar, 22Chakraverty R.K. Hickson I.D. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 286-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 23Frei C. Gasser S.M. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2641-2646Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These stalled forks can result in double strand breaks if they are not correctly handled by cellular DNA repair machinery. It is unclear exactly how the BLM helicase resolves stalled replication forks, but double strand break repair via homologous or non-homologous recombination may be one explanation (24Wang W. Seki M. Narita Y. Sonoda E. Takeda S. Yamada K. Masuko T. Katada T. Enomoto T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3428-3435Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). BLM may also recognize loops of di- and tri-nucleotide repeats generated by DNA replication due to polymerase slippage or by single-stranded annealing events occurring during gene conversion (25Kirkpatrick D.T. Petes T.D. Nature. 1997; 387: 929-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). BLM may untangle these loops for mismatch repair complexes to process them efficiently.Experiments using yeast mutants of sgs1, the S. cerevisiae homologue of BLM and WRN, and the mismatch repair gene msh2 may also provide clues to the functional significance of the BLM-MLH1 interaction (26Myung K. Datta A. Clark C. Kolodner R.D. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 113-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). sgs 1 mutation does not affect base substitution or frameshift mutation rates but increases gross chromosomal rearrangements. The mutation of both sgs1 and msh2 synergistically increases gross chromosomal rearrangements as well as homeologous recombination rates, suggesting that these proteins act in overlapping pathways to maintain genomic stability. Complexes containing BLM, MLH1, MSH2, and MSH6 have been identified using mass spectrometry (13Wang Y. Cortez D. Yazdi P. Neff N. Elledge S.J. Qin J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 927-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) suggesting common functional roles for these proteins. MSH2-MSH6 could function by directing BLM via MLH1 to Holliday junctions (27Marsischky G.T. Lee S. Griffith J. Kolodner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7200-7206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) since BLM can resolve these structures in vitro (12Karow J.K. Constantinou A. Li J.L. West S.C. Hickson I.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6504-6508Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar).MLH1-MLH3 and MSH4-MSH5 also play crucial roles in recombination, although the exact functions of these proteins are not well defined (28Wang T.F. Kleckner N. Hunter N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13914-13919Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 29Ross-Macdonald P. Roeder G.S. Cell. 1994; 79: 1069-1080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Complexed proteins like MLH1-MLH3 could act as sensors for recombination intermediates and possibly direct the BLM helicase to resolve these intermediates. Future studies will determine the mechanism by which mismatch repair complexes and the BLM helicase function to maintain genomic stability. Bloom's syndrome (BS)1is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by immunodeficiency, short stature, male infertility, and an increased risk of a broad spectrum of cancers (1German J. Dermatol. Clin. 1995; 13: 7-18Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells isolated from BS individuals are characterized by cytogenetic abnormalities, with the hallmark feature of hyperrecombination between sister chromatids. BS chromosomes also display increased levels of breaks, translocations, quadriradial formations, and telomeric associations (2German J. Cancer Genet. Cytogenet. 1997; 93: 100-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The gene mutated in BS was positionally cloned and namedBLM; it encodes a 1417-amino acid protein with strong homology to the Escherichia coli RecQ family of DNA and RNA helicases (3Ellis N.A. Groden J. Ye T.Z. Straughen J. Lennon D.J. Ciocci S. Proytcheva M. German J. Cell. 1995; 83: 655-666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar). The E. coli RecQ helicase participates in homologous recombination and suppresses illegitimate recombination (4Hanada K. Ukita T. Kohno Y. Saito K. Kato J. Ikeda H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3860-3865Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar,5Harmon F.G. Kowalczykowski S.C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1134-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Other eukaryotic RecQ family members include Sgs1p fromSaccharomyces cerevisiae and Rqh1p fromSchizosaccharomyces pombe; loss of function of either of these helicases results in genomic instability (6Watt P.M. Hickson I.D. Borts R.H. Louis E. Genetics. 1996; 144: 935-945Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Stewart E. Chapman C.R. Al-Khodairy F. Carr A.M. Enoch T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2682-2692Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Mutations in other human RecQ helicases result in the rare autosomal recessive disorders Werner's syndrome and Rothmund-Thomson syndrome, also characterized by chromosomal instability and cancer predisposition (8Yu C.E.

Genomics. 1999; 61: 268-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The BLM helicase unwinds duplex DNA from 3′ to 5′ in the presence of ATP (10Karow J.K. Chakraverty R.K. Hickson I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 0611-0614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 11Neff N.F. Ellis N.A. Ye T.Z. Noonan J. Huang K. Sanz M. Proytcheva M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 665-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). It also selectively recognizes and promotes branch migration of Holliday junctions in vitro (12Karow J.K. Constantinou A. Li J.L. West S.C. Hickson I.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6504-6508Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). BLM can be found in a large protein complex in the nucleus with other proteins involved in DNA repair such as BRCA1, ATM, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and replication factor C (13Wang Y. Cortez D. Yazdi P. Neff N. Elledge S.J. Qin J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 927-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). However, direct interactions of BLM have only been demonstrated biochemically with replication protein A (RPA) and topoisomerase IIIα (14Brosh J. Li J.L. Kenny M.K. Karow J.K. Cooper M.P.

These experiments suggest that the BLM helicase interacts with a variety of nuclear proteins to perform functions in DNA replication, recombination, or repair. To understand the role of the BLM helicase in maintaining genomic stability, a yeast two-hybrid screen was used to identify proteins that directly interact with BLM; the DNA mismatch repair protein MLH1 was identified. Far Western analysis and immunoprecipitations confirmed the direct interaction of these two proteins through the C terminus of BLM.In vitro assays did not demonstrate a role for BLM, however, in DNA mismatch repair. These data suggest that the BLM helicase and MLH1 may function cooperatively in maintaining genomic stability independent of DNA mismatch repair. RESULTSTo identify protein partners of the BLM helicase, cDNA segments encoding the N terminus, helicase domain and C terminus were cloned into a GAL4-yeast two-hybrid vector and used to screen a human B-lymphocyte cDNA library (Fig.1 A). The C terminus of BLM, amino acids 1036–1417, identified five clones, two of which contained a full-length cDNA encoding the DNA mismatch repair protein MLH1 (Fig. 1 B).IVTT products were mixed and immunoprecipitated to investigate the interaction between BLM and MLH1. MLH1 is present when mixed with the C terminus of BLM and immunoprecipitated with an antibody specific for BLM (Fig. 2). The C terminus of BLM is detectable when mixed with MLH1 and immunoprecipitated with an MLH1-specific antibody. The N-terminal and helicase domains of the BLM helicase were unable to co-precipitate with MLH1 (data not shown). These data provide further evidence that BLM and MLH1 interact in vitro through the C terminus of BLM.To study this in vitro interaction, lysates from insect cells that expressed full-length BLM were mixed with lysates from the human erythroleukemia cell line K562. Immunoprecipitation with an α-MLH1 antibody, but not nonspecific IgG, immunoprecipitated BLM (Fig.3 A). Conversely, immunoprecipitation with α-BLM antibody demonstrated that MLH1 is associated with BLM (Fig 3 B). As a positive control, BLM was immunoprecipitated with α-BLM and probed for the replication protein A (RPA) 70-kDa subunit, a known protein partner of the BLM helicase (14Brosh J. Li J.L. Kenny M.K.

RPA was detected in the α-BLM immunoprecipitation but not in the IgG control immunoprecipitates (Fig. 3 C)."

Microsomal P450 is co-translationally inserted in the ER membrane through a non-cleavable N-terminal hydrophobic signal sequence (6Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. Sato R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3361-3364Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial P450 forms, such as P450scc (P450 11A1), P450 11β (P450 11B1), and P450c27 (P450 27A1) contain cleavable N-terminal amphipathic presequences that are important for the post-translational targeting of the precursor protein to mitochondria (7Omura T. Ito A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 206: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).Recently we demonstrated that, in rat liver and brain, β-naphthoflavone-inducible P450 1A1 and phenobarbital-inducible P450 2B1, both known to be bona fide microsomal forms, are also targeted to mitochondria (8Addya S.

The mitochondrial targeted P450 forms were referred to as P450 MT2 and P450 MT4, respectively. These studies described a new concept of chimeric N-terminal signal that was responsible for targeting both of these proteins to two distinct cytoplasmic organelles. In the case of P450 1A1, processing past the 4th or the 32nd amino acid residue by a cytosolic endoprotease resulted in the activation of a cryptic mitochondrial targeting signal at amino acid sequence 33–44, which directed the truncated proteins (P450 MT2) to mitochondria (8Addya S.

In the case of P450 2B1 (P450 MT4), protein with an intact N-terminal end was targeted to mitochondria, although PKA-dependent phosphorylation at Ser128 was essential for mitochondrial targeting (9Anandatheerthavarada H.K.

We postulated that a conformational shift induced by Ser128phosphorylation helped expose a cryptic mitochondrial targeting signal at amino acid sequence 21–36 of the protein. Thus, the two mechanisms have a common theme in that both require the activation of chimeric N-terminal signals for mitochondrial targeting (8Addya S. Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Biswas G. Bhagwat S.V.

Furthermore, it is readily induced by acute and chronic alcohol ingestion, and the enzyme is known to actively metabolize alcohol and acetaldehyde. Additionally, the enzyme efficiently catalyzes the metabolism of a wide spectrum of low molecular weight hydrophobic compounds, including carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, and vinylidene chloride in addition to chemical additives of toxicological and carcinogenic significance (13Koop D.R. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 724-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Thus, P450 2E1 induction may underlie the increased risks of exposure to such industrial and environmental chemicals. It is well established that P450 2E1 causes oxidative stress through the production of reactive oxygen species in vivo (14Sakarai K. Cederbaum A.I. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 1024-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and in vitro (15Fataccioli V. Andraud E. Gentil M. French S.W. Rouach H. Hepatology. 1999; 29: 14-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). However, the role of mitochondrial targeted P450 2E1 in oxidative stress remains unknown.P450 2E1, alternately designated as P450 MT5, has been shown to be present in rat liver mitochondria as a membrane extrinsic protein with an apparent molecular mass similar to or slightly smaller (1–2 kDa) than the 52-kDa size reported for the microsomal form (2Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Addya S. Dwivedi R.S. Biswas G. Mullick J. Avadhani N.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 339: 136-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In contrast, a soluble 40-kDa, putative N-terminal truncated form of P450 2E1 was recently shown to be localized in mitochondria of cells overexpressing P450 2E1, lacking the N-terminal 29 amino acid residues (16Neve E.P.A. Ingelman-Sundberg M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). A protein of similar size cross-reacting with antibody to P450 2E1 was also detected in mitochondria of uninduced rat livers (16Neve E.P.A. Ingelman-Sundberg M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In the present study, we purified P450 2E1 from hepatic mitochondria of pyrazole-treated rats and characterized its molecular properties and enzyme activity. Our results show that mitochondrially targeted P450 2E1 has an intact N terminus and that it is phosphorylated at higher level as compared with the microsomal counterpart. Enzyme reconstitution experiments show that the activity of the mitochondrial enzyme is supported preferentially by the Adx+Adr electron transport system, and very poorly by the microsomal CPR system, suggesting a possible conformational shift, which alters its ability to bind to different electron transfer proteins.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have used a combination of protein purification, enzyme reconstitution, and protein biochemistry for characterizing the molecular and enzymatic properties of rat liver mitochondrial P450 2E1. Our results demonstrate that N-terminally intact P450 2E1 is targeted to mitochondria. The immunoblot analysis of P450 from crude membrane fractions, as well as purified proteins, suggest that the mitochondrial P450 2E1 is phosphorylated at a significantly higher level as compared with the microsomal counterpart. These results are further supported by MALDI-TOF analysis of gel-purified proteins (Fig. 5). The latter results show the occurrence of a protease fingerprint product of 914.55 mass, representing the Ser129 phosphorylated fragment only with the mitochondrial purified enzyme but not the microsomal enzyme. These results suggest that similar to that shown for P4502B1 (P450 MT4), intact Ser129 phosphorylated P450 2E1 (P450 MT5) is targeted to mitochondria. Despite an extensive analysis, we failed to detect the putative 40-kDa N-terminal cleaved product (16Neve E.P.A. Ingelman-Sundberg M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) either in intact mitoplasts (Fig. 1) or as part of purified P450 2E1 (Fig.3 A). Recent results 2M. A. Robin, H. Anandatheerthavarada, and N. Avadhani, unpublished results. on the in vivo protein targeting by cell transfection and in vitro mitochondrial import showed that the full length P450 2E1 with an intact N terminus is targeted to mitochondria. Furthermore, as suggested previously, the mitochondrial imported P450 2E1 is a membrane extrinsic protein based on its solubility in alkaline Na2CO3 (2Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Addya S. Dwivedi R.S. Biswas G. Mullick J. Avadhani N.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 339: 136-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 37Von Wachenfeldt C. Johnson E. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Cytochrome P450: Structure, Mechanisms and Biochemistry. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1995: 183-224Crossref Google Scholar).Recent studies from our laboratory demonstrated that mitochondrial targeted P450 MT2 (+33/1A1) and P450 MT4 (phosphorylated P450 2B1) interact in a functionally productive manner with mitochondrial specific electron donor proteins Adx+Adr (9Anandatheerthavarada H.K.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2394-2403Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), while retaining their ability to interact with the microsomal electron donor protein, CPR. Since the microsome-associated P450 1A1 and 2B1 showed preference for CPR as an electron donor, we hypothesized that N-terminal truncation, in the case of mitochondrial imported P450 MT2, and Ser128 phosphorylation in the case of mitochondrial P450 2B1, may induce conformational changes that allow interaction with soluble electron donor proteins. In many respects, the mitochondrial imported P450 2E1 (P450 MT5) described in this study resembles the similarly located P450 2B1 with a subtle difference. Reconstitution experiments show the exclusive requirement of mitochondrial imported P450 2E1 for Adx+Adr. These results suggest a notable structural or conformational difference between P450 molecules associated with the microsomal and mitochondrial membrane compartments. As reported before for P450 2B1 (9Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Biswas G. Mullick J. Sepuri N.B.V. Otvos L. Pain D. Avadhani N.G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5494-5504Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), immunoblot analysis with anti-Ser-phosphate antibody shows higher level of phosphorylation with mitochondrial P450 2E1 as compared with the microsomal form. Preliminary results also show that, similar to that reported for P450 2B1 (9Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Biswas G. Mullick J. Sepuri N.B.V. Otvos L. Pain D. Avadhani N.G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5494-5504Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), Ser129phosphorylation is critical for mitochondrial targeting of protein, suggesting that it may serve to activate the cryptic mitochondrial targeting signal of P450 2E1 apoprotein. MALDI-TOF analysis, however, suggests that only approximately 20–25% of the mitochondrial P450 2E1 pool may be phosphorylated at Ser129. These latter results suggest that mitochondrial P450 forms are subject to regulation by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. This possibility is consistent with increasing evidence that other mitochondrial proteins, such as those associated with electron transport complexes, are subject to modulation by cAMP- dependent PKA (9Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Biswas G. Mullick J. Sepuri N.B.V. Otvos L. Pain D. Avadhani N.G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5494-5504Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 38Francis S.H. Corbi J.D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 237-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar) and protein phosphatases (39Ruvulo P.P. Deng X. Ito T. Carr B.K. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20296-20300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar).It is noteworthy that P450 2E1 proteins purified from the two membrane compartments show markedly different α-helical contents (Fig. 8). In our previous study with mitochondrial P450 2B1, we rationalized that phosphorylation might be an important contributing factor in the manifestation of structural differences, as revealed by CD spectral studies (9Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Biswas G. Mullick J. Sepuri N.B.V. Otvos L. Pain D. Avadhani N.G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5494-5504Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), and binding to Adx (results not shown). Since the phosphorylated species comprise only approximately 20–25% of the mitochondrial P450 2E1 pool, additional possibilities are likely to account for this difference. The mode of mitochondrial entry of the apoprotein through the N-terminal end, and its first encounter with mitochondrial import proteins, such as HSP70 (40Glick B.S. Cell. 1995; 80: 11-14Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) may some how direct the protein to assemble in a membrane extrinsic orientation, differently from the signal recognition particle-directed membrane targeting and membrane insertion processes in the ER compartment. It is also likely that the P450 protein is folded differently in the mitochondrial compartment because of possible differences in the protein folding machinery or chaperones. It is known that a single amino acid substitution in the chaperone component of the subtilisin E causes subtle changes in the folding of its protease domain, suggesting that the same polypeptide can be folded in different manner (41Shinde U.P. Liu J.J. Inouye M. Nature. 1997; 389: 520-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Ser129 may be an important contributing factor in this process. Additional experiments are needed to understand the molecular and cellular processes leading to the formation of P450 2E1 with subtly different structure or conformation.A recent study using physical and genetic mapping of electron donor protein binding sites on P450 MT2 and structural modeling of this P450 showed that both Adx and CPR bind to the putative G helix, but subtly through different contact points. Notably, both Adx and CPR bound to the same helix at 90° orientation to each other in a non-overlapping fashion (33Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Amuthan G. Biswas G. Robin M.A. Murali R. Waterman M.R. Avadhani N.G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2394-2403Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In the present study, the MT2 peptide representing the P450 site for binding to two different electron donor proteins inhibited both the Adx supported and CPR supported enzyme activities. These results suggest that a homologous P450 2E1 region is involved in binding to these two evolutionarily divergent electron donor proteins. Although not shown, a polar amino acid-rich, aqueous accessible helix G, spanning sequence 231–244 and containing 4 positively charged amino acids, is also conserved in P450 2E1 (see Fig. 7 C). We postulate that the conserved G-helix of P450 2E1 is involved in binding to the electron donor proteins, possibly involving Arg233, Lys234, and Lys237 as the direct contact points. In subtle variation from the P450 MT2 model, in vitro reconstitution of purified enzymes suggests that the binding to the two electron donor proteins, Adx and CPR, is exclusive of each other. Currently, reasons for the observed preference of the microsomal P450 2E1 for binding to CPR and the mitochondrial form for binding to Adx remain unclear, although different conformations of the putative G helix in enzymes from two different membrane sources is a likely possibility.In summary, here we demonstrate that the P450 2E1 associated with the mitochondrial membrane compartment is identical to the microsomal P450 2E1, except that the former is phosphorylated at a higher level. The results of this study also support our previous observations with P450 MT2 and P450 MT4, and provide additional evidence for the occurrence of multiple mechanisms for the activation of chimeric N-terminal signal for the mitochondrial targeting of xenobiotic inducible P450 forms. Cytochromes P450 (P450s)1 belong to a superfamily of heme proteins, which catalyze the oxidation of exogenous as well as endogenous compounds. P450 proteins are located in different compartments of the cell. In addition to their localization in the endoplasmic reticulum, also referred as microsomes, a number of different forms have been detected in mitochondria (1Niranjan B.G. Wilson N.M. Jekcoate C.R.

Ther. 2000; 294: 1063-1069PubMed Google Scholar). Targeting of P450 proteins to ER and mitochondria require different types of signals. Microsomal P450 is co-translationally inserted in the ER membrane through a non-cleavable N-terminal hydrophobic signal sequence (6Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. Sato R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3361-3364Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial P450 forms, such as P450scc (P450 11A1), P450 11β (P450 11B1), and P450c27 (P450 27A1) contain cleavable N-terminal amphipathic presequences that are important for the post-translational targeting of the precursor protein to mitochondria (7Omura T. Ito A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 206: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Recently we demonstrated that, in rat liver and brain, β-naphthoflavone-inducible P450 1A1 and phenobarbital-inducible P450 2B1, both known to be bona fide microsomal forms, are also targeted to mitochondria (8Addya S. Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Biswas G. Bhagwat S.V. Mullick J. Avadhani N.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 589-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 9Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Biswas G. Mullick J.

The mitochondrial targeted P450 forms were referred to as P450 MT2 and P450 MT4, respectively. These studies described a new concept of chimeric N-terminal signal that was responsible for targeting both of these proteins to two distinct cytoplasmic organelles. In the case of P450 1A1, processing past the 4th or the 32nd amino acid residue by a cytosolic endoprotease resulted in the activation of a cryptic mitochondrial targeting signal at amino acid sequence 33–44, which directed the truncated proteins (P450 MT2) to mitochondria (8Addya S.

In the case of P450 2B1 (P450 MT4), protein with an intact N-terminal end was targeted to mitochondria, although PKA-dependent phosphorylation at Ser128 was essential for mitochondrial targeting (9Anandatheerthavarada H.K.

We postulated that a conformational shift induced by Ser128phosphorylation helped expose a cryptic mitochondrial targeting signal at amino acid sequence 21–36 of the protein. Thus, the two mechanisms have a common theme in that both require the activation of chimeric N-terminal signals for mitochondrial targeting (8Addya S. Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Biswas G. Bhagwat S.V.

P450 2E1 has been implicated to have important roles in human health, as its activity is affected by pathophysiological conditions such as diabetes, starvation, and obesity (12Tanaka E. Terada M. Misawa S. J. Clin. Pharmacol. Ther. 2000; 25: 165-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it is readily induced by acute and chronic alcohol ingestion, and the enzyme is known to actively metabolize alcohol and acetaldehyde. Additionally, the enzyme efficiently catalyzes the metabolism of a wide spectrum of low molecular weight hydrophobic compounds, including carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, and vinylidene chloride in addition to chemical additives of toxicological and carcinogenic significance (13Koop D.R. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 724-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Thus, P450 2E1 induction may underlie the increased risks of exposure to such industrial and environmental chemicals.

Additional experiments are needed to understand the molecular and cellular processes leading to the formation of P450 2E1 with subtly different structure or conformation.A recent study using physical and genetic mapping of electron donor protein binding sites on P450 MT2 and structural modeling of this P450 showed that both Adx and CPR bind to the putative G helix, but subtly through different contact points. Notably, both Adx and CPR bound to the same helix at 90° orientation to each other in a non-overlapping fashion (33Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Amuthan G. Biswas G. Robin M.A. Murali R. Waterman M.R. Avadhani N.G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2394-2403Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In the present study, the MT2 peptide representing the P450 site for binding to two different electron donor proteins inhibited both the Adx supported and CPR supported enzyme activities. These results suggest that a homologous P450 2E1 region is involved in binding to these two evolutionarily divergent electron donor proteins. Although not shown, a polar amino acid-rich, aqueous accessible helix G, spanning sequence 231–244 and containing 4 positively charged amino acids, is also conserved in P450 2E1 (see Fig. 7 C). We postulate that the conserved G-helix of P450 2E1 is involved in binding to the electron donor proteins, possibly involving Arg233, Lys234, and Lys237 as the direct contact points. In subtle variation from the P450 MT2 model, in vitro reconstitution of purified enzymes suggests that the binding to the two electron donor proteins, Adx and CPR, is exclusive of each other. Currently, reasons for the observed preference of the microsomal P450 2E1 for binding to CPR and the mitochondrial form for binding to Adx remain unclear, although different conformations of the putative G helix in enzymes from two different membrane sources is a likely possibility.In summary, here we demonstrate that the P450 2E1 associated with the mitochondrial membrane compartment is identical to the microsomal P450 2E1, except that the former is phosphorylated at a higher level. The results of this study also support our previous observations with P450 MT2 and P450 MT4, and provide additional evidence for the occurrence of multiple mechanisms for the activation of chimeric N-terminal signal for the mitochondrial targeting of xenobiotic inducible P450 forms. In this study, we have used a combination of protein purification, enzyme reconstitution, and protein biochemistry for characterizing the molecular and enzymatic properties of rat liver mitochondrial P450 2E1. Our results demonstrate that N-terminally intact P450 2E1 is targeted to mitochondria. The immunoblot analysis of P450 from crude membrane fractions, as well as purified proteins, suggest that the mitochondrial P450 2E1 is phosphorylated at a significantly higher level as compared with the microsomal counterpart. These results are further supported by MALDI-TOF analysis of gel-purified proteins (Fig. 5). The latter results show the occurrence of a protease fingerprint product of 914.55 mass, representing the Ser129 phosphorylated fragment only with the mitochondrial purified enzyme but not the microsomal enzyme. These results suggest that similar to that shown for P4502B1 (P450 MT4), intact Ser129 phosphorylated P450 2E1 (P450 MT5) is targeted to mitochondria. Despite an extensive analysis, we failed to detect the putative 40-kDa N-terminal cleaved product (16Neve E.P.A. Ingelman-Sundberg M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) either in intact mitoplasts (Fig. 1) or as part of purified P450 2E1 (Fig.3 A). Recent results 2M. A. Robin, H. Anandatheerthavarada, and N. Avadhani, unpublished results. on the in vivo protein targeting by cell transfection and in vitro mitochondrial import showed that the full length P450 2E1 with an intact N terminus is targeted to mitochondria. Furthermore, as suggested previously, the mitochondrial imported P450 2E1 is a membrane extrinsic protein based on its solubility in alkaline Na2CO3 (2Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Addya S. Dwivedi R.S. Biswas G. Mullick J. Avadhani N.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 339: 136-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 37Von Wachenfeldt C. Johnson E. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Cytochrome P450: Structure, Mechanisms and Biochemistry. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1995: 183-224Crossref Google Scholar). Recent studies from our laboratory demonstrated that mitochondrial targeted P450 MT2 (+33/1A1) and P450 MT4 (phosphorylated P450 2B1) interact in a functionally productive manner with mitochondrial specific electron donor proteins Adx+Adr (9Anandatheerthavarada H.K.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2394-2403Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), while retaining their ability to interact with the microsomal electron donor protein, CPR. Since the microsome-associated P450 1A1 and 2B1 showed preference for CPR as an electron donor, we hypothesized that N-terminal truncation, in the case of mitochondrial imported P450 MT2, and Ser128 phosphorylation in the case of mitochondrial P450 2B1, may induce conformational changes that allow interaction with soluble electron donor proteins. In many respects, the mitochondrial imported P450 2E1 (P450 MT5) described in this study resembles the similarly located P450 2B1 with a subtle difference. Reconstitution experiments show the exclusive requirement of mitochondrial imported P450 2E1 for Adx+Adr. These results suggest a notable structural or conformational difference between P450 molecules associated with the microsomal and mitochondrial membrane compartments. As reported before for P450 2B1 (9Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Biswas G. Mullick J. Sepuri N.B.V. Otvos L. Pain D. Avadhani N.G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5494-5504Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), immunoblot analysis with anti-Ser-phosphate antibody shows higher level of phosphorylation with mitochondrial P450 2E1 as compared with the microsomal form. Preliminary results also show that, similar to that reported for P450 2B1 (9Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Biswas G. Mullick J. Sepuri N.B.V. Otvos L. Pain D. Avadhani N.G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5494-5504Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), Ser129phosphorylation is critical for mitochondrial targeting of protein, suggesting that it may serve to activate the cryptic mitochondrial targeting signal of P450 2E1 apoprotein. MALDI-TOF analysis, however, suggests that only approximately 20–25% of the mitochondrial P450 2E1 pool may be phosphorylated at Ser129. These latter results suggest that mitochondrial P450 forms are subject to regulation by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. This possibility is consistent with increasing evidence that other mitochondrial proteins, such as those associated with electron transport complexes, are subject to modulation by cAMP- dependent PKA (9Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Biswas G. Mullick J. Sepuri N.B.V. Otvos L. Pain D. Avadhani N.G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5494-5504Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 38Francis S.H. Corbi J.D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 237-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar) and protein phosphatases (39Ruvulo P.P. Deng X. Ito T. Carr B.K. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20296-20300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that P450 2E1 proteins purified from the two membrane compartments show markedly different α-helical contents (Fig. 8). In our previous study with mitochondrial P450 2B1, we rationalized that phosphorylation might be an important contributing factor in the manifestation of structural differences, as revealed by CD spectral studies (9Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Biswas G. Mullick J. Sepuri N.B.V. Otvos L. Pain D. Avadhani N.G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5494-5504Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), and binding to Adx (results not shown). Since the phosphorylated species comprise only approximately 20–25% of the mitochondrial P450 2E1 pool, additional possibilities are likely to account for this difference. The mode of mitochondrial entry of the apoprotein through the N-terminal end, and its first encounter with mitochondrial import proteins, such as HSP70 (40Glick B.S. Cell. 1995; 80: 11-14Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) may some how direct the protein to assemble in a membrane extrinsic orientation, differently from the signal recognition particle-directed membrane targeting and membrane insertion processes in the ER compartment. It is also likely that the P450 protein is folded differently in the mitochondrial compartment because of possible differences in the protein folding machinery or chaperones. It is known that a single amino acid substitution in the chaperone component of the subtilisin E causes subtle changes in the folding of its protease domain, suggesting that the same polypeptide can be folded in different manner (41Shinde U.P. Liu J.J. Inouye M. Nature. 1997; 389: 520-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Ser129 may be an important contributing factor in this process.

https://openalex.org/W1496096031,"Large expansions of GAA·TTC repeats in the first intron of the frataxin (<i>X25</i>) gene are the principal mutation responsible for Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA). Sticky DNA, based on R·R·Y triplexes, was found at the expanded GAA·TTC repeats from FRDA patients. The (GAAGGA·TCCTTC)<sub>65</sub> repeat occurs in the same frataxin locus but is nonpathogenic and does not form sticky DNA. To elucidate the behavior of sticky DNA, we introduced various extents of GGA·TCC interruptions into the long GAA·TTC repeat. More than 20% of GGA·TCC interruptions abolished the formation of sticky DNA. However, the GAA·TTC repeats with less than 11% of GGA·TCC interruptions formed triplexes and/or sticky DNA similar to the uninterrupted repeat sequence. These triplexes showed different P1 nuclease sensitivities, and the GGA·TCC interruptions were slightly more sensitive than the surrounding GAA·TTC repeats. Furthermore, genetic instability investigations in <i>Escherichia coli</i> revealed that a small number (4%) of interruptions substantially stabilized the long GAA·TTC tracts. Furthermore, the greater the extent of interruptions of the GAA·TTC repeats, the less inhibition of <i>in vitro</i>transcription was observed, as expected, based on the capacity of interruptions to inhibit the formation of sticky DNA. We propose that the interruptions introduce base mismatches into the R·R·Y triplex, which explains the observed chemical and biological properties."

PP14, a 162-amino acid glycosylated protein, is secreted by the late secretory phase endometrium during the menstrual cycle (1Julkunen M. Koistinen R. Sjoberg J. Rutanen E.M. Wahlstrom T. Seppala M. Endocrinology. 1986; 118: 1782-1786Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) and has been proposed as a biochemical marker of endometrial function in women (2Check J.H. Vaze M.M. Vetter B. Int. J. Fertil Menopausal Stud. 1993; 38: 34-36PubMed Google Scholar). The gene encoding the protein consists of three putative progesterone/corticosterone response elements (3Vaisse C. Atger M. Potier B. Milgrom E. DNA Cell Biol. 1990; 9: 401-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Consistent with this is the finding that PP14 concentrations in the endometrial tissue, as well as in circulation, are highest in the late luteal phase and lowest in the periovulatory phase of the menstrual cycle (4Julkunen M.

Steril. 1995; 63: 377-383Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) and is associated with endometrial preparation for blastocyst implantation (12Seppala M. Angervo M. Koistinen R.

Reprod. 1998; 13: 3478-3486Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Apart from this, PP14 has been shown to have immunosuppressive properties in that it inhibits both phytohemagglutinin (14Pockley A.G. Bolton A.E. Immunology. 1990; 69: 277-281PubMed Google Scholar) and anti-CD3 antibody-induced lymphocyte proliferation (15Rachmilewitz J. Riely G.J. Tykocinski M.L. Cell.

That the protein is essential for normal pregnancy progression has been established by the association of low levels of PP14 with habitual abortion (17Tomczak S. Briese V. Kunkel S. Muller H. Arch.

Despite the growing literature on the multifunctional role of PP14, the mechanism of action of this protein has not been delineated at the molecular level. Our studies demonstrate that the immunosuppressive effect of PP14 is the result of induction of apoptosis in T cells. The protein also induced apoptosis in the human T cell lines Jurkat and MOLT-4 but not in the monocyte cell line U937. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated using Histopaque (Sigma) from freshly drawn blood of normal healthy donors (male and female; age 25–45 years), according to the method described by Boyum (21Boyum A. Nature. 1964; 204: 793-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Raji, a human B cell line, and Jurkat and MOLT-4, human T cell lines, were obtained from the Cancer Research Institute, Mumbai, India, and U937, a macrophage cell line, was from Dr. Manjunath, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India. All three cell lines were cultured in RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and passaged three times a week. Expression of PP14 in P. pastoris (GS115) has been described elsewhere (22Dutta B. Mukhopadhyay D. Roy N. Das G. Karande A.A. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 14: 327-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). RecombinantP. pastoris (GS115-PP14) supernatant was reverse dialyzed against sucrose and loaded on a preparative Superose-12 fast protein liquid chromatography column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), equilibrated against 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 0.9% NaCl (PBS). 1-ml fractions were collected, and the fractions corresponding to the molecular mass range of ∼45 kDa were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Fractions containing the recombinant protein (Pic-PP14) were pooled, concentrated, dialyzed extensively against RPMI 1640, and finally filter-sterilized using 0.45 µ SPIN-X tubes (Costar). The purity of PP14 was confirmed by silver staining. As negative control, untransformed P. pastoris (GS115) supernatant was used after concentration and subsequent equilibration against RPMI 1640. Amniotic fluid was collected from women undergoing elective abortion at 10–12 weeks of gestation. After dialysis against PBS, amniotic fluid was concentrated 10-fold by reverse dialysis against sucrose and fractionated on a Superose-12 fast protein liquid chromatography column. The presence of PP14 in the fractions was detected by Western blotting with two monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), one, namely B1C2, against PP14 (23Karri S.T. Mukhopadhyay D. Jing L. Karande A.A. Histochem. J. 2001; 32: 711-716Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and the other, B7B10, against bovine β-lactoglobulin cross-reactive with PP14 (24Reddy B.M. Karande A.A. Adiga P.R. Mol. Immunol. 1992; 29: 511-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The peak fractions of PP14 were pooled (AF-PP14), dialyzed against RPMI, and filter-sterilized. The most abundant protein in the amniotic fluid, namely human serum albumin (HSA) was used as the negative control. Treatment with peptide-N-glycosidase F was carried out according to a previously described procedure (25Seppo A. Tienmeyer M. Spector D.L. Goldman R.D. Leinwand L.A. Cells: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1998: 335-337Google Scholar). The protein solution at 2 mg/ml in PBS containing 1% SDS and 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol was boiled for 2 min. Nonidet P-40 was then added so that the ratio of Nonidet P-40 to SDS was 7:1 in the final reaction. The enzyme was added (0.5 milliunits/ml), and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 48 h. To prepare the sample for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the samples were precipitated with equal volumes of 50% trichloroacetic acid containing 10 mm sodium deoxycholate, boiled with sample buffer and electrophoresed on 12.5% polyacrylamide gel under denaturing conditions. The proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane and probed with PP14-specific mAb B1C2 (23Karri S.T. Mukhopadhyay D. Jing L. Karande A.A. Histochem. J. 2001; 32: 711-716Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Inhibition of glycosylation of the recombinant PP14 was carried out using tunicamycin. The GS115-PP14 culture was grown in 100 ml of BMGY medium (2% peptone, 1% yeast extract, 1.25% yeast nitrogen base, 2% glycerol, and 16.5 µm biotin) for 36 h. The cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 2 ml/g cell weight of BMMY medium (BMGY without glycerol supplemented with 0.5% methanol). To one half of the culture, tunicamycin was added at a concentration of 200 µg/ml. The cells were then grown for 120 h at 30 °C with constant agitation at 250 rpm, replenishing the methanol once every 24 h. The cells were then centrifuged, and the supernatant was concentrated and electrophoresed on 12.5% acrylamide gel. The separated proteins were visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue. PBMCs at 0.2 × 106cells/200 µl or cell lines at 0.1 × 106/200 µl in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5% FBS were cultured in the presence or absence of PP14 at varying time interval in 96-well plates (NUNC). Phytohemagglutinin (PHA) at 5 µg/ml or OKT3 hybridoma culture supernatant at a dilution of 1:2500 was used for inducing T-lymphocyte proliferation. At the end of the time interval, as indicated in the figure legends, 1 × 105 cpm of 3H-thymidine (methyl T; Bhabha Atomic Research Center, Mumbai, India) was added to the cultures and incubated for 12 h in the case of lymphocytes and 6 h in the case of the cell lines. The cells were harvested on glass fiber paper (Whatman) using a cell harvester (NUNC). The filters were dried, and radioactivity was measured in a scintillation counter (Wallac). All treatments were carried out in triplicate. Depletion of monocytes was carried out by incubating the isolated PBMCs for 2 h at 37 °C, in FBS-coated plastic Petri dishes, in RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS. Non-adherent cells were collected for proliferation studies. DNA fragmentation assay was carried out as described earlier (26Gong J. Traganos F. Darzynkiewicz Z. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 218: 314-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar) for the cell lines. 1–2 × 106 cells at different time intervals after treatment with PP14 or untreated cells were collected by centrifugation and suspended in 100 µl of PBS. 1 ml of ice-cold 70% ethanol was added to cells and kept on ice for 30 min (or −20 °C for 16 h). The cells were centrifuged at 800 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and ethanol was removed completely, suspended in 40 µl of 0.1m citrate phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, and kept at room temperature for 30 min with occasional shaking. The cells were then centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was concentrated. To this, 10 µl of 0.25% Nonidet P-40 and 3 µg of RNase A were added and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. After addition of 3 µg of proteinase K the incubation was continued for 30 min. 10 µl of loading buffer (0.25% bromphenol blue, 0.25% xylene cyanol in 30% glycerol in water) was added to the mixture and electrophoresed on an 0.8% agarose gel at 2 V/cm for 10 h. The gel was then stained with ethidium bromide (5 µg/ml) for 15 min, destained in water for 5 min, and visualized under a UV transilluminator. The genomic DNA was isolated from 1–2 × 106 lymphocytes by the procedure described earlier (27Kroemer G. Bosca L. Zamzami N. Marchetti P. Hortelano S. Martinez A.C. Lefkovits I. Immunology Methods Manual: The Comprehensive Sourcebook of Techniques. Academic Press, London1997: 1121-1122Google Scholar). The cells were lysed in 20 µl of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.0, containing 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS, 500 ng of proteinase K and incubated for 1 h at 50 °C and then for 10 min at 70 °C. To this, 1 µg of RNase A was added and incubated for another hour at 37 °C. The contents of the tube were then loaded on an agarose gel as described above. Cells (1 × 106), either untreated or after treatment with PP14, were centrifuged at 300 ×g for 5 min at room temperature and resuspended in 100 µl of PBS. 1 ml of ice-cold 70% ethanol was added to the cells and kept on ice for 30 min (or at −20 °C for 1 week). The cells were thawed on ice and centrifuged at 800 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. After washing once with PBS, 500 µl of staining solution of propidium iodide at 50 µg/ml of PBS, containing 0.1 mg/ml of RNase A, 1% Triton X-100, and 40 mm of sodium citrate, was added to the cells and incubated for 1 h. Analysis was carried out by fluorescence-activated flow cytometer (FACScan; Beckton Dickinson). Samples were electrophoresed at 30 mA of constant current on a 12.5% polyacrylamide gel. The separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane at 125 mA of constant current using a semi-dry transfer apparatus (Bio-Rad) for 1.5 h. After blocking the unbound sites with 0.5% gelatin in PBS, the membranes were incubated with the primary antibody for 1 h and washed 3 times with high salt wash buffer (1 m NaCl in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 0.05% Triton X-100 and 0.2% EDTA) and 3 times with low salt wash buffer (50 mm NaCl in 50 mm phosphate buffer, containing 0.05% Triton X-100 and 0.2% EDTA). Further incubation was carried out with appropriately diluted rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Dako) for 1 h. Binding of the antibodies was visualized with the enzyme substrate 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (Sigma) at 1 mg/ml in 100 mm citrate phosphate buffer, pH 5.5, containing 0.03% H2O2 or with an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To measure PP14 concentrations in the amniotic fluid fractions obtained on gel filtration, known concentrations of purified recombinant PP14 were electrophoresed, along with the amniotic fluid fraction, and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane followed by Western blot analysis with the monoclonal antibody B1C2 raised to PP14 (23Karri S.T. Mukhopadhyay D. Jing L. Karande A.A. Histochem. J. 2001; 32: 711-716Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Intensities of the chemiluminescence signals as determined by densitometric analysis using Fuji Quant software were plotted against varying concentrations of the recombinant PP14. The amount of PP14 was found to be 80 µg/ml. Cells were cultured in the presence or absence of PP14. At different time intervals, aliquots of the cell culture were centrifuged at 300 ×g for 5 min at room temperature and resuspended in 25 µl of spent medium, to which 1 µl of dye mix (100 µg/ml AcOr + 100 µg/ml EtBr in PBS) was added. The cells were visualized under a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss), using a blue filter. The assay was carried out as per the manufacturer's instructions (Becton Dickinson). 1–2 × 106 cells were treated with PP14 at different time intervals, washed with PBS, and lysed in buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mmNaH2PO4/NaH2PO4, pH 7.5), 130 mm NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100). 100 µl of the cell lysate was added to 1 ml of reaction buffer (1.4 mNaCl, 27 mm KCl, 100 mmKH2PO4/K2HPO4, pH 7.5) containing 100 ng of the fluorogenic substrate, Ac-DEVD-AMC, and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Fluorescence was measured with excitation at 380 nm and emission at 420–460 nm. For establishing specificity of each reaction, 10 ng of the inhibitor, Ac-DEVD-CHO, was also included, along with the substrate. PP14 has 17.5% carbohydrates (28Bohn, H., Kraus, W., and Winckler, W. (1982) in Immunology of Human Placental Proteins (Klopper, A., ed) Suppl. 4, pp. 67–81, Praeger Publications, New York.Google Scholar). The apparent molecular mass of the monomeric PP14 from AF was ∼28 kDa as has been reported earlier (29Huhtala M.L. Seppala M. Narvanen A. Palomaki P. Julkunen M. Bohn H. Endocrinology. 1987; 120: 2620-2622Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), which on treatment with peptide-N-glycosidase exhibited a molecular mass of ∼18 kDa, representing the deglycosylated form (Fig.1A). The apparent molecular mass of the P. pastoris-expressed PP14 was ∼20 kDa, which on inhibition of glycosylation decreased to ∼14 kDa (Fig.1 B). The lower band of molecular mass ∼16 kDa also corresponded to PP14 as shown by N-terminal amino acid sequencing (22Dutta B. Mukhopadhyay D. Roy N. Das G. Karande A.A. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 14: 327-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), the lower mobility presumably being because of an acid labile cleavable site at the C terminus of the recombinant protein. mAbs raised in our laboratory to the recombinant, as well as the AF PP14, recognized both forms of the protein, showing that the two are very similar (23Karri S.T. Mukhopadhyay D. Jing L. Karande A.A. Histochem. J. 2001; 32: 711-716Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The concentrations of PHA and anti-CD3 mAb OKT3 that induced maximal proliferation of PBMCs were determined, and these were utilized for all lymphocyte proliferation assays. Pic-PP14 (Fig.2A) and AF-PP14 (Fig.2 B) inhibited the proliferation of human T cells of the PBMCs induced by the anti-CD3 mAb in a dose-dependent manner. Although 50% inhibition of proliferation was brought about by 131 nm Pic-PP14, for the inhibition to the same extent, 65 nm AF-PP14 was required. Neither the P. pastoris(GS115) culture supernatant nor HSA showed any inhibitory effect (Fig. 2). PHA-induced proliferation was also inhibited by both the forms of PP14 (data not shown). Whether peripheral blood monocytes play any role in the observed inhibition of T cell proliferation was investigated by depleting the PBMCs of the monocytic population. Pic-PP14 had the same inhibitory effect on T cells of PBMCs cultured in the absence or presence of monocytes (Fig. 2 C). With the ultimate aim of delineating the inhibitory effect of PP14 at the molecular level, we chose the human cell lines Jurkat U937 and Raji as representatives of human T, monocyte, and B cell lineages, respectively. The cells were cultured in the presence of varying concentrations of PP14, and the incorporation of3H-thymidine was measured. Data presented in Fig. 2show that proliferation of Jurkat cells was inhibited by both the proteins in a dose-dependent manner. The concentration of both forms of PP14 required for 50% inhibition of proliferation of Jurkat cells were comparable, 37 nm of the AF-PP14 and 35 nm of the recombinant PP14. No inhibition was seen with either HSA or the P. pastoris (GS115) supernatant. Proliferation of the U937 cells was also inhibited. AF-PP14 at 40 nm and Pic-PP14 at 67 nm brought about 50% reduction in proliferation. However neither of the two protein preparations inhibited the proliferation of Raji cells (data not shown). To answer the question of whether the inhibitory effect of PP14 is irreversible, Jurkat and U937 cells were incubated with PP14 for 3 or 6 h, after which the cells were washed free of the protein, followed by pulsing with 3H-thymidine at the end of 24 h. No difference was found between cells incubated with PP14 only for 3 or 6 h when compared with those that were cultured in the presence of the protein throughout the culture period (data not shown). Cells cultured with either Pic-PP14 or AF-PP14 were stained with PI and subjected to FACS analysis. All treated cells showed DNA loss as indicated by the pre-G0/G1 peak. In the case of lymphocytes, 14% of the cell population was apoptotic after treatment with Pic-PP14 as compared with untreated cells, which showed only 4% apoptosis (see Fig. 4A). The apoptotic population in the Jurkat cell line increased to 69% on culturing with AF-PP14 and to 72% with Pic-PP14 (see Fig. 4 B). Untreated MOLT-4 cells had a higher population of apoptotic cells (29%) after a 24-h culture, and on culturing with AF-PP14 and Pic-PP14 this population increased to 95 and 98%, respectively (see Fig. 4 B). Neither of the two forms of PP14 induced apoptosis in U937 cells when cultured with PP14 for 24 h (see Fig. 4 B). No DNA loss was observed in cells either untreated or treated with HSA/GS115 supernatant (see Fig.4 B). Though DNA fragmentation was observed in PBMCs, Jurkat, and MOLT-4 cells after culturing with both forms of PP14 (see Fig. 5), DNA ladders were prominent only in the case of the MOLT-4 cells (see Fig. 5, lanes 8 and 9). Importantly, no DNA fragmentation either as ladder or smear was observed in the U937 cells with or without treatment with PP14 (see Fig. 5, lanes 10–12) or the other cells either untreated or treated with control proteins. Morphological observations of apoptosis was carried out by dual staining of the cells with EtBr and AcOr after culturing with PP14 for 0, 6, 12, and 18 h. None of the cells exhibited any morphological changes up to 6 h. On culturing with PP14, MOLT-4 cells showed maximum apoptosis at 18 h, and Jurkat cells showed it at 24 h. At 24 h, more than 95% of MOLT-4 cells were seen to be in the late apoptotic stage. Fig. 6depicts the 18-h time interval for all of the cell lines. As can be observed from this figure, whereas U937 cells did not show any change on treatment with the two proteins, Jurkat, as well as MOLT-4, exhibited chromatin condensation that is very typical of apoptosis. To identify the protease species responsible for PP14-induced apoptosis, the cleavage of the fluorogenic substrate, Ac-DEVD-AMC for caspase-3 protease, was examined by spectrofluorimetry. The cleavage activity for the substrate was marginal in the lysates of cells either untreated or treated with control substances as indicated by low fluorescence emission values (see Fig. 7, panel a). However, there was a significant increase in the fluorescence emission with the lysates of Jurkat and MOLT-4 cells after culturing with AF-PP14 (see Fig. 7, panel b) and Pic-PP14 (see Fig. 7,panel c) at concentrations that inhibited the cell proliferation more than 50%. This activity could be completely inhibited by the specific peptide Ac-DEVD-CHO establishing the specificity of the substrate for the caspase 3 enzyme. The U937 cells showed no increase in caspase 3 activity either in the presence (see Fig. 7, panels b and c) or absence (see Fig. 7,panel a) of PP14. Though the biological role of PP14 has not been elucidated at the molecular level, the protein is known to be associated with several functions, viz. immunosuppression (14Pockley A.G. Bolton A.E. Immunology. 1990; 69: 277-281PubMed Google Scholar, 15Rachmilewitz J. Riely G.J. Tykocinski M.L. Cell. Immunol. 1999; 191: 26-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 16Okamoto N. Uchida A.

Narvanen A. Palomaki P. Julkunen M. Bohn H. Endocrinology. 1987; 120: 2620-2622Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and inhibition of sperm-zona interaction (11Oehninger S. Coddington C.C. Hodgen G.D. Seppala M. Fertil. Steril. 1995; 63: 377-383Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The fetal allograft survives maternal rejection during normal pregnancy, but an allograft at sites other than the uterus is rejected efficiently by the maternal immune system. Therefore, studies on immunological events at the feto-maternal interface have been the major focus for researchers in this area. Experimental observations suggest that endometrial PP14 is involved in the down-regulation of the maternal immune response to foreign fetal antigens. It has been postulated that PP14 action is through immunosuppression, which is essential for protection of the embryo from the immune response of the mother (30Bolton A.E. Pockley A.G. Clough K.J. Mowles E.A. Stoker R.J. Westwood O.M. Chapman M.G. Lancet. 1987; 1: 593-595Abstract PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In this context, PP14 has been shown to inhibit the proliferation of peripheral blood lymphocytes induced by the mitogen PHA (14Pockley A.G. Bolton A.E. Immunology. 1990; 69: 277-281PubMed Google Scholar) and by cross-linking of CD3 receptors by specific antibody (15Rachmilewitz J. Riely G.J. Tykocinski M.L. Cell. Immunol. 1999; 191: 26-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated earlier that Pic-PP14 (22Dutta B. Mukhopadhyay D. Roy N. Das G. Karande A.A. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 14: 327-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) exhibited an inhibition of sperm-ovum interaction 2Dutta, B., Ain, R., Seshagiri, P. B., and Karande, A. A. (2001) Reprod. Fertil. Dev., in press. as has been reported in case of AF-PP14 (11Oehninger S. Coddington C.C. Hodgen G.D. Seppala M. Fertil. Steril. 1995; 63: 377-383Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). To demonstrate whether Pic-PP14 could also exhibit the immunosuppressive activity of the native PP14, we tested both proteins for their effect on lymphocyte proliferation. Pic-PP14 inhibited proliferation of human PBMCs triggered by the OKT3 mAb (as also by PHA) in a dose-dependent manner showing that the recombinant protein is comparable with the AF-PP14 in its activity. Depletion of the monocytes from PBMCs did not abrogate the PP14-mediated inhibitory effect on T cells (Fig. 2 C) indicating that PP14 exerts this effect directly on T cells. The proliferation studies were then extended to human cell lines, namely, Jurkat, which is a T cell line, Raji, a B cell line, and U937, which is of monocyte origin. PP14 inhibited proliferation of Jurkat and U937 cells (Fig. 3) but not Raji cells. Because cell lines are homogeneous populations, these observations confirmed that the inhibitory effect of PP14 is direct on T cells, as well as monocytes. All the above studies were carried out to establish the potential of the recombinant Pic-PP14 comparable with that of the AF-PP14. Further studies were then initiated to look into the molecular events that are triggered by PP14. The first experiment in this direction was to determine whether PP14 action was reversible. The studies provided conclusive evidence that the direct effect on both cell types was irreversible indicating that the signal could be triggered through specific receptors. A cell surface-associated binding protein for PP14 has been reported earlier for the human monocytes (31Miller R.E. Fayen J.D. Chakraborty S. Weber M.C. Tykocinski M.L. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 455-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) but not on T cells. To explore the antiproliferative effect of PP14 further, PI staining studies were initiated to determine whether PP14 blocks any stage of the cell cycle, leading to a state of anergy. The appearance of the pre G0/G1 cell population in PBMCs after treatment with PP14 indicated that PP14 induces apoptosis. The studies were then extended to Jurkat and U937 and another T cell line, namely MOLT-4 (Fig. 4). Interestingly, whereas PP14 induced apoptosis in both the T cell lines, this effect was not seen in U937, even though the protein inhibited U937 cell proliferation (Fig.3 B). The inhibition of proliferation in U937 cells therefore appears to be induced by a pathway different from that in the T cells in PBMCs, as well as the T cell lines. That AF-PP14, as well as Pic-PP14, had an apoptotic effect on T cells was further confirmed by DNA fragmentation studies (Fig. 5) and EtBr/AcOr staining (Fig. 6). The final confirmation came from our studies on measuring the increase in caspase 3 enzyme levels induced in T cells on culturing with PP14. Caspase 3, a member of the caspase subfamily, is a crucial mediator of apoptosis in many mammalian cells. Our data show that this protease is responsible for PP14-induced apoptosis. That this activity was inhibited by the specific inhibitor Ac-DEVD-CHO (32Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V.M. Nordstrom P.A. Roy S.

That the arrest in the proliferation of U937 cells by PP14 is not because of apoptosis was borne out once again by the results of the caspase 3 assay (Fig.7C). Lymphocytes appear in the decidua of the first trimester of pregnancy and disappear toward the third trimester (34Bulmer J.N. Johnson P.M. Bulmer D. Gill III, T.J. Wegmann T.G. Immunoregulation and Fetal Survival. 1st Ed. Oxford University Press, NY1987: 111-134Google Scholar). Those cells that recognize non-self paternal antigens of the trophoblast would need to be deleted from the local environment, should the embryo survive. Death by apoptosis would be the preferred choice as apoptotic cells are quickly phagocytosed by macrophages via a receptor-mediated process (35Fadok V.A. Bratton D.L. Rose D.M. Pearson A. Ezekewitz R.A. Henson P.M. Nature. 2000; 405: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1238) Google Scholar) ensuring that there is no release of intracellular contents (containing inflammatory components) in the surrounding tissue, which would prove to be harmful to the developing fetus. PP14 is probably one of the many factors required for destroying activated T cells to abrogate the deleterious maternal response to paternal antigens.

https://openalex.org/W1507924380,"The Tax transforming protein encoded by human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV1) persistently activates transcription factor NF-κB and deregulates the expression of downstream genes that mediate cell cycle entry. We recently found that Tax binds to and chronically stimulates the catalytic function of IκB kinase (IKK), a cellular enzyme complex that phosphorylates and inactivates the IκB inhibitory subunit of NF-κB. We now demonstrate that the IKKβ catalytic subunit and IKKγ regulatory subunit of IKK are chronically phosphorylated in HTLV1-infected and Tax-transfected cells. Alanine substitutions at Ser-177 and Ser-181 in the T loop of IKKβ protect both of these IKK subunits from Tax-directed phosphorylation and prevent the induction of IκB kinase activity. Each of these inhibitory effects is recapitulated in Tax transfectants expressing the bacterial protein YopJ, a potent in vivo agonist of T loop phosphorylation. Moreover, ectopically expressed forms of IKKβ that contain glutamic acid substitutions at Ser-177 and Ser-181 have the capacity to phosphorylate a recombinant IKKγ substrate in vitro. We conclude that Tax-induced phosphorylation of IKKβ is required for IKKβ activation, phosphoryl group transfer to IKKγ, and acquisition of the deregulated IKK phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W1657662631,"Space-time 'foam' is a geometric picture of the smallest size scales in the Universe, which is characterized mainly by the presence of quantum uncertainties in the measurement of distances. All quantum-gravity theories should predict some kind of foam, but the description of the properties of this foam varies according to the theory, thereby providing a possible means of distinguishing between such theories. I previously showed that foam-induced distance fluctuations would introduce a new source of noise to the measurements of gravity-wave interferometers, but the theories are insufficiently developed to permit detailed predictions that would be of use to experimentalists. Here I propose a phenomenological approach that directly describes space-time foam, and which leads naturally to a picture of distance fluctuations that is independent of the details of the interferometer. The only unknown in the model is the length scale that sets the overall magnitude of the effect, but recent data already rule out the possibility that this length scale could be identified with the 'string length' (10-34 m < Ls < 10-33 m). Length scales even smaller than the 'Planck length' (LP approximately 10-35 m) will soon be probed experimentally."
https://openalex.org/W1965835768,"The Src homology 2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2 play an important role in many intracellular signaling pathways. Both SHP-1 and SHP-2 have been shown to interact with a diverse range of cytosolic and membrane-bound signaling proteins. Generally, SHP-1 and SHP-2 perform opposing roles in signaling processes; SHP-1 acts as a negative regulator of transduction in hemopoietic cells, whereas SHP-2 acts as a positive regulator. Intriguingly, SHP-1 has been proposed to play a positive regulating role in nonhemopoietic cells, although the mechanisms for this are not understood. Here we show that green fluorescent protein-tagged SHP-1 is unexpectedly localized within the nucleus of transfected HEK293 cells. In contrast, the highly related SHP-2 protein is more abundant within the cytoplasm of transfected cells. In accordance with this, endogenous SHP-1 is localized within the nucleus of several other nonhemopoietic cell types, whereas SHP-2 is distributed throughout the cytoplasm. In contrast, SHP-1 is confined to the cytoplasm of hemopoietic cells, with very little nuclear SHP-1 evident. Using chimeric SHP proteins and mutagenesis studies, the nuclear localization signal of SHP-1 was identified within the C-terminal domain of SHP-1 and found to consist of a short cluster of basic amino acids (KRK). Although the KRK motif resembles half of a bipartite nuclear localization signal, it appears to function independently and is absolutely required for nuclear import. Our findings show that SHP-1 and SHP-2 are distinctly localized within nonhemopoietic cells, with the localization of SHP-1 differing dramatically between nonhemopoietic and hemopoietic cell lineages.

Protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs)1 act both as positive and negative regulators of signal transduction (1Neel B.G. Tonks N.K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). Numerous PTPs have been identified so far, including the extensively studied SHP-1 (previously known as PTP1C, SHPTP-1, SHP, and HCP) and SHP-2 (previously termed SHPTP-2, Syp, PTP2C, and PTP1D) intracellular proteins (1Neel B.G.

SHP-1 is expressed at high levels in hemopoietic cells and moderately in many other cell types, especially malignant epithelial cells (4Plutzky J. Neel B.G. Rosenberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Both proteins are structurally very similar, comprising two tandem Src homology 2 domains at the N terminus, a single central catalytic domain, and a C-terminal domain (7Hof P. Pluskey S.

In contrast, SHP-2 plays a positive role in many signaling systems and can act as an adapter protein, linking tyrosine kinases and Grb2 to activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (19Li W.

SHP-1 has a positive effect on mitogenic signaling in several nonhemopoietic cell types, which concurs with its overexpression in certain tumor cells. Overexpression of a catalytically inactive mutant of SHP-1 in HEK293 cells strongly suppresses mitogen-activated pathways and results in decreased cell growth, DNA synthesis, and the transcription of early response genes (21Su L.

Furthermore, transfection of HeLa cells with inactive SHP-1 reduces the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-DNA binding induced by interferon γ and epidermal growth factor (22You M.

As yet, the molecular basis for the apparent opposite effects of SHP-1 in different cell systems has yet to be defined, although the phosphatase domain appears to be critical. It is widely assumed that SHP-1 and SHP-2 are cytoplasmic proteins and have similar intracellular distributions. In this paper we demonstrate a novel nuclear localization for SHP-1 in nonhemopoietic cells, whereas SHP-2 is distributed throughout the cytoplasm. We also show that the nuclear import of SHP-1 is dependent on a short region of basic amino acid residues in the C-terminal domain that resembles half of a bipartite nuclear localization sequence. In addition, we show that SHP-1 localization differs between nonhemopoietic and hemopoietic cells, with the SHP-1 protein being present almost entirely within the cytoplasm of hemopoietic cell lines. These results have implications regarding the function of SHP-1 in nonhemopoietic cells. All cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and maintained at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. HEK293, HeLa, and A549 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg of streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). MCF-7 cells were maintained in the same growth medium supplemented with 10 μg/ml bovine insulin (Sigma). HL-60, U-937, and Jurkat cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg of streptomycin. The day before transfection, 5 × 104 HEK293 cells were seeded per well of a 24-well plate. The medium was exchanged for complete medium lacking antibiotics, and the cells were transfected with 1 μg of plasmid DNA and 1 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 in OptiMEM (Life Technologies) for 6 h according to the manufacturer's instructions. After a change to complete medium, the cells were grown for a further 24 h before processing for microscopy. Green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged SHP-1 and SHP-2 fusion constructs were generated using the strategy of overlapping recombination polymerase chain reaction (23Erlich H.A. PCR Technology. 1st ed. Stockton Press, New York1989Crossref Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Platinum Pfxpolymerase (Life Technologies) was used for all polymerase chain reactions. The SHP-1 coding sequence was amplified using a forward SHP-1 primer containing an XhoI site and a Kozak sequence (5′-ccctcgagcccacatggtgaggtggtttcaccg-3′) and a downstream joining primer (5′-cctcgcccttgctcaccatcttcctcttgagggaaccc-3′). GFP (enhanced GFP; CLONTECH) was amplified using a forward joining primer (5′-gggttccctcaagaggaagatggtgagcaagggcgagg-3′) and a reverse GFP primer containing an XhoI site (5′-ccctcgagttacttgtacagctcgtccat-3′). The two resulting products were mixed, and a secondary polymerase chain reaction was performed using the forward SHP-1 and reverse GFP primers. The product was ligated as an XhoI fragment into the expression vector MSCVpuro (CLONTECH). GFP-tagged SHP-2 was constructed in a similar manner using a forward SHP-2 primer (5′-ccctcgagccaccatgacatcgcggagatggtt-3′), joining primers (5′-cctcgcccttgctcaccattctgaaacttttctgctgttg-3′ and 5′-caacagcagaaaagtttcagaatggtgagcaaggagggcgagg-3′), and a reverse GFP primer. The method of overlapping recombination polymerase chain reaction was used to generate cDNAs encoding chimeric SHP-1/SHP-2 proteins from GFP-tagged SHP-1 and SHP-2 templates. SHP-2/1A, SHP-2/1B, and SHP-2/1C were constructed using the forward SHP-2 primer and reverse GFP primer with joining primers (SHP-2/1A, 5′-gtgcagatcctacctctgaaaggtggtaccatggccacatgtctg-3′ and 5′-catacatgtggccatggtaccacctttcagaggtaggatctgcac-3′; SHP-2/1B, 5′-caaacttctctacagccgaaaagaggggcagcggccagagaacaag-3′ and 5′-cttgttctctggccgctgcccctcttttcggctgtagagaagtttg-3′; and SHP-2/1C, 5′-ctatatggcggtccagcattatattgaaacaactaagaagaagctggaggtcctgcag-3′ and 5′-ctgcaggacctccagcttcttcttagttgtttcaatataatgctggaccgccatatag-3′). SHP-1/2 was constructed using the forward SHP-2 primer and reverse GFP primer with joining primers 5′-catcgcccagttcattgaaaccctacagcgcaggattgaagaag-3′ and cttcttcaatcctgcgctgtagggtttcaatgaactgggcgatg-3′. Each chimeric cDNA was cloned as an XhoI fragment into MSCVpuro. The basic residues in the C-terminal domain of GFP-tagged SHP-1 were mutated to alanines using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Oligonucleotides used were BD1 (5′-cagttcattgaaaccactgcggcggcgctggaggtcctgcagtcg-3′ and 5′-cgactgcaggacctccagcgccgccgcagtggtttcaatgaactg-3′), BD2 (5′-gaacaagagggaggaggcagtggcggcgcagcggtcagcagacaag-3′ and 5′-cttgtctgctgaccgctgcgccgccactgcctcctccctcttgttc-3′), and BD3, (5′gagcaagggttccctcgcggcggcgatggtgagcaagggcg-3′ and 5′cgcccttgctcaccatcgccgccgcgagggaacccttgctc-3′), where underlined nucleotides indicate mismatches. HeLa, A549, and MCF-7 cells were plated onto acid-washed glass coverslips at 50% confluence and incubated overnight. HL-60, U-937, and Jurkat cells were spun onto glass slides at 500 rpm for 5 min using a Cytospin 3 (Shandon). Cells were washed for 5 min in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min. After a further 5-min wash in PBS, cells were incubated in PBS, 10% normal goat serum (NGS), and 0.2% Triton X-100 for 30 min. The cells were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with either anti-SHP1 or anti-SHP2 mouse monoclonal antibodies (Transduction Laboratories) diluted 1:500 (0.5 μg/ml) in PBS and 1% NGS. Cells were washed four times for 5 min in PBS, 10% NGS, and 0.2% Triton X-100 before Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Molecular Probes) was applied at a 1:200 dilution in PBS and 1% NGS for 1 h. After four additional 5-min washes in PBS, 10% NGS, and 0.2% Triton X-100, the cells were immersed briefly in distilled water and mounted in S3023 fluorescent mounting medium (Dako). Transfected HEK293 cells were trypsinized from the tissue culture plate and plated onto eight-well multichamber slides (Lab-Tek, Nunc) at a density of 1000 cells per well. After 24 h, the cells were washed in PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min. After a brief wash in PBS, the cells were mounted in fluorescent mounting medium and coverslipped. Alexa-488 and GFP fluorescence was viewed at 467 nm using an Axiovert 135 microscope (Zeiss) coupled to a monochrome light source (Photonics Polychrome II). A series of optical scans through thez axis of the cells were captured using a Hamamatsu digital camera, and image deconvolution was performed with Openlab software (Improvision). The digitized images were processed using Openlab software on a Power Macintosh G3. A knowledge of the intracellular distribution of nontransmembranal PTPs might give an insight into their cellular function and regulation. Surprisingly, there is a paucity of data on the intracellular localization of SHP-1 and SHP-2. It is widely believed that both SHP-1 and SHP-2 are located within the cytoplasm, presumably because their interactions with tyrosine-phosphorylated, membrane-associated proteins are well documented. The localization of both SHP-1 and SHP-2 was investigated by transiently transfecting HEK293 cells with cDNAs encoding each wild-type SHP protein fused with a C-terminal GFP tag. Unexpectedly, SHP-1 was found to be localized predominantly within the nucleus of all transfected HEK293 cells (Fig.1 A). In contrast, SHP-2 was distributed throughout the cytoplasm of all transfected cells (Fig.1 B), with little nuclear fluorescence evident. GFP protein alone was distributed evenly throughout the cell (Fig. 1 C). This nuclear versus cytoplasmic distribution of overexpressed GFP-tagged SHP-1 and SHP-2 appears to be consistent for a variety of nonhemopoietic cells that have been tested (HeLa, MCF7, A549, primary rat embryo fibroblast, and Chinese hamster ovary cells; data not shown). To exclude the possibility that the observed nuclear localization of SHP-1 was artifactual because of overexpression, the addition of GFP sequence, or both, the localization of endogenous SHP-1 was studied in several nonhemopoietic cell lines. Although SHP-1 is expressed predominantly in hemopoietic lineages, lower levels of expression have been observed in HeLa cervical adenocarcinoma, A549 lung carcinoma, and MCF-7 mammary adenocarcinoma cell lines (4Plutzky J. Neel B.G. Rosenberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1123-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 6Yi T. Cleveland J.L. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 836-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Immunostaining using an SHP-1-specific antibody revealed that endogenous SHP-1 is localized within the nucleus of these three cell types (Fig.2, A–C). This observation demonstrated that neither the overexpression of SHP-1 nor addition of GFP to the C-terminal end of SHP-1 was causing an alteration to its localization. Furthermore, detection of SHP-2 in HeLa cells using an SHP-2-specific antibody confirmed that SHP-2 is localized throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 2 D). These results show that each SHP protein has a distinct cellular distribution, with endogenous SHP-1 being localized within the nuclear compartment of native cells. Next, we wished to address whether SHP-1 localization differs between nonhemopoietic and hemopoietic cells. Previously, SHP-1 has been found to be present in the cytoplasm of HL-60 promyeloblast cells (24Zhao Z. Shen S.-H. Fischer E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5007-5011Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and primary human neutrophils (25Brumell J.H. Chan C.K. Butler J. Borregaard N. Siminovitch K.A. Grinstein S. Downey G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 875-882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Detection of SHP-1 in HL-60, U-937 macrophage, and Jurkat T-cell leukemia cell lines by immunostaining revealed that endogenous SHP-1 is present within the cytoplasm and excluded from the nucleus (Fig. 3). Therefore, SHP-1 localization differs dramatically between the nonhemopoietic and hemopoietic cell lines tested. The maximum size of proteins allowed to passively translocate through the nuclear pore complex is ∼40–50 kDa; larger proteins require an import signal (the nuclear localization signal (NLS)) to be targeted to the nucleus (26Miller M. Park M.K. Hanover J.A. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 909-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Because the SHP-1-GFP fusion protein is ∼93 kDa, active NLS-directed transport across the nuclear membrane must occur. SHP-1 and SHP-2 are closely related proteins and structurally very similar. They have nearly 55% overall sequence identity at the amino acid level, with the tandem Src homology 2 domains and catalytic domain exhibiting the highest level of similarity (Fig. 4 A). To determine the region of SHP-1 responsible for nuclear import, chimeric cDNAs were constructed (Fig. 4 B), each fused with a C-terminal GFP tag. When transiently expressed in HEK293 cells, the three chimeric cDNAs encoding varying lengths of SHP-2 with the C-terminal end of SHP-1 (SHP-2/1-A, SHP-2/1-B, and SHP-2/1-C) were found to be localized predominantly within the nuclei of transfected cells (Fig.5, A–C) and indistinguishable from wild-type SHP-1. This revealed that the C-terminal domain of SHP-1 could replace the analogous region of SHP-2 and could allow the otherwise cytoplasmic SHP-2 molecule to efficiently enter the nucleus. Therefore, it was likely that the C-terminal domain of SHP-1 harbored the signal sequence responsible for nuclear translocation. This was demonstrated by expressing a cDNA encoding SHP-1 with the C-terminal domain replaced by the equivalent region of SHP-2 (SHP-1/2; Fig. 4 B). The resulting protein was unable to enter the nucleus and accumulated within the cytosol of all transfected cells (Fig. 5 D). Thus, the C-terminal domain of SHP-1 is necessary for the nuclear import of SHP-1. Furthermore, the C-terminal domain (amino acids 519–595) linked to GFP (SHP-1C) entered the nucleus of transfected HEK293 cells with high efficiency (Fig.5 E), indicating that the C-terminal domain was sufficient for nuclear import.Figure 5The C-terminal domain of SHP-1 confers nuclear import. The fluorescence localization of GFP-tagged chimeras of SHP-1 and SHP-2 is shown. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with cDNAs encoding chimeric proteins comprising varying lengths of SHP-1 and SHP-2 (see Fig. 4 and “Experimental Procedures”). Chimeric proteins containing regions of SHP-2 with the C-terminal domain of SHP-1 were imported into the nucleus (A–C). A protein consisting of SHP-1 with the C-terminal domain replaced by that of SHP-2 was unable to enter the nucleus and accumulated in the cytoplasm (D). The C-terminal domain of SHP-1 alone was also able to direct GFP into the nucleus with high efficiency (E).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Basic domains are well known to function as NLSs. Analysis of the C-terminal domains of SHP-1 and SHP-2 revealed that several basic regions (BD1, BD2, and BD3) are present within SHP-1 but not in SHP-2 (Fig. 6 A). BD1 (TKKKL) is similar to the NLS of the SV40 T antigen (Fig.6 B). BD2 (KVKK) and BD3 (KRK) together resemble the bipartite NLS of nucleoplasmin, consisting of two short stretches of basic amino acids separated by 10–22 residues (Fig. 6 C). To establish whether these putative NLS domains were responsible for the nuclear import of SHP-1, each domain was removed by mutating the basic residues to alanines. Mutation of BD1 (SHP-1 K520A/K521A/K522A) resulted in a protein that still efficiently entered the nucleus (Fig.7 A). Likewise, mutation of BD2 (SHP-1 K576A/K578A/K579A) resulted in an SHP-1 protein that also entered the nucleus of transfected cells (Fig. 7 B). In contrast, mutation of BD3 (SHP-1 K593A/R594A/K595A) almost completely prevented nuclear import, with the mutated SHP-1 protein accumulating within the cytosol (Fig. 7 C). This distribution resembled that of the SHP-1/2 chimeric protein and indicated that the short KRK sequence constituting BD3 was responsible for nuclear import. Previously, it has been shown that mutations in either the basic cluster of the bipartite NLS of nucleoplasmin have only a partial effect on nuclear transport, with mutations in both clusters required to abolish nuclear transport. On the basis of these criteria, the BD2 and BD3 domains of SHP-1 do not form a bipartite NLS, even though the amino acid sequence resembles bipartite NLS from several nuclear proteins. Mutation of BD3 completely prevents the nuclear import of SHP-1 (Fig. 7 C), whereas a protein lacking both BD2 and BD3 shows a similar distribution (Fig. 7 D). Therefore, unusually, the short KRK motif present at the extreme C-terminal end of SHP-1 is absolutely required and appears solely responsible for nuclear import.Figure 7Mutation analysis of the C-terminal domain of SHP-1. The fluorescence localization of GFP-tagged SHP-1 containing mutations of the three basic domains within the C-terminal domain is shown. Overexpressed SHP-1 lacking BD1 or BD2 remains nuclear (A andB), whereas mutation of BD3 prevents nuclear import (C). The SHP-1 protein containing mutations in both BD2 and BD3 is also excluded from the nucleus (D).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We have shown using GFP fusion proteins that SHP-1 is present predominantly within the nuclear compartment of HEK293 cells, an observation that extends to a variety of transfected nonhemopoietic cells. In contrast, a GFP fusion of the closely related protein SHP-2 is localized throughout the cytoplasm. Immunostaining of SHP-1 in several nonhemopoietic cell types reinforced the experiments performed with GFP-tagged proteins, demonstrating that the distribution of SHP-1 was not influenced by overexpression or the addition of a GFP tag. Endogenous SHP-1 clearly localized to the nucleus of three nonhemopoietic cell lines that are known to express readily detectable amounts of SHP-1. In contrast, endogenous SHP-2 was distributed throughout the cytoplasm in these cell types. Furthermore, the localization of SHP-1 differs dramatically between nonhemopoietic and hemopoietic cells. The HL-60, U-937, and Jurkat cells tested each exhibited SHP-1 staining that was confined within the cytoplasm. Therefore, we have revealed a novel nuclear import of the SHP-1 protein that appears to be restricted to nonhemopoietic cells. The use of chimeric proteins showed that the C-terminal domain of SHP-1 harbors the signal required for the nuclear distribution of SHP-1. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that a short KRK sequence at the extreme end of the C-terminal domain was necessary and sufficient for SHP-1 nuclear import. Mutation of this basic domain prevented the entry of SHP-1 into the nuclear compartment, resulting in the accumulation of SHP-1 in the cytoplasm. Generally, NLSs are either contiguous, as in the case of SV40 large T antigen, or bipartite, as illustrated by nucleoplasmin. In a bipartite NLS, neither basic region can function independently to target proteins to the nucleus. In SHP-1, BD2 (KVKK) and BD3 (KRK) together resemble a bipartite NLS. However, mutation of BD3 appears to completely prevent nuclear import and implies that BD3 acts independently of BD2. Furthermore, mutation of BD2 imparts no observable change to the intracellular distribution of SHP-1. Therefore, the BD2 and BD3 motifs of SHP-1, although resembling a bipartite NLS, do not appear to function in this way. However, it would be extraordinary for a KRK sequence to direct nuclear import alone. It might be that BD2 and BD3 do function synergistically to direct the nuclear import of SHP-1, with BD3 being the more potent half of the partnership. This is not unprecedented; T-cell PTP (TC-PTP) is another example of a PTP that possesses a functional NLS (Fig.6 C), the bipartite nature of which remains controversial. In one investigation, the upstream region of the T-cell PTP NLS appears not to function in nuclear import (27Lorenzen J.A. Dadabay C.Y. Fischer E.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 631-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Yet in a later and more detailed study, both basic regions of the T-cell PTP NLS were shown to be required for efficient nuclear import but with each basic region functioning independently to a limited degree (28Tiganis T. Flint A.J. Adam S.A. Tonks N.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21548-21557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Therefore, it remains undetermined whether the NLS of SHP-1 is truly bipartite, with further investigation necessary. The biological importance of SHP-1 nuclear import is not defined. The clear difference in SHP-1 distribution between hemopoietic and nonhemopoietic cells implies that the trafficking of SHP-1 is under tight regulation in each cell type. In hemopoietic cells, SHP-1 must be exported from the nucleus or the C-terminal NLS must be silenced for SHP-1 to remain in the cytoplasm. This could be brought about by phosphorylation of amino acid residues within close proximity to the NLS or by masking of the NLS by protein-protein interaction. On the other hand, alternative splicing of SHP-1 may remove the region of the gene encoding the NLS. TC-PTP exists as two isoforms generated by differential splicing, one isoform directed to the nucleus and the other directed to the endoplasmic reticulum because of the addition of a stretch of hydrophobic residues (27Lorenzen J.A. Dadabay C.Y. Fischer E.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 631-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Several other PTPs exist in two forms targeted to distinct intracellular locations, including PTPφ/GLEPP-1 (29Pixley F.J. Lee P.S. Dominguez M.G. Einstein D.B. Stanley E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27339-27347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and DPTP61F (30McLauglin S. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6839-6842Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, differential splicing of the SHP-1 gene has recently been reported, which produces the 70 kDa protein SHP-1L, which differs from SHP-1 in its C-terminal structure (31Jin Y.-J., Yu, C.-L. Burakoff S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28301-28307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The SHP-1L splice variant does not possess the BD3 domain shown to direct nuclear import. This raises the question of whether differential splicing of the SHP-1 gene could regulate SHP-1 localization, which in turn could regulate SHP-1 function by directing SHP-1 to target substrates at distinct cellular localities. However, the anti-SHP-1 antibody used in these studies was raised to the C-terminal domain of the protein and will only detect SHP-1 (not SHP-1L); thus the differential localization of endogenous SHP-1 proteins in hemopoietic and nonhemopoietic cells is more likely to be due to silencing of the NLS or enhanced nuclear export. The import of SHP-1 into the nucleus of nonhemopoietic cells may serve as a mechanism by which SHP-1 function is regulated. SHP-1 might be localized within the nucleus to prevent interaction with cytoplasmic signaling molecules or might be directed toward unknown nuclear phosphoproteins. It has been reported that SHP-1 can act as a positive regulator of cell signaling in nonhemopoietic HEK293 and HeLa cells. It was speculated that this might be due to the selective dephosphorylation of tyrosine residues that have inhibitory signaling roles. Here we show that in these cell types, SHP-1 is present within the nucleus. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that SHP-1 is strikingly excluded from the nucleus of three hemopoietic cell lines, the first time that SHP-1 localization has been shown to be different within contrasting cell types. Consequently, it might be that SHP-1 performs its positive role by dephosphorylating nuclear tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. Because SHP-1 is overexpressed in a variety of malignant nonhemopoietic cells, identifying targets of nuclear SHP-1 dephosphorylation is critical in understanding the role of SHP-1 in tumorigenesis. Relatively few nuclear tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins have been identified. However, potential targets for nuclear PTPs are the STAT proteins, which are activated by tyrosine phosphorylation and translocate to the nucleus (32Darnell J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3375) Google Scholar). The tyrosine dephosphorylation event that switches off activated STAT-1 has been localized to the nucleus, but as yet the PTP(s) involved have not been identified (33Haspel R.L. Salditt-Georgieff M. Darnell J.E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6262-6268Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 34Haspel R.L. Darnell J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10188-10193Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). This would provide a role for SHP-1 in directly regulating gene expression. Studies to identify novel nuclear targets of SHP-1 are under way."

TAK1 kinase activity is specifically activated by the TAK1-binding protein TAB1. The C-terminal 68-amino acid sequence of TAB1 (TAB1-C68) is sufficient for TAK1 interaction and activation. Analysis of various truncated versions of TAB1-C68 defined a C-terminal 30-amino acid sequence (TAB1-C30) necessary for TAK1 binding and activation. NMR studies revealed that the TAB1-C30 region has a unique α-helical structure.

The C. eleganshomolog of TAB1, TAP-1, was able to interact with and activate theC. elegans homolog of TAK1, MOM-4. However, the site in TAP-1 corresponding to Phe-484 of TAB1 is an alanine residue (Ala-364), and changing this residue to Phe abrogates the ability of TAP-1 to interact with and activate MOM-4.

MAPKs are activated by phosphorylation on specific tyrosine and threonine residues by a family of dual-specificity protein kinase MAPK kinases. MAPK kinases are in turn activated by phosphorylation on serine and serine-threonine residues by the MAPK kinase kinases (MAPKKKs; Refs. 1Schaeffer H.J. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2435-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1407) Google Scholar, 2Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3666) Google Scholar). There are numerous MAPKKK-like proteins, including Raf, TAK1, Tpl2, apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1), and the MEKK and mixed lineage kinase group of proteins (1Schaeffer H.J. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2435-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1407) Google Scholar, 2Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3666) Google Scholar). Several components that function upstream of the MAPKKK family have been identified. Ras GTPase functions upstream of the Raf MAPKKK and is itself activated by growth factors that signal through receptor protein-tyrosine kinases (3Kolch W. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 289-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar). Rac and Cdc42 GTPases can interact with the MEKK and mixed lineage kinase group of proteins (4Fanger G.R. Johnson N.L. Johnson G.L.

TRAF2, an adaptor protein that functions in the tumor necrosis factor α signaling pathway, has been reported to bind MEKK1 and ASK1 (8Yuasa T. Ohno S. Kehrl J.H. Kyriakis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22681-22692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 9Nishitoh H. Saitoh M. Mochida Y. Takeda K. Nakano H. Rothe M. Miyazono K. Ichijo H. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 389-395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that TRAF2 acts on ASK1 after dissociation of ASK1 from its inhibitor thioredoxin (10Liu H. Nishitoh H. Ichijo H. Kyriakis J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2198-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). This interaction is likely to involve the regulation of ASK1 dimerization by reactive oxgen species (11Gotoh Y. Cooper J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17477-17482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). In some signaling pathways, Ste20-like kinases have been implicated in the activation of MAPKKKs. For example, Raf-1 is phosphorylated and activated by p21 (Rac/Cdc42)-activated kinase (12King A.J. Sun H. Diaz B. Barnard D. Miao W. Bagrodia S. Marshall M.S. Nature. 1998; 396: 180-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Germinal center kinase functions upstream of MEKK1 in the tumor necrosis factor α signaling pathway, leading to Jun N-terminal kinase activation (8Yuasa T. Ohno S. Kehrl J.H. Kyriakis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22681-22692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), and hematopoietic progenitor kinase and hematopoietic progenitor kinase /germinal center kinase-like kinase are involved in the activation of TAK1 (13Wang W. Zhou G. Hu M.C.-T. Yao Z. Tan T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22771-22775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Thus, different mechanisms are involved in the activation of MAPKKKs in response to a variety of extracellular stimuli. To understand the mechanisms by which extracellular signals regulate the MAPK pathway, it is essential to characterize potential factors involved in MAPKKK activation. TAK1 is a member of the MAPKKK family and is activated by various cytokines, including transforming growth factor-β family ligands and interleukin 1 (14Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kishimoto K. Hiyama A. Inoue J. Cao Z. Matsumoto K. Nature. 1999; 398: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar, 15Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Oishi I. Ueno N. Taniguchi T. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1995; 270: 2008-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that TAK1 functions in the transforming growth factor β signaling pathways in mammalian cells (15Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Oishi I. Ueno N. Taniguchi T. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1995; 270: 2008-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar). In early embryos of the amphibianXenopus, TAK1 also participates in mesoderm induction and patterning meditated by bone morphogenetic protein, another transforming growth factor β family ligand (16Shibuya H. Iwata H. Masuyama N. Gotoh Y. Yamaguchi K. Irie K. Matsumoto K. Nishida E. Ueno N. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1019-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have recently demonstrated that TAK1 is involved in the interleukin 1 signaling pathway via its activation of two kinase cascades (14Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kishimoto K. Hiyama A. Inoue J. Cao Z. Matsumoto K. Nature. 1999; 398: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar), an MAP kinase cascade leading to Jun N-terminal kinase activation and an IκB kinase cascade that ultimately leads to nuclear factor κB activation. The TAB1 protein was isolated in a yeast two-hybrid screen as a specific partner of TAK1 (17Shibuya H. Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Tonegawa A. Gotoh Y. Ueno N. Irie K. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1996; 272: 1179-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). When ectopically expressed together with TAB1, TAK1 phosphorylation and kinase activity are increased (18Kishimoto K. Matsumoto K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7359-7364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). A kinase-deficient mutant of TAK1 is not phosphorylated when co-expressed with TAB1, indicating that TAB1 promotes TAK1 autophosphorylation. Furthermore, mutation of a conserved serine residue (Ser-192) to alanine in the activation loop between kinase domains VII and VIII of TAK1 abolishes both phosphorylation and kinase activation by TAB1. These results suggest that ectopic expression of TAB1 activates TAK1 by promoting TAK1 autophosphorylation on Ser-192. However, the molecular mechanism for this activation remains to be elucidated. Homologs of TAK1 and TAB1, encoded by mom-4 andtap-1 genes, respectively, have been identified inCaenorhabditis elegans (19Meneghini M.D. Ishitani T. Carter J.C. Hisamoto N. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Thorpe C.J. Hamill D.R. Matsumoto K. Bowerman B. Nature. 1999; 399: 793-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Biochemical analysis has revealed that MOM-4 can phosphorylate MKK6 MAPK kinase in vitro, and that MOM-4 kinase activity is promoted by binding of TAP-1 (19Meneghini M.D. Ishitani T. Carter J.C. Hisamoto N. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Thorpe C.J. Hamill D.R. Matsumoto K. Bowerman B. Nature. 1999; 399: 793-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Thus, biochemical characterization of MOM-4 and TAP-1 suggests that these factors are similar to TAK1 and TAB1. Genetic analysis has shown that TAP-1 and MOM-4 regulate Wnt signaling inC. elegans via activation of the MAPK-like LIT-1. This is consistent with the observation that co-expression of TAK1 and TAB1 in mammalian cells can activate NEMO-like kinase, a mammalian homolog of LIT-1(20), and that the TAK1-NEMO-like kinase MAPK pathway negatively regulates Wnt signaling in mammalian cells. Thus, TAB1-TAK1 and TAP-1-MOM-4 appear to function analogously to regulate Wnt signaling pathways in mammalian cells and C. elegans, respectively. The C-terminal 68-amino acid portion of TAB1 was previously shown to be sufficient for TAK1 binding and activation (17Shibuya H. Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Tonegawa A. Gotoh Y. Ueno N. Irie K. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1996; 272: 1179-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). To understand the mechanism for TAB1-induced activation of TAK1, we undertook a structural and functional analysis of this domain. We report here that the C-terminal region of TAB1 contains a unique α-helix structure. By analyzing a number of TAB1-related proteins, we identified a conserved motif, PYVDXA/TXF, that is present in the C-terminal domains. Our results suggest that this conserved region functions as a specific docking site for TAK1. Yeast two-hybrid analysis was performed as described previously (17Shibuya H. Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Tonegawa A. Gotoh Y. Ueno N. Irie K. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1996; 272: 1179-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). For quantitative β-galactosidase assays, a liquid culture assay using theo-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside substrate was carried out as described previously (21Bartel, P. L., Chien, C., Sternglanz, R., Fields, S., Cellular Interactions in Development: A Practical Approach, Hartley, D. A., 1993, 153, 179, Oxford University Press, Oxford, England.Google Scholar), and activity was expressed in Miller units (22Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). For the ste11Δcomplementation assay, SY1984-P (his3Δ ste11Δ FUS1p::HIS3 STE7 P-368) was co-transformed with pNV11-TAK1 and the pGAD10 vector containing various TAB1 deletion mutants, and the transformants were streaked onto SC-His plates and incubated at 30 °C. TAB1 mutants were constructed by PCR-based mutagenesis using the appropriate synthetic oligonucleotides and the human TAB1 cDNA as a template. Resultant fragments were inserted into theXhoI-BamHI site of pGAD10 or into the mammalian expression vectors described below. All mutations were confirmed by sequencing. The samples for NMR analyses consisted of 6.8 mm C-terminal 30-amino acid sequence of TAB1 (TAB1-C30) in a solution of 40% trifluoroethanol, 55% H2O, and 5% D2O, pH 2.8. Under these conditions, the NMR spectra were well resolved. NMR measurements were performed using standard pulse sequences and phase cycling on a Bruker DMX-500 spectrometer. All two-dimensional NMR spectra were acquired in a phase-sensitive mode, using the time-proportional phase incrementation (23Marion D. Wuthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 113: 967-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (3524) Google Scholar) for quadrature detection in the t1dimension. NOESY spectra (24Jeener J. Meier B. Bachmann P. Ernst R.R. J. Chem. Phys. 1979; 71: 4546-4553Crossref Scopus (4845) Google Scholar, 25Macura S. Huang Y. Suter D. Ernst R.R. J. Magn. Reson. 1981; 43: 259-281Google Scholar) were recorded with mixing time of 200 ms at 300 K. TOCSY spectra were recorded using an MLEV-17 pulse scheme (26Bax A. Davis D.G. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 65: 355-359Google Scholar) with an isotropic mixing time of 50 ms. Spectra were referenced to H2O. Double-quantum filtered COSY experiments (27Rance M. Sorensen O.W. Bodenhausen G. Wagner G. Ernst R.R. Wuthrich K. Biochem. Biohys. Res. Commun. 1983; 117: 479-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (2597) Google Scholar) were recorded in an attempt to measure3JNH-H coupling constants (28Redfield A.G. Kunz S.D. J. Magn. Reson. 1975; 19: 250-254Google Scholar). The water proton signal was suppressed by low-power irradiation during the relaxation delay (2.0 s) of all experiments and during the mixing time of NOESY experiments. Data processing was performed on a Sun UltraSparc workstation using the program package NMRDraw and NMRPipe (29Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11638) Google Scholar). The strengths of the peaks were determined by peak height in the 200-ms NOESY spectrum. Peaks were classified as strong, medium, or weak. These classifications corresponded to the upper bounds of 2.8, 3.5, and 5.0 Å, respectively (30Clore G. Bruenger A.T. Karplus M. Gronenborn A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 205: 201-228Google Scholar). The upper limits of nonstereospecifically assigned methylene, methyl, and aromatic protons were adjusted using standard pseudoatom corrections (31Wuthrich K. Billeter M. Braun W. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 169: 949-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar). Three-dimensional structures were calculated on an SGI INDIGO2 workstation using simulated annealing and energy minimization protocols provided by X-PLOR 3.1 (32Bruenger A.T. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Karplus M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 74: 4130-4134Google Scholar, 33Bruenger A.T. X-POLOR Manual Version 3.1. Yale University, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar). Anab initio-simulated annealing protocol was used to generate a set of 50 structures, on the basis of the experimentally derived distance and torsion angle constraints, starting from template structures with randomized angles and extended side chains (34Nilges M. Gronenborn A.M. Bruenger A.T. Clore G.M. Protein Eng. 1988; 2: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). 293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with fetal calf serum (10%) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. pCMVHA and pCMVFlag vectors were constructed by inserting a hemagglutinin (HA) or Flag epitope sequence into pCMV, generating N-terminal HA or Flag epitope-tagged proteins, respectively. Mammalian expression vectors for N-terminal HA epitope-tagged TAK1 (pCMVHA-TAK1) and MOM-4 (pCMVHA-MOM-4) or N-terminal Flag epitope-tagged TAB1 (pCMVFlag-TAB1) and TAP-1 (pCMVFlag-TAP-1) were generated by inserting the cDNA fragments into the pCMVHA or pCMVFlag vectors, respectively. 293 cells (1 × 106) were plated in 10-cm dishes, transfected with various expression vectors, and incubated for 24–36 h. Cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 0.3 ml of 0.5% Triton X-100 lysis buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 12.5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmsodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 20 μm aprotinin. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min. Proteins from cell lysates were incubated with the anti-HA rabbit polycolonal antibody Y-11 (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) and 15 μl of protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The beads were washed extensively with phosphate-buffered saline. For immunoblotting, the immunoprecipitates or whole cell lysates were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to Hybond-P membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The membranes were immunoblotted with mouse monoclonal antibodies to HA, HA.11 (Babco), or Flag, M2 (Sigma). The bound antibody was visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies to mouse IgG using the ECL Western blotting system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Aliquots of immunoprecipitates were incubated in 10 μl of kinase buffer containing 10 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mmMgCl2, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at 25 °C for 2 min. Samples were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and phosphorylated proteins were visualized by autoradiography. We have previously shown that the C-terminal 68-amino acid sequence of TAB1 (TAB1-C68) is sufficient for TAK1 interaction and activation (17Shibuya H. Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Tonegawa A. Gotoh Y. Ueno N. Irie K. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1996; 272: 1179-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). To determine the region of TAB1-C68 responsible for its interaction with TAK1, we examined a series of N- and C-terminal TAB1-C68 truncation mutants in a yeast two-hybrid system. Various deletion mutants of TAB1-C68 were fused to the Gal4 transcription activation domain (GAD) and co-transformed with a plasmid encoding a LexA DNA binding domain-TAK1 chimeric protein. Interaction was detected by expression of a β-galactosidase reporter containing LexA binding sites in its promoter (Fig.1). Deletion of a serine-rich region within TAB1 (residues 437–460, TAB1-C45) had no effect on the binding of a TAB1 with TAK1. Thus, the serine-rich region of TAB1 is not required for interaction with TAK1, and the minimum TAB1 segment required for TAK1 binding includes residues 480–495. We have previously shown that a constitutively activated form of mammalian TAK1 can complement the yeast Ste11 MAPKKK in the pheromone-induced MAPK pathway (15Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Oishi I. Ueno N. Taniguchi T. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1995; 270: 2008-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar). However, expression of normal, full-length TAK1 fails to rescue the ste11Δ mutation. This suggests that yeast cells lack an endogenous activator of TAK1 (15Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Oishi I. Ueno N. Taniguchi T. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1995; 270: 2008-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar). Using this complementation system, various GAD-TAB1 constructs were tested for their ability to complement the ste11Δ mutation in the presence of TAK1. Co-expression of GAD-TAB1-C30 with TAK1 was found to rescue the Ste11 deficiency, whereas GAD-TAB1-C25 had no effect (Fig. 1). These results indicate that the serine-rich region of TAB1 is not required for either TAK1 binding or activation, whereas TAB1-C30 contains a minimal region sufficient for both TAK1 binding and activation. To determine the three-dimensional structure of the TAB1-C30 region, a peptide comprising residues 475–504 was synthesized and analyzed by NMR (Fig.2 A). For sequence-specific assignments and the identification of secondary structure elements in TAB1-C30, we used sequential nuclear Overhauser effect connectivities and the secondary Hα chemical shifts observed for TAB1-C30 in 40% trifluoroethanol, 55% H2O, and 5% D2O, pH 2.75. On the basis of the superposition of the 10 best-calculated structures, an α-helical region was identified between Tyr-481 and His-495. This region overlaps with the minimum region in TAB1 required for TAK1 binding (Fig. 1). However, the secondary structures of both the N-terminal (residues from Asp-475 to Phe-480) and C-terminal (residues from Asp-496 to Phe-504) regions were not well defined (Fig. 2 B). In a wheel projection of the α-helical region, we noticed the alignment of amino acids carrying large hydrophobic side chains with aromatic character on the same side of the wheel (Fig. 2 C). This structure may provide local apolar surfaces that facilitate the interaction of TAB1 with TAK1. To determine whether individual aromatic amino acids in the α-helix region between Tyr-481 and His-495 are essential for TAB1 interaction with TAK1, each aromatic amino acid in the TAB1-C68 region was replaced with alanine. TAK1 binding activity of wild-type and mutant TAB1-C68 was determined by a yeast two-hybrid protein assay (Fig. 3). Alanine substitution of Phe-484 markedly reduced TAK1 binding. In contrast, substitutions of Tyr-481, Phe-487, Trp-491, or His-495 with alanine had little effect on TAK1 binding. Alanine substitution of Tyr-488 partially reduced interaction with TAK1. Thus, this analysis implicates the Phe-484 residue within the α-helix as essential for TAK1 binding. We next examined whether the F484A mutation would affect the ability of full-length TAB1 to bind to TAK1. We constructed TAB1(F484A), replacing Phe-484 with Ala, and performed co-immunoprecipitation assays in mammalian cells. Expression vectors encoding Flag epitope-tagged TAB1 (Flag-TAB1) or TAB1(F484A) (Flag-TAB1(F484A)) were co-transfected into human embryonic kidney 293 cells along with an expression vector encoding HA epitope-tagged TAK1 (HA-TAK1). Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with the anti-HA antibody, and co-precipitated TAB1 or TAB1(F484A) was detected by immunoblot analysis with the anti-Flag antibody. We found that the TAB1(F484A) mutation caused a marked reduction in TAK1 binding relative to wild-type TAB1 (Fig.4). Thus, the F484A mutation disrupts the association of full-length TAB1 with TAK1. We have previously shown that TAK1 has no kinase activity when ectopically expressed in mammalian cells alone but is activated when co-expressed with TAB1 (17Shibuya H. Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Tonegawa A. Gotoh Y. Ueno N. Irie K. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1996; 272: 1179-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar, 18Kishimoto K. Matsumoto K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7359-7364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the effect of the TAB1(F484A) mutation on TAK1 activation. TAK1 immunoprecipitates were subjected to in vitro kinase assay using bacterially expressed MKK6 as an exogenous substrate (Fig. 4). As observed previously (17Shibuya H. Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Tonegawa A. Gotoh Y. Ueno N. Irie K. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1996; 272: 1179-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar, 18Kishimoto K. Matsumoto K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7359-7364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), TAK1 activity was not detected when TAK1 alone was ectopically expressed but was detected when TAK1 and TAB1 were expressed together. In contrast, TAK1 activity was significantly lower when the TAB1(F484A) mutant was co-expressed with TAK1. These results indicate that the Phe-484 residue in the TAB1 protein is important for both TAK1 binding and activation. TheC. elegans MOM-4 and TAP-1 proteins are structurally and functionally similar to the vertebrate TAK1 and TAB1 proteins, respectively (19Meneghini M.D. Ishitani T. Carter J.C. Hisamoto N. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Thorpe C.J. Hamill D.R. Matsumoto K. Bowerman B. Nature. 1999; 399: 793-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). For example, MOM-4 functions as an MAPKKK that can phosphorylate the MKK6 MAPK kinase in vitro, and TAP-1 can interact with and activate MOM-4. The present studies delineated an essential region required for TAK1 binding within the TAB1-C30 domain. This C-terminal region is homologous between the vertebrate TAB1 and the C. elegans TAP-1; in particular, a similar motif PYVDXA/TXF, is present in both (Fig.5). Therefore, it is likely that the TAK1/MOM-4 binding function of TAB1/TAP-1 is evolutionarily conserved. However, although mutation of Phe-484 to alanine abrogates the ability of mammalian TAB1 to associate with and activate TAK1, the corresponding site in the C. elegans TAP-1 protein is itself an alanine residue, Ala-364. To determine whether this alanine plays a role in MOM-4 binding and activation, we mutated Ala-364 to Phe. We transiently co-expressed HA epitope-tagged MOM-4 (HA-MOM-4) together with Flag epitope-tagged TAP-1 (Flag-TAP-1) or TAP-1(A364F) (Flag-TAP-1(A364F)) in 293 cells. Cell extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibody, immunoblotting, and thenin vitro kinase assay (Fig. 4). Immunoblot analysis revealed that wild-type TAP-1 associated with MOM-4 but that the TAP-1(A364F) mutation abolished MOM-4 binding activity. When expressed alone, HA-MOM-4 had no kinase activity. However, co-expression with TAP-1 stimulated MOM-4 activity, whereas co-expression with TAP-1(A364F) did not. These results indicate that the Ala-364 residue in the C. elegans TAP-1 is important for both MOM-4 binding and activation. We next examined the species specificity between TAB1/TAP-1 and TAK1/MOM-4 by co-expression in 293 cells (Fig. 4). We found that neither mammalian Flag-TAB1 nor Flag-TAB1(F484A) associated with or activated C. elegans HA-MOM-4 kinase. In contrast, bothC. elegans TAP-1 and TAP-1(A364F) interacted with mammalian TAK1 kinase. Interestingly, although TAP-1 did not activate TAK1 kinase activity, TAP-1(A364F) did show weak stimulation of TAK1 autophosphorylation. Thus, activation of mammalian TAK1 requires a Phe residue in the C-terminal region of either TAB1 or TAP-1. The majority of protein kinases contain a number of conserved sequence motifs, in addition to the canonical ∼260-amino acid catalytic core, which have been suggested to be involved in substrate selection, regulation of catalytic activity, and cellular localization (35Johnson L.N. Noble M.E. Owen D.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 149-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar). In general, our understanding of the functions of these noncatalytic domains is poor, perhaps because there are few studies using purified, well-characterized proteins. In the present study, we examined TAK1, a member of the MAPKKK family. TAK1 is inactive until activated by TAB1. The activation of TAK1 is regulated by protein-protein interactions and protein modifications such as phosphorylation. Recently, we have shown that TAB1-induced activation of TAK1 requires autophosphorylation of TAK1 at Ser-192 in the kinase activation loop. Furthermore, it has been reported that the C-terminal region of TAB1, consisting of residues 480–504, is sufficient for association with and activation of TAK1 (36Sakurai H. Miyoshi H. Mizukami J. Sugita T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 474: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In the present study, we characterized in detail the region in TAB1 responsible for binding to TAK1. First, a structural analysis of the TAB1-C30 peptide by NMR study reveals a unique α-helix structure, characterized by the alignment of aromatic residues on one side of the helix. Yeast two-hybrid analyses of wild-type, alanine-substituted, and deletion mutants of TAB1 show that the aromatic Phe-484 residue in the α-helical domain is critical for TAK1 binding. An evolutionarily conserved consensus core sequence required for TAK1 binding, PYVDXA/TXF, was identified within the helix domain of TAB1. High-resolution structural studies will be required to define the specific functional role of each amino acid in the core motif important for TAK1 binding. As shown here, TAK1 binding activity can be localized to a small region in the TAB1 C-terminal domain and can be ablated by a single point mutation. These features of the TAB1-TAK1 interaction suggest that small peptides or peptidomimetics that disrupt the interaction could be used to inhibit TAK1-dependent cellular functions."
https://openalex.org/W2038868574,"The hormone glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) is an important regulator of insulin secretion. GIP has been shown to increase adenylyl cyclase activity, elevate intracellular Ca2+ levels, and stimulate a mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway in the pancreatic β-cell. In the current study we demonstrate a role for arachidonic acid in GIP-mediated signal transduction. Static incubations revealed that both GIP (100 nm) and ATP (5 μm) significantly increased [3H]arachidonic acid ([3H]AA) efflux from transfected Chinese hamster ovary K1 cells expressing the GIP receptor (basal, 128 ± 11 cpm/well; GIP, 212 ± 32 cpm/well; ATP, 263 ± 35 cpm/well;n = 4; p < 0.05). In addition, GIP receptors were shown for the first time to be capable of functionally coupling to AA production through Gβγ dimers in Chinese hamster ovary K1 cells. In a β-cell model (βTC-3), GIP was found to elicit [3H]AA release, independent of glucose, in a concentration-dependent manner (EC50 value of 1.4 ± 0.62 nm; n = 3). Although GIP did not potentiate insulin release under extracellular Ca2+-free conditions, it was still capable of elevating intracellular cAMP and stimulating [3H]AA release. Our data suggest that cAMP is the proximal signaling intermediate responsible for GIP-stimulated AA release. Finally, stimulation of GIP-mediated AA production was shown to be mediated via a Ca2+-independent phospholipase A2. Arachidonic acid is therefore a new component of GIP-mediated signal transduction in the β-cell.

GIP and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) are thought to be the major hormones (incretins) that constitute the endocrine component of the enteroinsular axis in humans and are responsible for at least 50% of postprandial insulin secretion (5Fehmann H.-C. Göke R. Göke B. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 390-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). In non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (type 2 diabetes mellitus), the incretin effect following oral glucose administration is reduced or absent (6Nauck M. Stöckman R. Ebert R. Creutzfeldt W. Diabetologia. 1986; 29: 46-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (1114) Google Scholar, 7Holst J. Gromada J. Nauck M. Diabetologia. 1997; 40: 984-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and the ability of intravenous GIP, but not GLP-1, to stimulate insulin secretion is severely blunted (7Holst J.

This implies that a defective GIP signal transduction system and/or a reduced number of functional GIP receptors may contribute to the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes. A greater understanding of the signal transduction systems activated by GIP should assist in determining whether reduced responsiveness involves changes at this level. The receptor for GIP (9Usdin T.

Pharmacol. Ther. 1998; 80: 231-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Stimulation of the GIP receptor has been shown to stimulate adenylyl cyclase and elevate intracellular cAMP levels in pancreatic islets (13Siegel E.G. Creutzfeldt T.W.

Ammon H. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1992; 90: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and increase intracellular Ca2+ levels in HIT-T15 (18Lu M. Wheeler M. Leng X.-H. Boyd A. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 94-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), RINm5F (9Usdin T. Mezey É. Button D. Brownstein M. Bonner T. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 2861-2870Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), and COS cells (10Wheeler M. Gelling R. McIntosh C. Georgiou J. Brown J. Pederson R. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4629-4639Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown that the GIP receptor probably couples to various Ca2+ channels (10Wheeler M. Gelling R. McIntosh C. Georgiou J. Brown J. Pederson R. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4629-4639Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but there is no evidence for GIP-stimulated IP3 production (18Lu M. Wheeler M. Leng X.-H. Boyd A. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 94-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). There is, however, evidence that GIP stimulates insulin secretion (19Straub S. Sharp G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 224: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (20Kubota A. Yamada Y. Yasuda K. Someya Y. Ihara Y. Kagimoto S. Watanabe R. Kuroe A. Ishida H. Seino Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) via a wortmannin-sensitive pathway, implying a role for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. It is therefore clear that GIP action on the pancreatic β-cell involves several interacting signal transduction pathways. Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) catalyzes the hydrolysis of the sn-2 fatty acid substituents from glycerophospholipid substrates to yield a free fatty acid and a 2-lysophospholipid (21Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16069-16072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 22Mukherjee A.B. Miele L. Pattabiraman N. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 48: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In the β-cell, glucose has been shown to hydrolyze membrane phospholipids, leading to the accumulation of arachidonic acid (AA), which ultimately amplifies insulin secretion (23Turk J. Wolf B.A. McDaniel M.L. Prog. Lipid Res. 1987; 26: 125-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 24Turk J. Gross R.W. Ramanadham S. Diabetes. 1993; 42: 367-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). PLA2 has been identified in both human and rat islets (25Chen M. Yang Z. Naji A. Wolf B.A. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 2901-2909Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), as well as in various insulinoma cell lines (26Loweth A.C. Scarpello J.H.B. Morgan N.G. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 112: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 27Ramanadham S. Wolf M. Jett P. Gross R.W. Turk J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7442-7452Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). These β-cell models have been shown to express Ca2+-dependent cytosolic PLA2 (28Ma Z. Ramanadham S. Hu Z. Turk J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1391: 384-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), ATP-stimulatable Ca2+-independent cytosolic PLA2 (iPLA2), and secretory PLA2(29Ramanadham S. Ma Z. Arita H. Zhang S. Turk J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1390: 301-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) isoforms. A role for all of these enzymes in glucose-induced insulin release has been suggested (25Chen M. Yang Z. Naji A. Wolf B.A. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 2901-2909Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 26Loweth A.C. Scarpello J.H.B. Morgan N.G. Mol. Cell.

Kudo I. Suwa Y. Inoue K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 209: 257-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Heterotrimeric G proteins are activated by G protein-coupled receptors and undergo GDP/GTP exchange at the level of the Gα subunit, leading to dissociation of the trimer into Gα and Gβγ subunits (33Clapham D. Neer E. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 167-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). The Gβγ subunits have recently been shown to act on a number of effector targets including ion channels, enzymes, and kinases (33Clapham D. Neer E. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 167-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). Recent data suggested that inactivation of free Gβγ completely abolished KCl, Ca2+, and GTPγS-evoked insulin release from HIT-T15 cells (34Zhang H. Yasrebi-Nejad H. Lang J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 424: 202-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), establishing a role for these subunits in insulin secretion. A role for Gβγ has also been demonstrated in the coupling of PLA2 and arachidonic acid production in rod outer segments (35Jelsema C.L. Axelrod J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3623-3627Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) and to the activation of cardiac potassium channels (36Kim D. Lewis D.L. Graziadei L. Neer E.J. Bar-Sigi D. Clapham D.E. Nature. 1989; 337: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). These observations provided the rationale for determining whether arachidonic acid and PLA2 are involved in the glucose potentiating effects of GIP in the β-cell, with a focus on Gβγ subunits as a coupling mechanism. We show for the first time that GIP stimulates AA release from CHO-K1 cells and clonal β-cells (βTC-3). Coupling of the GIP receptor to AA production in CHO-K1 cells was via Gβγ subunits, whereas cAMP was shown to be the mediator in βTC-3 cells. The PLA2 isoform activated by GIP in βTC-3 cells was Ca2+-independent and hypothesized to be the same as that activated by glucose when stimulating insulin secretion. CHO-K1 cells cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) and supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum (Cansera, Rexdale, Canada) were stably transfected with the wild type rat GIP receptor as described previously (10Wheeler M. Gelling R. McIntosh C. Georgiou J. Brown J. Pederson R. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4629-4639Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Gelling R. Wheeler M. Xue J. Gyomorey S. Nian C. Pederson R. McIntosh C. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2640-2643Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The CHO-K1 cell line obtained by pooling clones was termed rGIP-15 and has previously been shown to express receptors at levels similar to high level expressing clones (15Gelling R. Wheeler M. Xue J. Gyomorey S. Nian C. Pederson R. McIntosh C. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2640-2643Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In experiments targeted at investigating a role for Gβγ signaling, rGIP-15 clones were transiently transfected with plasmid DNA encoding the C terminus of β-adrenergic receptor kinase (βARKct) (37Koch W. Hawes B. Inglese J. Luttrell L. Lefkowitz R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6193-6197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or the empty vector (pRK5). Briefly, 40–60% confluent monolayers in 10-cm culture plates (Becton Dickenson, Lincoln Park, NJ) were transfected using SuperfectTM (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) transfection reagent according to the manufacturers' protocol. Cells were harvested 18–24 h post-transfection and passaged into 24-well plates for subsequent arachidonic acid release experiments. The empty plasmid pRK5 and the plasmid pRK-βARKct (495) were kindly provided by Dr. R. J. Lefkowitz (37Koch W. Hawes B. Inglese J. Luttrell L. Lefkowitz R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6193-6197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Passages 20–30 of rGIP-15 cells were used in these experiments. βTC-3 cells were obtained from a frozen stock that was originally a gift from Dr. S. Efrat (Diabetes Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York) (38Efrat S. Linde S. Kofod H. Spector D. Delannoy M. Grant S. Hanahan D. Baekkeskov S. Cell Biol. 1988; 85: 9037-9041Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in low glucose (5.5 mm) Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 12.5% horse serum (Cansera) and 2.5% fetal bovine serum (Cansera). Passages 20–30 were used in these experiments. Synthetic porcine GIP (5 μg) was iodinated by the chloramine-T method, and the125I-GIP was further purified by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography to a specific activity of 250–300 μCi/μg, (10Wheeler M. Gelling R. McIntosh C. Georgiou J. Brown J. Pederson R. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4629-4639Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The aliquots were subsequently lyophilized and stored at −20 °C until use. Competitive binding analyses were performed as described previously with minor modifications (10Wheeler M. Gelling R. McIntosh C. Georgiou J. Brown J. Pederson R. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4629-4639Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, CHO-K1 cells plated 2 days prior in 24-well plates were washed twice with 4 °C Krebs-Ringer (115 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 10 mmNaHCO3, 1.28 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4) containing 10 mm HEPES and 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4 (KRBH), and incubated in triplicate for 14–18 h at 4 °C with 125I-GIP (50 000 cpm/well) in the presence or the absence of unlabeled GIP (synthetic human GIP1–42; Bachem, Torrence, CA). After two consecutive washes in ice-cold buffer, cells were solubilized with 0.1m NaOH and transferred to test tubes for counting. Nonspecific binding was defined as that measured in the presence of an excess of human GIP (1 μm), and specific binding was expressed as a percentage of maximum binding (%B/Bo). The cells were passaged into 24-well culture plates at 5 × 104 cells/well for CHO-K1 clones and 5 × 105 cells/well for βTC-3 cells. For cAMP studies, cells were washed twice with KRBH and then stimulated for 30 min with GIP in the presence of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine at 0.5 mmconcentration (RBI/Sigma). Following stimulation, reactions were stopped, and cells were lysed in 70% ice-cold ethanol, cellular debris was removed by centrifugation, and cAMP was subsequently quantified by radioimmunoassay (Biomedical Technologies Inc., Stoughton, MA). All insulin release experiments were performed over 60 min in KRBH in the absence of 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, and insulin secreted into the medium was quantified by radioimmunoassay as previously reported (39Hinke S.A. Pauly R.P. Ehses J. Kerridge P. Demuth H.-U. McIntosh C.H.S. Pederson R.A. J. Endocrinol. 2000; 165: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Arachidonic acid release was determined by methods adapted from Shuttleworth and Thompson (40Shuttleworth T.J. Thompson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32636-32643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested and passaged into 24-well culture plates at 4 × 104 cells/well for CHO-K1 clones and 2 × 105 cells/well for βTC-3 cells. The respective media were replaced with media containing 0.125 μCi/ml [3H]AA (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) 18–24 h following passaging, and the plates were incubated for an additional 36–48 h. Prior to the addition of experimental agents, the wells were washed twice with 0.5 ml of KRBH and allowed to equilibrate for 1 h. Ca2+-free experiments were conducted in KRBH containing equimolar Mg2+ and supplemented with 10 mm EGTA. The agonists were dissolved in Krebs-Ringer buffer, added in triplicate (0.5 ml total volume/well), and incubated for the length of time shown in the figure legends. As a positive control, ATP was added at a final concentration of 5 μm. When used, the inhibitor haloenol lactone suicide substrate (HELSS; Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) was added for 30 min prior to washing and addition of agonists. After incubation, 0.4-ml aliquots were placed into scintillation vials followed by the addition of 10 ml of Econo 2 scintillation fluid (Fisher), and the radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry. AA released from cells was generally between 2–6% of total [3H]AA incorporated into cells. The data are expressed as the means ± S.E. with the number of individual experiments presented in the figure legend. All of the data were analyzed using the nonlinear regression analysis program PRISM (Graphpad, San Diego, CA), and the significance was tested using the Student's t test and analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the Tukey post-test (p < 0.05) as indicated in figure legends. Initial studies were targeted at investigating GIP receptor signaling in an expression system, the rGIP-15 clone of CHO-K1 cells. Static incubations (45 min) revealed a concentration dependence to GIP-stimulated arachidonic acid production (Fig.1 a). In agreement with previous, non-incretin, studies on CHO-K1 cells (41Bymaster F. Calligaro D. Falcone J. Cell. Signal. 1999; 11: 405-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 42Dickerson C.D. Weiss E.R. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 216: 46-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), ATP (5 μm) increased AA release from rGIP-15 cells by greater than 200% (p < 0.01, n = 4). Parallel studies were performed in βTC-3 cells, a model of the pancreatic β-cell. These cells respond to arachidonic acid in a glucose-dependent manner (Fig.2). In the presence of glucose, AA potentiated insulin secretion at concentrations as low as 10 μm (Fig. 2 a), whereas 20-fold greater concentrations were required before a response was observed under glucose-free conditions (Fig. 2 c). The potentiation of insulin secretion elicited by 100 μm AA is comparable with that elicited by 100 nm GIP under 11 mmglucose conditions (Fig. 2 a versus Fig. 8). GIP was found to stimulate AA release in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1, b andc). Interestingly, the EC50 value for GIP-stimulated AA release (1.4 nm ± 0.62 nm;n = 3) was similar to that for insulin release in these cells (data not shown), in contrast to the 5-fold higher EC50 value for cAMP production (39Hinke S.A. Pauly R.P. Ehses J. Kerridge P. Demuth H.-U. McIntosh C.H.S. Pederson R.A. J.

Gluc, glucose.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It is well established that the insulinotropic action of GIP is dependent on elevated glucose levels and that glucose induces activation of PLA2 in pancreatic β-cells. However, we have recently shown that GIP receptor coupling to adenylyl cyclase in βTC-3 cells is independent of extracellular glucose concentrations (39Hinke S.A. Pauly R.P. Ehses J. Kerridge P. Demuth H.-U. McIntosh C.H.S. Pederson R.A. J. Endocrinol. 2000; 165: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In the current study, increases in [3H]AA efflux stimulated by GIP were also found to be independent of extracellular glucose (Fig. 1 c), indicating that GIP-induced and glucose-induced increases in AA release were mediated via separate pathways. Analysis of the time dependence of AA release in rGIP-15 cells demonstrated maximal release at 10 min (Fig.3 a), which correlates well with that for GIP-stimulated cAMP production (maximal plateau reached at 10–15 min in rGIP-15 and βTC-3 cells; n = 3). In contrast, GIP-induced AA release was not detected before 30 min of incubation in the βTC-3 cells (Fig. 3 b), and glucose-induced release was not observed until after 60 min of incubation (Fig. 3 b). It was considered possible that these differences in onset of response may reflect alternative GIP receptor-effector coupling systems in the two cell types. Because Gβγ has been previously implicated in the activation of phospholipase A2 (35Jelsema C.L. Axelrod J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3623-3627Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), an inhibitor peptide of Gβγ, βARKct (β-adrenergic receptor kinase C-terminal tail), was transiently expressed in rGIP-15 cells. To confirm that cells had been transfected, GIP receptor internalization was monitored because Gβγ subunits have been shown to be required for G protein receptor kinase-mediated G protein-coupled receptor internalization (43Lin H.C. Duncan J.A. Kozasa T. Gilman A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5057-5060Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Expression of βARKct was associated with an inhibition of receptor internalization in these cells (versus pRK5 vector control;n = 3). Initial experiments were conducted to examine GIP receptor binding and cAMP production in this expression model. βARKct expression was not found to have any significant effect on either receptor affinity for GIP or on activation of adenylyl cyclase (IC50 values for binding: 3.95 nm ± 0.91 (n = 3) and 4.07 nm ± 0.97 (n = 3); EC50 values for cAMP production: 0.73 nm ± 0.12 (n = 3) and 0.49 nm ± 0.09 (n = 3) for vector and βARKct, respectively). GIP receptors were shown, for the first time, to be capable of functionally coupling to AA production through Gβγ dimers, because the expression of βARKct significantly suppressed the GIP-mediated response by almost 70% (Fig.4, p < 0.05). Purinergic receptors were also found to be coupled to AA production via Gβγ dimers, because βARKct expression reduced ATP-stimulated AA production by greater than 40%.Figure 4Effect of G protein βγ inhibition on GIP-mediated arachidonic acid release in rGIP-15 cells. rGIP-15 cells expressing the GIP receptor were transiently transfected with 10 μg pRK5 vector or βARKct cDNA construct, and the medium was removed at 45 min.

To ensure that transfection had occurred, cells were typically cotransfected with green fluorescent protein as a marker of transfection efficiency. Inhibition of Gβγ action had no effect on glucose- or GIP-stimulated AA release (βARKct expressionversus pRK5 control; n = 3) or insulin secretion in βTC-3 cells (Fig. 5). In addition, pertussis toxin (100 and 500 ng/ml) had no effect on AA release, indicating that toxin sensitive Gα-proteins (Gαi, Gαo, and Gαq) do not play a role in glucose- or GIP-stimulated AA release in βTC-3 cells (data not shown). This agrees with our previous studies showing that pertussis toxin at 500 ng/ml had no effect on cAMP levels in βTC-3 cells (39Hinke S.A. Pauly R.P. Ehses J. Kerridge P. Demuth H.-U. McIntosh C.H.S. Pederson R.A. J. Endocrinol. 2000; 165: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, both the diterpene forskolin and the incretin GLP-1, agents that specifically elevate intracellular cAMP levels, were able to stimulate AA release (Fig. 6), indicating that GIP may be acting on AA release via stimulation of adenylyl cyclase in the βTC3-cell. Interestingly, the specific protein kinase A inhibitor, H89 (5 μm), showed no effect on GIP- or forskolin-stimulated AA release (Fig.7). The possibility that AA-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity can also be refuted because exogenous AA had either no effect or slightly inhibited basal cAMP production in βTC-3 cells (Fig. 2, b andd).Figure 6A role for cAMP signaling as a mediator of arachidonic acid release in βTC-3 cells.The ability of the diterpene forskolin and the incretin GLP-1 to elicit arachidonic acid release was examined under glucose dependent (a, n = 3–4; b,n = 3–8) and independent (inset,n = 3; b, n = 3–8) conditions. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.001 for basal versus all; #, p < 0.05 for 11 mm versus glucose + GLP-1; %,p < 0.05 for glucose + GLP-1 versus glucose + GLP-1 + GIP as tested by ANOVA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 7Effect of protein kinase A inhibition on GIP-mediated (a) and forskolin-mediated (b) arachidonic acid release in βTC-3 cells.

AA efflux was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures” (n ≥ 3). *, p < 0.05.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The reduction of extracellular Ca2+ was found to have no effect on GIP-stimulated AA release, implying that a Ca2+-independent mechanism was involved in the production of AA (Fig. 8 a). As predicted, neither glucose nor GIP was able to stimulate insulin secretion from βTC3-cells under stringent Ca2+-free conditions (Fig.8 b). However, GIP was clearly still capable of elevating cAMP levels despite a reduction in basal cAMP production (Fig.8 c). The cAMP levels resulting from GIP stimulation under Ca2+-free conditions were, however, significantly suppressed compared with control conditions (p < 0.05). The ability of GIP to release AA under Ca2+-free conditions suggested that a Ca2+-independent PLA2 was involved. An inhibitor specific for iPLA2, HELSS, has previously been shown to inhibit glucose-stimulated AA production and insulin secretion in several β-cell models (30Ramanadham S. Gross R.W. Han X. Turk J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 337-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 44Ramanadham S. Wolf M. Li B. Bohrer A. Turk J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1344: 153-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 45Gross R.W. Ramanadham S. Kruszka K. Han X. Turk J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 327-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In the present study, HELSS was found to inhibit GIP-stimulated AA production as well as glucose- and GIP-stimulated insulin secretion (Fig.9), supporting the aforementioned hypothesis that the enzyme coupled to GIP receptor signaling is a Ca2+-independent PLA2. In human type 2 diabetes there is a decreased insulin response to GIP that is of unknown etiology. One possible underlying defect is in the normal signal transduction pathways by which GIP stimulates insulin secretion in β-cells. It has been established that GIP stimulates adenylyl cyclase (13Siegel E.G. Creutzfeldt T.W. Diabetologia. 1985; 28: 857-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), increases intracellular Ca2+(18Lu M. Wheeler M. Leng X.-H. Boyd A. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 94-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and activates mitogen-activated protein kinase (20Kubota A. Yamada Y. Yasuda K. Someya Y. Ihara Y. Kagimoto S. Watanabe R. Kuroe A. Ishida H. Seino Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and the current study was undertaken to identify alternate mechanisms of regulating β-cell function. We have shown that GIP receptors in βTC-3 cells and transfected CHO-K1 cells are capable of coupling to transduction systems that release arachidonic acid from membrane lipids via activation of a Ca2+-independent phospholipase A2. Additionally, this signaling pathway was shown to involve G protein βγ coupling in CHO-K1 cells, whereas a cyclic AMP-mediated pathway is probably involved in βTC-3 cells. Initial studies of GIP-stimulated AA release revealed a marked difference in the time dependence of AA release between CHO-K1 and βTC-3 cells. The much more rapid release evident in rGIP-15 cells is in agreement with previously observed AA production rates observed with rhodopsin and muscarinic receptors expressed in CHO-K1 cells (41Bymaster F. Calligaro D. Falcone J. Cell. Signal. 1999; 11: 405-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 42Dickerson C.D. Weiss E.R. Exp.

However, coupling of GIP to AA release was much slower in βTC-3 cells, suggesting a unique GIP receptor-AA coupling mechanism. There was also a difference between GIP- and glucose-induced AA release in βTC-3 cells, with GIP initiating release by 30 min, whereas glucose had no effect by this time (Fig. 3). This suggests that separate mechanisms couple glucose and the GIP receptor to AA production. Extensive studies have established that the glucose-induced AA production coupled to β-cell insulin secretion (24Turk J. Gross R.W. Ramanadham S. Diabetes. 1993; 42: 367-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 48Simonsson E. Ahren B. Int. J. Pancreatol. 2000; 27: 1-11Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) involved activation of an ATP sensitive, Ca2+-independent PLA2 (27Ramanadham S. Wolf M. Jett P. Gross R.W. Turk J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7442-7452Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 48Simonsson E. Ahren B. Int. J. Pancreatol. 2000; 27: 1-11Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This enzyme has been identified in a number of insulinoma cell lines, including βTC-3 cells (44Ramanadham S. Wolf M. Li B. Bohrer A. Turk J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1344: 153-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and further studies were therefore performed to determine whether GIP-induced AA release also resulted from its activation. The C-terminal fragment of the β-adrenergic receptor kinase protein (βARKct or G protein receptor kinase 2) was utilized to study the role of Gβγ signaling. Jelsema and Axelrod (35Jelsema C.L. Axelrod J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3623-3627Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) first suggested that activation PLA2 can be performed by Gβγ subunits. In the present study it was found that the GIP receptor can couple to PLA2 via G protein βγ subunits in CHO-K1 cells, whereas neither glucose nor GIP-stimulated arachidonic release or insulin secretion were dependent on Gβγ subunit signaling in βTC-3 cells (Fig. 4). This is in contrast to their involvement in K+- and bombesin-stimulated insulin secretion in HIT-T15 cells (34Zhang H. Yasrebi-Nejad H. Lang J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 424: 202-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Further studies are needed to determine whether Gβγ subunits are involved in GIP receptor-effector coupling in other targets such as the stomach, fat, or the adrenal gland (49McIntosh C. Pederson R. Koop H. Brown J. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1981; 59: 468-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 50McIntosh C. Bremsak I. Lynn F.C. Gill R. Hinke S.A. Gelling R. Nian C. McKnight G. Jaspers S. Pederson R.A. Endocrinology. 1998; 140: 398-404Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 51Lacroix A. Bolté E. Tremblay J. Dupré J. Poitras P. Fournier H. Garon J. Garrel D. Bayard R. Taillefer R. Flanagan R. Hamet P. N. Engl. J. Med. 1992; 327: 974-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Glucose-, GIP-, and ATP-stimulated AA release were all shown to be independent of extracellular Ca2+, indicating that they are likely acting on a similar iPLA2 isoform. Recently cholecystokinin, another insulinotropic peptide, was also shown to activate islet PLA2 independently of extracellular Ca2+ (52Simonsson E. Karlsson S. Ahren B. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1436-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Despite a complete ablation of insulin release under Ca2+-free (extracellular) conditions, intracellular cAMP levels were still stimulated by GIP (Fig. 8 c), implying that this may be the proximal messenger to AA release. A reduction in basal cAMP production is likely attributable to a decrease in basal Ca2+-activated adenylyl cyclase activity, therefore accounting for the reduction in GIP stimulated cAMP. From these observations it therefore seems likely that both GIP-stimulated cAMP and AA production are proximal signaling events independent of glucose and extracellular Ca2+ but insufficient to elicit insulin exocytosis. However, these signaling intermediates may play more direct roles in the actions of GIP under euglycemic conditions, such as those in the adipocyte (50McIntosh C. Bremsak I. Lynn F.C. Gill R. Hinke S.A. Gelling R. Nian C. McKnight G. Jaspers S. Pederson R.A. Endocrinology. 1998; 140: 398-404Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In islets, glucose stimulation can elevate endogenously generated AA from the micromolar range to cellular concentrations of 50–200 μm, as measured by mass spectrometry (48Simonsson E. Ahren B. Int. J. Pancreatol. 2000; 27: 1-11Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In agreement with work published by Metz (53Metz S.A. Diabetes. 1988; 37: 1453-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), exogenous AA over this range was able to stimulate insulin release from βTC-3 cells in the presence of glucose. However, in its absence, responsiveness to AA was reduced at least 10-fold. Interestingly, application of exogenous AA has been shown to elevate intracellular Ca2+ concentrations in pancreatic islets (53Metz S.A. Diabetes. 1988; 37: 1453-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and there is considerable evidence suggesting a role for arachidonic acid itself or its metabolites in the regulation of capacitive and noncapacitive Ca2+ influx in a number of cellular systems (54Osterhout J.L. Shuttleworth T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8248-8254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 55Rzigalinski B.A. Willoughby K.A. Hoffman S.W. Falck J.R. Ellis E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 175-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Thus, it is tempting to speculate that fluxes in free endogenous AA, brought about by GIP, may play an integral role in regulating intracellular Ca2+concentrations and thereby influence insulin secretion. Our studies indicate that the mediation of GIP-stimulated PLA2 activity probably occurs via cAMP actions in the β-cell. Because the specific iPLA2 inhibitor HELSS ablated insulin responses to glucose and thus the potentiating effect of GIP (Fig. 9) the converging actions on insulin secretion of these two secretogogues may occur distal to the formation of cAMP (by GIP) and arachidonic acid (by glucose and/or GIP). Arachidonic acid and/or its metabolites may therefore be mainly involved in the fine tuning of the insulin response. The actions of cAMP could be direct, via activation of small G proteins (e.g. Rap), or through a guanine nucleotide exchange factor; however, the involvement of protein kinase A is unlikely (Fig. 7). These results are in contrast to a recent study demonstrating an inhibitory affect of cAMP and incretins (GIP and GLP-1) on CCK-8-stimulated arachidonic acid production and insulin release in the rodent islet (56Simonsson E. Karlsson S. Ahren B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 269: 242-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). However, implicit in studies conducted with isolated islets is the existence of paracrine and endocrine interactions between α-, δ-, and PP cells that contribute to a functional response. This may account for the different responses observed in the clonal cell line used in the present study. Finally, in the current study, production of AA was assessed by measuring the total radioactivity secreted from βTC-3 cells. Although it has been shown in studies on tumor β-cell lines that a surprisingly small percentage of released radioactivity consists of metabolites (48Simonsson E. Ahren B. Int. J. Pancreatol. 2000; 27: 1-11Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a recent study suggested a role for lipooxygenase-12 metabolites in β-cell function (57Owada S. Larsson O. Arkhammer P. Katz A.I. Chibalin A.V. Berggren P. Bertorello A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2000-2008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Further studies need to be conducted to discriminate between AA and its metabolites produced by GIP stimulation of the β-cell. We thank Dr. R. J. Lefkowitz for the pRK5 vector and βARKct construct, Simon Hinke for insight into the manuscript, and Cuilan Nian for technical support on this project."

The system N amino acid transporter mostly mediates the transport of l-glutamine,l-histidine, and l-asparagine across cell membranes. Glutamine is the most abundant free amino acid in both plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (8Fishman R.A. Cerebrospinal Fluid in Diseases of the Nervous System. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia1992: 233-236Google Scholar). Glutamine serves as a precursor for other amino acids during protein synthesis. Moreover, transport of glutamine is essential for nitrogen metabolism and synaptic transmission (9Burger H.-J. Gebhardt R. Mayer C. Mecke D.

System N has been shown to be important in transporting glutamine for the control of nitrogen metabolism in the liver (9Burger H.-J. Gebhardt R. Mayer C. Mecke D.

Furthermore, in that organ, glutamine is a central intermediate in the detoxification of ammonia and the production of urea (13Bender D.A. Amino Acid Metabolism. John Wiley and Sons, London1975: 1-34Google Scholar). Accordingly, we have observed that there is a graded distribution of mNAT expression from the central vein to the portal tract (5Gu S. Roderick H.L. Camacho P. Jiang J.X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2000; 97: 3230-3235Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In the nervous system, glutamine serves as a precursor for the synaptic transmitter, glutamate, both in glutamatergic neurons in the brain (11Hamberger A.C. Chiang G.H. Nylen E.S. Scheff S.W. Cotman C.W. Brain Res. 1979; 168: 513-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar,12Thanki C.M. Sugden D. Thomas A.J. Bradford H.F. J.

Neurochem. 1978; 31: 1069-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The N-system transporter, SN1, and the ASC system transporter, ASCT2, are expressed in astroglial cells, and ASCT2 plays a role in the export of glutamine from these cells (6Chaudhry F.A. Reimer R.J.

Dimmer K.S. Wagner C.A. Lang F. Broer S. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 2184-2194PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that either one or both of these two transporters mediate the export of glutamine in glial cells. The glutamine released by glial cells is then transported to glutamatergic neuronal cells where glutamine is converted to glutamate (16van den Berg C.J. Garfinkel D. Biochem. J. 1971; 123: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 17Kennedy A.J. Voaden M.J. Marshall J. Nature. 1974; 252: 50-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).

Hence, glutamine serves as a precursor for the generation of glutamate in these cells by maintaining the glutamate-glutamine cycle (19Poitry S. Poitry-Yamate C. Ueberfeld J. MacLeish P.R.

To identify new member(s) of the N-system transporters, we performed reverse transcription-PCR using primers based on known N-system amino acid transporter sequences to screen the RNAs isolated from mouse tissues. In this study, we report the characterization of a mouse N-system transporter, mNAT2. mNAT2 was found to be predominantly expressed in mouse retina and brain. Its specific expression in the axons of ganglion cells and its selective transport properties suggest that this transporter plays a key role in generation of glutamate and in the maintenance of retinal homeostasis and function. mMESSAGE mMACHINE for in vitrotranscription was obtained from Ambion (Austin, TX).

To obtain the cDNA sequence, polyadenylated RNA was isolated using a mRNA Separator kit (CLONTECH). mRNA was converted to single-stranded cDNA by oligo(dT) and Superscript reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). Several primer pairs were designed based on the homology between the conserved regions of the available N-system transporters, mNAT (AF159856),g17 (U49082), transporter in Arabidopsis (U39782) and transposase in Pseudomonas stutzeri (AF039534). After PCR amplification over 30 cycles with annealing temperatures of 40 °C, one of the primer pairs (sense primer, 5′-GGTTGCGACAATGTCTGTTAGGAC-3′; antisense primer, 5′-CGTGGGTCGTGAGATGTAGCAC-3′) generated a 0.5-kb DNA fragment from mouse brain cDNA. After sequencing (DNA Sequencing Facility, University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio), this fragment showed homology to mNAT and g17. A mouse brain cDNA was prepared using the Marathon-cDNA kit (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. Based on the sequence obtained from this 0.5-kb PCR fragment, two unique primers were designed: 5′-TACACCATGCAGCCGGTTTC-3′ to amplify the additional 5′ sequence and 5′-GCAAGTTCATCTCAGATCGGGA-3′ to amplify further the 3′ sequence of this new gene. Subsequently, based on the newly generated additional sequence, ten specific primers were used to generate a complete ORF sequence of mNAT2. Northern blots were performed as described (21Jiang J.X.

This fragment was inserted into the expression vector, pGEX-2T. The recombinant fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia coli, induced by isopropyl-thio-β-d-galactoside, and isolated with GST beads. The purified fusion protein was used to raise polyclonal antisera in chicken (Pocono Rabbit Farm and Laboratory Inc., Canadensis, PA). The antisera generated were affinity-purified by passage through two Sepharose CL-4B columns, GST-conjugated and GST-mNAT2 fusion protein-conjugated, respectively. Crude membrane extracts were prepared from Xenopus oocytes and mouse tissues, including retina, liver, brain, and testis as previous described (5Gu S. Roderick H.L. Camacho P. Jiang J.X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2000; 97: 3230-3235Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 21Jiang J.X. White T.W. Goodenough D.A. Paul D.L. Mol. Biol.

Oocyte homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min to discard the yolk. The supernatant of oocyte homogenates and mouse tissue homogenates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. The membrane pellet was collected, and protein concentration was determined using the Micro BCA Protein Reagent Assay kit (Pierce). Twenty micrograms of protein were loaded and separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was probed with a 1:200 dilution of affinity-purified preimmune and anti-mNAT2 antibodies. The primary antibody was detected using 1:1000 dilution of alkaline phosphatase-conjugated rabbit anti-chicken secondary antibody. The immunofluorescence detection of mNAT2 was performed as described previously (23Jiang J.X. White T.W. Goodenough D.A. Dev. Biol. 1995; 168: 649-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Oocytes and retinal tissue samples were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 2 h, incubated in 30% sucrose in phosphate buffered saline at 4 °C overnight, embedded in OCT, and then frozen in liquid nitrogen. Frozen sections (10-μm thickness) were fixed in acetone at −20 °C for 5 min, incubated with blocking solution (2% normal goat serum, 0.25% Triton X-100, 2% fish skin gelatin, and 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate buffered saline) for 30 min and then with affinity-purified preimmune or anti-mNAT2 (1:100 dilution in blocking solution) at 4 °C overnight. The primary antibodies were detected by fluorescein (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-chicken Ig (1:500 dilution) for 2 h at room temperature. Mouse retinal sections were double-labeled with propidium iodide (2 μm) and anti-mNAT2 antibody followed by FITC-conjugated goat anti-chicken secondary antibody. The specimens were analyzed using a confocal laser scanning microscope (model: Fluoview, Olympus). FITC fluorescence was excited at 488 nm by an argon laser and propidium iodide was excited at 543 nm with a HeNe-G laser. The emission filters used were: BA505–525 for FITC fluorescence, BA610 for propidium iodide, and BA660 for phase-contrast. To prepare cRNA for oocyte injection, cDNAs were synthesized by PCR and subcloned between the 5′- and 3′-flanking sequences of theXenopus β-globin gene of a Xenopus expression vector as described previously (24John L.M. Lechleiter J.D. Camacho P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 963-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The primer pairs used to amplify the entire ORF of mNAT2 were designed with a restriction siteEcoRI at the 5′-end and HindIII at 3′-end; sense primer, 5′-ACGGAATTCAAGATGATGCATTTCAAAAGTGG-3′; antisense primer, 5′-ATCGAAGCTTCAGTGGCCTTCGTC-3′. PCR products were purified and digested with EcoRI and HindIII before subcloning into the Xenopus expression vector. The constructs were confirmed by sequencing. The plasmids were linearized withNotI and in vitro transcribed by T7 RNA polymerase using mMESSAGE mMACHINE. Capped cRNA was extracted with phenol/CHCl3, precipitated with ethanol as described (24John L.M. Lechleiter J.D. Camacho P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 963-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), resuspended in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated H2O at a concentration of 1.5–2.0 μg/μl and stored at −80 °C prior to use. Stage V–VI oocytes from Xenopus laevis were dissected and injected with 50 nl of the synthetic cRNA or diethyl pyrocarbonate-H2O as a control. After 3 days of incubation at 18 °C, functional analyses were performed in groups of five to ten oocytes per assay as described previously (25Taylor P.M. Hundal H.S. Rennie M.J. J. Membr.

Oocytes were rinsed briefly in uptake buffer (KCl, 2 mm; MgCl2, 1 mm; CaCl2, 1 mm; HEPES, 10 mm; and Tris, 50 mm) in the presence of 100 mm NaCl (Na+ buffer), 100 mm choline chloride (choline+ buffer), or 100 mm LiCl (Li+ buffer). These oocytes were transferred into a 24-well culture dish containing 2 ml of uptake buffer and were incubated for 2–60 min at room temperature. Amino acid transport activities were measured by incubating oocytes in 0.5 ml of uptake buffer in the presence of 50 μml-amino acids plus corresponding 3H-labeled l-amino acids as tracers for 15 or 30 min. The oocytes were washed four times in cold uptake buffer. These oocytes were lysed in 100 μl of 2% SDS, and the radioactivity accumulated by each oocyte was measured with a scintillation counter (Beckman) in 10 ml of scintillation solution. The specificity of mNAT2-mediated amino acid uptake was examined using an amino acid competition assay. l-Glutamine uptake (50 μm) was measured in the presence of 5 mm 20 non-radioactive l-amino acids and MeAIB. The Na+ dependence and Li+ tolerance ofl-glutamine transport by mNAT2 were investigated using Na+ buffer, choline+ buffer, or Li+buffer. The effects of extracellular pH on l-glutamine uptake mediated by mNAT2 were investigated at pH 6.5–8.5 by adjusting the Na+ buffer with Tris-base or hydrochloric acid as described (26Kim J.W. Closs E. Albritton L.M. Cunningham J.M. Nature. 1991; 352: 725-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 27Taylor P.M. Mackenzie B. Low S.Y. Rennie M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3873-3877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). l-Glutamine efflux was measured as previously described (28Mastroberardino L. Spindler B. Pfeiffer R. Skelly P.J. Loffing J. Shoemaker C.B. Verrey F. Nature. 1998; 395: 288-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). An average of nine injected oocytes was incubated for 30 min in Na+ buffer containing 50 μml-[3H]glutamine. After washing in Na+ buffer containing 50 μmnon-radioactive l-glutamine, oocytes were transferred to 300 μl of Na+ buffer or Na+ buffer containing 1 mm non-radioactive l-glutamine. At each designated time, 200-μl samples were taken to determine the levels of radioactivity and fresh 200 μl of Na+ buffer or Na+ buffer containing 1 mm non-radioactivel-glutamine were added to assume the volume size of the reaction. The readings from radioactivity measurement were adjusted to compensate for the dilution factors. All experiments were repeated at least three times, and the data collected are presented as S.E. To identify member(s) of N-system transporters, we used PCR homology cloning (see “Experimental Procedures”). We screened cDNA from various mouse tissues using conserved primer pairs. One fragment of 0.5 kb was obtained from brain tissue. This fragment showed 77% nucleotide identity to mNAT (nucleotides 166–296), 78% tog17 (nucleotides 166–258), and 78% to SN1(nucleotides 161–289), suggesting that this is a new mouse amino acid transporter. Further cloning using primers derived from this PCR fragment sequence generated a complete ORF of the new gene, which encodes 485-amino acid residues (GenBank™ accession number AF184240). The alignment of amino acid sequence of mNAT2 with those of N-system transporters, mNAT, SN1, and g17, and A-system transporters, GlnT/ATA1 and ATA2 is shown in Fig. 1. mNAT2 shares 52% homology with mNAT, SN1, and g17. The homologies between mNAT2 and A-system transporters, GlnT/ATA1 and ATA2 are 97 and 50%, respectively. The first seven transmembrane domains are highly conserved between N- and A-system transporters whereas N-terminal regions are highly diverse. Based on hydrophobicity analysis (PSORT version 6, Nakai file server; TMPRED, Swiss, EMBNET; and BCM Search Launcher), mNAT2 like mNAT is a plasma membrane protein (certainty = 87%,) with a high probability of having 10 transmembrane domains (Fig. 2 A). As the deduced sequence lacks a signal peptide, the long N- and the short C-terminal tails are assumed to be in the cytoplasm (high probability score) (Fig. 2 B).Figure 2Hydrophobicity and inferred topology of mNAT2. A, hydropathy analysis of mNAT2. The two lines in the hydrophobicity plot represent the probability of the orientations: i→o represents the orientation from cytoplasmic side to extracellular side;o→i represents the opposite orientation.B, amino acid sequence and inferred structure of mNAT2. The most probable transmembrane topology of mNAT2 was deduced based on the high probability score (PSORT version 6). The amino acids conserved with mNAT are shaded.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To elucidate the tissue-specific expression of mNAT2, high stringency Northern blots of equivalent amounts of RNA isolated from various tissues were probed with a labeled mNAT2 DNA fragment. An abundance of ∼8.5 kb was detected in mouse retina and brain. Trace levels of mNAT2 expression were detected in spleen, small intestine, and lung whereas there was no detected hybridization in lens, testis, muscle, liver, kidney, and heart (Fig. 3 A). Based on the 3′- and 5′-RACE sequencing and Northern blot results, there was a 0.1-kb non-coding sequence at the 5′-end and a 7-kb non-coding sequence at the 3′-end in the extended transcript (8.5 kb). Western blot analysis with an affinity-purified mNAT2-specific antibody revealed an immunoreactive protein band that was consistent with the predicted molecular mass of Mr 52 kDaa on crude membrane fractions of brain (Fig.3 B, lane 2) and retina (lane 3). There was no detectable mNAT2 expression in testis (lane 4) and liver (lane 5). The specificity of this protein band was further ascertained by the lack of detected immunoreactivity of the retinal sample by probing with preimmune serum (lane 1). These results confirmed the observation from the Northern blot that mNAT2 was predominantly expressed in the retina and brain. Expression of mNAT2 was detected in the retina with the aid of immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. Based on the published histological illustrations of mouse retina (29Imamura Y. Noda S. Mashiam Y. Kudoh J. Oguchi Y. Shimizu N. Genomics. 1998; 51: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), the defined layers of mouse retina in our preparation were visualized in the phase-contrast image (Fig.4 A) and in the corresponding image of cell nuclear staining (Fig. 4 B). The immunofluorescence with specific antibody to mNAT2 demonstrates its predominant localization to the axons of ganglion cells in the layer of nerve fibers of the retina (Fig. 4 C). Interestingly, the localization of mNAT2 expression is consistent with that of free glutamine, which has been previously shown to occur at the highest levels in ganglion cells and their axons (30Marc R.E. Murry R.F. Basinger S.F. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 5106-5129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Kalloniatis M. Tomisich G. Prog. Retinal Eye Res. 1999; 18: 811-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). To further confirm the expression of mNAT2 in the nerve fibers of ganglion cells, we examined the localization of mNAT2 in the optic papilla (optic disc) where ganglion cell axons converge to form the optic nerve (Fig.5). mNAT2 was shown to be localized in the inner layer of the retina and in the optic nerve (Fig. 5,A and B, low magnification). The abundant expression of mNAT2 was clearly demonstrated in the strands of nerve fibers near the optic papilla and in the optic nerve bundles formed by axons of ganglion cells (Fig. 5, C and D, high magnification). No expression of mNAT2 was detected in the connective tissues surrounding the optic nerve (arrow). Together, our results from our functional analysis and expression pattern suggest that mNAT2 expressed at the axon fibers of ganglion cells is likely to participate in the uptake of glutamine in the glutamine-glutamate cycle (19Poitry S. Poitry-Yamate C. Ueberfeld J. MacLeish P.R. Tsacopoulos M. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1809-1821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Figure 5Expression of mNAT2 in the mouse optic nerve. The diagram shown in the inset to theleft illustrates the optic papilla region in the retina. A frozen section of adult mouse retina around this region was labeled with anti-mNAT2 antibody (1:200 dilution) followed by FITC-conjugated secondary antibody (1:500 dilution). The images shown are as the following: A (phase-contrast) and B(fluorescence) at low magnification. Bar, 100 μm.

Using an affinity-purified mNAT2 antibody, expression of mNAT2 was detected by immunofluorescence and immunoblot analysis as early as 24 h following cRNA injection. Three days after injection, mNAT2 protein was mainly localized in the oocyte plasma membrane, whereas positive signals were undetectable with an affinity-purified preimmune antibody (Fig. 6 A). The anti-mNAT2 antibody did not detect positive signals in oocytes injected with water (data not shown). By Western blotting using mNAT2 antibody, a protein band, ≈52 kDa was detected in mNAT2 cRNA-injected oocytes (Fig.6 B, lane 1), which was undetectable in water-injected control oocytes (lane 2). No immunoreactive bands could be detected in mNAT2-expressing oocytes using preimmune antibody (lane 3). The uptake of 3H-labeled l-alanine,l-glutamine, l-glutamate,l-histidine, and l-lysine, representing groups of zwitterionic, anionic, and cationic amino acids, was measured inXenopus oocyte system. Compared with control water-injected oocytes, mNAT2-expressing oocytes exhibited uptake ofl-glutamine most strongly, followed byl-histidine and l-alanine. A modest increase inl-lysine uptake was observed, whereas there was no increase in l-glutamate uptake (Fig.7 A). These results demonstrate that the most favorable substrate for mNAT2 is l-glutamine followed by l-histidine and l-alanine and suggest that mNAT2 has similar transporting substrate selectivity as the other N-system transporters, mNAT, SN1, and g17 (5Gu S.

Previously, galactosyl ceramide 3â€˛-sulfotransferase, which forms a sulfatide, sulfoâ†’3Galâ†’ceramide, has been cloned based on the amino acid sequence of purified protein (16Honke K. Tsuda M.

Because this enzyme, which we now term Gal3ST-1, is thought not to add a sulfate to glycoproteins (17Lo-Guidice J. Perini J. Lafitte J. Ducourouble M. Roussel P. Lamblin G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27544-27550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), galactose 3-O-sulfotransferase was molecularly cloned by searching for an enzyme homologous to Gal3ST-1. This reported enzyme, which we now term Gal3ST-2, has the unique property of adding a sulfate on both type 1 and type 2 oligosaccharides and core1O-glycans, GalÎ˛1â†’3GalNAcÎ±1â†’R (18Honke K.

On the other hand, the structures of O-linked oligosaccharides containing 3â€˛-sulfo galactose reported to date show that 3â€˛-sulfo galactose is present in N-acetyllactosamine in core2O-glycans, sulfoâ†’3GalÎ˛1â†’4GlcNAcÎ˛1â†’6(GalÎ˛1â†’3)GalNAcÎ±1â†’R (19Lamblin G.

Moreover, no 3â€˛-sulfo galactose in core1 O-glycans such as sulfoâ†’3GalÎ˛1â†’ 3GalNAcÎ±1â†’R has been previously reported. Similarly, galactose 3-O-sulfotransferase in human respiratory mucosa was found to act exclusively onN-acetyllactosamine in core2-branched O-glycans and not on core1 O-glycans (17Lo-Guidice J.

The presence of 3â€˛-sulfo galactose in N-glycans has been extensively studied in human, bovine, and porcine thyroglobulins, and these studies showed that 3â€˛-sulfo galactose is present in N-acetyllactosamine in complex N-glycans (22Edge A. Spiro R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 4710-4713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Spiro R.G. Bhoyroo V.D. J. Biol.

Chem. 1991; 266: 4237-4243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Notably, galactose 3-O-sulfotransferase present in the thyroid was found to act only on N-acetyllactosamine but not on type 1 oligosaccharides, which differs from the properties of Gal3ST-2 (25Kato Y. Spiro R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3364-3371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although no glycoprotein acceptor was tested for Gal3ST-2, these results suggested that there is another galactose 3-O-sulfotransferase (Gal3ST) yet to be identified.In the present study, we first identified a novel cDNA by screening the EST data base for cDNAs related to human Gal3ST-1 (16Honke K. Tsuda M. Hirahara Y. Ishii A. Makita A. Wada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4864-4868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The expression of a full-length cDNA revealed that this cDNA encodes a novel galactose 3-O-sulfotransferase, termed Gal3ST-3, that adds a sulfate exclusively in the 3â€˛-position of galactose in N-acetyllactosamine in both N- andO-glycans but not on a type 1 GalÎ˛1â†’3GlcNAc or core1 GalÎ˛1â†’3GalNAc structure. When CD43 (leukosialin) was tested as an acceptor, Gal3ST-3 preferentially acted onN-acetyllactosamine present in core2-branchedO-glycans, whereas Gal3ST-2 acted on both core1- and core2-branched O-glycans. Moreover, we show that this novel enzyme is expressed almost exclusively in the thyroid, kidney, and brain, in contrast to the previously reported ubiquitous expression of Gal3ST-2 (18Honke K.

Chem. 2001; 276: 267-274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONThe present study describes the isolation of a novel cDNA encoding galactose 3-O-sulfotransferase by searching the EST data base for cDNAs homologous to the human galactosyl ceramide 3-O-sulfotransferase, Gal3ST-1 (16Honke K. Tsuda M. Hirahara Y. Ishii A. Makita A. Wada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4864-4868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Gal3ST-1 adds a sulfate to a Î˛-galactose residue linked to ceramide, whereas Gal3ST-3 adds a sulfate to a Î˛-galactose linked to N-acetylglucosamine through a 1,4-linkage. Previously, Gal3ST-2 was also cloned based on its similarity to Gal3ST-1, but the acceptor specificities of Gal3ST-2 and Gal3ST-3 differ substantially. Although Gal3ST-3 acts exclusively on N-acetyllactosamine, Gal3ST-2 can act also on type 1 oligosaccharide, GalÎ˛1â†’ 3GlcNAc, and core1 oligosaccharide, GalÎ˛1â†’3(GlcNAcÎ˛1â†’ 6)GalNAc. On the other hand, Gal3ST-3 can act on GalÎ˛1â†’ 4(sulfoâ†’6)GlcNAcÎ˛1â†’R, but Gal3ST-2 cannot act on the same acceptor (Fig. 3). Interestingly, the best acceptor for Gal3ST-3 is poly-N-acetyllactosamine attached to a side chain derived from C-6 of Î±-mannose, whereas the best acceptor for Gal3ST-2 is N-acetyllactosamine attached to a side chain derived from C-2 of Î±-mannose (Fig. 3). Moreover, Gal3ST-3 preferentially acts on N-acetyllactosamine attached to anN-glycan mannose core, such as GalÎ˛1â†’4GlcNAcÎ˛1â†’6ManÎ±1â†’6ManÎ˛1â†’octyl, than onN-acetyllactosamine itself, whereas Gal3ST-2 does not possess this preference (Fig. 3). These results indicate that Gal3ST-2 and Gal3ST-3 act differentially on various acceptor glycoproteins.In the present study, the transcripts of Gal3ST-3 were found to be expressed selectively in the brain, kidney, and thyroid. Previously, it was reported that human thyroglobulin contains a sulfoâ†’3GalÎ˛1â†’4GlcNAcÎ˛1â†’R structure in the majority ofN-glycans (23Spiro R.G. Bhoyroo V.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14351-14358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This 3â€˛-O-sulfatedN-acetyllactosamine side chain was shown to exist in both bi-antennary and highly branched tri- and tetra-antennaryN-glycans. In porcine thyroglobulin, the majority of sulfoâ†’3GalÎ˛1â†’4GlcNAcÎ˛1â†’R are present in side chains derived from the 6-position of Î±-mannose. Moreover, the same glycoprotein contains a GalÎ˛1â†’4(sulfoâ†’6)GlcNAc side chain in a portion of the N-glycans (24Waard P.D. Koorevaar A. Kamerling J.P. Vliegenthart J.F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4237-4243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown previously, sulfoâ†’6GlcNAcâ†’R is first formed from a GlcNAcâ†’R structure and then converted to GalÎ˛1â†’4(sulfoâ†’6)GlcNAcâ†’R (11Hiraoka N. Petryniak B. Nakayama J. Tsuboi S. Suzuki M.

GalÎ˛1â†’4(sulfoâ†’6)GlcNAcâ†’R can then be converted by Gal3ST-3 to sulfoâ†’3GalÎ˛1â†’4(sulfoâ†’6)GlcNAcâ†’R, considering that Gal3ST-3 can act on GalÎ˛1â†’4(sulfoâ†’6)GlcNAcâ†’R. In the structural studies described above, no multisulfated N-glycans were analyzed (24Waard P.D. Koorevaar A. Kamerling J.P. Vliegenthart J.F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4237-4243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that sulfoâ†’3GalÎ˛1â†’4(sulfoâ†’6)GlcNAcâ†’R may be found with further analysis of highly sulfated N-glycans in thyroglobulin.It has been reported that a major glycoprotein in calf thyroid contains core2-branched O-glycans (44Edge A.S.B. Spiro R.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 343: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and that core2 branches in the thyroid are likely synthesized by C2GnT-1 and C2GnT-2 (45Yeh J.-C. Ong E. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3215-3221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 46Schwientek T. Nomoto M. Levery S.B. Merkx G. van Kessel A.G. Bennett E.P. Hollingsworth M.A. Clausen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4504-4512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Core2-branched oligosaccharides from calf thyroid apparently lack 3â€˛-sulfate galactose. In contrast to human thyroglobulin, the presence of 3â€˛-sulfate galactose in calf thyroglobulin is minimal, presumably due to the competition with the strong Î±1,3-galactosyltransferase activity in calf thyroid (44Edge A.S.B. Spiro R.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 343: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that galactose 3-O-sulfotransferase in the thyroid acts only onN-acetyllactosamine as does Gal3ST-3 (25Kato Y. Spiro R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3364-3371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results indicate that Gal3ST-3 is most likely responsible for the formation of sulfoâ†’ 3GalÎ˛1â†’4GlcNAc attached to bothN-glycans and core2- branched O-glycans synthesized in the thyroid.Although it was reported that the transcripts of Gal3ST-2 are expressed in various tissues, the amount of transcripts was relatively low in brain and kidney when estimated by reverse transcription PCR (18Honke K. Tsuda M. Koyota S. Wada Y. Iida-Tanaka N. Ishizuka I. Nakayama J. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 267-274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Because the transcripts of Gal3ST-3, on the other hand, are highly expressed in brain and kidney, it is likely that GalST-3 plays a major role in the brain and kidney in addition to the thyroid. Previously, the existence of two different galactosyl 3-O-sulfotransferases has been reported: one (A) acts on core1 O-glycans, whereas the other (B) acts onN-acetyllactosamine (47Chandrasekaran E.V. Jain R.K. Vig R. Matta K.L. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 753-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 48Kuhns W. Jain R.K. Matta K.L. Paulsen H. Baker M. Geyer R. Brockhausen I. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 689-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Although it is not straightforward to correlate these findings with the acceptor specificities of the cloned enzymes, it appears that A and B correspond to Gal3ST-2 and Gal3ST-3, respectively. On the other hand, the acceptor specificity of Gal3ST-3 appears to be identical to the enzyme described in human airways (17Lo-Guidice J. Perini J. Lafitte J. Ducourouble M. Roussel P. Lamblin G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27544-27550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), whereas Gal3ST-2, which acts on type 1 oligosaccharides, is most likely responsible for the formation of sulfoâ†’3GalÎ˛1â†’3(FucÎ±1â†’4)GlcNAcÎ˛1â†’R (4Yuen C.-T.

Ikehara Y. Narimatsu H. Irimura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 374-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).It has been reported that the sulfoâ†’3GalÎ˛1â†’4(FucÎ±1â†’ 3)GlcNAcâ†’R structure serves as an E-selectin ligand (4Yuen C.-T.

The same oligosaccharide was, on the other hand, shown to be a ligand for P-selectin but not for E-selectin when a synthetic oligosaccharide attached to GDP-fucose was transferred to the cell surface (5Tsuboi S. Srivastava O.P. Palcic M. Hindsgaul O. Fukuda M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 374: 100-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that 6-sulfo sialyl Lewis x, NeuNAcÎ±2â†’3GalÎ˛1â†’4[FucÎ±1â†’3(sulfoâ†’6)]GlcNAcÎ˛1â†’R, is a potent physiological ligand for L-selectin (11Hiraoka N. Petryniak B.

It will be of significance to determine if a 3â€˛-sulfate analogue, sulfoâ†’3GalÎ˛1â†’4[FucÎ±1â†’3(sulfoâ†’6)]GlcNAcÎ˛1â†’R, also serves as an L-selectin ligand. Considering the specificity of Gal3ST-3, sulfation should occur first onN-acetylglucosamine and then on galactose, forming sulfoâ†’3GalÎ˛1â†’4(sulfoâ†’6)GlcNAcÎ˛1â†’R. This product would then be converted to sulfoâ†’3GalÎ˛1â†’4[FucÎ±1â†’3(sulfoâ†’6)]GlcNAc by Î±1,3-fucosyltransferase. It is anticipated that all of these different oligosaccharides containing 3â€˛-sulfo galactose can be synthesized in cells with the necessary cDNAs, including those encoding Gal3ST-3.In this context, it is noteworthy that Gal3ST-3 has a relatively narrow acceptor specificity compared with Gal3ST-2. Due to this distinct acceptor specificity, it is likely that the expression of Gal3ST-3 results in the formation of sulfoâ†’3GalÎ˛1â†’4GlcNAcâ†’R and related structures in a well-defined set of carbohydrates attached to glycoproteins. It is thus expected that the cDNA encoding Gal3ST-3, cloned in the present study, will be a powerful tool to determine the structure/function of sulfoâ†’3GalÎ˛1â†’4GlcNAcâ†’R and related structures. Sulfate groups in carbohydrates play important roles in conferring highly specific functions on glycoproteins, glycolipids, and proteoglycans (1Fiete D. Srivastave V. Hindsgaul O. Baenziger J.U.

One of these sulfated glycans is 3â€˛-sulfo galactose attached to a type 2 oligosaccharide (N-acetyllactosamine), sulfoâ†’3GalÎ˛1â†’4GlcNAcâ†’R, or attached to a type 1 oligosaccharide, sulfoâ†’3GalÎ˛1â†’3GlcNAcâ†’R. Feizi and colleagues (4Yuen C.-T. Lawson A.M. Chai W. Larkin M. Stoll M.S. Stuart A.C. Sullivan F.X. Ahern T.J. Feizi T. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9126-9131Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) demonstrated that 3â€˛-sulfo galactose, in a type 1 or type 2, fucosylated oligosaccharide, functions as an E-selectin ligand (4Yuen C.-T.

When oligosaccharides were released from ovarian cystadenoma glycoprotein and conjugated to lipids, sulfoâ†’3GalÎ˛1â†’3/4(FucÎ±1â†’4/3)GlcNAcÎ˛1â†’3Gal was found to bind to Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)1 cells expressing E-selectin (4Yuen C.-T.

On the other hand, sulfoâ†’3GalÎ˛1â†’4(FucÎ±1â†’3)GlcNAc acted as a P-selectin ligand when a synthetic oligosaccharide with this structure was transferred to cell surface glycoproteins through a fucose residue by Î±1,3-fucosyltransferase III (5Tsuboi S. Srivastava O.P. Palcic M. Hindsgaul O. Fukuda M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 374: 100-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that 3â€˛-sulfo galactose on the cell surface plays a role in carbohydrate-protein interactions, including those involved with selectin. Recently, a comparison of the amino acid sequences of cloned sulfotransferases demonstrated that there is a weak but discernible homologous sequence motif among Golgi-associated sulfotransferases (6Ong E.

In particular, the amino acid sequences that are responsible for binding 5â€˛-phosphosulfate and 3â€˛-phosphate groups of the donor substrate, 3â€˛-phosphoadenosine 5â€˛-phosphosulfate (PAPS), are well conserved and are often highly homologous to each other among those that share the same acceptor specificity (10Uchimura K.

The presence of 3â€˛-sulfo galactose in N-glycans has been extensively studied in human, bovine, and porcine thyroglobulins, and these studies showed that 3â€˛-sulfo galactose is present in N-acetyllactosamine in complex N-glycans (22Edge A. Spiro R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 4710-4713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Spiro R.G. Bhoyroo V.D. J. Biol.

Chem. 1991; 266: 4237-4243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Notably, galactose 3-O-sulfotransferase present in the thyroid was found to act only on N-acetyllactosamine but not on type 1 oligosaccharides, which differs from the properties of Gal3ST-2 (25Kato Y. Spiro R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3364-3371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although no glycoprotein acceptor was tested for Gal3ST-2, these results suggested that there is another galactose 3-O-sulfotransferase (Gal3ST) yet to be identified. In the present study, we first identified a novel cDNA by screening the EST data base for cDNAs related to human Gal3ST-1 (16Honke K. Tsuda M. Hirahara Y. Ishii A. Makita A. Wada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4864-4868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The expression of a full-length cDNA revealed that this cDNA encodes a novel galactose 3-O-sulfotransferase, termed Gal3ST-3, that adds a sulfate exclusively in the 3â€˛-position of galactose in N-acetyllactosamine in both N- andO-glycans but not on a type 1 GalÎ˛1â†’3GlcNAc or core1 GalÎ˛1â†’3GalNAc structure. When CD43 (leukosialin) was tested as an acceptor, Gal3ST-3 preferentially acted onN-acetyllactosamine present in core2-branchedO-glycans, whereas Gal3ST-2 acted on both core1- and core2-branched O-glycans. Moreover, we show that this novel enzyme is expressed almost exclusively in the thyroid, kidney, and brain, in contrast to the previously reported ubiquitous expression of Gal3ST-2 (18Honke K. Tsuda M. Koyota S. Wada Y. Iida-Tanaka N. Ishizuka I. Nakayama J. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 267-274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). DISCUSSIONThe present study describes the isolation of a novel cDNA encoding galactose 3-O-sulfotransferase by searching the EST data base for cDNAs homologous to the human galactosyl ceramide 3-O-sulfotransferase, Gal3ST-1 (16Honke K. Tsuda M. Hirahara Y. Ishii A. Makita A. Wada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4864-4868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Gal3ST-1 adds a sulfate to a Î˛-galactose residue linked to ceramide, whereas Gal3ST-3 adds a sulfate to a Î˛-galactose linked to N-acetylglucosamine through a 1,4-linkage. Previously, Gal3ST-2 was also cloned based on its similarity to Gal3ST-1, but the acceptor specificities of Gal3ST-2 and Gal3ST-3 differ substantially. Although Gal3ST-3 acts exclusively on N-acetyllactosamine, Gal3ST-2 can act also on type 1 oligosaccharide, GalÎ˛1â†’ 3GlcNAc, and core1 oligosaccharide, GalÎ˛1â†’3(GlcNAcÎ˛1â†’ 6)GalNAc. On the other hand, Gal3ST-3 can act on GalÎ˛1â†’ 4(sulfoâ†’6)GlcNAcÎ˛1â†’R, but Gal3ST-2 cannot act on the same acceptor (Fig. 3). Interestingly, the best acceptor for Gal3ST-3 is poly-N-acetyllactosamine attached to a side chain derived from C-6 of Î±-mannose, whereas the best acceptor for Gal3ST-2 is N-acetyllactosamine attached to a side chain derived from C-2 of Î±-mannose (Fig. 3). Moreover, Gal3ST-3 preferentially acts on N-acetyllactosamine attached to anN-glycan mannose core, such as GalÎ˛1â†’4GlcNAcÎ˛1â†’6ManÎ±1â†’6ManÎ˛1â†’octyl, than onN-acetyllactosamine itself, whereas Gal3ST-2 does not possess this preference (Fig. 3). These results indicate that Gal3ST-2 and Gal3ST-3 act differentially on various acceptor glycoproteins.In the present study, the transcripts of Gal3ST-3 were found to be expressed selectively in the brain, kidney, and thyroid. Previously, it was reported that human thyroglobulin contains a sulfoâ†’3GalÎ˛1â†’4GlcNAcÎ˛1â†’R structure in the majority ofN-glycans (23Spiro R.G. Bhoyroo V.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14351-14358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This 3â€˛-O-sulfatedN-acetyllactosamine side chain was shown to exist in both bi-antennary and highly branched tri- and tetra-antennaryN-glycans. In porcine thyroglobulin, the majority of sulfoâ†’3GalÎ˛1â†’4GlcNAcÎ˛1â†’R are present in side chains derived from the 6-position of Î±-mannose. Moreover, the same glycoprotein contains a GalÎ˛1â†’4(sulfoâ†’6)GlcNAc side chain in a portion of the N-glycans (24Waard P.D. Koorevaar A. Kamerling J.P. Vliegenthart J.F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4237-4243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown previously, sulfoâ†’6GlcNAcâ†’R is first formed from a GlcNAcâ†’R structure and then converted to GalÎ˛1â†’4(sulfoâ†’6)GlcNAcâ†’R (11Hiraoka N. Petryniak B. Nakayama J. Tsuboi S. Suzuki M.

GalÎ˛1â†’4(sulfoâ†’6)GlcNAcâ†’R can then be converted by Gal3ST-3 to sulfoâ†’3GalÎ˛1â†’4(sulfoâ†’6)GlcNAcâ†’R, considering that Gal3ST-3 can act on GalÎ˛1â†’4(sulfoâ†’6)GlcNAcâ†’R. In the structural studies described above, no multisulfated N-glycans were analyzed (24Waard P.D. Koorevaar A. Kamerling J.P. Vliegenthart J.F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4237-4243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that sulfoâ†’3GalÎ˛1â†’4(sulfoâ†’6)GlcNAcâ†’R may be found with further analysis of highly sulfated N-glycans in thyroglobulin.It has been reported that a major glycoprotein in calf thyroid contains core2-branched O-glycans (44Edge A.S.B. Spiro R.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 343: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and that core2 branches in the thyroid are likely synthesized by C2GnT-1 and C2GnT-2 (45Yeh J.-C. Ong E. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3215-3221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 46Schwientek T. Nomoto M. Levery S.B. Merkx G. van Kessel A.G. Bennett E.P. Hollingsworth M.A. Clausen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4504-4512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Core2-branched oligosaccharides from calf thyroid apparently lack 3â€˛-sulfate galactose. In contrast to human thyroglobulin, the presence of 3â€˛-sulfate galactose in calf thyroglobulin is minimal, presumably due to the competition with the strong Î±1,3-galactosyltransferase activity in calf thyroid (44Edge A.S.B. Spiro R.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 343: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that galactose 3-O-sulfotransferase in the thyroid acts only onN-acetyllactosamine as does Gal3ST-3 (25Kato Y. Spiro R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3364-3371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results indicate that Gal3ST-3 is most likely responsible for the formation of sulfoâ†’ 3GalÎ˛1â†’4GlcNAc attached to bothN-glycans and core2- branched O-glycans synthesized in the thyroid.Although it was reported that the transcripts of Gal3ST-2 are expressed in various tissues, the amount of transcripts was relatively low in brain and kidney when estimated by reverse transcription PCR (18Honke K.

Because the transcripts of Gal3ST-3, on the other hand, are highly expressed in brain and kidney, it is likely that GalST-3 plays a major role in the brain and kidney in addition to the thyroid. Previously, the existence of two different galactosyl 3-O-sulfotransferases has been reported: one (A) acts on core1 O-glycans, whereas the other (B) acts onN-acetyllactosamine (47Chandrasekaran E.V.

Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 689-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Although it is not straightforward to correlate these findings with the acceptor specificities of the cloned enzymes, it appears that A and B correspond to Gal3ST-2 and Gal3ST-3, respectively. On the other hand, the acceptor specificity of Gal3ST-3 appears to be identical to the enzyme described in human airways (17Lo-Guidice J. Perini J. Lafitte J. Ducourouble M. Roussel P. Lamblin G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27544-27550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), whereas Gal3ST-2, which acts on type 1 oligosaccharides, is most likely responsible for the formation of sulfoâ†’3GalÎ˛1â†’3(FucÎ±1â†’4)GlcNAcÎ˛1â†’R (4Yuen C.-T.

The same oligosaccharide was, on the other hand, shown to be a ligand for P-selectin but not for E-selectin when a synthetic oligosaccharide attached to GDP-fucose was transferred to the cell surface (5Tsuboi S.

Recently, it has been shown that 6-sulfo sialyl Lewis x, NeuNAcÎ±2â†’3GalÎ˛1â†’4[FucÎ±1â†’3(sulfoâ†’6)]GlcNAcÎ˛1â†’R, is a potent physiological ligand for L-selectin (11Hiraoka N. Petryniak B.

It will be of significance to determine if a 3â€˛-sulfate analogue, sulfoâ†’3GalÎ˛1â†’4[FucÎ±1â†’3(sulfoâ†’6)]GlcNAcÎ˛1â†’R, also serves as an L-selectin ligand. Considering the specificity of Gal3ST-3, sulfation should occur first onN-acetylglucosamine and then on galactose, forming sulfoâ†’3GalÎ˛1â†’4(sulfoâ†’6)GlcNAcÎ˛1â†’R. This product would then be converted to sulfoâ†’3GalÎ˛1â†’4[FucÎ±1â†’3(sulfoâ†’6)]GlcNAc by Î±1,3-fucosyltransferase. It is anticipated that all of these different oligosaccharides containing 3â€˛-sulfo galactose can be synthesized in cells with the necessary cDNAs, including those encoding Gal3ST-3.In this context, it is noteworthy that Gal3ST-3 has a relatively narrow acceptor specificity compared with Gal3ST-2. Due to this distinct acceptor specificity, it is likely that the expression of Gal3ST-3 results in the formation of sulfoâ†’3GalÎ˛1â†’4GlcNAcâ†’R and related structures in a well-defined set of carbohydrates attached to glycoproteins. It is thus expected that the cDNA encoding Gal3ST-3, cloned in the present study, will be a powerful tool to determine the structure/function of sulfoâ†’3GalÎ˛1â†’4GlcNAcâ†’R and related structures.

Here we analyse frozen samples of the suspect vaccine by using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify any HIV-1-related nucleic acids or chimpanzee mitochondrial DNA that might be present, but we have failed to detect either.

Shortly after its identification, it became a useful model for studying kidney-specific hormonal regulation of gene expression. The KAP gene exhibits androgen-dependent and -independent regulatory mechanisms in different segments of proximal tubules (2Meseguer A. Catterall J.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1987; 1: 535-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Whereas a functional androgen receptor and testosterone are required for expression in cortical S1 and S2 segments of proximal tubules, no androgen is required for expression in the medullar S3 segment (3Meseguer A.

Therefore, females, castrated males, and androgen receptor-deficient Tfm/Y males express the gene in S3 cells exclusively, whereas males and androgen-induced females also express the gene in S1/S2 cells. KAP mRNA expression in S3 cells depends on thyroid hormone (5Solé E. Calvo R. Obregón M.J. Meseguer A.

Cell specificity and the complex regulatory mechanisms involved in KAP mRNA expression, together with KAP mRNA relative abundance, point to an important role for its encoded protein.Analyses of both nucleotide and peptide sequences have failed to reveal significant homology with other genes, expressed sequence tags, or proteins or with known structural or functional domains. The absence of known functional domains has greatly reduced experimental approaches to elucidating KAP function and prompted us to perform a yeast two hybrid assay. The present work shows that KAP interacts with the CsA-binding protein CyPB, that CsA administration reduces KAP steady-state levels in mouse kidney, and that KAP overexpression reduces CsA toxicity in cultured proximal tubule cells. Thus, our data indicate a functional relationship among KAP, CyPB, and CsA-mediated toxicity in kidney.DISCUSSIONSince the first description of KAP mRNA in 1979 (1Toole J.J. Hastie N.D. Held W.A. Cell. 1979; 17: 441-448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), the identification and function of its encoded protein have remained elusive. This paper reports, for the first time, KAP identification and distribution and makes a direct attempt to gain insight into its function.The tissue and cell specificity previously reported for KAP mRNA (3Meseguer A.

Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 688-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), were further analyzed by means of the more sensitive RT-PCR/Southern technique in a wider panel of tissues. Kidney specificity and unique expression of KAP in the uterus during a short period of time prior to birth, described earlier by Kasik et al. (7Kasik J.W. Rice E.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1993; 90: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), were definitively assessed in our experiments. No functional data are available to explain the appearance of KAP mRNA in the uterus before delivery, which, for the time being, is associated with the estrogen sensitivity of the gene (6Meseguer A. Catterall J.F. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1992; 89: 153-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and the estrogenic peak that occurs at that time in this tissue (7Kasik J.W. Rice E.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1993; 90: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar).Monoclonal antibodies raised against KAP synthetic peptides specifically identified a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 20 kDa in SDS-PAGE that follows the same distribution and androgenic regulation as its encoding mRNA in epithelial cells of proximal convoluted tubules. Although the expected molecular mass for KAP (121 amino acids in length) is around 13 kDa, computational analysis of the KAP-deduced peptide sequence defined a hydrophilic and negatively charged protein (3Meseguer A. Watson C.S. Catterall F.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 962-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), which might explain the delay observed in SDS-PAGE.As our data show KAP to be a highly specific and tightly regulated kidney protein, we hypothesized that it might play an important role in the homeostatic and metabolic events of proximal tubule cells. This notion was further supported by the finding that KAP expression is up-regulated in nephrectomized mouse kidney (21Zhang H. Wada J. Kanwar Y.S. Tsuchiyama Y. Hiragushi K. Hida K. Shikata K. Makino H. Kidney Int. 1999; 56: 549-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and that its mRNA levels significantly decrease in a mouse nephrolithiasis model (22Wang L. Raikwar N. Deng L. Yang M. Liang L. Shao C. Evan A.P. Stambrook P.J. Sahota A. Tischfield J.A. Kidney Int. 2000; 58: 528-536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Because no functional or structural domains were identified on the KAP-deduced peptide sequence, we focused our efforts on the identification of proteins able to interact with KAP in vivo, which might in turn be informative of KAP function.The major finding of the present study was that KAP interacts with cyclophilin B, a member of the immunophilin family that exhibits petidyl-prolyl-cis-trans-isomerase activity and the ability to bind the potent immunosuppressor CsA (23Handschumacher R.E. Harding M.W. Rice J. Drugge R.J. Speicher D.W. Science. 1984; 226: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (1442) Google Scholar, 24Harding M.W. Handschumacher R.E. Speicher D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8547-8555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The interaction, initially observed by means of the two hybrid assay, was further confirmed by GST pull-down assays and by co-immunoprecipitation of the KAP-CyPB complex from crude kidney extracts. We found these data very interesting because the great clinical benefits of CsA on the improvement of graft survival rates in solid organ transplantation are concomitant with important undesirable nephrotoxic effects (25Bennet W.M. Burdmann E. Andor T. Elzinga L. Franceschini N. Miner. Electrolyte Metab. 1994; 20: 214-220PubMed Google Scholar). The immunosuppressive effects of CsA are known to be related to binding of the immunophilins-CsA complex to the calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine phosphatase calcineurin, which blocks, in turn, its intrinsic phosphatase activityin vitro (26Liu J. Farmer J.D. Lane W.S. Friedman J. Weissman I. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1991; 66: 807-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3567) Google Scholar). As a result, activation and translocation of the nuclear factor of activated T cells are compromised, nuclear factor of activated T cells-supported transcription of the interleukin 2 gene and other cytokine genes is abolished, and T-cell activation is inhibited. FK-506 (tacrolimus), a second T-cell immunosuppressive drug, binds to a different cellular protein, FKBP12, and the FKBP12-FK 506 complex also binds to and inhibits calcineurin (27Schreiber S.L. Crabtree G.R. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 136-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1947) Google Scholar).Whereas the molecular mechanisms involved in immunosuppression are well known, those involved in nephrotoxicity are less understood. CsA exerts its nephrotoxic effects through (i) acute changes in renal hemodynamics (28Takeshi F.A. Burdmann E.A. Bennett W.M. Semin. Nephrol. 1997; 17: 34-45PubMed Google Scholar, 29Ader J.-L.

Nephrol. 1995; 6: 999Google Scholar) preferentially in epithelial cells of the S3 segment (43Mihatsch M.J. Ryffel B. Hermle M. Brunner F.P. Thiel G. Clin. Nephrol. 1986; 25: S2-S8PubMed Google Scholar). Recent reports have concluded that CsA exerts a direct toxic effect on proximal cells by reducing DNA synthesis and cell cycle blockade (44Healy E. Dempsey M. Lally C. Ryan M.P. Kidney Int. 1998; 54: 1955-1966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), which are coincidental with elevated p53 levels (45Healy E. Lally C. Ryan M.P. Kidney Int. 1999; 56: 1254-1257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In an experimental model of chronic CsA nephrotoxicity, an increase in apoptotic specific genes has been found, and it has been proposed that increased apoptosis could explain the tubular dropout and loss of cellularity with fibrosis (46Shihab F.S. Andoh T.F. Tanner A.M. Hong Y. Bennett W.M. Kidney Int. 1999; 56: 2147-2159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar).Apart from these studies, the molecular mechanisms of CsA-induced toxicity in the kidney have not been completely established, nor has it been determined why CsA exerts its deleterious effects on the proximal tubule and preferentially on cells of the S3 segment. The cloning of a third mammalian cyclophilin, CyPC, which in contrast to the widely distributed CyPA and CyPB family members was restricted to the kidney (47Friedman J. Weissman I. Cell. 1991; 68: 799-806Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (358) Google Scholar) and preferentially expressed in proximal and straight tubules of the kidney (48Otsuka M. Terada Y. Yang T. Nonoguchi H. Tomita K. Marumo F. Kidney Int. 1994; 45: 1340-1345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), suggested the possibility that CyPC could be a mediator of the immunosuppressive and nephrotoxic actions of CsA, but no functional data have emerged supporting the initial association between CyPC restricted expression and CsA nephrotoxicity.Identification of the biologically active cyclophilins to promote T cell activation was performed in Jurkat T cells by overexpression of different cyclophilin family members co-transfected with a phosphatase reporter plasmid containing multiple copies of the nuclear factor of activated T cells or nuclear factor-interleukin 2A binding sites from the interleukin 2 enhancer (49Bram R.J. Hung D.T. Martin P.K. Schreiber S.L. Crabtree G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4760-4769Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Both CyPA and CyPB but not CyPC increase T cell sensitivity to CsA, demonstrating that CyPA and CyPB are the active immunophilins able to mediate the inhibitory effects of CsA in vivo (49Bram R.J. Hung D.T. Martin P.K. Schreiber S.L. Crabtree G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4760-4769Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). In addition to their ability to bind calcineurin, the subcellular location of each immunophilin was shown to be important for mediating inhibition of signal transduction by CsA. In this regard, deletions of CyPB and CyPC domains, which change their intracellular locations, altered their activities significantly. Although both immunophilins are located in the ER, CyPB is associated with a specialized part of the ER related to calcium activation events, which permits its activity (50Arber S. Krause K.H. Caroni P. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 113-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that the carboxyl-terminal 37 residues of CyPB were able to confer a significant gain in function on CyPC and that the converse construction lowered CyPB activity (49Bram R.J. Hung D.T. Martin P.K. Schreiber S.L. Crabtree G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4760-4769Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). This region of CyPB contains the previously characterized location signal, which could direct a foreign protein to the specialized CyPB retention site (the calcium-containing ER substructure or calciosome) (50Arber S. Krause K.H. Caroni P. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 113-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). CyPC exclusion from the calciosome may prevent it from participating in inhibition of T-cell activation. The finding that CyPB interacts with a protein involved in calcium signaling in T cells named CAML (51Bram R.J. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1994; 371: 355-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) reinforces the notion that CyPB might be involved in calcineurin activation through calcium mobilization events.Involvement of CyPA and/or CyPB in the nephrotoxic effects of CsA has not been assessed. Although a cyclophilin A knockout mouse has recently been produced, nothing is known on toxicity in these animals, 3J. Luban, personal communication. and the question as to which cyclophilin is relevant in nephrotoxicity remains open. Because FK506 exhibits the same toxic effects on kidney as CsA and the only common functional mechanism between both immunosuppressors is calcineurin inhibition, it is accepted that nephrotoxicity will also occur through the inhibition of this calcium calmodulin-dependent phosphatase. Furthermore, chemical modifications of the CsA molecule aiming at eliminating its toxicity while preserving immunosuppressive effects have failed, suggesting that both actions occur through common mechanisms (52Sigal N.H. Dumont F. Durette P. Siekirka J.J. Peterson L. Rich D.H. Dunlap B.E. Staruch M.J. Melino M.R. Koprak S.L. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 173: 619-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Taking into account the wide tissue and cell distribution of cyclophilins, the finding that a kidney-specific protein of the proximal tubule interacts with CyPB (the CyP that shows the highest affinity for CsA (53Schneider H. Charara N. Schmitz R. Wehrli S. Mikol V. Zurini M.G.M. Quesniaux V.F.J. Movva N.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8218-8224Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and the highest expression levels in kidney (54Kainer D.B. Doris P.A. Hypertension. 2000; 35: 958-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar)) was suggestive of a putative new molecular pathway of CsA-mediated toxicity in this tissue. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments and co-location within the cell demonstrate that both proteins reside in the same subcellular compartment. Definition of KAP and CyPB interacting domains by means of two hybrid assays determined that the C-terminal domain of CyPB is responsible for interaction. This result was further confirmed in the co-immunoprecipitation assays in which we failed to detect KAP when the immunoprecipitation was performed with an antibody that specifically recognizes the C-terminal end of CyPB. As mentioned previously, this is the domain responsible for CyPB sublocation to the calciosome in the ER and the domain that is highly conserved in CyPBs from different species and not present in other cyclophilins. Interaction of KAP and CyPB was not prevented by CsA, which concurs with the fact that domains for CsA binding and peptidyl-prolyl-cis-trans-isomerase (PPiase) activity are in the middle of the protein (55Mikol V. Kallen J. Walkinshaw M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5183-5186Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and that KAP-CyPB interaction takes place at the C-terminal domain.Apart from being located in the endoplasmic reticulum, CyPB has also been found in the plasma membrane and secreted to the medium (56Price E.R. Jin M. Lim D. Pati S. Walsh C.T. McKeon F.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3931-3935Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Confocal microscopy performed in cultured proximal tubule cells in this study demonstrated that endogenous CyPB in these cells is located in the expected cellular compartments, i.e. the ER and the plasma membrane. Interestingly, we observed that for cells transiently transfected with a GFP-KAP fusion protein expression vector, the overlay of KAP and CyPB shows a perfect co-location for both proteins, and that in the presence of higher KAP levels in these transfected cells, endogenous CyPB is located intracellularly rather than in the plasma membrane. This observation suggests that by interacting with CyPB, KAP might contribute to retaining this cyclophilin in the ER compartment with possible implications on CyPB function, particularly if we take into consideration that CsA promotes the secretion of CyPB out of the cell (56Price E.R. Jin M. Lim D. Pati S. Walsh C.T. McKeon F.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3931-3935Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In a different set of experiments, we clearly demonstrated that CsA significantly diminishes KAP levels in crude kidney extracts, preferentially in the most sensitive site of CsA toxicity, the S3 segment of the proximal tubules. We do not yet know whether CsA promotes KAP degradation or its secretion out of the cell as it does for CyPB, but the fact is that KAP decreases in the kidney in the presence of CsA. If we hypothesize that in physiological conditions KAP contributes to CyPB being retained in the ER, suboptimal KAP levels upon CsA treatment might prompt the secretion of CyPB out of the cell, thereby lowering the CyPB reservoir in the reticulum, which might impair calcium mobilization and, finally, calcineurin activation.With this in mind, we aimed at observing the effect of KAP overexpression on CsA-mediated toxicity in PKSV-PCT cells. It was remarkable to observe that in three independently stably transfected clones, selected by their ability to induce KAP expression in a tetracycline-dependent manner, CsA-induced toxicity was significantly diminished when KAP expression was permitted. It is important to point out that because the cells were stably rather than transiently transfected, the levels of KAP expression were not much higher than the basal levels, and consequently, the effect of KAP expression was highly relevant in diminishing toxicity. Although overexpression and knocking out of the KAP gene in whole animals will be required to demonstrate that KAP may protect against CsA toxicityin vivo, the experiments presented in this paper are significant because they relate the presence of KAP to CsA toxicity in a system isolated from the multiple and complex interactions that occur in the kidney upon treatment with the immunosuppressive drug. This cell system will be a valuable model for gaining further insight into the physiological role of KAP in the kidney and its relevance in CsA-mediated toxicity in proximal tubule cells. The concept that KAP could be involved in processes that end in calcium mobilization will be studied further, and it will be of great interest to determine whether the up-regulation that KAP mRNA exhibits in the uterus of pregnant females is involved in calcium mobilization, as this is an important step in the excitability of uterine smooth muscle cells during delivery. The kidney androgen-regulated protein (KAP)1 was identified as an abundant 20,000-dalton protein by in vitro translation of male mouse kidney mRNA (1Toole J.J. Hastie N.D. Held W.A. Cell. 1979; 17: 441-448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Shortly after its identification, it became a useful model for studying kidney-specific hormonal regulation of gene expression. The KAP gene exhibits androgen-dependent and -independent regulatory mechanisms in different segments of proximal tubules (2Meseguer A. Catterall J.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1987; 1: 535-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Whereas a functional androgen receptor and testosterone are required for expression in cortical S1 and S2 segments of proximal tubules, no androgen is required for expression in the medullar S3 segment (3Meseguer A. Watson C.S. Catterall F.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 962-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 4Meseguer A. Catterall J.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1240-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Therefore, females, castrated males, and androgen receptor-deficient Tfm/Y males express the gene in S3 cells exclusively, whereas males and androgen-induced females also express the gene in S1/S2 cells. KAP mRNA expression in S3 cells depends on thyroid hormone (5Solé E. Calvo R. Obregón M.J. Meseguer A. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 2120-2129Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and can be further induced by estrogens in females (6Meseguer A. Catterall J.F. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1992; 89: 153-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Estrogen-dependent expression of the KAP gene in rat and mouse uteri around delivery has also been reported (7Kasik J.W. Rice E.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1993; 90: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 8Runic R. Zhu L.-J. Crozat A. Bagchi M.K. Catterall J.F. Bagchi I.C.

https://openalex.org/W2068136109,"We have tested the importance of charge interactions for α-conotoxin MI binding to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR). Ionic residues on α-conotoxin MI were altered by site-directed mutagenesis or by chemical modification. In physiological buffer, removal of charges at the N terminus, His-5, and Lys-10 had small (2–4-fold) effects on binding affinity to the mouse muscle AChR and the Torpedo AChR. It was also demonstrated that conotoxin had no effect on the conformational equilibrium of either receptor, as assessed by the effects of the noncompetitive antagonist proadifen on conotoxin binding and, conversely, the effect of conotoxin on the affinity of phencyclidine, proadifen, and ethidium. Conotoxin displayed higher binding affinity in low ionic strength buffer; neutralization of Lys-10 and the N terminus by acetylation blocked this affinity shift at the αδ site but not at the αγ site. It is concluded that Ctx residues Lys-10 and the N terminal interact with oppositely charged receptor residues only at the αδ site, and the two sites have distinct arrangements of charged residues. Ethidium fluorescence experiments demonstrated that conotoxin is formally competitive with a small cholinergic ligand, tetramethylammonium. Thus, α-conotoxin MI appears to interact with the portion of the binding site responsible for stabilizing agonist cations but does not do so with a cationic residue and is, consequently, incapable of inducing a conformational change.

The muscle type nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR)1 is a pentameric ligand-gated cation channel with a subunit stoichiometry of α2βγδ (see Ref. 1Barrantes F.J. Barrantes F.J. The Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor: Current Views and Future Trends. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1998: 1-10Crossref Google Scholar for review). The homologous subunits surround a central pore that forms the ion conductive pathway. The AChR comprises two extracellular ligand-binding sites for ACh that lie at the interfaces between the α-γ- and the α-δ-subunits (2Pedersen S.E. Cohen J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2785-2789Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 3Blount P. Merlie J.P. Neuron. 1989; 3: 349-357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Competitive antagonists and natural toxins often have different affinities for the two sites that arise from the distinct contributions of the γ- and δ-subunits to each site (4Sine S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9436-9440Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). For example, d-tubocurarine binds the αγ sites of theTorpedo AChR with an affinity more than 100-fold greater than for the αδ site (5Neubig R.R. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5464-5475Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). A similar characteristic was observed for the marine snail α-conotoxins, some of which bind the mouse muscle AChR sites with affinities that differ by more than 10,000-fold, where the αδ site is bound with higher affinity (see Ref. 6McIntosh J.M. Santos A.D. Olivera B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 59-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar for review). The differences in affinity have been attributed to three specific residues in mouse muscle AChR γ-subunit (γLys-34, γTyr-111, and γPhe-172) and the corresponding homologous residues in the δ-subunit (7Sine S.M. Kreienkamp H.J. Bren N. Maeda R. Taylor P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 205-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Recent work (8Sugiyama N. Marchot P. Kawanishi C. Osaka H. Molles B. Sine S.M. Taylor P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 787-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) has also identified α-subunit residues that affect binding of α-conotoxin MI (Ctx) in a site-selective manner, which suggests that Ctx may bind with distinct configurations at the two sites. Ctx residues Gly-9 and Pro-6 (see TableI) and residues on the δ-subunit and between Ala-7 and Pro-6 and binding site residues in the α-subunit appear to stabilize binding through hydrophobic interactions (9Bren N. Sine S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12692-12700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar).Table IThe α-conotoxin family of peptidesToxinSequence1 5 10 15α-GIECCNPACGRHYSCα-GIAECCNPACGRHYSCGKα-GIIECCHPACGKHFSCα-MIGRCCHPACGKNYSCα-SIICCNPACGRKYSCα-SIAYCCHPACGKNFDCα-SIIGCCCNPACGPNYGCGTSCS Open table in a new tab Significant affinity differences have also been observed for binding to the Torpedo AChR (10Groebe D.R. Dumm J.M. Levitan E.S. Abramson S.N. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 105-111PubMed Google Scholar, 11Hann R.M. Pagan O.R. Eterovic V.A.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6689-6698Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar); however, in this case the αγ site is bound with higher affinity. Chiara et al. (12Chiara D.C. Xie Y. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6689-6698Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) showed that one AChR residue, γTyr-111, and its δ-subunit homolog, δArg-113, accounted for much of the affinity differences inTorpedo AChR. They further suggested that the affinity change arose from specific charge repulsion between δArg-113 and Ctx residue Lys-10. This Ctx residue is highly conserved among α-conotoxins; a cationic amino acid is present in this position (see Table I), with the exception of α-conotoxin SI, where it is in the adjacent position, or in SII where it is absent (Table I). The homologous residue in α-conotoxin GI (Arg-9) was identified as being responsible for the high affinity binding of conotoxins to the αγ site; when it was substituted for a proline, affinity decreased dramatically for the αγ site (13Hann R.M. Pagan O.R. Gregory L.M. Jacome T. Eterovic V.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9051-9056Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This observation was consistent with the low affinities of α-conotoxins SI and SII for the αγ site, which have a Pro at this position. Several studies suggest that ionic interactions may not be the critical aspect of the role of this residue in binding. Analysis of pairwise interactions in the mouse muscle AChR failed to reveal strong interactions between δTyr-113 and Ctx Lys-10 (9Bren N. Sine S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12692-12700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, that analysis did not examine a charge-change at δTyr-113 to Arg, the amino acid present in the Torpedo AChR. Studies on analogs of α-conotoxin GI that changed the corresponding Arg-9 to alanine displayed affinity changes that appeared site-independent (14Groebe D.R. Gray W.R. Abramson S.N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6469-6474Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), suggesting that the charge per se was not important to binding. Conotoxin binding appears to block competitively the binding of α-bungarotoxin and to block biological activity of AChRs. Yet, α-conotoxins do not appear to influence the conformation of the mouse AChR (15Prince R.J. Sine S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19623-19629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The structural model of Unwin and co-workers (16Miyazawa A. Fujiyoshi Y. Stowell M. Unwin N. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 765-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 17Unwin N. Philos. Trans. R Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2000; 355: 1813-1829Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) suggests the presence of transverse tunnels leading to a buried site for ACh binding. But such tunnels appear unlikely to permit access of a ligand the size of Ctx to the inner recesses of the binding site. An alternative model is that Ctx binds at the ACh-binding site entrance to block access of smaller ligands but may not interact closely with residues critical for stabilizing agonist binding. However, Bren and Sine (9Bren N. Sine S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12692-12700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) measured interactions of Ctx with α-subunit residues Tyr-93, Tyr-190, and Tyr-198, residues thought to be critical in stabilizing agonist binding. The evidence that Ctx interacts with AChR-binding site residues appears incompatible with the structural model of the AChR and with a role for cationic residues in binding. To examine the role of charged residues in stabilizing binding of Ctx to the AChR and to examine whether Ctx interacts intimately with residues critical for agonist binding, we determined the binding properties of charge variants of Ctx, as well as several other Ctx mutants. We present data that the charge of Ctx Lys-10 and that of His-5 and the N terminus are relatively unimportant to the net binding affinity toward either the mouse muscle type AChR or theTorpedo electric organ AChR. We further demonstrate that binding of Ctx is conformationally insensitive. Nonetheless, the toxin is formally competitive with the ammonium moiety of ACh. This cationic toxin does not appear to take advantage of the innate charge stabilization the receptor confers on agonists and many competitive antagonists but nonetheless occupies the same steric space. Studies in low ionic strength, however, did reveal distinct contributions of charge interactions from the γ- and δ-subunits, but these likely arise from interactions with negatively charged residues on the AChR. All the enzymes for molecular biology, the pMALp2 plasmid vector, and amylose resin were supplied by New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Genosys (The Woodlands, TX). Culture media, competent cells, and isopropylthio-β-galactoside were from Life Technologies, Inc. DNA was sequenced using a kit, version 2.0, from U. S. Biochemical Corp. Peptidylglycine α-amidating enzyme was from Takara (Beverley, CA), and synthetic Ctx was purchased from Sigma. AChR-rich membranes were prepared from fresh or frozen Torpedo californica electric organ as described previously (18Pedersen S.E. Dreyer E.B. Cohen J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13735-13743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). α-Conotoxin MI (Ctx) was prepared by peptide synthesis at the Baylor College of Medicine protein core facility. The reduced peptide was purified by preparative reversed phase HPLC (Vydac 250 × 22 mm, C18); elution was by a linear gradient of CH3CN containing 0.09% trifluoroacetic acid. The peptide was renatured by oxidation of cysteines to form disulfides by stirring in air according to the procedures described by Zafaralla et al. (19Zafaralla G.C. Ramilo C. Gray W.R. Karlstrom R. Olivera B.M. Cruz L.J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7102-7105Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and by Myers (20Myers R.A. Structural Characteristics of the Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor as Deduced by α-Conotoxin Binding Ph.D. Dissertation. University of Utah, 1989Google Scholar). The renatured peptide was purified by reversed phase HPLC; it displayed the skewed peak profile characteristic of the conformational transition between two states (21Gray W.R. Rivier J.E. Galyean R. Cruz L.J. Olivera B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12247-12251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The elution profile was identical to that of a commercial preparation of Ctx (Sigma) and gave identical binding constants as assessed by inhibition of [3H]ACh binding on AChR-rich membranes from Torpedo (22Pedersen S.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 1-9PubMed Google Scholar). Two variants of Ctx were also prepared by peptide synthesis, Ctx Ala-7 → Ser and Ctx Tyr-12 → Trp. These were purified as the linear peptide. Oxidation of the sulfhydryls to form the correct disulfide bonding was carried out by oxidation in 1 mmGSSG. This redox buffer required only 30 min to 1 h for complete oxidation of the peptide, rather than the several days required for air oxidation. The peptides were then purified by preparative reversed phase HPLC as described above. These variants also displayed the skewed peak characteristic of the conformational transition observed for native Ctx. In all cases, the composition was confirmed by amino acid analysis. Chemical modifications of Ctx at the N terminus and Lys-10 were carried out as follows. Reductive methylation of Ctx was carried out by the method of Jentoft and Dearborn (23Jentoft N. Dearborn D.G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 570-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 mg of Ctx was reacted in 3 ml of 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 8.3 mm NaCNBH4, and 8.3 mmH2CO overnight at 4 °C. The reaction was terminated by addition of trifluoroacetic acid, and the product was purified by preparative reversed phase HPLC. The reaction resulted in addition of two methyl groups each at the N terminus and at Lys-10 (α-N-dimethylglycyl, ε-N-dimethyllysyl-Ctx; Met-Ctx). Acetylation was carried out by reaction with acetic anhydride according to Means and Feeney (24Means G.E. Feeney R.E. Chemical Modification of Proteins. Holden-Day, San Francisco1971: 214-217Google Scholar). 2 mg of Ctx was dissolved in cold, 50% saturated sodium acetate (200 μl) and kept on ice during the reaction. A total of 10 μl of acetic anhydride was added in small aliquots at regular intervals over 1 h (acetyl-Ctx). The product was purified by reversed phase HPLC. For trinitrobenzoylation (TNB), 2 mg of Ctx was dissolved in 1 ml of sodium borate buffer, pH 9.5, with 20 mm trinitrobenzoyl sulfonate and incubated for 2 h at ambient temperature (∼21 °C). The product was purified by reversed phase HPLC. The reaction yielded two peaks. Amino acid analysis and mass spectroscopy revealed that the larger second peak contained the product with reaction of TNB at both the N terminus and Lys-10. Amino acid analysis of the products of chemical reactions revealed loss of detectable Lys and one of the two Gly residues after methylation and after reaction with trinitrobenzoyl sulfonate. The analysis of the acetylated Ctx was similar to that of unmodified toxin, as expected for an acid-labile adduct. Mass spectroscopy revealed parent ion masses of of 1493, 1549, 1577, and 1915 for Ctx, Met-Ctx, Ac-Ctx, and TNB-Ctx respectively; these masses corresponded to those expected for each modification. The loss of primary amines in the modified toxins was verified by loss of reactivity to fluorescamine. Fluorescence measurements showed that there were no amines available for reaction for each of the modified toxins, whereas Ctx showed reactivity that corresponded to the presence of two reactive sites. We have constructed a recombinant expression plasmid encoding a maltose-binding protein-Ctx fusion protein, using pMAL-p2 system (25di Guan C. Li P. Riggs P.D. Inouye H. Gene ( Amst. ). 1988; 67: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). The system was chosen to direct secretion of the MBP fusion protein into the periplasmic space for proper disulfide bond formation. Codons for Ctx residues were chosen according to Escherichia coli codon usage (26Grosjean H. Fiers W. Gene ( Amst. ). 1982; 18: 199-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). Glycine was appended to the Ctx sequence to allow cleavage by peptidylglycine α-amidation enzyme. Two stop codons were added at the end of the gene followed by a PstI site for cloning the synthetic gene into pMALp2 at the XmnI andPstI site. The XmnI site included sequence encoding the protease factor Xa cleavage site, located just 5′ to the toxin gene sequence (25di Guan C. Li P. Riggs P.D. Inouye H. Gene ( Amst. ). 1988; 67: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 27Maina C.V. Riggs P.D. Grandea A.G. Slatko B.E. Moran L.S. Tagliamonte J.A. McReynolds L.A. Guan C.D. Gene ( Amst. ). 1988; 74: 365-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar) such that cleavage of the fusion protein with factor Xa liberates Ctx with no additional amino acids. Complementary oligonucleotides were purified by gel electrophoresis in 20% polyacrylamide containing 7 m urea. They were then 5′-phosphorylated using polynucleotide kinase and annealed by combining equimolar amounts of each oligomer (300 pmol) in 100 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, and 50 mm NaCl, followed by heating to 95 °C for 5 min and slowly cooling to room temperature. The duplex DNA was gel-purified, digested with PstI, and inserted into the expression plasmid pMALp2 at XmnI and PstI sites. Transformants containing the conotoxin M1 gene (pMAL-Cono) were verified by DNA sequencing (28Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52251) Google Scholar). Cells containing pMAL-Cono clone were grown at 37 °C in LB broth containing 0.2% glucose and 100 μg/ml ampicillin to an absorbance of 0.5 at 600 nm, and then induced with 0.5 mm isopropylthio-β-galactoside for 3 h. A periplasmic fraction was prepared by osmotic shock (29Ducancel F. Boulain J.C. Tremeau O. Menez A. Prot. Eng. 1989; 3: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and the fusion protein was purified by affinity chromatography over an amylose resin (30Kellermann O.K. Ferenci T. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 90: 459-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) column (10 ml) that had been equilibrated previously with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA. The column was washed with 10 volumes of this buffer, and the bound MBP-conotoxin fusion protein was then eluted with buffer containing 5 mm maltose. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The purified fusion protein (MBP-conotoxin) was cleaved with factor Xa at a w/w ratio of 1% for 48 h at room temperature followed by SDS-PAGE analysis. The result showed about 50–70% release of Ctx. The recombinant Ctx was then purified by HPLC on a semi-preparative Vydac C8 column. Elution was by a linear gradient of 0–60% acetonitrile containing 0.09% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 3 ml/min. HPLC fractions were analyzed by Tricine/SDS-PAGE (31Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10410) Google Scholar). To amidate Ctx, the pooled fractions were treated with peptidylglycine α-amidating enzyme according to a standard procedure (32Tajima M. Iida T. Yoshida S. Komatsu K. Namba R. Yanagi M. Noguchi M. Okamoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9602-9605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for 4 h at 37 °C followed by repurification on HPLC as described above. Ctx mutants Lys-10 → His, Lys-10 → Pro, and His-5 → Glu were produced as described above for Ctx with appropriate codon replacements in the synthetic oligonucleotides. The yields of the Ctx analogs were lower than that of native Ctx because the extent of factor Xa digestion was lower. Because of the limited amount of material, duplicate experiments on Torpedo AChR were carried out just once. Binding of the various conotoxin derivatives was measured by competitive inhibition of the initial rate of bungarotoxin binding, as described previously (33Pedersen S.E. Lurtz M.M. Papineni R.V. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 294: 117-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Binding toTorpedo AChR was measured using the assay described by Schmidt and Raftery (34Schmidt J. Raftery M.A. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 52: 349-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) or by filtration over GF/F filters. For filtration the following procedure was followed. Samples of AChR-rich membranes and competitive ligand were preincubated in HTPS (250 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 3 mmCaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.002% NaN3, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.0) containing 0.1% BSA for 30 min to reach equilibrium. The binding was initiated by addition of 125I-α-BgTx (0.5–3 nm), and the samples were allowed to incubate at ambient temperature for 45 min. Reactions were quenched by addition of 300 nmnon-radioactive α-BgTx in HTPS. The samples were then filtered over Whatman type GF/F filters that had been presoaked in 1% polyethyleneimine. The filters were then washed with 10 ml of HTPS and counted in an γ-radiation counter (Beckman Instruments). For low ionic strength experiments, binding was carried out in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, with 0.1% BSA. Binding reactions were quenched at 30 s to remain in the linear range of the initial association rate. Binding to mouse muscle type AChR expressed on the surface of tissue culture cells (BC3H1) was carried out as described earlier (35Papineni R.V. Pedersen S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24891-24898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) using a 24-well plate assay or, alternatively, by a filtration assay (4Sine S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9436-9440Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The latter assay was carried out by suspending the cells in potassium-Ringer buffer (140 mm KCl, 5.4 mm NaCl, 12.8 mm CaCl2, 1.7 mm MgCl2, 25 mm Hepes, 30 μg/ml BSA, pH 7.4). Assays were incubated as described above and then filtered over Whatman type GF/C filters that had been presoaked overnight in 4% Carnation instant nonfat dry milk. The filters were then washed with 12 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and counted in an γ-radiation counter (Beckman Instruments). Assessment of competitive binding between TMA and Ctx was carried out by monitoring their effects on the conformational state of the AChR. The conformation, in turn, was measured by the binding of ethidium. Ethidium preferentially binds the desensitized state of the AChR, and the extent of binding reflects the extent of desensitization of the AChR when the AChR and ethidium concentrations are low relative to the KD values for ethidium (∼500 nm). Ethidium binding was measured by fluorescence enhancement, essentially as described by Lurtz and Pedersen (36Lurtz M.M. Pedersen S.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), except that fluorescence was monitored through a filter (550 nm cut on, Oriel number 59502) to obtain a higher signal to noise ratio. Binding to the NCA site was also measured by [3H]phencyclidine binding using a centrifugation assay as described previously (22Pedersen S.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 1-9PubMed Google Scholar). Binding was carried out in low concentrations of [3H]phencyclidine (∼1 nm) and is reported as bound over free, which compensates for the change in free [3H]phencyclidine upon binding of competing ligand. Binding was analyzed by nonlinear least squares fitting to Equation 1 for inhibition by competitive binding to two independent sites present in equal concentrations, Bmax1/1+I/KI1+1/1+I/KI2Equation 1 where KI1 andKI2 represent the binding constants for the inhibitor, Bmax the maximum amount of binding at each site, and I the concentration of inhibitor. In some cases, binding was fit to Equation 2 for the binding of two sites present in differing concentrations. B=Bmax1/1+I/KI1+Bmax2/1+I/KI2Equation 2 This was necessary because 125I-α-BgTx binds with unequal rates to the two sites under some circumstances. Data for inhibition of Ctx binding to the mouse muscle AChR were generally fit with Equation 2, whereas data for inhibition of binding toTorpedo AChR could be fit with Equation 1. For the analysis of ethidium fluorescence, the enhancement of binding by agonists was fit to the Hill Equation 3, B=Bmax/1+(K/L)nEquation 3 or to the binding isotherm (the Hill equation withn = 1). Inhibition of TMA binding by Ctx was fit to Equation 4 for inhibition at a single binding site. B=Bmax1/1+I/KobsEquation 4 Like other α-toxins that interact with the nicotinic AChR, α-conotoxins are cationic. Ctx carries a net charge of +3.5, counting His-5 as ½ charge and including the N-terminal charge. To test whether these charged moieties play a significant role in the interaction of α-conotoxins with the AChR, we examined the binding energies of toxins that had been modified or mutated at the charged loci. One receptor residue that had been identified as constituting an electrostatically repulsive interaction was δArg-113 in theTorpedo AChR. The homologous residue in the mouse muscle AChR is a Tyr. Therefore, we compared affinities of toxins in both these species as a means of assessing the importance of charge repulsion between this residue and Ctx. We utilized two approaches to generate Ctx structural analogs, expression of recombinant Ctx inE. coli, and chemical modification of synthetic Ctx. Ctx could be expressed and refolded in E. coli by attaching a synthetic gene to the secreted maltose-binding protein. The fusion protein was isolated by amylose affinity chromatography and Ctx cleaved by factor Xa. Purification by HPLC, amidation, and a final HPLC purification yielded a product that was indistinguishable from commercial Ctx and from synthetic Ctx, as judged by migration SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and by HPLC (Fig.1, insets). The net yield of recombinant toxin was about 50 μg/liter of cell. Recombinant Ctx was compared with synthetic Ctx and with a commercial product (Sigma) for binding activity on mouse muscle AChR and on T. californicaAChR by inhibition of 125I-α-BgTx binding as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The affinities of each material were indistinguishable (data not shown). Proper refolding and disulfide bond formation was apparent from comigration of recombinant and synthetic Ctx on HPLC and because it is required for biological activity (37Nishiuchi Y. Sakakibara S. FEBS Lett. 1982; 148: 260-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 38Hashimoto K. Uchida S. Yoshida H. Nishiuchi Y. Sakakibara S. Yukari K. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1985; 118: 351-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Ctx was chemically modified by reductive methylation, by acetylation, or by trinitrobenzoylation, using standard reaction methods (see “Experimental Procedures”). Each modified toxin was purified by reversed phase HPLC and shown to be quantitatively modified at Lys-10 and at the N terminus by mass spectroscopy, by lack of reactivity to fluorescamine, and by amino acid analysis. Methylation will increase the bulk of the reacted amines but will not alter the charge; both the N-terminal amine and Lys-10 were found to be dimethylated. The effect of amine dimethylation on affinity was negligible (Fig. 2 and Table II), demonstrating that the simple size of these amines was relatively unimportant for binding. Acetylation of the amines resulted in formation of a neutral acetamide with more steric bulk than the methylation. Nonetheless, there was less than a 2-fold effect on affinity for the mouse AChR and a 3-fold decrease for the Torpedo AChR αγ site (Fig. 2 and TableII). The small affinity changes suggest that the charges of Lys-10 and the N terminus do not contribute substantially to the binding energy. The modification by addition of a picric acid moiety, (TNB-Ctx) does cause a significant shift of binding to the αγ site ofTorpedo AChR, and the αδ site of the mouse AChR of 13–15-fold. The effects on mouse αγ and Torpedo αδ sites were smaller (Table II).Table IIBinding of Conotoxin analogs to the high and low affinity sites of mouse and Torpedo AChRCompoundMouse AChRTorpedo AChRKI11KI2KI1KI2nmμmnmμmCtx3.6 ± 0.672 ± 1693 ± 111.7 ± 0.3Acetyl-Ctx3.9 ± 0.7170 ± 25412 ± 130—2-aA dashed line indicates that the data were best described by a fit to Equation 4; a blank space indicates that the second K value could not be determined.Methyl-Ctx1.9 ± 0.4110 ± 35117 ± 122.5 ± 0.3TNBS-Ctx40 ± 211400 ± 300—Ctx K10P30,000 ± 10,0002400 ± 90011.3 ± 10Ctx K10H67 ± 3520 ± 3001.4 ± 1Ctx H5E19 ± 3640 ± 13010 ± 7CtxA7S8 ± 4100 ± 27450 ± 1707.0 ± 1.8Ctx Y12W3.5 ± 0.8100 ± 7420 ± 81.5 ± 0.6Ctx + proadifen5.3 ± 357 ± 131.8 ± 0.8Ctx + tetracaine61 ± 161.6 ± 0.3KI values for inhibition of 125I-α-BgTx binding to mouse and Torpedo AChR by Ctx and its analogs were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The errors listed are the standard errors of the mean.2-a A dashed line indicates that the data were best described by a fit to Equation 4; a blank space indicates that the second K value could not be determined.

https://openalex.org/W2114641171,"Recently we demonstrated that overexpression of the wild type insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-IRWT) in 32D myeloid progenitor cells led to cell proliferation in response to interleukin 4 (IL-4) as well as insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) in the absence of insulin receptor substrate expression (Soon, L., Flechner, L., Gutkind, J. S., Wang, L. H., Baserga, R., Pierce, J. H., and Li, W. (1999) Mol. Cell. Biol. 19, 3816–3828). To understand the structural importance of insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-IR) in mediating IL-4- and IGF-I-induced DNA synthesis, we transfected various mutants of IGF-IR to 32D cells. Our results show that most mutants, including Y1250F, Y1251F, Y1250F/Y1251F, S1280A/S1281A/S1282A/S1283A, Y1316F, and 1245d, still retained mitogenic response toward IGF-I or IL-4. However, the Y950F, Y1131F, and Y1135F mutants were not able to respond to either ligand. The H1293F/K1294R and 1293d mutants reduced response toward IGF-I but not to IL-4. Phosphorylation of Shc was greatly reduced in those three mutants that lost mitogenic response. The MAPK activity was much lower in Y1131F and Y1135F mutants, indicating the importance of the Shc/MAPK pathway in IGF-I-induced mitogenesis. Importantly, the synergistic effect of these two factors on DNA synthesis was not affected in cells expressing most of the mutants, even in those three that had lower mitogenic response toward a single ligand. These results suggest that an unidentified pathway(s) may be induced upon co-addition of IGF-I and IL-4 that sustains the intact mitogenesis."
