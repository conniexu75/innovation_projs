https://openalex.org/W2128744963,"Three glutamate transporters have been identified in rat, including astroglial transporters GLAST and GLT-1 and a neuronal transporter EAAC1. Here we demonstrate that inhibition of the synthesis of each glutamate transporter subtype using chronic antisense oligonucleotide administration, in vitro and in vivo, selectively and specifically reduced the protein expression and function of glutamate transporters. The loss of glial glutamate transporters GLAST or GLT-1 produced elevated extracellular glutamate levels, neurodegeneration characteristic of excitotoxicity, and a progressive paralysis. The loss of the neuronal glutamate transporter EAAC1 did not elevate extracellular glutamate in the striatum but did produce mild neurotoxicity and resulted in epilepsy. These studies suggest that glial glutamate transporters provide the majority of functional glutamate transport and are essential for maintaining low extracellular glutamate and for preventing chronic glutamate neurotoxicity."
https://openalex.org/W2014339193,"Evoked activity in the mammalian cortex and the resulting behavioral responses exhibit a large variability to repeated presentations of the same stimulus. This study examined whether the variability can be attributed to ongoing activity. Ongoing and evoked spatiotemporal activity patterns in the cat visual cortex were measured with real-time optical imaging; local field potentials and discharges of single neurons were recorded simultaneously, by electrophysiological techniques. The evoked activity appeared deterministic, and the variability resulted from the dynamics of ongoing activity, presumably reflecting the instantaneous state of cortical networks. In spite of the large variability, evoked responses in single trials could be predicted by linear summation of the deterministic response and the preceding ongoing activity. Ongoing activity must play an important role in cortical function and cannot be ignored in exploration of cognitive processes."
https://openalex.org/W2075370277,"Reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs) regulate apoptosis during normal development and disease in animals. ROIs are also implicated in hypersensitive resistance responses of plants against pathogens. Arabidopsis lsd1 mutants exhibited impaired control of cell death in the absence of pathogen and could not control the spread of cell death once it was initiated. Superoxide was necessary and sufficient to initiate lesion formation; it accumulated before the onset of cell death and subsequently in live cells adjacent to spreading lsd1 lesions. Thus, runaway cell death seen in lsd1 plants reflected abnormal accumulation of superoxide and lack of responsiveness to signals derived from it."
https://openalex.org/W2030592815,"The transcription factor NF-kappa B regulates genes participating in immune and inflammatory responses. In T lymphocytes, NF-kappa B is sequestered in the cytosol by the inhibitor I kappa B-alpha and released after serine phosphorylation of I kappa B-alpha that regulates its ubiquitin-dependent degradation. We report an alternative mechanism of NF-kappa B activation. Stimulation of Jurkat T cells with the protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor and T cell activator pervanadate led to NF-kappa B activation through tyrosine phosphorylation but not degradation of I kappa B-alpha. Pervanadate-induced I kappa B-alpha phosphorylation and NF-kappa B activation required expression of the T cell tyrosine kinase p56ick. Reoxygenation of hypoxic cells appeared as a physiological effector of I kappa B-alpha tyrosine phosphorylation. Tyrosine phosphorylation of I kappa B-alpha represents a proteolysis-independent mechanism of NF-kappa B activation that directly couples NF-kappa B to cellular tyrosine kinase."
https://openalex.org/W2120843707,"Songs of birds comprise hierarchical sets of vocal gestures. In zebra finches, songs include notes and syllables (groups of notes) delivered in fixed sequences. During singing, premotor neurons in the forebrain nucleus HVc exhibited reliable changes in activity rates whose patterns were uniquely associated with syllable identity. Neurons in the forebrain nucleus robustus archistriatalis, which receives input from the HVc, exhibited precisely timed and structured bursts of activity that were uniquely associated with note identity. Hence, units of vocal behavior are represented hierarchically in the avian forebrain. The representation of temporal sequences at each level of the hierarchy may be established by means of a decoding process involving interactions of higher level input with intrinsic local circuitry. Behavior is apparently represented by precise temporal patterning of spike trains at lower levels of the hierarchy."
https://openalex.org/W2102265131,"Nucleotide excision repair, which is defective in xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), involves incision of a DNA strand on each side of a lesion. We isolated a human gene homologous to yeast Rad1 and found that it corrects the repair defects of XP group F as well as rodent groups 4 and 11. Causative mutations and strongly reduced levels of encoded protein were identified in XP-F patients. The XPF protein was purified from mammalian cells in a tight complex with ERCC1. This complex is a structure-specific endonuclease responsible for the 5′ incision during repair. These results demonstrate that the XPF, ERCC4, and ERCC11 genes are equivalent, complete the isolation of the XP genes that form the core nucleotide excision repair system, and solve the catalytic function of the XPF-containing complex."
https://openalex.org/W2142401824,"In a transgenic mouse line (Tg8) deficient for the gene encoding monoamine oxidase A (MAOA), we show that the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) lacks the characteristic barrel-like clustering of layer IV neurons, whereas normal pattern formation exists in the thalamus and the trigeminal nuclei. No barrel-like patterns were visible with tenascin or serotonin immunostaining or with labeling of thalamocortical axons. An excess of brain serotonin during the critical period of barrel formation appears to have a causal role in these cortical abnormalities, since early administration of parachlorophenylalanine, an inhibitor of serotonin synthesis, in Tg8 pups restored the formation of barrels in S1, whereas inhibition of catecholamine synthesis did not. Transient inactivation of MAOA in normal newborns reproduced a barrelless phenotype in parts of S1."
https://openalex.org/W2090091933,"We have probed internal and external accessibility of S4 residues to the membrane-impermeant thiol reagent methanethiosulfonate-ethyltrimethlammonium (MTSET) in both open and closed, cysteine-substituted Shaker K+ channels. Our results indicate that S4 traverses the membrane with no more than 5 amino acids in the closed state, and that the distribution of buried residues changes when channels open. This change argues for a displacement of S4 through the plane of the membrane in which an initially intracellular residue moves to within 3 amino acids of the extracellular solution. These results demonstrate that the putative voltage-sensing charges of S4 actually reside in the membrane and that they move outward when channels open. We consider constraints placed on channel structure by these results."
https://openalex.org/W2128645913,"Multiple epsilon subunits are major determinants of the NMDA receptor channel diversity. Based on their functional properties in vitro and distributions, we have proposed that the epsilon 1 and epsilon 2 subunits play a role in synaptic plasticity. To investigate the physiological significance of the NMDA receptor channel diversity, we generated mutant mice defective in the epsilon 2 subunit. These mice showed no suckling response and died shortly after birth but could survive by hand feeding. The mutation hindered the formation of the whisker-related neuronal barrelette structure and the clustering of primary sensory afferent terminals in the brainstem trigeminal nucleus. In the hippocampus of the mutant mice, synaptic NMDA responses and longterm depression were abolished. These results suggest that the epsilon 2 subunit plays an essential role in both neuronal pattern formation and synaptic plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2049050286,"We have discovered that all known yeast and vertebrate small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), except for the MRP/7-2 RNA, fall into two major classes. One class is defined by conserved boxes C and D and the other by a novel element: a consensus ACA triplet positioned 3 nt before the 3' end of the RNA. A role for the ACA box is snoRNA stability has been established by mutational analysis of a yeast ACA snoRNA (snR 11). Full function of the box depends on the integrity of an adjacent upstream stem. All members of the yeast ACA family are associated with the GAR1 protein. Binding of this or another common small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein particle protein is predicted to be a critical entry point to snoRNA posttranscriptional life, including precise formation of the snoRNA 3' end."
https://openalex.org/W2020569812,"We tested the pathogenic role of O2-) radicals in excitotoxic injury. Inactivation of the TCA cycle enzyme, aconitase, was used as a marker of intracellular O2- levels, and a porphyrin SOD mimetic was used to scavenge O2-. The selective, reversible, and SOD-sensitive inactivation of aconitase by known O2- generators was used to validate aconitase activity as a marker of O2- generation. Treatment of rat cortical cultures with NMDA, KA, or the intracellular O2- generator PQ2+ produced a selective and reversible inactivation of aconitase, which closely correlated with subsequent cell death produced by these agents. The SOD mimetic, but not its less active congener, attenuated both aconitase inactivation and cell death produced by NMDA, KA, and PQ2+. These results provide direct evidence implicating O2(-) generation in the pathway to excitotoxic injury."
https://openalex.org/W2019899829,"The mechanism of CD40 ligand (CD40L)-mediated in vivo activation of CD4+ T cells was examined by investigation of the development of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) in CD40L-deficient mice that carried a transgenic T cell receptor specific for myelin basic protein. These mice failed to develop EAE after priming with antigen, and CD4+ T cells remained quiescent and produced no interferon-γ (IFN-γ). T cells were primed to make IFN-γ and induce EAE by providing these mice with B7.1+ antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Thus, CD40L is required to induce costimulatory activity on APCs for in vivo activation of CD4+ T cells to produce IFN-γ and to evoke autoimmunity."
https://openalex.org/W2021025315,"Topographic maps, which maintain the spatial order of neurons in the order of their axonal connections, are found throughout the nervous system. In the visual retinotectal projection, ELF-1, a ligand in the tectum, and its receptors in the retina show complementary gradients in expression and binding, indicating they may be positional labels for map development. Here we show that ELF-1 acts as a repellent axon guidance factor in vitro. In vivo, when the tectal ELF-1 pattern is modified by retroviral overexpression, retinal axons avoid ectopic ELF-1 patches and map to abnormally anterior positions. All these effects were seen on axons from temporal but not nasal retina, indicating that ELF-1 could determine nasal versus temporal retinotectal specificity, and providing a direct demonstration of a cell recognition molecule with topographically specific effects on neural map development."
https://openalex.org/W2067701958,"The role of CD40 ligand (CD40L) in the primary activation of T cells is not clear. The cellular and humoral immune responses to adenoviral vectors in a murine model of liver-directed gene transfer were studied to define the mechanisms responsible for CD40L-dependent T cell priming. CD40L-deficient mice did not develop effective cytotoxic T cells to transduced hepatocytes, and T cell-dependent B cell responses were absent. Full reconstitution of cellular and humoral immunity was achieved in CD40L-deficient mice by administration of an activating antibody to CD40 that increased expression of B7.2 on spleen cells. Wild-type mice could be made nonresponsive to vector by administration of antibodies to B7. Thus, CD40L-dependent activation of T cells occurs through signaling of CD40 in the antigen-presenting cell to enhance requisite costimulatory pathways that include B7."
https://openalex.org/W2137563904,"The ubiquitin-conjugating yeast enzyme RAD6 and its human homologs hHR6A and hHR6B are implicated in postreplication repair and damage-induced mutagenesis. The yeast protein is also required for sporulation and may modulate chromatin structure via histone ubiquitination. We report the phenotype of the first animal mutant in the ubiquitin pathway: inactivation of the hHR6B-homologous gene in mice causes male infertility. Derailment of spermatogenesis becomes overt during the postmeiotic condensation of chromatin in spermatids. These findings provide a parallel between yeast sporulation and mammalian spermatogenesis and strongly implicate hHR6-dependent ubiquitination in chromatin remodeling. Since heterozygous male mice and even knockout female mice are completely normal and fertile and thus able to transmit the defect, similar hHR6B mutations may cause male infertility in man."
https://openalex.org/W2156656429,"The atypical PKCs are involved in a number of important cellular functions, including cell proliferation. We report here that the product of the par-4 gene specifically interacts with the regulatory domains of ζPKC and λ/ιPKC, which dramatically inhibits their enzymatic activity. This is particularly challenging, because expression of par-4 has been shown to correlate with growth inhibition and apoptosis. Results are shown here demonstrating that the expression of par-4 in NIH-3T3 cells induces morphological changes typical of apoptosis, which are abrogated by cotransfection of either wild-type ζPKC or λ/ιPKC, but not by their respective kinase-inactive mutants. These findings support a role for the atypical PKC subspecies in the control of cell growth and survival."
https://openalex.org/W2007013508,"Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) imposes an oxidative stress to Escherichia coli that is manifested by oxidation of glutathione and related redox-sensitive targets. OxyR is a thiol-containing transcriptional activator whose oxidation controls the expression of genes involved in H2O2 detoxification. Here we report that certain S-nitrosothiols (RSNOs) impose what we term a ""nitrosative stress"" to E. coli, evidenced by lowering of intracellular thiol and the transcriptional activation of OxyR by S-nitrosylation. This cellular and genetic response determines the metabolic fate of RSNOs and thereby contributes to bacterial rescue from stasis. Our studies reveal that signaling by S-nitrosylation can extend to the level of transcription and describe a metabolic pathway that constitutes an adaptation to nitrosative stress."
https://openalex.org/W2093681883,"Link modules are hyaluronan-binding domains found in proteins involved in the assembly of extracellular matrix, cell adhesion, and migration. The solution structure of the Link module from human TSG-6 was determined and found to consist of two alpha helices and two antiparallel beta sheets arranged around a large hydrophobic core. This defines the consensus fold for the Link module superfamily, which includes CD44, cartilage link protein, and aggrecan. The TSG-6 Link module was shown to interact with hyaluronan, and a putative binding surface was identified on the structure. A structural database search revealed close similarity between the Link module and the C-type lectin domain, with the predicted hyaluronan-binding site at an analogous position to the carbohydrate-binding pocket in E-selectin."
https://openalex.org/W2037453672,"Voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels are modulated by complex interactions with the α2δ subunit. In vitro translation was used to demonstrate a single transmembrane topology of the α2δ subunit in which all but the transmembrane sequence and 5 carboxy-terminal amino acids are extracellular. The glycosylated extracellular domain is required for current stimulation, as shown by coexpression of truncated α2δ subunits with α1A and β4 subunits in Xenopus oocytes and deglycosylation with peptide-N-glycosidase F. However, coexpression of the transmembrane domain-containing δ subunit reduced the stimulatory effects of full-length α2δ subunits and substitution of a different transmembrane domain resulted in a loss of current stimulation. These results support a model whereby the α2δ transmembrane domain mediates subunit interactions and the glycosylated extracellular domain enhances current amplitude."
https://openalex.org/W2086615573,"To identify the protein kinases regulating synaptic NMDA receptors, as well as the conditions favoring enhancement of NMDA receptor–mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) by phosphorylation, we studied the effects of kinase activation and inhibition in hippocampal neurons. Inhibition of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) prevented recovery of NMDA receptors from calcineurin-mediated dephosphorylation induced by synaptic activity, suggesting that tonically active PKA phosphorylates receptors during quiescent periods. Conversely, elevation of PKA activity by forskolin, cAMP analogs, or the β-adrenergic receptor agonists norepinephrine and isoproterenol overcame the ability of calcineurin to depress the amplitude of NMDA EPSCs. Thus, stimulation of β-adrenergic receptors during excitatory synaptic transmission can increase charge transfer and Ca2+ influx through NMDA receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2016941370,"We describe an experimental system to visualize the soma and processes of mammalian neurons and glia in living and fixed preparations by using a recombinant adenovirus vector to transfer the jellyfish green fluorescent protein (GFP) into postmitotic neural cells both in vitro and in vivo. We have introduced several modifications of GFP that enhance its fluorescence intensity in mammalian axons and dendrites. This method should be useful for studying the dynamic processes of cell migration and the development of neuronal connections, as well as for analyzing the function of exogenous genes introduced into cells using the adenovirus vector."
https://openalex.org/W1662447390,"Nck is an adaptor protein composed of a single SH2 domain and three SH3 domains. Upon growth factor stimulation, Nck is recruited to receptor tyrosine kinases via its SH2 domain, probably initiating one or more signaling cascades. In this report, we show that Nck is bound in living cells to the serine-threonine kinase Pak1. The association between Nck and Pak1 is mediated by the second SH3 domain of Nck and a proline-rich sequence in the amino terminus of Pak1. We also show that Pak1 is recruited by activated epidermal growth factor (EGF) and platelet-derived growth factor receptors. Moreover, Pak1 kinase activity is increased in response to EGF in HeLa cells transfected with human Pak1, and the kinase activity was enhanced when Nck was co-transfected. It is concluded that Nck links receptor tyrosine kinases with Pak1 and is probably involved in targeting and regulation of Pak1 activity."
https://openalex.org/W2062346208,"The weaver mutation corresponds to a substitution of glycine to serine in the H5 region of a G protein–gated inwardly rectifying K+ channel gene (GIRK2). By studying mutant GIRK2 weaver homomultimeric channels and heteromultimeric channels comprised of GIRK2 weaver and GIRK1 in Xenopus oocytes, we found that GIRK2 weaver homomultimeric channels lose their selectivity for K+ ions, giving rise to inappropriate receptor-activated and basally active Na+ currents, whereas heteromultimers of GIRK2 weaver and GIRK1 appeared to have reduced current. Immunohistochemical localization indicates that GIRK2 and GIRK1 proteins are expressed in the cerebellar neurons of mice at postnatal day 4, at a time when these neurons normally undergo differentiation. Thus, the aberrant behavior of mutant GIRK2 weaver channels could affect the development of weaver mice in at least two distinct ways."
https://openalex.org/W2026018317,"The reaction of metal complexes with dioxygen (O2) generally proceeds in 1:1, 21, or 41 (metal:O2) stoichiometry. A discrete, structurally characterized 31 product is presented. This mixed-valence trinuclear copper cluster, which contains copper in the highly oxidized trivalent oxidation state, exhibits O2 bond scission and intriguing structural, spectroscopic, and redox properties. The relevance of this synthetic complex to the reduction of O2 at the trinuclear active sites of multicopper oxidases is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2005119948,"Neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) is required for the development of most sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglia. Using electrophysiological techniques in mice with null mutations of the NT-3 gene, we show that two functionally specific subsets of cutaneous afferents differentially require this factor: D-hair receptors and slowly adapting mechanoreceptors; other cutaneous receptors were unaffected. Merkel cells, which are the end organs of slowly adapting mechanoreceptors, are virtually absent in 14-day-old homozygous mutants and are severely reduced in adult NT-3 heterozygous animals. This loss of Merkel cells, together with their innervation, happens in the first postnatal weeks of life, in contrast to muscle spindles and afferents, which are never formed in the absence of NT-3. Thus, NT-3 is essential for the maintenance of specific cutaneous afferents known to subserve fine tactile discrimination in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2167220607,"Scavenger receptor BI (SR-BI), a putative high density lipoprotein (HDL) receptor, mediates the selective uptake of HDL cholesteryl ester into cells and is highly expressed in adrenal gland (Acton, S., Rigotti, A., Landschulz, K.

Adrenal SR-BI mRNA and protein are also increased and cholesterol stores decreased in female mice with knock-out of hepatic lipase, an enzyme previously shown to increase selective uptake in cell culture. SR-BI mRNA is increased in stressed wild type mice and in Y1 adrenal cells treated with adrenocorticotropic hormone; the latter effect is inhibited by HDL. These findings provide in vivo evidence showing SR-BI is a functional HDL receptor under feedback control.

https://openalex.org/W2035136477,"Removal of a rare class of metazoan precursor messenger RNA introns with AU-AC at their termini is catalyzed by a spliceosome that contains U11, U12, and U5 small nuclear ribonucleoproteins. Two previously unidentified, low-abundance human small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs), U4atac and U6atac, were characterized as associated with the AT-AC spliceosome and necessary for AT-AC intron splicing. The excision of AT-AC introns therefore requires four snRNAs not found in the major spliceosome. With the use of psoralen crosslinking, a U6atac interaction with U12 was identified that is similar to a U6-U2 helix believed to contribute to the spliceosomal active center. The conservation of only limited U6atac sequences in the neighborhood of this interaction and the potential of U6atac to base pair with the 5' splice site consensus for AT-AC introns provide support for current models of the core of the spliceosome."
https://openalex.org/W2038480896,"The nuclear pore complex (NPC) is essential for the transit of molecules between the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm of a cell and until recently was thought to allow intermediate-sized molecules (relative molecular mass of approximately 10,000) to diffuse freely across the nuclear envelope. However, the depletion of calcium from the nuclear envelope of Xenopus laevis oocytes was shown to regulate the passage of intermediate-sized molecules. Two distinct conformational states of the NPC were observed by field emission scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. A central plug occluded the NPC channel after nuclear calcium stores had been depleted and free diffusion of intermediate-sized molecules had been blocked. Thus, the NPC conformation appears to gate molecular movement across the nuclear envelope."
https://openalex.org/W1987182471,"Voltage-activated potassium (Kv) channels from mammalian brain are hetero-oligomers containing α and β subunits. Coexpression of Kv1α and Kvβ1 subunits confers rapid A-type inactivation on noninactivating potassium channels (delayed rectifiers) in expression systems in vitro. We have delineated a Kv1.5 amino-terminal region of up to 90 amino acids (residues 112–201) that is sufficient for interactions of Kv1.5α and Kvβ1 subunits. Within this region of the Kv1.5 amino terminus (residues 193–201), a Kvβ1 interaction site necessary for Kvβ1-mediated rapid inactivation of Kv1.5 currents was detected. This interaction site motif (FYE/QLGE/DEAM/L) is found exclusively in the Shaker-related subfamily (Kv1). The results show that hetero-oligomerization between α and Kvβ1 subunits is restricted to Shaker-related potassium channel α subunits."
https://openalex.org/W2016497344,"An in vitro system for studying DNA demethylation has been established using extracts from tissue culture cells. This reaction, which is unusually resistant to proteinase K, takes place through the removal of a 5-methylcytosine nucleotide unit from the DNA substrate and its conversion to an RNase-sensitive form. It is likely that this represents the in vivo mechanism, as well, since extracts from L8 myoblasts specifically demethylate an alpha-actin gene, while extracts from F9 teratocarcinoma cells specifically demodify the Aprt CpG island. After pretreatment with proteinase K, these extracts demethylate both genes equally, suggesting that gene specificity may be controlled by protein factors."
https://openalex.org/W2061858869,"Xenopus oocytes injected with GIRK1 mRNA express inwardly rectifying K+ channels resembling IKACh. Yet IKACh, the atrial G protein-regulated ion channel, is a heteromultimer of GIRK1 and CIR. Reasoning that an oocyte protein might be substituting for CIR, we cloned XIR, a CIR homolog endogenously expressed by Xenopus oocytes. Coinjecting XIR and GIRK1 mRNAs produced large, inwardly rectifying K+ currents responsive to m2-muscarinic receptor stimulation. The m2-stimulated currents of oocytes expressing GIRK1 alone decreased 80% after injecting antisense oligonucleotides specific to the 5' untranslated region of XIR, but GIRK1/CIR currents were unaffected. Thus, GIRK1 without XIR or CIR only ineffectively produces currents in oocytes. This result suggests that GIRK1 does not form native homomultimeric channels."
https://openalex.org/W2013348596,"The activation of a cyclic nucleotide-gated channel is the final step in sensory transduction in olfaction. Normally, this channel is opened by the intracellular cyclic nucleotide second messenger cAMP or cGMP. However, in single channel recordings we found that donors of nitric oxide, a putative intercellular messenger, could directly activate the native olfactory neuron channel. Its action was independent of the presence of the normal ligand and did not involve the cyclic nucleotide binding site, suggesting an alternate site on the molecule that is critical in channel gating. The biochemical pathway appears to utilize nitric oxide in one of its alternate redox states, the nitrosonium ion, transnitrosylating a free sulfhydryl group belonging to a cysteine residue tentatively identified as being in the region linking the S6 transmembrane domain to the ligand binding domain."
https://openalex.org/W2085732744,"In voltage-dependent K+ channels, each of the four identical subunits contributes one pore loop to the central ion selectivity unit at the interface between the subunits. The pore loop is also the target for scorpion venom peptide inhibitors. These inhibitors bind at the pore entryway between the four subunits and can assume any one of four orientations. The orientations become distinguishable only if the binding site symmetry is disrupted. We have used mutagenesis and site-directed chemical modification to alter pore loop amino acids in either one or four subunits. The effects of these alterations on inhibitor affinity define the eccentricity of amino acids in the pore entryway and imply a different secondary structure for the amino and carboxyl ends of the pore loop."
https://openalex.org/W2099711455,"Proteolytic processing of capsid assembly protein precursors by herpesvirus proteases is essential for virion maturation. A 2.5 Å crystal structure of the human cytomegalovirus protease catalytic domain has been determined by X-ray diffraction. The structure defines a new class of serine protease with respect to global-fold topology and has a catalytic triad consisting of Ser-132, His-63, and His-157 in contrast with the Ser-His-Asp triads found in other serine proteases. However, catalytic machinery for activating the serine nucleophile and stabilizing a tetrahedral transition state is oriented similarly to that for members of the trypsin-like and subtilisin-like serine protease families. Formation of the active dimer is mediated primarily by burying a helix of one protomer into a deep cleft in the protein surface of the other."
https://openalex.org/W2027808289,"There are at least five subfamilies of Shaker-like K+ channels. The diverse functions of K+ channels are thought to be further modulated by hydrophilic β subunits. Here we report that Kvβ1 inactivates RCK4 and Shaker B K+ channels of the Kv1 subfamily, but not Shal2 of the Kv4 subfamily. This correlates the subfamily-specific binding of Kvβ1 to the cytoplasmic N-terminal domains of Kv1 α subunits. We map the Kvβ1-binding site to a region overlapping NABKv1, a domain that specifies different Kv1 α subunits to form heterotetramers. Using chimeric α subunits, we demonstrate that NABKv1 is essential for the Kvβ1-mediated inactivation. These results suggest that Kvβ1 modulates a subset of K+ channels through the specific assembly of α–β complexes and reveal the dual function of the NAB domain in mediating the assembly of both α–α and α–β complexes."
https://openalex.org/W2016551060,"Many activity-dependent changes in synaptic efficacy occur through elevations in postsynaptic calcium triggered by glutamate receptor activation. Here, the postsynaptic, neuron-specific microtubule-associated protein MAP2 is identified as a target of bidirectional calcium-dependent signaling pathways activated by glutamate. Glutamate produced a biphasic change in MAP2: a rapid, transient increase in phosphorylation mediated by metabotropic receptors and attenuated by inhibitors of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases and protein kinase C, followed by a persistent dephosphorylation of MAP2 mediated by NMDA receptors and activation of the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase 2B (calcineurin). Thus, a single transmembrane signal, glutamate, and the increased intracellular calcium it evokes can have opposing actions on a postsynaptic target phosphoprotein. The phosphorylation state of MAP2 determines its interaction with microtubules and actin filaments, suggesting that glutamatergic regulation of MAP2 phosphorylation may transduce neural activity into modifications in dendritic structure."
https://openalex.org/W2038898938,"During embryogenesis, cells from the ventral and dorsal parts of the somites give rise to sclerotome and dermomyotome, respectively. Dermomyotome contains skeletal muscle precursors that are determined by the MyoD family of myogenic factors. We have isolated a novel myogenic repressor, I-mf (nhibitor of yoD amily), which is highly expressed in the sclerotome. In contrast, MyoD family members are concentrated in the dermomyotome. We demonstrate that I-mf inhibits the transactivation activity of the MyoD family and represses myogenesis. I-mf associates with MyoD family members and retains them in the cytoplasm by masking their nuclear localization signals. I-mf can also interfere with the DNA binding activity of MyoD family members. We postulate that I-mf plays an important role in the patterning of the somite early in development."
https://openalex.org/W2006535640,"The segregation of neural and epidermal progenitors in Drosophila requires the activity of transcription factors encoded by the proneural genes and the genes of the E(SPL)-C. Persistent expression of two genes of the E(SPL)-C suppresses neural development. Embryos exhibit conspicuous central neural hypoplasia and lack sensory organs; imaginal sensory organs are also affected. Suppression of neural development is associated with suppression of the activity of proneural genes. DNA binding is not essential for this effect. Large cells with characteristics of neuroblasts segregate normally in embryos, but these cells fail to express various markers, and the segregated cells and/or their progeny eventually die. These findings indicate that proneural and E(spl) proteins exert antagonistic functions."
https://openalex.org/W2032544386,"The specification and patterning of cell fates by a morphogen gradient is a unifying theme of developmental biology, yet little evidence exists for the presence of gradients in vivo or to show how such putative gradients form. Vg1 and activin are candidate morphogens involved in Xenopus mesoderm induction. This study suggests that these TGFβ family members act on adjacent cells but do not travel through the intact extracellular space to induce distant cells directly. Moreover, we present evidence for the presence of secondary inducing signals that could be involved in relaying signals to distant cells. These results suggest that if a localized cellular source of an inducer acts to pattern mesodermal cells at a distance in Xenopus embryos, it does so by a relay mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2007537092,"A variety of receptors coupled to GTP-binding regulatory proteins (G proteins) initiate signals that culminate in activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases ERK1 and ERK2. We demonstrate here that the human 5-HT1A receptor expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells similarly promotes activation of ERK1 and ERK2, but that the pathway used does not conform entirely to those proposed previously for G protein-coupled receptors. Activation of ERK2 by the 5-HT1A receptor-selective agonist 8-hydroxy-N,N-dipropyl-2-aminotetralin hydrobromide (8-OH-DPAT) was inhibited completely by pertussis toxin and substantially by prolonged treatment of cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. The implied requirement for protein kinase C, however, was negated in studies with bisindolylmaleimide and Ro-31-8220, which, although completely inhibiting activation of ERK2 by phorbol ester, had no impact on activation by 8-OH-DPAT. The anticipated inhibition by the tyrosine kinase inhibitors genistein and herbimycin A, moreover, was marginal at best. As expected for a Gi-coupled receptor, the inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase wortmannin and LY294002 inhibited activation of ERK2, albeit only partly (70%). Of significance, an inhibitor of a phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C, tricyclodecan-9-yl-xanthogenate (D609), caused a similar degree of inhibition. When the two types of inhibitors were combined, an almost complete inhibition was achieved. Our data suggest that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C represent components of different, but partly overlapping pathways that can account almost entirely for the activation of ERK2 by the 5-HT1A receptor.

https://openalex.org/W1999383433,"Few experimental data illuminate the relationship between the molecular structures that mediate ion conduction through voltage-dependent ion channels and the structures responsible for sensing transmembrane voltage and controlling gating. To fill this void, we have used a strongly cationic, mutated μ-conotoxin peptide, which only partially blocks current through voltage-dependent sodium channels, to study voltage-dependent activation gating in both bound and unbound channels. When the peptide binds to the ion-conducting pore, it inhibits channel opening, necessitating stronger depolarization for channel activation. We show that this activation shift could result entirely from electrostatic inhibition of the movement of the voltage-sensing S4 charges and estimate the approximate physical distance through which the S4 charges move."
https://openalex.org/W1983473899,"It is widely thought that mammalian Schwann cells do not express P0, the major glycoprotein in peripheral myelin, unless they are induced to do so by axonal signals that can be mimicked by agents that trigger cAMP signaling pathways. In contrast, we find that cultured Schwann cells make large amounts of P0 without the addition of any axonal-like signal, provided they have not been exposed to serum during the culture process. We also report that glial growth factor/neuregulin inhibits this constitutive P0 expression. Myelin basic protein is regulated in a similar way. We suggest that expression of P0 by Schwann cells before the onset of myelination may be prevented by inhibitory signals within the nerve, rather than by the absence of a positive signal from axons."
https://openalex.org/W1988299049,"To test whether glial cell line–derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) regulates the development of nigral dopaminergic neurons in vivo, neonatal rats received bilateral injections of GDNF into the striatum. Injections at postnatal day 2 induced a unique transient behavioral pattern characterized by forelimb hyperflexure, clawed toes of all limbs, and a kinked tail. Parallel to the behavioral changes, the levels of striatal and ventral mesencephalic dopamine and serotonin were increased from 60% to 100% with a proportional increase of principal metabolite levels. GDNF increased tyrosine hydroxylase activity in the ventral mesencephalon, but did not affect striatal activity of choline acetyltransferase and GABA uptake. GDNF failed to induce sprouting of dopaminergic neurites. Our findings suggest that during development striatal GDNF regulates the capacity of dopaminergic and of serotonergic neurons for neurotransmitter production and release."

The aims of the present work were to validate the isolated cardiomyocyte preparation as a model to study insulin action on glycolysis and to investigate the insulin-signaling pathway leading to PFK-2 activation. Radiochemicals (Amersham); wortmannin, phloretin, 2-deoxyglucose, myelin basic protein (MBP), and α-L-phosphatidylinositol (PI) (Sigma); rapamycin (Biomol); fatty acid-free fraction V bovine serum albumin and collagenase A (Boehringer Mannheim); anti-MAPK antibodies (anti-Erk-1 and anti-Erk-2) and anti-p70 S6 kinase antibodies (Santa Cruz); and anti-PI 3-kinase antibodies (U.B.I.) were obtained as indicated. PD 98059 was a generous gift from Prof. P. Cohen (University of Dundee, Scotland). Stock solutions of 10 mM wortmannin, 10 mM rapamycin, and 50 mM PD 98059 were stored at -20°C in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) and diluted in 0.9%percnt; NaCl before use. The cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor peptide (TYADFIASGRTGRRNAIHD) (17Scott J.D. Glaccum M.D. Fischer E.H. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1613-1616Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and the small p70 S6 kinase peptide (RRLSSLRA) (18Flotow H. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3074-3078Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were synthesized by Dr. J. Lucchetti (Ludwig Institute, Brussels). All other biochemicals were from Sigma or Boehringer. Isolated cardiomyocytes were prepared by the method of Fischer et al. (19Fischer Y. Rose H. Kammermeier H. Life Sci. 1991; 49: 1679-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) originally described for Sprague-Dawley rats and which we have also applied to Wistar rats. The perfusion medium was a Krebs-Henseleit medium without Ca2+ and supplemented with 5 mM glucose, 2 mM pyruvate, and 10 mM Hepes (pH 7.4) in equilibrium with O2/CO2 (95%percnt;, 5%percnt;). Two hearts were perfused in parallel, and the cardiomyocytes from both hearts were resuspended in the same buffer to obtain a single preparation. The cardiomyocytes (about 20 to 30 mg wet weight of cells/ml) were incubated at 37°C in 20-ml vials with constant agitation in the presence of the indicated additions and in a medium containing 134 mM NaCl, 4.7 mM KCl, 1.25 mM MgSO4, 1.2 mM KH2PO4, 12 mM Hepes at pH 7.4, 1 mM CaCl2, 2%percnt; bovine serum albumin, and, except where otherwise stated, 5 mM glucose. When cardiomyocytes were incubated in the presence of wortmannin, rapamycin, or PD 98059, untreated cells received the same amount of Me2SO. The wet weight of each cell preparation was measured by weighing the cell pellet after centrifugation (10,000 × g for 30 s). The yield of cardiomyocytes was about 8 × 106 cells from a single heart of a Sprague-Dawley rat, and about 45%percnt; less from a Wistar rat. By trypan blue exclusion, cell viability was estimated to be more than 95%percnt;, among which about 80%percnt; were nonbeating, rod-shaped cells. The overall effects of insulin on 2-deoxyglucose transport, glycogen synthesis, and Fru-2,6-P2 content were qualitatively the same in cardiomyocytes from both rat strains, although the magnitude of the insulin effect was 30-50%percnt; greater in Sprague-Dawley than in Wistar cardiomyocytes. Most of the studies reported here were performed with Wistar rats because this strain has been used for years in our laboratory. Hearts from Wistar rats were perfused with Krebs-Henseleit buffer in the presence of 5 mM glucose and 1.25 mM CaCl2 for 10 min (5Hue L. Maisin L. Rider M.H. Biochem. J. 1988; 251: 541-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 20Mowbray J. Ottaway J.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1973; 36: 362-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) with or without 0.25 µM rapamycin, followed by a 30-min perfusion with or without 0.1 µM insulin. At the end of the perfusion, the hearts were freeze-clamped between aluminium blocks precooled in liquid nitrogen, for measurement of Fru-2,6-P2 content and enzyme assays. Glycogen synthesis was measured by the incorporation of 5 mM [U-14C]glucose (40 µCi/mmol) into glycogen in cardiomyocytes incubated for 30 min (21Hue L. Bontemps F. Hers H.G. Biochem. J. 1975; 152: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). The amount of 2-[2-3H]deoxyglucose (1 µM; 100 mCi/mmol) taken up by the cells in a 20-min incubation without glucose was measured as described (19Fischer Y. Rose H. Kammermeier H. Life Sci. 1991; 49: 1679-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Fru-2,6-P2 content was measured (22Van Schaftingen E. Lederer B. Bartrons R. Hers H.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 129: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar) in cells incubated for the indicated periods of time in the presence of 5 mM glucose, except where otherwise stated. Glycolytic flux was measured by the detritiation of [3-3H]glucose (6Deprá C. Rider M.H. Veitch K. Hue L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13274-13279PubMed Google Scholar), which gives an estimation of the flux through 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase. For the measurement of PFK-2 activity, cell pellets (about 30 mg of cells) were resuspended in 1 ml of cold 20 mM Hepes at pH 7.5, 30 mM KCl, 20 mM KF, 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mM fructose 6-phosphate, 0.3 mM glucose 6-phosphate and frozen in liquid N2. The cells were thawed and homogenized at 4°C with an Ultra-Turrax (3 × 20 s). After centrifugation (10,000 × g for 5 min), 5-20%percnt; polyethylene glycol (PEG) 6000 fractions were prepared from four pooled cell preparations. This PEG fraction was assayed for lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (23Vassault A. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. 3rd Ed. Verlag Chemie, Weinheim1983: 118-126Google Scholar) and PFK-2. PFK-2 was assayed at pH 7.1 in the presence of 2 mM fructose 6-phosphate and 5 mM MgATP (7Rider M.H. Hue L. FEBS Lett. 1984; 176: 484-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). For PFK-2 measurement in perfused hearts, frozen samples were homogenized in 5 volumes of homogenization buffer (see above) for PEG fractionation. MAP kinase was measured by the phosphorylation of MBP in immunoprecipitates from cardiomyocyte extracts. The homogenization procedure, immunoprecipitation (10 µl of antibody for 5-10 mg of cells) of MAPK, and the assay conditions were as described (24Krause U. Rider M.H. Hue L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16668-16673Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The assay was performed on immunoprecipitates corresponding to 5-10 mg of cells. MBP was separated by SDS-PAGE in gels containing 15%percnt; (w/v) acrylamide. Gels were dried and autoradiographed. Radioactivity incorporated into MBP was measured by phosphorimaging (Molecular Dynamics). The results are expressed as percentage of control values. p70 S6 kinase was assayed in immunoprecipitates from perfused hearts by phosphorylation of the small ribosomal S6 peptide (RRLSSLRA) (24Krause U.

Biochem. 1991; 199: 723-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Each heart was homogenized (4 × 20 s, Ultra-Turrax) in 5 volumes (v/w) of buffer containing 20 mM sodium β-glycerol phosphate, pH 7.2, 20 mM NaF, 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM benzamidine-Cl, 4 µg/ml leupeptin, 0.2 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 0.3%percnt; (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol. After centrifugation (5000 × g for 20 min), a 5%percnt; (w/v) PEG 6000 fraction was prepared and resuspended in 1 ml of homogenization buffer for each heart. p70 S6 kinase present in 0.5 ml of this fraction was immunoprecipitated with 10 µl of anti-p70 S6 kinase antibodies bound to Protein A-Sepharose beads and resuspended in homogenization buffer. p70 S6 kinase was assayed (24Krause U. Rider M.H. Hue L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16668-16673Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) with 32P incorporation into small S6 peptide measured as described (24Krause U. Rider M.H. Hue L.

Biochem. 1991; 199: 723-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). PI 3-kinase activity was measured in immunoprecipitates from homogenates of cardiomyocyte pellets (20 mg of cells). Preparation of homogenates, immunoprecipitation (0.5 µl of antibody for 10-15 mg of cells), and assay conditions were as described (24Krause U. Rider M.H. Hue L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16668-16673Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The assay was performed on immunoprecipitates corresponding to 10-15 mg of cells. [32P]Phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate was separated by TLC and radioactivity was measured by phosphorimaging. One unit of enzyme activity corresponds to the formation of 1 µmol of product/min under the assay conditions. The activity of PFK-2 in microunits is expressed per unit of LDH to correct for differences in homogenization and recovery. The results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. for the indicated number of individual experiments. The statistical significance of the results was calculated by the Student's t test as indicated. The glucose-dependent accumulation of Fru-2,6-P2 was studied in control- and insulin-treated cells incubated for 30 min. In control cells, the concentration of Fru-2,6-P2 was maximal (2 pmol of Fru-2,6-P2/mg of cells) with 0.5 mM glucose, whereas in insulin-treated cells, Fru-2,6-P2 content reached a plateau (10 pmol of Fru-2,6-P2/mg of cells) with concentrations of glucose greater than 2.5 mM. Therefore, physiological concentrations of glucose (5 mM) were saturating in both conditions. The time course of the insulin effect on 2-deoxyglucose uptake and glycogen synthesis was similar (Fig. 1A). This differed from the time course of Fru-2,6-P2 accumulation and PFK-2 activation by insulin (Fig. 1B). A maximal activation of PFK-2 was observed within 1 min and persisted for 30 min of incubation (Fig. 1B), whereas the increase in Fru-2,6-P2 content was preceded by a lag period of a few minutes and thereafter continued during 30 min of incubation. This rise in Fru-2,6-P2 correlated with an increase in flux through 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase as measured by detritiation of [3-3H]glucose (Fig. 1B). The insulin-induced activation of PFK-2 was independent of glucose transport, since a similar activation was observed when the cells were incubated with fructose or without a carbohydrate substrate (results not shown). The concentration of insulin giving half-maximal effect was 1.7 ± 0.2 nM for 2-deoxyglucose uptake, 1.0 ± 0.1 nM for the increase in glycogen synthesis, and 1.4 ± 0.4 nM for the increase in Fru-2,6-P2 content (n = 3). The mechanisms of insulin action in cardiomyocytes were investigated. The effects of wortmannin on the insulin-induced stimulation of 2-deoxyglucose transport, glycogen synthesis, and Fru-2,6-P2 content were studied in cells preincubated for 15 min with various concentrations of wortmannin before the addition of 0.1 µM insulin. Wortmannin inhibited the insulin-induced stimulation of 2-deoxyglucose transport, glycogen synthesis, and Fru-2,6-P2 content, and the effect was maximal between 300 and 1000 nM wortmannin (Fig. 2). The concentration of wortmannin giving half-maximal inhibition was about 60-80 nM for the three parameters. The effect of insulin on PFK-2 activity was blocked by wortmannin, suggesting that PI 3-kinase activation is involved in the insulin-induced activation of PFK-2 (Table I). By contrast, pretreatment of the cells with rapamycin did not affect the insulin-induced increase in glycogen synthesis and Fru-2,6-P2 content (not shown). Likewise, the insulin-induced activation of PFK-2 was unaffected by rapamycin (Table I), suggesting that p70 S6 kinase activation is not required for this insulin effect. Moreover, preincubation with PD 98059 to prevent MAPK and MAPKAPK-1 activation or with the combination of rapamycin and PD 98059, to block both the p70 S6 kinase and MAPK branches of the insulin cascade, had no effect on PFK-2 activation (Table I). To validate the results obtained with these inhibitors, we measured their effects on PI 3-kinase, Erk-2, and p70 S6 kinase activity. Insulin induced a 2-fold transient activation of PI 3-kinase, which was maximal at 1 min and disappeared at 5 min. This activation was completely inhibited by 0.3 µM wortmannin (Table I). Similarly, to ensure that rapamycin was active, we measured its effect on p70 S6 kinase activity. Since p70 S6 kinase activity was too low to be measured in cardiomyocytes, we studied its activation in perfused rat hearts. p70 S6 kinase activity was approximately tripled by insulin treatment (Fig. 3). In perfusions with 0.25 µM rapamycin, the insulin-induced activation of p70 S6 kinase was completely abolished. However, in these hearts, the insulin-induced activation of PFK-2 was unaffected by rapamycin, confirming that p70 S6 kinase is not required for the insulin-induced activation of PFK-2 (Fig. 3). A slight increase in PFK-2 activity by rapamycin treatment was observed in these experiments (Fig. 3), although no difference was found in isolated cardiomyocytes (Table I). There was no significant effect of insulin on Erk-2 activity in cardiomyocytes incubated for 2 min (Table I) or 5 or 10 min (not shown) with insulin, confirming the lack of effect of rapamycin and PD 98059 on the insulin-induced activation of PFK-2 (Table I). A 3-fold increase in Erk-2 activity was observed in cardiomyocytes incubated with phorbol ester (results not shown). This is in agreement with previous findings (26Bogoyevitch M.A. Glennon P.E. Sugden P.H. FEBS Lett. 1993; 317: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) and shows that the MAPK cascade could be activated in our cell preparations. However, in cardiomyocytes incubated with phorbol ester, no change in Fru-2,6-P2 content or PFK-2 activity was observed (results not shown), supporting in vitro studies showing that phosphorylation of purified heart PFK-2 by PKC had no effect on its activity (27Kitamura K. Kangawa K. Matsuo H. Uyeda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16796-16801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The isolated cardiomyocyte model has enabled us to confirm not only the insulin-induced stimulation of glucose transport and glycogen synthesis (28Rider M.H. Vandamme J. Lebeau E. Vertommen D. Vidal H. Rousseau G.G. Vandekerckhove J. Hue L. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 405-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 29Kohn A.D. Kovacina K.S. Roth R.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4288-4295Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar), but also the activation of PFK-2 and the resulting increase in Fru-2,6-P2 content (4Lawson J.W.R. Uyeda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3165-3173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Hue L. Maisin L. Rider M.H. Biochem. J. 1988; 251: 541-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 6Deprá C. Rider M.H.

Therefore, PFK-2 is a target of insulin action in the control of heart glycolysis. The activation of PFK-2 by insulin in isolated cardiomyocytes was not a consequence of the hormone-induced stimulation of glucose transport. The effects of insulin to stimulate glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis were abolished by wortmannin, suggesting that PI 3-kinase activation mediates these processes (10Saltiel A.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: E375-E385PubMed Google Scholar, 11Lazar D.F. Wiese R.J. Brady M.J. Mastick C.C. Waters S.B. Yamauchi K. Pessin J.E. Cuatrecasas P. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20801-20807Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Similarly, the insulin-induced increases in Fru-2,6-P2 and PFK-2 activity were abolished by wortmannin, implying that PI 3-kinase is involved. However, because the specificity of wortmannin for PI 3-kinase is subject to several observations (30Hunter T. Cell. 1995; 83: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), the evidence is only indirect. The activation of PFK-2 by insulin was unaffected by rapamycin and PD 98059, suggesting that activation of p70 S6 kinase, MAPK, or MAPKAPK-1 were not required for the insulin-induced activation of PFK-2. The mechanism of activation of PFK-2 by insulin is probably the result of covalent modification. In vitro studies demonstrated that heart PFK-2 was phosphorylated and activated by the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (27Kitamura K. Kangawa K. Matsuo H. Uyeda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16796-16801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Rider M.H. Vandamme J. Lebeau E. Vertommen D. Vidal H. Rousseau G.G. Vandekerckhove J. Hue L. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 405-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This activation resulted from a decrease in Km for fructose 6-phosphate (6Deprá C. Rider M.H. Veitch K. Hue L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13274-13279PubMed Google Scholar, 27Kitamura K. Kangawa K. Matsuo H. Uyeda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16796-16801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Rider M.H. Vandamme J. Lebeau E. Vertommen D. Vidal H. Rousseau G.G. Vandekerckhove J. Hue L. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 405-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The involvement of this protein kinase in PFK-2 activation by insulin can be ruled out, because cyclic AMP is not expected to increase after insulin stimulation and the effect of insulin on PFK-2 was to increase the Vmax without affecting the Km for fructose 6-phosphate. A likely candidate for mediating insulin action on PFK-2 is the novel Ser/Thr kinase, called protein kinase B or Akt/RAC (29Kohn A.D. Kovacina K.S. Roth R.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4288-4295Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 31Franke F. Yang S. Chan T.O. Datta K. Kazlauskas A. Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R. Tsichlis P.N.

Biochem. 1991; 201: 475-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar) and is activated through PI 3-kinase after insulin stimulation. Protein kinase B activation by insulin is indeed sensitive to wortmannin, but not to rapamycin. According to a recent study in cultured rat skeletal muscle L6 cells (32Cross D.A.E. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4212) Google Scholar), Akt/RAC, but not p70 S6 kinase or MAPKAPK-1, is responsible for the insulin-induced inactivation of glycogen synthase kinase-3 and thus glycogen synthase activation. The possible phosphorylation and activation of heart PFK-2 by Akt/RAC is currently being studied in our laboratory. We thank Prof. P. Cohen (University of Dundee, Dundee, Scotland) for his generous gift of PD 98059 and Dr. J. Lucchetti (Ludwig Institute, Brussels) for synthesizing the peptides."
https://openalex.org/W2078297479,"Proton transfer to calcium channels results in rapid fluctuations between two non-zero conductance levels when the current is carried by monovalent cations. A combination of site-directed mutagenesis and single-channel recording techniques were used to identify the unique proton acceptor site as Glu-1086, a conserved glutamate residue located in the S5-S6 linker of motif III of calcium channels. Glu-1086 is part of an array of four glutamate residues in the pore-lining region of the channel conferring the high selectivity of calcium channels. Titration of Glu-1086 yielded a pKa value of 7.91 which is different from that expected for a free glutamic acid side-chain carboxyl. Proposed electrostatic interactions between charged nearby residues can account only in part for this phenomenon since individual elimination of the other three glutamate residues only slightly decreased the pKa of Glu-1086. These data, in addition to identifying the proton acceptor site, provide evidence for the influence of the microenvironment in forming the asymmetry of the conducting pathway of calcium channels.

These data, in addition to identifying the proton acceptor site, provide evidence for the influence of the microenvironment in forming the asymmetry of the conducting pathway of calcium channels. Voltage-gated calcium channels are of pivotal importance in translating electrical events produced by membrane potential changes into biological activity such as secretion, contraction, and modulation of gene expression (1Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA1992Google Scholar). The primary characteristic of calcium channels, viz. high selectivity of Ca2+ over monovalent ions, is fundamental to biological function. In recent years, numerous observations have been provided bearing on the molecular nature of the high selectivity filters of calcium channels. Thus, it appears now well-established that the region responsible for the high selectivity filtering is in the S5-S6 linker of each motif and comprised by four non-identical glutamate residues (2Kim M.S. Morii T. Sun L. Imoto K. Mori Y. FEBS Lett. 1993; 318: 145-148Google Scholar, 3Tang S. Mikala G. Bahinski A. Yatani A. Varadi G. Schwartz A. J. Biol.

Tsien R.W. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1121-1132Google Scholar) probably asymmetrically positioned. Permeation of ions through these channels can be modulated by extracellular pH, and the existence of a single proton-sensitive group located close to the external mouth of the calcium channel has been postulated for several years (8Prod'hom B. Pietrobon D. Hess P. Nature. 1987; 329: 243-246Google Scholar, 9Pietrobon D. Prod'hom B. Hess P. Nature. 1988; 333: 373-376Google Scholar, 10Pietrobon D. Prod'hom B. Hess P. J. Gen. Physiol. 1989; 94: 1-21Google Scholar, 11Prod'hom B. Pietrobon D. Hess P. J. Gen. Physiol. 1989; 94: 23-45Google Scholar). Functionally, the interaction of protons with the binding site results in two conductance levels of the open channel current, when monovalent ions are used as the charge carrier (8Prod'hom B. Pietrobon D. Hess P. Nature. 1987; 329: 243-246Google Scholar, 9Pietrobon D. Prod'hom B. Hess P. Nature. 1988; 333: 373-376Google Scholar, 10Pietrobon D. Prod'hom B. Hess P. J. Gen. Physiol. 1989; 94: 1-21Google Scholar, 11Prod'hom B. Pietrobon D. Hess P. J. Gen. Physiol. 1989; 94: 23-45Google Scholar). The voltage independence of protonation and deprotonation events and the exclusive accessibility of protons to the site from the exterior of the channel strongly suggest a location of the protonation site on the external surface of the channel protein, outside the transmembrane electric field (8Prod'hom B. Pietrobon D. Hess P. Nature. 1987; 329: 243-246Google Scholar, 10Pietrobon D. Prod'hom B. Hess P. J. Gen. Physiol. 1989; 94: 1-21Google Scholar, 11Prod'hom B. Pietrobon D. Hess P. J. Gen. Physiol. 1989; 94: 23-45Google Scholar). It is thought that proton blockage of calcium channels is associated with a distinct conformational change in the channel structure, rather than with any specific interaction with elements of the ion-conducting pathway (8Prod'hom B. Pietrobon D. Hess P. Nature. 1987; 329: 243-246Google Scholar, 9Pietrobon D. Prod'hom B. Hess P. Nature. 1988; 333: 373-376Google Scholar, 10Pietrobon D. Prod'hom B. Hess P. J. Gen.

Science. 1994; 265: 1852-1856Google Scholar) recently showed that in the pore of the cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) 1The abbreviations used are: CNGcyclic nucleotide-gatedMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. channel, four glutamate residues give rise to two identical and independent proton binding sites. If the CNG channel consists of four identical subunits to form the ion conducting pathway, the four glutamate side chains have to be arranged in a precise way to form only two sites. On the other hand, for calcium channels, there is evidence for the existence of one proton binding site. This suggests that either all four glutamate residues will participate equally in the binding of a proton, or that only one glutamate residue is able to interact with a proton. cyclic nucleotide-gated 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid.

Neuron. 1995; 15: 1121-1132Google Scholar) has opened the possibility of determining whether the proton block directly targets the mechanism of ion permeation or whether other pH-dependent conformational changes are responsible for the phenomenon. The construction of plasmids carrying cDNAs that encode the wild type (hHT-1) and the mutant Ca2+ channel α1 subunits E677A, E1086A, and E1387A has been described previously (3Tang S. Mikala G. Bahinski A. Yatani A. Varadi G. Schwartz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13026-13029Google Scholar, 5Mikala G. Bahinski A. Yatani A. Tang S. Schwartz A.

Natl. Acad. Sci. 1993; 90: 6228-6232Google Scholar). The mutant E334A (A2411C) was constructed within the EcoRI (2098)/ClaI (2663) cassette using the Sculptor kit (Amersham). The sequence-verified EcoRI/BamHI (2498) cassette was then ligated into hHT-1 to replace the corresponding wild type fragment. cRNAs specific for α1, α2a, and hβ3 (17Klückner U. Mikala G. Varadi M.

Science. 1988; 241: 1661-1664Google Scholar) subunits were synthesized by in vitro run-off transcription, as described previously (13Schultz D. Mikala G. Yatani A. Engle D.B. Iles D.E. Seger B. Olde Weghuis D. Klückner U. Wakamori N. Wang J.-J. Melvin D. Varadi G. Schwartz A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1993; 90: 6228-6232Google Scholar). Xenopus laevis oocytes at stage V-VI were injected with 40-80 nl of the cRNA (0.1-1 µg/µl) solution (13Schultz D. Mikala G. Yatani A. Engle D.B. Iles D.E. Seger B. Olde Weghuis D. Klückner U. Wakamori N. Wang J.-J. Melvin D. Varadi G. Schwartz A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1993; 90: 6228-6232Google Scholar). The oocytes were screened for the expression of calcium channel current by a two-electrode voltage clamp. In oocytes showing Ba2+ (40 mM) currents larger than -100 nA and responding to calcium agonists Bay K 8644 (1 µM) or FPL 64176 (3 µM) with an at least 3-fold increase in the peak current amplitude, the vitelline membrane was removed. Single-channel activity was recorded from cell-attached patches (14Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F. J. Pfluegers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Google Scholar) using an Axon 200A amplifier (Axon Instruments). The membrane potential of the oocytes was “zeroed” with a high potassium medium composed of (in millimolar): 20 KCl, 100 potassium glutamate, 5 EGTA, 10 HEPES (pH 7.4 with KOH). The patch electrodes were pulled from thick walled borosilicate glass (Hilgenberg, Malsberg, Germany) and polished with a microforge to an inner diameter of 0.5-2 µm. They were coated with pyoloform (15Wendt-Gallitelli M.F. Isenberg G. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: H574-H583Google Scholar) and had resistances in the order of 2-10 megaohms when filled with the recording solutions. The pipette solutions were composed of 150 mM K+, 5 mM EDTA, and 10 mM concentrations of the buffer MES (pKa 6.15), HEPES (pKa 7.55), and TRIZMA (pKa 8.1) used at the appropriate pH. We have calculated the affinity constants of EDTA-calcium complex (16Fabiato A. Fabiato F. J. Physiol. (Paris). 1979; 75: 463-505Google Scholar) for pH range 6.0-9.0 and found that EDTA effectively chelates the trace amount of divalent cations (Ca2+, Mg2+) present in the solution. The single-channel currents were filtered at 5-10 kHz, digitized at 25-50 kHz, and stored for off-line analysis. Leakage and capacitive currents were corrected by subtracting blank records (ISO2 software MFK, Germany). Single-channel current amplitude was obtained by fitting the amplitude histogram with the sum of Gaussian distributions. Current-voltage relationships were fitted by straight lines using a least square algorithm resulting in the slope as the conductance. Data are presented as mean values ± S.E. Only well resolved openings were measured; therefore, all single-channel experiments were conducted in the presence of 1 µM Bay K 8644 (gift from Bayer Pharmaceutical Co.) or 3 µM FPL 64176 (gift from Fisons, Plc.). Statistical significance was determined by Student's t test. All recordings were done at room temperature (22 ± 2°C). The L-type calcium channel was identified by its sensitivity to calcium channel antagonists (almost complete block of channel activity by 50 µM nitrendipine), agonists, and by its voltage dependence. Since the presence of calcium agonists does not alter the permeation properties of native L-type calcium channel (7Ellinor P.T. Yang J. Sather W.A. Zhang J.-F. Tsien R.W. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1121-1132Google Scholar, 8Prod'hom B. Pietrobon D. Hess P. Nature. 1987; 329: 243-246Google Scholar, 9Pietrobon D. Prod'hom B. Hess P. Nature. 1988; 333: 373-376Google Scholar) and certain pore mutant L-type calcium channels (3Tang S. Mikala G. Bahinski A. Yatani A. Varadi G. Schwartz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13026-13029Google Scholar, 6Yatani A. Bahinski A. Mikala G. Yamamoto S. Schwartz A. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 315-323Google Scholar), they were used to increase the amount of well-resolvable channel openings. The kinetics of the transitions between the two conductance states were idealized by setting a discriminator at 50%percnt; of the current between the levels. We detected two conductance states using a cell-attached configuration of the patch clamp technique and 150 mM K+ as the charge carrier in Xenopus oocytes expressing wild type human heart α1 (hHTα1), α2a, and hβ3 subunits (Fig. 1A, upper part). The current fluctuates between three levels: the zero current level of the closed channel (indicated by the dashed line), a partially blocked, and the fully open levels. When the amplitude histogram is fitted with Gaussian curves, the three “humps” represent three conductance levels of the cloned L-type calcium channel. The fitted Gaussian curve of the second hump reached a maximum at -1.12 pA, a value representing the mean current amplitude through the protonated channel. The current amplitude through the deprotonated channel exhibited a mean amplitude value of -3.04 pA (Fig. 1A, lower left). From measurements at different test potentials, conductance values of 36 pS for the protonated and 107 pS for the unprotonated conductance states were obtained (Fig. 1A, lower right). These values are comparable with those which have been reported for L-type calcium channels in cardiac myocytes or undifferentiated PC12 cells (8Prod'hom B. Pietrobon D. Hess P. Nature. 1987; 329: 243-246Google Scholar, 9Pietrobon D. Prod'hom B. Hess P. Nature. 1988; 333: 373-376Google Scholar, 10Pietrobon D. Prod'hom B. Hess P. J. Gen. Physiol. 1989; 94: 1-21Google Scholar, 11Prod'hom B. Pietrobon D. Hess P. J. Gen. Physiol. 1989; 94: 23-45Google Scholar). Representative segments of current traces recorded at the indicated pH values are shown in Fig. 1B. At a pH value of 9.0, the current also fluctuates between levels described above; however, the fractional lifetime of the low conductance state is very short. As the pH decreases, the time that the open channel spends in the partially blocked state increases. Inspection of the traces at the pH of 8.0 shows that the fraction of time the channel is in the low and the high conductance state is about equal. At more “acidic pH values,” the open channel spends an even longer time in the low conductance state. The equilibrium probability of the protonated and unprotonated states was determined by the relative areas under the corresponding Gaussian curves. These values, plotted against the pH and fitted with a Hill equation provided a pKa value of 7.91 (Fig. 1C). The Hill coefficent of 0.85 suggests a single class of proton binding sites. These values are similar to those reported for cardiac myocytes (10Pietrobon D. Prod'hom B. Hess P. J. Gen. Physiol. 1989; 94: 1-21Google Scholar). Very recently it has been shown that the high selectivity of calcium channels for Ca2+ over Na+ or K+ ions resides in conserved glutamate residues located in each of the four P regions of the channel (2Kim M.S. Morii T. Sun L. Imoto K. Mori Y. FEBS Lett. 1993; 318: 145-148Google Scholar, 3Tang S. Mikala G. Bahinski A. Yatani A. Varadi G. Schwartz A. J. Biol.

Tsien R.W. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1121-1132Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been reported that in the pore of the cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channel, which has permeation properties similar to the calcium channel, specific glutamate residues give rise to two identical and independent proton-binding sites (12Root M.J. MacKinnon R. Science. 1994; 265: 1852-1856Google Scholar). Since the CNG channel consists of four identical subunits surrounding a central pore, the four glutamate side chains have to be arranged in a precise way to form only two sites. In our present study, the finding that in calcium channels there is only one protonated state suggests that there is either only one functionally important acidic group with an apparent pKa value of approximately 8 or that more sites participate, equally or nonequally, in the proton binding. To identify the site(s) at which protons bind, we individually replaced the four glutamate residues that are essential for high affinity Ca2+ binding (2Kim M.S. Morii T. Sun L. Imoto K. Mori Y. FEBS Lett. 1993; 318: 145-148Google Scholar, 3Tang S. Mikala G. Bahinski A. Yatani A. Varadi G. Schwartz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13026-13029Google Scholar, 4Yang J. Ellinor P.T. Sather W.A.

Zhang J.-F. Tsien R.W. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1121-1132Google Scholar) with alanines. Alanine was chosen over glutamine because the strong electron delocalization in the amide group of glutamine makes this group capable of associating with protons (19Bash H. Tora H.

Inspection of selected records (Fig. 2A) reveals that after replacement of the glutamates in motifs I (E334A), II (E677A), and IV (E1387A), current fluctuations between the two different conducting levels were observed that were similar to the wild type control. This finding demonstrates that replacement of these three glutamate residues with alanine has no major impact on the proton-induced current fluctuation of the channel. In contrast, when Glu-1086 (motif III) was replaced with alanine, only one conducting state of the calcium channel was observed. The value of this conductance state is 124.7 ± 2.9 (n = 15) pS, similar to that of the wild type (112.4 ± 3.6, n = 7) (p > 0.022), and represents the high conductance, unprotonated state of the channel. This result is very surprising since it has been reported in a recent abstract (21Chen X.-H. Bezprovanny I. Tsien R.W. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: A78Google Scholar) that replacement of this glutamate residue with glutamine and similarly the same replacement in motif I, eliminates the high conductance state of the calcium channel. Our results, however, clearly demonstrate that the glutamate 1086 in motif III is the sole acceptor for extracellular protons in the tested pH range, and protonation at this site is responsible for the appearance of the low conductance state. Although, there is clearly only one glutamate residue (Glu-1086, in motif III) that is essential for protonation of the channel, replacement of others has minor but distinct and important effects on the conductance of the protonated and unprotonated channel (Fig. 2B). The behavior of the mutant in which the glutamate in motif II was replaced by alanine is of particular interest. The conductances of the protonated and unprotonated states are identical with the wild type suggesting that the motif II glutamate residue is not a target for protonation at the pH range tested and represents a minor energy barrier in the conducting pathway for monovalent ions. Replacement of the glutamate residue in motif I affects both the high and low conductance states. Since both conductances increase about 2-fold, this suggests that the glutamate residue in motif I plays an important role in controlling the permeation of the channel at least for monovalent cations. This finding also implies that mutation at this site weakens the interaction with monovalent ions and increases the conductance values by lowering an energy barrier, compared to the wild type. Replacement of the glutamate residue in motif IV by alanine results in a conductance of the unprotonated state that was only slightly increased after the mutation, compared to the wild type, while the conductance value of the protonated state was nearly doubled. This suggests that an energy barrier of the protonated channel influencing the permeation of K+ has been lowered. Titration of the wild type channel (Glu-1086) yielded a pKa value close to 8 (Fig. 1C). This value is very high compared to 4.3 which is the pKa value of a free glutamic acid side-chain carboxyl (22Matthew J.B. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1985; 14: 387-417Google Scholar). One explanation for this difference may reside in the local dielectric environment, which influences the intrinsic proton affinity of glutamate residues. It is known that in proteins the charge of a neighboring amino acid can alter the pKa value of glutamate and aspartate residues (22Matthew J.B. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1985; 14: 387-417Google Scholar). Most likely, the three other glutamate residues which form the selectivity filter can exert electrostatic effects on the carboxyl group of Glu-1086, thereby also changing its pKa value. In order to quantitate this effect, we compared the fractional times the channel spent in the protonated and unprotonated state at the fixed pH value of 8.0 for wild type and the three mutants (Fig. 2C). Assuming a similar one to one binding as for the wild type, the measured values would correspond to a pKa for the mutants E334A, E677A, and E1387A of 7.42, 7.33, and 7.65, respectively. These data clearly show that the electrostatic contribution of the three glutamates, upon titration of Glu-1086, are moderate at best. Therefore, other factors must be (primarily) responsible for the unusually high pKa value. Nevertheless, the finding that there is an effect of mutating these glutamate residues on the pKa value suggests that these carboxyl side chains must be located closer than 7 Å in relation to the side chain of Glu-1086, since at distances larger than 7 Å, the interaction energies between two charged sites are too small to perturb each other (22Matthew J.B. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1985; 14: 387-417Google Scholar). Divalent cations such as Ca2+ or Ba2+ exhibit much stronger interaction with their intrapore binding sites than monovalent cations, as quantitated by the ability of low concentrations of divalent ions to block the current flow carried by monovalent ions through the calcium channel (2Kim M.S. Morii T. Sun L. Imoto K. Mori Y. FEBS Lett. 1993; 318: 145-148Google Scholar, 4Yang J. Ellinor P.T. Sather W.A. Zhang J.F. Tsien R.W. Nature. 1993; 366: 158-161Google Scholar, 7Ellinor P.T. Yang J. Sather W.A. Zhang J.-F. Tsien R.W. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1121-1132Google Scholar, 23Varadi G. Mori Y. Mikala G. Schwartz A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 43-49Google Scholar). Therefore, we asked the question whether the effects observed with K+ as charge carrier could be verified with a divalent cation as charge carrier. It should be emphasized that with divalent cations the protonated and unprotonated conductance states cannot be resolved since they coalesce into a single intermediary value. There is a competition between protons and divalent cations, thus higher divalent concentrations coincide with decreased proton blockade (24Kuo C.-C. Hess P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1993; 466: 657-682Google Scholar, 25Klückner U. Isenberg G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 103: 665-678Google Scholar). For the wild type channel, using 10 mM Ba2+ as charge carrier, the conductance decreased by ~50%percnt; at ~pH 6.0 compared to maximal conductance (Fig. 3A). A similar decrease in conductance has been demonstrated in native cells (25Klückner U. Isenberg G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 103: 665-678Google Scholar). Using the point mutant E1086A, no effect was observed on the conductance upon altering the pH (Fig. 3B). Additionally, the conductance level was close to the wild type. Thus, pH modulation of channel conductance through the wild type channel as determined by Glu-1086 is independent of the charge carrier. In this study we demonstrate by analysis of the channel conductance states and by point mutations that there is only one glutamic acid side chain, among a number of candidates, that is predominantly protonated within the pH range of 6.0-9.0 thereby controlling ion permeation. This is the first study of a calcium channel pore that shows the influence of the microenvironment on forming the functional asymmetry of the conducting pathway. The unusually high pKa value of Glu-1086 does not arise exclusively from polar interactions, rather repulsive free energy interactions may contribute that exist between hydrophobic and carboxyl residues when placed sufficiently proximal to each other (26Urry D.W. Giowda D.C. Peng S.Q. Parker T.M. Harris R.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 8717-8719Google Scholar). Notably, residue Glu-1086 is preceded by a phenylalanine that is unique for motif III of this channel and has been shown to influence the calcium dependence of dihydropyridine binding (27Peterson B.Z. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18201-18204Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that since in motif III, in addition to the spatially nearby carboxylate residues, there is the unique placement of a phenylalanine proximal to a glutamate that may confer the unique functional features of Glu-1086."

In the human megakaryocytic cell line Dami, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) promoted a rapid increase in SH-PTP1 phosphorylation on both serine and tyrosine residues. Only tyrosine phosphorylation was significantly inhibited by pertussis toxin and by the protein kinase C inhibitor GF109203X. Moreover, SH-PTP1 was phosphorylated upon challenge with other agonists acting via G-protein-coupled receptors such as α-thrombin, epinephrine, and ADP, whereas the closely related protein-tyrosine phosphatase SH-PTP2 failed to share such a regulation in Dami cells. We developed an in vitro assay that reproduced LPA-dependent phosphorylation of SH-PTP1 in a cell-free system. The fusion protein glutathione S-transferase-β-adrenergic receptor kinase 1-(495-689) or the transducin subunit Gαt-GDP, which act as specific antagonists of Gβγ, inhibited SH-PTP1 phosphorylation. Moreover, purified transducin Gβγ subunits mimicked the effect of LPA. Finally, stable expression of β-adrenergic receptor kinase 1-(495-689) in Dami cells resulted in the inhibition of SH-PTP1 phosphorylation evoked by LPA.

However, both signaling cascades converge to ras, leading to the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (3Vouret-Craviari V. van Obberghen-Schilling E. Scimeca J.C. van Obberghen E.

In the case of receptors with protein-tyrosine kinase activity, it is clear that ras activation implies the formation of signaling complexes involving mainly Grb2-Sos (5Schlessinger J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 273-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Very recent reports have underlined the importance of G-protein βγ subunits in coupling a number of seven-transmembrane receptors to the ras pathway via an unidentified protein-tyrosine kinase phosphorylating Shc, which functions as an adaptor able to associate with Grb2-Sos (6Koch W.J.

Among various possibilities, protein-tyrosine phosphatases bearing SH2 (rc homology-2) domains should be considered as potential candidates. This subfamily of protein-tyrosine phosphatase comprises two members: SH-PTP1 (also referred to as PTP1C, HCP, SHP, or PTP-N6) is predominantly expressed in the hematopoietic lineage, which is severely disturbed in motheaten mice, characterized by major mutations of the corresponding gene (9Shen S.H.

In a way similar to that observed for protein-tyrosine kinase receptors, SH-PTP2 seems to positively regulate the mitogenic signals of thrombin (22Rivard N. McKenzie F.R. Brondello J.M. Pouysségur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11017-11024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In contrast, SH-PTP1 down-regulates various pathways including those evoked by insulin (23Uchida T. Matozaki T. Noguchi T. Yamao T. Horita K. Suzuki T. Fujioka Y. Sakamoto C. Kasuga M. J. Biol.

We previously reported that SH-PTP1 is rapidly phosphorylated in thrombin-stimulated platelets via a pertussis toxin-sensitive pathway preceding its translocation to the cytoskeleton (27Li R.Y. Gaits F. Ragab A. Ragab-Thomas J.M.F. Chap H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 343: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 28Li R.Y. Gaits F. Ragab A. Ragab-Thomas J.M.F. Chap H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2519-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). These data are at variance with those of Ezumi et al. (29Ezumi Y. Takayama H. Okuma M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11927-11934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), who proposed that tyrosine phosphorylation of SH-PTP1 requires its association with the cytoskeleton triggered by integrin αIIb/β3 engagement. However, SH-PTP1 is tyrosyl-phosphorylated in the megakaryocytic cell line Dami, where thrombin stimulation is not followed by activation of integrin αIIb/β3 or by cell aggregation (28Li R.Y. Gaits F. Ragab A. Ragab-Thomas J.M.F. Chap H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2519-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Dami cells thus appear to be a convenient model for dissecting early signaling events evoked by thrombin or other agonists sharing a similar mechanism. In this study, we used Dami cells challenged with LPA, a novel phospholipid mediator with various biological activities whose putative receptor is coupled to Gq and Gi (2Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12949-12952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). LPA is produced from activated platelets by a still undefined pathway (30Gerrard J.M. Robinson P.

J. 1993; 291: 677-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar), and we recently gave evidence for a possible involvement of secretory non-pancreatic phospholipase A2 in the generation of this messenger under inflammatory conditions (32Fourcade O. Simon M.F. Viodé C. Rugani N. Leballe F. Ragab A. Fournié B. Sarda L. Chap H. Cell. 1995; 80: 919-927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Besides identifying Dami cells as a new target of LPA, our study shows that G-protein βγ subunits are directly involved in early phosphorylation steps specifically affecting SH-PTP1. LPA (1-oleoyl), GTPγS, human α-thrombin, pertussis toxin, genistein, and phosphoamino acids were purchased from Sigma. Polyclonal antibody specific for SH-PTP1 and anti-SH-PTP2 monoclonal antibody were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. and Transduction Laboratories, respectively. Gαt and Gβγ subunits from bovine transducin were purified as reported elsewhere (33Bigay J. Faurobert O. Franco M. Chabre M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14081-14090Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Other reagents were previously described (28Li R.Y. Gaits F. Ragab A. Ragab-Thomas J.M.F. Chap H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2519-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The cDNA (from HL-60 cells) encoding the Gβγ subunit-binding region of the pleckstrin homology domain of human βARK1 (Gly495-Leu689) was amplified using the polymerase chain reaction product to construct a DNA cassette with engineered 5′- and 3′-ends containing a BamHI site and an SmaI site, respectively, for subcloning in various expression vectors. The first amplifiate was then inserted into the pBluescript SK vector, and its sequence was verified by dideoxy sequencing using T7 polymerase (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). For Escherichia coli expression of fusion proteins, the GST gene fusion vector pGEX-KG (a gift of Dr. J. E. Dixon, University of Michigan Medical School) was used to make a cDNA construct with the BamHI-EcoRI cassette of βARK1. This was introduced into E. coli strain XL1-blue and induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside. The fusion protein was purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose 4B, essentially as described by the manufacturer, using the Sarkosyl method (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Purified proteins were stored at −20°C in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing glutathione (10 mM) and glycerol (10%, v/v). The integrity of the fusion protein was checked by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining prior to use in the assays described below. Culture of Dami cells, 32P labeling, incubation with agonists followed by immunoprecipitation of SH-PTP1, detection by autoradiography after polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and phosphoamino acid analysis have been described elsewhere (28Li R.Y. Gaits F. Ragab A. Ragab-Thomas J.M.F. Chap H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2519-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 34Salles J.P. Gayral-Taminh M. Fauvel J. Delobbe I. Mignon-Conté M. Conté J.J. Chap H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12805-12811Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of SH-PTP2 was achieved with a specific monoclonal antibody (1 µg/ml) and with the addition of 50 µl of a mixture (v/v) of protein A- and protein G-Sepharose (10% suspension). A cDNA construct was made with the BamHI-SmaI cassette of βARK1 in the pET-3C vector (a gift of Dr. J. M. Darbon, INSERM, Contrat Jeune Formation 95-10, Toulouse, France) in order to express a tagged protein formed by a peptide derived from the S10 protein of the T7 phage (Met-Ala-Ser-Met-Thr-Gly-Gly-Gln-Gln-Met-Gly) in fusion with βARK1-(495-689). This construct was then subcloned in the eukaryotic expression vector pCI-Neo (Promega) after digestion with XbaI-SmaI enzymes to produce stably derived Dami cells that constitutively express the S10-βARK1 protein. This tagged protein of 28 kDa is detectable by immunoprecipitation with anti-T7 tag antibody (Novagen). Circularized plasmid DNA (20 µg) was electroporated into 107 Dami cells using a Gene Pulser II system (Bio-Rad) at 500 microfarads and 400 V. Neomycin-resistant cells were selected in complete medium with the antibiotic G418 (Sigma) at 800 µg/ml for 10 days, followed by 600 µg/ml for 5 days, and the resulting stable cell lines were maintained in 500 µg/ml G418 in complete medium. A control cell line, pCI, was generated by transfecting the pCI-Neo vector alone. Cellular expression of S10-βARK1 was documented following metabolic labeling with [35S]methionine. Transfected cells were incubated overnight at 1 × 106 cells/ml in 3 ml of methionine-free medium containing [35S]methionine (100 µCi/ml), lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, and clarified by centrifugation after sonication (3 × 15 s). Supernatants were incubated with anti-T7 tag antibody (1 µg) for 2 h, and immune complexes were collected on a mixture of protein A- and protein G-Sepharose (v/v) as described for SH-PTP1 and SH-PTP2 immunoprecipitations. Proteins were then resolved by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Dami cells previously incubated for 24 h without serum and in the presence of 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin were centrifuged (1000 × g for 5 min at 4°C) and resuspended at a concentration of 1 × 107 cells/ml in hypotonic lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 10 mM MgCl2, 50 µM adenosine triphosphate, 1 µg/ml leupeptin, 10 µg/ml aprotinin, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 mM Na3VO4). Cells were then disrupted by 40 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer on ice. Cell disruption (>95%) was confirmed by microscopic examination, and cells that remained intact were removed from the lysate by low speed centifugation (250 × g for 5 min at 4°C). The reaction medium consisted in 250 µl of this total cell lysate containing 10 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Reactions were started by the addition of LPA (1 µM), GTPγS (5 µM), or the βγ subunits of transducin (1-4 µM) and performed for 7 min at 30°C. Blocks of SH-PTP1 phosphorylation were performed under the same conditions after 10 min of preincubation on ice with the α-GDP inactive subunit of transducin (Gαt-GDP) (1-4 µM), the GST-βARK1 fusion protein (3 µM), or control GST (3 µM) prior to stimulation with 1 µM LPA. Reactions were stopped by the addition of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, and SH-PTP1 immunoprecipitation was achieved as described previously (28Li R.Y. Gaits F. Ragab A. Ragab-Thomas J.M.F. Chap H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2519-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). 32P-Labeled Dami cells were stimulated with LPA, and SH-PTP1 was immunoprecipitated. Autoradiography following gel electrophoresis revealed that SH-PTP1 was rapidly phosphorylated, i.e. in the first seconds following exposure to LPA, as observed for thrombin. The time course and dose-response experiments shown in Fig. 1 revealed that maximal phosphorylation was reached at 1 min of stimulation and at a concentration of 0.5 µM LPA. The increase in total phosphorylation was ∼2-4-fold as evaluated by scintillation counting of the radioactivity incorporated into SH-PTP1. In contrast to thrombin stimulation (28Li R.Y. Gaits F. Ragab A. Ragab-Thomas J.M.F. Chap H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2519-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), we failed to detect any change in protein-tyrosine phosphatase-specific activity of SH-PTP1 under these conditions (data not shown). Phosphoamino acid analysis showed that SH-PTP1 was phosphorylated to a similar extent on serine and tyrosine residues (Fig. 2C). Moreover, the increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of SH-PTP1 evoked by LPA was decreased by 80 and 100% upon preincubation of Dami cells with genistein and pertussis toxin, respectively (Fig. 2C). Whereas genistein was without effect on serine phosphorylation of SH-PTP1, the small decrease observed with pertussis toxin remained insignificant. These results indicate that LPA-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of SH-PTP1 is mediated by a Gi-dependent protein-tyrosine kinase. Since phorbol ester was previously shown to stimulate both serine and tyrosine phosphorylation of SH-PTP1 in platelets (28Li R.Y. Gaits F. Ragab A. Ragab-Thomas J.M.F. Chap H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2519-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), the effect of a specific protein kinase C inhibitor, GF109203X, was also checked in Dami cells challenged with LPA. As shown in Fig. 3, only the increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of SH-PTP1 evoked by LPA was inhibited by 68% at a GF109203X concentration (5 µM) previously shown to inhibit protein kinase C by 80-90% (28Li R.Y. Gaits F. Ragab A. Ragab-Thomas J.M.F. Chap H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2519-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This suggests that part of SH-PTP1 tyrosine phosphorylation involves a protein-tyrosine kinase acting downstream of protein kinase C. We then developed an in vitro phosphorylation assay in which a lysate derived from serum-deprived Dami cells was incubated with [γ-32P]ATP and LPA. As shown in Fig. 4A, this assay was sensitive enough to reproduce the phosphorylation of SH-PTP1 evoked by LPA in intact Dami cells. The addition of GTPγS (5 µM) was also able to induce SH-PTP1 phosphorylation, and the increase in 32P radioactivity in SH-PTP1 was ∼2-3-fold, i.e. the same as in intact cells. It has previously been shown that the C-terminal pleckstrin homology domain of βARK1 specifically antagonizes several events occurring downstream of G-protein-coupled receptors by sequestering free Gβγ subunits (35Pitcher J.A. Inglese J. Higgins J.B. Arriza J.L. Casey P.J. Kim C. Benivic J.L. Kwatra M.M. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1992; 257: 1264-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 36Inglese J.

A. 1994; 91: 3633-3636Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). So, we prepared a recombinant protein encoding the Gβγ-binding domain of βARK1 in fusion with GST. Fig. 4B shows that a 10-min preincubation with GST-βARK1 limited to ∼50% the increase in SH-PTP1 phosphorylation evoked by LPA, whereas GST alone was without effect. On the other hand, the addition of exogenous Gβγ or inactive Gαt-GDP purified from transducin stimulated or suppressed SH-PTP1 phosphorylation, respectively. Fig. 4C indicates that the stimulation and inhibition observed with the G subunits was dose-dependent with a half-maximal concentration of ∼2 µM for Gβγ and Gαt. At 4 µM Gβγ, phosphoamino acid analysis showed that both serine and tyrosine residues were labeled. Further proof for a direct involvement of Gβγ in the phosphorylation of SH-PTP1 evoked by LPA was obtained in intact Dami cells transfected with a cDNA coding for S10-βARK1. As shown in Fig. 5 (B and C), the increase in SH-PTP1 phosphorylation evoked by LPA was inhibited by 54% in cells expressing S10-βARK1, which was detected upon immunoprecipitation after [35S]methionine labeling (Fig. 5A). Phosphoamino acid analysis indicated that both tyrosine and serine phosphorylation was inhibited by S10-βARK1 (data not shown). So, in vitro and in vivo experiments strongly indicate that the G-protein-dependent LPA-activated kinases that phosphorylate SH-PTP1 in Dami cells are dependent on Gβγ. To determine whether SH-PTP1 phosphorylation could be evoked by other G-protein-coupled receptors, Dami cells were stimulated with thrombin, epinephrine, and ADP. Fig. 6A shows that SH-PTP1 was phosphorylated with all the tested agonists. Under the same conditions, SH-PTP2 phosphorylation was never detected (Fig. 6B). This study was devoted to the elucidation of early phosphorylation steps occurring downstream of G-protein-coupled receptors, which still remains a puzzling challenge of cell signaling. We took advantage of the fact that Dami cells respond to LPA, a novel phospholipid mediator acting via a putative seven-transmembrane receptor coupled to both Gi and Gq (2Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12949-12952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Extending a previous study using α-thrombin (28Li R.Y. Gaits F. Ragab A. Ragab-Thomas J.M.F. Chap H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2519-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), we found that LPA promotes the phosphorylation of SH-PTP1 on both serine and tyrosine residues. However, only tyrosine phosphorylation of SH-PTP1 evoked by LPA was sensitive to pertussis toxin, suggesting that Gi is involved in the coupling between the LPA receptor and SH-PTP1. Moreover, using various approaches, we were able to show that Gβγ subunits are closely implicated in the stimulation of SH-PTP1 phosphorylation. Finally, SH-PTP2, which is very homologous in structure and activity to SH-PTP1, was not phosphorylated under the same conditions. SH-PTP1 phosphorylation thus appears to be a specific and crucial step in the signaling cascades evoked by agonists acting on G-protein-coupled receptors in Dami cells and platelets. In Rat-1 fibroblasts, activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade involving p21ras has been shown to be mediated by Gβγ after LPA stimulation (4Hordijk P.L. Verlaan L. van Corven E.J. Moolenaar W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 645-651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Koch W.J. Inglese J. Stone W.C. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8256-8260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In Dami cells, mitogen-activated protein kinase is phosphorylated in a pertussis toxin-sensitive way after LPA stimulation. 2F. Gaits, R. Y. Li, J. Bigay, A. Ragab, J. M. F. Ragab-Thomas, and H. Chap, unpublished observations. This suggests that SH-PTP1 could be involved in a positive signal between Gβγ and ras, possibly involving activation of a src-like kinase by dephosphorylation. Indeed, activation of pp60c-src and pp59c-fyn indicated a pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein acting downstream of the thrombin receptor (39Chen Y. Pouysségur J. Courtneidge S. van Obberghen-Schilling H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27372-27377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, a positive effect of overexpressed SH-PTP1 on mitogen-activated signaling was recently reported (40Su L. Zhao Z. Bouchard P. Banville D. Fischer E.H. Krebs E.G. Shen S.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10385-10390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Alternatively, SH-PTP1 could act as a negative signal transducer turned on in parallel to positive signals by G-protein-coupled receptors. This has indeed been shown in other instances (23Uchida T. Matozaki T. Noguchi T. Yamao T. Horita K. Suzuki T. Fujioka Y. Sakamoto C. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12220-12228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Yi T. Mui A.L.-F. Krystal G.

Cell. 1995; 80: 729-738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). The situation is complex if we consider that SH-PTP1 and SH-PTP2 are in vitro and in vivo substrates of mitogen-activated protein kinase (22Rivard N. McKenzie F.R. Brondello J.M. Pouysségur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11017-11024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 41Peraldi P. Zhao Z. Filloux C. Fisher E.H. van Obberghen E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5002-5006Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Whether serine phosphorylation of SH-PTP1 evoked by LPA also implies mitogen-activated protein kinase cannot be established from our present data. However, protein kinase C is probably not directly involved, as indicated by the failure of GF109203X to inhibit serine phosphorylation of SH-PTP1. But we cannot exclude the presence of a protein kinase C isoform insensitive to this inhibitor. If we focus on SH-PTP1 tyrosine phosphorylation, the kinase possibly activated by Gβγ might belong to the family of protein-tyrosine kinases containing a pleckstrin homology domain, i.e. the Tec kinase family. It has been shown that several of these enzymes are able to associate with Gβγ through their pleckstrin homology domain, which results in the activation of protein-tyrosine kinase activity, as recently shown in vitro for Btk and Tsk kinases (42Tsukada S. Simon M.I. Witte O.N. Katz A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11256-11260Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 43Langhans-Rajasekaran S.A. Wan Y. Huang X.-Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8601-8605Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Also, the fact that some tyrosine phosphorylation occurs downstream of protein kinase C again suggests the possible involvement of Tec kinases, which were recently shown to interact with protein kinase C (44Yao L. Kawakami Y. Kawakami T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9175-9179Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 45Kawakami Y. Yao L. Tashiro M. Gibson S. Mills G.B. Kawakami T. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 3556-3562PubMed Google Scholar). Future studies should try to identify in Dami cells one or several members of this protein-tyrosine kinase family. Finally, the effect of SH-PTP1 phosphorylation on its activity still remains unclear. In slight contrast with our previous report (28Li R.Y. Gaits F. Ragab A. Ragab-Thomas J.M.F. Chap H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2519-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), where we observed a modest increase in SH-PTP1 activity in thrombin-stimulated platelets, LPA-induced phosphorylation was not accompanied by a modification of the catalytic efficiency of SH-PTP1. This might simply reflect the difficulty of determining SH-PTP1 activity in vitro because of its ability to autodephosphorylate and to inactivate itself (27Li R.Y. Gaits F. Ragab A. Ragab-Thomas J.M.F. Chap H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 343: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Anyway, it is not certain that a 60% increase in SH-PTP1 activity would significantly affect rapid signaling events evoked by seven-transmembrane receptors. Rather, we suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of SH-PTP1 might allow its relocalization in the cell, possibly upon binding to an SH2 or a phosphotyrosine-binding domain of another signaling protein, which still remains to be identified. Indeed, a specific association between SH-PTP1 and pp60c-src was recently reported (46Falet H. Ramos-Morales F. Bachelot C. Fischer S. Rendu F. FEBS Lett. 1996; 383: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In conclusion, we have shown for the first time that a protein-tyrosine phosphatase with SH2 domains is implicated in the Gβγ-mediated signaling pathway induced by LPA. Moreover, this coupling is really specific for SH-PTP1, and it occurs after stimulation of other G-protein-coupled receptors, thus raising the hypothesis that this protein-tyrosine phosphatase could be an important element of the cellular activation cascade.

In vivo, the conversion of protein C (PC) from its zymogen to activated form is mediated primarily by thrombin bound to thrombomodulin (TM), an endothelial cell surface protein. Molecular modeling suggests residues Lys37-Lys38-Lys39 of protein C's serine protease domain reside in a surface-exposed loop (variable region 1) whose high concentration of positive charge might be involved in protein-protein interactions. In this study, we have examined the role of the conserved tribasic Lys37-39 charge center in human protein C activation. This sequence was changed to acidic by substitution with Asp37-Glu38-Asp39 (DED) and Glu37-Glu38-Glu39 (EEE), or to neutrality by substitution with Gly37-Gly38-Gly39 (GGG). These mutant PCs, expressed and purified from recombinant human 293 cells, appeared normal with regard to intracellular processing, ability to be secreted, and formation of a viable active site for tripeptidyl-p-nitroanilide substrate cleavage. For activation by free thrombin, wild-type (wt) and mutant PCs displayed equivalent activation rates, as well as identical calcium-dependent inhibition of such activation. Activation of wt-PC with a soluble TM-thrombin complex yielded a 2,000-fold faster rate compared with that by free thrombin at the same (physiological) calcium level. In contrast, the acidic mutants DED and EEE exhibited virtually no TM-mediated increase in activation rate, while the neutral mutant GGG was somewhat intermediate with a 30-fold stimulation of activation rate. These reductions in activation rate were independent of the presence of chondroitin sulfate on TM. Our observations represent the first identification of residues whose mutation essentially uncouples activation by the TM-thrombin complex without affecting activation by free thrombin. Further, our results suggest that VR1 residues within the zymogen form of a serine protease can be important for recognition by physiological activators.

A key regulator of the coagulation process is activated protein C (aPC), 1The abbreviations used are: aPCactivated human protein CBSAbovine serum albuminCSchondroitin sulfateGlaγ-carboxyglutamateHPC or PChuman protein C zymogenPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresispNAp-nitroanilidesTMrecombinant soluble thrombomodulinTMthrombomodulinVR1variable region 1wtwild type. which exerts its effects by proteolytically inactivating two cofactors involved in the clotting cascade, factors Va and VIIIa (1Kisiel W.

The physiological importance of aPC is shown by the thrombophilia associated with deficiencies in protein C, deficiencies in its cofactor (protein S), or mutations in its substrate (factor V Leiden) which make it resistant to cleavage by aPC (reviewed in Ref. 3Dahlbäck B.

Protein C circulates as an inactive zymogen whose conversion to its activated form is mediated by thrombin complexed to the endothelial cell membrane protein, thrombomodulin (TM). At physiological calcium levels, protein C is a poor substrate for activation by free thrombin, in part, because of a calcium-induced conformational change in PC. Rezaie et al. (4Rezaie A.R. Mather T. Sussman F. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3151-3154Google Scholar) have recently identified human protein C's calcium-binding region as being comprised of protease domain residues Glu70 through Glu80. Binding of calcium to this surface loop alters protein C structure such that acidic P3 and P3′ residues surrounding the cleavage site make unfavorable contacts with thrombin's substrate-binding region. When thrombin binds to TM, its active site undergoes a “compensating” conformational change which reduces the inhibitory influence of protein C's acidic P3/P3′ residues (5Ehrlich H.J. Grinnell B.W. Jaskunas S.R. Esmon C.T. Yan S.B. Bang N.U. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2367-2373Google Scholar, 6LeBonniec B.F. MacGillivray R.T.A. Esmon C.T. J. Biol.

Haemostasis. 1993; 70: 29-35Google Scholar, 9Richardson M.A. Gerlitz B. Grinnell B.W. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 711-712Google Scholar). While the TM-induced changes in thrombin's active site and the negative influence of these acidic P3/P3′ residues are clearly important, they do not appear to completely account for the dramatic increase in protein C activation compared to that by free thrombin. Even under optimal conditions, for protein C activation by free thrombin (i.e. in the absence of calcium), the activation rate is still approximately 2 orders of magnitude slower than the activation rate by the TM-thrombin complex at physiological calcium levels. Alignment of the amino acid sequences for the protease domains of numerous serine proteases serves to identify highly conserved and nonconserved regions (see Fig. 1). The conserved regions likely provide for a common structural framework, while nonconserved or “variable” residues impart properties unique to each molecule. In this study, we have focused on sequences in a region of the protease domain of protein C corresponding to variable region 1 (VR1) of the serine proteases. Interestingly, in the linear sequence of human protein C, VR1 is located between the activation peptide/cleavage site and the calcium-binding loop, two regions known to be involved in activation. The most striking feature of VR1 in protein C is the cluster of positively charged lysine residues (protease domain residues Lys37-Lys38-Lys39). 2Amino acid designations utilize chymotrypsinogen numbering of protease domain residues. The Lys37-39 charge center (chymotrypsinogen numbering) corresponds to Lys191-193 based on the mature N terminus of protein C (following removal of the signal sequence and propeptide). Molecular modeling of PC by several groups (13Toma K. Suzuki K. J. Mol. Graphics. 1989; 7: 146-149Google Scholar, 14Fisher C.L. Greengard J.S. Griffin J.H. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 588-599Google Scholar, 15Cooper S.T. Whinna H.C. Jackson T.P. Boyd J.M. Church F.C. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12991-12997Google Scholar) has suggested that Lys37-39 reside in a surface-exposed loop whose high concentration of positive charge is likely involved in protein-protein interactions. Therefore, we have analyzed what role the conserved tribasic Lys37-39 charge center might play in PC activation. Although our results suggest that these basic residues are not involved in protein C activation by free thrombin, nor in the inhibition of such activation by calcium-induced conformational changes near the cleavage site, it does appear that the Lys37-39 charge center is integral to structural features recognized by the TM-thrombin complex. Recombinant soluble human thrombomodulin (TMD1, CS+, and CS-) was prepared essentially as described previously (16Parkinson J.F. Grinnell B.W. Moore R.E. Hoskins J. Vlahos C.J. Bang N.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12602-12610Google Scholar). Thrombin-Sepharose 4B was provided by Josephine Secnik of Eli Lilly & Co. All other chemicals used were of the highest purity commercially available. Oligonucleotide primers had the following sequences: Pm-DED, 5′-CACTGCCCCGCAGGCCAGATCTTCATCTGAGTCCAGCAGGACCAC-3′; Pm-EEE, 5′-CACTGCCCCGCAGGCCAGCTCTTCCTCTGAGTCTAGAAGGACCACCTGCCAGGGG-3′; Pm-GGG, 5′-GAGCACTGCCCCGCAGGCTAGGCCTCCTCCTGAGTCCAGCAGGACCAC-3′. These primers incorporated silent mutations for restriction endonuclease screening prior to actual DNA sequencing. Introduced restriction sites were BglII (DED), XbaI (EEE), and StuI (GGG). Mutagenesis, insertion of the mutated cDNA into the expression vector pGT-hyg, isolation of stable recombinant mammalian cell lines, and protein C purification were all performed essentially as described previously (17Grinnell B.W. Walls J.D. Gerlitz B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9778-9785Google Scholar). Purified protein was desalted/concentrated in Ultrafree-CL 30,000 NMWL filtration units using Buffer A (150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) and then quantitated by Pierce BCA assay with BSA as a standard. Thrombin-Sepharose 4B was washed extensively with Buffer A, and then 300 µg of HPC in 1 ml of the same buffer was incubated with 200 µl of packed thrombin-Sepharose 4B for 4 h at 37°C on a rotating platform. During the course of this incubation, the degree of HPC activation was monitored by briefly pelleting the thrombin-Sepharose 4B and assaying an aliquot of the supernatant for aPC amidolytic activity using the chromogenic substrate S-2366. Following complete activation, the thrombin-Sepharose 4B was pelleted, the supernatant was collected, its protein concentration was verified by Pierce BCA assay, and aPC either was assayed directly or frozen in aliquots at -80°C. The zymogen and activated forms of protein C were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (18Yan S.C.B. Razzano P. Chao Y.B. Walls J.D. Berg D.T. McClure D.B. Grinnell B.W. Bio/Technology. 1990; 8: 655-661Google Scholar). Reaction conditions were as described in Fig. 3 and Table I. Aliquots were removed at selected times and added to a 40-fold excess of hirudin (serving both to halt the activation reaction as well as quench background chromogenic activity arising from thrombin), then amidolytic activity and aPC generation were determined as described below.TABLE I.Activation rates of zymogen PCs by thrombin or the TM-thrombin complexActivation rate (mmol.·min-1·mol-1)Thrombin (0 mM CaCl2)aThrombin at 10 nM.Thrombin (3.0 mM CaCl2)bThrombin at 20 nM.ThrombinTMD1 [CS+] (3.0 mM CaCl2)cThrombin at 0.5 nM with 25 nM recombinant CS-modified soluble TM (Kd for thrombin = 2 nM).Thrombin TMD1 [CS-] (3.0 mM CaCl2)dThrombin at 0.5 nM with 250 nM recombinant CS-free soluble TM (Kd for thrombin = 23 nM).Thrombin TMD1 [CS-] (0.3 mM CaCl2)dThrombin at 0.5 nM with 250 nM recombinant CS-free soluble TM (Kd for thrombin = 23 nM).wt-HPC96 ± 71.7 ± 0.24,000 ± 2005,000 ± 30014,200 ± 1,300DED101 ± 42.3 ± 0.12.0 ± 0.42.7 ± 0.37.5 ± 0.6EEE108 ± 41.9 ± 0.11.4 ± 0.22.3 ± 0.36.5 ± 0.3GGG111 ± 52.2 ± 0.167 ± 5101 ± 7250 ± 20a Thrombin at 10 nM.b Thrombin at 20 nM.c Thrombin at 0.5 nM with 25 nM recombinant CS-modified soluble TM (Kd for thrombin = 2 nM).d Thrombin at 0.5 nM with 250 nM recombinant CS-free soluble TM (Kd for thrombin = 23 nM). Open table in a new tab The amidolytic activity of the recombinant aPCs was determined by hydrolysis of the tripeptide substrate Glu-Pro-Arg-p-nitroanilide (S-2366). Reactions were performed at 25°C in Buffer A containing 1 mg/ml BSA, 3.0 to 3.5 mM CaCl2, and an initial concentration of 500 µM S-2366 chromogenic substrate. Assays were performed in a 96-well microtiter plate and amidolytic activity was measured as the change in absorbance units/min at 405 nm as monitored in a ThermoMax kinetic microtiter plate reader (Molecular Devices). Amounts of aPC formed were determined by comparison with standard curves generated using fully activated material. All data points were limited to cleavage of 15%percnt; or less of the chromogenic substrate. For determination of the kinetics of tripeptidyl-pNA substrate hydrolysis, reactions were performed at 25°C with 0.5 nM aPC in Buffer A containing 1 mg/ml BSA, 3.0 mM CaCl2, and varying initial concentrations of chromogenic substrate (S-2366, S-2288, S-2238, S-2302, or S-2266). Reactions (200 µl/well) were carried out in a 96-well microtiter plate, and optical density at 405 nm was monitored as above. Kinetic constants were derived according to the Eadie-Hofstee Transformation (Molecular Devices Technical Applications Bulletin 008-A) using a path length of 0.53 cm (Molecular Devices Technical Applications Bulletin 4-1) and an extinction coefficient for pNA at 405 nm of 9620 M-1 cm-1 (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). Using site-directed mutagenesis, we changed the cluster of positively charged lysine residues (Lys37-39) in VR1 of human protein C's protease domain to negatively charged amino acids by substitution with Asp37-Glu38-Asp39 (DED) and Glu37-Glu38-Glu39 (EEE) or to neutrality by substitution with Gly37-Gly38-Gly39 (GGG). Each of the derivatives was expressed and isolated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” We observed no significant effect of the Lys37-39 mutations on the secretion or processing of the protein from the 293 cell line. Purification of PCs by the pseudoaffinity method of Yan et al. (20Pfleiderer G. Methods Enzymol. 1970; 19: 514-521Google Scholar), which selects for completely γ-carboxylated material, resulted in equivalent recoveries (~90%percnt;) for wild-type and mutant PCs. SDS-PAGE analysis of zymogen and completely activated forms of each molecule (Fig. 2) shows similar patterns for the light and heavy chains, with all molecules exhibiting the typical α, β, and γ-glycoforms of the heavy chain. Likewise, there was no apparent effect of these mutations on the removal of the Lys-Arg dipeptide (which separates the light and heavy chains of PC) as there was little single chain material present in any of the zymogen molecules. In addition, activation of each molecule by thrombin was accompanied by a typical shift in mobility of the heavy chain glycoforms, indicative of activation peptide cleavage. Kinetic analyses of amidolytic activities toward several different tripeptidyl-pNA substrates (described under “Experimental Procedures”) indicated similar activities for mutant and wild-type aPCs: Km, Kcat, and Kcat/Km values for mutant aPCs were all within 20%percnt; of the values for wt-aPC with each particular substrate (data not shown). Altogether, these observations would support the conclusion that the amino acid substitutions in the mutant PCs do not result in global conformational changes. Indeed, this would be expected based on sequence alignments such as that in Fig. 1 which indicates that serine proteases can accommodate a wide variety of residues in this “variable” surface loop. In molecular models of PC, the VR1 loop containing the Lys37-39 charge center is in reasonably close proximity to a calcium-binding loop (protease domain residues Glu70-Glu80) previously shown to be important for PC activation (4Rezaie A.R.

The ligation of calcium by this surface loop results in a conformational change in PC which inhibits activation by free thrombin while favoring TM-thrombin activation. Thus, if alteration of the Lys37-39 charge center was to affect calcium-binding per se, one might expect to see changes in the calcium dependences for activation by both free and TM-bound thrombin. For activation with free thrombin (Fig. 3A), wild-type and mutant PCs displayed identical calcium inhibition profiles, with a half-maximal activation rate at approximately 0.13 mM CaCl2. These results suggest that there is no local disruption of PC's ability to bind calcium, nor in the resulting conformational changes previously shown to be inhibitory for activation by free thrombin. We next examined the calcium dependence for activation by the TM-thrombin complex (Fig. 3B) using chondroitin sulfate-modified (CS-modified) recombinant soluble human thrombomodulin (sTM). Limited activation by the sTM-thrombin complex was achieved in the absence of calcium, whereas activation rates increased with increasing calcium, finally plateauing as the calcium concentration reached physiological levels. In striking contrast, the Lys37-39 mutants all displayed poor activation by the CS-modified sTM-thrombin complex, regardless of calcium concentration. For the neutral substitution mutant (GGG), a stimulation of activation by the sTM-thrombin complex was noted with increasing calcium concentrations; however, the maximal rate reached a plateau value far below that of the wt-HPC activation rate. Thus, the alterations in the VR1 of protein C either eliminated or substantially reduced activation by the TM-thrombin complex, without altering activation by free thrombin. The results of a more detailed examination of activation rates are summarized in Table I. For activation by free thrombin, wild-type and mutant PCs were activated at virtually identical rates, both in the absence and presence of calcium. For activation of wt-HPC at near-physiological calcium levels of calcium (3 mM), the degree of stimulation by CS-modified sTM over the free thrombin activation rate was approximately 2,000-fold. As suggested in the calcium dependence experiments, the acidic substitution mutants (DED and EEE) showed virtually no sTM-mediated stimulation at 3 mM calcium compared to their activation rates obtained with free thrombin at the same calcium level. The neutral GGG substitution mutant displayed somewhat intermediate properties, exhibiting an approximately 30-fold stimulation of activation with CS-modified sTM. Therefore, charge reversal of the basic Lys37-39 center in VR1 resulted in the virtual elimination of TM stimulation, whereas neutralization of the basic charge center resulted in a PC molecule that still retained some form of productive interaction with the TM-thrombin complex (albeit substantially reduced). Molecular modeling studies (14Fisher C.L. Greengard J.S. Griffin J.H. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 588-599Google Scholar, 15Cooper S.T. Whinna H.C. Jackson T.P. Boyd J.M. Church F.C. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12991-12997Google Scholar) and experimental observations in our laboratory 3B. Gerlitz, S. T. Cooper, F. C. Church, and B. W. Grinnell, unpublished observation. have suggested that the basic Lys37-39 charge center in PC might contribute to interactions with negatively charged glycosaminoglycans. Therefore, we examined whether the reductions in TM-thrombin activation were dependent on the presence of chondroitin sulfate on TM. Calcium dependence experiments employing CS-free sTM displayed similar reductions in TM stimulation as was shown in Fig. 3B with CS-modified sTM (data not shown). As shown in Table I, for wild-type and mutant PCs, there was little difference in activation rates at 3 mM calcium when using either CS-modified or CS-free sTM. Thus, it appears that the Lys37-39 charge center is not involved in interactions with the CS moiety of TM. We also determined activation rates with CS-free sTM at 0.3 mM calcium, conditions which result in an approximately 3-fold higher activation rate (compared with that of the chondroitin-free sTM-thrombin complex at 3 mM calcium). This increased activation rate has previously been shown to be mediated by the Gla domain of protein C and the unoccupied anion-binding exosite 2 of thrombin (21Liu L.-W. Rezaie A.R. Carson C.W. Esmon N.L. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11807-11812Google Scholar). Although all substitutions of the Lys37-39 charge center either reduced or eliminated sTM-dependent stimulation of activation, activation of wild-type and mutant PCs with the CS-free sTM-thrombin complex at 0.3 mM calcium resulted in an approximately 3-fold higher activation rate compared with that at 3.0 mM calcium (Table I). Thus, the changes in VR1 had no effect on the Gla domain-mediated stimulation of activation rate at low calcium. The major finding of this study is that mutation of the Lys37-39 charge center in VR1 of PC's protease domain substantially reduces activation by the TM-thrombin complex, without affecting activation by free thrombin. Thus, it appears this basic charge center is integral to structural features in protein C that are recognized by the TM-thrombin complex but not used by free thrombin. The simplest mechanistic explanation for our results would be that the basic Lys37-39 charge center contributes directly to interaction the TM-thrombin complex via electrostatic attraction. Alternatively, the Lys37-39 charge center might be involved in the correct presentation of some other structural element in PC or a conformational change in PC induced by TM. Regardless of the exact mechanism, it is clear that the Lys37-39 charge center of protein C is critical for efficient recognition by the TM-thrombin complex. The strict interspecies sequence conservation for these VR1 amino acids in PC, which reside in a region of considerable diversity among different proteases, would also seem to support an important functional role. Although several studies have demonstrated a role for protease domain VR1 residues as they occur in the context of activated serine proteases (22Madison E.L. Goldsmith E.J. Gerard R.D.

Glycogen phosphorylase catalyzes the phosphorolysis of glycogen to produce glucose 1-phosphate. The enzyme from muscle is activated by AMP and by phosphorylation at its N terminus and is inhibited by a variety of allosteric effectors that include glucose, glucose 6-phosphate, ATP, and purines (11Cori C.F.

The active form of the enzyme is a dimer composed of two identical subunits, each of which contains an active site and five effector sites (7Johnson L.N. Hajdu J. Acharya K.R. Stuart D.I.

Fletterick R.J. Madsen N.B. Johnson L.N. Nature. 1988; 336: 215-221Google Scholar). The inhibitors, glucose 6-phosphate and ATP, compete with AMP for binding to the activation site (14Morgan H.E.

Withers S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1449-1455Google Scholar). The active site resides within the subunit in a crevice between the N- and C-terminal domains (7Johnson L.N. Hajdu J. Acharya K.R.

Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 2036-2048Google Scholar). Crystallographic studies have characterized a spectrum of conformational changes associated with phosphorylation of the enzyme and ligand binding, and have led to much speculation concerning the structural basis for the allosteric transition (23Sprang S.R.

The 280's loop (residues 280-288), which lies between β-strand 11 and α-helix 8, is thought, in particular, to play a key role in the control of substrate and inhibitor binding (30Sprang S. Fletterick R. Stern M. Yang D. Madsen N. Sturtevant J. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 2036-2048Google Scholar, 33Barford D. Johnson L.N. Nature. 1989; 340: 609-616Google Scholar, 35Withers S.G. Madsen N.B.

Johnson L.N. Withers S.G. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10745-10757Google Scholar). In structures of the enzyme in an inhibited state, the 280's loop forms contacts with residues of the N- and C-terminal domains and blocks access to the catalytic cleft. Glucose and purine inhibitors form synergistic binding interactions with different residues of the 280's loop and mediate intra- and interdomain contacts, which are presumed to stabilize the inactive conformation of the loop (23Sprang S.R.

Withers S.G. Madsen N.B. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 5364-5371Google Scholar). In structures of the enzyme in activated complexes with substrates or substrate analogues bound at the active site, the loop is disordered (33Barford D. Johnson L.N. Nature. 1989; 340: 609-616Google Scholar, 35Withers S.G. Madsen N.B. Sprang S.R. Fletterick R.J. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 5372-5382Google Scholar, 36Goldsmith E.J. Sprang S.R. Hamlin R. Xuong N.H. Fletterick R.J. Science. 1989; 245: 528-532Google Scholar). Movement of the loop during activation is accompanied by rotation of the N- and C-domains apart by 5°. This reorientation of the 280's loop and the opening of the catalytic cleft are thought to be required during the allosteric transition to allow phosphate and oligosaccharide to bind at the active site. For this reason, the 280's loop is referred to as the active site gate. Residues Asp-283, Asn-284, and Phe-285 form the apex of the gate and are thought to perform distinct functions in the allosteric response. Asp-283, a universally conserved residue in phosphorylases from prokaryotic and eukaryotic species (39Hudson J.W. Golding G.B. Crerar M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 700-721Google Scholar, 40Hudson J.W. Hefferon K.L. Crerar M.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1164: 197-208Google Scholar), behaves as a substrate mimic in the inactive state. Its carboxylate side chain occupies the active site in approximately the same position where phosphate binds when the enzyme is in an active conformation, and there it electrostatically and sterically interferes with substrate binding (33Barford D. Johnson L.N. Nature. 1989; 340: 609-616Google Scholar, 36Goldsmith E.J. Sprang S.R. Hamlin R. Xuong N.H. Fletterick R.J. Science. 1989; 245: 528-532Google Scholar). Residues Asn-284 and Phe-285, although not universally conserved, are found in all mammalian isozymes to participate in binding of inhibitors (30Sprang S. Fletterick R. Stern M. Yang D. Madsen N. Sturtevant J. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 2036-2048Google Scholar, 37Martin J.L. Johnson L.N. Withers S.G. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10745-10757Google Scholar, 38Sprang S.R. Goldsmith E.J. Fletterick R.J.

Crerar M.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1164: 197-208Google Scholar). Crystallographic studies show that a hydrogen bond is formed between the C2 hydroxyl group of glucose and the Asn-284 side chain (38Sprang S.R. Goldsmith E.J. Fletterick R.J. Withers S.G. Madsen N.B. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 5364-5371Google Scholar). The aromatic ring of Phe-285 forms aromatic stacking interactions with purine inhibitors (30Sprang S. Fletterick R. Stern M. Yang D. Madsen N. Sturtevant J. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 2036-2048Google Scholar). Asn-284 in addition contributes to the role of the loop as a gate by interfering sterically with substrate binding when the loop adopts its closed conformation. In the present study site-directed mutagenesis was used to test the role of the active site gate in allosteric regulation. Substitutions were made in residues Asp-283, Asn-284, and Phe-285 of the gate to perturb interactions thought to be important for allosteric inhibition and the stabilization of the inactive form of the enzyme. Kinetic analysis of the mutants shows the importance of gate residues for controlling the binding of substrates and inhibitors and suggests that proper positioning of the loop is necessary to achieve full allosteric activation. Oyster glycogen type II was purchased from Sigma. Escherichia coli strain 25A6 was supplied by Genentech Inc. (South San Francisco, CA). E. coli strain NB42 was obtained from Dr. David Morgan at U.C.S.F. Enzyme variants of phosphorylase were made using the cDNA of rabbit muscle phosphorylase, cloned into the E. coli plasmid, pHSe5 (41Browner M.F. Rasor P. Tugendreich S. Fletterick R.J. Protein Eng. 1991; 4: 351-357Google Scholar). The procedure of Kunkel (53Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Google Scholar) with some modifications as described by Browner et al. (41Browner M.F. Rasor P. Tugendreich S. Fletterick R.J. Protein Eng. 1991; 4: 351-357Google Scholar) was used for oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. The following substitutions were made: alanine and asparagine at Asp-283, alanine and aspartate at Asn-284, and leucine at Phe-285. An Applied Biosystems PCRmate synthesizer was used for synthesis of the oligonucleotides needed for site-directed mutagenesis and DNA sequencing. Oligonucleotides were 27 to 38 bases in length and contained base substitutions for introduction of mutation sites as well as restriction sites neighboring the mutation sites to allow screening the DNA by restriction digests. Restriction sites were introduced using conservative base substitutions that did not alter the amino acid sequence of the protein. The mutant constructs were sequenced at the mutation sites and in the regions extending 300 base pairs on either side of the mutations to confirm the presence of correct substitutions. Most of the mutant constructs could be expressed in cultures of E. coli strain 25A6 (W3110; tonA, lonΔ, qalE, htpPts). Cultures were grown at 22°C under conditions described previously for expression of the wild-type enzyme (41Browner M.F. Rasor P. Tugendreich S. Fletterick R.J. Protein Eng. 1991; 4: 351-357Google Scholar). From 1-liter cultures of E. coli, 1-10 mg of the enzyme variants were generally obtained. The N284A mutant was an exception and could not be expressed in the 25A6 strain. It was expressed more successfully in the lon-, E. coli strain, NB42, at a level of about 2 mg of protein per 1 liter of culture. Mutants were purified by chromatography on fast-flow metal chelating-Sepharose and fast-flow DEAE-Sepharose as described previously (42Luong C.B. Browner M.F. Fletterick R.J. Haymore B.L. J. Chromatogr. 1992; 584: 77-84Google Scholar). The mutants were better than 95%percnt; pure as judged from SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels stained with Coomassie Blue. Enzyme variants were stored in 25 mM β-glycerophosphate, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 50%percnt; glycerol at -20°C. In preparation for kinetic assays, enzyme variants were desalted by chromatography on Sephadex G-25. Protein concentrations were determined from absorbance measurements at 280 nm using the extinction coefficient for the wild-type enzyme of 1.32 cm2/mg (43Buc M.H. Ullmann A. Goldberg M. Buc H. Biochimie (Paris). 1971; 53: 283-289Google Scholar). Glycogen was purified to remove contaminating phosphate for use in kinetic assays as described previously (10Buchbinder J.L. Guinovart J.J. Fletterick R.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6423-6432Google Scholar). Initial velocities were determined by measuring the phosphate produced from the reaction of glucose 1-phosphate and glycogen (44Carney I.T. Beynon R.J. Kay J. Birket N. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 85: 321-324Google Scholar). The reaction mixtures contained 50 mM BES, 1The abbreviation used is: BES2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]ethanesulfonic acid. pH 6.8, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM, 1%percnt; glycogen in a final volume of 0.5 ml. Assays were performed at 30°C. The enzyme was first preincubated for 5 min at 30°C in assay mixtures containing everything but glucose 1-phosphate. Reactions were then initiated by addition of glucose 1-phosphate and quenched by addition of 10%percnt; trichloroacetic acid. The Ka and Hill coefficient, nH, of AMP were determined for each of the mutants at a glucose 1-phosphate concentration of 10 mM. AMP was varied in the range of 0 to 1 mM for the D283A and D283N mutants and in the range of 0 to 200 µM for the wild-type enzyme and the N284A, N284D, and F285L mutants. The substrate concentration at half-maximal velocity, [S]0.5, and nH of glucose 1-phosphate were determined for each of the mutants at 100 µM AMP. The concentration of glucose 1-phosphate was varied in the range of 0 to 0.6 mM for the D283A and D283N mutants and in the range of 0 to 6 mM for the wild-type enzyme and the N284A, N284D, and F285L mutants. The kinetic data were fit to the Hill equation by nonlinear regression with the program JMP (SAS Institute Inc., 1989). The Ki for glucose was determined for the mutants at an AMP concentration of 1 mM. The concentration of glucose 1-phosphate was varied in the ranges described above for each of the mutants, and substrate saturation curves were performed at five different glucose concentrations, with glucose varying from 0 to 400 mM for the D283A mutant, 0 to 200 mM for the N284D and D283N mutants, 5 to 40 mM for the N284A mutant, and 0 to 20 mM for the wild-type enzyme. Inhibition of the F285L mutant by caffeine was examined in the concentration range of 0 to 10 mM. The program SAAM was used for multivariate analysis, when required for determination of inhibition constants. Kinetic data for determination of the Ki values for glucose were fit to Equation 1 for a concerted model using the simplifying assumption that inhibitors bind exclusively to the inactive T-state (45Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1975Google Scholar). v=Vmax[S]Ks1+[S]KsL1+[I]Ki2+1+[S]Ks2 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]ethanesulfonic acid. Initial estimates of L between 1 and 20 were allowed to refine to give the best fit of the data. Final refined values of L ranged between 1 and 7 for the wild-type and mutant enzymes. Assays performed in the absence of inhibitors were done in triplicate. For the Ki determinations where much more data were required to accurately determine kinetic parameters, single measurements were taken at each glucose 1-phosphate and glucose concentration. Kinetic parameters are reported with the standard errors that were calculated by the curve-fitting programs. The mutants were characterized kinetically to determine the effects of mutations in the active site gate loop on allosteric regulation and catalytic activity. Amino acid replacements with alanine were designed to test the effects of substituting a residue with a neutral side chain incapable of forming normal hydrogen bonding interactions. Substitutions of either aspartate or asparagine were designed to test the effects of charge and hydrogen bonding potential. Substitution of leucine for Phe-285 was expected to weaken aromatic stacking interactions with inhibitors at the purine binding site. Kinetic parameters, determined from glucose 1-phosphate saturation curves for the enzyme variants, are shown in Table I. Removal of a negative charge at 283 apparently improves substrate binding. Substitution of either alanine or asparagine at 283 results in about a 16-fold decrease in the S0.5 for glucose 1-phosphate but no loss in substrate cooperativity. The D283N mutant, in fact, shows a significant increase in cooperativity for glucose 1-phosphate. Substitution of alanine or aspartate at 284 has little effect on binding of glucose 1-phosphate. About a 1.6-fold decrease is observed in the S0.5 for glucose 1-phosphate for both mutants, and substrate cooperativity is comparable with the wild-type enzyme. Substitution of Leu at Phe-285 has little effect on either the S0.5 for glucose 1-phosphate or substrate cooperativity.TABLE I.Kinetic parameters from substrate saturation curves for wild-type and mutant forms of phosphorylaseEnzymeVmaxaMaximal observed specific activity.nH[S]b[S]0.5 (G-1-P), glucose 1-phosphate concentration at half the maximal observed specific activity.0.5 [G-1-P]µmol/min/mgmmWild-type28.5 ± 0.31.40 ± 0.021.19 ± 0.02D283A1.42 ± 0.021.39 ± 0.050.074 ± 0.003D283N0.80 ± 0.022.0 ± 0.20.073 ± 0.003N284A10.6 ± 0.21.46 ± 0.050.70 ± 0.02N284D3.11 ± 0.071.31 ± 0.070.68 ± 0.04F285L7.5 ± 0.31.5 ± 0.11.4 ± 0.1a Maximal observed specific activity.b [S]0.5 (G-1-P), glucose 1-phosphate concentration at half the maximal observed specific activity.

Surprisingly, substitutions in the gate loop have long range effects that extend to the AMP site 30 Å away. Mutations reduce maximal velocity and decrease the effectiveness of the obligate activator, AMP. Substitution of alanine or asparagine at 283 results in a 10-fold decrease in catalytic activity, an elevated Ka for AMP, and a loss in cooperativity for AMP. Substitution of alanine at 284 reduces activity about 3-fold but has little effect on the apparent affinity or cooperativity of AMP binding. Substitution of aspartate at 284, however, reduces activity 10-fold, eliminates cooperativity for AMP, but has little effect on the Ka for AMP. Substitution of leucine at 285 lowers Vmax 2-fold, raises the Ka for AMP 3-fold, and decreases AMP cooperativity.TABLE II.AMP activation of wild-type phosphorylase and mutant enzymesa[S]0.5 [AMP], AMP concentration at half the maximal observed specific activity.EnzymeVmaxnH[S]0.5 [AMP]a[S]0.5 [AMP], AMP concentration at half the maximal observed specific activity.µmol/min/mgµMWild-type29.4 ± 0.31.57 ± 0.0416.5 ± 0.4D283A2.73 ± 0.031.25 ± 0.03103 ± 3D283N1.90 ± 0.031.23 ± 0.03136 ± 5N284A9.61 ± 0.051.66 ± 0.0318.5 ± 0.2N284D2.87 ± 0.051.00 ± 0.0213.3 ± 0.5F285L13.2 ± 0.41.28 ± 0.0753 ± 3a [S]0.5 [AMP], AMP concentration at half the maximal observed specific activity. Open table in a new tab The effects of mutations on inhibition of phosphorylase by glucose and caffeine were also investigated (see Table III). Substitutions of alanine or asparagine at Asp-283 raise the Ki for glucose 20- and 10-fold, respectively. Substitution of alanine for asparagine at position 284 has little effect on glucose inhibition. Only a 2-fold increase in the Ki for glucose is observed for this mutant; however, substitution of aspartate at 284 results in a 10-fold increase in the Ki for glucose. Replacement of Phe-285 with Leu raises the Ki for caffeine at least 10-fold. The limited solubility of the inhibitor made it impossible to determine an accurate Ki; however, the F285L mutant shows no inhibition by caffeine at a concentration of 10 mM, which completely inhibits the wild-type enzyme. The combined results show that substitutions in the 280's loop significantly alter regulatory behavior of glycogen phosphorylase.TABLE IIIGlucose inhibition of wild-type phosphorylase and mutant enzymesEnzymeKi[glucose]mmWild-type2.9 ± 0.4D283A60 ± 8D283N33 ± 12N284A6.0 ± 0.4N284D25 ± 3 Open table in a new tab Movement of the 280's loop during the allosteric transition couples quaternary structural changes induced by the binding of AMP at the dimer interface to tertiary structural changes that reposition residues at the active site (see Fig. 1). In the inactive state, Asp-283 of the gate occupies the phosphate subsite of the active site where it hinders binding of the substrate. During allosteric activation, reorientation of the 280's loop is accompanied by movement of Arg-569 into the active site where it contributes a salt-bridge interaction to phosphate in the substrate binding pocket (33Barford D. Johnson L.N. Nature. 1989; 340: 609-616Google Scholar, 35Withers S.G. Madsen N.B. Sprang S.R. Fletterick R.J. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 5372-5382Google Scholar, 36Goldsmith E.J. Sprang S.R. Hamlin R. Xuong N.H. Fletterick R.J. Science. 1989; 245: 528-532Google Scholar). These structural changes during the allosteric transition may account for homotropic cooperativity for the substrate, glucose 1-phosphate. In order to test the role of Asp-283 of the gate, site-directed mutagenesis was used to replace Asp-283 with alanine and asparagine residues. Both mutants exhibit elevated Ka values for AMP and diminished maximal velocities. Substrate cooperativity is comparable with the wild-type enzyme for the D283A mutant and is apparently increased for the D283N mutant. All of these observations suggest that these mutants have their conformational equilibria shifted toward an inactive state. The mutants, nevertheless, exhibit 16-fold decreases in the S0.5 for glucose 1-phosphate. Removal of a negatively charged side chain from the substrate binding pocket thus appears to enable glucose 1-phosphate to bind with greater affinity to the inactive conformer presumably because of the loss in competition between the carboxylate side chain and the phosphate of the substrate. The asparagine side chain in the D283N mutant might have been expected to interfere sterically with substrate binding in the inactive state; however, this mutant shows a similar S0.5 for glucose 1-phosphate to that of the D283A mutant. The asparagine side chain is likely displaced from the position normally found for Asp-283 in the wild-type enzyme. Substitutions of alanine or aspartate at neighboring Asn-284 have little effect on substrate binding or cooperativity. The 10-15-fold reduction in catalytic activities exhibited by the D283A and D283N mutants indicates that these substitutions either impair allosteric activation or more directly compromise catalytic function. The reduced cooperativity for AMP in the D283A and D283N mutants may reflect the inability of these mutants to achieve full activation. Cooperativity depends on the difference in ligand binding affinities and/or catalytic activities in inactive and activated conformational states. Diminished binding affinity for AMP in the activated state of a mutant, capable of only partial activation may, therefore, result in a corresponding loss in cooperativity. The gate may play a more important role in the active conformation than anticipated from crystallographic studies, which show the 280's loop to be disordered in structures of activated complexes (33Barford D. Johnson L.N. Nature. 1989; 340: 609-616Google Scholar, 35Withers S.G. Madsen N.B. Sprang S.R. Fletterick R.J. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 5372-5382Google Scholar, 36Goldsmith E.J. Sprang S.R. Hamlin R. Xuong N.H. Fletterick R.J. Science. 1989; 245: 528-532Google Scholar). Although the Monod et al. (1Monod J. Wyman J. Changeux J.-P. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 12: 88-118Google Scholar) model is often invoked to describe allosteric behavior in glycogen phosphorylase (1Monod J. Wyman J. Changeux J.-P. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 12: 88-118Google Scholar), reality is probably more complicated, and it is possible that activation is not entirely concerted. Binding of AMP to the enzyme induces structural changes at the dimer interface and triggers the rotation of the subunits (46Barford D. Hu S.H. Johnson L.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 233-260Google Scholar, 47Sprang S.R. Madsen N.B. Withers S.G. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 1100-1111Google Scholar). In the absence of substrates bound at the active site, these structural changes may only partially activate the enzyme. Binding of substrate at the active site may be necessary for triggering the local structural changes that are needed to achieve full activation. Electrostatic repulsion and steric interactions caused by binding of the substrate force the movement of the active site gate during the allosteric transition. In the mutants, the removal of the negatively charged carboxylate side chain eliminates the electrostatic repulsion between the gate and the substrate that normally drives movement of the loop during activation. Furthermore, the carboxylate group of Asp-283 normally forms an interdomain salt bridge interaction with His-571 as well as an intradomain interaction with the side chain of Asn-284 when the enzyme is in an inactive state (see Fig. 1). These contacts between the N- and C-terminal domains may be needed to transmit the structural changes across the domain interface that result in the rotation of the N- and C-terminal domains and the opening of the catalytic cleft. Crystallographic evidence indicates that the enzyme can indeed adopt partially activated conformational states. In the structure of the phosphorylated enzyme with the inhibitor glucose bound at the active site, the N terminus of the enzyme shows structural changes characteristic of activation; however, the active site gate remains in its closed conformation and the N- and C-terminal domains have not rotated apart (23Sprang S.R. Acharya K.R. Goldsmith E.J. Stuart D.I. Varvill K. Fletterick R.J. Madsen N.B. Johnson L.N. Nature. 1988; 336: 215-221Google Scholar). The inhibitor glucose binds in about the same position as the substrate glucose 1-phosphate, but because it lacks the negatively charged phosphate, it does not trigger the movement of the active site gate, and so a hybrid conformational state is captured. The universal conservation of Asp-283 and the proximity of the 280's loop to the active site make one suspect Asp-283 may do more than play a role in allosteric regulation (7Johnson L.N. Hajdu J. Acharya K.R. Stuart D.I. McLaughlin P.J. Oikonomakos N.G. Barford D. Herve G. Allosteric Enzymes. CRC Press Inc., Boca Raton, FL1989: 81Google Scholar, 21Fletterick R.J. Madsen N.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 31-61Google Scholar, 39Hudson J.W. Golding G.B. Crerar M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 700-721Google Scholar). The substantially reduced levels of catalytic activity in the D283A, D283N, and N284D mutants suggest that the 280's loop may participate in the formation of the active site or contribute secondary interactions that influence the positioning of residues in the catalytic cleft. Possibly, the loop participates directly in binding of the substrate, glycogen. No crystallographic structure is yet available of a complex of the enzyme with oligosaccharide bound at the active site, and perhaps the active site gate assumes an as yet uncharacterized configuration in the presence of glycogen and phosphate in the fully activated enzyme. In addition to the role of the active site gate in modulating substrate affinity during the allosteric response to ligand binding, residues of the 280's loop also participate in the binding of inhibitors. The role of the 280's loop in allosteric inhibition was investigated by kinetic analysis of several site-directed mutants. Substitution of Leu for Phe at 285 reduces binding of caffeine at least 10-fold. The loss in purine inhibition is consistent with the elimination of the aromatic stacking interaction with the phenyl ring at the purine inhibitory site. The asparagine side chain of Asn-284 normally forms a hydrogen bonding interaction with the C2 hydroxyl group of the inhibitor, glucose. The importance of this hydrogen bond for glucose binding was indicated by an earlier study, which showed that the glucose analogue, 2-deoxyglucose, binds to the enzyme with 10-fold weaker affinity than glucose (38Sprang S.R. Goldsmith E.J. Fletterick R.J. Withers S.G. Madsen N.B. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 5364-5371Google Scholar). Loss of the asparagine side chain in the N284A mutant, however, increases the Ki for glucose only 2-fold. The hydrogen bond may somehow be compensated for by interactions with a water molecule or perhaps another residue. The substitution of Asp at 284, in contrast, elevates the Ki for glucose 10-fold. The weaker binding of glucose in this mutant may be caused indirectly by displacement of the Asp-283 side chain due to unfavorable electrostatic interactions between the neighboring carboxylate groups. Although crystallographic structures show that Asp-283 forms no direct interactions with the glucose inhibitor, hydrogen bonding interactions and van der Waals contacts with residues of the C-terminal domain and with the side chain of Asn-284, which does form a direct hydrogen bonding interaction with the glucose inhibitor, may be critical for maintaining the structure and positioning of the loop. Substitutions of asparagine and alanine at 283 increase the Ki for glucose 10- and 20-fold, respectively. The sensitivity of glucose inhibition to substitutions at 283 indicates that interactions with the carboxylate side chain help to maintain the complementarity of the glucose binding pocket to the inhibitor. The flexibility of the 280's loop makes it ideally suited for its roles in modulating substrate and effector binding and for communicating regulatory signals between the subunit interface and the active site. Other allosteric proteins also possess loops that play key roles in conferring allosteric properties. In phosphofructokinase, the 6F loop plays a similar role in altering substrate affinity in R- and T-states (48Schirmer T. Evans P.R. Nature. 1990; 343: 140-145Google Scholar). In the T-state, Glu-161 of the 6F loop protrudes into the active site and impedes binding of the substrate, fructose 6-phosphate. In the R-state, Glu-161 swings away and Arg-162 moves into a position where it can form a salt-bridge interaction with the phosphate of the substrate. Similarly, in aspartate transcarbamylase, activation is associated with the repositioning of residues of the 240's loop and movement of Arg-229 into the active site where it forms a salt-bridge interaction with the β-carboxylate of aspartate (49Kim K.H. Pan Z.X. Honzatko R.B. Ke H.M. Lipscomb W.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 853-875Google Scholar, 50Krause K.L. Volz K.W. Lipscomb W.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1643-1647Google Scholar, 51Krause K.L. Volz K.W. Lipscomb W.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 527-553Google Scholar). In cyclin-dependent kinase 2, the T-loop blocks the active site and hinders the binding of ATP and the peptide substrate when the enzyme is in an inactive state (52De Bondt H.L. Rosenblatt J. Jancarik J. Jones H.D. Morgan D.O. Kim S.H. Nature. 1993; 363: 595-602Google Scholar). Allosteric effects in all these enzymes are mediated by mobile loops that adopt alternate conformations in inactive and active states. The interchange in position of residues in flexible loops may prove to be a general structural mechanism for modulating substrate affinity during R- to T-state switching in allosteric proteins."

Here we show that SII contacts the 3′-end of nascent RNA within an RNA polymerase II elongation complex as detected by photoaffinity labeling. Photocross-linking was dependent upon the presence of SII, incorporation of 4-thio-UMP into RNA, and irradiation and was sensitive to treatment by RNase and proteinase. A transcriptionally active mutant of SII lacking the first 130 amino acids was also cross-linked to the nascent RNA, but SII from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is inactive in concert with mammalian RNA polymerase II, failed to become photoaffinity labeled. SII-RNA contact was not detected after a labeled oligoribonucleotide was released from the complex by nascent RNA cleavage, demonstrating that this interaction takes place between elongation complex-associated but not free RNA. This shows that the 3′-end of RNA is near the SII binding site on RNA polymerase II and suggests that SII may activate the intrinsic RNA hydrolysis activity by positioning the transcript in the enzyme's active site.

RNA polymerase II in the arrested conformation cannot extend an RNA chain in the presence of all four NTPs. Arrested complexes retain transcription potential, however, since they can be reactivated for RNA chain extension by elongation factor SII. SII can bind RNA polymerase II in vitro, and SII binding is thought to be the activating event for a ribonuclease activity within RNA polymerase II (reviewed in Ref. 1Reines D. Conaway R. Conaway J.W. Transcription. Raven Press, New York1994: 263Google Scholar). This ribonuclease removes a small number of nucleotides from the 3′-end of the nascent RNA prior to its re-extension through the blockage (2Izban M.G. Luse D.S. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18762-18770Google Scholar). Genetic evidence suggests that SII has an in vivo role related to RNA polymerase II function which involves the binding of SII to RNA polymerase II's largest subunit (7Archambault J. Lacroute F. Ruet A. Friesen J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4142-4152Google Scholar, 8Wu J. Awrey D.E. Edwards A.M. Archambault J. Friesen J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93 (in press)Google Scholar). Although SII binds to purified RNA polymerase II, it has been difficult to isolate elongation complex-associated SII, presumably because the lifetime of the interaction is very short (9Sluder A.E. Greenelaf A.L. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8963-8969Google Scholar, 10Bengal E. Flores O. Krauskopf A. Reinberg D. Aloni Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1195-1206Google Scholar). Full-length SII does not bind nucleic acids at physiological ionic strength (11Agarwal K. Baek K.H. Jeon C.J. Miyamoto K. Ueno A. Yoon H.S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7842-7851Google Scholar). Specific internal and extensive N-terminal deletion mutants of SII bind DNA, RNA, and DNA:RNA hybrids in gel mobility shift assays, suggesting that cryptic nucleic acid binding activity is a property of SII which may be revealed only after SII associates with an elongation complex (11Agarwal K. Baek K.H. Jeon C.J. Miyamoto K. Ueno A. Yoon H.S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7842-7851Google Scholar). However, the functional significance of SII's nucleic acid binding activity in the context of RNA cleavage and the stimulation of elongation is unknown. Contacts between RNA and the largest two RNA polymerase II subunits have been elucidated by cross-linking radiolabeled RNAs synthesized in the presence of photoactive nucleotide analogues (12Bartholomew B. Dahmus M.E. Meares C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14226-14231Google Scholar, 13Riva M. Carles C. Sentenac A. Grachev M.A. Mustaev A.A. Zaychikov E.F. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2248-2253Google Scholar). Similarly, the β′ and β subunits of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase can be cross-linked to nascent RNA (see Ref. 16Markovtsov V. Mustaev A. Goldfarb A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3221-3226Google Scholar and references therein). Since full-length SII may bind nucleic acids preferentially in the context of an elongation complex, we set up a system to trap SII on the complex and detect an interaction between SII and the nascent RNA. We report here that full-length SII, but not transcriptionally inactive SII, can be cross-linked to the nascent RNA via a photoactive nucleotide situated at the 3′-end of the transcript. This contact may be important in the elongation function of SII. RNA polymerase II and basal transcription factors were isolated from rat liver (17Conaway R.C. Reines D. Garrett K.P. Powell W. Conaway J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 273 (in press)Google Scholar) or purified from E. coli (for TFIIB) (18Tsuboi A. Conger K. Garrett K.P. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Arai N.

SII and MgCl2 were added, and the reaction was incubated for 1.5 min at 28°C. After washing three times with reaction buffer, [α-32P]CTP (20 µCi, 3000 Ci/mmol), 400 µM GTP, 100 µM UTP or 4-thio-UTP, and 7 mM MgCl2 were added and incubated for 1 h at 28°C. Reactions were stopped with SDS and treated with proteinase K. RNA was precipitated with ethanol and electrophoresed on 5%percnt; polyacrylamide, 50%percnt; urea gels. Elongation complexes bearing labeled RNA were washed three times and resuspended in cross-linking buffer (40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 60 mM KCl, 0.5 mM EDTA). These complexes were liberated from S. aureus by digestion with ribonuclease T1 (200 units/reaction) at 28°C for 15 min, followed by centrifugation for 2 min at 4°C to remove the cells. This treatment removed bases 1-180 from the nascent RNA (23Gu W. Wind M. Reines D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6935-6940Google Scholar). SII or ΔSII was added to the supernatant, and the reaction was incubated at 28°C for 15 min. Reactions were transferred to a polystyrene microtiter plate (Corning), which was placed in a Pyrex dish filled with water and UV-illuminated for 30 min at 4°C on a Photodyne model 3-3500 transilluminator (12Bartholomew B. Dahmus M.E. Meares C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14226-14231Google Scholar). Proteins were precipitated in 10%percnt; trichloroacetic acid and electrophoresed on polyacrylamide-SDS gels as indicated. Gels were fixed in 0.56%percnt; (v/v) methanol, 1%percnt; (v/v) acetic acid, 10%percnt; (v/v) glycerol for 30 min, dried, and subjected to autoradiography and analysis on a Fuji phosphoimaging system. The template used in these reactions contains the core adenovirus major late promoter and a segment of the human histone H3.3 gene containing an intrinsic arrest site called Ia. Transcription in the absence of SII results in approximately half of the RNA polymerase II molecules becoming arrested at site Ia (positions 205, 206, and 207, where 1 is the transcription start site) (Fig. 1A; Ref. 5Gu W. Powell W. Mote Jr., J. Reines D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25604-25616Google Scholar). SII treatment results in full read-through of site Ia. An intermediate in read-through is an elongation complex bearing an RNA shortened by 7-9 nucleotides at the 3′-end (5Gu W. Powell W. Mote Jr., J. Reines D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25604-25616Google Scholar). When arrested complexes are washed free of NTPs, the shortened transcript and the cleaved oligonucleotide can be observed (4Gu W. Reines D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30441-30447Google Scholar). We took advantage of this intermediate to incorporate a radioactive marker and a photoactive nucleotide analogue, 4-thio-UMP, into RNA. In the presence of [α-32P]CTP and GTP, complexes bearing the 198-base cleaved transcript could be extended to G200 with a single 32P atom in the transcript between bases 198 and 199 (Fig. 1, A and B, lane 1). In the presence of 100 µM UTP, the RNA is extended to positions U204, U205, and U206 (Fig. 1B, lane 2; Ref. 4Gu W. Reines D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30441-30447Google Scholar). Although 4-thio-UTP can serve as a substrate in this reaction, it is utilized less efficiently than UTP and results in slightly shorter transcripts (Fig. 1B, lane 4 versus lane 2). Comparison with a ladder of UMP-containing transcripts differing in length by one nucleotide suggests that the 4-thio-UMP-containing transcripts are comprised primarily of RNAs of 203, 204, and 205 nucleotides in length, containing three, four, and five 4-thio-UMP residues, respectively (data not shown). 4-Thio-UMP-containing transcripts were also less effectively extended in the presence of all four natural NTPs (33 versus 10%percnt; read-through of site Ia; Fig. 1B, lane 3 versus lane 5). The decreased read-through efficiency could result from slower addition of nucleotides to the 4-thio-UMP-containing 3′-end of the nascent transcript and/or an increasing likelihood that these complexes become arrested. UV irradiation of these 4-thio-UMP-containing complexes resulted in the cross-linking of nascent RNA to the two largest subunits of RNA polymerase II as seen previously (Ref. 12Bartholomew B. Dahmus M.E. Meares C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14226-14231Google Scholar; Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 2). When a fraction containing recombinant, full-length, human SII was allowed to bind the complexes in the absence of Mg2+ prior to irradiation, a polypeptide corresponding to the size of SII (48 kDa, including mass of cross-linked RNA) was also photoaffinity-labeled (Fig. 2, lane 1). Neither SII nor RNA polymerase II subunits were labeled if the complexes were not subjected to UV exposure (Fig. 2, lane 5). Similarly, when UTP was substituted for 4-thio-UTP in the reaction, photoaffinity labeling was not observed for either SII or RNA polymerase II subunits (Fig. 2, lane 6). The cross-linked products were sensitive to proteinase K (10 µg for 10 min; Fig. 2, lane 4), indicating that the radioactive bands contained a protein component. When photolabeled RNA polymerase II complexes were disrupted with SDS and treated with a mixture of RNase A and RNase T1, free RNA was digested and the 32P label was removed from the end of the cross-linked RNA (Fig. 2, lane 3), demonstrating the presence of an RNA component in the labeled species. When SII and all basal transcription factors were mixed with 4-thio-UMP-containing RNA, UV irradiation failed to produce photoaffinity-labeled polypeptides. 1W. Powell, data not shown. In summary, SII-RNA cross-linking was dependent on the presence of SII, a transcription elongation complex, incorporation of 4-thio-UMP, and irradiation with UV light. Quantitation of free and cross-linked RNA showed that approximately 1-2%percnt; of the RNA was cross-linked to SII, while 45%percnt; was cross-linked to high molecular weight polypeptides that co-migrate with the two largest RNA polymerase II subunits. RNA polymerase II was 1-2 orders of magnitude more reactive with derivatized RNA than was SII. We cannot exclude the possibility that additional SII molecules were co-cross-linked to RNA with RNA polymerase II subunits, precluding visualization as a high mobility band. That RNA polymerase II cross-links with greater efficiency than SII is consistent with SII's rapid partitioning between the complex and solution compared with the stoichiometric association of RNA polymerase II with RNA. We estimate the purity of recombinant human SII (TSK-phenyl-5PW) fraction used in the experiment depicted in Fig. 2 to be approximately 30%percnt; based on silver staining of SDS gels. The failure of the other proteins in this mixture to become photolabeled argues for the specificity of cross-linking. To confirm that the cross-linked species was indeed SII, and not a contaminating bacterial protein, we performed similar experiments using recombinant SII further purified by TSK-SP-5PW chromatography to apparent homogeneity (4Gu W. Reines D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30441-30447Google Scholar). We found that a polypeptide of identical mobility cross-linked with comparable efficiency when added in the same proportion relative to the RNA polymerase II complexes (approximately 150-fold molar excess) (Fig. 3, lanes 1 and 2). When an identical TSK-phenyl fraction containing an even greater excess of yeast SII (Fig. 3, lane 4), which was unable to activate RNA cleavage in the mammalian RNA polymerase II complex,1 was added, no SII cross-linking was observed, as was the case for a buffer-only control (Fig. 3, lane 3). We further confirmed the identity of the putative SII polypeptide by testing as a substrate a smaller version of SII lacking the first 130 amino acid residues (ΔSII). This deletion mutant can activate nascent RNA cleavage and stimulate read-through of the Ia site (20Cipres-Palacin G. Kane C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8087-8091Google Scholar). This truncated form of the protein cross-linked to the nascent RNA, and the protein:RNA conjugate displayed a correspondingly faster electrophoretic mobility (27 kDa, including the mass of the RNA) on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 4, lane 1 versus lane 3). ΔSII was cross-linked to RNA with approximately one-half the efficiency of the full-length molecule.Fig. 4Photoaffinity labeling of full-length and truncated SII in the presence or absence of Mg2+. Cross-linking of full-length recombinant human SII (TSK-phenyl, 1.25 µg, lane 1), no added SII (lane 2), or ΔSII (ProBond (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) fraction, 1.8 µg). Lane 4 shows the loss of cross-linking when MgCl2 is included in the SII binding reaction prior to UV irradiation. Positions of molecular mass markers and cross-linked polypeptides are indicated on this 12%percnt; SDS-polyacrylamide gel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Current models for SII function suggest that this elongation factor binds the RNA polymerase II complex and activates nascent RNA cleavage and arrest site read-through in a Mg2+-dependent fashion. Thereafter, SII is probably released from the complex (9Sluder A.E. Greenelaf A.L. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8963-8969Google Scholar, 10Bengal E. Flores O. Krauskopf A. Reinberg D. Aloni Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1195-1206Google Scholar). Here, we have trapped SII on the elongation complex by withholding MgCl2, thereby preventing the cleavage and removal of the 32P- and 4-thio-UMP-containing 3′-end of the nascent RNA. Under cleavage conditions, i.e. when Mg2+ was included in the binding reaction prior to UV irradiation, photoaffinity labeling of RNA polymerase II subunits decreased by greater than 90%percnt;, and photoaffinity labeling of SII was no longer observed (Fig. 4, lane 4). Thus, the detection of the RNA:SII contact is a function of the presence of the RNA in an elongation complex prior to its removal by the cleavage reaction and again demonstrates the specificity of cross-linking. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the direct detection of a biochemical interaction between full-length SII and RNA or a specific, active RNA polymerase II elongation complex. Earlier studies of RNA contacts with RNA polymerase II subunits employed a similar technique with HeLa nuclear extracts, which presumably contained SII (e.g. Ref. 12Bartholomew B. Dahmus M.E. Meares C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14226-14231Google Scholar). The failure to detect this interaction could be related to the low efficiency of SII cross-linking, the low in vivo abundance of SII compared with these reactions, the presence of Mg2+ in the reaction, and/or the more random placement of 4-thio-UMP nucleotides at positions distant from the 3′-end of the molecule. The experiments presented here were also performed using RNA polymerase II complexes located at or near an arrest site at which SII-activated cleavage is favored over most template positions. GreA (24Borukhov S. Polyakov A. Nikiforov V. Goldfarb A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8899-8902Google Scholar) and GreB (25Borukhov S. Sagitov V. Goldfarb A. Cell. 1993; 72: 459-466Google Scholar) are structurally distinct elongation factors from E. coli that are functionally analogous to SII. Both factors promote read-through of arrest sites by RNA polymerase and stimulate nascent RNA cleavage by the enzyme (25Borukhov S. Sagitov V. Goldfarb A. Cell. 1993; 72: 459-466Google Scholar). Like SII, GreB relieves the arrested condition by inducing cleavage of large oligonucleotides from nascent RNA (25Borukhov S. Sagitov V. Goldfarb A. Cell. 1993; 72: 459-466Google Scholar). GreA functions differently since it must be present before arrest to stimulate read-through and the RNA is shortened by a dinucleotide increment (25Borukhov S. Sagitov V. Goldfarb A. Cell. 1993; 72: 459-466Google Scholar). Similar to what we observe here, GreA has recently been shown to contact the nascent transcript in an E. coli elongation complex (26Stebbins C.E. Borukhov S. Orlova M. Polyakov A. Goldfarb A. Darst S.A. Nature. 1995; 373: 636-640Google Scholar). The contact of SII and RNA in the RNA polymerase II elongation complex is likely to be functionally important because: 1) it is specific for complex-associated RNA, 2) GreA makes a similar contact in the E. coli RNA polymerase complex, and 3) previous work using SII fragments suggests the existence of a cryptic nucleic acid binding capability in the full-length molecule (11Agarwal K. Baek K.H. Jeon C.J. Miyamoto K. Ueno A. Yoon H.S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7842-7851Google Scholar). The close proximity or perhaps identity of the active site for SII-activated RNA cleavage and that for nucleotide addition (27Rudd M.D. Izban M.G. Luse D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8057-8061Google Scholar) suggests that the SII:RNA contact may be of some functional or architectural importance to the catalytic center of the RNA polymerase II elongation complex. In addition to a possible allosteric rearrangement of RNA polymerase II upon binding, SII may be directly involved in the positioning of the RNA within the active site before cleavage. This may help explain how SII dramatically enhances the rate of RNA polymerase II's RNA cleavage reaction. It is tempting to speculate that SII's contact with the region of the transcript to be removed by cleavage may also facilitate the removal of the oligonucleotide from the RNA product site. The possibility remains, however, that the contact between SII and the 3′-end of the RNA detected here may simply reflect a close relationship between SII's docking site on RNA polymerase II and the enzyme's active site. Nonetheless, this work places SII in close proximity to the catalytic center of the enzyme, and it is an important step toward defining the geometry of the active site of elongating RNA polymerase II.
