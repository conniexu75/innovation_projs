https://openalex.org/W2014899456,"We previously identified a common set of genes, termed atrogenes, whose expression is coordinately induced or suppressed in muscle during systemic wasting states (fasting, cancer cachexia, renal failure, diabetes). To determine whether this transcriptional program also functions during atrophy resulting from loss of contractile activity and whether atrogene expression correlates with the rate of muscle weight loss, we used cDNA microarrays and RT-polymerase chain reaction to analyze changes in mRNA from rat gastrocnemius during disuse atrophy induced by denervation or spinal cord isolation. Three days after Den or SI, the rate of muscle weight loss was greatest, and 78% of the atrogenes identified during systemic catabolic states were induced or repressed. Of particular interest were the large inductions of key ubiquitin ligases, atrogin-1 (35- to 44-fold) and MuRF1 (12- to 22-fold), and the suppression of PGC-1alpha and PGC-1beta coactivators (15-fold). When atrophy slowed (day 14), the expression of 92% of these atrogenes returned toward basal levels. At 28 days, the atrophy-inducing transcription factor, FoxO1, was still induced and may be important in maintaining the ""atrophied"" state. Thus, 1) the atrophy associated with systemic catabolic states and following disuse involves similar transcriptional adaptations; and 2) disuse atrophy proceeds through multiple phases corresponding to rapidly atrophying and atrophied muscles that involve distinct transcriptional patterns."
https://openalex.org/W1964535559,"Pannexin-1 is a recently identified membrane protein that can act as a nonselective pore permeable to dyes such as ethidium when ectopically expressed. Blockade of pannexin-1 in macrophage endogenously expressing the ATP-gated P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) blocks the initial dye uptake, but not the ionic current, and also blocks processing and release of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) in response to P2X7R activation. These results suggest that pannexin-1 may be a hemichannel activated by the P2X7R to provide the conduit for dye uptake and downstream signaling to processing and release of IL-1β. We have pursued this hypothesis by measuring dye uptake and IL-1β processing and release in mouse J774 macrophage in response to P2X7R activation and to maitotoxin and nigericin, two agents considered to evoke IL-1β release via the same mechanism. The experiments were carried out over time periods during which no lactate dehydrogenase was released from cells to examine only noncytolytic pathways. P2X7R activation evoked dye uptake that could be separated into two components by pannexin-1 inhibition: an initial rapid phase and a slower pannexin-1-independent phase. Maitotoxin-evoked dye uptake was unaltered by pannexin-1 inhibition. Nigericin did not induce dye uptake. Inhibition of pannexin-1 blocked caspase-1 and IL-1β processing and release in response to all three stimuli. Thus, although pannexin-1 is required for IL-1β release in response to maitotoxin, nigericin, and ATP, a mechanism distinct from pannexin-1 hemichannel activation must underlie the former two processes.

Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) 2The abbreviations used are: IL, interleukin; MTX, maitotoxin; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; CBX, carbenoxolone; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; siRNA, small interfering RNA; HEK, human embryonic kidney. is the crucial pro-inflammatory cytokine whose early release from activated macrophage leads to the generation of the host defense response to bacterial toxins, injuries, and other inflammatory challenges (1Dinarello C.A.

IL-1β is synthesized as a 34-kDa pro-peptide that has no biological activity until it is cleaved by activated caspase-1 resulting in its mature, bioactive 17-kDa form (2Ferrari D. Pizzirani C.

IL-1β synthesis is initiated by inflammatory stimuli such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), but little or none is released in the absence of a secondary stimulus (2Ferrari D. Pizzirani C. Adinolfi E.

Although much is known about the formation of the cytosolic multiprotein complex that is responsible for caspase-1 activation (the inflammasome) (2Ferrari D. Pizzirani C. Adinolfi E. Lemoli R.M.

Trends Immunol. 2005; 26: 447-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar), how secondary stimuli act to trigger inflammasome activation and subsequent release of bioactive IL-1β remains poorly understood. One of the most potent physiological triggers for the processing and release of mature IL-1β is activation of the ATP-gated P2X7 receptor channel, which itself is up-regulated in response to LPS and other inflammatory stimuli (2Ferrari D. Pizzirani C. Adinolfi E. Lemoli R.M. Curti A. Idzko M. Panther E. Virgilio Di. F. J. Immunol. 2006; 176: 3877-3883Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar). The P2X7 receptor is an unusual cation-selective ion channel whose activation by relatively high levels of extracellular ATP evokes not only ionic current but also results in the passage of large molecules up to about 900 Da (2Ferrari D. Pizzirani C. Adinolfi E. Lemoli R.M. Curti A. Idzko M. Panther E. Virgilio Di. F. J. Immunol. 2006; 176: 3877-3883Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar, 5North R.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 1013-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (2490) Google Scholar). Passage of these larger molecules, usually assayed by measuring the uptake of fluorescent dyes such as ethidium and YoPro1, has been considered to represent the opening of a “large pore” (2Ferrari D. Pizzirani C. Adinolfi E. Lemoli R.M. Curti A. Idzko M. Panther E. Virgilio Di. F. J. Immunol. 2006; 176: 3877-3883Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar, 5North R.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 1013-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (2490) Google Scholar). The P2X7R ion channel opens with kinetics generally similar to other ligand-gated ion channels (i.e. within milliseconds), whereas the large pore is activated some seconds later (2–10 s depending on receptor density and agonist concentration) (2Ferrari D. Pizzirani C. Adinolfi E. Lemoli R.M. Curti A. Idzko M. Panther E. Virgilio Di. F. J. Immunol. 2006; 176: 3877-3883Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar, 5North R.A. Physiol.

Until recently, the general consensus was that the P2X7R channel protein itself dilated over several seconds to a size sufficient to allow dye uptake (5North R.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 1013-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (2490) Google Scholar). However, several indirect lines of evidence obtained over the past 3–4 years led to the more likely idea that a distinct, accessory protein linked to the activation of the P2X7Ris directly responsible for the dye uptake (5North R.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 1013-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (2490) Google Scholar, 6Virginio C. Mackenzie A. North R.A. Surprenant A. J.

EMBO J. 2006; 25: 5071-5082Crossref PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar). Pannexins are a three-membered family of mammalian membrane proteins (Panx1, 2, and 3) about which little is currently known. They were identified in 2003–2004 by low stringency homology to invertebrate gap junction proteins, innexins (10Bruzzone R. Hormuzdi S.G. Barbe M.T. Herb A. Monyer H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Born T.L. Usman M. Staroverov D. Lukyanov S. Panchin Y. Genomics. 2004; 83: 706-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar), and Panx1 can form gap junction-like connections that allow intercellular passage of dyes when overexpressed in two adjacent oocytes or mammalian epithelial cell lines (10Bruzzone R. Hormuzdi S.G. Barbe M.T. Herb A. Monyer H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13644-13649Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar, 12Vanden Abeele F. Bidaux G. Gordienko D. Beck B.

However, there is no evidence to date that endogenous Panx1 forms gap junctions. Overexpression of Panx1 in single oocytes or mammalian cells also results in the formation of “hemichannel-like” nonselective pores (9Pelegrin P. Surprenant A. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 5071-5082Crossref PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar, 10Bruzzone R. Hormuzdi S.G. Barbe M.T. Herb A. Monyer H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

FEBS Lett. 2004; 13: 65-68Crossref Scopus (637) Google Scholar), and we have obtained evidence that endogenous Panx1 forms the dye-permeable uptake path upon activation of P2X7Rs (9Pelegrin P. Surprenant A. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 5071-5082Crossref PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar). We found that Panx1 and P2X7R co-immunoprecipitate in P2X7R-expressing cells and that selective inhibition of Panx1 by siRNA silencing or by a Panx1-mimetic inhibitory peptide blocked ATP-evoked dye uptake but not receptor activation or its resulting ionic current. Of general physiological significance, Panx1 protein was up-regulated in macrophage in response to inflammatory challenge with LPS, and its selective inhibition in these activated macrophage blocked the P2X7R-mediated processing of caspase-1 and subsequent processing and release of IL-1β (9Pelegrin P. Surprenant A. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 5071-5082Crossref PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar). These results suggest a direct functional link between P2X7R-mediated dye uptake and activation of caspase-1/IL-1β processing and release. To further elucidate Panx1 signaling processes underlying IL-1β processing/release, we have examined whether and how Panx1 may be involved in IL-1β release evoked by two well known nonphysiological secondary stimuli that have been thought to act via the same mechanism(s) as P2X7R, the marine toxin, maitotoxin, which activates (or forms) calcium-permeable, cationic currents and also leads to ethidium and YoPro1 uptake, and the K+/H+ antiport ionophore, nigericin (7Schilling W.P.

We compared dye uptake induced by ATP, maitotoxin, and nigericin in HEK cells stably expressing P2X7R and both dye uptake and caspase-1/IL-1β processing/release in mouse J774 macrophage, which natively express P2X7R before and after selective blockade of Panx1. We find that all three stimuli require signaling through Panx1 to induce caspase-1/IL-1β processing and release, but Panx1 is involved only with an initial phase of P2X7R-mediated dye uptake, whereas dye-uptake pathways are not involved in IL-1β processing/release induced by maitotoxin or nigericin. Materials—Carbenoxolone (CBX), ethidium bromide, ATP, nigericin, and Escherichia coli LPS were from Sigma, and maitotoxin was from Alexis. The Panx1 mimetic blocking peptide 10panx1 (WRQAAFVDSY), the connexin 32 blocking peptide 32gap27 (SRPTEKTVFT), and the other Panx1 peptides (GTQISCFSPS, CFSPSSFSWRQAA, QKNSLQSESGNLP, YCWAAVQQKNSLQSESGNLP, LRNDSTVPDQFQ, and SGILRNDSTVPDQF) were synthesized by Sigma-Genosys and Alta Biosciences. Cell Culture—J774 murine macrophages cell line was cultured in RPMI and human embryonic kidney 293 cells in F-12 medium, all supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). RNA Interference—Small interference RNAs against human Panx1 was carried out as described previously (9Pelegrin P. Surprenant A. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 5071-5082Crossref PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK293 cells stably expressing P2X7 receptors were transfected using Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen) and 200 pmol of Panx1-siRNA (5′-GCUCCAAGGUAUGAACAUAtt-3′) or Silencer® negative control 1 siRNA (Ambion) as the negative scrambled control. The cells were cultured for 48 h at 37 °C before experiments, and mRNA expression levels for Panx1, P2X7R, and β-actin were determined by reverse transcriptase-PCR. Reverse Transcriptase-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen), followed by reverse transcription using SUPERSCRIPT™ III (Invitrogen) RNase H-reverse transcriptase with oligo(dT). Specific primers for Panx1, rat P2X7R, or β-actin were previously reported (9Pelegrin P. Surprenant A. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 5071-5082Crossref PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar) and used in PCR. The obtained product sizes for Panx1 (610 bp), rat P2X7R (585 bp), and β-actin (1.1 kb) were as expected from their mRNA sequences. Fluorescence Assays—Dye uptake experiments were carried out using a Nikon confocal microscope under 20× objective, and ethidium fluorescence was measured at 543/590 nm excitation/emission. The cells were preincubated for 15 min at 37 °C with 500 μm of 10panx1 or 1 mm of other Panx1 peptides or 32gap27 peptide, following the addition of 20 μm ethidium. The images were recorded at 5–10-s intervals for 2 min before and during superfusion at 37 °C with ATP, nigericin, or maitotoxin for 5–20 min in standard physiological extracellular solution (except otherwise stated) consisting of 147 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, 13 mm glucose, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm KCl. For each experiment, the time course of ethidium fluorescence was measured for 30 isolated (not touching) cells and then averaged to obtain the mean fluorescent signal, and the slope of the fluorescent signal versus the time was used as the most accurate and consistent measurement for comparisons. Digitonin (100 μm) was used at the end of the experiments to induce maximum dye uptake. Western Blotting—J774 macrophages were seeded at 2 × 106 cells/well in a 6-well dish on the night before treatment. The cells were stimulated with LPS (1 μg/ml) for 4 h, washed twice with the same solution used for dye uptake experiments, and preincubated for 30 min with 500 μm 10panx1 or 1 mm of other Panx1 peptides or 32gap27 peptide and 5 mm ATP, 0.2 nm maitotoxin, or 5 μm nigericin applied for 10–20 min. The cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2) supplemented with 1% Triton X-100 and Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) for 1 h at 4 °Cand centrifuged to remove particulate matter. The supernatants were clarified by brief centrifugation and 60% of the volume was concentrated using 10-kDa nominal molecular mass cut-off filters (Millipore). 15 μg of total protein and the concentrated supernatants were resolved in 4–15% polyacrylamide gels, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore) by electroblotting, and immunoblotted with 1:1000 of anti-IL-1β mouse monoclonal antibody (3ZD; Biological Resources Branch, NCI) or with 1:500 of anti-caspase-1 p10 rabbit polyclonal antibody for mouse (Santa Cruz), following horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (DA-KOCytomation) at 1:2000 dilution and detection using the ECL Plus kit (Amersham Biosciences) and Kodak Bio-Max MS film (Sigma). The results were analyzed by densitometry measurements using GeneSnap/GeneTools software (Syngene). LDH Release Assay—The presence of LDH in the media was detected in all of the experiments using a cytotoxicity detection kit (Roche Applied Science) following the manufacturer's instructions and compared with the total amount of LDH in the cells. In all of the experiments described in this study, the percentage of LDH present in the media was <8%. K+ Release Assay—Cellular and released K+ were measured against standards using the Ciros Vision inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometer (Spectro Analytical UK Ltd). For these experiments, the cells were seeded at 1 × 106 cells/well in a 12-well dish on the night before treatment. The cells were treated with 1 μg/ml LPS for 4 h, washed twice, and preincubated for 30 min with 500 μm of 10panx1, following 20 min with 5 mm ATP, 0.2 nm maitotoxin, or 5 μm nigericin. The medium was removed, and the cells were lysed in 1 ml of 10% nitric acid. Statistical Analysis—The average results are expressed as the means ± S.E. from the number of assays indicated. The data were analyzed by an unpaired Student's t test to determine difference between groups using Instat (GraphPad) and Excel (Microsoft) software. Panx1-dependent and -independent Dye Uptake—We first compared the kinetics of ethidium uptake evoked by ATP, maitotoxin, and nigericin in HEK cells stably expressing P2X7R. Because all of these agents can result in cell death by apoptosis and/or necrosis if the duration and/or concentration of stimulus is sufficient (7Schilling W.P. Wasylyna T. Dubyak G.R.

BMC Physiol. 2001; 1: 2-13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we titrated both of these variables to limit our experiments to conditions where cytolysis could be ruled out. We did this by measuring LDH release as a function of duration and concentration of agonist; all of the data presented in this study were obtained under conditions where LDH release was <8% of total cellular LDH. The conditions for HEK cells were 3 mm ATP/10 min (LDH release < 8%, n = 8), 0.5 nm maitotoxin/20 min (LDH release < 2%, n = 8), and 5 μm nigericin/20 min (LDH release < 2%, n = 8). The basal levels of LDH release varied from 0.2 to 1.6% (n = 16). Fig. 1A illustrates the markedly different rates of ethidium uptake induced by ATP, maitotoxin, and nigericin. ATP induced rapid dye uptake, which saturated the system optics within 3–5 min; dye uptake to maitotoxin was 1–2 orders of magnitude slower, whereas no dye uptake occurred in response to nigericin. In particular, no significant dye uptake occurred in response to maitotoxin during the same period (1–5 min) over which ATP evoked its maximum response (Fig. 1, B and C). In agreement with our previous study (9Pelegrin P. Surprenant A. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 5071-5082Crossref PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar), inhibition of Panx1 using Panx1-targetted siRNA decreased ATP-evoked ethidium uptake by 70–90% over the initial 3–5 min of agonist application (Fig. 1, B and E). However, significant ethidium uptake was observed when agonist application was prolonged to 10–15 min; this delayed uptake can be seen most clearly in Fig. 1C in which dye uptake has been plotted on a logarithmic time scale. The kinetics of the Panx1-insensitive component of the ATP-evoked response were similar to the kinetics of the maitotoxin-evoked ethidium uptake (Fig. 1, C and E). Panx1 siRNA did not alter maitotoxin-induced dye uptake in the same experiments in which this treatment effectively inhibited the initial phase of the ATP-evoked dye uptake and in which reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis showed complete absence of Panx1 mRNA (Fig. 1D). The results from all of the experiments as illustrated in Fig. 1 (A–C) are summarized in the histogram shown in Fig. 1E where the slope of the ethidium uptake is plotted. We previously generated a series of peptides corresponding to residues within the putative extracellular loops of Panx1 and found one, 10panx1, that effectively and selectively inhibited ATP-mediated dye uptake but not P2X7R activation (9Pelegrin P. Surprenant A. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 5071-5082Crossref PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar). To gain further confidence in its function as a selective Panx1 inhibitor, we compared in more detail the actions of 10panx1 and six other Panx1-mimetic peptides corresponding to other putative ectodomain residues in Panx1 (Fig. 2A). Here we found that kinetics of ATP-evoked ethidium uptake (up to 20 min agonist application) were not significantly changed by any of the six Panx1-mimetic peptides (1 mm) targetted to other regions of Panx1, whereas 10panx1 (0.5 mm) reduced the slope of the ATP-evoked response by 66.2 ± 5.4% (n = 9; Fig. 2, A and E). Similar to results obtained with Panx1 siRNA, 10panx1 revealed a slower component to the ATP-mediated dye uptake whose kinetics were similar to those of the maitotoxin-induced dye uptake (seen on logarithmic time scale in Fig. 2D), and maitotoxin-induced ethidium uptake was unaffected by 10panx1 (Fig. 2, C–E). We also examined the actions of CBX on ATP and maitotoxin-evoked dye uptake. CBX is a licorice derivative that is a potent inhibitor of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (at nanomolar concentrations), an effective inhibitor of Panx1-evoked currents in Panx1-overexpressing cells (at 1–20 μm), and a gap junction inhibitor via blockade of connexin (at 10–500 μm) (9Pelegrin P. Surprenant A. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 5071-5082Crossref PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar, 13Bruzzone R. Barbe M.T. Jakob J.N. Monyer H. J.

CBX (20 μm) had identical actions to 10panx1 inhibitory peptide or Panx1 siRNA; it inhibited the initial component of the ATP-evoked dye uptake but was without effect on the maitotoxin-induced response (Fig. 2E). We carried out identical experiments on J774 macrophage after establishing noncytolytic conditions. These were 5 mm ATP/20 min (LDH release 6.5 ± 0.6%, n = 8), 0.2 nm maitotoxin/20 min (7.8 ± 0.7%, n = 9), and 5 μm nigericin/20 min (7.5 ± 1.8%, n = 9), with control LDH levels of 1.4 ± 0.2% (n = 26). We found essentially identical results to those obtained from HEK cells ectopically expressing P2X7R; maitotoxin-evoked dye uptake was approximately 10 times slower than ATP-evoked dye uptake (Fig. 3, A and C), whereas nigericin did not evoke any dye uptake (Fig. 3E). 10panx1 reduced the initial dye uptake induced by ATP and revealed a slower component that was the same as the maitotoxin-induced response (Fig. 3, B–D). CBX (20 μm) gave identical results (data not shown). Panx1 Signaling Is Required for Maitotoxin-, Nigericin-, and ATP-mediated IL-1β Release—We next carried out Western blot analysis of IL-1β processing and release after the same 20-min stimulation period under noncytolytic conditions with each of these releasers. As observed in several previous studies (2Ferrari D. Pizzirani C. Adinolfi E. Lemoli R.M. Curti A. Idzko M. Panther E. Virgilio Di. F. J.

Nigericin (Fig. 4A), maitotoxin (Fig. 4B), and ATP (Fig. 4) all induced the release of mature IL-1β (17-kDa band) into the medium. When 10panx1-mimetic inhibitory peptide was present, none of these compounds resulted in the release of any form of IL-1β (Fig. 4). Fig. 4C also shows further evidence for the selective inhibition by 10panx1 where it can be seen that another Panx1-mimetic peptide (14panx1) did not alter the ATP-induced release of mature IL-1β (Fig. 4C, fourth lane, nor did incubation with the connexin-mimetic gap junction inhibitory peptide, 32gap27 (27Chaytor A.T.

Based on semi-quantitative densitometry measurements, we calculated the amount of mature IL-1β in the medium at 20 min of stimulation as a percentage of total IL-1β to be 21.5 ± 2.6% with ATP, 39.7 ± 10.8% with maitotoxin and 12 ± 0.9% with nigericin (n = 3–11). These high levels of mature IL-1β released make it improbable that any significant amount resulted from possible active processes associated with cell death that previously have been reported (15Watanabe N.

However, to unequivocally rule out the involvement of any cytolytic process in our experiments, we also examined IL-1β processing and release at times where LDH release differed not at all from basal levels; in this series of experiments, the shortest time at which we could reliably detect mature IL-1β in the medium by Western blot was 10 min, and LDH levels at this time point were not different from basal levels (1.2 ± 0.3% versus 1.9 ± 0.2%, n = 5). Even under these quite stringent conditions 10panx1-mimetic peptide abolished agonist-stimulated processing and release of IL-1β (Fig. 5A). Blockade of Panx1 not only blocked processing and release of IL-1β by all three agonists but also prevented the upstream intracellular processing of caspase-1. Western blot analysis of cell lysates using the caspase-1 antibody revealed the processing of caspase-1 (10-kDa, p10 band) in LPS-primed J774 cells by both maitotoxin and nigericin (Fig. 5B, third and fifth lanes)"
https://openalex.org/W2152181679,"Oleoylethanolamide (OEA) is a lipid mediator that inhibits food intake by activating the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α. In the rodent small intestine OEA levels decrease during food deprivation and increase upon refeeding, suggesting that endogenous OEA may participate in the regulation of satiety. Here we show that feeding stimulates OEA mobilization in the mucosal layer of rat duodenum and jejunum but not in the serosal layer from the same intestinal segments in other sections of the gastrointestinal tract (stomach, ileum, colon) or in a broad series of internal organs and tissues (e.g. liver, brain, heart, plasma). Feeding also increases the levels of other unsaturated fatty acid ethanolamides (FAEs) (e.g. linoleoylethanolamide) without affecting those of saturated FAEs (e.g. palmitoylethanolamide). Feeding-induced OEA mobilization is accompanied by enhanced accumulation of OEA-generating N-acylphosphatidylethanolamines (NAPEs) increased activity and expression of the OEA-synthesizing enzyme NAPE-phospholipase D, and decreased activity and expression of the OEAdegrading enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase. Immunostaining studies revealed that NAPE-phospholipase D and fatty acid amide hydrolase are expressed in intestinal enterocytes and lamina propria cells. Collectively, these results indicate that nutrient availability controls OEA mobilization in the mucosa of the proximal intestine through a concerted regulation of OEA biosynthesis and degradation.

The gastrointestinal tract controls key aspects of feeding behavior through both neuronal and humoral mechanisms. Among the regulatory signals released by the gut, peptides such as cholecystokinin (CCK), 3The abbreviations used are: CCK, cholecystokinin; EC50, half-maximal effective concentration; FAE, fatty acid ethanolamide; FAAH, fatty-acid amide hydrolase; NAPE, N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamine; NAPE-PLD, NAPE-specific phospholipase D; OEA, oleoylethanolamide; PEA, palmitoylethanolamide; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PPAR-α, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α; LC, liquid chromatography; MS, mass spectroscopy. glucagon-like peptide-1, and ghrelin have attracted the most attention (1Broberger C. J. Intern. Med. 2005; 258: 301-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), but recent evidence indicates that lipid-derived messengers such as oleoylethanolamide (OEA) may also be involved (2Lo Verme J. Gaetani S. Fu J. Oveisi F. Burton K. Piomelli D. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 708-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). OEA is synthesized in the small intestine of various vertebrate species, where its levels decrease during food deprivation and increase upon refeeding (3Rodríguez de Fonseca F. Navarro M. Gómez R.

The possibility that these fluctuations represent a satiety signal is suggested by experiments in rodents which show that pharmacological administration of OEA delays meal initiation and prolongs the interval between successive meals, resulting in a persistent inhibition of food intake (3Rodríguez de Fonseca F.

These anorexiant effects are strikingly different from those elicited by traditional satiety factors such as CCK, which reduce meal size without affecting the interval between meals (9Little T.J. Horowitz M. Feinle-Bisset C. Obes. Rev. 2005; 6: 297-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Moreover, the hypophagic actions of OEA differ from those exerted by glucagon-like peptide-1 (10Strader A.D. Woods S.C.

In vitro studies have shown that OEA is a high affinity agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPAR-α) (13Fu J. Gaetani S. Oveisi F. Lo Verme J. Serrano A. Rodriguez de Fonseca F. Rosengarth A. Luecke H. Di Giacomo B. Tarzia G. Piomelli D. Nature. 2003; 425: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar), a nuclear receptor present in the small intestine and implicated in the regulation of energy balance and lipid metabolism (14Desvergne B. Wahli W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 649-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (2746) Google Scholar, 15Kersten S. Wahli W. Experientia (Basel). 2000; 89: 141-151Google Scholar, 16Berger J. Moller D.E. Annu. Rev.

Sci. 2002; 967: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). OEA binds to the purified ligand binding domain of PPAR-α with a KD of ∼40 nm and activates this receptor in cell-based assays with a half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) of 120 nm (13Fu J. Gaetani S. Oveisi F. Lo Verme J. Serrano A. Rodriguez de Fonseca F. Rosengarth A. Luecke H. Di Giacomo B. Tarzia G. Piomelli D. Nature. 2003; 425: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in vivo experiments have revealed that genetic deletion of PPAR-α abrogates the anorexiant effects of OEA without altering those evoked by CCK-8 and fenfluramine (13Fu J. Gaetani S. Oveisi F. Lo Verme J. Serrano A. Rodriguez de Fonseca F. Rosengarth A. Luecke H. Di Giacomo B. Tarzia G. Piomelli D. Nature. 2003; 425: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar). Finally, it has been shown that synthetic PPAR-α agonists, but not agonists of PPAR-δ and PPAR-γ, produce a hypophagic response that is behaviorally indistinguishable from that elicited by OEA and is absent in mutant mice lacking PPAR-α (13Fu J. Gaetani S. Oveisi F. Lo Verme J. Serrano A. Rodriguez de Fonseca F. Rosengarth A. Luecke H. Di Giacomo B. Tarzia G. Piomelli D. Nature. 2003; 425: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar). A parsimonious interpretation of these results is that OEA regulates food intake in rodents by selectively activating intestinal PPAR-α. Notably, OEA can also activate the G protein-coupled receptor, GPR119 (8Overton H.A. Babbs A.J. Doel S.M. Fyfe M.C. Gardner L.S. Griffin G. Jackson H.C. Procter M.J. Rasamison C.M.

Physiol.(Lond). 2005; 564: 541-547Crossref Scopus (181) Google Scholar), albeit at micromolar concentrations. However, the contribution of these receptors to the satiety-inducing effects of OEA is still undefined. The enzyme pathway considered responsible for OEA formation and deactivation in mammalian tissues is illustrated in Fig. 1. Its first step is the transfer of a fatty acid residue from the sn-1 position of phosphatidylcholine to the free amine group of phosphatidylethanolamine. This reaction is catalyzed by an N-acyltransferase, which remains to be molecularly identified, and yields a heterogeneous family of N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamine (NAPE) species. The second step is the cleavage of NAPEs to produce other fatty acid ethanolamides (FAEs), including OEA, a step catalyzed by NAPE-specific phospholipase D (NAPE-PLD) (19Okamoto Y. Morishita J.

OEA deactivation consists in the intracellular hydrolysis of this lipid amide to oleic acid and ethanolamine, which is thought to be mediated by fatty-acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), an intracellular membrane-bound serine hydrolase (21McKinney M.K. Cravatt B.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 411-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar), and/or N-acylethanolamine-hydrolyzing acid amidase (NAAA), a lysosomal cysteine hydrolase (22Tsuboi K.

In the present study we show that food intake promotes OEA mobilization in the mucosal layer of the rodent proximal intestine through a concerted regulation of NAPE biosynthesis, NAPE-PLD activity, and OEA hydrolysis. Animals—Adult male Wistar rats (250-300 g) were purchased from Charles River (Wilmington, MA). FAAH-/- and NAPE-PLD-/- mice were generated and bred as described (23Cravatt B.F. Demarest K.

A 12-hour light/dark cycle was set with lights on at 5:30 a.m. Water and standard chow pellets (Prolab RMH 2500; PMI Nutrition International, Brentwood, MO) were available ad libitum, except when animals were food-deprived. Food deprivation was conducted for 24 h in bottom-wired cages to prevent coprophagia. All procedures met the National Institutes of Health guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of California, Irvine. Chemicals—Fatty acid chlorides were purchased from Nu-Chek Prep (Elysian, MN), 1,2-Dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine was from Sigma-Aldrich, and tetrahydrolipstatin was from ChemPacific (Baltimore, MD). N-Cyclohexanecarbonylpentadecylamine was a kind gift from Dr. Natsuo Ueda (Kagawa University, Kagawa, Japan). Chemical Syntheses—URB597 was synthesized as described (25Mor M. Rivara S. Lodola A. Plazzi P.V. Tarzia G. Duranti A. Tontini A. Piersanti G. Kathuria S. Piomelli D. J. Med. Chem. 2004; 47: 4998-5008Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). OEA and other FAEs were prepared by the reaction of fatty acid chlorides with a 10-fold molar excess of ethanolamine (Sigma-Aldrich) or [2H4]ethanolamine (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Andover, MA). Reactions were conducted in dichloromethane at 0-4 °C for 15 min with stirring. The products were washed with water, dehydrated over sodium sulfate, filtered, and dried under N2. They were characterized by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Purity was >98% by LC/MS. NAPEs were prepared by the reaction of fatty acid chlorides with a 2-fold molar excess of 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine. Reactions were conducted in dichloromethane at 25 °C for 2 h using triethylamine (Sigma-Aldrich) as a catalyst. The products were washed with water, fractionated by silica gel thin-layer chromatography (chloroform/methanol/ammonia, 80:20:2, v/v/v), and characterized by LC/MS coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MSn). Purity was >95%. Lipid Extractions—Rats were sacrificed with halothane, and tissues were rapidly collected and snap-frozen in liquid N2. Plasma was prepared as described (26Giuffrida A. Rodriguez de Fonseca F. Piomelli D. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 280: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Frozen tissues were weighed and homogenized in methanol (1 ml/100 mg of tissue) containing [2H4]FAEs and 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-heptadecanoyl as internal standards. Lipids were extracted with chloroform (2 volumes) and washed with water (1 volumes). Organic phases were collected and dried under N2. FAEs and NAPEs were fractionated by open-bed silica gel column chromatography as described (27Cadas H. di Tomaso E. Piomelli D. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1226-1242Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the lipids were reconstituted in chloroform and loaded onto small glass columns packed with Silica Gel G (60-Å 230-400 Mesh ASTM; Whatman, Clifton, NJ). FAEs and NAPEs were eluted with 9:1 and 5:5 chloroform/methanol (v/v), respectively. Eluates were dried under N2 and reconstituted in 0.1 ml of chloroform/methanol (1:4, v/v) for LC/MS and LC/MSn analyses. LC/MS Analyses—We used an 1100-LC system coupled to a 1946A-MS detector (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) equipped with an electrospray ionization interface. FAEs were separated using a XDB Eclipse C18 column (50 × 4.6-mm inner diameter, 1.8 μm, Zorbax) eluted with a gradient of methanol in water (from 85 to 90% methanol in 2.5 min) at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. Column temperature was kept at 40 °C. MS detection was in the positive ionization mode, capillary voltage was set at 3 kV, and fragmentor voltage was varied from 120 to 140 V. N2 was used as drying gas at a flow rate of 13 liters/min and a temperature of 350 °C. Nebulizer pressure was set at 60 p.s.i. Quantifications were conducted using an isotope-dilution method, monitoring Na+ adducts of the molecular ions ([M+Na]+). Limit of quantification for OEA was 0.25 pmol, as determined by injecting into the LC/MS various amounts of OEA in the presence of 100 pmol of [2H4]OEA standard. LC/MSn Analyses—We used an 1100-LC system (Agilent Technologies) equipped with a Ion Trap XCT (Agilent Technologies). NAPEs were separated using a Poroshell 300SB C18 column (75 × 2.1-mm inner diameter, 5 μm, Agilent) maintained at 50 °C. A linear gradient of methanol (A) in water (B) containing 5 mm ammonium acetate and 0.25% acetic acid (from 85 to 100% of B in 4 min) was applied at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Detection was set in the negative mode, capillary voltage was 4.5 kV, skim1 was -40V, and capillary exit was -151V. N2 was used as drying gas at a flow rate of 12 liters/min, temperature of 350 °C, and nebulizer pressure of 80 p.s.i. Helium was used as the collision gas. Tissue-derived NAPEs were identified by comparison of their LC retention times and MSn fragmentation patterns with those of authentic standards, prepared as described above. We acquired full-scan MSn spectra of selected NAPE precursor ions by multiple reaction monitoring. Extracted ion chromatograms were used to quantify each NAPE precursor ion by monitoring characteristic product ions as follows: 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-phosphoethanolamine-N-oleoyl (m/z 1030.8 > 744.8), 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-phosphoethanolamine-N-palmitoyl (m/z 1004.8 > 718.8) and 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-heptadecanoyl (m/z 942.8 > 704.8), which was used as internal standard. Detection and analysis were controlled by Agilent/Bruker Daltonics software version 5.2, and three-dimensional maps were generated using MS Processor from Advanced Chemistry Development, Inc. (Toronto, Canada). NAPE-PLD Assays—Rats were anesthetized with halothane and sacrificed by decapitation. Tissues were removed and homogenized in ice-cold Tris-HCl (20 mm, 10 volumes, pH 7.4) containing 0.32 m sucrose. NAPE-PLD activity was measured at 37 °C for 30 min in Tris-HCl buffer (50 mm, pH 7.4) containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, tissue homogenate protein (100 μg), and 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-heptadecenoyl (100 μm) as substrate. The reactions were stopped by adding chloroformmethanol (2:1, v/v) containing [2H4]OEA as the internal standard. After centrifugation at 1500 × g at 4 °C for 5 min, the organic layers were collected and dried under N2. The residues were suspended in 50 μl of chloroform/methanol (1:3, v/v) and analyzed by LC/MS. For quantification purposes, we monitored the [M+Na]+ ions of m/z = 334 for N-heptadecanoylethanolamide and m/z = 352 for [2H4]OEA. FAAH Assays—Tissues homogenates were centrifuged at 800 × g for 15 min and then at 27,000 × g for 30 min. The 27,000 × g pellet was suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4). Reactions were conducted at 37 °C for 30 min in 0.5 ml of Tris buffer (50 mm, pH 8.0) containing fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (0.05%), protein (50 μg) and [ethanolamine-3H]anandamide (10,000 dpm, specific activity 20 Ci/mmol; American Radiolabeled Chemicals, St. Louis, MO) or [ethanolamine-3H]OEA (10,000 dpm, specific activity 15 Ci/mmol; American Radiolabeled Chemicals). After stopping the reaction with 1 ml of chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v), we measured radioactivity in the aqueous layers by liquid scintillation counting. Quantitative PCR—Total RNA was extracted from tissue with TRIzol™ (Invitrogen) and quantified with Ribogreen™ (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). cDNA was synthesized from 2 μg of total RNA by using Superscript II RNase H reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Real-time quantitative PCR was performed in an Mx 3000P system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Primers and fluorogenic probes were synthesized at TIB (Adelphia). The primer/probe sequences were: NAPE-PLD, TGGCTGGGACACGCG (forward primer), GGGATCCGTGAGGAGGATG (reverse primer), CGCTGATGGTGGAAATGGACGAGC (probe); FAAH, GCCTCAAGGAATGCTTCAGC (forward primer), TGCCCTCATTCAGGCTCAAG (reverse primer), ACAAGGGCCACGACTCCACACTGG (probe); glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, AAGTATGATGACATCAAGAAGGTGGT (forward primer), AGCCCAGGATGCCCTTTAG (reverse primer), AAGCAGGCGGCCGAGGGC (probe). mRNA expression levels were normalized by using glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase as an internal standard and were calculated as described (28Schmittgen T.D. Zakrajsek B.A. Mills A.G. Gorn V. Singer M.J. Reed M.W. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 285: 194-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). Antibody Generation—We constructed a glutathione S-transferase-linked peptide comprising residues 38-53 of rat NAPE-PLD. The DNA fragment was amplified using primers incorporated with BamHI and XhoI restriction sites on the 5′ and 3′ end of amplicon, respectively. After digestion with BamHI and XhoI, amplicon was subcloned into vector pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences). The fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia coli BL-21 cells (Novagen, Madison, WI) and purified using glutathione-Sepharose™ 4B (Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer's instruction. The polyclonal NAPE-PLD antibody was raised in rabbits and characterized using standard procedures (29Twitchell W. Brown S. Mackie K. J. Neurophysiol. 1997; 78: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemistry—Mice were deeply anesthetized with halothane, and their tissues were fixed by cardiac perfusion with saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (0.1 m, pH 7.2). The duodenum was collected and rinsed with PBS. 15-μm-Thick transverse sections were cut with a Cryostat. The sections were rehydrated and treated with 0.3% H2O2 in methanol for 30 min to inactivate endogenous peroxidases, rinsed in PBS for 10 min, exposed to blocking serum (3% normal goat serum) for 2 h at room temperature, rinsed again in PBS, and incubated overnight at 4 °C with the NAPE-PLD antibody (1:1000 dilution) or a commercial anti-FAAH antibody (1:500 dilution; Chemicon, Temecula, CA). After the incubation, the sections were rinsed in 0.1 m PBS for 10 min and exposed to anti-rabbit IgG HRP (1:1000 dilution, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for 1 h. After an additional 10-min rinse, the sections were treated with VectaStain® Elite ABC reagent (Vector) for 30 min and developed with the diaminobenzidine detection kit (Vector). The sections were counterstained by hematoxylin and mounted with Permount (Sigma). Protein Analysis—Rat jejunal mucosa was homogenized in Tris-HCl buffer (50 mm, pH 8.0) containing protease inhibitor mixture V (Calbiochem). 20 μg of homogenate were electrophoresed on 4-15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Invitrogen) and transferred onto Immobilon™ membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Western blot analyses were conducted using antibodies against NAPE-PLD (1:1,000), FAAH (1:500; Chemicon), and β-actin (1:10,000; Calbiochem). Bands were visualized with an electrochemiluminescence (ECL)-Plus kit (Amersham Biosciences). Statistical Analyses—Results are expressed as the means ± S.E. Statistical significance was evaluated using Student's t test or, when appropriate, one-way analysis of variance followed by the Dunnett's post hoc test. Analyses were conducted using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA), and differences were considered significant if p < 0.05. Effects of Nutrient Availability on OEA Mobilization in Rat Tissue—We used an isotope-dilution LC/MS assay to measure OEA levels in various organs and tissues of free-feeding rats, 24-h food-deprived rats, or 24-h food-deprived rats that had been reexposed to food for 10, 30, or 60 min.

By contrast, no such a change was observed in other intestinal segments (ileum, stomach, and colon) (Fig. 2C and Table 1), in a broad panel of internal organs and tissues (kidney, heart, lung, skeletal muscle, liver, pancreas, spleen, epididymal white adipose pads, plasma) (Table 1), or in brain structures involved in the control of feeding (brainstem, hypothalamus, thalamus, striatum, and cortex) (Table 2). Indeed, several visceral organs, including liver and pancreas, responded to food deprivation with an increase rather than a decrease in OEA levels (Table 1), suggesting that nutrient availability regulates OEA mobilization in a tissue-specific manner.TABLE 1Effects of 24-h food deprivation on OEA levels in various organs and tissues of ratsStomachColonKidneyHeartLungMuscleLiverPancreasSpleenWATPlasmaFF108.3 ± 7.472.8 ± 5.658.4 ± 5.6104.3 ± 8.6115.8 ± 9.792.5 ± 3.680.7 ± 3.244.3 ± 3.758.0 ± 2.9174.3 ± 10.35.9 ± 0.4FD102.1 ± 9.168.4 ± 2.362.1 ± 2.997.9 ± 10.6111.6 ± 8.289.1 ± 7.2136.3 ± 6.5ap < 0.01 vs. food deprivation (Student's t test).69.4 ± 12.8ap < 0.01 vs. food deprivation (Student's t test).66.6 ± 6.6ap < 0.01 vs. food deprivation (Student's t test).215.8 ± 7.6ap < 0.01 vs. food deprivation (Student's t test).7.9 ± 0.5ap < 0.01 vs. food deprivation (Student's t test).a p < 0.01 vs. food deprivation (Student's t test).

The results of these analyses are reported in Table 3. Identifications were based on the detection of sodium adduct ions ([M+Na]+) of appropriate m/z values and retention times and were confirmed by comparison with synthetic FAE standard. Food deprivation decreased intestinal levels of OEA (18:1Δ9), linoleoylethanolamide (18:2Δ9,12), linolenoylethanolamide (18:3Δ9,12,15), and docosahexaenoylethanolamide (22:6Δ4,7,10,13,16,19) (Table 3). By contrast, food deprivation did not change the duodenal or jejunal content of palmitoylethanolamide (PEA, 16:0) (Fig. 3, A and B) and stearoylethanolamide (18:0) (Table 3). Moreover, as previously reported (4Petersen G. Sorensen C. Schmid P.C. Artmann A. Tang-Christensen M. Hansen S.H. Larsen P.J. Schmid H.H. Hansen H.S. Biochim. Biophys.

The findings indicate that food intake (i) enhances the intestinal mobilization of a subgroup of FAEs that include OEA, but not PEA and stearoylethanolamide, and (ii) differentially regulates OEA and anandamide mobilization in the small intestine; the mechanism responsible for fasting-induced anandamide mobilization was not further investigated.TABLE 3Chemical structures and tissue levels (pmol/g tissue) of various FAEs in rat small intestine Open table in a new tab Localization of Feeding-dependent OEA Mobilization in the Small Intestine—To test whether nutrient availability differentially affects OEA mobilization in the luminal and serosal portions of the small intestinal wall, we separated these structures with a blunt spatula (Fig. 4A) and measured OEA content in each of them separately. Fasting and refeeding strongly altered OEA mobilization in luminal fractions of duodenum or jejunum (Fig. 4, B and D) but had no effect"
https://openalex.org/W2018631912,"Recent studies have demonstrated that activated microglia play an important role in dopamine (DA) neuronal degeneration in Parkinson disease (PD) by generating NADPH-oxidase (NADPHO)-derived superoxide. However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie microglial activation in DA cell death are still disputed. We report here that matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) was newly induced and activated in stressed DA cells, and the active form of MMP-3 (actMMP-3) was released into the medium. The released actMMP-3, as well as catalytically active recombinant MMP-3 (cMMP-3) led to microglial activation and superoxide generation in microglia and enhanced DA cell death. cMMP-3 caused DA cell death in mesencephalic neuron-glia mixed culture of wild-type (WT) mice, but this was attenuated in the culture of NADPHO subunit null mice (gp91(phox-/-)), suggesting that NADPHO mediated the cMMP-3-induced microglial production of superoxide and DA cell death. Furthermore, in the N-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-injected animal model of PD, nigrostriatal DA neuronal degeneration, microglial activation, and superoxide generation were largely attenuated in MMP-3-/- mice. These results indicate that actMMP-3 released from stressed DA neurons is responsible for microglial activation and generation of NADPHO-derived superoxide and eventually enhances nigrostriatal DA neuronal degeneration. Our results could lead to a novel therapeutic approach to PD."
https://openalex.org/W2058449885,"Emerging evidence indicates that C-reactive protein (CRP) has at least two conformationally distinct isoforms, i.e., pentameric CRP (pCRP) and monomeric CRP (mCRP or CRP subunit). Both CRP isoforms are proposed to play roles in inflammation and may participate in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. However, the origin of mCRP in situ and the interplay between the two CRP isoforms under physiological/pathological circumstances remain elusive. Herein, by probing conformational alteration, neoepitope expression, and direct visualization using electron-microscopy, we have shown that calcium-dependent binding of pCRP to membranes, including liposomes and cell membranes, led to a rapid but partial structural change, producing molecules that express CRP subunit antigenicity but with retained native pentameric conformation. This hybrid molecule is herein termed mCRP(m). The formation of mCRP(m) was associated with significantly enhanced complement fixation. mCRP(m) can further detach from membrane to form the well-recognized mCRP isoform converted in solution (mCRP(s)) and exert potent stimulatory effects on endothelial cells. The membrane-induced pCRP dissociation not only provides a physiologically relevant scenario for mCRP formation but may represent an important mechanism for regulating CRP function."
https://openalex.org/W2105761603,"Maintenance of an adequate supply of cholesterol is important for neuronal function, whereas excess cholesterol promotes amyloid precursor protein (APP) cleavage generating toxic amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides. To gain insights into the pathways that regulate neuronal cholesterol level, we investigated the potential for reconstituted apolipoprotein E (apoE) discs, resembling nascent lipoprotein complexes in the central nervous system, to stimulate neuronal [3H]cholesterol efflux. ApoE discs potently accelerated cholesterol efflux from primary human neurons and cell lines. The process was saturable (17.5 μg of apoE/ml) and was not influenced by APOE genotype. High performance liquid chromatography analysis of cholesterol and cholesterol metabolites effluxed from neurons indicated that <25% of the released cholesterol was modified to polar products (e.g. 24-hydroxycholesterol) that diffuse from neuronal membranes. Thus, most cholesterol (∼75%) appeared to be effluxed from neurons in a native state via a transporter pathway. ATP-binding cassette transporters ABCA1, ABCA2, and ABCG1 were detected in neurons and neuroblastoma cell lines and expression of these cDNAs revealed that ABCA1 and ABCG1 stimulated cholesterol efflux to apoE discs. In addition, ABCA1 and ABCG1 expression in Chinese hamster ovary cells that stably express human APP significantly reduced Aβ generation, whereas ABCA2 did not modulate either cholesterol efflux or Aβ generation. These data indicate that ABCA1 and ABCG1 play a significant role in the regulation of neuronal cholesterol efflux to apoE discs and in suppression of APP processing to generate Aβ peptides.

Thus total neuronal cholesterol levels and membrane cholesterol distribution are important determinants not only of normal neuronal function but also of pathogenic APP processing. A precise understanding of the factors controlling neuronal cholesterol homeostasis is therefore clearly required to define the pathways contributing to neurodegeneration and to design therapeutic approaches for Alzheimer disease. Neurons, like all cells, synthesize cholesterol via the mevalonate pathway and endocytose lipoproteins via the low-density lipoprotein receptor and members of the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein family (2Pfrieger F.W. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 1158-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Apolipoprotein E (apoE) as a constituent of lipoprotein particles is an important ligand for these receptors in the central nervous system (15Pitas R.E. Boyles J.K. Lee S.H. Hui D. Weisgraber K.H. J.

Both the synthetic and endocytic pathways are subject to feedback down-regulation, however, because the passive diffusion of cholesterol from cell membranes is extremely inefficient, when cholesterol levels are elevated beyond the needs of the cell, an export mechanism is required to remove the excess cholesterol. Neurons selectively express cholesterol 24-hydroxylase and it has been shown that the cholesterol oxidation product 24-S-hydroxy-cholesterol (24-OH-Ch) can be released from cells and diffuse through the blood-brain barrier into the circulation (17Lund E.G.

As cholesterol cannot be enzymatically degraded, this pathway is thought to contribute to the removal of excess neuronal cholesterol and to balance cholesterol synthesis in the central nervous system (2Pfrieger F.W.

Previous research indicates that micromolar concentrations of 24-OH-Ch are neurotoxic and proinflammatory (21Kolsch H. Lutjohann D. Tulke A. Bjorkhem I. Rao M.L. Brain Res. 1999; 818: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 22Alexandrov P. Cui J.G. Zhao Y. Lukiw W.J. Neuroreport. 2005; 16: 909-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and that deletion of 24-OH-Ch oxidase activity in Cyp46a1 knock-out mice resulted in a partial (∼40%) reduction in brain cholesterol synthesis without neurological abnormalities (23Lund E.G.

These observations suggest that in addition to the 24-OH-Chol pathway, another neuronal cholesterol efflux pathway may exist. Several members of the ATP-binding cassette subfamily A transporters (ABCA1, A2, A3, A7, and A8) that are potentially involved in trans-membrane lipid transport are expressed in isolated human neurons and neuronal cell lines (24Kim W.S. Guillemin G.J. Glaros E.N. Lim C.K. Garner B. Neuroreport. 2006; 17: 891-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 25Pohl A. Devaux P.F. Herrmann A. Biochim. Biophys.

ABCG1 and ABCG4 are also strongly expressed in the brain and there is evidence that ABCG1 is expressed in mouse neuronal tissue (26Nakamura K. Kennedy M.A. Baldan A. Bojanic D.D. Lyons K.

ABCA/G transporters are well known to transport cholesterol across the plasma membrane to apolipoprotein acceptors in peripheral tissues and this constitutes the initial step in the reverse cholesterol transport pathway (28Jessup W. Gelissen I.C. Gaus K. Kritharides L. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2006; 17: 247-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Studies in macrophages have revealed that apoA-I initially interacts with ABCA1 to generate a partially lipidated discoidal complex that subsequently interacts with ABCG1 to acquire additional cholesterol, which may be esterified by the action of lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase to generate core lipids and thus a spherical lipoprotein particle (29Oram J.F.

Previous reports have suggested that apoE discs could participate in cellular cholesterol efflux (31LaDu M.J. Reardon C. Van Eldik L. Fagan A.M. Bu G. Holtzman D. Getz G.S. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Based on this earlier work and our identification of specific ABC transporters in human neurons (24Kim W.S. Guillemin G.J. Glaros E.N. Lim C.K. Garner B. Neuroreport. 2006; 17: 891-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) we hypothesized that apoE discs may stimulate cholesterol efflux from neurons via ABCA/G transporters. In the present work we have therefore investigated the potential for apoE discs to stimulate cholesterol efflux from neurons, the contribution that 24-OH-Ch makes to total cholesterol efflux, and the role that specific ABCA/G transporters expressed in neurons may play in this pathway. Because neuronal cholesterol balance regulates APP processing, we also examined the impact of ABCA/G transporters on Aβ peptide generation. Materials—Cell culture media and additives were obtained from Invitrogen (Melbourne, Australia) unless stated otherwise. Recombinant human Aβ-(1–40) and Aβ-(1–42) were purchased from rPeptide (Athens, GA), stored lyophilized at –20 °C until use and a 1 mm stock solution prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide directly before addition to cell culture medium. Human ABCA1, ABCA2, and apoE cDNAs were generously provided by Professor Mason Freeman (Harvard Medical School), Professor Kenneth Tew (Medical University of South Carolina), and Professor Karl Weisgraber (Gladstone Institutes, University of California, San Francisco). Cell Culture—Human fetal brain tissues were obtained from 14–18-week-old aborted fetuses collected after therapeutic termination following informed consent (ethical approval from the University of New South Wales Human Research Ethics Committee, HREC03187). Neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia were isolated from the brain tissues and cultured as previously described (24Kim W.S. Guillemin G.J. Glaros E.N. Lim C.K. Garner B. Neuroreport. 2006; 17: 891-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The cell lines SK-N-SH, NTERA-2 (NT2), HEK293, and BV2 were obtained from the ATCC (Manassas, VA). Human foreskin fibroblasts (AG01518) were obtained from the Coriell Institute (Camden, NJ). All cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in humidified air containing 5% CO2. HEK293 cells were grown on poly-d-lysine-coated plates to ensure maximal adhesion. The CHO cell lines stably expressing human ABCG1 (CHO-ABCG1) or the human 695-amino acid APP (CHO-APP) were generated as described previously (30Gelissen I.C. Harris M. Rye K.A. Quinn C. Brown A.J.

The recombinant plasmids were maintained using Zeocin (200 μg/ml) and puromycin (7.5 μg/ml), respectively. Transfected cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Transfection—Transient transfection was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 and Opti-MEM I (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, cells were seeded at ∼90% confluence in 12-well plates using antibiotic-free medium. cDNA-Lipofectamine complex was added to the cells and after 24 h of incubation samples were collected for gene expression analysis. In the case of cholesterol efflux assays the cells were cultured for up to an additional 24 h. Cholesterol Efflux Assay—Cellular cholesterol efflux was measured as described previously (42Glaros E.N.

In brief, cells were labeled with 2 μCi/ml [3H]cholesterol (Amersham Biosciences) for 24 h, rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and incubated for 2 h in medium containing 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA) to allow equilibration of [3H]cholesterol in intracellular pools. The cells were rinsed once more in PBS and then incubated in serum-free medium containing 0.1% BSA with or without cholesterol acceptors for up to 24 h (i.e. 0.1% BSA is always present). Media samples were collected at specific time points and cleared of any cellular debris by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min. The cells were lysed with 0.1 m NaOH and radioactivity in the media samples and cell lysates were measured by scintillation counting. Cholesterol effluxed to the medium was calculated as a percentage of total radioactivity in the cell lysates and medium. Experiments were routinely performed in triplicate and repeated three times. The cholesterol acceptors used were apoA-I, apoE3, reconstituted apoE2, apoE3, and apoE4 discs (see below) and BV2 microglial cell-conditioned media. Unless stated otherwise all experiments using apoE discs contained the apoE3 isoform. Human apoA-I was purified from human high density lipoprotein by ultracentrifugation and anion exchange chromatography as previously described (42Glaros E.N. Kim W.S. Quinn C.M. Wong J. Gelissen I.

Recombinant human apoE2, apoE3, and apoE4 were prepared from Escherichia coli as previously described (43Morrow J.A. Arnold K.S. Weisgraber K.H.

Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 7346-7353Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). ApoE discs containing recombinant apoE, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleylphosphatidyl choline (POPC), and cholesterol were prepared using the cholate dialysis method and characterized as described previously (45Rye K.A. Bright R. Psaltis M. Barter P.J. J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 1025-1036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). ApoE discs had an average diameter of 17.0 nm as judged by gel filtration chromatography (45Rye K.A. Bright R. Psaltis M. Barter P.J. J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 1025-1036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The disc size and therefore apoE conformation resembles astrocyte-secreted apoE discs that are reported to have a mean diameter of 15.4 nm (33LaDu M.J. Gilligan S.M. Lukens J.R. Cabana V.G. Reardon C.A. Van Eldik L.J. Holtzman D.M. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2070-2081Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The POPC/cholesterol/apolipoprotein molar ratios of the apoE discs ranged from 114.7:12.8:1.0 to 94.4:8.4: 1.0. This stoichiometry indicates that our reconstituted apoE discs were phospholipid-enriched as compared with astrocyte-secreted apoE discs that have been reported to contain phospholipid/cholesterol ratios in the order of 2:1 to 1:2 (33LaDu M.J.

Attempts to prepare reconstituted apoE discs with equimolar POPC/cholesterol ratios were not successful resulting in a loss of discoidal structure. 4K.-A. Rye, unpublished observation. Nonetheless, the reconstituted apoE discs do resemble astrocyte-secreted discs and are more physiologically relevant than lipid-free apoE, which does not appear to be present in cerebral spinal fluid. All cholesterol acceptors were used at a concentration of 15 μg of protein/ml unless stated otherwise. Conditioned medium from microglial cells was prepared by culturing murine BV2 cells in 75-cm2 flasks with serum-free medium for 24 h. The conditioned medium was collected and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min and stored at 4 °C for up to 1 week until use. The concentration of apoE in BV2-conditioned medium was estimated by Western blot analysis using a rabbit anti-human apoE polyclonal antibody that cross-reacts with murine apoE (44Raftery M. Campbell R. Glaros E.N. Rye K.A. Halliday G.M. Jessup W. Garner B. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 7346-7353Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Western Blotting—Cells expressing ABCA1, ABCA2, ABCG1 (or stably expressing Myc-tagged ABCG1) or APP 695 were cultured in 6-well plates, rinsed with cold PBS, and lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and protease and phosphatase inhibitors). Bicinchoninic acid protein assays were performed on lysates and equal amounts of protein were separated on SDS-PAGE gels (12% for ABCG1, 6% for ABCA1, ABCA2, and APP) and transferred onto 0.45-μm nitrocellulose membranes at 100 volts for 30 min. Membranes were blocked overnight at 4 °C in PBS containing 5% nonfat dry milk and probed with the relevant antibodies to reveal the major bands at the appropriate molecular mass: ABCA1 250 kDa (Novus, rabbit polyclonal 1/1000), ABCA2 270 kDa (from Professor Kenneth Tew, rabbit polyclonal 1/1000), ABCG1 ∼60 kDa (ABCG1 Santa Cruz, rabbit polyclonal 1/200, ABCG1-Myc Invitrogen, murine monoclonal 1/5000), APP 90-kDa (Sigma, 6E10 monoclonal 1/2000) at 22 °C for 2 h. The membranes were washed three times in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (Dako, 1/2000) or rabbit anti-mouse (Dako, 1/1000) secondary antibody for 2 h. Signals were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences) and x-ray films. The signal intensity was quantified using NIH Image J software. Western blotting of secreted Aβ peptides was carried out as previously described (41White A.R. Du T. Laughton K.M. Volitakis I. Sharples R.A. Xilinas M.E. Hoke D.E. Holsinger R.M. Evin G. Cherny R.A.

Briefly, Aβ in the culture medium was separated on 10–20% Tris/Tricine gels or 12% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred onto 0.2-μm nitrocellulose membranes at 65 volts for 15 min. Membranes were boiled in Milli-Q H2O for 10 min, probed with anti-APP 6E10 monoclonal antibody followed by rabbit anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and ECL detection applied as described above. HPLC—Total lipids were extracted from cell culture medium containing [3H]cholesterol (and potential derivatives) by mixing 150 μl of culture medium, previously centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min to remove cellular debris, with 600 μl of methanol. To this was added 150 μl of chloroform and the mixture vortexed. To this was added 450 μl of Milli-Q H2O and the mixture vortexed and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 5 min. The upper aqueous phase was collected into a clean tube and 450 μl of methanol added to the infranatant. This mixture was mixed and centrifuged as above and the supernatant removed from the protein pellet and added to the tube containing the original aqueous upper phase. This extract (containing all polar and non-polar compounds but excluding proteins) was dried under vacuum and redissolved in 100 μl of methanol. Fifty μl of each sample was analyzed by reversed phase HPLC using a Supelcosil 250 × 4.6-mm C18 column (Supelco, Bellefonte, PA) and methanol mobile phase according to an established method (46Shan H. Pang J. Li S. Chiang T.B. Wilson W.K. Schroepfer Jr., G.J. Steroids. 2003; 68: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Fractions of 250 μl were collected from the column and [3H] levels of each fraction assessed by scintillation counting. The same HPLC method was used to analyze oxysterol standards with UV210 nm detection. Quantitative Real-time PCR—RNA was isolated from cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. All procedures were carried out using RNase-free reagents. Four μg of RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA as previously described (24Kim W.S. Guillemin G.J. Glaros E.N. Lim C.K. Garner B. Neuroreport. 2006; 17: 891-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). cDNA was used as a template in the quantitative real-time PCR assay, which was carried out using a Mastercycler ep realplex S (Eppendorf) and the fluorescent dye SYBR Green (Eppendorf), following the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, each reaction (20 μl) contained 1× RealMasterMix, 1× SYBR Green, 5 pmol of primers, and 1 μl of template. Amplification was carried out with 40 cycles of 94 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. All gene expression was normalized to β-actin, which served as an internal control for the quality of RNA isolated from each cell sample. Experiments were performed in triplicate and at least three samples were analyzed for each cell type. Conventional PCR amplification was also carried out with 30 cycles of denaturation (94 °C, 30 s), annealing (60 °C, 30 s), and extension (72 °C, 30 s), and the PCR products were visualized after electrophoresis in 1% agarose gels.

The role of the de-ubiquitinating enzymes AMSH and UBPY in endosomal trafficking of cargo proteins such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has only very recently been the subject of study and is already a matter of debate. Although one report (Mizuno, E., Iura, T., Mukai, A., Yoshimori, T., Kitamura, N., and Komada, M. (2005) Mol. Biol.

Here, we demonstrate that Usp8/UBPY, the mammalian ortholog of budding yeast Ubp4/Doa4, constitutively co-precipitates in a bivalent manner with the EGFR. Moreover, UBPY is a substrate for Src-family tyrosine kinases that are activated after ligand-induced EGFR activation. Using overexpression of three different recombinant dominant negative UBPY mutants (UBPY C748A mutant, UBPY 1–505, and UBPY 640–1080) in NIH3T3 and HEK293 cells, we demonstrate that UBPY affects both constitutive and ligand-induced (i) EGFR ubiquitination, (ii) EGFR expression levels, and (iii) the appearance of intermediate EGFR degradation products as well as (iv) downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase signal transduction. Our findings provide further evidence in favor of the model that UBPY-mediated EGFR de-ubiquitination promotes EGFR degradation.

(or ErbB1) is a member of the ErbB growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase family that is involved in the genesis of many human solid tumors (for review, see Refs. 1Olayioye M.A. Neve R.M. Lane H.A. Hynes N.E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3159-3167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 2Yarden Y. Sliwkowski M.X. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (5670) Google Scholar). EGFR activation leads to multiple downstream signaling events that control various cellular processes such as mitogenesis, cell survival, differentiation, and cell migration. These processes must be tightly regulated to prevent uncontrolled mitogenic signaling, cell survival, and cell migration, which may lead to tumor formation. The principal mechanism by which cells down-regulate activated receptors is by ligand-mediated endocytosis and subsequent delivery of the activated ligand-receptor complex to the lysosome for degradation (3Marmor M.D. Yarden Y. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2057-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 4Alwan H.A. van Zoelen E.J. van Leeuwen J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35781-35790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Targeting of cell-surface receptors to the lumen of the lysosome is a complex process that is tightly regulated by several protein complexes along distinct steps of the endocytic pathway (3Marmor M.D. Yarden Y. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2057-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 5Katzmann D.J. Odorizzi G. Emr S.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 893-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar). After ligand-induced dimerization of the EGFR, phosphorylated tyrosine residues in the C-terminal tail serve as docking sites for SH2 or PTB (phosphotyrosine binding) domain-containing proteins. The Cbl family of E3 ubiquitin ligases (6Thien C.B. Langdon W.Y. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 294-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar) is recruited to EGFR Tyr(P)-1045 through its variant SH2 domain (7Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Zamir E. Kam Z. Oved S. Langdon W.Y. Beguinot L. Geiger B. Yarden Y. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3663-3674Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). The activated EGFR is then internalized through clathrin-coated pits and transported to early endosomes after which cargo is sorted either to the recycling pathway or to the lysosome for degradation (for review, see Refs. 8Sorkin A. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: 729-738Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lysosomal targeting involves the delivery of cargo proteins to internal vesicles of late endosomes/multivesicular bodies (MVBs), which subsequently fuse with pre-existing lysosomes for subsequent degradation (5Katzmann D.J. Odorizzi G. Emr S.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 893-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar). Formation of MVBs is dependent on the evolutionary conserved vacuolar protein sorting (Vps) class E proteins including Hrs/Vps27, ESCRT-I, -II, and -III complexes, Vps31/Bro1/Alix, and the AAA-ATPase Vps4/SKD1 (5Katzmann D.J. Odorizzi G. Emr S.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 893-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence strongly support involvement of ubiquitin in the endosomal trafficking of cargo proteins, including sorting of cargo proteins at the trans-Golgi network, internalization of cargo proteins at the plasma-membrane, sorting of cargo proteins to the MVB pathway, and budding of retroviral particles at the plasma-membrane (9Hicke L. Dunn R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 141-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar). Indeed, many of the key players (e.g. Eps15, GGAs, Hrs, Vps23/TSG101, Vps36, Vps9 proteins) in the endocytic pathway contain ubiquitin-interacting domains that assist them in recognizing ubiquitinated cargo and/or endosomal adapter proteins (e.g. Eps15, CIN85) (9Hicke L. Dunn R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 141-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar). After agonist stimulation various activated protein-tyrosine kinases, including receptor-tyrosine kinases and Src-family kinases, are rapidly ubiquitinated by Cbl E3 ubiquitin ligases (6Thien C.B. Langdon W.Y. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 294-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Recruitment of Cbl to EGFR Tyr(P)-1045 leads to EGFR mono-ubiquitination on multiple lysines (referred to as multi-ubiquitination) (10Haglund K. Sigismund S. Polo S. Szymkiewicz I. Di Fiore P.P.

Recent data obtained with mass spectrometry suggest, however, that a significant fraction of the EGFR is modified with K63-linked poly-ubiquitin chains within the kinase domain (12Huang F.

Ubiquitinated cargo is then transferred to the ESCRT-I protein TSG101/Vps23, which interacts with ubiquitin through its catalytically inactive ubiquitin conjugating enzyme variant (UEV) domain (18Bishop N.

Although our studies were considered elsewhere, several groups have recently implicated the JAMM/MPN+ family member AMSH (associated molecule with the SH3 domain of Stan) and the ubiquitin-specific protease (Usp) family member Usp8/UBPY in regulation of EGFR ubiquitination and degradation, with conflicting conclusions. Although one report (25Mizuno E. Iura T. Mukai A. Yoshimori T. Kitamura N. Komada M. Mol. Biol.

Here, using overexpression of three different recombinant dominant negative UBPY mutants in NIH3T3 and HEK293 cells, we investigate the role of UBPY in EGFR ubiquitination and downstream signaling. Reagents—The following monoclonal (mAb) and polyclonal (pAb) antibodies were used in this study: anti-EGFR 528 mAb (used for immunoprecipitation (IP)) and anti-EGFR 1005 pAb (used for immunoblotting (IB) except when indicated) (Santa Cruz), anti-EGFR Ab-12 pAb (Neomarkers), anti-phosphotyrosine 4G10 mAb (Upstate Biotechnology), anti-ubiquitin pAb, and anti-FLAG M2 mAb (Sigma), anti-active (phospho-p44/p42) MAPK mAb (Cell Signaling), anti-GFP antibody (Santa Cruz), anti-GAPDH antibody (Abcam), as well as goat anti-rabbit (GARPO) and goat anti-mouse (GAMPO) mAbs linked to horseradish peroxidase (Signal Transduction Laboratories). Other reagents that were used in this study included protein A and protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences), PP2 Src kinase inhibitor, PD153035 EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (Calbiochem), Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), and mouse EGF (BD Bioscience).

Nolan (Stanford University Medical Center) through the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). DNA Manipulation and Plasmid Construction—pMe18s-FLAG-UBPY (corresponding to wild-type (wt) full-length mouse UBPY amino acids 1–1080) and pMe18s-FLAG-UBPY-dSB (UBPY lacking both N-terminal and C-terminal Hrs-binding protein (Hbp) SH3 binding (SB) motifs) were kindly provided by Dr. N. Kitamura (28Kato M. Miyazawa K. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37481-37487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). These constructs were used as the template to generate catalytically inactive FLAG-UBPY C748A and FLAG-UBPY-dSB-C748A. Wild-type and mutant UBPY cDNAs were then cloned into EcoR1 and SmaI sites of pEGFP-c2 vector to generate EGFP-UBPY wt, EGFP-UBPY-dSB, EGFP-UBPY-CA, and EGFP-UBPY-dSB-CA (Fig. 1). N-terminal and C-terminal deletion mutants were generated by amplifying individual domains of UBPY and subsequent cloning into EcoRI and SmaI sites of pEGFP-c2, which resulted in the following constructs: EGFP-Rhod (amino acids 1–504), EGFP-Rhod-dSB (amino acids 1–504 lacking the N-terminal SB motif), EGFP-Rhod-D140 (amino acids 140–504), EGFP-Rhod-dSB-D140 (amino acids 140–504 lacking the N-terminal SB motif), EGFP-Dub (amino acids 640–1080), EGFP-Dub-dSB (amino acids 640–1080 lacking the C-terminal SB motif), EGFP-Dub-CA (amino acids 640–1080 carrying the C748A mutation), and EGFP-Dub-dSB-CA (double mutant carrying both C-terminal dSB motif deletion and C748A mutation) (Fig. 1). The wild-type and C748A mutant of the Dub domain were also cloned into EcoRI and HindII sites of pZome-1N retroviral vector to generate protein A-tagged Dub domains. Finally, pMe18s-FLAG-UBPY constructs were digested with XhoI and SmaI to release UBPY sequence carrying the FLAG tag sequence and subsequently cloned into XhoI and SnaBI sites of pLZRS-IRES-GFP-PURO retroviral vector to create pLZRS-FLAG-UBPY-IRES-GFP constructs. All constructs and mutations were verified by nucleotide sequencing. Additional cloning strategies and primer sequences are available upon request. Cell Culture and Generation of Stable Cell Lines—HER-14 (NIH3T3 cells stably transfected with the human EGFR), human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293), and Phoenix cell lines were grown at 37 °C in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum. Transient transfection was performed using either calcium phosphate precipitation or Lipofectamine 2000 according to standard/manufacturer's instructions. HER-14 cells stably expressing FLAG-UBPY (wt and dSB) or vector control were generated by Lipofectamine transfection with pLZRS-FLAG-UBPY-IRES-GFP constructs followed by puromycin selection. Stable HER-14 cell lines expressing protein A-tagged Dub domains or vector control were generated by transfection of Phoenix cells with pZome-1N-Dub-wt and -Dub-CA constructs, isolation of recombinant retrovirus, and viral infection of HER-14 cells followed by puromycin selection according to standard protocols. Analysis of Proteins and Data Quantification—Cells were serum-starved 24 h post-transfection in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1% newborn calf serum plus 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 18 h before stimulation. Cells were stimulated with EGF (100 ng/ml) for 60 min unless specified otherwise. Cell lysis, immunoprecipitation, SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, and Western blotting was carried out as described previously (4Alwan H.A. van Zoelen E.J. van Leeuwen J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35781-35790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Signal quantification was performed with Photoshop software (Adobe systems). Briefly, mean pixel value was calculated for a predefined rectangle encompassing signal of interest after subtracting the background signal. Similar data calculation was carried out for loading control samples (e.g. GAPDH) as indicated in figure legends. The data plotted in the graphs represent mean pixel value (MPV) of signal of interest divided by the MPV of the loading control. In Vitro De-ubiquitination Assay—FLAG-UBPY wt, and FLAG-UBPY C748A mutant were each transfected in two 10-cm plates of NIH3T3 by means of Lipofectamine. Cells were harvested 24 h post-transfection. FLAG-UBPY was immunoprecipitated with M2 anti-FLAG antibody coupled to Prot-G beads for 1.5 h at 4 °C. After extensive washing, beads were then split into two fractions. One was treated with N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) and the other with carrier ethanol at room temperature; their concentrations were kept constant throughout the experiment. Four 10-cm dishes of HER-14 cells were serum-starved overnight. To induce ubiquitination of EGFR, cells were stimulated with 100 ng/ml EGF for 15 min. Cells were then lysed on ice, and immunoprecipitation of ubiquitinated EGFR was performed with anti-EGFR (clone 528) coupled to protein A beads at 4 °C for 1.5 h. Beads were then washed extensively in lysis buffer and split into two fractions. EGFR beads were then reconstituted in Dub buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA). EGFR immunoprecipitates were then combined with UBPY immunoprecipitates in a 100-μl final volume of Dub buffer. The de-ubiquitination reaction was initiated by incubating the bead mixtures at 37 °C for 90 min with regular mixing. Beads were then washed 3 times with Tris-buffered saline with Tween and twice with phosphate-buffered saline. Then, Laemmli sample buffer was added to the mixture and incubated at 100 °C for 3 min before loading on SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Tyrosine Phosphorylation of UBPY after EGFR Activation—Based on the function of the yeast de-ubiquitinating enzyme Doa4/Ubp4, we hypothesized that Usp8/UBPY, the mammalian ortholog of Doa4, might be involved in de-ubiquitination of the EGFR. UBPY is the only mammalian Dub enzyme that, like Doa4, contains a catalytically inactive Rhodanese-like homology domain (29Bordo D. Bork P. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 741-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). In addition, phylogenetic analysis of fungal and metazoan ubiquitin-specific protease enzymes reveals that fungal Ubp4/Ubp5 paralogs form a single clade with metazoan Usp8 orthologs. 3H. A. J. Alwan and J. E. M. van Leeuwen, unpublished results. To assess the role of UBPY in EGFR signaling and turnover, we first asked whether UBPY is tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to EGF treatment. As seen in Fig. 2A, a clear EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of FLAG-tagged UBPY was observed in NIH3T3 cells co-transfected with UBPY and EGFR, demonstrating that transfected UBPY is a substrate for EGF-activated protein-tyrosine kinases. It should be noted that EGFR activation is associated with a characteristic mobility shift, as seen in Fig. 2A (third panel). UBPY is known to interact with Hbp through the Hbp SH3 binding motifs of UBPY (at amino acid positions 405–413 (SB-N) and at amino acids 700–708 (SB-C)) (28Kato M. Miyazawa K. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37481-37487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). However, as shown in Fig. 2A, EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of FLAG-UBPY-dSB was similar compared with wild-type FLAG-UBPY, demonstrating that the Hbp SH3 binding motifs in UBPY are dispensable for UBPY tyrosine phosphorylation. UBPY contains a highly conserved active site cysteine (Cys-748) that is required for its enzymatic activity (30Naviglio S. Mattecucci C. Matoskova B. Nagase T. Nomura N. Di Fiore P.P. Draetta G.F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3241-3250Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2B, UBPY C748A contained similar levels of phosphotyrosine compared with wild-type UBPY, demonstrating that UBPY de-ubiquitination activity is also not required for its tyrosine phosphorylation. To unequivocally demonstrate that the tyrosine-phosphorylated protein detected in UBPY precipitates is UBPY itself and not a co-migrating protein, we generated EGFP fusion constructs of wild-type, N-terminal-truncated, and C-terminal-truncated UBPY proteins. HEK293 cells were co-transfected with UBPY wt, UBPY 1–504 (which will be referred to as the Rhod (Rhodanese) construct), or UBPY 640–1080 (which will be referred to as the “Dub” construct). As shown in Fig. 2C, EGF stimulation induced an EGFR-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of GFP-UBPY wt (155 kDa) and GFP-Rhod (85 kDa) but not of GFP-Dub even though it was efficiently expressed (middle panel) and its de-ubiquitinating enzyme activity was still intact (data not shown). These findings demonstrate that transfected UBPY itself undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation in response to EGFR activation and that the N-terminal Rhod but not the C-terminal Dub construct is sufficient for EGF-induced UBPY tyrosine phosphorylation. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 2D, we could also detect EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of endogenous UBPY (130 kDa), which was precipitated from HER-14 cells and detected by Western blot using the anti-UBPY W39 polyclonal antiserum (27Gnesutta N. Ceriani M. Innocenti M. Mauri I. Zippel R. Sturani E. Borgonovo B. Berruti G. Martegani E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39448-39454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Quantification of the UBPY phosphotyrosine signal showed that UBPY phosphorylation reached a maximum at 60 min after stimulation followed by a gradual decline until it reached near basal levels after 4 h of stimulation (Fig. 2E). Interestingly, a tyrosine-phosphorylated protein that co-migrates with the EGFR co-precipitated with endogenous UBPY (Fig. 2D, lanes 1–6), suggesting that UBPY associates with the EGFR. Collectively, these data demonstrate that (i) EGF induces UBPY tyrosine phosphorylation in an EGFR-dependent manner, (ii) UBPY is tyrosine-phosphorylated in its N-terminal half, and (iii) neither the Hbp SH3 binding motifs in the proline rich domain of UBPY nor the de-ubiquitination activity of UBPY is required for UBPY tyrosine phosphorylation. Inhibition of Src Kinases with PP2 Blocks UBPY Tyrosine Phosphorylation—To further test whether the kinase activity of the EGFR is required for UBPY tyrosine phosphorylation, we used the specific EGFR kinase inhibitor PD153035. The EGFR kinase inhibitor effectively blocked EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGFR and other downstream signaling molecules as seen on WCL (Fig. 3A, lower panel). Importantly, EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the immunoprecipitated EGFP-Rhod construct was completely blocked in the presence of PD153035 (Fig. 3A, top panel). A tyrosine-phosphorylated band of around 180 kDa, most probably the EGFR, co-precipitated with EGFP-Rhod and disappeared (as expected) upon PD153035 treatment. It is well known that Src-family tyrosine kinases are activated after EGFR activation (1Olayioye M.A. Neve R.M. Lane H.A. Hynes N.E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3159-3167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Tice D.A. Biscardi J.S. Nickles A.L. Parsons S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1415-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). To test whether Src-family tyrosine kinases may be responsible for UBPY tyrosine phosphorylation, we used the specific Src-family kinase inhibitor PP2. Significantly, EGF-induced GFP-Rhod tyrosine phosphorylation was reduced in a concentration-dependent manner by PP2 (Fig. 3, B, top panel, C). Complete inhibition of GFP-Rhod tyrosine phosphorylation was achieved with 5 μm PP2 (Fig. 3, B and C) even though tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGFR remained relatively unaffected (Fig. 3B, third panel). It should be noted that a slight decrease in EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation upon PP2 treatment is expected because the EGFR itself is a substrate for Src-family tyrosine kinases (31Tice D.A. Biscardi J.S. Nickles A.L. Parsons S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1415-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). These data demonstrate that UBPY is a substrate for Src-family tyrosine kinases and indicate that direct phosphorylation of UBPY by the EGFR kinase domain does not occur to a significant extent. UBPY Is Found in a Complex with the EGFR—The data illustrated in Figs. 2 and 3 suggest that the tyrosine-phosphorylated EGFR co-precipitates with transfected as well as endogenous UBPY proteins. Indeed, as shown by direct co-precipitation (Fig. 4A), FLAG-UBPY co-precipitated with the EGFR. FLAG-UBPY-dSB bound the EGFR to similar levels as the wild-type UBPY (Fig. 4A), demonstrating that the Hbp SH3 binding motifs are not required for formation of a complex between UBPY and EGFR in vivo. Interestingly, FLAG-UBPY C748A showed a 4-fold enhanced binding to the EGFR compared with wild-type UBPY (Fig. 4A). The enhanced binding of the UBPY C748A mutant to the EGFR suggests that the stability of the UBPY-EGFR complex is enhanced when the catalytic activity of UBPY is abolished, indicating substrate trapping characteristics of the UBPY C748A mutant. Similar results were obtained with GFP-tagged mutants of UBPY (data not shown). To determine whether complex formation of UBPY with the EGFR is dependent on its kinase activity, we transfected FLAG-UBPY C748A (because of its enhanced binding to the EGFR) together with EGFR in the presence or absence of the EGFR kinase inhibitor PD153035. UBPY binding to the EGFR remained unaffected when cells cultured in low serum were treated with PD153035 (Fig. 4B, top panel) despite the fact that the kinase inhibitor dramatically decreased the activation state of the EGFR (Fig. 4B, pTyr). We conclude that UBPY constitutively forms a complex with the EGFR in vivo through a mechanism that is independent of the Hbp SH3 binding motifs and independent of EGFR kinase activity. Furthermore, the enhanced binding of the catalytically inactive C748A mutant of UBPY to"

However, the mechanism(s) by which H2S affects cell growth and function have not been addressed adequately. In this study, cultured human lung fibroblasts were treated with the H2S donor NaHS (10-75 microM; 12-48 h). NaHS caused a concentration-dependent increase in micronuclei formation (indicating DNA damage) and cell cycle arrest (G1 phase). NaHS increased expression of ku 70 and ku 80 but did not affect the expression of other DNA repair proteins such as proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) or replication protein A (rNase protection assay). NaHS treatment also resulted in stabilization of p53 coupled with induction of downstream proteins such as p21, Bax, and cytochrome c, as well as translocation of Bax from the cytosol to the mitochondria and release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. NaHS did not up-regulate cell levels of the antiapoptotic protein, Bcl-2. We propose that the genotoxic action of H2S propels the cell toward apoptotic death triggered initially by stabilization of p53 and subsequently involving a cascade of downstream products. These results are of significance as they uncover a hitherto unknown and very fundamental role for H2S in determining cell fate."

Iron uptake from transferrin involves binding to its receptors followed by internalization to the early endosomes. (13Gunshin H. Mackenzie B. Berger U.V. Gunshin Y. Romero M.F. Boron W.F.

Although TfR-mediated iron uptake is the major pathway for iron acquisition, several studies have indicated that additional mechanisms independent of known TfRs exist; however, these have not been well characterized (15Chan R.Y.

However, recent evidence has proved that it functions as a moonlighting protein in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, often differentially localized within the cell (19Sirover M.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1432: 159-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar, 20Sirover M.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 2005; 95: 45-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 21Mazzola J.L. Sirover M.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1622: 50-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). It is of interest to note that in Staphylococcus aureus, cell wall-associated GAPDH had previously been identified as a transferrin-binding protein (22Modun B. Williams P. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 1086-1092Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Modun B. Morrissey J. Williams P. Trends Microbiol. 2000; 8: 231-237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, these findings have been contradicted by a more recent study (24Taylor J.M. Heinrichs D.E. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 1603-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), which demonstrated that S. aureus mutants lacking cell surface GAPDH retained the ability to bind transferrin to a level equivalent with that of the parent strain. Furthermore, when GAPDH was overexpressed and purified from the parent strain, it showed no affinity for human transferrin although it retained its enzymatic activity.With a goal to understand the role of this multifunctional protein in immune cells, we chose macrophages as a model system. In the current study we provide evidence that macrophages express a surface-localized GAPDH that is capable of interacting with the iron transport protein transferrin. In addition, our findings elaborate the trafficking of this GAPDH-transferrin complex to the early endosomes, indicating that cell surface GAPDH functions as a novel transferrin receptor.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMedia and Cell Lines—The mouse macrophage cell line J774A.1 and THP-1, a human monocytic cell line were obtained from ATCC and maintained in RPMI 1640 (Hi Media, India) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). For iron depletion experiments, cells were cultured in complete RPMI medium treated with Chelex 100 (Sigma) re-supplemented with other metal ions as described previously (22Modun B. Williams P. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 1086-1092Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Murine Macrophages—Thioglycollate-elicited macrophages were obtained from 6-8-week-old Balb/c mice using previously established procedures (25Mittal J. Dogra N. Dass R. Majumdar S. Folia Microbiol. (Praha). 2002; 47: 709-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) as approved by the institutional animal ethics committee. 2 × 106 cells were plated per well of 6-well plates and maintained for 48 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal calf serum. For iron depletion experiments, cells were similarly maintained in Chelex-treated medium.FACS Analysis—Cells were harvested using a rubber policeman and washed in FACS buffer (20 mm HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 m m MgCl2, 5 mm KCl, 0.02% NaN3, and 5% fetal calf serum). 2 × 105 cells were used per assay. Blocking was done by incubation on ice for 30 min using 100 μl of FACS buffer supplemented with 5% normal human serum and 5% normal goat serum. Cells were stained with 1.0 μg/tube of a commercial monoclonal anti-GAPDH antibody (Advanced Immunochemicals) alone or in the presence of excess (200 μg) free rabbit muscle GAPDH (Sigma), followed by incubation with Sheep anti-mouse-FITC (Fab)2 (Sigma). Cells were analyzed on a FACS Calibur Flow Cytometer.Pronase Sensitivity of Cell Surface GAPDH—To determine if the surface-expressed GAPDH was sensitive to the proteolytic enzyme Pronase, J774 cells were washed three times with neutral buffer (20 mm HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm KCl). Cells were then resuspended at a concentration of 2 × 105 cells/100 μl per tube. Subsequently either 100 μl of 4 mg/ml of Pronase (Roche Applied Science) or 100 μl of buffer (for negative controls) was added to the tubes. Cells were then incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in a water bath. Pronase digestion was terminated by the addition of 1 ml of chilled FACS buffer to each tube, followed by three washes at 4 °C.To check for the recovery of cell surface GAPDH expression after Pronase treatment, an aliquot of these cells was resuspended in fresh medium at 37 °C for 30 min. Cells were then blocked and stained for GAPDH expression by FACS analysis as described above.Western Blot Analysis of GAPDH—Cells were grown to confluence and harvested for membrane preparation. After three washes in neutral buffer, the pellet was frozen overnight at -20 °C. Membrane and cytosolic protein fractions were prepared as described previously (26Dass S.V. Raje M. Verma R. Mishra G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 270: 1-14Google Scholar). All samples were resolved using 10% SDS-PAGE. Rabbit muscle GAPDH (Sigma) was loaded along with the samples as a standard molecular mass marker (37 kDa), because it is almost identical (≥ 96% homology) to human and mouse GAPDH.In addition, proteins from conditioned medium were precipitated using chilled acetone and analyzed similarly. Protein samples were transblotted onto nitrocellulose membrane and then probed with monoclonal anti-GAPDH antibody, for 1 h at room temperature, followed by incubation with rabbit antimouse-HRP (Sigma). Blots were developed with TMB H2O2 for localization of HRP per the manufacturer's instructions (Bangalore Genei, India).Pre-embedding Immunogold Labeling Transmission Electron Microscopy—Confluent cultures of J774 cells were harvested and immunolabeled with monoclonal anti-GAPDH antibody as done for FACS assays. The cells were then incubated with goat anti-mouse gold conjugate (20 nm, Sigma) for 2 h on ice. After three washes, cells were pelleted, fixed, and embedded in epoxy resin. Ultrathin sections were cut, stained with 2% uranyl acetate, and observed using a JEOL 1200 EXII TEM.Scanning Electron Microscopy—J774 cells were grown on glass coverslips and fixed with 0.5% glutaraldehyde and 0.5% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Subsequently, cells were blocked with 0.1 m glycine followed by 2% casein in PBS. Incubation with monoclonal anti-GAPDH antibody was done in PBS containing 0.2% casein for 1 h. After washing exhaustively with PBS, cells were incubated with 0.145 μ polystyrene beads (Polysciences) conjugated with goat anti-mouse IgG (per the manufacturer's instructions) for 1 h at room temperature. Coverslips were processed, and cells were observed using a Leica Cambridge S-260 scanning electron microscope.Enzyme Activity of Surface GAPDH—J774 cells were grown to confluence in 6-well plates and incubated in normal medium or iron-depleted medium for 48 h. Subsequently, cells were washed three times with neutral buffer and assayed for cell surface GAPDH enzyme activity (22Modun B. Williams P. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 1086-1092Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated with, 2 mm glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (Sigma) (the specific substrate for GAPDH) and 1 mm NAD+ (Roche Applied Science) in 1.0 ml of neutral buffer at 37 °C for 1 h. GAPDH enzyme activity was detected by the formation of NADH in the supernatant, measured by an increase in absorbance at 340 nm. As a negative control for the assay, the substrate glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate was eliminated from the reaction mixture to verify the specificity of the reaction. Identical experiments were carried out using mouse peritoneal macrophages.Colocalization of GAPDH and Transferrin on Cell Surface—J774 and THP-1 cells were cultured in Lab Tek Chambered coverglass. Cells were washed and blocked as for FACS staining. Subsequently, cells were stained in situ with 2 μg/ml monoclonal anti-GAPDH antibody followed by anti-mouse-Alexa-488 (Molecular Probes) and 5 μg/ml transferrin-TRITC (Molecular Probes). Cells were washed and fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde and imaged using a Zeiss LSM 510 META Laser Confocal Microscope using a ×63 oil immersion objective and an aperture of 1 Airy unit.In Vitro Interaction of GAPDH-Transferrin by ELISA—Polystyrene wells were coated overnight at 4 °C using 350 pmol/well of rabbit muscle GAPDH in PBS and blocked using 5% BSA (Pierce) for 24 h at 4 °C. Wells were then incubated with 2.5 nm of human holo-transferrin (Sigma), in PBST containing 0.5% BSA for 6 h at 4 °C. After extensive washing bound transferrin was detected by incubation with rabbit anti-transferrin antibody (Polysciences) followed by goat anti-rabbit-HRP (Sigma). TMB H2O2 for ELISA (Bangalore Genei, India) was used to develop the reaction. The absorbance was measured at 450 nm. As a positive control for transferrin a set of wells had been coated with transferrin alone, which was detected using rabbit-anti-transferrin antibody. Controls were also set up in the assay to determine the nonspecific interaction of (i) anti-transferrin antibody with GAPDH, (ii) anti-transferrin antibody with BSA, (iii) transferrin with BSA, (iv) secondary antibody with GAPDH, and (v) secondary antibody with BSA. Each set consisted of eight wells in replicates.In Vitro Interaction of GAPDH-Transferrin by Dot Blot—Dot blot assay was carried out as described previously (22Modun B. Williams P. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 1086-1092Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, rabbit muscle GAPDH in PBS was spotted on nitrocellulose membrane (350 pmol/spot). Membranes were washed with PBST and blocked using 5% BSA for 24 h at 4 °C. Blots were then incubated with 6.25 nm human holotransferrin in PBST containing 0.5% BSA for 6 h at 4 °C. Bound transferrin was detected by incubation with rabbit anti-transferrin antibody followed by incubation with goat anti-rabbit-HRP. Blots were developed using TMB H2O2 for localization of HRP.Co-immunoprecipitation of GAPDH-Transferrin from Cell Membranes—J774 cells were harvested from confluent cultures and washed three times with FACS buffer. 2 × 107 cells per tube were incubated with 12.5 nm human transferrin for 1 h on ice. Cells were washed and processed for preparation of the membrane protein fraction, as for the Western blot analysis. Co-immunoprecipitation was done from this fraction using anti-transferrin antibody followed by capture with Protein A Magnabeads (Polysciences) per the manufacturer's instructions. The reverse experiment was also performed, wherein the membrane protein fraction was incubated with monoclonal anti-GAPDH antibody followed by capture with goat anti-mouse Magnabeads (Polysciences). Beads were boiled in sample buffer, and eluted proteins were analyzed by Western blot as described previously. Blots were probed with monoclonal anti-GAPDH antibody or anti-transferrin antibody, respectively.FRET Analysis—J774 cells were maintained and processed as for colocalization studies described above. Cells were immunostained with monoclonal anti-GAPDH followed by anti-mouse-Alexa-633 (Molecular Probes) and Transferrin-FITC (Sigma). As a control, anti-IAd (BD Biosciences) was used in place of anti-GAPDH. Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments were carried out using the acceptor photobleaching method (27Kenworthy K. Methods. 2001; 24: 289Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar).Analysis of Protein-Protein Interactions using Resonant Mirror Technology—Binary Interaction Analysis: association and dissociation between transferrin and GAPDH were followed in real time by Resonant Mirror-based detection using IAsys Plus™ system (Cambridge, UK). Experimental procedure was essentially as described previously (28Dhar J. Pande A.H. Sundram V. Nanda J.S. Mande S.C. Sahni G. J. Biol.

This was followed by the attachment of biotinylated transferrin to the streptavidin, which was then allowed to interact with varying concentrations of GAPDH. Data were analyzed using the FASTfit™ software, supplied by the manufacturer.Cell Surface GAPDH-Transferrin Is Internalized to Early Endosome in Live Cells—J774 and THP-1 cells were cultured in Lab Tek Chambered coverglass. Cells were washed with FACS buffer, blocked, and stained for transferrin and GAPDH as described previously for colocalization experiments. To initiate endocytosis cells were rinsed three times with culture medium and maintained at 37 °C for 5 min, using a heating block along with the addition of pre-warmed medium. Endocytosis was arrested by rapidly bringing down the temperature to 4 °C, by replacing the existing medium with chilled buffer. Cells were washed and immediately fixed using 1% paraformaldehyde and 1% glutaraldehyde. Imaging was done using a Zeiss LSM 510 META Laser Confocal Microscope as described previously.Immunoprecipitation of Biotinylated GAPDH from Early Endosome Confirms Its Cell Surface Origin—J774 cells were harvested and washed three times with neutral buffer. Surface proteins were biotinylated by incubation with sulfo-SS-NHS biotin (Pierce) per the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were washed with neutral buffer and transferrin was added at a final concentration of 12.5 nm for 2 h on ice. Excess transferrin was removed by washing and endocytosis was allowed to proceed as described above. The early endosomal fraction was prepared based on previously described methods (30Diaz R. Mayorga L. Stahl P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6093-6100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Laurent O. Bruckert F. Adessi C. Satre M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 793-799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed and resuspended in homogenization buffer (250 mm sucrose, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2) containing protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml antipain) and 0.5 mm EDTA. The cells were then homogenized by 15 passages through a 27-gauge needle fitted on a 1-ml plastic syringe. The homogenate was centrifuged at 800 × g, 10 min at 4 °C, the postnuclear supernatant (PNS) obtained was rapidly frozen using liquid nitrogen and stored at -70 °C. To prepare the enriched endosomal fraction, 3.0 ml of the PNS was rapidly thawed and loaded onto a discontinuous sucrose gradient formed by layering 1 ml of 54%, 4 ml of 40%, and 4 ml of 30% sucrose (w/v) in homogenization buffer. After centrifugation at 100,000 × g, 1 h at 4 °C, the early endosomal fraction was isolated from the 30% interface of the gradient. The endosomes were pelleted at 50,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and proteins were extracted as described previously (26Dass S.V. Raje M. Verma R. Mishra G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 270: 1-14Google Scholar). The presence of transferrin and GAPDH in the extract was confirmed by Western blot analysis. Subsequently for immunoprecipitation experiments the protein fraction was incubated with monoclonal anti-GAPDH and anti-mouse Magnabeads, overnight at 4 °C on a rotamixer. The beads were then washed and boiled in sample buffer in the absence of reducing agents. Eluted proteins were analyzed for the presence of biotinylated GAPDH by Western blot analysis using streptavidin-HRP (Bangalore Genei, India) as a probe.Analysis of Purified Endosomes using Immuno-EM Demonstrates Internalization of the Surface GAPDH and Transferrin—J774 cells were incubated with transferrin followed by immunolabeling with monoclonal anti-GAPDH and rabbit anti-transferrin antibody at 4 °C for 1 h to allow cell surface binding. Subsequently, cells were washed and endocytosis was allowed to proceed as described above. This was done to allow internalization of surface GAPDH and transferrin along with bound primary antibodies. Early endosomes were then purified and resuspended in a minimal volume of homogenization buffer. Purified endosomes were adsorbed onto carbon coated nickel grids and processed for immunolabeling using the negative staining technique. Blocking was carried out for 1 h using 2% casein with 1% fish skin gelatin in neutral buffer. To detect internalized GAPDH and transferrin, samples were immunostained using goat anti-mouse 20-nm gold conjugate (Sigma) along with goat anti-rabbit 6-nm gold conjugate (Polysciences) as described previously (32Mukherjee K. Siddiqi S.A. Hashim S. Raje M. Basu S.K. Mukhopadhyay A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 741-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).RESULTSGAPDH Is Expressed on the Surface of Macrophage Membrane—The mouse macrophage cell line J774 and the human monocytic cell line THP-1 were stained with monoclonal anti-GAPDH antibody. FACS analysis demonstrated that both these cell lines express GAPDH on the membrane surface. The specificity of this staining was validated by the observation that free rabbit muscle GAPDH inhibits the binding of anti-GAPDH to cells (Fig. 1, A and B). The cell surface GAPDH was found to be sensitive to digestion by Pronase, a nonspecific proteolytic enzyme (Fig. 1E). After 30 min of incubation in fresh medium the GAPDH on the cell surface begins to show signs of recovery.To confirm that GAPDH is associated with the membrane of these cells, we prepared membrane protein preparations, cytosol fractions, and conditioned medium from both J774 and THP-1 cell lines. We subjected these samples to Western blot analysis using rabbit muscle GAPDH as a positive control. The functional enzyme is known to be a homotetramer composed of 37-kDa subunits; it was found that the molecular weight of membrane GAPDH was identical to the cytosolic form as well as to standard rabbit muscle GAPDH. In addition, we also detected this protein in conditioned medium (Fig. 1, C and D). The presence of GAPDH on the outer surface of intact J774 cell membranes was further confirmed by immunolabeling followed by transmission and scanning electron microscopy (Fig. 1, F and G). Unlike the two cell lines tested, thioglycollate-elicited mouse peritoneal macrophages did not show any significant surface expression of GAPDH on FACS analysis (Fig. 2B).FIGURE 2Murine macrophages express a cell surface, enzymatically functional form of GAPDH that is sensitive to the availability of iron. A, J774 cells were cultured for 48 h in normal medium (gray-filled) or iron-depleted medium (black line) and stained with monoclonal anti-GAPDH antibody. B, mouse peritoneal macrophages were cultured for 48 h in normal medium (gray-filled) or iron-depleted medium (black line), and stained with monoclonal anti-GAPDH antibody. Isotype controls are indicated by dashed lines. C, J774 cells cultured in normal medium express enzymatically active surface GAPDH. Cells cultured for 48 h in iron-depleted medium showed an increase in the surface enzyme activity. D, mouse peritoneal macrophages cultured in normal medium express low levels of surface GAPDH enzyme activity. A significant increase in enzyme activity was observed after culturing these cells for 48 h in iron-depleted medium.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Surface GAPDH Expression Is Modulated by Availability of Iron in the Culture Medium—To establish whether this surface expression is regulated by the presence of iron in the culture medium, mouse peritoneal macrophages, and J774 cells were cultured for 48 h under conditions of iron depletion and analyzed for surface GAPDH expression by flow cytometry. The expression of surface GAPDH on J774 cells was found to be significantly enhanced upon culture in iron-depleted medium (Fig. 2A). More significantly, mouse peritoneal macrophages that initially did not show any surface GAPDH by FACS analysis, were now found to express this molecule on the membrane surface (Fig. 2B). No increase in surface GAPDH expression was observed in control experiments where cells were cultured in Chelex-treated medium re-supplemented with iron (data not shown).The Surface-expressed GAPDH Is Enzymatically Active—To determine whether surface GAPDH is present in its enzymatically functional form, we assayed intact J774 cells for GAPDH specific enzyme activity. It was found that the GAPDH present was an enzymatically active molecule that was capable of converting NAD to NADH in the presence of its specific substrate glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (Fig. 2C). This enzyme activity was also seen to increase substantially upon culturing the cells in iron-depleted media for 48 h (Fig. 2C). We also assayed mouse peritoneal macrophages under identical conditions. Although no GAPDH expression was detected on the surface of mouse peritoneal macrophages by FACS staining, the cell surface enzyme assay demonstrated a minimal level of GAPDH expression (Fig. 2D). In addition an increase in surface enzyme activity was observed upon culture of these cells in iron-depleted media comparable to that of J774 cells under similar culture conditions (Fig. 2, C and D). The observed increase in cell surface enzyme activity in both the cell lines and peritoneal macrophages correlates well with the observed increase in GAPDH surface staining as determined by FACS analysis.In Vitro Interaction of GAPDH with Transferrin—The observation that cell surface GAPDH levels are sensitive to iron in the culture medium indicates that it may be playing a role in iron acquisition, with this in mind we tested its ability to interact with the iron carrier protein transferrin. To establish whether mammalian GAPDH interacts with human holo-transferrin, we set up dot blot as well as ELISA based capture assays. Rabbit muscle GAPDH was coated on nitrocellulose membrane as well as in ELISA wells, followed by incubation with transferrin. Captured transferrin was subsequently detected using anti-transferrin antibody. Binding of transferrin to these coated wells was specific as compared with the control wells, indicating that GAPDH and transferrin interact under in vitro conditions (Fig. 3A). Transferrin capture by GAPDH was also detected in the dot blot assay (Fig. 3B).FIGURE 3GAPDH interacts with transferrin both in vitro and in vivo. A and B, transferrin binds to immobilized GAPDH in vitro. Transferrin was specifically captured by GAPDH immobilized in polystyrene wells as well as on nitrocellulose membrane. C, to demonstrate the interaction in vivo, J774 cells were incubated with transferrin. The membrane protein fraction was prepared and subjected to co-immunoprecipitation using anti-transferrin antibody, interaction with GAPDH was confirmed by Western blot using monoclonal anti-GAPDH.

https://openalex.org/W2117661271,"Mammalian cells require extracellular calcium ion to undergo rapid plasma membrane repair seconds after mechanical damage. Utilizing transformed fibroblasts from calpain small subunit knock-out (Capns1-/-) mouse embryos, we now show that the heterodimeric, typical subclass of calpains is required for calcium-mediated survival after plasma membrane damage caused by scraping a cell monolayer. Survival of scrape-damaged Capns1-/- cells was unaffected by calcium in the scraping medium, whereas more Capns1+/+ cells survived when calcium was present. Calcium-mediated survival was increased when Capns1-/- cells were scraped in the presence of purified m- or μ-calpain. Survival rates of scraped Capns1+/+, HFL-1, or Chinese hamster ovary cells were decreased by the calpain inhibitor, calpeptin, or the highly specific calpain inhibitor protein, calpastatin. Capns1-/- cells failed to reseal following laser-induced membrane disruption, demonstrating that their decreased survival after scraping resulted, at least in part, from failed membrane repair. Proteomic and immunologic analyses demonstrated that the known calpain substrates talin and vimentin were exposed at the cell surface and processed by calpain following cell scraping. Autoproteolytic activation of calpain at the scrape site was evident at the earliest time point analyzed and appeared to precede proteolysis of talin and vimentin. The results indicate that conventional calpains are required for calcium-facilitated survival after plasma membrane damage and may act by localized remodeling of the cortical cytoskeleton at the injury site.

The results indicate that conventional calpains are required for calcium-facilitated survival after plasma membrane damage and may act by localized remodeling of the cortical cytoskeleton at the injury site. Cells in multicellular organisms are constantly exposed to mechanical stresses and must repair plasma membrane breaks to survive (1McNeil P.L. Kirchhausen T. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 499-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 2McNeil P.L. Steinhardt R.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 697-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Sustained breaks in the plasma membrane lead to loss of intracellular contents and necrotic cell death (3Walker N.I. Harmon B.V. Gobe G.C. Kerr J.F. Methods Achiev. Exp.

Calcium entry through a disruption triggers intracellular vesicles to fuse homotypically with each other, creating a “patch” (5McNeil P.L. Miyake K. Vogel S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4592-4597Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). This multivesicle patch is then thought to rapidly fuse with the plasma membrane by a presently unknown mechanism to restore membrane integrity. It has been demonstrated that repair of breaks in skeletal muscle sarcolemma require the calcium and phospholipid-binding protein, dysferlin (6Bansal D. Campbell K.P. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 206-213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Loss-of-function mutations of the latter are responsible for limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B (7Richard I. Broux O. Allamand V. Fougerousse F. Chiannilkulchai N. Bourg N. Brenguier L. Devaud C. Pasturaud P. Roudaut C. Hillaire D. Passos-Bueno M.R. Zatz M. Tischfield J.A. Fardeau M. Jackson C.E. Cohen D. Beckmann J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 27-40Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar). Inability of dysferlin-negative muscle fibers to undergo routine repair of sarcolemma disruption, it is hypothesized, leads to the muscle wasting observed in limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B patients. More recently, the calcium and phospholipid-binding protein annexin-A1 has been shown to accumulate at plasma membrane injury sites in BSC-1 and HeLa cells, where it may initiate fusion events (8McNeil A.K. Rescher U. Gerke V. McNeil P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3502-35207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Given the importance of extracellular calcium in membrane repair, it is conceivable that other calcium and phospholipid-binding proteins, including calpain proteinases, could be involved in this process. In fact, previous studies have indicated that calpain activity is required for the calcium-stimulated healing of transected invertebrate giant axons (9Godell C.M. Smyers M.E. Eddleman C.S. Ballinger M.L. Fishman H.M. Bittner G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4751-4756Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and neurites of differentiated PC12 cells (10Yoo S. Nguyen M.P. Fukuda M. Bittner G.D. Fishman H.M. J. Neurosci. Res. 2003; 74: 541-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, the slow resealing response in the neuronal processes (minutes) would not be likely to salvage a significant fraction of cells injured directly on the cell body and may differ mechanistically from the much faster response of fibroblasts and other cells (seconds) in resealing membrane disruptions.Calpains are nonlysosomal, cysteine proteinases found in all animal cells. There are 14 calpain gene family members represented in the human genome (11Goll D.E. Thompson V.F. Li H. Wei W. Cong J. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 731-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2329) Google Scholar). Dysfunction of calpain-3 in humans leads to limb girdle muscular dystrophy 2A (7Richard I. Broux O. Allamand V. Fougerousse F. Chiannilkulchai N. Bourg N. Brenguier L. Devaud C. Pasturaud P. Roudaut C. Hillaire D. Passos-Bueno M.R. Zatz M. Tischfield J.A. Fardeau M. Jackson C.E. Cohen D. Beckmann J.S.

Chem. 1998; 273: 17073-17078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The calpain gene family can be subdivided into typical calpains (containing domain IV, composed of multiple EF-hand calcium binding motifs) and atypical calpains. The most abundant calpains in most tissues are the typical μ- and m-calpains (also called calpain-1 and -2, respectively). Both are heterodimers composed of catalytic large subunits and a small, noncatalytic subunit that is required for expression of proteinase activity. The Capns1 gene (also called Capn4) encodes the calpain small subunit. Both calpains require calcium ion for activity in vitro. However, their calcium affinities differ considerably. The μ-calpain isozyme requires ∼5–50 μm calcium ion for half-maximum activity in vitro, whereas m-calpain requires ∼200–800 μm calcium (11Goll D.E. Thompson V.F. Li H. Wei W. Cong J. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 731-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2329) Google Scholar). Because of its high calcium requirement, it is difficult to envision an intracellular role for m-calpain. It has been reported that m-calpain is converted to a calcium-independent form by epidermal growth factor receptor-dependent phosphorylation (13Glading A. Bodnar R.J. Reynolds I.J. Shiraha H. Satish L. Potter D.A. Blair H.C. Wells A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2499-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Exposure to extracellular calcium concentrations would potently activate m-calpain. However, there have been few published reports of its presence in the extracellular space (14Fukui I. Tanaka K. Murachi T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 162: 559-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 15Yamamoto S. Shimizu K. Suzuki K. Nakagawa Y. Yamamuro T.

Cell Res. 1997; 235: 385-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar).Purified m- and μ-calpains catalyze proteolysis of many proteins. Physiologic substrates have been difficult to define, but cytoskeletal proteins have emerged over the years as likely targets for calpain in cells (17Dayton W.R. Reville W.J. Goll D.E. Stromer M.H. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 2159-2167Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 18Wang K.K.W. Yuen P.-W. Wang K.K.W. Yuen P-W. Calpains: Pharmacology and Toxicology of Calcium-Dependent Protease. Taylor and Francis, Philadelphia1999: 77-101Google Scholar). Recently, talin has been identified as a physiologic calpain substrate. Talin is an important regulator of integrin function and actin cytoskeleton remodeling during formation of attachment plaques (19Nayal A. Webb D.J. Horwitz A.F. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 94-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Its proteolytic modification by calpains to produce a 190-kDa fragment is important in regulating deadhesion from the substratum during fibroblast migration (20Franco S.J. Rodgers M.A. Perrin B.J. Han J. Bennin D.A. Critchley D.R. Huttenlocher A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 977-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). The 190-kDa fragment was not detected in protein immunoblots of lysed primary fibroblasts from Capns1-/- mouse embryos (21Dourdin N. Bhatt A.K. Dutt P. Greer P.A. Arthur J.S. Elce J.S. Huttenlocher A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48382-48388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), and these cells did not migrate as rapidly as wild-type fibroblasts. The defective deadhesion and migration are thought to derive from differences in cortical cytoskeletal remodeling, especially in formation and disassembly of adhesion plaques. It has been suggested that calpain-mediated cleavage of talin may be necessary for adhesion plaque disassembly (21Dourdin N. Bhatt A.K. Dutt P. Greer P.A. Arthur J.S. Elce J.S. Huttenlocher A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48382-48388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar).Cytoskeletal remodeling is important in the mechanism for patching wounded plasma membrane (22Miyake K. McNeil P.L. Suzuki K. Tsunoda R. Sugai N. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3487-3494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and exposure to extracellular calcium concentrations upon membrane disruption would favor activation of intracellular calpains, especially m-calpain. We here show, using loss of function (including Capns1-null cells) and gain of function models, that calcium-mediated membrane repair depends upon activation of the typical calpains. We have also begun to identify candidate proteolytic substrates of wound-activated calpains.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—SV40T 2The abbreviations used are: SV40T, simian virus 40 large T-antigen; FBS, fetal bovine serum; FDx, fluorescein-labeled dextran; MTT, methylthiotetrazole; MPB, maleimide-PEO2-biotin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. -transformed mouse Capns1-/- and Capns1+/+ fibroblasts were kindly provided by Drs. John Elce and Peter Greer (Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada). The thiol-reactive biotinylation reagent, maleimide-PEO2-biotin (MPB) was obtained from Pierce (catalog number 21902). Commercial antibodies included 8d4 anti-talin mouse monoclonal and goat polyclonal anti-vimentin, obtained from Sigma. Anti-β1-integrin mouse monoclonal was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (catalog number sc-8978). Mouse monoclonal antibodies against bovine calpain small subunit and human calpastatin were prepared in house and have been previously described (23Zhang W. Lane R.D. Mellgren R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18825-18830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Chicken antibody against rat m-calpain was a gift from Dr. Kevin Wang (University of Florida).Cell Culture—SV40T-transformed mouse fibroblasts were routinely cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FBS. Neonatal cardiac myocytes, isolated as previously described (24Peng M. Huang L. Xie Z. Huang W.H. Askari A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10372-10378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), were cultured in 4:1 Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/M199 medium without serum. Human skin fibroblasts (ATCC CRL 1782) and HFL1 human lung fibroblasts (ATCC CRL153) were cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium containing 10% FBS. EcR-Chinese hamster ovary cells conditionally expressing full-length human large calpastatin (25Xu Y. Mellgren R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21474-21479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) were routinely cultured in Ham's F-12 medium containing 10% FBS. Calpastatin expression was induced, where indicated, by 5 μm ponasterone A in the same medium. For the cell scraping protocol, cells were usually grown in 12-well plates to ∼70–90% confluence. For biotinylation and isolation of cell surface proteins from scraped cells, fibroblasts were cultured in 150-mm dishes.Laser Injury—Cells cultured in 35-mm dishes were subjected to laser wounding at 37 °C in the presence of FM1-43 dye. Dye uptake was monitored by time lapse image acquisition and image analysis as previously described (22Miyake K. McNeil P.L. Suzuki K. Tsunoda R. Sugai N. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3487-3494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Scrape Injury—Culture medium was removed by aspiration and replaced with 100 μl of Dulbecco's PBS containing 5.6 mm glucose and 0.33 mm pyruvate, pH 7.0 (scraping buffer), prewarmed to 37 °C. For most experiments, the scraping buffer contained either 2 mm calcium acetate (Ca2+), or 2 mm calcium acetate and 5 mm EGTA (Ca2+/EGTA). The latter buffer results in a free calcium ion concentration of about 10-8 to 10-7 m, approximating basal free calcium levels in most cells. Cells were immediately scraped with a sterile plastic cell scraper (Corning Costar catalog number 3010) for seven passes over a period of ∼3 s. Further handling of the scraped cells depended on the experiment and will be discussed in the appropriate sections below. To assess the effect of the calpain inhibitor, calpeptin, on survival, the cells were preincubated with calpeptin for 30 min to 1 h before scraping, and calpeptin was also included in the scraping buffer.Immunodetection of Vimentin on the Surface of Scratched, Resealed Cells—BSC-1 renal epithelial cells, a model cell type for investigating scrape injury of monolayers (26Pawar S. Kartha S. Toback F.G. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 165: 556-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), were scratched in the presence of FDx as previously described (22Miyake K. McNeil P.L. Suzuki K. Tsunoda R. Sugai N. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3487-3494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were plated on sterile coverslips and allowed to attach overnight. The cell monolayer was scratched at 37 °C with a sterile 18-gauge needle in the presence of FDx in scraping buffer and washed with ice-cold scraping buffer after 30 s to remove FDx. The cells were fixed without permeabilizing and immunostained with goat anti-human vimentin, followed by rhodamine isothiocyanate-labeled anti-goat second antibody. FDx retention in re-sealed cells, and vimentin surface labeling were determined by fluorescence microscopy.Cell Viability—Routinely, viability after cell scraping was assessed by the spectrophotometric MTT reductase method, employing an absorption wavelength of 590 nm (27Mosmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (45542) Google Scholar). Cells were scraped as described above and incubated in scraping buffer for various times at 37 °C. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FBS was added, and the cells were cultured for 4–12 h before MTT reductase measurement. In many different experiments, variation within this 4–12-h interval did not significantly affect the recovery of Capns1+/+ or Capns1-/- fibroblast viability. Microscopic inspection of cultures prior to the MTT assay affirmed that the variation in color was associated with increase or decrease of cell number and not relative cellular content of MTT reductase. Nevertheless, to formally verify the suitability of the MTT assay to assess viability within the parameters of our studies, a clonal survival assay was carried out (Fig. 1B). The percentage of cell survival was calculated as the A590 value of scraped cell assays divided by the A590 of nonscraped cells from the same culture plate multiplied by 100.Biotinylation and Subsequent Affinity Isolation of Cell Surface Proteins—Fibroblasts grown in 150-mm dishes were scraped in 1.0 ml of scraping buffer with or without additions, using a large cell scraper (Corning Costar catalog number 3011). At various times thereafter, a freshly prepared aqueous solution of MPB obtained from Pierce was added to a concentration of 2 mm, and the samples were immediately placed on ice. The maleimide functional moiety of MPB is expected to react with the normally reduced Cys side chains of intracellular proteins exposed at membrane tears. Unless otherwise stated, all further steps were at 4–7 °C. After 60 min, dithiothreitol was added to 20 mm to quench unreacted MPB, followed by a further 10-min incubation. To remove cell debris, the cells were washed by centrifugation three times at 200 × g for 2 min in 1.5 ml of scraping buffer containing calcium. In some experiments, the first 200 × g supernatant was saved for preparation of a 200–21,000 × g pellet membrane fragment fraction. The washed cells were resuspended in 1 ml of PBS, SDS was added to 0.2%, and the samples were heated to 60 °C for 5 min. Triton X-100 was added to 1%, and the lysates were left refrigerated overnight. The lysates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min, and 50 μl of UltraLink Neutravidin Plus® gel (Pierce) was added to the resultant supernatants (∼1 ml). The gel slurries were rotated in the cold for 4 h to allow adsorption of biotinylated proteins. The gels were collected by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 1 min and washed with 1.5 ml of PBS containing 0.1% SDS and 1% Triton X-100. After four more washes with PBS containing 1% Triton X-100, the gel beads were resuspended in 150 μlof3× diluted SDS-sample buffer (Invitrogen) and heated to 70 °C for 20 min. The gels were removed by centrifugation, and the proteins extracted in the SDS-sample buffer were employed in gel electrophoresis and protein immunoblotting studies. Nonscraped control cells were carried through all steps of the above protocol, except that they were not scraped before placing on ice. Instead, they were scraped in the cold 10 min after the addition of dithiothreitol to quench MPB.Electrophoresis and Protein Immunoblotting—Samples were electrophoresed in Invitrogen precast 10% polyacrylamide gels and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose. Except where otherwise indicated, a volume equivalent to 10% of the total sample was loaded on the gel. Therefore, each isolated cell fraction was normalized with respect to total cell number in the experiment.An antibody was produced that recognizes vimentin only after cleavage by calpain. Rabbits were immunized against the short peptide SSVPGVC coupled through the carboxyl-terminal Cys to BSA. This peptide corresponds to the amino terminus of the major fragment of vimentin generated by cleavage with calpain (28Fischer S. Vandekerckhove J. Ampe C. Traub P. Weber K. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1986; 367: 1147-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and is conserved in mouse and human vimentin. The antibody only recognized cleaved vimentin and detected the predicted 46-kDa fragment on immunoblot analysis (supplemental Fig. S1). Because it is not produced by cleavage after an aspartyl residue, the calpain-specific cleavage site should not be a good substrate for caspases, and indeed it is not a known primary caspase cleavage site in vimentin (29Byun Y. Chen F. Chang R. Trivedi M. Green K.J. Cryns V.L. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Moreover, the antibody did not recognize vimentin fragments generated by proteasome, the other major cytosolic protease in animal cells, or by the model cysteine protease ficin (supplemental Fig. S1). A trace of the 46-kDa fragment was detectable after cleavage with clostripain, another cysteine protease, but only at the 5 min digestion time point. In contrast, calpain cleavage generated a relatively stable fragment that was evident after 50 min of digestion. Hence, the generation of the stable 46-kDa vimentin fragment appears to be a good marker for calpain-mediated degradation of vimentin.Proteomic Analysis—Approximately 10 μg of biotinylated protein isolated from 1-min scraped Capns1-/- fibroblasts was subjected to SDS-PAGE and colloidal Coomassie Blue staining. Bands were cut from the gel and digested with sequencing grade, modified trypsin (Promega) overnight at 37 °C. Peptides were extracted with 60% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and concentrated to ∼15 μl using a vacuum centrifuge. A 2-μl aliquot of the sample was separated on a reverse phase column (75-μm inner diameter × 5 cm × 15 μm Aquasil C18 Picofrit column; New Objectives). The eluent was directly introduced into an ion trap mass spectrometer (LCQ-Deca XP Plus; Finnigan) equipped with a nanospray source. The mass spectrometer was operated on a double play mode where the instrument was set to acquire a full MS scan (400–2000 m/z) and a collision-induced dissociation spectrum on the most abundant ion from the full MS scan. Collision-induced dissociation spectra were either manually interpreted or searched against an appropriate nonredundant data base using the TurboSEQUEST program.Scrape Loading Fibroblasts—Fibroblasts were cultured in 6-well plates until ∼80% confluent. All procedures were carried out at 37 °C. Medium was removed, and the cells were washed twice with 2 ml of PBS. After the PBS was thoroughly removed by aspiration, 40 μg of purified bovine m-calpain, 40 μgof human erythrocyte μ-calpain, or 50 μg of human erythrocyte calpastatin, isolated as previously described (30Mellgren R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13920-13924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were added in 200 μl of scraping buffer containing 100 μm EGTA. Control samples contained buffer alone. The cells were scraped and incubated for 10 min to allow entry of the exogenous calpain or calpastatin. To allow membrane resealing, the volume was adjusted to 4 ml, and calcium was added to 2 mm. After 10 min, the samples were centrifuged at 200 × g, the supernatants were removed, and the cells were resuspended in 0.5 ml of Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 0.1% trypsin and 0.04% EDTA. After 15 min, the cells were centrifuged, and the trypsin solution was aspirated. The cells were resuspended in 8 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FBS (calcium concentration, 2 mm) and plated in 12-well plates at 1 ml of cell suspension/well. Samples of nonscraped control cells were plated at the same density. MTT reductase activity was determined 4 or 12 h later, as indicated for the specific experiment.Statistical Analysis—Where indicated, statistical comparisons utilized Student's unpaired, two-tailed t test, with graphic results expressed as mean ± S.D. A p value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.RESULTSCapns1-/- mouse embryos, which lack m- and μ-calpain activity, die in utero after embryonic day E10.5 (31Arthur J.S. Elce J.S. Hegadorn C. Williams K. Greer P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4474-4481Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Whereas SV40T-transformed Capns1-/- embryonic fibroblasts differ little from their Capns1+/+ counterparts in general growth properties (31Arthur J.S. Elce J.S. Hegadorn C. Williams K. Greer P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4474-4481Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), upon closer examination, they have a decreased clonal growth rate (25Xu Y. Mellgren R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21474-21479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), compromised haptokinetic migration, and loss of central focal adhesions (21Dourdin N. Bhatt A.K.

Chem. 2001; 276: 48382-48388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) compared with SV40T-transformed Capns1+/+ fibroblasts. Cells in culture are subjected to plasma membrane wounding as they divide and migrate (32Lee T.L. Lin Y.C. Mochitate K. Grinnell F. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 167-177Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Palecek S.P. Huttenlocher A. Horwitz A.F. Lauffenburger D.A. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 929-940Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Mayer C. Maaser K. Daryab N. Zanker K.S. Brocker E.B. Friedl P. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 83: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To determine if cell membrane repair was compromised in Capns1-/- fibroblasts, we first applied a standard cell wounding method, scraping from the substratum, and measured survival. In eight independent experiments, scraping wild-type fibroblasts in the presence of calcium led to a highly significant increase in viability, relative to cells scraped in the presence of Ca2+/EGTA (Fig. 1A). This observation is consistent with a large volume of previously published work demonstrating a calcium-dependent healing process in a variety of cell models (2McNeil P.L. Steinhardt R.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 697-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). In contrast, the Capns1-/- fibroblasts displayed virtually no increased viability when scraped in the presence of calcium, as determined by the MTT reductase method. We utilized a clonal survival assay experiment to validate the results of the MTT studies (Fig. 1B).If active calpain is required for calcium-enhanced survival after membrane disruption, then inhibition of calpain activity in Capns1+/+ fibroblasts should eliminate the survival advantage. Exposure of the cells to 20 μm calpeptin immediately prior to and during scraping eliminated the calcium effect on cell viability (Fig. 1C). In contrast, calpeptin treatment did not further decrease Capns1-/- fibroblast survival. Importantly, 10 μm calpeptin produced half-maximal inhibition of calcium-dependent cell survival and ∼70% inhibition of calpain activity in Capns1+/+ cells (not shown). Although calpeptin is not strictly specific for calpains, the concentrations of calpeptin used in our studies were well below those required to inhibit the other identified calpeptin targets, proteasome (35Botion L.M. Brasier A.R. Tian B. Udupi V. Green A. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 5069-5075Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and phosphotyrosine phosphatases (36Schoenwaelder S.M. Burridge K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14359-14367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In another experiment, Capns1-/- fibroblasts were scraped in the presence of purified m- or μ-calpain, allowing their entry at the site of plasma membrane disruption. Their introduction by this method significantly enhanced survival in medium containing calcium (Fig. 1D). Calcium enhancement of survival after membrane damage was rapid. The addition of excess EGTA only 5–10 s after scraping in the presence of calcium had little effect on survival (Fig. 1E). In summary, these studies indicate that the calcium-dependent activation of typical calpains rapidly imparts a survival advantage to Capns1+/+ fibroblasts following plasma membrane damage.Calpains may have specific effects in transformed cells that are not apparent in similar nontransformed cells (37Carragher N.O. Westhoff M.A. Riley D. Potter D.A. Dutt P. Elce J.S. Greer P.A. Frame M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 257-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). To address this issue, calcium- and calpain-dependent recovery of MTT activity after scraping was tested in two nontransformed cells: primary neonatal rat cardiomyocytes and normal human skin fibroblasts (Fig. 1F). In these experiments, the level of damage was greater than observed for scraped SV40T-transformed fibroblasts. Nevertheless, the increased recovery of MTT activity observed after scraping in the presence of calcium was completely abolished by including 20 μm calpeptin in the scraping buffer. In most cells, a highly specific inhibitor protein, calpastatin, regulates calpain activity. Calcium-dependent cell survival of HFL1 normal human lung fibroblasts was compromised by the addition of purified calpastatin in the scraping medium (Fig. 2A). Regulated expression of calpastatin in a transfected Chinese hamster ovary cell line also d"
https://openalex.org/W2035232669,"Manganese, an essential nutrient, can also elicit toxicity in the central nervous system (CNS). The route of exposure strongly influences the potential neurotoxicity of manganese-containing compounds. Recent studies suggest that inhaled manganese can enter the rat brain through the olfactory system, but little is known about the molecular factors involved. Divalent metal transporter-1 (DMT1) is the major transporter responsible for intestinal iron absorption and its expression is regulated by body iron status. To examine the potential role of this transporter in uptake of inhaled manganese, we studied the Belgrade rat, since these animals display significant defects in both iron and manganese metabolism due to a glycine-to-arginine substitution (G185R) in their DMT1 gene product. Absorption of intranasally instilled 54Mn was significantly reduced in Belgrade rats and was enhanced in iron-deficient rats compared to iron-sufficient controls. Immunohistochemical experiments revealed that DMT1 was localized to both the lumen microvilli and end feet of the sustentacular cells of the olfactory epithelium. Importantly, we found that DMT1 protein levels were increased in anemic rats. The apparent function of DMT1 in olfactory manganese absorption suggests that the neurotoxicity of the metal can be modified by iron status due to the iron-responsive regulation of the transporter."
https://openalex.org/W2156259678,"Bone morphogenic protein-7 (BMP-7) is a key protein involved in liver organogenesis and development. The physiological circulating concentration of BMP-7 is between 100 and 300 pg/ml. BMP-7 expression is absent in the liver, but the receptors for BMP-7 are present on adult hepatocytes. Therefore, we hypothesized that BMP-7 might function as an endogenous regulator of adult hepatocyte proliferation and liver homeostasis. Here, we demonstrate that neutralization of circulating endogenous BMP-7 results in significantly impaired regeneration of the liver after partial hepatectomy. Therapeutic administration of recombinant human BMP-7 (rhBMP-7) significantly enhances liver regeneration associated with accelerated improvement of liver function. Collectively, our results argue for the role of BMP-7 as a kidney- and bone-produced endogenous regulator of hepatocyte health."
https://openalex.org/W2072371514,"A reverse genetics approach was utilized to discover new proteins that interact with the mitochondrial fusion mediator mitofusin 2 (Mfn2) and that may participate in mitochondrial fusion. In particular, in vivo formaldehyde cross-linking of whole HeLa cells and immunoprecipitation with purified Mfn2 antibodies of SDS cell lysates were used to detect an ∼42-kDa protein. This protein was identified by liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry as stomatin-like protein 2 (Stoml2), previously described as a peripheral plasma membrane protein of unknown function associated with the cytoskeleton of erythrocytes (Wang, Y., and Morrow, J. S. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 8062–8071). Immunoblot analysis with anti-Stoml2 antibodies showed that Stoml2 could be immunoprecipitated specifically with Mfn2 antibody either from formaldehyde-cross-linked and SDS-lysed cells or from cells lysed with digitonin. Subsequent immunocytochemistry and cell fractionation experiments fully supported the conclusion that Stoml2 is indeed a mitochondrial protein. Furthermore, demonstration of mitochondrial membrane potential-dependent import of Stoml2 accompanied by proteolytic processing, together with the results of sublocalization experiments, suggested that Stoml2 is associated with the inner mitochondrial membrane and faces the intermembrane space. Notably, formaldehyde cross-linking revealed a “ladder” of high molecular weight protein species, indicating the presence of high molecular weight Stoml2-Mfn2 hetero-oligomers. Knockdown of Stoml2 by the short interfering RNA approach showed a reduction of the mitochondrial membrane potential, without, however, any obvious changes in mitochondrial morphology.

Mammalian mitofusins Mfn1 and Mfn2 are large GTPases of the mitochondrial outer membrane that mediate mitochondrial fusion (1Santel A. Fuller M.T. J.

They also contain two coiled-coil domains or heptad repeats (HR1 and HR2) 2The abbreviations used are: HR, heptad repeat; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FA, formaldehyde; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; LC/MS/MS, liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblasts; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GSPBS, goat serum in PBS; siRNA, short interfering RNA; TMRE, tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester perchlorate; IP, immunoprecipitation. 2The abbreviations used are: HR, heptad repeat; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FA, formaldehyde; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; LC/MS/MS, liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblasts; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GSPBS, goat serum in PBS; siRNA, short interfering RNA; TMRE, tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester perchlorate; IP, immunoprecipitation. (3Chan D.C. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2006; 22: 79-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). The major portion of each of the proteins, including the N terminus-proximal GTPase domain and HR1 and the C terminus-proximal HR2, is exposed to the cytosol (4Rojo M. Legros F. Chateau D. Lombes A. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115 (Pt 8): 1663-1674Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The attachment to the outer membrane is mediated by two membrane-spanning segments that are separated by a small intermembrane space loop and that are located between the HR1 and HR2 repeats. Human Mfn1 and Mfn2 are highly homologous proteins with 62% identity at the amino acid level with both, however, being essential proteins. The homozygous -/- Mfn1-null and -/- Mfn2-null mice die during embryonic development (5Chen H. Detmer S.A. Ewald A.J. Griffin E.E. Fraser S.E. Chan D.C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 189-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (1743) Google Scholar). The mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF), derived from the -/- Mfn1-null or -/- Mfn2-null embryos, have distinct mitochondrial morphology defects, and exhibit severe reduction in mitochondrial fusion activity (5Chen H. Detmer S.A. Ewald A.J. Griffin E.E. Fraser S.E. Chan D.C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 189-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (1743) Google Scholar). Thus, Mfn1 and Mfn2 may have different functions in mitochondrial fusion. Unlike MEF lacking Mfn1 or Mfn2, MEF lacking both mitofusins completely lack mitochondrial fusion capacity and show severe cellular dysfunction (6Chen H. Chomyn A. Chan D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26185-26192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar). Functions of Mfn2 that are independent of its fusion activity, i.e. controlling mitochondrial metabolism and repressing vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation, have also been reported (7Pich S. Bach D. Briones P. Liesa M. Camps M. Testar X. Palacin M. Zorzano A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 1405-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 8Chen K.H. Guo X. Ma D. Guo Y. Li Q. Yang D. Li P. Qiu X. Wen S. Xiao R.P. Tang J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 872-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar).Mfn2 and Mfn1 have the capacity to form homo- and hetero-oligomers, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation of tagged proteins (5Chen H. Detmer S.A. Ewald A.J. Griffin E.E. Fraser S.E. Chan D.C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 189-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (1743) Google Scholar, 9Ishihara N. Eura Y. Mihara K. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 6535-6546Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). At least one of the mitofusins is required on each of the adjacent mitochondria to promote mitochondrial fusion (10Koshiba T. Detmer S.A. Kaiser J.T. Chen H. McCaffery J.M. Chan D.C. Science. 2004; 305: 858-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). The initial step of this process is characterized by tethering of two adjacent mitochondria via assembly of a mitofusin complex, which is mediated by HR2 forming a dimeric, antiparallel coiled-coil (10Koshiba T. Detmer S.A. Kaiser J.T. Chen H. McCaffery J.M. Chan D.C. Science. 2004; 305: 858-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). The subsequent steps of mitochondrial fusion, including the exact function of the GTPase domains, are less well understood. In yeast, an interaction of the mitofusin homolog Fzo1, involving the GTPase domain and the HR domains, is essential for fusion (11Griffin E.E. Chan D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16599-16606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In the same organism, mitochondrial fusion has been reconstituted in vitro. Mitochondrial fusion proceeds through discreet and sequential mitochondrial outer and inner membrane fusion events, with both steps requiring GTP hydrolysis (12Meeusen S. McCaffery J.M. Nunnari J. Science. 2004; 305: 1747-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). A third GTPase, Opa1, appears also to be involved in the process of mitochondrial fusion (13Olichon A. Emorine L.J. Descoins E. Pelloquin L. Brichese L. Gas N. Guillou E. Delettre C. Valette A. Hamel C.P. Ducommun B. Lenaers G. Belenguer P. FEBS Lett. 2002; 523: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). This GTPase is synthesized as a precursor, which is processed by a matrix-processing peptidase to a mature form, large Opa1 (l-Opa1). l-Opa1 is anchored to the inner mitochondrial membrane and can undergo another proteolytic processing, which cleaves off the transmembrane segment and forms the small form (s-Opa1) (14Ishihara N. Fujita Y. Oka T. Mihara K. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2966-2977Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). In both yeast and mammals, the mitochondrial morphology is regulated through this proteolytic processing of Opa1 (Mgm1) in an ATP or mitochondrial membrane potential-dependent manner (14Ishihara N. Fujita Y. Oka T. Mihara K. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2966-2977Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar, 15Herlan M. Vogel F. Bornhovd C. Neupert W. Reichert A.S. J. Biol.

Nature. 2003; 423: 537-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 17Herlan M. Bornhovd C. Hell K. Neupert W. Reichert A.S. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Opa1-mediated fusion was reported to depend on Mfn1 but not on Mfn2 (18Cipolat S. Martins de Brito O. Dal Zilio B. Scorrano L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 15927-15932Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). The detailed differences in Mfn1 and Mfn2 function are, however, unclear at present. In yeast, an additional protein, Ugo1, which participates in mitochondrial fusion, has been identified (19Sesaki H. Jensen R.E. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1123-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 20Sesaki H. Jensen R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28298-28303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). This protein spans the outer mitochondrial membrane and interacts, via its N terminus-proximal cytosolic domain, with Fzo1 and, via its C terminus-proximal intermembrane space domain, with Mgm1, thus linking the outer and the inner membrane fusion machinery. However, neither an Ugo1 homolog nor additional proteins that facilitate mitochondrial fusion have been identified in mammals.In this study, we have identified a novel complex containing Mfn2 and Stoml2. Our results suggest that Stoml2 is a novel mitochondrial intermembrane space/inner membrane-localized protein that forms a large hetero-oligomeric complex with Mfn2.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmid Construction and in Vitro Transcription/Translation—To construct a plasmid encoding a His-tagged protein corresponding to amino acids 1–405 of Mfn2 (His-Mfn2-(1–405)), a 1215-nucleotide-long fragment of an MFN2 cDNA was amplified by PCR from pBSKIAA0214, which carries a human heart cDNA of MFN2 (21Nagase T. Seki N. Ishikawa K. Ohira M. Kawarabayasi Y. Ohara O. Tanaka A. Kotani H. Miyajima N. Nomura N. DNA Res. 1996; 3 (341-354): 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), and cloned into the NdeI-BamHI sites of pET-15b. The resulting pET-15b/Mfn2-(1–405) construct was verified by sequencing. To prepare an Mfn2 mammalian expression plasmid, a ∼4550-nucleotidelong HindIII-NotI fragment of pBSKIAA0214 (21Nagase T. Seki N. Ishikawa K. Ohira M. Kawarabayasi Y. Ohara O. Tanaka A. Kotani H. Miyajima N. Nomura N. DNA Res. 1996; 3 (341-354): 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), carrying the entire MFN2 cDNA, was cloned into the HindIII and NotI sites of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen).To prepare a Stoml2 expression plasmid, poly(A)+ RNA isolated from HeLa cells was reverse-transcribed and PCR-amplified using the Superscript One-Step reverse transcriptase-PCR system (Invitrogen). The resulting 1107-nucleotide-long fragment containing the entire open reading frame of STOML2 was subcloned into pGEM-Easy T (Promega) and verified by sequencing. An EcoRI fragment containing the entire open reading frame of STOML2 was further cloned into pcDNA3, and a clone of pcDNA3/Stoml2 with the correct orientation with respect to the cytomegalovirus promoter was selected.Cell Lines, Transfection, and siRNA Treatment—The HeLa human cell line (ATCC CCL-2) was grown in high glucose Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM; containing 4.5 g/liter glucose and 110 mg/liter sodium pyruvate, Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. HeLa S3 (ATCC CCL-2.2), suspension-adapted HeLa cells, were grown as described (22Chomyn A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 197-211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For transient expression experiments, cells were transfected with pcDNA3-derived plasmids using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) and incubated for ∼36 h to allow transgene expression. For RNA interference-mediated knockdown experiments, cells were transfected with 20 nm siRNA directed against STOML2 mRNA or MFN2 mRNA (siGENOME SMART pool, Dharmacon) using Dharmafect I (Dharmacon), according the manufacturer’s protocol, and incubated for 4 days to reduce Stoml2 or Mfn2 protein levels. In some experiments involving siRNASTOML2, cells were also transfected for a second time, on the third day, and incubated for a total of 6 days.Antibodies—His-Mfn2-(1–405) protein was expressed in the Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3), and the recombinant protein was purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Qiagen). The purified protein was used to generate antibodies in rabbits (Covance). The anti-Mfn2 antibodies were then blot-purified as described (23Tang W-J.Y. Methods Cell Biol. 1993; 37: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The preparation and purification of anti-Mfn1 antibodies has been described (2Santel A. Frank S. Gaume B. Herrler M. Youle R.J. Fuller M.T. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 2763-2774Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The following antibodies were also used: mouse anti-Bcl-2 monoclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), goat anti-enolase polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit anti-COXII serum (24Mariottini P. Chomyn A. Doolittle R.F. Attardi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3355-3362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), mouse anti-COXIV monoclonal antibodies (Molecular Probes), mouse anti-F1-ATPase β-subunit monoclonal antibodies (Mitosciences), mouse anti-porin monoclonal antibodies (Calbiochem), rabbit anti-prohibitin polyclonal antibodies (Lab Vision), mouse anti-Opa1 monoclonal antibodies (BD Transduction Laboratories), chicken anti-Stoml2 (N-180) polyclonal IgY antibodies (Genway), chicken anti-Stoml2 (C-186) polyclonal IgY antibodies (Genway), mouse anti-α-tubulin monoclonal antibodies (Oncogene), and rabbit anti-actin polyclonal antibodies (Sigma).Isolation and Purification of Mitochondria—Adherent cells were harvested from 20 T-175 flasks by trypsinization, washed once in PBS (140 mm NaCl, 3.8 mm NaH2PO4, 16.2 mm Na2HPO4) containing 10% calf serum and twice in NKM buffer (0.13 m NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 7.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 (25 °C)). Cells in suspension culture, exponentially growing in a 3-liter volume, were harvested and washed twice in NKM buffer. The washed cells were resuspended in six volumes (relative to the packed cells) of TKM buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7 (25 °C), 10 mm KCl, 0.15 mm MgCl2) containing a Complete Mini protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and, after 2 min, were disrupted with a motor-driven Potter-Elvehjem glass-Teflon homogenizer until ∼60–75% of the nuclei had been released (22Chomyn A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 197-211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The remainder of the preparation of the mitochondria-enriched fraction was as described (22Chomyn A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 197-211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mitochondria were further purified by centrifugation through a discontinuous Percoll/metrizamide gradient as described (25Madden E.A. Storrie B. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 163: 350-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 26Storrie B. Madden E.A. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 203-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar) but using an SW41 rotor. The purified mitochondria were washed and resuspended in STKM buffer (0.25 m sucrose in TKM) and stored at -80 °C.Submitochondrial Localization and Import of Stoml2—For membrane association studies, purified mitochondria (1 mg/ml) were incubated in a buffer (0.05 mm EDTA, Complete Mini protease inhibitor mixture, EDTA-free (Roche Applied Science), 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5 (25 °C)) for 15 min on ice. Then the same volume of distilled H2O, 3.0 m NaCl, 0.2 m Na2CO3, or 2% Triton X-100 was added, and incubation was continued for 30 min. Samples were centrifuged at 100,000 × gav for 30 min, and both pellet and supernatant fractions were analyzed by Western blotting.For protease sensitivity studies, import-competent mitochondria (2 mg/ml) were incubated with 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K in a buffer (25 mm sucrose, 75 mm sorbitol, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm KH2PO4, 0.05 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 (25 °C)) in the presence of digitonin, as specified in Fig. 4, for 30 min on ice. The reaction was stopped by the addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (5 mm final) and an equal volume of 2× Sample buffer (20% glycerol, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, 4% SDS, 125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8 (25 °C)). The samples were boiled for 5 min and analyzed by Western blotting.Preparation of import-competent mitochondria and import of protein into isolated mitochondria were carried out as described (27Fernandez-Silva P. Martinez-Azorin F. Micol V. Attardi G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1066-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The Stoml2 was synthesized in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate-based TNT T7-coupled transcription/translation system (Promega), in the presence of [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences), according the manufacturer's protocol.[35S]Met Labeling, Formaldehyde (FA) Cross-linking, and Immunoprecipitation—To label cells with [35S]methionine, 1.6 × 106 cells were grown in a 55-cm2 plate containing 4 ml of low methionine (2 × 10-2 mm methionine)-DMEM supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum in the presence of 0.5 mCi Expre35S35S protein labeling mixture (1000 Ci/mmol) for 16 h. After the labeling period, the cells were washed twice in regular culture medium and processed for FA cross-linking.35S-Labeled or unlabeled cells were scraped with a rubber policeman and resuspended in culture medium (∼2 × 106/10 ml). The cell suspension was mixed with a one-tenth volume of 11% FA (Polysciences) in PBS and incubated under mixing for 1–15 min at room temperature. Then, an equal volume of 250 mm glycine in PBS was added, and incubation was continued for 15 min to quench the unreacted FA. The cells were recovered by centrifugation and washed sequentially in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and PBS.For denaturing immunoprecipitation, ∼1 × 106 cells were lysed in 0.05 ml of buffer A (1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 (25 °C)) with vortexing in the presence of acid-washed glass beads. Then 0.85 ml of Tween-IP buffer (0.5% Tween 20, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 (25 °C)) containing the Complete Mini protease inhibitor mixture was added, and insoluble debris were removed by centrifugation at 16,000 × gav for 10 min. The supernatants (same amounts of total proteins) were incubated with the appropriate purified rabbit antibodies for 3 h at 4 °C. Then, 0.05 ml of the protein A-Sepharose suspension (100 mg of protein A-Sepharose (Sigma)/2.8 ml of a buffer (1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm NaN3, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5)) was added, and the incubation was continued for 30 min. The immune complexes captured on Sepharose beads were centrifuged through a sucrose cushion (3.42 g of sucrose/10 ml of Tween-IP buffer), washed twice with Tween-IP buffer and once with 1% 2-mercaptoethanol, and solubilized in Sample buffer (10% glycerol, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8 (25 °C)). To reverse the cross-linking, the resulting samples were heated to 95 °C for 25 min. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by autoradiography or, after the transfer to a membrane, by immunoblotting as described below.In the case of the large scale experiment (Fig. 2B), mitochondria, prepared by differential centrifugation from 21 g of HeLa S3 cells, were treated with 1% FA in buffer B (250 mm Sucrose, 10 mm KCl, 0.15 mm MgCl2, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2 (25 °C)) for 15 min. The FA was quenched by the addition of an equal volume of 250 mm glycine in buffer B. The mitochondrial pellet was then lysed in 15 ml of buffer A, insoluble debris were removed by centrifugation, and the resulting supernatant was diluted 18-times with Tween-IP buffer. Protein complexes were captured using purified anti-Mfn2 antibodies covalently attached to Dynabeads-protein A (Dynal) with dimethyl pimelimidate dihydrochloride, according to the manufacturer’s protocol, and were eluted with a buffer (500 mm NaCl, 100 mm glycine, pH 2.8 (25 °C)). The eluate was neutralized and concentrated on an Amicon Ultra centrifugal device (Millipore). Proteins were heat-treated, separated by SDS-PAGE, and detected by silver staining, and selected protein bands were excised. The further sample preparation and analysis was done by the Protein/Peptide Microanalytical Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology. Briefly, gel slices were treated with sequencing grade trypsin, and the resulting peptides were analyzed by liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). The identified peptide sequences were matched to the National Center for Biotechnology Information sequence data base using MASCOT software. The probabilities-based Mowse scores and the coverage of the proteins with the identified peptides were as follows (probability Mowse score/sequence coverage in percent): Stoml2, 42A (430/26), Stoml2, 42B (430/26), Mfn1 (500/28), Mfn2 (570/33).FIGURE 2Stoml2 is specifically immunoprecipitated with Mfn2 antibodies from FA-cross-linked cells. A,[35S]Met-labeled HeLa CCL2 cells were treated with FA, lysed, immunoprecipitated with either preimmune serum (pre-i) or anti-Mfn2 antibodies, heat-treated to 95 °C to reverse cross-linked products (indicated as revers.), and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Time (in minutes) of FA treatment is indicated. The nonspecific ∼47- and ∼52-kDa bands were absent in the HeLa S3 immunoprecipitates (not shown). B, the mitochondrial fraction, prepared by differential centrifugation from HeLa S3 cells, was treated with FA for 15 min, lysed with SDS, and immunoprecipitated with anti-Mfn2 antibodies attached to magnetic beads. The resulting immunoprecipitate was heat-treated and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining. C, HeLa CCL2 cells were treated as indicated with FA for 15 min, lysed with SDS, immunoprecipitated with either preimmune serum or anti-Mfn2 antibodies, heat-treated, and analyzed by Western blotting with Stoml2 antibodies. In parallel, 1% of total cell lysate used for immunoprecipitation (1% of input) was analyzed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)For nondenaturing immunoprecipitation, ∼1 × 106 cells were lysed in 0.8 ml of a co-IP buffer (0.5% digitonin, 120 mm NaCl, Complete Mini protease inhibitor mixture, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5 (25 °C)) for 15 min at 4 °C. The insoluble debris were removed by centrifugation at 16,000 × gav for 10 min. The resulting supernatants were incubated with the appropriate antibodies and protein A-Sepharose as described above. The immune complexes captured on Sepharose beads were centrifuged through a sucrose cushion (3.42 g of sucrose/10 ml of co-IP buffer), washed three times with co-IP buffer and once with co-IP buffer lacking digitonin, and further analyzed by Western blotting.Sample Preparation and Western Blot Analysis—To remove contaminating rabbit IgGs present in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate-based TNT T7-coupled transcription/translation system, which could interfere, in the Western blot analysis, with detection of in vitro synthesized Stoml2, samples of in vitro synthesized Stoml2 were incubated with protein A-Sepharose beads in an appropriate buffer (50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Tween 20, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 (25 °C)) for 1 h at 4°C, and the Sepharose beads were then removed by centrifugation.The FA-cross-linked cells or FA-cross-linked purified mitochondria were incubated with buffer containing 2% SDS, 100 mm NaCl, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 (25 °C) for 15 min and then centrifuged to remove insoluble debris, and the resulting extracts were used for Western blot analysis.The total protein concentration in samples of whole cells, cell extracts, or purified mitochondria was determined by the Bradford method or by the bicinchoninic acid method (28Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213377) Google Scholar, 29Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J.

Samples (whole cells, subcellular fractions, purified mitochondria, protein A-Sepharose-treated in vitro synthesized proteins, or immunoprecipitated proteins) were mixed with an equal volume of 2× Sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Rainbow (Amersham Biosciences RPN756), Magic Mark XP (Invitrogen), or Kaleidoscope (Bio-Rad) size markers were analyzed in parallel. Proteins were then electrophoretically transferred to a Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences) in a previously described transfer buffer (30Bossy-Wetzel E. Newmeyer D.D. Green D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar) modified to contain 0.037% SDS. Blocking, first and second antibody incubations, and washes were carried out in PBSTw (PBS plus 0.1% Tween 20) or PBSTw containing 5% nonfat milk. The specific protein complexes were identified by autoradiography using the Super-Signal West Pico chemiluminescence reagent (Pierce).Fluorescence Microscopy and FACS Analysis—Cells were grown in a chambered coverglass (Lab-Tek), and the medium was replaced ∼12 h before an experiment. Cells were stained with 25 nm tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester perchlorate (TMRE, Molecular Probes) or 50 nm Mitotracker Red CMXRos (Molecular Probes) in DMEM without serum for 30 min and washed again with culture medium. Microscopy was performed using an inverted Nikon Diaphot microscope equipped with a Nikon G2A filter cube, a Zeiss Planapo 63×/1.4 oil objective, and a Nikon D50 digital camera. For FACS analysis, cells were stained with 10 nm TMRE, trypsin-harvested, resuspended in PBS containing 10 nm TMRE, and analyzed by a FACSCalibur analyzer (Bio-Rad). Oxygen consumption measurements were done as described previously (31Hajek P. Villani G. Attardi G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 606-615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).Confocal Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells grown on glass coverslips were sequentially incubated in 2% FA in PBS, PBS, anhydrous methanol, PBS, and 2% goat serum in PBS (GSPBS) containing 0.5% Triton X-100. The coverslips were then incubated with anti-Stoml2 antibodies (C-186; diluted 1:50 in GSPBS) and anti-COXIV antibodies (diluted to 5 μg/ml in GSPBS) for 3 h at 37°Cina humidified chamber. As a negative control, nonimmune chicken IgY antibodies (Aves Labs) were used instead of the anti-Stoml2 antibodies. After four washes in GSPBS, the coverslips were incubated with 1:50-diluted fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey antichicken IgY and 1:50-diluted rhodamine Red-X-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (both from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) for 1 h at room temperature. After four washes in PBS, the coverslips were mounted onto microscope slides in FluoroGuard antifade reagent (Bio-Rad) and analyzed on a Zeiss 410 laser-scanning microscope equipped with a 488-nm argon and a 543-nm helium neon laser, a Zeiss 63×/1.25 oil objective, and Zeiss LSM software.RESULTSWe used in vivo FA cross-linking of HeLa cells to preserve Mfn2 protein complexes and to identify possible Mfn2-interacting proteins. FA is a highly specific cross-linker that is reactive with primary amines within 2 Aå of one another, is easily reversible, and is used to preserve protein-protein, protein-DNA, or protein-RNA complexes (32Orlando V. Strutt H. Paro R. Methods (Amst.). 1997; 11: 205-214Google Scholar). To detect Mfn2, immunoblotting with antibodies generated against a large portion of the Mfn2 protein was used. These antibodies detected a major immunoreactive protein in the untreated cell lysates (Fig. 1A, left panel, first lane), identified as Mfn2, as it was specifically increased in amount when HeLa cells were transfected with an Mfn2 expression vector (see Fig. 7B) and was specifically reduced when HeLa cells were treated with siRNAMFN2"
https://openalex.org/W2057001922,"In polyglutamine diseases such as X-linked spinobulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), it is unknown whether the toxic form of the protein is an insoluble or soluble aggregate or a monomer. We have addressed this question by studying a full-length androgen receptor (AR) mouse model of SBMA. We used biochemistry and atomic force microscopy to immunopurify oligomers soluble after ultracentrifugation that are comprised of a single ∼50-kDa N-terminal polyglutamine-containing AR fragment. AR oligomers appeared several weeks prior to symptom onset, were distinct and temporally dissociated from intranuclear inclusions, and disappeared rapidly after castration, which halts disease. This is the first demonstration of soluble AR oligomers in vivo and suggests that they underlie neurodegeneration in SBMA. In polyglutamine diseases such as X-linked spinobulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), it is unknown whether the toxic form of the protein is an insoluble or soluble aggregate or a monomer. We have addressed this question by studying a full-length androgen receptor (AR) mouse model of SBMA. We used biochemistry and atomic force microscopy to immunopurify oligomers soluble after ultracentrifugation that are comprised of a single ∼50-kDa N-terminal polyglutamine-containing AR fragment. AR oligomers appeared several weeks prior to symptom onset, were distinct and temporally dissociated from intranuclear inclusions, and disappeared rapidly after castration, which halts disease. This is the first demonstration of soluble AR oligomers in vivo and suggests that they underlie neurodegeneration in SBMA.

Large intracellular inclusions containing AR are observed throughout the body and may be localized in the cytoplasm or nucleus, whereas large intranuclear inclusions accumulate preferentially in motor neurons (8Li M.

Pathologically expanded polyglutamine protein fragments are clearly prone to misfolding and aggregation in vitro that respects the tight length-dependent disease threshold seen in vivo (11Scherzinger E.

In many experimental systems, however, large intracellular inclusions can be dissociated from neuronal toxicity, indicating that these structures are probably not the primary pathologic species (13Cummings C.J.

Science. 2003; 300: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (3381) Google Scholar), and the existence of toxic, submicroscopic aggregates or oligomers has been invoked as a cause of polyglutamine toxicity in vivo (27Kayed R.

Taye A. Markovic-Plese S. Fischbeck K.H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 749-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). The operative definition of such species has varied. We define oligomers here as submacromolecular structures (i.e. soluble after high speed centrifugation) comprised of ordered polyglutamine aggregates. As previously proposed by Taylor et al. (28Taylor J.P. Tanaka F. Robitschek J. Sandoval C.M. Taye A. Markovic-Plese S. Fischbeck K.H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 749-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), we contrast protein oligomers, which are defined primarily via biochemistry, from intracellular inclusions, which are defined via histopathology and are difficult to quantify via biochemistry. An extensive literature supports the concept that soluble protein oligomers have cellular toxicity in vitro. Recent work has also suggested that soluble A-β oligomers are an important source of toxicity in vivo (29Lesne S. Koh M.T. Kotilinek L. Kayed R. Glabe C.G. Yang A. Gallagher M. Ashe K.H. Nature. 2006; 440: 352-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (2391) Google Scholar). It has also been suggested that oligomers might mediate neurotoxicity in diseases such as Parkinson disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (30Ross C.A. Poirier M.A. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: S10-S17Crossref PubMed Scopus (2350) Google Scholar). In contrast, the production of large macromolecular inclusions is likely an end-stage consequence of the cell processing toxic proteins (30Ross C.A. Poirier M.A. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: S10-S17Crossref PubMed Scopus (2350) Google Scholar), although these structures may also have negative physiologic consequences (31Cowan K.J. Diamond M.I. Welch W.J. Hum. Mol.

To date, there has been no conclusive evidence for the existence of soluble polyglutamine protein oligomers in patients or animal models, nor any evidence that these species actually underlie toxicity in vivo. Green and colleagues (33Iuchi S. Hoffner G. Verbeke P. Djian P. Green H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2409-2414Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) reported large formic acid non-dissociable “oligomers” in Huntington disease brain but did not clearly determine the nature of their protein constituents or physical properties. Establishing that oligomers are a key pathologic species in vivo would advance our basic understanding of disease mechanisms and help in developing new therapies and in monitoring disease onset and progression. In this study, we have used a full-length AR mouse model of SBMA to identify and characterize oligomers made up of N-terminal AR fragments and to determine their abundance at different stages of disease onset, progression, and regression. Mouse Models—Mice used in this study have been characterized previously in a different background strain (7Chevalier-Larsen E.S. O'Brien C.J. Wang H. Jenkins S.C. Holder L. Lieberman A.P. Merry D.E. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 4778-4786Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). These transgenic animals harbor a full-length human AR gene containing 112 CAG repeats (AR112) driven by the PrP promoter or wild-type human AR with 24 CAG repeats (AR24). Founder male mice were backcrossed with C57B/6 females (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) to more than seven generations. Genotyping was performed from tail DNA by PCR of the human AR as described previously (7Chevalier-Larsen E.S. O'Brien C.J. Wang H. Jenkins S.C. Holder L. Lieberman A.P. Merry D.E. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 4778-4786Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Sequencing PCR products from a seventh generation of mouse genomic DNA of an AR 112 male indicated 113 CAG repeats. Mice were maintained in a barrier animal facility at the University of California San Francisco or at Thomas Jefferson University, housed five per cage with food and water available ad libitum, and kept on a 12-h light/dark cycle. All studies and procedures were done under the approval of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Castration—Castration was performed on AR112 males as described previously (7Chevalier-Larsen E.S. O'Brien C.J. Wang H. Jenkins S.C. Holder L. Lieberman A.P. Merry D.E. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 4778-4786Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Animals were euthanized, and tissues were harvested for pathology and biochemistry 3 weeks after surgery. Rotarod Performance—We performed rotarod evaluations, blinded to genotype, for wild-type and AR112 males on a rotarod apparatus (Columbus Instruments. Columbus, OH) as described previously (7Chevalier-Larsen E.S. O'Brien C.J. Wang H. Jenkins S.C. Holder L. Lieberman A.P. Merry D.E. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 4778-4786Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Briefly, we carried out four rotarod tests per session, allowing at least 15 min of rest for the mice between each test. The rotarod accelerated from 4 to 40 rpm over 15 s and was maintained at 40 rpm thereafter. The lowest value from all four tests was discarded. The remaining three values were averaged, and the data were analyzed by Student's t test, assuming equal variance between the two groups. Tissue Dissection and Homogenization—Unfixed brains were removed whole and cut in a midsagittal section. One-half of the brain tissue was embedded in OCT compound and flash-frozen in acetone-dry ice for pathological studies. The other half of the brain was flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C for use in biochemical studies. For biochemical studies, frozen brain specimens were pulverized into fine powder in a mortar and pestle on dry ice. 25–50 mg of brain powder was weighed quickly in a tube prechilled in dry ice and returned to dry ice immediately after weighing. Brain powder was homogenized in one of several solutions: high salt TBS-sucrose-Triton buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.8 m NaCl, 1 m sucrose, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor mixture (Complete Mini, Roche Applied Science)) for non-denaturing detergent extraction and immunoprecipitation; RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.15 m NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and protease inhibitors) for detergent extraction and immunoprecipitation; or 1× or 4× sample buffer (4×:20 mm dithiothreitol, 4% SDS, 160 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.9, 20% glycerol). Tissue was homogenized either by brief sonication for 3 × 10 s with 10-s intervals using a Branson Sonifier 250 at duty cycle constant, power output 5, or by Dounce homogenization. Lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 5 min by using a desktop centrifuge at room temperature for sample buffer or 4 °C for Triton or RIPA buffer or by ultracentrifuge at 150,000 × g for 30 min at 15 °C (sample buffer) or 4 °C (Triton buffer). Immunoprecipitation, Formic Acid Treatment, and Western Blot—50 mg of brain powder was Dounce-homogenized with 25 strokes on ice in 500 μl of high salt TBS-sucrose-Triton buffer or RIPA buffer and centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C (Triton buffer) or 15,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C (RIPA buffer). 2 μl of rabbit anti-AR N-terminal specific antibody (N-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was conjugated to a 20-μl bead volume of goat anti-rabbit IgG beads (Sigma) in washing buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.15 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors) or RIPA buffer. 200 μl of protein supernatant extracted with the above high salt TBS-sucrose-Triton buffer (diluted 5-fold with water) or RIPA buffer was added with AR N-20-rabbit IgG beads overnight at 4 °C. Beads were washed thoroughly with washing buffer or RIPA buffer and divided into two equivalent aliquots. One was boiled for 5 min in 1% SDS sample buffer, and the other was mixed with 100 μl of 100% formic acid, incubated at 37 °C with constant shaking at 250 rpm for 1 h, and dried by a centrifuge vacuum. Dried beads were resuspended in 1% SDS sample buffer with 5% β-mercaptoethanol and 0.004% bromphenol blue, with the pH adjusted with 5 μl of saturated Tris base (pH 11.25), and boiled at 100 °C for 5 min. Samples were run immediately on an SDS-PAGE gel followed by Western blot analyses. Equal amounts of lysate (12 μl) were resolved by 4–15% gradient SDS-PAGE (Bio-Rad Laboratories) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (pore size 0.45 μm) using a semidry transfer apparatus. 5% nonfat milk was used to block the membrane. Blots were probed with polyclonal anti-AR N-20 (1:2000 dilution), washed with TBS and 0.5% Tween 20, and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit True Blot (1:5000 dilution, eBioscience) that does not recognize denatured rabbit IgG heavy or light chain. Horseradish peroxidase signal was detected by ECL-Plus (Amersham Biosciences). Stripping buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 2% SDS, and 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol) was used for repeat blots, incubated at 55 °C for 1 h with occasional shaking, and reprobed with monoclonal anti-expanded polyglutamine (1C2, 1:2500 dilution, Chemicon International) or monoclonal anti-AR amino acid 299–315 antibody (AR 441, 1:500 dilution, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunofluorescence—Brain and spinal cord embedded in OCT were cut on a cryostat (Leica 3000) at -20 °C. 12-μm sagittal brain and axial spinal cord sections were air-dried for 20 min. Dried sections were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at 4 °C, washed with 0.05% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline, and then incubated with 5% goat serum and 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min at room temperature followed by anti-AR N-20 (1:1000) overnight incubation at 4 °C and washing with 0.05% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline. Goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (1:4000; Molecular Probes) was applied to the sections for 2 h at room temperature in the dark. The sections were washed for 1 h and counterstained with 4′, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (50 ng/ml) for 30 s, washed, and mounted with ProLong Gold anti-fade reagent (Molecular Probes). Fluorescence images were collected with a Zeiss Axiovert S100 fluorescence microscope and Zeiss Pascal laser confocal microscope. Affinity Purification and AFM—Transgenic animals and their littermates were sacrificed at age 75 and 135 days. Whole brains were immediately removed and Dounce-homogenized in 1 ml of hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.4% IGEPAL (Sigma), plus protease inhibitors) per 500 mg of wet tissue. They were incubated for 15 min on ice and centrifuged at 850 × g at 4 °C, and the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was homogenized again in the same buffer, incubated for 15 min on ice, and centrifuged at 15,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. The pellet was resuspended in hypertonic buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, plus protease inhibitor mixture), incubated, and constantly mixed on ice for 30 min. After centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was diluted with Gentle Ag/Ab binding buffer (Pierce) plus protease inhibitors and N-20 covalently conjugated to protein G agarose beads. Samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C, washed with binding buffer four times, and eluted with Gentle Ag/Ab elution buffer (high salt buffer, pH 6.5, Pierce). Approximately 1 μg of eluted protein was immediately spotted on freshly cleaved mica, incubated for 2 min, washed two times with distilled water, and air-dried. The samples were imaged in air by a digital multimode Nanoscope III scanning probe microscope (Digital Images, Santa Barbara, CA). The atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were analyzed using WsxM 2.2 software from Nanotec Electronica. Ex Vivo Fibrillization—Whole brain was homogenized in RIPA buffer with protease inhibitor mixture, incubated on ice for 20 min, and then centrifuged at 15,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. The supernatant was passed through a cellulose acetate filter and added to protein G beads that were covalently bound with the AR N-20 antibody and incubated at 4 °C overnight with constant rotation. The beads were extensively washed with RIPA buffer and eluted by 0.1 m glycine-HCl buffer (pH 2–3) and then passed through a 0.45-μm cellulose acetate membrane filter by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 1 min. The pH was neutralized by adding 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 9.5) immediately after the elution. A 20-μl elution aliquot was added on the mica surface, washed twice with distilled water, and dried in air and then scanned by AFM. Another 20-μl elution aliquot was added to the 1% SDS sample buffer plus 5% 2-mercaptomethanol, boiled for 5 min, and then run on a 4–15% gradient SDS-PAGE gel and probed with AR N-20. To allow aggregation ex vivo, we incubated the elution aliquot at 4 °C for 0, 24, and 48 h. Formation of Intermediate MW Aggregates in AR112 Mice— We previously described the generation of a mouse model of SBMA that is based on neuronal expression from the PrP promoter of full-length human AR with 112 glutamine repeats (AR112) along with an identical cDNA with 24 glutamine repeats (AR24) (7Chevalier-Larsen E.S. O'Brien C.J. Wang H. Jenkins S.C. Holder L. Lieberman A.P. Merry D.E. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 4778-4786Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In the C57B/6 background, AR112 males exhibit hormone- and age-dependent weakness beginning at ∼10 weeks of age. Large neuronal intranuclear inclusions form at later time points throughout the central nervous system (7Chevalier-Larsen E.S. O'Brien C.J. Wang H. Jenkins S.C. Holder L. Lieberman A.P. Merry D.E. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 4778-4786Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, A and B). We tested for soluble protein aggregates initially by homogenizing brain samples from 6-month-old animals in SDS buffer with brief sonication and clarifying the lysate via centrifugation at 15,000 × g. As described previously (7Chevalier-Larsen E.S. O'Brien C.J. Wang H. Jenkins S.C. Holder L. Lieberman A.P. Merry D.E. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 4778-4786Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), after Western blot using AR N-terminal antibody (N-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), we observed AR112 monomer (∼130 kDa) and an intermediate molecular weight smear consistent with aggregated protein running at ∼250–450 kDa (Fig. 1C). Similar species were observed in spinal cord extracts, although overall levels of AR detected were much less (Supplemental Fig. 1). The aggregated species were not present in non-transgenic or female AR112 littermates or in male AR24 transgenics (Fig. 1C). Ultracentrifugation of tissue preparations (150,000 × g) had no effect on the prevalence of the intermediate MW species (Fig. 1D), indicating their high solubility. We excluded the possibility that sonication or SDS-extraction was somehow liberating the intermediate MW species from large aggregates by extracting brain samples without sonication in a non-ionic detergent (1% Triton X-100) not known to dissociate polyglutamine aggregates. We then carried out immunoprecipitation with N-20 antibody followed by Western blot. The intermediate MW species reactive with an AR N-terminal antibody remained and were found exclusively in symptomatic male AR112 mice (Fig. 2A).FIGURE 2N-terminal AR fragments comprise oligomers. Brains from wild-type and AR112 mice aged 102 days were extracted in non-ionic detergent and immunoprecipitated with N-20. Samples were treated with and without formic acid to dissociate aggregates and resolved by Western blot using N-20 (A) and then stripped and reprobed with 1C2 (B) antibody. The vertical bar illustrates the extent of aggregates. Dark arrow, full-length AR112; gray arrow, full-length wild-type AR. NS, nonspecific bands serve as a loading control. A, formic acid reduced the high molecular weight species observed in AR112 male mice and caused the appearance of an ∼50-kDa fragment (open arrow). As expected, 1C2 did not react with higher molecular weight aggregates but did recognize the 50-kDa fragment, indicating that it contains the polyglutamine tract. A faint, nonspecific 50-kDa band that does not react with 1C2 is present in the AR112F sample, and a smaller band at ∼40 kDa represents a nonspecific band that serves as a loading control. wtM, wild-type male mice; wtF, wild-type female mice. B, reprobing the blot with the 1C2 antibody, which reacts with non-aggregated expanded polyglutamine tracts, revealed the same ∼50-kDa band observed in A that is released by formic acid treatment. C–J, atomic force microscopy was used to resolve material recovered by AR affinity purification and elution with high salt buffer. AR112 female mice (C and D) did not have evident oligomers, whereas samples from AR112 male mice (E and F) contained ordered oligomers ∼4–15 nm in height that were arranged singly or in small proto-fibrillar arrays. A higher magnification picture (G and H) illustrates a small proto-fibril. I represents a height scan across the area pictured in several 5–10-μm2 scan pictures, demonstrating the number of particles at each height. J represents a height scan across the protofibril pictured in G and H, indicating a height of ∼7 nm. Images C, E, and G indicate amplitude images; images D, F, and H reflect actual heights of the samples.

We prepared brain extracts from 102-day-old male and female AR112 mice, which have no large inclusions, and immunoprecipitated AR using N-20 antibody. The beads were subsequently treated with or without 95% formic acid (FA) for 1 h, which has been demonstrated to dissociate SDS-insoluble protein aggregates that are stabilized by hydrogen bonds (33Iuchi S.

With FA treatment, however, these species dissociated, and we observed a new ∼50-kDa band consistent with an AR N-terminal fragment that was especially visible when the blot was reprobed with 1C2 antibody (1C2, Chemicon), which reacts with non-aggregated expanded polyglutamine tracts (Fig. 2B). Longer treatment with formic acid (∼75 min) caused complete disappearance of the intermediate MW species (data not shown and Supplemental Fig. 2). There was no change in control samples of AR24 transgenic mice or AR112 female mice, indicating that the formic acid treatment was not hydrolyzing AR (Fig. 2, A and B), and we did not observe ubiquitin reactivity in the aggregated material (Supplemental Fig. 2). Western blot using antibody that recognizes an epitope between amino acids 299 and 315 (AR441, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) did not react with the aggregated material (Supplemental Fig. 3). 1C2 antibody reacted with both the full-length and the N-terminal fragments but not with unexpanded AR, as expected (Fig. 2B). We did not observe the ∼50-kDa fragment in the absence of FA treatment, implying that this peptide does not constitute a significant amount of the cellular protein, is rapidly degraded, or rapi"
https://openalex.org/W2078337496,"Potent Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) activation by endotoxin has been intensely studied, but the molecular requirements for endotoxin interaction with TLR4 are still incompletely defined. Ligand-receptor interactions involving endotoxin and TLR4 were characterized using monomeric endotoxin·protein complexes of high specific radioactivity. The binding of endotoxin·MD-2 to the TLR4 ectodomain (TLR4ECD) and transfer of endotoxin from CD14 to MD-2/TLR4ECD were demonstrated using HEK293T-conditioned medium containing TLR4ECD ± MD-2. These interactions are specific, of high affinity (KD < 300 pm), and consistent with the molecular requirements for potent cell activation by endotoxin. Both reactions result in the formation of a Mr ∼ 190,000 complex composed of endotoxin, MD-2, and TLR4ECD. CD14 facilitates transfer of endotoxin to MD-2 (TLR4) but is not a stable component of the endotoxin·MD-2/TLR4 complex. The ability to assay specific high affinity interactions of monomeric endotoxin·protein complexes with TLR4ECD should allow better definition of the structural requirements for endotoxin-induced TLR4 activation.

Essential arms of the innate immune system are the Toll-like receptors (TLRs). 2The abbreviations used are: TLR, Toll-like receptor; TLR4ECD, Toll-like receptor 4 ectodomain; AOAH, acyloxyacyl hydrolase; GNB, Gram-negative bacteria; HEK, human embryonic kidney; HSA, human serum albumin; LBP, lipopolysaccharide-binding protein; LOS, lipooligosaccharide; LOSagg, LOS aggregate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; sCD14, soluble CD14; cpm, counts/min. These receptors link recognition of unique microbial molecules to activation of host defense effector systems by rapidly triggering pro-inflammatory responses (1Beutler B. Jiang Z. Georgel P.

Potent host responses toward many Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) are mediated by recognition and response to unique glycolipids (lipopoly- or lipooligosaccharides LOS, endotoxin) of the GNB outer membrane by TLR4. TLR4 does not function alone but requires the accessory protein MD-2, which binds non-covalently to the N-terminal ectodomain of TLR4 (2Akashi S. Nagai Y. Ogata H. Oikawa M. Fukase K. Kusumoto S.

Immunol. 1999; 11: 19-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). The sequential action of LBP, CD14, secreted or TLR4-associated MD-2, and TLR4 confers the extraordinary sensitivity of mammalian cells to many GNB endotoxins. This ordered action implies differences in endotoxin binding specificity, with LBP having the highest affinity for endotoxin organized at lipid/water interfaces (e.g. purified endotoxin aggregates and endotoxin in the GNB outer membrane), CD14 for LBP-modified endotoxin-rich interfaces, MD-2 for monomeric endotoxin·CD14 and TLR4, apparently, for endotoxin presented as a monomeric complex with MD-2 (8Gioannini T.L. Teghanemt A. Zhang D. Levis E.N. Weiss J.P. J. Endotoxin Res. 2005; 11: 117-123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Together, these proteins can convert one GNB (containing ∼106 endotoxin molecules) to 106 TLR4-activating monomeric endotoxin·protein complexes (i.e. endotoxin·CD14 or endotoxin·MD-2), greatly amplifying host responsiveness to endotoxin. At pm concentrations, monomeric complexes of endotoxin·CD14 or endotoxin·MD-2 activate, respectively, mammalian cells expressing MD-2/TLR4 or TLR4 alone, triggering robust cell activation through engagement of <103 TLR4 molecules. Despite the ability of endotoxin·CD14 and endotoxin· MD-2 to activate cells at pm concentrations (half-maximal cell activation is <50 pm), published estimates of TLR4-dependent cellular interactions of endotoxin have indicated an apparent Kd of ≥3 nm (10Hyakushima N.

It is possible that brief occupation of a small subset of TLR4 is sufficient for robust cell activation. However, an important limitation of earlier studies has been the likelihood that much of the endotoxin added was not presented as the monomeric protein·endotoxin complex that is likely the preferred substrate for MD-2/TLR4 or TLR4 alone. In contrast to the remarkable progress in identification and characterization of the intracellular biochemical machinery responsible for TLR signaling, there is still virtually nothing known about the specificities of ligand-receptor interaction for any of the TLRs. In nearly all cases, TLR recognition has been inferred from the measurement of receptor activation, not binding, properties of specific compounds. In this study, we have made use of our ability to produce and isolate stable endotoxin·protein complexes of high specific radioactivity (∼25,000 cpm/pmol) to more rigorously and directly characterize ligand-receptor interactions involving endotoxin and TLR4. For this purpose, we have expressed, in HEK293T cells, the predicted ectodomain of human TLR4 (amino acids 24–634, TLR4ECD) (16Re F. Strominger J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23427-23432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) with or without human MD-2 to permit direct assay of endotoxin interactions with TLR4ECD ± MD-2. We describe, for the first time, the direct binding of endotoxin·MD-2 complex to the predicted TLR4 ectodomain in the absence of any other cellular or extracellular co-factors and the direct transfer of endotoxin from CD14 to MD-2/TLR4ECD. These interactions are highly specific and of very high affinity (Kd ≤ 300 pm) and fully consistent with the molecular requirements for potent mammalian cell activation by endotoxin. Both binding of endotoxin·MD-2 to TLR4ECD and transfer of endotoxin from endotoxin·CD14 to MD-2/TLR4ECD result in the formation of a stable complex that is composed of endotoxin, MD-2, and TLR4ECD without CD14. Materials—LBP and sCD14 were gifts from Xoma (Berkley, CA) and Amgen Corp. (Thousand Oaks, CA) respectively. Acyloxyacyl hydrolase (AOAH) was a gift from Dr. R. Munford (University of Texas Southwestern, Dallas, TX). Soluble MD-2 containing a hexapolyhistidine tag on the C-terminal end was prepared as previously described (17Gioannini T.L. Teghanemt A.

Human serum albumin (HSA) was obtained as an endotoxin-free, 25% stock solution (Baxter Health Care, Glendale, CA). [3H]LOS (25,000 cpm/pmol) from an acetate auxotroph of Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B was metabolically labeled and isolated as described previously (18Giardina P.C. Gioannini T.

Chromatography matrices (Sephacryl HR S200 and S300, Ni2+ FF-Sepharose) were purchased from GE Healthcare (Piscataway, NJ). Anti-FLAG M2-agarose and streptavidin-agarose were purchased from Sigma. Production of Recombinant Protein—HEK293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells (∼80% confluency in T75 flasks) were transfected with 12 μg of DNA using PolyFect reagent (Qiagen). After 12 h, plates were rinsed in PBS and 8 ml of serum-free medium (293 SFM, Invitrogen) ± [3H]LOS·sCD14 (1 nm; see below) were added. Medium containing expressed proteins was collected 24–48 h later. Medium was concentrated 10–20-fold using Millipore Centricon-10 before use. Conditioned medium containing secreted TLR4ECD and MD-2/TLR4ECD proteins maintained activity to react with [3H]LOS·MD-2 or [3H]LOS·sCD14 for at least 6 months when stored at 4 °C. Expression vectors containing the DNA of interest for production of FLAG-TLR4ECD, amino acids 24–634, (pFLAG-CMV-TLR4) and MD-2-FLAG-His (pEF-BOS) have been previously described and characterized (16Re F. Strominger J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23427-23432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). cDNA encoding MD-2 and sCD14-(1–156) were inserted (17Gioannini T.L. Teghanemt A. Zhang D. Coussens N.P. Dockstader W. Ramaswamy S. Weiss J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This provides a 5′-flanking signal sequence (gp64) to promote secretion of protein and a C-terminal six-residue polyhistidine tag. Sf9 cells were used for transfection and amplification of baculovirus, whereas High Five cells in serum-free medium were used for protein production (17Gioannini T.L. Teghanemt A. Zhang D. Coussens N.P. Dockstader W. Ramaswamy S. Weiss J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4186-4191Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Conditioned medium containing secreted MD-2-His6 was used directly for generation of LOS·MD-2. Conditioned medium containing sCD14-(1–156)-His6 was dialyzed against 20 mm phosphate, 0.5 m NaCl, adsorbed to Ni2+ FF-Sepharose equilibrated in the same buffer, washed, and the adsorbed protein eluted by an imidazole gradient (Explorer 100 fast protein liquid chromatography, GE Healthcare). Preparation of [3H]LOS·Protein Complexes—[3H]LOSagg, [3H]LOS·sCD14, and [3H]LOS·MD-2 complexes were prepared as previously described (8Gioannini T.L. Teghanemt A. Zhang D. Levis E.N. Weiss J.P. J.

Briefly, [3H]LOSagg (Mr > 20 × 106) was obtained after hot phenol extraction of [3H]LOS followed by ethanol precipitation of [3H]LOSagg and ultracentrifugation. Monomeric [3H]LOS·CD14 complexes (Mr ∼60,000) were prepared by treatment of [3H]LOSagg for 30 min at 37 °C with substoichiometric LBP (molar ratio 200:1 of LOS:LBP) and equimolar sCD14 followed by gel exclusion chromatography (Sephacryl S200, 1.6 × 70-cm column) in PBS, pH 7.4, 0.03% HSA to isolate monomeric [3H]LOS·sCD14 complex. [3H]LOS·MD-2 (Mr ∼25,000) was generated by treatment of [3H]LOS·sCD14 (30 min at 37 °C) with High Five insect cell medium containing MD-2-His6 followed by isolation of [3H]LOS·MD-2 by S200 chromatography. Tetraacylated LOS (specific activity ∼16,000 cpm/pmol) was prepared by partial deacylation of [3H]LOS with AOAH according to the method of Munford and Erwin (20Munford R.S. Erwin A.L. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 485-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and [3H]LOSAOAH·MD-2 was prepared and isolated as described previously (21Teghanemt A. Zhang D. Levis E.N. Weiss J.P. Gioannini T.L. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 4669-4676Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The extent of deacylation of [3H]LOS by AOAH was monitored by separation of released [3H]-free fatty acids from partially deacylated and remaining intact [3H]LOS by ethanol precipitation. Ethanol-soluble radioactivity representing released [3H]fatty acids was analyzed by liquid scintillation spectroscopy (20Munford R.S. Erwin A.L.

Radiochemical purity of [3H]LOSagg, [3H]LOS·sCD14, and [3H]LOS·MD-2 was confirmed by Sephacryl S500 (LOSagg) or S200 ([3H]LOS·sCD14, [3H]LOS·MD-2) chromatography (17Gioannini T.L. Teghanemt A.

Reaction of Secreted TLR4ECD and MD-2/TLR4ECD with [3H]LOS·Protein Complexes—[3H]LOSagg, [3H]LOS·sCD14, or [3H]LOS·MD-2 (1 nm or as indicated) was incubated with concentrated (8–10×) conditioned medium ± proteins diluted to a final volume of 0.5 or 1 ml in PBS, pH 7.4, for 30 min at 37°C. In most experiments, conditioned medium harvested after a 48-h culture of transfected HEK293T cells in serum-free medium was used for incubations with [3H]LOSagg, [3H]LOS·sCD14, or [3H]LOS·MD-2. However, in selected experiments, the serum-free medium was spiked with [3H]LOS·sCD14 (1 nm) at the time of the addition of medium to the transfected cells to permit reaction of MD-2 with [3H]LOS·sCD14 upon secretion. Medium harvested without [3H]LOS·sCD14 is expressed (see Figs. 1 and 2, 3, 4, 5) as recombinant protein secreted in cm, whereas medium spiked with [3H]LOS·sCD14 during cell culture are represented as HEK/recombinant protein(s) secreted + [3H]LOS·sCD14 (see Fig. 4). Reaction products were analyzed by Sephacryl HR S200 or S300 (1.6 × 70 cm) chromatography in PBS, pH 7.4, ±0.5 mm Mg2+, 1 mm Ca2+, 0.03% HSA. Divalent cations and HSA were used in columns with LOSagg to improve recoveries of LOSagg. Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min at room temperature using AKTA Purifier or Explorer 100 fast protein liquid chromatography (GE Healthcare). Radioactivity in collected fractions was analyzed by liquid scintillation spectroscopy (Beckman LS liquid scintillation counter). Recoveries of [3H]LOS were ≥70% in all cases. All solutions used were pyrogen-free and sterile-filtered. After chromatography, selected fractions were sterile-filtered (0.22 μm) and kept at 4 °C for 3–6 months with no detectable changes in chromatographic or functional properties. The same conditioned medium was used for all concentrations of [3H]LOS·sCD14 or [3H]LOS·MD-2 used for Scatchard analysis. Multiple preparations of conditioned medium contained similar amounts of TLR4ECD or MD-2/TLR4ECD, i.e. 1–2 and 3–4 pmol/ml, respectively.FIGURE 2Specific high affinity interactions of [3H]LOS·sCD14 with MD-2/TLR4ECD.

Co-capture of [3H]LOS associated with MD-2-FLAG-His6 (HEK293T cell-derived) or MD-2-His6 (insect cell-derived) was performed using Ni2+ FF-Sepharose resin pre-equilibrated in either PBS (product containing MD-2-FLAG-His6) or 20 mm phosphate and 0.5 m NaCl, pH 7.4, (product containing MD-2-His6). Resin (∼50 μl) was incubated with 0.2 pmol [3H]LOS-containing complexes for 1 h at room temperature. The resin was spun down, supernatant was removed, and the resin was washed with PBS, pH 7.4, or 20 mm phosphate, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 7.4, before elution with 2% SDS or 0.5 m imidazole. [3H]LOS absorbed to the resin was evaluated by liquid scintillation spectroscopy. Detection of FLAG-TLR4ECD in [3H]LOS-containing complexes was determined by adsorption to anti-FLAG-agarose (for the product of the reaction of [3H]LOS·MD-2-His6 + (FLAG-TLR4ECD)cm) or by reaction with biotinylated HTA125 anti-TLR4 antibody followed by adsorption to streptavidin-agarose (for the product of the reaction of [3H]LOS·sCD14 with (MD-2-FLAG-His6/FLAG-TLR4)cm). [3H]LOS-containing complex (0.2 pmol) was incubated with 75 μl of anti-FLAG-agarose in 0.5 ml of buffer (PBS, pH 7.4, or 20 mm phosphate and 0.5 m NaCl, pH 7.4) overnight at 4 °C on a rotating wheel. The supernatant was collected after spinning (2000 revolutions/min, 5 min, 4 °C), and the sedimented beads were washed three times with 20 mm phosphate and 0.5 m NaCl before [3H]LOS adsorbed to beads was determined by liquid scintillation spectroscopy. Immunocapture by anti-TLR4 antibody of [3H]LOS-containing complex (0.2 pmol) was performed by incubation of the complex with 2 μg of biotinylated HTA125 anti-TLR4 antibody (or non-biotinylated HTA125 as a negative control) in PBS, pH 7.4. After overnight incubation at 4 °C with the sample, 50 μl of PBS-equilibrated streptavidin-coupled agarose beads were added for an additional 1 h at room temperature. Adsorbed [3H]LOS-containing complex was determined by measuring [3H]LOS associated with the washed agarose. Soluble TLR4ECD Binds [3H]LOS·MD-2 with Picomolar Affinity—We have previously described the generation and isolation of a monomeric [3H]LOS·MD-2 complex that potently activates cells expressing TLR4 without MD-2 (17Gioannini T.L. Teghanemt A. Zhang D. Coussens N.P. Dockstader W. Ramaswamy S. Weiss J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4186-4191Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 21Teghanemt A. Zhang D.

McCray Jr., P.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: L428-L437Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). [3H]LOS·MD-2, but not the same [3H]LOS (25,000 cpm/pmol) presented as LOS aggregates (LOSagg) or monomeric LOS·sCD14, associates with these cells in a TLR4-dependent fashion (17Gioannini T.L. Teghanemt A. Zhang D. Coussens N.P. Dockstader W. Ramaswamy S. Weiss J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4186-4191Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). However, detection of cell-associated [3H]LOS·MD-2 required several hours of incubation (17Gioannini T.L. Teghanemt A. Zhang D. Coussens N.P. Dockstader W. Ramaswamy S. Weiss J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4186-4191Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), suggesting that levels of surface-expressed TLR4 in these cells were too low to measure direct binding. To circumvent these limitations and permit more direct assay of the molecular requirements for endotoxin-TLR4 interactions, we transiently expressed, in HEK293T cells, an N-terminal fragment of recombinant human TLR4 (residues 24–634) corresponding to the predicted ectodomain of TLR4 (TLR4ECD) and containing an N-terminal FLAG tag. Harvested control and TLR4ECD-containing culture media were incubated with 1 nm of purified [3H]LOS aggregates (LOSagg), monomeric [3H]LOS·sCD14, or [3H]LOS·MD-2-His6. Interaction of the various forms of [3H]LOS with TLR4ECD was monitored by gel filtration analysis to assay for TLR4ECD-dependent changes in the physical state of [3H]LOS. Under these experimental conditions, only [3H]LOS·MD-2 reacted with TLR4ECD (Fig. 1). Incubation of [3H]LOS·MD-2 with conditioned medium containing TLR4ECD (but not control medium) yielded a novel [3H]LOS-containing product (Fig. 1A, encircled peak) whose formation depended upon TLR4ECD and the presentation of [3H]LOS as [3H]LOS·MD-2 (Fig. 1, compare A to B and C). Neither [3H]LOSagg nor [3H]LOS·sCD14 showed interaction with TLR4ECD (Fig. 1, B and C), even when added at 200× greater LOS concentrations (data not shown). These findings strongly suggest a specific and direct interaction of [3H]LOS·MD-2 with TLR4ECD. Rechromatography on Sephacryl S300 of the newly formed [3H]LOS-containing product recovered after incubation of [3H]LOS·MD-2-His6 with medium containing FLAG-TLR4ECD (Fig. 1A, encircled fractions) yielded a single symmetrical peak that, by comparison to elution of protein standards, gave a predicted Mr ∼ 190,000 (Fig. 1D). [3H]LOS in the product could be captured by anti-FLAG (Fig. 1F) antibodies as well as by Ni+2-chelating resin (Fig. 1E), indicating the presence of MD-2-His6 as well as [3H]LOS and FLAG-TLR4ECD in the Mr ∼ 190,000 complex. The high specific radioactivity of [3H]LOS·MD-2 permitted quantitative assay of the formation of the Mr ∼ 190,000 complex at pm concentrations of [3H]LOS·MD-2 and under conditions where the concentration of TLR4ECD was limiting. Formation of the Mr ∼ 190,000 complex was dependent on [3H]LOS·MD-2 concentration and saturated at ∼1 nm [3H]LOS·MD-2 with half-maximal formation at ∼200–300 pm [3H]LOS·MD-2 (Fig. 1H). Equilibrium conditions were met after 30 min at 37 °C as equal amounts of product were formed at 30 and 120 min. Scatchard analysis (Fig. 1H) indicated an apparent KD of ∼300 pm for the reaction of [3H]LOS·MD-2 with TLR4ECD. The interaction of [3H]LOS·MD-2 (25,000 cpm/pmol) with TLR4ECD could be competed with weakly labeled [14C]LOS·MD-2 (625 cpm/pmol) but not [14C]LOSagg or LOS·sCD14 (data not shown), further demonstrating the specificity of the interaction of LOS·MD-2 with TLR4ECD. Transfer of [3H]LOS from [3H]LOS·sCD14 to MD-2/TLR4ECD—The inability of [3H]LOS·sCD14 to react with TLR4ECD (Fig. 1B) is consistent with the requirements of co-expression of MD-2 and TLR4 for sensitive cellular responses to monomeric endotoxin·sCD14 complex (22Jia H.P. Kline J.N. Penisten A. Apicella M.A. Gioannini T.L. Weiss J. McCray Jr., P.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: L428-L437Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). To demonstrate more directly the requirement of MD-2 for interaction of [3H]LOS·sCD14 with complexes containing TLR4ECD, we co-transfected HEK293T cells with expression plasmids for FLAG-TLR4ECD and MD-2-FLAG-His6. In contrast to incubations with control medium or medium containing TLR4ECD alone, incubation of [3H]LOS·sCD14 with harvested culture medium containing both secreted MD-2 and TLR4ECD yielded an [3H]LOS-containing product that eluted at Mr > [3H]LOS·sCD14 (Fig. 2A). In contrast to the efficient reaction of [3H]LOS·sCD14 with MD-2 and TLR4ECD, there"

In yeast, the appearance of one prion, [PSI+], is enhanced by the presence of another prion, [PIN+]. The [PSI+] and [PIN+] prion-forming proteins are, respectively, the translational termination factor Sup35 and the yet poorly characterized Rnq1 protein that is rich in glutamines and asparagines. The prion domain of Rnq1 (RnqPD) polymerizes more readily in vitro than the full-length protein. As is typical for amyloidogenic proteins, the reaction begins with a lag phase, followed by exponential growth. Seeding with pre-formed aggregates significantly shortens the lag. A generic antibody against pre-amyloid oligomer inhibits the unseeded but not the self-seeded reaction. As revealed by electron microscopy, RnqPD polymerizes predominantly into spherical species that eventually agglomerate. We observed infrequent fiber-like structures in samples taken at 4 h of polymerization, but in overnight samples SDS treatment was required to reveal fibers among agglomerates. Polymerization reactions in which RnqPD and the prion domain of Sup35 (Sup35NM) cross-seed each other proceeded with a shortened lag that only depends weakly on the protein concentration. Cross-seeded Sup35NM fibers appear to sprout from globular RnqPD aggregates as seen by electron microscopy. RnqPD spherical aggregates appear to associate with and, later occlude, Sup35NM seed fibers. Our kinetic and morphological analyses suggest that, upon cross-seeding, the aggregate provides the surface on which oligomers of the heterologous protein nucleate their subsequent amyloid formation.

Our kinetic and morphological analyses suggest that, upon cross-seeding, the aggregate provides the surface on which oligomers of the heterologous protein nucleate their subsequent amyloid formation. Prions are currently viewed as proteinaceous genetic elements because of their potential to encode, propagate, and discretely modify phenotypes produced by an infectious alternative conformational state of the prion protein (1Wickner R.B. Edskes H.K. Ross E.D. Pierce M.M. Baxa U. Brachmann A. Shewmaker F. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2004; 38: 681-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In this state, proteins form amyloid aggregates characterized by a rigid structure that is stabilized by inter β-sheet bonds (2Ross E.D. Minton A. Wickner R.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 1039-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). These aggregates can convert molecules of the prion-forming protein from the normal conformation into the prion form. Propagation of the prion state in vivo is based upon fragmentation of already formed aggregates that results in multiplication of prion seeds. In mammals, the prion PrPSc is the causative agent of a series of neurodegenerative disorders, e.g. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, scrapie of sheep, etc. (for review see Ref. 3Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5168) Google Scholar). Several prions have been characterized in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (for review see Refs. 4Osherovich L.Z. Weissman J.S. Dev.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2004: 305-372Google Scholar), and a growing body of evidence suggests that there are interactions between them (for review see Ref. 6Derkatch I.L. Liebman S.W. Chernoff Y.O. Protein Based Inheritance. Landes Bioscience, Georgetown, TX2006Google Scholar). These interactions range from the ability of one prion to facilitate the appearance of another to incompatibility between some (7Derkatch I.L. Bradley M.E. Zhou P. Chernoff Y.O. Liebman S.W. Genetics. 1997; 147: 507-519Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Schwimmer C. Masison D.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3590-3598Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 9Bradley M.E. Liebman S.W. Genetics. 2003; 165: 1675-1685Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we focus on two yeast prions, [PSI+] and [PIN+], as a model for prion-prion interactions. [PSI+] is composed of the alternatively folded translational termination factor Sup35 (10Ter-Avanesyan M.D. Dagkesamanskaya A.R. Kushnirov V.V. Smirnov V.N. Genetics. 1994; 137: 671-676Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Zhouravleva G. Frolova L. Le Goff X. Guellec R.Le Inge-Vechtomov S. Kisselev L. Philippe M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4065-4072Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar) and is characterized by an increased level of readthrough of stop codons (nonsense suppression) because of the sequestration of Sup35 into prion aggregates (12Paushkin S.V. Kushnirov V.V. Smirnov V.N. Ter-Avanesyan M.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3127-3134Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). A Sup35 fragment spanning amino acids 1–253 (Sup35NM) 3The abbreviations used are: Sup35NM, region encompassing the N-terminal and middle domains of the yeast Sup35 protein (amino acids 1–254); TEM, transmission electron microscopy; ThT, thioflavin T; RnqPD, prion domain of the yeast Rnq1 protein (amino acids 132–405). forms fibers in vitro with sigmoidal kinetics in which rapid growth is preceded by a lag phase (13Glover J.R.

Weissman J.S. Cell. 1998; 93: 1241-1252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Such kinetics are typical of amyloidogenic proteins arguing that their polymerization is a nucleated process and that nucleation is the rate-limiting step (15Jarrett J.T. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Cell. 1993; 73: 1055-1058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1933) Google Scholar). This model was developed further for Sup35NM by Serio et al. (16Serio T.R. Cashikar A.G. Kowal A.S. Sawicki G.J. Moslehi J.J. Serpell L. Arnsdorf M.F. Lindquist S.L. Science. 2000; 289: 1317-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar) who showed that the nucleus forms within the context of an oligomer, although the involvement of an oligomeric intermediate was not supported in another study (17Collins S.R. Douglass A. Vale R.D. Weissman J.S. Plos Biol. 2004; 2: 1583-1590Crossref Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Unlike true amyloid fibers that appear after a lag, oligomers form soon after the resuspension of Sup35NM into an aqueous buffer (18Scheibel T. Bloom J. Lindquist S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2287-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). These in vitro made fibers (19Tanaka M. Chien P. Naber N. Cooke R. Weissman J.S. Nature. 2004; 428: 323-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar) as well as fibers of a shorter Sup35 fragment (20King C.Y. Diaz-Avalos R. Nature. 2004; 428: 319-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar) have been shown to be infectious as they convert the cells from [psi-]to[PSI+] upon transformation thus proving the protein-only hypothesis for the [PSI+] prion. In vivo, the appearance of [PSI+] can be induced by overproduction of Sup35NM in the presence of another prion, [PIN+] (7Derkatch I.L. Bradley M.E. Zhou P. Chernoff Y.O. Liebman S.W. Genetics. 1997; 147: 507-519Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This prion is produced by a self-perpetuating aggregated form of Rnq1 (21Derkatch I.L. Bradley M.E. Hong J.Y. Liebman S.W. Cell. 2001; 106: 171-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar), a protein whose function is not yet known. Rnq1 was discovered independently (22Sondheimer N. Lindquist S. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 163-172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in a genome-wide screen in silico for proteins with homology to the Q/N-rich prion domains of the previously characterized yeast prion proteins Sup35NM and Ure2 (23Wickner R.B. Science. 1994; 264: 566-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar) and was shown to be able to form a prion in vivo. The first studies of Rnq1 polymerization were done using a construct accidentally lacking the NNGNQN sequence at the C terminus (22Sondheimer N. Lindquist S. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 163-172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which we refer to as altered Rnq1. It polymerized in vitro with a lag that could be shortened by self-seeding, and the presence of these Rnq1 aggregates enhanced polymerization of Sup35NM in vitro (24Derkatch I.L. Uptain S.M. Outeiro T.F. Krishnan R. Lindquist S.L. Liebman S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 12934-12939Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). This finding is one of the major arguments in favor of a cross-seeding mechanism postulated for the enhanced induction of [PSI+] in the presence of [PIN+]. Once formed, Sup35 and Rnq1 prion aggregates constitute separate structures in [PSI+][PIN+] yeast (25Bagriantsev S. Liebman S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51042-51048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), suggesting that cross-seeding is a transient event required only for the initiation of Sup35 polymerization which then proceeds via a more efficient self-templating mechanism. However, the relationships between [PSI+] and [PIN+] are complex; certain variants of the two destabilize each other (9Bradley M.E. Liebman S.W. Genetics. 2003; 165: 1675-1685Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the formation of Sup35 nonheritable amyloid polymers is dependent upon Rnq1 aggregates (26Salnikova A.B. Kryndushkin D.S. Smirnov V.N. Kushnirov V.V. Ter-Avanesyan M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8808-8812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Thus, interactions between Sup35 and Rnq1 occur at different levels of aggregation and may represent a regulatory component in yeast prion metabolism. Cross-seeded fibrillization has also been documented for other amyloidogenic proteins, i.e. hen lysozyme (27Krebs M.R. Morozova-Roche L.A. Daniel K. Robinson C.V. Dobson C.M. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 1933-1938Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), islet amyloid polypeptide, and Aβ-(1–40) (28O'Nuallain B. Williams A.D. Westermark P. Wetzel R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17490-17499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). In all cases of cross-seeding, a reduction of the lag in polymerization kinetics was observed and is proposed to be due to the templating effect of the heterologous seed at the initial rate-limiting step of the amyloid formation. Here we analyze the morphology of in vitro made aggregates formed by the prion domain of RnqPD in conjunction with the kinetics of their formation. Sup35NM and RnqPD aggregates can cross-seed each other, and our kinetic analyses of the lag phases in both reactions suggest that nucleation is the rate-limiting step in cross-seeded polymerization. Visualization of hybrid aggregates by electron microscopy argues that cross-seeding involves a direct interaction of Sup35NM and RnqPD, and this interaction is on-pathway, providing further support for the cross-seeding model of de novo prion appearance. Proteins—Recombinant His10-tagged Sup35NM, RnqPD, and full-length Rnq1 were overexpressed in Escherichia coli (BL21AI; Invitrogen) from the pJC45 expression vector (29Close J. Brandau S. Protein Expression Purif. 1994; 5: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) harboring the following inserts: SUP35-NM (1–762 bp; kind gift of S. Lindquist), RNQ-PD (395–1215 bp), and full-length RNQ1 (30Patel B.K. Liebman S.W. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; (in press)Google Scholar). Bacterial lysis was performed in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 8 m urea for 20 min at room temperature. Lysates were pre-cleared by centrifugation at 4000 × g for 15 min. Proteins were affinity-purified on two 1-ml nickel-Sepharose HisTrap™ columns (GE Healthcare) connected in series following the manufacturer's specifications. All solutions contained 8 m urea. Eluted protein was concentrated to 20–30 mg/ml in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 7 m guanidine HCl on an Ultrafree-15™ centrifugal filter (cutoff 10 kDa; Millipore), passed through an Ultrafree-0.5™ filter (cutoff 100 kDa; Millipore) to get rid of possible oligomeric forms, aliquoted, and stored at -70 °C. Kinetics of Polymerization—Reactions were done in a SpectraMax® M2 microplate reader (Molecular Devices) at 25 °C. The volume was 100 μl. The buffer was 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl (PBS). Protein concentrations are given in the figure legends. All polymerization reactions of RnqPD and full-length Rnq1 utilized the ability of the microplate reader to shake the microplate for 10 s every 5 min unless otherwise indicated. All Sup35NM polymerization reactions were done without agitation. To detect the initial increase in the kinetics of RnqPD polymerization, protein was added to microplate wells immediately before the first reading. When indicated, polymerization proceeded in the presence of the A11 anti-oligomer antibody (the kind gift of Charles Glabe and purchased from BIOSOURCE). The same amount of rabbit plasma nonspecific immunoglobulin G (Calbiochem) was added to the control reactions without A11. SDS-Agarose Gel Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—The assay was performed as described earlier (31Bagriantsev S. Kushnirov V.V. Liebman S.W. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 412: 33-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples containing 0.7–10 μg of protein were treated with 2% SDS for 7 min, separated on 1.5% agarose gels supplemented with 0.1% SDS, and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). Membranes were probed with 1:50,000 rabbit anti-Rnq antibody (type II (22Sondheimer N. Lindquist S. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 163-172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) with the use of a Western-Star™ immunodetection kit (Applied Biosystems). For molecular weight standards, we used chicken pectoralis extract that, upon Coomassie staining, reveals several abundant muscular proteins as follows: titin (∼3000 kDa), nebulin (∼750 kDa), and myosin heavy chain (∼200 kDa). Although this ladder cannot be used for a precise determination of molecular mass, it does provide an estimate. Transmission Election Microscopy—Sup35NM and RnqPD were polymerized in 1.7-ml polypropylene tubes in 300–600-μl PBS (see figure legends for protein concentrations). Agitation was ensured by rotation of the tube at about 50 rpm. Because of the different conditions used to make fibers when we analyzed the kinetics of polymerization (performed in a microplate) and those used to make larger amounts suitable for TEM samples (performed in Eppendorf tubes), we cannot definitively correlate the TEM time points with the kinetics monitored by ThT fluorescence. Steady-state aggregates made in a microplate looked the same as overnight aggregates made in a tube (Fig. 2E). For the morphological TEM analysis, 2 μl of reaction mixture were applied to copper Formvar carbon-coated slot grids (Electron Microscopy Sciences) for 90 s. Grids were washed four times with water, negatively stained in aqueous 2.0–2.5% uranyl acetate for 1 min, and again washed in water four times. For analyses of SDS-treated samples, 100 μl of polymerization reaction were diluted 10 times and incubated with 0.5% SDS for 7 min (10 × dilution was to prevent precipitation), pelleted for 10 min at 10,000 × g, and resuspended in 75 μlof PBS. The SDS was then removed on a Microspin chromatography column (Bio-Rad). As the eluate volume was about 100 μl, fibers were pelleted again and resuspended in 12 μl of PBS yielding enough fibers to make six grids. Grids were washed four times with water, negatively stained in aqueous 2.0–2.5% uranyl acetate for 1 min, and again washed in water four times. Immunostaining was performed in silicone staining plates (Electron Microscopy Sciences), and the volume of the drop on which the grid floated during all incubations and washes was 50–100 μl. Grids with immobilized fibers were incubated in 0.5% glycine in PBS for 15 min and normal goat serum (Electron Microscopy Sciences) for 30 min, stained with anti-Rnq antibody (type II (22Sondheimer N. Lindquist S. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 163-172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) diluted 1:1000 in PBS with 0.001% Tween 20 for 1 h, washed with PBS six times, stained with secondary 10 nm gold-conjugated antibody (Electron Microscopy Sciences) diluted 1:325 in PBS with 0.001% Tween 20 for 1 h, washed in PBS nine times, fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde in PBS for 5 min, washed with PBS once, washed with water once, negatively stained in aqueous 2.0–2.5% uranyl acetate for 1 min, and washed with water four times. Images were obtained on JEOL JEM-1220 transmission electron microscope, operating at 80 kV at a magnification of 25,000–100,000 and collected using a Gatan digital camera. RnqPD and Full-length Rnq1 Form Prion-like Aggregates in Vitro—To study the details of Rnq1 aggregation with respect to its role in prion-prion interactions in yeast, we focused on the QN-rich domain of unaltered Rnq1 (RnqPD; amino acids 132–405). RnqPD formed amyloid aggregates with sigmoidal kinetics as assayed by ThT fluorescence (Fig. 1, A and B) consistent with another study that used different conditions (30Patel B.K. Liebman S.W. J.

However, the addition of preformed RnqPD aggregates that serve as homologous seeds enables polymerization even below the threshold. The lag was shortened in proportion to the amount of seed added (Fig. 1B) and was eliminated only at very high concentrations of both RnqPD and seed (e.g. 35 μm and 8%). The lag duration in unseeded reactions exhibited a weak concentration dependence (as will be analyzed later in Fig. 4B) consistent with the nucleated polymerization model for amyloids (15Jarrett J.T. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Cell. 1993; 73: 1055-1058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1933) Google Scholar). A close-up of the initial portion of the kinetics of RnqPD polymerization reveals an immediate slight, but reproducible, enhancement in ThT fluorescence in both unseeded (Fig. 1C) and self-seeded (data not shown) reactions. This initial increase was followed by a plateau throughout the lag.FIGURE 4Sup35NM fibers cross-seed polymerization of RnqPD in vitro.

Douglass A. Vale R.D. Weissman J.S. Plos Biol. 2004; 2: 1583-1590Crossref Scopus (422) Google Scholar), there was a significant effect of shaking on the lag time of the RnqPD polymerization reaction. Indeed, no RnqPD polymerization was detected in the unshaken 10 μm reaction (data not shown) or in the 10 μm reaction shaken occasionally (Fig. 1A). More frequent shaking lowered the threshold concentration required for aggregation, e.g. 10 μm polymerized with a 3-h lag (Fig. 1D). Full-length wild-type Rnq1 also polymerized with a lag that could be shortened by seeding (supplemental Fig. S1A). However, a higher concentration of Rnq1 was needed to detect amyloid formation reliably, and the reaction had to proceed in the presence of 1.2 m NaCl. Many amyloidogenic proteins and peptides aggregate via oligomeric intermediates that can be recognized by a generic antibody (32Kayed R. Head E. Thompson J.L. McIntire T.M. Milton S.C. Cotman C.W. Glabe C.G. Science. 2003; 300: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (3470) Google Scholar). This antibody is reactive to the oligomeric structure, rather than to any motif in the amino acid sequence, and was shown previously to inhibit nonseeded, but not self-seeded, polymerization of Sup35NM (33Shorter J. Lindquist S. Science. 2004; 304: 1793-1797Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). We examined its effect on RnqPD, and the result was similar to that obtained for Sup35NM; only unseeded polymerization was inhibited (Fig. 1D). Another characteristic of prions is the SDS resistance of prion particles demonstrated for in vivo made prions of PrP (34Prusiner S.B. Groth D.F. Cochran S.P. Masiarz F.R. McKinley M.P. Martinez H.M. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 4883-4891Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), Sup35 (35Kryndushkin D.S. Alexandrov I.M. Ter-Avanesyan M.D. Kushnirov V.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49636-49643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar), and Rnq1 (25Bagriantsev S. Liebman S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51042-51048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In vitro made Sup35NM fibers were also shown previously to break, in 2% SDS at room temperature, into subparticles migrating slower than the monomer on agarose gels (31Bagriantsev S. Kushnirov V.V. Liebman S.W. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 412: 33-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined the effect of SDS treatment on our in vitro made RnqPD aggregates. Indeed, SDS-resistant RnqPD subparticles were revealed when polymerized RnqPD treated with 2% SDS was examined. In contrast, freshly dissolved RnqPD treated with 2% SDS migrated as a monomer and some low oligomeric forms (Fig. 1E). SDS-resistant subparticles were also observed when in vitro made aggregates of full-length Rnq1 were examined (supplemental Fig. S1B). Morphology of RnqPD Aggregates—To analyze the morphology of aggregated RnqPD, we used TEM. RnqPD aggregates were made in bulk in a vigorously agitated reaction mixture (see “Experimental Procedures”). Spherical species could be seen in the 0-min samples (Fig. 2A) that later co-associate in chains and networks abundant in the 90-min samples (Fig. 2B). This architecture of RnqPD aggregates remains essentially the same over-night (magnified image, Fig. 2E). The RnqPD content of these aggregates was confirmed by immuno-EM analysis using anti-RnqPD antibody and a 10-nm gold-conjugated secondary antibody (Fig. 2E). We could also see fibrous structures lying separately (Fig. 2C) or associated with spherical species (Fig. 2D)in the 90-min samples but with a lower frequency. Note that the electron density of these fibers was very low, and significant contrasting of images was needed to reveal them. Interestingly, no fibrous structures were found in the overnight samples even after exhaustive screening. To ask whether they completely disappeared by that late time point or whether they remained but were hidden among the large agglomerates, we treated over-night RnqPD aggregates with 0.5% SDS prior to TEM analysis. In these samples, fiber-like structures were observed in addition to the large agglomerates. These fibers were quite heterogeneous in morphology; they could be smooth (Fig. 2, F–H)or rough (Fig. 2I) and were composed of several filaments (Fig. 2, F and G) or one filament (Fig. 2H). The length of these fibers was in excess of 1 μm, which is larger than the diameter of non-treated RnqPD aggregates (ranging from 200 to 300 nm), suggesting that at least some of the aggregates resulted from supercoiling and/or co-association of fibers that was reversed by the SDS treatment. RnqPD Cross-seeds Sup35NM Polymerization—Previously, aggregates of altered full-length Rnq1 were shown to increase the initial rate of Sup35NM polymerization in a concentration-dependent manner as monitored by ThT fluorescence measured at dispersed time points (24Derkatch I.L. Uptain S.M. Outeiro T.F. Krishnan R. Lindquist S.L. Liebman S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 12934-12939Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Here we report a detailed kinetic analysis of cross-seeding using His-tagged wild-type RnqPD and a continuous ThT fluorescence assay. We now show that the addition of RnqPD aggregates is sufficient to shorten the lag phase of Sup35NM polymerization in a concentration-dependent manner but never eliminates it (Fig. 3A). Sup35NM was polymerized in an 8–12 μm reaction mixture using the conditions optimized earlier (see “Experimental Procedures”) (36Serio T.R. Cashikar A.G. Moslehi J.J. Kowal A.S. Lindquist S.L. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 649-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Next we analyzed the dependence of the lag phase on the concentration of Sup35NM at a fixed RnqPD:Sup35NM ratio in comparison to the unseeded reaction. Consistent with previous reports (16Serio T.R. Cashikar A.G. Kowal A.S. Sawicki G.J. Moslehi J.J. Serpell L. Arnsdorf M.F. Lindquist S.L. Science. 2000; 289: 1317-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar, 17Collins S.R. Douglass A. Vale R.D. Weissman J.S. Plos Biol. 2004; 2: 1583-1590Crossref Scopus (422) Google Scholar), the duration of the lag of unseeded polymerization of Sup-35NM weakly depended on the protein concentration (Fig. 3B). This was explained earlier by the nucleated conformational conversion model, according to which an oligomeric intermediate has to take on the amyloidogenic conformation prior to efficient fibrillization (16Serio T.R. Cashikar A.G. Kowal A.S. Sawicki G.J. Moslehi J.J. Serpell L. Arnsdorf M.F. Lindquist S.L. Science. 2000; 289: 1317-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). This conformational change is the rate-limiting step in the polymerization reaction (18Scheibel T. Bloom J. Lindquist S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2287-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) resulting in a lag weakly dependent on concentration (less than first order). We show here that the lag phase in the cross-seeded polymerization of Sup35NM is shortened upon increasing the Sup35NM concentration but also by less than a first order dependence (Fig. 3B). This implies that conformational conversion of a nucleus is required even in the cross-seeded reaction. In this case, the conformational conversion could be templated by the heterologous seed. The templating effect of RnqPD aggregates on Sup35NM polymerization was further demonstrated by the dependence of the lag duration on the extent of seed fragmentation; cross-seeding was efficient only if RnqPD aggregates were sonicated before they were used as seed. This effect depended on the level of sonication (Fig. 3C). Sup35NM Cross-seeds RnqPD Polymerization—Because aggregated RnqPD cross-seeds Sup35NM polymerization, we investigated the reciprocal reaction, i.e. the effect of Sup35NM fibers on RnqPD polymerization. Indeed, when RnqPD was polymerized in the presence of Sup35 fibers, the lag was shortened by increased levels of seed, and the plateau was higher than in the unseeded reaction (Fig. 4A). However, the lag in the cross-seeded reaction was never as short as in the self-seeded reaction, even at levels of up to 50% seed (data not shown). Fig. 4B describes the results of the kinetic analysis of polymerization of RnqPD similar to the one described above for Sup35NM polymerization (Fig. 3B). The lag phase in both unseeded and cross-seeded RnqPD reactions decreased weakly (less than first order) with increasing RnqPD concentrations (Fig. 4B; note that the cross-seeded reaction was performed at a fixed seed:monomer ratio). Cross-seeding was facilitated by sonication of Sup35N"

We demonstrate herein for the first time that highly selective sigma ligands inhibit volume-regulated chloride channels (VRCC) in small cell lung cancer and T-leukemia cells. Sigma ligands and VRCC blockers provoked a cell cycle arrest underlined by p27 accumulation. In stably sigma-1 receptor-transfected HEK cells, the proliferation rate was significantly lowered by sigma ligands when compared with control cells. Sigma ligands produced a strong inhibition of VRCC in HEK-transfected cells but not in control HEK. Surprisingly, the activation rate of VRCC was dramatically delayed in HEK-transfected cells in the absence of ligands, indicating that sigma-1 receptors per se modulate cell regulating volume processes in physiological conditions. Volume measurements in hypotonic conditions revealed indeed that the regulatory volume decrease was delayed in HEK-transfected cells and virtually abolished in the presence of igmesine in both HEK-tranfected and T-leukemic cells. Moreover, HEK-transfected cells showed a significant resistance to staurosporine-induced apoptosis volume decrease, indicating that sigma-1 receptors protect cancer cells from apoptosis.

Sigma receptors are intracellular proteins that were first postulated as opioid receptors on the basis of pharmacological and behavioral studies (1Martin W.R. Eades C.E. Thompson J.A. Huppler R.E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1976; 197: 517-532PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, 20 years of pharmacological studies and the cloning of the sigma-1 receptor subtype in 1996 revealed indeed that the “sigma-binding site” corresponded to a 24-kDa protein unrelated to other mammalian proteins and localized in the inner face of the plasma membrane and the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum and the nucleus (2Hanner M. Moebius F.F. Flandorfer A. Knaus H.G. Striessnig J. Kempner E. Glossmann H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8072-8077Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar, 3Jbilo O. Vidal H. Paul R.

Although high concentrations of neurosteroids have been shown to interact with brain sigma-1 receptors in behavioral studies (for review see Ref. 6Monnet F.P. Maurice T. J. Pharmacol. Sci. 2006; 100: 93-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), no high affinity endogene sigma ligand has been identified yet. Nonetheless, exogene compounds from disparate chemical classes ((+)-benzomorphans, cocaine, guanidines, and neuroleptics for example) have been characterized or developed as highly selective sigma ligands (7Hayashi T. Su T.P. CNS. Drugs. 2004; 18: 269-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The sigma-1 receptors are expressed in various tissues including the brain, the pituitary, and the liver (2Hanner M. Moebius F.F. Flandorfer A. Knaus H.G. Striessnig J. Kempner E. Glossmann H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8072-8077Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar, 8Alonso G. Phan V.

Surprisingly, very high levels of sigma receptors have been detected in tumor cells when compared with normal cells (11Aydar E. Onganer P. Perrett R. Djamgoz M.B. Palmer C.P. Cancer Lett. 2005; 242: 245-257Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 12Vilner B.J. John C.S. Bowen W.D. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 408-413PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, the expression of sigma receptors in cancer biopsies is correlated with the proliferating state of the cells so that these proteins are now commonly considered to be tumor biomarkers (13Simony-Lafontaine J.

Consequently, many sigma ligands are developed nowadays for imagery (positon emission tomography scan) to detect early stage tumors (15Van W.A. Buursma A.R. Hospers G.A. Kawamura K. Kobayashi T.

However, if sigma receptors represent exciting targets to detect cancers in vivo, very few data are available on both the function and the action mechanisms linked to these mysterious proteins in tumor cells. Previously, we and others have demonstrated that sigma-1 receptors were functionally coupled with membrane potassium channels in the pituitary (4Aydar E. Palmer C.P. Klyachko V.A. Jackson M.B.

We then demonstrated that the activation of sigma-1 receptors by highly selective ligands provoked the arrest of the cell cycle progression in the G1 phase in cancer cells. This effect was partly linked to the inhibition of voltage-dependent potassium channels (25Renaudo A. Watry V. Chassot A.A. Ponzio G. Ehrenfeld J. Soriani O. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

We demonstrate for the first time that the sigma-1 receptor modulates VRCC and cell volume regulation properties leading to alterations of cell proliferation and apoptosis mechanisms. Cell Culture—SCLC (NCI-H209) and leukemic Jurkat (JA3) cell lines were obtained from CLS (Heidelberg, Germany). The HEK cell line was a gift from Dr. F. Duprat (CNRS U 526, Sophia-Antipolis, France). All of the cell lines were grown at 37 °C with 5% of CO2 in RPMI 1640 supplemented with l-glutamine (2 mm), sodium-pyruvate (1 mm), penicillin/streptomycin (100 units/ml), and fetal-bovine serum (10% for SCLC and 5% for Jurkat). The medium was routinely changed three times a week for Jurkat cells and one time a week for SCLC cells. Dead cells were excluded by a Ficoll gradient separation technique (Lymphocyte separation medium; Bio-Whittaker, Verviers, Belgium). Drugs and Reagents—(+)-Pentazocine, DTG, NPPB, and poly-d-lysine were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Igmesine was a generous gift from Dr. F. Roman (Pfizer, Fresne, France). Anti-actin (A2066), anti-cyclin A (C4710), and secondary anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-coupled antibodies were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Santa Cruz anti-p27 (C-19) and anti-p21cip1 (C-19) antibodies were from TEBU International (Le Perray-en-Yvelines, France). Secondary anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-coupled antibodies (11-035-144; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) were purchased from Interchim (Montlucon, France). Electrophysiolology—For whole cell patch clamp recordings, the cells were plated on glass coverslips coated with poly-d-lysine (10 nm) and incubated for 2–4 h in RPMI 1640 medium. SCLC cells need to be mechanically dissociated before being plated. For SCLC and Jurkat cells, the patch clamp experiments were performed at room temperature with an external solution of the following composition: tetraethylammonium Cl, 140 mm; MgCl2, 2 mm; CaCl2, 1 mm; Hepes, 10 mm; glucose, 10 mm (pH adjusted to 7.4 with HCl, 309 mosm/liter). In this case, the hypotonic solution was obtained by omission of 20 mm of triethanolamine-Cl (269 mOsm). For HEK cells, the external solution composition was: NaCl, 140 mm; CaCl2, 2 mm; MgCl2, 2 mm; Hepes, 10 mm (pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH; 302 mOsm). The hypotonic solution was obtained by a ¼ dilution (226.5 mOsm). Soft glass patch electrodes (borosilicate glass capillaries GC150TF-7.5; Harvard Apparatus, Edenbridge, Kent) were made on a horizontal pipette puller (P-97; Sutter Instrument Co., Novato, CA) to achieve a final resistance ranging from 3 to 5 mΩ. The internal solution was of the following composition: CsCl, 134 mm; MgCl2, 2 mm; CaCl2, 1 mm; EGTA, 11 mm; Hepes, 10 mm (pH adjusted to 7.2 with CsOH, 298 mOsm). ATP (2 mm) and GTP (100 μm) were extemporaneously added to the internal solution. Electric signals were amplified with an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) and acquired on an IBM compatible personal computer with a DIGIDATA 1200 interface and pCLAMP 8 software (Axon Instruments). Cl– currents were recorded at a 5-kHz sampling frequency and filtred at 2 kHz. DTG was dissolved in methanol (final concentration of methanol < 0.1% (v/v)). (+)-Pentazocine was dissolved in methanol/acid (½ methanol + ½ HCl 0.1 m (v/v), final concentration of methanol < 0.1% v/v). Solvent alone had no effect on K+ currents at this concentration. Igmesine was dissolved in water. Sigma ligand solutions were administered in the vicinity of the cell under study through the use of a gravity-feed system (rate, ∼2 ml/mn). The excess of bathing solution was continuously aspired via a suction needle. Current amplitudes were determined with the pCLAMP 8 analysis software (Clampfit). Current/voltage and current/time relationships were fitted by using Microcal Origin analysis software (Sega, Paris, France). The quantitative data are expressed as the means ± S.E. Production of a HEK Cell Line Stably Overexpressing the Sigma-1 Receptor (HEK-SIG)—The human sigma-1 receptor (U75283) was inserted in the pCMV-Tag3 vector allowing a N-terminal protein fusion between the c-Myc tag and the receptor (Stratagene; generous gift from Dr. L. Combettes). 2 μg of DNA were transfected in HEK293 cells (300,000 cells/dish) using Jet PEI (Polyplus Transfection, Illkirch, France) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. 60 h latter, the medium was replaced by a medium containing the G418 antibiotic (2 μg/ml). The survival clones were scrapped and cultured in individual dishes. Microscopy—Micrographs were performed with a Zeiss axiovert microscope with a 63× oil lens coupled to a digital camera and the Zeiss analysis software. Control micrographs were performed in direct light. The nucleus was detected by fluorescence using Hoechst 33342 (100 ng/ml; Molecular Probe). The c-Myc-targeted sigma-1 receptors was detected by immunofluorescence by the use of an anti-Myc tag (Euromedex, France; dilution, 1/500); the secondary andibody was an anti-mouse TRITC conjugate (Sigma; dilution 1/500). Cell Growth Analysis—To assess cell growth, the cells were seeded at day 0 at a density of 0.25 × 106 cells/ml and counted 24, 48, and 72 h after incubation with NPPB or igmesine. For cell density evaluation, an aliquot of 25 μl of cell suspension was mixed with 25 μl of trypan blue, and the number of cells was counted using a Malassez chamber. Only viable cells (which excluded trypan blue) were counted. This enabled us to differentiate easily between a reduced cell proliferation rate and cell death. Western Blot—After 3 days of incubation with igmesine, (+)-pentazocine, DTG, or NPPB, the cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed under agitation in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm NaF, 0.1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm NaVO4, and a protease inhibitor mixture, Complete® (Roche Applied Science)). The lysate was then centrifuged (11,000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C), and the resulting supernatants were analyzed by immunoblotting. Total protein concentration was determined with a Bio-Rad protein assay with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Proteins (50 μg/lane) were resolved on a 13% acrylamide gel by SDS-PAGE, electrotransferred to nitrocellulose, blocked in 5% nonfat milk, and incubated overnight at 4 °C with a primary antibody directed against either p27 (1:200), p21cip1 (1/200), cyclin A (1:750), or actin (1:200) human proteins. The blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (anti-rabit, 1:15,000; anti-mouse, 1:50,000) for 1 h at room temperature. Labeled proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent, Interchim) using Kodak Bio-Max MR film (Sigma-Aldrich). Cell Volume Measurements—Cell volume was measured by an electronic sizing technique with a CASY 1 (SCARFE SYSTEM). The cells were suspended in CASYton solution (NaCl isotonic solution) for control condition and in 30% diluted CASYton solution in the absence or presence of sigma ligands or staurosporine. These solutions were adjusted to 290 (isotonic solution) or 230 mOsm (hypotonic solution). The values are expressed as percentages of cell volume variations measured during hypotonic shock in the presence or absence of ligand. Sigma Ligands Inhibit Hypotonic-activated Chloride Currents in SCLC and Jurkat Cells—The experiments were performed using the whole cell variant of the patch clamp technique. The cells were bathed in a Na+-free extracellular solution. The K+ currents were cancelled by replacing the intracellular K+ by Cs+ (see “Materials and Methods”). In isotonic conditions, no current could be detected in cells (Fig. 1A, upper panel). The application of an external hypotonic shock by manitol depletion induced the development of a sustained outwardly rectifying current with a reversal potential corresponding to the equilibrium potential for Cl– ions (E–Cl = 3 mV; Fig. 1, A and B). This current was sensitive to NPPB (100 μm; Fig. 1B), indicating that it corresponds to the VRCC described earlier (30Jirsch J.D. Loe D.W. Cole S.P. Deeley R.G. Fedida D. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C688-C699Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The current developed progressively to reach a stable value (Fig. 1C, left panel). The application of a specific sigma-1 receptor ligand such as igmesine (18Soriani O. Vaudry H. Mei Y.A. Roman F. Cazin L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 286: 163-171PubMed Google Scholar, 31Roman F.J. Pascaud X. Martin B. Vauché D. Junien J.L. J. Pharm. Pharmacol. 1989; 42: 439-440Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar) produced a reversible inhibition of the current in all tested cells (Fig. 1C, left panel). The inhibitory effect was dose-dependent and was mimicked by other sigma ligands such as DTG (Fig. 1D). The same type of experiments was next performed in jurkat cells. In this latter cell type, the application of a hypotonic shock also induced an outwardly rectifying current that presented a reversal potential corresponding to Cl– ion equilibrium potential (E–Cl = 3 mV; Fig. 2A). This current was inhibited by NPPB (not shown; see Ref. 32Nilius B. Sehrer J. Viana F. De G.C. Raeymaekers L. Eggermont J. Droogmans G. Pfluegers Arch. 1994; 428: 364-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and presented the same characteristics as previously described (33Ross P.E. Garber S.S. Cahalan M.D. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 169-178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In contrast to the VRCC observed in SCLC cells, which stabilized at a stable plateau value during the hypotonic shock, the current recorded in jurkat cells showed a noticeable decay after having reached maximum level (Fig. 2B). Consequently, we performed cell incubations with sigma ligands (30 min) rather than acute applications to detect a potential modulation of the current by the activation of sigma receptors. The maximum current densities were significantly lowered for cells challenged with either DTG, (+)-pentazocine, or igmesine (Fig. 2, B and C). Altogether, these results demonstrate for the first time that sigma ligands modulate chloride channels. We next wondered whether the pharmacological blockade of VRCC could provide the same effects as sigma ligands on SCLC and jurkat cell proliferation.FIGURE 2Sigma ligands inhibit VRCC in Jurkat cells. A, instantaneous I/V relationships obtained from a single Jurkat cell using voltage ramps (1 s). The currents were recorded before (Iso) and during a hypotonic shock (Hypo). B, evolution of the current density in response to a hypotonic shock in a nonincubated cell (Ctl) and in an igmesine-incubated cell (10 μm, 30 mn, Igm). In this latter case, igmesine was also present in the bath during the patch clamp recording. C, mean current density of the hypotonic-activated current at 80 mV in nonincubated cells (Ctl) and cells incubated with DTG (DTG, 10 μM), pentazocine (Ptz, 10 μm), or igmesine (Igm, 10 μm).

Watry V. Chassot A.A. Ponzio G. Ehrenfeld J. Soriani O. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2004; 311: 1105-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In the present study, we show that the incubation of jurkat cells with either igmesine (40 μm) or NPPB (100 μm) produces a strong inhibition of cell growth over 3 days (Fig. 3). Western blot analysis showed that the cell growth inhibition provoked by NPPB (100 μm) was accompanied by a clear cut increase in p27 and a strong decrease in cyclin A in both Jurkat and SCLC cells (Fig. 4). The same modulation of cell cycle-controlling proteins was also observed for cells challenged with igmesine (Fig. 4) and other sigma ligands (25Renaudo A. Watry V. Chassot A.A. Ponzio G. Ehrenfeld J. Soriani O. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2004; 311: 1105-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), suggesting a common pathway.FIGURE 4NPPB and igmesine modulate p27 and cycline A levels in SCLC and jurkat cells.

Actin levels were used as controls in each experiment. The cells were treated with either drug for three days. Immunoblottings show typical examples from three to eight independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Functional Expression of the Sigma-1 Receptor in HEK Cells—To verify whether the effects of sigma ligands on VRCC were attributable to a specific activation of sigma receptors and not to a direct action on chloride channels, we produced several stable HEK cell lines expressing the sigma-1 receptor (see “Materials and Methods”). When we established these different cell lines, no efficient antibodies directed against the sigma-1 receptor were available. So we expressed an N-terminal c-Myc-targeted human sigma receptor. This allowed us to detect the expression of sigma-1 receptors with an anti-c-Myc antibody (see “Materials and Methods”). Immunofluorescent micrographs show a strong fluorescent signal in HEK-expressing cells (HEK-SIG) when compared with control cells. The localization of the targeted sigma-1 receptor was diffuse in the cells with a predominant perinuclear labeling (Fig. 5). This result is in a good agreement with previous works that showed the presence of sigma receptors in the nucleus membrane, the endoplasmic reticulum, and the plasma membrane (3Jbilo O. Vidal H. Paul R. Nys N.De Bensaid M. Silve S. Carayon P. Davi D. Galiègue S. Bourrié B. Guillemot J.-C. Ferrara P. Loison G. Maffrand J.-P. Le Fur G. Casellas P. J. Biol.

Two of these clones were used to perform growth and patch clamp experiments. Sigma Ligands Reduce Proliferation and Inhibit the VRCC in HEK-SIG Cells—HEK cell proliferation rate was studied over 3 days. Cell incubation with igmesine (40 μm) had no significant effect on growth (Fig. 6, upper panel). Similarly, igmesine failed to slow down the growth of HEK cells expressing the vector without the insert encoding for the sigma-1 receptor. By contrast, HEK-SIG cell incubation with the same dose of igmesine (40 μm) significantly reduced the cell number after 3 days, demonstrating that igmesine modulates cell proliferation through the activation of the sigma-1 receptor (Fig. 6, lower panel). In a second set of experiments, we studied the effects of igmesine on VRCC in HEK and HEK-SIG cells using the patch clamp technique. Volume-activated chloride channels have been extensively described in HEK cells (35Helix N. Strobaek D. Dahl B.H. Christophersen P. J. Membr. Biol. 2003; 196: 83-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). As previously described, application of a hypotonic shock (40 mOsm) induced a slowly developing outwardly rectifying current presenting a reversal potential corresponding to the equilibrium potential for chloride anions (E–Cl = 6 mV; Fig. 7A). In the 11 tested cells, application of igmesine (10 μm) during the hypotonic shock produced either no effect at all on the current (n = 8; Fig. 7A) or a slight decrease in amplitude (n = 3; not shown). In contrast, igmesine produced a clear cut inhibition of VRCC in the two tested HEK-SIG clones (Fig. 7, B and C). This demonstrates that the effects of sigma ligands on the current are not the consequence of a direct and nonspecific effect on chloride channels but result in the functional coupling between of sigma-1 receptors and ion channels underlying VRCC. Sigma-1 receptors have been shown to be specifically overexpressed in tumors. No endogene ligand has been clearly determined yet, so it was interesting to investigate whether the sigma-1 receptor overexpression could produce any effect per se on the biophysical properties of VRCC. Sigma-1 Receptor Expression Alters VRCC Activation Properties in HEK Cells—We first analyzed the maximum current density achieved after a hypotonic shock (77 mOsm) in both HEK and HEK-SIG cells. No significant difference could be detected whatever the holding potential (see Fig. 8A for a comparison of the mean current densities at –80 mV for HEK and HEK-SIG cells). In a second analysis, we examined the activation kinetic of the current during a hypotonic shock in HEK-SIG compared with normal HEK (Fig. 8B). For each tested cell, the activation kinetic could be fitted by a Boltzmann function as previously described (36Marin M. Poret A. Maillet G. Leboulenger F. Foll Le. F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 334: 1266-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the time for half-maximum activation (To) was dramatically augmented in HEK-SIG cells. Additionally, a 2-fold increase in the curve slope (dx) could be observed in HEK-SIG cells (Table 1). Altogether, these results demonstrate for the first time that the expression of the sigma-1 receptor modulates VRCC functional properties.TABLE 1Kinetic properties of the VRCC activation in HEK and HEK-SIG cellsHEKHEK-SIGStudent's t testdx (pA-1·pF-1·s-1)97.16 ± 19.20201.3 ± 18.84p < 0.0005T½ (s)515.09 ± 90.93877.11 ± 69.34p < 0.005n1832 Open table in a new tab The regulation of cell volume through KCl and water leakage has been shown to be a central event in the control of cell cycle (G1/S volume set point) and apoptosis signaling pathways (apoptosis volume decrease (AVD)) (37Rouzaire-Dubois B.

Because cell volume regulation strongly involves VRCC, we next investigated the effects of sigma-1 receptor expression on cell volume regulation in both HEK and HEK-SIG cells.

Because CARPs are overexpressed in cancer and their silencing reduces cell viability and sensitizes tumor cells to chemotherapeutic agents, we investigated their relationship to p53 tumor suppressor signaling. p53 is a major determinant of chemosensitivity, and its levels are increased following DNA damage through N-terminal phosphorylation and inhibition of degradation. Although p53 is well known to be negatively regulated by several ubiquitin ligases including MDM2, none are known to target phosphorylated p53 for degradation. CARPs physically interact with and ubiquitinate p53, targeting it for degradation in the absence of MDM2. Serine 20-phosphorylated p53 is also ubiquitinated by CARPs.

El-Deiry W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6170-6175Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). CARP1 and CARP2 distinctively target apical death effector domain-containing caspases 8 and 10, but not 9, and are cleaved by active caspases 8 and 10 once the extrinsic cell death pathway is initiated and transduces a death signal (1McDonald III, E.R. El-Deiry W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6170-6175Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The CARP proteins share three highly conserved functional domains, FYVE (Fab1p, YOTB, Vac1P, and EEA1) (2Stenmark H. Aasland R. Toh B.H. D'Arrigo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24048-24054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), CID (Caspase-Interacting Domain), and RING (Really Interesting New Gene) (3Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2944) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1a). A point mutation of a catalytically essential histidine to an alanine in the RING finger domain abolishes CARP1 (His-342) or CARP2 (His-333) E3 ligase activity (1McDonald III, E.R. El-Deiry W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6170-6175Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1a). The cysteine and histidine residues in the CARP RING domains completely align with the RING consensus sequence (4Joazeiro C.A. Weissman A.M. Cell. 2000; 102: 549-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar). The characteristic residues of RING domains are conserved in both CARP1 and CARP2 and to a large extent with the RING domains of MDM2 (5Kubbutat M.H. Jones S.N. Vousden K.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (2860) Google Scholar), c-Cbl (6Waterman H. Levkowitz G. Alroy I. Yarden Y. J. Biol.

Science's STKE. 2005; 2005: 7Google Scholar). CARP proteins, especially the functional domains, are also markedly conserved across different organisms from human, mouse, and frog to Drosophila (1McDonald III, E.R. El-Deiry W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6170-6175Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Despite their many similarities, we show here that CARP1 and CARP2 are also functionally distinct. Compared with the canonical IAPs (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein), which contain BIR (Baculovirus IAP Repeat), CARD (Caspase Activation and Recruitment Domain), and RING motifs and inhibit caspases 3, 7, and 9, CARPs represent a new family of apoptosis inhibitors specifically targeting death effector domain-containing caspases for degradation. In the cascade of the apical cell death pathway, how CARPs are involved in the regulation of caspases 8 and 10 remains elusive. One possible role for CARPs may be in purging excess pro-caspases 8 and 10 that could otherwise be activated to cause cell death, because CARPs do not appear to control active caspases (1McDonald III, E.R. El-Deiry W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6170-6175Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Because CARP silencing by RNA interference significantly sensitizes cells to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis and inhibits cancer cell colony formation (1McDonald III, E.R. El-Deiry W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6170-6175Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that CARPs may be involved in regulation of p53. Chemotherapeutic agents cause DNA damage, which in turn stabilizes p53 via its well known post-translational modifications (8Bode A.M. Dong Z. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 793-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar). The basal level of p53 is maintained at very low levels due to the tight regulation of p53 by the E3 ligase MDM2 (9Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3750) Google Scholar). Other negative regulators of p53 that rely on RING domains include COP1 (10Dornan D. Wertz I.

Cell. 1993; 75: 495-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1993) Google Scholar). Because CARP silencing sensitizes cells to DNA damage, we hypothesized that CARPs may regulate tumor-suppressive events downstream of p53. Because CARPs act as E3 ligases to degrade caspases 8 and 10, we tested the ability of CARPs to degrade p53 protein. We observed that upon the knock down of gene expression of CARPs, p53 level becomes elevated, resulting in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Because CARPs act as ubiquitin protein ligases that target caspases 8/10, we speculated that CARPs could serve as E3 ligases to degrade p53 in a proteasome-mediated manner. Our results support this hypothesis and further identify a novel association between CARPs and p53 phosphorylated on N-terminal serines. Unlike MDM2 or other E3 ligases known to target p53, CARP1 and CARP2 appear to target phosphorylated p53 for ubiquitination and degradation. As such, CARP1 and CARP2 that are overexpressed in cancer may have oncogenic activity capable of eliminating stress-induced p53 protein that is normally refractory to MDM2-dependent proteolytic degradation. Cell Lines, Antibodies, and Reagents—Cell lines included in the present study were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (HeLa, SW480, MEF (p53/MDM2-/-, a generous gift from Dr. Stephen N. Jones, University of Massachusetts), Saos2, and 293), McCoy's 5A medium (HCT116, HCT116 (p53-/-), and U2OS), or RPMI1640 (H460 and H460-E6). Antibodies were purchased from Sigma (FLAG, FLAG-agarose and FLAG-horseradish peroxidase), Santa Cruz (GFP, p53-Fl-393, and DO1), R&D Systems (p53-Ser-15/20 and MDM2), Cell Signaling (p53-Ser-20), Calbiochem (p21-Ab-1), Roche Applied Science (anti-HA), BD Transduction Laboratories (Ran) and generated in the Cell Center at the University of Pennsylvania (CARP2 monoclonal antibody, 3A7B9). Proteasome inhibitors were chosen from Calbiochem (MG-132, lactacystin, and epoxomicin). Doses of chemotherapeutic agents were as follows: adriamycin (0.2 μg/ml), CPT11 (50 μm), etoposide (50 μm), and 5-fluorouracil (0.3 mm). Cycloheximide was used at 50 μg/ml. Doses of proteasome inhibitors were: MG-132 (10 μm), lactacystin (5 μm), and epoxomicin (0.5 μm). Plasmids and Adenoviruses—CARPs and mutants were constructed in vector pFLAG-CMV2 (Sigma) as described (1McDonald III, E.R. El-Deiry W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6170-6175Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Ad/His-MDM2 was constructed by a previously described method (20He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3256) Google Scholar). MDM2 cDNA was obtained by reverse transcription PCR from H460 cells and verified by sequencing. The open reading frame was inserted to pcDNA4/HisMax vector (Invitrogen) at the EcoRI and BamHI restriction sites to obtain a His6-tagged MDM2 cDNA. The fragment partially digested by HindIII and EcoRV from the plasmid pcDNA4/HisMax/MDM2, containing the QBI SP163 translational enhancer, polyhistidine (His6), and in-frame MDM2, was inserted into the pAdTrack-CMV vector at the corresponding sites. The pAdTrack-CMV/MDM2 construct was recombined with pAdEasy-1 (a generous gift from Bert Vogelstein) in Escherichia coli BJ5183 cells to get recombined pAD with the exogenous insert. The recombined adenovirus was replicated and amplified in 293 cells by transfection of the pAD plasmid DNA. The amplified viruses were purified by cesium chloride gradient ultracentrifugation and stored at -80 °C in a buffer containing 25% (v/v) glycerol, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 1 mm MgCl2. Ad-CARP1 or Ad-FLAG-CARP2 were made accordingly. Briefly, the full length of CARP1 or FLAG-tagged CARP2 coding sequence was cloned into the pAdTrack-CMV vector at the HindIII or KpnI site; after recombination screening, the recombinant plasmid pAD with the exogenous insert was obtained and then replicated and amplified in 293 cells before cesium gradient purification. Overexpression of CARPs and Other Proteins—Mammalian expression vectors were transiently transfected into human or mouse cells growing in 6-well plates or 10-cm dishes using Lipofectamine and Plus reagent (Invitrogen). At 24 h after transfection, cells were treated with chemotherapeutic agents for another 20 h or with proteasome inhibitor (MG-132, 10 μm) for 8-12 h or harvested without further treatments in 1× Laemmli sample buffer or co-immunoprecipitation buffer (30 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 1% Triton X-100 with 1× complete protease inhibitor plus 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Coimmunoprecipitation—Treated cells in plates or dishes were washed three times on ice with PBS, and then coimmunoprecipitation buffer was added and cell lysates were collected. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was freshly added to each sample at a final concentration of 1 mm, and cell lysates were rotated at 4 °C for 1 h. Lysates were cleared for 15 min at top speed in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C. The supernatant was precleared with mouse IgG-agarose or rabbit IgG-agarose (Sigma) for 1 h, followed by overnight immunoprecipitation with specific antibodies at 4 °C, and then immune complexes were precipitated with r-Protein G-agarose (Invitrogen). Ubiquitination of p53—Cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids in 6-well plates and grown overnight. Eight hours before harvesting cells, the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 was added to the growth medium. Cells were rinsed twice with Tris-buffered saline (TBS, 154 mm NaCl and 100 mm Tris, pH 7.5) and then lysed in the denaturing buffer (TBS, 1 mm EDTA and 1% SDS, pH 7.5). Cell lysates were denatured by heating at 100 °C for 10 min before being 10-fold diluted with co-immunoprecipitation buffer. The proper anti-p53 antibody (DO-1 or anti-phospho-p53-Ser-20) was added to the diluted cell lysates. The p53-antibody complex was allowed to form overnight and captured with protein A-agarose. The ubiquitinated p53 was assessed accordingly. Immunofluorescence of CARP2 and p53—Cells were transfected with the appropriate plasmids in 6-well plates and incubated overnight. Cells were then trypsinized and replated into 8-well chamber slides (Lab-Tek) and allowed to attach overnight. Cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS + 1 mm MgCl2 for 5 min, washed with PBS, and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min. Cells were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in 20% donkey serum (Sigma) in PBS-TB (PBS with 0.2% Triton X-100 and 0.1% bovine serum albumin). After washing the cells in PBS-TB, they were incubated for 2 h with primary antibody that was diluted in PBS-TB. Anti-FLAG (M2; Sigma) was diluted by 1:1000, and anti-p53 (FL-393; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was diluted by 1:2000. After washing the cells thoroughly in PBS-TB, the slides were incubated in either donkey anti-mouse-Cy3 or donkey anti-rabbit-Cy2 secondary antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch) at a 1:600 dilution for 1 h. The cells were washed with PBS-TB and then water and incubated for 1 min in a 1:50 K dilution of Hoechst 33258 (10 mg/ml; Molecular Probes) to visualize the nuclei. In Vitro Imaging Analysis—At 20 h after cells were transfected in 6-well plates with PG13-Luc and pRL-TK, the cells were replated into 96-well black plates (Fisher Scientific) and maintained for 1 h at 37°C in an incubator supplemented with 5% CO2 and 100% humidity before the substrates, D-luciferin (150 μg/ml as a substrate of firefly luciferase; Biotium) and native coelenterazine (10 μg/ml as a substrate of Renilla luciferase; Biotium) were added to different duplicate wells receiving the same treatment. The bioluminescence image was acquired using a cooled charge-coupled device camera in an in vivo imaging system (IVIS; Xenogen). The Renilla luciferase activity was used to normalize the readout for the firefly luciferase activity. Colony Formation Studies—Cells from several cell lines were treated with pSuper-puro-C1-424 and pSuper-puro-C2-861 as previously described (1McDonald III, E.R. El-Deiry W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6170-6175Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). At 24 h after transfection, cells were maintained in puromycin-containing medium (1.5 μg/ml) for 3 days, followed by serial dilution plating in 6-well plates. Colony formation was analyzed after 2-4 weeks by Coomassie Blue staining. To investigate whether CARPs interact with p53, wild-type (WT) CARP1 (C1), CARP2 (C2), RING domain-mutated CARP1-H342A (C1-342), or CARP2-H333A (C2-333) were exogenously co-expressed with p53 in H460 or HCT116 human tumor cells. Co-immunoprecipitation of p53 and CARPs was observed with WT CARP proteins, and this interaction was enhanced with mutated (mt) CARPs (Fig. 1b). In HCT116 cells, p53 co-immunoprecipitated with CARPs using the FLAG antibody (Fig. 1c); however, only an interaction of p53 with mt CARPs was observed when the lysates were immunoprecipitated with a p53 antibody. The proteasome inhibitor MG-132 stabilized and allowed the visualization of the interaction between WT CARP and p53 when the lysates were immunoprecipitated with a p53 antibody (Fig. 1d). The need to use a proteasome inhibitor to observe significant association between WT CARPs and p53 suggests that WT CARPs interact with p53 only transiently and this interaction may involve the E3 ligase activity. Because loss of E3 ligase activity enhances binding of CARPs to p53, this strongly suggests that stabilization of p53 that is a target of the E3 ligase activity of CARPs allows more easy detection of the complex. An endogenous interaction between the CARPs and p53 was examined using antibodies that we generated against CARP2. Endogenous p53 induced by adriamycin was immunoprecipitated with anti-p53 (full-393), and endogenous CARP2 was detected by immunoblotting with anti-CARP2 monoclonal antibody. CARP2, but not IgG, co-immunoprecipitated with p53, demonstrating that endogenous CARP2 interacts with endogenous p53 (Fig. 1e). Because MDM2 is a major regulator and interacting protein of p53, the effect of MDM2 on the interaction of CARPs and p53 was examined. p53-/-, MDM2-/- mouse embryo fibroblast (MEF) cells were co-transfected with p53 and C1, C2, C1-342, or C2-333, and cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG (m2) and immunoblotted with anti-p53 (Fig. 1f). Transfected p53 co-immunoprecipitated more with mt CARPs, as compared with WT CARPs, consistent with what was observed for overexpressed proteins in H460 cells (Fig. 1b). These results indicate that CARPs can interact with p53 independently of MDM2. To map the domain on CARPs implicated in binding with p53, several deletion mutants of CARPs were generated and tested in co-immunoprecipitation experiments. The mutants included CARP1 C terminus (C1-C), CARP1 N terminus (C1-N), CARP1 with RING domain deletion (C1-ΔRING), CARP1 with deletion of the first 115 amino acid residues in the N terminus (C1-Δ1-115), and CARP2 with RING domain deletion (C2-ΔRING) in addition to C1 and C2 (all FLAG tagged, Fig. 1g). Overexpressed C1, C1 mutants, C2, and C2 mutants interacted efficiently with p53 with the exception of C1-ΔRING and C1-N, and especially C2-ΔRING. It is clear that C1-ΔRING binds less well to p53 than full-length CARP1, whereas in the case of the C2-ΔRING there is no detectable interaction with p53. These results suggest that the RING domain on CARP1 is at least partially involved in the binding of CARP1 to p53 whereas the RING domain of CARP2 appears to be essential for interaction of CARP2 with p53. (Fig. 1h). The RING domain functions as a molecular scaffold to bring together the E2 and substrates to enhance ubiquitylation (15Borden K.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 1103-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Therefore, binding of p53 to the RING domain of CARPs may be necessary in regulation of p53 degradation. Exogenously expressed CARP2 colocalized with p53 in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus (Fig. 1i). As a potent tumor suppressor, p53 is highly mutated in a variety of cancers (16Olivier M. Hussain S.P. Caron de Fromentel C. Hainaut P. Harris C.C. IARC Sci. Publ. 2004; 157: 247-270PubMed Google Scholar) and inactivated in most other cancers (8Bode A.M. Dong Z. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 793-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar). Because other RING domain-containing proteins such as MDM2 (9Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3750) Google Scholar), Pirh2 (13Leng R.P. Lin Y. Ma W. Wu H. Lemmers B. Chung S. Parant J.M. Lozano G. Hakem R. Benchimol S. Cell. 2003; 112: 779-791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar), and COP1 (10Dornan D. Wertz I. Shimizu H. Arnott D. Frantz G.D. Dowd P. O'Rourke K. Koeppen H. Dixit V.M. Nature. 2004; 429: 86-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar) are p53-interacting proteins that down-regulate p53, we examined the possibility that CARPs might also negatively regulate p53. Overexpressed C1 and C2, but not C1-342 or C2-333, degraded exogenously expressed p53 in a series of p53-null cells including p53-/-, MDM2-/- MEFs (Fig. 2a), p53-/- HCT116, or Saos-2 cells in a WT CARP dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2b). Wild-type CARPs, rather than RING domain point mutants, also decreased the steady-state levels of endogenous p53 in U2OS in a WT CARP dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 2c). In Fig. 1, b, c, and f, the lack of an observed difference in the decrease in p53 protein levels between WT and mt CARPs was probably due to overexpression of p53 in order to increase co-immunoprecipitation efficiency, and likely saturation of the proteasome (17Sui G. el Affar B. Shi Y. Brignone C. Wall N.R. Yin P. Donohoe M. Luke M.P. Calvo D. Grossman S.R. Shi Y. Cell. 2004; 117: 859-872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). To gain further insight into the mechanism of CARP-mediated reduction of p53 protein levels in cells, overexpressed CARP1 and CARP2 reduced endogenous p53 levels in cycloheximide-treated H460 cells. Thus CARP expression led to a reduction in the stability of p53, showing that CARPs actively facilitate the turnover of p53 protein (Fig. 2d). Moreover, knock down of endogenous CARP2 markedly prolonged the stability of the endogenous p53 protein in cycloheximide-treated PA-1 cells (Fig. 2e). Knock down of C1 and C2 also led to a significant increase in adriamycin- or etoposide-induced p53 levels (Fig. 2f). These data suggest that CARPs down-regulate p53 by interacting with and then potentially targeting p53 for degradation. Given that CARP levels are negatively correlated with p53 protein levels, independent of MDM2 (Fig. 2a), it is possible that CARPs induce p53 degradation through a post-translational mechanism. To test this hypothesis, several cell lines were used to examine CARP-mediated changes in exogenous or endogenous p53 protein levels. p53-/-, MDM2-/- MEFs were transfected with C1, or C2, or C1-ΔRING, or C2-ΔRING and treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 (Fig. 3a). The addition of the proteasome inhibitor was found to considerably increase the level of p53 protein, which was previously reduced by the transfection of C1 or C2. In addition, the proteasome inhibitor elevated the level of endogenous p53 protein reduced otherwise by exogenously expressed C1 or C2 in H460 cells (Fig. 3b). The inhibitors epoxomicin and lactacystin enhanced the level of 5-fluorouracil-induced p53 protein otherwise degraded by exogenously expressed C1 or C2 in HCT116 cells (Fig. 3c). The enhanced binding capability of the CARP RING domain mutants to p53 as compared with the full-length CARP proteins (Fig. 1, b and f) suggested that the intact RING domains might confer upon C1 or C2 an E3 ubiquitin ligase activity with p53 as a potential substrate. To verify the involvement of proteasome-mediated degradation of p53 by CARPs, MG-132 was applied and interaction between CARPs and p53 was tested. Inhibition of the 26 S proteasome increased the amount of p53 protein bound to C1 or C2 as compared with controls without MG-132 in HeLa cells (Fig. 3d). This enhancement was not observed in C1-342 or C2-333 in H460 cells (Fig. 3e). These data indicate that CARPs direct p53 degradation through the proteasomal pathway. In Fig. 3e, MG132 had a marginal effect on p53 levels in whole cell extracts, probably due to overexpression of p53 in order to increase co-immunoprecipitation of p53, and saturation of the proteasome (17Sui G. el Affar B. Shi Y. Brignone C. Wall N.R. Yin P. Donohoe M. Luke M.P. Calvo D. Grossman S.R. Shi Y. Cell. 2004; 117: 859-872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). To ascertain whether CARP-mediated degradation of p53 by the proteasome is a direct consequence of p53 ubiquitination, p53-null HCT116 cells were transfected with p53, HA-ubiquitin, WT CARPs, or RING domain-mutated CARPs (Fig. 3f). In addition, wild-type p53-expressing H460 and HCT116 cells were transfected with HA-ubiquitin, WT CARPs, or RING domain-mutated CARPs (Fig. 3g). Immunoprecipitation with anti-p53 under denaturing conditions and immunoblotting with anti-HA revealed that co-transfection of WT, but not mt CARPs, targets p53 ubiquitination via the proteasome for degradation. In Fig. 3f, reblotted polyubiquitin p53 ladders were induced only by WT CARPs, but not mt CARPs, further confirming that CARP targets the ubiquitination of p53. These data demonstrate that CARPs act as E3 ligases for p53. It is clear that CARPs target p53 for degradation through the proteasomal pathway, independent of MDM2. Because MDM2 is not able to degrade p53 phosphorylated at serine 20 (phospho-p53ser20), to distinguish the ability of CARPs from MDM2 to possibly down-regulate phospho-p53 the interaction between CARPs and phospho-p53 at Ser-20 was investigated. SW480 cells expressing stable endogenous mutant p53 were transfected with FLAG-tagged C1, C1-342, C2, or C2-333, followed by the addition of adriamycin for 20 h, immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG, and immunoblotting with anti-phospho-p53ser20 (Fig. 4a). More phospho-p53 was immunoprecipitated in the presence of transfected C1-342 or C2-333 as compared with C1 or C2, reminiscent of the preferential immunoprecipitation of transfected p53 by CARP mutants (Fig. 1, b and f). To investigate the possibility that CARPs mediate ubiquitination of phospho-p53ser20, wild-type p53-expressing HCT116 cells were transfected with HA-ubiquitin, and C1, or C1342, or C2, or C2-333, followed by adriamycin-induced p53 phosphorylation, immunoprecipitation under denaturing conditions with anti-phospho-p53ser20, and immunoblotting with anti-HA (Fig. 4b). Phospho-p53ser20 was ubiquitinated only in the presence of C1 or C2, not C1-342 or C2-333, indicating that CARPs target phospho-p53ser20 for degradation via the proteasome by ubiquitination, rather than by dephosphorylation. Neither RING nor HECT (3Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2944) Google Scholar) type E3 ligase has been previously demonstrated to recognize and ubiquitinate phospho-p53 for degradation, including MDM2, COP1, Pirh2, or E6/E6-AP. To determine the effect of CARP overexpression on degradation of phospho-p53ser20, H460 cells were infected with adenovirus expressing GFP, CARP1, CARP2, or MDM2 treated with CPT11 and immunoblotted with anti-phospho-p53ser20 (Fig. 4c). Not only were p53 levels in whole cell extracts significantly affected by CARP expression but overexpression of CARPs also markedly reduced the level of phospho-p53ser20, whereas MDM2 stabilized phospho-p53ser20, presumably due to degradation of endogenous CARP2 by overexpressed MDM2. 3W. Yang and W. S. El-Deiry, unpublished observations. To further verify the notion that CARP targets phospho-p53ser20 for degradation rather than dephosphorylation, U2OS cells were infected and CPT-11 treated, followed by Me2SO or proteasome inhibitor MG-132 administration before immunoblotting with anti-phospho-p53ser20 (Fig. 4c). MG-132 stabilized the level of phospho-p53ser20, which is otherwise degraded by overexpressed CARP protein, again indicating that CARPs degrade phospho-p53ser20 through a proteasome-mediated pathway rather than dephosphorylation. To further support the notion of CARP-dependent downregulation of phospho-p53 at serine 20, H460 cells and the indicated adenoviruses were used. In the last 12 h, cycloheximide was administered at indicated time points to inhibit cellular protein translation. Wild-type CARPs, rather than control and MDM2, significantly facilitated the degradation of phospho-p53ser20 (Fig. 4d). To assess the ability of endogenous CARPs to negatively regulate phospho-p53ser20 in a chemo-induced setting, five different human cancer cell lines expressing wildtype p53 protein were treated with adriamycin for 20 h before immunoblotting with anti-phospho-p53ser20 or anti-CARP2 (Fig. 4e). PA-1 cells with the lowest level of CARP2 proteins revealed the highest level of phospho-p53ser20. U2OS, MCF7, and HCT116 cells showed relatively higher levels of CARP2 as compared with PA1 and their phospho-p53ser20 levels were low. H460 cells with the highest level of CARP2 proteins showed lower levels of phospho-p53ser20 as compared with PA1 cells. PA-1 and H460 cells plated at the same density were treated with adriamycin for 20 h followed by drug-free growth for 24 h and were stained with Coomassie Blue (Fig. 4e). PA-1 cells were more sensitive to adriamycin than H460 cells, consistent with the possibility that CARPs might serve to control the turnover of phospho-p53ser20 proteins in the stressed cells. If phospho-p53ser20 proteins are too high for CARP proteins, cell growth could be inhibited because p53 signaling is active. These data indicate that CARPs can ubiquitinate and degrade phospho-p53ser20. Our data demonstrate that CARPs negatively regulate p53 by ubiquitination and degradation via the proteasome. To confirm CARP-mediated down-regulation of p53 function, the effect of CARP overexpression on p53-dependent transactivation was assessed. A p53-driven reporter plasmid PG13-Luc and p53 were co-expressed in U2OS cells, along with C1, C1-342, C2, or C2-333 (Fig. 5a). Only wild-type CARPs inhibited luciferase activity, comparable with the effect of the control vector lacking the p53 cDNA (p53 vector). This inhibition was confirmed by using live cell imaging, showing much weaker intensity of luciferase bioluminescence in WT CARPs as compared with mt CARPs (Fig. 5a). The co-transfection of CARPs significantly reduced p53-mediated transactivation from the p53-regulated promoter. To confirm that accumulation of p53 by CARP knock down could inhibit colony formation, H460 cells or H460-E6 cells (p53 is degraded by human papillomavirus E6 in H460-E6) were transfected with empty vector, or C1-424 (expressing shRNA targeting C1), or C2-861 (expressing shRNA targeting C2) and selected with puromycin. In H460 cells, ablation of C1 or C2 inhibited colony formation, but this was not observed in H460-E6 cells. Selected H460 cells were lysed, immunoblotted with anti-p53, or MDM2, or p21 (Fig. 5b). After knock down of CARPs, p53 accumulated, which in turn stimulated p21 and MDM2 expression, leading to activation of p53 signaling and cell growth arrest. In addition, depletion of CARP2 in H460 cells caused a considerable increase in the G1/S ratio but failed to have any effect in p53-null H1299 cells (Fig. 5c), indicating that a p53-dependent G1 arrest occurred. The Western blots confirm that C2 RNA interference increased p53 and p21 expression in H460 but not H1299 cells (Fig. 5c). These data indicate that CARPs can negatively regulate p53 function in transactivation and induce cell cycle arrest. Our previous report demonstrated that down-regulation of CARP expression sensitizes cells to apoptosis (1McDonald III, E.R. El-Deiry W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6170-6175Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar); however, the underlying mechanism was not clear because knock down of CARP expression did not affect the steady-state levels of endogenous pro-caspase 8 or 10. Our data in the present study support the notion that CARP functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase directly targeting p53 for degradation. Knock down of CARPs under either basal conditions or DNA-damaging stresses significantly stabilizes endogenous p53, which in turn triggers the downstream signaling pathways to inhibit cell growth. Without MDM2, CARPs are able to target p53 toward degradation, showing that CARPs independently act on p53 degradation. Our results suggest that the CARP-mediated pro-apoptotic effect may be accounted for by CARPs acting as E3 ligases for p53 and CARP inactivation directly affects p53 turnover. Overall, our results add a new layer of p53-negative regulation. How these negative regulators hierarchically incorporate the regulatory function toward efficacy of p53 proteins still remains to be elucidated. Our studies provide novel insight into the function of the CARP protein family in negative regulation of p53 phosphorylated at serine 20, which is otherwise stabilized due to a disruption of the MDM2-p53 complex (18Chehab N.H. Malikzay A. Stavridi E.S. Halazonetis T.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13777-13782Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 19Unger T. Juven-Gershon T. Moallem E. Berger M. Vogt Sionov R. Lozano G. Oren M. Haupt Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1805-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). CARPs in addition share the same ability with MDM2, Pirh2, and COP1 to control the turnover of p53. Because the efficiency of phospho-p53ser15 immunoprecipitated by CARPs is RING domain dependent, 3W. Yang and W. S. El-Deiry, unpublished observations. it is possible that CARPs also target phospho-p53 at serine 15 for degradation via the proteasome by ubiquitination. These novel regulatory functions of CARPs impact on p53 function and may have relevance to tumor suppression and therapeutic design."

Toward the goal of dissecting its multiple biological functions, here we describe the biochemical properties of Saccharomyces cerevisiae pol δ with a methionine replacing conserved leucine 612 at the polymerase active site. Compared with wild type pol δ, L612M pol δ has normal processivity and slightly higher polymerase specific activity. L612M pol δ also has normal 3′ exonuclease activity, yet it is impaired in partitioning mismatches to the exonuclease active site, thereby reducing DNA synthesis fidelity. Error rates in vitro for L612M pol δ are elevated for both base substitutions and single base deletions but in a highly biased manner. For each of the six possible pairs of reciprocal mismatches that could arise during replication of complementary DNA strands to account for any particular base substitution in vivo (e.g. T-dGMP or A-dCMP for T to C transitions), L612M pol δ error rates are substantially higher for one mismatch than the other. These results provide a biochemical explanation for our observation, which confirms earlier genetic studies, that a haploid pol3-L612M S. cerevisiae strain has an elevated spontaneous mutation rate that is likely due to reduced replication fidelity in vivo.

DNA polymerase δ (pol δ), 2The abbreviation used is: pol δ, polymerase δ. one of four eukaryotic B family polymerases, is required for replicating the nuclear genome and also synthesizes DNA during recombination, mismatch repair, and excision repair of DNA damage (1Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Adv. Protein Chem. 2004; 69: 137-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Although complete disruption of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae POL3 gene encoding pol δ is lethal, conditional pol3 alleles have effectively been used to probe several functions of pol δ in vivo. For example, studies using pol3 alleles that inactivate the intrinsic 3′ exonuclease activity of pol δ but leave the polymerase activity intact have provided important insights into the contribution of the 3′ exonuclease of pol δ to proofreading of replication errors (2Morrison A.

These studies add to growing evidence (for review, see Ref. 6Garg P. Burgers P. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2005; 40: 115-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) that pol δ participates in lagging strand replication. To better understand where and when pol δ and other eukaryotic B family DNA polymerases operate during replication of large and complex nuclear genomes, we have been searching for new alleles of DNA polymerases that retain robust replicative capacity while also generating a mutator phenotype in cells due to reduced DNA synthesis fidelity. Identifying polymerases with reduced fidelity has been facilitated by elegant structural information. For example, numerous studies (e.g. for review, see Ref. 7Kunkel T.A. Bebenek K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 497-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar) have shown that non-conservative replacements of conserved amino acids in the nascent base pair binding pockets of many DNA polymerases can reduce their fidelity, albeit often with concomitant reduction in catalytic efficiency. In addition to simply having lower fidelity, an ideal property for assigning a polymerase to a particular DNA transaction in vivo would be a distinctive error specificity that generates a specific mutational signature. We were encouraged that mutator polymerases with distinctive error signatures could be constructed by the observation that an amino acid substitution in the nascent base pair binding pocket of the large Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I (E710A) not only reduced fidelity but did so only for a subset of the 12 possible single base-base mismatches (8Minnick D.T. Bebenek K. Osheroff W.P. Turner Jr., R.M. Astatke M. Liu L. Kunkel T.A. Joyce C.M. J. Biol.

A. 2002; 99: 1194-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). For example, E710A Klenow polymerase was 75-fold less accurate than the wild type polymerase for errors involving A-dCMP mismatches, but it retained normal fidelity for errors involving T-dGMP mismatches (9Minnick D.T. Liu L. Grindley N.D. Kunkel T.A. Joyce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1194-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Glu-710 of Klenow polymerase is located in the highly conserved sequence motif A, which along with motifs B and C form the polymerase active site. Motif A is conserved in multiple polymerases, including B family enzymes like pol δ, and its homologs, pol α, pol ϵ, and pol ζ and bacteriophage T4 and RB69 pols. Interestingly, the crystal structure of RB69 pol (10Franklin M.C. Wang J. Steitz T.A. Cell. 2001; 105: 657-667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar) revealed that Tyr-416 in motif A occupies a position in the polymerase active site (Fig. 1A) that is structurally similar to that of Glu-710 of Klenow polymerase, which when mutated reduced fidelity for some but not all mismatches, as described above. On that basis, in a previous study we replaced the homologous tyrosine residues in S. cerevisiae pol α, pol δ, pol ϵ, and pol ζ (Fig. 1B) with alanine and constructed haploid yeast strains with each of these four mutant polymerase alleles. The phenotypes of these strains (11Pavlov Y.I. Shcherbakova P.V. Kunkel T.A. Genetics. 2001; 159: 47-64PubMed Google Scholar) strongly suggested that these mutant polymerases all had significantly reduced catalytic activity. The strongest phenotype was for the Y613A mutant of yeast pol δ, which resulted in lethality. This is consistent with the major role that pol δ plays in replicating the nuclear genome, and the inference that Tyr-416 in RB69 pol is critical for efficient catalysis because it directly interacts with and properly positions the correct incoming dNTP (Fig. 1A). More recently, we have turned our attention to the immediately adjacent leucine residue. In RB69 pol (Fig. 1A), this leucine (Leu-415) does not directly interact with the dNTP, but it does interact with Tyr-416. We reasoned that if the homologous residue in yeast pol δ (Leu-612) was replaced with a somewhat conservative amino acid, this might indirectly reduce fidelity without strongly reducing polymerase activity. This prediction was partly based on seminal studies of B family polymerases from three other laboratories. The first studies were of the B family homolog T4 pol, where substituting conserved Leu-412 with methionine resulted in phage with a normal DNA synthesis rate but a modest mutator phenotype (12Reha-Krantz L.J. Nonay R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5635-5643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purified L412M enzyme had normal polymerase activity except that it was more sensitive than wild type T4 pol to inhibition by phosphonoacetic acid, a pyrophosphate analog (12Reha-Krantz L.J. Nonay R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5635-5643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, although L412M T4 pol retains normal 3′ exonuclease activity, this mutant was less efficient in proofreading due to a defect in partitioning between the polymerase and exonuclease active sites (12Reha-Krantz L.J. Nonay R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5635-5643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Beechem J.M. Otto M.R. Bloom L.B. Eritja R. Reha-Krantz L.J. Goodman M.F.

The second studies were of yeast pol α, where an L868M mutant was found to have normal polymerase specific activity (3Pavlov Y.I. Frahm C. Nick McElhinny S.A. Niimi A. Suzuki M. Kunkel T.A. Curr.

Kool E.T. Nishiyama Y. Suzuki M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2734-2746Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Yeast strains harboring this pol α mutant allele had elevated spontaneous mutation rates that were strongly enhanced by inactivating mismatch repair (15Niimi A. Limsirichaikul S. Yoshida S. Iwai S. Masutani C. Hanaoka F. Kool E.T. Nishiyama Y. Suzuki M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2734-2746Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), indicating reduced replication fidelity in vivo. The mutator effect of the pol α L868M mutant allele was also strongly elevated by inactivating the 3′ exonuclease activity of pol δ (3Pavlov Y.I. Frahm C. Nick McElhinny S.A. Niimi A. Suzuki M. Kunkel T.A. Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 202-207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), suggesting that the 3′ exonuclease activity of pol δ may excise errors made by pol α, a type of extrinsic proofreading (16Nick McElhinny S.A. Pavlov Y.I. Kunkel T.A. Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 958-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 17Albertson T.M. Preston B.D. Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 209-211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The third, and most recent studies were published after we initiated this work and reported the phenotypes of yeast strains harboring mutant alleles of pol δ containing replacements for Leu-612. One study (18Li L. Murphy K.M. Kanevets U. Reha-Krantz L.J. Genetics. 2005; 170: 569-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) showed that the pol3-L612M strain is very sensitive to phosphonoacetic acid, is nonviable in the absence of RAD27, and has an elevated spontaneous mutation rate that is strongly enhanced when mismatch repair is inactivated. Another very extensive study (19Venkatesan R.N. Hsu J.J. Lawrence N.A. Preston B.D. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4486-4494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) reported the phenotypes conferred by different substitutions for Leu-612. Of the 19 possible amino acid replacements for Leu-612, 8 pol3-L612X strains were viable, but their sensitivities to treatment with hydroxyurea and methylmethane sulfonate, their cell cycle behavior, their cellular morphology, and their effect on spontaneous mutagenesis varied over a wide range. Among the eight alleles examined, the phenotypes of the pol3-L612M strain were most similar to the wild type strain, with the exception that the spontaneous mutation rate was elevated 7-fold, suggesting reduced replication fidelity in vivo (19Venkatesan R.N. Hsu J.J. Lawrence N.A. Preston B.D. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4486-4494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Collectively, the studies described above predict that yeast pol δ containing the L612M amino acid replacement should have several biochemical properties: it should retain robust polymerization activity and normal 3′ exonuclease activity but have reduced DNA synthesis fidelity and impaired partitioning of mismatched termini between the polymerase and 3′ exonuclease active sites. One objective of the present study was to test these four predictions, all of which are fulfilled. Given its high catalytic efficiency and reduced fidelity, a second objective was to determine the error specificity of L612M pol δ in detail toward the goal of identifying an informative mutator polymerase for in vivo studies. Fortuitously, the L612M mutant of pol δ not only retains high catalytic activity, it also has a distinctive error signature. Materials—Yeast replication protein A, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, and replication factor C were purified from E. coli overproducing strains as described (20Henricksen L.A. Umbricht C.B. Wold M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11121-11132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Ayyagari R. Gomes X.V. Gordenin D.A. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1618-1625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The three forms of pol δ (wild type, L612M, and 5-DV) were overexpressed and purified as previously described (22Fortune J.M. Stith C.M. Kissling G.E. Burgers P.M. Kunkel T.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 4335-4341Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). All materials for the fidelity assay were from previously described sources (23Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 217-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 24Shcherbakova P.V. Pavlov Y.I. Chilkova O. Rogozin I.B. Johansson E. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43770-43780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Construction of the Pol δ L612M Mutant—The pol3-L612M mutation was introduced into plasmid pBL335 (Bluescript, 2 μm ori, TRP1, M13 ori, GAL1–10 GST-POL3) by site-directed mutagenesis. The identity of the entire pol3-L612M gene was verified by sequencing. L612M pol δ was overproduced in yeast and purified exactly as described for the wild type enzyme (22Fortune J.M. Stith C.M. Kissling G.E. Burgers P.M. Kunkel T.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 4335-4341Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Because of the presence of a glutathione S-transferase fusion to the N terminus of L612M pol δ encoded on plasmid pBL335-L612M, the mutant enzyme could be purified free from chromosomally encoded wild type pol δ through glutathione-affinity chromatography. After affinity purification, the tag was removed proteolytically, and L612M pol δ was further purified by Mono S chromatography as described (22Fortune J.M. Stith C.M. Kissling G.E. Burgers P.M. Kunkel T.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 4335-4341Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Measurements of Polymerase-specific Activity—The reaction mixture (60 μl) contained 20 mm Tris (pH 7.8), 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 90 mm NaCl, 16.5 nm [α-32P]dCTP, 100 μm concentrations of each cold dNTP, 8 mm magnesium acetate, and 1.5 μg of activated calf thymus DNA (GE Healthcare). Reactions were initiated by adding 5 nm wild type or L612M pol δ. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 30 °C, and time points were stopped after 1, 2, 5, and 10 min by adding EDTA to 20 mm. Duplicate samples were processed for incorporation by adding 0.5 ml of 10% trichloroacetic acid. After a 10-min incubation on ice, acid-precipitable material was collected by filtration through Whatman GF/C filters. The filters were rinsed 3 times with 5 ml of 5% trichloroacetic acid, 1% sodium pyrophosphate and once with 5 ml of ethanol, dried, and counted in scintillation fluid. Measurements of Polymerase and Exonuclease Activities—The substrate used for primer extension analysis (Fig. 2A) was generated by annealing a 32P-labeled primer strand (5′-GTAACGCCAGGGTTTTCTCA-3′) to a template strand (5′-ACGTCGTGACTGAGAAAACCCTGGCGTTACCCA-3′). Reactions (10 μl) were performed with 1000 fmol (100 nm) of DNA substrate in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.8), 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 90 mm NaCl, 8 mm magnesium acetate, and 100 μm concentrations of each dNTP. Reactions were initiated by the addition of 2 fmol (0.2 nm) of polymerase and transfer to 30 °C. Time points were stopped after 1, 3, and 5 min by the addition of an equal volume of formamide loading dye and were analyzed by electrophoresis on a denaturing 12% polyacrylamide gel. Products were detected and quantified using a PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare). The substrate used for analysis of single-stranded exonuclease activity (Fig. 2B) was a 32P-labeled primer strand (5′-GTAACGCCAGGGTTTTCTCG-3′). Reactions were performed as described above, except that dNTPs were omitted. Measurements of Polymerase-Exonuclease Partitioning—Extension of a T-dGMP mismatch (see Fig. 4, B and C) was analyzed using a substrate made by annealing a 32P-labeled primer strand (5′-GTAACGCCAGGGTTTTCTCG-3′) to a template strand (5′-ACGTCGTGACTGAGAAAACCCTGGCGTTACCCA-3′) generating a terminal T-dGMP mismatch. Extension of a T-dTMP mismatch (see Fig. 4, D and E) was performed using a substrate made by annealing a 32P-labeled primer strand (5′-GTAACGCCAGGGTTTTCTCT-3′) to a template strand (5′-ACGTCGTGAATGAGAAAACCCTGGCGTTACCCA-3′), generating a terminal T-dTMP mismatch. Reactions were performed as described above except that 100 μm concentrations of only the next correct dNTP was added; for the T-dGMP mismatch, dGTP was added, and for the T-dTMP mismatch, dTTP was added. Measurements of Polymerase Processivity—The substrate used was primed single-stranded M13mp2 DNA with the primer strand annealing to nucleotides +173 to +192 of the lacZ target sequence. Reactions (30 μl) were performed in the standard reaction buffer described above and contained 150 fmol (5 nm) of primed single-stranded M13mp2 substrate, 1 mm concentrations of each dNTP, and 3 fmol (0.1 nm) wild type or L612M pol δ. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C, and time points were stopped by the addition of an equal volume of formamide loading dye after 5, 10, and 15 min. Reactions were performed in triplicate, and the termination probability at each template position was determined as described previously (25Ohashi E. Bebenek K. Matsuda T. Feaver W.J. Gerlach V.L. Friedberg E.C. Ohmori H. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39678-39684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The termination probabilities for each of the three replicate reactions were averaged for each time point, and then the three averaged time points were averaged to obtain a final termination probability for each template position. Error bars in Fig. 2D denote the S.D. of the three averaged time points. Gap-filling DNA Synthesis Reactions and Product Analysis for Determining Fidelity—Reactions (25 μl) contained 20 mm Tris (pH 7.7), 8 mm magnesium acetate, 90 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm ATP, 100 μm concentrations of each dNTP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 500 fmol of proliferating cell nuclear antigen, 200 fmol of replication factor C, 5 pmol of replication protein A, 150 fmol of pol δ and 25 fmol (1 nm) of gapped DNA that was prepared as described previously (26Zhong X. Garg P. Stith C.M. Nick McElhinny S.A. Kissling G.E. Burgers P.M. Kunkel T.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 4731-4742Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Polymerization reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 3 min. Under these conditions, when DNA products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis as described (23Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 217-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), all reactions filled the gap without obvious strand displacement (data not shown, but for a typical result, see Fig. 3 in Ref. 23Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 217-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). DNA products of gap-filling reactions were introduced into E. coli cells and plated as described (23Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 217-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) to score blue M13 plaques (correct synthesis) and light blue and colorless plaques (containing errors). The types of errors were determined by sequencing the lacZα complementation gene in single-stranded DNA isolated from independent mutant M13 plaques, allowing calculation of error rates as previously described (27Fortune J.M. Pavlov Y.I. Welch C.M. Johansson E. Burgers P.M. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29980-29987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Measurements of Mutation Rates in Yeast—Forward mutation rates at CAN1 were determined by fluctuation analysis using 12 independent cultures as described (28Tran H.T. Degtyareva N.P. Koloteva N.N. Sugino A. Masumoto H. Gordenin D.A. Resnick M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5607-5617Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 29Tran H.T. Keen J.D. Kricker M. Resnick M.A. Gordenin D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2859-2865Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Specific Activity and Processivity of L612M Pol δ—We first measured the polymerase activity of the L612M pol δ mutant relative to wild type pol δ. Using activated calf thymus DNA as a substrate, wild type pol δ incorporated 0.8 pmol of dCTP/nmol of pol δ/min, whereas L612M pol δ incorporated 1.6 pmol of dCTP/nmol of pol δ/min. L612M pol δ was also ∼2-fold more active than wild type pol δ in a simple primer extension assay (Fig. 2A). In a reaction containing a high DNA to enzyme ratio such that products result from a single encounter between pol δ and the primer-template (Fig. 2C), L612M pol δ extended 18% of the available primer and cycled 9 times, whereas wild type pol δ extended 10% of the available primer and cycled 5 times. Despite this 2-fold difference, the probability of termination of processive synthesis at each template position was similar for wild type and L612M pol δ (Fig. 2D). To determine whether the increase in activity was specific to polymerase activity or also included the 3′ exonuclease activity of pol δ, we compared the ability of L612M pol δ and wild type pol δ to digest single-stranded and double-stranded DNA. The 3′ exonuclease activity of L612M pol δ was slightly increased relative to wild type pol δ when either single-stranded DNA (Fig. 2B) or double-stranded DNA (data not shown) was used as a substrate. However, the differences are slight, such that the L612M mutation appears to selectively increase polymerase activity relative to exonuclease activity. At a minimum, replacing Leu-612 with methionine does not reduce polymerase activity or processivity nor does it reduce the intrinsic exonuclease activity of pol δ. Fidelity of L612M Pol δ—Next we determined if L612M pol δ synthesizes DNA with reduced fidelity during synthesis to copy the lacZα complementation sequence in gapped circular M13 DNA substrates (23Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 217-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). For comparison, parallel analyses were performed with wild type pol δ and an exonuclease-deficient mutant of pol δ (D520V(5-DV)) (attempts to construct and purify exonuclease-deficient L612M pol δ were unsuccessful, possibly because the combination of the L612M and 5-DV mutations in POL3 causes lethality in yeast due to error catastrophe). All reactions were performed in the presence of proliferating cell nuclear antigen, replication factor C, and replication protein A because these accessory proteins operate with pol δ as it fulfills its in vivo functions. To define error specificity when replicating complementary strand sequences, error rates for all three forms of pol δ were determined with two different gapped DNA substrates, one containing the (+) strand lacZ template and another containing the complementary (–) strand lacZ template (26Zhong X. Garg P. Stith C.M. Nick McElhinny S.A. Kissling G.E. Burgers P.M. Kunkel T.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 4731-4742Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Wild type, L612M, and 5-DV pol δ all filled the gaps in both lacZ substrates (see “Experimental Procedures”). The DNA products of these reactions were introduced into a lacZα-complementation E. coli strain, and the cells were plated to score DNA synthesis errors as light blue and colorless M13 plaques among much greater numbers of dark blue plaques resulting from correct synthesis (Table 1, top three rows). With both templates, the lacZ mutant frequencies generated by L612M pol δ were about 6-fold higher than those for wild type pol δ, clearly indicating that L612M pol δ has reduced fidelity. Interestingly, the lacZ mutant frequencies were similar for L612M and 5-DV pol δ despite the fact that the L612M enzyme retains robust 3′ exonuclease activity (Fig. 2B), whereas the 5-DV polymerase is exonuclease-deficient.TABLE 1Fidelity of wild type, L612M, and 5-DV pol δ Open table in a new tab To determine the types and locations of errors and to calculate error rates, we sequenced the lacZα complementation gene in DNA isolated from collections of independent mutant plaques (Table 1, the fourth and fifth rows). As expected based on earlier results with wild type and exonuclease-deficient pol δ (22Fortune J.M. Stith C.M. Kissling G.E. Burgers P.M. Kunkel T.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 4335-4341Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), no large deletions were observed due to the presence of the accessory proteins proliferating cell nuclear antigen, replication protein A, and replication factor C. Although a small number of mutations involved more than a single base change (see legend to Table 1), the vast majority of errors were single base substitutions and single base deletions (Table 1). From the mutant frequencies and the proportion of each type of error, we calculated the rates (see “Experimental Procedures”) at which wild type, L612M, and 5-DV polδ generated various errors when copying the (+) and (–) strand templates (Table 1). The results with wild type and 5-DV pol δ are similar to those recently published (22Fortune J.M. Stith C.M. Kissling G.E. Burgers P.M. Kunkel T.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 4335-4341Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), illustrating the reproducibility of the fidelity analysis and providing a basis for comparison to the error rates of L612M pol δ. For all three polymerases, mutant frequencies and error rates were similar when results from the (+) and (–) strand substrates were compared (Table 1); therefore, error rates for the two substrates were averaged for all subsequent comparisons between wild type, L612M, and 5-DV pol δ (Figs. 3, A–C, and 4A). Single Base Deletions—The average single base deletion error rate of L612M pol δ is 19-fold higher than that of wild type pol δ (Fig. 3A). The highest error rates are for single base deletions within the longest homopolymeric runs (4–5 bases) in the lacZ target (Fig. 3B), consistent with involvement of a misaligned intermediate containing an extra template strand nucleotide stabilized by the correct base-pairing possible in a repetitive sequence (for review, see Ref. 30Garcia-Diaz M. Kunkel T.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 206-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the deletion rate differs when L612M pol δ copies the same run in the two complementary strands (Fig. 3D). For example, when copying the (+) strand template, L612M pol δ deletes a T from a TTTT run at positions +70 to +73 at a rate that is 4.7-fold higher than the rate at which it deletes an A from the complementary AAAA run when copying the (–) strand template. Similarly, when copying the (–) strand template, L612M pol δ deletes a G from a GGGG run at positions –41 to –44 at a rate that is 17-fold higher than the rate at which it deletes a C from the complementary CCCC run when copying the (+) strand template. L612M pol δ is also less accurate than wild type pol δ when copying shorter homonucleotide runs and when copying non-iterated bases (Fig. 3B)."

To compensate for the low selectivity of Rubisco for CO2 over O2, cyanobacteria have developed highly efficient CO2-concentrating machinery of which the ABC transport system CmpABCD from Synechocystis PCC 6803 is one component. Here, we have described the structure of the bicarbonate-binding protein CmpA in the absence and presence of bicarbonate and carbonic acid. CmpA is highly homologous to the nitrate transport protein NrtA. CmpA binds carbonic acid at the entrance to the ligand-binding pocket, whereas bicarbonate binds in nearly an identical location compared with nitrate binding to NrtA. Unexpectedly, bicarbonate binding is accompanied by a metal ion, identified as Ca2+ via inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry. The binding of bicarbonate and metal appears to be highly cooperative and suggests that CmpA may co-transport bicarbonate and calcium or that calcium acts a cofactor in bicarbonate transport.

Cyanobacteria are the most abundant microorganisms in aquatic environments and play a key role in the global carbon cycle (1Whitton B.A. Potts M. The Ecology of Cyanobacteria: Their Diversity in Time and Space. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell, MA2000Google Scholar). It is estimated that these photosynthetic microbes are responsible for ∼50% of carbon fixation in the oceans. Over their 2.7-billion-year existence, cyanobacteria had to adapt to a changing gaseous environment where the levels of CO2 declined and O2 increased (2Gould S.J. The Book of Life: An Illustrated History of the Evolution of Life on Earth, 2nd Ed.. W. W. Norton & Co., New York2001Google Scholar). Because O2 can compete with CO2 for binding to the carbon-fixing enzyme Rubisco (3Badger M.R. Price G.D. J. Exp. Bot. 2003; 54: 609-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar), cyanobacteria evolved the most effective CO2-concentrating mechanism (CCM) 2The abbreviations used are: CCM, CO2-concentrating mechanism; Rubisco, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase; rTEV, recombinant tobacco etch virus; HEPPS, 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinepropanesulfonic acid; ICP-OES, inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry; ICP-MS, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. that allows them to concentrate CO2 levels around Rubisco up to 1000-fold. The CCM involves the import and accumulation of inorganic carbon as HCO3− in the cytoplasm and subsequent conversion to CO2 in the protein microcompartment called the “carboxysome” via carbonic anhydrase. One component of this CCM machinery in Synechocystis PCC 6803 is the cmpABCD operon that encodes a high affinity bicarbonate ABC transporter that is induced under low CO2 conditions (4Omata T. Price G.D. Badger M.R. Okamura M. Gohta S. Ogawa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13571-13576Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). This transporter is composed of four polypeptides, a high affinity solute-binding lipoprotein (CmpA), an integral membrane permease (CmpB), a cytoplasmic ATPase (CmpD), and an ATPase/solute-binding fusion protein (CmpC) that regulates transport (Fig. 1). The CmpABCD transporter is the highest affinity bicarbonate transporter of cyanobacteria (4Omata T. Price G.D. Badger M.R. Okamura M. Gohta S. Ogawa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13571-13576Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). This affinity is predominantly conferred by the binding of bicarbonate to CmpA (Kd = 5 μm) (5Maeda S. Price G.D. Badger M.R. Enomoto C. Omata T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20551-20555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). CmpA is anchored to the periplasmic face of the cytoplasmic membrane via a lipid anchor attached to a conserved cysteine (6Omata T. Ogawa T. Plant Physiol. 1986; 80: 525-530Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The closest known homologue of CmpA is NrtA, the solute-binding protein of the nitrate-specific NrtABCD transporter that is 48% identical and 61% similar in amino acid sequence (7Omata T. Plant Cell Physiol. 1995; 36: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). We recently published an analysis (8Koropatkin N.M. Pakrasi H.B. Smith T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 9820-9825Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) of the 1.6-Å structure of NrtA complexed with nitrate to elucidate the molecular determinants of nitrate specificity. From this structure, it seemed likely that the nitrate versus bicarbonate specificity was mainly due to the replacement of a lysine in the nitrate coordination sphere in NrtA with a glutamate in CmpA. To better compare and contrast these two important ABC transport systems, the x-ray structure of CmpA has been determined in three different states, complexed with H2CO3 (carbonic acid) at pH 5.0, bound with HCO3− (bicarbonate) at pH 8.0, and in the absence of ligands at pH 8.0. The “C-clamp” structure of CmpA is remarkably homologous to that of NrtA (8Koropatkin N.M. Pakrasi H.B. Smith T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 9820-9825Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) with ligands binding in the cleft between the two domains. At pH 5.0, nearly all of the bicarbonate is in the fully protonated, carbonic acid form. Under these conditions, the ligand is not bound deep inside the cleft, as was observed in NrtA, but rather at the entrance to the ligand-binding region. At pH 8.0, almost all of the dissolved inorganic carbon is in the bicarbonate form. In this case, the ligand is found deep inside the cleft of the C-clamp and, unexpectedly, is bound concomitantly with a calcium ion. Indeed, bicarbonate binds to CmpA if (and only if) calcium is also present. These and other results suggest that calcium and bicarbonate bind in a strongly cooperative manner and CmpA may transport calcium and bicarbonate simultaneously or that calcium acts as a cofactor in the bicarbonate transport. Cloning of cmpA from Synechocystis PCC 6803—The solute-binding domain of CmpA (residues 27–452) from Synechocystis PCC 6803 was cloned from genomic DNA. The cmpA gene was PCR-amplified with Platinum Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions and standard cycling conditions. The forward primer 5′-GGGAATTCCATATGGCCGGCAATCCCCCCGAT-3′ included an NdeI restriction site, and the reverse primer 5′-CCGCTCGAGTTAGACTTTTTTGATTGCCAAACTTTGCAG-3′ included an XhoI restriction site for cloning into pET-28a. The PCR product was purified with the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) followed by digestion with both NdeI and XhoI at 37 °C overnight. The gene was separated from digestion by-products on a 1.0% agarose gel and purified by the QIAquick Gel purification kit (Qiagen). The purified cmpA fragment was then ligated into the expression vector pET-28a (Novagen). The pET-28a (Novagen) vector was previously modified such that the thrombin cleavage site was replaced with a recombinant tobacco etch virus (rTEV) cleavage site. Escherichia coli DH5α cells were transformed with the ligation mixture and then plated onto LB medium supplemented with 30 μg/ml kanamycin. Individual colonies were selected and cultured overnight, and plasmid DNA was extracted with the QIAprep Spin Miniprep kit (Qiagen). Positive clones were sequenced by Lark Technologies (Houston, TX). Protein Expression—For protein expression, E. coli Rosetta(DE3)pLysS cells (Novagen) were transformed with the pET28a-cmpA plasmid and plated onto LB medium supplemented with 30 μg/ml kanamycin. After ∼16 h growth at 37 °C, the colonies were harvested from the plates and used for the inoculation of 2 × 4-liter baffled flasks containing TB (Terrific Broth) medium supplemented with 30 μg/ml kanamycin and 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol. The cells were grown at 37 °C with aeration to an A600 of ∼0.4, at which time the temperature was lowered to 22.5 °C for the remainder of the experiment. Thirty minutes after lowering the temperature, protein expression was induced by the addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The cells were allowed to grow for an additional 16 h before harvesting by centrifugation. The cell paste was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C. Expression of the Selenomethionine-labeled Protein in E. coli—Selenomethionine-substituted protein was expressed via the methionine inhibitory pathway (9Van Duyne G.D. Standaert R.F. Karplus P.A. Schreiber S.L. Clardy J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 105-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (1091) Google Scholar). Rosetta(DE3)pLysS (Novagen) cells were transformed with the pET28a-CmpA plasmid and plated onto LB medium supplemented with kanamycin. After ∼16 h growth at 37 °C, the colonies were harvested from the plates and used for the inoculation of 2 × 4-liter baffled flasks containing M9 (42 mm Na2HPO4, 136 mm KH2PO4, 58 mm NaCl, 53.5 mm NHyCl) medium supplemented with 0.015 mm thiamine, 30 μg/ml kanamycin, and 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol. Cultures were grown at 37 °C to an A600 of ∼0.4 before the temperature was adjusted to 22.5 °C for the remainder of the growth. Cultures were grown to an A600 of ∼0.8 before each flask was supplemented with 200 mg each of l-lysine, l-threonine, and l-phenylalanine and 100 mg each of l-leucine, l-isoleucine, l-valine, and l-selenomethionine. After 30 additional min of growth, the cells were induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and allowed to grow for 16 h. Cultures were harvested by centrifugation, and the cell paste was frozen in liquid nitrogen for storage at -80 °C. Protein Purification—Native and selenomethionine-substituted CmpA were purified in an identical manner. Approximately 10 g of frozen cells were thawed in 50 ml of cold buffer A (25 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, pH 8.0) with one Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Applied Science). Cells were lysed on ice by four cycles of sonication (45 s) separated by 3 min of cooling. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 4 °C for 30 min at 30,000 × g. The clarified lysate was loaded onto a 5-ml HiTrap chelating HP cartridge column (GE Healthcare) charged with Ni2+ and pre-equilibrated with buffer A. After loading, the column was washed with ∼40 ml of 90% buffer A/10% buffer B (25 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 300 mm imidazole at pH 8.0) followed by gradient elution of the protein from 10 to 100% buffer B. Protein-containing fractions were pooled based on SDS-PAGE and dialyzed against 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) with 200 mm NaCl overnight at 4 °C. For removal of the His tag, rTEV protease was added to dialyzed CmpA at a molar ratio of rTEV:CmpA of ∼1:50 CmpA, and the mixture was incubated for 4 h at ∼23 °C and then 16 h at 4 °C. The rTEV protease contained an N-terminal His6 tag, which allowed the separation of cleaved CmpA from both His-tagged CmpA and rTEV via Ni2+ affinity chromatography, as described above. Cleaved CmpA was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, with 20 mm NaCl and then loaded onto a 5-ml HiTrap Q HP anion exchange cartridge (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with the dialysis buffer. After loading, the column was washed with HEPES buffer until the A280 fell below ∼0.1 OD, and then the protein was eluted with a gradient of 20–500 mm NaCl in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5. Protein-containing fractions were pooled based on SDS-PAGE and dialyzed against 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) with 100 mm NaCl. For crystallization, CmpA was concentrated to ∼22 mg/ml based on an extinction coefficient of ∼1.78 ml/cm·mg as calculated by the program Protean (DNAstar, Inc., Madison, WI). Crystallization of Native and Selenomethionine-labeled CmpA—In the first set of crystallization experiments, 25 mm Na2CO3 was added to CmpA prior to crystallization. Potential crystallization conditions were screened using the Hampton Screen at both room temperature and 4 °C via the hanging drop method of vapor diffusion. Single crystals were observed at room temperature from 2 m ammonium sulfate. Crystallization conditions were refined, and large single crystals of CmpA (native and selenomethionine-substituted) complexed with carbonate were obtained by streak seeding of the hanging drop crystals into batch plates containing 11 mg/ml CmpA, 50 mm succinate, pH 5.0, 1.1–1.5 m ammonium sulfate, and 12 mm Na2CO3. Four additional structures of CmpA were determined at pH 8.0 using the following combinations of additives, NaHCO3, EGTA+NaHCO3, EGTA, and no additives. These crystals were obtained by streak seeding the Na2CO3-containing native crystals into batch plates containing 11 mg/ml CmpA, 50 mm HEPPS, pH 8.0, 1.4–1.6 m ammonium sulfate, and 5 mm EGTA and/or 15 mm NaHCO3 where applicable. Crystals grew to dimensions of ∼0.5 × 0.3 × 0.15 mm in 2–3 weeks. All of the various CmpA crystals were triclinic, with similar unit cell dimensions as noted in Tables 1 and 2. The solvent content of the crystals was ∼50%, with one molecule in the asymmetric unit.TABLE 1Data collection statistics for Se-Met MAD phasing Highest resolution shell is shown in parentheses.Data collectionSe-Met CmpA Space groupP1P1P1 Cell dimensionsa, b, c (Å)44.67, 49.62, 57.8644.69, 49.62, 57.9644.77, 49.73, 57.84α, β, γ (°)87.41, 80.32, 75.2987.31, 80.27, 75.2687.44, 80.37, 75.16PeakInflectionRemote Wavelength0.978990.979150.97132 Resolution (Å)50-2.18 (2.26-2.18)50-2.19 (2.27-2.19)50-2.17 (2.25-2.17) Rsym6.4 (7.3)6.3 (7.6)6.3 (10.7) I/σI23.1 (18.5)23.0 (17.3)16.6 (7.85) Completeness (%)89.1 (92.3)89.5 (90.7)94.4 (89.2) Redundancy2.5 (2.4)2.5 (2.4)2.5 (2.3) Open table in a new tab TABLE 2Data collection and refinement statistics (molecular replacement) Highest resolution shell is shown in parentheses.PDB accession ID2I48 CmpA, pH 5.0 H2CO32I49 CmpA, pH 8.0 Apo2I4B CmpA, pH 8.0 HCO3–/Ca2+ (EGTA)2I4C CmpA, pH 8.0 HCO3–/Ca2+Data collection Space groupP1P1P1P1 Cell dimensionsa, b, c (Å)44.54, 49.64, 57.7844.66, 49.68, 57.5744.79, 49.57, 57.7444.24, 49.24, 57.2α, β, γ (°)87.33, 80.50, 75.3187.57, 81.20, 75.2087.67, 81.23, 75.2487.40, 80.80, 75.4 Resolution (Å)40-1.6 (1.66-1.6)25.6-1.35 (1.45-1.35)24.6-1.35 (1.44-1.35)56.8-1.7 (1.78-1.70) Rsym or Rmerge7.7 (7.0)3.6 (21.9)4.2 (19.6)3.5 (17.6) I/σI22.9 (14.1)29.8 (6.0)24.9 (5.3)14.3 (3.5) Completeness (%)92.4 (89.4)99.2 (98.1)98.9 (98.3)91.8 (79.1) Redundancy2.6 (2.2)7.2 (3.7)6.5 (3.6)2.9 (1.3)Refinement Resolution (Å)40-1.6 (1.66-1.6)25.6-1.35 (1.45-1.35)24.6-1.35 (1.44-1.35)56.8-1.7 (1.78-1.70) No. reflections56,952103,049102,90346,348 Rwork/Rfree (%)17.5/19.217.9/19.320.8/22.319.3/21.8 No. atomsProtein3123312731393139Ligand/ion4055Water415411444386 B-factorsProtein11.99.211.011.5Ligand/ion28.8N/A13.821.6Water22.319.219.922.4 Root mean square deviationsBond lengths (Å)0.0050.0050.0050.005Bond angles (°)1.31.31.31.3 Open table in a new tab High Resolution X-ray Data Collection—Both the native and selenomethionine-substituted protein crystals were flash-frozen in the same manner. Briefly, crystals were harvested from the batch plates and soaked for several hours in a synthetic mother liquor composed of 100 mm succinate (pH 5.0) or 100 mm HEPPS (pH 8.0), 1.5–1.7 m ammonium sulfate, and 300 mm NaCl. The additives EGTA, NaHCO3,or Na2CO3 were included in all synthetic mother liquor and cryoprotectant solutions, when applicable, at 5 mm above the concentrations used for crystallization. Crystals were serially transferred to a final cryoprotectant solution containing 100 mm succinate, pH 5.0, or 100 mm HEPPS, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 1.5–1.7 m ammonium sulfate, 21–25% ethylene glycol, and the appropriate amount of additive. The crystals were then flash-cooled by submersion in liquid nitrogen. X-ray data sets from the selenomethionine-substituted crystals and native CmpA complexed with Na2CO3 were collected on a “SBC3” charge-coupled detector at the Structural Biology Center 19-BM beamline (Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL). The x-ray data were processed with HKL2000 and scaled with SCALEPACK (10Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). Relevant x-ray data collection statistics are summarized in Table 1. X-ray data on the CmpA crystals grown in the presence of additional NaHCO3 were collected in-house using CuKα radiation from a Bruker-nonius FR591 x-ray generator operated at 45 kV and 90 mA. The x-ray data were collected and processed using a Bruker Proteum charge-coupled detector system. X-ray data on the remaining three complexes (EGTA, EGTA, and NaHCO3 added, and no additives) were collected by Dr. Matthew Benning at Bruker AXS, Inc. in Madison, WI. The data were collected on a Microstar generator (running at 2.7 kW) with Helios optics. The detector was a Pt-135 charge-coupled device. Data reduction was performed using the programs SAINT and SAD-ABS from the Proteum2 software suite (Bruker AXS Inc., 2006). X-ray Structural Analyses—The structure of CmpA was solved via multiwavelength anomalous dispersion phasing with x-ray data collected from the selenomethionine-substituted protein crystals (Table 2). The software package SOLVE (11Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta. Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar) was used to determine and refine the positions of the selenium atoms, and the program RESOLVE (12Terwilliger T.C. Acta. Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (1636) Google Scholar) was then used to perform solvent flattening and initial protein model building. RESOLVE successfully built 356 of 452 residues for CmpA, and the remaining residues were added manually using the graphics package O (13Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Acta. Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). Alternate cycles of maximum likelihood refinement with crystallography NMR software and manual model building reduced the R-factor to <20% for all five models. Relevant data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 2. All five models yielded similar Ramachandran analyses; 90% of residues were in the most favored regions, 9.1% in the additionally allowed regions, 0.9% in the generously allowed regions, and 0% in the disallowed regions. In all five models, three residues are in the generously allowed regions of the backbone conformation, Asn-150, Glu-270, and Tyr-319. However, the high resolution electron density for these residues is unambiguous and consistent with the model. The peptidic carbonyl oxygen of Asn-150 hydrogen bonds to Asn-152 or Glu-270, and both are involved in Ca2+ binding. Similarly, Glu-270 is directly involved in Ca2+ binding and is in a random coil region connecting two β-strands that line the back of the solute-binding pocket. Tyr-319 is part of a surface loop that connects two α-helices. Methodology for Metals Determination—Determination of the calcium and nickel content in the protein was performed using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). A Thermo Jarrell-Ash IRIS-AP spectrometer was used. Calcium measurements were taken at wavelengths of 393.366 and 396.847 nm, and nickel content was measured at 231.604 nm. The sample was run after 10-fold dilution with de-ionized water. Duplicate reagent blanks were also run. Instrument detection limits for both calcium and nickel were <1 ng/ml. A semiquantitative scan for other elements present was performed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). A ThermoElemental PQ Excel ICP-MS instrument was used. This determination revealed only the presence of iron (∼3.5 μg/ml) and zinc (∼0.2 μg/ml) at appreciable concentrations. The overall molecular structure of CmpA with carbonic acid is shown in Fig. 2. CmpA is an α-β protein and belongs to the periplasmic-binding protein superfamily (14Dwyer M.A. Hellinga H.W. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2004; 14: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Similar to the related nitrate-binding protein NrtA, CmpA is composed of two domains (I and II) organized in a C-clamp shape. The core of each domain consists of a five-stranded mixed β-sheet flanked by α-helices. Domain I, which is slightly larger than domain II, is composed of three different segments of the polypeptide chain, 54–150, 267–321, and 350–426. This domain contains β1–β4 and β10 arranged as a mixed β-sheet, flanked by α1–α4, α8–α10, and α12–α14. Similarly, domain II is composed of several portions of the polypeptide chain, 151–266, 322–349, and 427–452. The fold of domain II is similar to that of domain I with β5–β9 forming a mixed β-sheet flanked by α4–α7, α11, and α15. In addition, domain II contains two antiparallel β-strands, 11 and 12, that are adjacent to the core motif. The two domains of CmpA are connected by random coil elements and flanked on either side of the solute-binding cleft by α-helices. Based on the order of the β-strands in each domain (21354), CmpA belongs to class II of the periplasmic-binding protein superfamily (14Dwyer M.A. Hellinga H.W. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2004; 14: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), which also includes the oxyanion-binding proteins specific for sulfate, phosphate, and molybdate (15Wang Z. Choudhary A. Ledvina P.S. Quiocho F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25091-25094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Vyas N.K. Vyas M.N. Quiocho F.A.

Biol. 1997; 4: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, CmpA, similar to NrtA, is much larger (∼100 amino acids) than these oxyanion-binding proteins. The last 100 residues of CmpA are mostly in an α-helical conformation with the exception of the 2-stranded antiparallel β-sheet in the C-terminal domain. These terminal residues form α-helices that wrap around the back of the structure and cradle the two α/β domains. As observed in NrtA, the surface charge distribution on the face opposite to the ligand-binding cleft of CmpA is almost entirely composed of acidic residues. Other solute-binding proteins (e.g. zinc, iron, sulfate, and phosphate) have a similar charge distribution and, during our analysis of the NrtA structure, led us to suggest that such a negative charge may facilitate delivery of solute to the transmembrane pore by limiting unproductive interactions of the solute-binding protein with the phospholipid membrane. The major difference between the CmpA and NrtA structures is that the CmpA clamp is in a more open conformation than that of NrtA. This suggests that CmpA, at pH 5.0 (Rwork = 17.5%, Rfree = 19.2%), is in the unliganded form. However, electron density consistent with a CO3 molecule was observed near, but not in, the solute-binding cleft (Figs. 2, 3, 4). At pH 5.0, nearly all of the solute is in the protonated, carbonic acid form. Therefore, it appears that carbonic acid does not bind in the expected ligand-binding pocket and, in turn, does not induce closure of the C-clamp. Interestingly, the carbonyl oxygen of carbonic acid is within 2.6 Å of the Nϵ atom of Trp-245 but does not hydrogen bond with any other residue in the protein. Bicarbonate is the predominant carbon species in the aquatic environment of Synechocystis and binds with a dissociation constant of ∼5 μm. Therefore, it is unlikely that this carbonic acid/CmpA interaction occurs in nature. However, it is also possible that the position of carbonic acid represents an initial interaction between bicarbonate and the exterior loops of the C-terminal domain to facilitate delivery of solute to the binding pocket. This kind of “preloading” of ligand to exterior loops of the transport protein was suggested in the case of the zinc-binding protein ZnuA (20Banerjee S. Wei B. Bhattacharyya-Pakrasi M. Pakrasi H.B. Smith T.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 333: 1061-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar).FIGURE 4Comparison of the CmpA and NrtA structures. a, stereo ribbon diagram overlay of the C-α backbones of CmpA and NrtA colored in yellow and blue, respectively.

At this pH, nearly all of the dissolved CO2 is in the bicarbonate form. It is important to note that, at this pH, bicarbonate is observed in the ligand-binding cleft whether or not it was added to the crystallization mother liquor. In both cases, bicarbonate is wedged in the binding cleft created by the juxtaposition of the two globular domains of CmpA and causes the C-clamp to close over the bound ligands (Figs. 2, 3, 4). Unexpectedly, a metal ion is also observed adjacent to the bicarbonate and bound by several residues from both the N- and C-terminal domains. There is no previous evidence suggesting that bicarbonate binding and transport by CmpA is metal-dependent. The metal ion is coordinated by five amino acid side chains and one bicarbonate oxygen in a distorted octahedral arrangement. The axial ligands are provided by side chain oxygens of Glu-270 (2.3 Å), Glu-271 (2.4 Å), Asn-152 (2.5 Å), and a carboxyl oxygen (2.5 Å) from bicarbonate. The octahedral geometry of the metal coordination is completed by side chain oxygens from Glu-70 and Gln-198, which are within 2.3 and 2.4 Å of the metal, respectively. The average nonbonded distance (2.4 Å) immediately eliminated a water molecule at the center of the coordination sphere and was instead highly suggestive of a metal. Both the chemistry and geometry of the metal-oxygen coordination sphere initially suggested that the bound metal was either Ca2+ or Na+ (21Harding M.M. Acta. Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 857-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 22Harding M.M. Acta. Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). It is important to note that this putative metal was not observed in the structure at pH 5.0, and the nature of the metal/protein interactions are unlikely to be affected by the shift from pH 5.0 to 8.0. To ascertain which is the more likely metal bound to CmpA, both metals were modeled into the density and unrestrained B-value refinement was performed in crystallography NMR software. Ca2+ refined to a B-value of 17.1 Å2, nearly identical to the average B-value of the surrounding atoms (16.1 Å2). In contrast, when Na+ was refined at this position, the resulting B-value was, as expected, a below average value of 6.3 Å2. The contention that the bound metal was a Ca2+ ion was further supported by analysis performed using the Metalloprotein Data Base and browser (Scripps Research Institute). Although both Na+ and Ca2+ are observed to have similar ligand-metal distances, it is not as common to find Na+ ions coordinated by six ligands, and when it does occur, the ligating moieties are primarily water molecules. In contrast, Ca2+ is most commonly observed octahedrally coordinated by oxygens contributed from side chains such as Glu, Asp, Asn, and Gln. Indeed, ICP-OES revealed that the only significant metal in the CmpA sample was calcium at a ratio of 0.6 ± 0.04 mol for every 1 mol of protein. Because the purification and crystallization buffers did not contain Ca2+, the source of the metal is unclear. It is possible that CmpA acquired the Ca2+ from E. coli during expression and carried it along through the purification process. Indeed, this has be"

One of these cleavages occurs at position 110/111, thereby generating C1 and N1 products. We have reported that disintegrins ADAM-10, -9, and -17 participate either directly or indirectly to this proteolytic event. An alternative proteolytic event taking place around residue 90 yields C2 and N2 fragments. The putative function of these proteolytic fragments remained to be established. We have set up two novel human embryonic kidney 293 cell lines stably overexpressing either C1 or C2. We show that C1 potentiates staurosporine-induced caspase-3 activation through a p53-dependent mechanism. Thus, C1 positively controls p53 transcription and mRNA levels and increases p53-like immunoreactivity and activity. C1-induced caspase-3 activation remained unaffected by the blockade of endocytosis in HEK 293 cells and was abolished in p53-deficient fibroblasts. Conversely, overexpression of the C2 fragment did not significantly sensitize HEK 293 cells to apoptotic stimuli and did not modify p53 mRNA levels or activity.

Therefore, the nature of the proteolytic cleavage taking place on PrPc yielded C-terminal catabolites with distinct function and could be seen as a switch mechanism controlling the function of the PrPc in cell survival. The glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored cellular prion (PrPc) 3The abbreviations used are: PrPc, cellular prion protein; XTT, sodium 3′-1-(phenylaminocarbonyl)-3,4-tetrazolium-bis(4-methoxy-6-nitro)benzene sulfonic acid; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling. gained considerable attention with the emergence of bovine spongiform encephalopathy and its transmission to human beings. Tremendous efforts have been devoted to understand the mechanisms by which this normal form converts to the pathological form PrPsc (for recent reviews, see Refs. 1Aguzzi A. Polymenidou M.

Nevertheless, the physiological function of PrPc remains puzzling. Several reports suggested a putative role of PrPc in cell adhesion (3Rieger R. Edenhofer F. Lasmezas C.I. Weiss S. Nat.

Neurochem. 2005; 95: 1373-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The involvement of PrPc in cell viability is still under debate. Thus, a fair number of reports suggest that PrPc may have a role in the control of oxidative stress and cell survival (for review, see Ref. 8Roucou X. LeBlanc A. J. Mol. Med. 2005; 83: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). It has been reported that PrPc protects against tumor necrosis factor α-(9Diarra-Mehrpour M. Arrabal S. Jalil A. Pinson X. Gaudin C.

Neurosci. Res. 2004; 75: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Conversely, we recently established that PrPc overexpression led to an increased staurosporine-evoked cell death (13Paitel E. Fahraeus R. Checler F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10061-10066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) in transfected or inducible cell lines and showed that this cellular response was associated with an activation of caspase-3 linked to a transcriptional and post-transcriptional control of the p53 transcription factor (14Paitel E. Sunyach C. Alves da Costa C. Bourdon J.C. Vincent B. Checler F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 612-618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Moreover, we and others have described that down-regulation of PrPc in cell lines (14Paitel E. Sunyach C. Alves da Costa C. Bourdon J.C. Vincent B. Checler F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 612-618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 15Du J. Pan Y. Shi Y. Guo C. Jin X. Sun L. Liu N. Qiao T. Fan D. Int. J.

This last observation would plead for a p53-dependent proapoptotic function of PrPc rather than a protective one given the pivotal role of this tumor suppressor in triggering cell death. Shortly before or after its appearance at the cell surface, PrPc undergoes a variety of proteolytic processing events. In human brain, PrPc is mainly endoproteolyzed on the N-terminal side, at the 110/111 peptidyl bond, to produce a 17-kDa C-terminal fragment C1 tethered to the plasma membrane (17Harris D.A. Huber M.T. van Dijken P. Shyng S.-L. Chait B.T. Wang R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1009-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 18Chen S.G. Teplow D.B. Parchi P. Teller J.K. Gambetti P. Autilio-Gambetti L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19173-19180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). A 9-kDa soluble N-terminal counterpart referred to as N1 is released in the extracellular medium (19Vincent B. Paitel E. Frobert Y. Lehmann S. Grassi J. F C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35612-35616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). We have established in several cell systems that this cleavage is both constitutive and protein kinase C-regulated (19Vincent B. Paitel E. Frobert Y. Lehmann S. Grassi J. F C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35612-35616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that three disintegrins contribute to this processing, either directly for ADAM (A Disintegrin And Metalloprotease) -10 and -17 (20Vincent B. Paitel E. Saftig P. Frobert Y. Hartmann D. de Strooper B. Grassi J. Lopez-Perez E. Checler F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37743-37746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) or indirectly for ADAM-9 (21Alfa-Cisse M. Sunyach C. Lefranc-Jullien S. Postina R. Vincent B. Checler F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 281: 40624-40631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In agreement with these data, ADAM-10 appears as a strong candidate for this cleavage in vivo in human brain (22Laffont-Proust I. Faucheux B.A. Hässig R. Sazdovitch V. Simon S. Grassi J. Hauw J.J. Moya K.L. Haïk S. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 6333-6337Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In pathological situations, PrPc apparently undergoes an additional upstream cleavage, within the octapeptide repeats, around the 90/91 residues (18Chen S.G. Teplow D.B. Parchi P. Teller J.K. Gambetti P. Autilio-Gambetti L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19173-19180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar), yielding a 21-kDa C-terminal fragment referred to as C2 and its 7-kDa N2-corresponding N-terminal peptide. The nature of the proteases involved in the pathological cleavage remains to be established. Very few works have examined the putative functions of C1 and C2, and particularly, their potential as a regulator of cell death, a function harbored by the parent protein. In other words, little is known concerning the fact that these cleavages could be seen as an activating process leading to biologically active fragments or as an inactivating mechanism aimed at abolishing PrPc-mediated control of cell death. Whether C1 or C2 fragments harbor similar or distinct function also remained a matter of question. In this context, we have established two novel cell lines overexpressing either C1 or C2 fragments. We now show that C1 displays pro-apoptotic function and regulates p53 mRNA transcription and activity, whereas C2 remains biologically inert in this paradigm. The PRI-308 monoclonal antibody was raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the human 106-126 sequence. SAF32 and SAF61 monoclonal antibodies are directed against PrP 79-92 residues and 142-160, respectively. All three antibodies were generously provided by Dr. J. Grassi (Commissariat à l'Energie Atomique/Saclay, Gif sur Yvette, France). Anti-human p53 antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-β-tubulin monoclonal antibody and staurosporine were purchased from Sigma (St. Quentin-Fallavier, France). The 3F4-tagged PrPc coding vector (3F4MoPrPc) drives the expression of mouse PrPc in which 2 methionines in positions 109 and 112 of the human sequence replace lysine 108 and valine 111 in the mouse PrPc cDNA, thereby allowing its detection by human-specific PRI-308). To obtain C1 and C2 coding vectors, 24-89 and 24-110 deletions were created in 3F4-tagged PrPc cDNA using a QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) following the manufacturer's specifications. The two following sets of primers (forward, 5′-ACT ATG TGG ACT GAT GTC GGC CTC TGC ATG GCA GGG GCT GCG GCA GCT GGG-3′; reverse, 5′-CCC AGC TGC CGC AGC CCC TGC CAT GCA GAG GCC GAC ATC AGT CCA CAT AGT-3′; and forward, 5′ ACT ATG TGG ACT GAT GTC GGC CTC TGC CGC CAA GGA GGG GGT ACC CAT AAT CAG TGG AAC-3′, and reverse, 5′-GTT CCA CTG ATT ATG GGT ACC CCC TCC TTG CAG GCG GCA GAG GCC GAC ATC AGT CCA CAT AGT-3′) were purchased from Eurogentec (Seraing, Belgium). The resulting constructs were verified by sequencing. Human emonic cells (HEK 293) stably expressing PrP C1 or C2 fragments were established and maintained as described previously for mock-transfected and 3F4 MoPrPc-expressing HEK293 cells (19Vincent B. Paitel E. Frobert Y. Lehmann S. Grassi J. F C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35612-35616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Murine TSM-1 neuronal cells (23Alves da Costa C. Ancolio K. Checler F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24065-24069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) were transiently transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen, Cergy-Pontoise, France) according to the manufacturer's instructions. p19Arf-deficient and p19Arf/p53 double knock-out fibroblasts kindly provided by Dr. M. Roussel (24Kamijo T. Zindy F. Roussel M. Quelle D.E. Downing J.R. Ashmun R.A. Grosveld G. Sherr C.J. Cell. 1997; 91: 649-659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1390) Google Scholar) were transfected by means of the mouse embryonic fibroblasts Nucleofector™ kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amaxa Biosystems, Koeln, Germany). In brief, 5 million cells were nucleofected (program A23) with 6 μg of various cDNA prediluted in 100 μl of mouse embryonic fibroblasts Nucleofector solution. The nucleofected samples were then transferred to Eppendorf tubes containing 500 μl of prewarmed culture medium, gently homogenized, and equally dispatched to 6-well dishes. Twenty-four hours after transfection cells were treated with either Me2SO (vehicle control) or 1 μm staurosporine for 2 h and recovered for further analysis. Cells were homogenized in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 5 mm EDTA) for PrPc immunodetection. Samples of equal amounts of proteins were resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by standard immunoblotting techniques. For p53 detection, nuclear enriched fractions were prepared as detailed previously for cytochrome c translocation experiments (25Alves da Costa C. Paitel E. Mattson M.P. Amson R. Telerman A. Ancolio K. Checler F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4043-4048Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of proteins were separated on 8% gels and probed using a 1:10,000 dilution of anti-human p53 antibody. Blots were developed using ECL methods according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science, Meylan, France). Chemiluminescence was recorded using a luminescence image analyzer LAS-3000 (Raytest, Courbevoie, France), and quantification of captured images was performed using the Aida Image Analyzer software (Raytest). Cells were seeded in 6-well dishes and allowed to reach 80% confluency in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Culture medium was then replaced with 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing cycloheximide (15 μg/ml) (Sigma). Treatment was then carried out for the appropriate time periods. When deglycosylation was required, 25 μg of proteins were recovered in denaturing buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5% SDS, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol) and boiled for 5 min. One percent Nonidet P-40 and 0.5 units of N-glycosidase F (Roche Applied Science) were added, and the samples were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of an equal volume of loading buffer (0.5 m Tris, pH 6.8, glycerol 10%, SDS 10%, bromphenol blue 0.05%). Samples were then resolved on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel for Western blot analysis as described above. When specified, cells were treated with metalloprotease inhibitors o-phenanthroline (Sigma) or BB3103 (hydroxamic acid-based zinc metalloprotease inhibitor, kindly provided by British Biotech) as described previously (Vincent et al. (20Vincent B. Paitel E. Saftig P. Frobert Y. Hartmann D. de Strooper B. Grassi J. Lopez-Perez E. Checler F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37743-37746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar)). Cells were then lysed, and protein samples were deglycosylated as detailed above. XTT Assay—Cells were grown in 96-well plates in the presence or absence of staurosporine (2 μm, 16 h). XTT is metabolized by mitochondrial dehydrogenase to a water-soluble formazan salt only by metabolically active viable cells. Absorbance is measured at 452 nm as detailed previously (23Alves da Costa C. Ancolio K. Checler F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24065-24069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) Assay—Cells were cultured in 6-well 35-mm plates. At confluency, they were treated with staurosporine (2 μm for 16 h). Forty μl of culture medium were analyzed for the release of LDH using CytoTox-ONE™ homogeneous membrane integrity assay (Promega, Charbonnières, France) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Cells were grown in 6-well plates and incubated with staurosporine (16 h with 2 μm) (Sigma) after they reached confluency. Samples were processed for caspase-3 like activity assay as described in detail elsewhere (23Alves da Costa C. Ancolio K. Checler F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24065-24069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Fluorometry was recorded at 360 and 460 nm (excitation and emission wavelengths) by means of a microtiter plate reader (Labsystems, Fisher Bioblock scientific, Illkirch, France). Caspase activity is calculated from the linear part of fluorometry recorded and expressed in units/hr/mg of proteins (established by the Bio-Rad procedure). One unit corresponds to 4 nmol of 4-methyl 7-amino-coumarin released. When blockade of internalization was required, cells were pretreated with 0.45 m sucrose for 30 min as detailed previously (26Sunyach C. Checler F. J. Neurochem. 2005; 92: 1399-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Caspase-3 activity was then monitored as above. Control (mock-transfected) and C1- and C2-expressing HEK 293 were cultured on glass coverslips in 35-mm dishes. Cells were fixed with 1.5% paraformaldehyde for 20 min and washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline, and the primary antibodies (SAF61 and SAF83) were applied for 2 h. After three washes with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were incubated with goat anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor-594 (Interchim, Montluçon, France) for 1 h. Hoechst (Interchim) was added to phosphate-buffered saline during the first of the last three washes to stain the nuclei. Coverslips were then mounted in Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA), and staining was visualized with an Axioplan 2 imaging microscope (Carl Zeiss, Sartrouville, France) with oil immersion objective ×63 coupled to a cooled CCD camera (Raper Scientist, Tucson, AZ). For each stably transfected cell line, the same number of cells were plated on glass coverslip. At confluency, they were treated with staurosporine (1 μm, 16 h) and processed for labeling. Samples previously fixed 20 min in paraformaldehyde, rinsed and permeabilized overnight in 70% ethanol, and then processed for the dUTP nick end-labeling in situ cell death detection kit, POD (Roche Applied Science) as stated by the supplier. For quantification, total cells were counterstained with erythrosine B. Images were captured on an Olympus BX41 microscope (Olympus, Rungis, France) using Olympus DP12 software. Cells undergoing cell death (diaminobenzidine-labeled nuclei) were counted on 10 independent optical fields for each experimental condition. p21waf-1-luciferase and PG13-luciferase constructs (provided by Dr. B. Vogelstein, Baltimore, MD) that were used to measure p53 transcriptional activity have been extensively described (27El-Deiry W. Kern S. Pietenpol J. Kinzler K. Vogelstein B. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1752) Google Scholar, 28El-Deiry W. Tokino T. Velculescu V. Levy D. Parsons R. Trent J. Lin D. Mercer W. Kinzler K. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7957) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells grown in 12-well plates were co-transfected with a 1:0.25 ratio of P21waf-1 or PG13-luciferase p53 gene reporter constructs and β-galactosidase expression vector (to normalize transfection efficiencies). Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were measured 48 h after transfection according to well described procedures (25Alves da Costa C. Paitel E. Mattson M.P. Amson R. Telerman A. Ancolio K. Checler F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4043-4048Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) using a luciferase assay system and β-galactosidase enzyme assay system (Promega, Charbonnières, France). The p53 promoter-luciferase construct (kindly provided by Dr. M. Oren, Rehovot, Israel), which has been described earlier (29Ginsberg D. Oren M. Yaniv M. Piette J. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 1285-1290PubMed Google Scholar), was used to determine p53 promoter transactivation as above. Total RNA from cells were isolated using the RNeasy kit (Promega, Charbonnière, France) following the instructions of the manufacturer. After DNase I treatment, 1 μg of total RNA were reverse-transcribed using oligo(dT) priming and avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega). Real-time PCR was performed in an ABI PRISM 5700 sequence detector system (Applied Biosystems, Courtaboeuf, France) using the SYBR Green detection protocol as outlined by the manufacturer. Human p53-specific primers were designed using the Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems) as follows: forward, 5′-GAA CCC TTG CTT GCA ATA GG-3′, and reverse, 5′-GTG AGG TAG GTG CAA ATG CC-3′. Relative expression level of p53 gene is normalized for RNA concentrations with housekeeping gene (human GAPDH) using the following primers: forward, 5′-TGG GCT ACA CTG AGC ACC AG-3′, and reverse, 5′-CAG CGT CAA AGG TGG AGG AG-3′. mRNA values are expressed as arbitrary units; they represent means ± S.D. of triplicates and are representative of 3 independent experiments. Statistical analysis was performed with PRISM software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) by using the Newmann-Keuls multiple comparison tests for one-way analysis of variance. Characterization of C1- and C2-expressing Cells—To elucidate the biological function of cellular prion protein N-terminal endoproteolytic events, we have established HEK 293 stable transfectants expressing C1 or C2 fragments. Immunological characterization of these cell lines was performed by means of three monoclonal antibodies directed against distinct epitopes spanning the complete PrPc sequence (Fig. 1A). SAF32, PRI-308, and SAF61 recognize the octapeptide repeat (amino acids 79-92), the hydrophobic region (amino acids 106-126), and the C-terminal domain (amino acids 142-160), respectively (Fig. 1A) (30Demart S. Fournier J.G. Cremignon C. Frobert Y. Lamoury F. Marce D. Lasmézas C. Dormont D. Grassi J. Deslys J.-P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 265: 652-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). As expected, SAF32 detects overexpressed 3F4 MoPrPc together with the endogenous cellular PrPc but failed to label C1 and C2 (Fig. 1B, left panel). The epitope recognized by PRI-308 is truncated in C1, whereas it is complete in C2 (Fig. 1A). Accordingly, this antibody detects C2 and the full-length 3F4 MoPrPc but not C1 (Fig. 1B, central panel). As anticipated, SAF61, which is specific of the core region of the C-terminal domain of PrPc, reveals all three constructs (Fig. 1B, right panel). Shifts of the electrophoretic mobility observed between C1 and C2 lanes (Fig. 1B, SAF61) are in agreement with the expected molecular mass of C1 and C2 (i.e. 17 and 21 kDa, respectively). Both fragments retain intact glycosylation sites located in positions 180 and 186 in the C-terminal region of PrPc (31Rudd P.M. Endo T. Colominas C. Groth D. Wheeler S.F. Harvey D.J. Wormald M.R. Serban H. Prusiner S.B. Kobata A. Dwek R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13044-13049Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) explaining the complex pattern obtained. To clarify this pattern, we submitted the cell lysates to deglycosylation. N-glycosidase F treatment revealed one single 27-kDa band in 3F4MoPrPc overexpressing cells corresponding to PrP full-length (Fig. 2A). As expected, the heterogeneous pattern observed in C1 and C2 cells resolved into one single band of 17 and 21 kDa, respectively (Fig. 2A). In addition, immunohistochemical labeling of fixed cells overexpressing C1 and C2 using SAF61 showed that both fragments are correctly and similarly addressed to the plasma membrane (Fig. 2B).FIGURE 2C1 and C2 are correctly glycosylated and addressed to the cell surface. A, deglycosylation of PrPc, C1 and C2. Lysates from stably expressing cell lines were incubated in the absence (Ct) or in the presence of increasing amounts of N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) before being resolved on SDS-PAGE electrophoresis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” U corresponds to 0.5 units of enzyme. After transfer, membranes were immuno-blotted with SAF61 monoclonal antibody, which recognizes PrPc full-length (FL), C1, and C2. B, mock-transfected and C1- and C2-expressing cells were labeled using SAF61 under fixed conditions to show membrane distribution of C1 and C2 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Samples were analyzed on an Axioplan 2 microscope, and representative images were captured with a CCD camera using the same settings.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) C2 Is Not Proteolytically Converted into C1—To rule out a possible interference of C1 in putative C2-associated phenotype, we examined whether C2 could undergo proteolytic cleavages generating C1. To address this question, we first analyzed C1 and C2 metabolic stability after treatment with cycloheximide (to prevent de novo synthesis of C1 and C2 fragments) followed by deglycosylation. Fig. 3, A-C, indicate that C1 and C2 immunoreactivities time-dependently decreased with similar kinetic slopes (C1y =-3.3 ×+95.8; C2y =-3.1 ×+93.6). The C1 fragment results from the proteolytic attack of PrPc full-length protein in position 110/111 by disintegrins (ADAM-10 and -17). The C2 fragment, which contains this cleavage site, could theoretically produce C1. This does not appear to be the case. First, long time incubation of C2 does not lead to C1-like immunoreactivity even when C2 was totally degraded (Fig. 3B); second, the general inhibitor of metalloproteases, o-phenanthroline (Fig. 3D), as well as the specific inhibitor of ADAM-10 and -17, BB3103 (Fig. 3E), did not increase C2 immunoreactivity; third, transient overexpression of ADAM-10 or -17 neither accelerated C2 catabolism nor led to C1 production (data not shown). Overall, our data show that C2 does not produce C1, and therefore, that putative C2-mediated phenotype could not be indirectly due to C1. C1 Expression Sensitizes HEK 293 Cells to Staurosporine-induced Toxicity—We previously described that overexpression of PrPc enhanced staurosporine sensitivity of several cell systems including HEK293 and TSM-1 cells (13Paitel E. Fahraeus R. Checler F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10061-10066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 14Paitel E. Sunyach C. Alves da Costa C. Bourdon J.C. Vincent B.

Neurochem. 2002; 83: 1208-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) as shown by increased cytotoxic response. We therefore examined whether the overexpression of C1 or C2 could modulate cell survival after staurosporine treatment. Full-length PrPc (3F4MoPrP) and C1 fragment both increased staurosporine-induced cell toxicity measured by XTT (Fig. 4A) and increased LDH release (Fig. 4B). By contrast, C2 did not modulate cell viability in these conditions (Fig. 4, A and B). To examine whether apoptosis could account for the toxicity in staurosporine-treated C1 overexpressing cells, we further analyzed C1- and C2-overexpressing cells using the TUNEL labeling technique. Fig. 5, A and B, clearly show a 3-fold increase in the number of TUNEL-positive nuclei in 3F4MoPrPc- and C1-expressing cells, whereas there was no modification of the number of apoptotic nuclei in C2 cells fields (Fig. 5, A and B).FIGURE 5Overexpression of C1 but not C2 increases staurosporine-evoked TUNEL-positive HEK293 cells.

https://openalex.org/W2035591821,"DNA polymerase beta (pol beta) is a key player in DNA base excision repair (BER). Here, we describe the complex formation of pol beta with the protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1). PRMT1 specifically methylated pol beta in vitro and in vivo. Arginine 137 was identified in pol beta as an important target for methylation by PRMT1. Neither the polymerase nor the dRP-lyase activities of pol beta were affected by PRMT1 methylation. However, this modification abolished the interaction of pol beta with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). Together, our results provide evidence that PRMT1 methylation of pol beta might play a regulatory role in BER by preventing the involvement of pol beta in PCNA-dependent DNA metabolic events."

We identified Prp19p, which has never been reported in relation to any function outside of the nucleus, as a member of proteins associated with lipid droplets. Down-regulation of Prp19p expression with RNA interference in 3T3-L1 cells repressed lipid droplet formation with the reduction in the level of expression of perilipin and S3-12. The levels of expression of SCD1 (stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1), DGAT-1 (acyl-CoA diacylglycerol acyltransferase-1), and glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase were also reduced in Prp19p down-regulated cells, and a significant decrease in triglycerides was observed. Unlike perilipin, which is one of the most extensively studied lipid droplet-associated proteins, Prp19p is not essential for cAMP- and hormone-sensitive lipase-dependent lipolysis pathways, even though Prp19p is a component of the lipid droplet phospholipid monolayer, and down-regulation of Prp19p represses fat accretion significantly. These results suggest that Prp19p or Prp19-interacting proteins during lipid droplet biogenesis in adipocytes may be considered as another class of potential targets for attacking obesity and obesity-related problems.

Lipid droplets are subcellular organelles that function as major energy depots by storing neutral lipids, mainly triacylglycerols (1Zweytick D. Athenstaedt K. Daum G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1469: 101-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 2Murphy D.J. Prog. Lipid. Res. 2001; 40: 325-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). Therefore, the biogenesis of a lipid droplet is central to whole body energy homeostasis. In addition to their function as energy depots, lipid droplets appear to have important roles in lipid trafficking in adipocytes, cell signaling, and several important human diseases (3Le Lay S. Ferre P. Dugail I. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2004; 32: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 4Liu P. Ying Y. Zhao Y. Mundy D.I. Zhu M. Anderson R.G. J. Biol.

It is thus important to understand the mechanism of deposition and mobilization of cellular neutral lipids. Although the mechanisms of lipid droplet biogenesis are still not entirely clear, it is expected that a set of proteins involved in lipid droplet biogenesis could comprise effective targets for the regulation of the whole body energy homeostasis. Lipid droplets are surrounded by a phospholipid monolayer into which many proteins are embedded (8Tauchi-Sato K. Ozeki S. Houjou T. Taguchi R. Fujimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44507-44512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). These surface proteins on adipocyte lipid droplets include structural proteins, such as PAT (perilripin/ADRP/TIP47) family proteins, S3-12, vimentin, and caveolin-1, and enzymes involved in many aspects of lipid metabolism, such as hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL)-, acyl-CoA synthetase-, lanosterol synthase-, CGI-58-, and NAD(P)-dependent steroid dehydrogenase-like protein and members of the Rab family of GTPases. Some of these lipid droplet-associated proteins are reported to play important roles in the functions of the lipid droplets (7Yamaguchi T. Omatsu N. Matsushita S. Osumi T. J. Biol.

In this study, in order to explore proteins that are involved in lipid droplet biogenesis, we investigated the protein composition of lipid droplets isolated from cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and we identified several more lipid droplet-associated proteins using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. Most of the additionally identified proteins are enzymes involved in aspects of lipid metabolism and endoplasmic reticulum or well known membrane trafficking-related proteins. For unknown proteins, their subcellular localization and the expression patterns during the differentiation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes were investigated. mPrp19p, the mouse homolog of the protein encoded by the Pso4/Prp19 gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is strongly associated with lipid droplets as well as the nucleus. Its expression was elevated during the adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Moreover, down-regulation of Prp19p expression with RNA interference in 3T3-L1 cells inhibited the expression of lipid droplet-associated proteins (perilipin and S3-12). Also, RNA interference of Prp19p repressed fat accretion and suppressed the expression of SCD1, DGAT-1, and GPAT. 2The abbreviations used are: GPAT, glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometry; FAS, fatty-acid synthase; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; RNAi, RNA interference; RT, reverse transcription; HSL, hormone-sensitive lipase; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor. Taken together, these results strongly indicate that Prp19p participates in the maturation of lipid droplets and fat storage in differentiating preadipocytes. Animals—C57BL6 mice were maintained on a regular light-dark cycle (14 h light, 10 h dark) and kept on a standard laboratory chow diet (4.5% w/w fat). Male animals at an age of 12–16 weeks were used for the experiments. Cell Culture and Differentiation—Mouse 3T3-L1 (ATCC CL173) preadipocyte cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% calf serum. For the differentiation, the medium was replaced with DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 μg/ml insulin, 0.5 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, and 1 μm dexamethasone at 2 days post-confluence. After 2 days, the medium was changed to DMEM containing 10 μg/ml insulin and 10% fetal bovine serum, and then the cells were refed every 2 days. Isolation of Lipid Droplets and Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis—Ten days after the initiation of differentiation, lipid droplets were isolated from 20 dishes (100-mm) of 3T3-L1 adipocytes, as described by Schroeder and co-workers (16Atshaves B.P. Storey S.M. McIntosh A.L. Petrescu A.D. Lyuksyutova O.I. Greenberg A.S. Schroeder F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25324-25335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were homogenized in 50 mm NaH2PO4 buffer, pH 7.4, containing 154 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) followed by centrifugation at 800 × g for 10 min. To sediment mitochondria, the resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 20 min, followed by a second centrifugation step at 26,000 × g in an SW41Ti rotor (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Fullerton, CA) for 2 h at 4 °C. The floating lipid droplet layers were harvested using a Beckman tube slicer, and the lipid droplet fractions were delipidated with cold acetone overnight at –20 °C followed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The protein pellet was solubilized in ReadyPrep™ Rehydration buffer (Bio-Rad) by incubation in a bath sonicator at 50 °C for 4–5 h. The first-dimension isoelectric focusing was performed by using precast 24-cm, pH 3–10, IPG strips (Amersham Biosciences) in three steps under a stepn-hold mode. The second-dimension SDS-PAGE was carried out in an Ettan DALTsix system (Amersham Biosciences). In Gel Tryptic Digestion—Coomassie-stained protein spots were excised from the gel and destained with 45% acetonitrile in 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate. The resulting gel slices were incubated with 10 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride, alkylated by the addition of 50 mm iodoacetamide, and then digested in situ with trypsin (100 ng per band in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate). The tryptic peptides were extracted using a Branson sonicator in 0.2% trifluoroacetic acid in 5% formic acid. The extracted peptides were concentrated using C18 zip-tips and eluted with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 30% acetonitrile followed by 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 75% acetonitrile. The eluates were dried under vacuum using a SpeedVac concentrator. Mass Spectrometry—Coomassie-stained protein spots were excised from the gel and in-gel digested with trypsin. HPLC/MS/MS analyses of the resulting tryptic peptides were performed in a LCQ DECA XP plus ion-trap mass spectrometer (ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA) coupled on-line with an inhouse packed capillary column (150 μm × 50 cm, with precolumn flow splitting) Surveyor HPLC system (ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA) and an in-house built nanospray source. For protein identification, MS/MS data were searched using BioWorks 3.0 software (ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA), a program for matching mass spectrometric information with sequence data bases. Proteins were identified based on matching the MS/MS data with mass values calculated for selected ion series of peptides. The sequences of 11 polypeptides from a 54-kDa protein spot by mass spectrometry were identified as an unnamed protein product (Gi number 26338912). A BLAST search of the protein data base demonstrated that these unnamed peptide fragments were identical to the peptides encoded by the murine Prp19 gene. Cloning of Mouse Prp19—Mouse Prp19 cDNA was amplified with the primers 5′-ATGTCCCTGATCTGCTCGATCTCCAA-3′ and oligo(dT) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using poly(A)+ mRNA prepared from 3T3-L1 cells 10 days after the initiation of differentiation. RT-PCR from the 3T3-L1 cells amplified a 1.6-kb DNA fragment that encoded a protein that contained all 11 polypeptides obtained by mass spectrometric analysis. The sequence matched the previously reported sequence for Mus musculus Prp19/Pso4 homolog (GenBank™ accession number NM_134129). Antibodies—Polyclonal antibody to Prp19p was raised in rabbits and affinity-purified against peptide TTERKKRGK by Lab-Frontier (Seoul, Korea). The antibody to perilipin was purchased from Research Diagnostics Inc. (Flanders, NJ); the antibodies to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, PPAR-γ, and C/EBP-α were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); the antibodies to calnexin and FAS were from BD Biosciences; the antibody to Oxphos complex IV was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR); the antibody to cyclophilin A was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY); the antibody to lamin B was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; and the antibody to SCD-1 was from Alpha Diagnostic International, Inc. (San Antonio, TX). Protein Preparation and Immunoblotting—C57BL6 mice were asphyxiated with carbon dioxide, and tissues were harvested and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. The tissues were extracted in a solution of pH 7.4 containing 20 mm HEPES, 250 mm sucrose, 4 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton and protease inhibitor mixture. 3T3-L1 cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (PBS, pH 7.4, containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and a protease inhibitor mixture). Forty micrograms of proteins were resolved on 10% NuPAGE gels run in the MES buffer system (Invitrogen) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes according to the manufacturer's protocol. Immunoreactive proteins were revealed by enhanced chemiluminescence with ECL+ (Amersham Biosciences). Blots were quantified using an ImageMaster (Amersham Biosciences). Subcellular Fractionation—Adipocytes were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and scraped into homogenization buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 255 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). After homogenization with a glass homogenizer for 20 strokes, the homogenate was centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min into supernatant 1 and pellet. The pellet was homogenized in 10 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5, containing 300 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitor mixture and centrifuged 5,000 × g for 5 min. The resulting pellet was the nuclear fraction. Supernatant 1 was removed and centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 20 min to yield the pellet (mitochondria fraction) and supernatant 2. Supernatant 2 was centrifuged at 26,000 × g for 2 h to sediment the microsomal fraction. The final supernatant was called cytosol. The floating lipid droplet layers were extracted with 1% SDS and 1% Triton-containing buffer by rocking at room temperature for 1 h. The suspension was then warmed up to 37 °C, vortexed vigorously, and immersed eight times for 15 s in a bath sonicator. Immunoflorescence Microscopy—3T3-L1 adipocytes were fixed with 3% formaldehyde in PBS, permeabilized with 70% ethanol, and incubated with anti-Prp19p (1.4 μg/ml) or antiperilipin (diluted 1:100) antisera in a microscopy buffer (2% BSA and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS), followed by Alexa 488-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) and Alexa 594-conjugated goat anti-guinea pig IgG; the same specimen was stained with Sudan III (Wako, Japan) dissolved in 70% ethanol to visualize lipid droplets. DNA was stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. In some experiments, lipid droplets were stained by Oil red O (Sigma). The specimens were observed with a Zeiss Axioplan-2 microscope. Image acquisition and post-processing were performed with Northern Eclipse software (Empix, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). For studying the effect of leptomycin on intracellular localization of Prp19p, differentiated adipocytes were treated with or without 20 nm leptomycin B (Sigma) for 8 h. Modification of Prp19p Expression in 3T3-L1 Cells through Transfection with Either pcDNA3.1-mPrp19 or pSilencer 2.1-U6 Puro-mPrp19 RNAi—RNAi directed against the mPrp19 gene was designed using Silencer pre-designed RNAi (Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX) and subcloned into the BamHI/HindIII site of pSilencer 2.1-U6 puro (Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX). The following oligonucleotides were used: RNAi-1, sense template 5′-GATCCGCTGGACAACAACTTTGAGTTCAAGAGACTCAAAGTTGTTGTCCAGCTGTTTTTTGGAAA-3′ and antisense template 5′-AGCTTTTCCAAAAAACAGCTGGACAACAACTTTGAGTCTCTTGAACTCAAAGTTGTTGTCCAGCG-3′; RNAi-2, sense template 5′-GATCCGCAGCTCATCGACATCAAATTTTCAAGAGATTTGATGTCGATGAGCTGCTCTTTTTTGGAAA-3′ and antisense template 5′-AGCTTTTCCAAAAAAGAGCAGCTCATCGACATCAAATCTCTTGAGTTTGATGTCGATGAGCTGCTCG-3′; RNAi-3, sense template 5′-GATCCGCTCATCGACATCAAAGTTCTCAAGAGAAACTTTGATGTCGATGAGCTGTTTTTTGGAAA-3′ and antisense template 5′-AGCTTTTCCAAAAAACAGCTCATCGACATCAAAGTTTCTCTTGAGAACTTTGATGTCGATGAGCG-3′. To produce Prp19p-overexpressing preadipocytes, mouse Prp19 (mPrp19) cDNA fragment was obtained by RT-PCR by using 3T3-L1 poly(A)+ mRNA and the following primers: 5′-ATGTCCCTGATCTGCTCGATCTCC-3′ and 5′-ACTACTGAGATGAGGCCCAGAACTGT-3′. The mPrp19 cDNA was subcloned into the XabI and BamHI sites of the pCDNA3.1 expression vector (Invitrogen). The sequences of pSilencer 2.1-U6 puro-mPrp19 RNAi and pcDNA3.1-mPrp19 were verified by DNA sequencing. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were transfected with either pcDNA3.1, pcDNA3.1-mPrpp19, pSilencer 2.1-U6 puro Negative Control (Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX), or pSilencer 2.1-U6 puro-mPrp19 RNAi using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). Cells stably expressing Prp19p were selected by resistance to geneticin at 0.5 mg/ml culture medium. For down-regulation of mPrp19 expression, cells transfected with pSilencer 2.1-U6 puro-mPrp19 RNAi vector were selected with puromycin (1.5 μg/ml) for 7 days. The RNAi-3 construct could efficiently knock down Prp19p protein expression. To minimize for clone-specific effects, each study was performed with pools of three Prp19p down-regulated clones. Real Time Quantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The pre-designed primers and probe sets of SREBP-1c, aP2, glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase, diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 1, S3-12, SCD1, perilipin, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were obtained from Applied Biosystems (assay identifications are as follows: Mm00550338_m1, Mm00445880_m1, Mm00515643_m1, Mm00833328_m1, Mm00491061_m1, Mm00558672_m1, Mm00772290_m1, and Mm99999915_q1). The reaction mixture was prepared using a Quantitect probe PCR kit (Qiagen, GmbH, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reaction and analysis were performed using the Rotor-Gene 3000 system (Corbett Research, Sydney, Australia). All reactions were done in triplicate. The amount of mRNA was calculated by the comparative CT method. Lipid Analysis—Cellular triglyceride content was determined by extracting cells with 2:1 chloroform/methanol onto ammonium sulfate-impregnated Silica Gel H thin layer chromatography plates. Plates were developed in 90:10:1 hexane/diethyl ether/formic acid and charred at 160 °C for 1–2 h. Spots corresponding to the various lipid classes were quantitated by densitometry using a computing densitometer from GE Healthcare; relative spot densities were calculated using ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare) and compared with lipid standards resolved on the same plates. Intracellular lipid accumulation was also determined by Sudan II staining. The cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 20 min on ice, and stained with 0.5% (w/v) Sudan II (Wako, Japan) in 60% (v/v) isopropyl alcohol for 1 h at room temperature. After staining, the cells were washed with 70% ethanol to remove excess stain. Stained oil droplets in the cells were dissolved in isopropyl alcohol containing 4% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 and spectrophotometrically measured at an absorbance of 490 nm. Lipolysis—3T3-L1 adipocytes were incubated in a low glucose DMEM medium (Invitrogen) containing 2% (w/v) fatty acid-free BSA with or without 10 μm isoproterenol. Glycerol content of the incubation medium was determined using a colorimetric assay (GPO-Trinder; Sigma). Protein content was determined using a BCA protein assay (Pierce). Fatty Acid Oxidation—3T3-L1 adipocytes placed in a 12-well plate were washed and incubated in low glucose DMEM (Invitrogen) containing 2% (w/v) fatty acid-free BSA, 0.3 mm l-carnitine, and [3H]palmitic acid (3 μCi/well). Excess [3H]palmitic acid in the medium was removed twice by trichloroacetic acid precipitation. The supernatant was extracted twice with chloroform/methanol (2:1) and then counted for 3H2O production. Statistical Analysis—Data are presented as mean ± S.D. Two-tailed Student's tests were used to calculate statistical significance. Identification of Prp19p as a New Lipid Droplet-associated Protein—To explore proteins that are involved in lipid droplet biogenesis, we isolated lipid droplets from cultured 3T3-L1 adipocyte cells collected at 10 days after the initiation of differentiation, and we identified the proteins associated with lipid droplets using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and tandem mass spectroscopy (Table 1). One of the identified proteins was mPrp19p, the mouse homolog of the protein encoded by the Pso4/Prp19 gene in S. cerevisiae. We amplified the murine Prp19 cDNA from the 3T3-L1 adipocytes using RT-PCR in order to use to confirm the localization of Prp19p to lipid droplets and to study Prp19p expression and function.TABLE 1Proteins associated with isolated 3T3-L1 adipocytes lipid dropletsGroupSpotpIMassIdentificationGI no.Previously found in lipid droplet preparationsRef.kDaKnown lipid droplet-associated proteins15.4361.20Perilipin13385312Yes17Greenberg A.S.

Prp19p was strongly detected on the surface of lipid droplets (Fig. 1A), having distributions similar to those of a well known lipid droplet-associated protein, perilipin. An immunoblotting analysis of lipid droplet fractions also revealed that Prp19p specifically associated with lipid droplets of adipocytes (Fig. 1B). The expression level of Prp19p in various mouse tissues was also examined. Prp19p was expressed at high levels in white adipose tissue, brown adipose tissue, and brain tissue and to a much lesser degree in other tissues (Fig. 1C). We also observed Prp19p expression increase during the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes into adipocytes (Fig. 1D). These data suggest that Prp19p might participate in lipid droplet biogenesis. Expression Pattern of Prp19p According to Its Subcellular Localization in 3T3-L1 Adipocytes—Because Prp19p was detected both on the lipid droplet and nucleus in differentiated adipocytes, we suspected that there was the potential cross-talk between events at the lipid droplet and events in the nucleus.

https://openalex.org/W2004300712,"Zinc deficiency is a potential risk factor for disease in humans because it leads to increased oxidative stress and DNA damage. We show here that the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae also experiences oxidative stress when zinc-deficient, and we have identified one mechanism yeast cells use to defend themselves against this stress. The Zap1p transcription factor is a central player in the response of yeast to zinc deficiency. To identify genes important for growth in low zinc, DNA microarrays were used to identify genes directly regulated by Zap1p. We found that the TSA1 gene is one such Zap1p target whose expression is increased under zinc deficiency. TSA1 encodes a cytosolic thioredoxin-dependent peroxidase responsible for degrading hydrogen peroxide and organic hydroperoxides. Consistent with its regulation by Zap1p, we showed that tsa1Δ mutants have a growth defect in low zinc that can be suppressed by zinc but not by other metals. Anaerobic conditions also suppressed the tsa1Δ low zinc growth defect indicating that oxidative stress is the likely cause of the poor growth. Consistent with this hypothesis, we demonstrated that zinc deficiency causes increased reactive oxygen species in wild type cells and that this increase is further exacerbated in tsa1Δ mutants. The role of this regulation by Zap1p in limiting oxidative stress in low zinc was confirmed when the Zap1p-binding site was specifically mutated in the chromosomal TSA1 promoter. Thus, we conclude that TSA1 induction by Zap1p is an adaptive response to deal with the increased oxidative stress caused by zinc deficiency.

Zinc is an essential nutrient for all organisms because it is required as a structural and/or catalytic cofactor by hundreds of proteins. It was recently estimated that almost 3000 different proteins encoded by the human genome, i.e. ∼10% of all human proteins, bind zinc (1Andreini C. Banci L. Bertini I. Rosato A. J. Proteome Res. 2006; 5: 196-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). Because of the many functions of zinc, nutritional deficiency of this metal perturbs a wide variety of processes. In mammals, zinc deficiency is associated with retarded growth, immune system dysfunction, and impaired reproduction (2Prasad A.S. Prasad A.S. Biochemistry of Zinc. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1993: 219-258Crossref Google Scholar, 3Hambidge M. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: S1344-S1349Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, studies both in vitro and in vivo have established that zinc deficiency leads to increased oxidative stress in mammalian cells (for review see Ref. 4Powell S.R. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: S1447-S1454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Zinc deficiency is associated with increased levels of lipid and protein oxidation (5Burke J.P. Fenton M.R. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1985; 179: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 6Oteiza P.I. Olin K.L. Fraga C.G. Keen C.L. J. Nutr. 1995; 125: 823-829PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the oxidative stress associated with zinc deficiency leads to increased levels of DNA damage (6Oteiza P.I. Olin K.L. Fraga C.G. Keen C.L. J. Nutr. 1995; 125: 823-829PubMed Google Scholar, 7Ho E. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16770-16775Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 8Ho E. Courtemanche C. Ames B.N. J. Nutr. 2003; 133: 2543-2548Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). For these reasons, zinc deficiency has been proposed to be an important risk factor for cancer and other human diseases (9Ames B.N. Wakimoto P. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 694-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 10Ho E. J. Nutr. Biochem. 2004; 15: 572-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Because of the important functions of zinc, organisms have evolved with regulatory circuits to maintain intracellular zinc at optimal levels. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, zinc homeostasis is maintained through both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms (11Eide D.J. J. Nutr. 2003; 133: S1532-S1535Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At the level of transcription, expression of many genes is induced in zinc-limited cells through the action of the Zap1p transcription factor (12Zhao H. Eide D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5044-5052Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Under low zinc conditions, Zap1p induces the expression of genes involved in zinc uptake (ZRT1, ZRT2, and FET4) (13Zhao H. Butler E. Rodgers J. Spizzo T. Duesterhoeft S. Eide D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28713-28720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 14Waters B.M. Eide D.J. J. Biol.

In addition, Zap1p regulates the expression of a gene responsible for zinc transport into the secretory pathway (ZRG17) (17Lyons T.J. Gasch A.P. Gaither L.A. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Eide D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7957-7962Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 18Ellis C.D. Macdiarmid C.W. Eide D.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 2006; 281: 13110-13116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Finally, Zap1p induces its own expression under zinc deficiency by positive autoregulation (13Zhao H. Butler E. Rodgers J. Spizzo T. Duesterhoeft S. Eide D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28713-28720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). These many target genes of Zap1p contain one or more 11-bp zinc-responsive elements (ZREs) 2The abbreviations used are: ZREs, zinc-responsive elements; HA, a hemagglutinin antigen; DCF, 2,7-dichlorofluoroscein; DCFH-DA, 2,7-dichlorodihydrofluoroscein diacetate; ROS, reactive oxygen species; AD, activation domain; LZM, low zinc medium. 2The abbreviations used are: ZREs, zinc-responsive elements; HA, a hemagglutinin antigen; DCF, 2,7-dichlorofluoroscein; DCFH-DA, 2,7-dichlorodihydrofluoroscein diacetate; ROS, reactive oxygen species; AD, activation domain; LZM, low zinc medium. in their promoters to which Zap1p binds. The consensus ZRE sequence has been identified as 5′-ACCTTNAAGGT-3′ (17Lyons T.J. Gasch A.P. Gaither L.A. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Eide D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7957-7962Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The Zap1p protein has three known functional domains. At its C terminus is a DNA binding domain consisting of five C2H2 zinc finger motifs (21Bird A. Evans-Galea M.V. Blankman E. Zhao H. Luo H. Winge D.R. Eide D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16160-16166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 22Evans-Galea M.V. Blankman E. Myszka D.G. Bird A.J. Eide D.J. Winge D.R. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1053-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Zap1p also contains two activation domains that are independently regulated by zinc (23Bird A.J. Zhao H. Luo H. Jensen L.T. Srinivasan C. Evans-Galea M. Winge D.R. Eide D.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3704-3713Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Zinc-regulated activation domain 1 (AD1) maps to residues 182–502 (24Herbig A. Bird A.J. Swierczek S. McCall K. Mooney M. Wu C.Y. Winge D.R. Eide D.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 834-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The second Zap1p activation domain is designated AD2. The AD2 region, residues 611–641, is located within two additional C2H2 zinc fingers (25Bird A. McCall K. Kramer M. Blankman E. Winge D. Eide D. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5137-5146Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). These activation domains are apparently regulated by zinc binding directly to Zap1p. Thus, mutation of known or potential zinc ligand residues in AD1 and AD2, such as in the “Zap1pTriple/C2Q2” (referred to here as “Zap1pTC”) allele (24Herbig A. Bird A.J. Swierczek S. McCall K. Mooney M. Wu C.Y. Winge D.R. Eide D.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 834-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), inhibit the zinc responsiveness of Zap1p and render its activity constitutive. Previous microarray studies indicated that Zap1p regulates the expression of more than 40 genes in the yeast genome (17Lyons T.J. Gasch A.P. Gaither L.A. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Eide D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7957-7962Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). These previous studies were performed under conditions of relatively moderate zinc deficiency, i.e. conditions that may have missed Zap1p targets only induced by more severe zinc limitation. In this study, we conducted new microarray experiments using conditions of severe zinc deficiency in an effort to identify Zap1p target genes not recognized previously. As a result, we describe here the identification of one such new Zap1p target gene, TSA1. TSA1 encodes a cytosolic thioredoxin-dependent peroxidase responsible for the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide and organic hydroperoxides (26Rhee S.G. Chae H.Z. Kim K. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2005; 38: 1543-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar). We show that Tsa1p is required for growth under zinc-limiting conditions and that induction by Zap1p is an adaptive response to the increased oxidative stress experienced by zinc-deficient cells. With the identification of TSA1 as a Zap1p target gene, we have uncovered a new mechanism for how zinc-deficient cells adapt to and survive the stress of low zinc. Growth Conditions and Strains—Yeast cells were grown in YPD (YP medium + 2% glucose) and in synthetic defined SD medium with 2% glucose and any necessary auxotrophic requirements (27Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2526) Google Scholar). YPD and SD are zinc-replete because they contain micromolar levels of zinc and lack strong zinc chelators. Yeasts were made zinc limited by culturing in low zinc medium (LZM) prepared as described previously (28Gitan R.S. Luo H. Rodgers J. Broderius M. Eide D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28617-28624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). LZM is zinc limiting because it contains 1 mm EDTA and 20 mm citrate to buffer metal availability. Zinc was added as ZnCl2. Cells were grown anaerobically using the BBL™ GasPak™ system (Pharmingen). Strains used are listed in Table 1. CWY14 was constructed by first integrating the CORE cassette containing the Kluveromyces lactis URA3 gene and kanMX4 into the TSA1 promoter of CWY2 deleting bases –203 to –149 (numbered relative to the first base of the ATG start codon). The promoter fragment from pTSA1m3ZRE1-lacZ (see below) was then transformed into the CORE cassette-containing strain and selected for loss of the URA3 gene by selection on 5-fluoroorotic acid (29Boeke J.D. Trueheart J. Natsoulis G. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 164-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1065) Google Scholar). Correct mutation of the chromosomal TSA1 promoter was confirmed by PCR and DNA sequencing.TABLE 1Strains used in this studyDY1457MATa ade6 can1 his3 leu2 trp1 ura3ZHY6DY1457 zap1Δ::TRP1BY4743MATa/MATα his3/his3 leu2/leu2 ura3/ura3 lys2/+ met15/+BY4743 zap1ΔBY4743 zap1Δ::kanMX4/ zap1Δ::kanMX4BY4743 tsa1ΔBY4743 tsa1Δ::kanMX4/ tsa1Δ::kanMX4BY4743 zrt1ΔBY4743 zrt1Δ::kanMX4/ zrt1Δ::kanMX4CWY2MATα his3 leu2 ura3CWY8CWY2 tsa1Δ::kanMX4CWY14CWY2 tsa1-1m3ZRE1 Open table in a new tab RNA and Protein Analysis—The microarray analyses used cells grown under three different paired conditions, and each experiment was performed in duplicate with independent cultures. In experiment 1, wild type (DY1457) cells were grown in zinc-limiting (LZM + 3 μm ZnCl2) and in zinc-replete (LZM + 3000 μm ZnCl2) media for 14–16 h and harvested at an optical density measured at 600 nm (OD600) of ∼0.7. In experiment 2, wild type (DY1457) and zap1Δ mutant (ZHY6) cells were initially grown in zinc-replete LZM + 1000 μm ZnCl2 to exponential phase, washed twice in LZM + 1 μm ZnCl2, and then inoculated into zinc-limiting LZM + 1 μm ZnCl2 and grown for 6 h prior to harvesting. The final OD600 was ∼0.7. In experiment 3, wild type DY1457 cells were transformed with the vector (pYef2) or a plasmid encoding a constitutive allele of Zap1p, pYef2-Zap1pTC, under the regulation of the galactose-inducible GAL1 promoter (24Herbig A. Bird A.J. Swierczek S. McCall K. Mooney M. Wu C.Y. Winge D.R. Eide D.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 834-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). These transformants were inoculated into zinc-replete SD medium + 2% galactose and grown for 20–24 h before harvesting at an OD600 of ∼0.8. Total RNA was extracted with hot phenol, and mRNA was isolated using the PolyATtract® mRNA Isolation System IV kit (Promega). Microarray analyses were performed as described previously (30Rutherford J.C. Ojeda L. Balk J. Muhlenhoff U. Lill R. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10135-10140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). S1 nuclease protection assays were performed with total RNA as described (31Dohrmann P.R. Butler G. Tamai K. Dorland S. Greene J.R. Thiele D.J. Stillman D.J. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). For each reaction, 15 μg of total RNA was hybridized to a 32P-end-labeled DNA oligonucleotide probe before digestion with S1 nuclease and separation on a 10% polyacrylamide, 5 m urea polyacrylamide gel. Band intensities were quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Crude protein extracts were generated by lysis in trichloroacetic acid, and immunoblot analysis was performed as described previously (24Herbig A. Bird A.J. Swierczek S. McCall K. Mooney M. Wu C.Y. Winge D.R. Eide D.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 834-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The primary antibodies used were anti-HA (Roche Applied Science) and anti-Pgk1 (Molecular Probes). Promoter Motif Analysis—ZREs were identified using a position-specific probability matrix generated from the ZREs of the 46 potential Zap1p targets identified previously (17Lyons T.J. Gasch A.P. Gaither L.A. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Eide D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7957-7962Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Potential ZREs in the TSA1 promoter were then identified using this matrix and RSA-TOOLS. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—The Zap1p DNA binding domain (Zap1pDBD, residues 687–880) was expressed in Escherichia coli as a fusion to glutathione S-transferase and purified, and the glutathione S-transferase tag was then removed as described previously (21Bird A.

Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed as described previously using purified Zap1pDBD protein and radiolabeled ZRE oligonucleotides (Table 2) (21Bird A. Evans-Galea M.V. Blankman E.

In brief, 50 pmol of 32P-end-labeled oligonucleotides were purified using G-50 Quick Spin columns (Roche Applied Science). Double-stranded oligonucleotides were prepared by annealing 1 μm complementary single-stranded oligonucleotides in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA. The annealing mixtures were incubated for 15 min at 85 °C and then 55 °C for 4 h. For electrophoretic mobility shift assays, 15-μl reactions were prepared containing 0.5 pmol of radiolabeled DNA oligonucleotide (20,000 cpm/pmol), 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.02 mg/ml poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC), 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.04% IGEPAL CA-630, 10% glycerol, and the indicated concentrations of purified Zap1pDBD. After incubation for 1 h at room temperature, the samples were resolved on 6% polyacrylamide gels. Gels were dried onto blotting paper, and the signals were visualized by autoradiography.TABLE 2Oligonucleotides used for EMSA experiments Open table in a new tab Plasmid Constructs—Reporter plasmid pTSA1-lacZ was constructed in YEp353 (32Myers A.M.

PCR products were generated from genomic DNA that contained 1000 bp of TSA1 promoter sequence (bases –1000 to +1) flanked by homology to the vector. This fragment was gel-purified and cotransformed with EcoRI- and BamHI-digested YEp353; transformants were selected for URA3 prototrophy. The mutant alleles of TSA1 ZRE1 and/or ZRE2 elements (pTSA1m3ZRE1-lacZ, pTSA1mZRE2-lacZ, and pTSA1mZRE1/2-lacZ) were constructed in a similar fashion after generation of the mutant promoter fragments by overlap PCR (34Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6771) Google Scholar). To generate pFL-TSA1, the TSA1 open reading frame plus 1 kb of upstream and 0.5 kb of downstream flanking sequence was amplified by PCR and inserted by homologous recombination into BamHI- and BstXI-digested pFL38. Plasmid pFL-TSA1C47S was generated in the same way following site-directed mutagenesis of Tsa1p residue Cys-47 by overlap PCR. A single hemagglutinin antigen epitope tag (35Kolodziej P.A. Young R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 508-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar) was inserted at the N terminus of the TSA1 open reading frame in these two plasmids, generating pTSA1-HA and pTSA1C47S-HA, by overlap PCR and insertion into pFL38 by homologous recombination. Function of the TSA1 allele in pTSA1-HA was confirmed by complementation of the mutant defects of a tsa1Δ strain. All plasmid constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing.

Microbiol. 2005; 57: 834-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) were described previously. β-Galactosidase Assays—Cells were grown for 15–20 h to exponential phase in the indicated media. β-Galactosidase activity was measured in permeabilized cells as described previously (37Guarente L. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar), and activity units were calculated as follows: (ΔA420 × 1000)/(min × ml of culture × the culture OD600). DCF Assays—Measurement of the production of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) used 2,7-dichlorodihydrofluoroscein diacetate (DCFH-DA) (Calbiochem). DCFH-DA is membrane-permeable and is trapped intracellularly following deacetylation. The resulting compound, DCFH, reacts with ROS (primarily H2O2 and hydroxyl radicals) to produce the oxidized fluorescent form 2,7-dichlorofluoroscein (DCF). ROS analysis using DCFH-DA was performed as follows. Yeast cells were treated with 10 μm DCFH-DA in culture media for 1 h prior to harvesting. Cells were then washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline, and disrupted by vortexing with glass beads. Following centrifugation at 13,200 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was collected, and protein concentration was measured by the Bradford method (38Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). DCF fluorescence intensity was measured at an excitation wavelength of 504 nm and an emission wavelength of 524 nm and then normalized to protein level. Glutathione Assays—Glutathione levels were measured using the method described by Vandeputte et al. (39Vandeputte C. Guizon I. Genestie-Denis I. Vannier B. Lorenzon G. Cell Biol. Toxicol. 1994; 10: 415-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Cells were grown to exponential phase (∼1 × 107 cells/ml), washed twice with distilled deionized H2O, and resuspended in 250 μl of cold 1% 5-sulfosalicylic acid. Cells were broken by vortexing with glass beads and incubated at 4 °C for 15 min to precipitate protein prior to centrifugation for 10 min at 13,200 × g. The supernatants were used to determine glutathione levels. Total glutathione was determined by adding 10 μl of lysate to 150 μl of assay mixture (0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, 0.03 mg/ml 5, 5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), 0.12 unit of glutathione reductase). The samples were mixed and incubated for 5 min at room temperature, and 50 μl of NADPH (0.16 mg/ml) was then added. The formation of thiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) was monitored spectrophotometrically at 420 nm over a 5-min period. The reaction rate was proportional to the concentration of glutathione. Standard curves were generated for each experiment using 0–0.5 nmol of glutathione in 1% 5-sulfosalicylic acid. To measure GSSG alone, 100-μl lysate samples were derivatized by adding 2 μl of 97% 2-vinylpyridine, and the pH was adjusted by adding 2 μl of 25% triethanolamine. These samples were then incubated at room temperature for 60 min. The samples were then assayed as described above for total glutathione. GSSG standards (0–0.1 nmol) were also treated with 2-vinylpyridine in an identical manner to the samples. Subtraction of the amount of GSSG in the lysate from the total glutathione concentration allowed a determination of GSH levels present in each sample. TSA1 Is a Zap1p Target Gene—We used DNA microarray analysis to find genes with expression patterns consistent with their regulation by Zap1p. First, we identified genes that were expressed at higher levels in zinc-limited versus zinc-replete wild type cells (experiment 1). Second, we identified genes that were expressed at higher levels in wild type cells versus a zap1Δ mutant strain grown under zinc-limiting conditions (experiment 2). Third, we identified genes with increased expression when a wild type strain was transformed with a constitutive Zap1p mutant allele (Zap1pTC) versus the vector and grown on zinc-replete media (experiment 3). Zap1pTC is not repressed by high zinc because of mutations in both AD1 and AD2 that disrupt zinc regulation (24Herbig A. Bird A.J. Swierczek S. McCall K. Mooney M. Wu C.Y. Winge D.R. Eide D.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 834-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Each experiment was performed in duplicate with independent cultures. Several known Zap1p target genes were found to have increased expression in these experiments including ZRT1, ZRT2, ZRT3, ZRC1, and FET4 (Table 3). One additional gene that showed these effects was the TSA1 gene that encodes the major cytosolic peroxiredoxin isozyme. Peroxiredoxins are antioxidant proteins that reduce hydrogen peroxide, peroxynitrite, and organic hydroperoxides using thioredoxin as the electron donor (26Rhee S.G. Chae H.Z. Kim K. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2005; 38: 1543-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar). This report focuses on TSA1, and the complete results of these microarray experiments will be addressed in another report.TABLE 3Summary of key microarray resultsGeneFunctionFold inductionaFold induction for experiments 1-3 is reported for each gene in duplicate experiments A and B.Exp. 1, wild type, -Zn/+ZnExp. 2, wild type/zap1Δ, -ZnExp.3, Zap1pTC/WT, +ZnExp.

Open table in a new tab The microarray results suggested that TSA1 is a Zap1p target gene. To confirm these observations, cells were grown as they were for the microarray experiments 1–3, and TSA1 mRNA levels were assayed by S1 nuclease protection assays. As shown in Fig. 1A, this analysis confirmed the microarray results; TSA1 gene expression increased in response to zinc deficiency (experiment 1); this response was dependent on Zap1p (experiment 2), and TSA1 expression was increased by the constitutive Zap1pTC allele (experiment 3). The CMD1 gene encoding calmodulin was used as a loading control for these assays. We also assayed TSA1 mRNA levels over a range of zinc concentrations to determine what severity of zinc deficiency was required for this induction. As shown in Fig. 1B, TSA1 expression was induced during growth in LZM medium with 3 μm or lower added zinc. This corresponds to conditions of severe degree of zinc deficiency as determined in previous studies (40Zhao H. Eide D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2454-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). No induction was observed in a zap1Δ mutant consistent with the hypothesis that TSA1 is a Zap1p target. To confirm that changes in mRNA levels also alter Tsa1p protein levels, we inserted a hemagglutinin antigen (HA) epitope tag at the N terminus of the TSA1 open reading frame expressed from its own promoter. This epitope-tagged allele was found to fully complement tsa1Δ mutant phenotypes (see below). We then assayed Tsa1p protein levels over a range of zinc concentrations by immunoblotting. Tsa1p protein levels increased greater than 2-fold in response to zinc deficiency with the same dose-response profile as was observed for the TSA1 mRNA (Fig. 1C). No change in level was observed for a control protein, 3-phosphoglycerate kinase (Pgk1). Thus, Tsa1p protein levels correlate with the observed changes in mRNA level. An additional feature of Zap1p target genes is the presence of one or more ZREs in their promoters. To identify potential ZREs in the TSA1 promoter, a motif identification algorithm (RSA-TOOLS) was used to scan the promoters of TSA1 and several known Zap1p target genes for potential ZREs. Two candidate ZREs, designated ZRE1 and ZRE2, were identified in the TSA1 promoter located between 160 and 195 bp upstream of the open reading frame (Table 4). The start site for TSA1 transcription has not yet been determined. The numerical RSAT scores, a representation of the match of the sequence to the consensus, of these putative ZREs were relatively low but still higher than the scores of some ZRE sequences from other promoters that have been shown experimentally to be functional in vivo (e.g. ZRE3 of ZRT2) (41Bird A.J.

Adenosylation of the corrinoid ring of Cbl generates coenzyme B12 (adenosylcobalamin, AdoCbl), an essential cofactor used by enzymes that catalyze intramolecular rearrangements (2Halpern J.

Corrinoid adenosyltransferases play a key role in the biosynthesis of AdoCbl by covalently attaching the 5′-deoxyadenosyl moiety from ATP to the Co(I) ion of the corrin ring of Cbl (10Vitols E.

These enzymes generate a biologically unique, labile cobaltcarbon bond that is the source of the unusual chemistry associated with the B12 cofactor. As such, understanding the mechanistic strategies of those enzymes involved in the formation of this carbon-metal bond is of considerable interest. In Salmonella enterica, three separate cob(I)alamin adenosyltransferases have been identified: CobA, PduO, and EutT. All cob(I)alamin adenosyltransferases identified to date belong to one of these three distinct families. CobA is the housekeeping enzyme of S. enterica and is involved in the anaerobic de novo synthesis of AdoCbl. The structure and function of this enzyme has been well characterized (12Bauer C.B.

Both PduO and EutT are encoded within large, discreet operons of S. enterica where they play specialized roles in the catabolism of 1,2-propanediol or ethanolamine (17Buan N.R. Suh S.J.

Despite its specialized role in S. enterica, the PduO-type enzyme is the most widely distributed of these adenosyltransferases with homologues identified in species of archaeotes and prokaryotes, as well as in many eukaryotes, ranging from yeast to humans (19Leal N.A.

In animals, PduO is the only cob(I)alamin adenosyltransferase enzyme available for the assimilation of dietary cobalamins into coenzyme B12. Humans, who lack the ability to synthesize Cbl de novo, produce AdoCbl from reduced Cbl through a PduO-type adenosyltransferase (19Leal N.A. Park S.D. Kima P.E. Bobik T.A. J. Biol.

Initial biochemical, functional, and structural characterization of PduO-type corrinoid adenosyltransferases has recently been reported, including a high-resolution three-dimensional crystal structure of the PduO-type enzyme from the archaeon Thermoplasma acidophilum (23Saridakis V. Yakunin A. Xu X. Anandakumar P. Pennycooke M. Gu J. Cheung F. Lew J.M. Sanishvili R. Joachimiak A. Arrowsmith C.H. Christendat D. Edwards A.M. J. Biol.

These structures reveal that the enzyme is a trimer with each subunit composed of a five helix-bundle. Unfortunately, the absence of bound substrates in these crystal structures has precluded identification of a definitive location for the active site. Whereas both the CobA- and PduO-type adenosyltransferases catalyze the elimination of tripolyphosphate from ATP (a relatively rare mechanism among the vast families of ATP-utilizing enzymes), the CobA-type adenosyltransferases utilize an inverted P-loop motif for ATP binding and elimination of tripolyphosphate while the PduO-type enzymes apparently lack such a motif (12Bauer C.B.

Recently, Lactobacillus reuteri strain CRL1098 was discovered to make B12 de novo (26Taranto M.P. Vera J.L. Hugenholtz J. De Valdez G.F. Sesma F. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 5643-5647Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), and a gene putatively encoding a homolog of the SePduO enzyme was identified among the cluster of B12 biosynthetic genes of this bacterium (GenBank™ accession number AY780645). In this study, we report the three-dimensional crystal structure of L. reuteri PduO-type corrinoid adenosyltransferase (LrPduO) complexed with MgATP at 1.68-Å resolution and provide a kinetic characterization of the enzyme. Despite limited sequence identity (31%), the LrPduO protein shares a common fold with the apo PduO protein from T. acidophilum (TaPduO). Our structure model reveals the active site in a deep cleft at the subunit interface made up, in part, of the immediate N terminus of the protein. A description of the active site unveils a previously unseen ATP binding motif and provides a framework for better understanding the various mechanistic strategies employed by cob(I)-alamin adenosyltransferase enzymes. Further, this description of ATP binding allows fresh insight into the molecular basis for protein malfunction in mutations of the human corrinoid adenosyltransferase. Construction of Expression Vectors—To generate an N-terminal (His)6-tagged recombinant construct of PduO, the L. reuteri pduO gene (GenBank™ accession number AY780645) was PCR-amplified from L. reuteri strain CRL1098 genomic DNA isolated as described (27Pospiech A. Neumann B. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 217-218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). The primers used for amplification were 5′-CGGGATCCGTGAAGATTTATACAAAAAATGG-3′ (forward), and 5′-GGAATTCTTAGCGGAAAACGTCTTTACTGTT-3′ (reverse). The PCR fragment was restriction-digested with BamHI and EcoRI and ligated into the pET-28b vector (EMD Biosciences, Inc.) generating the expression plasmid pPDU19 (Table 1), which expresses the recombinant PduO protein with a 35-amino acid N-terminal tag. To generate a recombinant protein with a rTEV protease-cleavable N-terminal (His)6 tag, the L. reuteri pduO gene was PCR-amplified from plasmid pPDU19. The primers used for the amplification were 5′-AAAAAAACCATGGTGAAGATTTATACAAAAAATGGTGATAAAGGGC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TTTTTTGCGGCCGCTTAGCGGAAAAC-3′ (reverse). The PCR fragment was cut with NcoI and NotI and was ligated into vector pTEV3 (Table 1) yielding plasmid pPDU22. The pPDU22 vector directs the synthesis of a recombinant N-terminally tagged protein with the Tev protease site four residues upstream of the first amino acid of the LrPduO protein. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of this construct is MSYYHHHHHHDYDIPTSENLYFQGASAPM1V2... where the location of the TEV protease cleavage site is underlined.TABLE 1Strains and plasmids Unless otherwise stated, strains were constructed during the course of these studies.GenotypeSource or Ref.Plasmids pET-15bbla+Novagen pCOBA17pET15b cobASe+ bla+Escalante-Semerena lab collection pPDU19pET28b pduOLr+ kan+ pTEV3pET31b H6-tag, rTEV site at NdeI and Bpu1102I, MCS (NheI, NcoI EcoRI, XhoI, SacI, SmaI, BamHI, SacII, NotI, Bpu1102I) bla+ lacI+Escalante-Semerena lab collection pPDU22pTEV3 pduOLr+ bla+Strains E. coli(JE3892)BL21(λDE3) F- dcm impT hsdS(rB- mB-) gal λ(DE3)New England Biolabs S. entericaaDerivatives of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium strain LT2TR6583metE205 ara-9 cobA+K.

Vogel and Bonner's no-carbon E (NCE) minimal medium (30Vogel H.J. Bonner D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 218: 97-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Berkowitz D. Hushon J.M. Whitfield H.J. Roth J. Ames B.N. J. Bacteriol. 1968; 96: 215-220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used to assess cobalamin biosynthesis. NCE medium was supplemented with glycerol (22 mm), MgSO4 (1 mm), dicyanocobinamide ((CN)2Cbi, 0.2 μm)), kanamycin (15 μg/ml), or ampicillin (25 μg/ml). Growth behavior was monitored at 650 nm using a Bio-Tek EL808 96-well plate reader. Each well contained 198μl of fresh NCE medium that was inoculated with 2 μl of an overnight culture of the strain of interest grown in LB medium; each strain was analyzed in triplicate. Plates (Becton Dickinson) were incubated under aerobic conditions at 37 °C over a 24-h period. LrPduO Protein Production and Purification—Plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21(λDE3) for overexpression. Strains were grown at 37 °C with shaking in 1 liter of LB medium supplemented with kanamycin (25 μg/ml). After the culture reached an optical density (OD650) of 0.6–0.7, synthesis of the phage T7 RNA polymerase enzyme was induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thio-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.5 mm. Cells were grown for an additional 2 h at 37 °C with shaking, and harvested by centrifugation at 12,000 × g with a Beckman/Coulter Avanti J-25I centrifuge equipped with a JLA-16.250 rotor. The cell pellet was frozen at -80 °C until used. For protein purification, cell pellets were thawed and re-suspended in 20 ml of Tris-HCl buffer (0.1 m, pH 8.0 at 4 °C) containing the protease inhibitor phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (0.8 mm), imidazole (20 mm), and NaCl (0.5 m). Cells were broken using a French pressure cell (1.03 × 107 kPa); three passages ensured >99% breakage. Cell debris was separated from soluble proteins by centrifugation at 4 °C for 45 min at 45,000 × g. The resulting supernatant was filtered (0.45 μm; Nalgene), and proteins were resolved on a 5-ml HisTrap FF column (Amersham Biosciences). Proteins were desorbed from the column with a linear gradient of Tris-HCl buffer (0.1 m, pH 8.0 at 4 °C) containing imidazole (0.5 m) and NaCl (0.5 m); 2-ml fractions were collected. Initial estimates of protein purity were made by SDS-PAGE (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205492) Google Scholar) and Coomassie Blue staining (33Sasse J. Ausubel F.A. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 1. Wiley Interscience, New York1991: 10.6.1-10.6.8Google Scholar). Fractions containing LrPduO protein of the highest purity were pooled and sequentially dialyzed at 4 °C against buffer A (Tris-HCl (0.1 m, pH 8 at 4 °C) containing NaCl (0.5 m), EDTA, 2 mm), buffer B (buffer A lacking EDTA), and buffer C (Tris-HCl (10 mm, pH 8 at 4 °C) containing NaCl (0.3 m) and Mg-ATP (3 mm)). Final protein purity was assessed with Fotodyne's FOTO/Eclipse® Electronic Documentation & Analysis System, including software packages FOTO/Analyst® PC Image v5.0 and TotalL-abTM one-dimensional gel analysis v2003 from NonLinear Dynamics, Ltd. Purified LrPduO protein was estimated to be >99% homogeneous and gave a yield of 40 mg from 1 liter of broth culture. This highly purified LrPduO protein was flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen in 40-μl droplets and stored at -80 °C until used. LrPduO protein with a TEV cleavable, N-terminal poly-His tag was overproduced from plasmid pPDU22 and initially purified as described above. Prior to dialysis, purified rTEV protease (34Haspel J.

The mixture was dialyzed overnight against buffer D (buffer A containing imidazole, 10 mm), followed by a 4-h dialysis at 4 °C against buffer E (Tris-HCl, 0.1 m, pH 8 at 4 °C containing NaCl, 0.5 m, and imidazole, 10 mm). The rTEV:LrPduO protein mixture was loaded onto a 5-ml HisTrap FF column. The column flow-through was collected and dialyzed against Tris-HCl buffer (0.1 m, pH 8.0 at 4 °C) containing NaCl (0.5 m) and 10% (v/v) glycerol. Tag-less LrPduO used for kinetic analysis was stored at -80 °C until used. In Vitro Adenosyltransferase Activity Assay—Activity assays were performed as described (37Johnson C.L. Pechonick E. Park S.D. Havemann G.D. Leal N.A. Bobik T.A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1577-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. The final volume of each reaction was 1 ml. Empty, sealed quartz cuvettes were flushed with oxygen-free N2 for 5 min. Under a stream of O2-free N2, Tris-HCl (0.2 m; pH 8.0 at 37 °C), hydroxocobalamin (HOCbl 0.1–10 μm), MgCl2 (0.5 mm), ATP (1 μm-1 mm), and Ti(III)citrate (0.1 mm) were added to the cuvette in the order stated. After all additions were made, flushing was continued for 30 s. To ensure that all Co(III) was reduced to Co(I), reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. The adenosylation reaction was initiated by the addition of LrPduO protein (45 nm). Adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl) formation was monitored at 388 nm. Crystallization and Data Collection—Crystals of the recombinant native protein, expressed with a 35-amino acid, N-terminal-(His)6 tag, were grown at 20 °C in hanging drop by mixing 4 μl of 20 mg/ml protein in buffer C with 4 μl of precipitant solution composed of HEPPS (0.1 m, pH 8.5), ammonium sulfate (1.9 m, pH 8.5), MgCl2 (0.1 m), and HOCbl (4 mm). The resulting solution was microseeded after 24 h, resulting in the growth of cubic-shaped, pink crystals (∼300 μm3) within 3–5 days. Crystals were transferred to a synthetic mother liquor solution containing HEPPS, (0.11 m, pH 8.5), ammonium sulfate (1.1 m, pH 8.5), ATP (2 mm), MgCl2 (55 mm), NaCl (165 mm), and HOCbl (15 mm) and allowed to soak for 7 days. The coloration of the crystals darkened from pink to red over the course of the soak. The soaked crystals were incrementally transferred in five steps to a cryoprotectant solution consisting of HEPPS (0.11 m, pH 8.5), ammonium sulfate (1.2 m, pH 8.5), ATP (3 mm), MgCl2 (55 mm), NaCl (0.3 m), HOCbl (15 mm), and glycerol (20% v/v) and were flash cooled in a nitrogen stream at 100 K (Oxford Cryosystems, Oxford, UK). The crystals belonged to the space group I23, with one subunit in the asymmetric unit and the unit cell parameters a = b = c = 110.6 Å. A dataset was collected at the SBC 19BM beamline of Advanced Photon Source in Argonne, IL. Diffraction data were integrated and scaled with the program HKL2000 (38Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

Residues 3–181 for the L. reuteri enzyme were built automatically into the electron density by the program ARP/WARP (40Perrakis A. Harkiolaki M. Wilson K.S. Lamzin V.S. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

Multiple conformations were added with the program COOT (42Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (22497) Google Scholar). Water molecules were added to the dataset by ARP/WARP with subsequent manual verification. The final model, refined to 1.68-Å resolution, includes residues Lys2–Asn182 of LrPduO and the heteroatom Mg-ATP with the following 15 residues displaying multiple conformations: Gln19, Lys45, Ile48, Val54, Ser56, Glu60, Phe67, Ser83, Gln90, Val105, Ala108, Arg128, Arg132, Gln140, Met178. Residues Met1 and Ser183-Arg188, and those residues corresponding to the preceding 35 amino acids of the N-terminal tag were disordered and were not built into the model. The side chains corresponding to Arg14, Glu60, Lys85, Gln104, Lys110, Lys111, Gln146, Arg181, Asn182 were disordered and could not be built into the electron density map. Despite the mild red coloration of crystals grown and soaked in the presence of HOCbl, no electron density was observed in the map that could be attributed to fully occupied HOCbl. All figures of molecular structures were generated with the program PyMOL. A Ramachandran plot shows that 96.9% of the residues are in the most favored region, with one outlier that lies in a flexible loop. Refinement statistics are summarized in Table 2. The LrPduO Protein Has ATP:Co(I)rrinoid Adenosyltransferase Enzyme Activity—Results from complementation studies involving LrPduO protein are shown in Fig. 1. The growth defect of a strain of S. enterica lacking the housekeeping ATP: co(I)rrinoid adenosyltransferase (CobA) enzyme was corrected by the presence of a plasmid encoding the LrPduO protein (Fig. 1, closed versus open triangles). Under the growth conditions used in this study, S. enterica does not express endogenous PduO, nor does it express eutT (44Ailion M. Bobik T.A. Roth J.R. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7200-7208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Sheppard D.E. Roth J.R. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1287-1296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the conditions of the above-mentioned experiments demanded that the LrPduO protein adenosylate cobinamide prior to its conversion to AdoCbl (46Escalante-Semerena J.C. Suh S.J. Roth J.R. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 273-280Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, on the basis of these data, it is concluded that LrPduO is involved in corrinoid adenosylation. Given the homology of LrPduO to the N-terminal domain of S. enterica PduO (SePduO; Fig. 2), it was hypothesized that the LrPduO protein catalyzes the formation of the unique Co-C bond between the 5′-deoxyadenosyl moiety of ATP and the cobalt ion of the corrin ring.FIGURE 2Multiple protein sequence alignment for PduO-type adenosyltransferase enzymes. Alignments were generated using T-Coffee (55Notredame C. Higgins D.G. Heringa J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 205-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (5332) Google Scholar). All aligned sequences are from confirmed structural and/or functional homologues of PduO. The sequences for both Homo sapiens and B. taurus are shown without the predicted N-terminal mitochondrion-targeting sequence and only the N-terminal domain of the S. enterica sequence is shown. The numbering corresponds to the sequence for the L. reuteri enzyme. The residues shaded in black are universally conserved while the boxed residues are strongly conserved.

Initial velocity kinetic determinations were performed using chemically reduced cob(I)alamin and ATP as substrates for purified LrP-duO protein that did or did not have an N-terminal tag. Kinetic constants were measured by holding one substrate at saturation while the other was varied (Table 3). These data confirmed that the LrPduO protein has ATP:cob(I)-alamin adenosyltransferase enzyme activity. The apparent Km for ATP (Km, 2 μm) at saturating cob(I)alamin is similar to the one reported for the human PduO-type adenosyltransferase (Km, 6 μm) (20Leal N.A. Olteanu H. Banerjee R. Bobik T.A. J.

Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 7881-7887Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Notably, the apparent Km for cob(I)alamin at saturating ATP is at least 10-fold lower than any previously reported Km value for any type of ATP:adenosyltransferase (Km, 1–5 μm). The apparent kcat for the L. reuteri enzyme (0.03 s-1) is also lower than what has been reported for other adenosyltransferases (kcat = 0.1– 0.3 s-1), bringing the kcat/Km values for the L. reuteri enzyme within the range of what has been reported for the other enzymes (kcat/Km = 104–105 m-1 s-1). Our results indicate that the presence of the 35-residue N-terminal tag has only a small effect on the reaction kinetics. Similar kinetic res"

The type of cell death in neuronal excitotoxicity seems to depend on the nature of the injury. Necrosis occurs after an acute insult, whereas apoptotic cell death is involved in propagation of the secondary injury (10Bonfoco E. Krainc D. Ankarcrona M. Nicotera P. Lipton S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Despite the initial promise of NMDA receptor antagonists and calcium channel blockers for the reduction of excitotoxic damage, clinical trials with these agents had to be abandoned because of toxic side-effects (15Gladstone D.J.

The intervention of signaling events, which are downstream in excitotoxic cascade, might provide new strategies for the treatment of neuronal excitotoxicity.

The effect of the cAMP signaling pathway on cell survival depends on cell type and the specific type of cellular stress and may be influenced by cross-talk with other signaling pathways. The paradoxical roles of cAMP in neuronal death have been reported. cAMP has been shown to protect against cell death in cerebellar granule cells and promote the survival of rat sympathetic and sensory neurons in culture (23Rydel R.E. Greene L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1257-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 24D'Mello S.R. Galli C. Ciotti T. Calissano P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In contrast, cAMP has also been shown to inhibit some forms of neurotrophin-mediated neuronal survival after serum deprivation in cultured cortical neurons (26Poser S. Impey S. Xia Z. Storm D.R. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 4420-4427Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, NMDA-induced neuronal death can be prevented through the inhibition of cAMP accumulation by cannabinoids (27Zhuang S.Y. Bridges D. Grigorenko E. McCloud S. Boon A. Hampson R.E. Deadwyler S.A. Neuropharmacology. 2005; 48: 1086-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). One possible explanation for the dual effects of cAMP on neuronal death is that different subtypes of adenylyl cyclases (ACs) may be involved in the process. ACs convert ATP to cAMP and initiate the cAMP signaling pathway. Two AC isoforms, AC1 and AC8, which are directly stimulated by calcium and calmodulin, act as the downstream effectors of NMDA receptors and couple its activation to the cAMP signaling pathway; previous studies demonstrated that AC1 and AC8 play important roles in synaptic plasticity, memory, and persistent pain (18Xia Z. Storm D.R. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 391-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 22Liauw J. Wu L.J. Zhuo M. J.

More recent studies have shown that calcium-stimulated ACs modulate ethanol-induced neurodegeneration and double knock-out (DKO) of AC1 and -8 in mice enhances ethanol-induced neurodegeneration in the brains of neonatal mice (29Maas Jr., J.W. Indacochea R.A. Muglia L.M. Tran T.T. Vogt S.K. West T. Benz A. Shute A.A. Holtzman D.M. Mennerick S. Olney J.W. Muglia L.J. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 2376-2385Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, the levels of physiological cell death, death after hypoxia/ischemia, and excitotoxic cell death are not increased in the brains of AC1 and -8 DKO mice (29Maas Jr., J.W. Indacochea R.A. Muglia L.M. Tran T.T. Vogt S.K. West T. Benz A. Shute A.A. Holtzman D.M. Mennerick S. Olney J.W. Muglia L.J. J.

Thus, the role of the cAMP signaling pathway, especially the individual function of AC1 and AC8 in neuronal excitotoxicity, needs to be further investigated. In the present study, we report that AC1 is involved in neuronal excitotoxicity mediated by NMDA receptors; genetic deletion of AC1 can protect against glutamate-induced cell death in neuronal cultures and attenuate cortical lesions caused by NMDA injection. The role of AC1 in neuronal excitotoxicity is isoform-specific, because deletion of AC8 has no such effect. AC1 contributes to the time-dependent changes of CREB activity during neuronal excitotoxicity. This novel role of AC1 further indicates that the cAMP signaling pathway is involved in neuronal excitotoxicity caused by glutamate. AC1 plays an important role in regulating neuronal response to excitotoxicity mediated by NMDA receptors and may serve as a novel target for preventing neuronal excitotoxicity in stroke and neurodegenerative diseases. Animals and Primary Culture of Cortical Neurons—Mutant mice lacking AC1 or AC8 and wild-type mice were generated and maintained as previously described (19Wong S.T. Athos J. Figueroa X.A. Pineda V.V.

All procedures were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Toronto, in accordance with the guidelines of the Canadian Council on Animal Care. Cortical neurons were prepared from postnatal day 0 mice. The cerebral cortex of mice were dissected, minced, and trypsinized for 15 min using 0.125% trypsin (Invitrogen). Cells were seeded at the density of 3-4 × 105 cells/cm2 onto either 24-well plates containing glass coverslips (Fisher Scientific), 60-mm dishes, or 96-well plates precoated with 50 μg/ml poly-d-lysine (Sigma) in water, and grown in Neurobasal-A medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with B27 and 2 mm GlutaMax (Invitrogen). The cultures were incubated at 37°C in 95% air/5% carbon dioxide with 95% humidity. Neurons were cultured for 12-14 days before use. Cell Viability Assay—Cell viability was measured by MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl-)2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. Briefly, MTT (Sigma, 5 mg/ml in PBS) was added to culture medium of neurons cultured on 96-well plates at the final concentration of 0.25 mg/ml, and the plate was incubated for 4 h in a humidified atmosphere. After the incubation, the cells were solubilized in 70% isopropanol acidified with 0.1 n HCl. The absorbance of the samples was measured at a wavelength of 595 nm. The extent of MTT conversion in cells exposed to glutamate is expressed as a percentage of control. TUNEL Staining—Cortical neurons were plated onto 12-mm-round glass coverslips precoated with poly-d-lysine. Apoptotic neurons were detected using the DeadEnd™ Colorimetric TUNEL System (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the protocol of manufacturer. Cells were washed with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, and rinsed three times with PBS. Cells were then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS and then treated with 0.3% H2O2 for 30 min to eliminate endogenous peroxidases. The DNA end-labeling reaction was performed by incubation with rTdT reaction mix for 60 min at 37 °C. Cells were then rinsed in PBS and incubated with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase for 30 min at 37 °C. After rinsing, the labeling was visualized using diaminobenzidine. The apoptotic neurons were quantified by counting TUNEL-positive cell bodies, and results are expressed as percentages of TUNEL-positive cells. Caspase-3 Activity Assay—The activity of caspase-3 was measured using the Caspase Apoptosis Detection Kit (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, cells (1 × 106) were pelleted by centrifugation, washed two times with PBS, and incubated in 500 μl of lysis buffer on ice for 10 min, and then 1× reaction buffer and 10 μl of DEVD-7-amino-4-trifluoromethyl coumarin substrates were added to lysis buffer. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. The fluorescence of free 7-amino-4-trifluoromethyl coumarin, generated as a result of cleavage of the DEVD-7-amino-4-trifluoromethyl coumarin bond, was monitored continuously with fluorescence microplate reader at excitation and emission wavelengths of 400 and 505 nm, respectively. Western Blot Analysis—The cultured cortical neurons were harvested and homogenized in lysis buffer (10 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm Na3VaO3, 20 mm NaF, 0.1% SDS) containing proteinase inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Brain samples were homogenized in the same lysis buffer containing 0.5% SDS and proteinase inhibitor mixture. Protein was quantified by Bradford assay, and electrophoresis of equal amounts of total protein was performed on SDS-PAGE gels. Separated proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes at 4 °C for Western blot analysis. Membranes were incubated with the primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. The primary antibodies used are the rabbit polyclonal anti-NR1, anti-NR2A, anti-NR2B (1:2000, Chemicon, Temecula, CA), anti-phospho-CREB (Ser-133), or anti-CREB (1:1000, Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA). The membranes were incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody diluted at 1:3000 for 1 h followed by enhanced chemiluminescence detection of the proteins with Western lightning chemiluminescence reagent plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To verify equal loading, membranes were also probed with anti-actin antibody (Sigma). The density of immunoblots was measured using National Institutes of Health ImageJ software. Electrophysiology—Cultured cortical neurons were bath-perfused with Mg2+-free extracellular solution containing 140 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 25 mm HEPES, 20 mm glucose, 1.3 mm CaCl2, 0.0003 mm tetrodotoxin, and 0.01 mm glycine (pH 7.4 with NaOH, 320-335 mmol/kg) on the stage of an Olympus CKX41 inverted microscope. The recording pipettes (3-5 MΩ) were filled with solution containing 145 mm potassium gluconate, 5 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, 2 mm Mg-ATP, and 0.1 mm Na3-GTP (pH 7.2 with KOH, 290-300 mmol/kg). The cell membrane potential was held at -70 mV, and NMDA (10 μm) was applied for 3 s every 45 s to minimize the current amplitude decrease due to receptor desensitization. Pharmacological agents were applied with Mg2+-free extracellular solution by a constant local gravity-fed perfusion from a quartz glass pipette (inner diameter, 300 μm) connected to a manifold with <1 μl dead space (ALA Scientific Instruments, Inc., Westbury, NY). NR2B subunit antagonist Ro25-6981 was purchased from Tocris Cookson Inc. (Ellisville, MO). Recorded currents were filtered at 5 kHz, digitized at 10 kHz, and stored in a personal computer for display and analysis with an Axopatch 200B amplifier, DigiData 1200 series interface, and the pClamp 8 software suite (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). cAMP Assay—Cortical neurons were plated in 96-well tissue culture dishes. After treatment with glutamate, cells were harvested and lysed in 0.1 m HCl. Direct cAMP measurements were performed using the direct cAMP enzyme immunoassay kit (Assay Designs, Ann Arbor, MI) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Phosphodiesterase was inhibited by the addition of 1 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (Sigma) to cultures for 30 min. CRE Luciferase Assay—Transcriptional activities of CREB were determined by CRE luciferase assay. Cultured cortical neurons were co-transfected with the pGL3-CRE-firefly luciferase and pGL3-CMV-Renilla luciferase constructs using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) 48 h before the experiments. Luciferase activity was assayed in the cell lysate by using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Luciferase activities of the CREluciferase vector were normalized based on Renilla luciferase activity of the co-transfected vector. NMDA Microinjection into Cerebral Cortex—Male mice (22-28 g) were used. The mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and placed in a stereotaxic apparatus fitted with a mouse adaptor that positioned the skull horizontally between bregma and lambda. The dura overlying the cortex was exposed. NMDA (30 nmol in 300 nl of sterile 0.1 m PBS, pH 7.4) was injected into the cerebral cortex of mice at the right side at the following coordinates: 2 mm posterior to bregma, 3 mm lateral from the midline, and at the depth of 0.8 mm from the skull surface. The injection was performed at the rate of 50 nl/min using a 30-gauge beveled needle with cannula tubing connected to a Hamilton syringe, which was mounted on a microinjection pump. The needle was left in place for 15 min before being slowly withdrawn. Mice were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane and perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m PBS 24 h after injection. Coronal sections were serially cut into a cryostat and stained with thionin for determination of lesion volumes. For caspase-3 assay, mice were killed after being anesthetized with isoflurane inhalation. The cerebral cortex of the injected side were collected and homogenized in the cell lysis buffer. Data Analysis—Results are presented as mean ± S.E. Statistical comparisons between experimental groups were performed with Student t test or one-way analysis of variance. In all cases, p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Genetic Deletion of AC1 Protects against Neuronal Death Induced by Glutamate—First, the effect of genetic deletion of AC1 or AC8 on glutamate-induced cell death was evaluated by measuring cell viability in cultured cortical neurons after treatment with glutamate. By MTT assay, we first checked the cell viability in cultured cortical neurons from wild-type mice at different time points during the 24 h after treatment with 100 μm or 250 μm glutamate. As shown in Fig. 1A, we found that the cell viability was reduced in a time-dependent manner and most of the cell death occurred during the first 8 h after treatment with glutamate. Then, we further compared the cell viability in cultured cortical neurons from wild-type and gene knock-out mice at the time point of 8 h after treatment with 100 μm or 250 μm glutamate. It was found that the reduction of cell viability was significantly attenuated in cortical neurons from AC1 KO (p < 0.01, n = 9 wells from three experiments, Fig. 1B). However, there was no difference in cell viability between AC8 KO and wild-type mice (p > 0.05, compared with wild-type, n = 9 wells from three experiments, Fig. 1B). These data indicate that genetic deletion of AC1 can attenuate neuronal excitotoxicity induced by glutamate in primary culture of cortical neurons. Previous studies have documented that apoptosis is implicated in excitotoxic neuronal death as an apoptosis-necrosis continuum (32Leist M. Nicotera P. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 239: 183-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). We then characterized apoptotic cell death following excitotoxicity in neuronal culture. The neuronal apoptosis was assessed by TUNEL staining, a low level of apoptosis (∼5%) could be found in cultured cortical neurons of either wild-type, AC1 or AC8 KO mice at the baseline level. At the time point of 8 h after treatment with 100 μm or 250 μm glutamate, the cell apoptosis was increased in cultured cortical neurons and the increase of TUNEL-positive cells in cortical neurons from AC1 KO mice was prevented compared with wild-type mice (p < 0.05, n = 6 experiments, Fig. 1, C and D). In contrast, there is no significant difference between AC8 KO and wild-type mice (p > 0.05, compared with wild-type, n = 6 experiments, Fig. 1, C and D). These results indicate that genetic deletion of AC1 can protect cultured cortical neurons from apoptosis induced by glutamate and suggest that AC1 may play an important role in glutamate-induced neuronal apoptosis during neuronal excitotoxicity. Activation of caspase-3 is a hallmark of apoptotic cell death and precedes changes in nuclear morphology (33Du Y. Bales K.R. Dodel R.C. Hamilton-Byrd E. Horn J.W. Czilli D.L. Simmons L.K. Ni B. Paul S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11657-11662Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 34Bachis A. Colangelo A.M. Vicini S. Doe P.P. De Bernardi M.A. Brooker G. Mocchetti I. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 3104-3112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To further confirm that glutamate could induce apoptotic neuronal death in our model system, we measured caspase-3 activity at various time points in extracts from cortical neuron cultures during the 8 h after treatment with 250 μm glutamate. Excitotoxic stimulation with glutamate increased caspase-3 activity in a time-dependent manner, and the increase of caspase-3 activity was blocked in cultured cortical neurons from AC1 KO mice compared with wild-type mice (p < 0.01, n = 6 experiments, Fig. 1E). However, no difference was observed between the cultured cortical neurons from AC8 KO and wild-type mice (p > 0.05, n = 6 experiments, Fig. 1E). These results indicate genetic deletion of AC1 can protect cultured cortical neurons from glutamate-induced apoptosis by reducing caspase-3 activity. Neuronal Excitotoxicity Induced by NMDA—Neuronal excitotoxicity induced by glutamate is primarily mediated by NMDA receptors. Antagonists of NMDA receptors can block the cell death induced by glutamate in cultured cortical neurons (2Sattler R. Tymianski M. Mol.

We found that pretreatment with the NMDA receptor antagonist d l-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (AP-5, 100 μm) almost completely blocked the excitotoxicity induced by 250 μm glutamate in cultured cortical neurons from both wildtype and KO mice (p < 0.01 or p < 0.05, compared with treatment with glutamate alone, n = 9 wells, Fig. 2A). These results further confirm that neuronal excitotoxicity induced by glutamate is primarily mediated by NMDA receptors. We further characterized the cell death in cultured cortical neurons from wild-type and knock-out mice. As shown in Fig. 2B, at the time point of 8 h after treatment, NMDA reduced the cell viability in a dose-dependent manner. The reduction of cell viability was prevented in cultured cortical neurons from AC1 KO mice compared with wild-type mice (p < 0.01, n = 9 wells, Fig. 2B). However, there was no difference in cell viability between AC8 KO and wild-type mice (p > 0.05, compared with wild-type, n = 9 wells, Fig. 2B). These findings further confirm that genetic deletion of AC1 can prevent neuronal excitotoxicity mediated by NMDA receptors. NMDA Receptors in Cultured Cortical Neurons of AC1 or AC8 KO Mice—NMDA receptors are heteromers composed of two NR1 subunits and two or three NR2 subunits. Among the four NR2 subunits (A-D), NR2A and NR2B subunits predominate in the forebrain (39Massey P.V. Johnson B.E. Moult P.R. Auberson Y.P. Brown M.W. Molnar E. Collingridge G.L. Bashir Z.I. J.

We further investigated the expression profile of NMDA receptor subunits in cultured cortical neurons by Western blot and found that there are no significant difference in the expression level of NR1, NR2A, and NR2B subunits between wild-type, AC1, and AC8 KO mice (Fig. 3, A and B). These data indicate that genetic deletion of AC1 or AC8 has not altered the expression of NMDA receptor subunits in cultured cortical neurons. Next, we used whole cell patch recordings to test whether NR2A or NR2B subunit-mediated currents were affected by genetic deletion of AC1 or AC8 in cultured cortical neurons. The contribution of NR2A or NR2B subunits containing NMDA receptor-mediated currents to the total amount of NMDA receptor-mediated currents was determined by application of the selective inhibitor of NR2A subunit, NVP-AAM077 (41Zhao M.G.

In cortical neurons from wild-type mice, NMDA (10 μm)-induced current was largely blocked by NVP-AAM077 (0.4 μm) (84.7 ± 3.1% of control, n = 5 neurons, Fig. 3, C and D), whereas it was only slightly inhibited by Ro25-6981 (0.5 μm) (16.7 ± 4.0%, n = 4 neurons, Fig. 3, C and D).

https://openalex.org/W1966235145,"Anandamide, originally described as an endocannabinoid, is the main representative molecule of a new class of signaling lipids including endocannabinoids and N-acyl-related molecules, eicosanoids, and fatty acids. Bioactive lipids regulate neuronal excitability by acting on G-protein-coupled receptors (such as CB1) but also directly modulate various ionic conductances including voltage-activated T-type calcium channels (T-channels). However, little is known about the properties and the specificity of this new class of molecules on their various targets. In this study, we have investigated the chemical determinants involved in anandamide-induced inhibition of the three cloned T-channels: CaV3.1, CaV3.2, and CaV3.3. We show that both the hydroxyl group and the alkyl chain of anandamide are key determinants of its effects on T-currents. As follows, T-currents are also inhibited by fatty acids. Inhibition of the three CaV3 currents by anandamide and arachidonic acid does not involve enzymatic metabolism and occurs in cell-free inside-out patches. Inhibition of T-currents by fatty acids and N-acyl ethanolamides depends on the degree of unsaturation but not on the alkyl chain length and consequently is not restricted to eicosanoids. Inhibition increases for polyunsaturated fatty acids comprising 18–22 carbons when cis-double bonds are close to the carboxyl group. Therefore the major natural (food-supplied) and mammalian endogenous fatty acids including γ-linolenic acid, mead acid, and arachidonic acid as well as the fully polyunsaturated ω3-fatty acids that are enriched in fish oil eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids are potent inhibitors of T-currents, which possibly contribute to their physiological functions.

Voltage-dependent calcium channels comprise three families: the L-type channels (CaV1 family), the neuronal N-, P/Q-, and R-type channels (CaV2 family), and the T-type channels (CaV3 family). The electrophysiological features of T-type Ca2+ channels (T-channels) are low voltage-activated Ca2+ currents, low unitary conductance, fast inactivation and slow deactivation kinetics, and strong steady-state inactivation at physiological resting potentials (1Huguenard J.R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 329-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar, 2Perez-Reyes E. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 117-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). Three T-channel subunits have been identified: CaV3.1 (or α1G), CaV3.2 (or α1H), and CaV3.3 (or α1I) (2Perez-Reyes E. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 117-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). In mammalian expression systems, the CaV3.1 and CaV3.2 currents share typical properties of native T-channels, while CaV3.3 currents display unusually slow inactivation kinetics, which are characteristic of specific neurons (1Huguenard J.R.

We recently identified that anandamide, an endogenous signaling molecule that modulates neuronal excitability (22Freund T.F. Katona I. Piomelli D. Physiol.

Despite the fact that both small lipid messengers and T-channels display similar physiological functions (but with opposite effects), little is known about the properties and the specificity of this new class of molecules on the three CaV3 channels. In the present study, we provide the first detailed analysis of the chemical determinants involved in anandamide-induced inhibition of CaV3 T-channels. Cell Culture and Transfection Protocols—TsA-201 cells were cultivated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with glutamax and 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Transfection was performed using jet-PEI (QBiogen) according to the manufacturer protocol (4 μl of jet-PEI for ∼1.5 μg of DNA) with a DNA mix containing 0.5% of a green fluorescent protein plasmid and 99.5% of either of the pcDNA3 plasmid constructs that code for human CaV3.1a, CaV3.2, and CaV3.3 T-channel isoforms. Two days after, cells were then dissociated with trypsin, and electrophysiological recordings were performed during the next 2 days. Electrophysiological Recordings—Macroscopic currents were recorded at room temperature (∼24 °C) by the whole-cell patch clamp technique using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments). Extracellular solution contained (in mm): 135 NaCl, 20 tetraethylammonium chloride, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, and 10 HEPES (pH adjusted to 7.4 with KOH, ∼330 mosm). Borosilicate glass pipettes have a typical resistance of 1.5–2.5 MΩ when filled with an internal solution containing (in mm): 140 CsCl, 10 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 3 Mg-ATP, 0.6 GTPNa, and 2 CaCl2 (pH adjusted to 7.2 with KOH, ∼315 mosm). For cell-free inside-out experiments the bath solution contained (in mm): 145 KCl, 5 EGTA, 1 MgCl2, and 10 HEPES (pH adjusted to 7.4 with KOH, ∼310 mosm) and the intra-pipette solution contained (in mm): 100 BaCl2 and 10 HEPES (pH adjusted to 7.4 with KOH, ∼310 mosm). Recordings were filtered at 2 kHz. Data were analyzed as described previously (24Chemin J. Monteil A. Perez-Reyes E. Nargeot J. Lory P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7033-7040Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) using pCLAMP9 (Axon Instruments) and GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Inc.) software. One-way analysis of variance combined with a Student-Newman-Keuls post-test were used to compare the different values and were considered significant at p < 0.05. Results are presented as the mean ± S.E., and n is the number of cells used. Chemical Reagents—Fatty acids, N-acyl ethanolamides, as well as others compounds (from Sigma and Cayman Chemical) were dissolved in ethanol at a concentration of 10–100 mm. Stock solutions were briefly sonicated, aliquoted, sealed under argon, and kept at –80 °C. These aliquots were dissolved daily in the extracellular solution, which was sonicated on ice for 5 min before use. Control experiments were carried out using the solvent alone. Drugs were applied by a gravity-driven homemade perfusion device (mostly using Teflon tubing), controlled by solenoid valves. Anandamide (AEA) inhibits the three cloned T-channels expressed in tsA-201 cells, as illustrated for CaV3.3 (Fig. 1A). The inhibition is potent (∼90% for a concentration of 10 μm, Fig. 1B), occurs in the minute range (maximal after a 2–3-min perfusion), and is partially relieved by perfusion of a bovine serum albumin solution (3 mg/ml) (data not shown). We first looked for the principal chemical motifs involved in anandamide inhibition. As schematized in Fig. 1A, we identified that both the hydroxyl group of the anandamide head (indicated in blue in Fig. 1A) as well as its alkyl chain (indicated in green in Fig. 1A) are crucial for anandamide effects. Indeed, arachidonic acid (cis-5,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid, AA), which contains a carboxyl group and the same alkyl chain as anandamide, mimics anandamide effects. As observed with anandamide, the inhibition of the three cloned T-channels by arachidonic acid occurs in the minute range (maximal after a 2–3-min perfusion) and is partially relieved by perfusion of a bovine serum albumin solution (data not shown). As previously described for lower anandamide concentrations (24Chemin J. Monteil A. Perez-Reyes E. Nargeot J. Lory P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7033-7040Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), arachidonic acid (10 μm) preferentially inhibits CaV3.2 currents (∼66%) compared with CaV3.3 (∼53%) and CaV3.1 (∼47%) currents (Fig. 1B, p < 0.05). However, the arachidonic acid inhibition is less potent than those induced by anandamide on the three CaV3 currents (Fig. 1B, p < 0.001) indicating that although the ethanolamide group of anandamide does not affect per se T-currents (as assessed with ethanolamine (EA) and acetyl ethanolamide (acetyl-EA) (Fig. 1A)), its presence potently increases the T-current inhibition. Furthermore, arachidonic acid methyl ester (AA-methyl ester), which lacks both the hydroxyl and the amide group of anandamide, has no significant effect on the three CaV3 currents (Fig. 1, A and B). It should be noted that the hydroxyl group of AEA seems very important to confer strong T-current inhibition since arachidonyl 2′-chloroethylamide (ACEA), which contained a chloride instead a hydroxyl group, poorly inhibits the three CaV3 currents (Fig. 1, A and B). Indeed, anandamide derivatives possessing the amide linkage (indicated in red in Fig. 1A) but lacking the hydroxyl group (as arachidonamide, arachidonic acid N-methylamide (ANMA), and ACEA) inhibit the three T-currents (∼30%) but weakly compared with arachidonic acid (∼55%) and anandamide derivatives (∼95%) that possess both the hydroxyl and the amide groups (as AEA and R1- and R2-methanandamide) (Fig. 1B, p < 0.001). It is important to note that ANMA and ACEA are potent cannabinoid receptor CB1 agonists. In addition, the carbonyl group of AEA seems less crucial since arachidonyl alcohol is as potent as AA to inhibit the three CaV3 currents (Fig. 1, A and B). It should be noted that both R1- and R2-methanandamide produce maximal inhibition of the three CaV3 currents (Fig. 1, A and B). We next investigated whether the presence of double bonds on the alkyl chain is implicated in T-current inhibition. The fully saturated arachidic acid (20:0, see schematic representation in Fig. 2A) has no significant effect on T-currents (Fig. 2A). By contrast, the inhibition appears with cis-11,14-eicosadienoic acid (20:2), which inhibits ∼36% of CaV3.2 currents, ∼21% of CaV3.3 currents, and ∼17% of CaV3.1 currents (Fig. 2B). Remarkably, inhibition of the three CaV3 currents increases with the degree of unsaturation (p < 0.001, r2 > 0.97) and is maximal for the fully unsaturated eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5, EPA), which inhibits ∼79% of CaV3.2 currents, ∼64% of CaV3.3 currents, and ∼52% of CaV3.1 currents (Fig. 2B). As previously observed for arachidonic acid, polyunsaturated eicosanoids preferentially inhibit CaV3.2 currents compared with CaV3.3 and CaV3.1 currents (Fig. 2B, p < 0.05 for cis-11,14-eicosadienoic acid (20:2), dihomo-γ-linolenic acid (cis-8,11,14-eicosatrienoic acid, 20:3), and EPA (20:5)). It should also be noted that CaV3.2 currents (but not CaV3.3 and CaV3.1 currents) are also inhibited by gondoic acid (20:1, cis-11-eicosenoic acid), although very modestly (∼15% inhibition, p < 0.05, Fig. 2B). We next explored the effects of the most abundant natural fatty acids (which mainly include 16–22 carbons) and analyzed the results with respect to both the chain length and the degree of unsaturation (Fig. 3). It should be noted that most natural fatty acids with less than 18 carbons are saturated or monounsaturated whereas fatty acids with at least 18 carbons can be polyunsaturated. As observed with eicosanoids (20 carbons), no inhibition of the three CaV3 currents is found with saturated fatty acids including palmitic acid (16:0, n = 5–9), stearic acid (18:0, n = 5), and behenic acid (22:0, n = 14–15). Similar results were obtained with short chain fatty acids including lauric acid (12:0, n = 4–5) and myristic acid (14:0, n = 3–4) (data not shown). As described above, CaV3.2 currents (but not CaV3.3 and CaV3.1 currents) are very slightly inhibited (∼18%) by 18 carbon and 22 carbon mono-unsaturated fatty acids including oleic acid (18:1, cis-9-octadecenoic acid, n = 7, p < 0.05) and erucic acid (22:1, cis-13-docosenoic acid, n = 6, p < 0.05) (Fig. 3B). It should also be noted that palmitoleic acid (16:1, cis-9-hexadecenoic acid) partially inhibits the three CaV3 currents (∼16–21% inhibition, p < 0.05, n = 9–10, Fig. 3A) but not the short chain monounsaturated fatty acids including lauroleic acid (12:1, cis-5-dodecenoic acid, p > 0.05, n = 5–10) and myristoleic acid (14:1, cis-9-tetradecenoic acid, p > 0.05, n = 6–10) (data not shown). By contrast, polyunsaturated fatty acids significantly inhibit the three CaV3 currents (Fig. 3, A and B) as assessed with linoleic acid (18:2, cis-9,12-octadecadienoic acid), which inhibits ∼28% to ∼40% of the current (CaV3.1 currents, n = 11, and CaV3.2 currents, n = 6, respectively) as well as with cis-13,16-docosadienoic acid (22:2), which inhibits ∼24% to ∼38% of the current (CaV3.1 currents, n = 11, and CaV3.2 currents, n = 16, respectively). Expectedly, the inhibition of CaV3 currents by 18 and 22 carbon polyunsaturated fatty acids increases with the number of cis-double bonds (p < 0.001, r2 > 0.96, Fig. 3B). Indeed, the fully unsaturated 18-carbon fatty acid, stearidonic acid (18:4, cis-6,9,12,15-octadecatetraenoic acid), strongly inhibits the three CaV3 currents (percent of inhibition: 70 ± 4%, n = 10, for CaV3.2 currents; 68 ± 3%, n = 23, for CaV3.3 currents; and 57 ± 3%, n = 14, for CaV3.1 currents) as well as DHA (22:6, cis-4,7,10,13,16,19-docosahexaenoic acid), the fully unsaturated 22-carbon fatty acid (percent of inhibition: 75 ± 3%, n = 17, for CaV3.2 currents; 65 ± 2%, n = 18, for CaV3.3 currents; and 59 ± 5%, n = 16, for CaV3.1 currents). Similar results were obtained with a nonnatural polyunsaturated fatty acids containing an odd number of carbons (19:4, cis-6,9,12,15-nonadecatetraenoic acid, n = 3 on each CaV3 currents, data not shown). As observed with eicosanoids, 18 and 22 carbon polyunsaturated fatty acids preferentially inhibit CaV3.2 currents compared with CaV3.3 and CaV3.1 currents (p < 0.05 for all fatty acids, n = 6–23). Notably, inhibition of the CaV3 currents does not depend on the chain length (Fig. 3B, inset, p > 0.05) but depends on the number of double bonds (Fig. 3B). Similar results were obtained with N-acyl ethanolamides (Fig. 4). Indeed, N-acyl ethanolamides with saturated alkyl chain have no significant effect on the three CaV3 currents, as assessed with palmitoyl ethanolamide (16:0 EA, PEA), stearoyl ethanolamide (18:0 EA, SEA), arachidoyl ethanolamide (20:0 EA), and docosanoyl ethanolamide (22:0 EA) (Fig. 4, B–D). As observed with fatty acids, inhibition of T-currents by N-acyl ethanolamides increases with the degree of unsaturation. This is illustrated by linoleoyl ethanolamide (18:2 EA) that produces a mild inhibition of the three CaV3 currents (∼50–60% inhibition), whereas docosahexaenoyl ethanolamide (22:6 EA, DHEA) produces a maximal inhibition (∼95%) similar to that obtained with AEA (Fig. 4, B–D). We further investigated whether the position of the double bonds in the alkyl chain is implicated in T-current inhibition (Fig. 5). For the three CaV3 currents, we observed that inhibition increases when double bonds are proximal to the carboxyl group of polyunsaturated fatty acids (see Fig. 5A). Indeed, ω3 eicosatrienoic acid (20:3 cis-11,14,17) modestly inhibits T-currents (percent of inhibition: 29 ± 4%, n = 7, for CaV3.2 currents; 20 ± 3%, n = 10, for CaV3.3 currents; and 12 ± 1%, n = 10, for CaV3.1 currents), while inhibition is increased for ω6 eicosatrienoic acid (20:3 cis-8,11,14-dihomo-γ-linolenic acid) (percent of inhibition: 50 ± 4%, n = 10, for CaV3.2 currents; 39 ± 2%, n = 11, for CaV3.3 currents; and 29 ± 2%, n = 11, for CaV3.1 currents; 20:3 ω3 versus 20:3 ω6: p < 0.001 for each CaV3 currents) and is maximal with ω9 eicosatrienoic acid (20:3 cis-5,8,11-mead acid) (percent of inhibition: 70 ± 3%, n = 9, for CaV3.2 currents; 60 ± 2%, n = 10, for CaV3.3 currents; and 46 ± 2%, n = 13, for CaV3.1 currents; 20:3 ω6 versus 20:3 ω9: p < 0.001 for each CaV3 currents). Similar results were obtained for α-linolenic and γ-linolenic acid (18:3 ω3 cis-9,12,15- and 18:3 ω6 cis-6,9,12-octadecatrienoic acid, respectively) for the three CaV3 currents (18:3 ω3 versus 18:3 ω6: p < 0.01, Fig. 5, A and B). Also, alteration of cis-double bonds in trans-configuration or in cis-triple bonds, decreases the polyunsaturated fatty acid effects (p < 0.001), as assessed with linolenelaidic acid (18:3, trans-9,12,15-octadecatrienoic acid) and ETYA (20:4, cis-5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid). It is important to note that 3 cis-double bonds closer to the carboxyl group is sufficient to produce maximal inhibition since 18:3 ω6 and 20:3 ω9 fatty acids are equally potent that the fully polyunsaturated 18:4, 20:5, and 22:6 ω3 fatty acids (see Fig. 3) on the three CaV3 currents (∼73% inhibition of CaV3.2 currents, p > 0.05 for all these fatty acids; ∼61% inhibition of CaV3.3 currents, p > 0.05; and ∼52% inhibition of CaV3.1 currents, p > 0.05). Similar to that described for anandamide (24Chemin J. Monteil A. Perez-Reyes E. Nargeot J. Lory P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7033-7040Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), arachidonic acid has pronounced effect on T-channel inactivation (Fig. 6). Indeed, arachidonic acid accelerates inactivation kinetics of T-currents as illustrated for CaV3.3 (Fig. 6A). Inactivation kinetics (τ) are ∼2 times faster in the presence of arachidonic acid for the three CaV3 currents (p < 0.01; n = 8–14). In addition, arachidonic acid induces a hyperpolarizing shift of the steady-state inactivation curve of T-currents (∼12 mV, p < 0.01 for the three CaV3 currents; n = 8–12; Fig. 6B) without a corresponding effect on the activation curve (Fig. 6, C–F). Therefore, in the presence of arachidonic acid, no current is recorded for a resting potential of –70 mV, whereas ∼50% of the current remained in control condition (Fig. 6B). Also, the window current, resulting from the overlap of the activation and inactivation curve, is almost completely abolished in the presence of arachidonic acid (Fig. 6, D–F). Because the fatty acids and the N-acyl ethanolamides that potently inhibit T-currents contained at least a cis-1,4-pentadiene unit (-C=C-C-C=C-) and therefore are potentially metabolized in mammalian cells by lipoxygenase, cyclooxygenase, and cytochrome P450 epoxygenase and ω-hydrolase pathways (see schematic signaling cascade in Fig. 7A), we investigated whether these latter enzymes could be implicated in AA and AEA-induce T-current inhibition (Fig. 7A). Specific inhibition of cyclooxygenase with indomethacin (10 μm) as well as of lipoxygenase with 5,8,11-eicosatriynoic acid (10 μm) does not altered T-current inhibition by AA and AEA (Fig. 7A). Similar findings were obtained using 17-octadecynoic acid, which inhibits P450 epoxygenase and ω-hydrolase enzymes (Fig. 7A). Furthermore, ETYA (10 μm), which acts as a nonspecific blocker of all AA-metabolizing enzymes, does not suppress T-current inhibition by either AA or AEA (Fig. 7A). Finally, AEA hydrolysis into AA by fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) is not involved in T-current inhibition induced by AEA, as assessed with phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (100 μm, Fig. 7A). Because inhibition of T-currents could involve another mechanisms (as G-protein receptor and protein kinase activation), we performed cell-free inside-out patches in the presence of AA and AEA (Fig. 7B) using an “intracellular” medium lacking both GTP and ATP. In this configuration, AA potently inhibits the three CaV3 currents (∼50% inhibition of CaV3.1 and CaV3.3 currents and ∼70% inhibition of CaV3.2 currents). Similar results are obtained with AEA, which inhibits ∼85% of the three CaV3 currents (Fi"

The Yops down-regulate host cell functions through unique biochemical activities. YopO, a serine/threonine kinase required for Yersinia virulence, is activated by host cell actin via an unknown process. Here we show that YopO kinase is activated by formation of a 1:1 complex with monomeric (G) actin but is unresponsive to filamentous (F) actin. Two separate G-actin binding sites, one in the N-terminal kinase region (amino acids 89–440) and one in the C-terminal guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor-like region (amino acids 441–729) of YopO, were identified. Actin binding to both of these sites was necessary for effective autophosphorylation of YopO on amino acids Ser-90 and Ser-95. A S90A/S95A YopO mutant was strongly reduced in substrate phosphorylation, suggesting that autophosphorylation activates YopO kinase activity. In cells the kinase activity of YopO regulated rounding/arborization and was specifically required for inhibition of Yersinia YadA-dependent phagocytosis. Thus, YopO kinase is activated by a novel G-actin binding process, and this appears to be crucial for its anti-host cell functions.

Borisy G.G. Cell. 2003; 112: 453-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3296) Google Scholar). Vesicle transport and intracellular movement of pathogenic bacteria are also dependent on actin polymerization (2Merrifield C.J.

Microbiol. 2005; 8: 35-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The turnover of actin filaments and their organization into complex structures is controlled by a plethora of actin-binding proteins, which often are regulated by specific signal transduction pathways (4Winder S.J. Ayscough K.R. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 651-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Besides governing motile cellular processes, actin has been recognized as an important cofactor for regulators of gene transcription and cell proliferation (5Visa N. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 218-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The myocardin-related serum response factor (SRF) coactivator (MAL) accumulates in the nucleus dependent upon G-actin binding and activates transcription of SRF. It has been speculated that G-actin binding activates MAL for nuclear translocation (6Miralles F. Posern G. Zaromytidou A.I. Treisman R. Cell. 2003; 113: 329-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar). A recent report suggested that actin associates with RNA polymerase I in the nucleus and in cooperation with nuclear myosin I supports transcription (7Philimonenko V.V. Zhao J. Iben S. Dingova H. Kysela K. Kahle M. Zentgraf H. Hofmann W.A. de Lanerolle P. Hozak P. Grummt I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 1165-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Furthermore, c-Abl tyrosine kinase, which is involved in cell responses to DNA damage and apoptosis signaling, becomes inhibited upon interaction with F-actin (8Woodring P.J. Hunter T. Wang J.Y. . 2001; 276: 27104-27110Google Scholar). Hence, a number of crucial cellular regulators are controlled by G- or F-actin, but the biochemical basis for this has not been determined. Pathogenic Yersinia species encompassing Yersinia enterocolitica, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, and Yersinia pestis employ a type III secretion system to translocate six effector proteins (Yersinia outer proteins, Yops) into target cells (9Cornelis G.R.

Interestingly, at least four of these Yop effectors, namely YopE, -T, -H, and -O, impinge on the actin cytoskeleton (10Cornelis G.R. Wolf-Watz H. Mol.

YopO from Y. enterocolitica (YpkA in Y. pseudotuberculosis) is a serine/threonine kinase that disrupts F-actin structures in host cells, causes cell rounding, and contributes to antiphagocytosis of yersiniae (16Galyov E.E. Hakansson S. Forsberg A. Watz Wolf. H. Nature. 1993; 361: 730-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 17Hakansson S. Galyov E.E. Rosqvist R. Watz Wolf. H. Mol.

Immun. 2002; 70: 4165-4176Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). YopO associates with the Rho GTP-binding proteins RhoA and Rac via a region showing homology to guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDIs) and was found to block activation of RhoA in Yersinia-infected cells (19Dukuzumuremyi J.M.

Cell. 2006; 126: 869-880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the kinase activity of YopO is activated by actin (22Juris S.J. Rudolph A.E. Huddler D. Orth K. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 17: 9431-9436Crossref Scopus (152) Google Scholar). It has remained unclear whether kinase activity contributes to F-actin disruption and antiphagocytic activity of YopO or whether these effects are solely due to inactivation of Rho GTPases. Clearly the kinase activity of YopO is relevant in vivo given that yersiniae expressing kinase-deficient YopO mutants are reduced in mouse virulence by at least 2 orders of magnitude (16Galyov E.E. Hakansson S. Forsberg A. Watz Wolf. H. Nature. 1993; 361: 730-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 23Wiley D.J. Nordfeldth R. Rosenzweig J. DaFonseca C.J. Gustin R. Wolf-Watz H. Schesser K. Microb. Pathog. 2006; 40: 234-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We report here that YopO binds to G-actin via two separate binding sites, which leads to its autophosphorylation. Autophosphorylation up-regulates YopO capability to phosphorylate external substrates. Cellular analysis indicated that YopO kinase specifically controls cell rounding and inhibits a Yersinia-specific internalization mechanism. We propose that these YopO effects are connected to the G-actin-triggered activation process described herein. Materials and Cell Culture—Chemical reagents were from Sigma-Aldrich, Roche Diagnostics, or Merck if not otherwise indicated. Oligonucleotides were from Metabion (Martinsried, Germany) or MWG (Ebersberg, Germany). The pGEX-6P-2 plasmids encoding GST-YopOwt and GST-YopOK269A were a generous gift of J. Dixon and S. Juris (University of Michigan). Human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells were grown in ECGM from PromoCell (Heidelberg, Germany), 10% fetal bovine serum in plastic culture flasks at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. Human monocytes were isolated and cultivated as described (30Wiedemann A. Linder S. Grassl G. Albert M. Autenrieth I. Aepfelbacher M. Cell. Microbiol. 2001; 10: 693-702Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Purification of Actin—Skeletal muscle actin was prepared according to Spudich and Watt (24Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and further purified on a S200 gel filtration column, and the concentration of actin was measured as described by Wegner (25Wegner A. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 108: 139-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). For the preparation of actin from Dictyostelium discoideum, the soluble extract was chromatographed on a DE52 column (5 × 30 cm) using a linear salt gradient of 0–350 mm NaCl (2 × 750 ml) essentially as described (26Eichinger L. Noegel A.A. Schleicher M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 665-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Human platelet G-actin was purchased from tebu-bio (Offenbach, Germany). Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Actin was labeled with N-(1-pyrenyl)iodoacetamide (pyrene) according to Kouyama and Mihashi (27Kouyama T. Mihashi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 114: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). Aliquots of pyrene-labeled actin were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –70 °C. Before use, the pyrene-labeled G-actin was thawed quickly and dialyzed in buffer containing 2 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.2 mm CaCl2 overnight. For the measurement of actin polymerization a mixture of pyrene-labeled and unlabeled G-actin in a molar ratio of 1:10 was used at a final concentration of 2.2 μm with or without YopO constructs. The measurements were performed at room temperature in a luminescence spectrometer (Aminco Bowman). For kinetic measurements the excitation wavelength was 365 nm, and the emission wavelength was 386 nm. Construction of Plasmids and Expression of Proteins—Plasmid DNA preparations and isolation of DNA fragments from agarose gels were performed with Qiagen kits (Hilden, Germany). Restriction endonuclease digestions and PCR were performed according to standard protocols. The 5′ and 3′ deletions of yopO were constructed by PCR with the respective primers denoted in supplemental Table 1 using Y. enterocolitica O:8 yopO as template (28Heesemann J. Laufs R. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 155: 761-767Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Identity to the published YopO sequence on pYV8081 (accession number NP_863565) was verified. PCR products were subcloned using EcoRI and XhoI restriction sites and in-frame fusion with GST into pGEX-4T-1 or -2. The vector for expression of GST-YopO-(700–729) was constructed by inserting an oligonucleotide corresponding to amino acids 700–729 of yopO into pGEX-4T-2. For construction of vectors expressing GFP-YopO fusion proteins, the corresponding yopO fragments were introduced into the mammalian expression vector pEGFP-C1 (BD Clontech Laboratories). YopO amino acid substitutions were introduced using QuikChange®II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) following the manufacturer's instructions, giving rise to the YopOD267A/K269A mutant and the point mutants S95A, S102A, T89A/S95A, S90A/S95A, T89A/S102A, S90A/S102A, D267A/K269A/S90A/S95A. Plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli BL-21 using a heat shock procedure. For protein expression, overnight bacterial cultures were diluted 1:20 in Luria Bertani medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and grown at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.6–0.8. Bacterial suspensions were shifted to 18 °C, and protein expression was induced for 3–4 h with 0.4 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After French press, GST proteins were purified from bacterial lysates on glutathione-Sepharose beads 4B (Amersham Biosciences) in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol. Triton X-100 (0.1%) was added for purification of GST-YopOwt and GST-YopOK269A. GST-fused proteins on beads were either eluted with reduced glutathione (30 mm, pH 8.0, in lysis buffer) or cleaved overnight at 4 °C with 50 units of thrombin/ml of settled beads. SDS/PAGE, Densitometry, and Western Blot Analysis—Proteins were separated by 10% SDS/PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining. For determination of the YopO-actin binding stoichiometry, the corresponding protein bands from gel filtration fractions containing the actin-YopO complex were quantified by two dimensional densitometry using a Gel Doc EQ System and Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). For Western blot, proteins were transferred by semidry blotting onto polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes for 1 h at 1.2 mA/cm2. The PVDF membrane was blocked for 1 h or overnight at room temperature or 4 °C, respectively, in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, 3% bovine serum albumin, 0.05% Tween 20. Membranes were developed with one of the following primary antibodies: anti-YpkA/YopO rabbit polyclonal (1:100,000; 20), anti-phosphoserine/threonine ATM/ATR rabbit polyclonal (1:500; Cell Signaling, New England Biolabs, Frankfurt, Germany). Secondary antibodies were goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG coupled to horseradish peroxidase (1:2,000 to 1:10,000; Amersham Biosciences). Detection was performed with an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (ECL; Amersham Biosciences). Phosphorylation Assays—Kinase reactions were performed with 3–10 μg of GST-YopO, YopOwt, or the indicated fragments in 20 μl of kinase buffer containing 20 mm Hepes pH 7.4, 1.0 mm ATP, 1 mm DTT, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2 supplemented with 5 μCi of [γ-32P]adenosine 5′-triphosphate (Amersham Biosciences) and incubated with 3–10 μg of D. discoideum G-actin for 30 min at 30 °C. Where indicated, human platelet G-actin, D. discoideum G-actin, or rabbit skeletal muscle G- or F-actin were added. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 4 × SDS/PAGE sample buffer and heating for 5 min at 95 °C. Radioactivity in dried SDS/PAGE gels or on blot membranes was visualized using phosphorimaging (Fujifilm FLA 3000) and Aida 4.0 Image Analyzer software or by exposure to x-ray film. Mass Spectrometry Analysis of Phosphorylated YopO—YopOwt or mutant proteins were subjected to a phosphorylation reaction (see above) in the presence of 1 mm cold ATP, separated by 10% SDS/PAGE, and stained with Coomassie Blue. Protein bands were excised and in-gel-digested using modified trypsin (Promega, Mannheim, Germany) according to standard procedures (29Bonaldi T. Imhof A. Regula J.T. Proteomics. 2004; 4: 1382-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Peptides were desalted using ZipTips (Millipore, Schwalbach, Germany) and either eluted using a saturated α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid solution in 50% acetonitrile, 0.3% trifluoroacetic acid for matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight analysis or by spray negative ion mode spray solution (50% methanol, 5% ammonium hydroxide) for MS/MS analysis (MS/MS is tandem mass spectrometry (MS)) and precursor ion scans. Precursor ion scans were recorded in negative mode on a Q-STAR XL tandem mass spectrometer detecting all precursor ions that resulted in a product ion with a m/z value of 79 atomic mass units (PO–3). The charge state of the precursor ions was resolved in a negative ion mode time-of-flight spectrum of the same sample. Chromatography and Purification of YopO-Actin Complex—For preparation of monomeric YopO-(89–729), 500 μgof protein in 50 μl of buffer containing 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm CaCl2 were loaded onto a Superdex 200 PC 3.2/30 column equilibrated with 30 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT in a Smart system (Amersham Biosciences). The flow rate was 40 μl/min, and the fraction size was 50 μl. Fractions eluting shortly before the 66-kDa marker contained monomeric YopO and were combined. Freshly dialyzed D. discoideum actin (50 μl, 1 μg/μl) in 2 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.2 mm CaCl2 was centrifuged for 30 min at 4 °C and 100,000 × g to remove residual F-actin. For preparation of the YopO-actin complex, monomeric YopO-(89–729) and G-actin (1 μg/μl, each) were mixed in gel filtration buffer, incubated for 15 min at room temperature, and then loaded onto the gel filtration column at a flow rate of 40 μl/min and a fraction size of 25 μl. Fractions were analyzed by SDS/PAGE, Coomassie Blue staining or by Western blot analysis as indicated. For dephosphorylation, purified YopO-(89–729)-actin complex was incubated with or without protein serine/threonine phosphatase 1 (2500 units/ml; New England Biolabs) at 30 °C for 1 h and then refractionated on gel filtration columns. Molecular mass markers were sweet potato β-amylase (200 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), and bovine erythrocyte carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa). GST Pulldown Assays—D. discoideum G-actin (∼30 μg in 200 μl of 2 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 0.2 mm Na-ATP, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.01% NaN3) was incubated with 50 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads and loaded with 30 μg of the appropriate GST fusion protein at 4 °C for 1.5 h. Beads were washed 4× with lysis buffer containing 1% Triton-X100 and then subjected to SDS/PAGE and Western blot analysis. Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed with an analytical ultracentrifuge (Optima XL-I; Beckman Instruments) equipped with absorbance and interference optics. Aluminum double sector cells with sapphire windows were used throughout. Protein solutions containing 0.3 mg of YopO-actin complex per ml were dialyzed against 30 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl. The partial specific volume was estimated from the amino acid composition of YopO and actin yielding a value of 0.737 ml/g. The protein solution was centrifuged at 8064 × g and 4 °C for 72 h. Cell Rounding, Actin Disruption, and Phagocytosis Assays— Cells (HBMEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cells, human monocytes) were transiently transfected with vectors expressing GFP or GFP-YopO constructs using Metafectene (Biontex, Martinsried, Germany) or Amaxa nucleofector technology (Amaxa, Cologne, Germany). Cells showing GFP fluorescence were scored for rounding/arborization using phase contrast microscopy and for actin filament disruption using Alexa Fluor 568 phalloidin staining. Only cells with completely rounded phenotype or complete disruption of actin filaments were scored as positive. IgG- or complement coated sheep red blood cells were added at a ratio of 15:1 to human monocytes (30Wiedemann A. Linder S. Grassl G. Albert M. Autenrieth I. Aepfelbacher M. Cell. Microbiol. 2001; 10: 693-702Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar) transfected with vectors expressing GFP or GFP-YopOwt. Intra- and extracellular sheep red blood cells were distinguished by phase contrast microscopy as described (31Braun V. Fraisier V. Raposo G. Hurbain I. Sibarita J.B. Chavrier P. Galli T. Niedergang F. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4166-4176Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Yersinia invasin-coated fluorescent latex beads were attached to HBMEC (50:1) expressing GFP, GFP-YopOwt, or GFP-N17Rac. The percentage of internalized beads was determined as described (30Wiedemann A. Linder S. Grassl G. Albert M. Autenrieth I. Aepfelbacher M. Cell. Microbiol. 2001; 10: 693-702Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Yersinia YadA expressing E. coli were attached to cells expressing the indicated GFP-YopO constructs (ratio 30:1), and internalized bacteria were quantified with a double immunofluorescence staining method as described (30Wiedemann A. Linder S. Grassl G. Albert M. Autenrieth I. Aepfelbacher M. Cell. Microbiol. 2001; 10: 693-702Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 32Roggenkamp A. Neuberger H.R. Flugel A. Schmoll T. Heesemann J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 1207-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Internalization was normalized to control cells that were set to 100%. Statistical evaluation was performed using Student's t test. To verify equal expression of GFP fusion proteins, the respective transfected cells were recorded with a spot Pursuit 1.4MP monochrome camera and Spot software (Diagnostic Instruments, Inc, Sterling Heights, MI) using identical exposure settings. Average pixel intensities of three outlined regions per cell were obtained using ImageJ software (Research Services Branch, National Institute of Mental Health) and imported into graphics program for statistical analysis. YopO Autophosphorylation Is Stimulated by G-actin—The modular protein organization of YopO is depicted in Fig. 1. The N-terminal region mediating bacterial secretion/translocation and membrane localization in host cells is followed by the predicted kinase domain (amino acids 150–400). The C-terminal half of YopO contains a Rho GTPase binding GDI-like domain (within amino acids 431–612) and a stretch of amino acids (amino acids 710–729) displaying homology to the actin bundling protein coronin. This domain model is a synopsis of all published structural and biochemical data of YopO and YpkA (9Cornelis G.R. Boland A. Boid A.P. Geuijen C. Iriarte M. Neyt C. Sory M.P. Stainier I. Microbiol.

EMBO J. 2006; 25: 3223-3233Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). To determine which form of actin stimulates YopO kinase, we assayed autophosphorylation of recombinant wild type YopO (YopOwt) in the presence of G-actin or F-actin. As described before (22Juris S.J. Rudolph A.E. Huddler D. Orth K. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 17: 9431-9436Crossref Scopus (152) Google Scholar), no autophosphorylation of YopO occurred in the absence of actin. By comparison, YopO autophosphorylation was detectable already at a G-actin:YopO molar ratio of 0.1:1 and was maximal at a 1:1 ratio. In contrast, even a 5-fold molar excess of F-actin versus YopO did not significantly stimulate YopO autophosphorylation (Fig. 2a). We also investigated whether muscle and nonmuscle actins differ in their ability to stimulate YopO. These experiments showed that human platelet actin and D. discoideum actin were equally effective in activating YopO autophosphorylation, whereas muscle actin was about a 110 as active (supplemental Fig. 1S). Yet at high enough concentrations muscle G-actin could also cause full activation of YopO. 4G. Yüksekdag, R. Rost, M. Schleicher, and M. Aepfelbacher, unpublished results. Hence, YopO kinase is best activated by nonmuscle G-actin, which fits with the idea that it mainly acts in immune cells such as neutrophils and macrophages (9Cornelis G.R. Boland A. Boid A.P.

YopO and Actin Form a Phosphorylation-independent 1:1 Complex—To get first insights into the mechanism of YopO activation by G-actin, we sought to determine the stoichiometry and molecular mass of the YopO-G-actin complex. Because YopOwt tends to degrade and requires detergents such as Triton X-100 for purification and stability (22Juris S.J. Rudolph A.E. Huddler D. Orth K. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 17: 9431-9436Crossref Scopus (152) Google Scholar), we produced a construct that lacks the N-terminal amino acids 1–88 that serve as the bacterial secretion and translocation signal, giving rise to YopO-(89–729) (Fig. 1). As anticipated, YopO-(89–729) retained all the in vitro activities of YopOwt (see below). To isolate an YopO-actin complex, prepurified monomeric YopO-(89–729) was incubated with D. discoideum G-actin. Formation of a complex was verified by gel filtration chromatography. As shown in Fig. 2b, upper and lower panel, YopO-(89–729) and G-actin individually eluted as monomeric proteins around the 66 kDa and between the 66- and 29-kDa markers, respectively. Upon coincubation, YopO-(89–729) and actin could be detected in fractions eluting between the 200- and 66-kDa markers, indicating formation of an YopO-actin complex (Fig. 2b, middle panel). To determine the YopO-actin stoichiometry, we quantified the two proteins within the complex by densitometry of Coomassie Blue-stained gels using separate dilution series for calibration. The molar ratio of YopO to actin was determined as 1:1. To directly measure the mass of the YopO-actin complex, sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation was performed (see supplemental Fig. 2S for a representative experiment). These experiments yielded a molecular mass of 126 ± 6 kDa (mean ± S.D.; n = 2) for the YopO-actin complex purified by gel filtration chromatography (fractions corresponding to the boxed lanes in Fig. 2b were used). This clearly indicated that the YopO-actin complex consists of one molecule of actin and one molecule of YopO. We also tested whether dephosphorylation of YopO has an effect on the stability of the YopO-actin complex. By using an anti-phosphoserine/threonine antibody (see supplemental Fig. 3S) it was first verified that YopO in the complex with actin was phosphorylated (Fig. 2c). The purified complex was treated with the nonspecific protein serine/threonine phosphatase 1 and again loaded onto the gel filtration column. As documented in Fig. 2c, the complex of dephosphorylated YopO and actin remained stable. We, therefore, conclude that YopO is phosphorylated upon forming a 1:1 complex with G-actin, but phosphorylation is not required for the stability of the complex. YopO Contains Separate N- and C-terminal G-actin Binding Sites— To delineate the regions of YopO involved in actin binding, we performed pulldown assays using purified D. discoideum G-actin and N- and C-terminal deletion mutants of YopO fused to GST (depicted in Fig. 1). As demonstrated in Fig. 3, GST-YopO-(89–729) and kinase-defective GST-YopOK269A bound as effectively to actin as GST-YopOwt, indicating that neither the N-terminal secretion/translocation region nor autophosphorylation of YopO is necessary for actin binding. GST-YopO-(151–729), GST-YopO-(399–729), and GST-YopO-(441–729) all pulled down G-actin. In contrast, GST-YopO-(541–729) and GST-YopO-(700–729), containing the putative C-terminal actin binding domain and the coronin homology region, respectively, did not pull down actin (21Prehna G. Ivanov M.I. Bliska J.B. Stebbins C. Cell. 2006; 126: 869-880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 22Juris S.J. Rudolph A.E. Huddler D. Orth K. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 17: 9431-9436Crossref Scopus (152) Google Scholar). As reported before, YopO-(89–710) was unable to bind to actin in this assay (22Juris S.J. Rudolph A.E. Huddler D. Orth K. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 17: 9431-9436Crossref Scopus (152) Google Scholar; Fig. 3). Consequently, YopO-(89–440) harboring the predicted catalytic domain and lacking the C-terminal half of the protein did not present actin binding activity either (Fig. 3). These results indicate that the C-terminal portion of YopO harbors an actin binding site for which amino acids 441–729 are necessary and sufficient. In experiments aimed to narrow down the YopO catalytic domain, we noticed that YopO-(89–440) harboring the kinase region displayed autophosphorylation in the presence but not in the absence of G-actin (data in Fig. 5b). This indicated that the N-terminal half of YopO-(89–440) must also have the capability to associate with actin even thou"

Although all known β-catenin target genes encode proteins, genome-wide RNA profiling studies indicate that many transcripts do not have this capability. Transcription factor-binding sites associated with these noncoding transcripts can be identified using unbiased techniques such as serial analysis of chromatin occupancy (SACO). We used this method to identify a β-catenin-regulated antisense RNA expressed in HCT116 colorectal carcinoma cells, a cellular model of activated β-catenin signaling. Genomic signature tags designating putative β-catenin-binding sites mapped to the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) of the E2F4 gene. We showed that both β-catenin and TCF4 bind to the E2F4 3′-UTR site in vivo, inducing expression of an E2F4 antisense transcript. LiCl, which mimics Wnt signaling, also induced expression of the E2F4 antisense transcript and decreased E2F4 protein levels. This effect was blocked by a cDNA expressing the E2F4 3′-UTR sense strand. The antisense-mediated decrease in E2F4 protein was reflected by reduced E2F4 association with specific target genes, including CCNA2, CDC2, PCNA, and Rad54. We propose that Wnt/β-catenin signaling may contribute to colorectal carcinogenesis by reducing the level of the E2F4 cell cycle repressor via an antisense mechanism.

The Wnt signaling pathway is central to cell fate decisions critical for development and homeostasis in metazoan organisms (for review, see Refs. 1Moon R.T. Kohn A.D. De Ferrari G.V. Kaykas A. Nat.

In the absence of Wnt, cytoplasmic β-catenin resides in a multi-protein complex that includes the adenomatous polyposis coli protein, axin, and glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β). 2The abbreviations used are: GSK, glycogen synthase kinase; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; siRNA, small interfering RNA; SACO, serial analysis of chromatin occupancy; GST, genomic signature tag; UTR, untranslated region. Within this complex, β-catenin is phosphorylated by GSK3β and targeted for proteasomal degradation. Wnt signaling inactivates GSK3β and stabilizes β-catenin, which allows for its transport into the nucleus. Once in the nucleus, β-catenin associates with members of the TCF/Lef family of DNA-binding proteins and activates gene expression (6Molenaar M. van de Wetering M. Oosterwegel M. Peterson-Maduro J.

One important consequence of β-catenin signaling is the stimulation of cellular proliferation. Indeed, 90% of sporadic colon carcinomas contain mutations in the canonical Wnt signaling pathway (8Morin P.J. Sparks A.B. Korinek V. Barker N. Clevers H. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W.

Thus, an understanding of the pathophysiology of colorectal cancers would be greatly enhanced through the identification of novel β-catenin genomic targets. A frequently cited collection of direct β-catenin targets currently lists only 28 mammalian genes, all of which encode proteins (www.stanford.edu/~rnusse/wntwindow.html). However, recent studies by the FANTOM3 (functional annotation of mouse 3) consortium indicated that the number of transcripts far exceeds the number of protein-coding genes (10Carninci P. Kasukawa T.

Indeed, it has been suggested that some of these atypical regulatory elements could potentially control the expression of noncoding transcripts (12Johnson R. Gamblin R.J. Ooi L. Bruce A.W.

Thus, it seemed reasonable to assume that noncoding as well as coding transcripts might be regulated by the Wnt signaling pathway. Two experimental techniques have been developed to identify transcription factor-binding sites on a genome-wide level. In ChIP-chip assays, immunoprecipitated chromatin fragments are hybridized to microarrays typically designed to represent 5′-flanking regions (15Hanlon S.E. Lieb J.D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2004; 14: 697-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Detection of binding sites is limited by the number of features and types of elements in array design. In particular, a 5′ bias in the design of many of the “promoter” type arrays may lead to a severe underestimate of the number of sites regulated by a given transcription factor. More comprehensive tiled arrays enable more extensive coverage, but completely tiled mammalian genome arrays are not yet available. In contrast, sequence-based techniques, such as serial analysis of chromatin occupancy (SACO), identify and localize transcription factor targets in an unbiased manner (13Impey S. McCorkle S.R. Cha-Molstad H. Dwyer J.M. Yochum G.S. Boss J.M. McWeeney S. Dunn J.J. Mandel G. Goodman R.H. Cell. 2004; 119: 1041-1054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar, 16Wei C.L.

Thus, an advantage of the sequence-based approaches is that they can detect transcription factor-binding sites that might regulate the expression of novel noncoding RNAs. This report addresses a novel β-catenin-regulated transcript derived from the E2F4 gene locus. The E2F family of transcription factors contains at least eight members that coordinate expression of genes involved in cell cycle entry, progression, and exit (for review, see Refs. 21Dyson N. Genes. Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1971) Google Scholar, 22Nevins J.R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 699-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar, 23Cam H. Dynlacht B.D.

Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar). E2F target genes are also involved in DNA repair, cell cycle checkpoints, and apoptosis. E2F1, E2F2, and E2F3a activate genes involved in transiting the G1/S boundary, whereas E2F3b is a repressor expressed throughout the cell cycle. E2F4 and E2F5 function during G0 and early G1 and are also believed to act predominately as repressors. E2F6 and 7 are thought to function as transcriptional repressors as well, but, as is the case for E2F8, their precise roles in cell cycle regulation are not fully understood. Although cell cycle progression is promoted by both β-catenin and the activating E2F family members, these pathways are not believed to intersect. We used SACO to identify a novel β-catenin target that links these two pathways in HCT116 colorectal carcinoma cells, a prototypical model of activated Wnt/β-catenin function. β-Catenin binding to a consensus TCF element within the genomic region representing the E2F4 3′-UTR was found to induce expression of an E2F4 antisense transcript. The antisense transcript in turn reduced E2F4 protein levels and decreased binding of E2F4 to target gene promoters. These observations suggest a novel mechanism for Wnt signaling to activate expression of genes repressed by E2F4. Cell Culture—HCT116 cells (ATCC number CCL-247) were grown in McCoy's 5A modified medium (ATCC). HEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen). H1299 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen). The media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 units/ml streptomycin, and 5 mm l-glutamine. The cells were maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—Antibodies used for ChIP included: 3 μg of anti-β-catenin (BD Transduction, 610154), 3 μg of anti-TCF4 (Upstate Biotechnology, 05-511), 3 μg of anti-E2F4 (Santa Cruz, SC1082), 3 μg of anti-β-galactosidase (Promega, Z378B), 3 μg of anti-Gal4 (Santa Cruz, SC577), and 6 μg of rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 315-005-003). ChIP assays contained 5 × 106 cells and were conducted as reported (25Nelson J.D. Denisenko O. Sova P. Bomsztyk K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: e2Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) with the following modifications: chromatin in formaldehyde-fixed cell lysates was sonicated to an average size of ∼600 bp using a Misonex cup horn sonicator (5 × 20 s, 140–150 Watt pulses with 60-s rest intervals on ice). The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C and then incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. Secondary rabbit anti-mouse IgG was added for 6 h the following day. Immunocomplexes captured with bovine serum albumin/glycogen-blocked protein A-Sepharose (Repligen) were washed, and precipitated DNA fragments were isolated with 10% Chelex-100 (Bio-Rad) as described (25Nelson J.D. Denisenko O. Sova P. Bomsztyk K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: e2Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Isolated DNA fragments were quantified by real time PCR as previously described (13Impey S. McCorkle S.R. Cha-Molstad H. Dwyer J.M. Yochum G.S. Boss J.M. McWeeney S. Dunn J.J. Mandel G. Goodman R.H.

Primers were designed using MIT Primer3 software (frodo.wi.mit.edu/cgi-bin/primer3_www.cgi) and synthesized at IDT technologies. The sequences are available upon request. SACO—Briefly, an adapter was ligated to ChIP fragments, and the DNA was amplified using limited PCR. Digestion of the ChIP fragments with NlaIII provides an anchor for ligation of adapters containing a recognition sequence for MmeI. MmeI is a class IIS restriction enzyme that cleaves 20–22 base pairs downstream from its binding site leaving a 5′-NN overhang. The MmeI-digested fragments were self-ligated to form cassette bound “ditags.” Each ditag contains two 20–22-base pair genomic signature tags (GSTs), corresponding to two independent β-catenin-binding regions. The cassette-bound ditags were digested with NlaIII and concatamerized, and the resultant fragments were subcloned into the SphI site of pZERO-2 (Invitrogen). A second SphI site in the kanamycin resistance gene in pZERO-2 was mutated using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) prior to subcloning of the concatamers.

Ayer (Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah). cDNA encoding full-length β-catenin was a gift from M. Wong (Oregon Health and Science University) and was subcloned into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) as a BamHI fragment. Serine 45 was mutated to phenylalanine using pcDNA3.1-β-catenin and primers 5′-ACC ACA GCT CCT TTT CTG AGT GGT-3′ and 5′-ACC ACT CAG AAA AGG AGC TGT GGT-3′ in a site-directed mutagenesis reaction (Stratagene). The pGL3-E2F4-3′-Luc construct was made by first PCR amplifying the 3′-UTR of E2F4 from HCT116 genomic DNA with 5′-GCT AGC TGG AAT GTT AGT AAC TGA GC-3′ and 5′-GGT ACC GCA GAA GCA AGA CAC TGA GGC-3′. The PCR products were subcloned as NheI-KpnI fragments into the pGL3-basic-luciferase vector (Stratagene). The consensus TCF site 5′-CTTTGAT-3′ was mutated to 5′-CGCTGAT-3′ using pGL3-E2F4-3′-UTR and primers 5′-GAA GGT GTC TGT GAC CTC GCT GAT GTG CCT GTT CTC-3′ and 5′-GAG AAC AGG CAC ATC AGC GAG GTC ACA GAC ACC TTC-3′ in a site-directed mutagenesis reaction (Stratagene). The E2F4 3′-UTR mammalian expression constructs used pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) as the vector backbone. E2F4 3′-UTR in the sense orientation was PCR-amplified using 5′-CAT GGA TCC CTG ACA GGG ACA TGC CCT GTG-3′and 5′-CAT GAA TTC GCC GAA ATG AAG AGA GGG TTA TGG-3′. E2F4 3′-UTR in the antisense orientation was PCR-amplified using 5′-CAT GAA TTC CTG ACA GGG ACA TGC CCT GTG-3′ and 5′-CAT GGA TCC GCC GAA ATG AAG AGA GGG TTA TGG-3′. Both products were subcloned into pcDNA3.1 as BamHI-EcoRI fragments. Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR—5 × 106 HCT116 cells were lysed using a Qiashredder column (Qiagen). RNA was isolated using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Genomic DNA was removed using the DNA free kit (Ambion), and the DNase was removed using a DNase inactivation reagent (Ambion). First strand cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of DNA-free RNA using a random hexamer primer (Invitrogen) and Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). α-2-Tubulin (tubulin) was amplified from random primed cDNA with 5′-GGG GCT GGG TAA ATG GCA AA-3′ and 5′-TGG CAC TGG CTC TGG GTT CG-3′ using PCR. The E2F4-specific oligonucleotides 5′-GAA TGT TAG TAA CTG AGC TCC C-3′ and 5′-GTC AAC CTC TGA CTG ACA GG-3′ were used to prime first strand cDNA for detection of the E2F4 antisense transcript. The E2F4 antisense transcript was detected using the E2F4-specific primers 5′-CGC AGA GCA GGG GAA CAG GA-3′ and 5′-GCC GCA GAA AGG GAG AAG CA-3′ by PCR. Reactions lacking reverse transcriptase were run in parallel as a control for the presence of genomic DNA. To quantify cDNA, real time PCR was conducted as for ChIP, except 10 ng of cDNA was used as template. Mapping of the 5′-Capped Nucleotide—A modification of the first choice RNA ligase-mediated rapid amplification of cDNA ends kit (Ambion) was used to identify the 5′-capped nucleotide of the E2F4 antisense transcript as reported (26Kim T.H.

Luciferase Reporter Assays—For each sample, examined in quadruplicate, 5 × 105 HEK293 cells were seeded in one well of a 12-well plate. The following amounts of plasmid were transfected using ExGen 500 (Fermentas) as indicated in the figure: pGL3-E2F4 3′-UTR-Luc or pGL3-E2F4 3′-UTR-Luc (mut), 125 ng; pcDNA3.1-β-catenin S45F, 250 ng; pME18F-dnLEF (delta N67) or pME18F-LEF-HDAC, 250 ng; and pCMV-β-Gal, 25 ng. Total DNA transfected was adjusted to 2 μg with pBluescript (Stratagene). Transfection complexes were removed after a 5-h incubation. Luciferase assays were performed as previously described, and the values were normalized to β-galactosidase (27Impey S. Fong A.L. Wang Y. Cardinaux J.R. Fass D.M. Obrietan K. Wayman G.A. Storm D.R.

Cellular Fractionation—Pelleted HCT116 cells were resuspended in nuclear isolation buffer (10 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 0.625% Nonidet P-40) and allowed to swell on ice for 15 min. After 25 strokes with a Dounce homogenizer, the nuclei were pelleted for 10 min at 4 °C at 3000 rpm (960 × g). The soluble fraction was removed to a new tube and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm (20,800 × g) to pellet organelles and insoluble material. The soluble fraction is cytoplasm. Total RNA was isolated from nuclei and cytoplasm using TRIzol (Invitrogen). Polyadenylated RNA was purified from total RNA using the Oligotex direct mRNA kit (Qiagen). Western Blot—Western blots were conducted as previously described (28Zhang Q. Wang S.Y. Nottke A.C. Rocheleau J.V. Piston D.W. Goodman R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 9029-9033Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Dilutions of antibodies used are: 1:1000 β-catenin (BD Transduction, 610154), 1:200 TCF4 (Upstate Biotechnology, 05-511), 1:10,000 α-tubulin (Sigma, T3526), and 1:1000 E2F4 (Santa Cruz, SC1082). siRNAs and Transfection of HCT116 Cells—SMARTpool siRNAs directed against β-catenin and E2F4 were from Dharmacon. 100–200 pmol of siRNA were transfected into 5 × 106 HCT116 cells using the Nucleofector Kit V according to the manufacturer's guidelines (Amaxa). siRNAs were incubated with cells for 48 h prior to either ChIP or Western blot analysis. 3 μgof E2F4 3′-UTR was transfected into HCT116 cells by nucleofection (Amaxa). Parallel assays using green fluorescent protein indicated that 90–100% of cells were transfected. Northern Blot—Total RNA from HCT116 and HEK293 cells was isolated using the RNAEasy kit (Qiagen). 10 μg of poly(A)-enriched mRNA was purified using Oligotex resin (Qiagen). Northern blot was performed using the Northern Max kit (Ambion). The E2F4 3′-UTR riboprobe was synthesized using the Maxiscript in vitro transcription kit (Ambion) with T7 RNA polymerase and linear pcDNA3.1 E2F4 3′-UTR sense plasmid. To remove unincorporated [32P]UTP, the probe was purified over NucAway (Ambion) centrifuge columns. The probe (107 cpm) was added to 2 ml of ULTRAhybe (Ambion) and hybridized overnight at 68 °C. The blot was rinsed twice with low stringency wash buffer (2× SSC, 0.1% SDS) and twice with high stringency wash buffer (0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS) for 30 min at 68 °C. HCT116 cells contain a mutated β-catenin allele that stabilizes the β-catenin protein (9Ilyas M. Tomlinson I.P. Rowan A. Pignatelli M. Bodmer W.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10330-10334Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Stabilized β-catenin is translocated into the nucleus where it activates a genetic program that has only partially been characterized. We used SACO to identify the genomic targets of β-catenin in HCT116 cells, a colon cancer model of activated Wnt/β-catenin signaling. 3G. S. Yochum, S. McWeeney, and R. H. Goodman, manuscript in preparation. In this approach, transcription factor-binding sites are identified by 20–22-bp genomic tags termed GSTs that are mapped to genomic databases (13Impey S. McCorkle S.R. Cha-Molstad H. Dwyer J.M. Yochum G.S. Boss J.M. McWeeney S. Dunn J.J. Mandel G. Goodman R.H.

Three tags mapped to the 3′-UTR region of the E2F4 gene, suggesting that this β-catenin-binding site could demarcate a promoter that regulates an E2F4 antisense transcript. We first sought to confirm β-catenin binding to the E2F4 3′-UTR sequences using ChIP assays. To test the efficacy of the β-catenin antibody, we assayed its ability to precipitate the promoters of two known β-catenin targets, c-myc and cyclin D1 (29He T.C. Sparks A.B. Rago C. Hermeking H.

Nature. 1999; 398: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (3258) Google Scholar). Enhanced β-catenin binding was seen at both promoters (Fig. 1A). To ensure that the binding was specific, we tested several additional sites, including tubulin and GAPDH, which are not known to be β-catenin target genes, as well as six 5-kilobase genomic regions that lack a consensus TCF site (Fig. 1A, labeled ctrl 1–6). The signal detected using the β-catenin or β-galactosidase antibodies were equivalent at these nonspecific sites, reflecting background binding. Importantly, significant binding to the E2F4 3′-UTR site was detected, confirming that β-catenin binds this region in vivo (Fig. 1A). β-Catenin is believed to bind DNA primarily via TCF/Lef, and in colon cells, the predominant member of this family is TCF4 (3Gregorieff A. Clevers H. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 877-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar, 31Korinek V. Barker N. Moerer P. van Donselaar E. Huls G. Peters P.J. Clevers H. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 379-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar). To determine whether TCF4 also bound the E2F4 3′-UTR sequences, we repeated the ChIP assays using TCF4 antibodies. TCF4 bound the c-myc and cyclin D1 promoters, in agreement with previous studies (Fig. 1B) (29He T.C. Sparks A.B. Rago C. Hermeking H. Zawel L. da Costa L.T. Morin P.J. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W.

Significant levels of TCF4 binding to the E2F4 3′-UTR sequences were also detected, suggesting that β-catenin is recruited to this region via TCF4. As was the case"
https://openalex.org/W1992289069,"The modular xylanase Cex (or CfXyn10A) from Cellulomonas fimi consists of an N-terminal catalytic domain and a C-terminal cellulose-binding domain, joined by a glycosylated proline-threonine (PT) linker. To characterize the conformation and dynamics of the Cex linker and the consequences of its modification, we have used NMR spectroscopy to study full-length Cex in its nonglycosylated (∼47 kDa) and glycosylated (∼51 kDa) forms. The PT linker lacks any predominant structure in either form as indicated by random coil amide chemical shifts. Furthermore, heteronuclear 1H-15N nuclear Overhauser effect relaxation measurements demonstrate that the linker is flexible on the ns-to-ps time scale and that glycosylation partially dampens this flexibility. The catalytic and cellulose-binding domains also exhibit identical amide chemical shifts whether in isolation or in the context of either unmodified or glycosylated full-length Cex. Therefore, there are no noncovalent interactions between the two domains of Cex or between either domain and the linker. This conclusion is supported by the distinct 15N relaxation properties of the two domains, as well as their differential alignment within a magnetic field by Pf1 phage particles. These data demonstrate that the PT linker is a flexible tether, joining the structurally independent catalytic and cellulosebinding domains of Cex in an ensemble of conformations; however, more extended forms may predominate because of restrictions imparted by the alternating proline residues. This supports the postulate that the binding-domain anchors Cex to the surface of cellulose, whereas the linker provides flexibility for the catalytic domain to hydrolyze nearby hemicellulose (xylan) chains.

Cellulolytic organisms produce a battery of endo- and exoglucanases necessary for the hydrolysis of cellulose and hemicellulose. These glycoside hydrolases are typically modular, consisting of conserved catalytic and carbohydrate-binding domains (or modules), as well as possible ancillary domains, joined by variable linker sequences (1Gilkes N.R. Henrissat B. Kilburn D.G. Miller Jr., R.C. Warren R.A. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55: 303-315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Gilbert H.J. Hazlewood G.P. J. Gen.

In general, the constituent domains of glycoside hydrolases are structurally independent and exhibit some aspects of their respective functions when separated (4Tomme P. Vantilbeurgh H. Pettersson G.

Thus, binding modules appear to facilitate catalysis by targeting and maintaining the proximity of the catalytic domain toward substrates within complex macromolecular systems, such as the plant cell wall, as well as through possible disruptive effects on the structures of the polysaccharides within these systems (7Boraston A.B. Bolam D.N. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 769-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (1488) Google Scholar, 8Shoseyov O. Shani Z. Levy I. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2006; 70: 283-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar).The synergistic activity of the catalytic and carbohydrate-binding domains in a glycoside hydrolase requires that they be covalently tethered to one another via a linker sequence of the appropriate length and/or flexibility. The functional importance of these interdomain linkers, which can range from only a few to over a hundred residues and are often rich in proline and hydroxyamino acids (1Gilkes N.R. Henrissat B. Kilburn D.G. Miller Jr., R.C. Warren R.A. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55: 303-315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), has been established largely through deletion studies (9Shen H. Schmuck M. Pilz I.

The early observation that these sequences are often susceptible to proteolysis led to the hypothesis that they are exposed, flexible polypeptide regions joining independently folded catalytic and binding domains (4Tomme P. Vantilbeurgh H. Pettersson G. Vandamme J. Vandekerckhove J. Knowles J. Teeri T. Claeyssens M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 170: 575-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 13van Tilbeurgh H.

In support of this hypothesis, initial SAXS 2The abbreviations used are: SAXS, small angle x-ray scattering; CexCD, the catalytic domain (residues 1-315) of C. fimi Cex; CexCBD, the cellulosebinding domain (residues 336-443) of Cex; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum correlation; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; RDC, residual dipolar coupling; TROSY, transverse relaxation optimized spectroscopy; PT linker, proline-threonine linker (residues 316-335) of Cex. 2The abbreviations used are: SAXS, small angle x-ray scattering; CexCD, the catalytic domain (residues 1-315) of C. fimi Cex; CexCBD, the cellulosebinding domain (residues 336-443) of Cex; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum correlation; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; RDC, residual dipolar coupling; TROSY, transverse relaxation optimized spectroscopy; PT linker, proline-threonine linker (residues 316-335) of Cex. studies on cellulases from Cellulomonas fimi and Humicola jecorina indicated that these two-domain enzymes adopt an elongated tadpole shape with the head (catalytic domain) and tail (cellulose-binding domain) connected by relatively extended proline-rich and serine/threonine-rich linkers, respectively (9Shen H.

This general view has been refined through more recent SAXS analyses demonstrating that native and chimeric cellulases from Humicola insolens and Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis adopt an ensemble of tertiary structures with a distribution of interdomain separations that is attributable to the flexibility of the intervening serine/threonine-rich linker sequences (19Receveur V.

However, because of experimental limitations, the degree of flexibility of the linker within the native H. insolens enzyme could not be determined directly. A comparison of the dimensions measured for various cellulases by SAXS has also led to the suggestion that glycosylation favors more extended conformations (19Receveur V. Czjzek M. Schulein M.

This conclusion is complicated by the different linker sequences of these enzymes, particularly with respect to their proline content. Regardless, such studies have led to a general model whereby some cellulases bind and cleave crystalline cellulose through a caterpillarlike motion mediated by a flexible interdomain linker (19Receveur V.

Alternatively, in the cases of glycoside hydrolases such as the endo/exocellulase E4 from Thermobifida fusca, the catalytic and cellulose-binding domains are effectively fused because of the absence of a linker sequence (22Sakon J. Irwin D. Wilson D.B. Karplus P.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 810-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). This may facilitate processivity by directing a bound cellulose strand into the active site of the enzyme.Three-dimensional structures have also been determined by x-ray crystallography for two intact family 10 glycoside hydrolases with short linker sequences. Electron density was absent or weak for nine residues of the serine/proline-rich linker of Streptomyces olivaceoviridis E-26 xylanase, whereas its catalytic and carbohydrate-binding domains were found to interact directly through a hydrophilic interface (23Fujimoto Z. Kuno A. Kaneko S. Yoshida S. Kobayashi H. Kusakabe I. Mizuno H. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 575-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 24Fujimoto Z. Kuno A. Kaneko S. Kobayashi H. Kusakabe I. Mizuno H. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 316: 65-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Similarly, three linker residues were not observed between the noninteracting structured domains of Cellvibrio japonicus xylanase 10C (25Pell G. Szabo L. Charnock S.J. Xie H. Gloster T.M. Davies G.J. Gilbert H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11777-11788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). These studies indicated that the linkers of such family 10 enzymes are crystallographically disordered and by inference flexible but gave no direct measure of that flexibility.To investigate on a residue-specific basis the modular structure and linker properties of a glycoside hydrolase in its unmodified and glycosylated states, we have used NMR spectroscopy to characterize the xylanase Cex (or CfXyn10A) from C. fimi. This model glycoside hydrolase is composed of an N-terminal family 10 catalytic domain (CexCD) (26White A. Withers S.G. Gilkes N.R. Rose D.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12546-12552Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) with highest activity for xylan hydrolysis and a C-terminal family 2 carbohydrate-binding module (CexCBD) (27Xu G.Y. Ong E. Gilkes N.R. Kilburn D.G. Muhandiram D.R. Harrisbrandts M. Carver J.P. Kay L.E. Harvey T.S.

Recent Advances in Carbohydrate Bioengineering. The Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge1999: 3-12Google Scholar). These two domains are joined by a 20-residue proline-threonine linker with the sequence (PT)3T(PT)3T(PT)3. Furthermore, this PT linker is O-glycosylated with α-d-mannose and α-d-galactose, such that ∼24 mol of hexose are found per mole of Cex secreted by C. fimi (30Ong E. Kilburn D.G. Miller Jr., R.C. Warren R.A. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 999-1008Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Early studies demonstrated that this modification leads to resistance of the Cex linker region against proteolytic degradation but that glycosylation has no significant effect upon kinetic parameters for hydrolysis of polymeric substrates (31Macleod A.M. Gilkes N.R. Escotecarlson L. Warren R.A.J. Kilburn D.G. Miller R.C. Gene (Amst. 1992; 121: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Without a method for the overexpression of Cex in C. fimi, only very small quantities of the endogenously glycosylated protein can be obtained. Fortunately, using Streptomyces lividans, Cex can be expressed and glycosylated in milligram amounts, as required for NMR spectroscopic characterization (30Ong E. Kilburn D.G. Miller Jr., R.C. Warren R.A. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 999-1008Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Macleod A.M. Gilkes N.R. Escotecarlson L. Warren R.A.J. Kilburn D.G. Miller R.C. Gene (Amst. 1992; 121: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Glycosylated Cex from S. lividans is reported to contain ∼17 mol of mannose, with traces of galactose, per mole of protein (30Ong E. Kilburn D.G. Miller Jr., R.C. Warren R.A. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 999-1008Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Macleod A.M. Gilkes N.R. Escotecarlson L. Warren R.A.J. Kilburn D.G. Miller R.C. Gene (Amst. 1992; 121: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). These differences are minor because samples of O-glycosylated Cex from C. fimi and S. lividans have very similar kinetic properties and are both resistant toward proteolytic degradation (31Macleod A.M. Gilkes N.R. Escotecarlson L. Warren R.A.J. Kilburn D.G. Miller R.C. Gene (Amst. 1992; 121: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 32Langsford M.L. Gilkes N.R. Singh B. Moser B.

Based on chemical shift, 15N relaxation, and amide residual dipolar coupling (RDC) measurements, we demonstrate that the catalytic and cellulose-binding domains are physically independent and joined by a PT linker that is conformationally dynamic on the ns-to-ps time scale. Glycosylation does not perturb either domain yet partially dampens the mobility of the linker. These data complement previous proteolysis, crystallographic, and SAXS studies, confirming directly the hypothesis that the PT linker is a flexible tether, joining the catalytic domain and cellulose-binding modules of Cex as two “beads-on-a-string.”EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESExpression and Purification of Uniformly 15N-labeled Cex, CexCD, and CexCBD—Nonglycosylated 15N-labeled Cex, encoded by the plasmid pUC12-1.1Cex(PTIS) (33O'Neill G.P. Anthony R. Warren J. Kilburn D.G. Miller R.C. Gene (Amst. 1986; 44: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), was expressed using Escherichia coli BL21 (λDE3) cells grown in M9 medium enriched with 1.0 g/liter 15NH4Cl (Spectra Stable Isotopes Inc.). Cex and the papain-cleaved product, CexCD (residues 1-315), were expressed and purified by cellulose affinity chromatography, according to previously published protocols (34MacLeod A.M. Lindhorst T.

Biochemistry. 2006; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). CexCBD (residues 336-443) was expressed directly using the plasmid pTug-KH6-IEGR-CBM2a in E. coli BL21 (λDE3) cells (36Graham R.W. Greenwood J.M.

Protein Eng. 2000; 13: 801-809Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The N-terminal His6 tag was not removed after purification with Ni+2 affinity chromatography. The resulting proteins were >95% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (predicted for unlabeled Cex, 47,192 Da; CexCD, 34,230 Da; His6-CexCBD, 12,272 Da). Protein concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically using predicted ϵ280 nm values of 81,440 m-1 cm-1, 52,870 m-1 cm-1, and 28,570 m-1 cm-1 for Cex, CexCD, and CexCBD, respectively (ExPASy website: ca.expasy.org/tools/protpar-ref.html).Expression of 15N-Thr-labeled Cex—Nonglycosylated 15N-Thr-labeled Cex was produced by expression of the plasmid pUC12.1.1Cex(PTIS) in E. coli BL21 (λDE3) cells grown in a synthetic medium (38Muchmore D.C.

Transformed S. lividans stock (50 μl), stored in Me2SO at -80 °C, was used to inoculate three 5-ml tryptic-soy broth cultures (EM Science), containing 20 μg/ml of thiostrepton (Sigma), in 50-ml sterile Falcon tubes. After growth in an incubator shaker at 30 °C for 48 h, the cells were collected by centrifugation, and each was used to inoculate 1.5 liters of a synthetic medium (38Muchmore D.C. McIntosh L.P. Russell C.B. Anderson D.E. Dahlquist F.W. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 177: 44-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar), containing 20 μg/ml thiostrepton, 0.016% antifoam C (Sigma), and 300 mg of l-threonine (15N, >98%), in a 3-liter beveled flask. The three cultures (totaling 4.5 liters) were grown in an incubator shaker at 30 °C for 4 days, after which the S. lividans mycelium was removed by vacuum filtration through a Whatman glass microfiber filter. The supernatant, containing secreted glycosylated Cex, was incubated with CF-1 cellulose and purified by affinity chromatography, as described previously, yielding 37 mg of protein from 4.5 liters of isotopically enriched medium (34MacLeod A.M. Lindhorst T. Withers S.G. Warren R.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6371-6376Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 35Poon D.K.Y. Ludwiczek M.L. Schubert M. Kwan E.M. Withers S.G. McIntosh L.P. Biochemistry. 2006; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The purified protein was found to be heterogeneously glycosylated by SDS-PAGE and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry analyses.NMR Spectroscopy—NMR spectra were acquired at 30 °C on a Varian Inova 600 MHz spectrometer equipped with a gradient triple resonance cryogenic probe. All of the proteins (∼0.1-0.4 mm) were in 20 mm potassium phosphate, 0.02% NaN3 at pH 6.5 with ∼10% D2O added as a lock solvent. The spectra were processed using NMRpipe (39Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11386) Google Scholar) and analyzed with SPARKY 3.0 (40Goddard T.D. Kneeler D.G. SPARKY 3. University of California, San Francisco1999Google Scholar). The main chain 1H, 13C, and 15N assignments of CexCD were obtained through a suite of TROSY-based experiments, as described elsewhere (35Poon D.K.Y. Ludwiczek M.L. Schubert M. Kwan E.M. Withers S.G. McIntosh L.P. Biochemistry. 2006; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The 1HN and 15N assignments of Cex-CBD were based on those reported previously (27Xu G.Y. Ong E. Gilkes N.R. Kilburn D.G. Muhandiram D.R. Harrisbrandts M. Carver J.P. Kay L.E. Harvey T.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6993-7009Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). CexCBD weakly self-associates as revealed by concentration-dependent amide or indole chemical shift perturbations for several residues, including Trp350, Trp387, and Trp405 of the proposed cellulose-binding surface (27Xu G.Y. Ong E. Gilkes N.R. Kilburn D.G. Muhandiram D.R. Harrisbrandts M. Carver J.P. Kay L.E. Harvey T.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6993-7009Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Thus, 1H-15N HSQC spectra were recorded for a dilution series of CexCBD samples (∼0.1-0.4 mm) to obtain concentration-independent amide chemical shifts.1HN-15N RDC values, 1DNH, were measured from 600-MHz sensitivity-enhanced HSQC spectra of 15N-labeled Cex (∼0.5 mm, pH 6.5, 30 °C) in which the 15N signal was recorded in the TROSY mode, whereas that of the 1HN signal was recorded in either the TROSY or anti-TROSY mode. 3L. E. Kay, personal communication. After acquiring a control spectrum, partial protein alignment was achieved by the addition of Pf1 bacteriophage (Profos AG, Regensburg, Germany) to a concentration that produced 13 Hz splitting in the 2H NMR signal of the lock 1HO2H (41Hansen M.R. Hanson P. Pardi A. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 317: 220-240Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 1DNH values were obtained from the differences between the corresponding TROSY and anti-TROSY 1HN chemical shifts in the aligned versus control spectra of Cex. The axial (Da) and rhombic (R) components of the alignment tensors for the residues in catalytic and cellulose-binding domains were estimated using a Matlab routine for fitting 1DNH distribution histograms (42Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1998; 133: 216-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), as previously described (43Skrynnikov N.R. Kay L.E. J. Biomol. NMR. 2000; 18: 239-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).15N relaxation measurements were performed using TROSY-based T1,T2, and heteronuclear 1H-15N NOE experiments (44Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M. Gish G. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5984-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (1999) Google Scholar, 45Yang D.W. Kay L.E. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Steady-state heteronuclear 1H-15N NOE values were measured by recording spectra with and without 3s of proton saturation and a total recycle delay of 5.016 s. Analysis of the 15N relaxation data were carried out using SPARKY 3.0 (40Goddard T.D. Kneeler D.G. SPARKY 3. University of California, San Francisco1999Google Scholar) and TENSOR2 (46Dosset P.

The remarkably well dispersed spectrum of this 443 residue (∼47 kDa) protein overlaps almost exactly with the sum of the spectra of the isolated CexCD and CexCBD (Fig. 2, A and B). Assuming that peaks with the closest 1HN and 15N chemical shifts in the overlapped spectra of the three species correspond to the same residue, we were able to comparatively assign the amide resonances from the catalytic and cellulose-binding domains of Cex based on the reported assignments of its isolated constituent domains (27Xu G.Y. Ong E. Gilkes N.R. Kilburn D.G. Muhandiram D.R. Harrisbrandts M. Carver J.P. Kay L.E. Harvey T.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6993-7009Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 35Poon D.K.Y. Ludwiczek M.L. Schubert M. Kwan E.M. Withers S.G. McIntosh L.P. Biochemistry. 2006; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The remaining signals in the TROSY-HSQC spectrum of Cex, all of which fall within the crowded region of ∼7.9-8.4 ppm in the 1H dimension, were attributed to linker threonines, as discussed below.FIGURE 2The 1H-15N TROSY-HSQC spectra of uniformly 15N-labeled ∼0.4 mm CexCD (A), ∼0.1 mm CexCBD (B), and ∼0.4 mm nonglycosylated Cex (C), recorded at 30 °C and pH 6.5. Signals from backbone amides and indole side chains in the catalytic domain (red), cellulose-binding module (blue), and the PT linker (green) were colored manually to allow a visual comparison of the spectra. The amide 1HN-15N assignments of Cex (not labeled for clarity) were based on those reported for the isolated CexCD (35Poon D.K.Y. Ludwiczek M.L. Schubert M. Kwan E.M. Withers S.G. McIntosh L.P. Biochemistry. 2006; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar) and CexCBD (27Xu G.Y. Ong E. Gilkes N.R. Kilburn D.G. Muhandiram D.R. Harrisbrandts M. Carver J.P. Kay L.E. Harvey T.S.

The lack of any significant chemical shift differences between corresponding amides in the respective isolated catalytic and cellulose-binding domains and those in the full-length protein (quantitatively shown in supplemental Fig. S1) strongly indicates that the two modules of Cex do not interact noncovalently when tethered by the PT linker, nor are they perturbed by the presence of the linker. To confirm this conclusion, 1H-15N TROSY-HSQC spectra of full-length Cex were also recorded under identical conditions before and after treatment with papain to cleave the PT linker in situ. Without exception, the resolved resonances observed from residues of the catalytic and cellulose-binding module retained the same chemical shifts before and after proteolysis (data not shown).15N Relaxation and RDC Measurements Reveal the Interdomain Mobility of Cex—The global dynamic properties of intact Cex were compared with those of CexCD and CexCBD using 15N relaxation measurements. Based on amide 15NT1 and T2 values, the effective correlation times (τc) for the tumbling of the catalytic and cellulose-binding domains in full-length Cex (0.4 mm) were determined to be 17.6 ± 1.1 and 14.3 ± 1.0 ns, respectively. As expected because of their physical linkage, these values are higher than those measured for the isolated 34-kDa CexCD (16.1 ± 0.1 ns; ∼0.4 mm) and 12-kDa CexCBD (8.4 ± 0.1 ns; ∼0.1 mm). Also, whereas the anisotropic diffusion tensor of CexCD (with Dzz:Dyy:Dxx equal to 1.26:1.03:1.00) is consistent with its crystallographically determined prolate ellipsoid shape (35Poon D.K.Y. Ludwiczek M.L. Schubert M. Kwan E.M. Withers S.G. McIntosh L.P. Biochemistry. 2006; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar), that of the corresponding catalytic domain in Cex (2.1:1.6:1.0) is distinctly anisotropic because of the attached linker and cellulose-binding domain. Similarly, the diffusion tensor of the cellulose-binding domain of Cex differs from that of CexCBD because of the attached linker and catalytic domain (not shown). Most importantly, however, the observation that the effective τc values of the two domains within Cex differ sig"

However, in NFκB-inhibited cells, TNF stimulates also a second sustained phase of JNK activation, which has been implicated in cell death induction. In the present study, we have analyzed the relationship of cell death induction, caspase activity, JNK, and NFκB stimulation in the context of TNF signaling in four different cellular systems. In all cases, NFκB inhibition enhanced TNF-induced cell death and primed most, but not all, cells for sustained JNK activation. The caspase inhibitor Benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp(OMe)-fluoromethyl ketone (Z-VAD-fmk) and overexpression of the antiapoptotic proteins FLIP-L and Bcl2 differentially blocked transient and sustained JNK activation in NFκB-inhibited KB and HaCaT cells, indicating that the two phases of TNF-induced JNK activation occur at least in these cellular models by different pathways. Although the broad range caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk and the antioxidant butylated hydroxyanisole interfered with TNF-induced cell death to a varying extent in a cell type-specific manner, inhibition of JNK signaling had no or only a very moderate effect. Notably, the JNK inhibitory effect of neither Z-VAD-fmk nor butylated hydroxyanisole was strictly correlated with the capability of these compounds to rescue cells from TNF-induced cell death. Thus, sustained JNK activation by TNF has no obligate role in TNF-induced cell death and is mediated by caspases and reactive oxygen species in a cell type-specific manner.

Pfizenmaier K. Scheurich P. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 45-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1838) Google Scholar). Notably, the pathways that mediate these responses do not act independently in a parallel manner but are interconnected to a TNFR1-signaling network through various mechanisms. For example, apoptosis induction is inhibited by several target genes of the NFκB pathway, including those encoding cFLIP, cIAP2, TRAF1, Bcl2, BclxL, Bfl1, and xIAP (1Wajant H. Pfizenmaier K. Scheurich P. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 45-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1838) Google Scholar). Although the latter four factors globally protect against apoptosis, cFLIP and a complex containing TRAF1 and cIAP2 specifically interfere with apoptosis triggered by death receptors and TNFR1, respectively. Conversely, NFκB activation is blocked by initiator as well as effector caspases that become activated during apoptosis (1Wajant H. Pfizenmaier K. Scheurich P. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 45-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1838) Google Scholar). This inhibitory effect relies on caspase-mediated cleavage of various signaling intermediates of the NFκB pathway and typically results in the generation of dominant negative fragments of the corresponding intact proteins. Caspase targets of the NFκB pathway include proteins such as IKK2, p65, and IκBα, which are crucial mediators of NFκB signaling by a broad range of NFκB stimuli, but also proteins like RIP and TRAF1, which are specifically employed by TNFR1 and some related receptors (1Wajant H. Pfizenmaier K. Scheurich P. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 45-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1838) Google Scholar). In recent years, there is growing evidence that the balance between NFκB activation and apoptosis induction in the context of TNFR1 signaling is regulated by the JNK pathway (2Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3570) Google Scholar, 3Varfolomeev E.E. Ashkenazi A. Cell. 2004; 116: 491-497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). The role of the various JNKs and their major targets, the AP1/Jun family of transcription factors in the TNF-induced signaling network, is complex and depends on the cellular context. For example, a protective function of the JNK pathway in TNF-induced cell death has been deduced from studies with mouse embryonal fibroblasts (MEFs) of JNK1 and JunD knock-out mice, whereas JNK2-deficient MEFs have been found to be either sensitized or protected from TNF-induced apoptosis, depending on the genetic background (4Lamb J.A.

Cell. 2000; 6: 1109-1119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Moreover, TRAF2-deficient MEFs are impaired in TNF-induced JNK activation, and display increased sensitivity toward TNF, despite showing an almost normal NFκB response (6Yeh W.C. Shahinian A. Speiser D. Kraunus J. Billia F. Wakeham A. de la Pompa J.L. Ferrick D. Hum B. Iscove N. Ohashi P. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V. Mak T.W. Immunity. 1997; 7: 715-725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). Because TRAF2 also has a crucial role in the recruitment of the antiapoptotic proteins cIAP1 and cIAP2 to TNFR1 (7Rothe M. Pan M.G. Henzel W.J. Ayres T.M. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1995; 83: 1243-1252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar, 8Fotin-Mleczek M. Henkler F. Samel D. Reichwein M. Hausser A. Parmryd I. Scheurich P. Schmid J.A. Wajant H. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2757-2770Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is currently unclear whether JNK activation and/or recruitment of cIAPs contribute to the antiapoptotic action of TRAF2 in TNF signaling. TNFR1-induced JNK activation is generally very rapid and transient in viable cells, whereas in NFκB-inhibited cells, which are primed to undergo cell death after TNFR1 stimulation, JNKs are persistently activated (9Nakano H. Trends Immunol. 2004; 25: 402-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Based on in vitro experiments, it has been suggested that expression of the NFκB target genes A20, GADD45β, and X-linked IAP (XIAP) inhibit TNF-induced JNK activation and thus prevent prolonged JNK signaling after TNFR1 stimulation in normal cells (9Nakano H. Trends Immunol. 2004; 25: 402-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, analyses of the corresponding knock-out mice failed to confirm a crucial role of one of these factors in NFκB-dependent inhibition in TNF-induced JNK signaling until now but leave open the possibility that these proteins act in a redundant fashion. Alternatively, sustained JNK activity in TNF signaling might be the result of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated oxidative inhibition of JNK-inactivating phosphatases (10Kamata H. Honda S. Maeda S. Chang L. Hirata H. Karin M. Cell. 2005; 120: 649-661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1470) Google Scholar). In fact, the NFκB pathway not only blocks apoptosis but also ROS production and necrosis by inducing ROS-detoxifying enzymes such as manganese superoxide dismutase and the ferritin heavy chain (11Wong G.H. Elwell J.H. Oberley L.W. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1989; 58: 923-931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar, 12Pham C.G. Bubici C. Zazzeroni F. Papa S. Jones J. Alvarez K. Jayawardena S. Smaele E.De Cong R. Beaumont C. Torti F.M. Torti S.V. Franzoso G. Cell. 2004; 119: 529-542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Moreover, in murine embryonal fibroblasts, cell death-associated prolonged TNF-induced JNK activation is partly mediated by the JNK-stimulating MAP3K apoptosis signaling kinase 1 (ASK1), which is activated by ROS (13Tobiume K. Matsuzawa A. Takahashi T. Nishitoh H. Morita K. Takeda K. Minowa O. Miyazono K. Noda T. Ichijo H. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 222-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar, 14Liu H. Nishitoh H. Ichijo H. Kyriakis J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2198-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Notably, in MEFs, TNF induces apoptosis, necrosis, or a mixture of both, depending on the number of passages and nature of the sensitizing treatment (cycloheximide (CHX), NFκB inhibition) (15Ventura J.J. Cogswell P. Flavell R.A. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Davis R.J. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2905-2915Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Sakon et al. (16Sakon S. Xue X. Takekawa M. Sasazuki T. Okazaki T. Kojima Y. Piao J.H. Yagita H. Okumura K. Doi T. Nakano H. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3898-3909Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that prolonged TNF-induced JNK activation is mediated by ROS in necrotic MEFs. It is therefore tempting to speculate that ROS generation, oxidative inhibition of phosphatases, and apoptosis signaling kinase activation are of special relevance for sustained JNK activation in cells undergoing TNF-induced necrosis. The cell death-promoting effects of persistent JNK activation in TNF signaling has been attributed to caspase-independent cleavage of the BH3-only protein BID, resulting in a fragment designated as jBID and activation of the E3 ligase Itchy (17Deng Y. Ren X. Yang L. Lin Y. Wu X. Cell. 2003; 115: 61-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 18Chang L. Kamata H. Solinas G. Luo J.L. Maeda S. Venuprasad K. Liu Y.C.

By unknown mechanisms, jBID stimulates the selective release of SMAC/DIABLO from the mitochondria, which then abrogates the interaction of the caspase inhibitory IAP (inhibitor of apoptosis proteins) from interaction with effector caspases and TRAF2. Itchy sensitizes for TNF-induced apoptosis by driving enhanced proteasomal degradation of FLIP-L (17Deng Y. Ren X. Yang L. Lin Y. Wu X.

In this study, we show that TNF-induced persistent JNK activation in cells with inhibited NFκB signaling is cell type-dependently blocked by the pan-caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp(OMe)-fluoromethyl ketone (Z-VAD-fmk). Cells protected from TNF-induced apoptosis by overexpression of FLIP or Bcl2 displayed no sustained caspase-mediated JNK signaling but were not affected in transient JNK activation. This suggests that the caspase-mediated mode of TNF-induced sustained JNK activation is an indirect consequence of apoptosis induction rather than reflecting the lack of a direct JNK inhibitory effect of a NFκB target gene product. Cell Lines, Reagents, and Antibodies—The human keratinocyte cell line HaCaT and mouse embryonal fibroblasts were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (PAA Laboratories, Pasching, Germany) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. Jurkat cells and KB cells, which were originally established from an epidermal carcinoma of the mouth but were then found to be genetically identical to HeLa cells, were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (PAA) containing 10% fetal calf serum. The KB populations overexpressing green fluorescent protein-Bcl2 and the NEMO-deficient Jurkat cell line have already been described elsewhere (19Harhaj E.W. Good L. Xiao G. Uhlik M. Cvijic M.E. Rivera-Walsh I. Sun S.C. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1448-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The NFκB essential modifier (NEMO)-deficient MEFs, a kind gift of Dr. Sankar Ghosh, have been described previously (20Makris C. Roberts J.L. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6573-6581Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Human recombinant TNF was purchased from Knoll AG (Ludwigshafen, Germany), and Fc-CD95L was produced in 293T cells. Z-VAD-fmk was obtained from Bachem (Heidelberg, Germany). CHX and butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) were supplied by Sigma, and SP600125 was obtained from Calbiochem (Bad Soden, Germany). The antibodies specific for caspase-9, JNK, phospho-JNK, c-Jun, phospho-c-Jun, and phospho-IκBα were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Anti-cytochrome c, anti-HSP60, anti-IκBα, anti-MEKK1, and anti-SMAC were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), anti-BID and anti-poly-(ADP)-ribose polymerase (anti-PARP) were from BD Biosciences, and anti-tubulin was obtained from Dunn Labortechnik (Asbach, Germany). The p21WAF1/Cip1-specific antibody was obtained from Millipore (Billerica, MA). Retroviral Infection—The pCFG5-IGZ retroviral vector containing a cDNA encoding kinase-dead IKK2 (IKK2DN) was used for infection of HaCaT cells as described elsewhere (21Leverkus M. Sprick M.R. Wachter T. Denk A. Brocker E.B. Walczak H. Neumann M. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2003; 121: 149-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Briefly, the amphotrophic producer cell line φPNX was transfected with 10 μg of the retroviral vector by calcium phosphate precipitation. To select transfected producer cells, 1 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma) or 0.5 μg/ml zeocin were added to the culture medium for 7–14 days to obtain >95% green fluorescent protein-positive producer cells. Cell culture supernatant containing viral particles was generated by incubation of producer cells with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum overnight. Following filtration (45 μm), the culture supernatant was added to HaCaT cells seeded in 6-well plates 24 h earlier in the presence of 1 μg/ml polybrene. Cells were centrifuged for 3 h at 21 °C, and viral particle-containing supernatant was subsequently replaced by fresh medium. After 10–14 days recovery of bulk infected cultures, fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis for green fluorescent protein expression and Western blot analysis for IKK2DN expression were performed on the expanded polyclonal cells to confirm ectopic expression of these molecules. For sequential transduction with IKK2DN and FLIP-L-encoding constructs, cells were first infected with FLIP-L as previously described (22Wachter T. Sprick M. Hausmann D. Kerstan A. McPherson K.

Chem. 2004; 279: 52824-52834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and subsequently infected with either IKK2DN or the respective empty construct and selected as described above. Cell Death Assays—Adherent cells (20 × 103) were seeded in 96-well plates. The following day, the cells were preincubated as indicated with CHX (2.5 μg/ml), Z-VAD (40 μm), BHA (200 μm), or SP600125 (20 μm) or left untreated. After 1 h, the cells were treated with recombinant TNF or Fc-CD95L, and cell viability was determined 16 h later by crystal violet staining. Cell viability of suspension cells was determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) (Sigma) staining. Jurkat cells (60 × 103) were seeded in 96-well plates, and after the indicated treatments, they were incubated for 2 h with 10 μl of MTT solution. After overnight lysis in MTT lysis buffer (15% SDS, 50% N-N-dimethylformamide, pH 4.7, acetic acid), the optical density was measured at 570 nm. Western Blotting—Cell lysates for Western blotting with phosphoprotein-specific antibodies were prepared in 4× sample buffer (2% SDS, 0.1 m dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol) supplemented with phosphatase inhibitor mixtures I and II (Sigma). Cells were harvested with a rubber policeman into ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, collected by centrifugation, and then lysed in 4× sample buffer. After brief sonification, the protein samples were boiled for 5 min at 96 °C, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Cell lysates for Western blotting with non-phosphoprotein-specific antibodies were prepared in lysis buffer (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 120 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100) supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). After removal of cellular debris by two centrifugation steps (5,000 × g, 5 min, 4 °C and 14,000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C), protein concentrations were determined by Bradford assay. Proteins of interest were detected with the appropriate primary antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies. Antigen-antibody complexes were visualized using the ECL detection system. Subcellular Fractionation—For subcellular fractionation, cells were harvested, washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended at 5 × 106 cells/ml in buffer (100 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 250 mm sucrose, 20 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 μg/ml cytochalasin B, and 50 μg/ml cycloheximide) containing 0.05% digitonin and complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) and incubated for 10 min on ice. After centrifugation (10,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C), supernatant and pellet fractions were carefully separated and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. Inhibition of the NFκB Pathway Sensitizes for TNF-induced Apoptosis—To analyze the relationship of NFκB activation, apoptosis induction, and JNK stimulation in TNF signaling, we investigated four cell models in which the NFκB pathway is inhibited, Jurkat cells with a defect in NEMO/IKKγ expression, MEFs derived from NEMO knock-out mice, and KB and HaCaT cells stably expressing a dominant negative mutant of IKK2. Although in Jurkat cells and MEFs deficient in NEMO expression as well as in the IKK2DN-overexpressing HaCaT cells, phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα after TNF stimulation were fully blocked, the IKK2DN KB cells also showed no IκBα degradation but residual phosphorylation of IκBα. (Fig. 1). In all of the investigated cell models, inhibition of the NFκB pathway was associated with a strong enhancement of TNF-induced cell death (Fig. 2A). However, in KB cells and in MEFs, robust cell death induction by TNF required co-treatment with cycloheximide. In the human cell lines, we also analyzed the processing of BID, PARP, and caspase-3, -8, and -9. Enhancement of TNF-induced cell death in NFκB-inhibited HaCaT and Jurkat cells was reflected by a strong increase in the processing of caspases and their substrates (Fig. 2B). In accordance with the sensitivity of CHX-sensitized KB cells for TNF-induced apoptosis, cleavage of caspases and BID and PARP1 was already prominently induced in these cells by TNF despite an intact NFκB-signaling pathway (Fig. 2B). The additional enhancement of TNF-induced cell death in KB cells by NFκB inhibition, nevertheless, resulted in acceleration of caspase activation (Fig. 2B). In accordance with the sensitizing effect of NFκB inhibition and CHX treatment on TNF-induced cell death, we observed release of SMAC and cytochrome c into the cytosol 6 h past TNF treatment (Fig. 2C). TNF-induced cell death was completely blocked in KB cells by the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk, indicating that it occurred only by apoptosis (Fig. 2D). In the other cell types, Z-VAD-fmk rescued TNF-stimulated cells incompletely to a varying extent despite efficiently blocking cleavage of the caspase substrates PARP1 and BID, suggesting that, in these cells, TNF also triggers caspase-independent cell death, e.g. necrosis (Fig. 2E). Notably, cell death triggered by the TNFR1-related death receptor CD95 was barley-enhanced in the NFκB-compromised cells (Fig. 2F). CD95 and TNFR1 signal apoptosis downstream of the initiator caspase caspase-8 by a common pathway (23Wajant H. Essays Biochem. 2003; 39: 53-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The differential modulation of CD95- and TNFR1-induced apoptosis implicates that one or more NFκB-regulated factors interfere with TNFR1-mediated apoptosis upstream of caspase-8 activation and/or that TNFR1 (but not CD95) prevents apoptosis induction by concomitant activation of NFκB.FIGURE 2TNF-induced cell death in NEMO-deficient and IKK2DN-overexpressing cells. A, cells were seeded in triplicates in 96-well plates and were stimulated the next day with the indicated concentration of TNF overnight.

In some experiments, very weak transient phosphorylation of JNK was observed in both Jurkat cell lines, suggesting that this early phase of JNK activation was too weak to allow regular detection (data not shown). Sustained JNK activation was also observed in wild-type and, to lower extent, in NEMO-deficient MEFs (Fig. 3). Likewise, there was robust and persistent activation of JNK in IKK2DN-expressing HaCaT cells but not in the corresponding control cells (Fig. 3). Early activation of JNK occurred in both HaCaT variants but was hardly detectable. Thus, in these cell types (Jurkat, HaCaT, MEF), TNF-induced persistent activation of JNK coincided with NFκB inhibition and cell death induction. Notably, this correlation was not found in KB cells. Sustained TNF-induced JNK activation occurred both in control and IKK2DN-expressing cells and furthermore required sensitization with CHX (Fig. 3). Moreover, in KB cells, which were protected against TNF-induced apoptosis by overexpression of Bcl2, sustained JNK activity and effector caspase activation were also absent (Fig. 4, A, C, and E) despite NFκB activation (data not shown). Thus, sustained JNK activation correlated in KB cells with TNF-induced apoptosis and caspase activation rather than with NFκB inhibition. Likewise, in HaCaT-IKK2DN cells, overexpression of FLIP-L prevented both cell death induction and sustained JNK signaling, arguing again for a relationship between apoptosis/necrosis and JNK signaling (Fig. 4, B and D). Many reports have shown that prolonged activation of JNK by the TNFR1-related death receptor CD95 is mediated by caspases (24Wajant H. Pfizenmaier K. Scheurich P. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2003; 14: 53-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). We have therefore next analyzed TNF-induced JNK activation in the presence of Z-VAD-fmk. Although TNF-induced persistent JNK activation was almost completely blocked in NFκB-compromised Jurkat, KB, and HaCaT cells, it was not significantly affected in both wild-type and NEMO-deficient MEFs (Fig. 5A). Early transient activation of JNK by TNF, which is observed similarly in control and NFκB-compromised KB and HaCaT cells, was also not affected by Z-VAD-fmk (Fig. 5A). Thus, at least in these cells, transient and sustained JNK activation by TNF are mediated by different caspase-independent and -dependent pathways. Our data thus argue against a model in which sustained JNK activation is the result of non-inhibited transient JNK activation.FIGURE 4Sustained (but not early) JNK activation by TNF is blocked in apoptosis-resistant transfectants derived from Bcl2-overexpressing KB and FLIP-L/IKK2DN-overexpressing HaCaT cells.

https://openalex.org/W1980125399,"Plasma membrane monoamine transporter (PMAT or ENT4) is a newly cloned transporter assigned to the equilibrative nucleoside transporter (ENT) family (SLC29). Unlike ENT1–3, PMAT mainly functions as a polyspecific organic cation transporter. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the unique substrate selectivity of PMAT. By constructing chimeras between human PMAT and ENT1, we showed that a chimera consisting of transmembrane domains (TM) 1–6 of PMAT and TM7–11 of hENT1 behaved like PMAT, transporting 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+, an organic cation) but not uridine (a nucleoside), suggesting that TM1–6 contains critical domains responsible for substrate recognition. To identify residues important for the cation selectivity of PMAT, 10 negatively charged residues were chosen and substituted with alanine. Five of the alanine mutants retained PMAT activity, and four were non-functional due to impaired targeting to the plasma membrane. However, alanine substitution at Glu206 in TM5 abolished PMAT activity without affecting cell surface expression. Eliminating the charge at Glu206 (E206Q) resulted in loss of organic cation transport activity, whereas conserving the negative charge (E206D) restored transporter function. Interestingly, mutant E206Q, which possesses the equivalent residue in ENT1, gained uridine transport activity. Thr220, another residue in TM5, also showed an effect on PMAT activity. Helical wheel analysis of TM5 revealed a distinct amphipathic pattern with Glu206 and Thr220 clustered in the center of the hydrophilic face. In summary, our results suggest that Glu206 functions as a critical charge sensor for cationic substrates and TM5 forms part of the substrate permeation pathway in PMAT.

Transporters from the same SLC gene family share at least 20–25% amino acid sequence identity and are thought to be evolved from a common ancestor (1Hediger M.A. Romero M.F. Peng J.B. Rolfs A.

Whereas it is generally anticipated that transporters from the same gene family possess similar functional properties, several SLC families appear to consist of members with great functional diversity (2Saier Jr., M.H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 354-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar, 3Wright E.M. Loo D.D. Hirayama B.A. Turk E. Physiology (Bethesda). 2004; 19: 370-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). For example, the Na+-glucose transporter family, SLC5, comprises not only Na+-coupled glucose transporters, but also transporters for iodide, choline, vitamins, and short-chain fatty acids (3Wright E.M. Loo D.D. Hirayama B.A. Turk E. Physiology (Bethesda). 2004; 19: 370-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar).We recently discovered an interesting functional divergence in the equilibrative nucleoside transporter (ENT) family, SLC29. The human and rodent genomes encode four SLC29 isoforms, SLC29A1–4. SLC29A1–3, known as ENT1–3, are nucleoside transporters that specifically transport nucleosides (e.g. uridine, adenosine, etc.) and their structural analogs (4Kong W. Engel K. Wang J. Curr. Drug Metab. 2004; 5: 63-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 5Baldwin S.A. Beal P.R. Yao S.Y. King A.E. Cass C.E. Young J.D. Pflugers Arch. 2004; 447: 735-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). ENT1 and ENT2 play important roles in nucleoside salvage pathways, regulation of adenosine signaling, and cellular disposition of anticancer and antiviral nucleoside analogs (4Kong W. Engel K. Wang J. Curr. Drug Metab. 2004; 5: 63-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 5Baldwin S.A. Beal P.R. Yao S.Y. King A.E. Cass C.E. Young J.D. Pflugers Arch. 2004; 447: 735-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). ENT3 is an intracellular nucleoside transporter, which may play a role in lysosomal transport of nucleosides (6Baldwin S.A. Yao S.Y. Hyde R.J. Ng A.M. Foppolo S. Barnes K. Ritzel M.W. Cass C.E.

The fourth member, SLC29A4, was originally identified as ENT4 and was expected to function as a nucleoside transporter (7Acimovic Y. Coe I.R. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2002; 19: 2199-2210Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, our recent cloning and characterization work clearly showed that SLC29A4 functions as a polyspecific organic cation transporter that transports prototype organic cations (e.g. 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+), tetraethylammonium, and biogenic amines) but minimally interacts with nucleosides or nucleoside analogs (8Engel K. Wang J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 68: 1397-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 9Engel K. Zhou M. Wang J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50042-50049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Because its typical endogenous substrates are monoamine neurotransmitters (e.g. dopamine, serotonin), we have proposed a functional name, plasma membrane monoamine transporter (PMAT), for SLC29A4 (9Engel K. Zhou M. Wang J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50042-50049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The substrate selectivity of PMAT is strikingly similar to that of the organic cation transporters (OCTs) in the SLC22 family (10Fujita T. Urban T.J. Leabman M.K. Fujita K. Giacomini K.M. J. Pharm.

Physiol. 2006; (in press)Google Scholar).The unique substrate selectivity of PMAT in the SLC29 family has brought up intriguing questions: why does PMAT behave so differently from the ENTs (i.e. ENT1–3) and is PMAT structurally related to the ENTs or to the OCTs? At the protein level, human and rodent PMATs exhibit a low overall sequence identity (∼20%) to the ENTs (9Engel K. Zhou M. Wang J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50042-50049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) (Table 1), which is on the borderline of classifying a transporter into a specific gene family. However, in the TM regions, sequence identity between PMAT and the ENTs significantly increases (up to 35–40%), and PMAT does not show significant sequence homology to other known gene families (9Engel K.

Moreover, PMAT and ENTs both possess an 11-transmembrane topology (9Engel K. Zhou M. Wang J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50042-50049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 16Sundaram M. Yao S.Y. Ingram J.C. Berry Z.A. Abidi F. Cass C.E. Baldwin S.A. Young J.D. J. Biol.

Tellez J. Ritzel M.W. Claycomb W.C. Cass C.E. Young J.D. Billeter-Clark R. Boyett M.R. Baldwin S.A. Circ. Res. 2006; 99: 510-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) recently showed that PMAT also transports adenosine at acidic pH. These data suggest an intrinsic relationship in protein structure between PMAT and the ENTs. In this study, we investigated the molecular determinants and structural elements underlying the unique substrate selectivity of PMAT in the SLC29 family.TABLE 1Sequence identity and similarity of PMAT with human ENTs and OCTs Open table in a new tab EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESSequence Alignment and Analysis—Sequences of mammalian ENTs and human OCTs were obtained from GenBank™ with the following accession numbers: hENT1 (AF_079117), rENT1 (NM_031684), mENT1 (AF_218255), hENT2 (AF_034102), rENT2 (NM_031738), mENT2 (AF_183397), hENT3 (AF_326987), mENT3 (AF_326986), PMAT (AY_485959), rPMAT (XP_001072979), mPMAT (NM_146257), hOCT1 (X_98332), rOCT1 (NP_036829), mOCT1 (NP_033228), hOCT2 (X_98333), rOCT2 (NP_113772), mOCT2 (NP_038695), hOCT3 (AJ_001417), rOCT3 (NP_062103), and mOCT3 (NP_035525). ClustalW and Vector NTI Suite 8 software were used for sequence analysis and multiple alignments.Generation of Chimeric and Mutant Constructs—To facilitate the determination of membrane localization, chimeras and mutants were constructed using yellow fluorescence protein (YFP)-tagged wild type (WT) PMAT and hENT1 as templates. The WT PMAT and hENT1 cDNAs (9Engel K. Zhou M. Wang J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50042-50049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) were subcloned into the YFP vector pEYFP-C1 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) using the BglII/XbaI and BglII/KpnI sites, respectively. To construct chimeras T1–6 and T7–11, an internal EcoRI site of hENT1 in the loop region between TM6 and 7 was used. An engineered EcoRI site was introduced into WT PMAT cDNA by site-directed mutagenesis, and chimeras were generated using a method described by Wang and Giacomini (18Wang J. Giacomini K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28845-28848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To generate additional chimeras with smaller replacement, an engineered site was introduced into both WT human PMAT and hENT1. Junctions in all chimeras were made within homologous regions. No foreign amino acid was introduced to any of the chimera constructs. For site-directed mutagenesis, mutants were generated using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) as described previously (19Wang J. Giacomini K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2298-2302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The sequence of each chimera and mutant was confirmed by DNA sequencing in the Department of Biochemistry at the University of Washington.Stable Expression in MDCK Cells—YFP-tagged chimera and mutant constructs were transfected into MDCK cells using a Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) method as previously described (9Engel K. Zhou M. Wang J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50042-50049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 15Xia L. Engel K. Zhou M. Wang J. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; (in press)Google Scholar). Stably transfected cell lines were obtained by culturing cells in minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and G418 (1000 μg/ml). Empty pEYFP-C1 vector was transfected into MDCK cells to obtain the control cell line. After 2–3 weeks selection, fluorescence-positive cells were purified by a FACS Vantage SE sorter (BD Biosciences) at the Cell Analysis Center at the University of Washington Health Science Center. The sorted cells were cultured and maintained in minimal essential medium containing G418 (200 μg/ml).Confocal Fluorescence Microscopy—To determine the cellular localization of YFP-tagged chimeric and mutant transporters, 106 cells were grown in two-well Lab-Tek borosilicated coverglass chambers (Nalge Nunc International Corp.) and visualized with a Leica Spectral confocal microscope equipped with a krypton/argon laser as the light source. Images were captured by excitation at 488 nm and emission at 610–640 nm.Functional Characterization in MDCK Cells—Stably transfected MDCK cells were plated in 24-well plates and allowed to grow for 3 days. Transport assays were performed at 37 °C in Krebs-Ringer-Henseleit buffer (5.6 mm glucose, 125 mm NaCl, 4.8 mm KCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) containing a 3H-labeled ligand. [3H]5-HT (5-hydroxy-[1,2-3H]tryptamine creatinine sulfate, 27.1 Ci/mmol) and [3H]dopamine (3,4-dihydroxy-[2,5,6-3H]phenylethylamine, 59.7 Ci/mmol) were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Inc. [3H]MPP+ (39.3 Ci/mmol) and [3H]uridine ([5,6-3H]uridine, 30.0 Ci/mmol) were from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc. (St. Louis, MO). Uptake was terminated by washing the cells three times with ice-cold Krebs-Ringer-Henseleit buffer. Cells were then solubilized and the radioactivity was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Protein content in each uptake well was measured using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) and the uptake in each well was normalized to its protein content. In all studies, cells transfected with an empty vector were served as a background control. Transporter-specific uptake was calculated by subtracting the background uptake in vector-transfected cells.Isolation of Plasma Membrane Proteins by Cell Surface Biotinylation—Confluent cells were washed twice with 3 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline/CM (pH 8.0). Biotinylation was carried out on ice by incubation with 1 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline/CM containing a membrane-impermeable biotinylation reagent NHS-SS-biotin (0.5 mg/ml). After two successive 20-min incubations on ice with freshly prepared NHS-SS-biotin and gentle shaking, cells were briefly rinsed with 3 ml of phosphate-buffered saline/CM containing 100 mm glycine. Cells were then incubated on ice with the same solution for 20 min to ensure complete quenching of the unreacted NHS-SS-biotin. Cells were then solubilized on ice by incubating in 400 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, protease inhibitors phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 200 μg/ml, leupeptin, 3 μg/ml, pH 7.4) for 1 h. Fifty microliters of streptavidin-agarose beads was then added to the supernatant to isolate cell membrane protein, which are subjected to Western blot using a mouse monoclonal anti-yellow fluorescent protein antibody (JL-8) (BD Biosciences) with 1:1000 dilution, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:20,000 dilution).Helical Wheel Analysis—The helical wheel was generated using the Wisconsin Package version 10.3-UNIX as described before (19Wang J. Giacomini K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2298-2302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The transmembrane domain is assumed to be a standard α-helix (3.6 residues/helical turn). Each residue in TM is plotted every 100° around the center of a circle. The projection of the positions of the residues was shown on a plane perpendicular to the helical axis. Hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity are assigned according to the consensus scale of Eisenberg et al. (20Eisenberg D. Wilcox W. McLachlan A.D. J. Cell. Biochem. 1986; 31: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).Data Analysis—All uptake experiments were performed in triplicate and repeated three times. Data were expressed as mean ± S.D. Statistical significance was determined by Student's t test, and the kinetic parameters were determined by nonlinear least squares regression fitting as described previously (8Engel K. Wang J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 68: 1397-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar).RESULTSFunction and Substrate Selectivity of PMAT and hENT1 Chimeric Transporters—Among all known human genes, PMAT only shows a low but significant sequence homology to ENTs (9Engel K. Zhou M. Wang J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50042-50049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) (Table 1). Multiple computer algorithms also predicted that PMAT possesses a similar membrane topology to the ENTs with 11 putative transmembrane helices, a cytoplasmic N terminus, and an extracellular C terminus (Fig. 1a). Based on these data, we hypothesized that despite the difference in substrate selectivity, PMAT and ENTs may share a similar tertiary structure and a similar arrangement of functional domains for substrate recognition and translocation. Earlier studies have suggested that the N-terminal half (TM1–6) of ENT1 and ENT2 contains critical domains for substrate/inhibitor recognition and translocation (21Sundaram M. Yao S.Y. Ng A.M. Griffiths M. Cass C.E. Baldwin S.A. Young J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21519-21525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 22Yao S.Y. Ng A.M. Vickers M.F. Sundaram M. Cass C.E. Baldwin S.A. Young J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24938-24948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). To test our hypothesis, we first constructed two chimeric transporters, chimeras T1–6 and T7–11, between human PMAT and the prototype human equilibrative nucleoside transporter, hENT1 (Fig. 1). Chimera T1–6 consists of the N-terminal half (TM1–6) of PMAT and the C-terminal half (TM7–11) of hENT1, whereas chimera T7–11 was constructed in a reciprocal manner (Fig. 1a). To monitor membrane trafficking of chimeric proteins, YFP was tagged to the N termini of both chimeric and WT transporters. After being stably transfected into MDCK cells, the substrate specificity of the chimeras were determined by uptake assays using MPP+ and uridine for the PMAT and hENT1 phenotype, respectively. YFP-tagged WT PMAT and hENT1 were expressed predominantly on the plasma membranes in MDCK cells. Tagging of YFP had little effect on substrate selectivity and kinetic behaviors of WT transporters (data not shown) (23Lai Y. Bakken A.H. Unadkat J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37711-37717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). As expected, cells expressing WT PMAT showed uptake activity for MPP+ but not for uridine (Fig. 1b). In contrast, cells expressing WT hENT1 transported uridine but not MPP+. Chimera T1–6 showed plasma membrane localization (data not shown) and behaved like PMAT, transporting MPP+ but not uridine (Fig. 1b). The PMAT-like substrate selectivity of chimera T1–6 strongly suggests that TM1–6 contains the key domains for substrate recognition and translocation in PMAT. The reciprocal chimera T7–11, however, was not functional due to intracellular trapping in MDCK cells as revealed by confocal microscopy (data not shown). Further attempts to make chimeras with smaller replacements were not successful, as all resultant chimeras were not functional when expressed in MDCK cells (data not shown).Selection of Candidate Amino Acid Residues for Site-directed Mutagenesis—To further identify regions and residues important for the substrate selectivity of PMAT, we employed sitedirected mutagenesis based on multiple sequence alignments. Because PMAT has been shown to transport a variety of organic cations (8Engel K. Wang J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 68: 1397-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 9Engel K. Zhou M. Wang J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50042-50049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), we proposed that negatively charged residues are important for its cation selectivity, particularly those conserved in PMAT orthologs but substituted by a noncharged or positively charged residues in the ENTs. Of the 33 glutamate (Glu) and aspartate (Asp) residues conserved in human and rodent PMATs, 13 residues were not taken into consideration because they are located in the very hydrophilic N or C terminus or the large intracellular loop linking TM6 and -7. Among the remaining 20 negatively charged residues, 10 showed charge differences from mammalian ENTs and were thus selected for mutagenesis. Fig. 2a shows an example of two selected residues in TM3 and TM5. In addition, we also performed forced sequence alignments of PMATs with human and rodent OCT1–3. Despite the low sequence homology between PMATs and the OCTs, there are 23 conserved residues. Among these residues, Thr226 in the OCTs was previously suggested to participate in the binding of organic cations (24Popp C. Gorboulev V. Muller T.D. Gorbunov D. Shatskaya N. Koepsell H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 1600-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). We thus included the equivalent residue in PMAT, Thr220, for mutational analysis. Together, 11 residues, Asp91, Asp107, Glu128, Asp154, Asp163, Glu206, Thr220, Glu227, Glu242, Asp336, and Glu375 were chosen as candidate residues. As shown in Fig. 2b, 9 of the 11 residues are located in the N-terminal half (TM1–6) and only two are located in the C-terminal half in TM7.FIGURE 2a, examples of multiple sequence alignment of PMATs (ENT4s) with mammalian ENTs in TM3 and TM5 regions. The residues Asp154 and Glu206 are conserved in PMATs (red) but are substituted with uncharged residues in the ENTs (yellow). b, positions of candidate residues selected for alanine substitution.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Analysis of Candidate Residues by Alanine Substitution— Alanine substitution was used to test the functional significance of the 11 candidate residues. YFP-tagged PMAT mutants (D91A, D107A, E128A, D154A, D163A, E206A, T220A, E227A, E242A, D336A, and E375A) were constructed and stably expressed in MDCK cells. The function of these alanine mutants was analyzed by uptake studies using PMAT substrates MPP+, serotonin, and dopamine. As shown in Fig. 3, mutation of Asp91 and Glu128 to alanine did not result in a significant change in transport activity. Mutants E227A and E375A were also functional and had a slightly increased (∼1.5–2-fold) transport activity. Mutants E242A and T220A exhibited reduced transport activity that was about 30% of the WT PMAT. In contrast, mutants D107A, D154A, D163A, E206A, and D336A completely lost transport activity toward all three tested substrates.FIGURE 3Uptake of organic cations by various PMAT alanine mutants in stably transfected MDCK cells. The uptake of 10 μm 3H-labeled MPP+, dopamine, and serotonin was measured at 37 °C for 1 min. Substrate uptake was corrected by subtracting nonspecific uptake in vector-transfected cells. Values are expressed as percentage of uptake in cells expressing wild type YFP-PMAT measured in parallel. Each value represents the mean ± S.D. (n = 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Cellular Localization of Alanine Mutants—The observed change in the uptake activity of an alanine mutant could be due to a change in intrinsic transport activity or an alteration of cell surface expression levels of the functional transporter. To distinguish these two circumstances, confocal microscopy was used to visualize the cellular localization of all tested alanine mutants (Fig. 4). For mutants D91A, E128A, T220A, E227A, E242A, and E375A, which retained full or partial transport activity, a predominant plasma membrane localization pattern was observed (Fig. 4). Mutants D107A, D154A, D163A, and D336A, which are not functional in MDCK cells, displayed altered cellular localization. D154A and D336A were localized intracellularly to perinuclear membrane network, indicating that substitutions with alanine affected PMAT trafficking to the plasma membrane. The other two mutants, D107A and D163A, showed diffused fluorescence throughout the cytoplasm, which was similar to the distribution of YFP. Western blot analysis revealed degraded protein products in cells expressing D107A and D163A (data not shown), suggesting that the alanine substitutions at these two positions may have affected protein stability. Most importantly, mutant E206A, which showed complete loss of transporter activity (Fig. 3), exhibited normal plasma membrane expression (Fig. 4). These data suggest that unlike D107A, D154A, D163A, and D336A, the loss of function in the E206A mutant is not caused by protein trafficking or stability problems, but rather is due to a defect in transport activity.FIGURE 4Confocal imaging of cellular localization of wild type PMAT, YFP, and various PMAT alanine mutants in stably transfected MDCK cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Role of Glu206 in the Interactions with MPP+ and Monoamine Neurotransmitters—To further investigate the role of Glu206 in PMAT interactions with cationic substrates, three additional mutants, E206Q, E206D, and E206R, were constructed and stably expressed in MDCK cells. All mutants exhibited plasma membrane expression patterns similar to that of the WT PMAT (Fig. 5a). Cell surface biotinylation followed by Western analysis with anti-yellow fluorescent protein antibody also revealed comparable membrane expression of the 75-kDa YFP-tagged fusion protein in all Glu206 mutant cell lines (Fig. 5b). Functional analysis showed that elimination of the negative charge (E206Q) or switching to a positively charged residue (E206R) resulted in complete loss of transporter activity (Fig. 6). In contrast, substitution of Glu206 with a charge-conserved residue (E206D) generated a fully functional transporter (Fig. 6) with similar transport efficiency toward various cationic substrates (Table 2). These data strongly suggest that the negative charge at position 206 is essential for the transport function of PMAT, and organic cation binding to PMAT may involve electrostatic interaction with Glu206.FIGURE 5Plasma membrane expression of Glu206 and Thr220 mutants as revealed by confocal fluorescence microscopy (a) or biotinylation followed by Western blot with an anti-yellow fluorescent protein monoclonal antibody (b).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 6Uptake of organic cations by Glu206 and Thr220 mutants in stably transfected MDCK cells.

https://openalex.org/W2163351284,"A wide variety of endogenous carboxylic acids and xenobiotics are conjugated with amino acids, before excretion in urine or bile. The conjugation of carboxylic acids and bile acids with taurine and glycine has been widely characterized, and de novo synthesized bile acids are conjugated to either glycine or taurine in peroxisomes. Peroxisomes are also involved in the oxidation of several other lipid molecules, such as very long chain acyl-CoAs, branched chain acyl-CoAs, and prostaglandins. In this study, we have now identified a novel peroxisomal enzyme called acyl-coenzyme A:amino acid N-acyltransferase (ACNAT1). Recombinantly expressed ACNAT1 acts as an acyltransferase that efficiently conjugates very long-chain and long-chain fatty acids to taurine. The enzyme shows no conjugating activity with glycine, showing that it is a specific taurine conjugator. Acnat1 is mainly expressed in liver and kidney, and the gene is localized in a gene cluster, together with two further acyltransferases, one of which conjugates bile acids to glycine and taurine. In conclusion, these data describe ACNAT1 as a new acyltransferase, involved in taurine conjugation of fatty acids in peroxisomes, identifying a novel pathway for production of N-acyltaurines as signaling molecules or for excretion of fatty acids."
https://openalex.org/W2075159439,"Salvinorin A, the active component of the hallucinogenic sage Salvia divinorum, is an apparently selective and highly potent κ-opioid receptor (KOR) agonist. Salvinorin A is unique among ligands for peptidergic G protein-coupled receptors in being nonnitrogenous and lipid-like in character. To examine the molecular basis for the subtype-selective binding of salvinorin A, we utilized an integrated approach using chimeric opioid receptors, site-directed mutagenesis, the substituted cysteine accessibility method, and molecular modeling and dynamics studies. We discovered that helix 2 is required for salvinorin A binding to KOR and that two residues (Val-108(2.53) and Val-118(2.63)) confer subtype selectivity. Intriguingly, molecular modeling studies predicted that these loci exhibit an indirect effect on salvinorin A binding, presumably through rotation of helix 2. Significantly, and in agreement with our in silico predictions, substituted cysteine accessibility method analysis of helix 2 comparing KOR and the δ-opioid receptor, which has negligible affinity for salvinorin A, revealed that residues known to be important for salvinorin A binding exhibit a differential pattern of water accessibility. These findings imply that differences in the helical orientation of helix 2 are critical for the selectivity of salvinorin A binding to KOR and provide a structurally novel basis for ligand selectivity.

More recently, S. divinorum leaves and extracts have been used as legal hallucinogens in the United States.

Salvinorin A is both pharmacologically and chemically unique in that it represents the first nonnitrogenous, naturally occurring KOR-selective agonist and the only known nonalkaloidal hallucinogen.

In fact, recent mutagenesis and molecular modeling studies have demonstrated that salvinorin A is stabilized in the KOR binding pocket via hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding interactions with Gln-115(2.60) and Tyr-119(2.64) in TM2 and Tyr-313(7.36) and Tyr-320(7.43) in TM7 (9Kane B.E.

FEBS J. 2006; 273: 1966-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Interestingly, most of the hydrophobic and hydrogen binding loci are conserved among KOR, DOR, and MOR, suggesting that there is considerable overlap in the salvinorin A binding pocket across all opioid receptor subtypes. This finding that salvinorin A utilizes conserved residues for binding fails, however, to explain the molecular basis for the exquisite subtype selectivity of salvinorin A. Based on these observations, it is tempting to speculate that receptor subtype differences in the orientation of transmembrane helices may preclude salvinorin A-receptor binding interactions in DOR and MOR. In the absence of direct crystallographic data, the substituted cysteine accessibility method (SCAM) has been used to provide structural information on residues that line the ligand-binding pocket of G protein-coupled receptors, including the D2 dopamine receptor (15Shi L. Simpson M.M. Ballesteros J.A. Javitch J.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12339-12348Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 16Shi L. Javitch J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In the present study, we utilized a combination of approaches to elucidate the molecular determinants essential for the subtype-selective binding of salvinorin A to KOR. To this end, we constructed an extensive series of chimeric opioid receptors wherein transmembrane segments and loop regions of the “salvinorin A-sensitive” KOR and the “salvinorin A-insensitive” DOR and MOR were exchanged in order to identify receptor domains involved in stabilizing salvinorin A binding interactions. The receptor subtype selectivity of salvinorin A was further examined using site-directed mutants of KOR and molecular modeling studies of the salvinorin A-KOR binding complex. We now report that TM2 and, to a lesser extent, the E2 loop of KOR are essential for the selective binding of salvinorin A to KOR. We also report that Val-108(2.53) and Val-118(2.63) in TM2 are critical in conferring the subtype-selective binding of salvinorin A to KOR. Most importantly, SCAM analysis of TM2 in KOR and DOR revealed marked differences in the water accessibility of residues known to be involved in salvinorin A binding. These observations are consistent with molecular modeling studies that predict a helical rotation of TM2 is critical for the subtype selectivity of salvinorin A. Materials—[3H]Diprenorphine was obtained from Perkin-Elmer Life Sciences (53 Ci/mmol). The standard reagents, unless otherwise stated, were purchased from Sigma. Salvinorin A was obtained from two sources, including the Salvia divinorum Research and Information Center (Malibu, CA) and Dr. Thomas Prisinzano (University of Iowa). MTSEA was purchased from Anatrace, Inc. (Maumee, OH). Cell Culture and Transfection—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1 mm sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen) and were grown in a humidified incubator in the presence of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Transient transfection (48 h) of wild-type, chimeric, and mutant receptor cDNAs was performed in 10-cm tissue culture plates using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) or EasyTransgater DNA/RNA transfection reagent (America Pharma Source) following the manufacturer's protocol. Chimeric Receptor Constructs and Site-directed Mutagenesis— The human KOR and MOR cDNAs cloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1+ (Invitrogen) were obtained from the UMR cDNA Resource Center (GenBank™ accession number AF498922 and AY521028, respectively). The mouse DOR cDNA (GenBank™ accession number L07271) was a generous gift from Dr. Mark von Zastrow (University of California, San Francisco). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange® mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Amino acids were labeled as described previously (14Shapiro D.A. Kristiansen K. Weiner D.M. Kroeze W.K. Roth B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11441-11449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 19Xu W. Chen C. Huang P. Li J. de Riel J.K.

The DOR (L110(2.65)C-A98(2.53)C) cysteine mutants were constructed using the wild-type DOR template, whereas the KOR (L120(2.65)C-V108(2.53)C) cysteine mutants were constructed using the MTSEA-insensitive C315(7.38)S KOR template. These cysteine mutants were subsequently subcloned into the pBabePuro retroviral vector (22Morgenstern J.P. Land H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 181068Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) for transient expression in HEK 293T cells. The incorporation of receptor mutations was verified using PCR-based, automated DNA sequencing (Cleveland Genomics (Cleveland, OH) and Biotic Solutions (New York, NY)). The generation of cross-subtype KOR-DOR and KOR-MOR chimeras was completed using an overlapping PCR-based method. For this cloning strategy, the DNA primers (Invitrogen) were designed with ∼20 nucleotides complementary to the KOR cDNA at the junction sites listed below and an additional ∼20 nucleotides of overhang that were complementary to the DOR or MOR cDNAs at the appropriate splicing site. The initial receptor fragments were amplified using PCR under the following conditions: initial denaturation at 95 °C (45 s) and then 30 cycles of 95 °C (45 s), 50 °C (45 s), and 72 °C (1.5 min), followed by a terminal extension at 72 °C (10 min); 100 ng of plasmid DNA, 0.75 μm each primer, 500 μm deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (Roche Applied Science), 1 unit of Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene). The resulting PCR fragments were purified from a 1–2% agarose gel using the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen) and combined for subsequent rounds of PCR. The ∼20 nucleotide overhangs allowed the KOR and DOR/MOR fragments to anneal to each other, resulting in the recombination of KOR-DOR and KOR-MOR cDNAs at the engineered splice sites. The annealed DNA fragments served as the template for the second round of PCR, which was completed as described above except that the first five cycles were completed in the absence of primers to allow for extension of the annealed KOR-DOR and KOR-MOR fragments. The resulting KOR(TM1–4,E2L)-DOR(TM5–7) chimera encoded amino acids Met-1 to Met-226 of KOR and Lys-214 to Ala-372 of DOR, and the DOR(TM1–4,E2L)-KOR(TM5–7) chimera encoded amino acids Met-1 to Thr-213 of DOR and Lys-227 to Val-380 of KOR. The KOR-DOR(TM1) chimera encoded amino acids Met-1 to Arg-76 of DOR (N-terminus to TM1) and amino acids Tyr-87 to Val-380 of KOR (I1 loop to the C terminus). The KOR-DOR(TM2) chimera encoded amino acids Met-1 to Arg-86 (N-terminus to TM1) and Tyr-119 to Val-380 (E1 loop to the C terminus) of KOR and amino acids Tyr-77 to Lys-108 of DOR (I1 loop to TM2). The KOR-DOR(TM4) chimera encoded amino acids Met-1 to Pro-172 (N terminus to the I2 loop) and Leu-196 to Val-380 (E2 loop to the C terminus) of KOR and amino acids Ala-163 to Val-185 (TM4) of DOR. The KOR-DOR(E2L) chimera encoded amino acids Met-1 to Val-195 (N terminus to TM4) and Lys-227 to Val-380 (TM5 to the C terminus) of KOR and amino acids Met-186 to Thr-213 of DOR (E2 loop). The salvinorin A-rescue chimera DOR-KOR(TM1) encoded amino acids Met-1 to Arg-86 (N terminus to TM1) of KOR and Tyr-77 to Ala-372 (I1 loop to the C terminus) of DOR. The DOR-KOR(TM1,TM2) chimera encoded amino acids Met-1 to Val-118 of KOR (N terminus to TM2) and amino acids Tyr-109 to Ala-372 of DOR (E1 loop to the C terminus). The DOR-KOR(TM2,E2L) chimera encoded amino acids Met-1 to Arg-76 (N-terminus to TM1), Tyr-109 to Val-185 (E1 loop to TM4), and Lys-214 to Ala-372 (TM5 to the C terminus) of DOR and amino acids Tyr-87 to Val-118 (I1 loop to TM2) and Leu-196 to Met-226 (E2 loop) of KOR. The MOR-KOR(TM2,E2L) chimera encoded amino acids Met-1 to Thr-103 (N-terminus to the I1 loop), Tyr-130 to Phe-206 (E1 loop to TM4), and Lys-235 to Pro-400 (TM5 to the C terminus) of MOR and amino acids Ala-93 to Val-118 (TM2) and Leu-196 to Met-226 (E2 loop) of KOR. The sequence of engineered receptors was verified using PCR-based, automated DNA sequencing (Cleveland Genomics (Cleveland, OH) and Biotic Solutions (New York, NY)). Radioligand Binding Assays—Forty-eight hours after transfection, crude membranes were prepared by scraping and triturating transfected cells in standard binding buffer (SBB) (50 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4), followed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min. The membrane pellets were immediately frozen and stored at -80 °C until use. Radioligand binding assays were completed in duplicate using 96-well assay plates, and reagents were added in the following manner: 100 μl of SBB, 250 μl of vehicle (SBB) or 2× test ligands (salvinorin A or naloxone) diluted in SBB and spanning 6 orders of magnitude from 0.01 to 10,000 nm, 50 μl of 10× [3H]diprenorphine (∼0.2 nm final concentration), and 100 μl of cell membranes diluted in SBB. Saturation binding assays were completed as described above using eight [3H]diprenorphine concentrations ranging from ∼0.02 to 2 nm in the presence or absence of 10 μm naloxone to determine nonspecific binding. The binding reactions were incubated for 1.5 h at room temperature and terminated by filtration through Whatman GF/C filters. Radioactivity was determined using a Beckman Coulter LS6500 scintillation counter. Substituted Cysteine Accessibility Method—These experiments were completed as previously described (19Xu W. Chen C.

Shi L. de Riel J.K. Liu-Chen L.Y. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8018-8029Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). KOR Modeling and Ligand Docking—Modeling studies were performed using SYBYL (version 7.1; Tripos Associates, Inc., St. Louis, MO). Initial receptor models described in this work are derived from our previously published KOR-salvinorin A interaction model (10Yan F. Mosier P.D. Westkaemper R.B. Stewart J. Zjawiony J.K. Vortherms T.A. Sheffler D.J. Roth B.L. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 8643-8651Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In order to explore the possible role of Val-2.63118 in our KOR model, an extracellular portion of TM2 (Met-112(2.57) to Met-121(2.66)) was rotated so as to position Val-118(2.63) to interact either with the ligand directly or with other nearby features of the KOR, particularly the E1 and E2 loops. Two separate rotations were applied to the extracellular portion of TM2 in our KOR model using a SYBYL Programming Language script developed in house. The overall rotation of this part of TM2 was performed as two separate rotations rather than one to prevent severe distortions at the TM2-E1 loop interface. For the first of the two rotations, an axis of rotation was defined by residues Ile-96(2.41) to Val-108(2.53) (Axis 1). Residues Met-112(2.57) to Met-121(2.66) were then rotated by -30.0° about Axis 1 (counter-clockwise when looking at the extracellular portion of the KOR from the extracellular space), positioning these residues closer to TM1 and reorienting the Val-118(2.63) side chain toward TM3. For the second rotation, an axis of rotation was defined using residues Met-112(2.57) to Met-121(2.66) (Axis 2). Met-112(2.57) to Met-121(2.66) were then rotated by -45.0° about Axis 2, such that the side chain of Val-118(2.63) was positioned between the binding site and the TM2-TM3 interfacial region. Upon completion of the rigid helix rotations, the side chain conformations of residues Pro-56 to Gly-73 on TM1 and Met-112(2.57) to Met-121(2.66) on TM2 were reassigned using SCWRL 3.0 (23Canutescu A.A. Shelenkov A.A. Dunbrack Jr., R.L. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 2001-2014Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). The model was then subjected to energy minimization using the Tripos force field incorporating Gasteiger-Hückel charges with a distance-dependent dielectric constant = 4 and a nonbonded cut-off = 8 Å to a gradient of 0.05 kcal/(mol × K). The resulting model possessed a helix irregularity in the helical backbone structure at Met-2.57112-Pro-2.58113, indicated by the ribbon backbone trace as rendered by the MOLCAD facility within SYBYL. The loop search facility within SYBYL was thus used to find a suitable replacement for the distorted section (Thr-109(2.54) to Thr-117(2.62), one turn above and below Pro-113(2.58)). The replacement sequence selected consisted of residues Leu-144 to Tyr-155 (including anchor regions; sequence homology to KOR sequence = 60%; root mean square fit to anchor regions = 0.12 Å) of the E chain of Protein Data Bank structure 1RP3, an all-helical RNA polymerase σ factor. SCWRL version 3 was used once again to assign side chain geometries to the newly substituted backbone, and the KOR model was energy-minimized under the same conditions as described above to generate what will subsequently be called the TM2-rotated KOR model. After minimization of the TM2-rotated KOR model, a helix irregularity once again appeared at Pro-113(2.58). A crystal structure (Protein Data Bank code 1U1I, residues Thr-1031 to Tyr-1043) was found that exhibited the same helix irregularity as the TM2-rotated KOR model (not shown), suggesting that this feature does occur. The automated docking program GOLD (24Jones G. Willett P. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1995; 6: 652-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 25Jones G. Willett P. Glen R.C. Leach A.R. Taylor R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 727-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (5465) Google Scholar) (version 3.0.1) was used to dock salvinorin A into the receptor site of the TM2-rotated KOR model. The CONCORD routine within SYBYL was used to assign initial conformations to salvinorin A. Genetic algorithm and annealing parameters corresponding to the 3× speedup option in GOLD were used, and 30 individual genetic algorithm runs were performed. A 20.0-Å radius about the Tyr-313(7.36) side chain oxygen atom was used to define the receptor site. Cavity detection and ring corner flipping were enabled, and the Gold-Score fitness function was used to rank the docked solutions. To explore the possible interaction of the cognate residue of Val-118(2.63) in the DOR (Lys-108(2.63)) and the MOR (Asn-129(2.63)) with the E2 loop, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed. Initial V118(2.63)K and V118(2.63)N KOR mutants were generated from the TM2-rotated KOR model by mutating the 2.63-position in silico. As in our previous work (10Yan F. Mosier P.D. Westkaemper R.B.

Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 8643-8651Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), the N terminus was removed, because it has been previously shown that the N-terminal region is not necessary for ligand binding to MOR (26Watson B.

For each KOR mutant, an MD simulation was performed for 100 ps using the default settings of the MD routine within SYBYL, except that snapshots were taken every 25 fs rather than every 5 fs. Additionally, the energy setup was the same as that described above for energy minimization. All residues except the E2 loop (Val-195 to Asp-223), Cys-131, and either Lys-118(2.63) or Asn-118(2.63) were maintained as an aggregate. For the models presented here, the PROTABLE facility within SYBYL was used to identify and adjust sites of unusual and sterically clashing side chain geometries. All molecular modeling was carried out on IRIX 6.5-based Silicon Graphics, Inc. workstations. Data Analysis—Statistical comparisons were made using one-way analysis of variance followed by Dunnett's post hoc analysis for comparison of mutant or chimeric receptors with wild-type KOR as indicated. Heterologous competition and saturation binding analyses as well as statistical comparisons were completed using GraphPad Prism 4.03 (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). Identification of Domains Essential for Salvinorin A Binding to KOR Revealed by Analysis of Chimeric Opioid Receptors— Our previous studies have demonstrated that the lipid-like hallucinogen salvinorin A selectively and potently binds to the peptidergic KOR, with no significant affinity for the DOR or MOR subtypes (5Roth B.L. Baner K. Westkaemper R. Siebert D. Rice K.C. Steinberg S. Ernsberger P. Rothman R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11934-11939Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). We took advantage of this selective binding profile to identify receptor domains involved in the subtype-selective binding of salvinorin A to KOR. To this end, a series of chimeric opioid receptors were constructed using an overlapping PCR strategy to combine transmembrane and loop segments of the KOR, DOR, and MOR (Fig. 1). All chimeras were expressed at moderate to high levels (0.74–64 pmol/mg protein) in HEK 293T cells and retained high affinity for the antagonist [3H]diprenorphine, which was used to label these chimeras in competition binding studies (Table 1).TABLE 1Affinity constants (Ki) for salvinorin A and naloxone binding to wild-type KOR, DOR, and MOR and cross-subtype chimerasReceptorKdaSaturation binding of [3H]diprenorphine for wild-type KOR, DOR, and MOR and cross-subtype chimeras was performed in transiently transfected HEK 293T cells.

When localized in the nuclear envelope, LPA1 signals transcriptional events by mechanisms not used when LPA1 is in the plasma membrane. In endothelial cells and hepatocytes, the LPA-nuclear LPA1 axis stimulates prominent transcription of proinflammatory proteins, including type 2 cyclooxygenase (COX-2) and inducible nitric-oxide synthase. However, constituents of the LPA1 nuclear signaling complex other than G proteins have not been identified, and it is unclear what elements regulate transcription initiated by LPA1 nuclear signals. Perhaps most importantly, it is not known by what pathways LPA synthesized principally extracellularly reaches nuclear envelope LPA1. In contrast, it is well established that the related lysosphingolipid sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is synthesized intracellularly, taken up readily by non-synthesizing cells, and capable of functioning as an intracellular messenger. S1P produced by mast cells and mononuclear phagocytes, but not T cells, is secreted into T cell corridors where it elicits and regulates T cell movements in lymphoid organs and chemotaxis in non-immune tissues as well as some migration-independent T cell immune functions (6Goetzl E.J. Rosen H. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 114: 1531-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 7Rosen H. Goetzl E.J. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 5: 560-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). The introduction of S1P into suspensions of T cells preincubated without S1P down-regulates plasma membrane type 1 GPCR for S1P (S1P1) for a few hours, without changes in mRNA encoding S1P1, after which S1P1 is re-expressed with full function (8Graeler M.H. Kong Y. Karliner J.S. Goetzl E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27737-27741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In contrast, T cell antigen receptor (TCR)-dependent stimulation of T cells evokes greater and more prolonged down-regulation of plasma membrane S1P1 as well as highly significant suppression of the level of mRNA encoding S1P1 (9Graeler M. Goetzl E. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1874-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The intracellular fate of T cell plasma membrane S1P1 down-regulated by TCR-dependent stimulation has not been examined previously. Our most recent findings indicate that TCR-mediated activation of T cells completely alters their pattern of responsiveness to S1P by both down-regulating plasma membrane S1P1, to limit effects of S1P on migration, and translocating most S1P1 to the nucleus where it couples principally transcriptionally to non-migration functions of T cells. Now we describe mechanisms of TCR-mediated sustained nuclearization of S1P1, the constitution of distinctive S1P1 signaling complexes in nuclear envelope membranes, attainment of functionally relevant concentrations of exogenous S1P inside T cells, and novel effects of the S1P-nuclear S1P1 axis on proliferation of T cells. C57BL/6 mouse splenic CD4 T cells were isolated at a purity of at least 96% by two cycles of magnetic bead immunoaffinity chromatography as reported previously (10Graler M.H. Huang M.C. Watson S. Goetzl E.J. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 1997-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Replicate 0.6-ml aliquots of purified CD4 T cells at 4-6 × 106/ml of complete RPMI 1640 medium with 10% charcoal/dextran-absorbed fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin in 24-well plates were stimulated with either 10-8-10-6 m S1P for 1 h or 3 μg each of adherent anti-mouse CD3 + anti-mouse CD28 antibodies (BD Biosciences) for 24 h as described previously (9Graeler M. Goetzl E. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1874-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). S1P1-null HTC4 rat hepatoma cells were stably transfected with human S1P1 containing an amino-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) peptide epitope tag using the Amaxa Nucleofection system (Amaxa, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD), designated HTC4-S1P1(HA) cells, and cultured according to standard procedures (11Graler M.H. Goetzl E.J. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 551-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Replicate suspensions of 0.5-1 × 107 HTC4-S1P1(HA) cells and CD4 T cells, without and after stimulation, were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.5 g/100 ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin and 2 mm EDTA, and resuspended in 0.1-0.2 ml of lysis buffer composed of 10 mm NaCl with 3 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH = 7.4), 1/100 HALT protease inhibitor mixture (Pierce), and 10 units/ml DNase I (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA) in a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube. Each suspension was homogenized with a Teflon pestle at 4 °C once using 20 strokes (T cells) or twice separated by 10 min at 4 °C using 40 strokes (HTC4-S1P1(HA) cells). Free nuclei were pelleted at 700 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, washed three times in lysis buffer with 0.1% Nonidet P-40 as well as HALT and DNase I, and further purified by centrifugation at 4 °C for 15 min at 1200 × g through 0.5 ml of 30% sucrose with 10 mm NaCl and 2.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). Some preparations of isolated nuclei were resuspended in 100 μl of lysis buffer with 1% Nonidet P-40 as well as HALT for direct extraction of nuclear proteins that contain immunoreactivity of the nuclear membrane markers nucleoporin p62 and type 1 lamin-associated protein (LAP-1) by Western blot analyses. Assays of the enzymatic markers acid phosphatase for lysosomes (Diagnostic Chemicals, Ltd., Oxford, CT) and 5′-nucleotidase (Diazyme Laboratories, San Diego, CA) for plasma membranes showed that routinely <5% of their total initial activities in intact cells were detected in the nuclei. This level of nuclear purity was confirmed by demonstrating the absence of the plasma membrane marker annexin II (12Lee D.K. Lanca A.J. Cheng R. Nguyen T. Ji X.D. Gobeil Jr., F. Chemtob S.

Replicate suspensions of purified nuclei from 0.5 to 1 × 107 T cells and, in some studies, 0.25-0.5 × 107 intact T cells then were resuspended in 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline with 10 units/ml DNase I, 0.1 g/100 ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, and 1 μm activated sodium orthovanadate phosphatase inhibitor; preincubated for 20 min at 37 °C; and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h without and with 10-9-10-5 m S1P followed by addition of 1/100 HALT protease inhibitor and cooling to 4 °C. Nuclear transcription factors in stimulated nuclei and cells were extracted with the Nu-PER kit for nuclear proteins (Pierce). Phospho-Erk ½ (P-Erk ½) and total Erk ½ in nuclear protein extracts were quantified directly using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits (Calbiochem-EMD Biosciences). Active (phosphorylated) c-Jun (P-c-Jun) was quantified by nucleic acid sequence-based Trans-AM AP-1 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA). Time course studies compared effects of S1P on transcription factors and other signaling proteins in intact cells and isolated nuclei after 1, 4, and 24 h at 37 °C. Some aliquots of isolated nuclei or intact cells were preincubated with the MEK inhibitors PD98059 (2′-amino-3′-methoxyflavone, IC50 = 2 μm) or SL327 (α-[amino[(4-aminophenyl)thio] methylene]-2-(trifluoromethyl)benzeneacetonitrile, IC50 = 0.2 μm) for 60 min, the protein kinase C inhibitor calphostin C (IC50 = 50 nm) for 60 min (all from BIOMOL International), or pertussis toxin (50 ng/ml) (List Biologicals, Carlsbad, CA) for 16 h prior to addition of S1P. Control and stimulated nuclei were allowed to adhere to glass slides, which had been pretreated for 30 min at 37 °C with 0.2 ml of 10 μg/ml poly-l-lysine (Sigma) and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, prior to fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde and immunostaining with antibodies to nuclear envelope markers, S1P1, and Gi/o proteins. Sources of purchased antibodies were as follows: mouse IgG1κ anti-phospho-Erk ½ (clone 12D4) mAb, Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions-Chemicon, Lake Placid, NY; rabbit anti-Erk 1 and anti-Erk 2, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA; rabbit anti-Giα½, mouse IgG2b anti-Giα1 and mouse IgG2b anti-Giα2 (used as a mixture), Chemicon International, Inc., Temecula, CA; mouse IgG2b anti-nucleoporin p62, Pharmingen-BD Biosciences; mouse IgG1 anti-LAP-1 and mouse IgG2a anti-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase p110γ, Abcam, Inc., Cambridge, MA; and mouse IgG1 (clone 5) anti-annexin II, BD Transduction Laboratories. Fifty-microliter aliquots of extracts of nuclear proteins from 107 T cells in a total of 100 μl of 1% Nonidet P-40 buffer were diluted 10-fold in 0.05 m Tris, 0.1 m NaCl with HALT (pH 7.6) and incubated with purified IgG of rabbit anti-S1P1 polyclonal antibody or monoclonal antibody to Gi and/or Go proteins in two different precipitation protocols for 1 h at room temperature and overnight at 4 °C. The first protocol was intended to saturate all complementary protein antigen in the sample with antibody and thus assure complete precipitation of that antigen, which involved 25 μg of purified rabbit anti-S1P1 polyclonal IgG antibody or 10 μg of purified mouse anti-Gi/o monoclonal antibody. The second protocol was designed for equilibrium binding of antibodies to a small percentage of S1P1 or Gi/o in the sample that would evaluate relative levels of association of other proteins in the receptor complex. This involved 0.5 μg of purified rabbit anti-S1P1 polyclonal IgG antibody or 0.2 μg of purified mouse anti-Gi/o monoclonal antibody. Then 120 and 25 μl, respectively, for the first and second protocols, of a 50% suspension of protein A-Sepharose (FastFlow, Sigma) was added to each suspension of receptor-antibody complexes followed by incubation at room temperature for 1 h and 4 °C for 4-6 h. After 400 × g centrifugation at 4 °C to pellet protein A-Sepharose adsorbent, the supernatant was removed, and the protein A-Sepharose was washed three times with 0.05 m Tris, 0.1 m NaCl with HALT and 0.1% Nonidet P-40 (pH 7.6). Membrane proteins extracted from 5 × 106 intact cells or their constituent isolated nuclei or removed from protein A-Sepharose by boiling in Laemmli SDS buffer were separated in a 5-15% gradient polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad), blotted onto a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane, and developed with polyclonal rabbit anti-S1P1 antibody, a monoclonal antibody to a G protein or other signaling complex protein, or one of the antibodies specific for a nuclear membrane protein as described previously (10Graler M.H. Huang M.C. Watson S. Goetzl E.J. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 1997-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). A horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit IgG light chain antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA) was used to develop blots of immunoprecipitates incubated with rabbit primary antibody to avoid obtrusive bands from the rabbit heavy chain. Fmoc Derivatization and HPLC Method—Replicate suspensions of 5-10 × 106 purified CD4 T cells in 1 ml of RPMI 1640 medium with 10% charcoal/dextran-absorbed fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin were cultured for 16 h without and with adherent anti-CD3 + anti-CD28 antibodies, as for stimulation to study nuclear redistribution of S1P1 GPCRs, and for 2 h at 37 °C without and with 10-8-10-6 m S1P. Cells were washed three times with 1 ml of Ca2+- and Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2 g/100 ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, and the pellets were frozen at -80 °C. Each sample received 1 ml of 1 m NaCl, was transferred to a glass test tube, received 1 ml of methanol and 0.2 ml of 18.5% HCl, and was mixed by vortexing. Two milliliters of chloroform were added, mixing was continued for 30 min, the tubes were centrifuged at 1900 × g for 3 min at room temperature, and the chloroform was transferred to a clean test tube. The extraction process was repeated, and the two chloroform layers were combined and dried in vacuo. Sphingolipids in all samples were derivatized in 0.2 ml of dioxane and 0.2 ml of 70 mm dipotassium hydrogen phosphate in water with 0.2 ml of 9-fluorenylmethylchloroformiate (Fmoc-Cl) prior to reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography. Fmoc-Cl derivatives of sphingolipids were detected by emission at 316 nm after excitation at 263 nm. Authentic standard sphingosine, S1P, and other lysophospholipids (Sigma) were used for determination of elution times and quantification of absolute amounts. All relevant labeled sphingolipids were well resolved, and the sensitivity limit of detection was 20 fmol. LC/MS/MS Method—Pellets of 5-10 × 106 CD4 T cells were Dounce-homogenized for 1 min at 4 °C in polypropylene microcentrifuge tubes with 25-50 μl of 80% acetonitrile. These homogenates were Vortex-mixed and centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C; this led to recovery of over 90% of total S1P in the supernatants for quantification by LC/MS/MS (13Schwab S.R. Pereira J.P. Matloubian M. Xu Y. Huang Y. Cyster J.G. Science. 2005; 309: 1735-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). The LC/MS/MS system was a Micromass Quattro Ultima equipped with electrospray source, Shimadzu LC-10 AD pumps, and Waters Intelligent Sample Processor 717 Plus. The column was BDS C18 (4.6 × 50 mm, 5-μm particle size, Keystone), which was eluted isocratically with 80% methanol, 0.1% formic acid, 1 mm ammonium acetate at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min for optimal sample resolution. The postcolumn flow was split 10:1 for a flow rate of 150 μl/min into the mass spectrometer. The instrument was operated in positive ion mode for monitoring elution of S1P with a multiple reaction monitor scan at 380-264 m/z (14Merrill Jr., A.H. Sullards M. C Allegood J. C Kelly S. Wang E. Methods. 2005; 36: 207-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). The cone voltage and collision energy were set at 30 V and 20 eV, respectively. The S1P-S1P1 Axis May Enhance or Suppress T Cell Proliferation—S1P is a primary growth factor for many types of cells, but we and others have observed that repetitive additions of 10-8-10-6 m S1P suppress the proliferation of T cells evoked by stimulation of the TCR complex with a combination of antibodies specific for its CD3 and CD28 components (10Graler M.H. Huang M.C. Watson S. Goetzl E.J. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 1997-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 15Dorsam G. Graeler M.H. Seroogy C. Kong Y. Voice J.K. Goetzl E.J. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 3500-3507Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Proliferative responses of T cells to such TCR-directed stimulation for 48 h were suppressed significantly by introducing 10-8-10-6 m S1P at 12, 24, and 36 h (Fig. 1A). In contrast, the addition of S1P once at the beginning of the incubation had no effect on T cell proliferation at 48 h (Fig. 1B) but did significantly increase proliferation transiently at 24 h to respective mean levels ± S.D. of 122 ± 11% (p < 0.05), 174 ± 16% (p < 0.01), 253 ± 34% (p < 0.01), and 219 ± 24% (p < 0.01) of control for S1P levels of 10-9, 10-8, 10-7, and 10-6 m (not in Fig. 1). When 10-9-10-6 m S1P was added only once after 24 h of TCR-mediated stimulation, suppression of proliferation after 48 h was significant at 10-8-10-6 m S1P but was not as great as when S1P was added serially (Fig. 1C). At 10-6 m, the S1P1-selective synthetic agonist SEW2871, which is ∼1/30 as potent as S1P, had proliferation-suppressing effects similar to 10-7 m S1P in each protocol. T cell activation is known to rapidly and nearly completely down-regulate surface expression of native S1P1 by a presumed process of endocytosis, which results in maximal intracellular localization of S1P1 within hours (10Graler M.H. Huang M.C. Watson S. Goetzl E.J. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 1997-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Thus suppression of T cell proliferation by S1P added at and after 24 h was assumed to be transduced by intracellular S1P1, which subsequently was shown to be nuclear S1P1, whereas transient enhancement of proliferation by S1P added at zero time was thought to be attributable to signals from plasma membrane S1P1. Membrane-enveloped nuclei therefore were isolated from unstimulated and TCR-activated T cells for characterization of nuclear S1P1, by methods applied previously to plasma membrane S1P1, and for successive studies of S1P-nuclear S1P1 signaling of T cell transcriptional events. T Cell Activation Translocates S1P1-Gi/o Complexes from Plasma Membrane to Nucleus—Isolated and dilute detergent-washed nuclei from unstimulated and TCR-activated T cells have intact nuclear envelope membranes as shown by the level and native distribution of the membrane pore protein nucleoporin p62 and retention of the LAP-1 of the inner nuclear membrane (Fig. 2, A and B). The absence of plasma membrane and granule proteins from the isolated nuclei was demonstrated by the only marginally detectable levels of 5′-nucleotidase and acid phosphatase and by the absence of annexin II (Fig. 2, C and D). The presence of S1P1 in isolated membrane-enveloped nuclei was shown immunocytochemically (Fig. 3A) where levels were minimally detectable in nuclei from unstimulated T cells and were substantially increased with patchy distribution in nuclei from TCR-activated T cells. The S1P1 complex-associated G protein component, Giα½, also was found in isolated membrane-enveloped nuclei with no apparent difference in staining intensity as a function of prior T cell stimulation. Loss of T cell plasma membrane S1P1 after identical TCR-mediated stimulation has been demonstrated (8Graeler M.H. Kong Y. Karliner J.S. Goetzl E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27737-27741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We therefore concluded that T cell activation results in translocation of plasma membrane S1P1 to nuclear membrane. A potentially functional association between S1P1 and Gi/o in nuclear membranes was suggested by results of saturating co-immunoprecipitation analyses. The amount of nuclear S1P1-associated total Gi/o, immunoprecipitated by anti-S1P1 antibody, was increased only slightly by S1P stimulation of the stable transfectants of rat S1P1-null HTC4 hepatocytes but was greatly increased in CD4 T cells by TCR-mediated activation (Fig. 3B, upper blot). Reciprocally nuclear Gi/o-associated total S1P1, immunoprecipitated by anti-Gi/o antibody, was increased slightly in the stable transfectants and moderately in CD4 T cells by stimulation of intact cells prior to isolation of nuclei (Fig. 3B, lower blot).FIGURE 3T cell activation-evoked nuclear localization of S1P1 protein. A, photomicrographs. Purified nuclei were isolated from CD4 T cells after incubation in S1P-free medium for 24 h at 37 °C (a-c and g-i) or on adherent anti-CD3 + anti-CD28 antibodies for 24 h at 37 °C (d-f and j-l) and then were stained with rabbit anti-S1P1 (a and d) or rabbit anti-Giα½ polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) (g and j). The right-hand frames (c, f, i, and l) represent merges of the images of antibody-stained nuclei (left-hand frames) and the 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) DNA-stained nuclei (b, e, h, and k). B, Western blots. Proteins extracted from isolated nuclei of 107 HTC4 rat hepatoma cells stably transfected with human S1P1 (H-S1P1) and incubated for 2 h without (-) or with (+) 1 μm S1P and from isolated nuclei of 3 × 107 mouse spleen CD4 T cells (CD4T) incubated for 24 h without (-) or with (+) adherent anti-CD3 + anti-CD28 antibodies were incubated separately with saturating amounts of rabbit anti-S1P1 pAb (25 μg) (upper blot) or goat anti-Gi/oα pAb (10 μg) (lower blot). One-tenth of the resulting immune complexes were absorbed completely by protein A-agarose, washed, resolved by electrophoresis, and blotted, and the complementary protein was detected by goat anti-Gi/oα pAb (upper frame) or rabbit anti-S1P1 pAb (lower frame).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further delineate the signaling proteins associated with nuclear S1P1, co-immunoprecipitation of only a fraction of total nuclear Gi/o or S1P1 was performed by equilibrium binding to limiting initial amounts of each precipitating antibody. As in the preceding total co-immunoprecipitation protocols that use antibody saturation, equilibrium binding to a limited amount of each antibody showed that TCR-mediated activation of T cells clearly increased both Gi/o-associated S1P1 and S1P1-associated Gi/o with much higher levels of both than in nuclei of S1P-stimulated T cells (Fig. 4). Anti-S1P1 also co-immunoprecipitated nuclear PI 3-kinase (p110γ) and P-Erk ½. Prior stimulation of T cells with S1P or anti-TCR antibodies only increased slightly the levels of nuclear S1P1-associated PI 3-kinase (p110γ). However, the increase in nuclear S1P1-associated P-Erk 1 (p44) was substantial and greater for TCR-mediated stimulation than for exposure to S1P (Fig. 4). As signals transduced by S1P1-Gi/o through Ras and Raf stimulate generation of P-Erk ½, which is coupled to cellular proliferation events, subsequent studies of nuclear S1P1 signaling mechanisms were directed to P-Erk ½ and its downstream factors. T Cells Establish High Intracellular Concentrations of Exogenous S1P—Intracellular concentrations of S1P were quantified in intact T cells without and after exposure to exogenous S1P to ensure that a meaningful range of S1P concentrations was used in studies of the signaling capacity of nuclear membrane S1P1-Gi/o complexes. The values of pmol/107 T cells (Table 1) were converted to molar intracellular concentrations by assuming that T cells are spheres with a radius of 6 μm and using the standard geometric formula to calculate T cell volume. Fluorescent labeling of sphingolipids in acidic chloroform-methanol extracts of unstimulated and TCR-activated T cells followed by HPLC resolution and quantification of labeled compounds did not detect any endogenous S1P, whereas a mean of 0.25 pmol of endogenous S1P/107 T cells (midnanomolar range) was found with the LC/MS ion-monitoring method in acetonitrile extracts of TCR-activated T cells (Table 1). After incubation of T cells for 2 h with 10-7 m S1P, both methods detected mean intracellular concentrations of 2.1-6.5 pmol/107 T cells (high nanomolar to low micromolar range), and incubation with 10-6 m S1P led to mean intracellular concentrations of 19-41 pmol/107 T cells (midmicromolar range).TABLE 1Levels of S1P in mouse T cells before and after prestimulation by anti-T cell antigen receptor antibodies and incubation without and with exogenous S1PPrestimulation (24 h)Exogenous S1PCellular [S1P]Labeling/HPLCLC/MS/MS−log Mpmol/107 T cells—0ND——74.0 ± 0.53.1 ± 1.1—628 ± 1341 ± 14+0ND0.25 ± 0.02+76.5 ± 3.52.1 ± 0.4+625 ± 3.519 ± 3.0 Open table in a new tab S1P Suppresses Levels of P-Erk and P-c-Jun in Nuclei Isolated from Activated but Not Naïve T Cells—Isolated membrane enveloped-nuclei were incubated for 1 h with 10-9-10-6 m S1P prior to extraction of nuclear proteins for quantification of P-Erk ½, total Erk ½, and P-c-Jun. Both P-Erk ½ and P-c-Jun were quantified with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method by their binding to adherent nucleic acid recognition sequences specific for the activated factors and then detection with labeled antibodies. S1P suppressed the level of P-Erk ½ in nuclei from TCR-activated T cells, which express S1P1, in an S1P concentration-dependent relationship that attained significance at 10-7-10-6 m S1P but not in nuclei from unactivated T cells lacking S1P1 (Fig. 5, A and B). The levels of total Erk ½/μg of nuclear protein were not altered by S1P in these or any other studies of T cell nuclei. As for P-Erk, levels of active P-c-Jun in nuclei from TCR-activated T cells, but not from unactivated T cells, were suppressed significantly by 10-7 and 10-6 m S1P (Fig. 5, C and D). At 10-6 m, the S1P1-selective synthetic agonist SEW2871 suppressed P-Erk ½ in nuclei from TCR-activated T cells by 57 ± 9% (p < 0.01) but increased P-Erk ½ in nuclei from unactivated T cells by 12 ± 4% (not shown in Fig. 5). S1P-Nuclear S1P1 Complexes Signal Erk ½ through Gi/o Proteins and MEK Kinase—The possibility that S1P suppression of nuclear concentrations of P-Erk is an active inhibitory process, which results from S1P-S1P1-Gi/o complex signaling through expected downstream members of the known MEK-mitogen-activated protein (Erk) kinase pathway, was investigated by applying two structurally different MEK kinase inhibitors known to reduce signaling by this pathway. At respective concentrations optimally inhibitory of MEK kinase, both PD98059 and SL327 prevented completely S1P suppression of P-Erk ½ in nuclei from TCR-activated T cells (Fig. 6). Both pertussis toxin and the protein kinase C inhibitor calphostin C also prevented S1P-S1P1 axis suppression of the levels of P-Erk in nuclei isolated from TCR-activated T cells at concentrations that had blocked elevations of P-Erk in intact T cells stimulated through their TCRs. In isolated nuclei from TCR-activated T cells incubated for 1 h with 10-8, 10-7, and 10-6 m S1P, mean P-Erk levels were not significantly different from those of the controls without S1P (100%) at 89, 112, and 122% whe"
https://openalex.org/W2053709123,"Rho-family GTPases have been implicated in actin remodeling and subsequent morphologic changes in various cells. DEF6, a pleckstrin homology domain-containing protein, has been reported to regulate Rho-family GTPases as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor. Here, we demonstrate that DEF6 also has the property of cooperating with activated Rac1. DEF6 bound selectively to Rac1 loaded with GTP. The interaction is mediated by the effector domain of Rac1. Overexpression of GFP-DEF6 together with constitutively active Rac1 in COS-7 cells significantly changed their cell shape; this was not seen in the absence of activated Rac1. This effect of DEF6 on cellular morphology was shown to be independent of its guanine nucleotide exchange activity. Because DEF6 does not contain any sequences previously known to interact with Rac, we explored the domain necessary for the binding. The amino-terminal portion and central parts of DEF6 were required for the binding. Finally, we succeeded in creating mutants of DEF6 with point mutations in the amino-terminal portion, which abrogate the binding to activated Rac1. These mutants did not exhibit the morphologic change in COS-7 cells when they were co-expressed with activated Rac1. These results suggest that DEF6 not only activates Rho-family GTPases but also cooperates with activated Rac1 to exert its cellular function. Rho-family GTPases have been implicated in actin remodeling and subsequent morphologic changes in various cells. DEF6, a pleckstrin homology domain-containing protein, has been reported to regulate Rho-family GTPases as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor. Here, we demonstrate that DEF6 also has the property of cooperating with activated Rac1. DEF6 bound selectively to Rac1 loaded with GTP. The interaction is mediated by the effector domain of Rac1. Overexpression of GFP-DEF6 together with constitutively active Rac1 in COS-7 cells significantly changed their cell shape; this was not seen in the absence of activated Rac1. This effect of DEF6 on cellular morphology was shown to be independent of its guanine nucleotide exchange activity. Because DEF6 does not contain any sequences previously known to interact with Rac, we explored the domain necessary for the binding. The amino-terminal portion and central parts of DEF6 were required for the binding. Finally, we succeeded in creating mutants of DEF6 with point mutations in the amino-terminal portion, which abrogate the binding to activated Rac1. These mutants did not exhibit the morphologic change in COS-7 cells when they were co-expressed with activated Rac1. These results suggest that DEF6 not only activates Rho-family GTPases but also cooperates with activated Rac1 to exert its cellular function. Morphologic change of cells is mainly mediated by remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton. Rho-family GTPases, which have been suggested to be a molecular switch of signal transduction, may play critical roles in this process (1Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5194) Google Scholar). They are active when bound to GTP and inactive when bound to GDP. Activation of GTPases is mediated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) 3The abbreviations used are: GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; DH, dbl homology; PH, pleckstrin homology; GFP, green fluorescent protein; RFP, red fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PIP3, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; CRIB, Cdc42/Rac interactive binding; WT, wild type. 3The abbreviations used are: GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; DH, dbl homology; PH, pleckstrin homology; GFP, green fluorescent protein; RFP, red fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PIP3, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; CRIB, Cdc42/Rac interactive binding; WT, wild type. and inactivation by their intrinsic GTPase activity, which is enhanced by GTPase-activating proteins (2Symons M.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2087) Google Scholar). After activation, they bind to specific effectors through their effector domains to activate downstream pathways (4Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1666) Google Scholar). Among the many GEFs identified so far, Dbl-family proteins represent the major class of GEFs for Rho-family GTPases. They share a catalytic domain, called the dbl homology (DH) domain, which is followed by a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain (5Schmidt A. Hall A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1587-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar, 6Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Sondek J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 167-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1308) Google Scholar). Def6, which was originally identified as a gene in a retroviral gene-trap assay, is expressed in myeloid progenitors but downregulated after induction of differentiation into macrophages, granulocytes, and erythrocytes in vitro (7Hotfilder M. Baxendale S. Cross M.A. Sablitzky F. Br. J. Haematol. 1999; 106: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). It is expressed at a high level in thymocytes (8Gupta S. Lee A. Hu C. Fanzo J. Goldberg I. Cattoretti G. Pernis A.B. Hum. Immunol. 2003; 64: 389-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Murine DEF6 (called SLAT for Swap-70-like adapter of T cells) was shown to play a role in T-cell receptor signaling as well as in the development and maturation of Th2 cells (9Tanaka Y. Bi K. Kitamura R. Hong S. Altman Y. Matsumoto A. Tabata H. Lebedeva S. Bushway P.J. Altman A. Immunity. 2003; 18: 403-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Recently, it was shown in a study with knock-out mice (10Fanzo J.C. Yang W. Jang S.Y. Gupta S. Chen Q. Siddiq A. Greenberg S. Pernis A.B. J. Clin. Investig. 2006; 116: 703-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) that loss of DEF6 (called IBP for IRF-4-binding protein) leads to the spontaneous development of systemic autoimmunity, suggesting a significant physiologic role of DEF6. However, the mechanisms underlying this phenotype have not been fully explored. DEF6 contains an EF hand-like domain in the amino-terminal portion, a PH domain in the central part, and an adjacent carboxyl-terminal coiled-coil region, which is also called as DH-like region. Although the region has no statistically significant sequence homology to the DH domain, DEF6 has been shown to exhibit GEF activity for Rho-family GTPases (11Gupta S. Fanzo J.C. Hu C. Cox D. Jang S.Y. Lee A.E. Greenberg S. Pernis A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43541-43549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 12Mavrakis K.J. McKinlay K.J. Jones P. Sablitzky F. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 294: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, the substrate specificity for GTPases remains elusive, and the relationship between DEF6 and GTPases has not been fully characterized. SWAP-70 is a protein that shows a high homology to DEF6. It binds to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) through the PH domain and exhibits GEF activity for Rac1 (13Shinohara M. Terada Y. Iwamatsu A. Shinohara A. Mochizuki N. Higuchi M. Gotoh Y. Ihara S. Nagata S. Itoh H. Fukui Y. Jessberger R. Nature. 2002; 416: 759-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Kidney cells derived from mice deficient in SWAP-70 showed impaired membrane ruffling. Recently, we reported that SWAP-70 directly binds to non-muscle actin through its carboxyl-terminal region, which is missing in DEF6, and that a mutant lacking that region behaves as a dominant-negative reagent for membrane ruffling induced either by stimulation with growth factors or by expression of constitutively active Rac1 (14Ihara S. Oka T. Fukui Y. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 500-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Furthermore, SWAP-70 binds to activated Rac1, suggesting that SWAP-70 not only functions as a GEF but also cooperates with activated Rac1. These results prompted us to examine whether DEF6 also can bind to activated Rac1. Here we demonstrate that DEF6 interacts with activated Rac1, and we determined the region required for the binding. Point mutants incapable of binding to Rac1 lost the ability to induce a morphologic change in cell shape, which is observed when wild type DEF6 is coexpressed with constitutively active Rac1. These results suggest that DEF6 has the property of cooperating with activated Rac1 in ways other than as a GEF. Cell Culture and Transfection—COS-7 cells and 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified minimal essential medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum under a 5% CO2 atmosphere. For electroporation of COS-7 cells, the cells were suspended in 500 μl of 30.8 mm NaCl, 120.7 mm KCl, 8.1 mm Na2HPO4, 1.46 mm KH2PO4, 5 mm MgCl2 containing 20 μg of DNA and were pulsed by use of a CELL-PORATOR (Invitrogen) at 800 microfarads capacitance and 235 V. For GTPase activation assay, COS-7 cells were transfected with expression plasmids by FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Introduction of DNA into 293T cells was done by the calcium phosphate precipitation method (15Tanaka K. Horiguchi K. Yoshida T. Takeda M. Fujisawa H. Takeuchi K. Umeda M. Kato S. Ihara S. Nagata S. Fukui Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3919-3922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Plasmids—DEF6 cDNA was obtained by reverse transcription-PCR of total RNA isolated from Jurkat cells by the acid guanidinium thiocyanate phenol-chloroform extraction method (12Mavrakis K.J. McKinlay K.J. Jones P. Sablitzky F. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 294: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) with 5′-aaagatctatggccctgcgcaaggaactgctcaag-3′ used as a sense primer and 5′-aagaattcctaattttctggtgctggatccagtt-3′ as an antisense primer. cDNA was subcloned into the BglII-EcoRI sites of the pEGFPC1 vector (Clontech). Point mutations were introduced by the method of Sawano and Miyawaki (16Sawano A. Miyawaki A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: E78Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). For deletion mutants, cDNAs encoding different segments were inserted into pEGFPC1. pRFP-Rac1 Q61L was produced by insertion of the coding sequences of human Rac1 with a substitution of glutamine to leucine at amino acid 61 (kind gifts from Dr. M. Matsuda) into pRFP, which was generated by substitution of the coding sequence of GFP of pEG-FPC1 with that of monomer RFP. pRFP-Cdc42 Asn-17 were generated by insertion of the coding sequences of human Cdc42 with a substitution of threonine to asparagine at amino acid 17 (kind gifts from Dr. K. Kaibuchi) into pRFP. Dominant negative human RhoA, with a substitution of threonine to asparagine at the amino acid 19 was generated by introducing point mutations into human RhoA Val-14, which was provided by Dr. K. Kaibuchi, and introduced into pRFP to generate pRFP RhoA Asn-19. Expression of RFP-Cdc42 Asn-17 and RFP-Rho Asn-19 was confirmed by Western blotting with anti-Cdc42 antibody (BD Biosciences) or anti-Rho antibody (Santa Cruz). An expression vector for human DOCK180 was kindly provided by Dr. M. Matsuda. His-DEF6 was constructed in the pQE-30 vector (Qiagen). Recombinant Protein Preparation—The Rho GTPase genes were subcloned into the pGEX4T3 vector to produce the expression vectors and were expressed in Escherichia coli cells, BL21. Glutathione S-transferase (GST), GST-Rac1, GST-Rho, and GST-Cdc42 recombinant proteins were purified through glutathione-Sepharose. Briefly, after induction of the proteins with 0.1 mm isopropyl-thio-β-galactopyranoside for 3 h, cells were harvested and sonicated in a lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 μm GDP. After removal of cell debris, the supernatants were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C for 30 min. After washing with the lysis buffer, GST or GST-fused Rho-family GTPases bound to glutathione beads were eluted with elution buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 500 mm NaCl, 0.1 μm GDP, 20 mm reduced-form glutathione, and 10 mm MgCl2 followed by dialysis against a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 20 mm KCl, and 5 mm MgCl2. His-DEF6 was expressed in E. coli SG13009 (REP4) cells and purified through His-Bind Resin (Novagen) loaded with nickel. The method of purification was similar to that for GST, except that His buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and nickel elution buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 250 mm imidazole were used for lysis of the cells and elution of the protein. Preparation of Anti-DEF6 Polyclonal Antibody—For construction of the expression vector, DEF6 cDNA (1513-1896 bp) was cloned into the pGEX4T3 vector (Amersham Biosciences) by use of the PstI site. DEF6 was expressed in E. coli BL21 cells as a GST fusion protein and purified through a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column. Two female rabbits were injected with the purified protein mixed with complete Freund's adjuvant. They received booster injections subcutaneously with the antigen mixed with incomplete Freund's adjuvant 2 times with an interval of 2 weeks. After final injection, the sera were obtained. Fluorescence Microscopy Analysis—After electroporation with appropriate expression vectors, COS-7 cells were cultured for 24 h. Cells were observed by fluorescence microscopy (Olympus). PIP3 Binding Assay—A PIP3-bead binding assay was done as described previously (17Shirai T. Tanaka K. Terada Y. Sawada T. Shirai R. Hashimoto Y. Nagata S. Iwamatsu A. Okawa K. Li S. Hattori S. Mano H. Fukui Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1402: 292-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with an anti-GFP antibody (Santa Cruz). GTPase Binding Assay—This was done as described previously (14Ihara S. Oka T. Fukui Y. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 500-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, GTPases were loaded with guanine nucleotides (200 μm) in a buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 40 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 4.7 mm EDTA, and 0.16 mm MgCl2 for 20 min at 30 °C. Then lysates from 293T cells expressing GFP-DEF6 or purified His-DEF6 were added and incubated in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol for 30 min at 4 °C. Beads were washed, and proteins bound to the resin were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-GFP or anti-DEF6 antibody. Rac1/Cdc42 Activation Assay—Measurement of Rac1/Cdc42 activity was performed as described previously (18Benard V. Bokoch G.M. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 345: 349-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Briefly, COS-7 cells transfected with various expression vectors were lysed with an ice-cold cell lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 200 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 5% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cell lysates were then centrifuged for 10 min at 16,000 × g at 4 °C. For a positive control lysate was incubated with 20 mm EDTA and 100 μm GTPγS at 30 °C for 10 min to load GTPases in the cell lysates with GTPγS. The supernatants were mixed with GST-PAK1 PBD (p21 Rac/Cdc42-binding domain) fusion protein immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads for 30 min at 4 °C. The beads were washed with the lysis buffer, and the bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with anti-Rac1 antibody (BD Biosciences) or anti-Cdc42 antibody (BD Biosciences). Expression of GFP fusion proteins and Myc DOCK 180 were verified by Western blotting with anti-GFP antibody (Santa Cruz) or anti-c-Myc antibody (Santa Cruz), respectively. DEF6 Is a PIP3-binding Protein—DEF6 has a PH domain highly homologous to that of SWAP-70, which is capable of binding to PIP3 (Fig. 1A). For testing whether DEF6 also binds to PIP3, DEF6 fused with GFP was expressed in 293T cells, and its binding to PIP3-analogue beads was examined. As shown in Fig. 1B, DEF6 bound significantly to the beads. The binding was blocked by preincubation of the protein with free PIP3, suggesting that the binding was dependent on PIP3. It has been reported that several amino acids in the β1/β2 loop of the PH domain are critical for binding to PIP3 (19Isakoff S.J. Cardozo T. Andreev J. Li Z. Ferguson K.M. Abagyan R. Lemmon M.A. Aronheim A. Skolnik E.Y. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5374-5387Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 20Ferguson K.M. Kavran J.M. Sankaran V.G. Fournier E. Isakoff S.J. Skolnik E.Y. Lemmon M.A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 373-384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). To explore whether the interaction of DEF6 to PIP3 is mediated by this region, we introduced mutations into the basic amino acid residues within the region to create DEF6 (K225A/R226A) and DEF6 (R230A/R231A) (Fig. 1A). These mutants were expressed as GFP fusion proteins and were examined for their PIP3 binding. As shown in Fig. 1C, these mutations abolished the activity. DEF6 Binds to Rac1 Bound to GTP—SWAP-70 selectively binds to Rac1 bound to GTP. We tested this with DEF6. We performed pull-down assays using GST-Rac1 loaded with GTPγS or with GDP or using GST-Rac1 free of guanine nucleotides on cell lysates of 293T cells that transiently express GFP-DEF6. As shown in Fig. 2A, DEF6 bound to GST-Rac1-GTPγS but not to GST-Rac1-GDP or GST-Rac1 free of guanine nucleotides. DEF6 did not bind to GST-Cdc42 or GST-RhoA even if they were bound to GTPγS. To exclude the possibility that the interaction is indirect, we tested purified recombinant protein, His-DEF6, in an experiment similar to that illustrated in Fig. 2A (Fig. 2B). His-DEF6 bound to the GTP form of Rac1 specifically, suggesting that the interaction is direct. DEF6 Cooperates with Rac1 to Induce Drastic Morphologic Change—For investigating the biological effect of the interaction of DEF6 with activated Rac1, GFP-DEF6 was co-expressed with a constitutively active Rac1 fused to RFP, RFP-Rac1 Q61L, in COS-7 cells. As shown in Fig. 3A, many of the cells underwent a significant morphologic change, showing multiple cellular extensions with branches, whereas GFP or GFP-SWAP-70 co-expressed with constitutively active Rac1 induced membrane ruffling. Expression of GFP-DEF6 in the absence of constitutively active Rac1 did not induce any morphologic change (right panel). Although the two proteins, DEF6 and SWAP-70, are homologous in most of their structures, it is likely that they are quite different in the way they contribute to cell responses. We then tried to explore the mechanism underlying the effect of DEF6 in cooperation with activated Rac1 on cellular morphology. DEF6 was reported to activate Rac and Cdc42 as a GEF (11Gupta S. Fanzo J.C. Hu C. Cox D. Jang S.Y. Lee A.E. Greenberg S. Pernis A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43541-43549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the possibility of whether GEF activity of DEF6 is elevated in the presence of activated Rac1 in vivo. The level of GTP-Cdc42 was measured in a pulldown assay with PAK1 CRIB in the cells that exhibit the morphologic change. As shown in Fig. 3B, the elevation of GTP-Cdc42 level was not detected in the cells expressing GFP-DEF6 together with GFP-Rac1 Q61L compared with that of the cells expressing GFP and GFP-Rac1 Q61L. Elevation of the level of GTP-Cdc42 or GTP-Rac1 was readily detectable in the lysate containing GTPγSorinthe lysate of cells expressing Myc-DOCK180, an activator for Rac (21Kiyokawa E. Hashimoto Y. Kurata T. Sugimura H. Matsuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24479-24484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 22Meller N. Merlot S. Guda C. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 4937-4946Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), confirming the assay was successful. Activation of Rac1 or Cdc42 was not detected in the cells expressing DEF6-(217-631) lacking potential autoinhibitory amino-terminal domain, which is inconsistent with previous report (11Gupta S. Fanzo J.C. Hu C. Cox D. Jang S.Y. Lee A.E. Greenberg S. Pernis A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43541-43549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This may be due to the difference of COS-7 cells maintained separately. To exclude the possibility that undetectable levels of activation of Cdc42 in the CRIB pulldown assay contributes to the morphologic change of the cells, dominant-negative Cdc42 fused to RFP, RFP-Cdc42 Asn-17, was expressed together with GFP-DEF6 and GFP-Rac1 Q61L. As shown in Fig. 3C, this mutant did not suppress the morphologic change. A similar assay for Rho was performed as well because it has been reported that DEF6 can activate Rho in vivo (12Mavrakis K.J. McKinlay K.J. Jones P. Sablitzky F. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 294: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The morphologic change was not inhibited by the dominantnegative RhoA, RFP-RhoA Asn-19 (Fig. 3C). Taken together, it is likely that generation of this cell shape change is independent of the GEF activity of DEF6. The Effector Domain of Rac1 Is Required for Binding to DEF6—It is a feature of an effector to bind to activated GTPases bound to GTP. Rho-family GTPases undergo a conformational change upon GTP binding, which results in exposure of the sequences called the effector region. It has been reported that several point mutations introduced in this region prevented the interaction of effectors to Rho GTPases (23Lamarche N. Tapon N. Stowers L. Burbelo P.D. Aspenstrom P. Bridges T. Chant J. Hall A. Cell. 1996; 87: 519-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar, 24Joneson T. McDonough M. Bar-Sagi D. Aelst Van. L. Science. 1996; 274: 1374-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 25Sahai E. Alberts A.S. Treisman R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1350-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). To examine whether this region of Rac1 is required for the binding to DEF6, we introduced mutations in this region to create GST-Rac1 F37A, Y40C, and N43D and tested for their binding to DEF6. As shown in Fig. 4, two of them, F37A and Y40C, failed to bind to DEF6, whereas N43D retained the binding ability. These results suggest that the binding property of DEF6 to Rac1 is similar to that of the known effector proteins for Rac. Two Separated Regions within DEF6 Are Required for the Binding to Activated Rac1—We determined the binding domain for Rac1 in DEF6. DEF6 contains no typical binding motif for Rac such as a CRIB domain. A series of deletion mutants of DEF6, each tagged with GFP (Fig. 5A), was expressed in 293T cells and examined for their binding activity (Fig. 5B). Truncation of the protein from the carboxyl-terminal end to amino acid 551 or 408 retained the binding activity to Rac1, although the latter exhibited very weak activity; however, further deletion of amino acid 315 abolished this activity, suggesting that the amino acids between the amino acid 315 and 407 are required. The binding activity was also lost when a small deletion was introduced at the amino-terminal end (DEF6-(41-631)). These results suggest that two separate regions in DEF6 are required for the binding to activated Rac1. We examined effect of these mutations on morphologic change of COS-7 cells. The mutant DEF6s were overexpressed with constitutively active Rac1. As shown in Fig. 5C, wild type DEF6 was detected throughout the cells, and clear cellular co-localization with RFP-Rac1 Q61L was not observed. Probably in vivo interaction of wild type DEF6 and activated Rac1 may be transient, resulting in failure of detection of the co-localization signal. DEF6-(1-407), the smallest mutant capable of binding to Rac1, caused morphologic change in COS-7 cells, as did wild type DEF6. In contrast, cells expressing DEF6-(314-631) containing DH-like region alone, which has been shown to have a GEF activity (11) but did not bind to activated Rac1 (Fig. 5B), did not exhibit the morphologic change but exhibited the membrane ruffling as is the case with the cells expressing Rac1 Q61L alone. In the case of cells expressing DEF6-(1-550), which showed stronger affinity to Rac1 compared with WT or DEF6-(1-407), the appearance was somewhat different from those of the cells expressing WT or DEF6-(1-407). Most exhibited the cell shape as shown by an arrowhead (Fig. 5C) in phase contrast image of 1-550, and some exhibited a similar shape as WT-expressing cells (arrow in phase contrast image of 1-550). Interestingly, dense signals of DEF6-(1-550) and Rac1 Q61L were localized very similarly in these cells (arrowheads in images of GFP and RFP). This may reflect the strong affinity of the DEF6 mutant to Rac1 Q61L. The different effect of this mutant on cell morphology might be explained by the strong affinity; however, the precise mechanism remains to be elucidated. Given the fact that DEF6-(1-407) lacking most part of DH-like region retained the ability to cause morphologic change, it is likely that the DH-like region for the GEF activity is not required for the morphologic change. Some Rac-interacting proteins without any known consensus sequences have been reported (26Westendorf J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46453-46459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 27Van Aelst L. Joneson T. Bar-Sagi D.

Abo A. Johnston C. Segal A.W. Hall A. Science. 1994; 265: 531-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). For determining what amino acids are required for the binding to Rac1 in DEF6, the amino acid sequence of DEF6 was aligned with those of the binding regions of other Rac-binding proteins. The central part of DEF6, which is required for the binding to Rac1, did not show any homology to the Rac-interacting proteins. However, amino-terminal region of DEF6 appeared to contain a stretch of amino acids weakly homologous to the Rac binding domain of these proteins (Fig. 6A). Point mutations were introduced in the conserved amino acids within DEF6 to produce R4A, L18N, and L31N/V33S (asterisks in Fig. 6A). GFP fusion proteins of these mutants were expressed in 293T cells, and the lysate was analyzed by pulldown assay with GST Rac1. As expected, the binding activity to GST-Rac1 loaded with GTP was lost in L18N and L31N/V33S, whereas weak activity remained in R4A (Fig. 6, B and C). The Mutant Incapable of Binding to Activated Rac1 Did Not Cause Morphologic Change—To see the significance of the binding of DEF6 to activated Rac1 on its cellular function, point mutants L18N and L31N/V33S fused with GFP were co-expressed with RFP-Rac1 Q61L. The cells exhibited membrane ruffling instead of the drastic morphologic change seen in cells expressing GFP-DEF6 with RFP-Rac1 Q61L (Fig. 7). Because the RFP-Rac1 Q61L expression alone results in membrane ruffling, it is likely that the point mutants are not able to induce a morphologic change and that only the effect of RFP-Rac1 Q61L was expressed by the cells. These results suggest that morphologic change of the cells induced by coexpression of DEF6 and constitutively active Rac1 is dependent on their direct interaction. DEF6 has been reported to be an upstream activator of Rho-family GTPases (11Gupta S. Fanzo J.C. Hu C. Cox D. Jang S.Y. Lee A.E. Greenberg S. Pernis A.B. J. Biol.

Lee A.E. Greenberg S. Pernis A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43541-43549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), DEF6 was implicated in activating all three of the members of GTPases, judging from observation of the cells overexpressing a truncated mutant of DEF6 (12Mavrakis K.J. McKinlay K.J. Jones P. Sablitzky F. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 294: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, a precise examination of nucleotide preference in the binding of DEF6 to Rac1 has not been carried out. In this study we performed a pulldown assay with GTP-loaded Rac1, GDP-loaded Rac1, or with Rac1 free of nucleotide. DEF6 selectively binds to the activated Rac1 loaded with GTP. Our results suggest that DEF6 cooperates with activated Rac1 to exert its cellular function in some cases. Supporting this idea, overexpression of GFP-DEF6 together with activated Rac1 induced profound changes in cell morphology, which is not observed in the absence of activated Rac1. Several lines of evidence suggest that this effect is likely to be independent of the GEF activity of DEF6. Activation of Cdc42 was not detected in COS-7 cells that exhibit morphologic change and dominant negative Cdc42, or Rho did not suppress the effect. DEF6 mutants lacking most of the DH-like domain still induced the morphologic change as long as the protein maintained the Rac1 binding activity. Finally, we confirmed that the direct interaction of DEF6 and activated Rac1 was required for this morphologic change by using mutant DEF6s harboring point mutations, which abrogated the ability to bind to Rac1. Many proteins have been reported to interact with activated Rac1 (4Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1666) Google Scholar, 31Burridge K. Wennerberg K. Cell. 2004; 116: 167-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1502) Google Scholar). Whereas most of these proteins contain a conserved motif for the binding to Rac1 such as a CRIB domain (32Burbelo P.D. Drechsel D. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29071-29074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar), several proteins do not have any sequences showing homology with each other. In our search for amino acids critical for the binding to Rac1 in DEF6, we found that several amino acids were conserved among the Rac-interacting proteins. Because the introduction of a mutation into these positions abrogated the binding activity at least to some extent in DEF6, these conserved amino acids can be required for binding in the case of the other Rac-interacting proteins. Further exploration will be needed for testing this idea. On the other hand, the effector domain of Rac1 may be required for the binding to DEF6 because F37A and Y40C of Rac1, among the several effector-domain mutants, failed to bind to DEF6. Previous reports showed that several known effector proteins for Rac failed to bind to Rac carrying the mutations F37A or Y40C. For example, Rac1 F37A did not bind to p160Rock, and Rac1 Y40C did not bind to PAK (23Lamarche N. Tapon N. Stowers L. Burbelo P.D. Aspenstrom P. Bridges T. Chant J. Hall A. Cell. 1996; 87: 519-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar, 33Westwick J.K. Lambert Q.T. Clark G.J. Symons M. Aelst L.Van Pestell R.G. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1324-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). In our previous study, SWAP-70 failed to bind to Rac1 F37A or Rac1 Y40C, which was also the case for DEF6 (14Ihara S. Oka T. Fukui Y. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 500-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These results suggest the possibility that these proteins use the same region of Rac1 as the binding site. One would argue that the morphologic change in the cells by the combination of activated Rac1 and DEF6 is the result of Rac signaling without the signals produced by the proteins that bind to Phe-37 or Tyr-40 due to blockage by the overexpressed DEF6. However, the finding that Rac1 Q61L/F37A or Rac1 Q61L/Y40C, which would mediate such unbalanced signaling, did not induce the morphologic change (data not shown) argues against this hypothesis. Therefore, it is likely that DEF6 creates some positive signals that induce the morphologic change. DEF6 exhibits 45% sequence homology with SWAP-70. In particular, the PH domain is highly homologous to that of SWAP-70, suggesting that they have a similar function. Indeed, DEF6 also binds to PIP3 in vitro (Fig. 1). The binding activity of the PH domain of DEF6 to PIP3 has been examined previously (11Gupta S. Fanzo J.C. Hu C. Cox D. Jang S.Y. Lee A.E. Greenberg S. Pernis A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43541-43549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The investigators described that DEF6 binds to PIP3 only when it is phosphorylated. In our study DEF6 expressed in 293T cells showed PIP3 binding activity which they failed to detect. The difference might be caused by the sensitivity of the binding assay with phosphoinositide beads. It is possible that phosphorylated DEF6 binds to PIP3 even more strongly than does the unphosphorylated DEF6 in our assay. SWAP-70 has also been shown to bind to activated Rac1. However, the phenotype of the cells expressing DEF6 together with constitutively active Rac1 was different from that of the cells expressing SWAP-70 and the activated Rac1. In SWAP-70/Rac1 Q61L-expressing cells, membrane ruffling was induced, as in the case of Rac1 Q61L-expressing cells. On the other hand, DEF6/Rac1 Q61L-expressing cells exhibited a prominent morphologic change. As described above, the mechanism underlying this change is likely to be independent of the GEF activity. According to the previous report, wild type DEF6 exhibited the GEF activity only when it was tyrosine-phosphorylated (11Gupta S. Fanzo J.C. Hu C. Cox D. Jang S.Y. Lee A.E. Greenberg S. Pernis A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43541-43549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We found that DEF6 is not phosphorylated in our experimental conditions (data not shown). Therefore, DEF6 may not be active as a GEF. It is not surprising that GEF activity is not involved in the morphologic change. It is not unusual that a GEF functions in a GEF activity-independent manner. For example, Vav1, a member of Dbl family GEF, has been reported to be involved in transcriptional activation (34Kuhne M.R. Ku G. Weiss A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2185-2190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) or cell spreading (35del Pozo M.A. Schwartz M.A. Hu J. Kiosses W.B. Altman A. Villalba M. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) in a GEF activity-independent manner, although the mechanism of how it functions remained open. One possible mechanism explaining the effect of DEF6 on cell shape change is that it mediates this change by acting directly to cytoskeletal proteins. Whereas SWAP-70 has the F-actin binding domain in its carboxyl-terminal region and exhibits binding activity specific for non-muscle actin, DEF6 does not have corresponding sequences. However, it has been reported that DEF6 has F-actin binding activity (12Mavrakis K.J. McKinlay K.J. Jones P. Sablitzky F. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 294: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), which does not seem to be specific for non-muscle actin. The different F-actin binding property might contribute to these differential effects of constitutively active Rac1-expressing cells. Future exploration will be needed for substantiating this hypothesis. Recently, DEF6 has been shown to play a role in the prevention of systemic autoimmunity (10Fanzo J.C. Yang W. Jang S.Y. Gupta S. Chen Q. Siddiq A. Greenberg S. Pernis A.B. J. Clin. Investig. 2006; 116: 703-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Mice deficient in DEF6 developed autoimmunity and lupus-like disease. Given that the phenotypes characteristic for the disease observed in these mice are divergent, it is unlikely that DEF6 has a sole function as a GEF. To understand the mechanism underlying the development of the disease, it would be helpful to further investigate the novel aspect of DEF6 cooperating with activated Rac."

Alternatively, ketonization of 3 can result in chloride loss and the formation of the enol intermediate, 6, which tautomerizes to afford 5. The two enzymes are found in bacterial pathways that convert the cis- and trans-isomers of 1,3-dichloropropene, used as nematocides, to acetaldehyde (7) and carbon dioxide (6Poelarends G.J. Wilkens M. Larkin M.J. van Elsas J.D. Janssen D.B. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 2931-2936Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cis- and trans-3-chloroacrylic acid dehalogenases have low sequence identity (∼20%) and different oligomerization states (1Poelarends G.J. Serrano H. Person M.D. Johnson Jr, W.H. Murzin A.G.

CaaD is a heterohexamer consisting of three 75-residue α-chains and three 70-residue β-chains, whereas cis-CaaD forms a homotrimer of three identical 149-residue polypeptide chains, which can be considered as the fusion product of a CaaD α- and β-chain (2Poelarends G.J.

Chem. 2004; 279: 11546-11552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). As a result, the two enzymes have been classified in two different families in the tautomerase superfamily, with each being related to 4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase (7Murzin A.G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 386-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 8Whitman C.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 402: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 9Poelarends G.J. Whitman C.P. Bioorg. Chem. 2004; 32: 376-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Yet, the differences in catalytic efficiency are only modest, and major elements of the catalytic mechanisms are conserved. In both, a glutamate residue (Glu-114 in cis-CaaD and αGlu-52 in CaaD) is proposed to function as a general base catalyst to activate a water molecule for attack at C3 (of 1 or 2) and the N-terminal proline (Pro-1 in cis-CaaD and βPro-1 in CaaD) is believed to provide a proton at C2. Two arginine residues (Arg-70 and Arg-73 in cis-CaaD and αArg-8 and αArg-11 in CaaD) are proposed to interact with the C1 carboxylate group, aligning the substrate in the active site and drawing electron density away from C3 (1Poelarends G.J.

Chem. 2004; 279: 11546-11552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Such an interaction would generate a partial positive charge at C3 and facilitate the addition of water. The conservation of key functionalities suggests that the two enzymes are related by divergent evolution from a common ancestor. Nevertheless, recent kinetic and mechanistic work has uncovered two subtle differences. First, the activation of the water molecule likely requires additional residues in cis-CaaD (1Poelarends G.J. Serrano H. Person M.D. Johnson Jr, W.H. Murzin A.G. Whitman C.P. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 759-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Mutation of Glu-114 to a glutamine produces a partially active mutant protein, whereas the αE52Q mutant of CaaD has no detectable activity, even after a prolonged incubation period. Second, only cis-CaaD is irreversibly inhibited by the (R)-oxirane-2-carboxylate (8) due to covalent modification of Pro-1 (10Poelarends G.J. Serrano H. Person M.D. Johnson Jr, W.H. Whitman C.P. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 7187-7196Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The (S)-enantiomer is a weak competitive inhibitor of cis-CaaD and both enantiomers competitively inhibit CaaD (10Poelarends G.J. Serrano H. Person M.D. Johnson Jr, W.H. Whitman C.P. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 7187-7196Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) (Structure 1). To delineate the structural basis for the isomer-specific dehalogenation reaction and the stereospecificity of the inactivation reaction, crystal structures of the native cis-CaaD and cis-CaaD inactivated by (R)-8 were obtained. They confirm the trimeric nature of cis-CaaD and pinpoint the roles of Pro-1, Arg-70, Arg-73, and Glu-114. The assisting roles of His-28 and Tyr-103′ in activation of, respectively, the substrate and nucleophilic water molecule for catalysis, suggested by the structures, are supported by site-directed mutagenesis. It can also be inferred that His-28 plays a central role in positioning (R)-8 for alkylation of Pro-1 and, along with Tyr-103′, is a determinant of the substrate specificity of the enzyme. The crystallographic observations fully support the proposal that cis-CaaD and CaaD form two separate evolutionary lineages that followed the independent duplication of a 4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase-like sequence. Materials—All reagents, buffers, and solvents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, Fisher Scientific, Spectrum Laboratory Products (New Brunswick, NJ), or EM Science (Cincinnati, OH), unless noted otherwise. A literature procedure was used for the synthesis of (R)-8 (11Petit Y. Larcheveque M. Organic Syntheses. 1998; 75: 37-44Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The sources for the components of Luria-Bertani media, the enzymes and reagents used in the molecular biology procedures, and the strains used for cloning and overproducing cis-CaaD and the mutant proteins have been reported elsewhere (1Poelarends G.J.

General Enzymology Methods—General procedures for cloning and DNA manipulation were performed as described elsewhere (12Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The wild-type cis-CaaD and the mutant proteins were purified to homogeneity, as assessed by SDS-PAGE, according to a published procedure (1Poelarends G.J. Serrano H. Person M.D. Johnson Jr, W.H.

Protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE on gels containing 15% polyacrylamide (13Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207192) Google Scholar). The gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Waddell (14Waddell W.J. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1956; 48: 311-314PubMed Google Scholar). The native molecular masses of the mutant proteins were determined by gel filtration on a Superose 12 column (Amersham Biosciences) using the Waters 501/510 high-pressure liquid chromatography system. Crystallization and Structure Determination of Inactivated cis-CaaD—cis-CaaD was covalently inactivated by incubating the enzyme with a 25-fold excess of (R)-8 for 4 h, after diluting the protein solution to 0.5 mg/ml to prevent overheating. Crystals of inactivated cis-CaaD were obtained from 2-μl hanging drops consisting of equal amounts of protein solution (10 mg/ml) and well solution containing 1.6 m potassium sodium phosphate and 100 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.5. Thin hexagonal shaped crystals of 1.5 μm grew in a few days. A diffraction data set to 2.1-Å resolution was collected inhouse on a MacScience image plate system using CuKα radiation from a rotating anode generator. The data were processed using DENZO and SCALEPACK (15Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38570) Google Scholar). The crystals belong to the space group P63 with cell constants a = b = 59.5 Å, and c = 57.9 Å. The asymmetric unit contains one monomer of 149 residues, of which the 22 C-terminal residues were not resolved in the electron density map. Molecular replacement solutions were obtained with the program AMORE available in CCP4 (16Navaza J. Saludjian P. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 581-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 17Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19765) Google Scholar). A search model was constructed using the atomic coordinates of one heterodimer subunit (composed of an α and a β chain) from the Pseudomonas pavonaceae 170 heterohexameric CaaD (PDB code 1S0Y) (5de Jong R.M. Brugman W. Poelarends G.J. Whitman C.P. Dijkstra B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11546-11552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). All residues were changed to alanines except for the proline and glycine residues. Rotation and translation functions were calculated using the data between 10- and 4-Å resolution. The molecular replacement yielded the position and orientation of a single monomer in the asymmetric unit. Refinement of the solutions by AMORE gave a correlation coefficient of 0.19 and an R-factor of 43.6%. The electron-density maps at this stage were not interpretable, but density was observed extending from some alanines of the search model. A σA-weighted map (18Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1986; 42: 140-149Crossref Scopus (2036) Google Scholar) calculated from the refined solutions from AMORE was used in a density-modification and phase-extension procedure using the prime-and-switch method available in the program RESOLVE (19Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1763-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This improved the overall figure of merit from 0.24, after calculation of the starting map, to 0.52 in the final cycle of the density modification procedure. The resulting σA-weighted maps from RESOLVE showed improved electron density for the amino acid side chains and allowed identification of the N-terminal proline residue in the monomer of cis-CaaD. Manual building of side chains and missing main-chain atoms were subsequently alternated with simulated annealing and minimization runs in CNX (Accelrys Inc.). The program RESOLVE was used to obtain the most unbiased maps for model building, until σA-weighted 2Fo – Fc maps were of superior quality. The structure was built using QUANTA (Accelrys Inc.) and XtalView (20McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2021) Google Scholar). Coordinates for the covalent adduct were based on 2-hydroxypropanoate and minimized in QUANTA (Accelrys Inc.), and its parameters were generated using the Hic-Up server (21Kjeldgaard M. Jones T.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 1119-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). The quality of the final model was analyzed with PROCHECK (22Laskowski R.A.

Open table in a new tab Crystallization and Structure Determination of Native cis-CaaD—Crystals of native cis-CaaD were obtained from 2-μl hanging drops consisting of equal amounts of protein solution (10 mg/ml) and well solution containing 10% (v/v) 2-propanol, as a precipitant, 100 mm phosphate-citrate buffer, pH 4.2, and 0.2 m Li2SO4. Cubes of 0.1 mm3 grew within a few days. A diffraction data set to 2.75-Å resolution was collected at the ID14-2 beamline at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble, France. The data were processed using DENZO and SCALEPACK (15Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38570) Google Scholar). The crystal belonged to the space group P213 with cell parameters a = b = c = 141.4 Å. The asymmetric unit contains three monomers made up of 149 residues each. Short segments (2–3 residues) of the C termini were not resolved in the electron-density map. Molecular replacement solutions were obtained with the program AMORE available in CCP4 (16Navaza J. Saludjian P. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 581-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 17Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19765) Google Scholar). A search model was constructed from the atomic coordinates of a cis-CaaD monomer inactivated by (R)-8 with the coordinates of the covalent adduct removed. Rotation and translation functions were calculated using data between 15- and 3-Å resolution. The molecular replacement yielded the position and orientation of three monomers in the asymmetric unit. Refinement of the solutions by AMORE (16Navaza J. Saludjian P. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 581-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 17Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Electron-density maps were further improved using the program DM available in CCP4 (17Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

A summary of the refinement statistics and geometric quality of the models is given in Table 1. Docking of 1 and 2 in the active sites of cis-CaaD and CaaD, respectively, was carried out manually using the program XtalView (20McRee D.E. J. Struct.

Construction, Expression, and Characterization of the H28A, Y103F, and Y103F/E114Q Mutants of cis-CaaD—The three mutant genes were generated by overlap extension PCR (23Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6833) Google Scholar) using the plasmid pCC5 (1Poelarends G.J. Serrano H. Person M.D. Johnson Jr, W.H. Murzin A.G. Whitman C.P. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 759-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) as the template. The oligonucleotides, 5′-ATACATATGCCGGTTTATATGGTTTAC-3′ and 5′-CATGGATCCCTAGGTGCGAGAGACGTCCACGTT-3′ were used as the forward and reverse external primers, respectively. The forward primer contains an NdeI restriction site (in bold), and the reverse primer has a BamHI restriction site (in bold). For the H28A mutant, the internal PCR primers were oligonucleotides 5′-ATCACCGACGCGGCCAGGGGACTG-3′ and 5′-CAGTCCCCTGGCCGCGTCGGTGAT-3′. For the Y103F mutant, the internal PCR primers were oligonucleotides 5′-CACATCTGGGTCTTCTTCGGCAGA-3′ and 5′-CTCGCCGAAGAAGACCCAGATGTG-3′. For the Y103F/E114Q mutant, the internal PCR primers were oligonucleotides 5′-TGGGTCTTCTTCGGCGAGATGCCCGCCCAGCAGATGGTGCAGTACGGCC-3′ and 5′-GGCCGTACTGCACCATCTGCTGGGCGGGCATCTCGCCGAAGAAGACCCA-3′. The codons used to introduce the mutations are underlined. The amplification mixtures contained the appropriate synthetic primers, the deoxynucleotide triphosphates, the appropriate template DNA (∼100 ng), and the PCR reagents supplied in either the Taq DNA polymerase system (H28A and Y103F) or the Expand High Fidelity PCR system (Y103F/E114Q, F. Hoffmann-La-Roche Ltd., Basel, Switzerland). The restriction sites NdeI and BamHI, introduced during the amplification reaction, were used to clone the purified PCR products into plasmid pET-3b or pET-3c for overexpression of the mutant proteins. The cloned genes were sequenced to verify that only the desired mutation had been introduced during the PCR. Subsequently, the mutant enzymes were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21-Gold(DE3) and purified to homogeneity (as assessed by SDS-PAGE) using the protocol described for wild type (1Poelarends G.J. Serrano H. Person M.D. Johnson Jr, W.H. Murzin A.G. Whitman C.P. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 759-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The yields (ranging from 10 to 40 mg of homogeneous protein per liter of cell culture) were slightly diminished from those typically obtained for wild type (∼50–70 mg/liter). The elution times for the three mutant proteins and the wild-type cis-CaaD are comparable (∼34 min at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min) during gel-filtration chromatography, indicating that the homotrimeric structures of the mutant proteins are intact and that global structural changes had not occurred as a result of the mutations. Mass Spectrometric Characterization of the Mutant Proteins—The masses of the three cis-CaaD mutants were determined using an LCQ electrospray ion trap mass spectrometer (ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA), housed in the Analytical Instrumentation Facility Core in the College of Pharmacy at the University of Texas at Austin. The protein samples were made up as described elsewhere (3Wang S.C. Person M.D. Johnson Jr., W.H. Whitman C.P. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8762-8773Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The observed monomer masses were 16,556 Da (calc. 16,556 Da) for H28A, 16,606 Da (calc. 16,606 Da) for Y103F, and 16,605 Da (calc. 16,605 Da) for Y103F/E114Q. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry analysis indicated that the subunit had the expected mass and was not blocked by the initiating formylmethionine. Kinetic Characterization and 1H NMR Spectroscopic Detection of cis-CaaD Activity—cis-CaaD activity was determined at 22 °C by following the absorbance decrease at 224 nm, corresponding to the hydration of 1 (ϵ = 2900 m–1 cm–1), for 1 min (wild type and Y103F) or 10 min (E114Q and H28A) (1Poelarends G.J. Serrano H. Person M.D. Johnson Jr, W.H. Murzin A.G. Whitman C.P. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 759-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Absorbance data were obtained on a Hewlett Packard 8452A Diode Array spectrophotometer. The reported kinetic parameters are a numerical average of multiple runs. For the NMR samples, an amount of 1 (4 mg, ∼0.04 mmol) dissolved in Me2SO-d6 (30 μl) was added to 100 mm Na2HPO4 buffer (0.6 ml, pH ∼9) and placed in an NMR tube. The pH of the reaction mixture was adjusted to 9.5. Subsequently, enzyme (∼1.2 mg made up in 20 mm Na2HPO4 buffer, pH 8.0) was added to the reaction mixture. The reaction mixture was examined at 17 or 22 h (as noted in the text), and the amount of product was estimated by integration of the signals corresponding to 1, 5, 7, and the corresponding hydrates (1Poelarends G.J. Serrano H. Person M.D. Johnson Jr, W.H. Murzin A.G. Whitman C.P. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 759-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). NMR spectra were recorded in 100% H2O on a Varian Unity INOVA-500 spectrometer as described previously (1Poelarends G.J. Serrano H. Person M.D. Johnson Jr, W.H. Murzin A.G. Whitman C.P. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 759-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Structure of the Native cis-CaaD—The native cis-CaaD crystal structure was solved to 2.75-Å resolution by molecular replacement methods and refined to R and Rfree values of 23.3% and 26.3%, respectively. The asymmetric unit contains three monomers. Each monomer consists of a four-stranded β-sheet that is formed by the anti-parallel interaction of a pair of two-stranded parallel β-sheets (Fig. 1A). Two α-helices, each spanning the two strands of the parallel β-sheets, lie anti-parallel to each other in the concave side of the β-sheet plane. Hence, each monomer is made up of two β-α-β structural motifs that are characteristic of the tautomerase superfamily (7Murzin A.G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 386-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 8Whitman C.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 402: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 9Poelarends G.J. Whitman C.P. Bioorg. Chem. 2004; 32: 376-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The three monomers in the asymmetric unit superimpose with root-mean-square deviation (r.m.s.d.) values of ∼0.4 Å for 129 equivalent Cα atoms (out of a total of 149 amino acids). Each of the three monomers forms an independent barrel-like trimer by rotation around one of the crystallographic 3-fold rotation axes in the crystal (Fig. 1B). Interactions between the monomers are mediated by the edges of the four-stranded β-sheets and are mainly hydrophobic in nature. Each β-sheet further contributes polar residues that interact with each other and with three water molecules in the central cavity of the trimer. Additional monomer-monomer interactions are provided by two small β-hairpin structures near the termini of the central β-sheet and the two C-terminal α-helices (Fig. 1, A and B). Active Site of Native cis-CaaD—cis-CaaD contains three active sites with the catalytically important N-terminal proline buried in the interior of a monomer on one side of the trimer (Fig. 1B). The Pro-1 nitrogen interacts with one of the oxygen atoms of a sulfate ion, or possibly a phosphate ion, that is bound in the active site cavity (Fig. 2A). Both ions were present in the crystallization solution. The prolyl nitrogen atom interacts with one of the sulfate/phosphate oxygen atoms. The other three oxygen atoms of the sulfate/phosphate ion have electrostatic and hydrogen-bonding interactions with two arginines, Arg-70 and Arg-73, a positively charged histidine, His-28, and Thr-34 (not shown). The prolyl nitrogen atom further interacts with one of the side-chain oxygen atoms of the catalytic base, Glu-114, which is stacked between Leu-119 and Trp-101′ from a neighboring monomer. 5The unprimed and primed residues come from different monomers of cis-CaaD. The same oxygen atom of Glu-114 interacts with the side-chain hydroxyl group of Tyr-103′, also from a neighboring monomer. The other carboxylate oxygen of Glu-114 interacts with the backbone carbonyl oxygen of Leu-38, suggesting that the side chain of Glu-114 is protonated. As such, Glu-114 cannot function as the water-activating catalytic base in the hydration reaction catalyzed by cis-CaaD. Such a protonation state of the glutamate, however, could be an artifact of the low pH at which the native enzyme was crystallized. Comparison of cis-CaaD with Tautomerase Superfamily Members—cis-CaaD represents one of the five presently known families identified as constituents of the tautomerase superfamily (1Poelarends G.J.

https://openalex.org/W2049926325,"Abstract The number of synaptic α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA)-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) controls the strength of excitatory transmission. AMPARs cycle between internal endosomal compartments and the plasma membrane. Interactions between the AMPAR subunit GluR2, glutamate receptor interacting protein 1 (GRIP1), and the endosomal protein NEEP21 are essential for correct GluR2 recycling. Here we show that an about 85-kDa protein kinase phosphorylates GRIP1 on serine 917. This kinase is present in NEEP21 immunocomplexes and is activated in okadaic acid-treated neurons. Pulldown assays and atomic force microscopy indicate that phosphorylated GRIP shows reduced binding to NEEP21. AMPA or N-methyl-d-aspartate stimulation of hippocampal neurons induces delayed phosphorylation of the same serine 917. A wild type carboxy-terminal GRIP1 fragment expressed in hippocampal neurons interferes with GluR2 surface expression. On the contrary, a S917D mutant fragment does not interfere with GluR2 surface expression. Likewise, coexpression of GluR2 together with full-length wild type GRIP1 enhances GluR2 surface expression in fibroblasts, whereas full-length GRIP1-S917D had no effect. This indicates that this serine residue is implicated in AMPAR cycling. Our results identify an important regulatory mechanism in the trafficking of AMPAR subunits between internal compartments and the plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2031177342,"Hormone replacement therapy with estroprogestin preparations is associated with an increased risk of venous and arterial thromboembolic events in postmenopausal women. This study examined whether progestins affect the formation of NO in endothelial cells, and, if so, to determine the underlying mechanism. Experiments were performed with human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression was assessed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Western blot analysis, NO formation by electron spin resonance spectroscopy, nuclear translocation of the glucocorticoid receptor by immunofluorescence microscopy, and platelet aggregation by an aggregometer. Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) and progesterone markedly decreased the eNOS mRNA and protein levels, whereas levonorgestrel and nomegestrol acetate had only small effects. This effect was associated with a decreased NO formation leading to a reduced ability of endothelial cells to prevent platelet aggregation and was prevented by knockdown of the glucocorticoid receptor using siRNA. MPA and progesterone, but not levonorgestrel and nomegestrol acetate, caused nuclear translocation of the glucocorticoid receptor. The present findings indicate that certain progestins, including MPA, reduce the antiaggregatory effect of endothelial cells by decreasing the expression of eNOS and the formation of NO in endothelial cells, an effect that is mediated via activation of glucocorticoid receptors."

In this report we provide evidence that SorLA/LR11 is among the small family of glycoproteins that are modified with N-linked oligosaccharides that terminate with β1,4-linked GalNAc-4-SO4. Histochemical Staining—Mouse kidneys were removed and frozen with Tissue-Tek O.C.T. (Sakura Finetek U.S.A., Inc., Torrance, CA) on dry ice. Ten-μm cryosections were fixed with Methacarn solution (methanol:chloroform:acetic acid, 7:2:1) for 10 min at 20 °C. The sections were rehydrated in decreasing ethanol concentrations. After washing in phosphate-buffered saline, endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched with 0.3% H2O2 in methanol for 30 min followed by washing with phosphate-buffered saline. Sections were incubated in 5% goat serum in TNB (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% casein) for 30 min at 25 °C to inhibit nonspecific binding. After blocking sections were incubated with Cys-Fc (10 ng/ml in TNB) overnight at 4 °C. Sections were washed 3 times with TNT (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) and then incubated with peroxidase-conjugated goat antihuman IgG, Fc-γ fragment specific (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.). Slides were washed again 3 times with TNT and stained with Sigma Fast 3,3-diaminobenzidine (Sigma). Slides were counterstained with Harris Hematoxylin Solution (Sigma). After dehydrating and clearing, the slides were mounted with DPX (Fluka Biochemika, Ronkonkoma, NY). Cys-Fc-Agarose Preparation—Versalinx technology (Calbiochem) was used to covalently attach Cys-Fc to agarose. Versalinx amine modifying reagent was incubated with Cys-Fc at a molar ratio of 10:1. The phenyldiboronic acid-modified Cys-Fc was then incubated with Versalinx SHA-agarose. The conjugate contained 10–20 mg of Cys-Fc per ml of agarose. Western Blot Analyses—Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using 3–8% NuPAGE Tris acetate polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen). Molecular weight standards, Precision Plus Protein Dual Color Standards (Bio-Rad), were included to determine the apparent mobilities of proteins of interest. Following electrophoretic transfer to PVDF membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA) the membranes were blocked with 1% casein (Hammersten grade, BDH Chemicals) and then analyzed using Super Signal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate (Pierce) for detection of HRP-labeled probes. Cys-Fc-HRP was prepared by conjugating HRP to Cys-Fc (25Fiete D.J. Beranek M.C. Baenziger J.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2089-2093Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) using the EZ-link Activated Peroxidase Antibody Labeling Kit (Pierce). Incubations with Cys-Fc-HRP were carried out between 24 and 72 h at 4 °C. Rabbit antibody directed against the fibronectin domain of SorLA/LR11 (26Hampe W. Riedel I.B. Lintzel J. Bader C.O. Franke I. Schaller H.C. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4475-4485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was provided by Dr. Chica Shaller (Universitat Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany). Constructs containing the Vps10p domain of SorLA/LR11 with a V5 epitope at the carboxyl terminus were detected using HRP-anti-V5 (Invitrogen). Mouse anti-Tenascin-R/Janusin (catalog number 610629) was purchased from BD Biosciences. Purification of Cys-Fc Reactive Glycoproteins from Kidney— The medullas from 50 mouse kidneys were excised, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and fractured into a powder using a Bio-Pulverizer (BioSpec Products, Bartlesville, OK). The powder was suspended in ice-cold tissue protein extraction reagent (TPER) (Pierce Chemicals) containing EDTA-free Complete protease inhibitor (Roche, Nutley, NJ), 5 ml/g of powder, using a Polytron (Brinkmann). The extract was sedimented at 10,000 × g for 5 min and the supernatant collected. The supernatant was incubated with the anion exchanger Vivapure-D (Vivasciences, Carlsbad, CA). Bound proteins were eluted with a step gradient consisting of 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 m NaCl in TPER. Cys-Fc reactive proteins were eluted in the 0.5 and 1.0 m NaCl fractions as determined by Western blot analysis following separation on NuPAGE gels. The fractions containing Cys-Fc reactive protein were pooled, dialyzed against TPER, and then incubated with 150 μl of Cys-Fc-agarose at 4 °C for 48 h. The Cys-Fc-agarose was collected by brief sedimentation and washed 4 times with 3000 μl of ice-cold TPER for 30 min. The bound proteins were eluted by incubation 3 times with 300 μl of ice-cold TPER containing 1 mm GalNAc-4-SO4 for 30 min. The fractions were analyzed by Western blot on 3–8% Tris acetate NuPAGE gels as shown in Fig. 2. MS/MS Peptide Sequence Analysis—A protein corresponding to the Cys-Fc reactive material seen by Western blot was visualized with Colloidal Coomassie Blue G-250 and excised from the acrylamide gel for sequence analysis. Proteolytic digestion with trypsin, separation of peptides by microcapillary reverse-phase HPLC, nano-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry on a Finnigan LCQ DECA XP quadrapole ion trap mass spectrometer, and correlation of the fragments with known sequences using the Sequest algorithm were performed by the Harvard Microchemistry Facility, Harvard, University, Cambridge, MA. A total of 33 distinct peptides were identified that corresponded to the major component mouse SorLA/LR11 were identified. Analytic Separation of Cys-Fc Reactive Glycoproteins from Kidney—Following identification of the major Cys-Fc reactive band as SorLA/LR11 analytic separations were carried out. Medullas from 10 mouse kidneys were excised, minced, placed in 300 μl of ice-cold TPER containing EDTA-free Complete protease inhibitor, and ground using a PlusOne Sample Grinding Kit (Amersham Biosciences). The extract was diluted with an additional 700 μl of TPER containing EDTA-free Complete protease inhibitor and incubated for 1 h on ice with mixing. The sample was sedimented a 10,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was incubated with 50 μl of Cys-Fc-agarose in a Mini-Spin column (product number 69705, Pierce) at 4 °C for 5 days. The unbound fraction was obtained by spinning the column at 50 × g for 1 min. The Cys-Fc-agarose was then wash 2 times with 100 μl of ice-cold TPER followed by collection by sedimentation at 50 × g. The column was then plugged and the bound material eluted by incubation with cold TPER containing 1 mm GalNAc-4-SO4 for 2 h followed by collection by sedimentation at 50 × g. This was repeated a total of 4 times. Each of the fractions from the Cys-Fc-agarose column was analyzed by Western blotting using Cys-Fc and anti-SorLA/LR11 as shown in Fig. 3. Expression of SorLA/LR11 Constructs—Human SorLA/LR11 cDNA in the expression plasmid pcDNA3.1/Zeo+ (6Jacobsen L. Madsen P. Jacobsen C. Nielsen M.S. Gliemann J. Petersen C.M. J. Biol.

Petersen, Department of Medical Biochemistry, University of Aarhus, Denmark. The amino-terminal region containing the Vps10p domain was amplified and ligated into pcDNA3.1V5HisTOPO (Invitrogen) using primers 5′-GATGGCGACACGGAGCAGC-3′ and 5′-GATCTTCCGATAGCCTCTC-3′. Mutations were introduced into the Vps10p domain of pcDNA3.1hSorLA/Vps10p(V5His) by PCR-mediated overlap extension using the following primers: 1) deletion of KPLRRKR, 5′-CGCGCGGACGAGAGCGCTGCCCTGCAGCCCGAGCCCATC-3′ and 5′-CAGGGCAGCGCTCTCGTCCGCGCGGCTCGCCCCCCTGG-3′; 2) replacement of KTVFKRR with KTVFQQQ, 5′-GTTTGCTGGG ACACAAGACTGTTTTCCAGCAGCAGACCCCCCATGCCACATGC-3′ and 5′-GCATGTGGCATGGGGGGTCT-3′; and 3) deletion of RRTRGYRK, 5′-AAGACTGTTTTCACCCCCCATGCCACATGCTTCAATGG-3′ and 5′-GGTGAAAACAGTCTTGTGTCCCAGCAAACACTC-3′. Multiple mutations were introduced sequentially. Expression plasmids were introduced into cultured cells by transfection using Lipofectin PLUS Reagent or Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) using protocols recommended by the manufacturer. Cys-Fc Reactive Material Is Located in the Medulla and Papilla of the Mouse Kidney—We previously reported that both protein-specific β1,4GalNAc-transferase activity and GalNAc-4-sulfotransferase activity can be detected in a number of tissues including the pituitary, salivary glands, brain, and kidney (27Dharmesh S.M. Skelton T.P. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17096-17102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because the Cys-rich domain of the Man/GalNAc-4-SO4 receptor is highly specific for terminal sulfated sugars such as β1,4-linked GalNAc-4-SO4 (25Fiete D.J. Beranek M.C. Baenziger J.U. Proc. Natl.

Med. 2000; 191: 1117-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), we utilized a chimeric protein consisting of the Cys-rich domain and the Fc domain of human IgG, Cys-Fc, to immunostain tissue sections for the presence of glycoproteins bearing terminal β1,4-linked GalNAc-4-SO4 (15Woodworth A. Fiete D. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50941-50947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 25Fiete D.J. Beranek M.C. Baenziger J.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2089-2093Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Cells comprising collecting ducts in the medulla and papilla of the mouse kidney are intensely stained (Fig. 1). The immunoreactivity seen in the kidney in combination with the presence of protein-specific β1,4GalNAc-transferase activity and GalNAc-4-sulfotransferase activity indicate that one or more of the glycoproteins produced by these cells are potentially modified with terminal β1,4-linked GalNAc-4-SO4 on their N-or O-linked oligosaccharides. Proteins were solubilized from the cortex and medulla of mouse kidneys using TPER and examined by Western blotting following separation by SDS-PAGE and electrophoretic transfer to PVDF membranes. A glycoprotein with Mr > 250,000 is the predominant species that reacts with the Cys-Fc chimera and is enriched in the extract of the medulla as compared with the cortex (not shown). This protein was bound by the anion exchanger Vivapure D and eluted at a NaCl concentration between 0.5 and 1.0 m. When the material eluted from the anion exchanger was incubated with Cys-Fc-agarose, the Cys-Fc reactive band was removed from the extract (Fig. 2, lane T versus UB). Consistent with the modest affinity we have observed for glycoproteins with a limited number of GalNAc-4-SO4 termini (28Roseman D.S. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17052-17057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), the Cys-Fc reactive material was present in the fractions eluted with 150 mm NaCl (Fig. 2, W1–W4) and in the fractions eluted with 1 mm GalNAc-4-SO4 (Fig. 2, E1–E3). Staining with Coomassie Blue revealed the presence of a protein band at the position of the Cys-Fc reactive material eluted with 1 mm GalNAc-4-SO4. The fractions eluted with NaCl contained a large number of additional bands when stained with Coomassie Blue (not shown). We therefore utilized the GalNAc-4-SO4 eluted material for MS/MS analysis. MS/MS analysis of the protein eluted with GalNAc-4-SO4 following proteolytic digestion with trypsin and separation of the resulting peptides by microcapillary HPLC yielded 33 peptides that corresponded to the glycoprotein SorLA/LR11 when analyzed by Sequest (Table 1). A non-erythroid form of spectrin was also identified in this sample, however, because spectrin is not glycosylated this was not pursued further. SorLA/LR11 is a member of the LDL-receptor family that is expressed in collecting ducts of the medulla and papilla of murine kidney (31Riedel I.B. Hermans-Borgmeyer I. Hubner C.A. Histochem.

As seen during the larger scale purification, the major Cys-Fc reactive glycoprotein is present in both the NaCl-eluted wash fractions and the GalNAc-4-SO4-eluted fractions (Fig. 3A). Western blot analysis with an antibody directed at the fibronectin domain of SorLA/LR11 (26Hampe W. Riedel I.B. Lintzel J. Bader C.O. Franke I. Schaller H.C. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4475-4485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reacted with the same glycoprotein species (Fig. 3B); however, the amount of immunoreactive SorLA/LR11 in the unbound (UB) fraction was not significantly reduced as compared with the total extract (T). Taken together this suggests that a subset of the SorLA/LR11 molecules produced in the kidney is modified with terminal GalNAc-4-SO4. SorLA/LR11 is abundantly expressed by neurons in the brain (2Yamazaki H. Bujo H. Kusunoki J. Seimiya K. Kanaki T. Morisaki N. Schneider W.J. Saito Y. J. Biol.

Furthermore, GalNAc-4-sulfotransferase and protein-specific β1,4GalNAc-transferase activities are also expressed in the brain (27Dharmesh S.M. Skelton T.P. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17096-17102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and Cys-Fc reactive material is particularly prominent in the cerebellum and hippocampus (15Woodworth A. Fiete D.

We recently reported that the extracellular matrix protein tenascin-R is modified with terminal GalNAc-4-SO4 and can be bound to immobilized Cys-Fc (15Woodworth A. Fiete D. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50941-50947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). As can be seen in Fig. 4, a fraction of SorLA/LR11 (A and B, solid arrow), like tenascin-R (A and C, open arrows), is bound by immobilized Cys-Fc and eluted with GalNAc-4-SO4. This suggests that a subset of the SorLA/LR11 produced in the brain, as in the kidney, bears N-linked oligosaccharides that are modified with terminal β1,4-linked GalNAc-4-SO4. Recombinant SorLA/LR11 Is Modified with Terminal GalNAc-4-SO4 When Expressed in HEK-293 Cells—HEK-293 cells but not CHO cells are able to add terminal GalNAc-4-SO4 to Asn-linked oligosaccharides on glycoproteins containing the appropriate peptide recognition determinant, such as the glycoprotein hormone LH (34Smith P.L. Skelton T.P. Fiete D. Dharmesh S.M. Beranek M.C. MacPhail L. Broze Jr., G.J. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19140-19146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Smith P.L. Kaetzel D.

A fraction of recombinant human SorLA/LR11 synthesized in HEK-293 cells endogenously expressing β1,4-GalNAc-transferase and GalNAc-4-sulfotransferase activities required for GalNAc-4-SO4 addition was bound by immobilized Cys-Fc and eluted with GalNAc-4-SO4 (Fig. 5, lower panel). In contrast, none of the recombinant SorLA/LR11 synthesized in CHO cells, which do not express the required transferases, was bound by immobilized Cys-Fc (Fig. 5, upper panel). The fraction of recombinant SorLA/LR11 produced in HEK-293 cells that was bound by immobilized WFA, which binds terminal β1,4-linked GalNAc (36Mengeling B.J. Smith P.L. Stults N.L. Smith D.F.

Chem. 1989; 264: 3235-3243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was higher than the fraction of SorLA/LR11 bound by immobilized Cys-Fc (not shown). This indicates that much of the GalNAc added to the recombinant SorLA/LR11 is not further modified with sulfate. Expression of recombinant GalNAc-4-ST1 (38Xia G. Evers M.R. Kang H.-G. Schachner M. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38402-38409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) along with recombinant SorLA/LR11 in HEK-293 cells reduces the amount of SorLA/LR11 bound by immobilized WFA and increases the amount bound by Cys-Fc (not shown). Thus the level of endogenous GalNAc-4-sulfotransferase is not sufficient to modify all of the terminal β1,4-linked GalNAc present on recombinant SorLA/LR11 when the latter is expressed in HEK-293 cells. Recombinant β1,4-N-Acetylgalactosamine Transferases Modify Oligosaccharides on SorLA/LR11 with GalNAc—Three β1.4-N-acetylgalactosamine transferases (β1,4GalNAcT) have been described that are able to modify N-linked oligosaccharides with β1,4-linked GalNAc: a β1,4GalNAcT cloned from Caenorhabditis elegans (39Kawar Z.S.

Our previous work has established that stress MAPK signaling stimulates VDR expression (Qi, X., Pramank, R., Wang, J., Schultz, R. M., Maitra, R. K., Han, J., DeLuca, H. F., and Chen, G. (2002) J.

In response to stress c-Jun is recruited to the Vdr promoter before VDR protein expression is induced. The necessary and sufficient role of c-Jun in VDR expression was established by the fact that c-Jun knock-out decreases VDR expression, whereas c-Jun restoration recovers its activity. Existence of the non-classical VDR pathway was suggested by a requirement of both c-Jun and VDR in stress-induced VDR activity and further demonstrated by VDR inhibiting c-Jun-dependent cell death independent of its classical transcriptional activity and independent of vitamin D3. c-Jun is also required for vitamin D3-induced classical VDR transcriptional activity by a mechanism likely involving physical interactions between c-Jun and VDR proteins. These results together reveal a non-classical mechanism by which VDR acts as a c-Jun/AP-1 target gene to modify c-Jun activity in stress response through increased protein expression independent of classical transcriptional regulations.

Moreover, vitamin D3 has a well established cancer inhibitory activity: it prevents carcinogenesis in colon, mammary glad, and skin (8Studzinski G.P. Moore D.C. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4014-4022PubMed Google Scholar), and inhibits malignant growth in vitro and in vivo (9Vink-van Wijngaarden T. Pols H.A.P. Buurman C.J. van den Bemd G.J.C.M. Dorssers L.C.J.

Whereas vitamin D3 is generally believed to exert biological activities through its receptor VDR (the classical pathway or mechanism), it is not known whether VDR alone exhibits any of these activities in the absence of vitamin D3. The classical VDR pathway is believed to initiate upon vitamin D3 binding to its receptor. Through conformation changes, VDR dimerizes with itself and/or its partners such as retinoid X receptor (RXR), which then bind to specific vitamin D responsive elements (VDREs) in a target gene promoter, leading to gene transcription alterations (1Jones G. Strugnell S.A. Deluca H.F. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 1193-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar). Like other nuclear hormone receptors, VDR protein consists of several functional domains including a DNA-binding domain and a C-terminal ligand-binding domain, and functions in cooperation with co-regulators through formation of a chromatin-remodeling complex (11Belandia B.

Through signaling integrations of various target genes, vitamin D3/VDR activity is converted into biological effects. Recent studies suggest that vitamin D3 and its receptor may each have distinct activities in regulating cell death. Vitamin D3, for example, induces cell death in some cases (7Mathiasen I.S.

Paus R. Menrad A. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1998; 111: 598-604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). With regard to its receptor, several pieces of evidence suggest that VDR may be anti-apoptotic by itself. This was first demonstrated by induction of cell death after antisense-mediated VDR inhibition (21Hewison M. Dabrowski M. Vadher S. Faulkner L. Cockerill F.J. Brickell P. O'Riordan J.L.H. Katz D.R. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4391-4400PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, HeLa cells stably transfected with VDR showed resistance to etoposide-induced apoptosis (6Kousteni S. Bellido T. Plotkin L.I.

Acquafondata M. Dhir R. Getzenberg R. J. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 93: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) in VDR knock-out mice provide further genetic evidence for VDR anti-apoptotic activity. Signaling mechanisms for VDR anti-apoptotic activity as well as its relationship to the classical VDR pathways, however, remain mostly un-established. c-Jun, a major component of AP-1 transcription factor, is activated by both mitogenic and stress signals downstream of ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase), JNK (N-terminal c-Jun kinase), and p38 MAPKs (mitogen-activated protein kinases) through phosphorylation and trans-activation. AP-1 is composed of homodimers of the Jun family or its heterodimers with one of other transcription factors such as Fos, ATF2, cAMP-response element-binding protein, and NFAT (25Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2249) Google Scholar, 26Shaulian E. Karin M. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2002; 5: E131-E136Crossref Scopus (2172) Google Scholar). JNK activates c-Jun by phosphorylating Ser63, Ser73, Thr91, and/or Thr93 residues on its N-terminal region, whereas ERK and p38 do so by increasing c-Jun expression via an AP-1-dependent mechanism (25Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2249) Google Scholar, 27Ono K. Han J. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1384) Google Scholar). c-Jun thus serves as a central transcription factor to integrate signaling from three major MAPK pathways resulting in specific cellular response. c-Jun phosphorylation in neurons and fibroblasts is linked to apoptosis activated by JNK and p38 stress MAPKs (28Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5028) Google Scholar, 29Behrens A. Sibilia M. Wagner E.F. Nat.

Biol. 2000; 20: 575-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). An anti-apoptotic c-Jun function, however, was demonstrated by expressing a dominant negative c-Jun in cancer cells (31Potapova O. Gorospe M. Dougherty R.H. Dean N.M. Gaarde W.A. Holbrook N.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1713-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and by knocking out c-Jun expression in primary hepatocytes (32Eferi R. Ricci R. Kenner L. Zenz R. David J. Rath M. Wagner E.F. Cell. 2003; 112: 181-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Thus, c-Jun activity can be either pro-apoptotic or anti-apoptotic by an unknown mechanism. Because a primary function of c-Jun/AP-1 is to regulate gene expression, some of its target genes may play a role in determining specific effects of c-Jun activation. Our previous work has established that stress MAPK signaling (JNK and p38) stimulates VDR gene expression through an AP-1 site on the VDR promoter (33Qi X. Pramank R. Wang J. Schultz R.M. Maitra R.K. Han J. DeLuca H.F. Chen G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25884-25892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Because c-Jun/AP-1 is a central transcription factor, these results may provide explanations for regulatory effects of various stimuli on VDR protein expression (34Chen T.L. Feldman D. J. Biol.

Angelini D.F. Borsellino G. Battistini L. Brosnan C.F. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 6144-6152Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Moreover, we showed that cellular VDR proteins restrain stress-induced cell death in response to p38 activation (38Qi X. Tang J. Pramanik R. Schultz R.M. Shirasawa S. Sasazuki T. Han J. Chen G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22138-22144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Here we sought to test the hypothesis that VDR may act as a c-Jun/AP-1 target gene to determine outcomes of stress-induced c-Jun activation. Our results revealed that c-Jun is both necessary and sufficient for VDR expression and VDR in turn inhibits stress-induced c-Jun-dependent cell death by non-classical mechanisms. cDNA Expression Plasmids and Other Reagents—Expression constructs for human VDR, its dominant negative form VDR/GSV (GSV), and VDRE-luciferase reporter (VDRE-Luc, a luciferase gene driven by two copies of a VDRE from osteopontin gene (Spp1)), were kindly provided by Leonard Freedman (2Liu M.

Anti-phospho-c-Jun (Ser63) and V5 monoclonal antibody were purchased from Cell Signaling and Invitrogen, respectively. An ECL Plus kit for Western detection was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Luciferase Assay—Human breast cancer MDA-MB-468 (468) cells were obtained from ATCC. The c-Jun knock-out (c-Jun–/–) and the wild-type fibroblasts (c-Jun+/+) were kindly provided by Ron Wisdom (43Johnson R. Spiegelman B. Hanahan D. Wisdom R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4504-4511Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The stable VDR (and its mutants)-overexpressed 468 cell lines were generated by transfecting the cDNA expressing constructs in pcDNA3-V5 vector, followed by selection with 0.6 mg/ml G418 (33Qi X.

To express c-Jun and VDR in c-Jun null fibroblasts, pLHCX and LZRS retroviral vectors were used, respectively (41Tang J. Qi X. Mercola D. Han J. Chen G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23910-23917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Briefly, pLHCX-c-Jun and LZRS-VDR (and corresponding empty vectors) were transfected into Phoenix-Ampo cells and the resultant supernatants were used to infect c-Jun–/– cells, followed by selection with antibiotics (pLHCX with hygromycin and LZRS with puromycin) for about 1 week. For luciferase assay, cells were collected 48 h after transfection and the luciferase activity (VDR-Luc or VDRE-Luc) was assayed with a dual luciferase kit from Promega using pRL-TK (encoding Renilla luciferase) as an internal control in a TD-20/20 Luminometer (Turner Designs). To determine stress-induced VDRE Luc activity, cells were pulse treated with 20 μm ARS for 2 h, 24 h before the luciferase assay. To assess effects of vitamin D3 on the VDRE activity, cells were cultured in the presence or absence of vitamin D3 for the last 24 h. The results from at least three separate experiments were analyzed with Student's t test for the statistically significant difference. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation PCR Assay—This experiment was essentially carried out as described before (44Szak S.T. Mays D. Pietenpol J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3375-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Briefly, growth medium was aspirated (about 70% confluent) after pulse treatment with or without ARS (200 μm for 2 h) and cells were then incubated with 1% formaldehyde solution in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min at room temperature for the cross-linking of DNA with associated proteins. The cross-linking reaction was terminated by glycine (the final concentration at 125 mm, for 5 min) and cells were collected in RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 5 mm EDTA). The following inhibitors were added to the buffer immediately before use: protease inhibitors (antipain, 10 μg/ml; leupeptin, 10 μg/ml; pepstain A, 10 μg/ml; chymostatin, 10 μg/ml; and 4-(2-aminoethy)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 200 μg/ml), phosphatase inhibitors (50 mm NaF, and 200 μm sodium orthovanadate), and the deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (5 μm). Cell lysates were sonicated and incubated with 2 μg of polyclonal anti-c-Jun antibody or IgG (Santa Cruz, sc-44-G) to precipitate c-Jun-associated DNA. The precipitates were washed and incubated with cross-linking reversal buffer (125 mm Tris (pH 6.8), 10% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 4% SDS). DNA was phenol-chloroform extracted, ethanol precipitated, and used as a template for PCR (primers: forward, ggggtaccccgcgccctgcaggagaaactc; reverse, gaagatcttcgcgcttcccgtgcttagggc) based on the mouse Vdr promoter sequence (42Jehan F. Deluca H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10138-10143Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Genomic DNA was also prepared from a set of control and ARS-treated cells and subjected to PCR as an input control. Cell Death, Immunoprecipitations, Western, and Northern Blot Analysis—For cell death assay, cells were plated at the same density and treated either with ARS or AMSA (or the solvent control) for 24 h. Cell viability was assessed by a trypan blue exclusion assay (45Qi X. Borowicz S. Pramanik R. Schultz R.M. Han J. Chen G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6769-6777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and analyzed with Student's t test for statistically significant difference. Moreover, a duplicate set of cells in some cases were treated, fixed in ethanol, and stained for flow cytometric analyses for apoptotic sub-G1 populations as we previously described (45Qi X. Borowicz S. Pramanik R. Schultz R.M. Han J. Chen G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6769-6777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation was performed as previously described (45Qi X. Borowicz S. Pramanik R. Schultz R.M. Han J. Chen G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6769-6777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) using a rat monoclonal VDR antibody (9A7). For Western blot analyses, cells were directly lysed in 1× loading buffer. Lysates generated were then treated and separated in SDS-PAGE (33Qi X. Pramank R. Wang J. Schultz R.M. Maitra R.K. Han J. DeLuca H.F. Chen G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25884-25892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), followed by transferring onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The resultant membrane was typically blocked with 5% milk in TBST for 1 h and incubated with primary antibody in 5% milk TBST at 4 °C overnight. Dilutions for the antibody were: rabbit polyclonal anti-VDR (C20, Santa Cruz), 1:1000; rabbit monoclonal anti-phosphor-c-Jun (Ser63), 1:1000; and rabbit polyclonal anti-c-Jun (Santa Cruz), 1:2000. The membrane was then washed four times with 1× TBST and incubated with proper peroxidase-conjugated second antibody for 1 h at room temperature. ECL reaction was carried out according to the manufacturer instructions (Amersham Biosciences) and the resultant bands were visualized in a PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare). Each membrane was typically stripped off and re-probed with additional antibodies two to three times for comparison and normalization. For Northern blot, total RNA was prepared by using TRIzol (Invitrogen), which was separated and incubated with the labeled VDR probe as described previously (33Qi X. Pramank R. Wang J. Schultz R.M.

To reveal mechanisms for this activation, a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (44Szak S.T. Mays D. Pietenpol J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3375-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) was performed to examine whether c-Jun binds to the Vdr promoter by a phosphorylation-dependent mechanism. Mouse NIH 3T3 cells in this case were treated with and without the stress stimulus ARS, and cell lysates were subjected to anti-c-Jun immunoprecipitation following cross-linking of bound transcription factors to DNA by formaldehyde. The precipitates were examined by PCR for the presence of endogenous VDR gene promoter (33Qi X. Pramank R. Wang J. Schultz R.M. Maitra R.K. Han J. DeLuca H.F. Chen G. J. Biol.

A. 1997; 94: 10138-10143Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Results in Fig. 1A showed that c-Jun protein did not bind to the VDR DNA in untreated cells, but upon phosphorylation by ARS, it was recruited into the VDR promoter. The specificity of this band was demonstrated by the fact that the same ARS treatment did not yield a band without the cross-linking and the band is the same in size as the positive control using the mouse VDR promoter as a PCR template (data not shown). More importantly, the promoter binding precedes increased VDR protein expression, which was evident 24 h after ARS treatment and became most significant 48 h later (Fig. 1B). Because previous studies (33Qi X. Pramank R. Wang J. Schultz R.M. Maitra R.K. Han J. DeLuca H.F. Chen G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25884-25892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 46Gilad L.A. Bresler T. Gnainsky J. Smirnoff P. Schwartz B. J. Endocrinol. 2005; 185: 577-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) showed an involvement of c-Jun phosphorylation in induction of VDR RNA and/or protein expression, these results suggest that the promoter binding by phospho-c-Jun may serve as a key mechanism for this trans-activation. c-Jun Knock-out Results in Decreased Vdr Gene Activity, Reduced VDR Expression, and Compromised VDR Transcription Activity—To further establish the essential role of c-Jun in Vdr transcription, immortalized c-Jun knock-out fibroblasts (c-Jun–/–) were analyzed for VDR gene activity in comparison with the wild-type counterparts (c-Jun+/+) (43Johnson R. Spiegelman B. Hanahan D. Wisdom R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4504-4511Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The mouse Vdr luciferase promoter (VDR-Luc) was transiently expressed in these cells and the promoter activity was determined by luciferase assays. Results in Fig. 2A showed that the promoter activity was decreased more than 85% in c-Jun–/– cells as compared with c-Jun+/+ counterparts, indicating that c-Jun is required for the basal Vdr gene activity. Consistent with this observation, expression levels of VDR protein and RNA were also lower in c-Jun null cells (Fig. 2B). These results support a necessary role of c-Jun in VDR expression. To further assess the functional consequence of diminished VDR expression caused by knocking out the c-Jun gene, VDR transcriptional activity was assessed. In this case, both c-Jun+/+ and c-Jun–/– cells were transiently transfected with a VDRE-Luc reporter construct and treated with stress and vitamin D3 for their effects on the VDRE activity. Inclusion of stress in this experiment is to determine whether stress also regulates VDR activity as in the case of estrogen receptor (ER) (47Lee H. Jiang F. Wang Q. Nicosia S.V. Yang J. Bai W. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1882-1896Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and RXR (48Lee H.-Y. Suh Y.-A. Robinson M.J. Clifford J.L. Hong W.K. Woodgett J.R. Cobb M.H. Mangelsdorf D.J. Kurie J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32193-32199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and thereby to reveal if mechanisms involved are distinct than those observed in ligand-induced VDR activation. Results in Fig. 2C show that both ARS (also interleukin-1β and anisomycin, data not shown) and vitamin D3 significantly increased the reporter activity in c-Jun+/+ cells, whereas these stimulatory effects were completely abolished in c-Jun–/– cells. These results indicate that stress can stimulate Vdr transcriptional activity as vitamin D3 and c-Jun is required for both of these stimulations. Because VDR expression is decreased in c-Jun–/– cells, it would be important to further dissect the c-Jun-VDR relationship through rescue experiments. c-Jun Restoration Increases VDR Protein Expression whereas VDR Expression Rescues c-Jun-dependent Cell Death—Knockout studies have demonstrated an anti-apoptotic activity of c-Jun (32Eferi R.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 188-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar).

Regulation of these genes in response to the organism being challenged with galactose has served as a paradigm for eukaryotic transcriptional control over the last 50 years. Three proteins, the activator Gal4p, the repressor Gal80p, and the ligand sensor Gal3p, control the switch between inert and active gene expression. Gal80p, the focus of this investigation, plays a pivotal role both in terms of repressing the activity of Gal4p and allowing the GAL switch to respond to galactose. Here we present the three-dimensional structure of Gal80p from Kluyveromyces lactis and show that it is structurally homologous to glucose-fructose oxidoreductase, an enzyme in the sorbitol-gluconate pathway. Our results clearly define the overall tertiary and quaternary structure of Gal80p and suggest that Gal4p and Gal3p bind to Gal80p at distinct but overlapping sites. In addition to providing a molecular basis for previous biochemical and genetic studies, our structure demonstrates that much of the enzymatic scaffold of the oxidoreductase has been maintained in Gal80p, but it is utilized in a very different manner to facilitate transcriptional regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2082303556,"The onset of engulfment-dependent gene expression during Bacillus subtilis sporulation requires the forespore membrane protein SpoIIQ, which recruits mother cell proteins involved in late gene expression to the outer forespore membrane. Engulfment activates the late forespore transcription factor σG, which produces high levels of the secreted SpoIVB protease that is required for activation of the late mother cell transcription factor σK. Engulfment also triggers the proteolytic cleavage of SpoIIQ, an event that depends on the SpoIVB protease but not on σG activity. To determine if SpoIVB directly cleaves SpoIIQ and to determine if this event participates in the onset of late gene expression, we purified SpoIVB, SpoIIQ, and SpoIVFA (another SpoIVB substrate). SpoIVB directly cleaved SpoIIQ at the same site in vitro and in vivo and cleaved SpoIVFA in at least three different locations. SpoIIQ cleavage depends on membrane fusion, but not on σG activity, suggesting that the ability of SpoIVB to cleave substrates is regulated by membrane fusion. We isolated SpoIVB-resistant SpoIIQ proteins by random mutagenesis of codons at the cleavage site and demonstrated that SpoIIQ processing is dispensable for spore formation and for activation of late forespore and mother cell gene expression. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching analysis demonstrated that membrane fusion releases SpoIIQ from an immobile complex, an event that could allow SpoIVB to cleave SpoIIQ. We propose that this membrane fusion-dependent reorganization in the complex, rather than SpoIIQ proteolysis itself, is necessary for the onset of late transcription.

We propose that this membrane fusion-dependent reorganization in the complex, rather than SpoIIQ proteolysis itself, is necessary for the onset of late transcription. Endospore formation in Bacillus subtilis and its relatives depends on engulfment, a phagocytosis-like process that mediates a dramatic rearrangement of the sporangium from two adjacent daughter cells, to an endospore in which the forespore lies within the cytoplasm of the larger mother cell (see Fig. 1; reviewed by Refs. 1Errington J. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2003; 1: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar and 2Piggot P.J. Hilbert D.W. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2004; 7: 579-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Engulfment is critical for sporulation, because it allows spore assembly to occur in a protected environment. It also serves as a morphological checkpoint for activation of the late forespore and mother cell transcription factors σG and σK, respectively (reviewed by Refs. 1Errington J. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2003; 1: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 2Piggot P.J. Hilbert D.W. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2004; 7: 579-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 3Rudner D.Z.

Microbiol. 2000; 3: 553-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The endospore-forming bacteria must therefore have some mechanism to sense the completion of engulfment and to couple this morphological event to the onset of late gene expression. The forespore transcription factor σG is the first to become active after engulfment, but it remains unclear how σG is held inactive during engulfment or activated after engulfment. More is known about the regulation of the second late transcription factor, σK, which becomes active in the mother cell (summarized in Fig. 1B and reviewed by Refs. 1Errington J. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2003; 1: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 2Piggot P.J. Hilbert D.W. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2004; 7: 579-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 3Rudner D.Z.

Microbiol. 2000; 3: 553-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The σK factor is initially synthesized as an inactive pro-protein containing a hydrophobic leader sequence, which functions as a covalently attached anti-sigma factor (5Zhang B. Hofmeister A. Kroos L. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 92434-92441Google Scholar). This leader sequence is removed by the intramembrane protease SpoIVFB, which cleaves pro-σK within the membrane to release active σK (6Yu Y.T. Kroos L. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3305-3309Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 7Zhou R. Kroos L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This processing event shares many characteristics with Regulated Intramembrane Proteolysis (RIP), 3The abbreviations used are: RIP, regulated intramembrane proteolysis; FRAP, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching; PBS, phosphate buffered saline; GFP, green fluorescent protein; AMS, 4-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2;2′-disulfonic acid; KLH, Keyhole limpet hemocyanin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; BSA, bovine serum albumin; t0, t1, t2..., time of sporulation, with the number indicating hours after the initiation of sporulation by resuspension; FM, forespore membrane; OFM, outer forespore membrane. 3The abbreviations used are: RIP, regulated intramembrane proteolysis; FRAP, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching; PBS, phosphate buffered saline; GFP, green fluorescent protein; AMS, 4-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2;2′-disulfonic acid; KLH, Keyhole limpet hemocyanin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; BSA, bovine serum albumin; t0, t1, t2..., time of sporulation, with the number indicating hours after the initiation of sporulation by resuspension; FM, forespore membrane; OFM, outer forespore membrane. a widespread signal transduction mechanism in which extracellular signals are transduced to a protease that cleaves its substrate within the plane of the membrane to release an active transcription factor (reviewed by Refs. 9Ehrmann M. Clausen T. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2004; 38: 709-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar and 10Brown M.S. Ye J. Rawson R.B. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 2000; 100: 391-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar). As is typical of RIP systems, the intramembrane protease SpoIVFB is inactive until it receives an extracellular signal. In the case of SpoIVFB, the signal is the prior activation of the late forespore-specific transcription factor σG (11Cutting S. Oke V. Driks A. Losick R. Lu S. Kroos L. Cell. 1990; 62: 239-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), which produces higher levels of the SpoIVB protease (12Cutting S. Driks A. Schmidt R. Kunkel B. Losick R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 456-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). This protease disrupts an inhibitory complex between the SpoIVFB intramembrane protease and two other proteins, SpoIVFA, which is necessary for complex assembly and localization (13Rudner D.Z. Losick R. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1007-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), and BofA, which inhibits SpoIVFB activity (Fig. 1B) (7Zhou R. Kroos L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6385-6390Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 11Cutting S. Oke V. Driks A. Losick R. Lu S. Kroos L. Cell. 1990; 62: 239-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 13Rudner D.Z. Losick R. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1007-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). BofA is likely the main inhibitor of the SpoIVFB intramembrane protease, because it can inhibit SpoIVFB activity in an ectopic expression system (7Zhou R. Kroos L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6385-6390Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and because its genetic inactivation allows σK to become active in the absence of σG activity and in the absence of the SpoIVB signal transduction protease (11Cutting S. Oke V. Driks A. Losick R. Lu S. Kroos L. Cell. 1990; 62: 239-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The SpoIVB protease cleaves SpoIVFA and relieves BofA-mediated inhibition of SpoIVFB (12Cutting S. Driks A. Schmidt R. Kunkel B. Losick R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 456-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 14Dong T.C. Cutting S.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 1425-1434Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 15Campo N. Rudner D.Z. Mol. Cell. 2006; 7: 25-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 16Zhou R. Kroos L. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 58: 835-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This pathway results in the indirect coupling of σK activity to engulfment, by virtue of its dependence on the prior activation of σG. Recent evidence suggests that activation of σK is also directly coupled to the completion of engulfment in two distinct manners (17Jiang X. Rubio A. Chiba S. Pogliano K. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 58: 102-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). First, although the genetic elimination of BofA allows σK to become active in the absence of σG and SpoIVB, it does not allow σK activity in engulfment defective mutants (11Cutting S. Oke V. Driks A. Losick R. Lu S. Kroos L. Cell. 1990; 62: 239-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 17Jiang X. Rubio A. Chiba S. Pogliano K. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 58: 102-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Thus, the failure of these mutants to activate σG is not the only reason for the failure to activate σK. This suggests that σK activation is directly governed by engulfment via a pathway that does not depend on BofA, the known inhibitor of SpoIVFB intramembrane protease activity. We therefore previously proposed the existence of two distinct checkpoints for σK activity (17Jiang X. Rubio A. Chiba S. Pogliano K. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 58: 102-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar): the previously described forespore checkpoint that couples σK activity to σG activity via the BofA inhibitor (11Cutting S. Oke V. Driks A. Losick R. Lu S. Kroos L. Cell. 1990; 62: 239-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and the engulfment checkpoint that couples σK activity to the completion of engulfment via a BofA-independent mechanism (Fig. 1B) (17Jiang X. Rubio A. Chiba S. Pogliano K. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 58: 102-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Second, engulfment also appears likely to govern the activity of the SpoIVB protease that participates in the forespore checkpoint. This was first suggested by the observation that SpoIVB is synthesized both before engulfment by the early forespore transcription factor σF and after engulfment by the late forespore transcription factor σG (18Gomez M. Cutting S.M. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 3453-3457Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Additional support for the regulation of SpoIVB protease activity came from observations that the forespore membrane protein SpoIIQ is subject to a proteolytic processing event that depends on both engulfment and on the SpoIVB protease (17Jiang X. Rubio A. Chiba S. Pogliano K. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 58: 102-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 19Rubio A. Pogliano K. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1636-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, SpoIIQ processing occurs with apparently identical kinetics in wild-type strain or in a strain with a mutation in the gene encoding σG (spoIIIG). Thus, if SpoIVB directly cleaves SpoIIQ then its activity or access to substrates must be regulated by engulfment. SpoIIQ proteolysis could be involved in engulfment-dependent gene expression, because this forespore membrane protein plays several key roles in this stage of sporulation. First, SpoIIQ is essential for the engulfment-dependent activation of σG (20Sun Y.L. Sharp M.D. Pogliano K. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2919-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 21Londono-Vallejo J.A. Frehel C. Stragier P. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 29-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), although its precise role in this process remains unclear. Second, SpoIIQ participates in engulfment, providing a secondary mechanism that is necessary for membrane migration when the activity of the primary engulfment machinery is compromised (22Broder D.H. Pogliano K. Cell. 2006; 126: 917-928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This secondary engulfment mechanism requires the interaction between the extracellular domains of SpoIIQ and that of the mother cell membrane protein SpoIIIAH (Fig. 1B) (22Broder D.H. Pogliano K. Cell. 2006; 126: 917-928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 23Blaylock B. Jiang X. Rubio A. Moran Jr., C.P. Pogliano K. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2916-2928Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This interaction can readily be detected by several biochemical methods such as co-immunoprecipitation (23Blaylock B. Jiang X. Rubio A. Moran Jr., C.P. Pogliano K. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2916-2928Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), affinity chromatography (23Blaylock B. Jiang X. Rubio A. Moran Jr., C.P. Pogliano K. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2916-2928Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 24Doan T. Marquis K.A. Rudner D.Z. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 55: 1767-1781Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), and sucrose density gradient analysis (Fig. 5). Third, SpoIIQ is required for the localization of mother cell membrane proteins needed for both σG and σK activation to the outer forespore membrane that is the site of intracellular signal transduction (17Jiang X. Rubio A. Chiba S. Pogliano K. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 58: 102-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 23Blaylock B. Jiang X. Rubio A. Moran Jr., C.P. Pogliano K. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2916-2928Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 24Doan T. Marquis K.A. Rudner D.Z. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 55: 1767-1781Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Specifically, the interaction between SpoIIQ and SpoIIIAH prevents SpoIIIAH from diffusing away from the outer forespore membrane (23Blaylock B. Jiang X. Rubio A. Moran Jr., C.P. Pogliano K. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2916-2928Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 24Doan T. Marquis K.A. Rudner D.Z. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 55: 1767-1781Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), where it is required for σG activity. SpoIIIAH and SpoIIQ together are needed to localize the σK-processing machinery, SpoIVFA and SpoIVFB, to the outer forespore membrane, although it is unclear if SpoIIQ or SpoIIIAH directly interact with SpoIVFA or SpoIVFB (17Jiang X. Rubio A. Chiba S. Pogliano K. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 58: 102-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 24Doan T. Marquis K.A. Rudner D.Z. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 55: 1767-1781Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Interestingly, SpoIIQ, SpoIIIAH, and SpoIVFB all localize to foci surrounding the forespore (Fig. 4B) (17Jiang X. Rubio A. Chiba S. Pogliano K. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 58: 102-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 19Rubio A. Pogliano K. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1636-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 23Blaylock B. Jiang X. Rubio A. Moran Jr., C.P. Pogliano K. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2916-2928Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). These foci might represent synapse-like sites for intracellular signal transduction, perhaps allowing transcription in both cells to be coordinately regulated by engulfment. It remains unclear how the completion of engulfment is sensed, and if SpoIIQ serves only as a scaffold to localize these signal transduction proteins or if it also participates in signal transduction.FIGURE 4Altered proteolysis, localization, and dynamics of cleavage-defective GFP-SpoIIQ.

Arrowheads indicate septal localization of GFP-SpoIIQ (green); double arrows, GFP-SpoIIQ migrating with mother cell membrane; double arrowheads, helical structure. Membrane fusion (indicated by exclusion of FM4-64 from the forespore membranes, arrow and double arrowhead) occurs before proteolysis, which releases GFP into the cytoplasm (arrow). After fusion, V72Y remains membrane-bound but localizes smoothly around the forespore (arrow). C, FRAP analysis of GFP-SpoIIQV72Y at t3 performed and quantified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Images of GFP (green) and FM4-64 (red)-stained membranes of cells before bleaching are to the right of each graph. Images below each plot show the GFP fluorescence during the experiment; the second panel shows the cell just after bleaching. Recovery kinetics were quantified and plotted to show the mean pixel intensity of the bleached (filled square) and unbleached (empty circle) regions and the theoretical pixel intensity value following equilibration between these regions (dashed line). Wild-type GFP-SpoIIQ shows very little recovery (see supplemental Fig. S2 and Ref. 22Broder D.H. Pogliano K. Cell. 2006; 126: 917-928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) SpoIIQ proteolysis could affect its interaction with proteins involved in σG and σK activation, and therefore provides a potential mechanism by which late transcription might be coupled to engulfment. To determine if this is the case, and to determine if SpoIVB directly cleaves SpoIIQ, we further characterized SpoIIQ proteolysis. Specifically, we demonstrated that purified SpoIVB directly cleaves SpoIIQ, mapped the sites at which SpoIIQ is cleaved in vivo and in vitro, and isolated protease-resistant mutants. These mutants had no effect on σG or σK activity or spore formation, demonstrating that SpoIIQ processing is dispensable for sporulation. SpoIIQ proteolysis requires the membrane fusion event that is the final step of engulfment. Finally, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) demonstrates that the mobility of SpoIIQ dramatically increases after membrane fusion (in the absence of proteolysis), indicating that SpoIIQ is released from an essentially immobile complex after fusion. This reorganization in the SpoIIQ complex might control both proteolysis and signal transduction. Strain and Plasmid Construction—B. subtilis strains (Table 1) were constructed by transformation (25Dubnau D. Davidoff-Abelson R. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 56: 209-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Plasmids (supplemental Table S1) were constructed by standard cloning methods and site-directed mutagenesis (26Sawano A. Miyawaki A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 78Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Following introduction into the B. subtilis chromosome, recombinants were checked for their antibiotic resistance, the inactivation of amyE, and the loss of any additional drug resistance markers on the plasmid backbone. Primers used for plasmid construction are in supplemental Table S2. Plasmid pCH507 (amyE::PspoIIQgfp(Δ2–6)-spoIIQΩcat) was constructed by deleting the five codons that are derived from the spoIIQ gene and redundantly exist at the 5′ region of gfp on pAR47 (amyE::PspoIIQgfp-spoIIQΩcat (19Rubio A. Pogliano K. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1636-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar)) by site-directed mutagenesis (26Sawano A. Miyawaki A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 78Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) using a primer, SP1. Plasmids encoding either spoIIQ, gfp-spoIIQ,or gst-spoIIQ derivatives were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis using either pCH505 (amyE::PspoIIQspoIIQ), pCH507 (amyE::PspoIIQgfp(Δ2–6)-spoIIQ), or pGEX-SpoIIQ (gst-spoIIQ43–283 (23Blaylock B. Jiang X. Rubio A. Moran Jr., C.P. Pogliano K. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2916-2928Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar)) as the template. Primer SP2 was used for pCH510 (amyE::PspoIIQspoIIQ-his6Ωcat). The plasmids encoding spoIIQ cleavage site mutants (V72, G73, or K74) were constructed by using either SP3, SP4, or SP5 (respectively), which had a random mixture of bases in the target codon. pCH550 (spoIIQ1–72) was also isolated by this random mutagenesis. The DNA sequence of the resulting products was confirmed prior to transformation into B. subtilis. Plasmids encoding mono-Cys mutants of spoIIQ were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis using the template plasmid pCH505 (spoIIQ) and primers either SP10 (pCH528; A62C), SP11 (pCH530; D64C), SP12 (pCH531; D68C), SP13 (pCH532; V70C), SP14 (pCH533; E71C), SP15 (pCH534; V72C), SP16 (pCH535; G73C), or SP17 (pCH536; K74C), respectively.TABLE 1B. subtilis strains and plasmids used in this studyStrainGenotypeSourcePY79Wild type(39Youngman P.

A FLAG tag was introduced at the C-terminal end of spoIVFA by site-directed mutagenesis using SP8. A BamHI site was further introduced between the 100th and 101st codons by site-directed mutagenesis using primer SP9. A BamHI fragment encoding the C-terminal extracytoplasmic region was cloned into the same site of pGEX4T-3 (Amersham Biosciences). Sporulation Conditions—Sporulation was induced by resuspension at 37 °C (27Sterlini J.M. Mandelstam J. Biochem.

For small scale sporulations, the cells were resuspended in 2 ml of the sporulation media and cultured with rotating in test tubes (small scale culture for Fig. 3A). For larger scale sporulations, the cells were resuspended in 15 ml (for other Western blotting, β-galactosidase activity assay, and microscopy) or 200 ml (for immunopurification of SpoIIQ-FLAG derivatives in Fig. 2B) and shaken in flasks. Sporulation efficiency was determined as described (28Abanes-De Mello A. Sun Y.L. Aung S. Pogliano K.

The HS side chain of HSPGs can be cleaved by HPR1 (heparanase-1), an endoglycosidase that is overexpressed in many types of malignancies. In the present study, we demonstrated that HPR1 expression in pancreatic adenocarcinomas inversely correlated with the presence of heparan sulfate (HS) in the basement membrane. In vitro cell culture study revealed that cell surface HS levels inversely correlated with HPR1 activity in five pancreatic cancer cell lysates and their conditioned media. Heparin and PI-88, two HPR1 inhibitors, were able to increase cell surface HS levels in PANC-1 cells in a dose-dependent manner. The ability of HPR1 to degrade cell surface HS was confirmed by showing that cell surface HS levels were increased in HT1080 cells stably transfected with the HPR1 antisense gene but was decreased in the cells overexpressing HPR1. Further studies showed that PI-88 and heparin were able to stimulate PANC-1 cell proliferation in the absence or presence of exogenous FGF2, whereas exogenous HPR1 was able to inhibit PANC-1 cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Modulation of PANC-1 cell proliferation by HPR1 or HPR1 inhibitors corresponded with the inhibition or activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase. Our results suggest that HPR1 expressed in pancreatic adenocarcinomas can suppress the proliferation of pancreatic tumor cells in response to the growth factors that require HSPGs as their co-receptors.

Bernfield M. Nature. 2000; 404: 725-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). HSPGs comprise a protein core that is covalently attached to a unique glycosaminoglycan chain characterized by a linear array of alternating disaccharide units (1Perrimon N. Bernfield M. Nature. 2000; 404: 725-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 2Esko J.D. Lindahl U. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar, 3Iozzo R.V. J. Clin.

Chem. 1997; 272: 20508-20514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). HSPGs are essential for normal cell growth and development. HSPGs exert their multimodal functions by 1) sequestering with growth factors and protecting them from proteolytic degradation, 2) enhancing cell adhesion through the interaction of HSPGs with the HS-binding domain of extracellular matrix proteins, such as fibronectin, and 3) acting as a co-receptor for many heparin-bound growth factors, such as FGF and HB-EGF. Recent studies suggest that some HSPGs possess a tumor-promoting effect. For example, Korc and co-workers (5Matsuda K. Maruyama H. Guo F. Kleeff J. Itakura J. Matsumoto Y. Lander A.D. Korc M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5562-5569PubMed Google Scholar, 6Kleeff J. Ishiwata T. Kumbasar A. Friess H. Buchler M.W. Lander A.D. Korc M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1662-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) reported that overexpression of glypican-1 in pancreatic and breast cancers and in tumor cell lines can stimulate the mitogenic response of FGF2 and HB-EGF. Likewise, syndecan-1 overexpression in breast cancer correlates with an aggressive phenotype and poorer prognosis (7Conejo J.R. Kleeff J. Koliopanos A. Matsuda K. Zhu Z.W. Goecke H. Bicheng N.

Nackaerts et al. (10Nackaerts K. Verbeken E. Deneffe G. Vanderschueren B. Demedts M. David G. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 74: 335-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) showed that HS content is reduced in squamous cell lung carcinomas. The molecular mechanisms of the structural changes of HSPGs in these malignancies remain poorly understood. HPR1 is an endoglycosidase that specifically degrades HSPGs. HPR1 is overexpressed in a variety of malignancies (11Parish C.R. Freeman C. Hulett M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1471: M99-108PubMed Google Scholar, 12Vlodavsky I. Goldshmidt O. Zcharia E.

Using in situ hybridization, we have previously detected HPR1 mRNA in 78% of primary pancreatic adenocarcinomas (14Kim A.W. Xu X. Hollinger E.F. Gattuso P. Godellas C.V. Prinz R.A. J. Gastrointest. Surg. 2002; 6: 167-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Koliopanos et al. (15Koliopanos A. Friess H. Kleeff J. Shi X. Liao Q. Pecker I. Vlodavsky I. Zimmermann A. Buchler M.W. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4655-4659PubMed Google Scholar) reported that HPR1 mRNA levels detected by real time reverse transcription-PCR are elevated in 25 of 33 (83%) pancreatic cancers by an average of 30-fold, compared with that in normal pancreatic tissues. Increased HPR1 expression in pancreatic cancer cell lines by transient transfection of the HPR1 gene leads to an increase of their invasive potential. Rohloff et al. (16Rohloff J. Zinke J. Schoppmeyer K. Tannapfel A. Witzigmann H. Mossner J. Wittekind C. Caca K. Br. J. Cancer. 2002; 86: 1270-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), using immunohistochemical staining, showed that HPR1 is expressed in 76% of pancreatic adenocarcinomas at moderate or high levels. Our present study aims to determine if HPR1 expression in pancreatic adenocarcinomas and tumor cell lines leads to the degradation of HSPGs, subsequently affecting the mitogenic activity of the growth factors that require HSPGs as their co-receptors. Tissues—The use of specimens from human subjects was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Rush University Medical Center. Paraffin-embedded tissue blocks derived from patients with either primary pancreatic adenocarcinomas and/or metastases were obtained from the Department of Pathology. The stage of the pancreatic adenocarcinomas was classified according to the TNM (T, tumor size; N, spread to lymph nodes; M, metastasis) scheme used by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC). Forty-two pancreatic cancer specimens from patients (male/female, 21:21) with a mean age of 64 ± 11 (median age 65, range 34–81) years were analyzed for HPR1 expression by immunofluorescence (IF) staining. These 42 samples included 36 primary adenocarcinomas (35 from pancreatectomy and one from pancreatic biopsy) and six metastatic implants (three on the small bowel, one on the peritoneum, one in the liver, and one on the gallbladder). Fifty-two primary adenocarcinoma specimens and five metastases from patients (male/female, 28:24) with a mean age of 64 ± 10 years (median 65, range 37–80 years) were analyzed for HPR1 expression by immunohistochemical staining (IHC). IF Staining—The sections of tissue specimens were dewaxed and then fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde. The slides were incubated with an anti-HPR1 mAb (3–12 clone, working concentration 50 μg/ml) at room temperature for 30 min. The same concentration of normal mouse IgM was used as a negative control. The slides were washed three times with PBS, followed by incubation for 45 min with goat anti-mouse IgM conjugated with FITC (1:50) (ICN Biomedicals, Aurora, OH), and then washed and incubated for 45 min with rabbit anti-goat IgG conjugated with FITC (1:50) (ICN Biomedical, Aurora, OH). The slides were sealed with 50% glycerin in PBS containing anti-fade reagent 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (25 mg/ml) and 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma) (0.5 mg/ml). HPR1 expression was examined under a fluorescent microscope. HS deposition was similarly detected, except an anti-HS mAb (clone HepSS; Seikagaku Corp., Chuo-ku, Tokyo, Japan) was used at a concentration of 5 μg/ml. The pictures were taken with a digital camera operated on a Nikon Eclipse TE200 fluorescence microscope. Two investigators (X. X. and A. W. K.) graded HPR1 and HS expression in a blinded fashion. HPR1-negative tumors were defined as no HPR1 signal (–) or with weak signal (+) in less than ∼10% of tumor cells. HPR1-positive tumors were defined as moderate (++) or strong (+++) HPR1 signal in more than 10% of tumor cells. HS-negative tumors were defined as no HS signal (–) or weak signal (+) in less than ∼20% of tumor ducts. HS-positive tumors were defined as moderate (++) or strong (+++) HPR1 signal in more than 20% of tumor ducts. Immunohistochemistry—Tissue sections of paraffin-embedded blocks were dewaxed with xylene and rehydrated. Slides were processed for IHC staining with an anti-HPR1 anti-rabbit serum (1:500 dilution) as previously reported (17Xu X. Quiros R.M. Maxhimer J.B. Jiang P. Marcinek R. Ain K.B. Platt J.L. Shen J.

Two investigators (X. X. and R. M. Q.) and a pathologist (P. G.) graded HPR1 expression in a blinded fashion. HPR1-negative tumors were defined as no HPR1 signal (–) or weak signal (+) in less than ∼10% of tumor ducts. HPR1-positive tumors were defined as moderate (++) or strong (+++) HPR1 signal in more than 10% of tumor cells. Cells—CAPAN-1, COLO-587, HPAF-II, PANC-1, and MPANC-96 cell lines were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). CAPAN-1 and HPAF-II cells were grown in complete minimal essential medium containing 10% FBS, nonessential amino acids, sodium pyruvate, Hepes, penicillin, and streptomycin. COLO-587 cells were grown in complete RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS. PANC-1 cells were grown in complete RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS, nonessential amino acids, sodium pyruvate, Hepes, penicillin, and streptomycin. MPANC-96 cells were grown in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FBS. HT1080 cells were stably transfected with pcDNA3.1 empty vector. The vector encoding the human HPR1 gene in the sense or antisense orientation was produced earlier in our laboratory. Cells were maintained in the complete minimal essential medium containing 10% FBS, nonessential amino acids, sodium pyruvate, Hepes, penicillin, and streptomycin in the presence of 250 μg/ml G418. Quantitation of Heparanase Activity—When the monolayers of pancreatic cancer cell lines reached 90% confluence, the supernatants were collected; cell lysates were prepared and lysed in HPR1 enzymatic assay buffer (0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.0, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.01% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml each leupeptin and aprotinin). The supernatants were premixed at 9:1 with 10× HPR1 buffer. Protein concentrations in the cell lysates were analyzed by using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of cell lysates (100 μg/well) and supernatants were then added to the Matrigel-precoated ELISA plate and analyzed as previously reported (17Xu X. Quiros R.M. Maxhimer J.B. Jiang P. Marcinek R. Ain K.B. Platt J.L. Shen J. Gattuso P. Prinz R.A. Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 5968-5979PubMed Google Scholar). HPR1 activity was calculated based on the standard curve of serially diluted purified platelet HPR1 (starting at 1:200) at a concentration of 1 μl of HPR1 with the activity of degrading 0.133 μg of heparan sulfate/h at 37 °C in HPR1 buffer. HPR1 purification and characterization from human platelets were conducted as previously reported (20Ihrcke N.S. Parker W. Reissner K.J. Platt J.L. J. Cell Physiol. 1998; 175: 255-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). HPR1 activity was designated as per 100 units capable of degrading 1 ng of heparan sulfate at 37 °C/h in HPR1 buffer. Flow Cytometric Analysis—Single cell suspensions of pancreatic cancer cell lines were prepared by using cell dissociation solution. Cells (5 × 105/sample) were stained by incubation for 30 min at 4 °C with an anti-HS mAb (0.5 μg/sample) (clone HepSS; Seikagaku Corp., Chuo-ku, Tokyo, Japan) or mouse IgM as a negative control. Cells were incubated with FITC-labeled goat anti-mouse IgM (5 μl/sample) for 30 min at 4 °C followed by rabbit FITC-labeled anti-goat IgG (5 μl/sample) for 30 min at 4 °C. Cell surface HS expression was analyzed in a BD Biosciences flow cytometer. Since the binding of anti-HS antibody to HS also depends on specific structures of HS, detection of HS in different cell lines and tumor tissues, in particular in those from different origins, may not only reflect the quantity of HS but could also be affected by HS structure. A second anti-HS mAb (clone F58-10E4, mouse IgM; Seikagaku Corp., Chuo-ku, Tokyo, Japan) was used to analyze cell surface HS levels in HPAF-II and PANC-1 cells. The bindability of these two anti-HS monoclonal antibodies was compared. To detect cell surface HPR1 expression in transfected HT1080 cells, cells were similarly stained with an affinity-purified anti-HPR1 mAb and rabbit IgG (5 μl/sample each) followed by the use of FITC-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG or goat anti-rabbit IgG, respectively. Cell Proliferation—Single cell suspension of PANC-1 cells was prepared by using cell dissociation solution and washed twice with PBS. Cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 1 × 104/well in the complete RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. After incubation overnight, cells were washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution and subsequently incubated for 48 h with serum-free RPMI 1640 containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 5 μg/ml transferrin, 5 ng/ml sodium selenite in the absence or presence of the indicated concentrations of HPR1 inhibitors and/or FGF2. Cell proliferation was monitored by using a CellTiter 96 nonradioactive cell proliferation assay kit following the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Madison, WI). Western Blot—A single cell suspension of PANC-1 cells was prepared by using the cell dissociation solution. Cells were seeded in a 6-well plate. Upon 80% confluence, cell monolayer was washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution and then incubated in serum-free RPMI1640 medium in the absence of presence of various concentrations of PI-88 or heparin. For stimulation with FGF, cells were starved in serum-free medium for 24 h and then stimulated with FGF (10 ng/ml) for 15 min. Cell lysates were prepared in Triton X-100 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm each EDTA and EGTA, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mg/ml each leupeptin and aprotinin). Cell lysates were run on a 10% polyacrylamide gel and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. MAPK activation was analyzed by Western blot by probing with anti-phospho-ERK1/2. The membrane was then stripped and reprobed with an anti-ERK1/2 rabbit IgG (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA). Statistical Analysis—The relationship of HPR1 expression with the deposition of HS in the BM was analyzed by using a χ2 test. The significant difference in the proliferation of PANC-1 cells treated with HPR1 inhibitors, FGF2, and HPR1 was conducted by using an unpaired Student's t test. A p value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All statistical calculations were conducted by using SigmaStat 3 software. HPR1 Expression in Pancreatic Adenocarcinomas—In order to determine whether HPR1 expression leads to the degradation of HS in pancreatic cancer, we first analyzed HPR1 expression by using IF and IHC staining with two immunological probes. We conducted IF staining on the sections of 42 pancreatic adenocarcinomas with an anti-HPR1 mAb (clone 3–12). This antibody has been previously characterized (21Dempsey L.A. Plummer T.B. Coombes S.L. Platt J.L. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 467-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar); it can neutralize HPR1 enzymatic activity and recognize HPR1 in the sections of paraffin embedded tissues. As shown in Fig. 1, strong cytoplasmic staining indicating HPR1 expression in a pancreatic adenocarcinoma (Fig. 1, B and C, ×200 and ×400, respectively) was observed. The stromal cells and vascular endothelial cells did not express HPR1. HPR1 was not expressed or was expressed at very low levels in the normal ductal epithelium and acinar cells in the vicinity of a pancreatic adenocarcinoma (Fig. 1A, ×200). Mouse IgM was included as a negative control, fluorescence signal was not detected in tumor cells, but a few weak nonspecific signals were scattered in some stromal cells (Fig. 1D). We analyzed 36 primary pancreatic adenocarcinomas and six metastases. As summarized in Table 1, 27 of 36 (75%) primary pancreatic adenocarcinomas and five of the six (83%) metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinomas were HPR1-positive. Although the frequency of HPR1 expression in this small group of pancreatic cancer metastases was comparable with their primary tumors, HPR1 signals in metastases were generally weaker than in their primary tumors.TABLE 1HPR1 expression in normal pancreas and in primary and metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinomasIF stainingIHC stainingPrimaryMetastasesNormalPrimaryMetastasesNormalTotal3661052510Positive27 (75%)5 (83%)0 (0%)31 (63%)4 (80%)0 (0%) Open table in a new tab HPR1 expression in pancreatic adenocarcinomas was confirmed by using IHC staining with an anti-HPR1-specific polyclonal antiserum (22Fairbanks M.B.

As shown in Fig. 2, HPR1 was not expressed in normal ductal cells and acinar cells derived from normal pancreatic tissues (A) nor in a cystic adenoma (B). However, HPR1 was abundantly expressed in the cytoplasm of duct cells of a primary adenocarcinoma (C) and a pancreatic tumor metastasis in the duodenum (D). No HPR1 signal was detected in the nucleus of pancreatic tumor cells as previously reported in other types of gastrointestinal malignancies (23Takaoka M. Naomoto Y. Ohkawa T. Uetsuka H. Shirakawa Y.

Normal pancreatic ductal epithelial cells and acinar cells in the vicinity of the pancreatic tumors were HPR1-negative. A HPR1-negative pancreatic adenocarcinoma was shown in Fig. 2E. Normal rabbit serum included as a negative control (F) did not give any signal. Fifty-two primary adenocarcinomas and five metastases were assessed for HPR1 expression by using IHC staining (Table 1). Among them, 31 of 52 primary (63%) and 4 of 5 metastasis samples were HPR1-positive, which is defined as at least 10% of tumor cells with moderate or strong HPR1 signals in tumor cells. Thirty-seven samples were examined for HPR1 expression by using both IF and IHC staining. The overall concordance by these two methods was 73% (Table 2). The discrepancy in HPR1 expression detected by these two antibodies could result from their differential affinity or different sensitivity of the detection methods.TABLE 2Comparison of HPR1 expression detected by IF and IHCNumberHPR1-positive (IF)Concordance%HPR1-positive (IHC)242188HPR1-negative (IHC)13654 Open table in a new tab HS Analysis in the BM of Pancreatic Adenocarcinomas—We next analyzed the HS content in the BM of pancreatic cancer by using IF staining with a monoclonal antibody (clone HepSS) specific for HS. As shown in Fig. 3, HS deposition was abundantly present in the BM of a benign cyst adenoma (A) and two HPR1-negative adenocarcinomas (C and E) but was absent in the BM of two HPR1-positive adenocarcinomas (B and D). Normal mouse IgM was included as a negative control, showing that there was no nonspecific staining (F). Twenty-two of 31 (71%) primary pancreatic adenocarcinomas and four of four metastases lacked HSPG deposition in the BM of the tumor ducts. Nine pancreatic adenocarcinomas with moderate to high fluorescence signals specific for HS surrounding the BM of at least 20% ducts were graded as HS-positive (Table 3).TABLE 3HPR1 expression detected by IHC inversely correlates with HS deposition in the BM (p < 0.001)NumberHS-positiveHPR1-positive Primary232 (9%) Metastases30 (0%) Total262 (8%)HPR1-negative Primary87 (89%) Metastases10 (0%) Total97 (78%) Open table in a new tab We next explored the relationship of HS deposition in the BM and HPR1 expression analyzed by IHC with an anti-HPR1 rabbit serum as described in the legend to Fig. 2. As shown in Table 3, 21 of 23 HPR1-positive primary adenocarcinomas and three of three HPR1-positive metastases did not have HS deposition in the BM, whereas seven of eight HPR1-negative primary adenocarcinomas had intact HS deposition. χ2 analysis revealed that HPR1 expression inversely correlated with the presence of HSPG in pancreatic adenocarcinomas (p < 0.05), suggesting that HPR1 plays a critical role in degrading heparan sulfate in the BM. Cell Surface HS Degradation by HPR1—Previous studies have demonstrated that glypican-1, a heparan sulfate proteoglycan overexpressed in pancreatic adenocarcinoma and pancreatic tumor cell lines, contains little or no HS side chain (6Kleeff J. Ishiwata T. Kumbasar A. Friess H. Buchler M.W. Lander A.D. Korc M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1662-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). We postulate that the lack of HS in the glypican-1-overexpressed pancreatic cancer cell lines is due to the degradation of HS by increased HPR1 expression. To address this issue, we tested whether HPR1 expression inversely correlated with cell surface HS expression. We first analyzed HPR1 activity in the conditioned media and cell lysates of five pancreatic cancer cell lines. As shown in Fig. 4A, HPR1 activity was detected at relatively higher levels in COLO587, PANC-1, and MPANC-96 cells than in HPAF-II and CAPAN-1 cells in both conditioned media and cell lysates We next conducted flow cytometric analysis to examine cell surface HS expression. As shown in Fig. 4B, cell surface HS levels were higher in CAPAN-1, HPAF-II, and MPANC96 cells than that in COLO587 and PANC-1 cells. Cell surface HS levels inversely correlated with HPR1 activity, in particular, of the supernatants of pancreatic cancer cell lines. Similar results were obtained when cell surface HS levels were analyzed by a second anti-HS mAb (clone F58-10E4) (data not shown). Therefore, it is less likely that differential HS levels detected by anti-HS mAb are due to the different structures. To determine whether HPR1 expressed in pancreatic cancer cell lines was responsible for the lack of cell surface HS, we tested whether two HPR1 inhibitors, heparin and PI-88, were able to block HPR1-mediated degradation of cell surface HS. As shown in Fig. 4C, HS was not detected in untreated PANC-1 cells but was increased in the cells treated either with PI-88 or heparin in a dose-dependent manner. HS levels in PANC-1 cells treated with PI-88 or heparin (80 μg/ml each) were significantly higher than PI-88 or heparin at concentrations of 20 and 5 μg/ml. To further confirm the role of HPR1 in degrading cell surface HS, we tested whether modulation of HPR1 expression by a genetic approach affected HPR1 expression. Our laboratory has previously generated several HT1080 transfectant cell lines in which HPR1 is overexpressed or suppressed by HPR1 sense or antisense gene expression, respectively (17Xu X. Quiros R.M. Maxhimer J.B. Jiang P. Marcinek R. Ain K.B. Platt J.L. Shen J. Gattuso P. Prinz R.A. Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 5968-5979PubMed Google Scholar). Western blot was not able to detect basal HPR1 expression in pcDNA3.1 empty vector-transfected HT1080 cells, probably due to the low affinity of anti-HPR1 antibody (a band present between 50- and 65-kDa HPR1 isoforms was nonspecific). HPR1 down-regulation in HPR1 antisense-transfected HT1080 cells could not confirmed by Western blot. In contrast, Western blot analysis revealed HPR1 overexpression in HPR1-transfected cells (Fig. 5A). Consistently, FACS analysis revealed that HPR1 expression was detected on the cell surface by a monoclonal (Fig. 5B, top) and polyclonal anti-HPR1 antibody (Fig. 5B, bottom). Again, cell surface HPR1 expression was not detected by these two anti-HPR1 antibodies either in pcDNA- and pcDNA/HPR1-AS-transfected cells. We next tested whether modulation of HPR1 expression affected cell surface HS levels in these HT1080 transfectant cell lines. As shown in Fig. 5C, pcDNA3.1-transfected cells moderately expressed HS on the cell surface. However, cell surface HS levels were much higher in HPR1 antisense-transfected cells and dramatically reduced in HPR1-transfected cells. Effect of HPR1 Expression on Pancreatic Cancer Cell Proliferation—Previous studies have shown that HSPG expression on the cell surface of pancreatic cancer cell lines can enhance FGF2-mediated cell proliferation (6Kleeff J.

Northern blot analysis and <i>in situ</i> hybridization indicate that the three paralogs display distinct developmental and tissue-specific expression. The physiological role of Golgi α1,2-mannosidase IB was investigated by targeted gene ablation. The null mice have normal gross appearance at birth, but they display respiratory distress and die within a few hours. Histology of fetal lungs the day before birth indicate some delay in development, whereas neonatal lungs show extensive pulmonary hemorrhage in the alveolar region. No significant histopathological changes occur in other tissues. No remarkable ultrastructural differences are detected between wild type and null lungs. The membranes of a subset of bronchiolar epithelial cells are stained with lectins from <i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i> (leukoagglutinin and erythroagglutinin) and <i>Datura stramonium</i> in wild type lungs, but this staining disappears in lungs from null mice. Mass spectrometry of <i>N</i>-glycans from different tissues shows no significant changes in global <i>N</i>-glycans of null mice. Therefore, only a few glycoproteins required for normal lung function depend on α1,2-mannosidase IB for maturation. There are no apparent differences in the expression of several lung epithelial cell and endothelial cell markers between null and wild type mice.

https://openalex.org/W1541817109,"RBCK1 (RBCC protein interacting with PKC 1) has originally been identified as a protein kinase CβI (PKCβI)-binding partner by a two-hybrid screen and as one of the gene transcripts that increases during adult cardiac hypertrophy. To address whether RBCK1 and PKCβI functions are interconnected, we used cultured neonatal myocytes where we previously found that the activity of PKCβI is required for an increase in cell size, also called hypertrophy. In this study, we showed that acute treatment of cardiac myocytes with phenylephrine, a prohypertrophic stimulant, transiently increased the association of RBCK1 with PKCβI within 1 min. A prolonged phenylephrine treatment also resulted in an increase of the interaction of the two proteins. Endogenous RBCK1 protein levels increased upon phenylephrine-induced hypertrophy. Further, adenovirus-based RBCK1 overexpression in the absence of phenylephrine increased cardiac cell size. This RBCK1-mediated hypertrophy required PKCβ activity, since the increase in cell size was inhibited when the RBCK1-expressing cells were treated with PKCβ-selective antagonists, supporting our previous observation that both PKCβI and PKCβII are required for hypertrophy. Unexpectedly, RBCK1-induced increased cell size was inhibited by phenylephrine. This effect correlated with a decrease in the level of both PKCβ isoforms. Most importantly, RNA interference for RBCK1 significantly inhibited the increase in cell size of cardiac myocytes following phenylephrine treatment. Our results suggest that RBCK1 binds PKCβI and is a key regulator of PKCβI function in cells and that, together with PKCβII, the three proteins are essential for developmental hypertrophy of cardiac myocytes.

Anderson W.B. Cooper H.L. Sando J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13193-13196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PKC activation depends on phosphatidylserine and diacylglycerol and to different extents on calcium and other lipid second messengers. Translocation of PKC to the particulate fraction was initially thought to reflect direct association of the enzyme with membrane lipids. However, such association cannot solely reflect the diverse subcellular location of each inactive and active PKC isozyme. Data from several laboratories indicate that the functional selectivity of individual PKC isozymes is determined, at least in part, by protein-protein interactions. Different types of PKC-interacting proteins have been described, including several AKAP scaffold proteins (2Klauck T.M. Faux M.C. Labudda K. Langeberg L.K. Jaken S. Scott J.D.

Furthermore, upon activation, PKCβII associates with RACK1 prior to their movement to the active site of PKCβII, suggesting a role for RACK1 as a shuttle protein (27Ron D. Jiang Z. Yao L. Vagts A.

Finally, RICKs (receptors for inactive C kinase) were also postulated to inhibit and sequester PKC isozymes prior to their activation (28Mochly-Rosen D. Gordon A.S. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). Here, we describe a PKCβI-interacting protein, RBCK1, and the functional consequences of this interaction in neonatal cardiac myocytes. RBCK1 has previously been identified as a PKC-binding partner by a yeast two-hybrid system using the regulatory domain of PKCβI as bait (29Tokunaga C. Kuroda S. Tatematsu K. Nakagawa N. Ono Y. Kikkawa U. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). RBCK1 is a 498-amino acid protein containing two coiled-coil regions, a RING finger, a B-box, and a B-box-like motif. RBCK1 was reported to interact with PKCβI when they are co-expressed in COS-7 cells (29Tokunaga C. Kuroda S. Tatematsu K. Nakagawa N. Ono Y. Kikkawa U. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

We set out to characterize the interaction of RBCK1 with PKCβI in primary heart cells in culture. The choice of this culture stems from our earlier finding that PKCβ function is required for the increase in cardiac myocyte cell size, a process termed hypertrophy (15Stebbins E.G. Mochly-Rosen D.

Unlike other organs, the number of muscle cells in the myocardium increases only slightly after birth, but cell size increases after development and accounts for the increase in heart mass. Some of the molecular events involved in the development of pathophysiological hypertrophy recapitulate the neonatal developmental program of the heart. We previously found that the peptides βIV5-3 and βIIV5-3, specific translocation inhibitors of PKCβI and PKCβII, respectively, inhibit phorbol ester-induced hypertrophy, indicating a role for PKCβ in the molecular events leading to developmental cardiac hypertrophy (15Stebbins E.G.

Moreover, 14- or 7-day treatments with angiotensin II or isoproterenol, respectively, induced cardiac hypertrophy and an increase in RBCK1 mRNA levels in mice (34Friddle C.J. Koga T. Rubin E.M.

We therefore used myocyte hypertrophy to determine whether PKCβ-RBCK1 interaction occurs and has functional consequences in the response of heart cells in culture to the prohypertrophic stimulus, phenylephrine. Phenylephrine, like many other G protein-coupled receptor agonists, including isoproterenol and angiotensin II, has been shown to induce cardiac hypertrophy through the activation of PKC (35Simpson P. Circ. Res. 1985; 56: 884-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 36Bueno O.F. Molkentin J.D. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 776-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Materials—(R)-(–)-Phenylephrine hydrochloride, protease inhibitor mixture, and phosphatase inhibitor mixtures were from Sigma. Fetal bovine serum was from Hyclone. Monoclonal antibody against green fluorescent protein (GFP) was from Roche Applied Science. pcc206 and pcc139 plasmids were a gift from Dr. C. Chartier. The cDNA clones coding for RBCK splicing variants and pGEX-4T1 recombinant vectors were provided by Dr. Kuroda (Osaka University, Japan). Rabbit antibodies directed against PKCβI, PKCβII, and protein G-agarose beads were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Phospho-(Ser)PKC substrate antibody, phosphothreonine antibody (Thr(P)-polyclonal), and phosphothreonine-X-arginine antibody were purchased from Cell Signaling. The cardiomyocyte isolation kit was purchased from Cellutron. Anti-mouse IgG and anti-rabbit IgG, peroxidase-linked species-specific whole antibodies, were from Amersham Biosciences. Anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase antibody, clone 6C5, was from Advanced Immunochemical. The antagonist peptides were synthesized by American Peptides. The Label IT siRNA tracker intracellular localization kit was from Mirus (Madison, WI). Stealth RNAi were synthesized by Invitrogen. Production of Anti-RBCK1 Antibody—Rabbit polyclonal antibody specific for the RBCK1 splicing variant that recognizes an amino acid sequence located in the C terminus of the protein (amino acids 420–434; CTEMLRVMLQ(Q/H)GEAMY) were produced by Covance. Adenovirus Construction—The RBCK1 gene in vector pTB701 was cloned and ligated downstream of the cytomegalovirus early gene promoter into the recombination intermediate plasmid pcc206. Recombination with the adenoviral plasmid pcc139 and production replication-defective adenovirus were performed according to a standard procedure. RBCK1 was expressed as a GFP fusion protein. The adenovirus encoding for GFP was used as a control. Isolation and Infection of Rat Neonatal Cardiac Myocytes—Care of rats in this investigation conforms to Ref. 57National Institutes of HealthGuide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD1996Google Scholar. Cardiac myocytes were isolated as previously described from 1-day-old Sprague-Dawley rat litters (37Johnson J.A. Gray M.O. Karliner J.S. Chen C.H. Mochly-Rosen D. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 1086-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) or by using the cardiomyocyte isolation kit from Cellutron. Cardiac myocytes represent 90–95% of total adherent cells. Cells were maintained in Eagle's minimal essential medium with Earle's balanced salt solution (containing 50 units/ml penicillin, 80 μm vitamin B12, 0.1 mm bromodeoxyuridine, and 80 μm vitamin C) with 10% serum after plating. For all of the experiments, cells were transferred in serum-free medium (Eagle's minimal essential medium with Earle's balanced salt solution containing 10 μg/ml insulin, 10 μg/ml transferrin, 80 μm vitamin C, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 80 μm vitamin B12) on day 3. Infections were performed on day 3 at a multiplicity of infection of 5. Twenty-four hours after the infection, the medium containing the adenovirus was removed and replaced by fresh serum-free medium. Phenylephrine was added at this time for the 48-h prolonged treatment. RNA Interference Knockdown and Reverse Transcription-PCR—Stealth RNAi molecules were designed using the Invitrogen site on the World Wide Web and transfected into cardiac myocytes with TransIT-TKO transfection reagent following the recommended protocol (Mirus). Stealth RNAi transfection efficiency was determined by visualizing labeled stealth RNAi in cells. Transfected cells with stealth RNAi labeled or not were recovered for 24 h, serum-starved, and treated with the hypertrophic agent phenylephrine. The time course of the knockdown in RBCK1 expression was identified after isolating the RNA and performing reverse transcription-PCR or protein blots after transfections of the stealth RNAi. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used as a standard. The primer sequences were as follows: RBCK1, GGAGGCGCTGCGCCAGTATGA (forward) and CAGGGGACAGGAGCGCCCGGA (reverse) to amplify a 310-bp product; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, CCAGTATGATTCTACCCACGGC (forward) and CGGAGATGATGACCCTTTTGGC (reverse) to amplify a 141-bp product. Cell Size Determination of Cultured Rat Neonatal Cardiac Myocytes—Myocytes overexpressing GFP or GFP-RBCK1 were photographed at ×63 magnification, and the single cell size was determined using PhotoShop software by outlining the cell periphery and measuring pixel number. For each measurement, all GFP-expressing myocytes in one chamber and an equal amount of myocytes in the GFP-RBCK1-expressing chamber were counted. The effect of RBCK1 knockdown was assessed on cardiac myocytes that were not overexpressing GFP. Phase-contrast pictures of these cells were taken using ×63 magnification, and cell size was determined. Delivery of Peptide—The PKCβIV5-3- and PKCβIIV5-3-selective antagonist peptides derived from PKCβI and PKCβII sequences (KLFIMNL and QEVIRNN, respectively) were conjugated to the TAT-(47–57) carrier peptide for transmembrane delivery as previously described (38Chen L. Wright L.R. Chen C.H. Oliver S.F. Wender P.A. Mochly-Rosen D. Chem. Biol. 2001; 8: 1123-1129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The TAT-(47–57) peptide was used as a control. All peptides were delivered three times every 4 h on day 4 (660 nm/each) and day 5 (330 nm). On day 6, the peptides were added 1 h prior to the cell lysis (330 nm). Immunoprecipitation Experiments and Western Blot Analysis—On day 6, cardiac myocytes infected with adenoviruses encoding for GFP or GFP-RBCK1 constructs were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1:300 protease inhibitor mixture, 1:300 phosphatase inhibitor mixture) for 30 min at 4 °C by gentle rocking. Myocytes were then scraped, disrupted by repeated aspiration through a 21-gauge needle, and collected in microcentrifuge tubes. Lysates were incubated with 20 μl of protein G-agarose beads for 30 min at 4 °C by gentle rocking and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were collected, mixed with the anti-PKC or anti-GFP antibody (2 μg), and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. Twenty microliters of protein G-agarose beads were then added, and the samples were incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were washed three times with 1 ml of lysis buffer. Immunocomplexes were resuspended in 50 μl of Laemmli buffer, loaded on SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were probed with the indicated antibody followed by visualization by ECL. The phosphorylation of RBCK1 was determined using the mixture of anti-phosphoserine and phosphothreonine antibodies listed under “Materials.” The amount of phosphorylated RBCK1 was corrected to the amount of immunoprecipitated RBCK1. Translocation of PKCβI—After acute treatment with phenylephrine, cardiac myocytes were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, scraped in homogenization buffer, and spun at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatants correspond to the soluble fractions. The pellets were resuspended in homogenization buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and spun at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatants correspond to the particulate fractions. RBCK1 Binds PKCβI in Rat Neonatal Cardiac Myocytes: Transient Interaction upon Acute Treatment with Phenylephrine—When co-expressed in COS-7 cells, RBCK1 bound preferentially to PKCβI (29Tokunaga C. Kuroda S. Tatematsu K. Nakagawa N. Ono Y. Kikkawa U. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Based on these data, we first set out to determine whether RBCK1 binds PKCβI in neonatal cardiac myocytes and whether PKC activation with phenylephrine regulates their interaction. To this end, GFP-fused RBCK1 was overexpressed using adenovirus-mediated gene transfer. Greater than 95% of cells expressed the full-length RBCK1-GFP within 24 h after infection. The interaction between RBCK1 and PKCβI was assessed by immunoprecipitating endogenous PKCβI using an anti-PKCβI antibody followed by Western blot analysis of the immunoprecipitates with an anti-GFP antibody. Although similar amounts of endogenous PKCβI were immunoprecipitated (Fig. 1A), the amounts of RBCK1-GFP co-immunoprecipitated with PKCβI increased after a 1-min treatment with 5 μm phenylephrine followed by a decline 3 min after stimulation (Fig. 1, A and B). The kinetics of association correlated with that of PKCβI translocation to the cell particulate fraction and PKCβI transiently translocated within 1 min of phenylephrine treatment (Fig. 1C). These results demonstrate that activation of PKCβI with phenylephrine is associated with an increased binding to RBCK1. Note that because endogenous RBCK1 has a molecular weight that is close to that of the IgG, we carried out immunoprecipitation experiments from cross-linked cardiac myocyte lysates. Unfortunately, after this procedure, our antibodies did not recognize PKCβI or RBCK1. We were therefore unable to analyze the binding of PKCβI to endogenous RBCK1. Increased Interaction between PKCβI and RBCK1 after Prolonged Phenylephrine Treatment—Prolonged treatment of cardiac myocytes with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate or phenylephrine causes increased cell size, which was shown to be dependent on PKCβ activation (15Stebbins E.G. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29644-29650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). We therefore set out to determine whether a prolonged treatment of cultured myocytes with phenylephrine modulates the interaction between endogenous PKCβI and overexpressed RBCK1. Under basal conditions, a small amount of RBCK1 was seen to co-immunoprecipitate with endogenous PKCβI, and the interaction between both proteins increased after 48-h treatment with phenylephrine (Fig. 2A). An increased amount of PKCβI was co-immunoprecipitated with RBCK1 upon prolonged phenylephrine treatment as well (Fig. 2B). Finally, RBCK1 did not co-immunoprecipitate with endogenous PKCβII (Fig. 2C), a splicing variant of PKCβII that differs only in the last 50 amino acids. RBCK1 did not co-immunoprecipitate either with PKCζ (Fig. 2D), an isozyme previously shown to interact with RBCK1 when co-expressed in COS cells (29Tokunaga C. Kuroda S. Tatematsu K. Nakagawa N. Ono Y. Kikkawa U. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). When PKCζ was successfully immunoprecipitated from rat neonatal cardiac myocytes treated without or with phenylephrine (5 μm for 48 h), RBCK1 did not co-immunoprecipitate with this isozyme (data not shown). Therefore, our data show that RBCK1 preferentially interacts with PKCβI in rat neonatal cardiac myocytes upon prolonged phenylephrine treatment. We then set out to determine the phosphorylation state of RBCK1 following phenylephrine treatment and whether the phosphorylation of RBCK1 is increased relative to the basal condition. Western blot analysis of immunoprecipitated phospho-RBCK1-GFP with a mixture of anti-phosphoserine and phospho-threonine Ser/Thr antibodies showed that RBCK1 is phosphorylated in cardiac myocyte and that, upon phenylephrine treatment, RBCK1 phosphorylation increased by 48% at 1 min and 73% at 48 h (representative data of three independent experiments, expressed as phosphoprotein (top) over total immunoprecipitated RBCK1 protein (bottom); Fig. 2E). Our data demonstrate that the increased association of RBCK1 with PKCβI observed following both acute (Fig. 1) and 48-h (Fig. 2A) treatment with phenylephrine is correlated with an increased phosphorylation of RBCK1. RBCK1 Protein Levels Increase during Hypertrophy—Although two gene expression profiling studies have demonstrated changes of RBCK1 mRNA levels in association with cardiac hypertrophy (34Friddle C.J.

Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 798-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), no data were provided on whether the protein levels were also altered. Using RBCK1 antiserum, raised against the C-terminal amino acids 420–434, we found that the endogenous RBCK1 protein was present in cultured neonatal myocytes. Most importantly, the level of endogenous RBCK1 increased by 2-fold in the presence of the hypertrophic stimulus (phenylephrine, 5 μm, 48 h) (Fig. 3). PKCβ Is Required for RBCK1-induced Increase of Cell Size—We showed a correlation between an increase of RBCK1 protein levels and myocyte hypertrophy, but evidence of direct causality has not been established. Therefore, we next determined whether increased RBCK1 protein level mediates the development of myocyte hypertrophy or whether it is a consequence of this phenotype. Again, we used RBCK1-GFP overexpression. One hallmark of hypertrophy is increased cell surface area. The GFP tag enabled us to focus only on live beating cells (i.e. cardiac myocytes that express the transgenes). As shown in Fig. 4A, the quantification of several independent experiments demonstrated a significant increase in cell surface area when RBCK1 was overexpressed (153%; lane 5 versus lane 1). Fig. 4B, which shows representative pictures of control and RBCK1-overexpressing cells, demonstrates the differences described. Overexpression of RBCK1 was therefore sufficient to increase the cell size of cardiac myocytes in the absence of phenylephrine. The mechanism whereby overexpression of RBCK1 promotes cardiac myocyte hypertrophy is unknown. However, PKCβ was previously reported to mediate cardiac hypertrophy (15Stebbins E.G. Mochly-Rosen D. J.

Circulation. 1999; 99: 334-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and our results showed that RBCK1 interacts with PKCβI in cardiac myocytes (Figs. 1 and 2). Based on these data, we hypothesized that the RBCK1 pathway may involve PKCβ. Therefore, we set out to measure cell size in cardiac myocytes overexpressing RBCK1 after delivery of either PKCβI- or PKCβII-selective antagonist. The cell surface area of myocytes overexpressing RBCK1 and treated with the PKCβI- or PKCβII-selective inhibitors was significantly smaller than untreated myocytes overexpressing RBCK1 (Fig. 4A, lanes 7 and 8 versus lane 5) and comparable with the cell surface area of myocytes overexpressing GFP as a control (Fig. 4A, lanes 7 and 8 versus lane 1). Representative images are shown in Fig. 4B. In conclusion, βIV5-3 and βIIV5-3 peptides inhibited the effects of RBCK1-induced increase in cell size, suggesting that both PKCβ isozymes are critical downstr"
https://openalex.org/W2062820206,"<i>Dictyostelium</i> strains lacking the F-actin cross-linking protein filamin (ddFLN) have a severe phototaxis defect at the multicellular slug stage. Filamins are rod-shaped homodimers that cross-link the actin cytoskeleton into highly viscous, orthogonal networks. Each monomer chain of filamin is comprised of an F-actin-binding domain and a rod domain. In rescue experiments only intact filamin re-established correct phototaxis in filamin minus mutants, whereas C-terminally truncated filamin proteins that had lost the dimerization domain and molecules lacking internal repeats but retaining the dimerization domain did not rescue the phototaxis defect. Deletion of individual rod repeats also changed their subcellular localization, and mutant filamins in general were less enriched at the cell cortex as compared with the full-length protein and were increasingly present in the cytoplasm. For correct phototaxis ddFLN is only required at the tip of the slug because expression under control of the cell type-specific extracellular-matrix protein A (ecmA) promoter and mixing experiments with wild type cells supported phototactic orientation. Likewise, in chimeric slugs wild type cells were primarily found at the tip of the slug, which acts as an organizer in <i>Dictyostelium</i> morphogenesis."

Human SWI/SNF (hSWI/SNF) 2The abbreviations used are: hSWI/SNF, human SWI/SNF complex; MNase, micrococcal nuclease; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift analysis. is an evolutionarily conserved chromatin remodeling complex that can use the energy of ATP hydrolysis to structurally alter nucleosomes or change their positions on DNA (for reviews, see Refs. 1Martens J.A.

Some of the effects of hSWI/SNF (such as restriction enzyme accessibility) are primarily transient, requiring continued action of the complex. Other hSWI/SNF effects, including changes in nucleosome positions and structures, are stable after removal of hSWI/SNF or ATP from the reaction. First, we and others have shown that hSWI/SNF stably alters nucleosome positions on polynucleosomal arrays and mononucleosomes (10Ramachandran A. Omar M. Cheslock P. Schnitzler G.R. J. Biol.

Second, hSWI/SNF acts in a catalytic manner to generate structurally altered nucleosomes. On mononucleosomal templates hSWI/SNF can connect two mononucleosomes together in an altered noncovalent dimer, which can be readily isolated and characterized (13Schnitzler G.R. Cheung C.L. Hafner J.H. Saurin A.J. Kingston R.E. Lieber C.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8504-8511Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 14Schnitzler G. Sif S. Kingston R.E. Cell. 1998; 94: 17-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). A conserved function for altered dimers in eukaryotic transcriptional regulation is highlighted by the ability of the related yeast RSC complex to form indistinguishable dimeric products (15Lorch Y. Cairns B.R. Zhang M. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1998; 94: 29-34Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Altered dimers formed from mononucleosomes bearing a central binding site for the Gal4 transcription factor or RAG recombination proteins had a higher affinity for these factors than normal nucleosomes (13Schnitzler G.R. Cheung C.L. Hafner J.H. Saurin A.J. Kingston R.E. Lieber C.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8504-8511Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 16Kwon J. Morshead K.B. Guyon J.R. Kingston R.E. Oettinger M.A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1037-1048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), suggesting that dimers or similar structures might function to facilitate factor access in chromatin. It was unclear from these studies, however, whether altered dimers were more accessible only in the centers of the nucleosomal templates used to form them, or if they represented a generally more accessible nucleosomal species. Each normal nucleosome constrains one negative supercoil of DNA, and hSWI/SNF action stably reduces the number of constrained negative supercoils held by closed-circular plasmid chromatin (14Schnitzler G. Sif S. Kingston R.E. Cell. 1998; 94: 17-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 17Kwon H. Imbalzano A.N. Khavari P.A. Kingston R.E. Green M.R. Nature. 1994; 370: 477-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). This reduced supercoiling is not due to histone loss, but to the formation of metastable altered nucleosomal structures, because it reverts to normal on a time scale of several hours even in the presence of competitor DNA that would sequester any histones that might have been removed during remodeling (18Guyon J.R. Narlikar G.J. Sullivan E.K. Kingston R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1132-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Evidence that hSWI/SNF forms structurally altered nucleosomes on polynucleosomes also comes from our atomic force microscopy experiments, where hSWI/SNF-remodeled polynucleosomes were less stable to surface deposition when unfixed than control polynucleosomes (13Schnitzler G.R. Cheung C.L. Hafner J.H. Saurin A.J. Kingston R.E. Lieber C.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8504-8511Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). More recently, we found that hSWI/SNF converts ∼30% of adjacent pairs of nucleosomes on polynucleosomal arrays into altered dinucleosomes called “altosomes” (19Ulyanova N.P. Schnitzler G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 11156-11170Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). These products appear to be responsible for the reduced negative supercoiling observed on plasmid chromatin, because both effects are of similar magnitude and revert to normal at the same rate. Unfortunately, because altosomes only form on polynucleosomal DNA we have been unable to isolate a pure population of altosomes associated with specific DNA sequences. As a result the potential function of hSWI/SNF-generated altosomes in regulating transcription factor accessibility is unknown. Here we further examine the properties of altered mononucleosome dimers formed by hSWI/SNF action. We find that the accessibility of the DNA in altered dimers for Gal4 binding is the opposite of that for normal mononucleosome cores: highest in the middle of the template and lowest at the ends. We also find that altered dimers revert to normal mononucleosomes similarly to altosomes formed on polynucleosomes. This observation, together with other shared properties, suggests that dimers and altosomes have similar structures. These results help inform models for altered dimer as well as altosome structures and suggest potential functional properties of altered hSWI/SNF product nucleosomes. Proteins—Human SWI/SNF was isolated by affinity chromatography from HeLa cells expressing a FLAG-tagged Ini1/hSNF5 hSWI/SNF subunit (14Schnitzler G. Sif S. Kingston R.E. Cell. 1998; 94: 17-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Note that this purification method results in hSWI/SNF complexes that contain one of two possible catalytic ATPase subunits, BRG1 (the most abundant) or hBRM. In general, BRG1 and hBRM complexes have similar in vivo functions and in vitro activities, although some differences have been noted (for review, see Ref. 20Wang W. Curr. Top. Microbiol.

They were generated as modifications to the pTPT plasmid (14Schnitzler G. Sif S. Kingston R.E. Cell. 1998; 94: 17-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). For TPGal41-HXh, the sequences between the HindIII and XhoI sites on pTPT were replaced with double-stranded oligos so that the final sequence reads AAGCTTCAGCTGCGGAGTACTGTCCTCCGAGCTCGAG. Similarly, for TPGal42-SH the sequences between SpeI and HindIII were changed to read ACTAGTCCATGGGCGGAGTACTGTCCTCCGAGCGGAGTACTGTCCTCCGAAGCTT, and for TPGal42-HXb the sequences between HindIII and XbaI were changed to read AAGCTTCAGCTGCGGAGTACTGTCCTCCGAGCGGAGTACTGTCCTCCGCACTGTCTAGA. 155-bp mononucleosome templates were generated by restriction digestion of the appropriate plasmid or of a PCR-generated fragment made from the plasmid using flanking primers. These templates were end-labeled by Klenow fill in of their 5′ overhanging ends using [α-32P]dATP and cold dT, G, and CTP, assembled with HeLa cell core histones by salt dilution, and purified by glycerol gradient ultracentrifugation as described previously (23Imbalzano A.N.

Templates of varied lengths were generated using a forward PCR primer beginning at the CGCGT of the MluI site of pTPT and various reverse primers to generate 135-, 145-, 155-, and 195-bp products.

Given the ratio of labeled and unlabeled input cores, almost all labeled dimers will contain one labeled template DNA and one heterogeneous nucleosome-length stretch of human genomic DNA. This means, for instance, that dimers formed from TPGal41-AH will contain only one Gal4 site. After 1–2 h at 30 °C the reactions were removed to ice and the concentration of KCl was raised to 180 or 240 mm to reduce the amount of hSWI/SNF binding to cores and dimers, and products were separated by either 4.5% PAGE at 4 °C, or by glycerol gradient ultracentrifugation, as above but with glycerol gradient buffer supplemented with 180 mm KCl. Note that, whereas this high concentration of salt can accelerate dimer reversion at 30 °C, no appreciable reversion was seen for gradient fractions maintained at 4 °C. For purification from PAGE, bands containing cores and dimers were eluted from gel slices at 4 °C into 2 volumes of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, and 150 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. Diagnostic hSWI/SNF remodeling assays were typically performed in 25-μl reactions containing 0.3 ng (0.15 nm) of labeled cores or dimers, 100–200 ng of affinity purified hSWI/SNF (2–4 nm), and buffer conditions as described for the preparative reactions, except that reactions from experiments examining the effects of Gal4 also contained 1 μm ZnCl2. For control reactions, hSWI/SNF or ATP/MgCl2 were omitted. Reactions were incubated for 1 h at 30°C, and then 2 μg of plasmid DNA and 0.5 μg of HeLa cell polynucleosomes were added to stop the reaction and remove hSWI/SNF from the labeled template before PAGE to resolve nucleosomal hSWI/SNF products. Any significant departures from these conditions are noted in the figure legends. Restriction Enzyme Accessibility Assays—50 units of HindIII or PstI were added to diagnostic hSWI/SNF remodeling reactions. After 3 h at 30°C, reactions were stopped by addition of SDS to 1%, EDTA to 33 mm, and Proteinase K to 0.67 μg/ml followed by incubation at 37 °C for 3 h and 5% PAGE. Micrococcal Nuclease (MNase) Digestion Analysis—Gradient-isolated TPT cores or dimers were digested with a titration of MNase (Roche unit definition) for 30 min at 30 °C in 50 μl standard remodeling reactions lacking ATP but containing 3.2 mm CaCl2. 12.5 μl of each reaction was stopped by addition of 2 μg of plasmid DNA and immediately resolved by 5% native PAGE. The remainder was adjusted to 100 μl with 15 mm EDTA, extracted with phenol, EtOH precipitated, and separated by 8% denaturing PAGE (14Schnitzler G. Sif S. Kingston R.E. Cell. 1998; 94: 17-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Gal4 Binding Assays—20 μl of electrophoretic mobility shift analysis (EMSA) (gel shift) reactions for Gal4 binding typically contained no more than 0.3 ng of purified labeled cores or dimers (≤0.15 nm), the indicated concentration of Gal4-(1–94) or Gal4-AH, 50 ng of cold HeLa cell mononucleosome cores, and 500 ng of poly(dI-dC) as nonspecific competitors in a buffer composed of 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 7 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.5 mm EDTA, 60 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 150 ng/μl of bovine serum albumin, 1 μm ZnCl2, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.4 mm dithiothreitol. Binding was allowed to proceed for 30 min at 30 °C before 4.5% PAGE. Departures from these standard conditions are noted in the text and figure legends. Footprinting reactions were done under the same conditions, but in 100-μl reactions containing only 0.8 ng/μl of cold mononucleosome cores as competitor and 3 mm MgCl2. DNase digestion, sample purification, and denaturing electrophoresis were done as described in Ref. 14Schnitzler G. Sif S. Kingston R.E. Cell. 1998; 94: 17-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar. Dissociation constants (Kd value) were determined as follows. Unbound and bound species were quantitated from PhosphorImager exposures using ImageQuant, and the ratio of bound/free plotted against the concentration of Gal4 protein. When necessary, signals were adjusted by subtracting any background due to co-migrating Gal4-bound bare DNA, which was calculated as (background at [Gal4]) = (bare DNA counts in control dimer/core lane) × (fraction of counts at the same gel shift position in the bare DNA lane at [Gal4]). For footprinting reactions, the fraction bound was calculated as being 1 – (ix – ibkg)/(i0 – ibkg), where ix, i0, and ibkg are the signal intensities in the footprinted region of the sample lane, the no Gal4 control lane for either cores or dimers, and the fully bound bare DNA control. Because the concentration of Gal4-site template in these reactions is 0.15 nm or less (0.3 ng/20 μl of a 100-kDa labeled DNA), Gal4 binding to the template does not significantly reduce the amount of free Gal4 in reactions containing ≥1 nm Gal4. This simplifies the analysis allowing apparent Kd to be measured as the inverse slope of the best fit line when [Gal4]input is plotted against [Gal4-bound template]/[unbound template]. Standard deviations in Kd values were calculated from the standard deviation in the slope of the line. Gal4 Binds More Poorly to an End-positioned Site in an Altered Mononucleosome Dimer—Our previous studies showed a 3–10-fold preference for dimers over cores in Gal4 binding to a site located at the center of two 155-bp mononucleosome templates ((14Schnitzler G. Sif S. Kingston R.E. Cell. 1998; 94: 17-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), pHGal41 and TPGal41-AH, see Fig. 1A for template maps). To determine whether dimers were generally more accessible than cores, we compared three 155-bp nucleosomal templates, each with a single 17-bp high affinity dimeric Gal4 site centered over a position 18, 45, or 72 bp from the right edge of the DNA (templates TPGal41-XX, -HXh, and -AH, respectively, see Fig. 1A). Each template was assembled into mononucleosome cores using HeLa core histones and step dilution, followed by glycerol gradient isolation (23Imbalzano A.N. Schnitzler G.R. Kingston R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20726-20733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Because the histone octamer covers ∼146 bp of DNA, each of these Gal4 sites will be inside the nucleosome (although the exact distance from each Gal4 site to a nucleosome entry/exit site may vary by up to 9 bp). For instance, on TPGal41-XX with an octamer formed as far to the right as possible, the center of the Gal4 site will be 18 bp in from the entry/exit site. If the octamer formed as far to the left as possible, the Gal4 site center would instead be 9 bp inside the nucleosome. After assembly, each template was remodeled by hSWI/SNF, and the normal mononucleosome cores as well as altered dimer products were separated by glycerol gradient ultracentrifugation (14Schnitzler G. Sif S. Kingston R.E. Cell. 1998; 94: 17-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). We then incubated nucleosome cores or altered dimers of each template with recombinant Gal4 DNA binding domain (Gal4-(1–94)) and/or the Gal4 DNA binding domain linked to an artificial amphipathic α-helix weak activation domain (Gal4-AH), followed by polyacrylamide gel EMSA. A representative example is shown in Fig. 1B. Consistent with our previous results, Gal4-AH binds poorly to the centrally located site on TPGal41-AH cores, but binds significantly better to the 1-AH altered dimer (7% to cores versus 33% to dimers at 50 nm, compare Fig. 1B, lanes 5 and 8). To our surprise, the opposite trend was seen for binding to the end-positioned site in TPGal41-XX (57% binding to cores at 50 nm versus 22% to dimers, compare Fig. 1B, lanes 13 and 16). Scatchard analysis to measure apparent Kd values indicated that Gal4 binds with an ∼6-fold higher affinity to AH dimers relative to AH cores but binds with an ∼4-fold lower affinity to XX dimers relative to XX cores (see Table 1, entries for Fig. 1B).TABLE 1Apparent Kd values for Gal4 binding to cores and dimers of different templatesTemplate/G4 siteaGal4 site location is given for the center of the dimeric Gal4 binding site relative to the EcoRI end of each template.CompetitorGal4Kd coreKd dimerPreferenceNotesng/μlTPGal41-AH/72 bp2.5 Nucleosomes, 25 poly(dI-dC)1-941126 ± 94 nm431 ± 39 nm2.6 × dimerFig.1EbKd derived from compiled data from 3 independent titration experiments.20 ICAH676 ± 102 nm102 ± 7 nm6.6 × dimerFig.1B0.8 NucleosomescFootprint assay results.1-9422.7 ± 1.4 nm8.8 ± 0.4 nm2.6 × dimerFig.1C and Ref. 14Schnitzler G.

Open table in a new tab Gal4 has some nonspecific binding affinity (as indicated by the multimers of Gal4 bound to bare DNA at high concentrations, e.g. Fig. 1B, lanes 2 and 10). Although the presence of the histone octamer is expected to eliminate most or all nonspecific binding, we nonetheless wished to confirm that the gel shift results represented Gal4 binding to its proper site. To do so, we performed DNase footprinting studies on reactions containing increasing concentrations of Gal4-AH (Fig. 1, C and D, and data not shown). Quantitation of the degree of Gal4 site protection from DNase showed that, as was seen in the EMSA analysis, Gal4-AH bound better to TPGal41-AH dimers than cores (∼3-fold), but bound worse to 1-XX dimers than cores (∼5-fold, see Table 1). Note that these EMSA and footprinting reactions were done under different nonspecific competitor DNA conditions. Because of its moderate sequence-independent binding activity, some Gal4 protein will be sequestered onto nonspecific competitor DNAs present in the reaction. Thus, as the concentration of nonspecific competitor DNA increases, the concentration of Gal4 needed for 50% binding to the specific template also increases, resulting in a higher apparent Kd. For instance, the apparent Kd values measured in the presence of 0.8 ng/μl of unlabeled bulk HeLa nucleosomes (e.g. Fig. 1, C and D) were ∼10-fold lower than those measured in the presence of 20 ng/μl of poly(dI-dC) (e.g. Fig. 1B, see Table 1). When no nonspecific competitor was used at all, the apparent Kd values were another ∼20-fold lower still (Table 1 and data not shown). Importantly, the same relative affinities were seen regardless of the competitor conditions or assay method: dimers were always preferred over cores ∼3–6-fold for the AH template, whereas cores were preferred over dimers ∼4–5-fold for the XX template. In addition, we found that Gal4-(1–94) and Gal4-AH always gave very similar results when compared under the same conditions, indicating that the affinity of Gal4 proteins for their sites on nucleosome cores and dimers is not influenced by attached activation domains (Table 1 and data not shown). Note that conditions in which there is a large molar excess of competitor DNA are similar in some ways to conditions in nuclei, where only a small fraction of available DNA sequences will be high affinity binding sites. Accordingly, the observation of a preference for centrally positioned sites in dimers and end-positioned sites in cores under a variety of competitor conditions suggests that this effect could be relevant for hSWI/SNF function in vivo. Using a standardized set of competitor conditions (2.5 ng/μl of unlabeled nucleosomes and 25 ng/μl of poly(dI-dC)), we compared the affinities of the Gal4-DNA binding domain (Gal4-(1–94)) for cores and dimers formed from templates containing Gal4 sites at 18, 45, or 72 bp from the DNA edge. In Fig. 1E, the Kd measurements for Gal4-(1–94) binding were plotted against the distance from the center of the Gal4 site to the end of the template (also see Table 1). Prior studies have shown that transcription factors have the highest affinity if their sites are located near the edge of a nucleosome core, but have greatly lowered affinity for sites near the nucleosomal center/pseudodyad (e.g. Refs. 24Adams C.C. Workman J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1405-1421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Polach K.J. Widom J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 800-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 26Vettese-Dadey M. Walter P. Chen H. Juan L.-J. Workman J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 970-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the Kd values for Gal4-(1–94) binding to nucleosome cores got progressively higher as the center of the Gal4 site was moved from 18 bp away from the DNA edge (TPGal41-XX) to 45 bp (TPGal41-HXh) to 72 bp (TPGal41-AH, Fig. 1E, squares). Strikingly, the exact opposite trend was observed for binding to dimers, with Kd values progressively decreasing as the Gal4 site was moved from 18 to 45 to 72 bp (Fig. 1E, diamonds). This inverted accessibility profile shows that altered dimers are not generally more accessible to transcription factors than cores. Instead, altered dimers appear to hold more strongly onto the ends of the nucleosomal DNA templates, while providing greater accessibility to the middle of these templates. This inverse accessibility profile is consistent with, and helps to explain, several previous observations, including the relative protection of DNA ends in dimers from either Exonuclease III or MNase digestion, and the subnucleosomal DNA fragments released from MNase digestion of dimers (13Schnitzler G.R.

Using a microarray-based approach in soluble guanylate cyclase-deficient cells, we recently demonstrated that NO· predominately regulated a large set of cell cycle genes independent cGMP (15Cui X.

NO· induced both E2F1 and p21/Waf1, master regulatory genes in the cell cycle, triggering a highly coordinated genetic program that altered the G1/S transition and led to cellular arrest in G2/M. NO· activation of p38 MAPK was found to up-regulate p21/Waf1 by stabilizing its mRNA (15Cui X. Zhang J. Ma P. Myers D.E. Goldberg I.G. Sittler K.J. Barb J.J. Munson P.J. Cintron Adel P. McCoy J.P. Wang S. Danner R.L. BMC Genomics. 2005; 6: 151Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Downstream of these events, p21/Waf1 is known to exert broad effects on the cell cycle by inhibiting cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) complexes and altering the activity of a number of transcription factors and cofactors, such as E2F, c-Myc, STAT3, and C/EBP-α (15Cui X.

In contrast to E2F1 and p21/Waf1 induction, NO· down-regulated a large group of G2/M phase cell cycle genes (15Cui X. Zhang J. Ma P. Myers D.E. Goldberg I.G. Sittler K.J. Barb J.J. Munson P.J. Cintron Adel P. McCoy J.P. Wang S. Danner R.L. BMC Genomics. 2005; 6: 151Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). A high proportion of these later genes including PLK1 have CDE/CHR (cell cycle-dependent element/cell cycle gene homology region) sites in their proximal promoters (9Zhu H. Chang B.D. Uchiumi T.

Whether or not NO· activation of p38 MAPK with subsequent stabilization of p21/Waf1 mRNA fully explains NO· repression of CDE/CHR-regulated genes is not known. Cell cycle arrest at the G2 checkpoint caused by p38 MAPK has been attributed to a mechanism that is only partially p21/Waf1 dependent (28Garner A.P. Weston C.R. Todd D.E. Balmanno K. Cook S.J.

Furthermore, a number of cell cycle genes with CDE/CHR promoter sites, such as c-Myb, cyclin A1, cyclin B1, and CENP-A (centromere protein A) (9Zhu H. Chang B.D. Uchiumi T. Roninson I.B.

Zhang J. Ma P. Myers D.E. Goldberg I.G. Sittler K.J. Barb J.J. Munson P.J. Cintron Adel P. McCoy J.P. Wang S. Danner R.L. BMC Genomics. 2005; 6: 151Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In the present study, we investigate the roles of p38 MAPK and p21/Waf1 in the regulation of PLK1 by NO·. Using phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-differentiated U937 cells, we first determined the effects of NO· on the expression of PLK1 and p21/Waf1 at both the mRNA and protein levels. Nuclear run-on and mRNA stability studies were then employed to demonstrate the effects of NO· on PLK1 gene transcription and mRNA stabilization. Promoter analysis and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) were further used to identify NO·-responsive elements in the proximal PLK1 promoter. Finally, p38 MAPK blockade using a dominant-negative mutant of p38 MAPK and p21/Waf1 knockdown with siRNA were applied to determine whether NO· effects on PLK1 required either p38 MAPK or p21/Waf1 for functional signal transduction. Reagents and Cell Culture—PMA and S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) were purchased from Calbiochem; actinomycin D and GSH were from Sigma. Antibodies against p21/Waf1 and PLK1 were purchased from R&D Systems, Inc. (Minneapolis MN) and BD Transduction Laboratories (San Diego, CA), respectively. Secondary antibodies, anti-goat and anti-mouse IgG, were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). U937 cells (ATCC, Rockville, MD), a human monoblastoid line, were cultivated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere using RPMI 1640 (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (BioSource International, Rockville, MD), and 1% antimicrobial solution (Cellgro, Herndon, VA). Cells were differentiated with PMA (100 nm) for 16 h, washed twice, and resuspended in fresh media for experiments. Quantitative Real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western Blotting—Total RNA was isolated from PMA-differentiated U937 cells using RNeasy mini kits (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). Transcript levels were measured using TaqMan® (Applied Biosystems, Rockville, MD), as described previously (15Cui X. Zhang J. Ma P. Myers D.E. Goldberg I.G. Sittler K.J. Barb J.J. Munson P.J. Cintron Adel P. McCoy J.P. Wang S. Danner R.L. BMC Genomics. 2005; 6: 151Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Primers and probes for qRT-PCR were purchased from Applied Biosystems. Target gene mRNA levels were normalized to the housekeeping gene GAPDH. To measure protein expression levels for p21/Waf1 and PLK1, 30 μg of whole cell lysate was extracted from cells under various conditions as indicated and used for Western blotting following procedures described previously (14Ma P. Cui X. Wang S. Zhang J. Nishanian E.V. Wang W. Wesley R.A. Danner R.L. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2004; 76: 278-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The housekeeping gene α-tubulin was measured at the same time to control for protein loading. Nuclear Run-on Assays—PMA-differentiated U937 cells were incubated with GSH (400 μm; control) or the NO· donor GSNO (400 μm) for 6 h in the absence or presence of 0.1 μm SB202190, a specific p38 MAPK inhibitor. Nuclei were then isolated with nuclei isolation kit (Sigma) according to the manufacture's protocol. In vitro reverse transcriptase reactions were carried out at room temperature for 40 min in a volume of 250 μl of transcription buffer containing nuclei, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 3 mm MgCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 400 units of rRNasin (Promega), 10% glycerol, 2 mm ATP, 2 mm CTP, 2 mm GTP, 1 mm UTP, and 0.8 mm Biotin-16-UTP. Reactions were stopped by adding 500 μl of RNeasy lysis buffer followed by total RNA extraction using RNeasy mini kits (Qiagen). Newly synthesized RNA transcripts were isolated using a μMACS Streptavidin kit (Miltenyi Biotech, Aubum, CA) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Nascent PLK1 transcripts were quantified by qRT-PCR and normalized to the housekeeping gene GAPDH. Reporter Gene Assays—The two-plasmid reporter gene system used in this investigation has been described previously (12Wang S. Wang W. Wesley R.A. Danner R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33190-33193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 13Zhang J. Wang S. Wesley R.A. Danner R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29192-29200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Briefly, promoters of interest were inserted into the first plasmid, promoterless ptTA, to induce production of a trans-activator (tTA) containing a tetracycline response element binding domain. This fusion protein binds to the second plasmid, pUHG10.3CAT, thereby trans-activating expression of a reporter gene, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT). The following promoter constructs were studied: human PLK1 promoter wild type pPLK1–1k (nt –1000 to +64), the mutant pPLK1-d(–225/+9) with nt –225 to +9 deleted, the mutant pPLK1-(CDE/CHR) with nt –232 to +64 truncated, and the mutant pPLK1-(mCDE/mCHR) with a mutated CDE/CHR site. These promoter constructs were generated using PCR and the site-directed mutagenesis kit (Clontech), and their sequences were partly confirmed by DNA sequencing through Genosys Biotechnologies (Woodlands, TX). PMA-differentiated U937 cells were transfected with the above PLK1 promoter constructs using a previously described method (13Zhang J. Wang S. Wesley R.A. Danner R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29192-29200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). After transfection, the cells were treated with GSNO (400 μm) or GSH (400 μm) for another 24 h. The reporter gene CAT activity was measured using an ELISA kit (Roche Diagnostics) and normalized to β-galactosidase expressed by a co-transfected internal pSVβ-Gal control (Promega, Madison, WI). EMSA—PMA-differentiated U937 cells were cultured for 3 h with GSH (400 μm, control) or GSNO (400 μm). EMSA were performed with 15 μg of nuclear extract and double-stranded DNA probes labeled with biotin-N4-CTP according to manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). The probes purchased from Sigma were as follows: wild type CDE/CHR probe (5′-TCCCAGCGCCGCGTTTGAATTC-3′) representing the nt –7 to +14 section of the human PLK1 promoter; mCDE/mCHR (5′-TCCCAGCttCGCGTTTcgaaTC-3′) with both CDE and CHR mutated; mCDE/CHR (5′-TCCCAGCttCGCGTTTGAATTC-3′) with only CDE mutated; CDE/mCHR (5′-TCCCAGCGCCGCGTTTcgaaTC-3′) with only CHR mutated. For competition assays, 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled probe was added 10 min prior to the corresponding labeled probe. siRNA Knockdown Experiments—Specific p21/Waf1 siRNA (SMARTpool-siGENOME duplex) and scrambled II siRNA (control) were purchased from Dharmacon, Inc. (Chicago, IL). Cells (1 × 106) were transfected with 1 μg of p21/Waf1 siRNA or the control using Nuceofector™ kit-V (Amaxa, Gaithersburg, MD) following the manufacturer's instruction. After 48 h recovery, the transfected cells were treated with GSH (400 μm) or GSNO (400 μm) for 3 or 16 h for later measurement of mRNA and protein expression, respectively. Statistical Analysis—PLK1 mRNA decay was analyzed using a two-way analysis of variance procedure (the first factor was time, the second factor was treatment), followed by appropriate post hoc tests for the comparisons of interest. Various mRNA levels and PLK1 promoter activity were compared with paired t tests. Data are presented as mean ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments. Differences were considered significant when two-sided p values were equal to or less than 0.05. Effect of NO· on PLK1 Gene Expression—We have previously shown using a microarray-based approach that NO· down-regulates PLK1 in U937 cells, a human monblastoid cell (15Cui X. Zhang J. Ma P. Myers D.E. Goldberg I.G. Sittler K.J. Barb J.J. Munson P.J. Cintron Adel P. McCoy J.P. Wang S. Danner R.L. BMC Genomics. 2005; 6: 151Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Here, we first examined the effects of GSNO, a NO· donor, on PLK1 protein expression. Compared with the GSH control, PLK1 protein was 2-fold decreased by exposure to NO· (Fig. 1A). Similarly, PLK1 mRNA expression measured by qRT-PCR was more than 2-fold down-regulated in the presence of GSNO (Fig. 1B). Changes in mRNA stability or transcription rate or both can alter steady-state mRNA levels. To determine whether NO· transcriptionally and/or post-transcriptionally regulates PLK1, mRNA stability and nuclear run-on assays were performed. As shown in Fig. 1C, NO· did not affect PLK1 mRNA stability; GSNO and GSH control resulted in similar decay curves (p > 0.1). Likewise, the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB202190, which was previously shown to inhibit NO·-induced p21/Waf1 mRNA stabilization, had no effect on PLK1 degradation in the presence of GSNO or GSH (p > 0.7). In contrast to unchanged mRNA stability, the de novo synthesis of PLK1 transcripts was significantly reduced by NO· treatment (p = 0.0005 for GSNO versus GSH; Fig. 1D). Transcriptional repression of PLK1 by NO· was completely eliminated by SB202190, a specific p38 MAPK inhibitor (p = 0.8 for SB/GSNO versus SB/GSH; Fig. 1D). p38 MAPK Dependence of NO· Effects on p21/Waf1 and PLK1 Gene Expression—NO· has been shown to regulate the expression of a number of cell cycle genes including p21/Waf1 in a variety of cell types (15Cui X. Zhang J. Ma P. Myers D.E. Goldberg I.G. Sittler K.J. Barb J.J. Munson P.J. Cintron Adel P. McCoy J.P. Wang S. Danner R.L. BMC Genomics. 2005; 6: 151Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 29Ishida A. Sasaguri T. Miwa Y. Kosaka C. Taba Y. Abumiya T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 938-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, p21/Waf1 mRNA was 2-fold up-regulated by GSNO compared with GSH control (p = 0.0001; Fig. 2A). Changes in mRNA levels corresponded to concomitant changes in protein (Fig. 2B). Previously, the p38 MAPK dependence of the NO· effect on p21/Waf1 expression was suggested by the ability of a p38 MAPK inhibitor to block it (15Cui X. Zhang J. Ma P. Myers D.E. Goldberg I.G. Sittler K.J. Barb J.J. Munson P.J. Cintron Adel P. McCoy J.P. Wang S. Danner R.L. BMC Genomics. 2005; 6: 151Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Here, we transfected a dominant-negative p38 MAPK mutant construct (DN-p38 plasmid) into PMA-differentiated U937 cells to test the involvement of p38 MAPK in p21/Waf1 and PLK1 regulation by NO·. As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, NO· consistently up-regulated p21/Waf1 mRNA but down-regulated PLK1 in empty vector transfected U937 cells (p ≤ 0.007 for both). Transfection of cells with the DN-p38 plasmid eliminated NO· effects on both p21/Waf1 and PLK1 mRNA expression (p > 0.7 for both, comparing GSNO to GSH; Fig. 3, A and B). Effect of p21/Waf1 Knockdown on NO· Regulation of PLK1 Expression—Next, we tested the hypothesis that NO· regulation of PLK1 is mediated through its effects on p21/Waf1 using siRNA knockdown. As seen in Fig. 4A, NO· increased p21/Waf1 protein expression in cells transfected with scrambled siRNA control (p = 0.009; GSNO versus GSH within control). In contrast, transfection of specific p21/Waf1 siRNA not only knocked down p21/Waf1 expression by 70% (p = 0.001 for p21/Waf1 siRNA versus Control within GSH; Fig. 4A) but also substantially reduced the up-regulatory effect of NO· on this protein (Fig. 4A). Associated with this, PLK1 mRNA expression was significantly increased by p21/Waf1 knockdown in both the absence and presence of NO· (p < 0.002 for both, comparing p21/Waf1 siRNA to control siRNA within the GSH and GSNO conditions; Fig. 4B). Moreover, GSNO compared with GSH reduced PLK1 mRNA by 50% in control siRNA transfected cells (p = 0.00008; Fig. 4B); this effect was blunted to only 15% in p21/Waf1 siRNA transfected cells (p < 0.08 for an interaction; post hoc p < 0.05, comparing the effect of NO· in scrambled siRNA transfected cells to p21/Waf1 knockdown; Fig. 4B). Consistent with these changes in mRNA, p21/Waf1 knockdown significantly induced the expression of PLK1 protein (p < 0.02 for p21/Waf1 siRNA versus Control within GSH; Fig. 4C) while also blocking its repression by NO· (p > 0.8 for GSNO versus GSH within p21/Waf1 siRNA; Fig. 4C). These results and our previous findings (15Cui X. Zhang J. Ma P. Myers D.E. Goldberg I.G. Sittler K.J. Barb J.J. Munson P.J. Cintron Adel P. McCoy J.P. Wang S. Danner R.L. BMC Genomics. 2005; 6: 151Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) suggest that NO· down-regulation of PLK1 is mediated through p38 MAPK stabilization of p21/Waf1. NO· Responsiveness of the PLK1 Promoter and the Role of Its Proximal CDE/CHR Site—Previous investigations have demonstrated that CDE/CHR elements function as p21/Waf1-regulated repressors in the promoters of several cell cycle genes including PLK1, CDC25 (cell division cycle 25), CDC2, cyclin A, and cyclin B (9Zhu H. Chang B.D. Uchiumi T. Roninson I.B. Cell Cycle. 2002; 1: 59-66Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Uchiumi T. Longo D.L. Ferris D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9166-9174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In our current study, we found that NO· inhibited PLK1 gene transcription (Fig. 1D) without altering its mRNA stability (Fig. 1C). Therefore, we hypothesized that NO· may inhibit PLK1 promoter activation through its proximal CDE/CHR site. To test this possibility, we generated a proximal PLK1 promoter reporter gene plasmid and various mutants (Fig. 5A). Reporter gene assays showed that NO· inhibited wild type PLK1 promoter (pPLK1–1K) activity by half (p = 0.032, GSNO versus GSH; Fig. 5B) but did not affect the pPLK1-d(–225/+9) deletion mutant that lacks a CDE/CHR site (p = 0.62; Fig. 5B). Interestingly, the nt –225 to +9 deletion also dramatically decreased overall promoter activity (p = 0.0175, pPLK1–1k versus pPLK1-d(–225/+9) for the GSH condition) suggesting that besides the CDE/CHR repressor site, additional promoter elements exist in the nt-225 to +9 region of the PLK1 promoter that are necessary for effective PLK1 transcription. Similar to the wild type promoter pPLK1–1K, truncation at nt –1000 to –232 created a mutant pPLK1-(CDE/CHR) that while much shorter than pPLK1–1K, still had an intact CDE/CHR site. This mutant, like the wild type promoter, was also inhibited by NO· treatment by about one-half (p = 0.004, GSNO versus GSH for pPLK1-(CDE/CHR); Fig. 5B). Comparing pPLK1-(CDE/CHR) with pPLK1-(mCDE/mCHR), mutation of both the CDE and CHR sequences not only increased base-line promoter activity by about 2-fold (p = 0.016, pPLK1-(CDE/CHR) versus pPLK1-(mCDE/mCHR) for GSH; Fig. 5B) but also abolished the NO· effect (p = 0.93, GSNO versus GSH for pPLK1-(mCDE/mCHR); Fig. 5B). In Fig. 5C, NO· repression of PLK1 promoter activity (p = 0.0014; GSNO versus GSH) was prevented by SB202190, a specific p38 MAPK inhibitor (p = 0.2; SB/GSNO versus SB/GSH). Neither NO· nor SB202190 altered the activity of the double mutant promoter pPLK1-(mCDE/mCHR) (p > 0.1 for all; Fig. 5C). These results suggest that NO·-p38 MAPK signaling inhibits PLK1 transcription through CDE/CHR-mediated gene repression. In further support of the above conclusion, EMSAs were performed using a biotin-labeled CDE/CHR probe corresponding to the proximal PLK1 promoter sequence. As shown in Fig. 5D, two major DNA-protein complexes, C1 and C2, were detected. NO· increased C1 but reciprocally decreased C2 (Fig. 5D, lane 1 versus lane 2). Both complexes were competed off with excess unlabeled CDE/CHR (Fig. 5D, lane 3), but not mCDE/mCHR, a modified probe with mutations at CDE and CHR (Fig. 5D, lane 4), thereby confirming the specificity of C1 and C2. Interestingly, unlabeled mCDE/CHR with a mutated CDE, but an intact CHR site, competed with complex C1, while reciprocally increasing C2 (Fig. 5D, lane 5 versus lane 2), a binding interaction opposite from the action of NO·. Different from mCDE/CHR, but like CDE/CHR, unlabeled CDE/mCHR with an intact CDE, but mutated CHR site, prevented formation of both the C1 and C2 complexes (Fig. 5D, lane 6). These results suggest that both the CDE and CHR sequences of CDE/CHR are important for the transduction of NO· effects to the PLK1 promoter. The CDE site appears to bind basic components of a functional repressor complex, while the CHR site interacts with at least one protein that modifies this repression. The transduction of NO·-p38 MAPK-p21/Waf1 signals to the PLK1 promoter is associated with a specific DNA-protein binding event at the CHR site. We demonstrated that NO·-p38 MAPK signaling decreased PLK1 gene expression through p21/Waf1-mediated transcriptional repression targeted at a proximal promoter CDE/CHR site. This conclusion is based on these findings: 1) NO· donor (GSNO) down-regulated PLK1 but up-regulated p21/Waf1 mRNA and protein; 2) NO· did not affect the stability of PLK1 mRNA but rather repressed PLK1 transcription, an effect blocked by p38 MAPK"
https://openalex.org/W2071429564,"We previously identified six single gene disruptions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that allow enhanced immunoreactive insulin secretion primarily because of defective Kex2p-mediated endoproteolytic processing. Five eis mutants disrupted established VPS (vacuolar protein sorting) genes, The sixth, LTE1, is a Low Temperature (<15 °C) Essential gene encoding a large protein with potential guanine nucleotide exchange (GEF) domains. Lte1p functions as a positive regulator of the mitotic GTPase Tem1p, and overexpression of Tem1p suppresses the low temperature mitotic defect of lte1. By sequence analysis, Tem1p has highest similarity to Vps21p (yeast homolog of mammalian Rab5). Unlike TEM1, LTE1 is not restricted to mitosis but is expressed throughout the cell cycle. Lte1p function in interphase cells is largely unknown. Here we confirm the eis phenotype of lte1 mutant cells and demonstrate a defect in proalpha factor processing that is rescued by expression of full-length Lte1p but not a C-terminally truncated Lte1p lacking its GEF homology domain. Neither overexpression of Tem1p nor 13 other structurally related GTPases can suppress the secretory proprotein processing defect. However, overexpression of Vps21p selectively restores proprotein processing in a manner dependent upon the active GTP-bound form of the GTPase. By contrast, a vps21 mutant produces a synthetic defect with lte1 in proprotein processing, as well as a synthetic growth defect. Together, the data underscore a link between the mitotic regulator, Lte1p, and protein processing and trafficking in the secretory/endosomal system. We previously identified six single gene disruptions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that allow enhanced immunoreactive insulin secretion primarily because of defective Kex2p-mediated endoproteolytic processing. Five eis mutants disrupted established VPS (vacuolar protein sorting) genes, The sixth, LTE1, is a Low Temperature (<15 °C) Essential gene encoding a large protein with potential guanine nucleotide exchange (GEF) domains. Lte1p functions as a positive regulator of the mitotic GTPase Tem1p, and overexpression of Tem1p suppresses the low temperature mitotic defect of lte1. By sequence analysis, Tem1p has highest similarity to Vps21p (yeast homolog of mammalian Rab5). Unlike TEM1, LTE1 is not restricted to mitosis but is expressed throughout the cell cycle. Lte1p function in interphase cells is largely unknown. Here we confirm the eis phenotype of lte1 mutant cells and demonstrate a defect in proalpha factor processing that is rescued by expression of full-length Lte1p but not a C-terminally truncated Lte1p lacking its GEF homology domain. Neither overexpression of Tem1p nor 13 other structurally related GTPases can suppress the secretory proprotein processing defect. However, overexpression of Vps21p selectively restores proprotein processing in a manner dependent upon the active GTP-bound form of the GTPase. By contrast, a vps21 mutant produces a synthetic defect with lte1 in proprotein processing, as well as a synthetic growth defect. Together, the data underscore a link between the mitotic regulator, Lte1p, and protein processing and trafficking in the secretory/endosomal system. A genetic screen has previously been performed with yeast mutagenized by random gene disruptions (by insertion of lacZ/LEU2) to identify genetically engineered cells exhibiting enhanced immunoreactive insulin secretion (eis, 2The abbreviations used are: eis, enhanced immunoreactive insulin secretion gene; GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; vps, vacuolar protein sorting gene; ICFP, insulin-containing fusion protein; lte, low temperature essential gene; mAb, monoclonal antibody; CPY, carboxypeptidase Y. derived from an integrated GAL1 promoter-driven insulin-containing fusion protein called ICFP, Ref. 1Zhang B.-y. Chang A. Kjeldsen T.B. Arvan P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1187-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The ICFP is comprised of the leader and propeptide of the yeast alpha-mating factor contiguous with a single chain insulin, separated by a Kex2p cleavage site. Cleavage at the Kex2p-processing site causes insulin to be delivered ultimately to the vacuole in a manner that requires specific insulin structural features (2Zhang B.-y. Liu M. Arvan P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3687-3693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). From 90,000 transformants that were originally screened, six independent gene disruptions were identified. Each of the six eis mutants were found to secrete slightly to dramatically increased amounts of unprocessed ICFP, and indeed, a kex2Δ mutant exhibited maximal immunoreactive insulin secretion (1Zhang B.-y. Chang A. Kjeldsen T.B. Arvan P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1187-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Upon further analysis, five of the six eis mutants were found to be vacuolar protein sorting mutants vps8, vps35, vps13, vps4, and vps36, which affect protein trafficking and thereby impair protein processing in the Golgi ⇆ endosomal system (e.g. Ref. 3Luo W. Chang A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 731-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Such an outcome can be explained because the ability of Kex2p and other secretory protein processing enzymes (such as Ste13p and Kex1p) to function properly requires their continuous recycling between Golgi and endosomal systems (4Johnston H.D. Foote C. Santeford A. Nothwehr S.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 1456-1468Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this article, we report that eis4 is caused by disruption of the gene known as LTE1 (5Wickner R.B. Koh T.J. Crowley J.C. O'Neil J. Kaback D.B. Yeast. 1987; 3: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). LTE1 is a low temperature essential gene product that is required at <13 °C to allow yeast cells to advance through the spindle pole checkpoint during mitosis, in which the small GTPase Tem1p is essential (6Molk J.N. Schuyler S.C. Liu J.Y. Evans J.G. Salmon E.D. Pellman D. Bloom K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1519-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Lte1p is a positive regulator of Tem1p function (7Jensen S. Johnson A.L. Johnston L.H. Segal M. Cell Cycle. 2004; 3: 817-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and overexpression of TEM1 rescues the cold-sensitive growth arrest of lte1 cells (8Shirayama M. Matsui Y. Toh-e A. Yeast. 1994; 10: 451-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Lte1p has a large, modular-appearing primary structure including small GEF homology domains embedded in the C- and N-terminal regions (9Jensen S. Geymonat M. Johnson A.L. Segal M. Johnston L.H. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4977-4991Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Overexpression of lte1-mini (truncated to lack these domains) can suppress the cold-sensitive growth arrest of lte1D cells, raising the possibility that Lte1p might not be a GEF for Tem1p (10Yoshida S. Ichihashi R. Toh-e A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 889-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar); however, other analysis supports the hypothesis that GEF function of Lte1p activates Tem1p (11Seshan A. Amon A. Cell Cycle. 2005; 4: 940-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Importantly, while Tem1p expression becomes significant only during mitosis (telophase), Lte1p is stably expressed throughout the cell cycle (12Bardin A.J. Visintin R. Amon A. Cell. 2000; 102: 21-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), suggesting other possible roles for Lte1p in interphase cells. Beginning at the G1 → S transition of the cell cycle, the secretory pathway focuses on the bud site and expands the bud that shall become a daughter cell (13Lord M. Yang M.C. Mischke M. Chant J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Lte1p localization (which is regulated via phosphorylation, Ref. 9Jensen S. Geymonat M. Johnson A.L. Segal M. Johnston L.H. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4977-4991Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) is normally confined to buds growing from secretory activity, at least in part by virtue of interactions with plasma membrane-associated Ras2p (10Yoshida S. Ichihashi R. Toh-e A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 889-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and perhaps by being bound to other cell polarity proteins in the bud such as Kel1p and Kel2p (14Hofken T. Schiebel E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4851-4862Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Even so, we found it surprising to discover lte1 in a screen revealing secretory protein processing mutants. In the present study, we have sought to confirm a secretory protein processing defect in lte1 mutant cells. The present work highlights the importance of the Lte1p C-terminal region (that includes a GEF domain) in proprotein processing. We also report genetic interactions of VPS21 (encoding the yeast homolog of mammalian Rab5) with LTE1, suggesting a new role for Lte1p in protein trafficking in secretory/endosomal systems. Strains and Media—Standard yeast media and genetic manipulations were as described (15Sherman F. Hicks J.B. Fink G.R. A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). Strain L5145/MI316 expresses ICFP from a single chromosomal locus driven from the GAL1 promoter (1Zhang B.-y. Chang A. Kjeldsen T.B. Arvan P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1187-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Strain lte1773 is the eis4 mutant of L5145/pMI316 displaying enhanced immunoreactive insulin secretion after random mutagenesis and screening (1Zhang B.-y. Chang A. Kjeldsen T.B. Arvan P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1187-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The other strains employed in this study, unless stated otherwise, are isogenic to either W303 or L3852 (Table 1).TABLE 1Yeast strains used in this studyStrainsGenotypeSourceW303MATα ade2-1 can1-100 his3-11 leu2-3,112 trp1-1 ura3-5230L3852MATα his3-200 lys2-201 leu2-3,112 ura3-52 ade23L5145Mata kss1 ura3-52 leu2-3,112 his3 trp1 ^63 ade2 GAL+3L4MATα ade2-1 can1-100 his3-11 leu2-3,112 trp1-1 ura3-52 lte11012::URA3This studyH4MATα ade2-1 can1-100 his3-11 leu2-3,112 trp1-1 ura3-52 lte11012::HIS3This studylte1ΔMATα ade2-1 can1-100 his3-11 leu2-3,112 trp1-1 ura3-52 lte1Δ::HIS3This studyvps23ΔMATα ade2-1 can1-100 his3-11 leu2-3,112 trp1-1 ura3-52 vps23Δ::TRP1This studyvps8ΔMATα ade2-1 can1-100 his3-11 leu2-3,112 trp1-1 ura3-52 vps8Δ::URA3This studyVPS21 lte11012MATα his3-200 lys2-201 leu2-3,112 ura3-52 ade2 lte11012::URA3This studyaL3852L4, vps21Δ, vps21Δ lte11012 are isogenic to L3852.vps21Δ LTE1MATα his3-200 lys-201 ura3-52 leu2-3,112 ade2 vps21Δ::LYS2This studyaL3852L4, vps21Δ, vps21Δ lte11012 are isogenic to L3852.vps21Δ lte11012MATα his3-200 lys2-201 leu2-3,112 ura3-52 ade2 vps21Δ::LYS2 lte11012::URA3This studyaL3852L4, vps21Δ, vps21Δ lte11012 are isogenic to L3852.vps9ΔMATα ade2-1 can1-100 his3-11 leu2-3,112 trp1-1 ura3-52 vps9Δ::HIS3This studyvps9Δ lte11012MATα ade2-1 can1-100 his3-11 leu2-3,112 trp1-1 ura3-52 lte11012::URA3 vps9Δ::HIS3This studyBFY106-4DMATα ade2-1 can1-100 his3-11,15 leu2-3,112 trp1-1 ura3-1 kex2Δ::HIS3-A3LM23-3azMATa bar1 ura3 leu2 his4 trp1 met1 [FUS1-lacZ::URA3]20a L3852L4, vps21Δ, vps21Δ lte11012 are isogenic to L3852. Open table in a new tab Plasmids and Molecular Biology—pRSGLC is a TRP1-marked centromeric plasmid (pRS314, Ref. 16Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) bearing the TDH3 promoter (17Warner J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 423-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The pPD34 plasmid, as previously described (8Shirayama M. Matsui Y. Toh-e A. Yeast. 1994; 10: 451-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), carries a ∼9-kb yeast genomic DNA fragment that includes the entire LTE1 gene. From pPD34, a ∼6.0 kb NcoI-SphI fragment containing the LTE1 coding and downstream sequences (but lacking the promoter) was excised and subcloned into shuttle vector pSL1180. A cDNA fragment encoding an initiator methionine and triple Myc tag was fused in-frame directly before the start codon of LTE1. A ∼4.5-kb fragment including the coding sequence and terminator was excised with SacI and inserted with appropriate orientation at this site in pYES2 (InVitrogen) to produce pYL9, a 2-μ plasmid marked with URA3, in which the GAL1 promoter controls expression of triple Myc-LTE1. pYL9DEV was created by introducing the TGA stop condon after the EcoRV site in LTE1 to produce the C-terminally truncated lte11012 mutant. The VPS21 coding sequence was amplified from genomic DNA by PCR using the following primers: GGATCCTTATCTAAGC (which introduces a BamHI site, underlined) and GTCGACAGATCTATTTATC (which introduces a SalI site, underlined). The TEM1 coding sequence was amplified from genomic DNA by PCR using the following primers: GGATCCATTAAATTGAGTTAAGC (which introduces a BamHI site, underlined) and GTCGACTCATGTATTAACGCCC (which introduces a SalI site, underlined). Both pTVPS21 and pTTEM1 were constructed by digesting the PCR products with BamH I and SalI followed by subcloning into the respective sites of pRSGLC.

The single point mutant Vps21p-Q66L was made with the same kit employing TGGGACACTGCTGGGCTAGAGAGATTTGCATCTTTAGCA and TGCTAAAGATGCAAATCTCTCTAGCCCAGCAGTGTCCCA as mutagenic primers. Filter Blot Assays—To assay secretion of insulin-containing peptides, cell patches were replica-plated onto nitrocellulose filters placed on top of plates containing 2% galactose as sole carbon source. After 24–40 h, the filter was washed and processed for immunoblotting with guinea pig anti-insulin and a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody as previously described (1Zhang B.-y. Chang A. Kjeldsen T.B. Arvan P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1187-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). CPY secretion from cells was detected by filter overlay and overnight growth of the cells as described (18Roberts C.J. Raymond C.K. Yamashiro C.T. Stevens T.H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 644-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) using mouse mAb anti-CPY (Molecular Probes, 1:4000 dilution) and a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 1:10000 dilution). Bioactive Alpha Factor and Proalpha Factor Secretion—Assay for secretion of bioactive alpha factor was done as described (19Sprague G.F.J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 77-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). MATα cells (0.015 OD600/1.5 μl) were spotted onto a thin lawn of MATa bar1 cells (LM23–3az; Ref. 20Marsh L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3959-3966Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) on synthetic complete medium. After 1–2 days at 30 °C, halos surrounding patches of cells were visualized by placing plates directly on a scanner and converting to digital images. Halo areas were quantified using Image Quant v5.2 (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). To examine secretion of proalpha factor, cells were grown to mid-log phase in synthetic complete medium without methionine and cysteine. Cells were harvested and resuspended at 0.8 OD600/ml in fresh medium with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. 500 μCi of 35S amino acid mixture (Expre35S35S, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added to each sample, and incubation continued for 50 min at room temperature with shaking. Medium was separated from cells by centrifugation at 19,500 × g for 5 min. SDS was added to the medium to a final concentration of 1%, and samples were boiled for 3 min. Secretion of alpha factor-containing peptides was recovered by immunoprecipitation with the RW1 rabbit polyclonal anti-alpha factor antibody (kind gift of Dr. D. Shields, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY) and analyzed by SDS-15%-PAGE and fluorography. Western Blot—Steady-state levels of mycLte1p, Ste3-Myc, and Kex2p were analyzed in cell lysates prepared from mid-log cultures by vortexing with glass beads, as described previously (21Chang A. Slayman C.W. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Sample loading was normalized to lysate protein as measured by BCA protein assay (Pierce). After SDS-PAGE and electrotransfer to nitrocellulose, blots were probed with anti-Myc (rabbit polyclonal A-14; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) or anti-Kex2p (rabbit polyclonal M120D; gift of Dr. R Fuller, University of Michigan) and a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 1:5000 dilution). Bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Metabolic Labeling and Immunoprecipitation of CPY—Metabolic labeling was performed using cultures grown to mid-log phase in synthetic complete medium without methionine and cysteine. Cells were resuspended at 1 OD600/ml, labeled with Expre35S35S at 0.1 mCi per 1 OD600 cells for 5 min at room temperature, and chased in the presence of 10 mm unlabeled methionine and cysteine. At various chase times, aliquots were placed on ice in the presence of 10 mm sodium azide. Lysates were prepared and resuspended in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 nm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) for immunoprecipitation with 1 μl of mouse mAb anti-CPY and protein G-Sepharose beads. Endocytic Degradation of Ste3p—As previously described (22Davis N.D. Horecka J.L. Sprague G.F.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 53-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), strains carrying pSL2015 (GAL-STE3-myc) were grown to mid-log phase in synthetic complete medium containing 2% galactose as the sole carbon source to stimulate the expression of Ste3p-myc. At time 0, glucose (3%) was added to arrest further Ste3-myc synthesis. At the indicated times after glucose addition, cells were harvested, and lysate was prepared for SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with anti-Myc antibody. Identification of eis4 as lte1—The insulin secretory phenotype of the eis4 mutant was not as strong as some of the other eis mutants that proved to be vps mutants (1Zhang B.-y. Chang A. Kjeldsen T.B. Arvan P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1187-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). By sequencing genomic DNA adjacent to the lacZ insertion, the eis4 mutant was found to be caused by disruption of LTE1. Full-length Lte1p is 1435 amino acids, and residues 1292–1315 are critical to the CDC25 homology domain that is thought to have guanine nucleotide exchange activity. We found that the lacZ/LEU2 insertion of eis4 yielded the possibility of expression of an Lte1p gene product C-terminally truncated after residue 783. To test the effect of losing the C-terminal region of Lte1p on protein processing in the secretory pathway, we prepared several plasmid vectors, each bearing an N-terminally Myc-tagged version of Lte1p under control of the GAL1 promoter. We ultimately concentrated on two constructs, one encoding full-length Lte1p and a second encoding an Lte1p1012 that was C-terminally truncated after residue 1012. These forms were expressed in cells as stable proteins detected by Western blotting with anti-Myc antibody (Fig. 1A), and the functionality of these proteins was also tested (Fig. 1B, see below). Haploid yeast on either glucose, galactose, or raffinose plates can grow at 13 °C, whereas either eis4 cells (lte1783, data not shown) or lte11012 cells exhibit a significant low temperature growth phenotype regardless of carbon source (middle sector, Fig. 2A). Full-length mycLte1p could restore low temperature growth to lte11012 cells on galactose or raffinose plates, but not on glucose plates in which mycLte1p expression remains repressed (left sector, Fig. 2A). Using serial dilution, full-length mycLte1p expression restored quantitatively normal growth to lte1Δ cells at 13 °C, whereas mycLte11012 could not complement the growth defect (Fig. 2B). Likewise, enhanced secretion of exogenously expressed immunoreactive insulin in lte1783 cells was complemented by mycLte1p (Fig. 1B). Thus, whereas C-terminal truncation of Lte1p supports neither low temperature growth nor normal handling of the insulin precursor, mycLte1p is fully functional in both capacities (Figs. 1 and 2). Defect in Proalpha Factor Processing in lte1 Mutant Cells—To test whether Lte1p influences processing of an endogenous secretory protein substrate, we checked the ability of lte11012 cells to produce bioactive alpha mating factor, as assessed by the ability to cause growth arrest of cells of the opposite mating type (20Marsh L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3959-3966Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When spotted on a lawn of Mata cells on galactose plates at 30 °C, wild-type α cells were surrounded by a large halo of growth-arrested Mata cells. By contrast, lte1Δ cells always exhibited a decrease in halo area (Fig. 3A) that averaged a 35% reduction over numerous experiments. These data suggest that Lte1p assists in the production of bioactive alpha factor as well as in processing the insulin-containing fusion protein (1Zhang B.-y. Chang A. Kjeldsen T.B. Arvan P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1187-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Notably, both substrates require cleavage by Kex2p during their maturation within the secretory pathway while proalpha factor requires additional processing events to generate bioactive alpha factor. Whereas a number of vps mutants impair Kex2p-mediated secretory proprotein cleavage via accelerated delivery of Kex2p to a degradative compartment resulting in decreased Kex2p levels, other vps mutants can more subtly influence processing enzymes without significant change in Kex2p levels (such as vps8 (3Luo W. Chang A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 731-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) or vps21 (this report)). It is therefore of interest to note that steady state Kex2p levels were not significantly affected by loss of expression of Lte1p (Fig. 3B). There was a small but reproducible increase in the secretion of unprocessed proalpha factor into the medium of lte11012 mutant cells, comparable to that of vps8 cells (Fig. 3C). (For comparison, Fig. 3, B and C also show that vps21 mutant cells exhibit more proalpha factor secretion without a significant decrease in Kex2p level, whereas kex2Δ cells exhibit massive proalpha factor secretion and undetectable Kex2p.) Because Lte1p exhibits positive regulation of Tem1p, a small GTPase essential for mitosis (7Jensen S. Johnson A.L. Johnston L.H. Segal M. Cell Cycle. 2004; 3: 817-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), we wished to determine whether the secretory protein processing defect of lte1 cells might be secondary to an alteration in cell growth. To check this, we examined whether overexpression of Tem1p could suppress the protein processing defect of lte11012 cells. As shown in Fig. 4B, overexpression of Tem1p allowed lte1 cells to grow like wild type at 13 °C, as previously reported (8Shirayama M. Matsui Y. Toh-e A. Yeast. 1994; 10: 451-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Importantly, however, Tem1p overexpression did not suppress the alpha factor secretion defect of lte1 (Fig. 4A, left). These data suggest that impaired secretory protein processing in lte1 cells is not secondary to a defect in cell growth. lte1 Mutant Cells Do Not Exhibit a vps Phenotype—LTE1 is not a known vacuolar protein sorting (VPS) gene (23Bonangelino C.J. Chavez E.M. Bonifacino J.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2486-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), but as all other eis mutants were known vps mutants (1Zhang B.-y. Chang A. Kjeldsen T.B. Arvan P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1187-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), we checked for secretion of CPY in lte1 cells (Fig. 5A). Unlike other established vps mutants (e.g. vps4 or vps23), lte1 mutant cells exhibited no augmented CPY secretion by filter overlay assay (Fig. 5A). A more sensitive immunoprecipitation assay from media bathing lte1 cells also demonstrated inconsequential secretion of newly synthesized CPY (Fig. 5B). We also considered the possibility of delayed delivery of precursor CPY to the endosomal/vacuolar system without frank CPY secretion in lte1 cells. To check for this, cells were pulse-labeled with 35S amino acids for 5 min, washed, and chased for various times at 30 °C (Fig. 5C). At 5 min of chase, the P1 form of CPY (in the endoplasmic reticulum) predominated with the P2 (Golgi) and mature (vacuolar) forms already apparent. By 10 min of chase, the majority of newly synthesized CPY had already been processed to the mature form and by 30 min of chase, processing appeared complete. In lte11012 mutant cells that exhibit a small alpha factor halo, there was no delay in the appearance of mature CPY, indicating that general protein trafficking within the endosomal system is not substantially perturbed (Fig. 5C). Further, we checked the endocytic internalization and degradation of the cell surface a-factor receptor, Ste3p, using a “GAL-shut-off” assay (22Davis N.D. Horecka J.L. Sprague G.F.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 53-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Specifically, expression of Myc-tagged Ste3p under GAL1 control is shut off by addition of glucose, and vacuolar delivery and degradation of pre-existing cell surface receptors can be followed by Western blotting with anti-Myc. As shown in Fig. 6, Ste3p was degraded in lte11053 mutant cells with normal kinetics. Thus, lte1 is not a vps mutant, showing no global defects in endosomal trafficking.FIGURE 6Endocytic degradation of Ste3p. Wildtype (WT) or lte111012 strains was transformed with pSL2015 (GAL1-STE3-myc). Endocytic degradation of Ste3p-Myc was analyzed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” At each of the times indicated, an aliquot of yeast were removed and analyzed by Western blot. Time 0 represents the steady-state level of Ste3 before the addition of glucose to a final concentration of 3%. The blot was probed with anti-Myc; the position of Myc-tagged Ste3p is indicated at the left.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Genetic Interactions between LTE1 and VPS21, the Yeast Homolog of Mammalian Rab 5—While functioning as a positive regulator of Tem1p, Lte1p has also been found to physically associate with Ras2p-GTP in a manner dependent upon the C-terminal GEF-like domain of Lte1p (10Yoshida S. Ichihashi R. Toh-e A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 889-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To consider other related GTPases that might be involved in secretory protein processing, a BLASTp search of yeast proteins was performed using full-length Tem1p as the query sequence, yielding the list of small GTPases shown in Table 3. Overall sequence similarity is highest for Vps21p (the yeast homolog of mammalian Rab5), but because of the conserved GTPase domain itself, there is a high degree of similarity with all the GTPases listed. Plasmid vectors for overexpressing each of the yeast gene products shown in Table 3 were transformed into Matα lte1 mutant cells to test for suppression of the alpha factor halo defect. As noted above, Tem1p overexpression could not restore a normal alpha factor halo to lte1 mutant cells (Fig. 4A), and indeed, neither could overexpression of Ras2p nor any of the dozen other GTPases listed in the lower portion of Table 3 (data not shown). However, VPS21 overexpression, either driven from its own promoter on a high copy plasmid (Fig. 7A) or a strong constitutive (TDH3) promoter on a centromeric plasmid (not shown), could rescue the alpha factor halo defect of lte1 mutant cells. The effect was specific, as overexpression of Vps21p could not increase the halo of wild-type yeast, nor could it restore the halo defect of an unrelated vps23 mutant (Fig. 7A). The abnormally enhanced immunoreactive insulin secretion of lte1 cells was also suppressed by overexpression of Vps21p (Fig. 7B).TABLE 3Small GTPases with similarity to Tem1p tested for suppression of protein processing defect in lte1 mutant cellsGTPase% Overall similarity to Tem1pType of plasmidaPlasmid sources shown in Table 2.Vector used for expressionVps21p58MulticopypSEY8Vps21p58Centromeric (TDH3 promoter)pRS314Ypt52p54MulticopyYEp1313Ras2p52MulticopyYEp13Ypt6p51CentromericYEp13Ypt7p50Multicopy2μ, LEU2Ypt53p50MulticopypSEY8Sec4p50MulticopyYEp24Rho1p48MulticopypYO324Cdc42p47MulticopyYEp351Rho4p46MulticopypYO324Ras1p46MulticopyYEp13Ypt32p46MulticopyYEp352Ypt31p45MulticopyYEp24Rho2p44MulticopypYO324a Plasmid sources shown in Table 2.
