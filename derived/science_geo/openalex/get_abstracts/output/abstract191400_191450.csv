https://openalex.org/W2085753777,"IN a recent publication1, we reported that a preparation of the antibiotic nisin could be resolved into at least four active polypeptides, which all yielded on hydrolysis two sulphur-containing amino-acids not normally found in proteins. These amino-acids behaved like lanthionine and cystathionine on two-dimensional paper chromatograms and treatment of a mixture of them with Kaney nickel yielded two substances which behaved like alanine and α-amino-n-butyric acid."

https://openalex.org/W2068322917,"SEVERAL workers have suggested that the percentage of binucleate cells seen in histological sections is not a true measure of the percentage of such cells in the liver. The cells of the liver are so large, varying between 12 and 25 µ in diameter, that a considerable number of the cells in a section 6–8 µ thick must have been cut through, and in some cases two nuclei may have been separated. Pfuhl1 corrected for this error in counts made on the livers of rabbits by assuming that the percentages of binucleate cells in sections 5 and 7.5 µ thick were one-third and one-half the absolute value, respectively. Later, Müller2 elaborated a formula for converting the observed counts to the real percentages. It would be preferable to count the binucleate cells in a suspension of liver cells; but the difficulty has been to prepare a suitable suspension. Recently, Bucher and Glinos3 reported finding three times as many binucleate cells in a cell suspension as in a section 6–8 µ thick. This suspension had been prepared by agitation of tissue slices in saline (private communication by Dr. N. Bucher)."

https://openalex.org/W2091767466,"THE increasing complexity of bacterial genetics is illustrated by several recent letters in Nature1. What seems to us a rather chaotic growth in technical vocabulary has followed these experimental developments. This may result not infrequently in prolix and cavil publications, and important investigations may thus become unintelligible to the non-specialist. For example, the terms bacterial ‘transformation’, ‘induction’ and ‘transduction’ have all been used for describing aspects of a single phenomenon, namely, ‘sexual recombination’ in bacteria2. (Even the word ‘infection’ has found its way into reviews on this subject.) As a solution to this confusing situation, we would like to suggest the use of the term ‘inter-bacterial information’ to replace those above. It does not imply necessarily the transfer of material substances, and recognizes the possible future importance of cybernetics at the bacterial level."

Athey, of Chr. Salvesen and Co., Leith, and Dr. J. G. Sharp, of the Low Temperature Research Station, Cambridge. Two of the samples were from blue whales (Balœnoptera musculus) and the remainder from fin whales (Balœnoptera physalus). The milks were collected after dissection of the mammary glands during the flensing operation on board Salvesen and Co.'s factory ships Southern Venturer and Southern Harvester engaged in pelagic whaling in the Antarctic. The period between the death of the whales and the collection of the milk varied from 6 hr. for sample 7 to 19 hr. for sample 4. The samples were stored in glass bottles at a temperature of - 20° C. while on board ship and ashore, before being conveyed to the Hannah Institute with as little rise in temperature as possible. At the Hannah Institute the samples were kept at 4° C. and analysed without delay. Samples 1–3 were at a temperature of - 20° C. for six to seven months and samples 4–8 for two to three months."

https://openalex.org/W2027770372,"THEORIES of the mechanism of staining of rerve fibres by impregnation with silver solutions have at various times been based on adsorption, and on the stoichiometric combination of the silver and the protein. It seems most probable in the light of recent work on protein - metal complexes1 that the combination is stoichiometric, and the following investigation appears to support this view."
https://openalex.org/W2055671754,"LEVINE1, in a review of the newer blood factors, classed several of them as ‘private’. These, he said, “are characterized by the positive or negative reactions being limited to members of a particular family”. He cited as ‘private’ five antibodies reported by various investigators. J. J. van Loghem and van der Hart2 have since reported a sixth."

https://openalex.org/W2082972049,"A DIFFICULTY frequently met in insecticide field trials is that although the insecticide application may kill the insects on the treated plots at the time, these plots may be re-invaded very quickly by insects from the control plots and surrounding untreated areas. This is particularly marked in the case of trials on the control of cotton Lygus (Lygus vosseleri, Popp.), where the greater part of the damage is done by an immigration of highly mobile adults into the crop. One method of avoiding this difficulty is to use large plots of several acres in extent; but the very size of the plots seriously reduces the precision of an experimental comparison, besides being very expensive in time, materials and labour. Recent work has shown that where the principal purpose of the experiments is to study the effect of Lygus upon the yield of cotton, the result may be obtained very much more simply by using the repellent effect of certain insecticides."

They concluded that only the commonest form, and the one without a known causative agent, should be so named, and they suggested that critical indoor rather than field experiments would be needed to reveal the agent. We have found from such experiments carried out over several seasons that cultures of Streptomyces scabies (Thaxter) Waksman and Henrici cause cankering and other stages of parsnip scabbing."
https://openalex.org/W1976434541,"IN a recent communication, Y. Yamamura, M. Kusunose and E. Kusunose1 described two “lactic oxidases” prepared from Mycobacterium avium. “Lactic oxidase I” is said to be a new type of lactateoxidizing system which catalyses the reaction: The authors are apparently unaware that a soluble aerobic dehydrogenase catalysing the same oxidation of L-lactate was extracted from Mycobacterium phlei several years ago2. Preparations of a similar, if not identical, enzyme have been obtained from Mycobacterium smegmatis and Mycobacterium tuberculosis var. hominis (H37 strain)3. For these and other reasons, it was suggested that L-lactic acid oxidase is an enzyme common to all species of acid-fast bacteria4."

https://openalex.org/W2080642023,"EXCESSIVE amounts of iron are frequently present in various organs and tissues of adult South African Bantu1. Among these people, the iron intake is often high, as much as 200 mgm. per diem2. Further, occasional high values for serum iron have been reported among the Bantu of Bechuanaland3. In view of these facts, serum iron-levels, iron-binding capacity and other data have been determined in groups of adult Bantu from different regions of Southern Africa."

https://openalex.org/W1538229736,"MATING in Tæniorhynchus (Mansonioides) uniformis (Theobald) was observed taking place on the night of December 7, 1951, between 18.30 hr. and 22.30 hr., while all-night trapping of mosquitoes was in progress at a cattle-shed in a village on the outskirts of Colombo. On this night it was quite dark by 18.15 hr., but for the light of the moon which was two days after the first quarter. Mating activity took place in three stages. In the first and third stages, which lasted from 18.30 hr. until 19.30 hr. and during 20.30 hr.–22.30 hr. respectively, mating was in active progress. In between these two periods of considerable activity there occurred a lull from 19.30 hr. until 20.30 hr., during which far fewer pairs of mosquitoes were observed copulating, and relatively few males were found coming into the trap. But at no time during this period of four hours was mating not in progress, and 292 females and 195 males were caught; these numbers represented only a small proportion of T. uniformis in the trap, for owing to great activity among the mosquitoes, catching was seriously interfered with. No mating occurred after 22.30 hr."

So far as we are aware, the alkaloids of D. innoxia have not hitherto been fully characterized2. James and Thewlis state that they found hyoscine and hyoscyamine to be present and, from evidence of the hyoscine : hyoscyamine ratios in the two plants and in their reciprocal grafts, have deduced that alkaloid synthesis occurs mainly in the roots."

https://openalex.org/W2061150834,"SULPHA drugs bring about a marked change in the composition of faecal flora1. A reduction in the number of B. coli, and also in their efficiency for synthesizing thiamine, have been observed by many workers2. We have shown that curd feeding enhanced the coliform organisms in the intestines and also the synthesis of thiamine3. It was therefore of interest to study the effects of sulpha drugs when administered along with curds."

Neish1 has described a chromatographic procedure for the determination of glycerol present in amounts up to about 5 mgm. in small samples of fermentation solutions. The present method is suitable for the determination of glycerol which may be present in amounts of the order of 500 mgm., thus permitting the use of a volumetric procedure for the final determination of glycerol."

The work mentioned was carried out while Dr. Shepherd was employed by the Tobacco Pest Control Research Scheme here and was submitted to the Executive Committee, of which I was chairman. After very full consideration it was decided that the results of this particular investigation should not be published, as it was of a preliminary nature and carried out on a commercial crop on a farm. In other words, no control was possible and it is even conceivable that the tainting resulted from incorrect use of the fumigant. The Tobacco Pest Control Research Scheme has ceased operations and its activities have been handed over to the Tobacco Research Board, which has well-designed experiments in progress to check this using both dichloropropene–dichloropropane and ethylene dibromide."
