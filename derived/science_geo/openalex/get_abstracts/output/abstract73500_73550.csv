https://openalex.org/W1989019324,Basic proteins and polyamino acids are taken up by mammalian cells at rates up to 3000 times greater than serum albumin. When given together with serum albumin they increase the albumin uptake by a factor that correlates with their own rate of uptake and can reach more than 50-fold. The lowest threshold of activity detected (10(-10)M)is comparable to the activities of the most potent membrane-active agents.

Penicillamine also caused a marked increase in the amount of soluble collagen in skin and a sharp drop in insoluble material. These findings, which reflect an abnormal pattern of collagen metdbolism, are accompanied by an inhibition of wound-healing and by skin fragility."

https://openalex.org/W2002095302,"Experiments with an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (""replicase"") purified from Escherichia coli infected with an RNA bacteriophage (Qbeta) demonstrate that the enzyme generates a polynucleotide of the same molecular weight as viral RNA; the ""replicase"" cannot distinguish the polynucleotide from its own RNA genome. By starting reactions at input ratios below the saturation levels of template to enzyme, autocatalytic kinetics of RNA increase are observed. The data are consistent with the conclusion that self-propagation of complete viral genomes is occurring in this simple system."

Changes in body temperature generally did not parallel the alterations in brain temperature. Shifts of direct-current potential in the brain are basically independent of the changes in brain temperature."

https://openalex.org/W2081671888,Changes which enhance adaptedness to the environment occur in experimental populations of Drosophila serrata which are acted upon by strong natural selection. The improvement is greater in hybrid than in single-strain populations because genetic variability is greater in the former.

https://openalex.org/W2092684078,"Concentrations of adrenaline and noradrenaline in the circulating blood were measured in blood samples taken from subjects as they performed a visual vigilance task or viewed movies, both under identical conditions. For those subjects whose vigilance performance deteriorated it was concluded that the concentration of circulating adrenaline decreases as a function of time in a vigilance task but not under ""relaxed"" conditions, such as watching motion pictures."

https://openalex.org/W1996552880,"KWASHIORKOR is a protein malnutrition syndrome frequently found in underdeveloped countries. The level of copper in the serum of people with kwashiorkor has been shown to be greatly reduced1–3; and it has been suggested that changes in the colour and texture of hair, which are characteristic of the disease, might be associated with an altered copper content. Gopalan1 found that the copper content of the hair of Indian children with kwashiorkor was considerably less than that of healthy children. Such a reduction might provide a means of early diagnosis. The work described here was undertaken to see whether the reduction is found in other cases of kwashiorkor. Samples of hair were obtained from 13 East African children, 10 with kwashiorkor diagnosed at the Mulago Hospital, Kampala, Uganda, and three healthy controls. The copper content of the hair was measured and the results compared with normal values1,4."

https://openalex.org/W50150128,"The generally accepted maximal values for P:O ratios of mitochondria oxidizing cu-ketoglutarate, other diphosphopyridine nucleotide-dependent substrates, and succinate are 4, 3, and 2, respectively (1). In addition, the demonstration of three crossover points (2) in the electron transfer sequence has bolstered the concept of three sites of energy conservation in oxidative phosphorylation. Recently, however, Boyer (3) has suggested that P:O ratios greater than 3 are possible both on thermodynamic and on mechanistic grounds if the synthesis of adenosine triphosphate were linked to a 1-elect,ron transfer through each coupling site. Bieber (4, 5) has suggested a mechanism involving such a l-electron transfer, by which P:O ratios of 6 might be attained. Several authors have published P:O ratios exceeding the generally accepted values (6-11) ; recently Smith and Hansen (12) in this laboratory reported P:O ratios approaching 6 for heavy beef heart mitochondria with pyruvate-malate as substrate, and approaching 4 with succinate as substrate. P:O ratios greater than 3 were also reported by Smith and Hansen (12) for phosphorylating submitochondrial particles (13) with DPNH as substrate. Lynn and Brown (14) have observed high P:O ratios with rat liver mitochondria.’ In the manometric assays the experimental conditions used by the various authors were different, and the increased efficiency of phosphorylation was attributed to various factors; significantly, in most cases short incubation times were used and small amounts of oxygen were consumed (7, 8, 12).l An exception to the short assay periods and small amounts of oxygen consumed was the report of Beyer and Kennison (11) that gave P :0 ratios greater than 2 for the oxidation of succinate by liver mitochondria from vitamin K-deficient chicks. These authors suggested that such preparations might oxidize malate formed from the oxidation of succinate, leading to the formation of DPNH, the oxidation of which would result in P:O ratios greater than 2. In another report experimental details were not provided (6). We have undertaken a systematic study to determine which conditions"
https://openalex.org/W1980954680,"The dietary induction of serine dehydrase, produced by the oral intubation of hydrolyzed casein to protein-depleted rats, is markedly inhibited by doses of γ-radiation of 400 roentgens or higher provided the irradiation is given within an hour after the initial dose of casein. If the irradiation is delayed until 7 hours after the initial dose of casein, induction is not inhibited. In contrast, the cortisone induction of tyrosine α-ketoglutarate transaminase is not inhibited by doses of γ-radiation up to 3200 roentgens; in some instances hormonal induction of this enzyme appears to be enhanced by irradiation."

https://openalex.org/W1987739544,"The carbon-bound hydrogen atoms of tyrosine that exchange with solvent protons in strongly acid solutions at about 100 degrees C are not the methylene hydrogen atoms but a pair on the aromatic ring. Of the two pairs of protons on the aromatic ring, observed in the proton magnetic resonance spectra, the pair at higher field undergoes exchange in 2.4N DCI at 100 degrees C. Other hydrogen atoms, attached either to aliphatic or aromatic carbon atoms, exhibit no noticeable exchange under the same conditions. From a chemicalshift analysis the exchanging protons are assigned as those ortho to the hydroxyl group on the aromatic ring."

https://openalex.org/W2018556087,"Electrophysiological properties of giant axons of Chilean squid were examined by intracellular perfusion combined with various recording techniques. The amplitude of the action potential of the axons perfused with equal sodium concentrations (0.35M) on both sides of the membrane was approximately 75 millivolts (glutamate salts being used internally); the resting potential recorded with a calomel electrode was roughly 45 mv. These observations confirm and extend previous data, obtained from Chilean squid axons, which show that the amplitude of the action-potential overshoot does not agree with the Nernst equation applied to sodium ion. The discrepancy between these results and those obtained by others is attributed to differences in the procedures used to determine the resting potential."

https://openalex.org/W1965349094,"ADRENAL 17-hydroxycorticosteroid (17-OHCS) secretion in response to insulin hypoglycaemia has been evaluated directly in anaesthetized1 and unanaesthetized2 dogs. As to the mechanism of insulin-induced adrenocortical secretion, Dury3 suggested from his experimental results that insulin hypoglycaemia resulted in an increase in adrenal medullary secretion, which induced the release of adrenocortical hormones. On the other hand, it was claimed by some authors that insulin-induced adrenocortical secretion was not dependent on the sympathoadreno-medullary activity4–6. In the experiments of Egdahl7 the adrenal medullary response to E. coli endotoxin was found to be abolished by the transection of the spinal cord at C7 and the adrenal 17-OHCS secretion in response to endotoxin was not affected by the spinal cord transection. He suggested that the adrenal cortical response to endotoxin was not dependent on the activity of the sympatho-adrenomedullary system. Thus it seems of interest to evaluate directly the adrenal 17-OHCS secretion in response to insulin in cord-sectioned dogs."
