https://openalex.org/W3087410177,"The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 led to pandemic spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), manifesting with respiratory symptoms and multi-organ dysfunction. Detailed characterization of virus-neutralizing antibodies and target epitopes is needed to understand COVID-19 pathophysiology and guide immunization strategies. Among 598 human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from 10 COVID-19 patients, we identified 40 strongly neutralizing mAbs. The most potent mAb, CV07-209, neutralized authentic SARS-CoV-2 with an IC50 value of 3.1 ng/mL. Crystal structures of two mAbs in complex with the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain at 2.55 and 2.70 Å revealed a direct block of ACE2 attachment. Interestingly, some of the near-germline SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing mAbs reacted with mammalian self-antigens. Prophylactic and therapeutic application of CV07-209 protected hamsters from SARS-CoV-2 infection, weight loss, and lung pathology. Our results show that non-self-reactive virus-neutralizing mAbs elicited during SARS-CoV-2 infection are a promising therapeutic strategy."

How single cells decode information about their geometrical shape under mechanical stress and physical space constraints within tissues remains largely unknown. Here, using a zebrafish model, we show that the nucleus, the biggest cellular organelle, functions as an elastic deformation gauge that enables cells to measure cell shape deformations. Inner nuclear membrane unfolding upon nucleus stretching provides physical information on cellular shape changes and adaptively activates a calcium-dependent mechanotransduction pathway, controlling actomyosin contractility and migration plasticity. Our data support that the nucleus establishes a functional module for cellular proprioception that enables cells to sense shape variations for adapting cellular behavior to their microenvironment."

These findings elucidate how the brain and artificial systems represent variables in an abstract format while preserving the advantages conferred by high shattering dimensionality. When encountering a new situation, the ability to determine right away what to do is a hallmark example of cognitive flexibility. This ability relies on the fact that the world is structured and new situations often share features with previously experienced ones. These shared features provide a compact representation that uses a small number of variables to describe the environment. This representation can be constructed using a process of dimensionality reduction, which obviates the need to observe all possible combinations of values of all features appearing in the environment, overcoming the “curse of dimensionality.” The variables describing features shared by multiple instances can be represented in an “abstract” format in the brain, a format that can enable generalization in novel situations. An account of how the brain may represent these variables has remained elusive. Motivated by the fact that the process of abstraction enables generalization, we developed analytic methods for determining when the geometry of neural representations encodes variables in an abstract format. We operationally defined a neural representation of a variable as being in an abstract format (an “abstract variable”) when a linear neural decoder trained to report the value of the variable can generalize to situations not experienced by the decoder during training. Previously unseen combinations of the values of other variables describe these situations. In experiments, these situations correspond to task conditions not used for training the linear decoder. We call the performance of this decoder “cross-condition generalization performance” (CCGP), because it reflects the ability of a decoder to generalize to task conditions not used for training. CCGP is distinct from the type of generalization normally referred to when a variable is decoded by training on some samples from all experimental conditions and testing on held-out samples from the same types of conditions. Techniques similar to CCGP have previously been employed to examine the representation of one variable at a time and/or to identify a common neural substrate that might underlie 2 or more cognitive operations (Horikawa et al., 2013Horikawa T.

A fast, invariant representation for human action in the visual system.J. Neurophysiol. 2018; 119: 631-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Representations of variables in an abstract format, as identified by CCGP, are typically low dimensional (their dimensionality equals the number of encoded variables). The machine learning community often refers to them as “disentangled,” or factorized (e.g., Higgins et al., 2017Higgins I. Matthey L. Pal A. Burgess C. Glorot X. Botvinick M. Mohamed S. Lerchner A. β-VAE: Learning basic visual concepts with a constrained variational framework. ICLR, 2017Google Scholar). A disentangled representation can encode multiple variables in an abstract format simultaneously. However, since a perfectly factorized representation is low dimensional, it places severe limits on the number of different potential responses that a simple linear readout can generate (Rigotti et al., 2013Rigotti M. Barak O. Warden M.R. Wang X.-J. Daw N.D. Miller E.K. Fusi S. The importance of mixed selectivity in complex cognitive tasks.Nature. 2013; 497: 585-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar; Fusi et al., 2016Fusi S. Miller E.K. Rigotti M. Why neurons mix: high dimensionality for higher cognition.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2016; 37: 66-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). To quantify this limitation, we used another measure that characterizes the geometry of representations, the shattering dimensionality (SD) (see also Rigotti et al., 2013Rigotti M. Barak O. Warden M.R. Wang X.-J. Daw N.D. Miller E.K. Fusi S. The importance of mixed selectivity in complex cognitive tasks.Nature. 2013; 497: 585-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). The SD is the number of different ways that points corresponding to the firing rates of one or more neurons in different (experimental) conditions can be separated (shattered) by a linear decoder. Typically when SD increases, CCGP decreases. However, this trade-off between CCGP and SD is not necessary, and there are geometries that allow for a surprisingly good compromise in which both SD and CCGP are high. These geometries enable good generalization in novel situations and retain properties that confer the flexibility to respond in many different ways to complex combinations of inputs. We used CCGP and SD to examine the geometry of neural representations recorded from monkeys as they performed a serial reversal-learning task in which they switch back and forth between 2 un-cued contexts. A distinct stimulus-response outcome (SRO) mapping described each trial, and sets of SRO mappings defined contexts (“task sets”). Some variables were observable (related to sensory input or motor output), while context, a hidden variable, was defined by the temporal statistics of events and could not be directly inferred by the value of any observable variable. Therefore, if a neural ensemble represents the variable context in an abstract format, it would reflect a process of dimensionality reduction (i.e., abstraction) that consistently captures the relational properties of the states of the external world across time (Eichenbaum, 2017Eichenbaum H.

Abstract context representations in primate amygdala and prefrontal cortex.Neuron. 2015; 87: 869-881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Our data reveal that neural ensembles in all 3 brain areas, and ensembles of units in simulated multi-layer networks, simultaneously represent hidden and explicit variables in an abstract format, as defined by high CCGP, yet also possess high SD. Our results highlight the importance of characterizing the geometry of a neural representation—not just what information is represented—in order to understand a brain region’s potential contribution to different types of flexible cognitive behavior. We first present behavioral data and the theoretical framework and analytic methodology developed to characterize geometry. Then we characterize the geometry of neural representations in the HPC, DLPFC, and ACC and in simulated neural networks. Monkeys performed a serial-reversal learning task in which each of 2 blocks of trials contained 4 types of trials (conditions). Three variables described each condition: a stimulus and its operant and reinforcement contingencies (SRO mapping). Un-cued switches occurred between the blocks of trials in which SRO mappings changed simultaneously for all 4 conditions. Thus, each block was a context defined by its set of 4 SRO mappings (“task sets”), a hidden variable. Correct performance for 2 stimuli in each context required releasing a button after stimulus disappearance; for the other 2 stimuli, the correct operant response was to continue to hold the button (Figures 1A and 1B ; see STAR Methods). For 2 stimuli, correct performance resulted in reward delivery; for the other 2 stimuli, correct performance did not result in reward, but it avoided a timeout and repetition of the same unrewarded trial (Figure 1B). Without warning, randomly after 50–70 trials, context switched, and many switches happened within an experiment. Not surprisingly since context switches were un-cued, monkeys’ performance dropped to significantly below chance immediately after a context switch (image 1 in Figure 1C). In principle, after this incorrect choice, monkeys could re-learn the correct SR associations for each image independently. Instead, behavioral evidence shows that monkeys perform inference in relation to context switches. After experiencing changed contingencies for one or more stimuli, average performance is significantly above chance for the stimulus conditions not yet experienced (image numbers 2–4, Figure 1C). Once monkeys exhibit evidence of inference, performance remains asymptotic for the remainder of trials in that context (∼90% correct, Figure 1D). Note that the temporal statistics of events (trials) define the variable context. The only feature that trials of context 1 have in common is that they are frequently followed or preceded by other trials of context 1; the same applies to context 2 trials. Monkeys’ behavior suggests that they exploit knowledge of these temporal statistics. A neural ensemble can represent variables in many different ways. We now consider different representations that have distinct generalization properties. We use these properties to define when a variable is represented in an abstract format. Consider the hidden variable context. Some representations encode context but do not reflect a process of abstraction. For example, assume that the average firing rate of each neuron is random for each experimental condition (i.e., for each SRO mapping). Figure 2A depicts in the firing rate space an example of this representation. Each coordinate axis is the firing rate of one neuron. Each point in Figure 2A represents a vector containing the average activity of 3 neurons for each condition within a specific time window. The geometry of the representation is defined by the arrangement of all the points corresponding to the different experimental conditions. In the random case under consideration, if the number of neurons is sufficiently large, the pattern of activity corresponding to each condition will be unique. If trial-by-trial variability in firing rate (i.e., noise) is not too large, even a simple linear classifier can decode context, as the 2 points of one context can be separated from the 2 points of the other context (Figure 2A). Notice that in this geometry any arbitrarily selected 2 points can be separated from the others. Each way of grouping the points (i.e., each dichotomy) corresponds to a different variable, and when 2 groups of points are linearly separable the corresponding variable is decodable. One way to characterize the geometry of representations is to determine how many dichotomies can be decoded by a linear classifier. We call this quantity shattering dimensionality (SD). SD is defined as the performance of a linear decoder averaged over all possible balanced dichotomies. A high SD means that a linear readout can generate a large number of input-output functions. SD is similar to the measure of dimensionality used in Rigotti et al., 2013Rigotti M. Barak O. Warden M.R. Wang X.-J. Daw N.D. Miller E.K. Fusi S. The importance of mixed selectivity in complex cognitive tasks.Nature. 2013; 497: 585-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar. The representation in Figure 2A has maximal SD, as all dichotomies can be decoded. The random representations just described allow for a form of generalization, as a decoder trained on a subset of trials from all conditions can generalize to held-out trials. This form of generalization is clearly insufficient to characterize a representation of a variable that is in an abstract format because the representations are random, and hence they do not reflect the links between the different instances (SRO mappings) of the contexts. Therefore, despite encoding context, this type of representation cannot be considered to represent context in an abstract format. A neural representation of context in an abstract format needs to incorporate into the geometry information about the links between different instances of the same context. One way to accomplish this is to cluster together patterns of activity that correspond to conditions in the same context (see Figure 2B). Clustering is a geometric arrangement that permits an important and distinct form of generalization that we use to define when a neural ensemble represents a variable in an abstract format. We propose that this format can support a fundamental aspect of cognitive flexibility, the ability to generalize to novel situations. To identify in our experiments when a variable is represented in a format that could support this type of generalization, we determined whether one could decode a variable in experimental conditions not used for training the decoder. This type of generalization is illustrated in Figure 2B. A linear decoder is trained to decode context on the rewarded conditions of the 2 contexts. Then the decoder is tested on trials not rewarded. The clustered geometric arrangements of the points ensures that the decoder successfully generalizes to the conditions not used for training. In marked contrast to clustered geometric arrangements, random responses to trial conditions do not allow for this form of generalization. In the case of random responses (e.g., Figure 2A), if only rewarded conditions are used to train the decoder to classify context, then the separating plane will be very different from the one where the decoder is trained on a subset of trials from all conditions. Now the 2 test points corresponding to unrewarded conditions will have the same probability of being on either side of the separating plane derived from the decoder trained on rewarded conditions only. We designate the performance of decoders in classifying variables when testing and training on different types of conditions as CCGP (see also Saez et al., 2015Saez A. Rigotti M. Ostojic S. Fusi S. Salzman C.D. Abstract context representations in primate amygdala and prefrontal cortex.Neuron. 2015; 87: 869-881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). We use the average CCGP across all possible ways of choosing training and testing conditions as a metric of the degree to which a variable is represented in an abstract format (see also Figure S1). A variable is defined as being represented in an abstract format when CCGP is significantly different from one in which the points from the same conditions would be at random locations (see STAR Methods). The clustering geometry allows a single variable to be encoded in an abstract format. In the case in which the differences within each cluster are only due to noise, the single variable encoded in an abstract format is the only decodable variable, and SD would be low. How can neural ensembles represent multiple variables in an abstract format at the same time? One way would be if different neurons exhibit pure selectivity for different variables (e.g., one neuron specialized to encode context, and another specialized to encode value). This factorized or disentangled geometry allows for high CCGP for both context and value. However, in our dataset neurons that respond to a single variable are rarely observed, a finding consistent with many studies showing that neurons more commonly exhibit mixed selectivity for multiple variables (Rigotti et al., 2013Rigotti M. Barak O. Warden M.R. Wang X.-J. Daw N.D. Miller E.K. Fusi S. The importance of mixed selectivity in complex cognitive tasks.Nature. 2013; 497: 585-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar; Fusi et al., 2016Fusi S. Miller E.K. Rigotti M. Why neurons mix: high dimensionality for higher cognition.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2016; 37: 66-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) (see Methods S7). Nonetheless, the generalization properties of factorized representations are preserved when all the points are rotated in the firing rate space, as in Figure 2C. Here, the 4 data points lie on the corners of a square, with neurons exhibiting linear mixed selectivity (Rigotti et al., 2013Rigotti M. Barak O. Warden M.R. Wang X.-J. Daw N.D. Miller E.K. Fusi S. The importance of mixed selectivity in complex cognitive tasks.Nature. 2013; 497: 585-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). Under the assumption that a decoder is linear, CCGP will not change if a linear operation like rotation is performed on the data points. Using a similar construction, it is therefore possible to represent as many variables in an abstract format as the number of neurons. For the representation depicted in Figure 2C, SD is high but not maximal because the combinations of points that correspond to an exclusive OR (XOR) are not separable (i.e., a linear classifier cannot separate the visual stimuli A and C). Although in this simple example SD is still relatively high, it can decrease exponentially with the total number of conditions. However, a sufficiently large distortion of the representation in Figure 2C can lead to a representation that allows for maximal SD and, at the same time, high CCGP for both context and value (Figure 2D). Simulations show that there is a surprisingly wide range of distortions in which the representations can have both high SD and high CCGP for multiple variables (see Figure S2).Figure S2Trade-off between CCGP/PS and Shattering Dimensionality, Related to Figure 2Show full captionAnalysis of an artificial dataset generated by randomly embedding a (three-dimensional) cube in a 100-dimensional space, displacing its corners in independent random directions by a certain distance (displacement magnitude), and then sampling data points corresponding to the eight experimental conditions from isotropic Gaussian distributions around the cluster centers obtained from this distortion procedure.

For low noise, both SD and CCGP can simultaneously be close to one, indicating maximal dimensionality and the presence of three abstract variables for these representations. In the case of high noise, we observe a smooth tradeoff between CCGP (abstraction) and SD (dimensionality).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Analysis of an artificial dataset generated by randomly embedding a (three-dimensional) cube in a 100-dimensional space, displacing its corners in independent random directions by a certain distance (displacement magnitude), and then sampling data points corresponding to the eight experimental conditions from isotropic Gaussian distributions around the cluster centers obtained from this distortion procedure.

In the case of high noise, we observe a smooth tradeoff between CCGP (abstraction) and SD (dimensionality). The serial reversal-learning task contains 8 types of trials (SRO combinations). There exist 35 different ways of dividing the 8 types of trials into 2 groups of 4 conditions (i.e., 35 dichotomies). Each dichotomy corresponds to a variable that could be in an abstract format. Three of these variables describe the context, reward value, and correct action associated with each stimulus in each of the 2 contexts. We took an unbiased approach to determine which dichotomies are decodable and which are in an abstract format. To assess which variables were in an abstract format and to further characterize the geometry of the recorded neural representations, we used two quantitative measures, CCGP and the parallelism score (PS). As described in reference to Figures 2B–2D, CCGP can be computed by training a linear decoder to classify any dichotomy on a subset of conditions, and testing classification performance on conditions not used for training. Since there are multiple ways of choosing the subset of conditions used for training, we report the average CCGP across all possible ways of choosing the training and testing conditions (see STAR Methods and Figure S1A). The PS is related to CCGP, but it focuses on specific aspects of the geometry. In particular, the PS quantifies the degree to which coding directions are parallel when training a decoder to classify a variable for different sets of conditions. Consider the case depicted in Figures S1B and S1C. Two different lines (which would be hyperplanes in a higher dimensional plot) are obtained when a decoder is trained to classify context using the two points on the left (rewarded conditions, magenta) or the two points on the right (unrewarded conditions, dark purple). The two lines representing the hyperplanes are almost parallel, indicating that this geometry will allow for high CCGP. The extent to which these lines (hyperplanes) are aligned can be quantified by calculating the coding directions (arrows in Figures S1B and S1C) that are orthogonal to the lines. The PS is the degree to which these coding vectors are parallel. Analogous to CCGP, there are multiple ways of pairing points that correspond to two different values of a dichotomy. We compute the PS for all ways of pairing and report the maximum observed PS. For"

So far there is no consensus for drug treatment to stop the spread of the virus. Discovery of a drug that would limit the virus expansion is one of the biggest challenges faced by the humanity in the last decades. In this perspective, to test existing drugs as inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 main protease is a good approach. Among natural phenolic compounds found in plants, fruit, and vegetables; flavonoids are the most abundant. Flavonoids, especially in their glycosylated forms, display a number of physiological activities, which makes them interesting to investigate as antiviral molecules. The flavonoids chemical structures were downloaded from PubChem and protease structure 6LU7 was from the Protein Data Bank site. Molecular docking study was performed using AutoDock Vina. Among the tested molecules Quercetin-3-O-rhamnoside showed the highest binding affinity (-9,7 kcal/mol). Docking studies showed that glycosylated flavonoids are good inhibitors for the SARS-CoV-2 protease and could be further investigated by in vitro and in vivo experiments for further validation. MD simulations were further performed to evaluate the dynamic behavior and stability of the protein in complex with the three best hits of docking experiments. Our results indicate that the rutin is a potential drug to inhibit the function of Chymotrypsin-like protease (3CL pro) of Coronavirus."
https://openalex.org/W3093034328,Brains encode behaviors using neurons amenable to systematic classification by gene expression. The contribution of molecular identity to neural coding is not understood because of the challenges involved with measuring neural dynamics and molecular information from the same cells. We developed CaRMA (calcium and RNA multiplexed activity) imaging based on recording in vivo single-neuron calcium dynamics followed by gene expression analysis. We simultaneously monitored activity in hundreds of neurons in mouse paraventricular hypothalamus (PVH). Combinations of cell-type marker genes had predictive power for neuronal responses across 11 behavioral states. The PVH uses combinatorial assemblies of molecularly defined neuron populations for grouped-ensemble coding of survival behaviors. The neuropeptide receptor neuropeptide Y receptor type 1 (Npy1r) amalgamated multiple cell types with similar responses. Our results show that molecularly defined neurons are important processing units for brain function.

We track the dynamic responses to the COVID-19 pandemic across 38 European countries and 621 regions by employing a large dataset on human mobility generated between February 15 and June 5, 2020 and a broad range of contextual factors (e.g., deaths or policy implementations). Using a time-dynamic framework we find that societies with low levels of health care confidence initially exhibit a faster response with respect to staying home. However, this reaction plateaus sooner, and after the plateau it declines with greater magnitude than does the response from societies with high health care confidence. On the other hand, regions with higher confidence in the health care system are more likely to reduce mobility once the government mandates that its citizens are not to leave home except for essential trips, compared to those with lower health care system confidence. Regions with high trust in the government but low confidence in the health care system dramatically reduce their mobility, suggesting a correlation for trust in the state with respect to behavioral responses during a crisis."

The extremely long (∼1 Mb) haplotype on human chromosome 2 (2q21.3) represents a classic example of positive selection, where a large chromosome segment containing genetic variants has risen to high frequency among European populations over the last several thousand years, presumably due to selection for traits associated with a survival advantage (Bersaglieri et al., 2004Bersaglieri T.

The 2q21.3 locus harbors the lactase gene (LCT), encoding the enzyme lactase-phlorizin hydrolase, which hydrolyzes lactose and is expressed in the small intestine of infants allowing digestion of breast milk (Swallow, 2003Swallow D.M. Genetics of lactase persistence and lactose intolerance.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2003; 37: 197-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Intestinal expression of lactase is typically shut off after weaning in mammals. However, the long 2q21.3 haplotype in Europeans is strongly linked to expression of intestinal lactase into adulthood (termed lactase persistence [LP]), allowing adult milk consumption (Gerbault et al., 2011Gerbault P. Liebert A. Itan Y. Powell A. Currat M. Burger J. Swallow D.M. Thomas M.G. Evolution of lactase persistence: an example of human niche construction.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol.

The signature European LP single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs4988235, is present in an intronic enhancer in the MCM6 gene, which is located just upstream of the LCT gene. LP has been postulated to have provided a selective advantage in nutrient-deprived populations and at higher latitudes with decreased sunlight due to supplementation of calcium and vitamin D3 to support proper bone formation and calcification (Flatz and Rotthauwe, 1973Flatz G. Rotthauwe H.W. Lactose nutrition and natural selection.Lancet. 1973; 2: 76-77Abstract PubMed Google Scholar). However, other dietary sources might have provided sufficient sources of such nutrients (Itan et al., 2009Itan Y. Powell A. Beaumont M.A. Burger J. Thomas M.G. The origins of lactase persistence in Europe.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2009; 5: e1000491Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The current prevailing theory has posited that adult consumption of fresh milk among herding populations would have allowed additional calorie intake to produce a survival advantage during famines (Sverrisdóttir et al., 2014Sverrisdóttir O.O. Timpson A. Toombs J. Lecoeur C. Froguel P. Carretero J.M. Arsuaga Ferreras J.L. Götherström A. Thomas M.G. Direct estimates of natural selection in Iberia indicate calcium absorption was not the only driver of lactase persistence in Europe.Mol. Biol. Evol. 2014; 31: 975-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, fresh milk is highly susceptible to microbial degradation, and from archeological records it is clear that farmers and herders in ancient times knew well how to preserve milk products through the generation of butter, yogurt, and cheese products, where much of the lactose is removed or consumed (Curry, 2013Curry A. Archaeology: The milk revolution.Nature. 2013; 500: 20-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar; Salque et al., 2013Salque M. Bogucki P.I. Pyzel J. Sobkowiak-Tabaka I. Grygiel R. Szmyt M.

Bon C. On the Evolution of Lactase Persistence in Humans.Annu. Rev. Genomics Hum. Genet. 2017; 18: 297-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Studies of ancient DNA have also shown that steppe populations lacked the rs4988235 LP SNP for thousands of years yet were known to be herders and exhibited evidence of consumption of milk products (Jeong et al., 2018Jeong C. Wilkin S. Amgalantugs T. Bouwman A.S. Taylor W.T.T. Hagan R.W. Bromage S. Tsolmon S. Trachsel C. Grossmann J. et al.Bronze Age population dynamics and the rise of dairy pastoralism on the eastern Eurasian steppe.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2018; 115: E11248-E11255Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar; Mathieson et al., 2015Mathieson I. Lazaridis I. Rohland N. Mallick S. Patterson N. Roodenberg S.A. Harney E. Stewardson K. Fernandes D. Novak M. et al.Genome-wide patterns of selection in 230 ancient Eurasians.Nature. 2015; 528: 499-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Hence, individuals among herding populations, even those with moderate lactose intolerance, should have been able to consume stored milk products during most famines. Challenged by severe and prolonged famines that would generate strong selective pressure, increased energy efficiency and fat storage among human populations might also have provided a selective advantage for survival and propagation, perhaps in cooperation with the ability of adults to consume milk. While potentially beneficial in times of famine frequent after the transition from hunting and gathering to agriculture, this “thrifty gene” trait may now represent a metabolic maladaptation predisposing to obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes (T2D) (Neel, 1962Neel J.V. Diabetes mellitus: a “thrifty” genotype rendered detrimental by “progress”?.Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1962; 14: 353-362PubMed Google Scholar). Support for the possibility of a “thrifty” genotype-phenotype link comes from the fact that several genetic variants across the locus have also been linked to metabolic abnormalities and diseases associated with decreased energy expenditure, such as obesity and T2D, as well as abnormal blood metabolites and lipids (Albuquerque et al., 2013Albuquerque D.

For example, a meta-analysis of 31,720 individuals from diverse European populations showed a statistically significant (p = 7.9 × 10−5) elevation of body mass index (BMI, kg/m2) associated with the positively selected allele of the rs4988235 SNP (Kettunen et al., 2010Kettunen J. Silander K. Saarela O. Amin N. Müller M. Timpson N. Surakka I. Ripatti S. Laitinen J. Hartikainen A.L. et al.European lactase persistence genotype shows evidence of association with increase in body mass index.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2010; 19: 1129-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Increased ectopic fat storage in liver and skeletal muscle represent strong risk factors for the development of insulin resistance and T2D (Shulman, 2014Shulman G.I. Ectopic fat in insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and cardiometabolic disease.N. Engl. J. Med. 2014; 371: 1131-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). In support of a link of the 2q21.3 locus to T2D, two genome-wide association studies (GWASs) coupled to metabolomics also reported an association of SNPs across this locus with altered levels of 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG), a metabolite linked to abnormal glucose homeostasis and T2D (Kim and Park, 2013Kim W.J. Park C.Y. 1,5-Anhydroglucitol in diabetes mellitus.Endocrine. 2013; 43: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar; Shin et al., 2014Shin S.Y. Fauman E.B. Petersen A.K. Krumsiek J. Santos R.

Hence, the long haplotype at 2q21.3 is linked to both LP and metabolic aberrations, which may reflect positive selection for multiple cooperative traits (ability to consume milk in adulthood and increased fat storage) that together could have conferred a strong survival advantage during severe famines. The genetic and molecular underpinnings for the association of the locus with obesity and T2D have remained obscure. It is possible that these additional associations with metabolic aberrations could be explained by one or multiple genetic elements present in the locus. While obesity has a clear genetic component in humans (Allison et al., 1996Allison D.B. Kaprio J. Korkeila M. Koskenvuo M. Neale M.C. Hayakawa K.

To date, the majority of genotype-phenotype studies in humans have focused on protein coding genes; however, microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as crucial regulators of the expression of hundreds of genes, often controlling the output of entire biological pathways (Ambros, 2004Ambros V. The functions of animal microRNAs.Nature. 2004; 431: 350-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (8088) Google Scholar; Bartel, 2009Bartel D.P.

Metazoan MicroRNAs.Cell. 2018; 173: 20-51Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar). We and others have uncovered several miRNAs as crucial metabolic regulators (Goedeke et al., 2016Goedeke L. Wagschal A. Fernández-Hernando C.

Näär A.M. MicroRNAs in metabolism and metabolic disorders.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2012; 13: 239-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). We previously employed an unbiased analysis of GWAS data from >188,000 individuals to identify miRNAs associated with abnormal blood lipids (Wagschal et al., 2015Wagschal A. Najafi-Shoushtari S.H. Wang L. Goedeke L. Sinha S. deLemos A.S. Black J.C. Ramírez C.M. Li Y. Tewhey R. et al.Genome-wide identification of microRNAs regulating cholesterol and triglyceride homeostasis.Nat. Med. 2015; 21: 1290-1297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These studies uncovered miR-128-1 as a critical regulator of circulating total cholesterol in vivo in mice (Wagschal et al., 2015Wagschal A. Najafi-Shoushtari S.H. Wang L. Goedeke L. Sinha S. deLemos A.S. Black J.C. Ramírez C.M. Li Y. Tewhey R. et al.Genome-wide identification of microRNAs regulating cholesterol and triglyceride homeostasis.Nat. Med. 2015; 21: 1290-1297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, miR-128-1 is an intronic miRNA present in the R3HDM1 gene, which is located at the center of the positively selected locus on human chromosome 2, approximately 200 kb from the LCT gene. Given the strong link of miR-128-1 to the GWAS association with cholesterol/lipid abnormalities (Wagschal et al., 2015Wagschal A. Najafi-Shoushtari S.H. Wang L. Goedeke L. Sinha S. deLemos A.S. Black J.C. Ramírez C.M. Li Y. Tewhey R. et al.Genome-wide identification of microRNAs regulating cholesterol and triglyceride homeostasis.Nat. Med. 2015; 21: 1290-1297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the prediction that it might regulate expression of genes involved in metabolic control (www.targetscan.org), we sought to further evaluate whether miR-128-1 represents a metabolic miRNA that could have contributed to the association of the long haplotype on human chromosome 2 with metabolic diseases and positive selection. We began by examining the haplotype structure of 2q21.3 in Europeans, where we observed that there is a well-studied, strong selection signal across a long haplotype centered on the R3HDM1 gene (Figure 1A; Figure S1A). This selection signal is directly attributed to the LP phenotype associated with the previously reported tag SNP rs4988235. We note a strong metabolic association at the locus from our previous work detailing a lipid association with expression of miR-128-1 (Wagschal et al., 2015Wagschal A. Najafi-Shoushtari S.H. Wang L. Goedeke L. Sinha S. deLemos A.S. Black J.C. Ramírez C.M. Li Y. Tewhey R. et al.Genome-wide identification of microRNAs regulating cholesterol and triglyceride homeostasis.Nat. Med. 2015; 21: 1290-1297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) present in the R3HDM1 gene. In light of this, along with the apparent selection signal associated with SNPs in R3HDM1 near miR-128-1 (e.g., rs1446585, Figure 1A), we examined the selection signal across species in more detail by performing a literature search to identify species exhibiting selection at the 2q21.3 syntenic locus and, if so, whether there is evidence for a metabolic association.Figure S1Selection Signals at the 2q21.3 Locus, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Composite of multiple signals (CMS) un-normalized selection signal.

In each case, the axes show the 2 Mb section of chromosome 2 surrounding the positively selected region and the associations of all SNPs in the region.

https://openalex.org/W3093026727,"Biological systems tailor their properties and behavior to their size throughout development and in numerous aspects of physiology. However, such size scaling remains poorly understood as it applies to cell mechanics and mechanosensing. By examining how the Drosophila pupal dorsal thorax epithelium responds to morphogenetic forces, we found that the number of apical stress fibers (aSFs) anchored to adherens junctions scales with cell apical area to limit larger cell elongation under mechanical stress. aSFs cluster Hippo pathway components, thereby scaling Hippo signaling and proliferation with area. This scaling is promoted by tricellular junctions mediating an increase in aSF nucleation rate and lifetime in larger cells. Development, homeostasis, and repair entail epithelial cell size changes driven by mechanical forces; our work highlights how, in turn, mechanosensitivity scales with cell size."
https://openalex.org/W3092848599,"The long-term impact of human exploitation and environmental changes has led to a decline in grassland productivity and soil fertility, which eventually results in grassland degradation. The application of organic fertilizer is an effective improvement measure; however, it is still not fully understood how the addition of organic fertilizer influences grassland soil fertility and plant composition. A set of experiments were conducted in Inner Mongolia in China to reveal the tradeoff between steppe plants and soil microorganisms and the eco-physiological mechanisms involved, and how the addition of vermicompost and mushroom residues affect microbial diversity, enzyme activities, and the chemical properties of soil in degraded Leymus chinensis grassland. Organic fertilizer improved the soil nutrient status and shaped distinct bacterial communities. Compared with the control the available phosphorus (AP) and available potassium (AK) contents were highest under treatments a3 and b3, and the aboveground biomass was highest under the b3 treatment. Soil sucrase activities increased by 7.88% under the b3 treatment. Moreover, the richness index significantly increased by 7.07% and 7.23% under the a1 and b2 treatments, respectively. The most abundant Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria were detected in the organic fertilizer treatment. A linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) indicated that the bacterial community was significantly increased under the b3 treatment. A canonical correspondence analysis (RDA) and spearman correlation heatmap confirmed that total P (TP) and urease were the key driving factors for shaping bacterial communities in the soil. Our results indicated that the application of large amounts of vermicompost and mushroom residues increased the availability of nutrients and also enhanced the biodiversity of soil bacterial communities in L. chinensis grasslands, which will contribute to the sustainable development of agro-ecosystems."

A growing number of studies point to increases in suicide, depression, anxiety, mood disorders, and burnout related to physician lifestyles. Mental health issues commencing in medical school have been suggested to have a significant impact on future physician lifestyle and burnout. Tracking the mental health of medical students at the University of Toledo College of Medicine and Life Sciences (UTCOMLS) with standardized indices will help elucidate triggers of poor mental health. Anonymous surveys were developed and distributed to preclinical medical students at five strategic time points throughout the 2018 2019 academic year. Surveys collected basic demographic information as well as inventories measuring perceived stress, burnout, resilience, and mindfulness. 172 M1s (83 males and 89 females) were included in the study and average response rate for the first 4 (out of 5) surveys averaged 74.8%. M1 males and females had on average increased personal burnout over time with females consistently scoring higher. Both males and females had an increase in stress from August to each subsequent month (p<0.05). Females reported a higher level of perceived stress than males in the beginning and middle of the academic year (p<0.05). Both males and females report a gradual decrease in resiliency throughout the academic year. These surveys demonstrated over half of males and females in medical school reported higher perceived stress scores than their gender-matched peers in the general United States population. Our study strengthens documented trends in resiliency, perceived stress, and burnout amongst medical students. More study in designing targeted approaches to ameliorate these findings in the medical student population is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W3093051733,"5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) is an intermediate stage of DNA de-methylation. Its location in the genome also serves as an important regulatory signal for many biological processes and its levels change significantly with the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In keeping with this relationship, the TET family of enzymes which convert 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5hmC are responsive to the presence of Aβ. Using hMeDIP-seq, we show that there is a genome-wide reduction of 5hmC that is found in neurons but not in astrocytes from 3xTg mice (an AD mouse model). Decreased TET enzymatic activities in the brains of persons who died with AD suggest that this reduction is the main cause for the loss of 5hmC. Overexpression of human TET catalytic domains (hTETCDs) from the TET family members, especially for hTET3CD, significantly attenuates the neurodegenerative process, including reduced Aβ accumulation as well as tau hyperphosphorylation, and improve synaptic dysfunction in 3xTg mouse brain. Our findings define a crucial role of deregulated 5hmC epigenetics in the events leading to AD neurodegeneration."
https://openalex.org/W3093034571,"Water deficit limits the establishment of sugarcane plants from pre-sprouted seedlings (PSS). Silicon (Si) can mitigate such stress, and your supply in plants with the active absorption mechanism is carried out through roots. However, foliar spraying has been practiced to supply Si in PSS production nurseries. Althought it is known that Si via roots can alter C: N: P ratios, nothing has been reported about its supply via foliar spraying, nor whether such changes interfere with structural nutrient use efficiency and with plant physiological responses. Thus, this study aimes to asses whether Si foliar spraying changes C: N: P ratios and increases the nutritional efficiency of PSS, as well as whether water deficiency interferes with such a relationships. For these purposes, three experiments were carried out. In experiment I, treatments consisted of two sugarcane cultivars (CTC 4 and RB 966928) and three Si supply forms (in nutrient solution via roots [SiR], via foliar spraying [SiL], and one control with the absence of Si [-Si]). The same Si supply forms were used in the other two experiments. In experiment II, a short-term water deficit was induced by polyethylene glycol addition to nutrient solution (-0.6 MPa) for three days. In experiment III, a long-term water deficit was imposed using levels of soil water retention capacity (70% [no water deficit], 50% [moderate water deficit], and 30% [severe water deficit] for 30 days. Our findings revealed that Si supply decreased C concentrations regardless of water conditions and that N and P concentrations varied with Si supply form and water deficit level. Moreover, root- and foliar-applied Si modified the C: N: P stoichiometry and increased C use efficiency in PSS, which thus increased N and P use efficiencies. Such an increased nutritional performance helped adjust physiological parameters and increase dry matter yield in PSS, both under water stress and non-stress conditions. Further, Si foliar spraying promoted structural effects on PSS regardless of water conditions, even if sugarcane has an active absorption via roots. In conclusion, foliar spraying can be used to supply Si in PSS production nurseries."

This article presents the results of the survey and compares the indicators used in the survey and those in the annual statistical report released by the Eye Bank Association of America (EBAA). The number of corneal transplantations completed by the 64 hospitals from 2014 to 2018 was respectively 5377, 6394, 7595, 8270 and 8980, totally 36,616 (22,959 male and 13,657 female). The five largest hospitals by the number of corneal transplantations completed 15,994 surgeries in total, accounting for 43.68% of all the surgeries performed in the 64 hospitals. The most common indication for corneal transplantations was corneal leukoma (7683, 20.98%), followed by bacterial keratitis (4209, 11.49%), corneal dystrophies (4189, 11.44%), keratoconus (3578, 9.77%) and corneal perforation (2839, 7.75%). The main surgical techniques were penetrating keratoplasty (PK) (19,896, 54.34%), anterior lamellar keratoplasty (ALK) (13,869, 37.88%). The proportion of PK decreased from 57.97% in 2014 to 52.88% in 2018 while the proportion of ALK increased from 36.04% in 2014 to 37.92% in 2018. The geographical distribution of keratoplasties performed in China is unbalanced. PK and ALK were the main techniques of CT and corneal leukoma, bacterial keratitis and corneal dystrophies were the main indications for CT in China."

Aim of this study was to explore how different professions working at Intensive Care Units (ICU) estimate the mobility capacity using the ICU Mobility Score in 10 different scenarios. Methods Ten fictitious patient-scenarios and guideline-related knowledge were assessed using an online survey. Critical care team members in German-speaking countries were invited to participate. All datasets including professional data and at least one scenario were analyzed. Kruskal Wallis test was used for the individual scenarios, while a linear mixed-model was used over all responses. Results In total, 515 of 788 (65%) participants could be evaluated. Physicians (p = 0.001) and nurses (p = 0.002) selected a lower ICU Mobility Score (-0.7 95% CI -1.1 to -0.3 and -0.4 95% CI -0.7 to -0.2, respectively) than physical therapists, while other specialists did not (p = 0.81). Participants who classified themselves as experts or could define early mobilization in accordance to the “S2e guideline: positioning and early mobilisation in prophylaxis or therapy of pulmonary disorders” correctly selected higher mobilization levels (0.2 95% CI 0.0 to 0.4, p = 0.049 and 0.3 95% CI 0.1 to 0.5, p = 0.002, respectively). Conclusion Different professions scored the mobilization capacity of patients differently, with nurses and physicians estimating significantly lower capacity than physical therapists. The exact knowledge of guidelines and recommendations, such as the definition of early mobilization, independently lead to a higher score. Interprofessional education, interprofessional rounds and mobilization activities could further enhance knowledge and practice of mobilization in the critical care team."
https://openalex.org/W3093038713,"Importin α proteins play a central role in the transport of cargo from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. In this study, we observed that male knock-out mice for importin α4, which is encoded by the Kpna4 gene (Kpna4-/- ), were subfertile and yielded smaller litter sizes than those of wild-type (WT) males. In contrast, mice lacking the closely related importin α3 (Kpna3-/- ) were fertile. In vitro fertilization and sperm motility assays demonstrated that sperm from Kpna4-/- mice had significantly reduced quality and motility. In addition, acrosome reaction was also impaired in Kpna4-/- mice. Transmission electron microscopy revealed striking defects, including abnormal head morphology and multiple axoneme structures in the flagella of Kpna4-/- mice. A five-fold increase in the frequency of abnormalities in Kpna4-/- mice compared to WT mice indicates the functional importance of importin α4 in normal sperm development. Moreover, Nesprin-2, which is a component of the linker of nucleus and cytoskeleton complex, was expressed at lower levels in sperm from Kpna4-/- mice and was localized with abnormal axonemes, suggesting incorrect formation of the nuclear membrane-cytoskeleton structure during spermiogenesis. Proteomics analysis of Kpna4-/- testis showed significantly altered expression of proteins related to sperm formation, which provided evidence that genetic loss of importin α4 perturbed chromatin status. Collectively, these findings indicate that importin α4 is critical for establishing normal sperm morphology in mice, providing new insights into male germ cell development by highlighting the requirement of importin α4 for normal fertility."
https://openalex.org/W3092855613,"HIV-1 enters the brain by altering properties of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Recent evidence indicates that among cells of the BBB, pericytes are prone to HIV-1 infection. Occludin (ocln) and caveolin-1 (cav-1) are critical determinants of BBB integrity that can regulate barrier properties of the BBB in response to HIV-1 infection. Additionally, Alix is an early acting endosomal factor involved in HIV-1 budding from the cells. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the role of cav-1, ocln, and Alix in HIV-1 infection of brain pericytes. Our results indicated that cav-1, ocln, and Alix form a multi-protein complex in which they cross-regulate each other's expression. Importantly, the stability of this complex was affected by HIV-1 infection. Modifications of the complex resulted in diminished HIV-1 infection and alterations of the cytokine profile produced by brain pericytes. These results identify a novel mechanism involved in HIV-1 infection contributing to a better understanding of the HIV-1 pathology and the associated neuroinflammatory responses."

Numerous setting-based and individual-based interventions for student mental health have been proposed in the literature. However, the student perspective on those interventions has been largely neglected. This study aims to explore how medical students perceive different interventions and if they desire any additional changes with regard to their studies. Eight focus groups with 71 participants were conducted at a large German medical school. Focus groups were recorded, transcribed and content-analyzed using MAXQDA 18. We found that medical students prefer setting-based interventions. Most proposed interventions were on a setting-based level. For instance, students asked for more information on the university’s psychosocial counseling services and for better information management regarding contact persons. Interventions proposed in the literature received mixed reactions: Several participants did not favour a pass/fail grading system. Students considered a peer-to-peer mentoring program for freshmen very helpful. Students had diverse attitudes towards Balint groups. They approved of several self-management courses, most of them being related to time or stress management. Interestingly, the most urgently wanted interventions appear to be rather easy to implement (e.g. a mentoring program). This study explored the medical student perspective on student mental health interventions. Additionally, our study illustrates the benefit and feasibility of involving students early on in the conception of interventions. Further research with a representative sample is needed to obtain broader information on the acceptance of the suggested interventions."
https://openalex.org/W3093340375,"National spatial planning has strongly influenced urban development and open space preservation in the Netherlands since the 1950s and established the country’s reputation as a planner’s paradise. The gradual withdrawal from this active and stringent type of planning in favour of decentralisation and deregulation has received less attention and its impacts on urban development patterns remain poorly studied. This study investigates residential development since 2000 in relation to the changing planning context. We focused on residential densification and the redevelopment of greyfields and brownfields as desired outcomes of policies that aim to limit urban development in open landscapes. Using detailed spatial housing and land-use data we quantified the relative importance of different urban development processes over three subsequent six-year periods characterised by slowly decreasing national policy attention to steering residential development. Our results indicate that, while the national policy instruments got weaker, the share of residential development within existing urban areas increased. Our results lend further credence to the suggestion that the abandoned national spatial planning policy targeted at housing construction within urban development zones that were predominantly defined on greenfield near existing cities, limited urban redevelopment. Despite reduced government spending, densities increased within existing urban areas as general, local-level restrictive policies with respect to greenfield development remained in place and demand for urban housing remained unabated."

When the goal is investigating complex-phenotypes under varying conditions, it comes naturally to employ comparative network methods. While approaches for comparing two networks exist, this is not the case for multiple networks. Here we present a method for the systematic comparison of an unlimited number of networks: Co-expression Differential Network Analysis (CoDiNA) for detecting links and nodes that are common, specific or different to the networks. Applying CoDiNA to a neurogenesis study identified genes for neuron differentiation. Experimentally overexpressing one candidate resulted in significant disturbance in the underlying neurogenesis' gene regulatory network. We compared data from adults and children with active tuberculosis to test for signatures of HIV. We also identified common and distinct network features for particular cancer types with CoDiNA. These studies show that CoDiNA successfully detects genes associated with the diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3093430209,"Organisms adapt to their environment through coordinated changes in mitochondrial function and metabolism. The mitochondrial protonmotive force (PMF) is an electrochemical gradient that powers ATP synthesis and adjusts metabolism to energetic demands via cellular signaling. It is unknown how or where transient PMF changes are sensed and signaled due to the lack of precise spatiotemporal control in vivo. We addressed this by expressing a light-activated proton pump in mitochondria to spatiotemporally ""turn off"" mitochondrial function through PMF dissipation in tissues with light. We applied our construct-mitochondria-OFF (mtOFF)-to understand how metabolic status impacts hypoxia resistance, a response that relies on mitochondrial function. Activation of mtOFF induced starvation-like behavior mediated by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). We found prophylactic mtOFF activation increased survival following hypoxia, and that protection relied on neuronal AMPK. Our study links spatiotemporal control of mitochondrial PMF to cellular metabolic changes that mediate behavior and stress resistance."
https://openalex.org/W3092819850,"Background Globally, health care-associated infections had become serious public health importance. Compliance with standard safety precaution is effective and inexpensive measure to improve quality of healthcare in reducing occurrence of healthcare associated infections. In developing countries, like Ethiopia adherence to recommended standard safety precaution is scanty. Objective To assess level of compliance with standard safety precaution and associated factors among healthcare workers in Hawassa comprehensive specialized hospital Southern Ethiopia. Methods An institutional based cross-sectional study was conducted at Hawassa comprehensive specialized hospital. Data were collected by using self-administered questionnaire. Study participants were allocated proportionally based on their profession by using stratified random sampling method. Data were entered and analyzed by using SPSS version 20.0. Bi-variable analysis and multi variable logistic regression model were used to check which variables were associated with dependent variable. P-values ≤ 0.05 were considered statistically significant. In this study the overall compliance with standard safety precaution among healthcare workers were only 56.5%. Being female healthcare worker AOR: 2.76(1.34, 5.54), married healthcare workers AOR: 4.2(2, 9.03), accessibility of safety box AOR: 3.4(1.6, 7.17), HCWs had perceived IP training AOR: 3.99(1.46, 10.9), availability of tape water AOR: 2.68(1.15, 6.2) and healthcare workers had internal infection prevention and control supportive supervision AOR: 5.8(2.54, 13.48) associated with compliance with standard safety precaution. Conclusion According to findings of the current study, overall level of compliance with standard SP among HCWs considered to be very low. Factors such as healthcare workers being female, accessibility of safety box, availability of running tape water, training and supportive supervision were independent predictors of compliance with standard safety precaution. Thus ensuring availability and accessibility of safety precaution materials and regular observing and supervising healthcare workers’ practices are highly recommended."
https://openalex.org/W3092947094,"The management of germplasm banks is complex, especially when many accessions are involved. Microsatellite markers are an efficient tool for assessing the genetic diversity of germplasm collections, optimizing their use in breeding programs. This study genetically characterizes a large collection of 410 grapevine accessions maintained at the Agronomic Institute of Campinas (IAC) (Brazil). The accessions were genotyped with 17 highly polymorphic microsatellite markers. Genetic data were analyzed to determine the genetic structure of the germplasm, quantify its allelic diversity, suggest the composition of a core collection, and discover cases of synonymy, duplication, and misnaming. A total of 304 alleles were obtained, and 334 unique genotypes were identified. The molecular profiles of 145 accessions were confirmed according to the literature and databases, and the molecular profiles of more than 100 genotypes were reported for the first time. The analysis of the genetic structure revealed different levels of stratification. The primary division was between accessions related to Vitis vinifera and V. labrusca, followed by their separation from wild grapevine. A core collection of 120 genotypes captured 100% of all detected alleles. The accessions selected for the core collection may be used in future phenotyping efforts, in genome association studies, and for conservation purposes. Genetic divergence among accessions has practical applications in grape breeding programs, as the choice of relatively divergent parents will maximize the frequency of progeny with superior characteristics. Together, our results can enhance the management of grapevine germplasm and guide the efficient exploitation of genetic diversity to facilitate the development of new grape cultivars for fresh fruits, wine, and rootstock."
https://openalex.org/W3093389249,"The ability of heart valve cells to respond to their mechanical environment represents a key mechanism by which the integrity and function of valve cusps is maintained. A number of different mechanotransduction pathways have been implicated in the response of valve cells to mechanical stimulation. In this study, we explore the expression pattern of several mechanosensitive ion channels (MSC) and their potential to mediate mechanosensitive responses of human valve interstitial cells (VIC).MSC presence and function were probed using the patch clamp technique. Protein abundance of key MSC was evaluated by Western blotting in isolated fibroblastic VIC (VICFB) and in VIC differentiated towards myofibroblastic (VICMB) or osteoblastic (VICOB) phenotypes. Expression was compared in non-calcified and calcified human aortic valves. MSC contributions to stretch-induced collagen gene expression and to VIC migration were assessed by pharmacological inhibition of specific channels.Two MSC types were recorded in VICFB: potassium selective and cation non-selective channels. In keeping with functional data, the presence of both TREK-1 and Kir6.1 (potassium selective), as well as TRPM4, TRPV4 and TRPC6 (cationic non-selective) channels was confirmed in VIC at the protein level. Differentiation of VICFB into VICMB or VICOB phenotypes was associated with a lower expression of TREK-1 and Kir6.1, and a higher expression of TRPV4 and TRPC6. Differences in MSC expression were also seen in non-calcified vs calcified aortic valves where TREK-1, TRPM4 and TRPV4 expression were higher in calcified compared to control tissues. Cyclic stretch-induced expression of COL I mRNA in cultured VICFB was blocked by RN-9893, a selective inhibitor of TRPV4 channels while having no effect on the stretch-induced expression of COL III. VICFB migration was blocked with the non-specific MSC blocker streptomycin and by GSK417651A an inhibitor of TRPC6/3.Aortic VIC express a range of MSC that play a role in functional responses of these cells to mechanical stimulation. MSC expression levels differ in calcified and non-calcified valves in ways that are in part compatible with the change in expression seen between VIC phenotypes. These changes in MSC expression, and associated alterations in the ability of VIC to respond to their mechanical environment, may form novel targets for intervention during aortic valvulopathies."
https://openalex.org/W3092769412,"Landscape structure influences the distribution and abundance of anopheline mosquitoes and has an indirect impact on malaria transmission. This work aimed to determine the effect of land cover and landscape fragmentation on anopheline mosquito abundance and diversity in an important Colombian malaria endemic area, the Bajo Cauca region. Diversity indices were calculated for Anopheles mosquitoes collected in various localities of the region. Land cover types were characterized using orthorectified aerial photographs to estimate landscape metrics. The relationship between landscape fragmentation and species diversity was evaluated by regression analysis. The correlation between species abundance and land cover types was determined using canonical correspondence analyses. Results showed a statistically significant tendency for a lower diversity of the Anopheles community in landscapes with higher patch number, patch density and effective mesh size. For most species, there was evidence of a significant relationship between species abundance and land covers modified by anthropic activities which generate forest loss. These results indicate that activities that modify the landscape structure and land cover composition generate changes that affect the spatial distribution and composition of epidemiologically-important Anopheles species, which may impact malaria distribution in a region. This information is useful to guide control interventions that promote unfavorable landscapes for malaria vector propagation."
https://openalex.org/W3092911958,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a Gram-negative opportunistic pathogen that produces numerous virulence factors and causes serious infections in trauma patients and patients with severe burns. We previously showed that the growth of P. aeruginosa in blood from severely burned or trauma patients altered the expression of numerous genes. However, the specific influence of whole blood from healthy volunteers on P. aeruginosa gene expression is not known. Transcriptome analysis of P. aeruginosa grown for 4 h in blood from healthy volunteers compared to that when grown in laboratory medium revealed that the expression of 1085 genes was significantly altered. Quorum sensing (QS), QS-related, and pyochelin synthesis genes were downregulated, while genes of the type III secretion system and those for pyoverdine synthesis were upregulated. The observed effect on the QS and QS-related genes was shown to reside within serum fraction: growth of PAO1 in the presence of 10% human serum from healthy volunteers significantly reduced the expression of QS and QS-regulated genes at 2 and 4 h of growth but significantly enhanced their expression at 8 h. Additionally, the production of QS-regulated virulence factors, including LasA and pyocyanin, was also influenced by the presence of human serum. Serum fractionation experiments revealed that part of the observed effect resides within the serum fraction containing <10-kDa proteins. Growth in serum reduced the production of many PAO1 outer membrane proteins but enhanced the production of others including OprF, a protein previously shown to play a role in the regulation of QS gene expression. These results suggest that factor(s) within human serum: 1) impact P. aeruginosa pathogenesis by influencing the expression of different genes; 2) differentially regulate the expression of QS and QS-related genes in a growth phase- or time-dependent mechanism; and 3) manipulate the production of P. aeruginosa outer membrane proteins."
https://openalex.org/W3093416066,"Orthostatic hypotension (OH) frequently accompanies autonomic dysfunction and is an important risk factor for cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease (PD). While OH is usually diagnosed based on an orthostatic blood pressure drop, the association between the heart rate response and cognitive impairment remains unclear. We retrospectively analyzed 143 cases of clinically diagnosed PD to determine the association between the absence of a heart rate response and cognitive impairment in PD with OH. Among the patients with OH, neurogenic OH was diagnosed in cases without a heart rate increase, while all other patients were diagnosed with non-neurogenic OH. Dementia was found in 23 of 143 PD cases (16.1%) in this cohort. The presence of OH was an independent risk factor for dementia in PD in addition to the disease severity, years of education and beta-blockers use. Neurogenic OH was significantly associated with dementia compared to the no OH group (hazard ratio [HR] 7.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.2-24.6, P<0.01), an association that was preserved after adjusting for age, gender and other covariant factors. However, no such association was observed for non-neurogenic OH (HR 2.9, 95%CI 0.8-10.9, P = 0.12). While the cognitive impairment was significantly worse in the neurogenic OH group than the no-OH group, the groups were otherwise similar. The blood pressure decrease was significantly lower in both OH groups than in the no-OH group, despite no significant differences between the OH groups. Our finding showed that OH without a heart rate response was an important predictor of cognitive impairment in PD."
https://openalex.org/W3092799602,"Nucleic acid detection by electrophoresis is still a quick and accessible technique for many diagnosis methods, primarily at research laboratories or at the point of care units. Standard protocols detect DNA/RNA molecules through specific bound chemical dyes using a UV-transilluminator or UV-photo documentation system. However, the acquisition costs and availability of these devices, mainly the ones with photography and internet connection capabilities, can be prohibitive, especially in developing countries public health units. Also, ultraviolet radiation is a common additional risk factor to professionals that use electrophoresis-based nucleic acid detection. With that in mind, this work describes the development of a low-cost DNA/RNA detection smart system capable of obtaining qualitative and semi-quantitative data from gel analysis. The proposed device explores the visible light absorption range of commonly used DNA/RNA dyes using readily available parts, and simple manufacturing processes, such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and 3D impression. By applying IoT techniques, our system covers a wide range of color spectrum in order to detect bands from various commercially used dyes, using Bluetooth communication and a smartphone for hardware control, image capturing, and sharing. The project also enables process scalability and has low manufacturing and maintenance costs. The use of LEDs at the visible spectrum can achieve very reproducible images, providing a high potential for rapid and point-of-care diagnostics as well as applications in several fields such as healthcare, agriculture, and aquaculture."
https://openalex.org/W3092840333,"Background Tuberculosis (TB) stigma remains a barrier to early diagnosis and treatment completion. Increased understanding of stigma is necessary for improved interventions to minimise TB stigma and its effects. The purpose of this study is to quantitatively measure TB stigma and to explore qualitatively its manifestation among TB patients in a rural Kenyan community. Methods This hospital based study using explanatory sequential mixed methods approach was conducted in 2016. In the quantitative part of the study, a questionnaire containing socio-demographic characteristics and scales measuring perceived TB stigma and experienced TB stigma, was administered to 208 adult pulmonary TB patients receiving treatment in West Pokot County. Respondents with high stigma were purposively selected to take part in in-depth interviews and focus group discussions. The qualitative data were collected through 15 in-depth interviews and 6 focus group discussions with TB patients. Descriptive and bivariate analysis was done for the quantitative data while the thematic analysis was done for qualitative data. Results The internal consistency reliability coefficients were satisfactory with Cronbach alphas of 0.87 and 0.86 for the 11-item and 12-item stigma measurement scale. The investigation revealed that TB stigma was high. The key drivers of TB stigma were the association of TB with HIV/AIDS and the fear of TB transmission. TB stigma was exemplified through patients being isolated by others, self-isolation, fear to disclose TB diagnosis, association of TB with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and lack of social support. Being a woman was significantly associated with high levels of both experienced stigma (p = 0.007) and perceived stigma (p = 0.005) while age, marital status, occupation and the patient’s religion were not. Conclusion There is a need to implement stigma reduction interventions in order to improve TB program outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3092882583,"This study used a health belief theory derived framework and structural equation model to examine moderators, mediators, and direct and indirect predictors of childhood vaccination.A secondary analysis was conducted using data collected from a cross-sectional survey of a random sample of 1599 parents living in urban and rural areas of Mysore district, India. Applying two-stage probability proportionate-to-size sampling, adolescent girls attending 7th through 10th grades in 23 schools were selected to take home a questionnaire to be answered by their parents to primarily assess HPV vaccine intentions. Parents were also asked whether their children had received one dose of Bacillus Calmette-Guérin; three doses of Diphtheria, Pertussis, Tetanus; three doses of oral Polio vaccine; and one dose of Measles vaccine. In addition, parents were asked about their attitudes towards childhood vaccination.Out of the 1599 parents, 52.2% reported that their children had received all the routine vaccines (fully vaccinated); 42.7% reported their children had missed at least one routine vaccine, and 5.2% reported that their children had missed all routine vaccinations. Perceptions about the benefits/facilitators to childhood vaccination significantly predicted the full vaccination rate (standardized regression coefficient (β) = 0.29) directly and mediated the effect of parental education (β = 0.11) and employment (β = -0.06) on the rate of full vaccination. Parental education was significantly associated indirectly with higher rates of full vaccination (β = 0.11). Parental employment was significantly associated indirectly with decreasing rates of full vaccination (β = -0.05). Area of residence moderated the role of religion (β = 0.24) and the 'number of children' in a family (β = 0.33) on parental perceptions about barriers to childhood vaccination. The model to data fit was acceptable (Root Mean Square Error of Approximation = 0.02, 95% CI 0.018 to 0.023; Comparative Fit Index = 0.92; Tucker-Lewis Index = 0.91).Full vaccination rate was relatively low among children in Mysore, especially among parents who were unsure about the benefits of routine vaccination and those with low educational levels. Interventions increasing awareness of the benefits of childhood vaccination that target rural parents with lower levels of education may help increase the rate of full childhood vaccination in India."
https://openalex.org/W3092789803,"Background Campylobacter infections in HIV positive patients often present with substantial mortality and morbidity when compared to HIV negative patients. Aim This study assessed the prevalence of Campylobacter, antibiotic resistance phenotypes and genetic factors, and risk of Campylobacter infection associated with living in close proximity to domestic animals in HIV patients with gastric enteritis at Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital, Accra, Ghana. Methods Resistance to different antibiotics was assessed with Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method. In addition, all the Campylobacter isolates were tested for ampicillin (blaOXA-61), erythromycin (aph-3-1), tetracycline tet(O), streptomycin (aadE), and the energy-dependent multi-drug efflux pump (cmeB) resistance genes using multiplex polymerase chain reaction. Results Out of a total of 140 (97 females and 43 males) tested patients, 71 (50.7%) patients were positive for Campylobacter coli. Female patients aged within 31-40 years (31.6%) and 41-50 years (31.6%) had high frequency of Campylobacter infection. Most of the infected patients lived in close proximity to chickens (53.5%), however, some patients (14.1%) lived in close proximity to goats. Phenotypic resistance evaluation revealed widespread resistance to ampicillin (100%), tetracycline (100%), ciprofloxacin (71.8%), erythromycin (69%), and gentamicin (49.3%). However, limited no of isolates contained blaOXA-61 (1.41%), cmeB (7.0%) and tet(O (7.0%) resistance genes. Conclusion HIV patients with gastric enteritis were infected with resistant Campylobacter coli. Further studies are required to examine correlation of infected patients with C. coli and risk of living in close proximity to poultry birds. There is the need for routine investigation of Campylobacter in patients with gastroenteritis in order to assist in the development of strategies for combating diseases involving resistant zoonotic bacteria strains."
https://openalex.org/W3092917958,"Intestinal inflammatory disorders, such as inflammatory bowel disease, are major contributors to mortality and morbidity in humans and animals worldwide. While some native peptides have great potential as therapeutic agents against intestinal inflammation, potential cytotoxicity, anti-inciting action, and suppression of anti-inflammatory activity may limit their development as anti-inflammatory agents. Peptide hybridization is an effective approach for the design and engineering of novel functional peptides because hybrid peptides combine the advantages and benefits of various native peptides. In the present study, a novel hybrid anti-inflammatory peptide that combines the active center of Cecropin A (C) and the core functional region of LL-37 (L) was designed [C-L peptide; C (1-8)-L (17-30)] through in silico analysis to reduce cytotoxicity and improve the anti-inflammatory activity of the parental peptides. The resulting C-L peptide exhibited lower cytotoxicity than either C or L peptides alone. C-L also exerted a protective effect against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory responses in RAW264.7 macrophages and in the intestines of a mouse model. The hybrid peptide exhibited increased anti-inflammatory activity compared to the parental peptides. C-L plays a role in protecting intestinal tissue from damage, LPS-induced weight loss, and leukocyte infiltration. In addition, C-L reduces the expression levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-1β, and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), as well as reduces cell apoptosis. It also reduced mucosal barrier damage caused by LPS. The anti-inflammatory effects of the hybrid peptide were mainly attributed to its LPS-neutralizing activity and antagonizing the activation of LPS-induced Toll-like receptor 4-myeloid differentiation factor 2 (TLR4/MD2). The peptide also affected the TLR4-(nuclear factor κB) signaling pathway, modulating the inflammatory response upon LPS stimulation. Collectively, these findings suggest that the newly designed peptide, C-L, could be developed into a novel anti-inflammatory agent for animals or humans."
https://openalex.org/W3092982246,"Chemotherapy-induced alopecia (CIA) represents the most distressing side-effect for cancer patients. Scalp cooling is currently the only treatment to combat CIA, yet little is known about its cytoprotective effects in human hair follicles (HF). We have previously established in vitro human keratinocyte models to study the effects of taxanes and anthracyclines routinely-used clinically and reported that cooling markedly-reduced or even completely-prevented cytotoxicity in a temperature dependent manner. Using these models (including HF-derived primary keratinocytes), we now demonstrate that cooling markedly attenuates cellular uptake of the anthracyclines doxorubicin and epirubicin to reduce or prevent drug-mediated human keratinocyte cytotoxicity. We show marked reduction in drug uptake and nuclear localization qualitatively by fluorescence microscopy. We have also devised a flow cytometry-based methodology that permitted semi-quantitative analysis of differences in drug uptake, which demonstrated that cooling can reduce drug uptake by up to ~8-fold in comparison to normal/physiological temperature, an effect that was temperature-dependent. Our results provide evidence that attenuation of cellular drug uptake represents at least one of the mechanisms underpinning the ability of cooling to rescue human keratinocytes from chemotherapy drug-cytotoxicity, thus supporting the clinical efficacy of scalp cooling."
https://openalex.org/W3093040910,"Little is known about the barriers and benefits of home-based HIV services offered by community health workers. These are especially important as the South African government embarks on scaling up community-based health services, which include HIV care. This study set out to understand potential benefits and barriers of these services in Tshwane district and develop recommendations for improvement. From June to August 2019, seven focus group discussions were conducted with 58 participants: four with 36 ward-based outreach team (WBOT) members and three with 22 people living with HIV (PLWHIV). Three aspects of care were explored: 1. Experience of performing, receiving or observing home-based HIV care; 2. Barriers to conducting home visits; and 3. The perceived value of WBOTs and home-based HIV care. While home-based HIV care was seen as a support strategy which could motivate patients to take their medication, the unpredictability of patients' responses to HIV test results, incorrect addresses (driven by the need for identity documents), fear of stigma through association with WBOTs, especially those in uniform, little or no preparation of patients for home-based care, and lack of confidentiality and trust were raised as potential barriers. To successfully implement effective home-based HIV care in South Africa, perceived barriers should be addressed and recommendations offered by people providing and receiving these services should be seriously considered. Pertinent recommendations include integrating WBOTs into clinics and existing support structures, improving training on confidentiality and HIV testing, and rethinking the recruitment, scope of work and safety of WBOTs. In addition, research should be conducted into the impact of the requirements for identity documents and community health worker uniforms."
https://openalex.org/W3093118962,"SR-BI binds various lipoproteins, including HDL, LDL as well as VLDL, and mediates selective cholesteryl ester (CE) uptake. HDL derived CE accumulates in cellular lipid droplets (LDs), which also store triacylglycerol (TAG). We hypothesized that SR-BI could significantly facilitate LD formation, in part, by directly transporting LDL derived neutral lipids (NL) such as CE and TAG into LDs without lipolysis and de novo lipid synthesis. SR-BI overexpression greatly increased LDL uptake and LD formation in stably transfected HeLa cells (SR-BI-HeLa). LDs isolated from SR-BI-HeLa contained 4- and 7-times more CE and TAG, respectively, than mock-transfected HeLa (Mock-HeLa). In contrast, LDL receptor overexpression in HeLa (LDLr-HeLa) greatly increased LDL uptake, degradation with moderate 1.5- and 2-fold increases of CE and TAG, respectively. Utilizing CE and TAG analogs, BODIPY-TAG (BP-TAG) and BODIPY-CE (BP-CE), for tracking LDL NL, we found that after initial binding of LDL to SR-BI-HeLa, apoB remained at the cell surface, while BP-CE and BP-TAG were sorted and simultaneously transported together to LDs. Both lipids demonstrated limited internalization to lysosomes or endoplasmic reticulum in SR-BI-HeLa. In LDLr-HeLa, NLs demonstrated clear lysosomal sequestration without their sorting to LDs. An inhibition of TAG and CE de novo synthesis by 90–95% only reduced TAG and CE LD content by 45–50%, and had little effect on BP-CE and BP-TAG transport to LDs in SR-BI HeLa. Furthermore, intravenous infusion of 1–2 mg of LDL increased liver LDs in normal (WT) but not in SR-BI KO mice. Mice transgenic for human SR-BI demonstrated higher liver LD accumulation than WT mice. Finally, Electro Spray Infusion Mass Spectrometry (ESI-MS) using deuterated d-CE found that LDs accumulated up to 40% of unmodified d-CE LDL. We conclude that SR-BI mediates LDL-induced LD formation in vitro and in vivo. In addition to cytosolic NL hydrolysis and de novo lipid synthesis, this process includes selective sorting and transport of LDL NL to LDs with limited lysosomal NL sequestration and the transport of LDL CE, and TAG directly to LDs independently of de novo synthesis."

Multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (MDRGN) are found with rising prevalence in non-hemodialysis risk populations as well as hemodialysis (HD) cohorts in Asia, Europe and North America. At the same time, colonization and consecutive infections with such pathogens may increase mortality and morbidity of affected individuals. We aimed to monitor intestinal MDRGN colonization in a yet not investigated German HD population.


Methods 
We performed cross-sectional point-prevalence testing with 12 months follow-up and selected testing of relatives in an out-patient HD cohort of n = 77 patients by using microbiological cultures from fresh stool samples, combined with Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization—Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing.


Results 
We detected MDRGN in 8 out of 77 patients (10.4%) and 1 out of 22 relatives (4.5%), indicating only colonization and no infections. At follow-up, 2 patients showed phenotypic persistence of MDRGN colonization, and in 6 other patients de-novo MDRGN colonization could be demonstrated. Pathogens included Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae (with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase [ESBL]-production as well as fluoroquinolone resistance), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Enterobacter cloacae.


Conclusions 
In a single-center study, MDRGN colonization rates were below those found in non-HD high-risk populations and HD units in the US, respectively. Reasons for this could be high hygiene standards and a strict antibiotic stewardship policy with evidence of low consumption of fluoroquinolones and carbapenems in our HD unit and the affiliated hospital."
https://openalex.org/W3092691186,"Cell surface trafficking of many G protein-coupled receptors is tightly regulated. Among them, the mandatory heterodimer GABAB receptor for the main inhibitory neurotransmitter, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), is a model. In mammals, its cell surface trafficking is highly controlled by an endoplasmic reticulum retention signal in the C-terminal intracellular region of the GB1 subunit that is masked through a coiled-coil interaction with the GB2 subunit. Here, we investigate the molecular basis for the export of its homolog in Drosophila melanogaster that regulates the circadian rhythm and sleep. In contrast to mammals, the endoplasmic retention signal is carried by GB2, while GB1 reaches the cell surface alone. NMR analysis showed that the coiled-coil domain that controls GABAB heterodimer formation is structurally conserved between flies and mammals, despite specific features. These findings show the adaptation of a similar quality control system during evolution for maintaining the subunit composition of a functional heterodimeric receptor."
https://openalex.org/W3092932345,"Background Improving access and quality in health care is a pressing issue worldwide and pay for performance (P4P) strategies have emerged as an alternative to enhance structure, process and outcomes in health. In 2011, Brazil adopted its first P4P scheme at national level, the National Programme for Improving Primary Care Access and Quality (PMAQ). The contribution of PMAQ in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals related to maternal and childcare remains under investigated in Brazil. Objective To estimate the association of PMAQ with the provision of maternal and childcare in Brazil, controlling for socioeconomic, geographic and family health team characteristics. Method We used cross-sectional quantile regression (QR) models for two periods, corresponding to 33,368 Family Health Teams (FHTs) in the first cycle and 39,211 FHTs in the second cycle of PMAQ. FHTs were analysed using data from the Brazilian Ministry of Health (SIAB and CNES) and the Brazilian Institute for Geography and Statistics (IBGE). Results The average number of antenatal consultations per month were positively associated with PMAQ participating teams, with larger effect in the lower tail (10th and 25th quantiles) of the conditional distribution of the response variable. There was a positive association between PMAQ and the average number of consultations under 2 years old per month in the 10th and 25th quantiles, but a negative association in the upper tail (75th and 90th quantiles). For the average number of physician consultations for children under 1 year old per month, PMAQ participating teams were positively associated with the response variable in the lower tail, but different from the previous models, there is no clear evidence that the second cycle gives larger coefficients compared with first cycle. Conclusion PMAQ has contributed to increase the provision of care to pregnant women and children under 2 years at primary healthcare level. Teams with lower average number of antenatal or child consultations benefited the most by participating in PMAQ, which suggests that PMAQ might motivate worse performing health providers to catch up."
https://openalex.org/W3093059540,"Maximal hyperaemia for fractional flow reserve (FFR) may not be achieved with the current recommended doses of intracoronary adenosine. Higher doses (up to 720 μg) have been reported to optimize hyperaemic stimuli in small dose-response studies. Real-world data from a large cohort of patients is needed to evaluate FFR results and the safety of high-dose escalation. This is a retrospective study aimed to evaluate the safety and frequency of FFR ≤0.8 after high-dose escalation of intracoronary adenosine. Data were extracted from the medical databases of two university hospitals. Increasing doses (100, 200, 400, 600, and 800 μg) of adenosine were administered as intracoronary boluses until FFR ≤0.8 was achieved or heart block developed. The percentage of FFR ≤0.8 after higher-dose escalation was compared with those at conventional doses, and the predictors for FFR ≤0.8 after higher doses were analysed. In the 1163 vessels of 878 patients, 402 vessels (34.6%) achieved FFR ≤0.8 at conventional doses and 623 vessels (53.6%) received high-dose escalation. An additional 84 vessels (13.5%) achieved FFR ≤0.8 after high-dose escalation. No major complications developed during high-dose escalation. Borderline FFR (0.81-0.85) at the conventional dose, stenosis >60%, and triple-vessel disease increased the likelihood of FFR ≤0.8 after high-dose escalation, but chronic kidney disease decreased it. For vessels of borderline FFR at conventional doses, 46% achieved FFR ≤0.8 after high-dose escalation. In conclusion, High-dose escalation of intracoronary adenosine increases the frequency of FFR ≤0.8 without major complications. It could be especially feasible for borderline FFR values near the 0.8 diagnostic threshold."
https://openalex.org/W3093346564,"Morphological indices of vegetative organs or reproductive organs, which are often used to analyze the evolution and classify Clematis, indicate that Clematis serratifolia and C. glauca could be related members at similar evolutionary levels.

Embryonic characteristics, which are more stable, are commonly used to estimate the phylogeny and evolution of angiosperms. We studied the microsporogenesis, microgametogenesis, megasporogenesis and macrogametogenesis development of C. serratifolia, and compared the early embryological characteristics among C. serratifolia, C. serratifolia and other Clematis species reported to provide a reference for the taxonomy of the genus Clematis. Our results showed that C. serratifolia and C. glauca differ in megaspore formation and nucellus types suggesting that they have originated from different ancestors. The differences among Clematis were mainly found in the type of the anther wall development, tapetum, pollen grains, megaspore formation and nucellus types."
https://openalex.org/W3092804648,"Introduction Despite a resurgence of disease, risk factors for pertussis in children in low and middle-income countries are poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate risk factors for pertussis disease in African children hospitalized with severe LRTI. Methods A prospective study of children hospitalized with severe LRTI in Cape Town, South Africa was conducted over a one-year period. Nasopharyngeal and induced sputum samples from child and nasopharyngeal sample from caregiver were tested for Bordetella pertussis using PCR (IS481+/hIS1001). History and clinical details were documented. Results 460 children with a median age of 8 (IQR 4-18) months were enrolled. B. pertussis infection was confirmed in 32 (7.0%). The adjusted risk of confirmed pertussis was significantly increased if infants were younger than two months [aRR 2.37 (95% CI 1.03-5.42]), HIV exposed but uninfected (aRR 3.53 [95% CI 1.04-12.01]) or HIV infected (aRR 4.35 [95% CI 1.24-15.29]). Mild (aRR 2.27 [95% CI 1.01-5.09]) or moderate (aRR 2.70 [95% CI 1.13-6.45]) under-nutrition in the children were also associated with higher risk. The highest adjusted risk occurred in children whose caregivers had B. pertussis detected from nasopharyngeal swabs (aRR 13.82 [95% CI 7.76-24.62]). Completion of the primary vaccine schedule (three or more doses) was protective (aRR 0.28 [95% CI 0.10-0.75]). Conclusions HIV exposure or infection, undernutrition as well as detection of maternal nasal B. pertussis were associated with increased risk of pertussis in African children, especially in young infants. Completed primary vaccination was protective. There is an urgent need to improve primary pertussis vaccine coverage in low and middle-income countries. Pertussis vaccination of pregnant women, especially those with HIV infection should be prioritized."
https://openalex.org/W3092810443,"Background Early infant diagnosis (EID) establishes the presence of HIV infection in HIV-exposed infants and children younger than 18 months of age. EID services are hospital-based, and thus fail to capture HIV-exposed infants who are not brought to the hospital for care. Point-of-care (POC) diagnostic systems deployed in the community could increase the proportion tested and linked to treatment, but little feasibility and acceptability data is available. Methods Semi-structured interviews (n = 74) were conducted by a Kenyan team with community members (Community Health Workers/Volunteers [CHW/CHV], Traditional Birth Attendants [TBAs], community leaders) and parents of HIV-exposed infants at four study sites in Kenya to elicit feedback on the acceptability and feasibility of community-based POC HIV testing. Results Participants described existing community health resources that could be leveraged to support integration of community-based POC HIV testing; however, the added demand placed on CHW/CHV could pose a challenge. Participants indicated that other potential barriers (concerns about confidentiality, disclosure, and HIV stigma) could be overcome with strong engagement from trusted community leaders and health providers, community sensitization, and strategic location and timing of testing. These steps were seen to improve acceptability and maximize the recognized benefits (rapid results, improved reach) of community-based testing. Conclusion Community members felt that with strategic planning and engagement, community-based POC HIV testing could be a feasible and acceptable strategy to overcome the existing barriers of hospital-based EID."

Anthropology literature suggests that these games may be associated with socio-economic complexity of the ethnic groups—the so-called games in culture hypothesis. I revisit this hypothesis with better data and motivated by anecdotal evidence, introduce a contemporary hypothesis, origins of entrepreneurship hypothesis—that descendants of societies that played complex mancala games are more likely to be engaged in non-farm self-employment today. I compile the first comprehensive database of mancala games in Africa matched to ancestral characteristics data, and for 18 African countries, to the Afrobarometer survey data. Using historical and contemporary data, I do not find evidence for either hypothesis. Despite the null results, I explore how related hypotheses and studies can build on the comprehensive mancala database."
https://openalex.org/W3093198034,"The effectiveness of a simulated microgravity environment as a novel method for preserving the freshness of vegetables was investigated. Three types of vegetables were selected: vegetable soybean, mung bean sprouts, and white radish sprouts. These selected vegetables were fixed on a three-dimensional rotary gravity controller, rotated slowly. The selected vegetables were stored at 25°C and 66% of relative humidity for 9, 6, or 5 d while undergoing this process. The simulated microgravity was controlled utilizing a gravity controller around 0 m s−2. The mung bean sprouts stored for 6 d under simulated microgravity conditions maintained higher thickness levels than the vegetable samples stored under normal gravity conditions (9.8 m s−2) for the same duration. The mass of all three items decreased with time without regard to the gravity environment, though the samples stored within the simulated microgravity environment displayed significant mass retention on and after 3 d for mung bean sprout samples and 1 d for white radish sprout samples. In contrast, the mass retention effect was not observed in the vegetable soybean samples. Hence, it was confirmed that the mass retention effect of microgravity was limited to sprout vegetables. As a result of analysis harnessing a mathematical model, assuming that the majority of the mass loss is due to moisture loss, a significant difference in mass reduction coefficient occurs among mung bean sprouts and white radish sprouts due to the microgravity environment, and the mass retention effect of simulated microgravity is quantitatively evaluated utilizing mathematical models. Simulated microgravity, which varies significantly from conventional refrigeration, ethylene control, and modified atmosphere, was demonstrated effective as a novel method for preserving and maintaining the freshness of sprout vegetables. This founding will support long-term space flight missions by prolonging shelf life of sprout vegetables."
https://openalex.org/W3093414545,"How much can we rely on whether what was reported in a study was actually done? Systematic and independent examination of records, documents and processes through audits are a central element of quality management systems. In the context of current concerns about the robustness and reproducibility of experimental biomedical research audits have been suggested as a remedy a number of times. However, audits are resource intense and time consuming, and due to their very nature may be perceived as inquisition. Consequently, there is very little experience or literature on auditing and assessments in the complex preclinical biomedical research environment. To gain some insight into which audit approaches might best suit biomedical research in academia, in this study we have applied a number of them in a typical academic neuroscience environment consisting of twelve research groups with about 100 researchers, students and technicians, utilizing the full gamut of state-of-the-art methodology. Several types of assessments and internal as well as external audits (including the novel format of a peer audit) were systematically explored by a team of quality management specialists. An experimental design template was developed (and is provided here) that takes into account and mitigates difficulties, risks and systematic errors that may occur during the course of a study. All audits were performed according to a pre-defined workflow developed by us. Outcomes were assessed qualitatively. We asked for feedback from participating employees in every final discussion of an audit and documented this in the audit reports. Based on these reports follow-up audits were improved. We conclude that several realistic options for auditing exist which have the potential to improve preclinical biomedical research in academia, and have listed specific recommendations regarding their benefits and provided practical resources for their implementation (e.g. study design and audit templates, audit workflow)."
https://openalex.org/W3093189145,"Adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors are characterised by low immunogenicity, although humoral and cellular responses may be triggered upon infection. Following systemic administration high levels of vector particles accumulate within the liver. Kupffer cells (KCs) are liver resident macrophages and an important part of the liver innate immune system. Decreased functional activity of KCs can contribute to exaggerated inflammatory response upon antigen exposure. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) deficiency is associated with considerably reduced numbers of KCs. In this study we aimed to investigate the inflammatory responses in liver and to characterise two populations of hepatic macrophages in adult wild type (WT) and HO-1 knockout (KO) mice following systemic administration of one or two doses (separated by 3 months) of self-complementary (sc)AAV9 vectors. At steady state, the livers of HO-1 KO mice contained significantly higher numbers of monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs), but significantly less KCs than their WT littermates. Three days after re-administration of scAAV9 we observed increased mRNA level of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (Mcp-1) in the livers of both WT and HO-1 KO mice, but the protein level and the macrophage infiltration were not affected. Three days after the 1st and 3 days after the 2nd vector dose the numbers of AAV genomes in the liver were comparable between both genotypes indicating similar transduction efficiency, but the percentage of transgene-expressing MDMs and KCs was higher in WT than in HO-1 KO mice. In the primary culture, KCs were able to internalize AAV9 particles without induction of TLR9-mediated immune responses, but no transgene expression was observed. In conclusion, in vivo and in vitro cultured KCs have different susceptibility to scAAV9 vectors. Regardless of the presence or absence of HO-1 and initial numbers of KCs in the liver, scAAV9 exhibits a low potential to stimulate inflammatory response at the analysed time points."
