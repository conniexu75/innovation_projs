https://openalex.org/W2058912578,"Single-molecule atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to investigate the mechanical properties of titin, the giant sarcomeric protein of striated muscle. Individual titin molecules were repeatedly stretched, and the applied force was recorded as a function of the elongation. At large extensions, the restoring force exhibited a sawtoothlike pattern, with a periodicity that varied between 25 and 28 nanometers. Measurements of recombinant titin immunoglobulin segments of two different lengths exhibited the same pattern and allowed attribution of the discontinuities to the unfolding of individual immunoglobulin domains. The forces required to unfold individual domains ranged from 150 to 300 piconewtons and depended on the pulling speed. Upon relaxation, refolding of immunoglobulin domains was observed."

https://openalex.org/W2172039086,"Titin, a giant filamentous polypeptide, is believed to play a fundamental role in maintaining sarcomeric structural integrity and developing what is known as passive force in muscle. Measurements of the force required to stretch a single molecule revealed that titin behaves as a highly nonlinear entropic spring. The molecule unfolds in a high-force transition beginning at 20 to 30 piconewtons and refolds in a low-force transition at ∼2.5 piconewtons. A fraction of the molecule (5 to 40 percent) remains permanently unfolded, behaving as a wormlike chain with a persistence length (a measure of the chain’s bending rigidity) of 20 angstroms. Force hysteresis arises from a difference between the unfolding and refolding kinetics of the molecule relative to the stretch and release rates in the experiments, respectively. Scaling the molecular data up to sarcomeric dimensions reproduced many features of the passive force versus extension curve of muscle fibers."

To determine whether this pathway of protein turnover was also linked to apoptosis, we treated Rat-1 and PC12 cells with specific proteasome inhibitors. The peptide aldehydes PSI and MG115, which specifically inhibit the chymotrypsin-like activity of the proteasome, induced apoptosis of both cell types. In contrast, apoptosis was not induced by inhibitors of lysosomal proteases or by an alcohol analog of PSI. The tumor suppressor p53 rapidly accumulated in cells treated with proteasome inhibitors, as did the p53-inducible gene products p21 and Mdm-2. In addition, apoptosis induced by proteasome inhibitors was inhibited by expression of dominant-negative p53, whereas overexpression of wild-type p53 was sufficient to induce apoptosis of Rat-1 cells in transient transfection assays. Although other molecules may also be involved, these results suggest that stabilization and accumulation of p53 plays a key role in apoptosis induced by proteasome inhibitors.

Many types of mammalian cells undergo apoptosis during normal development or in response to a variety of stimuli, including DNA damage, growth factor deprivation, and abnormal expression of oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes (1Raff M.C.

Apoptosis induced by these various agents appears to be mediated by a common set of downstream elements that act as regulators and effectors of apoptotic cell death. In many cases, apoptosis requires the p53 tumor suppressor protein (4Fisher D.E. Cell. 1994; 78: 539-542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1364) Google Scholar). Overexpression of p53 is not only induced by several cell death stimuli but is itself sufficient to induce apoptosis in gene transfer assays (5Yonish-Rouach E. Resnitzky D. Lotem J. Sachs L. Kimchi A. Oren M. Nature. 1991; 352: 345-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (1984) Google Scholar). Apoptosis is also regulated by members of the Bcl-2 family (2Thompson C.B.

Cell. 1995; 82: 349-352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1256) Google Scholar). Members of the ICE family, which are activated by proteolytic cleavage of proenzymes, appear to act as common executioners of apoptosis induced by a variety of cell death stimuli. The ubiquitin/proteasome pathway is a major pathway of proteolysis in eukaryotic cells and may contribute to controlling the intracellular levels of a variety of short-lived proteins (8Hochstrasser M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar, 9Ciechanover A. Cell. 1994; 79: 13-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1580) Google Scholar, 10Jentsch S. Schlenker S. Cell. 1995; 82: 881-884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The proteasome is a large multicatalytic complex that catalyzes the degradation of ubiquitinated cellular proteins. Substrates of the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway include a number of cell regulatory molecules, such as cyclins, the Myc oncogene protein, and p53, and the regulated degradation of these molecules has been linked to the control of cell proliferation and cell cycle progression (8Hochstrasser M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar, 9Ciechanover A. Cell. 1994; 79: 13-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1580) Google Scholar, 10Jentsch S. Schlenker S. Cell. 1995; 82: 881-884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). By controlling the intracellular levels of such proteins, the activity of the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway might also be linked to apoptosis. In the present study, we have tested this possibility and demonstrate that inhibition of the chymotrypsin-related activity of the proteasome induces apoptosis of proliferating Rat-1 cells and of PC12 cells. This induction of apoptosis is associated with increased intracellular levels of p53 and is blocked by dominant negative p53 mutants, suggesting that it results from inhibition of p53 degradation. Rat-1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum. PC12 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 5% horse serum. Cells overexpressing Bcl-2 and CrmA were kindly provided by J. Yuan (Massachusetts General Hospital). Cells overexpressing dominant-negative p53 were obtained by transfection with plasmids expressing the p53 mutant Val143→ Ala from a cytomegalovirus promoter (11Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Thiagalingam S. Seymour A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 1992; 256: 827-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). N-Benzyloxycarbonyl-Ile-Glu(O-t-butyl)-Ala-leucinal (PSI) and carbobenzoxyl-leucinyl-leucinyl-norvalinal-II (MG115) were purchased from the Peptide Institute Inc. and diluted in Me2SO. The alcohol analog of PSI,N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Ile-Glu(O-t-butyl)-Ala-leucinol, was kindly supplied by S. Wilk (Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY). Calpain inhibitor II was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. The peptidyl aldehydes were added to cultures, whereas control plates were treated with the diluent. Treated cells were collected by centrifugation, and cytoplasmic DNA was isolated, electrophoresed in 1.8% agarose gels, and visualized by ethidium bromide staining (12Yao R. Cooper G.M. Science. 1995; 267: 2003-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). Cytological characterization of apoptotic cells was performed by staining with propidium iodide and TUNEL assay (Boehringer Mannheim). Cell lysates (20 μg) were electrophoresed in SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Primary monoclonal antibodies against p53, p21, and Mdm2 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. The secondary antibody was horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and proteins were detected using the ECL system (Amersham Corp.). Rat-1 cells growing on coverslips were transfected with 5 μg of human wild-type or Val143 → Ala mutant p53 plasmids (11Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Thiagalingam S. Seymour A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 1992; 256: 827-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar) using the liptofectamine method. 40 h after transfection, cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 10 min and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 5 min. Blocking and incubation with antibodies were carried out in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 5% goat serum. Anti-p53 DO-1 primary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody (Sigma) were applied for 1 h in 1:1000 and 1:500 dilutions, respectively. Cells were simultaneously stained with propidium iodide and then examined with a fluorescence microscope. The proteasome contains three distinct proteolytic activities: a chymotrypsin-related activity, a trypsin-related activity, and a peptidylglutamyl-peptide hydrolyzing activity (13Wilk S. Orlowski M. J. Neurochem. 1983; 40: 842-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The chymotrypsin-related activity is specifically inhibited by the peptide aldehydes PSI and MG115 (14Figueiredo-Pereira M.E. Berg K.A. Wilk S. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 1578-1581Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), so we initially tested the possibility that these inhibitors would induce apoptosis. Actively proliferating Rat-1 fibroblasts and PC12 pheochromocytoma cells were treated with PSI and MG115 at concentrations selected based on the IC50described for inhibition of proteasome degradation of IκB-α and processing of major histocompatability complex class I molecules (15Traenckner E.B.-M. Wilk S. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5433-5441Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar, 16Palombella V.J. Rando O.J. Goldberg A.L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 78: 773-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1908) Google Scholar, 17Traenckner E.B.-M. Pahl H.L. Henkel T. Schmidt K.N. Wilk S. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2876-2883Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar, 18Rock K.L. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A. Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2172) Google Scholar). After 4 h of treatment, apoptosis was assayed by DNA fragmentation (Fig. 1). Both Rat-1 and PC12 cells underwent apoptosis following treatment with PSI at concentrations of 15 or 25 μm (Fig.1 A). Apoptosis was similarly induced by treatment of Rat-1 cells with 30 μm MG115 (Fig. 1 B, lane 4). These data were confirmed by the TUNEL assay, which provides an in situ assay for DNA fragmentation. In a typical experiment, 10–15% of cells were TUNEL positive following 5 h of treatment with PSI compared with 1–2% of untreated control cells (data not shown). In contrast to the activity of PSI and MG115, apoptosis was not induced by treatment with NH4Cl, which nonspecifically inhibits lysosomal proteolysis, or with a specific inhibitor of calpain II (Fig.1 B, lanes 5 and 6). Thus, inhibition of lysosomal proteases did not lead to apoptosis. As a further specificity control, cells were treated with an alcohol analog of PSI, which only weakly inhibits proteasome function (14Figueiredo-Pereira M.E. Berg K.A. Wilk S. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 1578-1581Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The alcohol analog failed to induce apoptosis of Rat-1 cells (Fig. 1, B,lane 3, and C, lane 2), indicating that apoptosis induced by PSI and MG115 resulted from specific inhibition of the proteasome. Apoptosis induced by a variety of agents can be inhibited by overexpression of Bcl-2 or by inhibition of ICE family proteases. We therefore tested the effects of Bcl-2 and CrmA, a cowpox virus-encoded ICE inhibitor, on apoptosis induced by proteasome inhibitors. Transfected Rat-1 cells overexpressing either Bcl-2 or CrmA were resistant to treatment with PSI and MG115 (Fig. 1 C), indicating that apoptosis induced by these proteasome inhibitors was regulated by Bcl-2 and mediated by ICE family proteases. Induction of apoptosis by proteasome inhibitors contrasted with recent results, indicating that inhibition of the proteasome prevents apoptosis of thymocytes and sympathetic neurons (24Grimm L.M. Goldberg A.L. Poirier G.G. Schwartz M. Osborne B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3835-3844Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 25Sadoul R. Fernandez P.-A. Quiquerez A.-L. Martinou I. Maki M. Schroter M. Becherer J.D. Irmler M. Tschopp J. Martinou J.-C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3845-3852Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). It appeared possible that this difference was due to the fact that the cells used in the present study were actively proliferating, in contrast to terminally differentiated thymocytes and neurons. We therefore tested the effects of proteasome inhibitors on nonproliferating Rat-1 cells, which had been rendered quiescent by serum deprivation, and on PC12 cells, which had been induced to differentiate by treatment with nerve growth factor. Treatment with MG115 failed to induce apoptosis of quiescent Rat-1 cells but was still able to induce apoptosis of nonproliferating differentiated PC12 cells (Fig. 1 D). Thus, cell proliferation was not the sole determinant of cellular sensitivity to proteasome inhibitors. p53 is required for apoptosis in a number of models and stabilization of p53 leads cells to undergo apoptosis (4Fisher D.E. Cell. 1994; 78: 539-542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1364) Google Scholar, 5Yonish-Rouach E. Resnitzky D. Lotem J. Sachs L. Kimchi A. Oren M. Nature. 1991; 352: 345-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (1984) Google Scholar). Degradation of p53 occurs through the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway (19Scheffner M. Werness B.A. Huibregtse J.M. Levine A.J. Howley P.M. Cell. 1990; 63: 1129-1136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3410) Google Scholar, 20Maki C.G. Huibregtse J.M. Howley P.M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2649-2654PubMed Google Scholar). If this involved the chymotrypsin-related function of the proteasome, PSI and MG115 might induce apoptosis by inhibiting p53 degradation. We therefore tested the levels of p53 in Rat-1 and PC12 cells following treatment with proteasome inhibitors (Fig. 2). In both cell types, PSI and MG115 lead to the accumulation of p53, which could be detected as early as 2 h after initiation of treatment (Fig.2 A, lane 2). In contrast, treatment with the lysosomal protease inhibitor calpain II did not result in p53 accumulation (Fig. 2 A, lanes 6 and 7), nor did treatment with the alcohol analog of PSI (Fig. 2 B,lanes 2, 3, 7, and 8). Most of the p53 accumulated following treatment with the proteasome inhibitors migrated at its normal electrophoretic mobility, corresponding to 53 kDa, and therefore appeared to be nonubiquitinated. However, higher molecular mass bands that reacted with anti-p53 monoclonal antibody were also observed after treatment with proteasome inhibitors (for example, Fig. 2 A, lanes 2–4,8, and 9). These bands might correspond to accumulation of ubiquinated p53 complexes. p53 is a transcriptional activator that stimulates expression of several genes, including the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 and the p53 negative regulator Mdm2 (21Levine A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 623-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). To determine whether the p53 accumulated in response to treatment with proteasome inhibitors was functional, we assayed expression of these genes in cells treated with MG115. Treatment with MG115-induced expression of both p21 (Fig. 3 A) and Mdm-2 (Fig.3 B). Inhibition of the chymotrypsin-related function of the proteasome thus led not only to stabilization of p53 but also to transactivation of at least two p53 target genes. To determine whether p53 was functionally required for apoptosis induced by proteasome inhibitors, we transfected Rat-1 and PC12 cells with a plasmid expressing a dominant-negative p53 mutant (Val143 → Ala), which is defective in DNA binding and transactivation (11Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Thiagalingam S. Seymour A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 1992; 256: 827-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). Transfected cell lines were screened by immunoblotting to identify cells that expressed high levels of the mutant p53 (data not shown). These cells were then tested for apoptosis following treatment with MG115. Both PC12 and Rat-1 subclones expressing the mutant p53 (143.32 and 143.3 cells, respectively) were resistant to induction of apoptosis (Fig. 4), indicating that p53 is required for apoptosis induced by inhibition of proteasome function. To determine whether accumulation of p53 was sufficient to induce apoptosis, Rat-1 cells were transiently transfected with wild-type or mutant human p53 expression plasmids. Cells expressing human p53 were identified by immunofluorescence and nuclear morphology was assessed by staining with propidium iodide. Transfected cells expressing wild-type p53, but not the Val143 → Ala mutant, displayed the fragmented nuclei typical of apoptotic cells (Fig. 5). Overexpression of wild-type p53 is thus sufficient to induce apoptosis of proliferating Rat-1 cells, consistent with the involvement of p53 accumulation in apoptosis induced by proteasome inhibitors. The results of the present study demonstrate that treatment of proliferating Rat-1 cells and of PC12 cells with inhibitors of the chymotrypsin-like function of the proteasome induces apoptosis. A number of previous investigations have demonstrated that the peptidyl aldehydes employed in this study are specific inhibitors of the proteasome chymotrypsin-related activity (14Figueiredo-Pereira M.E. Berg K.A. Wilk S. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 1578-1581Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 15Traenckner E.B.-M. Wilk S. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5433-5441Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar, 16Palombella V.J. Rando O.J. Goldberg A.L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 78: 773-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1908) Google Scholar, 17Traenckner E.B.-M. Pahl H.L. Henkel T. Schmidt K.N. Wilk S. Baeuerle P.A.

Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2172) Google Scholar). In contrast, neither inhibitors of lysosomal proteases nor a peptide alcohol analog that is ineffective as a proteasome inhibitor was able to induce apoptosis. It thus appears that inhibition of this function of the proteasome specifically induces apoptosis, linking the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway of protein degradation to regulation of apoptotic cell death. Induction of apoptosis by proteasome inhibitors implies that cell death is induced as a result of increased intracellular concentrations of a regulatory molecule(s) normally degraded by the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway. A prime candidate for such a regulator of apoptosis appeared to be p53, which is known to be ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome (19Scheffner M. Werness B.A. Huibregtse J.M. Levine A.J. Howley P.M. Cell. 1990; 63: 1129-1136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3410) Google Scholar, 20Maki C.G. Huibregtse J.M. Howley P.M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2649-2654PubMed Google Scholar). Not only is p53 induced by a variety of apoptotic stimuli, but overexpression of p53 has been demonstrate to induce apoptosis in a variety of cell types (4Fisher D.E. Cell. 1994; 78: 539-542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1364) Google Scholar, 5Yonish-Rouach E. Resnitzky D. Lotem J. Sachs L. Kimchi A. Oren M. Nature. 1991; 352: 345-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (1984) Google Scholar). Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that treatment with proteasome inhibitors resulted in stabilization and rapid accumulation of p53 in both Rat-1 and PC12 cells. Moreover, the accumulated p53 was shown to be biologically active, based on transactivation of the p53 target genes encoding p21 and Mdm2. Finally, we have shown that apoptosis induced by proteasome inhibitors is blocked by expression of dominant-negative p53, and that overexpression of wild-type p53 is sufficient to induce apoptosis of Rat-1 cells in transient transfection assays. Although other molecules may also be involved in cell death, these data suggest that modulation of p53 turnover is a key event in apoptosis induced by proteasome inhibitors. Our finding that apoptosis is induced by inhibitors of the chymotrypsin-like activity of the proteasome is consistent with a previous report showing that lactacystin, which inhibits all three proteasome activities (22Fenteany G. Standaert R.F. Lane W.S. Choi S. Corey E.J. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1995; 268: 726-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1492) Google Scholar), induces apoptosis of U937 myeloid leukemia cells (23Imajohomi S. Kawaguchi T. Sugiyama S. Tanaka K. Omura S. Kikuchi H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 217: 1070-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). On the other hand, it has recently been reported that inhibition of the proteasome by either lactacystin or peptide aldehydes prevents apoptosis of thymocytes induced by radiation, glucocorticoids, or phorbol esters and of sympathetic neurons induced by nerve growth factor deprivation (24Grimm L.M. Goldberg A.L. Poirier G.G. Schwartz M. Osborne B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3835-3844Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 25Sadoul R. Fernandez P.-A. Quiquerez A.-L. Martinou I. Maki M. Schroter M. Becherer J.D. Irmler M. Tschopp J. Martinou J.-C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3845-3852Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). In these systems, proteasome activity appears to be required for induction of apoptosis upstream of the ICE family proteases. It appeared possible that this apparent discrepancy was due to the fact that U937 cells and the cells used in the present study were actively proliferating, in contrast to the nonproliferating thymocytes and sympathetic neurons in which proteasome activity was required for induction of apoptosis by other agents. Indeed, Grimmet al. (24Grimm L.M. Goldberg A.L. Poirier G.G. Schwartz M. Osborne B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3835-3844Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) noted that prolonged exposure to proteasome inhibitors actually increased cell death in thymocytes that were not treated with other inducers of apoptosis. Consistent with this possibility, we found that nonproliferating Rat-1 cells were no longer susceptible to apoptosis induced by proteasome inhibitors. However, inhibition of the proteasome still induced apoptosis of nonproliferating PC12 cells that had been induced to differentiate by treatment with nerve growth factor. These results indicate that cell proliferation is one but not the only determinant of cellular response to inhibition of the proteasome. It thus appears that the proteasome can function to promote either cell survival or cell death, depending on both proliferative state and other factors that may be cell type-specific."

https://openalex.org/W1991469669,"In many organisms, pattern formation in the embryo develops from the polarized distributions of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) in the egg. In Xenopus , the mRNA encoding Vg1, a growth factor involved in mesoderm induction, is localized to the vegetal cortex of oocytes. A protein named Vera was shown to be involved in Vg1 mRNA localization. Vera cofractionates with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes, and endogenous Vg1 mRNA is associated with a subcompartment of the ER. Vera may promote mRNA localization in Xenopus oocytes by mediating an interaction between the Vg1 3′ untranslated region and the ER subcompartment."

https://openalex.org/W2002412788,"The human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum exports an interconnected network of tubovesicular membranes (the TVM) that extends from the parasite’s vacuolar membrane to the periphery of the red cell. Here it is shown that extracellular solutes such as Lucifer yellow enter the TVM and are delivered to the parasite. Blocking the assembly of the network blocked the delivery of exogenous Lucifer yellow, nucleosides, and amino acids to the parasite without inhibiting secretion of plasmodial proteins. These data suggest that the TVM is a transport network that allows nutrients efficient access to the parasite and could be used to deliver antimalarial drugs directly into the parasite."
https://openalex.org/W2122701269,"Alanine scanning mutagenesis has been used to identify specific side chains of insulin which strongly influence binding to the insulin receptor. A total of 21 new insulin analog constructs were made, and in addition 7 high pressure liquid chromatography-purified analogs were tested, covering alanine substitutions in positions B1, B2, B3, B4, B8, B9, B10, B11, B12, B13, B16, B17, B18, B20, B21, B22, B26, A4, A8, A9, A12, A13, A14, A15, A16, A17, A19, and A21. Binding data on the analogs revealed that the alanine mutations that were most disruptive for binding were at positions TyrA19, GlyB8, LeuB11, and GluB13, resulting in decreases in affinity of 1,000-, 33-, 14-, and 8-fold, respectively, relative to wild-type insulin. In contrast, alanine substitutions at positions GlyB20, ArgB22, and SerA9 resulted in an increase in affinity for the insulin receptor. The most striking finding is that B20Ala insulin retains high affinity binding to the receptor. GlyB20 is conserved in insulins from different species, and in the structure of the B-chain it appears to be essential for the shift from the α-helix B8–B19 to the β-turn B20–B22. Thus, replacing GlyB20 with alanine most likely modifies the structure of the B-chain in this region, but this structural change appears to enhance binding to the insulin receptor. Alanine scanning mutagenesis has been used to identify specific side chains of insulin which strongly influence binding to the insulin receptor. A total of 21 new insulin analog constructs were made, and in addition 7 high pressure liquid chromatography-purified analogs were tested, covering alanine substitutions in positions B1, B2, B3, B4, B8, B9, B10, B11, B12, B13, B16, B17, B18, B20, B21, B22, B26, A4, A8, A9, A12, A13, A14, A15, A16, A17, A19, and A21. Binding data on the analogs revealed that the alanine mutations that were most disruptive for binding were at positions TyrA19, GlyB8, LeuB11, and GluB13, resulting in decreases in affinity of 1,000-, 33-, 14-, and 8-fold, respectively, relative to wild-type insulin. In contrast, alanine substitutions at positions GlyB20, ArgB22, and SerA9 resulted in an increase in affinity for the insulin receptor. The most striking finding is that B20Ala insulin retains high affinity binding to the receptor. GlyB20 is conserved in insulins from different species, and in the structure of the B-chain it appears to be essential for the shift from the α-helix B8–B19 to the β-turn B20–B22. Thus, replacing GlyB20 with alanine most likely modifies the structure of the B-chain in this region, but this structural change appears to enhance binding to the insulin receptor. Insulin mediates its effects by binding to the insulin receptor in the plasma membrane of target cells. The molecular mechanisms for insulin interaction with the receptor are not fully understood. The crystal structure of the insulin molecule has been known for more than 25 years (1Adams M.J. Blundell T.L. Dodson E.J. Dodson G.G. Vijayan M. Baker E.N. Harding M.M. Hodgkin D.C. Rimmer R. Sheet S. Nature. 1969; 224: 491-496Crossref Scopus (423) Google Scholar), but it remains an open question whether the structure of insulin that binds to the receptor is similar to the crystal structure. Until the structure of bound insulin and the side chains that are actually involved in binding is identified by co-crystallization of the receptor and ligand, more information about the binding domain on insulin can be obtained using mutational approaches. The binding domain of the insulin molecule has been studied by investigating receptor binding of a number of insulins from different animal species as well as chemically modified and more recently genetically engineered insulins (2Baker E.N. Blundell T.L. Cutfield J.F. Cutfield S.M. Dodson E.J. Hodkin D.M.C. Hubbard R.E. Isaacs N.W. Reynolds C.D. Sakabe K. Sakabe N. Vijayan N.M. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond-Biol.

These studies have provided experimental support for a model in which invariant residues from both A and B chains form a surface that binds to the insulin receptor. The putative binding domain comprises a number of residues overlapping the dimer-forming surface (ValB12, TyrB16, GlyB23, PheB24, PheB25, TyrB26, GlyA1, GlnA5, TyrA19, and AsnA21) and some of the residues buried beneath the COOH terminus of the B-chain (IleA2, ValA3, GluA4) (2Baker E.N. Blundell T.L. Cutfield J.F. Cutfield S.M. Dodson E.J. Hodkin D.M.C. Hubbard R.E. Isaacs N.W. Reynolds C.D. Sakabe K. Sakabe N. Vijayan N.M. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond-Biol. Sci. 1988; 319: 369-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). Cross-linking studies with an azidophenylalanine-substituted analog have shown that one of these residues, PheB25, comes into close proximity to the insulin receptor upon binding (5Kurose T. Pashmforoush M. Yoshimasa Y. Carroll R. Schwartz G.P. Burke G.T. Katsoyannis P.G. Steiner D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29190-29197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, a second binding site has been proposed, involving residues LeuA13 and LeuB17 (6Schäffer L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 1127-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 7De Meyts P. Diabetologia. 1994; 37: S135-S148Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). A biphasic binding reaction involving this second binding site could explain the negative cooperativity phenomenon (8De Meyts P. Roth J. Neville D.M.J. Gavin J.R.I. Lesniak M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1973; 55: 154-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar) as well as discrepancies between receptor binding data and metabolic potencies found in hystricomorph insulins and synthetic analogs with mutations at these positions (9Horuk R. Goodwin P. O'Connor K. Neville R.W.J. Lazarus N.R. Stone D. Nature. 1979; 279: 439-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 10Bajaj M. Blundell T.L. Horuk R. Pitts J.E. Wood S.P. Gowan L.K.

Although a large number of insulin analogs have been studied to date, no comprehensive analysis of the insulin side chains involved in receptor binding has been reported. We have applied alanine scanning mutagenesis to elucidate further the role of individual amino acid residues in receptor binding. A total of 21 new insulin constructs with alanine substitutions were expressed as single chain insulin precursors in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Yeast culture medium was treated with Achromobacter lyticus protease to yield mature insulin and then used directly in the binding assay. The receptor used for the binding assay is an IR 1The abbreviations used are: IR, insulin receptor; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. 1The abbreviations used are: IR, insulin receptor; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography.-IgG fusion protein immobilized in microtiter plates coated with protein A. The binding affinity of 19 new analogs and 7 HPLC-purified alanine analogs was measured. Compiling these data with data in the literature on alanine analogs allows an extensive overview covering the effect of single alanine substitutions at a total of 38 positions of the insulin molecule. We conclude that insulin residue TyrA19 is essential for binding to receptor, whereas single alanine mutations in the B20–B22 turn actually appear to enhance affinity for insulin receptor. Insulin, A14-125I-insulin, andA. lyticus protease were from Novo Nordisk. DNA restriction enzymes and T4 ligase were from New England Biolabs. Taqpolymerase was from Perkin-Elmer. Staphylococcus aureusprotein A, Sepharose FF for immobilizing A. lyticusprotease, and the SP-Sepharose BigBeads were from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Single alanine mutations were inserted in the sequence encoding insulin precursor by polymerase chain reaction or overlap polymerase chain reaction using appropriate oligonucleotides (11Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene ( Amst. ). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6771) Google Scholar). The polymerase chain reaction fragment was purified and subcloned into the yeast expression vector cPOT using standard procedures (12Sambrook, J., Fritsch, E. F., Maniatis, T., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd ed., 1989, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY.Google Scholar). The yeast expression system used has been described in detail previously (13Kjeldsen T. Brandt J. Andersen A.S. Egel-Mitani M. Hach M. Petterson A.F. Vad K. Gene ( Amst. ). 1996; 170: 107-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Briefly, the insulin precursor was coupled to a 41-amino acid synthetic prepropeptide sequence in the configuration: prepropeptide-KR-extension-insulin precursor, where KR is the potential Kex2 protease processing site, the extension is the removable spacer peptide E(EA)3EPK, and the insulin precursor is either miniproinsulin B(1–29)-A(1–21) or B(1–29)-AAK-A(1–21) (14Markussen J. Damgaard U. Diers I. Fiil N. Hansen M.T. Larsen P. Norris F. Norris K. Schou O. Snel L. Thim L. Voigt H.O. Theodoropoulos D. Peptides 1986.

Biol. 1991; 220: 425-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Thus the precursors are single chain proinsulin-like peptides that either lack the C-peptide or have the short synthetic C-peptide AAK. The insulin precursor constructs were expressed in S. cerevisiae strain MT663 (16Thim L. Hansen M.T. Norris K. Hoegh I. Boel E. Forstrom J. Ammerer G. Fiil N.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6766-6770Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Yeast cells were transformed and selected on YP plates with 2% glucose according to standard methods (17Sherman, F., Fink, G. R., Lawrence, C. W., Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Manual, 1979, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY.Google Scholar). Yeast cultures were grown in YP medium with 2% glucose for 72 h at 30 °C, and the yield of insulin precursor in the fermentation supernatants was quantified by HPLC with human insulin as external standard (18Kristensen C. Andersen A.S. Hach M. Wiberg F.C. Schäffer L. Kjeldsen T. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 981-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The single chain insulin precursors were converted to des-B30-insulin using the lysine-specific A. lyticus endoprotease that removes the extension and the C-peptide of the precursor. Cell-free yeast culture medium with precursor was adjusted to pH 9 with 0.1 volume 0.5m glycine, pH 9, and applied to a column with A. lyticus protease immobilized on Sepharose. The column was incubated for 2 h at 37 °C before cleaved precursor was eluted from column into 0.1 volume of 1 m Tris, pH 7.0, and the concentration of des-B30-insulin was quantified by HPLC (18Kristensen C. Andersen A.S. Hach M. Wiberg F.C. Schäffer L. Kjeldsen T. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 981-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). For analogs that were expressed poorly the precursor was partially purified by cation exchange chromatography prior to treatment withA. lyticus protease. Briefly, the cell-free yeast medium was adjusted to pH 3.0 with HCl and then batch treated with cation exchange resin (SP-Sepharose BigBeads) for 16 h at room temperature to adsorb peptides, which were subsequently eluted with 200 mmNaCl, 50 mm glycine, pH 9.0. The HPLC-purified analogs (B2Ala, B8Ala, B17Ala, B18Ala, B26Ala, A8Ala, and A21Ala) were fermented in yeast and purified as described (4Brange J. Ribel U. Hansen J.F. Dodson G. Hansen M.T.

The insulin receptor used is a soluble fusion protein consisting of the insulin receptor (exon 11+) ectodomain fused to the Fc region of the IgG heavy chain (19Bass J. Kurose T. Pashmforoush M. Steiner D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19367-19375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The IR-IgG fusion was stably expressed in baby hamster kidney cells by inserting the 3,532-base pair NotI/XbaI fragment from the pBluescript II-HIRs-Fc vector (19Bass J. Kurose T. Pashmforoush M. Steiner D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19367-19375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) into the ZEM expression vector and transfecting this into baby hamster kidney cells as described previously (20Andersen A.S. Kjeldsen T. Wiberg F.C. Christensen P.M. Rasmussen J.S. Norris K. Møller K.B. Møller N.P.H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7363-7366Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 21Kjeldsen T. Andersen A.S.

For binding experiments the IR-IgG fusion protein was immobilized on protein A-coated microtiter plates. First the wells were coated with protein A by incubating for 1 h with 50 μl of protein A (1 μg/ml) in TBS (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5); then the plates were washed three times with binding buffer (100 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 0.025% (w/v) Triton X-100). The IR-IgG fusion receptor was immobilized by adding 50 μl of a 33-fold dilution of baby hamster kidney supernatant in binding buffer to each well and incubating for 3 h before washing the plates three times with binding buffer. Binding experiments were performed by adding a total volume of 150 μl of binding buffer with A14-125I-insulin (10 pm) and varying dilutions of A. lyticus protease-treated insulin analog. After 16 h at 4 °C unbound ligand was removed by aspirating the buffer and washing once with 200 μl of cold binding buffer, and the radioactivity in each well was counted. The concentration of receptor in the well was adjusted to yield 10–15% binding when no competing ligand was added in the assay. The data from the competitive displacement experiments were fitted to a two-site binding model using a nonlinear regression algorithm in GraphPad Prism 2.01 (GraphPad Software, San Diego). All sets of binding data fitted better to the two-site model than the one-site model. For the alanine scanning mutagenesis we made 21 new insulin analog constructs with alanine substitutions in positions B1, B3, B4, B9, B10, B11, B12, B13, B16, B20, B21, B22, A4, A9, A12, A13, A14, A15, A16, A17, and A19 (Fig.1). We chose these 21 positions because they are located primarily on the surface of the insulin molecule and therefore are more likely to be candidates involved in receptor binding. The insulin precursors were expressed in the yeast S. cerevisiae and fermented in 5-ml cultures. The yield of insulin precursor in the fermentation supernatant was quantified on HPLC. The yield of the alanine analog precursors relative to the wild-type insulin precursor is shown in Fig. 2. Most of the alanine substitutions result in some decrease in yield, probably because the yeast expression system is optimized for expressing the wild-type insulin precursor. Nevertheless, 15 of the analogs gave more than 20% of the yield of the wild-type precursor, indicating that they are processed and folded correctly by the yeast cell. The positions where the alanine substitutions had the most deleterious effects on expression levels were at the hydrophobic residues LeuB11, ValB12, and LeuA16. Mutations in the region GlyB20, GluB21, and ArgB22 also resulted in poor yields, indicating that the precursor is folded less efficiently because of structural changes induced by alanine mutations in this region. Because of the low level of expression the B11Ala, B12Ala, and A16Ala insulin analogs were partially purified using cation exchange chromatography. The B20Ala and B22Ala analog data were obtained from both partially purified and raw medium supernatants. Two of the insulin analogs (B12Ala and A16Ala) never yielded sufficient material for binding experiments. The precursors were converted to des-B30-insulin by treating withA. lyticus protease. HPLC chromatograms for the wild-type insulin precursor before and after A. lyticus protease treatment are shown in Fig. 3. The A. lyticusprotease-treated precursor elutes later from the HPLC column than untreated precursor because of increased hydrophobicity, and this allowed precise quantification of the converted precursor. For the binding assay an IR-IgG fusion protein was immobilized in microtiter plates using protein A. This binding assay allows efficient analyses of the high number of analogs, and in addition this assay has lower background than precipitation assays. The binding data obtained when displacing A14-125I-insulin from the IR-IgG receptor with insulin standard (Fig. 4 A) fits to a two-site binding model and yields binding affinities (ED50) of 0.012 and 1.4 nm for the two predicted sites. However, the 0.012 nm value for the high affinity site is not reliable because it is similar to the concentration of tracer added (10 pm), and therefore all binding data presented reflect binding to the low affinity site, that is, affinities in the range of 0.3–200 nm. The binding affinity of each analog is based on at least three independent sets of binding curves. Binding of the wild-type insulin precursor expressed in the yeast cells before and after treatment with A. lyticus protease is included in Fig. 4 A. The affinity of the wild-type precursor after A. lyticus protease treatment (des-B30-insulin) is similar to the affinity of insulin (ED50 0.016 and 1.5 nm), whereas the curve for the uncleaved insulin precursor is shifted far to the right (Fig. 4 A), demonstrating a very poor affinity of the uncleaved precursor for the insulin receptor. This is consistent with previous reports on the biological activity of the miniproinsulin B(1–29)-A(1–21) (15Derewenda U. Derewenda Z. Dodson E.J. Dodson G.G. Bing X. Markussen J. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 425-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The assay was further verified when measuring affinities of the HPLC-purified analogs. Five of these have been investigated previously, and the relative affinities obtained for the IR-IgG and the full-length insulin receptor are similar 2L. Schäffer, unpublished data. (Table I). These controls demonstrate that the in vitro IR-IgG binding assay performed directly on A. lyticus protease-treated yeast culture supernatants reproduces previous assays using the full-length receptor.Table IAlanine scanning receptor binding dataA-chainB-chainPositionAffinity experimentally determinedAffinity reported in literaturePositionAffinity experimentally determinedAffinity reported in literature% of insulin%of insulin% of insulin%of insulinA1G12 (22Cosmatos A.

In all of the binding experiments performed the purified insulin and the wild-type precursor were included as standards, and all data are expressed as the ED50 of analog relative to the ED50 of the wild-type insulin precursor. Three analogs tested showed a marked decrease in affinity for the receptor, supporting a role for these residues in receptor binding. The most pronounced decrease occurred with TyrA19 → Ala. We could not obtain a full binding curve due to the poor affinity; the curve for the A19Ala analog is shifted about three decades to the right compared with the wild-type insulin curve (Fig. 4 B), implying a 1,000-fold decreased affinity for the insulin receptor. Other disruptive alanine substitutions were found at LeuB11 and GluB13, resulting in a drop to 7 and 12%, respectively, in affinity for the receptor (Fig.4 B). One of the HPLC-purified analogs, B8Ala insulin, also disrupted binding, with an approximate decrease of 30-fold in affinity for the receptor. Although residues LeuA13 and LeuB17 have been suggested to be part of a second binding site in the insulin molecule, alanine substitutions at these positions had only modest effect on the binding affinity (2–3-fold) (Table I). In contrast to the disruptive mutations there were a number of alanine substitutions that did not alter affinity for the receptor, and at least three of the alanine analogs even showed an increase in receptor affinity. Alanine substitution for residues GlyB20, ArgB22, and SerA9 consistently resulted in a 2–4-fold increase in affinity for the insulin receptor (Table I). The binding data are summarized in Table I and Fig. 5. When including data on alanine analogs reported in the literature (1Adams M.J. Blundell T.L. Dodson E.J. Dodson G.G. Vijayan M. Baker E.N.

By implementing a new high volume screening assay for insulin analogs we have used the alanine scanning mutagenesis approach to identify amino acid side chains of insulin which strongly influence binding to the insulin receptor. A total of 21 single alanine mutants of insulin were expressed in yeast and converted to des-B30-insulin using A. lyticus endoprotease. The binding constants of the analogs for the IR-IgG fusion receptor were determined in a microtiter plate assay based on immobilization of receptor using protein A. This receptor retains high affinity for insulin (19Bass J. Kurose T. Pashmforoush M. Steiner D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19367-19375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and immobilization via protein A does not influence binding affinity (data not shown). In the present study the binding affinity of 19 new analogs and 7 HPLC-purified analogs was measured. Compiling these data with analogs described in the literature allows an extensive overview covering the effect of substituting alanine at 38 positions of the insulin molecule (Table I and Fig. 5). Two types of information are obtained in this mutagenesis study. First, mutations that disrupt binding are of interest because they indicate that the residue of insulin either interacts directly with the receptor or, alternatively, that the residue supports a conformation required for receptor binding. Additionally, scanning mutagenesis provides a test to confirm the role of residues thought to be essential for receptor binding. If alanine substituted at these positions does not alter binding, the structure in this particular region does not appear to be important for binding. In addition to binding data, comparison of analog yields in theS. cerevisiae expression system reveals differences in the biosynthesis of the analogs. Most of the alanine-substituted analogs were expressed efficiently; 15 of the analogs gave more than 20% of the yield of the wild-type precursor, indicating that these analogs were folded efficiently by the yeast cell (Fig. 2). The positions where the alanine substitution had the most deleterious effect on expression level were at the hydrophobic residues LeuB11, ValB12, and LeuA16. These amino acids are buried in the hydrophobic core of the insulin molecule and therefore might provide the free energy needed for efficient folding. Poor yields were also observed in analogs with mutations in the loop region B20–B22 (Fig. 2). Binding data on the new analogs revealed that the alanine mutations that were most disruptive for binding were at positions TyrA19, LeuB11, and GluB13, resulting in decrease in affinity to 0.1, 7, and 12%, respectively, relative to wild-type insulin (Table I). The A19Ala analog is well expressed in the yeast expression system (Fig. 2), indicating that the folding is not altered by this mutation, pointing to a direct role of TyrA19 in interaction with the receptor. Three modifications of insulin at position A19 have been described previously (27Kitagawa K. Ogawa H. Thomson Burke G. Chanley J.D. Katsoyannis P.G. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4444-4448Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 28Gammeltoft S. Physiol. Rev. 1984; 64: 1322-1378Crossref Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 29Ferderigos N. Thomson Burke G. Kitagawa K. Katsoyannis P.G. J. Protein Chem. 1983; 2: 147-170Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Replacing TyrA19 with leucine had a dramatic effect on receptor binding, decreasing the affinity 1,000-fold, whereas substitution with phenylalanine only resulted in a 4–5-fold decrease in affinity (27Kitagawa K. Ogawa H. Thomson Burke G. Chanley J.D. Katsoyannis P.G. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4444-4448Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 29Ferderigos N. Thomson Burke G. Kitagawa K. Katsoyannis P.G. J. Protein Chem. 1983; 2: 147-170Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Additionally, iodination at TyrA19 had an intermediate effect on receptor binding (for review, see Ref. 28Gammeltoft S. Physiol. Rev. 1984; 64: 1322-1378Crossref Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Thus the substitution of alanine or leucine at position A19 disrupts receptor binding, whereas iodination or insertion of another aromatic ring at position A19 (Phe) is well tolerated, suggesting that an aromatic ring at position A19 is crucial for insulin binding to its receptor. Including analogs reported in the literature (Table I) the alanine mutations that cause the largest reduction in binding are found at positions LeuB6, GlyB8, GlyB23, PheB24, IleA2, ValA3, and TyrA19. Substitution of alanine at these positions reduced affinity for the receptor by more than 20-fold (Table I). All of these residues are evolutionary conserved in insulins from different species, supporting the conclusion that they are important for structure and/or function. Most of these disruptive alanine mutations are related to the classical binding surface. The residues that are most likely to be directly involved in binding are B23, B24, and A19, which play a role in dimer formation, and A2 and A3, which are hydrophobic residues buried beneath the COOH terminus of the B-chain (Fig. 6). We propose that the residues that are essential for direct interaction with the receptor are found in this patch, but there may also be structural effects that can account for the disruption of binding when replacing these residues with alanine. In particular, interaction between A2 and A19 appears to stabilize the insulin conformation (30Derewenda U. Derewenda Z. Dodson G.G. Hubbard R.E. Cuatrecasas P. Jacobs S. Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1990: 23-39Google Scholar). Mutating one of these residues thus could distort the conformation of insulin that binds to the receptor. On the other hand, the high expression yield of the A19Ala analog argues against major conformational distortions in this molecule. The explanation for the large reduction in receptor affinity in insulin analogs LeuB6Ala and GlyB8Ala is not clear. A glycine residue is not likely to contribute free energy of binding, and in addition GlyB8 is thought to be important for initiating the central α-helix of the B-chain. Therefore, mutating this residue probably has structural consequences. The B6Ala insulin was described by Nakagawa and Tager (25Nakagawa S.H. Tager H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11502-11509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and they also speculated on a structural role for the LeuB6 in insulin. Substituting alanine for other residues of the classical putative binding surface including GluA4, AsnA21, TyrB16, and TyrB26 only altered affinity for the insulin receptor moderately (less than 3-fold) (Table I), indicating that these residues are not part of the functional binding epitope. These data are incorporated in the structural model shown in Fig. 6. The five residues GlyB23, PheB24, IleA2, ValA3, and TyrA19 form a patch in the insulin molecule. Substituting alanine for any of these five amino acids results in more than a 20-fold decrease in receptor affinity, and therefore we propose that this patch is essential for direct interaction with the insulin receptor. In the structure of insulin, part of this proposed binding patch is buried beneath the COOH terminus of the B-chain; if all of these residues interact directly with the receptor partial unfolding of the COOH-terminal B-chain would be required for exposing this patch. Such a mechanism would be in accordance with the hypothesis of Dodson and others that some degree of separation of COOH-terminal B-chain from NH2-terminal A-chain is required for interaction with the insulin receptor (15Derewenda U. Derewenda Z. Dodson E.J. Dodson G.G. Bing X. Markussen J. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 425-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar,31Hua Q.X. Shoelson S.E. Kochoyan M. Weiss M.A. Nature. 1991; 354: 238-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Two recent papers have suggested that in addition to the classical binding site there is a second binding site in the hexamer-forming surface of the insulin molecule (6Schäffer L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 1127-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 7De Meyts P. Diabetologia. 1994; 37: S135-S148Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). This second binding surface includes LeuA13 and LeuB17. In the present study alanine substitutions at these positions did not dramatically decrease affinity for the insulin receptor, the affinities of the A13Ala and B17Ala analogs were 30 and 52%, respectively (Table I). However, as we only look at the low affinity site of the IR-IgG fusion we may miss effects of A13 and B17 mutations. This would be in agreement with Schäffer (6Schäffer L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 1127-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), who reported that a characteristic of analogs mutated in positions A13 or B17 is that they bind with relative higher affinity to the soluble insulin receptor (nanomolar affinity site) than to the high affinity site of the holo-receptor (picomolar affinity) (6Schäffer L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 1127-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Thus it would be expected that mutations in the second binding site would have less impact on binding to the low affinity site on the insulin receptor. Three of the alanine substitutions resulted in a 2–4-fold increase in affinity for the insulin receptor fusion. These were SerA9Ala, ArgB22Ala, and most surprisingly GlyB20Ala (Table I). The expression yield of B20Ala and B22Ala was very low (Fig. 2) indicating that substituting alanine at these positions has structural consequences. GlyB20 is conserved in insulins from different species, but apparently it is not important for binding; thus it would be interesting to investigate the effect of the GlyB20Ala mutation on folding of the wild-type precursor proinsulin. In the structure of the insulin B-chain GlyB20 appears to be essential for the shift from the α-helix B8–B19 to the β-turn B20–B22 (Fig. 6). Analyzing the impact of alanine at position B20 on the secondary structure of an insulin B-chain using the Chou-Fasman algorithm (32Chou P.Y. Fasman G.D. Adv. Enzymol. 1978; 47: 45-148PubMed Google Scholar) suggests that the α-helix B8–B19 will be extended by an additional turn comprising B20Ala, GluB21, and ArgB22. This does not take into account the interaction with the A-chain, but substituting glycine at position B20 with alanine nevertheless is expected to cause conformational changes in this region. What effect this putative structural change could have on the COOH terminus of the B-chain is uncertain. Earlier reports on the natural mutation of PheB24 to serine (insulin Los Angeles) suggested that unfolding of the B-chain is compatible with high affinity receptor binding (31Hua Q.X. Shoelson S.E. Kochoyan M. Weiss M.A. Nature. 1991; 354: 238-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar); it may be that similar effects will be seen when the structure of the B20Ala insulin is solved. In conclusion, the present activity data on series of analogs will in combination with structure elucidation of selected analogs further characterize the functional properties of the insulin molecule.

We have previously shown that secretin stimulates exocytosis in cholangiocytes and that these cells transport water mainly via the water channel aquaporin-1 (AQP1). In this study, we tested the hypothesis that secretin promotes osmotic water movement in cholangiocytes by inducing the exocytic insertion of AQP1 into plasma membranes. Exposure of highly purified isolated rat cholangiocytes to secretin caused significant, dose-dependent increases in osmotic membrane water permeability (P f) (e.g. increased by 60% with 10−7m secretin), which was reversibly inhibited by the water channel blocker HgCl2. Immunoblotting analysis of cholangiocyte membrane fractions showed that secretin caused up to a 3-fold increase in the amount of AQP1 in plasma membranes and a proportional decrease in the amount of the water channel in microsomes, suggesting a secretin-induced redistribution of AQP1 from intracellular to plasma membranes. Both the secretin-induced increase in cholangiocyte P f and AQP1 redistribution were blocked by two perturbations that inhibit secretin-stimulated exocytosis in cholangiocytes, i.e. treatment with colchicine and exposure at low temperatures (20 and 4 °C). Our results demonstrate that secretin increases AQP1-mediatedP f in cholangiocytes. Moreover, our studies implicate the microtubule-dependent vesicular translocation of AQP1 water channels to the plasma membrane, a mechanism that appears to be essential for secretin-induced ductal bile secretion and suggests that AQP1 can be regulated by membrane trafficking.

Moreover, our studies implicate the microtubule-dependent vesicular translocation of AQP1 water channels to the plasma membrane, a mechanism that appears to be essential for secretin-induced ductal bile secretion and suggests that AQP1 can be regulated by membrane trafficking. Bile is formed primarily by hepatocytes and secreted at the bile canaliculus; subsequently, its volume and composition are modified in the lumen of bile ducts as a result of the transport of water and solutes by cholangiocytes (1Marinelli R.A.

Physiol. 1996; 270: G1-G5PubMed Google Scholar). While this ductal bile secretion results from the osmotically driven movement of water, the regulatory and mechanistic aspects are obscure. We recently reported that cholangiocytes (unlike hepatocytes) express the water-selective channel protein aquaporin-1 (AQP1) 1The abbreviations used are: AQP1, aquaporin-1;P f, membrane water permeability. 1The abbreviations used are: AQP1, aquaporin-1;P f, membrane water permeability. and proposed that ductal bile secretion results from the movement of water across this protein (3Roberts S.K.

Based on studies in renal epithelial cells, it is currently thought that AQP1 is constitutively inserted into plasma membranes and is not hormone responsive (5Nielsen S. Smith B.L. Christensen E.I.

Meyers W.C. Gastroenterology. 1992; 102: 963-968Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We and others recently proposed that secretin-induced bile secretion was associated with the microtubule-dependent exocytic insertion of cytoplasmic vesicles into the cholangiocyte plasma membrane (8Buanes T. Grotmol T. Landsverk T. Raeder M.G. Gastroenterology. 1988; 95: 417-424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Veel T. Buanes T. Grotmol T. Engeland E. Raeder M.G. Acta Physiol.

Interestingly, hormone-regulated exocytic movement of transporters has been demonstrated in other cell types (11Bradbury N.A. Bridges R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C1-C24Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, in renal collecting tubule cells the water channel aquaporin-2 moves to and from the apical plasma membrane in the presence and absence of vasopressin, respectively (12Knepper M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6255-6258Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). For these reasons, we hypothesized that secretin stimulates ductal bile secretion by inducing the translocation of functional AQP1 water channels into the plasma membrane of cholangiocytes.DISCUSSIONCurrent concepts concerning hormonal regulation of cell membrane water permeability come primarily from studies of the kidney. In the renal collecting duct, vasopressin binds to its receptor on the basolateral membrane of tubular principal cells; the intracellular levels of cyclic AMP rise; intracellular vesicles containing AQP2 water channels fuse with the apical membrane; and water transport increases (21Nielsen S. Chou C.L. Marples D. Christensen E.I. Kishore B.K. Knepper M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1013-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar, 22Yamamoto T. Sasaki S. Fushimi K. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C1546-C1551Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the homologous water channel AQP1 is thought to be constitutively expressed in plasma membranes of renal cells (i.e. in proximal tubules and the descending limbs of Henle) and other transporting epithelia (e.g. lung, trachea, eye, pancreas, etc.) (5Nielsen S. Smith B.L. Christensen E.I. Knepper M.A. Agre P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 371-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 6Nielsen S. Smith B.L. Christensen E.I. Agre P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Thus, our study in cholangiocytes provides the first evidence for hormone-regulated membrane insertion of AQP1 water channels.Secretin is known to stimulate ductal bile secretion by binding to its receptor on the basolateral domain of cholangiocytes (7Farouk M. Vigna S.R. McVey D.C. Meyers W.C. Gastroenterology. 1992; 102: 963-968Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a ligand-receptor interaction that also activates cyclic AMP. Cyclic AMP then activates cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator Cl−channels, which would operate in parallel with an apical Cl−/HCO3−. Although the actual solutes responsible for the osmotically driven ductal water secretion are unknown, HCO3− as well as Cl− are currently considered likely to be involved (1Marinelli R.A. LaRusso N.F. Rothschild M.A. Berk P.D. Gollan J.L. Seminars in Liver Disease. 16. Thieme Medical Publishers, Inc., New York1996: 221-229Google Scholar, 2Boyer J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: G1-G5PubMed Google Scholar). Secretin-induced bile secretion has also been shown by morphologic techniques to be associated with a decrease in cytoplasmic vesicles (8Buanes T. Grotmol T. Landsverk T. Raeder M.G. Gastroenterology. 1988; 95: 417-424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which was interpreted as reflecting exocytic insertion into cholangiocyte plasma membrane (10Kato A. Gores G.J. LaRusso N.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15523-15529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, these observations support the occurrence of an exocytic process involved in secretin-induced ductal water secretion. In line with these observations, the results of this study indicate that secretin enhances cholangiocyteP f by inducing the exocytic insertion of AQP1 into cholangiocyte plasma membranes. Although the precise cellular mechanisms by which secretin mediates this exocytic translocation of AQP1 require additional study, they are likely to overlap with processes that modulate, via a cyclic AMP cascade, the trafficking of the vasopressin-regulated water channel AQP2 in the kidney and the insulin-sensitive glucose transporter GLUT 4 in adipocytes and muscle cells (11Bradbury N.A. Bridges R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C1-C24Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Our data demonstrate that secretin significantly increased cholangiocyte water permeability, an effect that was reversibly inhibited by the known water channel blocker HgCl2. These results indicate that the mercury-sensitive water channel AQP1 mediates the secretin-induced increase in cholangiocyte P f. Although the mercury-sensitive water channel AQP2 is not expressed in cholangiocytes, 2N. F. LaRusso, unpublished data. we cannot exclude that other, as yet unidentified, mercury-sensitive water channels contribute to the secretin effect.The dose-response relationship of the secretin-stimulated increase in cholangiocyte P f showed a progressive rise up to 10−7m; increasing the concentration to 10−6m failed to further increaseP f (Fig. 1 B), suggesting that autoinhibition is activated at this concentration, a phenomenon also reported for vasopressin-induced water permeability in the kidney (23Breyer M.D. Ando Y. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 711-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar).As the functional studies suggested, secretin markedly increased the amount of AQP1 in cholangiocyte plasma membranes while simultaneously decreasing the amount of AQP1 in microsomes (Fig. 2). Based on the quantitative immunoblots for AQP1 and the total membrane proteins in each cholangiocyte membrane fraction, we estimated that under basal (non-stimulated) conditions approximately 70% of the total amount of cholangiocyte AQP1 would reside in intracellular membranes, whereas the rest would be present in plasma membranes (i.e. ∼30%). Interestingly, in cells in which AQP1 is constitutively expressed, most of the water channel (∼95%) is associated with plasma membranes (5Nielsen S. Smith B.L. Christensen E.I. Knepper M.A. Agre P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 371-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar,6Nielsen S. Smith B.L. Christensen E.I. Agre P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7275-7279Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). After secretin treatment, AQP1 became predominant in plasma membranes (i.e. about 65% of total), and this increase was proportional to the decrease of AQP1 observed in microsomes; the total amount of AQP1 in both membrane fractions was not affected by secretin. The estimated subcellular distributions of AQP1 in basal and secretin-stimulated cholangiocytes are in very good agreement with those reported for other hormone-regulated transporters, such as aquaporin 2 and GLUT 4 (24Marples D. Knepper M.A. Christensen E.I. Nielsen S. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C655-C664Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Cushman S.W. Wardzala L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4758-4762Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Piper R.C. Hess L.J. James D.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C570-C580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is important to mention that minor levels of cross-contamination (about 10%) between plasma and microsomal membrane fractions were observed, but this did not significantly affect the calculations. Thus, the stoichiometric nature of this relationship further supports a redistribution of preexisting AQP1 water channels from an unidentified intracellular pool (associated with microsomal membranes) to cholangiocyte plasma membrane in response to secretin.The fact that the secretin-induced relocation of AQP1 as well as the increased cholangiocyte P f was disturbed by two perturbations (Figs. 3 and 4) that block secretin-induced exocytosis in cholangiocytes (10Kato A. Gores G.J. LaRusso N.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15523-15529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (i.e. treatment with colchicine and exposure to low temperature) is consistent with the view that a microtubule-dependent exocytic insertion of AQP1-containing vesicles mediates the secretin-induced water permeability increase in cholangiocytes. Similar observations have been described for the vasopressin-mediated increase in water permeability in the kidney, which is also dependent on the integrity of the microtubular network (27Bourguet J. Hugon J.S. Valenti G. Svelto M. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1988; 90A: 669-672Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Our results also agree with observations in renal proximal tubule cells indicating that microtubules are involved in the insertion of AQP1 into plasma membranes (28Elkjaer M. Birn H. Agre P. Christensen E.I. Nielsen S. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 67: 57-72PubMed Google Scholar).In conclusion, the results of this study suggest that secretin facilitates osmotic water transport in cholangiocytes by inducing the microtubule-dependent targeting of vesicles containing AQP1 water channels to the plasma membrane. We propose that this pathway provides a molecular mechanism accounting for the ability of secretin to stimulate ductal bile secretion. Bile is formed primarily by hepatocytes and secreted at the bile canaliculus; subsequently, its volume and composition are modified in the lumen of bile ducts as a result of the transport of water and solutes by cholangiocytes (1Marinelli R.A.

For example, in renal collecting tubule cells the water channel aquaporin-2 moves to and from the apical plasma membrane in the presence and absence of vasopressin, respectively (12Knepper M.A. Proc.

For these reasons, we hypothesized that secretin stimulates ductal bile secretion by inducing the translocation of functional AQP1 water channels into the plasma membrane of cholangiocytes. DISCUSSIONCurrent concepts concerning hormonal regulation of cell membrane water permeability come primarily from studies of the kidney. In the renal collecting duct, vasopressin binds to its receptor on the basolateral membrane of tubular principal cells; the intracellular levels of cyclic AMP rise; intracellular vesicles containing AQP2 water channels fuse with the apical membrane; and water transport increases (21Nielsen S.

Thus, our study in cholangiocytes provides the first evidence for hormone-regulated membrane insertion of AQP1 water channels.Secretin is known to stimulate ductal bile secretion by binding to its receptor on the basolateral domain of cholangiocytes (7Farouk M. Vigna S.R. McVey D.C. Meyers W.C. Gastroenterology. 1992; 102: 963-968Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a ligand-receptor interaction that also activates cyclic AMP. Cyclic AMP then activates cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator Cl−channels, which would operate in parallel with an apical Cl−/HCO3−. Although the actual solutes responsible for the osmotically driven ductal water secretion are unknown, HCO3− as well as Cl− are currently considered likely to be involved (1Marinelli R.A. LaRusso N.F. Rothschild M.A. Berk P.D. Gollan J.L. Seminars in Liver Disease. 16. Thieme Medical Publishers, Inc., New York1996: 221-229Google Scholar, 2Boyer J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: G1-G5PubMed Google Scholar). Secretin-induced bile secretion has also been shown by morphologic techniques to be associated with a decrease in cytoplasmic vesicles (8Buanes T. Grotmol T. Landsverk T. Raeder M.G. Gastroenterology. 1988; 95: 417-424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which was interpreted as reflecting exocytic insertion into cholangiocyte plasma membrane (10Kato A. Gores G.J. LaRusso N.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15523-15529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, these observations support the occurrence of an exocytic process involved in secretin-induced ductal water secretion. In line with these observations, the results of this study indicate that secretin enhances cholangiocyteP f by inducing the exocytic insertion of AQP1 into cholangiocyte plasma membranes. Although the precise cellular mechanisms by which secretin mediates this exocytic translocation of AQP1 require additional study, they are likely to overlap with processes that modulate, via a cyclic AMP cascade, the trafficking of the vasopressin-regulated water channel AQP2 in the kidney and the insulin-sensitive glucose transporter GLUT 4 in adipocytes and muscle cells (11Bradbury N.A. Bridges R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C1-C24Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Our data demonstrate that secretin significantly increased cholangiocyte water permeability, an effect that was reversibly inhibited by the known water channel blocker HgCl2. These results indicate that the mercury-sensitive water channel AQP1 mediates the secretin-induced increase in cholangiocyte P f. Although the mercury-sensitive water channel AQP2 is not expressed in cholangiocytes, 2N. F. LaRusso, unpublished data. we cannot exclude that other, as yet unidentified, mercury-sensitive water channels contribute to the secretin effect.The dose-response relationship of the secretin-stimulated increase in cholangiocyte P f showed a progressive rise up to 10−7m; increasing the concentration to 10−6m failed to further increaseP f (Fig. 1 B), suggesting that autoinhibition is activated at this concentration, a phenomenon also reported for vasopressin-induced water permeability in the kidney (23Breyer M.D. Ando Y. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 711-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar).As the functional studies suggested, secretin markedly increased the amount of AQP1 in cholangiocyte plasma membranes while simultaneously decreasing the amount of AQP1 in microsomes (Fig. 2). Based on the quantitative immunoblots for AQP1 and the total membrane proteins in each cholangiocyte membrane fraction, we estimated that under basal (non-stimulated) conditions approximately 70% of the total amount of cholangiocyte AQP1 would reside in intracellular membranes, whereas the rest would be present in plasma membranes (i.e. ∼30%). Interestingly, in cells in which AQP1 is constitutively expressed, most of the water channel (∼95%) is associated with plasma membranes (5Nielsen S. Smith B.L. Christensen E.I. Knepper M.A. Agre P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 371-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar,6Nielsen S. Smith B.L. Christensen E.I. Agre P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7275-7279Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). After secretin treatment, AQP1 became predominant in plasma membranes (i.e. about 65% of total), and this increase was proportional to the decrease of AQP1 observed in microsomes; the total amount of AQP1 in both membrane fractions was not affected by secretin. The estimated subcellular distributions of AQP1 in basal and secretin-stimulated cholangiocytes are in very good agreement with those reported for other hormone-regulated transporters, such as aquaporin 2 and GLUT 4 (24Marples D. Knepper M.A. Christensen E.I. Nielsen S. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C655-C664Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Cushman S.W. Wardzala L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4758-4762Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Piper R.C. Hess L.J. James D.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C570-C580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is important to mention that minor levels of cross-contamination (about 10%) between plasma and microsomal membrane fractions were observed, but this did not significantly affect the calculations. Thus, the stoichiometric nature of this relationship further supports a redistribution of preexisting AQP1 water channels from an unidentified intracellular pool (associated with microsomal membranes) to cholangiocyte plasma membrane in response to secretin.The fact that the secretin-induced relocation of AQP1 as well as the increased cholangiocyte P f was disturbed by two perturbations (Figs. 3 and 4) that block secretin-induced exocytosis in cholangiocytes (10Kato A. Gores G.J. LaRusso N.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15523-15529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (i.e. treatment with colchicine and exposure to low temperature) is consistent with the view that a microtubule-dependent exocytic insertion of AQP1-containing vesicles mediates the secretin-induced water permeability increase in cholangiocytes. Similar observations have been described for the vasopressin-mediated increase in water permeability in the kidney, which is also dependent on the integrity of the microtubular network (27Bourguet J. Hugon J.S. Valenti G. Svelto M. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1988; 90A: 669-672Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Our results also agree with observations in renal proximal tubule cells indicating that microtubules are involved in the insertion of AQP1 into plasma membranes (28Elkjaer M. Birn H. Agre P. Christensen E.I. Nielsen S. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 67: 57-72PubMed Google Scholar).In conclusion, the results of this study suggest that secretin facilitates osmotic water transport in cholangiocytes by inducing the microtubule-dependent targeting of vesicles containing AQP1 water channels to the plasma membrane. We propose that this pathway provides a molecular mechanism accounting for the ability of secretin to stimulate ductal bile secretion. Current concepts concerning hormonal regulation of cell membrane water permeability come primarily from studies of the kidney. In the renal collecting duct, vasopressin binds to its receptor on the basolateral membrane of tubular principal cells; the intracellular levels of cyclic AMP rise; intracellular vesicles containing AQP2 water channels fuse with the apical membrane; and water transport increases (21Nielsen S.

J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C1546-C1551Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the homologous water channel AQP1 is thought to be constitutively expressed in plasma membranes of renal cells (i.e. in proximal tubules and the descending limbs of Henle) and other transporting epithelia (e.g. lung, trachea, eye, pancreas, etc.) (5Nielsen S. Smith B.L. Christensen E.I. Knepper M.A. Agre P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 371-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 6Nielsen S. Smith B.L. Christensen E.I. Agre P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Several forms of leptin receptors produced by alternative mRNA splicing are found in many tissues, including the hypothalamus, liver, lung, kidney, hematopoietic cells, and gonads, suggesting that leptin exerts effects in these tissues. In accordance with the distribution of leptin receptors, there is accumulating evidence that leptin plays various roles in reproduction, hematopoiesis, and the immune systems in addition to the regulation of food intake and energy expenditure. In the present study, we examined the in vitro effects of leptin on proliferation of a mouse embryonic cell line, C3H10T1/2, and its mechanism of action. Leptin caused a dose- and time-dependent increase in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity that was accompanied by an increase in C3H10T1/2 cell number. The MAPK kinase-1-specific inhibitor PD98059 completely blocked the increases in both MAPK activity and cell proliferation caused by leptin. These findings indicate that leptin stimulates the proliferation of C3H10T1/2 cells via the MAPK cascade. Leptin, secreted by adipocytes, regulates satiety and energy expenditure.

Furthermore, leptin receptors are expressed in various tissues including lung, kidney, testis, and adipose tissue (11Tartaglia A.L. Dembski M. Weng X. Deng N. Culpepper J. Devos R. Richards J.G.

However, the mechanism of its signal transduction in these organs remains unclear. Recently, STATs 1The abbreviations used are: STAT, signal transducers and activators of transcription; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; BME, basal minimum Eagle's medium; FCS, fetal calf serum; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; IL, interleukin. 1The abbreviations used are: STAT, signal transducers and activators of transcription; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; BME, basal minimum Eagle's medium; FCS, fetal calf serum; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; IL, interleukin. have been suggested to be involved in the signal transduction mechanism of leptin. It was reported that leptin activated STAT-1, -3, and -5 (13Ghilardi N. Ziegler S. Wiestner A. Stoffel R,. Heim M.H. Skoda R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Furthermore, activation of STAT-3 by leptin was observed in the hypothalamus in vivo(15Vaisse C. Halaas J.L. Horvath C.M. Darnell Jr., J.E. Stoffel M. Friedman J.M. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar). We recently found that leptin induced tyrosine phosphorylation of several cellular proteins including STAT-1 in ACHN cells (cloned human renal carcinoma cells) and suggested that ACHN cells were useful for analyzing the signal transduction mechanism of leptin (16Takahashi Y. Okimura Y. Mizuno I. Takahashi T. Kaji H. Uchiyama T. Abe H. Chihara K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 859-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). On the other hand, pathways other than STATs may be involved in leptin signal transduction system. Because leptin is considered to be a member of the cytokine family from the results of structural analysis (17Maedej M. Boguski M.S. Bryant S.H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 373: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), its signal transduction system may be similar to those of other cytokines. Many cytokines stimulate a molecular cascade coupled with Ras activation (18Egan S.E. Giddings B.W. Brooks M.W. Buday L. Sizeland A.M. Weinberg R.A.

Thus, we examined the involvement of MAPKs in the leptin signal transduction and the effects of MAPK activation caused by leptin on cell growth using the mouse embryonic cell line C3H10T1/2. C3H10T1/2 cells were kindly provided by Dr. Tatsuya Kobayashi (Kobe University). The sources of materials used in this study were as follows: basal minimum Eagle's medium (BME) was from Life Technologies, Inc.; fetal calf serum (FCS) was from Bio Whittaker; PD98059, anti-phospho-MAPK antibody, Elk1 fusion protein, and anti-phospho-Elk1 were from New England Biolabs; and [3H]thymidine, polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and the ECL chemiluminescence kit were from Amersham Corp. A human leptin cDNA fragment spanning nucleotides +64 to +501, encoding the full-length leptin protein, was cloned from human adipose tissue by reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction. The cDNA was cloned into the expression vector pET 29b to produce S peptide-tagged leptin and expressed in Escherichia coli. BL21 (DE3), as described previously (16Takahashi Y. Okimura Y. Mizuno I. Takahashi T. Kaji H. Uchiyama T. Abe H. Chihara K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 859-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Recombinant leptin protein was purified using an S-Tag purification kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. After cleavage of S peptide by thrombin, the recombinant leptin was purified and confirmed to migrate as a single band on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The bioactivity of the recombinant leptin was confirmed by Western blotting to detect tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins of ACHN cells as described previously (16Takahashi Y. Okimura Y. Mizuno I. Takahashi T. Kaji H. Uchiyama T. Abe H. Chihara K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 859-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). C3H10T1/2 cells were cultured in BME supplemented with 8% FCS in an atmosphere of 5% CO2at 37 °C as described previously (26Reznikoff C.A. Brankow D.W. Heidelberger C. Cancer Res. 1973; 33: 3231-3278PubMed Google Scholar). Approximately 48 h before the assay, C3H10T1/2 cells were seeded into 24-well plates at 1–3 × 105 cells/well. When cells reached 60–70% confluence, the medium was replaced with BME containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and then recombinant leptin, PD98059, or both were added at the indicated concentrations. The cultures were incubated in a CO2 incubator for 72 h at 37 °C unless otherwise indicated. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and stripped with 0.05% trypsin-0.53 mm EDTA. The cell number was then determined using a cell counter. All samples were assayed in duplicate, and each experiment was repeated at least three times. Representative data are presented. Cells were treated as described under “Cell Proliferation Assays.” Live and dead cells from each subculture were counted by trypan blue at sequential time points during incubation, and the ratio of dead/(dead + live) cells was calculated. The mean values of these ratios and the S.E. were calculated at each time point. Following starvation for 24 h, C3H10T1/2 cells were incubated with leptin at the indicated concentrations for 20 h. Then the medium was replaced with 1 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine in BME with 0.1% BSA. After further incubation for 3 h, cells were washed twice with PBS, incubated with 5% trichloroacetic acid for 6 h at 4 °C, washed twice with 5% trichloroacetic acid, and lysed with 1n NaOH. Thymidine incorporation was then determined by scintillation counting. C3H10T1/2 cells were cultured in 60-mm dishes in BME with 5% FCS. When approximately 70–80% confluent, the cells were starved for 24 h, washed with PBS, and then incubated in cell assay medium, comprising of BME containing 0.1% BSA and leptin. Leptin at 100 ng/ml was used for time course experiments, and the incubation time was 15 min for dose-response experiments. PD98059 was added 1 h before leptin stimulation. After incubation, MAPK activity of C3H10T1/2 cells was measured as described previously (27Marais R. Wynne J. Treisman R.

Briefly, the cells were washed with PBS, lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), scraped off the dishes, transferred to microcentrifuge tubes, sonicated, incubated overnight at 4 °C, and microcentrifuged for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was used for immunoprecipitation of activated MAPKs. The supernatant was incubated with anti-phospho-MAPK antibody (1:100 dilution) for 4 h. Protein A-agarose beads were then added to the tubes and incubated for another 3 h. The pellets were washed twice with ice-cold lysis buffer and twice with kinase buffer (25 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mmMgCl2). The pellets were incubated with 100 mmATP, and 20 mg/ml Elk1 fusion protein, a substrate of MAPK, for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction was terminated by adding Laemmli buffer. Samples were boiled, separated by electrophoresis through a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in blocking buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 5% skimmed milk, 0.1% Tween 20) and then probed with 1:1000 anti-phospho-Elk1 antibody. The membranes were washed three times in 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton-X and incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin in antibody dilution buffer. The immunoreactivity of phosphorylated Elk1 was determined using an ECL chemiluminescence kit. Statistical analysis was performed by analysis of variance, followed by Scheffe's test. p < 0.05 was considered significant. Data are expressed as the means ± S.E. After screening a number of cell lines to find leptin-responsive cells, we found that leptin stimulated proliferation of the mouse embryonic cell line C3H10T1/2 in a time- and dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1, Aand B). The number of C3H10T1/2 cells was increased by approximately 2.5-fold following a 72-h incubation with 100 ng/ml leptin (Fig. 1 A). The phenotypic features of the C3H10T1/2 cells were not changed. To exclude the possibility that leptin acted as a survival factor and suppressed the cell death of C3H10T1/2 cells, we counted the numbers of live and dead cells in time course experiments. The ratio of dead cells to total cell number of leptin-treated cells was not significantly different from that in untreated cells (TableI). Leptin-induced cell proliferation was dose-dependent over the range of 0–100 ng/ml (Fig.1 B). The cell number at higher concentrations (200 ng/ml) was less than that at 100 ng/ml leptin. Leptin stimulated thymidine uptake in C3H10T1/2 cells dose-dependently (Fig.1 C). The lowest stimulatory dose was 50 ng/ml, and maximal stimulation was achieved at 100 ng/ml. The dose-response relationship of thymidine uptake in C3H10T1/2 cells by leptin correlated well with that of the increase in cell number evoked by leptin.Table ILeptin did not inhibit the cell deathIncubation time0 h24 h48 h72 h% dead cells/total cellsControl1.5 ± 0.632.4 ± 1.638.1 ± 0.545.8 ± 0.9Leptin (100 ng/ml)1.4 ± 0.532.9 ± 0.337.4 ± 0.744.5 ± 0.4 Open table in a new tab Various cytokines and growth factors stimulate MAPK activation and cell proliferation. For example, insulin transduces the signal to the nucleus by activating a cascade involving Ras, Raf-1, MEKK (MAPK kinase), and MAPK (30White M.F. Kahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and consequently stimulated cell growth. Insulin stimulated cell growth and MAPK activation in C3H10T1/2 cells. 2Y. Takahashi, Y. Okimura, I. Mizuno, K. Iida, T. Takahashi, H. Kaji, H. Abe, and K. Chihara, unpublished observation. On the basis of the analogy between leptin and insulin with regard to stimulation of C3H10T1/2 cells proliferation, we hypothesized that the MAPK cascade was involved in signal transduction of leptin and measured MAPK activities after leptin stimulation in C3H10T1/2 cells. Phosphorylated active MAPK was collected from cell lysates using anti-phospho-MAPK (Tyr204) antibody, and its activity was determined by the amount of phosphorylated Elk1 fusion protein. Leptin stimulated Elk 1 phosphorylation in a dose- and time-dependent manner, and the phosphorylation of Elk 1 appeared to plateau with the addition of 40–60 ng/ml leptin (Fig.2, A and B). To determine if MAPK activation is responsible for leptin-induced proliferation of C3H10T1/2 cells, we used the MEK1 inhibitor PD98059, because it has been shown to act as a highly selective inhibitor of MEK1 and the MAPK cascade (31Dudley D.T.

At 10 μm, PD98059 inhibited leptin-induced MAPK activation, and 50 μmPD98059 inhibited leptin-induced MAPK activation completely (Fig.3). To clarify the involvement of MAPKs in leptin-induced cell growth, we examined the effects of PD98059 on leptin-induced proliferation of C3H10T1/2 cells. Time course experiments showed that PD98059 dose-dependently inhibited cell proliferation induced by leptin (Fig. 4 A). The IC50 of PD98059 for suppression of leptin-induced cell proliferation was approximately 25 μm (Fig.4 B), and 50 μm PD98059 showed complete inhibition of both leptin-induced and insulin-induced cell proliferation (Fig. 4 C). In the present study, we demonstrated that leptin induced cell proliferation in the mouse embryonic cell line C3H10T1/2. Leptin increased cell number and thymidine uptake of C3H10T1/2 cells but did not inhibit cell death. These findings indicated that leptin exerted its action as a mitogen but not as a survival factor. Furthermore, the mitogenic effect of leptin was dose-dependent and was observed over the physiological concentration range (35Considine R.V. Sinha M.K. Heiman M.L. Kriaucinas A. Syephens T.W.

C3H10T1/2 cells are mouse embryonic fibroblasts and have the potency to differentiate to muscle cells, adipocytes, and chondrocytes following 5-aza-CR treatment (36Constantinides P.G. Jones P.A.

Recently, Bennett et al. reported that leptin and its cognate receptor constituted a novel hematopoietic pathway that was required for normal lymphopoiesis (7Bennett B.D. Solar G.P. Yuan J.Q. Mathias J. Thomas G.R. Matthews W. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1170-1180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar), and Gainsford et al. noted that leptin was able to induce proliferation, differentiation, and functional activation of hematopoietic cells (8Gainsford T. Willson T.A. Metcalf D. Handman E. McFarlane C. Ng A. Nicola N.A. Alexander W.S. Hilton D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14564-14568Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations suggest that leptin may have a role in the proliferation and differentiation of mesenchymal cells. In addition, we found that leptin induced activation of MAPKs in C3H10T1/2 cells. It is not surprising that leptin induced cell proliferation, because its structure resembles those of cytokines such as IL-2, IL-6, and growth hormone (17Maedej M. Boguski M.S. Bryant S.H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 373: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), and leptin receptor is related to gp130, which is the signal-transducing component of IL-6, ciliary neurotrophic factor, leukemia inhibitory factor, oncostatin-M, IL-11, and cardiotropin-1 receptors (11Tartaglia A.L.

The sustained activation of MAPKs is sufficient to induce the proliferation or differentiation of several types of cells (47Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4209) Google Scholar). To clarify whether the MAPK pathway is involved in leptin-induced cell proliferation, PD98059, a specific inhibitor of MAPK kinase-1 (31Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2581) Google Scholar), was added to the culture medium of C3H10T1/2 cells. PD98059 specifically inhibits the action of MAPK kinase-1 both in vitro andin vivo (33Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol.

Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13585-13588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar) and insulin-induced MAPK activation in 3T3L-1 cells and L6 cells (34Lazar D.F. Wiese R.J. Brady M.J. Mastick C.C. Waters S.B. Yamauchi K. Pessin J.E. Cuatrecasas P. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20801-20807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). In the present study, PD98059 significantly suppressed leptin-induced MAPK activation in C3H10T1/2 cells. Moreover, PD98059 completely inhibited leptin-induced proliferation of C3H10T1/2 cells. These findings demonstrated that MAPKs were essential in C3H10T1/2 cell proliferation caused by leptin. Several findings have suggested that STATs proteins are involved in the mechanism of leptin signal transduction. Ghilardi et al. and Baumann et al. reported that leptin activated STAT-1, -3, and -5 (13Ghilardi N. Ziegler S. Wiestner A. Stoffel R,. Heim M.H. Skoda R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6231-6235Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar) and STAT-3, -5, and -6 (14Baumann H. Moralla K.K. White D.W. Dembski M. Bailon P.S. Kim H. Lai C.F. Tartaglia L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8374-8378Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar), respectively, in artificial reconstruction systems using Cos cells transfected with leptin receptors and STATs. Vaisse et al. showed that leptin activated STAT-3 in the hypothalamus in vivo (15Vaisse C. Halaas J.L. Horvath C.M. Darnell Jr., J.E. Stoffel M. Friedman J.M. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar), although it is not known which hypothalamic cells were activated. We recently reported that in ACHN cells, which are derived from human renal cell carcinoma cells, at least five proteins had undergone tyrosine-phosphorylation 15 min after leptin stimulation (16Takahashi Y. Okimura Y. Mizuno I. Takahashi T. Kaji H. Uchiyama T. Abe H. Chihara K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 859-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The estimated molecular masses of these proteins were approximately 180, 130, 91, 44, and 42 kDa. The 44- and 42-kDa proteins phosphorylated after treatment with leptin were MAPKs.2 These findings suggested that MAPKs in addition to STATs are involved in the signal transduction by leptin in ACHN cells. MAPKs regulate a Janus kinase-STAT signaling cascade in various steps (48Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1723) Google Scholar, 49David M. PetricoinIII E. Benjamin C. Pine R. Weber M.J. Larner A.C. Science. 1995; 269: 1721-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Therefore, activation of MAPKs might modify the STATs signaling pathway in leptin signal transduction. The targets of MAPKs and STATs remain unknown. Wood and Stock reported that intravenous administration of leptin induced c-Fos expression in the hypothalamus where the leptin receptors are present (51Wood A.J. Stock M.J. Nature. 1996; 381: 745Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Thus, c-Fos expression may be one of the targets of MAPKs and STATs pathways activated by leptin as shown in the stimulation by many cytokines. However, further studies are needed to clarify whether the c-Fos gene is the target of MAPKs or STATs activated by leptin. In conclusion, MAPKs are involved in leptin signal transduction and play an essential role in the proliferation of C3H10T1/2 cells induced by leptin.

https://openalex.org/W1563968398,"Abstract Rabbit reticulocyte lysate contains a multiprotein chaperone system that assembles steroid receptors into a complex with hsp90. The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is bound to hsp90 via its hormone binding domain (HBD), which must be associated with hsp90 to have a steroid binding conformation. Recently, we have reconstituted a receptor·hsp90 heterocomplex assembly system with purified rabbit hsp90 and hsp70 and bacterially expressed human p23 and p60 (Dittmar, K. D., Hutchison, K. A., Owens-Grillo, J. K., and Pratt, W. B. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 12833–12839). In this work we show that when the GR is incubated with hsp90, hsp70, and p60, steroid binding sites are generated despite the absence of p23. In this minimal reconstituted system, the GR is incubated with the chaperones in the presence of [3H]triamcinolone acetonide ([3H]TA), which binds to the receptor as GR·hsp90 complexes are formed. When molybdate or p23 is also present during the incubation with chaperones at 30 °C, the formation of steroid binding sites can be assayed by incubating the washed GR with [3H]TA after heterocomplex assembly at 30 °C. However, in the absence of p23 or molybdate, rapid disassembly of GR·hsp90 complexes apparently occurs simultaneously with assembly, such that [3H]TA must be present during the assembly process to trap evidence of conversion of the GR HBD from a non-steroid binding to a steroid binding conformation. Mixture of purified rabbit hsp90 and hsp70 with bacterial lysate containing human p60 results in spontaneous formation of an hsp90·p60·hsp70 complex that can be adsorbed with anti-p60 antibody, and the resulting immune complex converts the GR HBD to a steroid binding state in an ATP-dependent and K+-dependent manner. When the GR is incubated with hsp90, hsp70, and p60 in the presence of the hsp90-binding antibiotic geldanamycin, GR·hsp90·p60· hsp70 complexes are formed, but they have no steroid binding activity. Our data suggest that hsp90, hsp70, and p60 work together as a chaperone complex that possesses all of the folding/unfolding activity necessary to generate the high affinity steroid binding conformation of the receptor."

Distribution of ion channels in specialized areas of cell membrane is essential for various cell functions: for example, voltage-gated Na+ and K+ channels are concentrated at nodes of Ranvier for saltatory conduction in myelinated nerves (1Black J.A. Kocsis J.D. Waxman S.G. Trends Neurosci. 1990; 13: 48-54Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar).

These K+ channels play a pivotal role in determining resting membrane potential, in regulating action potential duration, and in transporting K+ ions. One inwardly rectifying K+ channel, Kir4.1/KAB-2, which we have cloned previously (11Takumi T. Ishii T. Horio Y. Morishige K. Takahashi N. Yamada M. Yamashita T. Kiyama H. Sohmiya K. Nakanishi S. Kurachi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16339-16346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), has an amino acid motif of Ser-X-Val at its COOH terminus. The interaction of Kir4.1 and members of the PSD-95 family may affect the distribution and function of this channel. In this study, the interaction between Kir4.1 and PSD-95 members was studied. We show that PSD-95 and SAP97 (9Müller B.M. Kistner U. Veh R.W. Cases-Langhoff C. Becker B. Gundelfinger E.D. Garner C.C. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 2354-2366Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) can interact with Kir4.1, resulting in clustering the channel proteins on the membrane and enhancing the Kir4.1 current in HEK293T cells. Because we also found that Kir4.1 and SAP97 clustered in retinal glial cells, the PSD-95 family of proteins may be a physiological regulator of the distribution and function of Kir4.1. Rat Kir4.1 (11Takumi T. Ishii T. Horio Y. Morishige K. Takahashi N. Yamada M. Yamashita T. Kiyama H. Sohmiya K. Nakanishi S. Kurachi Y. J. Biol.

Horio Y. Yamada M. Takahashi N. Kondo C. Kurachi Y. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1996; 493: 143-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Rat PSD-95 cDNA was tagged 2Y. Hata and Y. Takai, submitted for publication. with 110 amino acid residues at the COOH terminus of biotin carboxylase carrier protein (BCCP) cDNA (13Germino F.J. Wang Z.X. Weissman S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 933-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and introduced into pCMV5 (kindly provided by Dr. D. E. Russell). For electrophysiological experiments, green fluorescent protein plasmid (14Chalfie M. Tu Y. Euskirchen G. Ward W.W. Prasher D.C. Science. 1994; 263: 802-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (5499) Google Scholar) was co-transfected with Kir4.1 cDNA. Whole-cell and single-channel currents of HEK cells were measured as described (12Yamashita T. Horio Y. Yamada M. Takahashi N. Kondo C. Kurachi Y. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1996; 493: 143-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In whole-cell experiments, the bathing solution contained (in mm): 40 KCl, 100 NaCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 0.53 MgCl2, 5.5 glucose, and 5.5 HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4. The pipette solution contained (in mm): 140 KCl, 5 K2 ATP, 1 MgCl2, 5 EGTA, and 5 HEPES-KOH, pH 7.3. In single-channel recordings, the pipette solution contained (in mm): 140 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2 and 5 HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4. The bath was perfused with the solution composed of (in mm): 140 KCl, 5 EGTA, and 5 HEPES-KOH, pH 7.3, with 2 MgCl2. Anti-KAB-2A1 antibody and anti-KAB-2C2 antibody were raised in rabbits against synthetic peptides corresponding to amino acids 13–26 in the amino-terminal region and amino acids 366–379 in the COOH terminus of rat Kir4.1, respectively. Both antibodies were purified with antigenic peptide-coupled Sulfolink resin (Pierce) (15Ito M. Inanobe A. Horio Y. Hibino H. Isomoto S. Ito H. Mori K. Tonosaki A. Tomoike H. Kurachi Y. FEBS Lett. 1996; 388: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). For immunocytochemical experiments, the anti-KAB-2C2 antibody was used. For identification of Müller cells, monoclonal anti-vimentin antibody (Zymed Laboratory, San Francisco, CA) was used. Efficiencies of PSD-95 and PSD-95-BCCP on clustering Kir4.1 immunoreactivity were essentially the same. Anti-SAP97 antibody was raised in rabbit.2 Cells were examined with a confocal microscopy (MRC-1024, Bio-Rad, Hertfordshire, United Kingdom). Fusion proteins with glutathioneS-transferase (GST) of Kir 4.1 amino acids 165–376 (GST-Kir4.1CΔ) or amino acids 165–379 (GST-Kir4.1C) were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified on glutathione-Sepharose. HEK cells transfected with PSD-95 were homogenized and solubilized in a lysis buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15 mNaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 0.2 mg/ml benzamidine, 30 kilounits/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% Triton X-100) and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Solubilized homogenates were incubated for 2 h with 2 μg of purified fusion protein bound to 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose. Samples were washed four times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.4 m NaCl, resolved by SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and then analyzed by Western blot using anti-PSD-95 antibody (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY). For immunoprecipitation, Kir4.1 (amino acids 1–379) or Kir4.1Δ (amino acids 1–376), which lacks the Ser-Asn-Val motif at the COOH-terminal end, were expressed with PSD-95 in HEK cells. Solubilized proteins of the cells (1 × 107 cells) were incubated with anti-KAB-2A1 antibody (4 μg/ml) overnight at 4 °C. 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose was added to the solution. Protein A pellets were washed four times with PBS containing 1% Triton X-100. Immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and probed with anti-PSD-95 antibody. Müller cells were isolated from retinas of Wistar rats (Nippon Doubutsu, Kyoto, Japan) (16Newman E.A. J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 2423-2432PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the interaction between Kir4.1 and PSD-95, we transiently expressed Kir4.1 and PSD-95-BCCP in HEK cells and examined the distribution immunocytochemically. The anti-Kir4.1 antibody (anti-KAB-2C2) (15Ito M. Inanobe A. Horio Y. Hibino H. Isomoto S. Ito H. Mori K. Tonosaki A. Tomoike H. Kurachi Y. FEBS Lett. 1996; 388: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) was used. The distribution of Kir4.1 immunoreactivity was homogenous in most cells transfected with Kir4.1 alone (green in Fig. 1 A). Prominent clustering of Kir4.1 occurred when PSD-95 was co-expressed (arrows in Fig. 1 B ). In the cells showing clustered distribution of Kir4.1, the PSD-95 protein was always co-expressed (red in Fig. 1 C). Double staining showed that Kir4.1 and PSD-95 co-localized in close vicinity (yellow in Fig. 1 D). Because Kir4.1 and PSD-95 were transiently expressed, some cells expressed only Kir4.1. In Fig.1 B, diffuse staining of Kir4.1 was detected in two cells (arrowheads), where the expression of PSD-95 was not detected (arrowheads in Fig. 1 C). Furthermore, when PSD-95 was expressed alone, it distributed diffusely (Fig.1 G). These results suggest that there is a reciprocal relationship between Kir4.1 and PSD-95 on the cell membrane. SAP97, another member of the PSD-95 family, when co-transfected with Kir4.1 clustered the channel proteins (Fig. 1 E). In these cells, SAP97 itself was also clustered (Fig. 1 F), although it distributed diffusely when transfected alone (Fig. 1 H). Because both of the antibodies against Kir4.1 and SAP97 were raised in rabbit, double staining of Kir4.1 and SAP97 could not be performed. These results, however, strongly suggest that SAP97 also co-localized with Kir4.1 and clustered the channel protein on the cell membrane. To examine the molecular mechanism responsible for interaction between Kir4.1 and PSD-95, a mutant COOH terminus of Kir4.1 (amino acids 165–376), which lacks Ser-Asn-Val motif, and the normal COOH-terminal region of Kir4.1 (amino acids 165–379) were expressed in E. coli with GST as fusion proteins (Fig. 2 A, GST-Kir4.1CΔ and GST-Kir4.1C, respectively). The fusion protein was bound to glutathione-Sepharose and incubated with the lysate of HEK cells, which had been transfected with PSD-95. The bound material was resolved by SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-PSD-95 antibody. PSD-95 in the lysate did not associate with GST-Kir4.1CΔ (Fig. 2 B, GST-Kir4.1CΔ PSD-95) but did so with GST-Kir4.1C (Fig. 2 B, GST-Kir4.1C PSD-95). Such binding was not detected when the lysate of mock-transfected cells was used (Fig. 2 B, GST-Kir4.1C control). To determine whether the interaction of Kir4.1 with PSD-95 occurs in cells, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed. Kir4.1Δ (amino acids 1–376) or the control Kir4.1 was expressed with PSD-95 in HEK cells. Expression of the channel proteins in these cells could be confirmed by anti-KAB-2A1 antibody (Fig. 2 A, Kir4.1Δ and Kir4.1). Immunoprecipitants from these cells using anti-KAB-2A1 were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-PSD-95 antibody. The immunoprecipitant from the cells expressing Kir4.1 plus PSD-95 (Fig.2 B, Kir4.1+PSD-95 IP), but not from those expressing Kir4.1Δ plus PSD-95 (Fig. 2 B, Kir4.1Δ+PSD-95 IP), contained the PSD-95-band. These results indicate that PSD-95 may form a macroprotein complex with Kir4.1 and that the Ser-Asn-Val motif of Kir4.1 is indispensable for the interaction. PSD-95 may also affect the function of Kir4.1. Using the patch clamp technique, we compared Kir4.1 channel activity in HEK cells co-expressed with or without PSD-95 (Fig. 3). In the whole-cell clamp mode, the membrane currents elicited by command steps were compared (Fig. 3A). Both cells expressed K+ currents which were blocked by 1 mm Ba2+ (Fig.3 B). In the control cells or those transfected with only PSD-95, the Ba2+-sensitive K+ current was not detected (n = 10 for each, data not shown). The inwardly rectifying K+ current in the cells transfected with both Kir4.1 and PSD-95 was more than two times greater than that observed in those transfected with Kir4.1 alone. At −120 mV, the Ba2+-sensitive K+ current was 325.6 ± 56.3 pA/pF in those transfected with both Kir4.1 and PSD-95 (n = 6), and 134.3 ± 50.2 pA/pF in the cells expressing Kir4.1 alone (n = 11, p < 0.001, Fig. 3 C). When Kir4.1 was co-transfected with SAP97, the K+ current was more than three times larger than that observed with Kir4.1 alone (426.9 ± 64.7 pA/pF, n= 7, p < 0.001, Fig. 3 C). The single channel properties of Kir4.1 in the cells transfected with both Kir4.1 and PSD-95 and in those with Kir4.1 alone did not differ from each other (Fig. 3, D and E). The unitary channel conductances of Kir4.1 alone, Kir4.1 plus PSD-95 and Kir4.1 plus SAP97 were 22.1 ± 1.4 pS (n = 3), 20.6 ± 1.0 pS (n = 3), 21.7 ± 0.8 pS (n = 3), respectively. Open probabilities of the Kir4.1 channel with and without PSD-95 family proteins were constant ∼0.9 between −40 and −100 mV (data not shown). These results suggest that the larger current in the cells co-expressing Kir4.1 and PSD-95 or SAP97 has resulted from an increase in the number of functional Kir4.1 channels in the membrane. The interaction of PSD-95 family and Kir4.1 might also occur in vivo. To examine this possibility, we studied cellular distribution of Kir4.1 in retinal glial cells (Müller cells) (11Takumi T. Ishii T. Horio Y. Morishige K. Takahashi N. Yamada M. Yamashita T. Kiyama H. Sohmiya K. Nakanishi S. Kurachi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16339-16346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar,17Horio Y. Hibino H. Inanobe A. Ito M. Yamada M. Tada Y. Kurachi Y. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 108: 23a-24aGoogle Scholar). Isolated Müller cells were stained with the anti-Kir4.1 antibody. The immunoreactivity of Kir4.1 (Fig.4 A) clustered on the membrane of cells, which were stained with vimentin, a marker of Müller cells (Fig.4 B). Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction using mRNA of an isolated single Müller cell and specific primers for the second PDZ domain of PSD-95 family showed that at least SAP97 was expressed in the cell. Thus, we stained Müller cells with anti-SAP97 antibody (Figs. 4, D–F). SAP97 was expressed and clustered in Müller cells in a similar manner to Kir4.1. It is, therefore, strongly suggested that SAP97 might be responsible for aggregation of Kir4.1 in Müller cells. The major findings of this study are 1) Kir4.1 was shown to interact with PSD-95 through the Ser-Asn-Val motif; 2) the PSD-95 family proteins caused not only clustering of Kir4.1 on the cell membrane, but also increased the number of functional channels; 3) this interaction may occur in vivo and might be important for the physiological function of Kir4.1 channels. The co-localization of Kir4.1 and PSD-95 in the cell membrane may result from direct interaction between these proteins, because PSD-95 bound to the GST-fusion protein of Kir4.1 C terminus and, moreover, was co-immunoprecipitated with Kir4.1. Because both interactions disappeared when the Ser-Asn-Val motif was deleted from Kir4.1, the motif is indispensable for Kir4.1-binding to PSD-95. The interaction is not, however, specific to PSD-95 itself, because SAP97 could also cause clustering of Kir4.1. PDZ domains in various proteins can interact with each other,e.g. the PDZ domain of neuronal nitric-oxide synthase interacts with the second PDZ of PSD-95, and nitric-oxide synthase and skeletal muscle syntrophin also interact through their PDZ domains (18Brenman J.E. Chao D.S. Gee S.H. McGee A.W. Craven S.E. Santillano D.R. Wu Z. Huang F. Xia H. Peters M.F. Froehner S.C. Bredt D.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 757-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1443) Google Scholar). Thus, PSD-95 proteins might self-aggregate through their PDZ domains. However, because PSD-95 and SAP97 diffusely distributed when transfected alone (Figs. 1, G and H), the formation of a protein complex with Kir4.1 might be essential for their aggregation. Co-expression of Kir4.1 with PSD-95 or SAP97 prominently enhanced the whole-cell Kir4.1 currents. Because single-channel properties of Kir4.1 were not changed by the expression of PSD-95 or SAP97, an increase in the functional number of Kir4.1 channels should be mainly responsible for the increase. An increase in functional channel number can be achieved either by increasing the number of Kir4.1 proteins in the membrane and/or by facilitating formation of functional channels. hdlg, a member of the PSD-95 family, was reported to bind band 4.1 protein, which co-localizes with actin (8Lue R.A. Marfatia S.M. Branton D. Chishti A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9818-9822Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Thus, Kir4.1 forming a macroprotein complex with PSD-95 might be linked to the cytoskeletal matrix through associated proteins and could be stabilized in the membrane. Another possibility is that the PSD-95 family might facilitate formation of functional Kir4.1 tetramers, because the tetrameric structure is essential for channel function (19Yang J. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1441-1447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Through such a mechanism, even if the total number of monomer subunit proteins expressed was not increased, the number of functional tetramers could be increased. At present, we cannot discriminate these possibilities. To elucidate the molecular mechanism of enhancement of Kir4.1 channel activity by PSD-95 family proteins, further studies are needed. We found clustered distribution of Kir4.1 on the membrane of retinal Müller glial cells. Thus, clustering of Kir4.1 occurs in vivo. Immunostaining also showed that SAP97 was clustered in Müller cells. SAP97 might, thus, be responsible for clustering of Kir4.1 in Müller cells. Because Kir 4.1 is the dominant Kir channel in glial cells, Kir4.1 is considered to play a major role in spatial buffering of K+ ions, which regulates extracellular K+ ions released by synaptic excitations in brain and retina (20Orkand R.K. Nicholls J.G. Kuffler S.W. J. Neurophysiol. 1966; 29: 788-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). The clustering and enhanced function of Kir4.1 mediated by PSD-95 family proteins may be essential for rapid K+exchange between glial cells and neurons.

https://openalex.org/W2128516095,"Oxidation of low density lipoproteins (LDL) has been implicated as a causal factor in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Oxidized LDL has been found to exhibit numerous potentially atherogenic properties in vitro, including receptor-mediated uptake by macrophages. Oxidized LDL is a ligand for the class A scavenger receptor type I/II (SR-AI/II), but cross-competition studies with cultured macrophages suggested that there is an additional receptor(s) that is specific for oxidized LDL and that does not interact with acetyl LDL or other chemically modified LDL. A number of macrophage membrane proteins, including CD36, FcγRII-B2, scavenger receptor BI, and macrosialin/CD68, have been found to bind to oxidized LDL in vitro and have been proposed as candidate oxidized LDL receptors. However, because of overlapping ligand specificity with the SR-AI/II, it has been difficult to evaluate the relative importance of these proteins in the uptake of oxidized LDL by macrophages. In the present report, we have studied the uptake and degradation of oxidized LDL by macrophages from mice in which the SR-AI/II gene had been disrupted. The uptake of acetyl LDL was reduced by more than 80% in macrophages from scavenger receptor knockout mice, confirming that most of the uptake of acetyl LDL by macrophages can be attributed to this receptor. In contrast, the uptake of extensively oxidized LDL was reduced by only 30% and showed high affinity, saturable uptake with apparent K m of about 5 μg/ml, similar to that of the SR-AI/II. This indicates that about 70% of the uptake of oxidized LDL in macrophages is attributable to an alternate oxidized LDL receptor(s). In contrast to findings reported with CD36, mildly oxidized LDL was internalized much more slowly than extensively oxidized LDL. Unlabeled oxidized LDL, polyinosinic acid, phosphatidylserine-rich liposomes, and LDL or bovine albumin modified by fatty acid oxidation products were effective competitors for the uptake of radioiodinated oxidized LDL by macrophages from knockout mice, whereas acetyl LDL and malondialdehyde-modified LDL were relatively poor competitors. This ligand specificity differs from that of CD36-related (class B) scavenger receptors but is similar to the reported specificity of macrosialin/CD68 in ligand blots. However, the rate of uptake of oxidized LDL by knockout macrophages was not increased by phorbol ester or in thioglycollate-elicited macrophages, both of which are expected to increase the amount of macrosialin on the cell surface. In macrophages from SR-AI/II knockout mice, ligand blots of membrane proteins with iodinated, oxidized, or acetylated LDL revealed several bands, with apparent molecular size on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of 60, 94, 124, and 210 kDa, but none of the bands were specific for oxidized LDL. These results provide direct evidence that a receptor other than SR-AI/II is responsible for most of the uptake of oxidized LDL in murine macrophages, but further studies are needed to identify the receptor(s) involved.

Lancet. 1996; 347: 781-786Abstract PubMed Scopus (1671) Google Scholar). One of the properties that distinguishes oxidized LDL from native LDL is the ability to bind to “scavenger” receptors on macrophages (34Steinbrecher U. Parthasarathy S. Leake D. Witztum J. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3883-3887Crossref PubMed Scopus (1418) Google Scholar,35Steinbrecher U.P. Witztum J.L. Parthasarathy S. Steinberg D. Arteriosclerosis. 1987; 7: 135-143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been postulated that this could lead to unregulated cholesterol accumulation in macrophages, resulting in the formation of foam cells (1Steinberg D. Parthasarathy S. Carew T.E. Khoo J.C. Witztum J.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1989; 320: 915-924Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Brown M.S. Basu S.K. Falck J.R. Ho Y.K. Goldstein J.L. J. Supramol. Struct. 1980; 13: 67-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). The term scavenger receptor has been applied to a number of different cell-surface proteins that can bind to chemically or biologically modified lipoproteins and/or senescent cells. The first scavenger receptor to be fully characterized is termed the class A type I/type II scavenger receptor, or SR-AI/II (37Krieger M. Herz J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 37-601Crossref Scopus (1061) Google Scholar). Two forms of the receptor are produced from a single gene through alternative splicing of mRNA (38Freeman M. Ashkenas J. Rees D.J.G. Kingsley D.M. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Krieger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8810-8814Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 39Emi M. Asaoka H. Matsumoto A. Itakura H.

The SR-AI has six structural domains, including a collagen-like domain (V) that mediates ligand binding (40Doi T. Higashino K. Kurihara Y. Wada Y. Miyazaki T. Nakamura H. Uesugi S. Imanishi T. Kawabe Y. Itakura H. Yazaki Y. Matsumoto A. Kodama T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2126-2133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cysteine-rich extracellular domain VI is deleted in the type II receptor, without evident effect on binding of most ligands (41Rohrer L. Freeman M. Kodama T. Penman M. Krieger M. Nature. 1990; 343: 570-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Various negatively charged substances including polyinosinic acid, maleylated albumin, and acetyl LDL can bind to this receptor, suggesting that ligand binding may be mediated principally by ionic interactions (40Doi T. Higashino K. Kurihara Y. Wada Y. Miyazaki T. Nakamura H. Uesugi S. Imanishi T. Kawabe Y. Itakura H. Yazaki Y. Matsumoto A. Kodama T. J. Biol.

A. 1991; 88: 4931-4935Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). It has been shown that a particular conformation of charges is required for receptor binding, because only polynucleotides that are capable of forming base-quartet-stabilized helices act as ligands (43Pearson A.M. Rich A. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3546-3554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several groups have reported evidence of a receptor for oxidatively modified LDL distinct from the SR-AI/II on macrophages (44Sparrow C.P. Parthasarathy S. Steinberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2599-2604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Arai H. Kita T. Yokode M. Narumiya S. Kawai C. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Atherosclerosis. 1993; 101: 25-35Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In several of these studies, the evidence for multiple receptors was the finding that acetyl LDL was able to compete for only about 40% of oxidized LDL uptake (44Sparrow C.P. Parthasarathy S. Steinberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2599-2604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Arai H. Kita T. Yokode M. Narumiya S. Kawai C. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Thromb. 1992; 12: 1079-1087Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More direct evidence for a separate receptor for oxidized LDL was the finding that in rats, intravenously injected oxidized LDL was cleared preferentially by Kupffer cells, whereas acetyl LDL was cleared by sinusoidal endothelial cells (46Van Berkel T.J.C. De Rijke Y.B. Kruijt J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2282-2289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Endemann and co-workers (49Stanton L.W. White R.T. Bryant C.M. Protter A.A. Endemann G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22446-22451Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 50Endemann G. Stanton L.W. Madden K.S. Bryant C.M. White R.T. Protter A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11811-11816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) used a mouse cDNA library and an expression cloning strategy with fluorescently labeled oxidized LDL to identify two cell surface proteins that could mediate the binding and internalization of oxidized LDL but not acetyl LDL. The first was found to be the murine FcγII-B2 receptor, but blocking antibodies to the FcγII-B2 receptor failed to inhibit the uptake of oxidized LDL in mouse peritoneal macrophages; hence, it is unlikely that this receptor contributes significantly to oxidized LDL uptake in these cells (49Stanton L.W. White R.T. Bryant C.M. Protter A.A. Endemann G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22446-22451Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The second protein was shown to be the murine homologue of CD36 (50Endemann G. Stanton L.W. Madden K.S. Bryant C.M. White R.T. Protter A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11811-11816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was found that only a mild degree of oxidation of LDL was required for maximal binding to the murine homologue of CD36, whereas extensive oxidation of LDL is required for receptor-mediated uptake and degradation in mouse peritoneal macrophages (35Steinbrecher U.P. Witztum J.L. Parthasarathy S. Steinberg D. Arteriosclerosis. 1987; 7: 135-143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This is indirect evidence that CD36 does not account for the SR-AI/II-independent uptake of oxidized LDL in murine macrophages. However, in human macrophages, anti-CD36 antibody has been shown to partly inhibit the degradation of oxidized LDL (50Endemann G. Stanton L.W. Madden K.S. Bryant C.M. White R.T. Protter A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11811-11816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 51Nicholson A. Frieda S. Pierce A. Silverstein R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 269-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), and monocyte-macrophages from subjects with inherited deficiency of CD36 were found to have a reduced rate of uptake and degradation of oxidized LDL (52Nozaki S. Kashiwagi H. Yamashita S. Nakagawa T. Kostner B. Tomiyami Y. Nakata A. Ishigami M. Miyagawa J.-I. KamedaTakemura K. Kurata Y. Matsuzawa Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1859-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Hence, it is possible that CD36 is a mediator of oxidized LDL uptake and degradation in human cells. Acton et al. (53Acton S.L. Scherer P.E. Lodish H.F. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21003-21009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) identified a scavenger receptor (termed SR-BI) homologous to CD36 that binds oxidized or acetylated LDL but also native LDL (53Acton S.L. Scherer P.E. Lodish H.F. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21003-21009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It also binds high density lipoprotein, and it has been proposed that one function of SR-BI may be to promote adhesion of high density lipoprotein to cells and facilitate cholesterol ester transfer (54Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K. Xu S. Hobbs H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (2005) Google Scholar). More recently, a 94–97-kDa macrophage plasma membrane protein identified by ligand blotting has been proposed to be a specific receptor for oxidized LDL (55Ottnad E. Parthasarathy S. Sambrano G. Ramprasad M. Quehenberger O. Kondratenko N. Green S. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1391-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 56de Rijke Y.B. van Berkel T.J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 824-827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This protein has been identified as macrosialin, the murine homologue of CD68 (57Ramprasad M.P. Fischer W. Witztum J.L. Sambrano G.R. Quehenberger O. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9580-9584Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Although macrosialin is targeted to lysosomes and only a small percentage of the total appears on the plasma membrane, it is so abundantly expressed in macrophages that a significant number of molecules are detectable on the cell surface (58Ramprasad M. Terpstra V. Kondratenko N. Quehenberger O. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14833-14838Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Antibodies to CD68 partially inhibited the uptake of oxidized LDL by THP-1 cells (58Ramprasad M. Terpstra V. Kondratenko N. Quehenberger O. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14833-14838Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Evaluation of the role of these candidate receptors for oxidized LDL is rendered difficult because of the presence of scavenger receptors in macrophages, because any effect of these postulated “specific” receptors for oxidized LDL is observed against a high background level of uptake via the SR-AI/II. To date, no normal cell type has been identified that expresses oxidized LDL receptors and not SR-AI/II. However, it has been suggested that Kupffer cells may exhibit a relatively high level of “oxidized LDL receptor” activity. Nevertheless, these cells also have scavenger receptors, and the results of competition experiments remain somewhat equivocal. Because of this “interference” by scavenger receptors, identification of specific oxidized LDL receptors would be greatly facilitated in animals where scavenger receptors were absent. Suzuki et al. (59Suzuki H. Kurihara Y. Takeya M. Kataoka, M. Jishage K. Ueda, O. Sakaguchi T. Higashi T. Suzuki T. Takashima, Y. Kawabe Y. Cynshi O. Wada Y. Honda M. Kurihara H. Toi T. Matsumoto A. Azuma A.

Nature in press. 1996; Google Scholar) have recently generated transgenic mice in which the SR-AI/II (msr) gene was inactivated by targeted gene disruption. The homozygous mutants have complete absence of SR-AI/II protein, but their phenotype is virtually normal. The present studies were done to characterize the uptake and degradation of modified lipoproteins by macrophages from these SR-AI/II-deficient animals. Carrier-free 125I and 32P were purchased from Mandel Scientific (Guelph, Ontario, Canada). Gentamicin, α-minimal essential medium, ultra pure agarose, proteinase K, ethidium bromide, BglII, XbaI, 1-kb DNA ladder, and high molecular weight DNA markers were from Canadian Life Technologies (Burlington, Ontario, Canada). Hyclone-defined fetal bovine serum and Stratagene NucTrap probe purification columns were purchased from Professional Diagnostics (Edmonton, Alberta, Canada). Arachidonic acid, linoleic acid, bovine serum albumin,n-octyl β-d-glucopyranoside, phorbol myristate acetate, cholesterol, tetramethoxypropane and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride were obtained from Sigma. Phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylcholine were from Avanti Polar Lipids (Birmingham, AL). Nitrocellulose membrane and prestained SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis standards were purchased from Bio-Rad. Hybond-N hybridization transfer membrane was obtained from Amersham Corp. Kodak X-Omat AR film was from MedTec Marketing (Richmond, British Columbia, Canada). Other reagents were purchased from Fisher Scientific (Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada) or VWR Canlab (Edmonton, Alberta, Canada). The procedure for disruption of the msrgene (which encodes SR-AI/II) has been reported recently (59Suzuki H. Kurihara Y. Takeya M. Kataoka, M. Jishage K. Ueda, O. Sakaguchi T. Higashi T. Suzuki T. Takashima, Y. Kawabe Y. Cynshi O. Wada Y. Honda M. Kurihara H. Toi T. Matsumoto A. Azuma A. Noda T. Toyoda Y. Itakura H. Yazaki Y. Horiuchi S. Takahashi K. Kruijt J.K. van Berkel T.J.C. Steinbrecher U.P. Steinbrecher U.P. Ishibashi S. Maeda N. Gordon S. Kodama T. Kodama T. Nature in press. 1996; Google Scholar). A targeting vector was introduced into exon 4 (the ligand-binding region) of the gene. Brother-sister mating of heterozygotes was carried out to generate homozygous mutants. Normal littermates were bred as controls. To verify that there had been no accidental intermingling of wild-type and homozygous mice during the study, genotyping of selected experimental animals throughout the study as well as of all breeders was performed by Southern blotting using a 600-base pair probe from a region adjacent to exon 4 of the msr gene. Digestion of genomic DNA with BglII generated a single 23-kb band in wild-type mice and a single 10-kb band in homozygous knockout mice. None of the mice showed both the 23-kb band and the 10-kb band characteristic of heterozygotes. LDL (d = 1.019 − 1.063) was isolated by sequential ultracentrifugation of EDTA-anticoagulated fasting plasma obtained from healthy normolipidemic volunteers (60Havel R.J. Eder H.A. Bragdon J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1955; 43: 1345-1353Crossref Scopus (6487) Google Scholar). Radioiodination was performed using a modification of the iodine monochloride method of MacFarlane (61Bilheimer D.W. Eisenberg S. Levy R.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 260: 212-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (1185) Google Scholar). Specific radioactivities were 100–250 cpm/ng. Iodination was performed prior to modification of LDL. The concentration of EDTA in LDL preparations was reduced prior to oxidation by dialysis against Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline containing 10 μmEDTA. Standard conditions for LDL oxidation were: 200 μg/ml LDL in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline containing 5 μmCuSO4 incubated at 37 °C for 20 h (62Steinbrecher U.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3603-3608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This typically resulted in electrophoretic mobility of 0.85 relative to albumin. For some experiments, the extent of oxidation was controlled by varying the incubation time. Mildly oxidized LDL was prepared by incubating for 3.5 h and resulted in electrophoretic mobility 0.45 relative to albumin. Extensively oxidized LDL was prepared by incubating for 30 h and resulted in electrophoretic mobility of 1.06 relative to albumin. Acetylation, malondialdehyde modification, arachidonic acid oxidation product modification or linoleic acid oxidation product modification of LDL, or bovine serum albumin was performed as described previously (63Zhang H. Yang Y. Steinbrecher U.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5535-5542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Resident peritoneal macrophages were obtained from wild-type mice or SR-AI/II knockout mice by peritoneal lavage with ice-cold Ca2+-free Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were suspended in α-minimal essential medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and plated in 12-well plastic culture plates at a density of 1 × 106cells/well. Adherent macrophages were cultured overnight in a humidified CO2 incubator and then washed with serum-free α-minimal essential medium. Modified LDLs with or without competitors were added to the cells in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 2.5 mg/ml lipoprotein-deficient serum to minimize cytotoxicity. For studies with polycytidylic acid, 10 units/ml recombinant ribonuclease inhibitor (Promega Corp.) was added to prevent degradation of this polynucleotide (43Pearson A.M. Rich A. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3546-3554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After 5 h incubation at 37 °C, media were removed and assayed for trichloroacetic acid-soluble noniodide degradation products. Cells were washed twice with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, dissolved in 0.1 nNaOH, scraped from the plates, counted, and assayed for protein content. To obtain phosphatidylserine liposomes, 12 μmol of bovine brain phosphatidylserine, 12 μmol of egg phosphatidylcholine, and 12 μmol of cholesterol were suspended in 1.5 ml of 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Hepes, and 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5. The mixture was passed 10 times though a 0.1-μm polycarbonate membrane using a Lipex mini-extruder. Phosphatidylcholine liposomes were prepared with the same procedure, except that 20 μmol of egg phosphatidylcholine and 10 μmol of cholesterol were used. Resident peritoneal macrophages from 35–40 mice were suspended in cold 5 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.25 m sucrose and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and disrupted by two cycles of nitrogen cavitation at 460 kPa for 30 min. Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The suspension was centrifuged at 10,000 × gfor 15 min, and the resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 120 min at 4 °C. The crude membrane pellet was solubilized in 100 μl of 10 mg/ml octyl glucoside containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 0.1 mm EDTA and assayed for protein content. Typical yields of macrophage membrane protein were 0.3–1 mg. Solubilized membrane was stored at 4 °C and used within 1 day for ligand blotting. Ligand blotting was performed according to Ottnad et al. (55Ottnad E. Parthasarathy S. Sambrano G. Ramprasad M. Quehenberger O. Kondratenko N. Green S. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Recent work suggests that this event is mediated by ceramide via enhanced ceramide synthase activity. Since the generation of ceramide has been directly linked with the activation of the transcription factor, NFκB, this was investigated as a novel target for the action of daunorubicin. Here we describe how treatment of HL-60 promyelocytes and Jurkat T lymphoma cells with daunorubicin results in the activation of the transcription factor NFκB. The effect of daunorubicin was evident following 1–2 h treatment, which was in contrast to the time course of activation obtained with the cytokine, tumor necrosis factor, where NFκB activation was detected within minutes of cellular stimulation. Activated complexes were shown to contain predominantly p50 and p65/RelA subunit components. Daunorubicin also induced IκB degradation and increased the expression of an NFκB-linked reporter gene. In addition, the drug was found to strongly potentiate the ability of tumor necrosis factor to induce an NFκB-linked reporter gene, suggesting a synergy between these two agents in this response. These events were sensitive to the iron chelator, deferoxamine mesylate (desferal), and the anti-oxidant and metal chelator pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate. A structurally related compound, mitoxantrone, which, unlike daunorubicin, is unable to undergo redox cycling in cells, also activated NFκB in a pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate-sensitive manner. A specific inhibitor of ceramide synthase, fumonisin B1, had no effect on daunorubicin induced NFκB activation at a range of concentrations previously reported to block apoptosis induced by this drug. However, this agent could inhibit increases in ceramide induced by daunorubicin, in addition to blocking ceramide synthase activity from HL-60 cells which was activated in response to daunorubicin treatment. These data therefore suggest that the effect of daunorubicin on NFκB is unlikely to involve ceramide, but may involve reactive oxygen species generated as a result of endogenous cellular processes rather than reductive metabolism of the drug. As NFκB may be involved in apoptosis, this effect may be an important aspect of the cellular responses to this agent.

The anthracycline antibiotic, daunorubicin, is widely used in cancer chemotherapy with proven therapeutic benefit in the treatment of a variety of neoplasia (1Calabresi P. Chabner B.A. Gilman A.G. Rall T.W. Nies A.S. Taylor P. Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics. 8th Ed. Pergamon Press, New York1990: 1202-1263Google Scholar). Although its mechanism of anti-tumor action is uncertain, DNA is believed to be a primary target (2Powis G. Powis G. Prough R.A. Metabolism and Action of Anti-cancer Drugs. Taylor and Francis Ltd., London1987: 211-246Google Scholar). Its ability to cause strand scission may be mediated by stabilizing a cleavable complex between DNA and the enzyme, topoisomerase II, and/or oxygen radicals arising from redox cycling following its bioreduction. Additionally, bioreduction products and reactive oxygen species have been associated with anthracycline induced alkylation of cellular macromolecules, DNA intercalation and cross-linking, lipid peroxidation, and cell membrane damage (2Powis G. Powis G. Prough R.A. Metabolism and Action of Anti-cancer Drugs. Taylor and Francis Ltd., London1987: 211-246Google Scholar). Irrespective of the initial insult, anthracyclines, along with a variety of agonists, ultimately activate the event of programmed cell death or apoptosis in cells (3Barry M.A. Behnke C.A. Eastman A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1990; 40: 2353-2362Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). Their ability to induce this pathway may be a mechanism underlying their therapeutic efficacy in certain tumor types. The development of the apoptotic morphology is well defined; however, signaling pathways that may act as primary mediators of apoptosis and growth suppression are poorly characterized (4Steller H. Science. 1995; 267: 1445-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (2429) Google Scholar). Some of those relevant to the cytotoxic action of chemotherapeutic drugs include the triggering of CD95/CD95-L interaction resulting in a type of autocrine suicide (5Friesen C. Herr I. Krammer P.H. Debatin K-M. Nature Med. 1996; 2: 574-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar), and the activation of effector molecules such as interleukin-1 converting enzyme-like proteases (6Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Ottaviano Y. Davidson N.E. Poirier G.G. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3976-3985PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies suggest that the neutral lipid ceramide may also play a role in mediating drug-induced apoptosis (7Bose R. Verheij M. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Scotto K. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R. Cell. 1995; 82: 405-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar, 8Jaffrezou J-P. Levade T. Bettaieb A. Andrieu N. Bezombes C. Maestre N. Vermeersch S. Rousse A. Laurent G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2417-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Ceramide is a putative second messenger which can also be generated following the activation of distinct sphingomyelinase activities in response to a range of extracellular agents including TNF-α, 1The abbreviations used are: TNF, tumor necrosis factor; PDTC, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate; ROS, reactive oxygen species; NFκB, nuclear factor κB; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase. 1The abbreviations used are: TNF, tumor necrosis factor; PDTC, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate; ROS, reactive oxygen species; NFκB, nuclear factor κB; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase.interleukin-1β, γ-interferon, nerve growth factor, Fas ligand, and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (9Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. Trends Biol. Sci. 1995; 20: 73-77Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). A general role in growth arrest and suppression is suggested by its ability to induce cell differentiation, cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis, or cell senescence (9Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. Trends Biol. Sci. 1995; 20: 73-77Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar), although a mitogenic role has been demonstrated in certain cell types (10Boucher L.-M. Wiegmann K. Futterer A Pfeffer K. Mak T.W. Kronke M. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 2059-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In a recent study, daunorubicin was shown to increase ceramide levels in cells following induction of the enzyme ceramide synthase (7Bose R. Verheij M. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Scotto K. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R. Cell. 1995; 82: 405-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). Furthermore, inhibition of this enzyme by the mycotoxin, fumonisin B1, blocked apoptosis induced by daunorubicin. The regulated biosynthesis of ceramide may represent a signaling mechanism by which apoptotic events are induced by this drug. The generation of ceramide following activation of lysosomal acid sphingomyelinase has not only been linked with TNF-induced apoptosis, but also with the activation of NFκB (11Yang Z. Costanzo M. Golde D.W. Kolesnick R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20520-20523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This inducible transcription factor has been implicated in the regulation of many genes which code for mediators of the immune, acute phase, and inflammatory responses (12Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4591) Google Scholar). The DNA-binding protein complex recognizes a discrete nucleotide sequence (5′-GGGACTTTCC-3′) in the upstream regions of a variety of responsive genes. Subunits belonging to the NFκB family comprise five members in mammals: p50, p65 (RelA), c-Rel, p52, and RelB. These proteins share a conserved 300-amino acid sequence in the N-terminal portion, termed the Rel homology domain, which mediates DNA binding, protein dimerization, nuclear localization, and binding of the inhibitor protein IκB (either α or β) (12Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4591) Google Scholar). Various dimer combinations of these proteins have distinct DNA binding specificities and may serve to activate specific sets of genes (13Lin R. Gewert D. Hiscott J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3123-3131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In resting cells, the NFκB dimer is sequestered in the cytosol by associating with IκB, and can be “liberated” from this complex by a variety of inducers. A simple model for NFκB activation is as follows. Phosphorylation of IκB by specific activated protein kinase(s) tags it for proteolytic degradation (14Chen Z.J. Parent L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1996; 84: 853-862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). This facilitates the nuclear translocation of activated NFκB complexes, whereupon binding to cognate sequences, gene expression is activated. The signaling pathways linking receptor stimulation to NFκB activation are poorly defined. A number of kinases have been implicated in the phosphorylation of IκB, the most notable being a recently identified ubiquitination-dependent multisubunit protein kinase (14Chen Z.J. Parent L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1996; 84: 853-862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation at two specific residues, serine 32 and 36, on IκBα, is thought to lead to its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the proteosome, facilitating NFκB release and translocation into the nucleus (15Brown K. Gerstberger S. Carlson L. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U. Science. 1995; 267: 1485-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1314) Google Scholar). Mutants lacking these residues cannot undergo phosphorylation (and subsequent proteolytic degradation) in response to a variety of stimuli (16Traenckner E.B-M. Pahl H.L. Henkel T. Schmidt K.N. Wilk S. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2876-2883Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar) suggesting that many signal transduction pathways converge on the putative IκB kinase(s). In addition to ceramide being implicated as an upstream regulator of IκBα phosphorylation, a model has been proposed whereby reactive oxygen species (ROS) act as second messengers in this event (17Schulze-Osthoff K. Los M. Baeuerle P.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 50: 735-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Evidence to support this model is based on the ability of H2O2 to activate NFκB (18Schreck R. Rieber P. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2247-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (3415) Google Scholar) and the inhibitory effects of antioxidants such as N-acetylcysteine (a thiol antioxidant and glutathione precursor) and pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), which is also a metal chelator, on NFκB activation (18Schreck R. Rieber P. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2247-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (3415) Google Scholar, 19Schreck R. Meier B. Mannel D.N. Droge W. Baeuerle P.A. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1181-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (1448) Google Scholar, 20Schmidt K.N. Amstad P. Cerutti P. Baeuerle P.A. Chem.

The link between ceramide and ROS in signaling either transcriptional activation or apoptotic events is unclear (22Buttke T.M. Sandstrom P.A. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 7-10Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2099) Google Scholar,23Jacobson M.D. Trends Biol. Sci. 1996; 21: 83-86Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). In a model for NFκB proposed by Baeuerle and Henkel (12Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4591) Google Scholar), agonist-stimulated ceramide generation lies upstream of an event which triggers H2O2 production, leading to the activation of this transcription factor. Because previous work demonstrated the production of ROS and ceramide in response to daunorubicin (2Powis G. Powis G. Prough R.A. Metabolism and Action of Anti-cancer Drugs. Taylor and Francis Ltd., London1987: 211-246Google Scholar, 7Bose R. Verheij M. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Scotto K. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R. Cell. 1995; 82: 405-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar), we investigated the effect of this agent on NFκB activation. We have found that daunorubicin signals NFκB activation in HL-60 promyelocytes and Jurkat T cells by a PDTC-sensitive mechanism, suggesting the involvement of ROS, and not activated ceramide synthase. The importance of this signal for daunorubicin-mediated apoptosis is discussed. HL-60 and Jurkat T cells (both obtained from the European Collection of Animal Cell Culture (ECACC, Salisbury, United Kingdom) were grown in suspension culture in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin/streptomycin (100 units/ml and 100 mg/ml, respectively), and l-glutamate (2 mmfinal concentration), all obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. (Paisley, United Kingdom). Recombinant human TNFα was a gift from Zeneca Pharmaceuticals Ltd., Macclesfield, United Kingdom. Mitoxantrone was also a generous gift from Wyeth-Ayerst Research (United Kingdom). Poly(dI·dC) was from Pharmacia Biosystems (Milton Keynes, United Kingdom), T4 polynucleotide kinase and oligonucleotide containing the consensus sequence (5′-GGGACTTTCC-3′), corresponding to the κ-light chain enhancer motif, were purchased from Promega (Southampton, United Kingdom). [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol), [14C]chloramphenicol (56 mCi/mmol), [1-14C]palmitoyl-coenzyme A (55 mCi/mmol), and ECL reagent were from Amersham (Aylesbury, United Kingdom). Diacylglycerol kinase was from Calbiochem (United Kingdom). Rabbit polyclonal antibody preparations to the DNA-binding subunits of NFκB (c-Rel and RelA) and the inhibitor protein IκBα were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. Mutant NFκB oligonucleotide was also from Santa Cruz. An antiserum to the p50 subunit of NFκB was a generous gift from Dr. Jean Imbert (INSERM, Marseille). All other reagents were purchased from Sigma (Poole, Dorset, United Kingdom) unless otherwise stated. For treatments, cells in late log phase of growth were resuspended in fresh medium at a concentration of 1 × 106/ml and incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air. Where required, cells were preincubated with inhibitors (fumonisin B1 and PDTC for 60 min, and desferal for 16 h) prior to the addition of drug (4 h). Following stimulation, incubations were discontinued by the addition of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and either nuclear or whole cell extracts were prepared as described previously (24Mahon T.M. O'Neill L.A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28557-28564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Protein determinations were made using the Bradford assay with bovine albumin as standard. The transactivating potential of activated NFκB complexes was assessed following transfection of cells (25Queen C. Baltimore D. Cell. 1983; 33: 741-748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar) with a plasmid containing five NFκB consensus sequences upstream of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene (pCATTM-Promoter plasmid, a gift from Dr. Tim Bird, Immunex Corp., Seattle, WA). Following treatment (indicated in legends), extracts prepared from harvested cells were assayed for CAT activity as described previously (26Moynagh P.N. Williams D.C. O'Neill L.A.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 343-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Statistical significance was evaluated by employing Student's t test for unpaired data. Nuclear NFκB was assessed by the electrophoretic mobility shift assay using a 22-base pair oligonucleotide containing the human κ-light chain enhancer motif, which had previously been end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP as described (24Mahon T.M. O'Neill L.A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28557-28564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Typically, 4 μg of nuclear extract protein was incubated with radiolabeled oligonucleotide (10,000 cpm) at room temperature for 30 min using conditions as described previously (24Mahon T.M. O'Neill L.A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28557-28564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). NFκB complexes were resolved on 5% acrylamide gels and identified following autoradiography. To identify the subunit components of activated NFκB complexes, supershift analysis was carried out where extracts from treated cells were preincubated with antibody preparations to p50, RelA (p65), and c-Rel subunit components on ice for 30 min prior to the addition of labeled probe. A similar protocol was employed in competition studies (incubations were at room temperature), where mutant and wild type NFκB consensus sequence were assessed for their ability to block binding of activated complexes to labeled wild type NFκB probe. Equal amounts of whole cell lysate protein (as indicated) were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred onto nitrocellulose, and IκBα immunoblot analysis was performed as described previously (24Mahon T.M. O'Neill L.A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28557-28564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Secondary antibody was used at a dilution of 1:400. The blots were developed by ECL according to the manufacturers recommendations. Ceramide was quantified by the diacylglycerol kinase assay as described (7Bose R. Verheij M. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Scotto K. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R. Cell. 1995; 82: 405-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar), with some modifications. In brief, following stimulation, cell pellets were extracted with 600 μl of chloroform, methanol, 1 n HCl (100:100:1, v/v/v). Following alkaline hydrolysis (1 h at 37 °C), re-extracted samples were dried down and redissolved in 50 μl of reaction buffer (7Bose R. Verheij M. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Scotto K. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R. Cell. 1995; 82: 405-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). The reaction was started by the addition of 40 μg/ml (4 milliunits/ml)Escherichia coli diacylglycerol kinase followed closely by 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Reaction termination was as described following incubation at room temperature for 90 min. The level of ceramide was determined by comparison with a standard curve generated with known amounts of ceramide (ceramide type III; Sigma). This activity was measured in HL-60 microsomal membranes as described previously (7Bose R. Verheij M. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Scotto K. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R. Cell. 1995; 82: 405-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). In general, 50 × 106 cells were pelleted following drug treatment and disrupted in 300 μl of homogenization buffer by repeatedly passing through a 26-gauge needle. Microsomal membrane protein (37.5 μg) was incubated in a 250-μl reaction volume/mixture as described (7Bose R. Verheij M. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Scotto K. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R. Cell. 1995; 82: 405-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar) with dihydrosphingosine as substrate. The reaction was started by the addition of 3.6 μm (0.2 μCi) [1-14C]palmitoyl-coenzyme A, the incubation was allowed to proceed for 1 h at 37 °C, and stopped by extraction with an equal volume of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v). The substrate concentrations chosen were based on those reported to allow maximal enzyme activity to be monitored (7Bose R. Verheij M. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Scotto K. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R. Cell. 1995; 82: 405-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar), with 100 μmdihydrosphingosine being optimal. Following TLC as described (7Bose R. Verheij M. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Scotto K. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R. Cell. 1995; 82: 405-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar), radioactivity corresponding to synthesized dihydroceramide was determined using an InstantImagerTM (Packard Instrument Co., Meriden, CT). Treatment of both HL-60 and Jurkat T cells with the anthracycline antibiotic, daunorubicin, resulted in the activation of NFκB, which was dose-dependent and time-responsive (Fig. 1 A, C, andD). Fig. 1 A illustrates data obtained with HL-60 cells, where activation of NFκB is demonstrated by the appearance of DNA-protein complexes. The activation was time-dependent occurring from 1 to 4 h and was sustained up to 24 h (Fig.1 A). This was in contrast to that seen with TNF, where the activation of NFκB was rapid occurring within minutes of cellular stimulation (Fig. 1 B). Concentrations of daunorubicin employed were similar to those previously reported to induce apoptosis in this cell line (7Bose R. Verheij M. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Scotto K. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R. Cell. 1995; 82: 405-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar), with activation being apparent at 0.05 μm, and peaking at 0.5 μm (Fig.1 C). These concentrations also paralleled that reported for ceramide elevation induced by this drug (7Bose R. Verheij M. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Scotto K. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R. Cell. 1995; 82: 405-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). Data for TNF (0.6 and 2.5 ng/ml) are shown in Fig. 1 C for comparison purposes. A less potent induction was observed in Jurkat T cells (Fig. 1 D) where weak activation could be detected at 0.125 μm and a strong signal observed at 2.5 μm daunorubicin. The binding specificity of activated complexes was demonstrated by competition studies in which unlabeled oligonucleotide containing NFκB consensus sequence inhibited the appearance of retarded complexes, whereas a mutant oligonucleotide had no effect at equivalent concentrations (Fig. 2 A). Analysis of specific subunit components in activated NFκB complexes revealed the presence of p50 and to a lesser extent p65/RelA as indicated by enhanced retardation of labeled complexes following gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2 B). Although supershifted complexes were not seen with anti-c-Rel antibodies, a weaker signal when compared with control lanes suggested the presence of this subunit component in the complex (Fig. 2 B, lane 2). HL-60 cells treated with daunorubicin at doses which resulted in NFκB activation were examined for degradation of the inhibitor protein, IκBα, a critical event in the activation of this transcription factor (12Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4591) Google Scholar). A marked degradation of this inhibitor protein was observed which was dose-responsive (Fig. 3). In support of the proposed model for IκBα degradation, a doublet was observed prior to degradation (open arrow), most probably corresponding to the phosphorylated form of this protein, which is a signal for its degradation (15Brown K. Gerstberger S. Carlson L. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U. Science. 1995; 267: 1485-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1314) Google Scholar). At the highest concentrations of daunorubicin employed (2.5 μm), IκBα degradation was complete (Fig. 3, lane 6). Following transfection of Jurkat T cells with a CAT reporter gene construct containing five NFκB sites upstream of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene, the effects of daunorubicin on κB-dependent gene expression were investigated. Daunorubicin induced expression of CAT activity in a dose dependent fashion (Fig. 4 A). At 0.25 μmdaunorubicin, a concentration previously shown to activate NFκB, CAT activity was increased 4-fold over control values (unstimulated cells), indicating that induced complexes were transcriptionally active. In addition, daunorubicin and TNF were found to synergize in this response (Fig. 4 B). Combining a concentration of TNF which was marginally inducing (1.2-fold over control) with a concentration of daunorubicin inducing a 6-fold increase in CAT activity, resulted in a 14-fold induction. This synergy suggests that TNF and daunorubicin activated NFκB by different pathways, as was previously suggested from the different time courses of activation observed for these two agonists (Fig. 1, A and B). We next investigated the mechanism by which daunorubicin activates NFκB. In cells pretreated with the metal chelators desferal and PDTC (which also has anti-oxidant properties), activation was inhibited (Fig. 5 A), as indicated by a diminished signal corresponding to activated complexes. Desferal (1 mm) inhibited the response by 38% with no further inhibition being observed at higher doses (lanes 3–5). PDTC was the more potent inhibitor of the two at equivalent concentrations employed, inhibiting the response by 63% at 1 mm(lane 8). PDTC and desferal were also found to inhibit the daunorubicin-mediated increase in κB-dependent CAT expression (Fig. 5 B). We next determined whether the mechanism of NFκB activation involved redox cycling of daunorubicin. For this purpose, we used a closely related anthraquinone, mitoxantrone, which does not undergo redox cycling (27Fisher G.R. Patterson L.H. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1992; 30: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 28Vile G.F. Winterbourne C.C. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1989; 24: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Mitoxantrone was found to be as potent an activator of NFκB in HL-60 as daunorubicin (Fig.6 A), with an effect being evident from 0.05 μm. In addition, PDTC was found to inhibit this activation, with 1 mm completely blocking the response induced by 1.0 and 0.2 μm mitoxantrone (Fig.6 B). These results suggested that activation of NFκB by daunorubicin involved the generation of ROS via endogenous cellular processes rather than through redox cycling of the drug per se. Finally, we tested the effect of a specific ceramide synthase inhibitor, fumonisin B1, for its ability to block daunorubicin-induced NFκB activation at a range of concentrations previously reported to block apoptosis induced by this drug (7Bose R. Verheij M. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Scotto K. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R. Cell. 1995; 82: 405-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). Fumonisin B1 failed to inhibit NFκB activation at all concentrations tested (Fig. 7 A) and, furthermore, no inhibition of daunorubicin-mediated CAT activation was observed (data not shown). However, treatment of HL-60 cells with daunorubicin (0.5 and 10 μm) for 4 h increased ceramide levels, as shown in Fig. 7 B, with 10 μm causing a 2.7-fold increase over controls. This effect was inhibited by fumonisin B1 (300 μm), with ceramide levels being reduced to that in unstimulated cells. Furthermore, treatment of HL-60 cells with daunorubicin (10 μm) for 4 h was found to increase microsomal ceramide synthase activity more than 2-fold over controls. 300 μm fumonisin B1 inhibited this activity, reducing it to below control levels, which was consistent with its ability to act as a competitive inhibitor toward dihydrosphingosine (Fig. 7 B). This confirmed a previous report where induction of ceramide synthase was found to mediate increases in ceramide levels in cells in response to daunorubicin (7Bose R. Verheij M. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Scotto K. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R. Cell. 1995; 82: 405-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). However, our data indicated that this process was not involved in NFκB activation here. We therefore concluded that increases in ROS, generated by endogenous cellular processes, but not ceramide synthase induction, were mediating the effect of daunorubicin on NFκB activation and κB-driven gene expression. In this study, we present the report that daunorubici"
https://openalex.org/W2014147079,"In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the nucleolar immunophilin, Fpr3, is phosphorylated at tyrosine and dephosphorylated by the phosphotyrosine-specific phosphoprotein phosphatase, Ptp1. In Ptp1-deficient cells, Fpr3 contains phospho-Tyr at a single site (Tyr184), but also contains phospho-Ser and phospho-Thr. Ser186 (adjacent to Tyr184) is situated within a canonical site for phosphorylation by casein kinase II (CKII). Yeast cell lysates contain an activity that binds to Fpr3 in vitro and phosphorylates Fpr3 at Ser, Thr, and Tyr; this activity was found to be dependent on expression of functional yeast CKII. Moreover, purified Fpr3 was phosphorylated on Tyr184 in vitro by either purified yeast CKII or purified, bacterially-expressed human CKII. Likewise, phosphorylation of Fpr3 at tyrosine in vivo was markedly enhanced in yeast cells overexpressing a heterologous (Drosophila) CKII, but was undetectable in yeast cells carrying only a temperature-sensitive allele of the endogenous CKII, even when the cells were grown at a permissive temperature. Phosphorylation of Fpr3 at Tyr184 by CKII in vitro lagged behind phosphorylation of Fpr3 at Ser, and was accelerated by pre-phosphorylation of Fpr3 at Ser using CKII. Furthermore, synthetic peptides corresponding to the sequence surrounding Tyr184 that contained P-Ser (or Glu) at position 186 were much more efficient substrates for CKII phosphorylation of Tyr184 than a synthetic peptide containing Ala at position 186. These findings indicate that CKII phosphorylates Fpr3 at tyrosine and serine both in vivo andin vitro and thus possesses dual specificity. These results also indicate that Tyr184 is phosphorylated by CKII via a two-step process, in which phosphorylation at the +2 position provides a negatively-charged specificity determinant that allows subsequent phosphorylation of Tyr184.

Protein kinases with dual specificity are able to phosphorylate either themselves and/or their target substrates at tyrosine and at serine or threonine (1Lindberg R.A. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Trends Biochem. 1992; 17: 114-119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). A number of protein kinases with dual specificity have been identified in budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and in fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe). These enzymes are likely to be responsible for all of the protein-bound phosphotyrosine found in these organisms, since no tyrosine-specific protein kinases have yet been detected in either yeast. Examples of such protein kinases in S. cerevisiae include: the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)2 homologs Ste7 (2Errede B. Levin D.E. Curr. Opin.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 395-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). With one exception, all of the known phosphotyrosine-containing proteins in S. cerevisiae are themselves protein kinases, for example, the cell cycle kinase Cdc28 (8Sorger P.K. Murray A.W. Nature. 1992; 355: 365-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) and the mitogen-activated protein kinases, Kss1 (9Ma D. Cook J.G. Thorner J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 889-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and Fus3 (10Gartner A. Nasmyth K. Ammerer G. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1280-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The exception is Fpr3, which is an abundant nucleolar protein that is a member of the FK506-binding subfamily of immunophilins with an as yet unknown physiological function (11Benton B. Zang J.-H. Thorner J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 623-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that phosphotyrosyl-Fpr3 is a cellular substrate of the S. cerevisiae protein-tyrosine phosphatase, Ptp1. This phosphatase directly dephosphorylates phosphotyrosyl-Fpr3 in vitro, and prevents accumulation of phosphotyrosyl-Fpr3 in vivo(12Wilson L.K. Benton B.M. Zhou S. Thorner J. Martin G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25185-25193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The phospho-Tyr that appears in Fpr3 in Ptp1-deficient cells is unlikely to result from autophosphorylation, because Fpr3 lacks homology to any known protein kinase and does not display detectable protein kinase activity in vitro. Hence, we sought to identify the protein kinase responsible for phosphorylating Fpr3 at Tyr. The COOH-terminal third of Fpr3 comprises its FK506-binding and peptidyl-prolyl-cis,trans-isomerase domain, whereas the NH2-terminal two-thirds of Fpr3 has homology to other nucleolar proteins, like nucleolin, and is responsible for localization of Fpr3 to the nucleolus (11Benton B. Zang J.-H. Thorner J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 623-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The NH2-terminal segment is phosphorylated at Ser, Thr, and Tyr, and in this region many of the potential phosphoacceptor residues are flanked by acidic residues. This arrangement suggested that Fpr3 might be a substrate for casein kinase II (CKII), 2The abbreviations used are: MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase; CKII, casein kinase II; CKI, casein kinase I; yCKII, yeast CKII; hCKII, human CKII; dCKII,Drosophila CKII; GST, glutathione S-transferase; Ptp1, protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. because this enzyme has a requirement for acidic substrates (13Tuazon T.P. Traugh J.A. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1991; 23: 123-165PubMed Google Scholar) and because it is also localized to the nucleolus (14Pfaff M. Anderer F.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 969: 100-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we previously demonstrated that the exclusive site of tyrosine phosphorylation within Fpr3 is Tyr184 (underlined), which also resides in a highly acidic sequence (DEDEDADIYDSEDYDLT) within the NH2-terminal domain (12Wilson L.K. Benton B.M. Zhou S. Thorner J. Martin G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25185-25193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This observation raised the further possibility that phosphorylation of Fpr3 at Tyr might be catalyzed by CKII. CKII is a well characterized, Ser/Thr-directed protein kinase with a broad range of reported substrates in vivo and with multiple roles in signal transduction (15Allende J.W. Allende C.C. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 16Litchfield D.W. Luscher B. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 127/128: 187-199Crossref Scopus (162) Google Scholar). CKII is composed of catalytic (α and/or α′) and regulatory (β and/or β′) subunits, associated as either an α2β2 or an αα′ββ′ tetramer. In S. cerevisiae, the α and α′ subunits of CKII are encoded by the CKA1 and CKA2 genes, respectively (17Padmanabha R. Chen-Wu J.L.-P. Hanna D.E. Glover C.V.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4089-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Disruption of either gene still permits cell growth, whereas disruption of both genes is lethal. Yeast mutants which produce temperature-sensitive CKII undergo growth arrest within the time of about one cell cycle after shift to restrictive temperature (18Hanna D.E. Rethinaswamy A. Glover C.V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25905-25914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Half of the arrested cells are unbudded, and the other half have large buds, suggesting that CKII activity is required for progression through both G1 and G2/M. Examination of natural protein substrates, and systematic studies using synthetic peptide substrates, indicate that the consensus sequence for CKII phosphorylation is Ser/Thr-X-X-Neg (where Neg indicates a negatively-charged residue or a residue carrying a negatively-charged modification), although acidic residues at positions spanning from −2 to +7 can act as positive specificity determinants for CKII, and an acidic residue at position +3 is not an absolute requirement (19Meggio F. Marin O. Pinna L.A. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1994; 40: 401-409PubMed Google Scholar). The order of efficacy of negatively-charged specificity determinants at the +3 position is thought to be: P-Tyr > P-Ser > Glu > P-Thr. Thus, phosphorylated Tyr and phosphorylated Ser surpass Glu, providing biochemical support for the possibility that CKII may participate in ordered multisite phosphorylation (20Meggio F. Perich J.W. Reynolds E.C. Pinna L.A. FEBS Lett. 1991; 279: 307-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that phosphorylation of Fpr3 at Tyr, as well as at Ser and Thr, is dependent on CKII activity in vivo. Furthermore, we present evidence that CKII phosphorylates Tyr184 in vitro by a two-step mechanism involving prior phosphorylation of the Ser residue in the +2 position. These results indicate that CKII is not exclusively a Ser/Thr-directed protein kinase, but rather has dual specificity. Moreover, our results indicate that CKII has the previously unrecognized capacity to use P-Ser as a specificity determinant to permit subsequent phosphorylation of a nearby Tyr. Standard methods were used for growth and transformation of yeast (21Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Seidman, J. G., Smith, J. A., Struhl, K., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, 1994, Wiley-Interscience, New York.Google Scholar). Strains YDH6 and YDH8 (generous gift of C. Glover, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Georgia, Athens, GA) harbor disruptions of both CKA1 andCKA2; in strain YDH6, the CKII deficiency is complemented by a wild-type copy of CKA2, whereas in strain YDH8 the deficiency is complemented by a temperature-sensitive allele (cka2-8) carried on a CEN plasmid (18Hanna D.E. Rethinaswamy A. Glover C.V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25905-25914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). To generate strains YDH6200 and YDH8200, the PTP1 gene in strains YDH6 and YDH8 was disrupted by homologous recombination using a 1.25-kilobase pair PvuII-AseI fragment from the plasmid pGEM-ptp1::URA3 (12Wilson L.K. Benton B.M. Zhou S. Thorner J. Martin G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25185-25193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To overexpress Drosophila CKII in yeast, the PTP1strain PJ55–16A and the otherwise isogenic ptp1Δ strain PJ55–16C (12Wilson L.K. Benton B.M. Zhou S. Thorner J. Martin G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25185-25193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) were transformed with the CEN plasmid pDH5 (a generous gift of C. Glover), which contains cDNAs encoding the α and β subunits of Drosophila CKII, each expressed divergently under control of the dual GAL1/10 promoter (17Padmanabha R. Chen-Wu J.L.-P. Hanna D.E. Glover C.V.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4089-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Residues 20–290 from the noncatalytic NH2-terminal region of Fpr3 (Fpr3N) were fused in-frame to the COOH terminus of glutathione S-transferase (GST) yielding GST-Fpr3N. GST-Fpr3N(Y184F) is an otherwise identical fusion protein in which the tyrosine phosphoacceptor site was mutated to Phe. The GST fusions were expressed in bacteria and purified as described previously (12Wilson L.K. Benton B.M. Zhou S. Thorner J. Martin G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25185-25193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). GST-Fpr3N (bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads, Pharmacia) or soluble Fpr3N (generated by thrombin cleavage of GST-Fpr3N), were used as kinase substrates. Purified S. cerevisiae CKII α′αβ′β heterotetramer (yCKII) (generous gift of C. Glover), was purified to greater than 95% homogeneity by a procedure described elsewhere (22Bidwai A.P. Reed J.C. Glover C.V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 309: 348-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Human CKII α2β2 tetramer (hCKII), purified fromEscherichia coli expressing both α and β subunits, was purchased from New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA. Unless otherwise noted, phosphorylation reactions were carried out in reaction mixtures (20 μl final volume) containing 1 μg of Fpr3 substrate, 30 ng of CKII, 200 μm ATP, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 50 mm KCl, and 10 mm MgCl2. In some reactions, [γ32-P]ATP was included at the specific activities indicated in the figure legends. Reactions were carried out at 30 °C for the times indicated, and terminated by addition of one-tenth volume of 0.5 m EDTA. Reaction products were resolved by SDS-PAGE. When yeast lysates were used as the source of protein kinase, reactions were carried out as described previously (12Wilson L.K. Benton B.M. Zhou S. Thorner J. Martin G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25185-25193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Briefly, YDH6 or YDH8 cells were broken by glass bead lysis, and the lysates were clarified by centrifugation. Glutathione-Sepharose beads bearing GST-Fpr3N were incubated with the lysates at 30 °C, then rinsed briefly and incubated in the same buffer used for CKII reactions containing either 100 μm non-radiolabeled ATP or 100 μm[γ-32P]ATP (specific activity 5 Ci/mmol), as indicated in the figure legends. To generate GST-Fpr3N phosphorylated at serine and threonine, but not at tyrosine, GST-Fpr3N bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads was incubated with CKII and unlabeled ATP for 1 h as described above. The beads were washed 3 times with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm EDTA, resuspended in the same solution and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C with 50 μg/ml bacterially-expressed ScPtp1 (which was prepared as described previously (12Wilson L.K. Benton B.M. Zhou S. Thorner J. Martin G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25185-25193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar)). The beads were then washed 3 times in kinase reaction buffer containing 100 μm Na3V04prior to their use in CKII reactions (see Fig. 5 B). Peptides were synthesized by D. King (HHMI, University of California, Berkeley, CA) using Fmoc chemistry on an automated ABI synthesizer (Model 431-A, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The composition of the peptides was assessed by electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy, and purity was always greater than 95%. Peptides corresponding to residues 178–191 of Fpr3 (DEDADIYDSEDYDL) were prepared, in which phosphoserine, glutamic acid, or alanine were substituted for Ser186 (underlined). Peptide phosphorylation reactions (45 μl final volume) contained 1 mg/ml peptide, 1.5 μg/ml human CKII, 100 μm[γ32-P]ATP (5 Ci/mmol), 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 50 mm KCl, and 10 mm MgCl2. Samples (5 μl) were removed at intervals and mixed with 2 μl of 0.5m EDTA to terminate the reaction. Reaction products were analyzed by spotting 3 μl of each sample onto 2-cm squares of DEAE-cellulose paper (NA45, Schleicher & Schuell, Keene, NH) and washing the paper 4 times for 5 min each in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl. The papers were then rinsed in acetone and dried and the amount of radiolabel incorporated determined by counting in a liquid scintillation spectrometer. Strains YDH6200 and YDH8200 were grown to stationary phase (A 600 nm = 4) and lysed by vigorous agitation with glass beads as described previously (11Benton B. Zang J.-H. Thorner J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 623-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) in lysis buffer (100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 12 μm benzamidine, 5 μmphenanthroline, 30 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μm Na3V04, and 0.5 μg/ml of each of the following protease inhibitors: antipain, leupeptin, chymostatin, aprotinin, and pepstatin). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation for 15 min at 10,000 × g, and the resulting supernatant fractions were centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 40 min. Proteins were eluted from the pellet by stirring the resuspended particulate material for 1 h at 4 °C in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer containing a final concentration of 1m NaCl. Insoluble particulate matter was removed from the suspension by centrifugation at 100,000 × g. The resulting supernatant extract was diluted 6-fold in lysis buffer and incubated at 4 °C for 16 h with agarose beads to which had been coupled immunoglobulin from rabbits immunized against the amino terminus of Fpr3 (11Benton B. Zang J.-H. Thorner J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 623-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The beads were then washed 4 times in lysis buffer and solubilized by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblot analysis as described below. Protein kinase reaction mixtures, samples of yeast lysates (100 μg), or solubilized immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblotting as described previously (12Wilson L.K. Benton B.M. Zhou S. Thorner J. Martin G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25185-25193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The following antibodies (1 μg of protein/ml) were used as probes: anti-phosphotyrosine mAb 4G10 (23Drucker B.J. Mamon H.J. Roberts T.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1989; 321: 1383-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), immunoglobulin from rabbits immunized against the amino terminus of Fpr3 (11Benton B. Zang J.-H. Thorner J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 623-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), or serum raised against Drosophila CKII holoenzyme (24Dahmus G.K. Glover C.V.C. Brutlag D.L. Dahmus C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9001-9006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (generous gift of C. Glover). Phosphoamino acid analyses were carried out as described previously (25Boyle W.J. Geer P.V.D. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). Briefly, proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon P, Millipore). Following autoradiography, the bands corresponding to phosphorylated Fpr3N were excised and subjected to partial acid hydrolysis. After addition of P-Tyr, P-Thr, and P-Ser, which served as both carriers and internal standards, the dried samples were resolved electrophoretically on thin-layer cellulose plates (Merck) at pH 1.9 in the first dimension and at pH 3.7 in the second dimension. Radiolabeled phosphoamino acids detected by autoradiography and unlabeled phosphoamino acids were detected by staining with ninhydrin. We have shown previously that yeast lysates contain an activity capable of binding to Fpr3 and of phosphorylating it in vitro at Ser, Thr, and Tyr (12Wilson L.K. Benton B.M. Zhou S. Thorner J. Martin G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25185-25193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The resulting relative phosphoamino acid content is similar to that found in Fpr3 phosphorylated in vivo (phosphoserine, 85%; phosphothreonine, 11%; and phosphotyrosine, 4%) (12Wilson L.K. Benton B.M. Zhou S. Thorner J. Martin G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25185-25193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To determine whether CKII is required for this phosphorylation, strain YDH6, acka1Δ cka2Δ strain in which the CKII deficiency is complemented by wild-type CKA2, and strain YDH8, an isogenic strain in which the CKII deficiency is complemented by a temperature-sensitive allele (cka2–8) (18Hanna D.E. Rethinaswamy A. Glover C.V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25905-25914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), were grown at the permissive temperature (25 °C), and cell lysates were prepared. These lysates were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads loaded with GST-Fpr3N, a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing the NH2-terminal portion of Fpr3 (see “Experimental Procedures”). The beads were washed and incubated at 30 °C in a reaction buffer containing [γ32-P]ATP, and the reaction products analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Lysate from cells expressing wild-type CKA2 mediated efficient phosphorylation of GST-FprN (Fig. 1 A, Lane 1), whereas lysate from cells expressing thecka2–8 temperature-sensitive mutant did not (Fig. 1 A, Lane 2). These results indicate that the activity in yeast lysates that phosphorylates Fpr3 at serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues is CKII-dependent. YDH8 cells exhibit phenotypic changes characteristic of CKII depletion even at the permissive temperature and fail to grow at temperatures above 33 °C (18Hanna D.E. Rethinaswamy A. Glover C.V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25905-25914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Thus, the inability of lysates of YDH8 cells grown at the permissive temperature to phosphorylate Fpr3 probably reflects inactivation of the mutant CKII during incubation at 30 °C in vitro. To examine the effect of CKII deficiency on phosphorylation of Fpr3 at tyrosine, kinase reactions similar to those described above were carried out using non-radioactive ATP, and the reaction products were examined by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Fig. 1 B). Incubation of GST-Fpr3N with a lysate of YDH6 cells resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of GST-Fpr3N in the subsequent kinase reaction (Fig. 1 B, Lane 1), whereas incubation with a lysate of the CKII-deficient YDH8 cells (Fig.1 B, Lane 2) or with buffer alone (Fig. 1 B, Lane 4) did not. In addition, tyrosine phosphorylation was not detected when the Y184F mutant of GST-Fpr3N (GST-Fpr3NY184F) was used as kinase substrate with the active lysate from YDH6 cells (Fig. 1 B, Lane 3). Therefore, the kinase responsible for the tyrosine phosphorylation of Fpr3 in yeast lysates requires both the function of CKII and the integrity of the Tyr site in Fpr3 that is known to be phosphorylated in vivo. To enhance detection of phosphotyrosine in Fpr3 in vivo, derivatives of YDH6 and YDH8 lacking the PTP1gene were generated by gene disruption as described previously (12Wilson L.K. Benton B.M. Zhou S. Thorner J. Martin G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25185-25193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The resulting strains, YDH6200 and YDH8200, were grown to mid-exponential phase at the permissive temperature (25 °C). Cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Fpr3 antibody. Both lysates and immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and the phosphotyrosyl proteins present were examined by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Phosphotyrosyl-Fpr3 was detected in the lysate of YDH6200 cells (Fig. 2 A, Lane 1), but not in the lysate of YDH8200 (Fig. 2 A, Lane 2), even though immunoblot analysis of the same lysates using anti-Fpr3 antibody demonstrated that the total amount of Fpr3 protein was essentially the same in both extracts (Fig. 2 A, Lanes 3 and 4). Likewise, Fpr3 immunoprecipitated from YDH6200 was phosphorylated at tyrosine, while Fpr3 immunoprecipitated from YDH8200 was not (Fig.2 B). These results indicate that, as in vitro, tyrosine phosphorylation of Fpr3 in vivo is also CKII-dependent. It is interesting to note that an unidentified protein (∼50 kDa) also appeared to be phosphorylated at tyrosine in a CKII-dependent manner (Fig. 2, Lane 1); this protein did not appear to be derived from Fpr3 because it did not react with anti-Fpr3 antibody. In contrast to budding yeast CKII (an αα′ββ′ heterotetramer encoded by four separate genes), Drosophila CKII (dCKII) is an ααββ tetramer and is encoded by only two genes, facilitating ectopic expression; moreover expression of dCKII can complement yeast cells lacking endogenous CKII (17Padmanabha R. Chen-Wu J.L.-P. Hanna D.E. Glover C.V.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4089-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). To determine if high-level expression of dCKII could affect the extent of tyrosine phosphorylation in Fpr3, a plasmid encoding the α and β subunits of dCKII under dual control of the divergent GAL1/10 promotor was introduced into ptp1 and PTP1 strains. The resulting strains were grown in either galactose medium to induce expression of dCKII, or in glucose medium to repress dCKII expression. Gal-dependent production of dCKII was verified by immunoblot analysis of cell lysates with an antibody specific for dCKII (Fig. 3, lower panel). Immunoblot analysis using anti-Fpr3 antibodies indicated that the abundance of Fpr3 was not affected by expression of dCKII (data not shown). However, expression of dCKII resulted in enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of Fpr3 in theptp1 strain as detected by an increase in the signal obtained with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Fig. 3, upper panel, Lane 2). This increase was not observed in thePTP1 strain (Fig. 3, upper panel, Lane 3), indicating that the endogenous level of Ptp1 was sufficient to block the hyperphosphorylation of Fpr3 that resulted from dCKII expression. The results described above suggest that CKII either directly phosphorylates Fpr3, or activates some other protein kinase which in turn phosphorylates Fpr3 at tyrosine. To determine whether CKII can directly phosphorylate Fpr3 at Tyr184, CKII heterotetramer purified to greater than 95% from S. cerevisiae (yCKII) was incubated with [γ-32P]ATP and, as substrate, either GST-Fpr3N or GST-Fpr3N(Y184F). The reaction products were resolved by SDS-PAGE and the phosphorylated fusion proteins were excised and subjected to phosphoamino acid analysis. yCKII phosphorylated Fpr3 at serine, threonine, and tyrosine (Fig.4 A, Box 1); the Fpr3 phosphorylated in vitro had a phosphoamino acid composition similar to that of Fpr3 phosphorylated in vivo (12Wilson L.K. Benton B.M. Zhou S. Thorner J. Martin G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25185-25193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). GST-Fpr3N(Y418F) was not phosphorylated at tyrosine, confirming that Tyr184 is the site of tyrosine phosphorylation (Panel A, Box 2). In further support of the conclusion that CKII itself, and not a contaminating kinase, was responsible for the tyrosine phosphorylation of Fpr3N, we found that human CKII (hCKII), expressed and purified fromE. coli, also phosphorylated Fpr3 at Tyr184: phosphotyrosine was detected both by phosphoamino acid analysis of radiolabeled Fpr3N (Fig. 4, Panel A, Box 3) and by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting of Fpr3N phosphorylated by hCKII in the presence of non-radiolabeled ATP (Fig. 4, Panel B). Autophosphorylation of CKII at Tyr was not detected. Because E. coli lacks detectable protein-tyrosine kinase activity (26Wang J.Y.J. Baltimore D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 64-71Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Foster R.S. Thorner J. Martin G.S. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 272-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), these results provide strong evidence that CKII can directly phosphorylate Fpr3 at Tyr184 and hence that CKII is a protein kinase with dual specificity. To explore the mechanism of Tyr184 phosphorylation by CKII, we examined the kinetics of serine, threonine, and tyrosine phosphorylation of Fpr3 in vitro. hCKII was incubated with Fpr3N and [γ-32P]ATP, and the phosphoamino acid composition of Fpr3N was determined at various times during the reaction. Tyrosine phosphorylation occurred at a slower rate than either Ser or Thr phosphorylation and appeared biphasic (Fig.5 A). Tyrosine phosphorylation of Fpr3N reached a stoichiometry of 0.2 mol"
https://openalex.org/W1983853999,"Rab7 has been shown to localize to late endosomes and to mediate transport from early to late endosome/lysosome in mammalian cells and in yeast. We developed a novel assay to quantify transport from early to late endosomes using the Xenopusoocyte. Oocytes were pulsed with avidin after which the oocytes were incubated to allow avidin transport to a late compartment. The oocytes were then allowed to internalize biotin-horseradish peroxidase (HRP). The oocytes were then injected with test proteins and incubated further to allow transport of biotin-HRP from early endosomes to late endosomal/lysosomal compartments. Transport was quantified by assessing the formation of HRP-biotin-avidin complexes. Injection of Rab7:wild-type (WT) and Rab7:Q67L, a GTPase defective mutant, stimulated transport. Rab5:WT had no effect. Rab7:WT-stimulated transport was inhibited by nocodazole, suggesting a role for intact microtubules. Wortmannin, a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor, blocked Rab7:WT-stimulated transport, but Rab7:Q67L-stimulated transport was unaffected by the drug. Rab7:Q67L is constitutively activated and may not require phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity for activation. Rab7-stimulated transport requiresN-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) activity as transport was blocked by N-ethylmaleimide and ATPase defective NSF mutants. Our results indicate that sequentially acting endocytic Rab GTPases utilize similar factors although their modes of action may be different. Rab7 has been shown to localize to late endosomes and to mediate transport from early to late endosome/lysosome in mammalian cells and in yeast. We developed a novel assay to quantify transport from early to late endosomes using the Xenopusoocyte. Oocytes were pulsed with avidin after which the oocytes were incubated to allow avidin transport to a late compartment. The oocytes were then allowed to internalize biotin-horseradish peroxidase (HRP). The oocytes were then injected with test proteins and incubated further to allow transport of biotin-HRP from early endosomes to late endosomal/lysosomal compartments. Transport was quantified by assessing the formation of HRP-biotin-avidin complexes. Injection of Rab7:wild-type (WT) and Rab7:Q67L, a GTPase defective mutant, stimulated transport. Rab5:WT had no effect. Rab7:WT-stimulated transport was inhibited by nocodazole, suggesting a role for intact microtubules. Wortmannin, a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor, blocked Rab7:WT-stimulated transport, but Rab7:Q67L-stimulated transport was unaffected by the drug. Rab7:Q67L is constitutively activated and may not require phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity for activation. Rab7-stimulated transport requiresN-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) activity as transport was blocked by N-ethylmaleimide and ATPase defective NSF mutants. Our results indicate that sequentially acting endocytic Rab GTPases utilize similar factors although their modes of action may be different. Endocytosis occurs in all eukaryotic cells and is essential for the uptake of nutrients, the turnover of membranes proteins (1Trowbridge I.S. Collawn J.F. Hopkins C.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 129-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar) and, in some cells such as oocytes, the formation of yolk platelets (2Opresko L. Karpf R.A. Cell. 1987; 51: 557-568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). After internalization, endocytosed solute and receptor-bound proteins are delivered to a common early endosomal compartment where they are sorted and targeted to other intracellular destinations, including a putative recycling compartment, a trans Golgi network pathway and diversion to a lysosomal degradative/storage compartment (3Gruenberg J. Maxfield F. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 552-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Currently, there is only a rudimentary understanding of the mechanisms that mediate endosomal sorting and transport. Nevertheless, much progress has been made toward a general understanding of vesicular transport. Vesicles containing cargo bud from donor compartments and deliver their contents to acceptor compartments by fusion with the latter. The processes of vesicle budding, docking, and fusion are regulated by a series of generic and compartment-specific proteins (4Pfeffer S.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 522-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 5Rothman J.E. Nature ( Lond .). 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (2001) Google Scholar). Sorting and transport at the level of endosomes may involve budding or tubule formation, or both. Ras-related Rab GTPases regulate intracellular trafficking during endocytosis and secretion (6Bucci C. Parton R.G. Mather I.H. Stunnenberg H. Simons K. Hoflack B. Zerial M.

Rab proteins are specifically localized to the cytoplasmic surface of specific intracellular compartments where they regulate the individual steps of vesicular transport by controlling vesicle docking and fusion (11Chavrier P.

A number of Rab proteins have been localized to the early endocytic pathway including Rab4, Rab5, Rab11, Rab18, and Rab20, suggesting that the endocytic compartment is highly complex with multiple functions (6Bucci C.

Morphologically, the endosomal compartment is thought to be comprised of at least two functionally distinct sub-compartments (3Gruenberg J. Maxfield F. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 552-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar,17Ghosh R.N. Gelman D.L. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell. Sci. 1994; 107: 2177-2189Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Internalized receptor and ligand first enter the peripheral sorting endosome where membrane proteins destined for degradation or the trans Golgi network are sorted away from membrane proteins targeted for recycling back to plasma membrane. A substantial body of evidence indicates that Rab5 regulates transport from the plasma membrane to the early endosome (6Bucci C. Parton R.G. Mather I.H. Stunnenberg H. Simons K. Hoflack B. Zerial M.

Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 613-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Rab4 appears to control the recycling from early endosomes to plasma membrane (14van der Sluijs Hull P.M. Zahraoui A.

Zerial M. Parton R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 913-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar). Rab7 and Rab9 are associated with the late endosomal compartment (11Chavrier P. Parton R.G.

Rab7 and Rab9 have been shown to regulate the traffic from early endosomes to late endosomes (20Feng Y. Press B. Wandinger-Ness A. J.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 677-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar), respectively. Deletion of the YPT7 gene, the yeast homologue of Rab7, leads to fragmentation of the vacuole and to a delay in the processing of vacuolar proteins (24Wichmann H. Hengst L. Gallwitz D. Cell. 1992; 71: 1131-1142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Ypt7 has been shown to regulate transport between late endosome and vacuole (25Schimmoller F. Riezman H. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 823-830Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, Ypt7 is also involved in the homotypic fusion between vacuoles in yeast (26Hass A. Scheglmann D. Lazar T. Gallwitz D. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5258-5270Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Among the endocytic Rabs, Rab5 has been most extensively studied. Rab5 is active in the GTP form and does not require GTP hydrolysis for mediating docking and fusion (9Li G. Barbieri A. Colombo M.I. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14631-14635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Stenmark H. Parton R.G. Steele-Mortimer O. Lutcke A. Gruenberg J. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1287-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). Rab5 is regulated by multiple factors including phosphatidylinositol (PI)-3-kinase 1The abbreviations used are: PI, phosphatidylinositol; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; NSF, NEM-sensitive factor; WT, wildtype; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin. 1The abbreviations used are: PI, phosphatidylinositol; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; NSF, NEM-sensitive factor; WT, wildtype; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin. (28Li G. D'Souza-Schorey C. Barbieri M.A. Roberts R.L. Klippel A. Williams L.T. Stahl P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10207-10211Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) and other signal transducing elements including RAS (29Li, G., D'Souza-Schorey, C., Barbieri, M. A., Cooper, J. A., and Stahl, P. D. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. , 272, in press.Google Scholar). Rab5 also requires NSF for function (30Mukhopadhyay, A., Barbieri, A. M., Funato, K., Roberts, R., and Stahl, P. D. (1997) J. Cell. Biol. , 272, in press.Google Scholar). However, the exact relationship among all these factors in the overall mechanism of intracellular trafficking during endocytosis is largely unknown. Recently, we have shown that both Rab5 and Rab7 stimulate HRP uptake in oocytes and that Rab7 functions downstream of Rab5 (30Mukhopadhyay, A., Barbieri, A. M., Funato, K., Roberts, R., and Stahl, P. D. (1997) J. Cell. Biol. , 272, in press.Google Scholar). Moreover, Rab7 stimulates the inactivation/degradation of preloaded HRP in oocytes by enhancing transport to a late endocytic compartment. To further characterize Rab7-mediated transport, we developed a ligand mixing assay to measure transport from early to late endosome/lysosome compartments. The results demonstrate that Rab7 stimulates transport to the late compartment and that Rab7-stimulated transport is NSF-, microtubule-, and PI-3-kinase-dependent. Recombinant NSF wild type and mutant proteins were generously provided by Sidney W. Whiteheart (University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY). Adult female Xenopus laevis were purchased from Nasco, Fort Atkinson, WI. Avidin and biotin-HRP were obtained from Pierce (Rockford, IL). All other reagents were from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). The fusion proteins used in this study, including Rab5:Q79L, Rab5:S34N, Rab7:WT, Rab7:Q67L, and Rab7:T22N, were described previously (8Li G. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24475-24480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Li G. Barbieri A. Colombo M.I. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14631-14635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant proteins were expressed as glutathioneS-transferase fusion proteins in Escherichia colistrain JM 101. GST fusion proteins were affinity purified with glutathione-Sepharose. Ovaries were dissected from adult female X. laevis anesthetized with 3-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester (1 g/liter) in ice water, and oocytes were prepared as described (30Mukhopadhyay, A., Barbieri, A. M., Funato, K., Roberts, R., and Stahl, P. D. (1997) J. Cell. Biol. , 272, in press.Google Scholar). Oocytes were injected with test molecules in 50 nl of PBS and then allowed to recover in modified Barth's saline at 18 °C for 2 h. Healthy oocytes were then selected for HRP uptake. The injected oocytes were incubated with HRP (2 mg/ml) for 2 h at 18 °C. HRP uptake was stopped by washing the cells 3 times with modified Barth's saline containing 5% BSA. Individual oocytes were then lysed in 200 μl of PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and centrifuged. The lysate was assayed for HRP in 96-well plates (Costar Corp.) usingo-phenylenediamine as the chromogenic substrate (31Wolters G. Kuijpers L. Kacaki J. Schuurs A. J. Clin. Pathol. (Lond.). 1976; 29: 873-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The products were quantified at A 490 nm in a Bio-Rad microplate reader. Results were expressed as nanograms of HRP uptake per oocyte. To monitor the Rab7-mediated transport to the late endosome/prelysosome compartment, oocytes were incubated with avidin (2 mg/ml) for 5 h at 18 °C. The oocytes were then washed and incubated for 16 h at 18 °C to label the late endocytic compartment. Subsequently, cells were washed and incubated with biotin-HRP (1 mg/ml) at 18 °C for 30 min to mark the early endocytic compartment. Indicated amounts of test proteins were then injected into the oocytes in 50 nl of PBS, and the oocytes were further incubated at 18 °C. The oocytes were then washed, and three oocytes were lysed in 100 μl of PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100, 0.2% methylbenzethorium chloride, and 400 μg/ml of BSA-biotin as scavenger. Finally, the lysates were centrifuged for 30 s in a microfuge, and the avidin-biotin complexes were immunoprecipitated using anti-avidin antibody-coated plates by incubation at 4 °C overnight. The plates were then washed at least 5 times to remove the unbound proteins. Transport from the early endosomes to the late compartments was quantified by measuring the amount of immunoprecipitated HRP. Background was determined by the amount of HRP immunoprecipitated in the presence of scavenger at the 0 time point, which was found to be very low. The total amount of possible ligand mixing was measured in a similar way but in the absence of scavenger. By analogy with RAS, dominant negative and GTPase defective mutants of Rab5 and Rab7 have been prepared and characterized by several laboratories (6Bucci C. Parton R.G. Mather I.H. Stunnenberg H.

Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 225-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). For microinjection experiments with Xenopus oocytes, we generated the GTPase defective mutant, Rab7:Q67L, and the dominant negative mutant, Rab7:T22N, in addition to the wild-type protein as described. All the proteins were prepared as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins, and purified proteins were injected directly into oocytes. Recently, we have shown that Rab7 regulates endocytosis in oocytes in concert with Rab5 (30Mukhopadhyay, A., Barbieri, A. M., Funato, K., Roberts, R., and Stahl, P. D. (1997) J. Cell. Biol. , 272, in press.Google Scholar). Microinjection of Rab7:WT, Rab7:Q67L, and Rab5:WT stimulated HRP uptake into oocytes (30Mukhopadhyay, A., Barbieri, A. M., Funato, K., Roberts, R., and Stahl, P. D. (1997) J. Cell. Biol. , 272, in press.Google Scholar) (data not shown). Moreover, co-injection of Rab5 and Rab7 produced an additive effect on HRP uptake. Rab7-mediated HRP uptake was inhibited by Rab5:S34N. Rab7:T22N inhibited Rab7-stimulated uptake but had little effect on Rab5-stimulated HRP uptake. These results demonstrate that Rab7 plays a crucial role in the early endocytic process in the oocyte acting downstream of Rab5 (30Mukhopadhyay, A., Barbieri, A. M., Funato, K., Roberts, R., and Stahl, P. D. (1997) J. Cell. Biol. , 272, in press.Google Scholar). In the present study, we developed an assay to detect and quantify transport from the early to late endocytic compartments using ligand mixing as a biochemical readout. Oocytes were preloaded with avidin (2 mg/ml for 5 h) after which they were incubated for 16 h to label the late endocytic compartment, including lysosomes. Subsequently, cells were pulsed with biotin-HRP for a short period of time (30 min) to mark the early endocytic compartment. The cells were then injected with different Rab preparations, and following incubation for various periods of time, the formation of avidin-biotin-HRP complexes was determined in cell lysates. Oocyte lysis and preparation of avidin-biotin-HRP immune complexes was routinely carried out in the presence of biotin-BSA to scavenge unoccupied avidin molecules. The results presented in Fig.1 show that Rab7:WT stimulates transport of biotin-HRP to the late compartment prelabeled with avidin. Rab7-stimulated transport was maximal at about 90 min. The maximal efficiency of Rab7-mediated transport efficiency was calculated to be about 80% (total signal was determined in the absence of the scavenger biotin-BSA). In oocytes injected with control buffer, transport was linear over 90 min, and the efficiency of transport was about 20% at 90 min. All subsequent transport assays were carried out for 60 min at 18 °C. Rab7 is localized to late endosomes where it appears to function in early to late endosomal transport (20Feng Y. Press B. Wandinger-Ness A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1435-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar, 21Vitelli R. Santillo M. Lattero D. Chiariello M. Bifulco M. Bruni C.B. Bucci C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4391-4397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). It has been shown in Hela cells that Rab7:WT does not colocalize with markers of the early endocytic compartment but colocalizes with MPR, a marker for the late endocytic compartment (20Feng Y. Press B. Wandinger-Ness A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1435-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar, 21Vitelli R. Santillo M. Lattero D. Chiariello M. Bifulco M. Bruni C.B. Bucci C. J. Biol.

Moreover, Rab7:Q67L was found to co-localize with LAMP1 and LAMP2 as well as the lysosomal enzyme cathepsin D (23Meresse S. Grovel J.P. Chavrier P. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3349-3358PubMed Google Scholar). Using subcellular fractionation, Rab7- and Rab4-like GTPases were found to be localized on the lysosomal membrane inDictyostelium discoideum (33Temesvari L. Rodriguez-Paris J. Bush J. Steck T.L. Cardelli J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25719-25727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, Rab7 is commonly found on terminal endocytic compartments. The results presented in the Fig. 2 A show that both Rab7:WT and Rab7:Q67L stimulate early to late endosomal transport. In contrast, Rab7:T22N, the dominant negative mutant, had no effect. Furthermore, Rab5, which stimulates uptake and is associated with the early endocytic compartment, did not affect transport (Fig.2 B). In fact, Rab5:Q79L and Rab5:S34N were found to be slightly inhibitory (Fig. 2 B). GTP hydrolysis by Rab5 is not required for entrance into the early endosomal compartment, but it is possible that GTP hydrolysis and guanine nucleotide cycling on Rab5 is required for exit from the early compartment. A current model suggests that Rab recycling is coupled to guanine nucleotide exchange (34Ullrich O. Horiuchi H. Bucci C. Zerial M. Nature. 1994; 368: 157-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 35Soldati T. Shapiro A.D. Svejstrup A.B. Pfeffer S.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 18-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and that GDP dissociation inhibitor delivers cytosolic Rabs to appropriate donor compartments in a reaction that is coupled to the exchange of GDP for GTP. The GTP bound protein assists in the recruitment of appropriate fusion factors and GTP hydrolysis occurs after vesicle docking and fusion with the acceptor membrane. The GDP form of the protein is then recycled back to the donor compartment by GDP dissociation inhibitor. According to this model, Rab7:Q67L, which has reduced GTPase activity, should stimulate transport to the late compartment (20Feng Y. Press B. Wandinger-Ness A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1435-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar, 21Vitelli R. Santillo M. Lattero D. Chiariello M. Bifulco M. Bruni C.B. Bucci C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4391-4397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 23Meresse S. Grovel J.P. Chavrier P. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3349-3358PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, both Rab7:WT and Rab7:Q67L stimulated endocytic transport. As indicated above, Rab7:T22N, the dominant negative mutant was not active and did not substantially inhibit transport. Rab7:T22N is “functional” since we demonstrated earlier that this dominant negative mutant blocks endocytosis induced by Rab7 injection into oocytes (30Mukhopadhyay, A., Barbieri, A. M., Funato, K., Roberts, R., and Stahl, P. D. (1997) J. Cell. Biol. , 272, in press.Google Scholar). It is possible that the Rab7-dependent pathway is relatively inactive in oocytes. Injection of Rab7 would then activate the pathway. Under these conditions, one would not expect the dominant negative mutant of Rab7 to have much effect on normal transport. Alternatively, it is possible that injected recombinant mammalian Rab7 competes poorly with the endogenous equivalent frog Rab7 for accessory factors necessary for function. It is known that endocytosed materials are transported from the peripheral to a perinuclear location as they progress from early to late endosomes and that this process depends on intact microtubules (36Gruenberg J. Howell K.E. Annu. Rev. Cell. Biol. 1989; 5: 453-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). When microtubules are depolymerized, the markers failed to reach the late endosomal compartment. Thus, if the Rab7 mediates transport from the early to the late compartments then the process should be sensitive to microtubule depolymerizing agents like nocodazole. When oocytes were preincubated with 50 μm nocodazole, Rab7-stimulated uptake was inhibited almost to the control levels (data not shown). In contrast, Rab5-mediated uptake was much less affected by the exposure of the cells to nocodazole (data not shown). These data confirm earlier observations that transport from the plasma membrane to early endosome is not dependent on microtubules. To determine whether Rab7-mediated transport is dependent on microtubules, we tested the effect of 50 μm nocodazole in the transport assay. The results presented in Fig. 3show that Rab7-mediated transport from the early to late compartment was totally blocked by nocodazole, indicating that Rab7stimulated early to late compartment transport in oocytes is microtubule-dependent. The complete inhibition of transport to essentially basal levels suggests that other microtubule-sensitive pathways may exist in the oocyte. Recent work indicates that PI-3-kinases and their lipid products may play key roles in vesicular transport. The first evidence for the involvement of PI-3-kinase came from the studies of VPS34p, a yeast protein essential for protein targeting to the yeast vacuole and for vacuole morphogenesis (37Herman P.K. Emr S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6742-6754Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). VPS34p shows sequence homology with the mammalian PI-3-kinase and exhibits PI-3-kinase activity (38Schu P.V. Takegawa K. Fry M.J. Stack J.H. Waterfield M.D. Emr S.D. Science. 1993; 260: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). Several studies in mammalian cells also indicate that inhibitors of PI-3-kinase block fluid phase endocytosis as well as phagocytosis (28Li G. D'Souza-Schorey C. Barbieri M.A. Roberts R.L. Klippel A. Williams L.T. Stahl P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10207-10211Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 39Ninomiya N. Hazeki K. Fukui Y. Seya T. Okada T. Hazeki O. Ui M. J. Biol.

Wortmannin, a fungal metabolite, is a potent PI-3-kinase inhibitor which binds covalently to the catalytic subunit of PI-3-kinase (p110) and irreversibly inhibits enzymatic activity at nanomolar concentrations (41Yano H. Nakanishi S. Kimura K. Hanai N. Saitoh Y. Fukui Y. Nonomura Y. Matsuda Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25846-25856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The inhibition is highly specific since at these low concentrations (50–100 nm), wortmannin has no effect on other kinases. We first examined the effect of wortmannin on the endocytosis of HRP by oocytes following microinjection of Rab5:WT, Rab7:WT, and Rab7:Q67L. Rab5:WT, Rab7:WT, and Rab7:Q67L all stimulated HRP uptake by 2–2.5-fold. Rab5:WT and Rab7:WT stimulation of HRP uptake was nearly completely blocked by wortmannin treatment. These results are consistent with previous findings in baby hamster kidney cells transiently expressing Rab5:WT and Rab5:Q79L (28Li G. D'Souza-Schorey C. Barbieri M.A. Roberts R.L. Klippel A. Williams L.T. Stahl P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10207-10211Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 29Li, G., D'Souza-Schorey, C., Barbieri, M. A., Cooper, J. A., and Stahl, P. D. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. , 272, in press.Google Scholar). Wortmannin inhibited Rab5-enhanced uptake, but the drug had no effect on enhanced endocytosis produced by Rab5:Q79L (28Li G. D'Souza-Schorey C. Barbieri M.A. Roberts R.L. Klippel A. Williams L.T. Stahl P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10207-10211Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Wild-type Rab proteins require an activation step (e.g. guanine nucleotide exchange) to become GTP bound and biologically active. Constitutively activated mutants presumably bypass the activation step. Recent work 2M. A. Barbieri, and P. D. Stahl, submitted for publication. indicates that both wortmannin and recombinant PI-3-kinase affect the nucleotide status of Rab5, the former favoring the GDP-bound form and the latter favoring the GTP-bound form. The data presented in the Fig. 3 show that transport from early endosomes to late endosomes requires PI-3-kinase activity as wortmannin was found to inhibit this transport. We have also found that wortmannin inhibits the transport from the early to late compartments in mammalian cells. 3K. Funato, and P. D. Stahl, manuscript in preparation. Moreover, Rab7:Q67L, the constitutively activated mutant, does not require PI-3-kinase activity, suggesting that PI-3-kinase activates Rab7:WT either directly or through some intermediate to stimulate transport. In sum, the present data with oocytes along with earlier data suggest that PI-3-kinase activity is required for the activation of Rab5:WT and Rab7:WT. The NEM-sensitive fusion protein was originally identified as a factor required to restore the in vitro transport activity of Golgi membrane fractions treated with NEM (42Block M.R. Glick B.S. Wilcox C.A. Wieland F.T. Rothman J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7852-7856Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). NSF is required for intra-Golgi transport, endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi transport, as well as fusion between the early endosomes suggesting that NSF is a general component of the fusion machinery (43Beckers C.J.M. Bloch M.R. Glick B.S. Rothman J.E. Balch W.E. Nature. 1989; 339: 397-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 44Diaz R. Mayorga L.S. Weideman P.J. Rothman J.E. Stahl P.D. Nature. 1989; 339: 398-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 45Colombo M.I. Taddese M. Whiteheart S.W. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18810-18816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). NSF is a heterotrimer whose polypeptide subunits are made up of three distinct domains, an amino-terminal domain and two homologous ATP (D1 and D2) binding domains (46Whiteheart S.W. Rossnagel K. Buhrow S.A. Brunner M. Aenicke R. Rothman J.E. J. Cell. Biol. 1994; 126: 945-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). The ability of the D1 domain to hydrolyze ATP is required for NSF-mediated membrane fusion. The D2 domain is required for trimerization, but its ability to hydrolyze ATP is not absolutely required for NSF function. Two mutations in the first ATP binding site (D1), i.e. D1-K266A and D1-E329Q, are known to affect ATP binding and hydrolysis, respectively, resulting in inactive forms of NSF (46Whiteheart S.W. Rossnagel K. Buhrow S.A. Brunner M. Aenicke R. Rothman J.E. J. Cell. Biol. 1994; 126: 945-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Given that NSF is an ubiquitous protein required for multiple vesicular transport events, we tested the effect of NSF in the early to late transport assay using anti-NSF antibodies and NSF mutants. To confirm the participation of NSF in Rab7-mediated HRP endocytosis, we co-injected oocytes with Rab7:WT and His6NSF wild-type protein or Rab7:WT with the NSF mutants. Our results show that Rab7:WT-stimulated endocytosis HRP is not affected by the presence of NSF:WT protein but that His6 D1-E329Q and His6 D1-K266A significantly inhibit HRP uptake mediated by Rab7:WT (data not shown). We then explored the role of NSF in Rab7-stimulated transport from the early to late endosomal compartments. As shown in Fig. 4, both the DIEQ and DIKA mutants of NSF significantly inhibited the transport of biotin HRP from early to late endosomal compartments. Rab7 stimulation of the HRP uptake as well as transport inhibition by both NSF mutants indicates that ATP binding and hydrolysis are required for both processes. (Moreover, NEM was found to inhibit early to late transport in mammalian cells (data not shown).) These results are also consistent with the finding that YPT7, which is involved in the early to late transport events in yeast, also requires Sec17p (yeast α-snap) and Sec18p (yeast NSF) for function (47Mayer A. Wickner W. Hass A. Cell. 1996; 85: 83-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar,48Hass A. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 296-3305Google Scholar). In summary, our results demonstrate that early to late endosomal transport is stimulated by Rab7 and that this transport requires intact microtubules. Rab7:WT stimulation is blocked by wortmannin, suggesting that PI-3-kinase functions as a regulator of transport. Rab7:Q67L-stimulated transport is not blocked by wortmannin, suggesting that PI-3-kinase is directly or indirectly associated with nucleotide exchange as suggested for Rab5 (28Li G. D'Souza-Schorey C. Barbieri M.A. Roberts R.L. Klippel A. Williams L.T. Stahl P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10207-10211Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Furthermore, our results show that ATP binding and hydrolysis by NSF is also required in Rab7-stimulated transport. These findings also support the notion that NSF is a generic factor required for multiple transport events. It is well documented that Rab5 is required for transport between plasma membrane and early endosomes and that it regulates the dynamics of early endosome fusion (7Grovel J.P. Chavrier P. Zerial M. Gruenberg J. Cell. 1991; 64: 915-925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar, 8Li G. Stahl P.D. J. Biol.

Overexpression of GTP bound mutant, Rab5:Q79L, in cultured cells increases the rate of endocytosis and leads to the appearance of very large endocytic vesicles that may be due to fusion between early endosomes. However, transport out of the large endosome is delayed, 4Funato et al., manuscript in preparation. suggesting that hydrolysis of GTP by Rab5 is required for subsequent transport events. Rab5 and Rab7 appear to act in sequence along the endocytic pathway toward lysosomes. A key question that must be framed and resolved is the influence of a proximal Rab on the activation of an immediately distal Rab in the regulation of complex intracellular pathways.

We recently demonstrated that the PH domains of Tec family protein-tyrosine kinases Btk and Emt (equal to Itk and Tsk) interact with protein kinase C (PKC) and that PKC down-regulates Btk by phosphorylation. In this study we have characterized the PKC-BtkPH domain interaction in detail. Using pure PKC preparations, it was shown that the Btk PH domain interacts with PKC with high affinity (K D = 39 nm). Unlike other tested phospholipids, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, which binds to several PH domains, competed with PKC for binding to the PH domain apparently because their binding sites on the amino-terminal portion of the PH domains overlap. The minimal PKC-binding sequence within the Btk PH domain was found to correspond roughly to the second and third “β”-sheets of the PH domains of known tertiary structures. On the other hand, the C1 regulatory region of PKCε containing the pseudosubstrate and zinc finger-like sequences was found to be sufficient for strong binding to the Btk PH domain. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), a potent activator of PKC that interacts with the C1 region of PKC, inhibited the PKC-PH domain interaction, whereas the bioinactive PMA (4-α-PMA) was ineffective. The ζ isoform of PKC, which has a single zinc finger-like motif instead of the two tandem zinc finger-like sequences present in conventional and novel PKC isoforms, does not bind PMA. Thus, as expected, PH domain binding with PKCζ was not interfered with by PMA. Further, inhibitors that are known to attack the catalytic domains of serine/threonine kinases did not affect this PKC-PH domain interaction. In contrast, the presence of physiological concentrations of Ca2+ induced less than a 2-fold increase in PKC-PH domain binding. These results indicate that PKC binding to PH domains involve the “β”2–“β”3 region of the Btk PH domain and the C1 region of PKC, and agents that interact with either of these regions (i.e. phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate binding to the PH domain and PMA binding to the C1 region of PKC) might act to regulate PKC-PH domain binding.

Pleckstrin homology (PH) domains are comprised of loosely conserved sequences of approximately 100 amino acid residues (5Haslam R.J. Koide H.B.

Originally recognized as repeated sequences in the platelet protein pleckstrin (a prominent substrate for protein kinase C (PKC)), PH domains have been found in more than 60 proteins (7Shaw G.

The core of the compact domains is an antiparallel “β”-sheet consisting of seven strands. The amino-terminal four strands form a pocket-like structure, suggestive of a ligand-binding site. The carboxyl-terminal α-helix follows the last “β”-sheet. Studies by Lefkowitz and co-workers (17Koch W.J. Inglese J. Stone W.C. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

The invariant tryptophan residue in the carboxyl-terminal α-helical region of the PH domain was later shown to be important for this interaction (19Tsukada S. Simon M.I. Witte O.N. Katz A. Proc.

Membrane localizing functions have been implicated for the binding of PH domains to G-protein “β”γ complexes and PIP2. Indeed, many PH domain-containing proteins are known to be localized at the plasma membrane or other membrane structures. We recently demonstrated that the PH domains of protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs) Btk and Emt (equal to Itk and Tsk) interact directly with PKC (23Yao L. Kawakami Y. Kawakami T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9175-9179Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). We also presented evidence that PKC phosphorylates Btk and inhibits the kinase activity of the latter enzyme, suggesting that the PH domain-PKC interaction plays a regulatory role for Btk. Mutations in the gene encoding Btk lead to immunodeficiencies in humans (X-linked agammaglobulinemia, see Refs. 24Vetrie D.J. Vorechovsky I. Sideras P. Holland J. Davies A. Flinter F. Hammarstrom L.

In the present study we have characterized in detail the interaction between the Btk PH domain and PKC using an in vitro binding assay. A high affinity binding between PKC and the Btk PH domain was demonstrated by this assay. The interaction sites were mapped to the amino-terminal “β”2–“β”3 region of the Btk PH domain and the C1 regulatory region of PKCε. In accordance with the mapping data, PIP2 competes with PKC for binding to the PH domains of Btk and Emt while bioactive PMA that binds to the C1 region of PKC also inhibited the PKC-PH domain interaction.

DNA fragments encoding the PH domains of Btk and Emt were amplified with polymerase chain reaction using the cloned murine btk and emt cDNAs (39Yamada N. Kawakami Y. Kimura H. Fukamachi H. Baier G.

The polymerase chain reaction products were cloned into pCRII vector (Invitrogen, San Diego). Limited DNA sequence analysis was performed to verify the pCRII clones. The insert sequences released from the vector sequence by digestion with BamHI and EcoRI were ligated to pGEX-3T. GST proteins used in this study were GST-BtkPH (coding for residues 1–139 of Btk), GST-EmtPH (residues 1–109), and truncated Btk PH domain fragments. GST fusion proteins containing the subregions of the Btk PH domain were designated according to the Btk residue numbers at the amino and carboxyl termini,e.g. 28/77, which codes for the region from residue 28 to 77. pGEX-3T constructs were transformed into an Escherichia coli strain XL1 Blue (Stratagene). Fusion proteins were expressed by inducing 1 liter of log-phase bacteria with 0.4 mmisopropyl-“β”-d-thiogalactopyranoside overnight at 26 °C. Cells were collected and sonicated in phosphate-buffered saline, containing 1 mg/ml lysozyme, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1“%” Triton X-100. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and filtrated through 0.22-“μ”m filter Millex-GS (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Five hundred “μ”l of glutathione-agarose beads were incubated with lysates overnight at 4 °C and then washed thoroughly with phosphate-buffered saline, containing 1“%” Triton X-100 and 0.02“%” sodium azide. Purities and amounts of fusion proteins bound to beads were assessed after elution with SDS-sample buffer by SDS-polyacryamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. MCP-5 or HMC-1 cells were used to examine PKC binding activities of GST fusion proteins in vitro. Cells were lysed in 1“%” Nonidet P-40 buffer (Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer) containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.15 m NaCl, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 16.5 “μ”g/ml aprotinin, 10 “μ”g/ml leupeptin, 25 “μ”m p-nitrophenyl p′-guanidinobenzoate, and 0.1“%” sodium azide. Experiments shown in Fig. 5 A were done using Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer with various concentrations of Ca2+ in place of 0.1 mm CaCl2. Lysates (equivalent to 1 × 107 cells) were clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min and then mixed with 1–2 “μ”g of GST fusion proteins immobilized onto glutathione-agarose beads for 4 h at 4 °C. Experiments shown in Fig. 1 were done using rat brain PKC in place of cell lysates. In some experiments sonicated lipid vesicles or other chemicals were included in the mixture of GST fusion protein beads and mast cell lysates. Beads were washed six times with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, and bound proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and blotted to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore Corp.). PKC binding ability was evaluated by incubation with anti-PKC monoclonal antibody (MC5, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) that detects conventional isoforms of PKC (cPKC; α, “β”, and γ) or PKC isoform-specific antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology and Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), followed by incubation with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and visualization with the enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Corp.). Anti-PKCε (Life Technologies Inc.) was used for detection of PKCε holoenzyme and ε-epitope-tagged fragments of PKCε or c-Raf-1.Figure 1Kinetics of the interaction between rat brain PKC and the Btk PH domain. A, GST or GST-BtkPH (1 “μ”g each) immobilized onto glutathione-agarose beads was incubated with the indicated amounts of rat brain PKC, and bound PKC was detected by immunoblotting with anti-cPKC (MC5) monoclonal antibody. The enhanced chemiluminescence method was used to visualize the immunoreactive bands (upper panel). Immunoblotting of known amounts of PKC was carried out to generate the standard curve (lower panel).B, amounts of bound PKC were plotted as a function of input PKC. Scatchard analysis based on this experiment gave aK D value of 39 nm. A representative result out of three similar experiments is presented.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A far Western blotting experiment showed that GST-BtkPH immobilized onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane binds to purified rat brain PKC (23Yao L. Kawakami Y. Kawakami T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9175-9179Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), indicating the direct interaction between the PH domain and PKC. The PKC preparations used in the above and following experiments are a pure (>95“%”) population of the Ca2+-dependent isoforms of α, “β”, and γ collectively termed cPKC. To analyze the kinetics of the interaction, rat brain PKC was incubated with GST-BtkPH immobilized onto glutathione-agarose beads. Bound PKC was detected by immunoblotting with a monoclonal anti-cPKC antibody (MC5) in conjunction with the enhanced chemiluminescence method. The amounts of bound PKC were quantified using the standard curve obtained by immunoblotting of known amounts of rat brain PKC. The results shown in Fig. 1demonstrated that a pure population of rat brain PKC binds to GST-BtkPH in a concentration-dependent manner. The dissociation constant K D of this interaction was 39 nm as revealed by Scatchard analysis (data not shown). This affinity is much higher than those of the PIP2-PH domain interactions (see ““”Discussion“””). To define the determinant for PKC binding within the PH domain of Btk, the solid-phase binding assay (23Yao L. Kawakami Y. Kawakami T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9175-9179Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) was used. We prepared several carboxyl-terminal deletion mutants derived from the parental pGEX-3T-BtkPH plasmid and other truncated mutants and determined their ability to bind PKC in MCP-5 murine mast cell lysates (Fig.2 A). As shown in Fig. 2 B, the carboxyl-terminal truncated PH domain fusions that retain the amino-terminal sequence up to residue 45, as well as the amino- and carboxyl-terminal truncated PH domain fusion 28/77, bound to cPKC. Therefore, the minimal PKC-binding sequence corresponds to the region encompassing “β”-sheets 2 and 3 as deduced from tertiary structural studies on several PH domains (Fig. 2 C). The above mapping results indicated that the minimal PKC-binding sequence overlaps the binding site for PIP2 and IP3 shown for several PH domains including that of Emt (Fig. 2 C). Therefore, we examined possible competition for binding to the Btk PH domain between PKC and various phospholipids. GST-BtkPH beads were incubated with MCP-5 mast cell lysates in the presence of various concentrations of phospholipids. No effects on the interaction between cPKC and GST-BtkPH were found with such lipids as phosphatidylserine (up to 32 “μ”g/ml, data not shown), phosphatidylcholine (up to 115 “μ”g/ml), phosphatidylethanolamine (up to 115 “μ”g/ml, data not shown), phosphatidylinositol (up to 115 “μ”g/ml), and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (up to 115 “μ”g/ml) (Fig. 3). In contrast, PIP2 inhibited cPKC binding to the Btk PH domain in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3). The IC50 (∼1 “μ”m) estimated by densitometric measurements of the bound PKC bands was similar to the reported dissociation constant between PIP2 and the PLC-δ1 PH domain (1.7 “μ”m). Similar data were obtained using PIP2 from two different suppliers. The PIP2 competition for binding with cPKC also was observed with GST-EmtPH (data not shown). GST-BtkPH bound to both Ca2+-dependent (α, “β”I, and “β”II) and Ca2+-independent isoforms (ε and ζ) in mast cell lysates (data not shown). To determine the PH domain-binding region within PKCε we utilized stably transfected NIH/3T3 cell lines that overexpress the epitope-tagged domain fragments of PKCε depicted in Fig. 4 (37Lehel C. Olah Z. Jakab G. Szallasi Z. Petrovics G. Harta G. Blumberg P.M. Anderson W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19651-19658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 38Olah Z. Ferrier A. Lehel C. Anderson W.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 214: 340-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). For comparison, we also used NIH/3T3 cells expressing c-Raf-1 fragments tagged with the same epitope (data not shown). These cells were lysed, and the extracts were used in the solid-phase binding assay with GST-BtkPH beads. Bound PKCε fragments were detected by immunoblotting with anti-ε (epitope) antibody. The results showed that the relative band intensities of the GST-BtkPH-bound PKCε fragments normalized to their expression level in cell lysates were high with the PKCε holoenzyme and with fragments ε1 and ε2 (Fig. 4). However, fragments ε3 and ε7, which lack the pseudosubstrate region, exhibited lower but significant binding capacities to GST-BtkPH. GST control beads bound negligible amounts of these PKCε fragments. These data demonstrated that the C1 region of PKCε is sufficient for interaction with the Btk PH domain. Neither RI-ε nor RIII-ε fragments derived from the regulatory and catalytic domains, respectively, of c-Raf-1 (38Olah Z. Ferrier A. Lehel C. Anderson W.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 214: 340-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) bound to the PH domain (data not shown). RI-ε contains the zinc finger-like sequence of c-Raf-1 that has a low level homology (∼30“%” identity) with that of the C1 region of PKC. Therefore, the lack of PH domain binding to RI-ε indicates a high specificity of PKC-PH domain interactions. An epitope-tagged rat PKC“β”I construct encompassing residues 312–671, which correspond to the catalytic domain, failed to bind to GST-BtkPH (data not shown). PIP2 binds to PH domains (21Harlan J.E. Hadjuk P.J. Yoon H.S. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1994; 371: 168-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar, 22Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. O'Brien R. Sigler P.B. Schlessinger J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10472-10476Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Since PIP2also binds to the C2 region of PKC (40Newton, A. C., Protein Kinase C, Parker, P. J., Dekker, L., 1996, R. G. Landes Co., in press.Google Scholar), there was a possibility that the observed PIP2 competition with cPKC holoenzyme for binding to PH domains (Fig. 3) could be due to the allosteric effect of PIP2 bound to the C2 region. Therefore, effects of PIP2 on the interactions between GST-BtkPH and the PKCε fragments ε2 and ε3, which have no PIP2-binding region, were examined. The addition of 60 “μ”g/ml PIP2 to the binding mixtures inhibited these interactions by more than 70“%” (Fig.4), suggesting that PIP2 binds to the PH domain to prevent ε2 and ε3 from interacting with GST-BtkPH. In contrast, the presence of 60 “μ”g/ml phosphatidylserine did not inhibit the GST-BtkPH-PKCε fragment interactions (data not shown). Activation of cPKCs requires Ca2+ and diacylglycerol/PMA in addition to phosphatidylserine (41Nishizuka Y. Nature. 1984; 308: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (5764) Google Scholar). Effects of these factors on the PKC-PH domain interaction were examined using GST-BtkPH and mast cell lysates. The addition of 0.1–5 “μ”m Ca2+ resulted in less than a 2-fold increase in cPKC binding compared with the binding in the absence of Ca2+ or in the presence of EGTA (Fig.5 A), although non-physiologically high Ca2+ concentrations (10–1000 “μ”m) induced up to a 5-fold increase in cPKC binding (data not shown). 1 “μ”m Ca2+ did not affect significantly the PH domain binding to recombinant PKC“β”I compared with that in the absence of Ca2+ (data not shown). These data are consistent with the above mapping data that the primary PH domain-binding site is the C1 region. PMA inhibited cPKC binding to GST-BtkPH in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50 of ∼1 “μ”m, while the bioinactive PMA (4-α-PMA) did not alter the level of bound cPKC (Fig.5 B). These results are consistent with the mapping results. Thus, PMA (but not 4-α-PMA) binds to the C1 region of conventional and novel PKC isoforms, which are composed of two tandem zinc finger-like motifs. In contrast, the PKCζ and PKCλ/ι isoforms have only one zinc finger-like motif and thus lack the ability to bind PMA (42Ono Y. Fujii T. Ogita K. Kikkawa U. Igarashi K. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3099-3103Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 43Akimoto K. Mizuno K. Osada S. Hirai S. Tanuma S. Suzuki K. Ohno S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12677-12683Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The above mapping data strongly suggest that the C1 region of PKC binds to the amino-terminal region of the PH domain containing the “β”2–“β”3 sheets. If this is the case, the PH domain interaction with PKCζ should not be susceptible to PMA-mediated inhibition due to the lack of interaction between PKCζ and PMA. Indeed, the PKCζ-GST-BtkPH interaction was not affected by increasing concentrations of PMA up to 100 “μ”m (Fig.5 C). We also examined the effects of inhibitors of PKC and of other serine/threonine kinases on PKC-PH domain interaction. Staurosporine (a potent PKC inhibitor), KT-5720 (a selective protein kinase A inhibitor), and KT-5926 (a specific inhibitor of myosin light chain kinase), all showed little, if any, effect o"

However, the bands corresponding to these modes were not observed for PYPM, the blue-shifted intermediate, but the 1175 cm−1 band characteristic of the neutral p-coumaryl chromophore was observed, indicating that the phenolic oxygen of the chromophore is protonated in PYPM. A 1736 cm−1 band was observed for PYP, but the corresponding band for PYPM was not. Because it disappeared in the Glu-46 → Gln mutant of PYP, this band was assigned to the C=O stretching mode of the COOH group of Glu-46.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14047-14053Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Irradiation of PYP at −190 °C yields PYPB (λmax = 489 nm) and PYPH (λmax = 442 nm), which are thermally converted to PYPL (λmax = 456 nm) through PYPBL (λmax = 400 nm) and PYPHL(λmax = 447 nm), respectively. The two pathways beginning with PYPB and PYPH join at PYPL and revert to PYP. Flash photolysis at ambient temperature identified two intermediates, pR (λmax = 465 nm) and pB (λmax = 355 nm) (11Meyer T.E. Yakali E. Cusanovich M.A. Tollin G.

It decays to pB over a submillisecond time scale and reverts to PYP within 1 s. It has been demonstrated that pR is the same species as PYPL (10Imamoto Y. Kataoka M. Tokunaga F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14047-14053Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) (In this paper, pR and pB are called PYPL and PYPM, respectively, to avoid confusion) and that PYPL is accumulated by irradiation of PYP at −80 °C (10Imamoto Y.

Photobiol. 1995; 17: 111-115Google Scholar). However, the precursors of PYPLhave not been discovered by flash photolysis at room temperature. Recent studies have clarified some details of the events that take place during the PYP photocycle. Crystallography at 1.4-Å resolution (7Baca M. Borgstahl G.E.O. Boissinot M. Burke P.M. Williams D.R. Slater K.A. Getzoff E.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14369-14377Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) and resonance Raman spectroscopy (14Kim M. Mathies R.A. Hoff W.D. Hellingwerf K.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12669-12672Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) have shown that the phenolic oxygen of the chromophore of PYP is deprotonated in the dark state. The photocycle is initiated by photon absorption, which involves isomerization of the ethylenic bond of the chromophore (15Kort R. Vonk H. Xu X. Hoff W.D. Crielaard W. Hellingwerf K.J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). During the photocycle, observed proton uptake and release correspond with the formation and decay of PYPM (16Meyer T.E. Cusanovich M.A. Tollin G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 306: 515-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The largely blue-shifted absorption spectrum of PYPMsuggests that the chromophore/protein interaction of PYPMis quite different from that of PYP. Therefore, elucidation of the chromophore structure of PYPM is essential to understand the photocycle of PYP. For the spectral blue-shift of PYPM, the following explanations would be possible: (i) the phenolic oxygen of the chromophore is protonated; (ii) the conjugated double bond system is broken by extreme distortion of the chromophore (25Kakitani H. Kakitani T. Rodman H. Honig B. Photochem. Photobiol. 1985; 41: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar); and (iii) the π electrons of the conjugated double bond system are localized by a nearby positive charge (e.g. Arg-52) (26Honig B. Greenberg A.D. Dinur U. Ebrey T.G. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 4593-4599Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The first explanation is the most simple and plausible, but there has been no previous experimental evidence to support it, and the others could not be excluded. In the dark state, the phenolic oxygen of the chromophore interacts with the OH groups of Tyr-42 and Glu-46 by hydrogen bonds (5Borgstahl G.E.O. Williams D.R. Getzoff E.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6278-6287Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). As shown in retinal protein systems, the changes in the hydrogen-bonding network centering on the chromophore closely correlates with the protein conformational changes (17Maeda A. Isr. J. Chem. 1995; 35: 387-400Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is of importance to study the internal proton movement around the chromophore and nearby amino acid residues to understand the light signal transduction mechanism of PYP. Recently it has been reported that the C=O stretching mode of the COOH group disappears on the formation of PYPM (18Xie A. Hoff W.D. Kroon A.R. Hellingwerf K.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14671-14678Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). They reasoned that Glu-46 donates a proton to the chromophore, based on the fact that Glu-46 has a unique COOH group embedded in the protein. This idea arose on elucidation of the tertiary structure of PYP (5Borgstahl G.E.O. Williams D.R. Getzoff E.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6278-6287Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar) and seems reasonable. However, two vital pieces of experimental evidence required to support this conclusion have never been reported: one is that the chromophore of PYPM is protonated, and the other is assignment of the C=O stretching mode. Recent progress in experimental techniques made it possible to prepare PYP with an isotope-labeled chromophore (9Imamoto Y. Ito T. Kataoka M. Tokunaga F. FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 157-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and a site-directed mutant of PYP (19Mihara, K., Hisatomi, O., Imamoto, Y., Kataoka, M., and Tokunaga, F. (1997) J. Biochem.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). These techniques have enabled assignment of the vibrational modes. In the present study, to study the movement of the proton around the chromophore and nearby amino acid residues, the vibrational modes of the chromophore and COOH group of PYP and its intermediates were analyzed by low temperature FTIR spectroscopy. The first experimental findings indicating proton transfer from Glu-46 to the chromophore during the photocycle are presented. PYP was isolated from E. halophila BN 9626 according to previously reported methods (1Meyer T.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 806: 175-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 10Imamoto Y.

The Glu-46 → Gln mutant of PYP (E46Q) was expressed by Escherichia coli and reconstituted with p-coumaric anhydride (19Mihara, K., Hisatomi, O., Imamoto, Y., Kataoka, M., and Tokunaga, F. (1997) J.

(Tokyo), in press.Google Scholar).p-Coumaric-8-13C-acid was prepared byp-hydroxybenzaldehyde and triethylphosphonoacetate-2-13C followed by alkaline hydrolysis of the ester. 13C-Labeled PYP was prepared by reconstitution of PYP with 13C-labeledp-coumaric anhydride and apoPYP (9Imamoto Y. Ito T. Kataoka M. Tokunaga F. FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 157-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). They were then desalted by dialysis and applied to a small DEAE-Sepharose column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). After washing the column with 10 mmphosphate buffer (pH 7.2), PYP was eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (100–200 mm) in the same buffer. PYP was then concentrated with an ultrafiltration membrane (Centriprep 10, Amicon) and diluted with 10 mm phosphate buffer. Dilution and concentration steps were repeated several times to remove NaCl. Finally, PYP was concentrated to 3–4 mg/ml. A 20 μl sample was placed on a BaF2 window (10 mm in diameter) and dried under a gentle stream of N2 gas. The dried sample was sealed using a silicon rubber spacer and another BaF2 window and set in the sample cell holder. Before sealing, 0.2 μl of H2O or D2O was put inside the spacer for hydration or deuteration of PYP. The sample cell holder was mounted in an optical cryostat (DN1704, Oxford) connected to a temperature controller (ITC502, Oxford). Absorption spectra in the UV-visible region were recorded with a Hitachi U-3210 recording spectrophotometer. Infrared spectra were recorded with a Horiba FT-210 Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer equipped with an MCT detector. The sample was irradiated with a 1 kW slide projector (HILUX-HR, Tokyo Master) using glass optical filters (Y47, Toshiba). The difference FTIR spectra shown in this paper are the means of four to eight independent recordings, each of which was the mean of 64 scans (resolution = 2 cm−1). Our recent low temperature spectroscopy results with PYP in 66% glycerol buffer showed that PYPL is formed by the irradiation of PYP at −80 °C, but PYPM was not observed in the thermal reaction (10Imamoto Y. Kataoka M. Tokunaga F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14047-14053Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). This could be due to the effect of the presence of glycerol at high concentration, because it suppresses the decay of PYPL but accelerates the decay of PYPM(20Meyer T.E. Tollin G. Hazzard J.H. Cusanovich M.A. Biophys. J. 1989; 56: 559-564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In the method used here, the film sample can be frozen with no increase in turbidity, and the addition of glycerol was not necessary for the low temperature experiments, thus removing impediments to the formation of PYPM. We tested several irradiation conditions above −80 °C to accumulate PYPM without PYPL for FTIR spectroscopy. Upon irradiation of PYP film with >450-nm light at −40 °C, the absorbance at 350 nm was increased (Fig. 1). Because this product had largely blue-shifted absorption spectrum similar to pB (Fig. 1,inset) and directly reverted to PYP (data not shown), it would correspond to pB (called PYPM hereafter). In this difference spectrum, the absorbance at 460 nm was not increased, indicating that only PYPM was formed. Under this irradiation condition, the difference FTIR spectra were recorded with hydrated and deuterated PYP films. The difference spectra before and after irradiation with >450-nm light at −40 °C are the difference between PYPM and PYP (PYPM/PYP spectrum), in which positive and negative peaks are attributed to PYPMand PYP, respectively (Fig. 2). The prominent bands of PYP were observed at 1736, 1560, 1482, 1437, 1301, 1163, 1058, 1041, 983, and 831 cm−1. On the other hand, the intensities of the bands of PYPM were relatively small, but 1175, 1081, and 994 cm−1 bands were characteristic for PYPM. Several bands of them were affected by D2O substitution.Figure 2Difference FTIR spectra between PYP and PYPM in hydrated (solid line) and deuterated (dotted line) samples. The IR spectrum of each sample was recorded before and after irradiation with >450-nm light for 600 s (means of 64 scans at −40 °C). After warming the sample to the room temperature, recording was repeated. The spectra shown were normalized at 1163 cm−1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Recent resonance Raman spectroscopy covering the range 1750–1000 cm−1 (14Kim M. Mathies R.A. Hoff W.D. Hellingwerf K.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12669-12672Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) was helpful for the implication of our FTIR data. It was reported that the prominent vibrational modes of PYP were observed at 1633, 1558, 1498, 1439, 1288, 1165, 1059, and 1043 cm−1 in H2O buffer (14Kim M. Mathies R.A. Hoff W.D. Hellingwerf K.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12669-12672Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and were shifted 0–4 cm−1 by D2O substitution. It was concluded that the chromophore of PYP is deprotonated; otherwise the chromophore bands would be D2O-sensitive. It was further pointed out that the deprotonated chromophore shows bands at 1498, 1439 and 1165 cm−1 but when protonated there is only one band at 1176 cm−1 (14Kim M. Mathies R.A. Hoff W.D. Hellingwerf K.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12669-12672Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The PYPM/PYP spectrum reported here shows corresponding bands: negative at 1482, 1437, and 1163 cm−1 and positive at 1175 cm−1. The bands at 1482, 1437, and 1163 cm−1 were observed only on the negative side, indicating that PYPM does not have vibrational modes corresponding to these. Moreover, the fact that the 1175 cm−1 band was strongly affected by D2O substitution suggests that the chromophore of PYPM is protonated. To confirm that the 1175 cm−1 band of PYPM is the vibrational mode of the chromophore, PYPM/PYP spectrum was recorded using PYP containing13C-labeled chromophore at 8 position under the same irradiation condition (>450-nm light, −40 °C) (Fig.3 a). The shift of 1175 cm−1 band with 13C-label (Fig. 3 a) was similar to that with D2O substitution (Fig. 2). Therefore, this band is attributed to the chromophore, which proves that the chromophore of PYPM is protonated. The negative band at 1736 cm−1 should be noted because it could be the C=O stretching mode of the COOH group of either aspartic acid or glutamic acid. A similar band was found recently by FTIR spectroscopy (18Xie A. Hoff W.D. Kroon A.R. Hellingwerf K.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14671-14678Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), although the irradiation condition was considerably different from that of the present experiment. The appearance of the negative band without the complementary positive band indicates deprotonation of the COOH group. Among 19 acidic residues of PYP (7Baca M. Borgstahl G.E.O. Boissinot M. Burke P.M. Williams D.R. Slater K.A. Getzoff E.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14369-14377Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), the most plausible candidate for the origin of this band would be Glu-46 because its OH group directly interacts with the phenolic oxygen of the chromophore and it is buried inside the protein. To test this, a Glu-46 → Gln mutant (E46Q) of PYP was prepared (19Mihara, K., Hisatomi, O., Imamoto, Y., Kataoka, M., and Tokunaga, F. (1997) J. Biochem. (Tokyo), in press.Google Scholar), and its vibrational modes were studied by FTIR spectroscopy. Whereas the absorption maximum of E46Q in the visible region is slightly red-shifted from wild type PYP (19Mihara, K., Hisatomi, O., Imamoto, Y., Kataoka, M., and Tokunaga, F. (1997) J. Biochem. (Tokyo), in press.Google Scholar), the intermediate corresponding to PYPM accumulated under the same irradiation conditions (>450-nm light, −40 °C) (data not shown). FTIR spectroscopy was then carried out using E46Q, and a PYPM/PYP spectrum was obtained (Fig. 3 b). As expected, the PYPM/PYP spectrum of E46Q did not show a 1736-cm−1 band, indicating that the C=O stretching mode of the COOH group of Glu-46 is indeed the origin of this band. Namely, Glu-46 is protonated in PYP and releases its proton in the PYPM state. Based on our present observations, the model for proton movement during the PYP photocycle is shown in Fig. 4. On absorption of a photon, the chromophore of PYP isomerizes to thecis form (15Kort R. Vonk H. Xu X. Hoff W.D. Crielaard W. Hellingwerf K.J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). There are two possible models for the isomerization of the chromophore: one is that the phenol part rotates, and the other is that the ester part rotates. Xie et al.(18Xie A. Hoff W.D. Kroon A.R. Hellingwerf K.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14671-14678Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) proposed that the hydrogen bond between the OH group of Glu-46 and the phenolic oxygen of the chromophore remains in PYPL and supported the latter model. However, they irradiated PYP at 80 K to trap PYPL. At 80 K, irradiation yields a mixture of PYPB and PYPH (10Imamoto Y. Kataoka M. Tokunaga F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14047-14053Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 21Hoff W.D. Kwa S.L.S. Van Grondelle R. Hellingwerf K.J. Photochem. Photobiol. 1992; 56: 529-539Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar), so the changes in C=O stretching mode of PYP observed at 80 K cannot be attributed to PYPL. Moreover, the intermediate formed readily absorbs a photon, and it is uncertain whether or not the photoproduct accumulated at 80 K has the cis chromophore. Therefore, few data are available to discuss the mechanism of the isomerization of the chromophore. However, the latter model is likely because the phenolic oxygen interacts with Glu-46 and Tyr-42, and it is fixed by the hydrogen bond. In the case of retinal proteins, the protein moiety has the binding site for the β-ionone ring of the chromophore, and the Schiff base portion (rather than the β-ionone ring region) rotates on photoisomerization (22Shichida Y. Ono T. Yoshizawa T. Matsumoto H. Asato A.E. Zingoni J.P. Liu R.S.H. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4422-4428Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). That is, in both PYP and retinal protein systems, the smaller moiety rotates on isomerization. Minimization of the conformational change upon isomerization would contribute to the fast and highly efficient photoreaction of photoreceptor proteins. The present experiments have demonstrated the first evidence that the phenolic oxygen of the chromophore is protonated in PYPM. The absorption maximum of PYPM is 355 nm (12Hoff W.D. Van Stokkum I.H.M. Van Ramesdonk H.J. Van Brederode M.E. Brouwer A.M. Fitch J.C. Meyer T.E. Van Grondelle R. Hellingwerf K.J. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 1691-1705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), which is close to that of denatured PYP at neutral pH (11Meyer T.E. Yakali E. Cusanovich M.A. Tollin G. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 418-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 23Kroon A.R. Hoff W.D. Fennema H.P.M. Gijzen J. Koomen G.-J. Verhoeven J.W. Crielaard W. Hellingwerf K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31949-31956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Because the phenolic oxygen of PYP is protonated, the largely blue-shifted absorption spectrum of PYPM is due mainly to protonation of the chromophore. However, the possibility that steric interactions and the nearby positive charge affect the absorption spectrum of PYPM is not completely excluded. These effects will be examined in future research. In retinal proteins, the chromophore of the dark state is protonated at the nitrogen atom of the Schiff base linkage and positively charged. It is deprotonated and neutral in the near-UV intermediates like M and metarhodopsin II. In contrast, the p-coumaryl chromophore is negatively charged in PYP but is neutral in PYPM. Despite the striking differences in the chromophores, protein moieties, and linkages, the chromophores of both retinal proteins and PYP turn neutral in their near-UV intermediates, which are thought to be formed as the result of large conformational changes (17Maeda A. Isr. J. Chem. 1995; 35: 387-400Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 28Spudich J.L. Lanyi J.K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 452-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In addition,cis/trans isomerization of the chromophore is involved in both systems (15Kort R. Vonk H. Xu X. Hoff W.D. Crielaard W. Hellingwerf K.J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). These are the common events for the protein conformational changes among the photoreceptor proteins and would be the most efficient mechanism. Namely, the charged chromophore is the core of the hydrogen-bonding network that determines its tertiary structure in the dark state. Isomerization of the chromophore on photon absorption results in the loss of its charge. As a result, the hydrogen-bonding network is disordered, and the protein conformational change takes place. In PYP, the phenolic oxygen of the chromophore interacts with Tyr-42 and Glu-46, and the chromophore binding site is Cys-69. The loss of this interaction would make the structure of the chromophore binding site remarkably flexible. The present work confirmed that the 1736 cm−1 band of PYP is the C=O stretching mode of the COOH group of Glu-46. Absence of this mode in PYPM indicates that Glu-46 is protonated in PYP but deprotonated in PYPM. Concurrently, the chromophore of PYPM is protonated. This indicates that the pK a values of the chromophore and Glu-46 of PYPM are close to those in solution but that those of PYP are considerably different due to the hydrophobic environment in the protein. Therefore, the chromophore binding pocket would be exposed to the solvent in PYPM as the result of the protein conformational changes. Because the protonation states of the chromophore and Glu-46 are complementary, the simplest model for proton pathways would be that the proton at Glu-46 is transferred to the chromophore in PYPMstate, recovering to Glu-46 in the recovery step (Fig. 4). In E46Q, the chromophore would uptake proton from the solvent or Tyr-42 would act as the alternative proton donor. This model does not explain the proton release and uptake coupled with the formation and decay of PYPM. Therefore, another amino acid residue and/or water might be involved in the proton transfer, resulting in vectorial movement of the proton, as with bacteriorhodopsin (24Braiman M.S. Mogi T. Marti T. Stern L.J. Khorana H.G. Rothschild K.J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8516-8520Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Further FTIR studies on the other intermediates using various site-directed mutants will elucidate the pathway of proton transfer.

In addition, talc and disordered biopyriboles were found replacing enstatite grains along cracks and fractures.

https://openalex.org/W2095046547,"DnaJ-like proteins are functional partners for Hsp70 molecular chaperones. Complete nucleotide sequencing of yeast chromosome X has revealed that an open reading frame YJL073w encodes a novel member of the DnaJ-like protein family. The open reading frame represents a protein of 692 amino acids with a J-domain and one putative membrane-spanning segment. An epitope-tagged version of the protein was anchored in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and its J-domain faced the ER lumen. We therefore propose to designate this gene <i>JEM1</i> (DnaJ-like protein of theER membrane) and to designate its gene product JEM1p. The <i>JEM1</i> gene is not essential for cell growth, but double disruption of the <i>JEM1</i> gene and the <i>SCJ1</i>gene, which encodes another DnaJ-like protein in the ER lumen, causes growth arrest at elevated temperature. The <i>Δjem1</i> mutant is defective in nuclear fusion, karyogamy, during mating. A mutant JEM1p carrying a mutation in the highly conserved His-Pro-Asp sequence in the J-domain could not complement either temperature-sensitive growth of the <i>Δjem1 Δscj1</i> double mutant or defects in karyogamy of the <i>Δjem1</i> mutant. JEM1p likely assists the functions of BiP, Hsp70 in the ER, including karyogamy."
https://openalex.org/W2112139849,"Replication of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is increased by different cytokines and T cell activators, also known to modulate tyrosine phosphorylation levels. A novel class of protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) inhibitors, peroxovanadium (pV) compounds, were tested for a putative effect on HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) activity. We found that these PTP inhibitors markedly enhanced HIV-1 LTR activity in 1G5 cells, a stably transfected cell line that harbors an HIV-1 LTR-driven luciferase construct. A direct correlation between the extent of tyrosine phosphorylation and the level of HIV-1 LTR inducibility was seen after treatment with three different pV compounds. Transient transfection experiments were carried out in several T cell lines, and after addition of pV, a marked increase in HIV-1 LTR activity was measured. Monocytoid cells were tested using U937-derived cell lines and were also found to be sensitive to the pV-mediated potentiating effect on HIV-1 LTR activity. A significant reduction of the pV-mediated increase in HIV-1 LTR activity was seen in cells transiently transfected with an HIV-1 LTR-driven luciferase construct bearing a mutation in both NF-κB binding sites although detectable levels of induction remained. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays allowed the identification of the nuclear translocation of the NF-κB p50·p65 heterodimer complex induced by pV compounds. A dominant negative version of the repressor IκBα mutated on serines 32 and 36 impeded pV-induced NF-κB-dependent luciferase activity. Western blot analysis showed a clear diminution in the protein level of IκBα starting 30 min after pV treatment of Jurkat E6.1 cells which is indicative of its degradation. On the other hand, no increase in tyrosine phosphorylation was observed on IκBα itself. Finally, we tested the PTP inhibitors on four cell lines latently infected with HIV-1 and showed a consistent pV-mediated increase in virion production. Thus, our studies suggest that pV-mediated activation of HIV-1 LTR activity is controlled by the nuclear translocation of the NF-κB transcription factor, which is mediated by IκBα serine phosphorylation and degradation, but also by a still undefined NF-κB-independent pathway.

Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4599) Google Scholar). Most of these HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) inducers act either completely or partially via the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) transcription factor. Although rarer, certain LTR activators are known to act through NF-κB-independent pathways and include, for example, sodium butyrate, an inducer potentially acting on relaxation of chromatin by histone acetylation (2Laughlin M.A. Chang G.Y. Oakes J.W. Gonzalezscarano F. Pomerantz R.J. J. Acquired Immune Defic. Syndr. Hum. Retrovirol. 1995; 9: 332-339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NF-κB has been shown to regulate viral transcription via the two NF-κB sites located in the HIV-1 LTR enhancer region (3Nabel G. Baltimore D. Nature. 1987; 326: 711-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (1453) Google Scholar). The predominant form of this transcription factor has been identified as a heterodimer made of 50-kDa (p50) and 65-kDa (p65 or RelA) subunits (4Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Nature. 1990; 344: 678-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar,5Urban M.B. Schreck R. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 19: 1817-1825Crossref Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The heterodimeric NF-κB complex is sequestered in the cytoplasm as an inactive precursor complexed with a repressor termed IκBα that masks the nuclear localization signal of the heterodimer complex (6Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1988; 53: 211-217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar, 7Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1988; 242: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1685) Google Scholar). Formation of the active nuclear form of NF-κB composed of p50 and p65 subunits are induced after extra- or intracellular stimulation of cells. These stimulants appear to act primarily by inducing the release and degradation of IκBα subsequent to its phosphorylation on both serine 32 and 36 residues (8Brown K. Gerstberger S. Carlson L. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U. Science. 1995; 267: 1485-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1315) Google Scholar), thereby allowing the rapid translocation of NF-κB from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and binding on regulatory regions of genes bearing the NF-κB binding sites (4Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Nature. 1990; 344: 678-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar, 6Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D.

Ever since it became evident that activation of NF-κB involves the release of the IκBα repressor by direct phosphorylation, it has been attractive to evaluate the role of protein phosphorylation in directly or indirectly affecting the NF-κB pathway. Overall, several protein kinases have been shown to be important in the regulation of NF-κB translocation including protein kinase A, protein kinase C, Raf, and p59fyn (9Hohashi N. Hayashi T.

Dezube B.J. Pardee A.B. Mol. Med. 1994; 1: 31-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), most of which have also been shown to modulate HIV-1 LTR activity. Further evidence supporting the role played by phosphorylation events in the control of NF-κB activity came from the demonstration that okadaic acid, a selective inhibitor of Ser/Thr phosphatase (13Walter G. Mumby M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1155: 207-226PubMed Google Scholar), induces NF-κB translocation in intact cells (14Thevenin C. Kim S.-C. Riekmann P. Fujiki H. Norcross M.A. Sporn M.B. Fauci A.S. Kehrl J.H. New Biol. 1990; 2: 793-800PubMed Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation levels have been shown to often increase in signaling pathways leading to NF-κB activation. The level of tyrosine phosphorylation should thus be of importance in the control of the pathway(s) leading to the activation and translocation of NF-κB. Tyrosine phosphorylation is regulated by two opposing enzymatic activities, namely protein tyrosine kinases (PTK) and protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTP). These latter include a wide range of different enzymes, CD45 being the major constituent of T cell surface PTP (15Trowbridge I.A. Thomas M.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 85-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). Modulation of intracellular phosphotyrosine content by PTP represents a crucial mechanism by which the cellular response is regulated. This fact is clearly demonstrated by studies using specific inhibitors against PTP that have been shown to stimulate T cell activation (16Secrist J.P. Burns L.A. Karnitz L. Koretsky G.A. Abraham R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5886-5893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is of prime importance to gain more knowledge of the molecular events controlling the transcriptional state of the HIV-1 proviral DNA. A large array of cellular factors have been shown to interact with binding sites located within the 5′ regulatory region of the viral genome. Because an increase in both tyrosine phosphorylation and HIV-1 replication is seen following T cell activation, we were interested in seeing whether the induction of intracellular tyrosyl phosphorylation events, using new tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors, could modulate HIV-1 LTR activity. In the present study, we have made use of a set of pV compounds, which represent new potent structurally defined PTP inhibitors, and have demonstrated their capacity to markedly enhance HIV-1 LTR activity upon incubation with both T and monocytoid cells. Our results show that the induction is partly NF-κB-dependent and requires serine phosphorylation of the IκBα repressor. Cells were maintained in complete culture medium made of RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT), glutamine (2 mm), penicillin G (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml).

A. 1984; 81: 4169-4173Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar), HPB-ALL (18Koretsky G.A. Picus J. Thomas M.L. Weiss A. Nature. 1990; 346: 66-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar), and Molt-4 clone 8 (19Kikukawa R. Koyanagi Y. Harada S. Kobayashi N. Hatanaka M. Yamamoto N. J. Virol. 1986; 57: 1159-1162Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) cell lines. 1G5 and Jurkat-tat are clonal cell lines derived from Jurkat E6.1 cells stably transfected with a luciferase gene driven by an HIV-1 long terminal repeat and a tat expressing vector, respectively (20Aguilar-Cordova E. Chinen J. Donehower L. Lewis D.E. Belmont J.W. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1994; 10: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 21Caputo A. Sodroski J.G. Haseltine W.A. J. Acquired Immune Defic. Syndr. 1990; 3: 372-379PubMed Google Scholar). J1.1 and ACH-2 are latently HIV-1-infected cell lines derived from the parental cell lines Jurkat E6.1 and A3.01, respectively (22Perez V.L. Rowe T. Justement J.S. Butera S.T. June C.H. Folks T.M. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 3145-3148PubMed Google Scholar,23Clouse K.A. Powell D. Washington I. Poli G. Strebel K. Farrar W. Barstad P. Kovacs J. Fauci A.S. Folks T.M. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 431-438PubMed Google Scholar). The promonocytic cell line U1 was cloned from U937 cells surviving acute HIV-1 infection (24Folks T.M. Justement J. Kinter A. Dinarello C.A. Fauci A.S. Science. 1987; 238: 800-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar), and OM10.1 was similarly isolated from HL-60 (25Butera S.T. Perez V.L. Wu B.-Y. Nabel G.J. Folks T.M. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 4645-4653Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HIV-1 LTR-CAT stably transfected cell lines U38 and M311 each originate from U937 and Molt-4 cells, respectively (26Felber B.K. Pavlakis G.N. Science. 1988; 239: 184-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). HPB-ALL cells were provided by Dr. A. Weiss (Howard Hughes Medical Center, San Francisco, CA), and Jurkat E6-1 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). All other cell lines were supplied by the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, NIH (Rockville, MD). The pLTRX-LUC plasmid was kindly given by Dr. O. Schwartz (Unité d'Oncologie Virale, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France). The pLTRX-LUC plasmid contains a 722-base pair XhoI (−644)-HindIII (+78) fragment from HIV-1LAIplaced in front of the luciferase reporter gene (27Schwartz O. Virelizier J.-L. Montagnier L. Hazan U. Gene ( Amst .). 1990; 88: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). We have also used in our studies pLTR-LUC (HIV-1 LTR from strain HXB2) and mutated NF-κB pmκBLTR-LUC plasmids, which were kindly provided by Dr. Calame (Columbia University, NY). These molecular constructs contain the luciferase reporter gene under the control of wild-type (GGGACTTTCC) or NF-κB mutated (CTCACTTTCC) HIV-1 LTR (28Henderson A.J. Zou X. Calame K.L. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5337-5344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The wild-type and dominant negative IκBα expressing vectors pCMV-IκBα and pCMV-IκBα S32A/36A have been described previously (29Sun S.-H. Elwood J. Greene W.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1058-1065Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pκB-TATA-LUC contains the minimal HIV-1 κB region and a TATA box placed upstream of the luciferase reporter gene (29Sun S.-H. Elwood J. Greene W.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1058-1065Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These three latter molecular constructs were generous gifts from Dr. W. C. Greene (The J. Gladstone Institutes, San Francisco). Carrier DNA (herring sperm DNA) was purchased from Sigma. pV molecules were prepared as described previously (30Posner B.I. Faure R. Burgess J.W. Bevan A.P. Lachance D. Zhang-Sun G. Fantus I.G. Ng J.B. Hall D.A. Lum B.S. Shaver A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4596-4604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, V2O5 was dissolved in an aqueous KOH solution and then mixed with 30% H2O2 and the respective ancillary ligand in addition to the ethanol for optimal precipitation. Characterization of the pV molecules were carried out by infrared 1H NMR and vanadium-51 (51V) NMR spectroscopy. Stock solutions of pV molecules (1 mm in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4) were kept at −20 °C until used. Sodium orthovanadate (Sigma) was freshly dissolved in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. To minimize variations in plasmid transfection efficiencies, transfected cells were pooled 24 h after transfection and were next separated into various treatment groups. Cells (5–10 × 106) were first washed once in a TS buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm KCl, 0.6 mm Na2HPO4, 0.5 mmMgCl2, and 0.7 mm CaCl2) and resuspended in 0.5–1 ml of TS containing 15–30 μg of the indicated plasmid(s) and 500 μg/ml of DEAE-dextran (final concentration). The cells/TS/plasmid/DEAE-dextran mixture was incubated for 25 min at room temperature. Thereafter, cells were diluted at a concentration of 1 × 106/ml using complete culture medium supplemented with 100 μm chloroquine (Sigma). After 45 min of incubation at 37 °C, cells were centrifuged, resuspended in complete culture medium, and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Transiently and stably transfected cells were seeded at a density of 105 cells per well (100 μl) in 96-well flat-bottom plates. Cells were left untreated or were treated with the different peroxovanadium PTP inhibitors, bpV[HOpic], bpV[bipy], and bpV[pic] at specified concentrations (10 μm in most experiments), phytohemagglutinin (PHA-P at 3 μg/ml, Sigma), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α at 2 ng/ml, R & D systems, Minneapolis), or phorbol myristic acid (PMA at 20 ng/ml, Sigma) in a final volume of 200 μl. Next, these cells were incubated at 37 °C for either 8 or 24 h. All experimental points were done in triplicate. Cell viability was estimated by the (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt assay as described previously (31Buttke T.M. McCubrey J.A. Owen T.C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1993; 157: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Finally, luciferase or CAT activity was evaluated. Luciferase activity was determined following a modified version of a protocol (32Bérubé P. Barbeau B. Cantin R. Sékaly R.-P. Tremblay M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4009-4016Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, following the incubation period, 100 μl of cell-free supernatant were withdrawn from each well, and 25 μl of cell culture lysis buffer (25 mm Tris phosphate, pH 7.8, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100, and 10% glycerol) were added before incubation at room temperature for 30 min. An aliquot of cell extract (20 μl) was mixed with 100 μl of luciferase assay buffer (20 mmTricine, 1.07 mm(MgCO3)4·Mg(OH)2·5 H2O, 2.67 mm MgSO4, 0.1 mm EDTA, 270 μm coenzyme A, 470 μm luciferin, 530 μm ATP, and 33.3 mm dithiothreitol), and the sample was introduced into the counting chamber of a standard liquid scintillation counter equipped with a single-photon monitor software (Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA). Total photo events were measured over a 30-s time lapse. CAT assays were performed with the CAT enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay following manufacturer's recommendations (Boehringer Mannheim). Intracellular flow cytometry was performed as follows. Cells (5 × 105) were washed once in PBS, pH 7.4, and were resuspended in 100 μl of fresh complete culture medium before treatment with each peroxovanadium inhibitors (10 μm) for 30 min at 37 °C. Next, cells were washed once with PBS at room temperature and centrifuged 5 min at 300 ×g. Cell pellets were then fixed with 25 μl of reagent A (Fix & Perm cell permeabilization kit from CALTAG Laboratories, South San Francisco, CA) and incubated 15 min at room temperature. Cells were washed in PBS, resuspended with 25 μl of reagent B to which was added an anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (clone 4G10; Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY) or a rabbit anti-Tat antibody (antiserum to HIV-1 Tat from Dr. Brian Cullen, AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID, NIH), vortexed gently, and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were subsequently washed with PBS 1% NaN3 and resuspended with 100 μl of PBS containing a fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-mouse or chicken anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1 μg of total) and further incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Finally, cells were centrifuged and resuspended in 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS before being analyzed by flow cytometry (EPICS XL, Coulter Corp., Miami, FL). Cell surface CD4 expression was monitored as described previously (33Bernier R. Tremblay M. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 291-300Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Jurkat E6.1 (1 × 106cells/ml) were treated with the pV compound bpV[pic] (10 μm) at various times and were resuspended in lysis buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mmNaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 0.025 mm p-nitrophenyl guanidinobenzoate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 10 mm sodium fluoride. The homogenate was vortexed and incubated for 45 min on ice with intermittent mixing before centrifugation to remove cellular debris. Protein content was determined by the commercial BCA Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce). Cleared cellular lysates or immunoprecipitated samples were electrophoresed on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the gel was transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Mississauga, Ontario). Immunoblot detection was performed with either monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine P-Tyr-02 (a kind gift from Dr. Vaclav Horejsi, Institute of Molecular Genetics, Prague, Czech Republic), 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY), or PY20 (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) antibodies diluted 1:2000, or rabbit polyclonal antibodies specific for the C-terminal portion of IκBα (kindly provided by Dr. W. C. Greene, The J. Gladstone Institute, San Francisco, CA) diluted 1:6000. Detection was carried out using either peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse at a 1:20,000 dilution or peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-rabbit antibodies at 1:10,000 dilution. Immunoreactive bands were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Corp.). Jurkat E6.1 cells were treated at various times for up to 2 h with the pV compound bpV[pic]. Cleared cell lysates were first incubated with rabbit anti-IκBα antibodies overnight at 4 °C with intermittent mixing. Thereafter, protein G-Agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) were added and incubation at 4 °C with intermittent mixing was pursued for 3 h. Immune complexes were washed three times in lysis buffer without Nonidet P-40 before analysis by immunoblot assay. 1G5 cells were either left untreated or were incubated for different periods at 37 °C with the peroxovanadium compounds (10 μm). The incubation of 1G5 cells with the various stimulating agents was terminated by the addition of ice-cold PBS, and nuclear extracts were prepared according to the microscale preparation protocol (34Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 19: 2499-2500Crossref Scopus (2211) Google Scholar). In brief, sedimented cells were resuspended in 400 μl of cold buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After 10 min on ice, the lysate was vortexed for 10 s, and samples were centrifuged for 10 s at 12,000 × g. The supernatant fraction was discarded, and the cell pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of cold buffer B (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 420 mmNaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubated on ice for 20 min. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 ×g for 2 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant fraction was stored at −70 °C until used. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed with 10 μg of nuclear extracts. Protein concentrations were determined by the bicinchoninic assay with a commercial protein assay reagent (Pierce). Nuclear extracts were incubated for 30 min at 23 °C in 15 μl of buffer C (100 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 40% glycerol, 10% Ficoll, 250 mm KCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mmEDTA, 250 mm NaCl, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), 10 μg of nuclease-free bovine serum albumin fraction V) containing 0.8 ng of32P-5′-end-labeled double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) oligonucleotide. Double-stranded DNA (100 ng) was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase in a kinase buffer (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). This mixture was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C, and the reaction was stopped with 5 μl of 0.2m EDTA. The labeled oligonucleotide was extracted with phenol/chloroform and passed through a G-50 spin column. The dsDNA oligonucleotide, which was used as a probe or as a competitor, contained the consensus NF-κB-binding site corresponding to the sequence 5′-ATGTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′. A dsDNA oligonucleotide containing a mutated NF-κB-binding site (in bold and underlined) was also used for competition (5′-ATGTGAGCTCACTTTCCCAGGC-3′). Oligonucleotides were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). DNA·NF-κB complexes were resolved from free labeled DNA by electrophoresis in native 4% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 200 mm glycine, and 1 mm EDTA. The gels were subsequently dried and autoradiographed. Cold competitor assays were carried out by adding a 100-fold molar excess of homologous unlabeled dsDNA NF-κB oligonucleotide simultaneously with the labeled probe. Supershift assays were performed by preincubation of nuclear extracts with 1 μl of either preimmune serum (control) or specific antibodies in the presence of all the components of the binding reaction described above for 15 min at room temperature prior to the addition of the probe. Antibodies used are specific either to the p50 or p65 subunits of the NF-κB complex and were kindly provided by Dr. Nancy Rice (NCI, Frederick, MD). Reverse transcriptase activity was monitored as reported previously (33Bernier R. Tremblay M. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 291-300Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, ACH-2, J1.1, OM10.1, and U1 cells were seeded at a density of 105 cells per well in a final volume of 200 μl in a 96-well plate and treated with PMA (20 ng/ml) or the pV compounds (10 μm) for 24, 48, and 72 h. Enzymatic activity was measured with 50 μl of clarified supernatant fluid to which 10 μl of a solution A (5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm KCl, 0.05% Triton X-100) and 40 μl of a solution B (5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 m EGTA, 0.04 mg of poly(rA)-oligo(dT)12–18, 3 mCi of [3H]TTP (40–70 Ci/mmol)) had been added. After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C, samples were precipitated prior to filtration onto glass fiber filters by using a cell harvester system (Tomtec). The filters were dried, and radioactivity was measured in a liquid scintillation counter (1205/1204 BS Beta-plate; Wallac Oy, Turku, Finland). The assays were performed in triplicate. Statistically significant differences between groups were performed with the analysis of variance module of SAS software (version 6.07, SAS Institute, Cary, NC) using the Fisher least significant difference test. p values <0.05 were considered to be statistically significant (p values are given in the figure legends). All data are presented as mean ± S.D. Phosphorylation events have been shown to be important in several steps of the HIV-1 life cycle. This is probably associated with the fact that viral transcription is highly dependent on the intracellular environment (35Antoni B.A. Stein B. Rabson A.B. Adv. Virus Res. 1994; 43: 53-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We were interested in testing whether PTP could directly modulate HIV-1 LTR activity. To achieve such a goal, the standard PTP inhibitor sodium vanadate tyrosine was used along with new pV compounds (30Posner B.I. Faure R. Burgess J.W. Bevan A.P. Lachance D. Zhang-Sun G. Fantus I.G. Ng J.B. Hall D.A. Lum B.S. Shaver A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4596-4604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In our studies, we have used several structurally defined pV compounds, each containing an oxo ligand, two peroxoanions, and an ancillary ligand located in the inner coordination sphere of vanadate. To assess whether PTP inhibitors could modulate HIV-1 LTR activity, pV compounds bpV[HOpic], bpV[bipy], and bpV[pic] were incubated for 24 h with 1G5 cells. This cell line is derived from the Jurkat E6.1 cell line and contains an integrated construct made of the luciferase reporter gene under the control of the HIV-1LAI LTR. Sodium orthovanadate (Na3VO4), a commonly used PTP inhibitor, was similarly tested in this series of experiments. As shown in Fig.1, a weak increase in HIV-1-LTR-driven luciferase activity (2-fold) was obtained with 25 μm of Na3VO4 (Fig. 1, panel A). The mitogenic agent PHA was used as a positive control and was shown, as expected, to induce HIV-1 LTR activity (4.6-fold). However, the three pV derivatives used gave a significant increase in HIV-1 LTR-driven luciferase activity at a concentration of 10 μm (Fig. 1,panels B–D). When positioned in order of importance, fold increments induced by the PTP inhibitors were bpV[bipy] (3.2-fold), bpV[HOpic] (5.2-fold), and bpV[pic] (8.1-fold). Although fold increase showed some degree of variation between experiments (data not shown), the order and the proportional difference between the fold increase induced by the three PTP inhibitors in the 1G5 cell line were constant. When lower concentrations of the pV compounds were used (0.1 and 1 μm), no drastic HIV-1 LTR stimulation could be observed (Fig. 1). MTS assay for cell viability was performed in parallel and indicated no cytotoxic or cytostatic effect from the pV derivatives at 10 μm concentration (data not shown). Thus, these results indicate that pV compounds (bpV[bipy], bpV[HOpic], and bpV[pic]) drastically increase HIV-1 LTR activity and to a much greater extent than Na3VO4. To determine whether the difference in HIV-1 LTR activity correlated with the strength of the pV compounds to increase phosphotyrosine content, intracellular FACS analysis was performed with the anti-phosphotyrosine 4G10 monoclonal antibody. At concentrations lower than 10 μm, no significant chang"
https://openalex.org/W2042923803,"The H+-dependent AAP5 amino acid transporter from Arabidopsis thaliana was expressed in Xenopus oocytes, and we used radiotracer flux and electrophysiology methods to investigate its substrate specificity and stoichiometry. Inward currents of up to 9 “μ”A were induced by a broad spectrum of amino acids, including anionic, cationic, and neutral amino acids. The apparent affinity of AAP5 for amino acids was influenced by the position of side chain branches, bulky ring structures, and charged groups. The maximal current was dependent on amino acid charge, but was relatively independent of amino acid structure. A detailed kinetic analysis of AAP5 using lysine, alanine, glutamate, and histidine revealed H+-dependent differences in the apparent affinity constants for each substrate. The differences were correlated to the effect of H+concentration on the net charge of each amino acid and suggested that AAP5 transports only the neutral species of histidine and glutamate. Stoichiometry experiments, whereby the uptake of 3H-labeled amino acid and net inward charge were simultaneously measured in voltage-clamped oocytes, showed that the charge:amino acid stoichiometry was 2:1 for lysine and 1:1 for alanine, glutamate, and histidine. The results confirm that histidine is transported in its neutral form and show that the positive charge on lysine contributes to the magnitude of its inward current. Thus, the transport stoichiometry of AAP5 is 1 H+:1 amino acid irrespective of the net charge on the transported substrate. Structural features of amino acid molecules that are involved in substrate recognition by AAP5 are discussed.

Transport of amino acids across the plasma membrane of higher plants is mediated by proton-coupled transport proteins that utilize the electrochemical gradient for H+ to drive the uphill transport of amino acids (reviewed in Refs. 1Bush D.R.

Kinetic analysis of amino acid uptake into plasma membrane vesicles isolated from sugar beet leaves suggests the presence of four H+-coupled amino acid transport systems (5Li Z.-C. Bush D.R.

However, each exhibits a preference for amino acids possessing a particular molecular geometry or charge. Analysis of the substrate specificity of amino acid transporters in yeast cells and plasma membrane vesicles is traditionally accomplished by measuring the inhibition of amino acid transport activity by various substrates. Competition experiments yield information on substrates that interact with amino acid transporters, but do not allow a distinction between substrates that are transported and those that act as inhibitors. We previously analyzed the specificity and kinetic properties of theArabidopsis AAP1 H+/amino acid transporter by expressing the cloned gene in Xenopus oocytes and measuring substrate-induced currents using electrophysiology methods (13Boorer K.J. Frommer W.B. Bush D.R. Kreman M. Loo D.D.F. Wright E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2213-2220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). AAP1 transported anionic and neutral amino acids. However, except for histidine, the transport of cationic amino acids was negligible. In this study, we chose to investigate the specificity of theArabidopsis AAP5 H+/amino acid transporter, which shares 54“%” identity and 73“%” similarity with AAP1. Unlike AAP1, expression of AAP5 in yeast suggests that it efficiently transports anionic, neutral, and cationic amino acids (11Fischer W.-N. Kwart M. Hummel S. Frommer W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16315-16320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), making it an ideal candidate to investigate the effects of a broad spectrum of amino acids on substrate recognition. We expressed AAP5 inXenopus oocytes and used the two-electrode voltage-clamp method to determine the apparent kinetic parameters (maximal current (i max) and apparent affinity (K 0.5)) of various amino acids. For AAP5 and AAP1, a combination of electrophysiology and radiotracer flux methods enabled us to determine the H+:amino acid stoichiometry of neutral, cationic, and anionic amino acids, which revealed the net charge on the transported species. We show that 1) amino acid geometry and charge dramatically affect the substrate specificity of AAP5, and 2) AAP5 transports neutral, anionic, and cationic amino acids with a fixed H+:amino acid stoichiometry. Thus, the kinetic approaches used in this study enabled us to gain insights into the nature of the substrate-binding site and transport mechanism of AAP5. AAP5 and AAP1 were polyadenylated as described previously (13Boorer K.J. Frommer W.B. Bush D.R. Kreman M. Loo D.D.F. Wright E.M. J. Biol.

The resulting plasmids, pKAAP5 and pKAAP1, were linearized with KpnI, and capped cRNA was transcribedin vitro using T7 RNA polymerase and an RNA transcription kit (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX). Xenopus oocytes were isolated and injected with 25–50 ng (1 “μ”g/“μ”l) of cRNA encoding AAP5 or AAP1 or with 50 nl of water (control oocytes) and were maintained in Barth's medium for up to 5 days post-injection as described previously (13Boorer K.J.

The amount of amino acid transported into oocytes under non-voltage-clamp conditions was determined using a radiotracer method. Groups of 8–10 cRNA- or water-injected oocytes were incubated in transport buffer (100 mm choline chloride, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mmPIPES, 1The abbreviations used are: PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; HOMOPIPES, homopiperazine-N,N′-bis-2-(ethanesulfonic acid). and 10 mm HOMOPIPES) containing 0.032 or 10 “μ”m H+ and 100 “μ”m3H-labeled alanine, lysine, histidine, or glutamate (Amersham International, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). After 30 min at 22 °C, the oocytes were washed three times in 5 ml of ice-cold buffer and lysed in 10“%” sodium dodecyl sulfate, and the amount of radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. All experiments were done using the two-electrode voltage-clamp method (13Boorer K.J. Frommer W.B. Bush D.R. Kreman M. Loo D.D.F. Wright E.M. J. Biol.

The membrane potential was clamped at −50 mV, and steady-state currents were recorded 50 ms after the onset of voltage pulses ranging from −150 to 50 mV (20-mV increments). Steady-state amino acid-induced currents were obtained by taking the difference between steady-state currents in the presence and absence of amino acid. The apparent affinities for amino acids and protons (K 0.5aaand K 0.5H, respectively) and their maximal currents (i maxaa andi maxH, respectively) were obtained by fitting the steady-state amino acid-induced currents at each test potential (V m) to Equation 1, i=imaxS[S]on/([S]on+(K0.5S)n)Equation 1 where [S]o is the [amino acid]o or [H+]o,i maxS is the maximal current for saturating So,K 0.5S is the apparent affinity of the substrate (So giving half thei maxS), and n is the Hill coefficient. All fitting procedures were done using Sigma Plot software (Jandal Scientific, San Rafael, CA). To determine the H+:amino acid transport ratio, oocytes were voltage-clamped, and inward fluxes of 3H-labeled amino acids and net inward amino acid-induced currents were measured simultaneously (15Mackenzie B.

Loo, and E. M. Wright, manuscript in preparation. Throughout the experiment, substrate-induced currents were recorded using Fetchex software (Axon Instruments, Inc., Foster City, CA). Oocytes were clamped at potentials ranging from −10 to −90 mV and superfused with transport buffer at a rate of 160 “μ”l/min. Current traces were monitored until they reached a steady base line, after which 0.5 mm3H-labeled amino acid was superfused for 30 s to 10 min while recording the amino acid-induced current. The oocyte was washed in the absence of amino acid until the current returned to base-line levels. The oocyte was quickly removed from the chamber, washed three times in 5 ml of ice-cold buffer, and lysed in 10“%” sodium dodecyl sulfate, and the amount of radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. The total inward charge was calculated by subtracting the base-line current and integrating the area under the current versus time curve. The H+:amino acid transport ratio is presented as pmol of net inward charge/pmol of amino acid transport. The results are representative of experiments that were repeated at least three times with oocytes from different donor frogs. All experiments were carried out at 22 °C, and all amino acids used in this study were l-isomers. Chemicals were purchased from Sigma. The Cambridge Crystallographic Data Base was searched to obtain the x-ray crystal structures of the α-amino acids lysine, ornithine, histidine, cysteine, arginine, methionine, serine, threonine, glycine, leucine, glutamine, glutamate, alanine, citrulline, isoleucine, valine, proline, phenylalanine, aspartate, tryptophan, and asparagine. The crystal structure of homoarginine is not available, and this molecule was drawn using the molecular modeling program Hyperchem (Version 4.5, Hypercube, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada). The apparent kinetic parameters for various amino acids were obtained by expressing AAP5 inXenopus oocytes and measuring the steady-state amino acid-induced currents as a function of membrane voltage and external [amino acid]o at 10 “μ”m H+o. The amino acid-induced currents obtained at −150 mV were plotted against [amino acid]o, and the concentration/current curves were fitted to Equation 1. Table I shows the apparent affinity (K 0.5) and three-dimensional x-ray crystal structures of the amino acids. The K 0.5values for glutamate and histidine were adjusted to account for the net charge on the transported species: the neutral species of histidine and glutamate are transported by AAP5 (see below and ““”Discussion“””). AAP5 had the highest apparent affinity for arginine, histidine, homoarginine, and methionine (∼0.1–0.3 mm), followed by lysine, ornithine, alanine, and glycine (∼0.4–0.5 mm). Serine, glutamine, glutamate, citrulline, and cysteine all hadK 0.5 values <1 mm. TheK 0.5 values for threonine, homoserine (1.6 ± 0.1 mm), and leucine were higher, between ∼2 and 4 mm. For proline, hydroxyproline (32 ± 10 mm), tryptophan, and valine, theK 0.5 values increased by at least 2 orders of magnitude over that of arginine to between 20 and 33 mm. The current/concentration curves for isoleucine, phenylalanine, and asparagine were far from saturation even at 50 mm amino acido, with estimated K 0.5 values of ∼40, 80, and >100 mm, respectively. Neither aspartate nor the “β”-amino acids γ-aminobutyric acid and “β”-alanine were transported by AAP5. Aspartate does not interact with AAP5: the magnitude of the lysine-induced currents was the same in the absence and presence of 50 mm aspartate.Table IX-ray crystal structures and apparent affinity of AAP5 for amino acidsOocytes injected with AAP5 cRNA were voltage-clamped at −50 mV, and the steady-state amino acid-induced currents were obtained at different [amino acid]o at 10 “μ”m H+o. The current/concentration curves obtained at −150 mV were fitted to Equation 1 to obtain the maximal current (i max) and apparent affinity (K 0.5). The three-dimensional x-ray crystal structures were obtained form the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Base. The α-carboxyl and α-amino groups are shown on the left-hand side of the molecule, with the side chain extending to the right, and hydrogens and carbons have been omitted for clarity. The K 0.5 values ± error of the fit are shown.* Data not obtained. Open table in a new tab * Data not obtained. Fig. 1 shows a comparison of the maximal currents induced by amino acids as a percentage of the lysine-induced current. The highest i max values were obtained for lysine and ornithine, followed by histidine, arginine, and homoarginine. Except for tryptophan, which had an i max of ∼8“%” of the lysine-induced current, all other amino acids hadi max values between 30 and 50“%” of that for lysine. The activation curves for phenylalanine, isoleucine, and asparagine did not saturate. Thus, the i maxvalues for these amino acids are not included in Fig. 1. Fig. 2 shows representative, normalized current/voltage relationships obtained with 20 mm alanine, glutamate, histidine, and lysine at 10 “μ”m H+o. For each amino acid, the voltage dependence of the inward currents was identical: they increased supralinearly with membrane hyperpolarization, appeared to asymptote toward zero at positive potentials (more than +50 mV), and did not reverse. The qualitative and quantitative characteristics of the current/voltage curves were not altered when Na+ or Li+ was substituted for choline in the transport buffer at 0.032 and 10 “μ”mH+o. Negligible currents (<5 nA) were induced by amino acid application in oocytes injected with water. Alanine, lysine, glutamate, and histidine carry different net charges in solution over the range of [H+]o (0.032–10 “μ”m) used in this study (see Fig. 7 and ““”Discussion“””). Therefore, as a first step to investigate the effect of substrate charge on the specificity of AAP5, the apparent kinetic parameters for each amino acid were obtained by varying [amino acid]o at fixed [H+]o, varying [H+]o at fixed [amino acid]o, and fitting the concentration/current data to Equation 1. Fig. 3 A shows the normalized amino acid activation curves obtained at −150 mV and 10 “μ”mH+o. At test potentials between −150 and −30 mV and when [H+]o was decreased, the curves were hyperbolic with n = 1. Likewise, the H+activation curves obtained with alanine, lysine, and histidine were hyperbolic with n = 1 irrespective of the applied potential and [amino acid]o. However, the H+activation curves obtained with glutamate were sigmoidal. Fig.3 B shows representative H+ activation curves obtained with 20 mm amino acids at −150 mV and with 5 mm glutamate at −30 mV. Table II shows thatK 0.5H values determined in 20 mm alanine and lysine were lower than in glutamate and histidine, and when [amino acid]o decreased,K 0.5H increased. Thus, AAP5 had a very high apparent affinity for H+ (0.2 “μ”m, pH 6.7) when [lysine]o and [alanine]o were saturating such that both amino acids induced inward currents in the absence of a downhill H+ gradient across the oocyte plasma membrane (cytoplasmic [H+] = ∼0.04 “μ”m) (16Loo D.D.F. Hazama A. Supplisson S. Turk E. Wright E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5767-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Due to substrate-dependent differences in the apparent affinity of AAP5 for H+, apparent kinetic parameters were obtained at 0.032 and 10 “μ”m H+o for lysine and alanine and at 1 and 10 “μ”m H+o for glutamate and histidine. Mean kinetic values obtained from three experiments at −150 mV are shown in Fig. 4. Fig. 4 A shows that increasing [H+]o increased the maximal current for amino acids. A 300-fold increase in [H+]oincreased i maxLys 4-fold and i maxAla 5-fold; a 10-fold increase in [H+]o increasedi maxGlu 2-fold andi maxHis 1.5-fold. For each amino acid, the i maxaa versus voltage curves were supralinear (data not shown). Fig. 4 B shows that the apparent affinity constants decreased as [H+]o increased. A 300-fold increase in [H+]o decreasedK 0.5Lys from 1.5 to 0.4 mm and K 0.5Alafrom 6 to 0.5 mm. A 10-fold increase in [H+]o decreasedK 0.5Glu from 50 to 5 mm, whereas the decrease inK 0.5His was much less (3 to 2 mm). The K 0.5 values for histidine and glutamate shown in Table I were adjusted to account for the net charge on the transported species (see ““”Discussion“””).Table IIApparent affinity of AAP5 for H+20 mm amino acido5 mm amino acido0.2 mm amino acidoAlanine0.2 ± 0.05“—”2-a“—”, data not obtained.0.7 ± 0.07Glutamate3.9 ± 0.310 ± 1.6“—”Histidine0.44 ± 0.07“—”“—”Lysine0.2 ± 0.05“—”0.5 ± 0.05H+ activations were done at 0.2 and 20 mm lysine and alanine, 20 mm histidine, and 5 and 20 mmglutamate.

The apparent kinetic parameters were obtained from the concentration/current curves by fitting them to Equation 1. Values ofK 0.5H obtained at −150 mV are shown. As [amino acid]o increased, K 0.5Hdecreased. The steady-state kinetic analysis of AAP5 can be summarized as follows. 1) The transport of neutral, anionic, and cationic amino acids is electrogenic. 2) The voltage dependence of the saturating substrate-induced currents is the same, suggesting that a voltage-dependent step in the reaction cycle is independent of the net charge on the substrate. According to the models proposed for the H+/dipeptide transporter and the Na+/glucose cotransporters, this step is probably the reorientation of the empty carrier from the cytoplasmic to the extracellular surface (14Burkhardt B-C. Frömter E. Pflüegers Arch. 1992; 420: 78-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 17Jauch P. Laüger P. J. Membr. Biol. 1986; 94: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). 3) H+ and amino acids increased the i max andK 0.5 values for their respective cosubstrates. Positive cooperativity between the two ligands suggests that AAP5 operates via a simultaneous mechanism (18Boorer K.J. Loo D.D.F. Wright E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20417-20424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Also, H+ acts as an essential activator probably by orientating the amino acid-binding site to the external membrane surface (13Boorer K.J. Frommer W.B. Bush D.R. Kreman M. Loo D.D.F. Wright E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2213-2220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 15Mackenzie B. Loo D.D.F. Fei Y.-J. Liu W. Ganapathy V. Leibach F.H. Wright E.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 25139-25144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). To show that the inward currents induced by amino acids were due to their uptake into oocytes, radiotracer flux experiments were performed on unclamped oocytes with 100 “μ”m3H-labeled alanine, lysine, histidine, and glutamate at 0.032 and 10 “μ”m H+o. After 30 min at 0.032 “μ”m H+o, uptake was as follows: alanine ≥ lysine > glutamate ≫ histidine (108 ± 5, 94 ± 14, 46 ± 5, and 1.4 ± 0.3 pmol/oocyte, respectively). Thus, although glutamate-induced currents could not be measured at 0.032 “μ”mH+o, tracer experiments showed that glutamate is transported by AAP5 at low [H+]o. At 10 “μ”m H+o, uptake was as follows: alanine > lysine > glutamate > histidine (520 ± 47, 316 ± 29, 127 ± 5, and 76 ± 6 pmol/oocyte, respectively). These results were surprising since the currents induced by lysine were significantly higher than the currents induced by alanine, and both substrates had similar K 0.5values and voltage dependences at 10 “μ”mH+o. This suggests that an extra charge accompanies lysine transport and contributes to the magnitude of the lysine-induced current, which has important implications for the transport mechanism of AAP5. The steady-state kinetic data suggested that the H+:amino acid stoichiometry was 1:1 for alanine, lysine, and histidine, but >1:1 for glutamate. To determine the H+:amino acid stoichiometry directly rather than relying on Hill coefficients and to investigate the discrepancy between the magnitude of the steady-state currents and amount of substrate transported by AAP5, we simultaneously measured the amino acid-induced current and uptake of 3H-labeled amino acid in voltage-clamped oocytes. This method was chosen because it gives a more direct measurement of stoichiometry, whereas a thermodynamic approach requires a knowledge of the internal ligand concentrations. Fig.5 A is a typical current trace obtained from an oocyte voltage-clamped at −50 mV and superfused with 0.5 mm [3H]lysine at 10 “μ”mH+o. Addition of lysine to the oocyte transport buffer induced a large inward current (∼600 nA) that declined with time. When lysine was removed, the currents returned to the base-line levels. The current traces were qualitatively similar irrespective of the amino acid under investigation. Under voltage-clamp conditions, amino acids accumulated above [amino acid]o. For example, oocytes clamped at −50 mV and superfused with 0.15 mmlysineo for 10 min accumulated lysine up to ∼15-fold (2.2 mm) above [lysine]o. This was calculated assuming that the volume of the stage V oocytes used in this study was ∼900 nl. The uptake of amino acids into voltage-clamped water-injected oocytes was negligible (<5 pmol, 5.0 “μ”m) over the same time scale. Fig. 5 B shows plots of amino acid transported (pmol/oocyte)versus amount of charge transported (pmol/oocyte) for oocytes superfused with 0.5 mm lysine or alanine and 10 “μ”m H+o at −50 mV. Regression analysis yielded straight lines with slopes corresponding to the charge:amino acid stoichiometry: 2.1 ± 0.04:1 (r 2 = 0.99) for lysine and 1.1 ± 0.07:1 (r 2 = 0.97) for alanine. Thus, the net single positive charges on lysine and, presumably, ornithine, homoarginine, and arginine contribute to the magnitude of their induced currents. At 10 “μ”m H+o and 0.5 mmlysine, the charge:lysine stoichiometry was voltage-dependent and increased from 1.9 ± 0.1:1 at −10 mV to 2.5 ± 0.05:1 at −90 mV. At 0.032 “μ”mH+o and 0.5 mm lysine, the charge:amino acid stoichiometry was 1.6 ± 0.03:1 at −90 mV. These results suggest that there is an uncoupled transport of protons through AAP5 and is supported by the increase in the base-line current when [H+]o was increased from 0.032 to 10 “μ”m (see Fig. 5 A). Fig. 6 shows a comparison of the charge:amino acid stoichiometries of AA4 P5 and AAP1 obtained with 0.5 mm3H-labeled amino acids and 10 “μ”mH+o at −50 mV. For both transporters, the transport stoichiometry of histidine, glutamate, and alanine was ∼1 charge:1 amino acid compared with ∼2 charges:1 lysine for AAP5 (AAP1 does not transport lysine) and are conclusive evidence that histidine is transported in its neutral form (see ““”Discussion“””). Assuming that the single inward charge accompanying the transport of each amino acid is due to the transport of H+, we conclude that the H+:amino acid stoichiometry (1:1) is the same irrespective of the net charge of the amino acid in solution. Expression of the H+/amino acid transporter AAP5 inXenopus oocytes enabled us to use electrophysiology and radiotracer flux measurements to determine 1) the preferred molecular geometry of amino acids for transport, 2) the net charge on the transported amino acid species, 3) the H+:amino acid coupling stoichiometry. To undertake a thorough investigation of the substrate specificity of AAP5, it was necessary to determine the net charge on the transported amino acid species. For each amino acid investigated under the experimental conditions used in this study (0.032–10 “μ”m H+o), the α-carboxyl and αamino groups were ionized, and their net charge was dependent on the nature of the side chain. Fig. 7 shows the effect of [H+]o on the distribution of charged species of alanine, lysine, glutamate, and histidine. About 100“%” of lysine carries a single net positive charge (cationic), and ∼100“%” of alanine carries no net charge (neutral). Glutamate is predominantly negatively charged (anionic). However, there is a significant amount of neutral glutamate (∼0.06“%” at 0.032 “μ”mH+o increasing to 15“%” at 10 “μ”mH+o). Between 0.032 and 10 “μ”mH+o, the amount of cationic histidine increases from 9 to 91“%”, and the amount of neutral histidine decreases from 91 to 9“%”. Of the other amino acids tested, arginine, ornithine, and homoarginine carry a net positive charge; the charge on aspartate is similar to that on glutamate; and the other amino acids are neutral. The stoichiometry data showed that, for both AAP5 and AAP1, a single net inward positive charge accompanied the uptake of alanine, histidine, and glutamate, whereas two inward charges were cotransported with lysine by AAP5. At 10 “μ”m H+o, the net charge on alanine is zero, and the net charge on lysine is +1. Assuming the extra inward charge was carried by H+, the H+:amino acid stoichiometry for alanine and lysine was 1:1 with the charge on lysine contributing to the magnitude of its induced current. Thus, AAP5 recognizes the cationic species of lysine and probably the cationic species of arginine, homoarginine, and ornithine. Since the neutral species of histidine is transported by AAP5, the values of K 0.5His obtained at 1 and 10 “μ”m H+o (3 and 2 mm, respectively) were recalculated. The amount of neutral histidine at 1 “μ”m H+o is 50“%” compared with 9“%” at 10 “μ”m H+o, yielding ““”real“”” K 0.5Hisvalues of 1.5 and 0.18 mm, respectively. Also, the H+ activation data for histidine shown in Table II must be re-examined. These data were obtained by varying [H+]o at fixed [histidine]o. However, to obtain H+ activation data using the same concentration of neutral histidine (e.g. 20 mm), we would need to vary [H+]o and[histidine]o. The stoichiometry data suggest either that neutral glutamate is transported with one proton or that anionic glutamate is transported with two protons. The glutamate activation curves obtained at fixed [H+]o were hyperbolic, whereas the H+activation curves obtained at fixed [glutamate]o were sigmoidal, suggesting that the H+:amino acid stoichiometry was >1:1. However, when [H+]o was decreased from 10 to 1 “μ”m,K 0.5Glu increased 10-fold, which is consistent with a decrease in the amount of neutral glutamate;K 0.5His increased only 1.5-fold over the same range of [H+]o. Thus, the shape of the H+ activation curves can also be explained if glutamate is transported in its neutral form. For example, a 20 mm glutamate solution would contain 12 “μ”mneutral glutamate at 0.032 “μ”m H+o and 3 mm at 10 “μ”m H+o (see Fig. 7), which would explain the observed lag in the H+activation curves. If glutamate is transported as the neutral species, the real K 0.5Glu at 10 “μ”m H+o is 0.75 mm, which is similar to the K 0.5 for glutamine (0.78 mm), a neutral amino acid that has a similar three-dimensional structure to glutamate (see Table I). Like histidine, the H+ activation data for glutamate shown in Table II must be re-examined using the same concentrations of neutral glutamate at each [H+]o. The stoichiometry experiments showed that, irrespective of the net charge on the transported substrate, amino acid transport by AAP5 occurs with a H+:amino acid coupling stoichiometry of 1:1. Our results for histidine concur with those of Wyse and Komor (20Wyse R.E. Komor E. Plant Physiol. ( Bethesda ). 1984; 76: 865-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), who concluded that neutral histidine is cotransported with 1 H+across the plant plasma membrane. However, the results for lysine contradict previous studies that suggested that the transport of lysine was facilitative (20Wyse R.E. Komor E. Plant Physiol. ( Bethesda ). 1984; 76: 865-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 21Kinraide T.B. Etherton B. Plant Physiol. ( Bethesda ). 1980; 65: 1085-1089Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Also, our steady-state kinetic data showed that lysine transport was H+-coupled: increasing [H+]o decreasedK 0.5Lys and increasedi maxLys; lysine transport was concentrative; and a 1 H+:1 lysine coupling ratio was predicted from the hyperbolic lysine and H+ activation curves (n = 1). Similarly, Sanders et al.(22Sanders D. Slayman C.L. Pall M.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 735: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) showed that H+ accompanied the transport of cationic amino acids in Neurospora and that the H+:amino acid stoichiometry was the same for neutral and cationic amino acids. Based on activation curves, Mackenzie et al. (23Mackenzie B. Fei Y.-J. Ganapathy V. Leibach F.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1284: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) showed that the human hPEPT1 H+/dipeptide transporter cotransports anionic, cationic, and neutral dipeptides with 1 H+. That glutamate is transported in its neutral form with 1 H+ also contradicts the results of Kinraide and Etherton (21Kinraide T.B. Etherton B. Plant Physiol. ( Bethesda ). 1980; 65: 1085-1089Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Wyse and Komor (20Wyse R.E. Komor E. Plant Physiol. ( Bethesda ). 1984; 76: 865-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), who suggested that glutamate was cotransported with two cations. However, others have suggested that the neutral forms of anionic substrates are transported by the mammalian ASCT2 neutral amino acid transporter (24Utsunomiya-Tate N. Endou H. Kanai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14883-14890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar) and the mammalian hPEPT1 and rPEPT1 dipeptide transporters (25Fei Y.-J. Kanai Y. Nussberger S.

Clauss W. Daniel H. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 277: 831-839PubMed Google Scholar). As in amino acid transport into sugar beet leaves (7Li Z.-C. Bush D.R. Arch. Biochim. Biophys. 1992; 294: 519-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), the α-amino and α-carboxyl groups are essential for transport of amino acids by AAP5: γ-aminobutyric acid and “β”-alanine were non-interacting substrates. At 10 “μ”mH+o, the apparent affinity of AAP5 for amino acids ranged over 4 orders of magnitude (∼0.1 to >100 mm), and these differences were dependent upon amino acid structure and charge, but were independent of their hydrophobicity. AAP5 had a high apparent affinity for arginine, homoarginine, histidine, lysine, and ornithine, which are highly polar and, except for histidine, possess long linear side chains. Arginine and homoarginine have highly reactive, terminal guanidinium groups, which probably accounts for their high apparent affinity. Neutral, nonpolar methionine is also transported with high apparent affinity. Therefore, the substrate-binding site of AAP5 is relatively long and can accommodate amino acids >8 Å in length. Although citrulline, glutamine, and glutamate are polar molecules with long side chains, their apparent affinities were ∼4-fold lower compared with arginine, probably due to a slight destabilizing effect of the distal amide or carboxylate groups: distal amide or carboxylate groups are not discriminated by AAP5. That positively charged amino acids are transported with high apparent affinity is probably a consequence of their structure rather than the presence of the positive charge: methionine and citrulline are neutral amino acids. Reducing the length of the glutamine side chain by one carbon to yield asparagine dramatically decreased the apparent affinity by at least 3 orders of magnitude. Thus, an amide group on the δ-carbon yields favorable interactions with the substrate-binding site, whereas an amide group on the γ-carbon is in an unfavorable position for binding. Groups attached to the “β”-carbon were very important in determining substrate specificity. Two methyl groups on the “β”-carbon of valine decreased the apparent affinity by an order of magnitude over leucine, which has two methyl groups on the γ-carbon. Similarly, the apparent affinity for isoleucine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, and the imino acids (proline and hydroxyproline) was reduced by methyl groups, aromatic residues, or branching at the “β”-carbon. Adding a methyl group to the “β”-carbon of serine to give threonine decreased the apparent affinity by an order of magnitude, whereas a sulfhydryl on the “β”-carbon (cysteine) maintained a high apparent affinity. A hydroxyl residue on the γ-carbon was not as restrictive as a methyl group at this position: the apparent affinities for homoserine and hydroxyproline were not significantly different from those for serine and proline. AAP5 had a high apparent affinity for alanine and glycine, which are not branched at the “β”-carbon. Aspartate did not interact with AAP5, suggesting that substrate binding is prevented by a γ-carboxylate. This restriction was relaxed when the side chain was extended by one carbon to yield glutamate. Asparagine has a similar structure to aspartate, with a high electron density near the “β”-carbon. Thus, the apparent affinity for asparagine was very low (>100 mm). The i max values for lysine and ornithine were high compared with those for most other amino acids, with the single net positive charge carried by these amino acids contributing to the magnitude of their induced currents. Thei maxHis was ∼75“%” of the lysine-induced current. If we remove the contribution of the net single positive charge on lysine and ornithine to the magnitude of their inward currents, then AAP5 transports neutral histidine with the highest maximal transport rate. Positively charged homoarginine and arginine have considerably lower i max values than lysine and ornithine, probably due to the large, terminal guanidinium group, which may restrict their movement through the transporter. Except for tryptophan, the i maxvalues for the other amino acids were between 28 and 51“%” ofi maxLys. The bulky, aromatic side chain on tryptophan probably accounts for the low maximal rate of transport for this molecule. Why are the charged species of glutamate and histidine excluded by AAP5? Unpaired oxygens on the deprotonated form of glutamate and protonation of the imidazole ring of histidine may produce unfavorable steric interactions that block access to the substrate-binding site. The positive charge on the protonated imidazole ring lies ∼3.6 Å from the α-carbon, whereas for arginine, homoarginine, ornithine, and lysine, the positive charge lies at least 5 Å from the α-carbon. Although the three-dimensional amino acid structures may be altered in solution due to hydration, [H+]o at the substrate-binding site, and interactions with amino acid residues, the data suggest that charged groups close to the α-carboxyl and α-amino groups prevent substrate binding. Why is the neutral form of histidine transported with such high apparent affinity? Histidine, phenylalanine, and tryptophan all have bulky, aromatic rings with high electron densities close to the “β”-carbon, yet theK 0.5 values for phenylalanine and tryptophan are between 150- and 450-fold higher than that for histidine. Unlike phenylalanine and tryptophan, histidine possesses two nitrogen atoms in the imidazole ring, which must confer a high apparent affinity for AAP5. AAP5 has similar apparent affinities for histidine, arginine, and homoarginine, all of which possess two nitrogen atoms at their distal end. How do the results of this study relate to the transport of amino acids in Arabidopsis? Unfortunately, the composition of free amino acids in Arabidopsis is unknown. Aspartate, glutamate, and glutamine are found at high concentrations in many plants: up to 30, 90, and 20 mm, respectively, depending on the plant species (27Riens B. Lohaus G. Heineke D. Heldt H.W. Plant Physiol. ( Bethesda ). 1991; 97: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 28Winter H. Lohaus G. Heldt H.W. Plant Physiol. ( Bethesda ). 1992; 99: 996-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 29Leidreiter K. Kruse A. Heineke D. Robinson D.G. Heldt H.W. Bot. Acta. 1995; 108: 439-444Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In contrast, the concentration of lysine is typically low: <1 mm in sugar beet leaves (30Lohaus G. Burba M. Heldt H.W. J. Exp. Bot. 1994; 277: 1097-1101Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and ∼2 mm in barley leaves (28Winter H. Lohaus G. Heldt H.W. Plant Physiol. ( Bethesda ). 1992; 99: 996-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). With the exception of sink leaves, AAP5 is expressed throughout the plant, where it may play a central role in the high affinity transport of lysine. The low affinity amino acids will only be transported by AAP5 if they occur at high concentrations. Since AAP5 does not transport aspartate and since many of the low affinity amino acids such as valine, asparagine, and phenylalanine occur at low concentrations in plants, other members of the AAP family of amino acid transporters are probably responsible for the transport of these amino acids. For example, AAP1 transports valine, asparagine, and aspartate with K 0.5 values of ∼0.7, 25, and 80 mm. 3K. J. Boorer, unpublished observations. It will be interesting to correlate the apparent affinity of each AAP transporter and their expression pattern in Arabidopsis to the abundance of particular amino acids within the plant. We have shown that AAP5 recognizes and transports a broad spectrum of amino acids differing in geometry and charge, albeit with different apparent affinities and maximal velocities. Stoichiometry experiments enabled us to determine the charge on the transported amino acid species and showed that AAP5 transports anionic, cationic, and neutral amino acids via the same mechanism,i.e. with a fixed H+:amino acid coupling stoichiometry. Thus, in planta, the energy consumption for H+/amino acid transport will be independent of the net charge on the amino acid. Future experiments will include a detailed investigation of the substrate specificity of other members of the AAP family of transporters and mutant transporters to identify amino acid residues involved in substrate recognition."

In correlation with its placental expression, we show that hTEF-5 binds to several functional enhansons of the human chorionic somatomammotropin (hCS)-B gene enhancer. We define a novel functional element in this enhancer comprising tandemly repeated sites to which hTEF-5 binds cooperatively. In the corresponding region of the hCS-A enhancer, which is known to be inactive, this element is inactivated by a naturally occurring single base mutation that disrupts hTEF-5 binding. We further show that the binding of the previously described placental protein f/chorionic somatomammotropin enhancer factor-1 to TEF-binding sites is disrupted by monoclonal antibodies directed against the TEA domain and that this factor is a proteolytic degradation product of the TEF factors. These results strongly suggest that hTEF-5 regulates the activity of the hCS-B gene enhancer.

Thus, the TEF-4 expression pattern is distinct from that of TEF-3 but partially overlaps with that of TEF-1. Although no target genes for the TEF factors have been described in neural and mesenchymal tissues, these observations suggest that TEF-1 and TEF-4 may play a role in neurogenesis and in the development of several organs. Thus, considered together, the above results suggest that the TEFs may play partially redundant roles in several developmental processes. In addition to muscle-specific enhancers, putative TEF-binding sites have been noted in the placenta-specific human chorionic somatomammotropin (hCS; also called placental lactogen) B gene enhancer (42Walker W.H.

The hCS-B enhancer is active in the cytotrophoblast-derived JEG-3 cell line and is progressively activated during the differentiation of primary cytotrophoblasts to syncytiotrophoblastin vitro (46Jacquemin P. Alsat E. Oury C. Belayew A. Muller M. Evian-Brion D. Martial J.A. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 845-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This enhancer can be divided into two functional elements, DF-3 and DF-4, each of which have been postulated to contain TEF-binding sites. Point mutations affecting the putative TEF-binding site within DF-4 inactivate this element (46Jacquemin P. Alsat E. Oury C. Belayew A. Muller M. Evian-Brion D. Martial J.A.

The TEF-binding site in DF-4 is recognized by placental protein f (PPf) or chorionic somatomammotropin enhancer factor-1 (CSEF-1) (43Jacquemin P. Oury C. Peers B. Morin A. Belayew A. Martial J.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 93-103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 46Jacquemin P. Alsat E. Oury C. Belayew A. Muller M. Evian-Brion D. Martial J.A.

Eberhardt N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13906-13915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). By analogy to myogenesis, where muscle-specific TEF factors and target genes have been identified, a TEF factor(s) contributing to the function of placenta-specific enhancers may also exist. Here we report the cloning of hTEF-5, which is homologous to the B isoform of chicken DTEF-1 (33Azakie A. Larkin S.B. Farrance I.K. Grenningloh G. Ordahl C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8260-8265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and is expressed mainly in skeletal muscle and placenta. In correlation with this restricted expression pattern, we show that hTEF-5 binds to the M-CAT motifs of several muscle genes and to the TEF-binding site in the hCS-B DF-4 element. Furthermore, we have characterized a novel functional enhanson within the hCS-B DF-3 element composed of tandemly repeated binding sites to which hTEF-5 binds cooperatively. In the DF-3 element of the hCS-A enhancer, which is inactive in JEG-3 cells and syncytiotrophoblast, this enhanson is mutated by a naturally occurring single base change, which disrupts one of the conserved ATG cores and consequently hTEF-5 binding. We further show that PPf/CSEF-1 is immunologically related to the TEA domain and most likely corresponds to a proteolytic product of the TEF factors. Consequently, all of the factors identified to date interacting with the TEF-binding sites in the hCS-B enhancer belong to the TEA domain family. Together, these observations suggest that hTEF-5 is an important regulatory factor in the human placenta. Two degenerate oligonucleotides 5′-CCCAAGCTTGGC(A/C)GGAA(C/T)GA(A/G)(C/T)TGAT(A/C)GC-3′ and 5′-CCCAAGCTTC(A/G/C/T)A(G/A)(A/G/C/T)AC(C/T)TG(T/G/A)AT(G/A)TG-3′), corresponding to the TEA domain amino acid sequences GRNELIA and HIQVL, were used as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers with a cDNA library of human placental tissue as template. 30 cycles (1 min at 94 °C, 1.5 min at 40 °C, and 1.5 min at 72 °C) of PCR were performed under standard conditions in a 100-μl reaction volume with 200 pmol of each degenerate oligonucleotide primer, DNA from >106 plaque-forming units of phage, and 2 units of ampliTaq polymerase (Perkin-Elmer). Amplification products of the correct size were gel-purified and cloned into the TA cloning vector (Invitrogen). DNA sequencing was performed on an Applied Biosystems automated sequencer. TEF-specific probes for screening the placental cDNA library were generated by PCR using the degenerate primers described above and the partial hTEF-5 or full-length hTEF-1, hTEF-3, and hTEF-4 cDNAs as templates in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP. The cDNA library was screened by hybridization at 42 °C in 6 × SSC, 50% formamide. Filters were washed at 55 °C in 3 × SSC. Positive clones were picked and purified, and the cDNA was excised from λ ExLox (Novagen) by standard procedures. The DNA sequences of both strands of each clone were determined using internal primers. DNA and protein sequence analysis were performed using the GCG (Genetics Computer Group, University of Wisconsin) software package. The hTEF-5 open reading frame was amplified with appropriately positioned oligonucleotides containing a consensus Kozak sequence replacing the translation initiation isoleucine codon with ATG. The primers contained EcoRI or XhoI restriction sites, and the PCR fragment was cloned between the corresponding sites in pXJ41 (1Xiao J.H. Davidson I. Matthes H. Garnier J.M. Chambon P. Cell. 1991; 65: 551-568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The DNA sequence of the expression vector was verified by automated DNA sequencing. The expression vectors for the other human and mouse TEFs were as described previously (28Jacquemin P. Hwang J.J. Martial J.A. Dollé P. Davidson I J. Biol.

Human and mouse TEF-3A cDNA clones encoding the alternatively spliced isoforms were PCR-amplified with primers containingEcoRI/XhoI restriction sites as described above and cloned into pXJ41. The hCS-B DF-3 reporter constructs were constructed by PCR using oligonucleotides bearing the appropriate mutations. The resulting fragments were cloned upstream of the thymidine kinase promoter as described previously (43Jacquemin P. Oury C. Peers B. Morin A. Belayew A. Martial J.A. Mol.

For CAT assays, 2 μg of reporter constructs and 1 μg of the Rous sarcoma virus-luciferase vector as an internal standard were introduced into JEG-3 cells by lipofection. 48 h after transfection, cell extracts were prepared and luciferase values were determined. After correction for the luciferase values, CAT assays were performed and quantitated on a Fujix BAS 2000 apparatus as described (50May M. Mengus G. Lavigne A.C. Chambon P. Davidson I.

Transient transfection of 5′ and 3′ deletion constructs showed that the fragment −99/−33 of the GLUT1 gene drives transcriptional activity of the GLUT1 gene and participates in the reduced transcription after muscle differentiation. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed the binding of Sp1 protein to the fragment −102/−37 in the myoblast state but not in myotubes, and Sp1 was found to transactivate the GLUT1 promoter. Western blot analysis indicated that Sp1 was drastically down-regulated during myogenesis.

The formation of skeletal muscle during embryogenesis involves, first, commitment of mesodermal stem cells to the myogenic lineage. Myoblast cells, although undifferentiated and capable of continued proliferation, differentiate when they receive the appropriate environmental signals, fuse, and form multinucleate myotubes. At the same time as this morphological differentiation, a battery of adult muscle-specific genes whose products are required for the unique contractile and metabolic properties of the muscle fiber are activated (1Lassar A. Münsterberg A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 432-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 2Olson E.N. Klein W.H. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). The factors that regulate the expression of muscle-specific genes following commitment to terminal differentiation are well established. The best characterized are the members of the myogenic basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) 1The abbreviations used are: bHLH, basic helix-loop-helix; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; Id, differentiation inhibitor; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; CMV, cytomegalovirus; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; bp, base pair(s). 1The abbreviations used are: bHLH, basic helix-loop-helix; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; Id, differentiation inhibitor; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; CMV, cytomegalovirus; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; bp, base pair(s). protein family or MyoD family, that function as master regulators of muscle cell fate during development (2Olson E.N.

Each of these factors is expressed exclusively in skeletal muscle, and when expressed ectopically in a variety of non-muscle cell types, they activate the complete program of myogenic differentiation (2Olson E.N. Klein W.H. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). All the members of the myogenic bHLH family activate the transcription of muscle-specific genes by binding to the E-box consensus sequence (CANNTG) in muscle gene promoters and enhancers. However, not all muscle genes contain functional E boxes in their regulatory promoter regions, and myogenic bHLH proteins can also activate transcription of muscle-specific genes that lack E boxes in their control regions (3Edmondson D.G. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 268: 755-758Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). As expected, from these data, other muscle-specific transcription factors have been described to function as intermediates in the activation of gene expression during myogenesis, such as the M-CAT binding factor (11Mar J.H. Ordahl C.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4271-4283Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), and the myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) (12Gosset L.A. Kelvin D.J. Sternberg E.A. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell.

Myogenesis is also associated with down-regulation of several growth-regulated myoblast proteins, including c-Fos (14Trouche D. Grigoriev M. Lenormand J.L. Robin P. Leibovitch S.A. Sassone-Corsi P. Harel-Bellan A. Nature. 1993; 363: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), β- and γ-actins (15Hayward L.J. Schwarts R.J. J.

Cell. 1990; 61: 49-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1785) Google Scholar). In contrast to the wealth of information regarding the mechanisms that activate genes participating in the myotube phenotype, relatively little is known regarding regulatory sequences or factors involved in the control of the repression of the muscle embryo genes during muscle cell differentiation. Thus, it has been described that an activating transcription factor site is required for the expression of the Id2A gene in muscle cells, and that the binding of nuclear factors to the activating transcription factor site is decreased during myogenic differentiation (18Kurabayashi M. Dutta S. Kedes L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31162-31170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Glucose transporter expression is developmentally regulated in skeletal muscle (19Santalucı́a T.

Thus, during fetal and early postnatal life, GLUT1 is highly expressed in heart and skeletal muscles. Postnatal life is characterized by GLUT1 repression in muscle, which is concomitant with the induction of GLUT4 expression (19Santalucı́a T. Camps M. Castelló A. Muñoz P. Nuel A. Testar X. Palacı́n M. Zorzano A. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 837-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Similarly, it has been reported that myogenesis leads to induction of GLUT4 expression and repression of GLUT1 expression (21Mitsumoto Y. Burdett E. Grant A. Klip A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

However, the detailed mechanisms that contribute to GLUT1 repression during perinatal development and myogenesis are largely unknown. Here we have examined the mechanisms that repress GLUT1 expression during myogenesis. 125I-labeled protein A and [α-32P]-dCTP were purchased from ICN. 2-Deoxy-d-[3H]glucose was obtained from DuPont NEN. Hybond N was from Amersham Corp., and random primed DNA labeling kit was from Boehringer Mannheim. Immobilon was obtained from Millipore Corp. γ-Globulin and most commonly used chemicals were from Sigma. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), fetal-bovine serum, glutamine, and antibiotics were obtained from Whittaker (Walkersville, MD). L6E9 rat skeletal muscle cell line was kindly provided by Dr. B. Nadal-Ginard (Harvard University). C3H10T1/2 mouse cells stably transfected with MyoD were obtained from Dr. V. Andrés (St. Elizabeth's Medical Center, Boston). The plasmid containing the −2106/+134 region of the rat GLUT1 genomic sequence was obtained from Dr. M. Birnbaum (University of Pennsylvania). pCAT-basic vector was obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). pCMV-β-galactosidase vector was obtained from Dr. N. Brand (National Heart & Lung Institute, London). Plasmid CMV-Sp1 was a generous gift of Dr. R. Tjian (University of California, Berkeley). Rat skeletal muscle L6E9 myoblasts were grown in monolayer culture in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 1% (v/v) antibiotics (10,000 units/ml penicillin G and 10 mg/ml streptomycin), 2 mm glutamine, and 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. Confluent myoblasts were differentiated by lowering fetal bovine serum to a final concentration of 2% (v/v). Mouse C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts stably transfected with MyoD were grown as L6E9 cells in the presence of 0.5 mg/ml geneticin and differentiated in DMEM containing 5% (v/v) horse serum with antibiotics and geneticin. Cells were washed 2 times with PBS, scraped, and homogenized in 2 ml of ice-cold buffer containing 25 mm Hepes, 250 mmsucrose, 4 mm EDTA, 1 trypsin inhibitor unit/ml of aprotinin, 25 mm benzamidine, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm leupeptin, and 1 μm pepstatin, pH 7.4, using a Dounce A homogenizer. Homogenates were processed as previously reported (27Kaliman P. Viñals F. Testar X. Palacı́n M. Zorzano A. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) using γ-globulin as a standard. Before transport experiments, cells were incubated for 2 h in DMEM containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin. After this time, cells were washed, and transport solution (20 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 5 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mmKH2PO4, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 2 mm pyruvate, pH 7.4) was added, together with 100 μm 2-deoxy-d-[3H]glucose (96 mCi/mmol). After 20 min, transport was stopped by addition of 2 volumes of ice-cold 50 mm glucose in PBS. Cells were washed 3 times in the same solution and disrupted with 0.1 m NaOH, 0.1% SDS. Radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. Protein was determined by the Bradford method (28Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). Each condition was run in duplicate, and the nonspecific uptake (t = 0) was determined by incubation of the 2-deoxy-d-[3H]glucose in stop solution (50 mm glucose in PBS) instead of transport solution. In all cases, the value at t = 0 represented 4% of the basal transport activity at t = 20 min. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed in accordance with the method of Laemmli (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred to Immobilon as reported (30Camps M. Castelló A. Muñoz P. Monfar M. Testar X. Palacı́n M. Zorzano A. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 765-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Transfer was confirmed by Coomassie Blue staining of the gel after the electroblot. Rabbit Bb antiserum raised against the purified human erythrocyte glucose transporter (a gift of Dr. C. Carter-Su, University of Michigan) was used at a 1:400 dilution and was incubated with transferred protein overnight at room temperature in 1% nonfat dry milk, 0.02% sodium azide in PBS to detect GLUT1. An anti-Sp1 affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody (PEP-2, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used at a 5 μg/ml dilution in 1% nonfat dry milk, 0.02% sodium azide in PBS and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Detection of the immune complexes with the rabbit polyclonal antibodies was accomplished using 125I-protein A for 4 h at room temperature or using the ECL Western blot detection system (Amersham Corp.). Immunoblots were performed under conditions in which autoradiographic detection was in the linear response range. Total RNA was extracted using the acid guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform method as described by Chomczynski and Sacchi (31Chomczynsky P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar). All samples had aA 260/A 280 ratio above 1.8. After quantification, total RNA (30 μg) was denatured at 65 °C in the presence of formamide, formaldehyde, and ethidium bromide to allow the visualization of RNA. RNA was separated on a 1.2% agarose-formaldehyde gel and blotted on Hybond N filters. The RNA in gels and in filters was visualized with ethidium bromide by UV transillumination to ensure the integrity of RNA, to check the loading of equivalent amounts of total RNA, and to confirm proper transfer. Northern blot was performed as reported (27Kaliman P. Viñals F. Testar X. Palacı́n M. Zorzano A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19146-19151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The rat cDNA probe for GLUT1 was a 2,521 fragment obtained from Dr. M. Birnbaum (University of Pennsylvania) and was labeled with [32P]dCTP by random oligonucleotide priming. Plasmid 2,106/+134-CAT was constructed by inserting a 2,240-bp EcoRI-XhoI fragment containing the rat GLUT1 promoter region from positions −2,106 to +134 (relative to the transcription start site) into theXbaI site of pCAT-basic vector (Promega). pCAT-basic was digested with XbaI, filling in of the ends with dNTPs in the presence of the Klenow fragment, and treated with alkaline phosphatase. The GLUT1 promoter DNA fragment was filled in the presence of dNTPs and Klenow fragment and ligated to the pCAT-basic vector. 5′ deletions were generated by cleaving with HindIII at −1672 (−1672/+134-CAT), with HindIII and BstEII (−1203/+134-CAT), with HindIII and BanII (−812/+134-CAT), with HindIII and SmaI (−201/+134-CAT), and with HindIII and AocI (−99/−33-CAT), adding Klenow and T4 DNA ligase. The −33/+134-CAT construct was generated by obtaining a 28-bpHindIII-BssHII DNA containing the fragment −38/−15 from a 106-bp AvaII fragment (position −38/+68) of the GLUT1 promoter subcloned in Bluescript. The 28-bp fragment was subcloned into the BssHII site of theBssHII-G1CAT construct (−15/+134). The 3′ deletion constructs were generated by cleaving with XbaI andBfrI (−2106/+46-CAT) and with XbaI andBssHII (+2106/−15-CAT). 250,000 L6E9 cells were grown in 10-mm diameter plates for 2 days in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum. Monolayers were washed, and DNA transfection was performed by using the CaPO4 coprecipitation procedure (32Graham F.L. Van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (6464) Google Scholar). One ml of calcium phosphate DNA precipitate containing 10 μg of various deletion promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase constructs, 5 μg of pCMV-β-galactosidase control vector, and 20 μg of Bluescript DNA (pSK−, Stratagene), was added dropwise to the plate, and medium was added 15 min later. After 16 h, the cells were washed and incubated with 1 ml of 15% glycerol in Hepes-buffered saline for 3 min, washed with DMEM, and incubated with fresh complete medium for 72 h. For the myotubes, the medium was changed to differentiation medium (DMEM supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum) after the 15 min incubation with the DNA precipitate. The cells were washed 2 times with PBS and were harvested by scraping in 1 ml of STE (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA). The cells were collected by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge for 10 min, and the pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of 0.25 mTris, pH 7.5. The cells were lysed by 3 cycles of freezing and thawing at 37 °C. After centrifugation in a microcentrifuge for 5 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was stored at −20 °C. The CAT activity of 75 μl of cytoplasmic extract was measured by incubating 0.1 μCi of 14C-chloramphenicol, 1.3 mm acetyl-CoA, 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and the soluble extract for 3.5 h at 37 °C. At the end of the incubation, extraction into ethyl acetate and thin layer chromatography (33Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5286) Google Scholar) were performed. The CAT activity was quantitated using an InstantImager (Packard). β-Galactosidase activity was measured as described (34Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Preparation of the nuclear protein extracts was performed as described by Ausubelet al. (35Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.M. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates & Wiley-Interscience, New York1987Google Scholar). The DNA probe (fragment −102/−37) was obtained by digesting the −201/+134-CAT construct withAvaII, purifying the 66-bp fragment, and32P-end-labeled using the Klenow fragment of the DNA polymerase. The gel mobility shift assays were performed in a 12-μl reaction volume, containing 2 μg of double-stranded poly(dI-dC), 15,000 cpm of labeled DNA probe, 5–10 μg of protein of nuclear extracts, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10% glycerol, 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.25 mm dithiothreitol. The mixture (without the labeled DNA) was incubated for 15 min at room temperature. After the addition of the labeled DNA, the reaction mixture was incubated for another 10 min at 4 °C, immediately loaded on a 7% polyacrylamide gel (30:0, 8 acrylamide-bis-acrylamide), and run in 0.5 × TBE buffer (45 mm Tris, 45 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8) for 3–4 h at 8 V/cm. The gels were dried and autoradiographed. For competition assays, varying concentrations of unlabeled probe (fragment −102/−37) or the following oligonucleotides were used in the reaction mixture prior to addition of extract: oligonucleotide I (−100/−82), 5′-CCTCAGGCCCCGCCCCCCG-3′; oligonucleotide I mutated, 5′-CCTCAGGCCCCGTACCCCG-3′; oligonucleotide −55/−42, 5′-GCGCGGGCCAATGG-3′; and oligonucleotides containing the consensus site for Sp1 or AP2 (Promega). Supershift experiments were performed by incubating nuclear extracts or commercial human recombinant Sp1 protein (Promega), poly(dI-dC), and end-labeled probe as detailed above and then incubated for 30 min at 4 °C in the presence of 1 μg of Sp1 antibody (PEP-2, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or with an irrelevant antibody. The samples were loaded on a 4% polyacrylamide gel, dried, and autoradiographed. Differentiation of L6E9 myoblasts into myotubes was associated with a diminished rate of basal glucose transport (near 80% decrease) (Fig. 1). Under these conditions, the total cellular content of GLUT1 glucose transporter protein was also markedly reduced (levels in myotubes accounted for 22 ± 6% of values found in myoblasts) (Fig. 1). This is in keeping with previous observations performed in L6 muscle cells (21Mitsumoto Y. Burdett E. Grant A. Klip A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 175: 652-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 22Mitsumoto Y. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4957-4962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A reduction in GLUT1 mRNA levels was also detected in L6E9 myotubes compared with myoblast cells (levels in myotubes accounted for 33 ± 3% of values found in myoblasts) (Fig. 1). The reduction in GLUT1 protein and mRNA occurred under conditions in which no changes in the cellular content of β1-integrin protein or rRNA were detected (data not shown). To determine the basis for the repression of GLUT1 expression, myoblasts or myotubes were incubated in the presence of actinomycin D (5 μg/ml) for different time periods, and the levels of GLUT1 mRNA were assessed (Fig. 2 A). Results indicate that the half-life of GLUT1 mRNA species was near 5 h, and no differences between myoblast and myotube cells were detected (Fig. 2 A). Therefore, the reduction in GLUT1 mRNA levels during muscle cell differentiation is not due to alterations in the stability of GLUT1 mRNA. Next, myoblast or myotube cells were transiently transfected with a fragment of the GLUT1 gene promoter (−2106/+134) fused to the reporter gene CAT. Cells transfected with the reporter gene showed very low levels of CAT activity, similar to those shown by non-transfected cells (Fig. 2 B). Transfection with the construct −2106/+134-CAT in L6E9 myoblasts caused a 11.5-fold increase in CAT activity (Fig.2 B). Furthermore, CAT activity detected in myotubes was substantially reduced (60% decrease) compared with values in myoblasts (Fig. 2 B). These results indicate that the fragment −2106/+134 of the GLUT1 gene contains information that is relevant to transcriptional activity in the myoblast and that allows repression in response to myogenesis. To determine the cis-elements involved in the transcriptional activity of the GLUT1 promoter, 5′ deletion constructs of the GLUT1 promoter fused to the CAT reporter gene were generated and transiently transfected in myoblast and myotube L6E9 cells (Fig. 3). Deletion from −2106 to −812 of the GLUT1 gene caused no significant alterations in CAT activity (Fig. 3), and deletion from −812 to −201 caused nearly 60% stimulation of CAT activity, suggesting a repressor element (Fig. 3). The transcriptional activity of the −201 construct was maximal and only a slight decrease was noted after deletion from −201 to −99. However, deletion of a further 66 base pairs (from −99 to −33) led to a marked reduction (80%) in the transcriptional activity. The repression of transcriptional activity due to myogenesis was maximal in the −99/+134 construct although some differences were still found in the −33/+134 construct (Fig. 3). The −33/+134 construct contains the TATA box, located at −32/−27 relative to the transcription start site (36Williams S.A. Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19513-19518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To rule out the participation of the 3′-end of the fragment of the GLUT1 promoter which lies 3′ of the transcription start site, additional constructs were generated by 3′ deletion (Fig.4). Deletion of 88 base pairs lying between +134 and +46 caused a 60% reduction in transcriptional activity (Fig. 4), suggesting elements important for the transcriptional activity. Under these conditions, myogenesis reduced the transcriptional activity of all constructs studied (Fig. 4). These data indicate that the fragment −99/−33 is responsible for the transcriptional activity of the GLUT1 promoter. Furthermore, this fragment, together with the fragment containing the TATA box, seems to confer sensitivity to muscle cell differentation. The −99/−33 fragment of the GLUT1 gene contains one consensus Sp1 site, two AP-2-like sites, and one CAAT box (Fig. 6). To determine whether nuclear proteins bind to the fragment −99/−33 of the GLUT1 promoter, a DNA fragment encompassing the sequence −102/−37 was radioactively labeled, and EMSA assays were performed in the presence of nuclear extracts obtained from L6E9 myoblasts or myotubes (Fig.5). A number of specific bands was detected in nuclear extracts (Fig. 5). Some of them, named A1, A2 and B, were restricted to myoblasts, and others (complexes D1 and D2) were more abundant in myoblasts than in myotubes. In contrast, complexes C2 and D3 were more abundant in myotubes than in myoblasts (Fig. 5). C1 was the only complex to show a similar abundance in extracts from myoblasts and from myotubes (Fig. 5).Figure 5Specific binding of nuclear factors from L6E9 myoblasts and myotubes to the −102/−37-bp GLUT1 DNA fragment.Labeled AvaII-AvaII fragment (−102/−37) was incubated with 5 μg of nuclear extracts either from L6E9 myoblasts (MB) or myotubes (MT) after 7 days of differentiation and analyzed on a 7% polyacrylamide gel. The specificity of the complex formation was examined by addition of the 100 m excess of the unlabeled −102/−37 fragment used as a competitor. A representative autoradiogram is shown. Arrowsindicate specific complexes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To map the DNA elements that allowed the binding of the different complexes, EMSA assays were performed in the presence of an excess of unlabeled oligonucleotides (Fig. 6). EMSA assays performed in the presence of unlabeled oligonucleotide −100/−82 (oligonucleotide I), which contains the canonical Sp1 site, and an overlapping AP-2-like site displaced, in a concentration-dependent manner, complexes A1 and A2 found in myoblast extracts (Fig.7 A). No bands were displaced in the presence of the canonical sequence corresponding to the AP-2 site or with oligonucleotide −55/−42, which contains the CAAT box (data not shown). Next, we focused on the nature of the complexes A1 and A2, characteristic of myoblast extracts. Based on the presence of a canonical Sp1 site in position −92/−87, we searched whether binding of factors to this site might be responsible for complexes A1 and A2. EMSA assays were performed in the presence of an excess of unlabeled oligonucleotides containing a canonical Sp1 site (Fig.7 A). Under these conditions, complexes A1 and A2 were displaced very efficiently in the presence of 100-fold molar excess of the oligonucleotide Sp1 (Fig. 7 A). Furthermore, the incubation in the presence of an excess of oligonucleotide −100/−82 in which the Sp1 site was mutated (Fig. 7 A, oligonucleotideImut) failed to displace complexes A1 and A2 (Fig.7 A). Sp1 protein belongs to a family of zinc-finger transcription factors (37Hoey T. Weinzierl R.O. Gill G. Chien J.L. Dynlacht B.D. Tjian R. Cell. 1993; 72: 247-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, 38Kadonaga J.T. Jones K.A. Tjian R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1986; 11: 20-23Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (875) Google Scholar), and the formation of complexes in band-shift assay is sensitive to the presence of Zn2+ or EDTA in the medium (39Jensen D.E.

Based on this, gel-retardation analyses were performed in the absence or presence of Zn2+ or EDTA. The addition of Zn2+ to the medium increased the formation of complexes A1 and A2 in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 7 B). In contrast, addition of EDTA caused a concentration-dependent inhibition of complexes A1 and A2 (Fig. 7 B). To confirm the binding of Sp1 protein, super shift assays were also pe"

To date, all known ligand interactions are via the covalently attached glycosaminoglycan chains. To assay for potential extracellular interactions via the core proteins directly, the recombinant extracellular domain of syndecan-4 (S4ED), one of the four syndecan family members, was tested as a substratum for the attachment of mammalian cells. Human foreskin fibroblasts bind to mouse S4ED, and both mouse and chicken S4ED can block this binding, with 50% inhibition observed between 0.1 and 1 × 10−7m.

Syndecan-4, also known as ryudocan or amphiglycan, is one of four members of the syndecan family of cell surface proteoglycans. These type I transmembrane proteins are unified by their homologous transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains and the covalent addition of glycosaminoglycan chains, predominantly heparan sulfate, to their extracellular domains. Their heparan sulfate chains bind components of the extracellular matrix, such as fibronectin and collagen, as well as heparin-binding growth factors such as the FGFs 1The abbreviations used are: FGF, fibroblast growth factor; S4ED, syndecan-4 extracellular domain; mS4ED, mouse S4ED; cS4ED, chicken S4ED; mS1ED, mouse syndecan-1 extracellular domain; GST, glutathione-S-transferase; His, PET-30a vector-encoded His + S·Tag™ protein; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; HEPES/DMEM, HEPES-buffered DMEM (pH 7.4); BSA, bovine serum albumin; PCR, polymerase chain reaction.

In tissues, these proteoglycans show distinct expression patterns, although their expression can be overlapping and more than one syndecan family member may be found on a single cultured cell type (3David G. van der Schueren B.

Goldberger O.A. Gallo R.L. Bernfield M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 797-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). The syndecans are present at the plasma membrane and are also in the medium of cultured cells as a result of shedding the extracellular domain from the cell surface (7Kim C.W. Goldberger O.A. Gallo R.L. Bernfield M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 797-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 8Jalkanen M. Rapraeger A. Saunders S. Bernfield M. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 3087-3096Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Despite the emphasis on the binding of ligands to their glycosaminoglycan chains, the syndecan core proteins are also likely to have important roles in the regulation of cell adhesion and cell morphology. Syndecan-1 expressed in Schwann cells co-aligns with actin filaments in response to antibody ligation, a process dependent on a specific tyrosine residue within the syndecan-1 cytoplasmic domain (9Carey D.J. Bendt K.M. Stahl R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15253-15260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Syndecan-1 expressed in a B cell line enables the cells to bind and spread on heparan sulfate ligands and on core protein-specific antibodies (10Lebakken C.S. Rapraeger A.C. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 1209-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Antibody-mediated spreading does not require the cytoplasmic domain of syndecan-1 or its glycosaminoglycan chains, suggesting that the signals that convey syndecan-1-specific cell spreading result from interactions between the transmembrane and/or extracellular protein domains of syndecan-1 and other cell surface or transmembrane molecules (10Lebakken C.S. Rapraeger A.C. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 1209-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Engagement of cell surface proteoglycans, such as the syndecans, with other receptors may be a common growth factor and adhesion signaling mechanism. In FGF signaling, the high affinity signaling complex consists of a receptor tyrosine kinase(s), the FGF ligand, and heparan sulfate proteoglycans such as the syndecans (11Rapraeger A.C. Krufka A. Olwin B.B. Science. 1991; 252: 1705-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar, 12Olwin B.B. Rapraeger A. J.

Similar multi-molecular complexes may assemble during cell adhesion. NG2, a cell surface chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan, cooperates with α4β1 integrin in the development of focal adhesions (14Iida J. Meijne A.M. Spiro R.C. Roos E. Furcht L.T. McCarthy J.B. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2177-2185PubMed Google Scholar). Simultaneous engagement of NG2 and α4β1 signals melanoma cells to spread and form focal adhesions in a tyrosine kinase-dependent process. When either receptor is individually engaged, cells bind but fail to change shape. Similarly, the interaction between cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans and fibronectin stimulates focal adhesion formation but only in cooperation with integrins, such as the α5β1 integrin (15Woods A. Couchman J.R. Johansson S. Höök M. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 665-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 16Woods A. McCarthy J.B. Furcht L.T. Couchman J.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 605-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In this assay, the engagement of proteoglycan can be replaced by activating protein kinase C, suggesting that adhesive interactions with cell surface proteoglycans can lead to intracellular signaling events (17Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 101: 277-290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Syndecan-4, unlike the other syndecan family members, localizes to focal adhesions, implicating this proteoglycan as part of their signaling mechanism (18Woods A. Couchman J.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 19Baciu P.C. Goetinck P.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1503-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). To better understand how syndecan core proteins might regulate the formation of multi-molecular cell adhesion and growth factor signaling complexes, studies were undertaken to identify interactions between the extracellular protein domain of syndecan-4, the most widely expressed of the syndecan family members, and other receptors at the cell surface. Neonatal human foreskin fibroblasts were cultivated in DMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.), supplemented with 10% calf serum (Hyclone), and used prior to 60 days in culture. Dr. Merton Bernfield (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA) kindly provided the cDNAs encoding mS4ED and mouse syndecan-1 (7Kim C.W. Goldberger O.A. Gallo R.L. Bernfield M. Mol. Biol.

Chicken syndecan-4 cDNA was kindly provided by Dr. Paul F. Goetinck (Massachusetts General Hospital, Charlestown, MA) (21Baciu P.C. Acaster C. Goetinck P.F. J Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 696-703Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). His-mS4ED was constructed by cloning mS4ED into theBamHI (5′) and EcoRI (3′) sites of the pET-30a vector (Novagen), Full-length and truncated mS4ED, cS4ED (nucleotides 114–482) and mS1ED (nucleotides 291–989) cDNAs were PCR amplified using primers containing restriction enzyme sites, BamHI (5′) or EcoRI (3′), for cloning into pGEX-2T (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The EcoRI site is immediately preceded by the in-frame stop codon TAA. PCR amplified cDNAs were confirmed by sequencing. S4ED protein alignment, calculation of amino acid similarity, and homology searches were performed with Genetics Computer Group, Inc. software (PileUp, Gap, FastA) and the National Center for Biotechnology Information network service (BLAST), which access GenBank and EMBL sequence data bases. GST fusion proteins were isolated using glutathione-Sepharose beads according to the manufacturer's instructions for “bulk purification of fusion proteins” (Pharmacia) with the following exceptions. After induction, bacterial pellets were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) containing 25% sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Lysozyme (1 mg/ml) and 1% TX-100 were added, followed by sonication and DNase I (1500 NIH units) treatment prior to centrifugation. His-mS4ED protein was prepared similarly, except that purification was achieved by nickel chromatography (Qiagen) followed by imidazole elution. GST fusion proteins bound to glutathione beads were digested with 5 NIH units thrombin/mg fusion protein for 90 min at 4 °C, and thrombin was removed with benzamidine-Sepharose. Glutathione-eluted fusion proteins were quantified by absorbance at 280 nm. For GST and GST constructs containing mS4ED sequences, protein concentrations were calculated using the formula 1 A 280 = 0.5 mg/ml. For GST-cS4ED and GST-mS1ED, 1 A 280 = 0.4 mg/ml. His-mS4ED and thrombin-released peptides were quantified relative to a standard curve of thrombin-released mS4ED by Coomassie Blue or SYPRO®-Red (Molecular Probes) staining of proteins in polyacrylamide gels. High binding 96-well plates (Costar, 2585) were used for all cell binding assays. Recombinant proteins were diluted in HEPES/DMEM to 0.2 μm, unless otherwise noted, and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Plasma fibronectin was diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) to approximately 45 nm (10 μg/ml) and plated for 2 h at 37 °C. For the experiment shown in Fig. 2 B, the plating concentration of GST-mS4ED was 45 nm (1.75 μg/ml). Wells were blocked by incubating with HEPES/DMEM containing 1% heat-denatured BSA prior to the addition of cells. Cells were washed twice with HEPES/DMEM and treated with 25 μg/ml cycloheximide in HEPES/DMEM for 2 h prior to trypsinization. After washing with 20 mm Tris (pH 7.6) containing 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, and 25 μg/ml cycloheximide, cells were trypsinized for 2 min at 37 °C by incubating with 0.25% trypsin dissolved in the same buffer. The trypsin was inactivated by washing cells with 0.5 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor dissolved in HEPES/DMEM containing 25 μg/ml cycloheximide. For all experiments, 50,000 cells were added per well except for Fig.2 B, where 25,000 cells were added. Competing proteins were added to each well after blocking but prior to the addition of cells. Cell binding assays were performed at 37 °C in HEPES/DMEM containing 0.2% heat-denatured BSA and 25 μg/ml cycloheximide in a total volume of 100 μl/well. Nonadherent cells were removed by washing the wells three times with HEPES/DMEM. Fixed, adherent cells were quantified by colorimetric detection with 1% bromphenol blue (22Skehan P. Storeng R. Scudiero D. Monks A. McMahon J. Vistica D. Warren J.T. Bokesch H. Kenney S. Boyd M.R. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1990; 82: 1107-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (8981) Google Scholar). Recombinant mS4ED was engineered and expressed in bacteria, providing glycosylation-free core protein. Two independent expression vectors, each of which encodes mS4ED as a C-terminal fusion protein with distinct amino sequences, were used (Fig. 1 A). One encodes a GST fusion protein containing the entire 120-amino acid mS4ED attached to the GST C terminus. This construct also contains a thrombin cleavage site, allowing isolation and testing of the mS4ED domain (Fig.1 A). As another means of ensuring that the activity of the fusion protein is due to mS4ED alone, a second fusion construct was used, namely, His-mS4ED (Fig. 1 A) His-mS4ED is comprised of six histidines and an immunological tag (S·Tag™) at the N terminus of mS4ED. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the affinity purified protein products reveals one major protein band following purification of GST, GST-mS4ED, and thrombin-released mS4ED (Fig. 1 B). Immunoblotting with GST-mS4ED serum, which recognizes both mS4ED and GST, confirmed the identity of the protein bands and demonstrated that little, if any, GST protein contaminated the thrombin-released mS4ED preparation (data not shown). The His-mS4ED preparation contains three major protein bands. Only the slowest migrating band of the three reacts with GST-mS4ED serum, thus identifying this protein as intact His-mS4ED (data not shown). The two smaller proteins may represent co-purifying proteins or degradation products. All proteins containing mS4ED sequence migrate 5–7 kDa higher than their calculated molecular mass. This is not unexpected, as deglycosylated, full-length syndecan-4 has been shown to migrate with an apparent molecular mass 10–15 kDa greater than its actual molecular mass (3David G. van der Schueren B. Marynen P. Cassiman J.J. van den Berghe H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 961-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 23Kojima T. Shworak N.W. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4870-4877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, none of the minor contaminating bands in any one mS4ED preparation is visibly shared by all three mS4ED preparations (GST-mS4ED, His-mS4ED, and thrombin-released mS4ED). To detect interactions between recombinant mS4ED and other receptors at the cell surface, a solid phase cell binding assay was developed. Substrata were prepared by incubating microtiter wells with the various recombinant forms of mS4ED, including intact fusion proteins or thrombin-released peptide. After blocking, the individual substrata were assessed for their ability to support cell binding over time (Fig.2 A). Human foreskin fibroblasts, pretreated with cycloheximide prior to suspension with trypsin, bind avidly to all substrata containing mS4ED but fail to bind to a substratum composed of GST alone. Binding is maximal by 60 min at 37 °C, and greater than 75% of the input cells bind to GST-mS4ED. Binding occurs despite the presence of cycloheximide, suggesting that binding is via a trypsin-resistant cell surface receptor. To compare the binding of mS4ED to that of a known adhesive ligand, microtiter wells were coated with fibronectin. Cell binding was monitored over time and quantified (Fig. 2 B). At equimolar plating concentrations, the extent of cell binding to GST-mS4ED and fibronectin was comparable, although the kinetics of binding to GST-mS4ED were slightly slower. To assess the specificity and affinity of cell binding, soluble proteins were evaluated for their ability to compete in the binding assay. Binding to GST-mS4ED is reduced in a dose-dependent manner by GST-mS4ED (Fig.3 A). The IC50 in this experiment is 0.13 μm, suggesting that the interaction between mS4ED and its putative cell surface receptor(s) is of moderate affinity, similar to that of some integrins for their ligands (24Akiyama S.K. Hasegawa E. Hasegawa T. Yamada K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13256-13260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thrombin-released mS4ED peptide competes as effectively or better than the GST-mS4ED fusion protein (Fig. 3 B). Six independent experiments yielded an average IC50 of 0.04 μm for thrombin-released mS4ED, with a range of 0.01–0.1 μm (Fig. 4). The extracellular domain of another syndecan family member, syndecan-1, was also evaluated for its ability to compete for binding of cells to a GST-mS4ED substratum. Neither full-length GST-mS1ED nor thrombin-released mS1ED compete for binding when added at 13 and 3.5 μm, respectively (Fig.3, A and B). Interestingly, chicken syndecan-4 extracellular domain (cS4ED) competes as well as mS4ED (cloned from mouse) for binding of cells to GST-mS4ED (Fig. 3 A), suggesting that the cell binding domain of mS4ED is conserved across species.Figure 4The mS4ED56–109 fragment contains the cell binding domain. Increasing amounts of soluble proteins were added to wells coated with the GST-mS4ED ligand. Cell binding was quantified after 2 h as described under “Experimental Procedures.” All IC50 values were determined from triplicate dilution series. For thrombin-cleaved mS4ED amino acids 1–120, 1–80, 81–120, and 56–109, at least two separate experiments were performed with similar results. ND, not determined; NC, no competition at the concentration shown in the parentheses; striped box, signal sequence; solid boxes, amino acids 56–109 of mS4ED; open boxes, syndecan-4 core protein; stippled box, syndecan-4 transmembrane domain; vertical lines, glycosaminoglycan chains; arrowheads, amino acid positions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Although cells from both human and mouse species bind to GST-mS4ED, not all cell types bind, suggesting that the receptor(s) for mS4ED may be expressed in a cell type-specific manner. Cells that bind avidly to GST-mS4ED include human foreskin fibroblasts, mouse aortic endothelial cells, and mouse NIH 3T3 and Swiss 3T3 fibroblast cell lines. Cells that fail to bind include mouse NMuMG epithelial cells and the human Raji and ARH-77 B cell lines (data not shown). A domain containing the cell binding activity was identified by testing truncated mS4ED peptides as competitors in the cell binding assay. Complementary DNAs encoding mS4ED peptides were created by PCR amplification and were expressed as GST fusion proteins. IC50 values were calculated for both intact GST fusion proteins and their thrombin-released peptides (Fig. 4). Thrombin-released mS4ED and mS4ED56–109 compete equally well for cell binding to GST-mS4ED, demonstrating that amino acids 56–109 can fully replace the cell binding activity of the full-length mS4ED. Further, thrombin-released mS4ED1–80 and mS4ED81–120 compete 100-fold less effectively than mS4ED56–109. These two peptides together contain all 120 amino acids that constitute mS4ED but bisect amino acids 56–109, demonstrating that the cell binding domain is not reiterated within the mS4ED sequence and that the binding activity does not reside solely in either half of the mS4ED56–109 domain. Some thrombin-released peptides compete better than the GST fusion proteins from which they were derived, suggesting that proximity to GST can sterically hinder the cell binding domain. For example, GST-mS4ED and thrombin-released mS4ED compete with similar effectiveness, whereas GST-mS4ED56–109 competes 1000 times less effectively than thrombin-released mS4ED56–109. Importantly, thrombin-released mS4ED and thrombin-released mS4ED56–109compete identically. An alignment of the cloned syndecan-4 extracellular domains reveals the positioning and degree of conservation of amino acids 56–109 (Fig.5). Although chicken and mouse are only 34% identical within this domain, pairwise alignment of the sequences indicate similarity values ranging from 62 to 70%. The S4ED56–109domain begins 15 amino acids C-terminal to the last possible glycosaminoglycan acceptor site in the extracellular domain of syndecan-4. This distinguishes the cell binding domain spatially from the glycosaminoglycan acceptor sites. Syndecan-4 is expressed as a heparan sulfate proteoglycan and to a lesser extent as a hybrid proteoglycan bearing both heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate chains (3David G. van der Schueren B. Marynen P. Cassiman J.J. van den Berghe H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 961-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 18Woods A. Couchman J.R. Mol. Biol.

Shirakawa M. Mulligan R.C. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21204-21214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because heparin and chondroitin sulfate A, B, and C are unable to compete for binding of cells to GST-mS4ED (up to 100 μg/ml, data not shown), it seems unlikely that the glycosaminoglycan decoration of endogenous syndecan-4 would compete directly for cell binding domain interactions. Because no other proteins currently in the data base share significant homology to this region of syndecan-4, the interaction between amino acids 56–109 and the cell surface may be unique to syndecan-4. The cell binding activity of the syndecan-4 core protein constitutes a new class of interactions for the syndecans, namely, the association of the extracellular core protein domain of a syndecan and other cell surface molecules. This domain may interact with molecules on adjacent cells to mediate cell-cell adhesion or potentially function as a shed or matrix-embedded adhesive ligand. Because syndecan-4 is the major heparan sulfate proteoglycan to localize to focal adhesions, it is intriguing to speculate that the interactions mediated by the cell binding domain of syndecan-4 may regulate its localization to or the formation of such adhesion structures (18Woods A. Couchman J.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 19Baciu P.C. Goetinck P.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1503-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Given the propensity of the syndecans to homodimerize (26Asundi V.K. Carey D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26404-26410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 27Bernfield M. Kokenyesi R. Kato M. Hinkes M.T. Spring J. Gallo R.L. Lose E.J. Annu. Rev.

Olivecrona G. Reina M. Alonso A. Vilaró S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1771-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), it seems equally likely that the syndecan-4 cell binding domain might regulate the formation of other multi-molecular cell surface signaling complexes."

Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar) and was purified using easiRNA (Nuncleon kit, Scotlab) after treatment with DNase I. cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA with 0.5 μg of random hexamer primers using SuperScript reverse transcriptase according to the supplier's recommendations (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cDNA was amplified by PCR using primers that are specific for the extracellular domain of mouse TrkB (forward primer, 5′-TTCCGCTAGGATTTGGTGTAC-3′, nucleotides 628–648 in the sequence deposited in GenBank under accession no. X17647; reverse primer, 5′-GAGCAGCCAGACGTGCAGATG-3′, nucleotides 1101–1121). All amplifications were carried out in a volume of 50 μl usingTaq-polymerase in the supplied buffer (Promega); the primers were used at a final concentration of 1.5 μm. PCR was carried for 35 cycles of 45 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 62 °C, and 60 s at 72 °C. 20 μl of these reactions were run out on agarose gels. Amplified products that differed from the expected size of 494 bp (39Klein R. Parada L.F. Coulier F. Barbacid M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3701-3709Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar) (GenBank accession no. X17647) were recovered from agarose gel, cloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega), and sequenced. To determine if the L1 and L0 variants encode proteins that possess or lack the intracellular kinase domain, nested reverse transcriptase-PCR was carried out on newborn mouse brain polyadenylated RNA isolated using Poly(A)Tract mRNA isolation System (Promega). In the first PCR stage, single-stranded cDNA was amplified with forward primers specific for each variant and reverse primers specific for either the kinase domain-coding region or a COOH-terminal peptide coding region that is present only in the truncated isoform (39Klein R. Parada L.F. Coulier F. Barbacid M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3701-3709Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). PCR was carried out for 25 cycles of 45 s at 95 °C, 45 s at 58 °C, and 140 s at 72 °C. The forward primers specific for the L0 and L1 variants spanned the upstream and downstream sequences flanking the deletions in these variants (Fig. 1) and only anneal under the PCR conditions employed to cDNAs coding for these variants. The L0-specific primer was 5′-GAACATCACGGAAATGATCC-3′, and the L1-specific primer was 5′-GGAGAACATCACGGAAATAAAT-3′ (Fig. 1). The kinase domain-specific primer for first stage PCR was 5′-TGCTCTGGGCAGAGGTTGT-3′ (nucleotides 2181–2199 in the sequence deposited in GenBank under accession no. X17647), and the truncated peptide-specific primer for first stage PCR was 5′-CCTTTATCTCAGCTACCCATC-3′ (nucleotides 1423–1443 in the sequence deposited in GenBank under accession no. M33385). 5-μl aliquots from the first stage amplification reactions were used as a source of the DNA template for a second stage of PCR using the same L1-specific or L0-specific primer, and another primer from either kinase domain coding region or truncated peptide coding region was used for amplification of shorter fragments. The kinase domain-specific primer for the second stage PCR was 5′-AACTTTCCCGAAGGCTCCTT-3′ (nucleotides 2145–2164 in the sequence deposited in GenBank under accession no. X17647), and the truncated peptide-specific primer for this stage was 5′-CCAGTGGGATCTTATGAAACA-3′ (nucleotides 1403–1423 in the sequence deposited in GenBank under accession no. M33385). PCR was carried out for 25 cycles of 45 s at 95 °C, 45 s at 57 °C, and 140 s at 72 °C. For expression of the full-length TrkB that possesses a functional tyrosine kinase domain (designated L3-TK+ in this study) in fibroblast cell lines, full-length TrkB cDNA (gift of Rüdiger Klein) was subcloned into the pMEX vector in which its expression is driven by the strong promoter of the long terminal repeat of Moloney murine sarcoma virus. To produce the L0-TK+ and L1-TK+expression plasmids, the internal 475-bpMaeI-MaeII fragment of pL3-TK+ was replaced with the corresponding fragment from L0 and L1 variants cloned in the pGEM-T vector. These constructs were checked by sequencing before use. NIH 3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% calf serum. 1 μg of the expression plasmids (pL0-TK+, pL1-TK+, or pL3-TK+) and 10 ng of pSVneo were cotransfected into NIH 3T3 cells using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Two weeks after transfection, G418-resistant clones were isolated by the cylinder cloning technique. TrkB expression in these clones was analyzed by immunoblotting, and at least two clones expressing each of the L0, L1, and L3 variants at high levels were used in binding and surviving assays. Transformation assays involving cotransfection of TrkB variants and neurotrophin-encoding plasmids were carried out as described previously (7Klein R. Jing S. Nanduri V. O'Rourke E. Barbacid M. Cell. 1991; 65: 189-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar, 15Lamballe F. Klein R. Barbacid M.

Barbacid M. Neuron. 1992; 8: 947-956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) were gifts of Rüdiger Klein. Western blotting was used to detect TrkB protein in lysates of NIH 3T3 cells transfected with expression plasmids for full-length TrkB and the novel TrkB variants. Confluent 35-mm Petri dish cultures of transfected NIH 3T3 cultures were lysed in 0.2 ml of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis loading buffer and were boiled for 5 min. The proteins were separated on 8% polyacrylamide gels and blotted onto Hybond-polyvinylidene difluoride membranes in Tris/glycine/methanol buffer according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Corp.). After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, the membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in 4% skimmed milk, phosphate-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween 20. The same buffer was used for incubations with primary and secondary antibodies and between washes. Either of two primary antibodies were used: anti-TrkB polyclonal antibody (Transduction Laboratories, diluted 1:250) and pan-Trk antibody diluted 1:2,000 (gift of David Kaplan). The secondary antibody was a horseradish peroxidase-linked donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham, diluted 1:2,000). After washing the membranes three times in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween-20, ECL detection was carried out according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Corp.). NIH 3T3 cell lines expressing L3-TK+, L1-TK+, or L0-TK+ TrkB receptor isoforms were plated at a density of 1,000 cells/well in 96-well plates in DMEM supplemented with 10% calf serum. After 24 h, the cultures were washed twice with serum-free DMEM and were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 0.5% calf serum in the absence or presence of various concentrations of neurotrophins. The medium was changed, and fresh factor was added every day. At the indicated times, the number of viable cells was assessed using the MTT assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Colorimetry was performed using the MRX Microplate Reader (Dynatech). Purified recombinant BDNF, NT3, and NT4/5 (gifts of John Winslow, Gene Burdon, and Arnon Rosenthal, Genentech Inc.) were radiolabeled (1 μg of each) using 1 mCi of125I-Bolton-Hunter reagent (4,000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Corp.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The labeled protein was separated from unbound reagent by gel filtration through a Sephadex G-50 column using 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, containing 0.25% gelatin. Competition binding was carried out on cell suspensions as described previously (11Klein R. Nanduri V. Jing S. Lamballe F. Tapley P. Bryant S. Cordon- Cardo C. Jones K.R. Reichardt L.F. Barbacid M. Cell. 1991; 66: 395-403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar, 41Jing S.Q. Spencer T. Miller K. Hopkins C. Trowbridge I.S. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 283-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were harvested using a rubber policeman and washed once with ice-cold binding medium (DMEM containing 2.5% calf serum and 10 mmHEPES, pH 7.0). 2 × 105 cells were preincubated in 80 μl of binding medium at 4 °C for 1 h with or without unlabeled neurotrophin (10 nm for BDNF and NT4/5 and 100 nm for NT3). 20 μl of ice-cold 125I-labeled neurotrophins was added to each sample to reach a final concentration of 100 pm for BDNF and NT4/5 or 1 nm for NT3. After a 2-h incubation at 4 °C, the cells were washed four times with ice-cold DMEM containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, and were lysed in 100 μl of 1m NaOH. The cell-associated radioactivity was determined on a G5500 γ-counter. Transcripts encoding two novel TrkB variants that differ in their extracellular domains were identified in the course of using reverse transcriptase-PCR to study the expression of TrkB mRNA in embryonic mouse trigeminal ganglia. RNA from E14 ganglia was reverse transcribed and amplified as described previously (30Ninkina N. Adu J. Fischer A. Pinon L. Buchman V. Davies A.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6385-6393Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) using primers located in cysteine cluster I and the first immunoglobulin-like domain (Fig. 1). In addition to the expected 494-bp fragment based on the published sequence of TrkB (39Klein R. Parada L.F. Coulier F. Barbacid M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3701-3709Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar), several additional minor fragments were obtained. The two most abundant of these fragments (347 and 275 bp) were cloned and sequenced. Densitometry of autoradiograms showed that the mRNA containing the 347-bp fragment comprises 3% of the TrkB transcripts in E14 trigeminal ganglia, and the mRNA containing the 275-bp fragment comprises 2% of theTrkB transcripts in E14 trigeminal ganglia. Sequence analysis revealed that each had internal, in-frame deletions. The encoded proteins lacked either the first two LRMs (L1) or all three LRMs (L0) in their extracellular domains (Figs. 1 and2). In the L0 variant, there was an isoleucine to methionine substitution as the result of the splicing event and an additional 3-bp deletion 152 bp downstream of the main deletion (Fig.1). This deletion leads to the absence of Gly195 in cysteine cluster II. Alternative splicing is known to generate TrkB variants that lack the intracellular, catalytic, tyrosine kinase domain (20Klein R. Conway D. Parada L.F. Barbacid M. Cell. 1990; 61: 647-656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). To determine if the L1 and L0 variants encode proteins that possess or lack the kinase domain, nested reverse transcriptase-PCR was carried out on polyadenylated RNA isolated from newborn mouse brain using forward primers specific for each of these variants and reverse primers specific for either the kinase domain coding region or the COOH-terminal peptide coding region that is present only in the truncated isoform. Fig. 3 shows that fragments of expected sizes were amplified in all four primer combinations, suggesting that mRNA for all four variants (L0-TK+, L0-TK−, L1-TK+, and L1-TK−) is present in newborn mouse brain mRNA. To compare the neurotrophin binding and signaling characteristics of the L0 and L1 TrkB variants with full-length TrkB (designated L3-TK+ in this study), stable NIH 3T3 fibroblast cell lines expressing the tyrosine kinase domain containing forms of these variants (L0-TK+ and L1-TK+) were generated. Plasmids expressing these variants and the pSVneo plasmid were cotransfected into NIH 3T3 cells. After G418 selection, clones were checked for TrkB expression by Western blotting using two TrkB-specific antisera: one raised against the extracellular domain of TrkB (Transduction Laboratories) and a pan-Trk antibody (gift of Dr. David Kaplan) which recognizes the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain of all three Trk receptors. Clones that expressed a high level of TrkB protein (Fig. 4) were chosen for further experiments. The level of TrkB protein expressed in the L0-TK+ and L1-TK+ cell lines was similar to or greater than the amount of the wild type receptor in the L3-TK+ cell line. To confirm that ectopically expressed TrkB receptor variants are present at the plasma membrane of 3T3 cells, binding of antibodies against the extracellular and cytoplasmic domains was performed on nonpermeabilized and detergent-permeabilized cells followed by detection of bound antibodies with 125I-protein A. Nonpermeabilized 3T3 cells expressing L0-TK+, L1-TK+, or L3-TK+ variants (but not control, neo-transformed cells) bound antibodies against the extracellular domain. In contrast, binding of antibodies against the cytoplasmic domain required cell permeabilization (data not shown). This suggests that the expressed receptor variants are targeted to and appropriately oriented at the cell membrane. Stable NIH 3T3 cell lines expressing the L0-TK+, L1-TK+, and L3-TK+ variants were used for competitive binding assays using 125I-labeled neurotrophins as described previously (11Klein R. Nanduri V. Jing S. Lamballe F. Tapley P. Bryant S. Cordon- Cardo C. Jones K.R. Reichardt L.F. Barbacid M. Cell. 1991; 66: 395-403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar, 41Jing S.Q. Spencer T. Miller K. Hopkins C. Trowbridge I.S. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 283-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Fig. 5illustrates the results of experiments using at least two independently generated 3T3 lines for each of the L0-TK+, L1-TK+, and L3-TK+ variants. In agreement with previously reported results (11Klein R. Nanduri V. Jing S. Lamballe F. Tapley P. Bryant S. Cordon- Cardo C. Jones K.R. Reichardt L.F. Barbacid M. Cell. 1991; 66: 395-403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar), 3T3 cells expressing full-length TrkB (L3-TK+) bind all three ligands, BDNF, NT3, and NT4/5. Excess corresponding unlabeled neurotrophin completely abolished binding. In contrast, neither the L0-TK+ nor the L1-TK+ variant was able to bind any of these three ligands. Although we were not able to demonstrate neurotrophin binding to the L0-TK+ and L1-TK+ TrkB variants, the neurotrophin survival response of serum-depleted NIH 3T3 cell lines expressing these variants was used to investigate if neurotrophins could signal via these receptors at levels of binding which were undetectable in the above assays. In these experiments, the cell lines expressing TrkB variants were grown overnight in DMEM with 10% calf serum and switched to DMEM with 0.5% calf serum in the absence or presence of various concentrations of neurotrophins. The number of viable cells was then assessed at intervals using the MTT assay. Consistent with the binding experiments, BDNF, NT3, or NT4/5 did not enhance the survival of cell lines expressing the L0-TK+and L1-TK+ TrkB variants. In contrast, cell lines expressing full-length TrkB (L3-TK+) showed a respond to all three neurotrophins (Fig. 5). To investigate further potential interactions between neurotrophins and the L0-TK+ and L1-TK+ TrkB variants, NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were cotransfected with expression plasmids encoding the L0-TK+, L1-TK+, or L3-TK+ variant and expression plasmids encoding NGF, BDNF, NT3, or NT4/5 under the same promoter element. After 18 days, Giemsa staining was used to reveal transformation foci. In agreement with previous studies (16Ip N.Y. Stitt T.N. Tapley P. Klein R. Glass D.J. Fandl J. Greene L.A. Barbacid M. Yancopoulos G.D. Neuron. 1993; 10: 137-149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar), full-length TrkB (L3-TK+) elicited transformation when coexpressed with BDNF, NT3, or NT4/5 (Fig. 6). The greatest number of transformation foci was seen in cells cotransfected with full-length TrkB and BDNF or NT4/5, a smaller number was seen in cells cotransfected with full-length TrkB and NT3, and no foci were seen with full-length TrkB and NGF. In contrast, the L0-TK+and L1-TK+ TrkB variants were unable to transform NIH 3T3 cells either on their own or in cooperation with any of the neurotrophins (Fig. 6). We have isolated two novel TrkB splice variants from the embryonic mouse trigeminal ganglion. Both variants encode receptors with deletions of the LRMs in the extracellular domain. In the L1 variant, the first and second LRMs are absent, and in the L0 variant, all three LRMs are missing (Figs. 1 and 2). Although information about the organization of the mouse TrkB genomic locus is not yet available, the recently published structure of the chickenTrkB locus (35Strohmaier C. Carter B.D. Urfer R. Barde Y.A. Dechant G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3332-3337Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) has allowed us to map the L1 and L0 deletions. The positions of the deletions in these variants directly correspond with the boundaries of exons 2, 3, and 4 in the chickenTrkB gene (Fig. 1). An additional feature of the L0 variant is a deletion of three nucleotides in the position corresponding to the junction between exons 5 and 6 of chicken TrkB. These findings indicate that the organization of the mouse and chickenTrkB genes is very similar and that the L1 and L0 variants are generated by alternative splicing. Using reverse transcriptase-PCR with upstream primers specific to the L1 and L0 variants and downstream primers specific to tyrosine kinase or truncated peptide coding regions, we have demonstrated the expression in newborn mouse brain of transcripts encoding each extracellular domain variant with or without a tyrosine kinase domain (Fig. 3). We have shown that fibroblast cell lines expressing the L0 and L1 TrkB variants with intracellular kinase domains do not bind any neurotrophins and do not display any cellular responses to these ligands. However, cell lines expressing the full-length TrkB receptor (L3 variant, gp145) bind the appropriate TrkB ligands (BDNF, NT4/5, and NT3, but not NGF) and survive and undergo morphological transformation in response to these ligands. These results clearly demonstrate that the LRMs in TrkB are essential for ligand binding and signal transduction. Because the L1 variant, which possesses the third LRM, does not bind neurotrophins, it is likely that this essential function resides within the first and second LRMs, or the integrity of the whole domain is necessary. The relative importance of the different subdomains of the extracellular region of Trk receptor tyrosine kinases in mediating neurotrophin binding and discrimination is a highly controversial topic. The importance of the second LRM has been suggested from the results of binding studies using isolated LRMs. An immobilized peptide corresponding to the second LRM of TrkA specifically binds NGF, whereas a peptide corresponding to the second LRM of TrkB specifically binds BDNF, NT4/5, and NT3. The LRM2 peptide of TrkA specifically inhibits the binding of NGF to TrkA, whereas the LRM2 peptide of TrkB specifically inhibits the binding of BDNF, NT4/5, and NT3 to TrkB (42Windisch J.M. Auer B. Marksteiner R. Lang M.E. Schneider R. FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 125-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 43Windisch J.M. Marksteiner R. Lang M.E. Auer B. Schneider R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11256-11263Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 44Windisch J.M. Marksteiner R. Schneider R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28133-28138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Interestingly, neurotrophins fail to bind to immobilized peptides corresponding to the immunoglobulin-like domains in these assays (43Windisch J.M. Marksteiner R. Lang M.E. Auer B. Schneider R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11256-11263Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 44Windisch J.M. Marksteiner R. Schneider R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28133-28138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In contrast, studies of neurotrophin binding to chimeric Trk receptors suggest that the immunoglobulin-like domains contribute significantly to binding and ligand discrimination whereas the NH2-terminal sequences including the LRMs exert a minimal effect on binding. For example, NGF binds appropriately to a chimera consisting of the immunoglobulin-like domains from TrkA and the NH2-terminal sequences from TrkB but fails to bind to a chimera consisting of the immunoglobulin-like domains from TrkB and the NH2-terminal sequences from TrkA (45Perez P. Coll P.M. Hempstead B.L. Martin-Zanca D. Chao M.V. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1995; 6: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Similarly, TrkC chimeras in which the second immunoglobulin-like domain is exchanged for the homologous sequences in TrkB or TrkA bind BDNF and NGF, respectively, with high affinity (46Urfer R. Tsoulfas P. O'Connell L. Shelton D.L. Parada L.F. Presta L.G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2795-2805Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in studies of TrkA and TrkC, the second immunoglobulin-like domain alone binds with similar affinity to neurotrophins as their respective full-length receptors, and deletion of this domain abolishes neurotrophin binding (46Urfer R. Tsoulfas P. O'Connell L. Shelton D.L. Parada L.F. Presta L.G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2795-2805Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). An additional role for the second immunoglobulin-like domain of TrkB in ligand discrimination has come from the demonstration that a mutation (Cys345 → Ser345) in this domain abolishes the ability of NT4/5 to transform morphologically 3T3 fibroblasts expressing TrkB, whereas it has no effect on the transforming activity of BDNF (16Ip N.Y. Stitt T.N. Tapley P. Klein R. Glass D.J. Fandl J. Greene L.A. Barbacid M. Yancopoulos G.D. Neuron. 1993; 10: 137-149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). A similar mutation in TrkA influences ligand (NGF) binding and converts a nontransforming receptor into an active Trk oncogene (47Coulier F. Kumar R. Ernst M. Klein R. Martin-Zanca D. Barbacid M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4202-4210Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To make the story even more complicated, short deletions generated by alternative splicing in the region between the second immunoglobulin-like and transmembrane domains have been found in all three Trks (31Garner A.S. Menegay H.J. Boeshore K.L. Xie X. Voci J.M. Johnson J.E. Large T.H. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1710-1752Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Barker P.A. Lomen-Hoerth C. Gensch E.M. Meakin S.O. Glass D.J.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3332-3337Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Such deletions do not influence NGF binding to TrkA or BDNF binding to TrkB, but severely reduce binding of NT3 and NT4/5 (35Strohmaier C. Carter B.D. Urfer R. Barde Y.A. Dechant G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3332-3337Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), suggesting that regions downstream from the immunoglobulin-like domains are also involved in ligand discrimination. It is possible that the controversy about the role of LRM and immunoglobulin-like domains in neurotrophin binding originates from the different experimental approaches used in these studies. The conclusion that neurotrophins bind to LRMs but not to immunoglobulin-like domains was based on experiments using synthetic LRM peptides and bacterially produced LRMs and immunoglobulin-like domains (42Windisch J.M. Auer B. Marksteiner R. Lang M.E. Schneider R. FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 125-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 43Windisch J.M. Marksteiner R. Lang M.E. Auer B. Schneider R.

Chem. 1995; 270: 28133-28138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In contrast, the conclusion that the immunoglobulin-like domains are important was based on experiments in which Trk receptors were produced by eukaryotic cells (35Strohmaier C. Carter B.D. Urfer R. Barde Y.A. Dechant G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3332-3337Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 40Klein R. Lamballe F. Bryant S. Barbacid M.

Biol. 1990; 10: 4202-4210Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Because a number of post-translational modifications do not occur in bacterial expression systems, it is possible that their absence may account for the failure of neurotrophin binding to immunoglobulin-like domains produced in bacteria. However, our results clearly demonstrate in eukaryotic cells that LRMs are essential for ligands binding and that the immunoglobulin-like domains are not sufficient. It is important to note that in all experiments demonstrating the importance of the immunoglobulin-like domains in ligand binding, chimeric (swap) receptors were generated (35Strohmaier C. Carter B.D. Urfer R. Barde Y.A. Dechant G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3332-3337Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 45Perez P. Coll P.M. Hempstead B.L. Martin-Zanca D. Chao M.V. Mol. Cell.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2795-2805Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). This left the general structure of a receptor molecule relatively intact and presumably able to form functional dimers, which is thought to be the key event in Trk receptor activation (48Jing S. Tapley P. Barbacid M. Neuron. 1992; 9: 1067-1079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Furthermore, direct binding of neurotrophins to eukaryotically expressed immunoglobulin-like domains was achieved when two separate immunoglobulin-like domains were brought together side by side by linking them to the Fc portion of a human antibody, generating an artificial dimer (46Urfer R.

Because LRMs are known to be involved in protein-protein interactions in a variety of proteins (49Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Trends Biol. Sci. 1994; 19: 415-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar), it is possible that Trk dimerization brought about by the LRMs may be an early critical step in neurotrophin binding which facilitates specific interactions between neurotrophins and the immunoglobulin-like domains. The density of Trk receptors on neuronsin vivo is much lower than on cells overexpressing recombinant Trk proteins in culture. Under these circumstances, specific ligand binding to LRMs could accelerate dimerization, resulting in the formation of binding sites on the immunoglobulin-like domains or in “handing over” the neurotrophin to the immunoglobulin-like domains as was proposed previously (43Windisch J.M. Marksteiner R. Lang M.E. Auer B. Schneider R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11256-11263Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Increasing experimental data about neurotrophin-receptor interactions raise the possibility that it is a complex, multistage process. Further study of this process will lead to an understanding of neurotrophin signal transduction and the role of naturally occurring receptor variants.

Phosphorylation of these proteins is considered an important factor in the assembly of filaments and determination of filament caliber and stability. Mammalian neurofilaments are composed of three polypeptide subunits, NF-L, NF-M, and NF-H, all of which are phosphorylated. Here we used techniques for the mass spectrometric sequencing of proteins from polyacrylamide gels to analyze in vivo phosphorylation sites on NF-M and NF-L. Neurofilaments were isolated from rat brain and enzymatically digested in gel. The resulting peptides were analyzed and sequence data obtained by nanoelectrospray mass spectrometry. Four phosphorylation sites have been found in the C-terminal domain of NF-M: serines 603, 608, 666, and 766. Two of these are found in lysine-serine-proline (KSP) motifs and two in the variant motifs, glutamic acid-serine-proline (ESP) and valine-serine-proline (VSP). Serine 55 in NF-L was not found to be phosphorylated, which confirms the possible role of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of this site in early neurofilament assembly. The techniques used enable sequence data and characterization of posttranslational modifications to be obtained for each individual subunit directly from polyacrylamide gels.

Neurofilament (NF) proteins, a class of neuronal intermediate filament proteins, form the principal component of the axonal cytoskeleton. They are composed of three polypeptide subunits, NF-L (61 kDa), NF-M (95 kDa), and NF-H (115 kDa) (1Chin S.S.M. Liem R.K.H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 50: 475-490PubMed Google Scholar, 2Napolitano E.W.

Neurosci. 1990; 10: 3714-3726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with apparent molecular masses of 68, 150, and 200 kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, respectively. They share several structural features in common with all intermediate filament proteins: a highly conserved α-helical rod domain, essential for filament formation (4Geisler N. Kaufmann E. Fisher S.

The phosphorylated tails of these proteins are thought to protrude as side arms from the assembled filament, enabling cross-linking between filaments and interactions with other cytoskeletal proteins. These interactions have been shown to be regulated by phosphorylation (16Hisanaga S. Hirokawa N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21852-21858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Hisanaga S.

Phosphorylation of the tail domains is also thought to increase spacing between filaments, hence regulating axonal caliber (20Carden M. Trojanowski J.Q. Schlaepfer W.W. Lee V.M.-Y. J.

Thayer C. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1031-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Neurofilaments are also phosphorylated on their N-terminal head domains (25Sihag R.K. Nixon R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 457-464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Sihag R.K. Nixon R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4166-4171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This region of NF-L is known to be important in filament assembly (6Gill S.R. Wong P.C. Monteiro M.J. Cleveland D.W. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2005-2019Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 27Heins S. Wong P.C. Muller S. Goldie K. Cleveland D.W. J.

Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1337-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar), and phosphorylation of intermediate filaments at their head domains is a proven mechanism for the control of assembly (29Skalli O. Chou Y.-H. Goldman R.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1992; 2: 308-312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Serine 55 on NF-L has been found to be phosphorylated in vivo, yet it displays rapid turnover soon after NF-L synthesis (30Sihag R.K. Nixon R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18861-18867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These findings have led to the suggestion that this site may be involved to some extent in the regulation of filament assembly and architecture (12Nixon R.A. Sihag R.K. Trends Neurosci. 1991; 14: 501-506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 30Sihag R.K. Nixon R.A. J. Biol.

Saito T. Inagaki M. Hirokawa N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Abnormal phosphorylation of neurofilaments is associated with some neurodegenerative diseases such as motor neuron disease (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) and the Lewy bodies characteristic of Parkinson's disease and Lewy body dementia (33Pollanen M.S. Dickson D.W. Bergeron C. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1993; 52: 183-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 34Trojanowski J.Q. Schmidt M.L. Ryong-Woon S. Bramblett G.T. Rao D. Lee V.M.Y. Brain Pathol. 1993; 3: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 35Xu, Z., Cork, L. C., Griffin, J. W., and Cleveland, D. W. (1993)J. Cell Sci. , 106, Suppl. 17, 101–108.Google Scholar). Accumulations of highly phosphorylated neurofilaments, normally found only in axons, are observed in perikarya and proximal axons in these conditions. This suggests that aberrant phosphorylation may play a role in the pathology of these diseases. To understand the function and importance of neurofilaments as components of the neuronal cytoskeleton and their involvement in neurodegenerative disease, it is essential to comprehend the mechanisms by which these proteins are phosphorylated. Determination of the endogenous phosphorylation sites is therefore important as this information will lead to identification of the kinases involved. Previously, the analysis of sites of NFP phosphorylation has relied largely on conventional Edman sequencing following lengthy chromatographic separations or two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping of proteins radiolabeled with phosphate. Comparison of two-dimensional peptide maps of NF-L from optic axons of mice intravitreally injected with 32P with those from in vitro labeled NF-L has been used to characterize serine 55 as an in vivophosphorylation site on NF-L (30Sihag R.K. Nixon R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18861-18867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This involved HPLC purification and subsequent Edman degradation of a phosphopeptide common to both samples followed by in vitro phosphorylation and sequencing of a corresponding synthetic peptide to locate the exact site of phosphorylation. Serine 473 has also been shown to be an in vivo phosphorylation site on NF-L (36Xu Z.-S. Liu W.-S. Willard M. J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 1838-1846Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by Edman sequencing of HPLC-purified peptides from rat spinal cord corresponding to phosphopeptides labeled by in vitro phosphorylation. Six sites on the C-terminal domain of NF-M (37Xu Z.-S. Liu W.-S. Willard M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4467-4471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have been identified by comparison of NF-M peptides from in vitro 32P-labeled cytoskeletal preparations with those from metabolically labeled dorsal root ganglia. Peptides from unlabeled NF-M eluting at the same retention time as the labeled phosphopeptides were then sequenced by Edman degradation, and the phosphorylation sites were determined. Elhanany et al. (38Elhanany E. Jaffe H. Link W.T. Sheeley D.M. Gainer H. Pant H.C. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 2324-2335Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) used a combination of microsequencing and mass spectrometry to identify nine endogenous phosphorylated KSP sites in the C-terminal region of rat NF-H. Recently, a technique for the sequencing of proteins directly from polyacrylamide gels using electrospray (39Fenn J.B. Mann M. Meng C.K. Wong S.F. Whitehouse C.M. Science. 1989; 246: 64-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (6375) Google Scholar) in combination with tandem mass spectrometry (40Hunt D.F. Yates J.R.D. Shabanowitz J. Winston S. Hauer C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6233-6237Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar) has been developed (41Wilm M. Shevchenko A. Houthaeve T. Breit S. Schweigerer L. Fotsis T. Mann M. Nature. 1996; 379: 466-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (1507) Google Scholar). This allows sequence data and characterization of posttranslational modifications, using parent ion scans (42Wilm M. Neubauer G. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 527-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 43Carr S.A. Huddleston M.J. Annan R.S. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 239: 180-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), to be obtained from total digest mixtures using, exclusively, mass spectrometric techniques. Proteins are able to be uniquely identified with the use of peptide tags and data base searching (44Mann M. Wilm M.S. Anal. Chem. 1994; 66: 4390-4399Crossref PubMed Scopus (1318) Google Scholar). We have used this technology in conjunction with small scale immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) (45Andersson L. Porath J. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 154: 250-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar, 46Watts J.D. Affolter M. Krebs D.L. Wange R.L. Samelson L.E. Aebersold R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29520-29529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to identify phosphopeptides in digest mixtures of NFPs and then to characterize the sites of phosphorylation. Having covered more than 80% of the sequence of NF-L, no endogenous phosphorylation sites were found, suggesting dephosphorylation of the head terminal domain during filament assembly. Four endogenous phosphorylation sites have been found within the C-terminal domain of NF-M, including one that has not been previously reported. Except where otherwise noted, all chemicals used were purchased from Sigma and were of the highest quality available. Hydroxylapatite (HTP) was from Bio-Rad Laboratories Ltd. (Hertfordshire, UK). Acetic acid and formic acid (AnalaR grade) were from BDH Laboratory Supplies (Merck Ltd., Leicestershire, UK) The proteolytic enzymes trypsin (bovine, sequencing grade), endoproteinase Asp-N (from Pseudomonas fragi, sequencing grade), and endoproteinase Glu-C (from Staphylococcus aureus strain V8, sequencing grade) were obtained from Boehringer Mannheim UK Ltd. (East Sussex, UK). For mass spectrometric analysis and gel spot preparation, HPLC grade methanol and acetonitrile (Rathburn Chemicals, Scotland) were used. A Triton-X-insoluble pellet was prepared from about 15 g of rat brain by homogenization in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2, containing KCl (600 mm), EDTA (2 mm), EGTA (2 mm), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm), tetrasodium pyrophosphate (10 mm), sodium fluoride (20 mm), sodium orthovanadate (100 mm), and 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, at a ratio of 1:20 (w/v). After centrifugation (Sorval SS34 rotor, 15,000 rpm, 20 min, 4 °C), the pellet was washed by resuspension in the same buffer and then in the absence of Triton X-100. The final pellet was dissolved in buffer A (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, made up in 8 m urea containing 1 mmdithiothreitol), and batchwise HTP fractionation was performed as described (47Karlsson J.-E. Rosengren L.E. Haglid K.G. J. Neurochem. 1987; 49: 1375-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The eluate was dialyzed against buffer B (4m urea, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mmdithiothreitol), centrifuged (Beckman type 65 rotor, 50 krpm, 1 h, 15 °C), and loaded on to a Mono Q HR 5/5 column (Pharmacia Biotech Europe, Sweden). The sample was concentrated by eluting with a gradient of 0–100% 1 m NaCl in buffer B developed over 10 ml at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Approximately 50 μg of NFPs were separated by one-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using precast 8% acrylamide Novex (San Diego, CA) mini-gels (48Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207522) Google Scholar). Gels were stained with 0.2% (w/v) Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250 in 50% (v/v) methanol in water containing 2% (v/v) acetic acid and destained in 50% (v/v) methanol, 2% (v/v) acetic acid. Protein bands were cut from the gel, reduced, acetamidated, and tryptically digested as described (41Wilm M. Shevchenko A. Houthaeve T. Breit S. Schweigerer L. Fotsis T. Mann M. Nature. 1996; 379: 466-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (1507) Google Scholar). Peptides were extracted twice with 100 mmNH4HCO3 and acetonitrile followed by two extractions with 5% (v/v) acetic acid and acetonitrile and then dried. Additional gels were run in which samples were also subjected to enzymatic digestion using endoproteinase Glu-C (50 mmNH4HCO3, pH 7.8, 25 °C) and endoproteinase Asp-N (50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 37 °C) by the same method. Empty miniature Protein Chemistry Systems (PCS) desalting columns (Hewlett-Packard, Cheshire, UK) were packed with chelating Sepharose high performance slurry (70 μl in 20% (v/v) ethanol, Pharmacia) and washed with water (2 ml) followed by 0.1 m acetic acid, pH 3.1 (solution A, 500 μl). 0.1 m FeCl3 solution (50 μl in solution A) was applied followed by washing with solution A (500 μl) to remove excess iron. The dried peptide mixture in the gel digest was then loaded (dissolved in 50 μl of solution A), and the column was washed with buffer A (500 μl). The phosphopeptides were eluted with 0.1 m Tris-HCl (300 μl), pH 8.5, and the eluate dried before being analyzed by nanoelectrospray mass spectrometry. Needles for nanoelectrospray mass spectrometry were made with a micropipette puller (Sutter Instrument Co., Novato, CA) from borosilicate glass capillaries (Clark Electromedical Instruments, Pangbourne, Reading, UK) as described by Wilm and Mann (49Wilm M. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (1718) Google Scholar). They were gold-coated in a vapor desorption instrument. Dried protein digests were dissolved in 5% (v/v) formic acid and desalted on a miniature PCS column self-packed with ∼20 μl of POROS R2 sorbent (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) as described (41Wilm M. Shevchenko A. Houthaeve T. Breit S. Schweigerer L. Fotsis T. Mann M. Nature. 1996; 379: 466-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (1507) Google Scholar). The sample was not eluted directly into the spraying needle but was dried and then taken up in 10 μl of spraying solution (50% (v/v) methanol, 1% (v/v) formic acid in water for positive ion or 50% (v/v) methanol, 5% (v/v) ammonia in water for negative ion), and 1 μl was inserted into the needle. Electrospray mass spectra were acquired on an API III triple quadrupole machine (Perkin-Elmer Sciex, Ontario, Canada) equipped with a nanoES ion source developed by Wilm and Mann (49Wilm M. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (1718) Google Scholar, 50Wilm M.S. Mann M. Int. J. Mass Spectrom. Ion Processes. 1994; 136: 167-180Crossref Scopus (878) Google Scholar). Q1 scans were performed with 0.1-Da mass step. For operation in the MS/MS mode, Q1 was set to transmit a mass window of 2 Da for both parent and product ion scans, and spectra were accumulated with 0.2-Da mass steps. Dwell time was 1 ms for all scans except for parent ion scans, where it was 3 ms. Resolution was set so that fragment masses could be assigned to more than 1 Da. Collision energy was individually tuned for each peptide for optimum MS/MS spectra. A new needle was used for each experiment. Spectra interpretation was performed using BioMultiView (Sciex) software. NFPs purified from rat brain were run on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and NF-M and NF-L were tryptically digested in gel. After desalting on POROS, analysis of the total digest mixtures of NF-M and NF-L was performed by nanoES mass spectrometry. Fragmentation of peptide ions by collision-induced dissociation (CID) tandem MS resulted in partial sequences being obtained that, in combination with the mass, were sufficient to characterize unambiguously the peptides from the known protein sequences (1Chin S.S.M. Liem R.K.H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 50: 475-490PubMed Google Scholar, 2Napolitano E.W. Chin S.S.M. Colman D.R. Liem R.K.H. J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 2590-2599PubMed Google Scholar, 44Mann M. Wilm M.S. Anal. Chem. 1994; 66: 4390-4399Crossref PubMed Scopus (1318) Google Scholar). Phosphopeptides were isolated from the digest mixture using a small scale IMAC technique, which takes advantage of the affinity of phosphopeptides for immobilized Fe3+ ions (45Andersson L. Porath J. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 154: 250-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). Following small scale desalting, the samples were analyzed by nanoES MS/MS. Phosphopeptides were identified within the digest mixtures using scans for the parents of m/z 79 in negative ion mode (42Wilm M. Neubauer G. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 527-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 43Carr S.A. Huddleston M.J. Annan R.S. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 239: 180-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) and, for neutral loss of 49, [M–H3PO4 + 2H]2+, in positive ion mode (53Covey T. Shushan B. Bonner R. Schroder W. Hucho F. Jornall H. Hoog J.O. Gustavsson A.M. Methods in Protein Sequence Analysis. Birkhaeuser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland1991: 249-256Crossref Google Scholar). The parent ion scan shows ions that fragment to produce an ion at m/z 79 (the phospho group, PO3−). The neutral loss scan shows the masses of precursor ions that lose the phosphate group as a neutral fragment. The Q1 spectra of IMAC-purified samples mainly showed only ions corresponding to phosphopeptides in comparison with the total digest spectra (Fig. 1, A and B). A few non-phosphopeptides containing histidine residues were also seen, since histidine is thought to have some affinity to the packing used. The use of the IMAC column reduced the problem of electrospray ion suppression by reduction of the complexity of the peptide mixture. This reduction increased the phosphorylated peptide ion signal strength and thus improved the quality of the product ion spectra. Four phosphorylation sites, which must have been generated in vivo, were found within the C-terminal region of NF-M. Three of these, two in KSP motifs and one in the variant ESP motif, have been reported previously by Xu et al. (37Xu Z.-S. Liu W.-S. Willard M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4467-4471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) on the basis of metabolically labeled dorsal root ganglia. The fourth site has not been reported before in NF-M and lies within a VSP motif. Fig. 1 shows the identification of phosphopeptides in the NF-M tryptic digest. The total digest mixture was simplified by the use of IMAC (Fig. 1, A and B), and the resulting Q1 scan revealed several potential phosphopeptides (Fig.1 B). The parents of m/z 79 scan in negative ion mode was then used to further narrow the field of candidate phosphopeptides (Fig. 1 C) to five. The neutral loss of 49 scan in positive ion mode (Fig. 1 D) revealed an additional phosphopeptide and confirmed the presence of those identified in the parent ion scan. The peptides and sites of phosphorylation were then identified by CID tandem mass spectrometry in positive ion mode, resulting in product ion spectra (Fig. 2). Sequence tags were constructed from the resulting fragment ion masses, and hence peptides were identified from the published sequence (Table I, Ref. 2Napolitano E.W. Chin S.S.M. Colman D.R.

Open table in a new tab Phosphopeptides found within NF-M digests are shown. Peptides fragmented have residues found as a continuous Y“ or b ion series underlined. The identified phosphorylated residues are boldface. Fragmentation of the 3+ ion of P1 (m/z 769.6) in positive ion mode gave the partial sequence 603pSPVP from doubly charged Y“ ions (Fig. 2 A), which, from the known sequence, is sufficient to characterize the peptide and sites of phosphorylation as residues 601–620 with both serines phosphorylated (AK603pSPVPK608pSPVEEVKPKPEAK,M r 2305.3). Fragments corresponding to the loss of 608pS were also seen as singly charged b ions. MS/MS of the 3+ ion (m/z 742.1) of P2 resulted in doubly charged Y“ ions, giving the partial sequence SPVPK608pS, which confirmed the identity of the peptide as residues 601–620 with serine 608 phosphorylated (M r 2225.4). This indicates that serine 603 is heterogeneously phosphorylated within the NF-M molecule. The product ion spectrum of the 3+ ion of P3 (m/z676.0) displayed doubly charged Y“ ion fragments corresponding to the sequence VPK and confirming the identity of the peptide as residues 603–620 with serine 608 phosphorylated (M r2026.2). This is the expected site for phosphorylation on this peptide since trypsin has cleaved at lysine 602, which it may not have done had serine 603 been phosphorylated. Fragmentation of the 2+ ion of P4 (m/z 798.2) gave a full series of Y“ ions (Fig. 2 B), thereby characterizing the peptide as residues 757–771 and confirming that serine 766 is phosphorylated (GVVTNGLDV766pSPAEEK,M r 1594.6). The unphosphorylated form of this peptide was also characterized, again indicating heterogeneity of phosphorylation. The signal-to-noise ratio of the CID spectrum of P5 was not sufficient to produce any useful sequence information. CID MS/MS of the ion at m/z 546.4 corresponding to the 2+ of P6 gave a series of b ions (sequence VK) that enabled characterization of the peptide as KAE666pSPVKEK (residues 663–671, M r 1095.1.) with serine 666 carrying a phosphate. NF-M and NF-L were digested in gel with endoproteinases Glu-C and Asp-N. Desalted samples were analyzed by nanoES MS/MS, and the peptides were identified, thus giving greater sequence coverage for each protein. Total sequence coverage gained for NF-L was 81% and for NF-M, 64% (Fig. 3). Endoproteinase Glu-C-digested samples were subjected to IMAC and then analyzed by nanoES MS/MS. Scans for fragment masses characteristic of phosphopeptides were performed. The negative ion parents ofm/z 79 scan (not shown) revealed two phosphopeptides in the NF-M sample corresponding to phosphorylation at serines 603 and 608 (P8 and P9, Table I). The signal-to-noise ratio of the CID spectra of these peptides was not sufficient to produce any useful sequence information. Fragmentation in positive ion mode of the ion at m/z 738.4 seen in the neutral loss scan (not shown) gave sequence data corresponding to residues 600–612, with serine 608 phosphorylated (P7, Table I). 81% of the sequence of NF-L was covered by mass spectrometric sequencing; however, no phosphopeptides were found within the NF-L molecule. IMAC of the digest mixtures also failed to reveal any phosphopeptides. Upon phosphorylation with cAMP-dependent protein kinase, phosphorylated residues were identified within the NF-L molecule using this technique, 2J. C. Betts, K. E. Cleverley, W. P. Blackstock, and B. H. Anderton, manuscript in preparation. which suggests that the absence of endogenous sites was not due to a technical problem. These findings seem consistent with the notion that NF-L is mainly phosphorylated at its head domain and that these phosphates are removed before assembly into filaments. The glutamic acid-rich tail region of NF-L containing 74 residues, including serine 473, which has been found to be phosphorylated in vivo (36Xu Z.-S. Liu W.-S. Willard M. J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 1838-1846Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), could not be located despite the use of several different proteases. This may perhaps be due to incomplete digestion of this region or suppression of ionization of the peptides in the total digest mixture by these residues. Phosphorylation of neurofilament proteins is considered an important factor in the assembly of filaments, determination of filament caliber, and stability and plays a potential role in the pathology of several neurodegenerative diseases. Until now, conventional approaches have been employed in the analysis of phosphorylation of NFPs. These methods have involved metabolic labeling, either in vivo or of cultured neurons, and two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping or lengthy chromatographic separations after various enzymatic digestions. Phosphopeptides have then been sequenced and sites located by the use of conventional protein sequencing. These methods nearly always require the purification to homogeneity of often limited quantities of the neurofilament subunits and separation of the digest mixtures and are limited by the sensitivity of Edman degradation. Here we use techniques developed by Mann and co-workers (41Wilm M. Shevchenko A. Houthaeve T. Breit S. Schweigerer L. Fotsis T. Mann M. Nature. 1996; 379: 466-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (1507) Google Scholar) for the mass spectrometric sequencing of proteins directly from polyacrylamide gels, hence eleviating the necessity for subunit separation and enabling sequencing of peptides from a total digest mixture at lower sensitivity levels. The nature of the fragments generated by tandem MS of peptides allows unique characterization of the peptide, both from an unknown protein with the use of peptide tags and data base searching (44Mann M. Wilm M.S. Anal. Chem. 1994; 66: 4390-4399Crossref PubMed Scopus (1318) Google Scholar) and, as in this case, from a known protein sequence. Phosphopeptides were identified within the digest mixtures by the use of parent ion (42Wilm M. Neubauer G. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 527-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 43Carr S.A. Huddleston M.J. Annan R.S. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 239: 180-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) and neutral loss (53Covey T. Shushan B. Bonner R. Schroder W. Hucho F. Jornall H. Hoog J.O. Gustavsson A.M. Methods in Protein Sequence Analysis. Birkhaeuser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland1991: 249-256Crossref Google Scholar) scans. Once distinguished from the peptide mixture, the phosphopeptides could be fragmented during the same experiment, yielding sequence data and hence uniquely characterizing the peptide and site of phosphorylation. The extremely low flow rate of the nanospray technique (49Wilm M. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (1718) Google Scholar) requires the use of just 1 μl of sample/30 min of analysis and therefore enables the acquisition of a large quantity of sequence data with low sample consumption. A small scale IMAC technique was developed using mini-desalting columns, supplied empty (Hewlett Packard), which were self-packed with a small amount of chelating Sepharose high performance slurry (Pharmacia). This enabled small scale separation of phosphopeptides from the digest mixture due to their affinity for Fe3+ ions (45Andersson L. Porath J. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 154: 250-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar), resulting in improved sensitivity for the phosphopeptide ions and augmenting the quality of the sequence data obtained. This can be explained due to the fact that in a mixture of peptides, the more strongly ionizing components can often suppress the signal from those that are more weakly ionizing. Therefore, by reducing the complexity of the mixture by IMAC, the likelihood of suppression is also reduced (46Watts J.D. Affolter M. Krebs D.L. Wange R.L. Samelson L.E. Aebersold R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29520-29529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using these methods, we have characterized four phosphorylation sites within the C-terminal domain of NF-M and covered 64% of the sequence by mass spectrometric sequencing (Fig. 3). Three of the sites have been reported previously; two in KSP motifs and one in the variant motif, ESP. In addition, we have characterized a novel site found within a VSP motif that may also be phosphorylated by a proline-directed kinase. We have also been able to gain some insight in the heterogeneity of phosphorylation of some of these residues. Serine 603 has been found in both its phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms, as has serine 766. There is evidence to suggest that the phosphorylation of NFPs is heterogeneous (54Oblinger M.M. J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 2510-2521Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 55Lewis S.E. Nixon R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2689-2701Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and that the state of phosphorylation changes as the proteins are transported down the axon (56Nixon R.A. Lewis S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16298-16301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our results are in agreement with these findings and identify particular sites displaying this heterogeneity, although we cannot unambiguously rule out loss of phosphate during neurofilament manipulation. We have covered 81% of the NF-L sequence (Fig. 3) by mass spectrometric sequencing but found no sites of phosphorylation. The fact that no sites were found in the head region of NF-L seems to confirm the hypothesis that these sites undergo phosphorylation and dephosphorylation during filament assembly (12Nixon R.A. Sihag R.K. Trends Neurosci. 1991; 14: 501-506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 30Sihag R.K. Nixon R.A. J. Biol.

Brain Pathol. 1993; 3: 29-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), since we started with assembled neurofilaments for the preparation. When we phosphorylated NF-L with cAMP-dependent protein kinase, which is known to phosphorylate the head domain of NF-L (30Sihag R.K. Nixon R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18861-18867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 57Sihag R.K. Jaffe H. Rong X. Nixon R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6 (abstr.): 375Google Scholar), we were able to identify sites of phosphorylation by mass spectrometric sequencing,2 which suggests that the lack of endogenous sites found is a true result rather than a practical limitation. Some regions of the sequence of both proteins, namely those that are rich in glutamic acid residues, remain uncovered. This may be caused either by incomplete digestion or by poor ionization of these peptides due to the presence of these residues. In addition to phosphorylation, neurofilaments have been shown to be posttranslationally modified by O-linkedN-acetylglucosamine (51Dong D.L.-Y. Xu Z.-S. Chevrier M.R. Cotter R.J. Cleveland D.W.

Chem. 1996; 271: 20845-20852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The parent ion scan approach may also be used in the identification of glycopeptides in a digest mixture (42Wilm M. Neubauer G. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 527-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) as N-hexosamines give a characteristic oxonium ion at m/z 204. We have used this scan for parents of m/z 204 in the analysis of NF-M and NF-L but found no evidence of glycopeptides. This may be due to the relatively low amounts of these species within neurofilaments (51Dong D.L.-Y. Xu Z.-S. Chevrier M.R. Cotter R.J. Cleveland D.W. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16679-16687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 52Dong D.L.-Y. Xu Z.-S. Hart G.W. Cleveland D.W. J. Biol.

Chem. 1982; 257: 10467-10470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sensitivity of this technique, coupled with the ease and speed of sample preparation and analysis, should enable NFPs and other proteins to be analyzed for posttranslational modifications from a variety of sources. These may include cells stimulated to activate signal transduction cascades and tissue from diseases such as motor neuron disease."

Previously, circulating autoantibodies that activate signaling by cardiac muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) have been described. However, it remains unclear whether the chagasic IgGs directly interact with the m2 mAChRs (predominant cardiac subtype), and, if so, whether chronic exposure of the mAChRs to such activating IgGs would result in receptor desensitization. Here we performed studies with purified and reconstituted hm2 mAChRs and demonstrate that IgGs from chagasic serum immunoprecipitated the mAChRs in a manner similar to an anti-m2 mAChR monoclonal antibody tested in parallel. The chagasic antibodies did not directly interact with the ligand binding site, because the binding of radiolabeled antagonist was unchanged by the addition of the chagasic IgG. In intact cells stably expressing the hm2 mAChR, the chagasic IgGs, but not normal IgGs, mimicked the ability of the agonist acetylcholine to induce two effects associated with agonist-induced receptor desensitization: a decrease in affinity for agonist binding to m2 mAChR and sequestration of the hm2 mAChRs from the cell surface. The results demonstrate that the chagasic IgGs can directly interact with and desensitize m2 mAChRs and provide support for the hypothesis of autoimmune mechanisms having a role in the pathogenesis of Chagas' cardioneuromyopathy.

Most patients survive the acute phase of the disease asymptomatically; the chronic stage of the disease develops over 20–30 years and is manifested by cardiovascular, digestive, and autonomic nervous system disorders (3Koberle F.

The paradoxical severe involvement of the heart in the absence of any form of the parasite there has prompted proposals that autoimmune mechanisms participate in the pathogenesis of this cardiac neuromyopathy (12Acosta A.M.

This report focuses on the molecular events initiated by the interaction of the chagasic antibodies with the mAChRs to begin to understand how the antibodies could ultimately account for the abnormalities of cardiac autonomic function characteristic of the late stages of Chagas' disease. Previously, chagasic antibodies were shown to mimic agonists of mAChR to cause inhibition of cardiac contractility, stimulation of cGMP levels, and attenuation of cAMP synthesis (18Goin J.C. Borda E.S. Perez Leiros C. Storino R. Sterin-Borda L. J. Auton. Nerv. Sys. 1994; 47: 45-52Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 19Goin J.C. Perez Leiros C. Borda E.S. Sterin-Borda L. Neuroimmunomodulation. 1994; 1: 284-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Thus, the in vivo situation during the course of Chagas' disease could be similar to that of a persistent stimulus, i.e. circulating antibodies that activate cardiac mAChRs could result in receptor desensitization. Such a scenario could cause receptor/G-protein uncoupling and loss of receptors from the cell surface and explain the progressive blockade of receptors that is observed in the disease (20Iosa D.

Heart J. 1991; 122: 775-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we used both purified human m2 mAChRs and mammalian CHO cells transfected with human m2 mAChRs to assess the ability of chagasic IgG to directly interact with and desensitize the mAChR. The results support a role for the chagasic antibodies in causing loss of mAChR function. Trypanosoma cruzi-infected patients from metropolitan Buenos Aires were studied. These patients, classified as Group I based on WHO Expert Committee on Chagas' disease criteria (1WHO Expert Committee, Technical Report Series. 1991; 811: 1-10Google Scholar), had positive T. cruzi serology and the absence of clinical symptoms with normal electrocardiogram and chest x-ray. Among this group, sera were chosen for their previously demonstrated ability to activate rat atrial mAChR in an atropine-sensitive manner (18Goin J.C. Borda E.S. Perez Leiros C. Storino R.

Normal sera taken as controls were from volunteers who had negative serology for Chagas' disease, presented no evidence of cardiovascular or chronic systemic disease or acute viral or febrile disease, and had normal electrocardiogram and chest x-ray. The age of patients and controls ranged between 25 and 50 years. IgG was isolated from chagasic or normal sera by means of DEAE-cellulose chromatography (Bio-Rad) as shown (18Goin J.C. Borda E.S.

Sys. 1994; 47: 45-52Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and tested for purity by immunoelectrophoresis with goat anti-whole serum or anti-IgG antiserum (Sigma). The IgG concentration was determined by radioimmunodifussion assay. F(ab′)2 fragments were obtained from normal or chagasic patients by pepsin digestion of IgG fractions in 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.5) for 22 h at 37 °C, dialysis against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and chromatography on Sephadex G-200. Purification of IgG was assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoelectrophoresis. Human mAChRs (hm2 mAChR) from Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) insect cells infected with recombinant baculovirus encoding the human m2 mAChR were purified and reconstituted as described (22Haga K.

The m2 CHO cells were grown in 100-mm dishes, washed with PBS, and then allowed to stabilize for 10 min at 37 °C with serum-free fresh DMEM:F-12 containing 10 μm eserine (a cholinesterase inhibitor) before the addition of treatments to induce desensitization or sequestration. To assess the effects of chagasic sera to cause decrease in high affinity agonist binding, cells were treated with serum-free medium containing either PBS (as a no drug/no IgG control), the agonist acetylcholine, or chagasic or normal IgGs. Cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere with one of the above reagents, and after extensive washing, they were harvested in 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 0.25 m sucrose. All steps were performed at 4 °C. Cells were centrifuged at 400 × g for 15 min, and crude membranes were prepared as described previously (27Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Xu Y. Witt-Enderby P. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29004-29011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). To test for effects of pretreatments with agonist or IgGs on the affinity of the receptors for agonist, the agonist carbachol was used to compete for [3H]QNB binding to mAChR in the membrane preparations. Membranes were incubated at 37 °C for 75 min in 20 mmphosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 2 mmMgCl2, [3H]QNB (0.5–0.6 nm), and varying concentrations of carbachol in the presence or the absence of the guanine nucleotide analogue 5′-guanylylimidodiphosphate (Gpp(NH)p, at 100 μm). The data were analyzed with the curve-fitting program LIGAND (28Mundson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7759) Google Scholar). To assess for sequestration of hm2 mAChRs, experiments were performed on intact m2 CHO cells using the hydrophilic ligand [3H]N-methylscopolamine (NMS) to determine changes in cell surface m2 mAChR number, whereas the hydrophobic ligand [3H]QNB was used to assess total receptors. After pretreatment with drugs or IgGs as described above, the culture dishes were placed on ice, and the cells were thoroughly washed with cold PBS. Then they were spun down at 400 × g, resuspended in ice-cold DMEM:F-12 and assessed for viability by trypan blue exclusion, and suspensions with more than 95% viable cells were used for binding assays. Saturating concentrations of [3H]NMS or [3H]QNB were incubated with cells in Hepes-buffered DMEM:F-12 in the presence or the absence of 1 μm atropine to calculate specific binding for 2 h at 4 °C for [3H]NMS and for 75 min at 37 °C for [3H]QNB. Cells were filtered onto GF/C glass fiber filters, and radioactivity was counted in a Beckman spectrometer. Control levels of surface and total receptors were defined as the levels in cells treated the same as above but with the corresponding volume of PBS instead of drug or IgG. These values were considered as 0% internalization of each assay. The percentage of internalization due to drug or IgG treatments was calculated as the percentage of loss of surface receptors measured with [3H]NMS in treated samples compared with 0% internalization controls. Down-regulation was defined as a net decrease in the total receptor pool as assessed by [3H]QNB binding assays. Variations in cell density per plate were controlled by normalizing all data on the basis of mg protein/plate. To test the ability of chagasic antibodies to directly interact with purified hm2 mAChRs, immunoprecipitation experiments were performed with several chagasic or normal sera and purified hm2 mAChRs reconstituted in vesicles. As a control, an equivalent amount of the hm2 mAChR were also immunoprecipitated with a known monoclonal anti-m2 mAChR antibody (26Luetje C. Brunwell C. Norman M.G. Peterson G.L. Schimerlik M.I. Nathanson N.M. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6892-6896Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitates were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and immunoprecipitated mAChR was visualized by immunoblotting with the anti-m2 mAChR monoclonal antibody (Fig. 1). The results demonstrated that the chagasic sera immunoprecipitated the hm2 mAChR (Fig. 1, lanes 1 and 2). Two immunoreactive bands were detected by the anti-m2 mAChR mAb, one corresponding to a protein of 55 kDa, the expected size for the hm2 mAChR purified from Sf9 cells, and a second species at ∼116 kDa that likely represented the receptor dimer (24Parker E.M. Kameyama K. Higashijima T. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 519-527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The immunoreactive bands that were present in the immunoprecipitates from the chagasic sera migrated identically to those immunoprecipitated by the m2 mAb (Fig. 1, lane 5). The amount of mAChR immunoprecipitated by the chagasic antisera was lower than the fraction of receptors immunoprecipitated by the m2 mAb run in parallel; however, the amount of mAChR immunoprecipitated by the chagasic sera was significant and far greater than the trace amounts (background levels) immunoprecipitated by the normal sera used as control (Fig. 1,lanes 3 and 4). These results provide a direct demonstration of the recognition of the hm2 mAChR by antibodies present in chagasic sera. To test whether the chagasic sera interacted directly with the ligand binding site of the m2 mAChR or with another domain, we tested whether the chagasic sera could compete with the antagonist [3H]QNB in ligand binding assays. For these studies we prepared membranes from CHO cells expressing the hm2 mAChR and performed saturation binding isotherms in untreated membranes and membranes treated with either normal or chagasic IgG. No differences in the K d or B max values were observed among the three groups (Table I).Table IEffect of normal and chagasic IgG on the binding of the antagonist [3H]QNBAdditionK dB maxpmpmol/mg proteinNone96 ± 3214.7 ± 1.6Chagasic IgG89 ± 1613.1 ± 1.1Normal IgG103 ± 2612.9 ± 0.9Membranes were prepared from CHO cells expressing the hm2 mAChR as described in the text and incubated in the presence or the absence of normal or chagasic IgG (0.4 mg/ml) for 120 min at 37 °C.

The possibility that the persistent activation of m2 mAChRs by chagasic antibodies could lead to receptor desensitization was evaluated. Desensitization of G-protein-coupled receptors is associated with several events, in particular, receptor/G-protein uncoupling and sequestration of the receptors away from their normal membrane environment. A hallmark of receptor uncoupling from G-proteins is the conversion of receptors from a high to low affinity state. The high affinity state for agonists is considered to be a receptor/G-protein complex, whereas the lower affinity state is thought to represent the free receptor. In agonist binding studies in vitro a loss of high affinity agonist binding can be induced upon the addition of GTP or its analogs, presumably due to the activation of the G-protein and its subsequent dissociation of the G-protein from the receptor. Agonist-induced desensitization of the β-adrenergic receptor has been associated with the loss of high affinity agonist binding and conversion of receptors to a low affinity state (29Toews M.L. Perkins J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2227-2235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To test for desensitizing effects of chagasic antibodies on agonist binding properties, we compared the effects of pretreatment of intact cells with either the agonist acetylcholine or normal or chagasic IgG on agonist affinity. After each pretreatment, membranes were prepared and used in carbachol/[3H]QNB competition binding experiments in the presence or the absence of a guanine nucleotide analogue. In assays of membranes from control cells (treated with PBS), shallow, biphasic agonist competition curves were obtained in the absence of Gpp(NH)p, reflecting both high and low affinity agonist binding (Fig. 2 a). The addition of Gpp(NH)p right shifted and steepened the curves, as expected for the guanine nucleotide-dependent conversion of high affinity sites into low affinity sites (Fig. 2 a, untreated). The corresponding IC50 values and Hill coefficients reflected these changes (Table II). In addition, analysis of the data with the curve fitting program LIGAND (28Mundson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7759) Google Scholar) demonstrated the expected results, in that a high and low affinity state were observed and Gpp(NH)p caused a conversion of receptors from the high to low affinity state (Table III). Pretreatment of cells either with the agonist acetylcholine under conditions that lead to desensitization (27Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Xu Y. Witt-Enderby P. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29004-29011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) or with chagasic IgG produced rightward shifts of the concentration-displacement curves of carbachol in the absence of Gpp(NH)p compared with untreated cells (compare Fig. 2, band d, to Fig. 2 a; Table II). The effects caused by either pretreatment were not as extensive as those induced by the addition of Gpp(NH)p to the in vitro assays. The protease digestion fragment of chagasic IgG, F(ab′)2, had similar effects to the nondigested chagasic IgG (data not shown). The shift induced by chagasic IgG was not observed when incubations were performed with normal IgG (Fig. 2 c, Table II). Analysis of the data with the LIGAND program indicated that the decrease in overall affinity caused by the chagasic IgG was due to an increase in the value of K H, whereas there was no detectable change in the percentage of receptors in the higher affinity state (Table III). Treatment of the cells with agonist produced a similar trend (TableIII). The LIGAND analysis also suggested that the pretreatment of the cells by either agonist or chagasic IgG produced effects distinguishable from guanine nucleotides, because the percentage of receptors in the high affinity state was decreased by the addition of Gpp(NH)p to the in vitro assays (Table III). The data obtained with the normal IgG were similar to those from the untreated cells (Table III).Table IIIC50 values and Hill coefficients for the agonist competition studiesCell treatmentWithout Gpp(NH)pWith Gpp(NH)pIC50n HIC50n HμmμmUntreated71 ± 180.41 ± 0.05230 ± 240.92 ± 0.15Acetylcholine202 ± 402-aSignificantly different from untreated,p < 0.025.0.62 ± 0.07313 ± 620.68 ± 0.06Chagasic IgG160 ± 232-bSignificantly different from untreated, p < 0.01.0.66 ± 0.12193 ± 170.82 ± 0.06Normal IgG87 ± 160.47 ± 0.06241 ± 200.87 ± 0.07The data shown are IC50 values and Hill coefficients for the agonist/antagonist competition curves illustrated in Fig. 2.

It is not entirely clear why the effects of the pretreatments with agonist or chagasic IgG produced increases in K Hwithout the expected decrease in R H. One explanation is that the chagasic IgG or agonist only partially desensitized the receptor. Indeed, in studies of the desensitization of the β-adrenergic receptor, similar results were obtained (29Toews M.L. Perkins J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2227-2235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). With partial desensitization, a decrease in numbers of high affinity β-adrenergic receptors was less apparent, and the main effect seemed to be a small increase in K H (29Toews M.L. Perkins J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2227-2235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as was observed here. The present results also were similar to those we previously obtained in chick heart tissue treated with desensitizing doses of acetylcholine, where K H for agonist binding to the mAChR was increased, whereas the percentage of high affinity receptors was less affected (30Kwatra M.M. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12429-12432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, we observed very similar trends in studies with heterologously expressed hm2 mAChR in Sf9 cells (31Richardson R.M. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22249-22255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It appears that the effects of desensitization on the decreased affinity of agonist binding to the m2 mAChR are less extensive than can be induced in vitro upon the addition of guanine nucleotides to ligand binding assays. Further studies will be necessary to dissect these complex patterns of responses that are elicited by desensitization. Nevertheless, the present results are consistent with the conclusion that acute exposure of the m2 CHO cells to the chagasic IgG resulted in a decreased affinity of the receptor for agonist. These desensitizing effects of the chagasic IgG were similar to those induced by exposure to agonist. The results are consistent with the suggestion that the agonist-like activity of the chagasic sera can induce desensitization of the m2 mAChR in intact cells. To test if chagasic IgG induced sequestration of receptors, cells expressing m2 mAChRs were incubated for different times with increasing concentrations of chagasic or normal IgGs or F(ab′)2 before binding assays were performed. Comparable incubations with acetylcholine were run in parallel. The hydrophilic ligand [3H]NMS and the lipophilic ligand [3H]QNB were used in whole cell binding assays to assess cell surface and total receptors, respectively. Both the chagasic IgG and acetylcholine induced a time-dependent sequestration of the mAChRs to a similar extent, whereas normal IgG had no significant effect (Fig.3 a). The effects of both acetylcholine and the chagasic IgG were concentration-dependent; the maximum effect observed with the chagasic IgG occurred at 0.2 mg/ml and was similar to that caused by 100 nm acetylcholine (Fig.3 b). The chagasic F(ab′)2 also induced internalization but with a lower efficacy (Fig. 3 b). Normal IgG was ineffective at any concentration (Fig. 3 b). In the time periods tested, no down-regulation of receptors by chagasic IgGs, normal IgGs, or acetylcholine was observed based on measurements of total mAChR with [3H]QNB (data not shown). The present report provides evidence of a specific interaction between antibodies from the serum of chagasic patients and hm2 mAChRs and describes some early consequences of the persistent activation of the receptors by the antibodies. The results obtained support the hypothesis that antibodies having an “agonist-like” activity can participate in the regulation of the receptors they bind to, thus influencing their normal functionin vivo. The antibody-induced decrease in agonist affinity occurred after 1 h of incubation of m2 CHO cells with chagasic IgGs or F(ab′)2, whereas internalization was extensive by 90–120 min, similar to the effect of acetylcholine. The data demonstrate that the agonist-like behavior of the antibodies is sufficient to induce the series of reactions associated with desensitization of the receptors. The results are consistent with our previous observations on the ability of chagasic IgG to impair agonist-induced inhibition of contractility of rat atria after prolonged incubation with IgGs (18Goin J.C. Borda E.S. Perez Leiros C. Storino R. Sterin-Borda L. J. Auton. Nerv. Sys. 1994; 47: 45-52Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). It is unlikely that the present results could have arisen from nonspecific interactions, because the data in Fig. 1 demonstrated an ability of the chagasic antibodies to directly interact with the m2 mAChR. In addition, whereas previous studies have suggested effects of chagasic serum on adrenergic signaling (15Borda E.S. Pascual J. Cossio P.M. Vega M. Arana R.M. Sterin-Borda L. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1984; 57: 679-686PubMed Google Scholar, 16Sterin-Borda L. Perez Leiros C. Wald M. Cremaschi G. Borda E.S. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1988; 74: 349-354PubMed Google Scholar, 17Goin J.C. Borda E.S.

Neuroimmunomodulation. 1994; 1: 284-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), the CHO cells used in this study lack adrenergic receptors, making it unlikely that the observed desensitizing effects of the chagasic antibodies on the mAChR were due to cross-talk arising from effects on signaling pathways downstream of the receptors. Chagasic patients exhibit several signs of impaired parasympathetic function (14Sterin-Borda L. Borda E.S. Acta Physiol. Pharmacol. Ther. Latinoam. 1994; 44: 109-123PubMed Google Scholar); however, the molecular mechanisms involved remain unexplained. Thus, the major point of our report is that early events of agonist-promoted desensitization of m2 mAChR can be initiated by autoantibodies that bind to and persistently activate the receptors. Further studies will be required to address the issue of whether early molecular alterations in the function of the cardiac autonomic nervous system during Chagas' disease are related to the presence of autoantibodies promoting receptor desensitization. Interestingly, the existence of autoantibodies against autonomic receptors has been reported in other cardiomyopathies such as human dilated cardiomyopathy (32Limas C.J. Goldemberg I.F. Limas C.

Whether or not autoantibodies play a general role in other cardiomyopathies remains to be determined. We thank Judy Ptasienski for purification and reconstitution of the m2 mAChR."

The induction is dependent on RpoS, which is the alternative ς factor for stationary phase (9Hengge-Aronis R. Klein W. Lange R. Rimmele M. Boos W. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7918-7924Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Trehalose itself is not involved in the regulation of the operon. The accumulated trehalose is broken down to glucose by the cytoplasmic trehalase (TreF) (10Horlacher R. Uhland K. Klein W. Ehrmann M. Boos W. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6250-6257Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), ensuring a continuous turnover of the osmoprotectant. E. coli is also able to use trehalose as the sole carbon source at low and high osmolarity. The problem of the simultaneous degradation and synthesis of trehalose at high osmolarity is solved by separating the two metabolic pathways. The synthesizing enzymes are located in the cytoplasm, and the degrading enzyme encoded bytreA is located in the periplasm. TreA (11Boos W. Ehmann U. Bremer E. Middendorf A. Postma P. J. Biol.

Ehmann U. Forkl H. Klein W. Rimmele M. Postma P. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 3450-3461Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutants lacking treA can no longer grow on trehalose as the sole carbon source at high osmolarity, but they still grow at low osmolarity (11Boos W. Ehmann U. Bremer E. Middendorf A. Postma P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13212-13218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is due to a second system for trehalose degradation that is only expressed at low osmolarity. This system is composed of a phosphotransferase system enzyme II specific for trehalose (EIICBTre encoded by treB), which together with EIIAGlc transports trehalose as trehalose 6-phosphate to the cytoplasm (13Boos W.

Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5654-5664Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).treB and treC form an operon at 96.5 min on the chromosome with treB as the promoter-proximal gene (15Klein W. Horlacher R. Boos W. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4043-4052Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ThetreB/C operon is induced by trehalose 6-phosphate and dependent on the cAMP catabolite geneactivation protein (CAP), 1The abbreviations used are: CAP, cAMP catabolite gene activation protein; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; LB, Luria broth; bp, base pair(s). therefore it is subject to glucose-mediated catabolite repression (13Boos W. Ehmann U. Forkl H. Klein W. Rimmele M. Postma P. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 3450-3461Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Trehalose 6-phosphate is thus a central metabolite being the crossing point between the synthesizing and degradative pathways for trehalose. To prevent the cells from futile cycles a proper regulation of both pathways is necessary. Recently, we have described an open reading frame directly upstream oftreB (with the same direction of transcription as thetreB/C operon). This open reading frame, calledtreR, encodes the regulator of the system (15Klein W. Horlacher R. Boos W. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4043-4052Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we present the molecular characterization of treR and its encoded protein TreR (the trehalose repressor). We show that TreR is able to bind DNA at a palindromic sequence located upstream of the −35 region of the treB promoter. We show that TreR binds trehalose 6-phosphate as well as trehalose but that only the binding of trehalose 6-phosphate results in a reduction of the operator binding affinity. Bacterial strains used in this study are described in Table I. P1 transductions (17Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics.

Cloning of treR and construction of pRHo500 was described previously (15Klein W. Horlacher R. Boos W. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4043-4052Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Digestion of pRHo500 withSspI/PstI and cloning of the 1162-bptreR-carrying fragment into pBR322 that was opened with the same restriction enzymes yielded plasmid pRHo501. To obtain a fragment containing the promoter of treR, plasmid pRHo500 was digested with SspI/SmaI. The resulting 198-bp fragment was ligated into promoter probe vector pTAC3575 (lacZ, phoA) (19Atlung T. Nielsen A. Rasmussen L.J. Nellemann L.J. Holm F. Gene. 1991; 107: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) opened with SmaI, yielding plasmid pTACptreR. The orientation of the insert was confirmed by restriction analysis to be the promoter oftreR, which was controlling the transcription oflacZ. To overexpress TreR, the coding sequence oftreR was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from plasmid pRHo500 using two primers: treR NdeI, carrying aNdeI site at the ATG translation start (Fig. 1, Table II), and treR EcoRI, downstream of the open reading frame (Fig.1, Table II). The amplified DNA was digested with NdeI andEcoRI and ligated into pCYTEXP1 digested with the same enzymes, yielding plasmid pRHotreR. The cloned sequence was verified by sequencing.Table IISequence of primers used in sequencing and nuclease protection assays209/1:5′-CGATGCGTTGCTCTTGC-3′209/2:5′-CGATGACTGCCAGTGGGCT-3′209/3:5′-CCATGCTGATTCATCAC-3′209/4:5′-CCCACGCCGCTTAAGCG-3′209/5:5′-CGTTCCCGAAACGCAGC-3′209/k:5′-CTTACCGGTTGTCACG-3′Foot1:5′-GGTGTTCCACAGGGTAGCCAGA-3′treBFP2:5′-CGTCGCAATATTGCCGCGCC-3′treR EcoRI:5′-CGGAATTCTCAGGACAGGGTGGCG-3′treR NdeI:5′-CTAGTTACATATGCAAAATCGGCTGACC-3′ Open table in a new tab The sequence oftreR was determined from plasmid pRHo500 by the dideoxy chain termination method of Sanger et al.

The primer sequences are shown in Table II, and their positions are indicated in Fig. 1. [35S]dATP was purchased from Amersham International. Sequence reaction products were separated on a 4“%” sequencing gel containing urea according to the manufacturer's manual (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The DNA sequence and the deduced amino acid sequence were identical to another sequence submitted to GenBankTM later (accession number U14003) (22Burland V. Plunkett G. Sofia H.J. Daniels D.L. Blattner F.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2105-2119Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Sequence homologies were found by querying the latest releases of all available data bases using the BLAST server at the National Center for Biotechnology, Bethesda, MD (23Altschul S.F. Gish W.

The mRNA start point was mapped by the reverse transcriptase method of primer extension according to Ref. 24Belfort M. Pederson-Lane J. West D. Ehrenman K. Maley G. Chu F. Maley F.

The sequence reaction was done with the same primer. Strain SF120 (25Baneyx F. Georgiou G. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2696-2703Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was transformed with plasmid pRHotreR and grown at 28 °C in 1 liter of LB containing ampicillin (100 “μ”g/ml). Induction was done after reaching an A 578 of 0.6 by shifting the culture quickly to 42 °C. The culture was further incubated for 3 h at 42 °C. The following procedures were all performed at 4 °C. After centrifugation for 15 min at 4,200 × g the culture was washed in 500 ml of buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2) and resuspended in 20 ml of the same buffer. The suspension was ruptured in a French pressure cell at 16,000 p.s.i. and centrifuged for 30 min at 36,000 × g. The nucleic acid remaining in the supernatant was precipitated by adding streptomycin sulfate to a final concentration of 2“%”. After 30 min of incubation the suspension was centrifuged at 36,000 × g for 30 min. The proteins of the supernatant were precipitated by the addition of ammonium sulfate to 30“%” saturation. After incubation for 30 min and centrifugation at 36,000 × g for 30 min, the ammonium sulfate concentration of the supernatant was elevated to 50“%” saturation. The protein pellet was harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 20 ml of buffer A. The suspension was loaded onto a heparin-Sepharose column (Pharmacia) (15-ml bed volume, 3.5-cm diameter) equilibrated with buffer A. The flow rate was adjusted to 60 ml/h. After washing the column with 60 ml of buffer A, the protein was eluted in 140 ml of a linear gradient from 100 to 500 mm KCl in buffer A. The TreR-containing fractions were pooled. The protein was precipitated with 60“%” saturated ammonium sulfate and stored in precipitated form at 4 °C. During purification the different fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using 15“%” polyacrylamide (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207464) Google Scholar). 100 “μ”l of TreR (0.5 mg/ml) in buffer A was applied on a Superdex 200 column (Pharmacia). Trehalose 6-phosphate or trehalose, when present, had a concentration of 10 mm. Elution was with the same buffer and done at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/h. The marker proteins chymotrypsin (25 kDa), ovalbumin (45 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), and dimer of bovine serum albumin (132 kDa) were analyzed in separate runs using identical conditions. The molecular weights were plotted half-logarithmically against their elution volume forming a straight line from which the molecular weight of TreR was interpolated. 5 “μ”g of TreR at 2 mg/ml was incubated at 37 °C with different concentrations of thermolysin in buffer A supplemented with 4 mm CaCl2. After 2 h an excess of EDTA (6 mm) was added, and the products were analyzed on a 15“%” SDS-PAGE gel (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207464) Google Scholar). 4 “μ”g of plasmid pRHo400 was digested with AvaI and NcoI. After heat inactivation of the enzymes, the restricted sites were filled up with 4 units of Klenow enzyme using 10 “μ”Ci of [35S]dATP and an excess of the other unlabeled nucleotides (2 mm each). After heat denaturation, the labeled DNA was diluted (1/100) and incubated with different concentrations of purified TreR in buffer A containing bovine serum albumin (0.1 mg/ml). As indicated, the sugars trehalose and trehalose 6-phosphate were added to a final concentration of 3 mm. The mixture was separated on a 4“%” acrylamide gel (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Nolan C. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and subjected to autoradiography. 4 pmol of the primer treBFP2 (Table II) were labeled with 10 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) using 5 “μ”Ci of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham). After labeling, the complete mixture was used to perform a polymerase chain reaction together with unlabeled primer Foot1 (TableII) and plasmid DNA as template. After precipitation with ethanol, the pellet was resuspended with water to a value of 50,000 cpm/“μ”l. 2 “μ”l of the labeled DNA was incubated with varying amounts of TreR in a total volume of 50 “μ”l using buffer A containing bovine serum albumin (0.1 mg/ml) and 100 “μ”g/ml poly(dI-dC) (Pharmacia). Trehalose and trehalose 6-phosphate were added to a final concentration of 1 mm. After an incubation of 10 min at 37 °C, 3 “μ”l of DNase I (Boehringer Mannheim, 0.007 units/“μ”l) was added, and the reaction was performed at 37 °C for 3 min. It was stopped by the addition of 50 “μ”l of stop solution (600 mmsodium acetate, pH 4.8, 20 mm EDTA). The DNA was precipitated by the addition of 2 volumes of ethanol. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 1 × sequencing stop solution (Amersham) and analyzed on a sequencing gel. A sequencing reaction with the corresponding primer was used to localize the resulting binding site. The DNA region upstream of treBlocated on plasmid pRHo500 was sequenced on double-stranded DNA with the dideoxy chain termination technique using the customized primers indicated. The result is shown in Fig. 1. An open reading frame was found starting with ATG at position 155 and ending with the TGA stop codon at position 1100 of the sequence shown in Fig.1. This open reading frame contains 945 bp encoding 315 amino acids (molecular mass of 34,508 Da) that represent TreR. Upstream of the ATG start codon we recognized sequences that are likely to function as −10 and −35 regions of a ς70-dependent promoter. Primer extension analysis was used to determine the transcriptional start point (Fig. 2). Four closely spaced start points were identified, and they are indicated in Fig. 1 together with their corresponding −10 and −35 promoter region. Also shown in Fig. 1downstream of the TGA stop codon of treR, a sequence was found that could form a palindrome able to act as a potential transcription termination signal (stem and loop structure). Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of TreR with that of the LacI (27Farabough P.J. Nature. 1978; 274: 765-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), PurR (28Rolfes J.R. Zalkin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19653-19661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and other repressors of the LacI-GalR subfamily shows a high degree of homology at the NH2-terminal part of the protein sequence. This part is known to contain the helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif (Fig. 3). In the case of TreR the recognition helix is KSTVSRVLN.Figure 3Sequence homology to other repressor proteins. Shown is the comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of TreR with the deduced amino acid sequences of repressors LacI (27Farabough P.J.

The part of the protein known to be involved in DNA binding (Helix Turn Helix motif) is annotated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) By cloning a 198-bp fragment containing the identified promoter oftreR into a promoter probe vector with promoterlesslacZ and phoA genes we obtained plasmid clones where lacZ was fused to a promoter within treRbut oriented opposite to treR transcription (data not shown). Therefore, a second even stronger promoter than the identifiedtreR promoter exists on this very short DNA fragment but with the opposite orientation. This finding is consistent with a report of an active lacZ fusion to this hypothetical promoter (29Talukder A.A. Yanai S. Yamada M. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1994; 58: 117-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). E. coli strain SF120 (lacking several proteases) was transformed with plasmid pRHotreRcarrying the treR gene behind the strong inducible λ promoter of pCYTEXP1. Growing in LB, the strain showed strong expression of treR only after a temperature shift from 28 to 42 °C as demonstrated by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4). After harvesting the cells most of the overproduced protein appeared in the soluble fraction (Fig. 4). TreR was purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation (30–50“%” saturation) followed by chromatography through a heparin-Sepharose column. Homogeneous TreR was eluted from the heparin column at 320 mm KCl (Fig. 4). The yield from a 1-liter LB culture was routinely 70 mg of homogeneous protein. It was stored in precipitated form (60“%” saturated ammonium sulfate) for several months without loss of activity as measured by its ability to bind substrate. Molecular sieve chromatography through Superdex 200 revealed that TreR behaves as a molecule with a molecular weight of 70,000. Therefore, TreR is a dimer of identical subunits. The dimeric state of TreR was not changed in the presence of 10 mmtrehalose or 10 mm trehalose 6-phosphate, the inducer of the system (data not shown). Previously, we had identified trehalose 6-phosphate as the inducer of thetreB/treC operon (30Klein W. Ehmann U. Boos W. Res. Microbiol. 1991; 142: 359-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Therefore, TreR should bind trehalose 6-phosphate. Using the intrinsic fluorescence of TreR we found that the emission (excitation at 280 nm) changed in the presence of trehalose 6-phosphate (Fig. 5 A). The reduction in the emission at 340 nm was used to measure binding of trehalose 6-phosphate (Fig. 5 B). Half-maximal saturation identical with the K d of binding occurred at 10 “μ”m trehalose 6-phosphate. To our surprise, the addition of trehalose also caused a change in the fluorescence emission of the protein (Fig. 5 A) with the half-maximal concentration being 280 “μ”m (Fig. 5 B). Other sugars at 10 mm concentration such as glucose, maltose, and sucrose did not elicit changes in the emission spectrum (data not shown). During purification of TreR, particularly when purified from extracts of a strain not carrying mutations in different proteases, the rapid formation of a proteolytic breakdown product of 29 kDa was observed. This proteolytic fragment was still able to dimerize (data not shown). During elution from heparin-Sepharose, a heterodimer peak was visible consisting of an intact monomer and a proteolyzed monomer (in the ratio of 1:1). This heterodimer eluted at lower salt concentrations than the intact homodimer (250 and 320 mm KCl, respectively) implicating a lower binding affinity of this heterodimer toward heparin (data not shown). By incubating the purified intact protein with thermolysin we were able to produce the same proteolytic 29-kDa fragment of TreR (Fig.6) even at a very low protease concentration (6 “μ”g/ml; Fig. 6, lane 2). The protease stability of the 29-kDa fragment could be improved by incubation with 0.3 mmtrehalose 6-phosphate but not by trehalose (data not shown). The stability of this fragment allowed the determination of its amino-terminal sequence. The sequence obtained indicated the existence of three different proteolytic fragments differing only in the last 3 or 6 amino-terminal amino acids (Fig. 7). Therefore, this region is likely to represent a linker between the carboxyl-terminal dimerization domain and the amino-terminal DNA-binding domain of the intact protein.Figure 7Linker domain of TreR. The protein sequence of TreR is shown schematically, and proteolytic cleavage points are indicated by the symbols of scissors. The molecular mass of the remaining carboxyl-terminal fragment is indicated in kDa.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) By use of DNase I footprinting analysis we determined the sequence of the DNA recognized and bound by TreR. Increasing amounts of TreR were incubated with linear DNA carrying the promoter fragment oftreB/C prior to incubation with nuclease. Depending on the concentration of TreR, a DNA segment with the centered perfect palindromic sequence 5′-CGGGAAC→GTTCCCG-3′ was protected from DNase I (Fig. 8, lanes 1–8). At concentrations of 1 nm TreR or lower no protection of the DNA was visible and at 5 nm TreR protection was complete. At the highest concentration used (250 nm), no unspecific binding of DNA was detectable. When trehalose 6-phosphate (1 mm) was added to the assay, the DNA-protecting ability of TreR changed. No binding to DNA was obtained at low TreR concentrations (5 nm). At higher concentrations (>50 nm), the protein was able to bind to the same DNA sequence as in the absence of the inducer (Fig. 8, lanes 9–15). The addition of trehalose (1 mm) did not change the DNA binding ability of TreR (Fig.8, lanes 16–22). The TreR binding site is located near the hypothetical cAMP/CAP binding site and partially overlaps the −35 region of the major promoter of treB/C (Fig.9). The topology of the DNA had no influence on the results obtained since identical binding patterns were visible with supercoiled DNA (data not shown). Similar results concerning the binding of TreR to its operator were obtained by gel retardation assays (data not shown).Figure 9Regulatory elements of the treB/Coperon. Shown is the DNA sequence upstream of thetreB/C operon. The direction of transcription and the start of the mRNA are given by an arrow. The promoter structure of the operon (−10 and −35) and the cAMP/CAP binding site as well as the TreR binding site are indicated bylines.

Horlacher R. Boos W. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4043-4052Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, TreR acts as the repressor of treB/C, the genes encoding the trehalose-utilizing enzymes. The detailed analysis of treR and its encoded protein TreR reported here firmly establishes the regulation of the metabolic pathway of trehalose utilization at low and high osmolarity. TreR of E. coli and the very closely related bacteriumSalmonella typhimurium (31Tao T. Snavely M.D. Farr S.G. Maguire M.E. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2654-2662Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) is homologous to other repressor proteins of the LacI-GalR family, but significant homology only exists in the amino-terminal part of the protein known to contain the helix-turn-helix motif for DNA binding (32Nguyen C.C. Saier M.H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 98-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). By the use of substrate-dependent fluorescence quenching, we established that trehalose 6-phosphate is bound by TreR. Binding of this sugar phosphate not only causes a fluorescence quench but also a shift in the emission maximum, which is indicative of a conformational change of the protein upon binding substrate. By titration we calculated a K d of 10 “μ”m. This is significantly lower than the K m of TreC (6 mm) (16Rimmele M. Boos W. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5654-5664Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is the trehalose 6-phosphate-hydrolyzing enzyme. From the maximal rate of TreB-mediated transport in a fully induced strain and the capacity of TreC, we could estimate that the equilibrium concentration of internal trehalose 6-phosphate at saturating external trehalose concentration is about 0.6 mm(16Rimmele M. Boos W. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5654-5664Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This is far above the limiting concentration for saturation of TreR thus ensuring full induction. In the absence of trehalose 6-phosphate, TreR binds to DNA harboring the control region of the treB/C operon. This can be seen by gel shift as well as nuclease protection assays. The analysis of the latter reveals the palindromic sequence 5′-CGGGAAC→GTTCCCG-3′ as the only TreR binding site of the operator of the treB/C operon. Significantly, this sequence contains a central CG which has been found in all operators of the LacI family (33Schumacher M.A. Choi K.Y. Zalkin H. Brennan R.G. Science. 1994; 266: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Müller-Hill and co-workers (34Lehming N. Sartorius J. Kisters-Woike B. von Wilcken-Bergmann B. Müller-Hill B. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 35Kisters-Woike B. Lehming N. Sartorius J. von Wilcken-Bergmann B. Müller-Hill B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 198: 411-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) have proposed rules for the interaction of the recognition helix of repressors with their cognate operators. In particular, bases 4 and 5 of the symmetrical operator sequence (counted from the center of symmetry toward the 5′ direction) only allow a narrow range of amino acid side chains in positions 1 and 2 of the recognition helix for effective repression. When thelac operator sequence was mutated to carry GG at positions 4 and 5 the only amino acids tolerated for effective repression at positions 1 and 2 of the equally mutated recognition helix were Lys for position 1 and Ser for position 2 (34Lehming N. Sartorius J. Kisters-Woike B. von Wilcken-Bergmann B. Müller-Hill B. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Exactly this combination occurs in the tre system for the operator (Fig. 8) and recognition helix (Fig. 3). This finding lends further support to the validity of rules in repressor-operator recognition. The operator sequence partially overlaps the putative binding site for cAMP/CAP. One could therefore argue that the effective transcription of the operon is solely due to the activation by the cAMP·CAP complex, and the function of TreR is to prevent this activation. The TreR concentration needed to protect the operator-DNA from nuclease attack is at least 50 nm in the presence of 1 mmtrehalose 6-phosphate versus 5 nm in its absence (Fig. 9). The presence of 1 mm trehalose neither affects the ability of TreR to protect the DNA from nuclease action nor its ability to elicit a gel retardation effect. As seen by footprint analysis, the protected DNA region is somewhat larger when TreR has bound trehalose 6-phosphate. This indicates a conformational change of the dimeric repressor protein resulting in an increased distance of its two DNA-binding motifs. To our surprise, we found that TreR is also able to bind trehalose, although with a much higher K d than it binds trehalose 6-phosphate (280 versus 10 “μ”m). TheK d for binding trehalose is far lower than the measured concentration of this sugar when synthesized at high osmolarity (about 400 mm) (5Dinnbier U. Limpinsel E. Schmid R. Bakker E.P. Arch. Microbiol. 1988; 150: 348-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) and therefore should be of physiological significance. The conformational change deduced from the fluorescence change was not the same as the one that is caused by binding trehalose 6-phosphate. Nevertheless, the addition of excess trehalose 6-phosphate to TreR that already contained bound trehalose lead to the typical spectrum seen in the presence of trehalose 6-phosphate only. This was also true for the addition of a large excess of trehalose to TreR that contained bound trehalose 6-phosphate. This indicates that both sugars bind competitively to the same site but their binding causes different conformations of the protein. Because trehalose is synthesized internally at high osmolarity andtreB/C (the genes encoding the degradative enzymes under TreR control) become uninducible under these conditions, one may conclude that binding of trehalose could enhance the affinity of TreR for the operator. However, this is not the case. Yet, the simple competition by the high trehalose concentration for the binding of trehalose 6-phosphate to TreR will also slow down or even prevent induction. Trehalose thus behaves as an anti-inducer of thetre system. Similar observations have been made in the case of the Lac repressor where it was found that sugars other than the inducer isopropyl-1-thio-“β”-d-galactopyranoside, such aso-nitrophenyl-“β”-d-fucoside or even glucose, in high concentrations could compete with the binding of inducer but did not elicit repression by themselves (36Riggs A.D. Newby R.F. Bourgeois S. J. Mol. Biol. 1970; 51: 303-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Thus, the synthesis of trehalose can cause the physiologically important uninducibility of thetreB/C operon independently of the enzymatic activity of the trehalose 6-phosphate-degrading enzyme (OtsB) as we have considered previously (30Klein W. Ehmann U. Boos W. Res. Microbiol. 1991; 142: 359-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Therefore, TreR is the major control element to ensure the proper separation of the two crossing pathways of synthesis and degradation of trehalose in E. coli. The strong evidence of a promoter element divergent to thetreR promoter opens the possibility of a treRspecific antisense RNA pointing to an additional form of regulation. More studies are necessary to unravel this aspect. Recently, the repressor for the genes encoding the trehalose-utilizing enzymes in Bacillus subtilis was described (37Schöck F. Dahl M.K. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4576-4581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These enzymes, enzyme IIBCTre and trehalose-6-phosphate hydrolase (38Helfert C. Gotsche S. Dahl M.K. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 111-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 39Gotsche S. Dahl M.K. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2721-2726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), are homologous to the corresponding enzymes from E. coli. Surprisingly, this is not true for the repressor. The biochemical analysis of TreR showed that the protein forms a dimer of two identical subunits irrespective of its bound ligand. Like in other repressors of this family, the dimerization domain was found to be localized in the carboxyl-terminal part of the protein whereas the DNA-binding domain is localized near the NH2 terminus. This was clear from the appearance of a stable 29-kDa degradation product that was either formed during the isolation from protease-containing extracts or by the addition of thermolysin to the purified protein (Figs. 4 and 6). The 29-kDa carboxyl-terminal dimerization domain was stable against further proteolysis. A very similar fragment lacking the first 60 NH2-terminal amino acids was produced by trypsin treatment of the Lac repressor retaining the tetramerization domain but lacking the operator binding activity (40Geisler N. Weber K. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 938-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) pointing once again to the close relationship of these two repressors. Even though it belongs to the same family as the tetrameric LacI repressor, the TreR repressor only forms a dimer. This is due to the lack of the four-helix bundle oligomerization domain in TreR that is present at the extreme carboxyl terminus of the Lac repressor (41Alberti S. Oehler S. von Wilcken-Bergmann B. Müller-Hill B. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3227-3236Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar,42Friedman A.M. Fischmann T.O. Steitz T.A. Science. 1995; 268: 1721-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Early on it had been proposed that the inducer-binding domain of repressors is homologous to the substrate binding cleft in the well studied sugar-binding proteins involved in transport and chemotaxis (43Müller-Hill B.

Biol Chem. 1993; 268: 17602-17612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, the elucidation of the three-dimensional structure of the Lac repressor (42Friedman A.M. Fischmann T.O. Steitz T.A. Science. 1995; 268: 1721-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 45Lewis M. Chang G. Horton N.C. Kercher M.A. Pace H.C. Schumacher M.A. Brennan R.G. Lu P.Z.

Science. 1994; 266: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) has fully confirmed this concept.

https://openalex.org/W2052612600,"Magnaporthe grisea is a fungal pathogen with two mating types, MAT1-1 and MAT1-2 , that forms a specialized cell necessary for pathogenesis, the appressorium. Saccharomyces cerevisiae α-factor pheromone blocked appressorium formation in a mating type–specific manner and protected plants from infection by MAT1-2 strains. Experiments with α-factor analogs suggest that the observed activity is due to a specific interaction of α-factor with an M. grisea receptor. Culture filtrates of a MAT1-1 strain contained an activity that inhibited appressorium formation of mating type MAT1-2 strains. These findings provide evidence that a pheromone response pathway exists in M. grisea that can be exploited for plant protection."
https://openalex.org/W2032814746,"A subset of nuclear receptors, including those for thyroid hormone (TR), retinoic acid, vitamin D3, and eicosanoids, can form heterodimers with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) on DNA regulatory elements in the absence of their cognate ligands. In a mammalian two-hybrid assay, we have found that recruitment of a VP16-RXR chimera by a Gal4-TRβ ligand-binding domain fusion is enhanced up to 50-fold by thyroid hormone (T3). This was also observed with a mutant fusion, Gal4-TR(L454A), lacking ligand-inducible activation function (AF-2) and unable to interact with putative coactivators, suggesting that the AF-2 activity of TR or intermediary cofactors is not involved in this effect. The wild-type and mutant Gal4-TR fusions also exhibited hormone-dependent recruitment of RXR in yeast. Hormone-dependent recruitment of RXR was also evident with another Gal4-TR mutant, AHTm, which does not interact with the nuclear receptor corepressor N-CoR, suggesting that ligand-enhanced dimerization is not a result of T3-induced corepressor release. Finally, we have shown that the interaction between RXR and TR is augmented by T3 in vitro, arguing against altered expression of either partner in vivo mediating this effect. We propose that ligand-dependent heterodimerization of TR and RXR in solution may provide a further level of control in nuclear receptor signaling."

An additional enzymatic activity of CD38 shared by monofunctional ADP-ribosyl cyclase from Aplysia californicais the exchange of the base group of NAD+ (nicotinamide) with various nucleophiles. Both human CD38 (either recombinant or purified from erythrocyte membranes) and Aplysia cyclase were found to catalyze the exchange of ADPR with the nicotinamide group of NAD+ leading to the formation of a dimeric ADPR ((ADPR)2). The dimeric structure of the enzymatic product, which was generated by recombinant CD38 and by CD38+Namalwa cells from as low as 10 μm NAD+, was demonstrated using specific enzyme treatments (dinucleotide pyrophosphatase and 5′-nucleotidase) and mass spectrometry analyses of the resulting products. The linkage between the two ADPR units of (ADPR)2 was identified as that between the N1of the adenine nucleus of one ADPR unit and the anomeric carbon of the terminal ribose of the second ADPR molecule by enzymatic analyses and by comparison with patterns of cADPR cleavage with Me2SO:tert-butoxide. Although (ADPR)2 itself did not release Ca2+ from sea urchin egg microsomal vesicles, it specifically potentiated the Ca2+-releasing activity of subthreshold concentrations of cADPR.

Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9561-9568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Various bifunctional enzymes in many mammalian tissues can also catalyze both the synthesis and the hydrolysis of cADPR. The first such enzyme reported was purified from dog spleen (17Kim H.

The confusion between CD38-like enzymes and the NAD+ glycohydrolases has been recently resolved by the use of NGD+, an NAD+ analog, as an alternative substrate. Only CD38-like bifunctional enzymes possessing a cyclase activity can convert NGD+ to cyclic GDP-ribose, a fluorescent product. NAD+ glycohydrolases, on the other hand, can only convert NGD+ to GDP-ribose, a non-fluorescent product (25Graeff R.M. Walseth T.F. Fryxell K. Branton W.D. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30260-30267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to CD38, another family of NAD+-utilizing enzymes has been recently identified that includes BST-1 (26Hirata Y. Kimura N. Sato K. Ohsugi Y. Takasawa S. Okamoto H. Ishikawa J. Kaisho T. Ishihara K. Hirano T. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 244-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) and BP-3 (27Dong C. Wang J. Neame P. Cooper M.D. Int. Immunol. 1994; 6: 1353-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). These enzymes are glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-anchored ectoproteins having considerable sequence homology to CD38 and may be involved in the ectocellular metabolism of NAD+, cADPR, and ADPR as well. Various models have been proposed for the catalytic mechanism of cleavage of the nicotinamide-ribosyl linkage by NAD+-utilizing enzymes. A common feature among these models is the postulated presence of an enzyme-ADP-ribose intermediate (28Zatman L.J. Kaplan N.O. Colowick S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1953; 200: 197-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Tarnus C. Schuber F. Bioorg. Chem. 1987; 15: 31-42Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 30Tarnus C. Muller H. Schuber F.

Chem. 1995; 270: 30327-30333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Depending on whether water is accessible to the active site, the intermediate can dissociate to yield either cADPR or ADPR, respectively, thus accounting for either a cyclase or an NAD+ glycohydrolase reaction (31Aarhus R. Graeff R.M. Dickey D.M. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30327-30333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). This catalytic scheme can also account for the base-exchange reaction actually observed. Thus, other nucleophiles including nicotinic acid can interact with the intermediate and generate products with the nicotinamide base exchanged for the nucleophiles. A physiologically relevant example of this type of base-exchange reaction is the synthesis of the new calcium-mobilizing molecule NAADP+ (32Lee H.C. Walseth T.F. Bratt G.T. Hayes R.N. Clapper D.L. J.

In this paper, we report another example of the exchange reaction that can lead to the formation of a hitherto unknown biologically active product. Using CD38 purified from human erythrocyte membranes, we show that ADP-ribose itself can function as a nucleophile and can interact with the enzyme intermediate. The result is the formation of a dimeric ADPR molecule. Of particular relevance is the fact that this ADPR dimer possesses functional activity, as it potentiates in a specific way the calcium-releasing activity of cADPR from sea urchin egg microsomal vesicles. CD38 was purified to homogeneity from human erythrocyte membranes as described (21Zocchi E. Franco L. Guida L. Benatti U. Bargellesi A. Malavasi F. Lee H.C. De Flora A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 1459-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Its cyclase specific activity, which was measured with NGD+ as a substrate (35Guida L. Franco L. Zocchi E. De Flora A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 481-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), was 2.8 μmol cyclic GDP-ribose/min/mg. Its cADPR hydrolase-specific activity (35Guida L. Franco L. Zocchi E. De Flora A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 481-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) was 2.8 μmol ADPR/min/mg. Production and purification of recombinant human CD38 was carried out as described previously (31Aarhus R. Graeff R.M. Dickey D.M. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. J. Biol.

De Flora A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 481-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) of 20 μmol cADPR/min/mg. [3H]NAD+ (30.7 Ci/mmol) was obtained from DuPont NEN (Florence, Italy). All other chemicals were from Sigma and were of the highest purity grade available. The conditions for HPLC analyses using a C18 reverse phase column on a Hewlett-Packard HP 1090 instrument were as described previously (35Guida L. Franco L. Zocchi E. De Flora A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 481-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The nucleotide peaks were identified by comparing their retention times and UV spectra with highly pure standard compounds. Purified CD38 (0.75 μg) was incubated for 15 h at 37 °C with 1 mm NAD+ and 20 mm ADPR (HPLC-purified) in 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.5, containing bovine serum albumin (0.1 mg/ml) and 0.05% Triton X-100. The final volume was 5.0 ml. The reaction was terminated by addition of trichloroacetic acid (5% final concentration), the mixture was centrifuged, and the excess trichloroacetic acid was removed with three successive extractions with diethylether. The excess diethylether was evaporated under an N2 stream, and the solution was vacuum-dried. The resulting powder was dissolved in 0.5 ml of H2O, and 2 μl of the solution was submitted to analytical HPLC (35Guida L. Franco L. Zocchi E. De Flora A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 481-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The yield of the dimeric ADPR ((ADPR)2) eluted at 34 min was around 1% of the total area of all peaks. Therefore, to obtain sufficient amounts of (ADPR)2 for analyses the incubation conditions described above were repeated nine times. Each of the ten 0.5-ml samples thus obtained was then submitted separately to preparative HPLC. This was carried out on a System Gold HPLC (Beckman Instruments) equipped with a diode-array spectrophotometric detector set at 260 nm. An anion exchange perfusion chromatography column (100 × 4.6 mm, Poros QE/M, PerSeptive Biosystems, Cambridge, MA) was used. Solvent A was H2O, and solvent B was 0.15 m trifluoroacetic acid. The solvent program was a linear gradient starting at 100% solvent A and increasing to 100% solvent B in 15 min. The flow rate was 6 ml/min. (ADPR)2 eluted at 7 min, well separated from all other nucleotides (NAD+, ADPR, and cADPR) and nicotinamide, which eluted in the same peak between 2 and 5 min. The 7-min peak was lyophilized and stored at −20 °C until used. Labeled (ADPR)2was obtained by incubating purified CD38 (30 ng) at 37 °C with 20 mm ADPR, 1 mm[3H]NAD+ (5000 dpm/nmol) in 5 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.5, with 0.05% Triton X-100 in a final volume of 0.2 ml. After an 18-h incubation period, aliquots of 100,000 dpm were submitted to analytical HPLC (35Guida L. Franco L. Zocchi E. De Flora A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 481-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), fractions were collected every minute, and the radioactivity values were determined in a β-counter. The HPLC-purified labeled (ADPR)2 (25 μg, corresponding to 5,000 dpm) was then incubated for 18 h at 37 °C with each of the following enzymes separately: (i) 5 μg NAD+glycohydrolase from Neurospora crassa in 65 μl of phosphate-buffered saline; (ii) 32 ng of ADP-ribosyl cyclase purified from A. californica (31Aarhus R.

Residual (ADPR)2 and neo-synthesized ADPR were evaluated by analytical HPLC (35Guida L. Franco L. Zocchi E. De Flora A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 481-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Purified (ADPR)2 (0.25 mg) was dissolved in H2O and incubated for 18 h at 37 °C with 30 μg of commercial dinucleotide pyrophosphatase (EC3.6.1.9) from Crotalus adamanteus venom in 0.2 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, containing 2 mmMgCl2. The reaction was terminated with trichloroacetic acid (5% final concentration), and the trichloroacetic acid was removed as described above. Part of the deproteinized mixture (2%) was analyzed by HPLC (35Guida L. Franco L. Zocchi E. De Flora A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 481-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) to monitor the reaction products. Two products were formed, AMP (retention time, 15 min) and an unknown product that eluted at 25 min (hence designated P25). The remaining 98% of the deproteinized mixture was submitted to anion exchange perfusion chromatography as described above except that a flow rate of 4 ml/min was used instead. The unknown compound (P25) that eluted at 7 min was well separated from AMP, which had a retention time of 3 min in this system. Purified P25 was lyophilized and stored at −20 °C. Lyophilized P25 (0.1 mg) was dissolved in H2O and incubated for 15 h at 37 °C with 15 μg of 5′-nucleotidase (EC 3.1.3.5) from C. adamanteus venom in 0.25 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. The reaction was terminated with trichloroacetic acid (5% final concentration), the trichloroacetic acid was removed as described above, and the resulting solution was analyzed by HPLC (35Guida L. Franco L. Zocchi E. De Flora A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 481-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), which showed only one peak with a retention time of 12 min (P12). This peak was purified by HPLC using C18 reverse phase chromatography (ODS Hypersil 3 μm, 60 × 4.6 mm) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Solvent A was deionized water, and solvent B was methanol (HPLC grade). The solvent program was a gradient starting at 100% Solvent A for 5 min, then linearly increasing to 100% Solvent B in 15 min. Under these HPLC conditions, the P12 peak showed a retention time of 12 min. This peak was collected, lyophilized, and stored at −20 °C before HPLC/MS analyses. Various purified samples were resuspended at 5–50 μg/ml in H2O:methanol:trifluoroacetic acid (49.5:49.5:1). The sample was pumped by an HPLC pump (Kontron Instruments, Milan, Italy) through a Valco valve into the mass spectrometer (Hewlett Packard 5989A Engine, Palo Alto, CA) electrospray source. Background spectra were obtained by injecting the solvent without the samples and were subtracted from the averaged spectra of various samples. Data were collected in the positive ion mode in a range including the expected molecular masses to avoid the influence of the sodium and potassium adducts usually found with phosphate-containing molecules. The procedure was as described by Gu and Sih (37Gu Q.M. Sih C.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 7481-7486Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, sodiumtert-butoxide was prepared by dissolving 0.3 g of sodium in 13 ml of tert-butyl alcohol overnight at room temperature. The solution was vacuum-dried, and the resulting white powder was dissolved in an Me2SO:water (998:2) solution to give a final concentration of 0.4 mg/ml. cADPR (30 μg) was then incubated for 60 min at 35 °C in 1.0 ml of the Me2SO:tert-butoxide mixture. Under these conditions, the main product observed by analytical HPLC (35Guida L. Franco L. Zocchi E. De Flora A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 481-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) had a retention time of 25 min, identical to that obtained upon incubation of (ADPR)2 with dinucleotide pyrophosphatase (P25, see above). This product was purified by anion exchange perfusion chromatography (see above), lyophilized, and stored at −20 °C before being submitted to MS analysis. Prolonging the incubation of cADPR in Me2SO:tert-butoxide to 2 h resulted in greatly reduced formation of the peak that eluted at 25 min and in the concomitant appearance of another compound that had a retention time of 12 min. This is identical to the retention time of the product obtained by sequential digestion of (ADPR)2 with dinucleotide pyrophosphatase and 5′-nucleotidase (P12, see above). Fractionation of sea urchin egg (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) microsomes was performed as described in Ref. 38Lee H.C. Aarhus R. Graeff R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9060-9066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar except that calmodulin (10 μg/ml) was added to the dilution medium. Ca2+ release assays were performed at 17 °C under constant stirring. Fig. 1 shows that native CD38 purified from human erythrocyte membranes catalyzes the base-exchange reaction resulting in the synthesis of NAAD+ from NAD+and nicotinic acid. The reaction occurs even at pH 6.5, which is significantly higher than that previously demonstrated to be optimal for the base-exchange reaction catalyzed by a recombinant CD38 containing only the extracellular domain (31Aarhus R. Graeff R.M. Dickey D.M. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30327-30333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). The extent of NAAD+ formation was comparable with that catalyzed byAplysia cyclase also shown in Fig. 1. In addition to NAAD+, erythrocyte CD38 also results in the synthesis of a modest amount of cADPR and of a substantial amount of ADPR. In contrast, the Aplysia cyclase mainly catalyzes the formation of cADPR with minor production of NAAD+ and ADPR (Fig.1). Whether ADPR can serve as a nucleophile in the base-exchange reaction was investigated by incubating the native CD38 with [adenine-3H]NAD+ in the presence of excess ADPR. Fig. 2 shows that the majority of the3H label was converted to ADPR (eluted at 23 min) with a small portion of it going to cADPR (eluted at 5.5 min). In addition, a detectable amount of the label (around 1%) was present in an unknown peak eluted at 34 min (P34). This peak was also labeled when [α-32P]NAD+ was used as traced instead of [3H]NAD+ (not shown). The UV spectrum of the unknown peak shown in the inset of Fig. 2 is clearly different from that of ADPR, with a maximum at 270 nm rather than at 260 nm. Fig. 3 shows that the formation of P34 from [3H]NAD+ and ADPR is catalyzed not only by CD38 but also by ADP-ribosyl cyclase from A. californica. The time course of P34 production was similar with the two enzymes. The amount of P34 formed by CD38 at 18 h was only slightly lower than that of cADPR, indicating that it is a major product of CD38 (Fig.3 A). The long incubation time was chosen in these experiments because CD38 is known to be substantially inactivated due to the NAD+-induced self-aggregation of the protein (35Guida L. Franco L. Zocchi E. De Flora A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 481-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar,39Franco L. Zocchi E. Calder L. Guida L. Benatti U. De Flora A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 1710-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 40Zocchi E. Franco L. Guida L. Calder L. De Flora A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 359: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This inactivating effect as well as the attendant oligomerization was also observed with a recombinant form of human CD38 corresponding to its ectocellular C-terminal region (35Guida L. Franco L. Zocchi E. De Flora A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 481-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 36Fryxell K.B. O'Donoghue K. Graeff R.M. Lee H.C. Branton W.D. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The NAD+-dependent inactivation of CD38 is different from that recently observed with NAD+glycohydrolase purified from rabbit erythrocytes (41Han M.K. Lee J.Y. Cho Y.S. Song Y.M. An N.H. Kim H.R. Kim U.H. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 903-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), which is due to auto-ADP-ribosylation and is reversible. Since the two-step activity of CD38 leads to accumulation of ADPR as the major end product (Fig. 3 A), we investigated whether P34 production also occurs without any initial addition of ADPR as co-substrate. As shown in Fig. 4, this proved to be the case, although formation of P34 became detectable only at 8 h of incubation, when production of ADPR peaked at approximately 5 mm and was comparably lower in extent than that recorded with both NAD+ and ADPR added. In these experiments, the NAD+-induced inactivation of CD38 was counteracted by repeated additions of the soluble recombinant protein. At the same times, the incubation mixtures were also regularly supplemented with NAD+ to provide enough substrate for the reactions catalyzed by CD38 to take place. Indeed, under these conditions the disappearance of NAD+ over the extended incubation times went to completion differently from the experiment shown in Fig.3 A in which NAD+ accumulated because of enzyme inactivation (not shown). Generation of P34 and cADPR was also observed at much lower initial concentrations of NAD+. In these experiments also, no ADPR was added, and the starting concentration of NAD+ was 10 μm (Fig. 5). The amount of CD38 was remarkably lower than in the experimental conditions of Fig. 4 to avoid fast exhaustion of NAD+. Again, both 10 μmNAD+ and fresh recombinant CD38 were added to the incubation mixtures at sequential time intervals to allow the enzymatic reactions to proceed continuously. As shown in Fig. 5, even at these physiological concentrations of NAD+, the formation of P34 progressed slowly and was only slightly lower than that of cADPR. In an attempt to address the physiological occurrence of P34 formation from NAD+, experiments were carried out on intact Namalwa cells (a continuous B-cell-derived line from Burkitt's lymphoma), which have both enzymatic activities of CD38 at their outer surface (42Zocchi E. Franco L. Guida L. Piccini D. Tacchetti C. De Flora A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 396: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) rather than on purified CD38. Using these cells at the same activity levels as purified recombinant CD38 on 10 μmNAD+ (Fig. 5), disappearance of NAD+ and concomitant progressive formation of ADPR, cADPR, and P34 were apparently observed at short time intervals as low as 5–30 min (not shown). In these experiments, however, unequivocal identification of the nucleotide peak eluted at 34 min with authentic P34 was not possible on the basis of UV spectrum because amounts of this peak were too limited. Moreover, the picture of NAD+ metabolism in Namalwa cells was remarkably complicated by additional products of ADPR catabolism including AMP, adenosine, and hypoxanthine, which were generated partly at the cell surface and partly intracellularly. Attempts were then made to establish optimal conditions of P34 formation. In these experiments we used the general setting shown in Fig. 3, i.e. a single addition of CD38 (either purified from erythrocyte membranes or recombinant) and one of NAD+. However, even in these simplified conditions, variations of substrate concentrations (both NAD+ and ADPR) as well as of the pH of the reaction produced no further improvement. Likewise, P34 formation was not enhanced upon performing the incubations in more apolar media such as 6 m methanol to minimize hydrolytic reactions. Control experiments showed that the formation of P34 requires catalysis since it was undetectable in the absence of enzyme. Various enzymes were used to convert P34 into known products (see “Experimental Procedures”). P34 proved not to be a substrate of commercial NAD+glycohydrolase or Aplysia ADP-ribosyl cyclase. On the contrary, P34 was quantitatively converted to ADPR by purified CD38, and no other UV-absorbing or labeled compounds were produced in these conditions. This finding indicates P34 is likely a dimer or an oligomer of ADPR. Mass spectrometry measurements showed that the molecular ion of P34, (M+H)+, has a mass of 1,101. This value corresponds to two individual ADPR molecules joined together with the loss of a water molecule (Fig. 6 A). P34 can, therefore, be designated as (ADPR)2. Incubation of (ADPR)2with dinucleotide pyrophosphatase cleaved the pyrophosphate bond of ADPR, yielding two degradation products. One was identified as AMP by its retention time of 15 min. The other product was designated as P25 since it eluted at 25 min. The m/z value of P25 was 560, which is consistent with an adenine moiety linked to two ribose-phosphate units, i.e. A(R-5-P)2 as shown in Fig. 6 B. Further incubation of A(R-5-P)2 with 5′-nucleotidase led to the form"
https://openalex.org/W2068456400,"Angiotensin II (Ang II) is an octapeptide generated by the sequential proteolytic action of renin and angiotensin converting enzyme on the glycoprotein angiotensinogen. While numerous mammalian tissues have been shown to express some or all of the components of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), the function of most of these tissue RAS remains a matter of conjecture. To test for tissue-specific functions of Ang II and as an alternative to co-expressing all the components of RAS, we have engineered a fusion protein that leads to direct Ang II release within specific tissues. The angiotensin peptide is cleaved from the fusion protein within the secretory pathway by the ubiquitous endoprotease furin and is released from the cell by constitutive secretion. Direct injection of an expression vector encoding such a fusion protein into rat cardiac ventricles results in a highly localized expression of atrial natriuretic peptide mRNA (an angiotensin responsive marker of cardiac hypertrophy), demonstrating the utility of this approach for local targeting of mature peptides to tissues in animal models.

First, renin, a circulating aspartyl protease, cleaves the decapeptide angiotensin I (Ang I) from the amino terminus of the hepatic glycoprotein angiotensinogen. Angiotensin-converting enzyme then removes two amino acids from the carboxyl terminus of Ang I to release the vasoactive peptide Ang II. This enzymatic cascade that occurs in the circulation has also been suggested to take place within certain tissues. Brain, kidney, adrenal and pituitary glands, heart, vasculature and reproductive tissues have been shown to express protein and/or mRNA for many of the components of the RAS including angiotensin receptors (1Ganong W.F.

Activity of local or tissue RAS has been implicated in a variety of physiologic pathways and pathophysiologic conditions including sympathetic nerve transmission, pituitary hormone secretion, migration of eggs in the oviduct, renal development, hypertension, end-stage renal disease, cardiac hypertrophy, and restenosis following vascular injury (reviewed in Refs. 7Ganong W.F. Front. Neuroendocrinol. 1993; 14: 233-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 8Lee M.A. Bohm M. Paul M. Ganten D. Circulation. 1993; 87: IV7-13PubMed Google Scholar, 9Neuringer J.R.

Rev. 1995; 19: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, two findings make it difficult to differentiate between the possibilities that the Ang II mediating these activities is either generated and acts locally, comes from the circulation, or is synthesized locally and acts elsewhere to generate the observed effects. First, in tissues, components of the RAS are often expressed in different cell types or are present in only extremely low levels, making it difficult to be certain that all of the necessary components would encounter each other in biologically relevant concentrations. Second, renin is synthesized as a zymogen that is activated before secretion from the juxtaglomerular cells of the kidney. Removal of the kidneys results in virtual disappearance of renin from the circulation, whereas its precursor, prorenin, remains (11Sealey J.E. Rubattu S. Am. J. Hypertens. 1989; 2: 358-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 12Campbell D.J. Kladis A. Skinner S.L. Whitworth J.A. J.

This finding has raised the question about whether non-renal tissues have the capacity to activate prorenin and thereby carry out the first reaction in the RAS. For these reasons and despite much circumstantial evidence, the functions of tissue RAS remain a matter of conjecture.By using transgenic animals, it is possible to test for the biological effect of tissue expression of the RAS by inducing either loss of function or gain of function mutations. Mice lacking all RAS activity have been generated via homologous recombination by insertional mutagenesis of the angiotensinogen gene (the only known substrate for generation of the angiotensin peptides) (15Tanimoto K.

These mice are hypotensive and exhibit some defects in the development of the kidney, but these experiments shed little light on the normal physiologic functions of tissue RAS. On the other hand, generalized overexpression of components of the RAS in transgenic mice and rats is clearly linked to an increase in blood pressure (17Mullins J.J. Peters J. Ganten D.

To discriminate between circulatory and local effects of transgene expression, it is necessary to target expression of the RAS transgenes to specific tissues. However, this approach is complicated by the fact that all of the RAS components (i.e. angiotensinogen, prorenin, angiotensin-converting enzyme, Ang II receptors, and a prorenin convertase) need to be expressed in the target tissue. In addition, the Ang II generated can elicit biological responses at other sites.As an alternative to co-expressing RAS components, we have engineered a fusion protein that leads to the direct release of an Ang II peptide within specific tissues. This peptide is a natural variant of Ang II found in the skin of the Australian frog Crinia georgiana(fsAngII (21Erspamer V. Melchiorri P. Nakajima T. Yasuhara T. Endean R. Experientia ( Basel ). 1979; 35: 1132-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar)) which has been reported to have pressor activity similar to that of mammalian Ang II (22Khosla M.C. Bumpus F.M. Yasuhara T. Nakajima T. J. Med. Chem. 1981; 24: 885-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Its amino-terminal alanine residue presents a favorable P1′ cleavage site for proteolytic release of fsAngII from the fusion protein by the ubiquitous protease furin (23Watanabe T. Nakagawa T. Ikemizu J. Nagahama M. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8270-8274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, the receptor binding and biological activity of the fsAngII peptide were characterized, and experiments were performed to test for the effect of local over-expression of fsAngII in vivo. Direct injection of the expression vector into the apex of rat hearts leads to local expression of fsAngII and induction of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) expression, a biochemical molecular marker of cardiac hypertrophy in adult cardiac ventricles (24Wei Y.F.

These results demonstrate for the first time the feasibility of using an engineered fusion protein to deliver a peptide with local biological activity in whole animals.DISCUSSIONWe have engineered a fusion protein that leads to the direct release of an Ang II analog within transfected tissues. The angiotensin peptide used in this study is released by a single cleavage, effected by the processing protease furin, leading to the constitutive secretion of the released peptide. Furin, a mammalian homolog of the yeast precursor-processing Kex2 endoprotease, is a Golgi-anchored convertase expressed in all examined tissues and cell lines (42Schalken J.A. Roebroek A.J.

Nakayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22075-22078Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sequence requirements for efficient processing of precursors by furin have been extensively studied, and the RXRXKR amino acid combination located from position −6 to −1 relative to the cleavage site has been shown to lead to the higher cleavage efficiency in cultured cells (29Watanabe T. Murakami K. Nakayama K. FEBS Lett. 1993; 320: 215-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 30Takahashi S. Hatsuzawa K. Watanabe T. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1994; 116: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). fsAngII, Ala-Pro-Gly-[Ile3,Val5]Ang II, is an undecapeptide isolated from the skin of the Australian frog C. georgiana (21Erspamer V. Melchiorri P. Nakajima T. Yasuhara T. Endean R. Experientia ( Basel ). 1979; 35: 1132-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), which was chosen because its amino-terminal alanine residue is a good substrate for efficient processing by furin (23Watanabe T. Nakagawa T. Ikemizu J. Nagahama M. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8270-8274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our results show that efficient cleavage and secretion of fsAngII from the fusion protein requires the presence of a molecular spacer between the Ig fragment and the angiotensin peptide presumably due to steric constraints near the cleavage site. The choice of the prorenin prosegment as a spacer was dictated by our previous success with the engineered furin cleavage in this peptide (27Brechler V. Chu W.N. Baxter J.D. Thibault G. Reudelhuber T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20636-20640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The presence of the Ig fragment in the fusion protein allows for a rapid assessment of cleavage efficiencies with various peptide-containing fusion proteins in cell cultures (Fig. 4 and data not shown) by the simple use of protein A- or G-coupled matrices. Evidence for the cleavage-mediated release of fsAngII peptide is also provided by the finding that introduction of pIgPfsAngII into primary cultures of rat neonatal ventricular myocytes leads to intracellular accumulation and secretion of immunoreactive fsAngII (Table I).Our results demonstrate that fsAngII binds to both the AT1and AT2 Ang II receptor subtypes. While fsAngII binds the AT2 receptor with a similar affinity to that of mammalian Ang II (native Ang II), binding to the AT1 receptor, which is thought to mediate most of the cardiovascular effects of Ang II (34Touyz R.M. Sventek P. Lariviere R. Thibault G. Fareh J. Reudelhuber T. Schiffrin E.L. Hypertension. 1996; 27: 1090-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar,45Ito M. Oliverio M.I. Mannon P.J. Best C.F. Maeda N. Smithies O. Coffman T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3521-3525Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar), occurs with 40-fold lower affinity than native Ang II (Fig.2 A). However, even though fsAngII binding elicits only approximately 65% of the AT1 receptor-mediated release of intracellular calcium, its duration of action on target cells is significantly longer than that of native Ang II (Fig. 3). The combination of these properties may explain the apparent similarities in effective biological concentrations of Ang II and fsAngII on transfected cells. Indeed, Khosla and co-workers (22Khosla M.C. Bumpus F.M. Yasuhara T. Nakajima T. J. Med. Chem. 1981; 24: 885-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) have previously reported that the pressor activity of the synthetic fsAngII in rats was 90.6 ± 5.0% that of human Ang II.Our in vivo injection experiments, using pIgPfsAngII-injected rat cardiac ventricles, demonstrate for the first time that an engineered fusion protein precursor (Ig-prosegment-fsAngII) can be processed to a mature peptide (fsAngII)in vivo and have local biological effects. We are unsure as to the origin of the cells secreting the fsAngII peptide in injected hearts as immunostaining for either the Ig or angiotensin peptides was inconclusive (perhaps due to a low level of expression and/or the rapid secretion of the fusion protein from the cells). However, as the viral promoter/enhancer used in our expression vector has a broad cell specificity, it could conceivably be expressed in either cardiac myocytes or fibroblasts. Analyses of injected rats revealed no significant differences in blood pressure, total heart weight to body weight ratios (Table II), or in circulating Ang II levels (data not shown) between the control and pIgPfsAngII-expressing groups. In contrast to the absence of systemic fsAngII effects, fsAngII induced a significant increase in ANP mRNA levels in the injected portion of the heart (Fig. 5). Enhanced ANP gene expression was not detected distal to the injection site. Coupled with the failure to detect an increase in heart to body weight ratios, these data suggest that the expression of fsAngII is highly localized to cells along the injection site. These data support the in vitro results of Sadoshima et al. (46Sadoshima J. Xu Y. Slayter H.S. Izumo S. Cell. 1993; 75: 977-984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar) who demonstrated the autocrine effects of Ang II in cardiac myocyte hypertrophy in vitroand demonstrate that in vivo local overexpression of fsAngII in the rat heart leads to a highly localized cardiac hypertrophic phenotype.In conclusion, we have described a novel expression vector that can serve as an alternative to co-expressing all the components of the RAS to generate Ang II. This type of approach could also be extended with the use of tissue-specific genes in transgenic animals to test the importance of other bioactive peptides on organ physiology. Angiotensin II (Ang II) 1The abbreviations used are: Ang II, angiotensin II; RAS, renin-angiotensin system; AT, angiotensin receptor; ANP, atrial natriuretic peptide; fs, frog skin; [Ca2+]i, intracellular free calcium concentration. 1The abbreviations used are: Ang II, angiotensin II; RAS, renin-angiotensin system; AT, angiotensin receptor; ANP, atrial natriuretic peptide; fs, frog skin; [Ca2+]i, intracellular free calcium concentration. is the peptide product of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and is generated via two sequential proteolytic steps. First, renin, a circulating aspartyl protease, cleaves the decapeptide angiotensin I (Ang I) from the amino terminus of the hepatic glycoprotein angiotensinogen. Angiotensin-converting enzyme then removes two amino acids from the carboxyl terminus of Ang I to release the vasoactive peptide Ang II. This enzymatic cascade that occurs in the circulation has also been suggested to take place within certain tissues. Brain, kidney, adrenal and pituitary glands, heart, vasculature and reproductive tissues have been shown to express protein and/or mRNA for many of the components of the RAS including angiotensin receptors (1Ganong W.F.

Activity of local or tissue RAS has been implicated in a variety of physiologic pathways and pathophysiologic conditions including sympathetic nerve transmission, pituitary hormone secretion, migration of eggs in the oviduct, renal development, hypertension, end-stage renal disease, cardiac hypertrophy, and restenosis following vascular injury (reviewed in Refs. 7Ganong W.F.

However, two findings make it difficult to differentiate between the possibilities that the Ang II mediating these activities is either generated and acts locally, comes from the circulation, or is synthesized locally and acts elsewhere to generate the observed effects. First, in tissues, components of the RAS are often expressed in different cell types or are present in only extremely low levels, making it difficult to be certain that all of the necessary components would encounter each other in biologically relevant concentrations. Second, renin is synthesized as a zymogen that is activated before secretion from the juxtaglomerular cells of the kidney. Removal of the kidneys results in virtual disappearance of renin from the circulation, whereas its precursor, prorenin, remains (11Sealey J.E. Rubattu S. Am. J. Hypertens. 1989; 2: 358-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 12Campbell D.J. Kladis A. Skinner S.L. Whitworth J.A. J.

Nishizawa Y. Morii H. Murakami K. Yamamoto K. J. Clin. Endocrinol. & Metab. 1992; 74: 680-684PubMed Google Scholar). This finding has raised the question about whether non-renal tissues have the capacity to activate prorenin and thereby carry out the first reaction in the RAS. For these reasons and despite much circumstantial evidence, the functions of tissue RAS remain a matter of conjecture. By using transgenic animals, it is possible to test for the biological effect of tissue expression of the RAS by inducing either loss of function or gain of function mutations. Mice lacking all RAS activity have been generated via homologous recombination by insertional mutagenesis of the angiotensinogen gene (the only known substrate for generation of the angiotensin peptides) (15Tanimoto K.

These mice are hypotensive and exhibit some defects in the development of the kidney, but these experiments shed little light on the normal physiologic functions of tissue RAS. On the other hand, generalized overexpression of components of the RAS in transgenic mice and rats is clearly linked to an increase in blood pressure (17Mullins J.J. Peters J. Ganten D.

To discriminate between circulatory and local effects of transgene expression, it is necessary to target expression of the RAS transgenes to specific tissues. However, this approach is complicated by the fact that all of the RAS components (i.e. angiotensinogen, prorenin, angiotensin-converting enzyme, Ang II receptors, and a prorenin convertase) need to be expressed in the target tissue. In addition, the Ang II generated can elicit biological responses at other sites. As an alternative to co-expressing RAS components, we have engineered a fusion protein that leads to the direct release of an Ang II peptide within specific tissues. This peptide is a natural variant of Ang II found in the skin of the Australian frog Crinia georgiana(fsAngII (21Erspamer V. Melchiorri P. Nakajima T. Yasuhara T. Endean R. Experientia ( Basel ). 1979; 35: 1132-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar)) which has been reported to have pressor activity similar to that of mammalian Ang II (22Khosla M.C. Bumpus F.M. Yasuhara T. Nakajima T. J. Med. Chem. 1981; 24: 885-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Its amino-terminal alanine residue presents a favorable P1′ cleavage site for proteolytic release of fsAngII from the fusion protein by the ubiquitous protease furin (23Watanabe T. Nakagawa T. Ikemizu J. Nagahama M. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8270-8274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, the receptor binding and biological activity of the fsAngII peptide were characterized, and experiments were performed to test for the effect of local over-expression of fsAngII in vivo. Direct injection of the expression vector into the apex of rat hearts leads to local expression of fsAngII and induction of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) expression, a biochemical molecular marker of cardiac hypertrophy in adult cardiac ventricles (24Wei Y.F.

Physiol. 1988; 255: E388-E396PubMed Google Scholar). These results demonstrate for the first time the feasibility of using an engineered fusion protein to deliver a peptide with local biological activity in whole animals. DISCUSSIONWe have engineered a fusion protein that leads to the direct release of an Ang II analog within transfected tissues. The angiotensin peptide used in this study is released by a single cleavage, effected by the processing protease furin, leading to the constitutive secretion of the released peptide. Furin, a mammalian homolog of the yeast precursor-processing Kex2 endoprotease, is a Golgi-anchored convertase expressed in all examined tissues and cell lines (42Schalken J.A. Roebroek A.J. Oomen P.P. Wagenaar S.S. Debruyne F.M. Bloemers H.P. Van de Ven W.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 80: 1545-1549Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 43Bresnahan P.A. Leduc R. Thomas L. Thorner J.

Nakayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22075-22078Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sequence requirements for efficient processing of precursors by furin have been extensively studied, and the RXRXKR amino acid combination located from position −6 to −1 relative to the cleavage site has been shown to lead to the higher cleavage efficiency in cultured cells (29Watanabe T. Murakami K. Nakayama K. FEBS Lett. 1993; 320: 215-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 30Takahashi S. Hatsuzawa K. Watanabe T. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1994; 116: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). fsAngII, Ala-Pro-Gly-[Ile3,Val5]Ang II, is an undecapeptide isolated from the skin of the Australian frog C. georgiana (21Erspamer V. Melchiorri P. Nakajima T. Yasuhara T. Endean R. Experientia ( Basel ). 1979; 35: 1132-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), which was chosen because its amino-terminal alanine residue is a good substrate for efficient processing by furin (23Watanabe T. Nakagawa T. Ikemizu J. Nagahama M. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8270-8274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our results show that efficient cleavage and secretion of fsAngII from the fusion protein requires the presence of a molecular spacer between the Ig fragment and the angiotensin peptide presumably due to steric constraints near the cleavage site. The choice of the prorenin prosegment as a spacer was dictated by our previous success with the engineered furin cleavage in this peptide (27Brechler V. Chu W.N. Baxter J.D. Thibault G. Reudelhuber T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20636-20640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The presence of the Ig fragment in the fusion protein allows for a rapid assessment of cleavage efficiencies with various peptide-containing fusion proteins in cell cultures (Fig. 4 and data not shown) by the simple use of protein A- or G-coupled matrices. Evidence for the cleavage-mediated release of fsAngII peptide is also provided by the finding that introduction of pIgPfsAngII into primary cultures of rat neonatal ventricular myocytes leads to intracellular accumulation and secretion of immunoreactive fsAngII (Table I).Our results demonstrate that fsAngII binds to both the AT1and AT2 Ang II receptor subtypes. While fsAngII binds the AT2 receptor with a similar affinity to that of mammalian Ang II (native Ang II), binding to the AT1 receptor, which is thought to mediate most of the cardiovascular effects of Ang II (34Touyz R.M.

Maeda N. Smithies O. Coffman T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3521-3525Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar), occurs with 40-fold lower affinity than native Ang II (Fig.2 A). However, even though fsAngII binding elicits only approximately 65% of the AT1 receptor-mediated release of intracellular calcium, its duration of action on target cells is significantly longer than that of native Ang II (Fig. 3). The combination of these properties may explain the apparent similarities in effective biological concentrations of Ang II and fsAngII on transfected cells. Indeed, Khosla and co-workers (22Khosla M.C. Bumpus F.M. Yasuhara T. Nakajima T. J. Med. Chem. 1981; 24: 885-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) have previously reported that the pressor activity of the synthetic fsAngII in rats was 90.6 ± 5.0% that of human Ang II.Our in vivo injection experiments, using pIgPfsAngII-injected rat cardiac ventricles, demonstrate for the first time that an engineered fusion protein precursor (Ig-prosegment-fsAngII) can be processed to a mature peptide (fsAngII)in vivo and have local biological effects. We are unsure as to the origin of the cells secreting the fsAngII peptide in injected hearts as immunostaining for either the Ig or angiotensin peptides was inconclusive (perhaps due to a low level of expression and/or the rapid secretion of the fusion protein from the cells). However, as the viral promoter/enhancer used in our expression vector has a broad cell specificity, it could conceivably be expressed in either cardiac myocytes or fibroblasts. Analyses of injected rats revealed no significant differences in blood pressure, total heart weight to body weight ratios (Table II), or in circulating Ang II levels (data not shown) between the control and pIgPfsAngII-expressing groups. In contrast to the absence of systemic fsAngII effects, fsAngII induced a significant increase in ANP mRNA levels in the injected portion of the heart (Fig. 5).

https://openalex.org/W1993200824,"Macrophages are a significant source of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and apolipoprotein E (apo E) in the developing arterial wall lesion, and each of these proteins can importantly modulate lipid and lipoprotein metabolism by arterial wall cells. LPL and apo E share a number of cell surface binding sites, including proteoglycans, and we have previously shown that proteoglycans are important for modulating net secretion of apoprotein E from macrophages. We therefore evaluated a potential role for LPL in modulating net secretion of macrophage-derived apo E. In pulse-chase experiments, addition of LPL during the chase period produced a decrease in secretion of apoprotein E from human monocyte-derived macrophages, from the human monocytic THP1 cell line, and from J774 cells transfected to constitutively express a human apo E cDNA. LPL similarly reduced apo E secretion when it was prebound to the macrophage cell surface at 4 °C. A native LPL particle was required to modulate apo E secretion; addition of monomers and aggregates did not produce the same effect. Depletion of cell surface proteoglycans by a 72-h incubation in 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-d-xyloside did not attenuate the ability of LPL to reduce apo E secretion. However, addition of receptor-associated protein attenuated the effect of LPL on apo E secretion. Although LPL could mediate removal of exogenously added apo E from the culture medium, detailed pulse-chase analysis suggested that it primarily prevented release of newly synthesized apo E from the cell layer. Cholesterol loading of cells or antibodies to the low density lipoprotein receptor attenuated LPL effects on apo E secretion. We postulate that LPL sequesters endogenously synthesized apo E at the cell surface by a low density lipoprotein receptor-dependent mechanism. Such post-translational regulation of macrophage apo E secretion by LPL could significantly influence apo E accumulation in arterial vessel wall lesions."

We have overexpressed p50 in Escherichia coli and have characterized the recombinant protein. p50 was readily overexpressed using the pET vector as an insoluble protein. A procedure was developed for its purification and renaturation. Examination of the physicochemical properties of renatured p50 showed that it is a monomeric protein with an apparent molecular weight of 60,000, a Stokes radius of 34 Å, and a sedimentation coefficient of 4.1 S. Its physical properties were indistinguishable from p50 expressed as a soluble protein using the pTACTAC vector. Examination of the effects of recombinant p50 on the activity of DNA polymerase δ showed that p50 is able to slightly stimulate (about 2-fold) the activity of the recombinant 125-kDa catalytic subunit using poly(dA)·oligo(dT) as a template in the absence of proliferating cell nuclear antigen. In the presence of proliferating cell nulear antigen, activity is stimulated about 5-fold. Seven stable hybridoma cell lines were established that produced monoclonal antibodies against p50. One of these antibodies (13D5) inhibited the activity of calf thymus DNA polymerase δ. This antibody, when coupled to a solid support, also was found to provide a method for the immunoafffinity purification of recombinant p50 and of DNA polymerase δ from calf thymus or HeLa extracts.

In addition to PCNA, a number of other accessory proteins are required for the assembly of a functional replication complex at the leading strand of the replication fork. These include the multi-subunit replication factor C (RF-C) complex and replication protein A (RP-A), a single-stranded DNA-binding protein (5Waga S. Stillman B.

It was suggested that the 50-kDa polypeptide is required for the stimulation of DNA polymerase δ by PCNA (9Goulian M. Herrmann S.M. Sackett J.W. Grimm S.L. J. Biol.

Human pol δ catalytic subunit expressed in the vaccinia virus system also showed a slight increase in activity in the presence of PCNA (11Zhang P. Frugulhetti I. Jiang Y. Holt G.L. Condit R.C.

This increase in activity is significantly lower than the 34-fold stimulation of the native human DNA polymerase δ core reported previously in our laboratory (7Lee M.Y.W.T. Jiang Y. Zhang S.J.

The pol δ catalytic subunits of both yeast (10Brown W.C. Campbell J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21706-21710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and mammalian p125 (11Zhang P. Frugulhetti I.

Chem. 1995; 270: 7993-7998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) have been overexpressed and exhibit only a slight response to PCNA. Highly purified human placental pol δ preparations purified by conventional means are stimulated at least 10–20-fold and may reach above 30-fold depending on the assay conditions (7Lee M.Y.W.T. Jiang Y. Zhang S.J. Toomey N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2423-2429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Zhang P. Frugulhetti I. Jiang Y. Holt G.L. Condit R.C. Lee M.Y.W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7993-7998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In the studies reported here, we find that the p125 subunit of pol δ overexpressed in baculovirus is stimulated by PCNA less than 2-fold. Thus, our findings are consistent with other reports on the behavior of the isolated p125 subunit in regard to either a lack of, or a low level of, sensitivity to PCNA. However, in the presence of p50 pol δ activity is stimulated about 5-fold by PCNA suggesting that the 50-kDa subunit is required for the stimulation of DNA polymerase δ by PCNA.The effects of p50 on recombinant p125 are small, and the failure to induce a strong PCNA sensitivity suggests that the reconstitution of a native enzyme was not achieved. Nevertheless, there clearly is an interaction between the two recombinant proteins based on the functional effects of p50 on p125, and the demonstration of a protein-protein interaction via the ELISA system. Several reasons for the failure to observe a high level of PCNA responsiveness are possible. First, either one of the recombinant proteins could be improperly folded or lacking in a required post-translational modification. Second, the proper folding of both proteins may require their co-expression or may require the action of specific chaperone proteins. Third, the formation of the core enzyme may require the presence of other subunits. With regard to the first issue, we have characterized recombinant p50 to confirm that it behaves as a globular protein based on its physicochemical properties and by comparison of its functional effects on pol δ p125 with that of a soluble form of p50 isolated by expression in the pTACTAC vector. At the present time it is not known if p50 is subject to post-translational modification, although we have preliminary evidence that p50 is phosphorylatedin vitro.2 With regard to the second issue, one possible avenue would be to co-express the two proteins in the baculovirus system. It should be noted that our attempts at separation of the two subunits from the native enzyme were unsuccessful and could only be achieved after denaturation of the complex, which showed that their interaction was extremely strong. Alternatively, the low level of PCNA responsiveness could be due to a situation where only a small fraction of p125 is reconstituted with p50.It seems unlikely that p50 fulfills a simple structural role in maintaining pol δ function, based on studies of yeast genes that encode p50 homologues. A BLAST search of the p50 protein sequence against the GenBankTM data base showed that it has significant identity with a Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene,HYS2, which encodes a protein of 487 residues corresponding to a molecular mass of 55 kDa (22Sugimoto K. Sakamoto Y. Takahashi O. Matsumoto K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3493-3500Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Alignment of the protein sequences shows that there is a 34% identity between human p50 and the Hys2 protein so that the latter is a likely candidate for the yeast counterpart of the mammalian p50 subunit of pol δ. Genetic analysis of the HYS2 gene (22Sugimoto K. Sakamoto Y. Takahashi O. Matsumoto K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3493-3500Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) showed that it is essential for DNA replication in S. cerevisiae. Additionally, HYS2mutants display supersensitivity to hydroxyurea, increased levels of mitotic chromosome loss, and recombination. More recently, MacNeillet al. (23MacNeill S.A. Moreno S. Reynolds N. Nurse P. Fantes P.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4613-4628Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) cloned a Schizosaccharomyces pombegene, cdc1 +, which displays significant sequence identity (34%) to both the p50 subunit of pol δ and toHYS2. A physical interaction of the Cdc1 protein with the yeast pol δ protein was demonstrated by in vitroco-immunoprecipitation. Thus, genetic studies have pointed to an important requirement for the pol δ small subunit in yeast, sincecdc1 and HYS2 mutations lead to defective DNA synthesis and/or repair as well as hypersensitivity to hydroxyurea and methyl methane sulfonate. Cellular recognition of these defects in replicated DNA leads to the abnormalities in cell cycle progression 22, 23).The findings in both budding and fission yeast that genetic screens for genes required for cell cycle progression have yielded genes encoding the small subunit of pol δ are highly indicative of an important function for this subunit. The p50 subunit could be critical in providing for the interaction of pol δ with other replication proteins, or it may be that regulation of pol δ may be mediated through p50. This function may also involve the interaction of the small subunit of pol δ with another protein which is encoded bycdc27 +, another gene that is required for cell cycle progression (23MacNeill S.A. Moreno S. Reynolds N. Nurse P. Fantes P.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4613-4628Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). It was demonstrated thatcdc1 + overexpression is able to rescue mutants of cdc27 + and that the gene product ofcdc27 + interacts with the Cdc1 protein. In the mammalian system, no counterpart of the Cdc27 protein has been reported, although as noted by MacNeill et al. (23MacNeill S.A. Moreno S. Reynolds N. Nurse P. Fantes P.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4613-4628Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), its association with the core enzyme might not survive the multiple chromatography steps required for its purification. In this regard, it may be noted that during the immunoaffinity purification of pol δ from calf thymus (17Jiang Y. Zhang S.J. Wu S.M. Lee M.Y.W.T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 320: 297-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), there is a persistent appearance of a polypeptide of 40 kDa. Further investigation will be required to determine the functional role of p50 as well as the identification and isolation of the proteins that interact with p50. The availability of overexpressed p50 as well as the antibodies which we have characterized may be useful tools for these studies.

With regard to the first issue, we have characterized recombinant p50 to confirm that it behaves as a globular protein based on its physicochemical properties and by comparison of its functional effects on pol δ p125 with that of a soluble form of p50 isolated by expression in the pTACTAC vector. At the present time it is not known if p50 is subject to post-translational modification, although we have preliminary evidence that p50 is phosphorylatedin vitro.2 With regard to the second issue, one possible avenue would be to co-express the two proteins in the baculovirus system. It should be noted that our attempts at separation of the two subunits from the native enzyme were unsuccessful and could only be achieved after denaturation of the complex, which showed that their interaction was extremely strong. Alternatively, the low level of PCNA responsiveness could be due to a situation where only a small fraction of p125 is reconstituted with p50. It seems unlikely that p50 fulfills a simple structural role in maintaining pol δ function, based on studies of yeast genes that encode p50 homologues. A BLAST search of the p50 protein sequence against the GenBankTM data base showed that it has significant identity with a Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene,HYS2, which encodes a protein of 487 residues corresponding to a molecular mass of 55 kDa (22Sugimoto K. Sakamoto Y. Takahashi O. Matsumoto K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3493-3500Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Alignment of the protein sequences shows that there is a 34% identity between human p50 and the Hys2 protein so that the latter is a likely candidate for the yeast counterpart of the mammalian p50 subunit of pol δ. Genetic analysis of the HYS2 gene (22Sugimoto K. Sakamoto Y. Takahashi O. Matsumoto K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3493-3500Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) showed that it is essential for DNA replication in S. cerevisiae. Additionally, HYS2mutants display supersensitivity to hydroxyurea, increased levels of mitotic chromosome loss, and recombination. More recently, MacNeillet al. (23MacNeill S.A. Moreno S. Reynolds N. Nurse P. Fantes P.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4613-4628Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) cloned a Schizosaccharomyces pombegene, cdc1 +, which displays significant sequence identity (34%) to both the p50 subunit of pol δ and toHYS2. A physical interaction of the Cdc1 protein with the yeast pol δ protein was demonstrated by in vitroco-immunoprecipitation. Thus, genetic studies have pointed to an important requirement for the pol δ small subunit in yeast, sincecdc1 and HYS2 mutations lead to defective DNA synthesis and/or repair as well as hypersensitivity to hydroxyurea and methyl methane sulfonate. Cellular recognition of these defects in replicated DNA leads to the abnormalities in cell cycle progression 22, 23). The findings in both budding and fission yeast that genetic screens for genes required for cell cycle progression have yielded genes encoding the small subunit of pol δ are highly indicative of an important function for this subunit. The p50 subunit could be critical in providing for the interaction of pol δ with other replication proteins, or it may be that regulation of pol δ may be mediated through p50. This function may also involve the interaction of the small subunit of pol δ with another protein which is encoded bycdc27 +, another gene that is required for cell cycle progression (23MacNeill S.A. Moreno S. Reynolds N. Nurse P. Fantes P.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4613-4628Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). It was demonstrated thatcdc1 + overexpression is able to rescue mutants of cdc27 + and that the gene product ofcdc27 + interacts with the Cdc1 protein. In the mammalian system, no counterpart of the Cdc27 protein has been reported, although as noted by MacNeill et al. (23MacNeill S.A. Moreno S. Reynolds N. Nurse P. Fantes P.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4613-4628Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), its association with the core enzyme might not survive the multiple chromatography steps required for its purification. In this regard, it may be noted that during the immunoaffinity purification of pol δ from calf thymus (17Jiang Y. Zhang S.J. Wu S.M. Lee M.Y.W.T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 320: 297-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), there is a persistent appearance of a polypeptide of 40 kDa. Further investigation will be required to determine the functional role of p50 as well as the identification and isolation of the proteins that interact with p50. The availability of overexpressed p50 as well as the antibodies which we have characterized may be useful tools for these studies."

An alanine scanning mutagenesis approach has been applied to analyze the role of loop residues from Asp51 to Arg64 in substrate binding and stability by means of equilibrium urea denaturation, enzyme thermotolerance, and kinetics. The DeltaDeltaGU between oxidized and reduced forms is approximately constant for all mutants, with a contribution of 5.3 +/- 0.2 kcal.mol-1 for the disulfide bridge to protein stability. A good correlation is observed between DeltaGU values by reversible unfolding and enzyme thermotolerance. The N57A mutant, however, is more thermotolerant than the wild-type enzyme, whereas it is slightly less stable to reversible urea denaturation. Mutants with a 2-fold and kcat < 5% of the wild-type values. These mutated residues are directly involved in substrate binding or in hydrophobic packing of the loop. Interestingly, the mutation M58A yields an enzyme that is more active than the wild-type enzyme (7-fold increase in kcat), but it is slightly less stable."

The regulation of this activity by agonists was explored. Membrane phospholipase D activity was increased by treatment of cells with the phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) or with nerve growth factor. The ability of PMA to activate PLD was confirmed in intact PC12 cells. Basal activity of PLD in membranes was reduced in RG20, a PC12 cell line overexpressing the human α2A-adrenergic receptor.

However, incubation of RG20 cells with the α2-adrenergic antagonist rauwolscine or with pertussis toxin increased membrane PLD activity and restored activation of PLD by PMA. These data suggest that the effects of the overexpressed α2A-adrenergic receptor on PLD activity are mediated by precoupling of the receptor to the heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein, Gi, but are independent of adenylate cyclase regulation.

In this study, we explore the role of a heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein, Gi, in the regulation of PLD activity in a neuronal cell line. Signal transduction pathways have been extensively studied in PC12, a rat phaeochromocytoma cell line that can be induced to differentiate to a neuronal phenotype. PC12 transfected with the α2A-adrenergic receptor (α2AAR) have been used to examine coupling of this receptor to its effectors (21Sato M. Kataoka R. Dingus J. Wilcox M. Hildebrandt J.D. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15269-15276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The α2AAR couples to the heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein Gi, is widely expressed, and mediates the central hypotensive effects of α2 agonists (22MacMillan L.B. Hein L. Smith M.S. Piascik M.T. Limbird L.E. Science. 1996; 273: 801-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 23Link R.E. Desai K. Hein L. Stevens M.E. Chruscinski A. Bernstein D. Barsh G.S. Kobilka B.K. Science. 1996; 273: 803-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Gi proteins are heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins containing an αi subunit. They are coupled to inhibition of adenylate cyclase as well as to pathways involving additional effectors, such as small GTP-binding proteins (24Bokoch G.M. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1290-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In this study, α2AAR-expressing PC12 cells were used to examine the potential role of Gi in regulating PLD activity. PC12 cell lines were maintained on Primaria plastic (Falcon) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DME) supplemented with either 10% fetal calf serum or 7.5% fetal calf serum plus 2.5% horse serum. PC12K (a wild-type cell line) and RG20 (stably transfected with human α2A/DAR) (21Sato M. Kataoka R. Dingus J. Wilcox M. Hildebrandt J.D. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15269-15276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) were grown for 3–5 days in 35- or 100-mm dishes. Cytosolic and membrane extracts were prepared as described (18Ella K.M. Meier G.P. Bradshaw C.D. Huffman K.M. Spivey E.C. Meier K.E. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 218: 136-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated in culture medium at 37 °C, washed, resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 80 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 10 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, and 2 mm dithiothreitol), sonicated, and sedimented at 100,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (“cytosol”) was used for ERK assays and the pellet (“membranes”) for PLD assays. Protein concentrations in cell extracts were determined using Coomassie reagent (Pierce). PLD activity was measured in vitrousing the fluorescent substrate BODIPY-phosphatidylcholine (BPC), 2-decanoyl-1-(O-(11-(4, 4-difluoro-5,7-dimethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene-3-propionyl)amino)undecyl)sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (Molecular Probes). BODIPY is a trademark of Molecular Probes, Inc. The assay was performed, as described previously (18Ella K.M. Meier G.P. Bradshaw C.D. Huffman K.M. Spivey E.C. Meier K.E. Anal.

BODIPY-labeled products were separated by thin-layer chromatography and quantitated by Molecular Dynamics FluorImager or Helena Laboratories scanning densitometer. Product formation was calculated as percent of total fluorescence. PLD activity was assessed in intact cells as described previously (18Ella K.M. Meier G.P. Bradshaw C.D. Huffman K.M. Spivey E.C.

Briefly, cells were incubated overnight with [3H]palmitate or [3H]oleate, washed, and incubated in triplicate with agonists and 0.5% ethanol at 37 °C in DME, 10 mm HEPES. Products were separated by TLC; PEt and PA were quantitated by liquid scintillation spectrometry after scraping from the plate. Product formation was calculated as a percent of total radioactivity recovered from each lane. ERK activity was assessed in vitro as described previously (10Jones L.G. Ella K.M. Bradshaw C.D.

Results were normalized for cytosolic protein. A fluorescent in vitro assay using a BODIPY-labeled substrate, BPC, was used to screen for PLD activity in membranes prepared from a variety of cell types. PC12K cells were observed to express a very high level of membrane PLD activity as compared with other cell types (data not shown). This activity and its regulation were therefore further characterized. PC12K membranes convert BPC to PBt, the transphosphatidylation product generated by PLD in the presence of butanol (Fig. 1 A). Most of the PLD activity was membrane-bound, with cytosol producing only 21% of the PBt seen in membranes with equal amounts of cellular protein (data not shown). PBt can be metabolized to lyso-PBt by a calcium-independent PLA2 in membranes from mammalian cells (18Ella K.M. Meier G.P. Bradshaw C.D. Huffman K.M. Spivey E.C. Meier K.E. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 218: 136-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), including PC12K (Fig. 1 A). PLD and PLA2 activities were similar between undifferentiated and NGF-differentiated cells. The phorbol ester PMA generally increases PLD in mammalian cells. PMA activated PLD in intact undifferentiated PC12K cells, as seen using either [3H]oleate (Fig. 1 B) or [3H]palmitate (data not shown) as metabolic label. The greatest accumulation of PEt occurred in the first 15 min after PMA addition. PEt did not accumulate in cells incubated without PMA (data not shown). The potential influence of the α2A/DAR, a Gi-coupled receptor, was examined in a PC12 cell line overexpressing this receptor. Radioligand binding, using the ligand [3H]RX 82102, confirmed that RG20 overexpressed the α2A/DAR (7585 fmol/mg of protein in RG20versus 78 in PC12K) (data not shown). Basal membrane PLD activity was substantially decreased in α2AAR-expressing cells, as shown for two clonal RG20 lines (Fig.2 A). This decrease was not due to enhanced degradation of PBt by PLA2, since lyso-PBt production was not greater in RG20 than in PC12K. Calcium-independent PLA2activity, as measured by lyso-PC production, was similar in both cell lines (Fig. 2 A). The abilities of PC12 and RG20 cells to activate PLD were compared. In PC12K, but not RG20, treatment with PMA or NGF increased membrane PLD activity (Fig. 2 B). PMA treatment has been shown to activate ERK mitogen-activated protein kinases in PC12 cells (25Robbins D.J. Cobb M.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 299-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The lack of response to PMA was not due to an inability of RG20 cells to respond to phorbol ester, since a 15-min treatment with PMA activated cytosolic ERK mitogen-activated protein kinases to a similar extent in PC12K and RG20, as assessed by an in vitro assay using myelin basic protein as substrate (data not shown). The reduced ability of PMA to activate PLD in RG20 was also apparent in assays using intact cells (Fig. 2 C). The intact cell assay could not be used to assess basal PLD activity, since radioactivity co-migrating with PEt was not significantly different for untreated cells incubated in the absence or presence of ethanol (data not shown). The ability of the in vitro assay to quantitate basal PLD activity is thus advantageous. The mechanism by which by α2AR expression inhibited PLD activity was explored. The α2AR is coupled to inhibition of adenylate cyclase. However, dibutyryl cAMP (10 μm) had no effect on membrane or cytosolic PLD activity in PC12K or RG20 cells at times from 15 to 60 min (data not shown), suggesting that the effect of α2AR expression was not due to decreased cAMP levels. Forskolin (10 μm) and epinephrine (1 μm) likewise had no effect on membrane PLD activity (data not shown). The lack of effect of epinephrine suggested that the overexpressed α2AAR might be functionally “precoupled” to Gi in RG20, as indicated previously for this cell line (27Tian W.-N. Duzic E. Lanier S.M. Deth R.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 524-531PubMed Google Scholar,28Shi S.G. Deth R.C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 271: 1520-2527PubMed Google Scholar). PC12K and RG20 were therefore incubated with rauwolscine, an α2AR antagonist, to uncouple the receptor from Gi. Rauwolscine increased membrane PLD activity in RG20, but had no significant effect in PC12K (Fig.3 A). One explanation for the fact that rauwolscine did not restore PLD levels in RG20 cells to that seen in PC12K cells is that a portion of the precoupled α2AR receptors in RG20 cells are rauwolscine-resistant, as suggested previously (28Shi S.G. Deth R.C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 271: 1520-2527PubMed Google Scholar). Incubation with pertussis toxin, an inhibitor of Gαi-mediated signaling, likewise increased membrane PLD activity in RG20 (Fig. 3 B). Rauwolscine and pertussis toxin had no effect on PLD activity in PC12K. These findings were confirmed by PLD assays using intact cells (Fig. 3 C). Pertussis toxin alone slightly increased basal PLD activity in both PC12K and RG20. Neither pertussis toxin nor rauwolscine significantly increased activation of PLD in response to PMA in PC12K (Fig. 3 C, left). In contrast, both pertussis toxin and rauwolscine enhanced PMA-induced PLD activation in RG2 (Fig. 3 C, right). Rauwolscine alone had no effect on PLD activity in intact PC12K or RG20 cells (data not shown). These results support the hypothesis that the effect of α2AR overexpression on PLD activity is mediated by precoupling of the receptor to Gαi. In summary, membrane PLD activity in PC12 cells is positively regulated by PMA and NGF and negatively regulated by the α2AR. Previous reports have suggested that α2-agonists, with protein kinase C co-activation, can stimulate PLD activity in myristate-labeled intact or broken PC12 cells transfected with the α2AR (29Jinsi A. Deth R.C. FASEB J. 1995; 9: A105Google Scholar, 30Deth R.C. Jinsi A. FASEB J. 1995; 9: A951Google Scholar). We observed that an α2-selective agonist did not significantly enhance the ability of PMA to activate PLD in intact oleate-labeled RG20 cells (data not shown). More than one form of PLD is expressed by mammalian cells (31Morris A.J. Engebrecht J. Frohman M.A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1996; 17: 182-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 32Hammond S.M. Jenco J.M. Nakashima S. Cadwallader K. Gu Q.-M. Cook S. Nozawa Y. Prestwich G.D.

In one study, PMA-activated PLD was detected in fibroblasts isotopically labeled with either a fatty acid or an alkyl-lyso-PC precursor, while v-Src-activated PLD could be detected only using the fatty acid precursor (14Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12949-12952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). In Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, PMA-activated PLD preferentially utilizes alkyl-PCs (33Daniel L.W. Huang C. Strum J.C. Smitherman P.K. Greene D. Wykle R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21519-21526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The alkyl-PC substrate used in our in vitro assays may thus detect a PLD preferentially regulated by Gi. Other forms likely contribute to the activity measured in intact cells. Immunoblots obtained using an anti-PLD antibody (34Bradshaw C.D. Sansbury H.M. Ella K.M. Thomas A.L. Wisehart-Johnson A.E. Qi C. Meier K.E. Immunol. Lett. 1996; 53: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) suggest that expression of PLD is similar in PC12K and RG20 (data not shown). The mechanism of the novel negative interaction between Giand PLD is unknown. Gαi2, a pertussin toxin-sensitive G protein, can positively regulate PLA2 (35Winitz S. Gupta S.K. Qian N.-X. Heasley L.E. Nemenoff R.A. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2869-2895Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Negative regulation of PLD by Gi could involve cross-talk between heterotrimeric Gi and small GTP-binding proteins (24Bokoch G.M. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1290-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). For example, the α2AR can activate ras via a Gi-mediated pathway when transfected into fibroblasts (36Alblas J. van Corven E.J. Hordijk P.L. Milligan G. Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22235-22238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, activation of rho is induced via the pertussis-toxin insensitive proteins Gα12 and Gα13, but not by Gαi2 or Gαq, in fibroblasts (37Buhl A.M. Johnson N.L. Dhanasekaran N. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24631-34634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Gα12 can also activate signaling mediated by Ras and Rac (38Collins L.R. Minden A. Karin M. Brown J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17349-17353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Since rho activates some forms of PLD, a previously unidentified negative influence of a Gi component on the function of Rho (or another small GTP-binding protein) could potentially inhibit PLD activity. However, it should be noted that some agonists (e.g. LPA) bind to a Gi-coupled receptor that activates both rho (39Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12949-12952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar) and PLD (40van der Bend R.L. de Widt J. van Corven E.J. Moolenaar W.H. van Blitterswijk W.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which protein kinase C isoforms activate PLD remain to be defined, but may involve protein-protein interactions rather than phosphorylation (41Conricode K.M. Brewer K.A. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7199-7202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Ohguchi K. Banno Y. Nakashima S. Nozawa Y. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 4504-4510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the effects of PMA on PLD activity in fibroblasts were recently shown to be independent of Rac (44Hess J.A. Ross A.H. Qiu R.-G. Symons M. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1615-1620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), but partially dependent on Rho (45Malcolm K.C. Elliott C.M. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13135-13139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The roles of heterotrimeric G-proteins in PLD regulation appear worthy of further study.
