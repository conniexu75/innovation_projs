https://openalex.org/W1967851015,"Inflammation derived from pathogen infection involves the activation of toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling. Despite the established immunomodulatory activities of probiotics, studies relating the ability of such bacteria to inhibit the TLR signaling pathways are limited or controversial. In a previous study we showed that Lactobacillus amylovorus DSM 16698T, a novel lactobacillus isolated from unweaned pigs, protects the intestinal cells from enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) K88 infection through cytokine regulation. In the present study we investigated whether the ability of L. amylovorus to counteract the inflammatory status triggered by ETEC in intestine is elicited through inhibition of the TLR4 signaling pathway. We used the human intestinal Caco-2/TC7 cells and intestinal explants isolated from 5 week-old crossbreed Pietrain/Duroc/Large-White piglets, treated with ETEC, L. amylovorus or L. amylovorus cell free supernatant, either alone or simultaneously with ETEC. Western blot analysis showed that L. amylovorus and its cell free supernatant suppress the activation of the different steps of TLR4 signaling in Caco-2/TC7 cells and pig explants, by inhibiting the ETEC induced increase in the level of TLR4 and MyD88, the phosphorylation of the IKKα, IKKβ, IκBα and NF-κB subunit p65, as well as the over-production of inflammatory cytokines IL-8 and IL-1β. The immunofluorescence analysis confirms the lack of phospho-p65 translocation into the nucleus. These anti-inflammatory effects are achieved through modulation of the negative regulators Tollip and IRAK-M. We also found that L. amylovorus blocks the up-regulation of the extracellular heat shock protein (Hsp)72 and Hsp90, that are critical for TLR4 function. By using anti-TLR2 antibody, we demonstrate that TLR2 is required for the suppression of TLR4 signaling activation. These results may contribute to develop therapeutic interventions using L. amylovorus in intestinal disorders of piglets and humans."
https://openalex.org/W1969726234,"Mitochondria are dynamic organelles that undergo constant remodeling through the regulation of two opposing processes, mitochondrial fission and fusion. Although several key regulators and physiological stimuli have been identified to control mitochondrial fission and fusion, the role of mitochondrial morphology in the two processes remains to be determined. To address this knowledge gap, we investigated whether morphological features extracted from time-lapse live-cell images of mitochondria could be used to predict mitochondrial fate. That is, we asked if we could predict whether a mitochondrion is likely to participate in a fission or fusion event based on its current shape and local environment. Using live-cell microscopy, image analysis software, and supervised machine learning, we characterized mitochondrial dynamics with single-organelle resolution to identify features of mitochondria that are predictive of fission and fusion events. A random forest (RF) model was trained to correctly classify mitochondria poised for either fission or fusion based on a series of morphological and positional features for each organelle. Of the features we evaluated, mitochondrial perimeter positively correlated with mitochondria about to undergo a fission event. Similarly mitochondrial solidity (compact shape) positively correlated with mitochondria about to undergo a fusion event. Our results indicate that fission and fusion are positively correlated with mitochondrial morphological features; and therefore, mitochondrial fission and fusion may be influenced by the mechanical properties of mitochondrial membranes."
https://openalex.org/W2042340758,"The retinoic acid-inducible dehydrogenase reductase 3 (DHRS3) is thought to function as a retinaldehyde reductase that controls the levels of all-trans-retinaldehyde, the immediate precursor for bioactive all-trans-retinoic acid. However, the weak catalytic activity of DHRS3 and the lack of changes in retinaldehyde conversion to retinol and retinoic acid in the cells overexpressing DHRS3 undermine its role as a physiologically important all-trans-retinaldehyde reductase. This study demonstrates that DHRS3 requires the presence of retinol dehydrogenase 10 (RDH10) to display its full catalytic activity. The RDH10-activated DHRS3 acts as a robust high affinity all-trans-retinaldehyde-specific reductase that effectively converts retinaldehyde back to retinol, decreasing the rate of retinoic acid biosynthesis. In turn, the retinol dehydrogenase activity of RDH10 is reciprocally activated by DHRS3. At E13.5, DHRS3-null embryos have ∼4-fold lower levels of retinol and retinyl esters, but only slightly elevated levels of retinoic acid. The membrane-associated retinaldehyde reductase and retinol dehydrogenase activities are decreased by ∼4- and ∼2-fold, respectively, in Dhrs3(-/-) embryos, and Dhrs3(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts exhibit reduced metabolism of both retinaldehyde and retinol. Neither RDH10 nor DHRS3 has to be itself catalytically active to activate each other. The transcripts encoding DHRS3 and RDH10 are co-localized at least in some tissues during development. The mutually activating interaction between the two related proteins may represent a highly sensitive and conserved mechanism for precise control over the rate of retinoic acid biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2057392283,"To evaluate the accuracy of ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the diagnosis of placenta accreta and to define the most relevant specific ultrasound and MRI features that may predict placental invasion.This study was approved by the institutional review board of the French College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of all patients referred for suspected placenta accreta to two university hospitals from 01/2001 to 05/2012. Our study population included 42 pregnant women who had been investigated by both ultrasonography and MRI. Ultrasound images and MRI were blindly reassessed for each case by 2 raters in order to score features that predict abnormal placental invasion.Sensitivity in the diagnosis of placenta accreta was 100% with ultrasound and 76.9% for MRI (P = 0.03). Specificity was 37.5% with ultrasonography and 50% for MRI (P = 0.6). The features of greatest sensitivity on ultrasonography were intraplacental lacunae and loss of the normal retroplacental clear space. Increased vascularization in the uterine serosa-bladder wall interface and vascularization perpendicular to the uterine wall had the best positive predictive value (92%). At MRI, uterine bulging had the best positive predictive value (85%) and its combination with the presence of dark intraplacental bands on T2-weighted images improved the predictive value to 90%.Ultrasound imaging is the mainstay of screening for placenta accreta. MRI appears to be complementary to ultrasonography, especially when there are few ultrasound signs."
https://openalex.org/W1963530707,"Haloferax volcanii uses extracellular DNA as a source for carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorous. However, it can also grow to a limited extend in the absence of added phosphorous, indicating that it contains an intracellular phosphate storage molecule. As Hfx. volcanii is polyploid, it was investigated whether DNA might be used as storage polymer, in addition to its role as genetic material. It could be verified that during phosphate starvation cells multiply by distributing as well as by degrading their chromosomes. In contrast, the number of ribosomes stayed constant, revealing that ribosomes are distributed to descendant cells, but not degraded. These results suggest that the phosphate of phosphate-containing biomolecules (other than DNA and RNA) originates from that stored in DNA, not in rRNA. Adding phosphate to chromosome depleted cells rapidly restores polyploidy. Quantification of desiccation survival of cells with different ploidy levels showed that under phosphate starvation Hfx. volcanii diminishes genetic advantages of polyploidy in favor of cell multiplication. The consequences of the usage of genomic DNA as phosphate storage polymer are discussed as well as the hypothesis that DNA might have initially evolved in evolution as a storage polymer, and the various genetic benefits evolved later."
https://openalex.org/W2037400650,"An array of lipidic compounds that constitute the cell wall of mycobacteria is recognized by host receptors. Examples include trehalose dimycolate (TDM), which is a major surface-exposed glycolipid of mycobacteria, that interacts with the macrophage inducible C-type lectin, Mincle, and exerts its highly potent adjuvant functions. Recent evidence has suggested that glycerol monomycolate (GroMM), another mycolate-containing lipid species produced by mycobacteria, can stimulate innate immune cells; however, its specific host receptors have yet to be identified. We here demonstrated that cell transfectants expressing human Mincle (hMincle) reacted to both TDM and GroMM, while those expressing mouse Mincle (mMincle) only reacted to TDM and failed to recognize GroMM. Studies using domain swap chimeras confirmed that the ectodomain of hMincle, but not that of mMincle, interacted with GroMM, and site-directed mutagenesis analyses revealed that short stretches of amino acid residues at positions 174-176 and 195-196 were involved in GroMM recognition. To further substantiate the differential recognition of GroMM by hMincle and mMincle, hMincle transgenic/mMincle knock-out mice (i.e. hMincle(+) mice) were established and compared with non-transgenic mice (i.e. mMincle(+) mice). We showed that macrophages derived from hMincle(+) mice were activated by GroMM and produced inflammatory cytokines, whereas those derived from mMincle(+) mice did not exhibit any reactivity to GroMM. Furthermore, local inflammatory responses were elicited in the GroMM-injected skin of hMincle(+), but not mMincle(+) mice. These results demonstrated that GroMM is a unique ligand for hMincle that is not recognized by mMincle."
https://openalex.org/W2036309305,"Hyperleukocytosis in AML with leukostasis is a serious life-threatening condition leading to a high early mortality which requires immediate cytoreductive therapy. Therapeutic leukapheresis is currently recommended by the American Society of Apheresis in patients with a WBC>100 G/l with signs of leukostasis, but the role of prophylactic leukapheresis before clinical signs of leukostasis occur is unclear.We retrospectively analyzed the role of leukapheresis in 52 patients (median age 60 years) with hyperleukocytotic AML with and without clinical signs of leukostasis. Since leukapheresis was performed more frequently in patients with signs of leukostasis due to the therapeutic policy in our hospital, we developed a risk score for early death within seven days after start of therapy (EDd7) to account for this selection bias and to independently measure the effect of leukapheresis on EDd7.20 patients received leukapheresis in combination to chemotherapy compared to 32 patients who received chemotherapy only. In a multivariate logistic regression model for the estimation of the probability of EDd7 thromboplastin time and creatinine remained as independent significant parameters and were combined to create an EDd7 risk score. The effect of leukapheresis on EDd7 was evaluated in a bivariate logistic regression together with the risk score. Leukapheresis did not significantly change early mortality in all patients with a WBC≥100 G/l.Prophylactic leukapheresis in hyperleukocytotic patients with and without leukostasis did not improve early mortality in our retrospective study. Larger and prospective clinical trials are needed to validate the risk score and to further explore the role of leukapheresis in AML with hyperleukocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W1982627444,"The chaperone heat shock protein 90 (hsp90) associates with signaling proteins in cells including soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC). hsp90 associates with the heme-free (apo) sGC-β1 subunit and helps to drive heme insertion during maturation of sGC to its NO-responsive active form. Here, we found that NO caused apo-sGC-β1 to rapidly and transiently dissociate from hsp90 and associate with sGC-α1 in cells. This NO response (i) required that hsp90 be active and that cellular heme be available and be capable of inserting into apo-sGC-β1; (ii) was associated with an increase in sGC-β1 heme content; (iii) could be mimicked by the heme-independent sGC activator BAY 60-2770; and (iv) was followed by desensitization of sGC toward NO, sGC-α1 disassociation, and reassociation with hsp90. Thus, NO promoted a rapid, transient, and hsp90-dependent heme insertion into the apo-sGC-β1 subpopulation in cells, which enabled it to combine with the sGC-α1 subunit to form the mature enzyme. The driving mechanism likely involves conformational changes near the heme site in sGC-β1 that can be mimicked by the pharmacologic sGC activator. Such dynamic interplay between hsp90, apo-sGC-β1, and sGC-α1 in response to NO is unprecedented and represent new steps by which cells can modulate the heme content and activity of sGC for signaling cascades."
https://openalex.org/W2017366798,"The chicken has long served as an important model organism in many fields, and continues to aid our understanding of animal development. Functional genomics studies aimed at probing the mechanisms that regulate development require high-quality genomes and transcript annotations. The quality of these resources has improved dramatically over the last several years, but many isoforms and genes have yet to be identified. We hope to contribute to the process of improving these resources with the data presented here: a set of long cDNA sequencing reads, and a curated set of new genes and transcript isoforms not currently represented in the most up-to-date genome annotation currently available to the community of researchers who rely on the chicken genome."
https://openalex.org/W1989883027,"Despite the importance of multiple tetraspanin proteins in cancer invasion and metastasis, little is known about the role and significance of tetraspanin CD81 in these processes. In the present study, we examined CD81 effects on melanoma cell invasiveness and metastasis. Transfection of CD81 into melanoma cells lacking endogenous CD81 expression significantly enhanced the migrating, invasive, and metastatic abilities of melanoma cells. Interestingly, membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) expression was found in CD81-expressing melanoma cells but not in CD81-deficient cells. siRNA knockdown of CD81 in melanoma cells with endogenous CD81 demonstrated decreased MT1-MMP levels and cell motility. Notably, CD81-induced cell migration was abrogated by antibody blocking and siRNA knockdown of MT1-MMP, indicating that MT1-MMP is responsible for CD81-stimulated melanoma cell migration. Promoter analysis revealed an essential role of the Sp1 transcription factor in CD81-induced MT1-MMP transcription. We also demonstrate that the Sp1-activating Akt pathway is involved in adhesion-dependent CD81 signaling to induce MT1-MMP expression and cell motility. Importantly, human skin cancer tissue specimens displayed a positive correlation of CD81 with MT1-MMP expression levels and a close association of CD81 with malignant melanomas. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that CD81 stimulates melanoma cell motility by inducing MT1-MMP expression through the Akt-dependent Sp1 activation signaling pathway, leading to increased melanoma invasion and metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2028566903,"Studies are being conducted on the applicability of genomic data to improve the accuracy of the selection process in livestock, and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) provide valuable information to enhance the understanding on the genetics of complex traits. The aim of this study was to identify genomic regions and genes that play roles in birth weight (BW), weaning weight adjusted for 210 days of age (WW), and long-yearling weight adjusted for 420 days of age (LYW) in Canchim cattle. GWAS were performed by means of the Generalized Quasi-Likelihood Score (GQLS) method using genotypes from the BovineHD BeadChip and estimated breeding values for BW, WW, and LYW. Data consisted of 285 animals from the Canchim breed and 114 from the MA genetic group (derived from crossings between Charolais sires and ½ Canchim + ½ Zebu dams). After applying a false discovery rate correction at a 10% significance level, a total of 4, 12, and 10 SNPs were significantly associated with BW, WW, and LYW, respectively. These SNPs were surveyed to their corresponding genes or to surrounding genes within a distance of 250 kb. The genes DPP6 (dipeptidyl-peptidase 6) and CLEC3B (C-type lectin domain family 3 member B) were highlighted, considering its functions on the development of the brain and skeletal system, respectively. The GQLS method identified regions on chromosome associated with birth weight, weaning weight, and long-yearling weight in Canchim and MA animals. New candidate regions for body weight traits were detected and some of them have interesting biological functions, of which most have not been previously reported. The observation of QTL reports for body weight traits, covering areas surrounding the genes (SNPs) herein identified provides more evidence for these associations. Future studies targeting these areas could provide further knowledge to uncover the genetic architecture underlying growth traits in Canchim cattle."
https://openalex.org/W2167639697,"Gut bacterial communities are now known to influence a range of fitness related aspects of organisms. But how different the microbial community is in closely related species, and if these differences can be interpreted as adaptive is still unclear. In this study we compared microbial communities in two sets of closely related sympatric crater lake cichlid fish species pairs that show similar adaptations along the limnetic-benthic axis. The gut microbial community composition differs in the species pair inhabiting the older of two crater lakes. One major difference, relative to other fish, is that in these cichlids that live in hypersaline crater lakes, the microbial community is largely made up of Oceanospirillales (52.28%) which are halotolerant or halophilic bacteria. This analysis opens up further avenues to identify candidate symbiotic or co-evolved bacteria playing a role in adaptation to similar diets and life-styles or even have a role in speciation. Future functional and phylosymbiotic analyses might help to address these issues."
https://openalex.org/W2060659432,"While grief, emotional distress and other mental health conditions have been associated with pregnancy loss, less is known about the mental health impact of these events during subsequent pregnancies and births. This paper examined the impact of any type of pregnancy loss on mental health in a subsequent pregnancy and postpartum. Data were obtained from a sub-sample (N = 584) of the 1973-78 cohort of the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health, a prospective cohort study that has been collecting data since 1996. Pregnancy loss was defined as miscarriage, termination due to medical reasons, ectopic pregnancy and stillbirth. Mental health outcomes included depression, anxiety, stress or distress, sadness or low mood, excessive worry, lack of enjoyment, and feelings of guilt. Demographic factors and mental health history were controlled for in the analysis. Women with a previous pregnancy loss were more likely to experience sadness or low mood (AOR = 1.75, 95% CI: 1.11 to 2.76, p = 0.0162), and excessive worry (AOR = 2.01, 95% CI: 1.24 to 3.24, p = 0.0043) during a subsequent pregnancy, but not during the postpartum phase following a subsequent birth. These results indicate that while women who have experienced a pregnancy loss are a more vulnerable population during a subsequent pregnancy, these deficits are not evident in the postpartum."
https://openalex.org/W2061974399,"Mammalian mitochondria are able to produce formate from one-carbon donors such as serine, glycine, and sarcosine. This pathway relies on the mitochondrial pool of tetrahydrofolate (THF) and several folate-interconverting enzymes in the mitochondrial matrix. We recently identified MTHFD2L as the enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (CH2-THF) in adult mammalian mitochondria. We show here that the MTHFD2L enzyme is bifunctional, possessing both CH2-THF dehydrogenase and 5,10-methenyl-THF cyclohydrolase activities. The dehydrogenase activity can use either NAD+ or NADP+ but requires both phosphate and Mg2+ when using NAD+. The NADP+-dependent dehydrogenase activity is inhibited by inorganic phosphate. MTHFD2L uses the mono- and polyglutamylated forms of CH2-THF with similar catalytic efficiencies. Expression of the MTHFD2L transcript is low in early mouse embryos but begins to increase at embryonic day 10.5 and remains elevated through birth. In adults, MTHFD2L is expressed in all tissues examined, with the highest levels observed in brain and lung.

https://openalex.org/W2094096389,"Despite the importance of dimethylsulphoniopropionate (DMSP) in the global sulphur cycle and climate regulation, the biological pathways underpinning its synthesis in marine phytoplankton remain poorly understood. The intracellular concentration of DMSP increases with increased salinity, increased light intensity and nitrogen starvation in the diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana. We used these conditions to investigate DMSP synthesis at the cellular level via analysis of enzyme activity, gene expression and proteome comparison. The activity of the key sulphur assimilatory enzyme, adenosine 5'-phosphosulphate reductase was not coordinated with increasing intracellular DMSP concentration. Under all three treatments coordination in the expression of sulphur assimilation genes was limited to increases in sulphite reductase transcripts. Similarly, proteomic 2D gel analysis only revealed an increase in phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase following increases in DMSP concentration. Our findings suggest that increased sulphur assimilation might not be required for increased DMSP synthesis, instead the availability of carbon and nitrogen substrates may be important in the regulation of this pathway. This contrasts with the regulation of sulphur metabolism in higher plants, which generally involves up-regulation of several sulphur assimilatory enzymes. In T. pseudonana changes relating to sulphur metabolism were specific to the individual treatments and, given that little coordination was seen in transcript and protein responses across the three growth conditions, different patterns of regulation might be responsible for the increase in DMSP concentration seen under each treatment."

One of these genes is POMGnT1, which catalyzes the second step in the O-mannosylation of α-dystroglycan by mediating the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) 2The abbreviations used are: GlcNAcN-acetylglucosamineqRTquantitative reverse transcriptionERendoplasmic reticulumPDIprotein disulfide isomerase. from UDP-GlcNAc onto the mannose in the 2-OH position. POMGnT1 encodes a 660-amino acid type II transmembrane protein located in the Golgi and is predicted to have four domains, an N-terminal cytoplasmic tail, a transmembrane domain, a stem domain, and a catalytic domain facing the Golgi lumen (20Yoshida A.

Using such a platform, we have identified a novel interaction between POMGnT1 and GOLPH3. We showed that GOLPH3 is responsible for mediating the Golgi localization of POMGnT1 and consequently regulates the glycosylation of α-dystroglycan. HeLa cells and HEK 293 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and cultured at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS (Invitrogen). The coding region of human GOLPH3 (NCBI sequence NP_071413.1) was amplified from HeLa cDNA by PCR and cloned into pcDNA3.1+ vector. The coding region of GOLPH3 was also cloned into pGEX4T-1 (Pharmacia Biotech) for expression in bacterial cells. The coding region of human POMGnT1 (NCBI sequence NP_060209.3) was amplified from HeLa cDNA using PCR. An HA tag was fused to the C terminus of POMGnT1 and cloned into pcDNA3.1+ vectors. Site-directed mutagenesis of POMGnT1-HA constructs was generated using the QuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's instructions. All constructs were fully sequenced before being used for transfection. For bacterial expression of recombinant proteins, the pGEX4T-1 vectors were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells (Invitrogen). The cells were then cultured at 37 °C until the A600 value reached 0.6. Subsequently, isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Invitrogen) was added into the culture medium to a final concentration of 0.5 mm to induce protein expression for 2 h at 27 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed by sonication in PBS. GST and GST-GOLPH3 proteins were then purified by affinity chromatography with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) under native conditions. An aliquot of a T7 phage display library of human liver cDNA (Novagen) was pre-cleared with 100 μg of GST protein immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads by incubating them together for 2 h at room temperature followed by centrifugation. The supernatant was then incubated overnight at 4 °C with 100 μg of GST-fused GOLPH3 (full-length) immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads. All binding experiments were performed in the presence of 1% bovine serum albumin. Unbound phages were washed four times with TBST (0.1% Tween 20 in 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4) and 150 mm NaCl). The bound phages were amplified in E. coli BL5615 (Novagen), which was preinduced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 20 min at 37 °C. After cell lysis, the phage lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 8000 × g for 10 min and stored at 4 °C for use in the next selection round. A total of five rounds of selection were performed. PCR analysis was performed on amplified phages using a pair of T7 primers to ascertain the enrichment. The phage pool from the fourth round of amplification was panned to harvest single clones. Individual phage clones were picked and subjected to sequencing analysis using a T7 primer. HeLa cells were transiently co-transfected with indicated expression plasmids, and the cell lysates were prepared 2 days post-transfection. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (1% IGEPAL CA-630, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors from Roche Applied Science) for 10 min at 4 °C, and insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g and 4 °C for 10 min. Co-immunoprecipitation was performed using the anti-HA immunoprecipitation kit (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For reverse co-immunoprecipitation, 5 μg of anti-GOLPH3 antibody was added to cleared lysate for 2 h at 4 °C. Next, 50 μl of protein A/G agarose was added and incubated overnight at 4 °C. After four washes, the immunoprecipitated complexes were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-HA (Sigma) and anti-GOLPH3 (Abcam) antibodies. HeLa cells were plated on glass coverslips and grown overnight before transfection with indicated plasmids. 2 days after transfection, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich), permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich), and blocked in 10% normal goat serum (Invitrogen) for 30 min. Cells were then incubated with a 1:500 dilution of mouse anti-HA monoclonal antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) and a 1:300 dilution of rabbit anti-giantin (Abcam) or a 1:160 dilution of rabbit anti-GOLPH3 (Abcam) in PBS with 1% BSA for 1 h. Cells were washed three times with PBS and subsequently incubated with goat anti-mouse conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 and goat anti-rabbit conjugated with Alexa Fluor 594 (Invitrogen) in PBS with 1% BSA for 1 h. Cells were washed three times with PBS before mounting on glass slides with a Prolong Gold Antifade mounting medium (Invitrogen). Fluorescence images were obtained using a Carl Zeiss META confocal microscope. To analyze knockdown phenotypes, GOLPH3 siRNA was obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies, whereas POMGnT1 and All Stars negative control siRNA (catalog no. 1027281) were obtained from Qiagen. siRNAs were diluted to 20 μm using RNase-free distilled water and stored at −20 °C until further use. Cells were cultured in six-well plates and transfected with siRNAs at a final concentration of 10 nm using RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The siRNA oligonucleotide sequences were as follows. For GOLPH3, the sense oligonucleotide is 5′-CCCUGAUGGAGGAAGUGCUCCUGCU-3′, and the antisense oligonucleotide is 5′-AGCAGGAGCACUUCCUCCAUCAGGGUC-3′. For POMGnT1, the sense oligonucleotide is 5′-GACGUAGAGGUGUAUUCAAUU-3′, and the antisense oligonucleotide is 5′-UUGAAUACACCUCUACGUCCA-3′. For cell surface staining of α-dystroglycan with mAb IIH6 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), HEK 293 cells were detached with enzyme-free dissociation solution (Sigma-Aldrich) and incubated with mAb IIH6 (1:100) in 1% BSA/PBS for 1 h on ice. Cells were then washed twice in PBS and labeled with goat anti-mouse conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 (1:500) (Invitrogen) in 1% BSA/PBS for 45 min on ice in the dark. Cells were washed twice in PBS and analyzed with a FACSCalibur flow cytometry (BD Biosciences) using Cell Quest Software. Image analysis was done using FloJo Software (Tree Star, Inc.). Total RNA was extracted from the siRNA-transfected HEK 293 cell lines using RNeasy kit (Qiagen). First strand cDNA was synthesized from 2 μg of total RNA using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (MMLV-RT) (Promega) and oligo(dT(15)) (Promega). The following primers for GOLPH3 and POMGnT1 were designed: GOLPH3 primer, 5′-CAGCCACGTAATCCAGATGAT-3′ (forward) and 5′-ACCCTGATGGAGGAAGTGCT-3′ (reverse); POMGnT1 primer, 5′-CCTGGAACCGTGTTGAACTT-3′ (forward) and 5′-CGATCCTACCACTTTGGCAT-3′ (reverse). PCR analysis was performed using the ABI Prism7000qRT PCR Detection System (Applied Biosystems). For each reaction of 25 μl, 12.5 μl of 2× SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) was mixed with 5 μl cDNA from 2 μg of total RNA) and 12.5 pmol each of forward and reverse primers and topped up with water in a MicroAmp optical 96-well reaction plate and sealed with optical adhesive covers (Applied Biosystems). PCR analysis was performed using the ABI Prism7000 qRT PCR Detection System (Applied Biosystems). The PCR reaction conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 60 s. Threshold cycle (Ct) was determined using ABI Prism 7000 SDS program (Applied Biosystems). All reactions were run in triplicate. Relative transcript abundance was calculated by transforming the average Ct values to 2−Ct and normalizing to a housekeeping gene, GAPDH. Full-length human GOLPH3 was fused to the C terminus of GST and used as the bait in a phage display screen against a human liver cDNA library. Five rounds of biopanning were performed and the enrichment after each round was ascertained by PCR. Specific DNA bands emerged in the fourth and fifth round of selection, suggesting that specific GOLPH3 binding phage was present in these phage pools (data not shown). Subsequently, the phage pool from the fourth round of biopanning was panned to harvest single clones. Sequencing analysis revealed that a dominant peptide, HLKESVLRAGWSHTW, was obtained as 50% of the clones contained this same peptide motif. A BLAST search revealed that this sequence is highly similar to a stretch of 27 amino acids located in the stem region of POMGnT1. Another potential binder of GOLPH3, identified in the phage display was N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 12, a glycosyltransferase implicated in the initiation of mammalian O-linked glycosylation. Alignment of the two glycoysltransferases identified in the phage display revealed the presence of a conserved motif (RXLRR) present in the cytoplasmic tail of the transferases. Further validation of the interaction between GOLPH3 and N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 12 will be important for defining the potential function of GOLPH3 in O-linked glycosylation. We chose to focus our efforts on POMGnT1 as this peptide represented the dominant binder in our screen. Co-immunoprecipitation analyses were performed to confirm the physiological interaction of the GOLPH3 and POMGnT1 interaction in mammalian cells. Cells were co-transfected with GOLPH3 and HA-tagged POMGnT1 or GOLPH3 alone followed by IP analyses with anti-HA antibody. The immunoprecipitates were tested for the presence of GOLPH3 by immunoblotting with anti-GOLPH3 antibody. GOLPH3 was found in the immunoprecipitated complexes of POMGnT1-HA expressing cells but not in cells that did not express POMGnT1-HA (Fig. 1A). A reciprocal IP was also preformed to further verify this interaction. Cells were co-transfected with GOLPH3 and POMGnT1-HA, following which IP was carried out using an anti-GOLPH3 antibody. The immunoprecipitates were tested for the presence of POMGnT1 by immunoblotting with anti-HA antibody. POMGnT1-HA was detected in the immunoprecipitated complexes as shown in Fig. 1B. These data offer strong support for the physical association of GOLPH3 and POMGnT1 in cells. Based on the results of the co-immunoprecipitation, we predicted that POMGnT1 would co-localize with GOLPH3. To determine this, we performed confocal fluorescence microscopy. As previously determined, we found that a HA-tagged POMGnT1 co-localized with the Golgi marker giantin (data not shown). Importantly, the co-transfection of POMGnT1 and GOLPH3 showed that both proteins co-localized at the Golgi (Fig. 1C). The amino acid residues within the stem domain of POMGnT1 identified in the T7 phage display may play an important role in interacting with GOLPH3. To determine the functional significance of these residues, we deleted amino acids 184 to 210 of POMGnT1 (Fig. 2A) and assessed its GOLPH3-binding capabilities. However, we found that the deletion of this region did not affect its binding to GOLPH3 (Fig. 2B). Due to prior knowledge that GOLPH3 and its homolog Vps74p binds to the cytoplasmic tails of C2GnT1 (10Ali M.F. Chachadi V.B. Petrosyan A. Cheng P.W.

Cell. 2008; 14: 523-534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), we investigated the role of the cytoplasmic tail of POMGnT1 in mediating its interaction with GOLPH3. A truncated form of POMGnT1 was generated by deleting the cytoplasmic tail of POMGnT1 (Fig. 2A). HeLa cells were co-transfected with constructs expressing a HA-tagged POMGnT1 with its C-terminal tail removed and GOLPH3. This was followed by co-immunoprecipitation using anti-HA antibodies. The immunoprecipitated complexes were then immunoblotted with anti-GOLPH3 antibodies to detect for the presence of GOLPH3. As shown in left panel of Fig. 2C, the deletion of the cytoplasmic tail of POMGnT1 led to the reduction in the binding capacity of GOLPH3 when compared with that of the full-length POMGnT1 protein. Quantification of the GOLPH3 bands from two separate co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that there was an approximate 3-fold decrease in GOLPH3 binding to the truncated POMGnT1 protein (Fig. 2C, right panel). Due to the reduction in interaction between GOLPH3 and POMGnT1, we speculated that the localization of POMGnT1 would be affected. As shown by confocal fluorescence microscopy, we observed that the removal of the cytoplasmic tail of POMGnT1 led to the inability of the protein to precisely co-localize with the Golgi marker (Fig. 2D, middle panel). Further analysis demonstrated that the truncated protein mislocalized to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as shown by the co-localization with the ER marker, protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) (Fig. 2D, lower panel). We have thus mapped the GOLPH3 interaction region to the cytoplasmic tail of on POMGnT1 and further demonstrated that this interaction is important in maintaining the Golgi localization of POMGnT1. In an effort to further evaluate the finding that GOLPH3 is critical in maintaining the Golgi localization of POMGnT1, we employed RNAi-based interference to reduce the expression level of endogenous GOLPH3 and assessed the subcellular localization of POMGnT1-HA. Due to the existence of a GOLPH3 variant (GOLPH3V), and with the knowledge that GOLPH3V exists in human cell lines such as HeLa (27Nagano-Ito M. Yoshikawa S. Tamura M. Tsurumaki M. Ichikawa S. Identification and characterization of a novel alternative splice variant of mouse GMx33α/GPP34.Gene. 2007; 400: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), we utilized an siRNA to target both the variant and full-length form of the GOLPH3 protein. The knockdown of GOLPH3 resulted in the inability of POMGnT1 to precisely co-localize with the Golgi marker (Fig. 2E, left panel). On further analysis, we show POMGnT1 localized to the ER in GOLPH3-depleted cells as observed by the co-localization with anti-PDI (Fig. 2E, right panel). Taken together, the in vivo data further demonstrate that GOLPH3 proteins determine the Golgi localization of POMGnT1. To investigate the biological significance of the novel interaction between GOLPH3 and POMGnT1 identified in this study, we used RNAi-based gene silencing to reduce endogenous levels of GOLPH3 and assessed the functional glycosylation of cell-surface α-dystroglycan. The glycosylation of α-dystroglycan was examined based on the immunoreactivity of the glycoprotein to the IIH6 monoclonal antibody, which is known to recognize the laminin-binding glyco-epitope (28Ervasti J.M. Campbell K.P. A role for the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex as a transmembrane linker between laminin and actin.J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 809-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (1174) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were not used in this assay as glycosylation of α-dystroglycan is regulated in a cell type-specific manner, and studies have shown that epithelium-derived cancer cell lines, including HeLa, are unable to functionally glycosylate α-dystroglycan (29de Bernabé D.B.

https://openalex.org/W2014179032,"Objectives The mechanisms by which low oxygen availability are associated with the development of insulin resistance remain obscure. We thus investigated the relationship between such gluco-insular derangements in response to sustained (hypobaric) hypoxemia, and changes in biomarkers of oxidative stress, inflammation and counter-regulatory hormone responses. Methods After baseline testing in London (75 m), 24 subjects ascended from Kathmandu (1,300 m) to Everest Base Camp (EBC;5,300 m) over 13 days. Of these, 14 ascended higher, with 8 reaching the summit (8,848 m). Assessments were conducted at baseline, during ascent to EBC, and 1, 6 and 8 week(s) thereafter. Changes in body weight and indices of gluco-insular control were measured (glucose, insulin, C-Peptide, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance [HOMA-IR]) along with biomarkers of oxidative stress (4-hydroxy-2-nonenal-HNE), inflammation (Interleukin-6 [IL-6]) and counter-regulatory hormones (glucagon, adrenalin, noradrenalin). In addition, peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) and venous blood lactate concentrations were determined. Results SpO2 fell significantly from 98.0% at sea level to 82.0% on arrival at 5,300 m. Whilst glucose levels remained stable, insulin and C-Peptide concentrations increased by >200% during the last 2 weeks. Increases in fasting insulin, HOMA-IR and glucagon correlated with increases in markers of oxidative stress (4-HNE) and inflammation (IL-6). Lactate levels progressively increased during ascent and remained significantly elevated until week 8. Subjects lost on average 7.3 kg in body weight. Conclusions Sustained hypoxemia is associated with insulin resistance, whose magnitude correlates with the degree of oxidative stress and inflammation. The role of 4-HNE and IL-6 as key players in modifying the association between sustained hypoxia and insulin resistance merits further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W1980392719,"β-arrestins, ubiquitous cellular scaffolding proteins that act as signaling mediators of numerous critical cellular pathways, are attractive therapeutic targets because they promote tumorigenesis in several tumor models. However, targeting scaffolding proteins with traditional small molecule drugs has been challenging. Inhibition of β-arrestin 2 with a novel aptamer impedes multiple oncogenic signaling pathways simultaneously. Additionally, delivery of the β-arrestin 2-targeting aptamer into leukemia cells through coupling to a recently described cancer cell-specific delivery aptamer, inhibits multiple β-arrestin-mediated signaling pathways known to be required for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) disease progression, and impairs tumorigenic growth in CML patient samples. The ability to target scaffolding proteins such as β-arrestin 2 with RNA aptamers may prove beneficial as a therapeutic strategy. Highlights An RNA aptamer inhibits β-arrestin 2 activity. Inhibiting β-arrestin 2 impedes multiple tumorigenic pathways simultaneously. The therapeutic aptamer is delivered to cancer cells using a cell-specific DNA aptamer.

https://openalex.org/W2069764756,"A crop adapted for an herbivorous diet of seeds has previously been documented in the Early Cretaceous birds Sapeornis and Hongshanornis. Here we report on several specimens of Yanornis that preserve a crop containing fish. One specimen preserves two whole fish in the oesophagus, indicating that Early Cretaceous birds shared trophic specializations with Neornithes for the increased energetic demands of flight--namely the storing of food for later consumption when the stomach is full. Whole fish also indicate that despite their presence, teeth were not used to orally process food, suggesting the hypertrophied dentition in this taxon were utilized in prey capture. The presence of macerated fish bones in the crop of other specimens indicates the highly efficient advanced muscular system of peristalsis responsible for moving ingested items between different segments of the alimentary canal was also in place. Despite the fact many features of the modern avian alimentary canal are inferred to compensate for the absence of teeth in birds (expandable oesophagus, grinding gizzard), the derived alimentary canal was apparently present in toothed Cretaceous birds. Although Yanornis was considered to have switched their diet from piscivorous to herbivorous, based on position and morphology we reinterpret the gastroliths reported in one specimen as sand impacted in the intestines, and reconstruct the taxon as primarily piscivorous. This is a novel interpretation for fossilized gastroliths, and the first documentation of this condition in the fossil record."
https://openalex.org/W1999098545,"Fish depend on dietary fatty acids (FA) to support their physiological condition and health. Exploring the FA distribution in common carp (Cyprinus carpio), one of the world's most consumed freshwater fish, is important to understand how and where FA of different sources are allocated. We investigated diet effects on the composition of polar and neutral lipid fatty acids (PLFA and NLFA, respectively) in eight different tissues (dorsal and ventral muscle, heart, kidney, intestine, eyes, liver and adipose tissue) of common carp. Two-year old carp were exposed to three diet sources (i.e., zooplankton, zooplankton plus supplementary feeds containing vegetable, VO, or fish oil, FO) with different FA composition. The PLFA and NLFA response was clearly tissue-specific after 210 days of feeding on different diets. PLFA were generally rich in omega-3 polyunsaturated FA and only marginally influenced by dietary FA, whereas the NLFA composition strongly reflected dietary FA profiles. However, the NLFA composition in carp tissues varied considerably at low NLFA mass ratios, suggesting that carp is able to regulate the NLFA composition and thus FA quality in its tissues when NLFA contents are low. Finally, this study shows that FO were 3X more retained than VO as NLFA particularly in muscle tissues, indicating that higher nutritional quality feeds are selectively allocated into tissues and thus available for human consumption."
https://openalex.org/W2047832974,"The EphA2 receptor tyrosine kinase plays a central role in the regulation of cell adhesion and guidance in many human tissues. The activation of EphA2 occurs after proper dimerization/oligomerization in the plasma membrane, which occurs with the participation of extracellular and cytoplasmic domains. Our study revealed that the isolated transmembrane domain (TMD) of EphA2 embedded into the lipid bicelle dimerized via the heptad repeat motif L(535)X3G(539)X2A(542)X3V(546)X2L(549) rather than through the alternative glycine zipper motif A(536)X3G(540)X3G(544) (typical for TMD dimerization in many proteins). To evaluate the significance of TMD interactions for full-length EphA2, we substituted key residues in the heptad repeat motif (HR variant: G539I, A542I, G553I) or in the glycine zipper motif (GZ variant: G540I, G544I) and expressed YFP-tagged EphA2 (WT, HR, and GZ variants) in HEK293T cells. Confocal microscopy revealed a similar distribution of all EphA2-YFP variants in cells. The expression of EphA2-YFP variants and their kinase activity (phosphorylation of Tyr(588) and/or Tyr(594)) and ephrin-A3 binding were analyzed with flow cytometry on a single cell basis. Activation of any EphA2 variant is found to occur even without ephrin stimulation when the EphA2 content in cells is sufficiently high. Ephrin-A3 binding is not affected in mutant variants. Mutations in the TMD have a significant effect on EphA2 activity. Both ligand-dependent and ligand-independent activities are enhanced for the HR variant and reduced for the GZ variant compared with the WT. These findings allow us to suggest TMD dimerization switching between the heptad repeat and glycine zipper motifs, corresponding to inactive and active receptor states, respectively, as a mechanism underlying EphA2 signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W2050995302,"The OmpR/PhoB subfamily protein GlnR of actinomycetes is an orphan response regulator that globally coordinates the expression of genes related to nitrogen metabolism. Biochemical and genetic analyses reveal that the functional GlnR from Amycolatopsis mediterranei is unphosphorylated at the potential phosphorylation Asp50 residue in the N-terminal receiver domain. The crystal structure of this receiver domain demonstrates that it forms a homodimer through the α4-β5-α5 dimer interface highly similar to the phosphorylated typical response regulator, whereas the so-called “phosphorylation pocket” is not conserved, with its space being occupied by an Arg52 from the β3-α3 loop. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments confirm that GlnR forms a functional homodimer via its receiver domain and suggest that the charge interactions of Asp50 with the highly conserved Arg52 and Thr9 in the receiver domain may be crucial in maintaining the proper conformation for homodimerization, as also supported by molecular dynamics simulations of the wild type GlnR versus the deficient mutant GlnR(D50A). This model is backed by the distinct phenotypes of the total deficient GlnR(R52A/T9A) double mutant versus the single mutants of GlnR (i.e. D50N, D50E, R52A and T9A), which have only minor effects upon both dimerization and physiological function of GlnR in vivo, albeit their DNA binding ability is weakened compared with that of the wild type. By integrating the supportive data of GlnRs from the model Streptomyces coelicolor and the pathogenic Mycobacterium tuberculosis, we conclude that the actinomycete GlnR is atypical with respect to its unphosphorylated conserved Asp residue being involved in the critical Arg/Asp/Thr charge interactions, which is essential for maintaining the biologically active homodimer conformation. The OmpR/PhoB subfamily protein GlnR of actinomycetes is an orphan response regulator that globally coordinates the expression of genes related to nitrogen metabolism. Biochemical and genetic analyses reveal that the functional GlnR from Amycolatopsis mediterranei is unphosphorylated at the potential phosphorylation Asp50 residue in the N-terminal receiver domain.

Many fungal ABC transporters such as Pdr5 display an inherent asymmetry in their nucleotide-binding sites (NBS) unlike most of their human counterparts. This degeneracy of the NBSs is very intriguing and needs explanation in terms of structural and functional relevance. In this study, we mutated nonconsensus amino acid residues in the NBSs to its consensus counterpart and studied its effect on the function of the protein and effect on yeast cells. The completely “regenerated” Pdr5 protein was severely impaired in its function of ATP hydrolysis and of rhodamine 6G transport. Moreover, we observe alternative compensatory mechanisms to counteract drug toxicity in some of the mutants. In essence, we describe here the first attempts to restore complete symmetry in an asymmetric ABC transporter and to study its effects, which might be relevant to the entire class of asymmetric ABC transporters.

ABC proteins in yeast and fungal pathogens.Essays Biochem. 2011; 50: 101-119Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Multidrug resistance (MDR) during chemotherapy in the treatment of cancer or in immunocompromised individuals has made the biochemical and structural study of these proteins essential. In fungi, many ABC transporters have been at the center of scientific investigation, for example, their involvement in the phenomenon of pleiotropic drug resistance (4Prasad R. Goffeau A. Yeast ATP-binding cassette transporters conferring multidrug resistance.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2012; 66: 39-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), a phenomena similar to MDR. ATP-binding cassette nucleotide-binding site nucleotide-binding domain oligomycin multidrug resistance transmembrane domain rhodamine 6G p-glycoprotein. Pdr5 is an ABC transporter localized in the plasma membrane of bakers' yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. It is a functional homologue of P-gp (MDR1 or ABCB1), which is the most widely studied ABC transporter from humans (5Sharom F.J. The P-glycoprotein multidrug transporter.Essays Biochem. 2011; 50: 161-178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pdr5 is involved in the extrusion of a wide variety of xenotoxic compounds from the cell (6Golin J. Ambudkar S.V. May L.

Chem. 1996; 271: 31543-31548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). It is a full-size transporter having two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) and two transmembrane domains (TMDs) displaying an NBD-TMD-NBD-TMD membrane topology. This is inverse to that of the classic topology of ABC transporters (TMD-NBD-TMD-NBD). Since the discovery that a mutation in the transcription factor, which controls the expression of this membrane protein, leads to overexpression of Pdr5 (9Goffeau A. Dufour J.P. Plasma membrane ATPase from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 528-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), it has turned out to be an important model for studying MDR or to be more precise pleiotropic drug resistance as it is called in yeast. Pdr5 displays a high basal ATPase activity, which, unlike its other human counterparts such as P-gp, does not seem to be stimulated in the presence of substrates (7Ernst R. Klemm R. Schmitt L. Kuchler K. Yeast ATP-binding cassette transporters: cellular cleaning pumps.Methods Enzymol. 2005; 400: 460-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 10Ernst R. Kueppers P. Klein C.M. Schwarzmueller T. Kuchler K. Schmitt L. A mutation of the H-loop selectively affects rhodamine transport by the yeast multidrug ABC transporter Pdr5.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 5069-5074Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Such an uncoupling has important mechanistic consequences because ATP hydrolysis is supposed to be the crucial step that triggers the transport of substrates across the membrane, and in the proper environment, it is strictly coupled to substrate translocation (11Shapiro A.B. Ling V. The mechanism of ATP-dependent multidrug transport by P-glycoprotein.Acta Physiol. Scand. Suppl. 1998; 643: 227-234PubMed Google Scholar). The NBDs play the role of harnessing chemical energy from ATP and converting it to mechanical energy by inducing structural changes in the TMDs to extrude the substrate to the exterior of the cell (12Zaitseva J. Jenewein S. Oswald C. Jumpertz T. Holland I.B. Schmitt L. A molecular understanding of the catalytic cycle of the nucleotide-binding domain of the ABC transporter HlyB.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2005; 33: 990-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 13Hanekop N. Zaitseva J. Jenewein S. Holland I.B. Schmitt L. Molecular insights into the mechanism of ATP-hydrolysis by the NBD of the ABC-transporter HlyB.FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 1036-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The amino acid residues involved in binding and hydrolysis of ATP are essential for the proper functionality of the protein. A number of previous studies have investigated the roles of individual and groups of amino acids in the NBDs and shed light on their roles during ATP binding and hydrolysis. As per the generally accepted model, an ABC transporter binds two nucleotides in the two NBDs. This binding occurs in a head-to-tail fashion, i.e. consensus residues from Walker A (GXGXXGKST, where X can be any amino acid) and Walker B (φφφφDE, where φ can be any hydrophobic amino acid) motifs as well as the H-loop (XHX) from one NBD and the C-loop (LSGGQ) from the other NBD sandwich one ATP molecule between them, thereby forming the nucleotide-binding site (NBS) (12Zaitseva J. Jenewein S. Oswald C. Jumpertz T. Holland I.B. Schmitt L. A molecular understanding of the catalytic cycle of the nucleotide-binding domain of the ABC transporter HlyB.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2005; 33: 990-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Once both nucleotides are bound at the two NBSs, the transporter is supposed to switch from the so-called inward-facing to the so-called outward-facing conformation, and as a consequence of this conformational change, the substrate is extruded (14Linton K.J. Structure and function of ABC transporters.Physiology. 2007; 22: 122-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Moreover, ATP hydrolysis has been suggested to be the step that sets the transporter back to the inward-facing conformation ready to accept new substrate molecules for the next cycle of substrate translocation (14Linton K.J. Structure and function of ABC transporters.Physiology. 2007; 22: 122-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). However, there is debate about the number of ATP molecules that are hydrolyzed for one cycle of transport to be completed. But the prerequisite for both bound ATP molecules to be hydrolyzed is the presence of key consensus residues in both NBSs. As seen in Fig. 1, Pdr5 lacks key residues in one of the two NBSs. Although this degenerate site could bind ATP, hydrolysis should be impossible or severely impaired due to the absence of these key residues. Some initial mutational studies supported this view (10Ernst R. Kueppers P. Klein C.M. Schwarzmueller T. Kuchler K. Schmitt L. A mutation of the H-loop selectively affects rhodamine transport by the yeast multidrug ABC transporter Pdr5.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 5069-5074Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). This observation of a degenerate and a consensus site is common in yeast ABC transporters but is uncommon in ABC transporters of archaea and bacteria. In the case of human counterparts, only TAP1/2 (ABC B2/B3) and many transporters of the subfamily C display this sort of degeneration (15Lamping E. Baret P.V. Holmes A.R. Monk B.C. Goffeau A. Cannon R.D. Fungal PDR transporters: Phylogeny, topology, motifs and function.Fungal Genet. Biol. 2010; 47: 127-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). A well studied example of a eukaryotic protein possessing a degenerate NBS is the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator. Here, site 1 (degenerate) is proposed to be bound to ATP through many cycles of ATP hydrolysis occurring at site 2 (canonical) and thus play a supporting role (16Csanády L. Mihályi C. Szollosi A. Töröcsik B. Vergani P. Conformational changes in the catalytically inactive nucleotide-binding site of CFTR.J. Gen. Physiol. 2013; 142: 61-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This leads us to question the functional relevance for the protein and on a broader scale to the cell for maintaining a degenerate NBS, because such evolutionary conservation of this trait in yeast ABC transporters does need an explanation. In this study, we systematically interchanged each degenerated amino acid residue in the NBSs and studied its effect on the functionality of the protein and in turn on the cellular consequences. Ketoconazole, fluconazole, and rhodamine 6g (R6G) were obtained from Sigma, and cycloheximide was obtained from Fluka. All drug stock solutions were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, Acros Organics), and further dilutions were carried out in sterile water. Assay was carried out in sterile 96-well microtiter plates (Falcon) with 20 μl of drug, 180 μl of YPD medium, and 50 μl of A620 0.2 yeast culture. Plates were incubated at 30 °C for 48 h, and A620 was measured with an ELISA plate reader (FLUOstar-Optima). No further correction was applied as none of the used drugs displayed an absorption to 620 nm. Yeast strains were cultured in YPD medium containing 10 g/liter yeast extract, 20 g/liter peptone, and 2% glucose. The following S. cerevisiae strains were used in this study: YALF-A1 (MATa: ura3-52 trp 1-1 leu 2-3, his 3-11, 15 ade 2-1 PDR 1-3), YHW-A5 (MATa: ura3-52 trp 1-1 leu 2-3, his 3-11, 15 ade 2-1 PDR 1-3 pdr5Δ::TRP1), and YRE1001 (MATa: ura3-52 trp 1-1 leu 2-3, his 3-11, 15 ade 2-1 PDR 1-3 pdr5pdr5promΔ::TRP1).

At A620 of 1.5, the nitrogen source was replenished by addition of a 10th volume of 5× YP (50 g/liter yeast extract; 100 g/liter tryptone/peptone). Cells were harvested at A600 of 3.5. The isolation of plasma membranes was performed as described elsewhere (8Kolaczkowski M. van der Rest M. Cybularz-Kolaczkowska A. Soumillion J.P. Konings W.N. Goffeau A.

Kolaczkowski M. Balzi E. Goffeau A. Solubilization and characterization of the overexpressed PDR5 multidrug resistance nucleotide triphosphatase of yeast.J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12797-12803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using a FluoroLog III fluorescence spectrometer (Horiba). Isolated plasma membranes (30 μg of total protein content) were resuspended in 1 ml of transport buffer (50 mm Hepes (pH 7.0), 10 mm MgCl2, 150 nm R6G, and 10 mm azide) and incubated at 35 °C. Transport was initiated by addition of 10 mm ATP. In the presence of ATP, Pdr5 transports R6G from the outside to the inside of the membrane vesicle due to its inside-out orientation (NBDs face outside). R6G accumulation into the vesicle leads to self-quenching and results in the overall decrease in fluorescence intensity. The final relative decrease in fluorescence intensity is representative of the relative Vmax for transport of the dye. Oligomycin (OM)-sensitive ATPase activity of plasma membrane fractions was measured by a colorimetric assay performed in 96-well microtiter plates (9Goffeau A. Dufour J.P.

Isolated plasma membranes (0.1 or 0.2 μg per well) were incubated with 4 mm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2 in 300 mm Tris-glycine buffer (pH 9.0) in a final volume of 25 μl. To reduce background, 0.2 mm ammonium molybdate, 50 mm KNO3, and 10 mm NaN3, respectively, were added (9Goffeau A. Dufour J.P.

Plasma membrane ATPase from the yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe.Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 513-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In a control reaction, OM (20 μg/ml) was added to the assay to determine the OM-sensitive ATPase activity. After incubation at 30 °C for 20 min, the reaction was stopped by addition of 175 μl of ice-cold 40 mm H2SO4. The amount of released inorganic phosphate was determined by a colorimetric assay, using Na2HPO4 as standard (20Zaitseva J. Holland I.B. Schmitt L.

A classic or canonical NBS of an ABC transporter is composed of residues of the Walker A and Walker B motifs, the Q-loop, D-loop, and H-loop from one NBD and the C-loop of the opposing NBD forming a so-called composite ATP-binding site (Fig. 1A). Based on structural studies of P-loop NTPases (21Vetter I.R. Wittinghofer A. Nucleoside triphosphate-binding proteins: different scaffolds to achieve phosphoryl transfer.Q. Rev. Biophys. 1999; 32: 1-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), the lysine of the Walker A motif coordinates the β- and γ-phosphate moiety of ATP, and the aspartate residue of the Walker B motif interacts with the cofactor Mg2+ (12Zaitseva J.

The glutamate residue of the Walker B motif and the histidine residue of the H-loop are essential for ATPase activity and are shown to form a catalytic dyad (24Oldham M.L. Chen J.

However, in the case of Pdr5, mutation of the histidine in NBS2 did not reduce or even abolish ATPase activity as shown for many other ABC systems (see Zaitseva et al. (12Zaitseva J. Jenewein S. Oswald C. Jumpertz T. Holland I.B. Schmitt L. A molecular understanding of the catalytic cycle of the nucleotide-binding domain of the ABC transporter HlyB.Biochem. Soc.

Kueppers P. Klein C.M. Schwarzmueller T. Kuchler K. Schmitt L. A mutation of the H-loop selectively affects rhodamine transport by the yeast multidrug ABC transporter Pdr5.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 5069-5074Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The serine and second glycine residue of the C-loop of the opposing NBD interact with the γ-phosphate moiety of ATP and complete the NBS. Furthermore, the glutamine residue of the Q-loop also coordinates directly of indirectly the cofactor Mg2+. Although the D-loop is thought to be involved in NBD-NBD communication in the composite dimer. Here, we excluded the D-loop and the Q-loop from our experiments. An elegant study already investigated the role of the Q-loop in NBD-TMD cross-talk of Pdr5, where it was seen that the mutation of Q-loop residues from the deviant and consensus part of NBDs led to drug hypersensitivity and displayed functional redundancy, while maintaining significant ATPase activity (26Ananthaswamy N. Rutledge R. Sauna Z.E. Ambudkar S.V. Dine E. Nelson E. Xia D. Golin J. The signaling interface of the yeast multidrug transporter Pdr5 adopts a cis conformation, and there are functional overlap and equivalence of the deviant and canonical Q-loop residues.Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 4440-4449Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Hence, we focused only on the important residues of the Walker A and B motifs, the H-loop, and the C-loop for this study. Mutations to replace degenerate amino acid residues with their consensus counterparts were done in a stepwise fashion. The complete list of mutations is summarized in Table 2. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed in pRE5 plasmid after which the pdr5 gene was subsequently excised and transformed into the Saccharomyces strain Δpdr5Δpdr5prom, where by homologous recombination the pdr5 gene is chromosomally integrated (10Ernst R. Kueppers P. Klein C.M. Schwarzmueller T. Kuchler K. Schmitt L. A mutation of the H-loop selectively affects rhodamine transport by the yeast multidrug ABC transporter Pdr5.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 5069-5074Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In this background, this leads to constitutive expression of Pdr5 under the strong pdr5 promoter. In the following, restoration of the consensus sequence in the Walker A motif (C199K) located in NBD1 and forming NBS1 is called the “Walker A” mutant; restoration of the consensus sequence in the Walker B motif (N334E; NBD1) in NBS1 is called the “Walker B” mutant; restoration of the consensus sequence of the H-loop (Y367H, NBD1) in NBS1 is called the “H-loop” mutant, and restoration of the consensus sequence of the C-loop (N1011S/V1012G/E1013G, NBD2) in NBS1 is called the “C-loop” mutant. The corresponding combinations are called “HC-loop” (H- and C-loop mutations), AHC (H- and C-loop as well as Walker A mutations), and ABHC (H- and C-loop as well as Walker A and Walker B mutations). Please note that in the context of the combined mutations affecting the Walker A motif of NBS1, we also exchanged the proline residue at position 195 to a serine residue. We speculated that proline within the Walker A motif might hamper its functionality in wrapping around the phosphate moiety of the bound nucleotide. However, on the level of the single mutation, no difference to the single C199K mutant was detected.

As an internal control and reference for the absence of resistance, the Δpdr5 strain was employed. The response of the mutants toward these drugs was interestingly not uniform. For cycloheximide (Fig. 2A), the H-loop mutant displayed a stronger resistance as compared with wild type; for the azole drug, ketoconazole (Fig. 2B), Walker B and H-loop mutants were more resistant than wild type; for fluconazole (Fig. 2C), the Walker B, H-loop, and C-loop mutants displayed stronger resistance as compared with wild type. Finally, for R6G (Fig. 2D), the Walker A, H-loop, C-loop, HC-loop, and the ABHC mutants displayed higher resistance. Noticeably, the ABHC mutant, which contained all conserved residues and thereby restored a symmetrical architecture of the two NBSs, was severely impaired in providing better resistance toward all drugs except for R6G. ATPase activity tests were carried out, to investigate the biochemical basis for such altered drug resistance of the mutants. For this purpose, Pdr5-enriched plasma membranes were isolated using the Serrano protocol (27Serrano R. H+-ATPase from plasma membranes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Avena sativa roots: purification and reconstitution.Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 533-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 demonstrated that the expression levels in the plasma membrane of all mutants were very similar if not identical to wild type levels. Therefore, the differences in resistance patterns observed in the liquid drug assay cannot be attributed to differences in the amounts of protein being expressed. OM-sensitive ATPase activity was measured colorimetrically by determining the amount of inorganic phosphate released over time by the malachite green assay. The results are summarized in Fig. 4. As clearly seen, all mutants except the AHC and ABHC mutants displayed ATPase activity comparable with wild type with a 2-fold increase in apparent affinity at maximum for the H-loop mutant. Moreover, a quantitative analysis of the kinetic parameters of ATP hydrolysis revealed that the apparent affinity of these mutants toward ATP has not drastically changed (Table 3). Only the AHC and ABHC mutants were severely impaired in their maximal reaction velocity (Vmax) of ATP hydrolysis and displayed values comparable with the negative control (Δpdr5-containing strains).TABLE 3Kinetics of ATPase activity of Pdr5 mutantsMutantKmVmaxmmμmol/min·mgPdr5 WT1.71 ± 0.711.33 ± 0.23Walker A1.06 ± 0.271.50 ± 0.13Walker B1.97 ± 0.501.15 ± 0.13H-loop4.08 ± 1.492.09 ± 0.46C-loop1.36 ± 0.461.33 ± 0.17HC-loop1.04 ± 0.231.37 ± 0.10AHC1.19 ± 0.750.48 ± 0.97ABHC1.80 ± 0.500.20 ± 0.03 Open table in a new tab An in vitro R6G transport assay presents an elegant readout of the functional integrity of Pdr5 in inside-out membrane vesicles. The assay is based on the principle of transport of R6G molecules to the inner leaflet or the lumen of the vesicle in the presence of an energy source, i.e. ATP in our case. The decrease in fluorescence intensity is a result of the formation of nonfluorescent excimers of R6G once transported inside the vesicle. As summarized in Fig. 5, all mutants except the HC-loop and AHC and ABHC mutants were able to efficiently transport R6G, although at different rates inside the vesicle. The affinities of these mutants toward R6G are summarized in Table 4. As seen, the Km values are identical within experimental error for all mutants except for those that are impaired in R6G transport, but Vmax values display considerable variation representing differential effects of the point mutations on the rate of substrate transport.TABLE 4Kinetics of in vitro R6G transport activity of Pdr5 mutantsMutantKmVmaxnmrelative transport of R6G %Pdr5 WT20.1 ± 2.983.52 ± 5.7Walker A25.3 ± 6.623.62 ± 2.7Walker B21.4 ± 3.361.44 ± 5.8H-loop18.7 ± 3.471.52 ± 9.7C-loop20.2 ± 7.536.40 ± 5.6HC-loopNo transport3.74 ± 0.80AHCNo transport2.33 ± 0.67ABHCNo transport0.68 ± 0.13 Open table in a new tab When compared with the liquid drug resistance results of R6G, one has to stress that some mutants displayed better resistance than wild type Pdr5 but did not transport R6G in the in vitro transport assay. To investigate this disparity, we visualized R6G accumulations in yeast cells in the presence of R6G using fluorescence microscopy. As demonstrated in Fig. 6, a and b, cells lacking Pdr5 (Δpdr5) clearly displayed an accumulation of the dye within the cells, whereas wild type cells efficiently transported R6G out of the cells as no R6G fluorescence could be detected within the cells (Fig. 6, c and d).

https://openalex.org/W2105584394,"Unprecedented clinical responses have been reported in advanced stage metastatic melanoma patients treated with targeted inhibitors of constitutively activated mutant BRAF, which is present in approximately half of all melanomas. We and others have previously observed an association of elevated nuclear β-catenin with improved survival in molecularly-unselected melanoma patients. This study sought to determine whether levels of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in melanoma tumors prior to treatment might predict patient responses to BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi). We performed automated quantification of β-catenin immunohistochemical expression in pretreatment BRAF-mutant tumors from 32 BRAFi-treated melanoma patients. Unexpectedly, patients with higher nuclear β-catenin in their tumors did not exhibit the survival advantage previously observed in molecularly-unselected melanoma patients who did not receive BRAFi. In cultured melanoma cells treated with long-term BRAFi, activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling is markedly inhibited, coinciding with a loss of the enhancement of BRAFi-induced apoptosis by WNT3A observed in BRAFi-naïve cells. Together, these observations suggest that long-term treatment with BRAFi can impact the interaction between BRAF/MAPK and Wnt/β-catenin signaling to affect patient outcomes. Studies with larger patient cohorts are required to determine whether nuclear β-catenin expression correlates with clinical responses to BRAFi and to specific mechanisms of acquired resistance to BRAFi. Understanding these pathway interactions will be necessary to facilitate efforts to individualize therapies for melanoma patients."
https://openalex.org/W2087841004,"Objective Diabetes mellitus is highly prevalent and can lead to serious complications and mortality. Patient education can help to avoid negative outcomes, but up to half of the patients do not participate. The aim of this study was to analyze patients' attitudes towards diabetes education in order to identify barriers to participation and develop strategies for better patient education. Methods We conducted a qualitative study. Seven GP practices were purposively selected based on socio-demographic data of city districts in Hamburg, Germany. Study participants were selected by their GPs in order to increase participation. Semi-structured face-to-face interviews were conducted with 14 patients. Interviews were audiotaped and transcribed verbatim. The sample size was determined by data saturation. Data were analysed by qualitative content analysis. Categories were determined deductively and inductively. Results The interviews yielded four types of barriers: 1) Statements and behaviour of the attending physician influence the patients' decisions about diabetes education. 2) Both, a good state of health related to diabetes and physical/psychosocial comorbidity can be reasons for non-participation. 3) Manifold motivational factors were discussed. They ranged from giving low priority to diabetes to avoidance of implications of diabetes education as being confronted with illness narratives of others. 4) Barriers also include aspects of the patients' knowledge and activity. Conclusions First, physicians should encourage patients to participate in diabetes education and argue that they can profit even if actual treatment and examination results are promising. Second, patients with other priorities, psychic comorbidity or functional limitations might profit more from continuous individualized education adapted to their specific situation instead of group education. Third, it might be justified that patients do not participate in diabetes education if they have slightly increased blood sugar values only and no risk for harmful consequences or if they already have sufficient knowledge on diabetes."

Body composition and metabolism (HOMA index and lipid profile) were examined monthly. GC-MS was utilized to determine the eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA):arachidonic acid (AA) and the docosahexaenoic acid (DHA):AA in AT phospholipids. Adipose tissue (AT) mRNA expression of chemokines (MCP-1, Fetuin-A, CXCL14), marker genes for M1 and M2 macrophages (CD11c and CD206, respectively) and inflammatory markers (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, TLR-2, TLR-4, IL-10, GPR120) were measured along with activation of NFκB, JNK, and STAT-3. Macrophage infiltration into AT was examined using F4/80 immunohistochemistry.Any therapeutic benefit produced by reducing the omega-6:omega-3 was evident only when comparing the 1∶1 to 20∶1 HFD; the 1∶1 HFD resulted in a lower TC:HDL-C and decreased AT CXCL14 gene expression and AT macrophage infiltration, which was linked to a higher EPA:AA and DHA:AA in AT phospholipids. However, despite these effects, and independent of the omega-6:omega-3, all HFDs, in general, led to similar levels of adiposity, insulin resistance, and AT inflammation.Reducing the omega-6:omega-3 using α-linolenic acid is not an effective therapy for attenuating obesity and type II diabetes mellitus development."
https://openalex.org/W2033392612,"Despite the proven economic importance of Aloe vera, studies of saline stress and its effects on the biochemistry and mineral content in tissues of this plant are scarce. The objective of this study was to grow Aloe under NaCl stress of 0, 30, 60, 90 and 120 mM and compare: (1) proline, total protein, and enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEP-case) in chlorenchyma and parenchyma tissues, and (2) ion content (Na, K, Ca, Mg, Cl, Fe, P. N, Zn, B, Mn, and Cu) in roots, stems, leaves and sprouts. Proline and PEP-case increased as salinity increased in both parenchyma and chlorenchyma, while total protein increased in parenchyma and decreased in chlorenchyma, although at similar salt concentrations total protein was always higher in chlorenchyma. As salinity increased Na and Cl ions increased in roots, stems, leaves, while K decreased only significantly in sprouts. Salinity increases typically caused mineral content in tissue to decrease, or not change significantly. In roots, as salinity increased Mg decreased, while all other minerals failed to show a specific trend. In stems, the mineral concentrations that changed were Fe and P which increased with salinity while Cu decreased. In leaves, Mg, Mn, N, and B decreased with salinity, while Cu increased. In sprouts, the minerals that decreased with increasing salinity were Mg, Mn, and Cu. Zinc did not exhibit a trend in any of the tissues. The increase in protein, proline and PEP-case activity, as well as the absorption and accumulation of cations under moderate NaCl stress caused osmotic adjustment which kept the plant healthy. These results suggest that Aloe may be a viable crop for soil irrigated with hard water or affected by salinity at least at concentrations used in the present study."

The class was divided into subsets: two small subsets (n=50) as the intervention groups; a control group (n=102) was mixed with the remaining students (the non-randomised group n∼100) to create one large subset.The undergraduate curriculum of the Maastricht Medical School, applying the Problem-Based Learning principles. In this learning context, students learn mainly in tutorial groups, composed randomly from a large class every 6-10 weeks.The formal group learning activities were organised within the subsets. Students from the intervention groups met frequently within the formal groups, in contrast to the students from the large subset who hardly enrolled with the same students in formal activities.Three outcome measures assessed students' group learning processes over time: learning within formally organised small groups, learning with other students in the informal context and perceptions of the intervention.Formal group learning processes were perceived more positive in the intervention groups from the second study year on, with a mean increase of β=0.48. Informal group learning activities occurred almost exclusively within the subsets as defined by the intervention from the first week involved in the medical curriculum (E-I indexes>-0.69). Interviews tapped mainly positive effects and negligible negative side effects of the intervention.Better group learning processes can be achieved in large medical schools by making large classes seem small."

However, the gene expression characteristics of R. soongorica under drought stress have not been elucidated. Digital gene expression analysis was performed using Illumina technique to investigate differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between control and PEG-treated samples of R. soongorica. A total of 212,338 and 211,052 distinct tags were detected in the control and PEG-treated libraries, respectively. A total of 1,325 genes were identified as DEGs, 379 (28.6%) of which were up-regulated and 946 (71.4%) were down-regulated in response to drought stress. Functional annotation analysis identified numerous drought-inducible genes with various functions in response to drought stress. A number of regulatory proteins, functional proteins, and proteins induced by other stress factors in R. soongorica were identified. Alteration in the regulatory proteins (transcription factors and protein kinase) may be involved in signal transduction. Functional proteins, including flavonoid biosynthetic proteins, late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins, small heat shock proteins (sHSP), and aquaporin and proline transporter may play protective roles in response to drought stress. Flavonoids, LEA proteins and sHSP function as reactive oxygen species scavenger or molecular chaperone. Aquaporin and proline transporters regulate the distribution of water and proline throughout the whole plant. The tolerance ability of R. soongorica may be gained through effective signal transduction and enhanced protection of functional proteins to reestablish cellular homeostasis. DEGs obtained in this study may provide useful insights to help further understand the drought-tolerant mechanism of R. soongorica."
https://openalex.org/W2094999796,"Configuring high quality care for the rapidly increasing number of people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a major challenge worldwide for both providers and commissioners. In the UK, about two thirds of people with T2D are managed entirely in primary care, with wide variation in management strategies and achievement of targets. Pay for performance, introduced in 2004, initially resulted in improvements but disparities exist in ethnic minorities and the improvements are levelling off. Community based, intermediate care clinics for diabetes (ICCDs) were considered one solution and are functioning across the UK. However, there is no randomised trial evidence for the effectiveness of such clinics.This is a cluster-randomised trial, involving 3 primary care trusts, with 49 general practices randomised to usual care (n=25) or intervention (ICCDs; n=24). All eligible adult patients with T2D were invited; 1997 were recruited and 1280 followed-up after 18-months intervention.achievement of all three of the NICE targets [(HbA1c ≤ 7.0%/53 mmol/mol; Blood Pressure <140/80 mmHg; cholesterol <154 mg/dl (4 mmol/l)]. PRIMARY OUTCOME was achieved in 14.3% in the intervention arm vs. 9.3% in the control arm (p=0.059 after adjustment for covariates). The odds ratio (95% CI) for achieving primary outcome in the intervention group was 1.56 (0.98, 2.49). Primary care and community clinic costs were significantly higher in the intervention group, but there were no significant differences in hospital costs or overall healthcare costs. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of +£7,778 per QALY gained, indicated ICCD was marginally more expensive at producing health gain.Intermediate care clinics can contribute to improving target achievement in patients with diabetes. Further work is needed to investigate the optimal scale and organisational structure of ICCD services and whether, over time, their role may change as skill levels in primary care increase.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00945204; National Research Register (NRR) M0014178167."

In this study, we investigate the characterisation of the plasma lipid profiles of treated HIV patients and the relationship of 316 plasma lipid species across multiple lipid classes with the risk of future cardiovascular events in HIV-positive patients.In a retrospective case-control study, we analysed plasma lipid profiles of 113 subjects. Cases (n = 23) were HIV-positive individuals with a stored blood sample available 12 months prior to their diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD). They were age and sex matched to HIV-positive individuals without a diagnosis of CAD (n = 45) and with healthy HIV-negative volunteers (n = 45).Association of plasma lipid species and classes with HIV infection and cardiovascular risk in HIV were determined. In multiple logistic regression, we identified 83 lipids species and 7 lipid classes significantly associated with HIV infection and a further identified 74 lipid species and 8 lipid classes significantly associated with future cardiovascular events in HIV-positive subjects. Risk prediction models incorporating lipid species attained an area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.78 (0.775, 0.785)) and outperformed all other tested markers and risk scores in the identification of HIV-positive subjects with increased risk of cardiovascular events.Our results demonstrate that HIV-positive patients have significant differences in their plasma lipid profiles compared with healthy HIV-negative controls and that numerous lipid species were significantly associated with elevated cardiovascular risk. This suggests a potential novel application for plasma lipids in cardiovascular risk screening of HIV-positive patients."

The impact of Hla on the dynamics of the metabolome in eukaryotic host cells has not been investigated comprehensively. Using 1H-NMR, GC-MS and HPLC-MS, we quantified the concentrations of 51 intracellular metabolites and assessed alterations in the amount of 25 extracellular metabolites in the two human bronchial epithelial cell lines S9 and 16HBE14o- under standard culture conditions and after treatment with sub-lethal amounts (2 µg/ml) of recombinant Hla (rHla) in a time-dependent manner. Treatment of cells with rHla caused substantial decreases in the concentrations of intracellular metabolites from different metabolic pathways in both cell lines, including ATP and amino acids. Concomitant increases in the extracellular concentrations were detected for various intracellular compounds, including nucleotides, glutathione disulfide and NAD+. Our results indicate that rHla has a major impact on the metabolome of eukaryotic cells as a consequence of direct rHla-mediated alterations in plasma membrane permeability or indirect effects mediated by cellular signalling. However, cell-specific changes also were observed. Glucose consumption and lactate production rates suggest that the glycolytic activity of S9 cells, but not of 16HBE14o- cells, is increased in response to rHla. This could contribute to the observed higher level of resistance of S9 cells against rHla-induced membrane damage."
https://openalex.org/W1978016571,"Overproduction of N-terminal pyroglutamate (pGlu)-modified proteins utilizing Escherichia coli or eukaryotic cells is a challenging work owing to the fact that the recombinant proteins need to be recovered by proteolytic removal of fusion tags to expose the N-terminal glutaminyl or glutamyl residue, which is then converted into pGlu catalyzed by the enzyme glutaminyl cyclase. Herein we describe a new method for production of N-terminal pGlu-containing proteins in vivo via intracellular self-cleavage of fusion tags by tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease and then immediate N-terminal cyclization of passenger target proteins by a bacterial glutaminyl cyclase. To combine with the sticky-end PCR cloning strategy, this design allows the gene of target proteins to be efficiently inserted into the expression vector using two unique cloning sites (i.e., SnaB I and Xho I), and the soluble and N-terminal pGlu-containing proteins are then produced in vivo. Our method has been successfully applied to the production of pGlu-modified enhanced green fluorescence protein and monocyte chemoattractant proteins. This design will facilitate the production of protein drugs and drug target proteins that possess an N-terminal pGlu residue required for their physiological activities."

A CO algorithm using the quadratic function of population estimators is presented in this paper in order to generate a synthetic population while considering a two-fold nested structure for the individuals and households within the target areas. The baseline population in this study is generated from the confidentialised unit record files (CURFs) and 2006 Australian census tables. The dynamics of the created population is then projected over five years using a dynamic micro-simulation model for individual- and household-level demographic transitions. This projection is then compared with the 2011 Australian census. A prediction interval is provided for the population estimates obtained by the bootstrapping method, by which the variability structure of a predictor can be replicated in a bootstrap distribution."
https://openalex.org/W2011763787,"Essentially all aboveground plant tissues develop from the stem cells in the primary shoot apical meristem. Proliferation of the stem cell population in the Arabidopsis shoot apical meristem is tightly controlled by a feedback loop formed primarily by the homeodomain transcription factor WUSCHEL (WUS) and the CLAVATA ligand-receptor system. In this study, it is shown that mutation of a translation initiation factor, eIF3h, causes a tendency to develop a strikingly enlarged shoot apical meristem with elevated and ectopic expression of WUS and CLAVATA3 (CLV3). Many of the mRNAs that function in apical meristem maintenance possess upstream open reading frames (uORFs), translational attenuators that render translation partially dependent on eIF3h. Specifically, the mRNA for the receptor kinase, CLV1, is undertranslated in the eif3h mutant as shown by transient and transgenic expression assays. Concordant phenotypic observations include defects in organ polarity and in translation of another uORF-containing mRNA, ASYMMETRIC LEAVES 1 (AS1), in eif3h. In summary, the expression of developmental regulatory mRNAs is attenuated by uORFs, and this attenuation is balanced in part by the translation initiation factor, eIF3h. Thus, translational control plays a key role in Arabidopsis stem cell regulation and organogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2034517632,"Nearly half of flagellated microorganisms possess a multiple-flagellin system. Although a functional filament can be formed from one of multiple flagellins alone in many bacteria, it is more common that one flagellin is the major constituent and others contribute. Underlying mechanisms proposed for such scenarios cover flagellin regulation of various levels, including transcription, translation, post-translational modification, secretion, and filament assembly. In Shewanella oneidensis, the flagellar filament is composed of FlaA and FlaB flagellins; the latter is the major one in terms of motility. In this study, we showed that regulation of all levels except for filament assembly is indistinguishable between these two flagellins. Further analyses revealed that two amino acid residues predominantly dictated functional difference with respect to motility. Given that Shewanella prefer a solid surface-associated life style, of which filaments consisting of either FlaA or FlaB are equally supportive, we envision that roles of flagella in surface adhesion and formation of bacterial communities are particularly important for their survival and proliferation in these specific niches."

We performed a comprehensive FISH study for the detection of chromosomal translocations and deletions in formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor specimens arranged in TMA format. We analyzed 46 B-cell lymphoma (B-NHL) specimens with known karyotypes for translocations of IGH-, BCL2-, BCL6- and MYC-genes. Locus-specific DNA probes were used for the detection of deletions in chromosome bands 6q21 and 9p21 in 62 follicular lymphomas (FL) and six malignant mesothelioma (MM) samples, respectively. To test for aberrant signals generated by truncation of nuclei following sectioning of FFPE tissue samples, cell line dilutions with 9p21-deletions were embedded into paraffin blocks. The overall TMA hybridization efficiency was 94%. FISH results regarding translocations matched karyotyping data in 93%. As for chromosomal deletions, sectioning artefacts occurred in 17% to 25% of cells, suggesting that the proportion of cells showing deletions should exceed 25% to be reliably detectable. In conclusion, FISH represents a robust tool for the detection of structural as well as numerical aberrations in FFPE tissue samples in a TMA-based high-throughput setting, when rigorous cut-off values and appropriate controls are maintained, and, of note, was superior to quantitative PCR approaches."
https://openalex.org/W2056594696,"Reactivation of the endogenous telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) catalytic subunit and telomere elongation occur during the reprogramming of somatic cells to induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. However, the role of TERT in the reprogramming process is unclear. To clarify its function, the reprogramming process was examined in TERT-KO somatic cells. To exclude the effect of telomere elongation, tail-tip fibroblasts (TTFs) from first generation TERT-KO mice were used. Although iPS cells were successfully generated from TERT-KO TTFs, the efficiency of reprogramming these cells was markedly lower than that of WT TTFs. The gene expression profiles of iPS cells induced from TERT-KO TTFs were similar to those of WT iPS cells and ES cells, and TERT-KO iPS cells formed teratomas that differentiated into all three germ layers. These data indicate that TERT plays an extratelomeric role in the reprogramming process, but its function is dispensable. However, TERT-KO iPS cells showed transient defects in growth and teratoma formation during continuous growth. In addition, TERT-KO iPS cells developed chromosome fusions that accumulated with increasing passage numbers, consistent with the fact that TERT is essential for the maintenance of genome structure and stability in iPS cells. In a rescue experiment, an enzymatically inactive mutant of TERT (D702A) had a positive effect on somatic cell reprogramming of TERT-KO TTFs, which confirmed the extratelomeric role of TERT in this process."

Human cells behaviors to AC electrokinetics remain unclear over a large frequency spectrum as illustrated by the self-rotation effect observed recently. We here report and analyze human cells behaviors in different conditions of medium conductivity, electric field frequency and magnitude. We also observe the self-rotation of human cells, in the absence of a rotational electric field. Based on an analytical competitive model of electrokinetic forces, we propose an explanation of the cell self-rotation.

SD-OCTs were performed before, 1 week, and 1 month after surgery. The number of vitreous hyper-reflective dots (VHDs) was counted in 5 OCT images of high-definition 5-line raster scans. The development of CME was assessed using postoperative 1-month OCT.In 74 eyes of 74 patients, all of three SD-OCTs with a signal to noise ratio of 0.6 or more were available and were analyzed in this study. In preoperative OCT, the VHD was observed in 2 (2.7%) of 74 eyes; one eye had 1 VHD and the other eye had 2 VHDs. In 72 eyes with no preoperative VHD, VHDs were observed in 40 (55.6%) eyes at 1 week after the surgery. In the multivariate analysis, the number of VHDs measured at 1 week after the surgery was significantly associated with CME development at 1 month after the surgery (odds ratio = 1.93, 95% confidence interval = 1.15 to 3.24, P = 0.012).VHDs were frequently observed in OCT after uneventful phacoemulsification cataract surgery. VHDs observed at 1 week after the surgery may be a risk factor for the development of pseudophakic CME. Further studies are needed to identify the source of the VHDs."

Successful application of this process depends on the fundamental understanding of the respiration and metabolism of D. mccartyi. Reductive dehalogenases, encoded by rdhA genes of these anaerobic bacteria, exclusively catalyze organohalide respiration and drive metabolism. To better elucidate D. mccartyi metabolism and physiology, we analyzed available transcriptomic data for a pure isolate (Dehalococcoides mccartyi strain 195) and a mixed microbial consortium (KB-1) using the previously developed pan-genome-scale reconstructed metabolic network of D. mccartyi. The transcriptomic data, together with available proteomic data helped confirm transcription and expression of the majority genes in D. mccartyi genomes. A composite genome of two highly similar D. mccartyi strains (KB-1 Dhc) from the KB-1 metagenome sequence was constructed, and operon prediction was conducted for this composite genome and other single genomes. This operon analysis, together with the quality threshold clustering analysis of transcriptomic data helped generate experimentally testable hypotheses regarding the function of a number of hypothetical proteins and the poorly understood mechanism of energy conservation in D. mccartyi. We also identified functionally enriched important clusters (13 for strain 195 and 11 for KB-1 Dhc) of co-expressed metabolic genes using information from the reconstructed metabolic network. This analysis highlighted some metabolic genes and processes, including lipid metabolism, energy metabolism, and transport that potentially play important roles in organohalide respiration. Overall, this study shows the importance of an organism's metabolic reconstruction in analyzing various “omics” data to obtain improved understanding of the metabolism and physiology of the organism."
https://openalex.org/W2095442432,"Human hepatoma cell lines are commonly used as alternatives to primary hepatocytes for the study of drug metabolism in vitro. However, the phase I cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme activities in these cell lines occur at a much lower level than their corresponding activities in primary hepatocytes, and thus these cell lines may not accurately predict drug metabolism. In the present study, we selected hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 alpha (HNF1α) from six transcriptional regulators for lentiviral transfection into Hep G2 cells to optimally increase their expression of the CYP3A4 enzyme, which is the major CYP enzyme in the human body. We subsequently found that HNF1α-transfected Hep G2 enhanced the CYP3A4 expression in a time- and dose-dependent manner and the activity was noted to increase with time and peaked 7 days. With a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 100, CYP3A4 expression increased 19-fold and enzyme activity more than doubled at day 7. With higher MOI (1,000 to 3,000), the activity increased 8- to 10-fold; however, it was noted the higher MOI, the higher cell death rate and lower cell survival. Furthermore, the CYP3A4 activity in the HNF1α-transfected cells could be induced by CYP3A4-specific inducer, rifampicin, and metabolized nifedipine in a dose-dependent manner. With an MOI of 3,000, nifedipine-metabolizing activity was 6-fold of control and as high as 66% of primary hepatocytes. In conclusion, forceful delivery of selected transcriptional regulators into human hepatoma cells might be a valuable method to enhance the CYP activity for a more accurate determination of drug metabolism in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W2048196715,"We recently showed a desensitization of FcεRI-mediated basophil response after short-term VIT. Our aim was to evaluate the allergen specificity of this desensitization.In 11 Hymenoptera-venom double positive subjects, basophil threshold sensitivity (CD-sens) to anti-FcεRI, honeybee, and Vespula venom was assessed at the beginning and just before the first maintenance dose (MD) of single ultra-rush VIT. In some patients we also monitored CD-sens to rApi m 1 and/or rVes v 5 or other co-sensitizations (i.e., grass pollen). In additional 7 patients, basophils were stripped and sensitized with house dust mite (HDM) IgEs at the same time points.We demonstrated a marked reduction of CD-sens to anti-FcεRI and VIT-specific venom before the first MD in all 18 subjects included. Furthermore, in 10 out of 11 double positive subjects, a significant and comparable decrease before the first MD was also evident for non-VIT venom; this nonspecific decrease was further supported by the opposite recombinant species-specific major allergen. In one subject with additional grass pollen allergy, a decrease of CD-sens to grass allergen was also demonstrated. Similarly, in 7 cases of patients with passively HDM-sensitized basophils, a significant reduction of CD-sens was also evident to de novo sensitized HDM allergen.Short-term VIT induced basophil desensitization to VIT-specific as well as to VIT-nonspecific venom. As opposed to long-term VIT, which induces venom-specific changes, the effect of short-term VIT seems to be venom-nonspecific."
https://openalex.org/W2066499997,"Background Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are implicated in protection against vascular disease. However, studies using angiography alone have reported conflicting results when relating EPCs to epicardial coronary artery disease (CAD) severity. Moreover, the relationship between different EPC types and the coronary microcirculation is unknown. We therefore investigated the relationship between EPC populations and coronary epicardial and microvascular disease. Methods Thirty-three patients with a spectrum of isolated left anterior descending artery disease were studied. The coronary epicardial and microcirculation were physiologically interrogated by measurement of fractional flow reserve (FFR), index of microvascular resistance (IMR) and coronary flow reserve (CFR). Two distinct EPC populations (early EPC and late outgrowth endothelial cells [OECs]) were isolated from these patients and studied ex vivo. Results There was a significant inverse relationship between circulating OEC levels and epicardial CAD severity, as assessed by FFR and angiography (r = 0.371, p = 0.04; r = -0.358, p = 0.04; respectively). More severe epicardial CAD was associated with impaired OEC migration and tubulogenesis (r = 0.59, p = 0.005; r = 0.589, p = 0.004; respectively). Patients with significant epicardial CAD (FFR<0.75) had lower OEC levels and function compared to those without hemodynamically significant stenoses (p<0.05). In contrast, no such relationship was seen for early EPC number and function, nor was there a relationship between IMR and EPCs. There was a significant relationship between CFR and OEC function. Conclusions EPC populations differ in regards to their associations with CAD severity. The number and function of OECs, but not early EPCs, correlated significantly with epicardial CAD severity. There was no relationship between EPCs and severity of coronary microvascular disease."
https://openalex.org/W2070824538,"We investigated the effect of chronic nicotine on cholinergically-mediated renal vasodilations in female rats and its modulation by the nitric oxide synthase (NOS)/heme oxygenase (HO) pathways. Dose-vasodilatory response curves of acetylcholine (0.01–2.43 nmol) were established in isolated phenylephrine-preconstricted perfused kidneys obtained from rats treated with or without nicotine (0.5–4.0 mg/kg/day, 2 weeks). Acetylcholine vasodilations were potentiated by low nicotine doses (0.5 and 1 mg/kg/day) in contrast to no effect for higher doses (2 and 4 mg/kg/day). The facilitatory effect of nicotine was acetylcholine specific because it was not observed with other vasodilators such as 5′-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (NECA, adenosine receptor agonist) or papaverine. Increases in NOS and HO-1 activities appear to mediate the nicotine-evoked enhancement of acetylcholine vasodilation because the latter was compromised after pharmacologic inhibition of NOS (L-NAME) or HO-1 (zinc protoporphyrin, ZnPP). The renal protein expression of phosphorylated Akt was not affected by nicotine. We also show that the presence of the two ovarian hormones is necessary for the nicotine augmentation of acetylcholine vasodilations to manifest because nicotine facilitation was lost in kidneys of ovariectomized (OVX) and restored after combined, but not individual, supplementation with medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) and estrogen (E2). Together, the data suggests that chronic nicotine potentiates acetylcholine renal vasodilation in female rats via, at least partly, Akt-independent HO-1 upregulation. The facilitatory effect of nicotine is dose dependent and requires the presence of the two ovarian hormones."
https://openalex.org/W1967869688,"Hypoxia-Inducible Factor (HIF) transcription factors are heterodimeric proteins involved in the regulation of oxygen homeostatis. Their upregulation has been related to several tumors with a remarkably poor clinical outcome. The recent discovery of a druggable cavity in the HIF-2α PAS-B domain has opened an unprecedented opportunity for targeting the HIF-2α transcription factor in view of pharmaceutical strategies. Coincidentally, a novel compound able to selectively disrupt the HIF heterodimerization with a submicromolar activity has been reported. In this work, we investigated the molecular mechanisms responsible for the inhibition by comparing the dynamical features of the HIF-2α PAS-B monomer and the HIF-2α PAS-B/HIF-1β PAS-B complex, in the ligand-bound and -unbound states. Plain and biased Molecular Dynamics were used to characterize the differential conformational changes both structurally and energetically."
https://openalex.org/W2053158992,"Rotator cuff tear is a common cause of shoulder diseases. Correct diagnosis of rotator cuff tears can save patients from further invasive, costly and painful tests. This study used predictive data mining and Bayesian theory to improve the accuracy of diagnosing rotator cuff tears by clinical examination alone.In this retrospective study, 169 patients who had a preliminary diagnosis of rotator cuff tear on the basis of clinical evaluation followed by confirmatory MRI between 2007 and 2011 were identified. MRI was used as a reference standard to classify rotator cuff tears. The predictor variable was the clinical assessment results, which consisted of 16 attributes. This study employed 2 data mining methods (ANN and the decision tree) and a statistical method (logistic regression) to classify the rotator cuff diagnosis into ""tear"" and ""no tear"" groups. Likelihood ratio and Bayesian theory were applied to estimate the probability of rotator cuff tears based on the results of the prediction models.Our proposed data mining procedures outperformed the classic statistical method. The correction rate, sensitivity, specificity and area under the ROC curve of predicting a rotator cuff tear were statistical better in the ANN and decision tree models compared to logistic regression. Based on likelihood ratios derived from our prediction models, Fagan's nomogram could be constructed to assess the probability of a patient who has a rotator cuff tear using a pretest probability and a prediction result (tear or no tear).Our predictive data mining models, combined with likelihood ratios and Bayesian theory, appear to be good tools to classify rotator cuff tears as well as determine the probability of the presence of the disease to enhance diagnostic decision making for rotator cuff tears."
https://openalex.org/W2093410520,"USPIO is a contrast agent for MRI that can generate T2W images with low signal intensities. After subcutaneous or intravenous injection of USPIO, normal lymph node tissues uptake these nano-particles, but tumor cells do not. Thus, tumor metastasis can be detected using this contrast agent.The aim of this study was to access the feasibility of USPIO enhanced MRI for the detection of cervical lymph node metastasis in a pyriform sinus carcinoma animal model and to investigate the ability of USPIO to enhance images of cervical lymph node metastases.Twenty New Zealand rabbits were randomly divided into tumor and inflammatory groups, and each group contained 10 rabbits. In the inflammatory group, a 0.5 ml egg yolk emulsion was injected into the sub-mandibular muscle of the rabbits to induce an inflammatory reaction in their cervical lymph nodes. In the tumor group, a VX2 tumor tissue suspension was transplanted into the pyriform sinus sub-mucosa of the rabbits using direct laryngoscope. Four weeks after the tumor or egg yolk injection, MRIs were performed before and after USPIO injection to observe the imaging enhancement features of USPIO. After that, a histo-pathological analysis was performed for all rabbits. We found the metastatic lymph nodes had no signal reduced intensity or irregular signal reduced intensity on T2-weighted image by using USPIO enhancement. In the tumor group,the sensitivity and specificity of plain MRI were 57.6% and 60.7%. The corresponding values of USPIO-enhanced MRl were 96.1% and 85.7%. (P<0.05).The features and the extent of the lymph node metastases corresponded to those observed on USPIO-enhanced MR images. USPIO-enhanced MRI is useful for the detection and estimation of lymph node metastasis in this cervical carcinoma animal model."
https://openalex.org/W2010214177,"Sarcomas are a heterogeneous group of mesenchymal malignancies and unfortunately there are limited functional genomics platforms to assess the molecular pathways contributing to sarcomagenesis. Thus, novel model systems are needed to validate which genes should be targeted for therapeutic intervention. We hypothesized that delivery of oncogenes into mouse skeletal muscle using a retroviral (RCAS-TVA) system would result in sarcomagenesis. We also sought to determine if the cell type transformed (mesenchymal progenitors vs. terminally differentiated tissues) would influence sarcoma biology. Cells transduced with RCAS vectors directing the expression of oncoproteins KrasG12D, c-Myc and/or Igf2 were injected into the hindlimbs of mice that expressed the retroviral TVA receptor in neural/mesenchymal progenitors, skeletal/cardiac muscle or ubiquitously (N-tva, AKE and BKE strains respectively). Disrupting the G1 checkpoint CDKN2 (p16/p19−/−) resulted in sarcoma in 30% of p16/p19−/−xN-tva mice with a median latency of 23 weeks (range 8–40 weeks). A similar incidence occurred in p16/p19−/−xBKE mice (32%), however, a shorter median latency (10.4 weeks) was observed. p16/p19−/−xAKE mice also developed sarcomas (24% incidence; median 9 weeks) yet 31% of mice also developed lung sarcomas. Gene-anchored PCR demonstrated retroviral DNA integration in 86% of N-tva, 93% of BKE and 88% of AKE tumors. KrasG12D was the most frequent oncogene isolated. Oncogene delivery by the RCAS-TVA system can generate sarcomas in mice with a defective cell cycle checkpoint. Sarcoma biology differed between the different RCAS models we created, likely due to the cell population being transformed. This genetically flexible system will be a valuable tool for sarcoma research."
https://openalex.org/W2090679571,"Inactivation of gene products by dominant negative mutants is a valuable tool to assign functions to yet uncharacterized proteins, to map protein-protein interactions or to dissect physiological pathways. Detailed functional and structural knowledge about the target protein would allow the construction of inhibitory mutants by targeted mutagenesis. Yet, such data are limited for the majority of viral proteins, so that the target gene needs to be subjected to random mutagenesis to identify suitable mutants. However, for cytomegaloviruses this requires a two-step screening approach, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Here, we report the establishment of a high-throughput suitable screening system for the identification of inhibitory alleles of essential genes of the murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV). In this screen, the site-specific recombination of a specifically modified MCMV genome was transferred from the bacterial background to permissive host cells, thereby combining the genetic engineering and the rescue test in one step. Using a reference set of characterized pM53 mutants it was shown that the novel system is applicable to identify non-complementing as well as inhibitory mutants in a high-throughput suitable setup. The new cis-complementation assay was also applied to a basic genetic characterization of pM99, which was identified as essential for MCMV growth. We believe that the here described novel genetic screening approach can be adapted for the genetic characterization of essential genes of any large DNA viruses."
