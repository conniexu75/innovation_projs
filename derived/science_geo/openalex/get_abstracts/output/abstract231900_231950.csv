https://openalex.org/W2170098818,"Spin is a fundamental property of all elementary particles. Classically it can be viewed as a tiny magnetic moment, but a measurement of an electron spin along the direction of an external magnetic field can have only two outcomes: parallel or anti-parallel to the field. This discreteness reflects the quantum mechanical nature of spin. Ensembles of many spins have found diverse applications ranging from magnetic resonance imaging to magneto-electronic devices, while individual spins are considered as carriers for quantum information. Read-out of single spin states has been achieved using optical techniques, and is within reach of magnetic resonance force microscopy. However, electrical read-out of single spins has so far remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate electrical single-shot measurement of the state of an individual electron spin in a semiconductor quantum dot. We use spin-to-charge conversion of a single electron confined in the dot, and detect the single-electron charge using a quantum point contact; the spin measurement visibility is ~65%. Furthermore, we observe very long single-spin energy relaxation times (up to 0.85 ms at a magnetic field of 8 Tesla), which are encouraging for the use of electron spins as carriers of quantum information."
https://openalex.org/W2067245109,"Natural variation in gene expression is extensive in humans and other organisms, and variation in the baseline expression level of many genes has a heritable component. To localize the genetic determinants of these quantitative traits (expression phenotypes) in humans, we used microarrays to measure gene expression levels and performed genome-wide linkage analysis for expression levels of 3,554 genes in 14 large families. For approximately 1,000 expression phenotypes, there was significant evidence of linkage to specific chromosomal regions. Both cis- and trans-acting loci regulate variation in the expression levels of genes, although most act in trans. Many gene expression phenotypes are influenced by several genetic determinants. Furthermore, we found hotspots of transcriptional regulation where significant evidence of linkage for several expression phenotypes (up to 31) coincides, and expression levels of many genes that share the same regulatory region are significantly correlated. The combination of microarray techniques for phenotyping and linkage analysis for quantitative traits allows the genetic mapping of determinants that contribute to variation in human gene expression."

https://openalex.org/W1970101802,"The Earth's lower mantle is believed to be composed mainly of (Mg,Fe)SiO3 perovskite, with lesser amounts of (Mg,Fe)O and CaSiO3 (ref. 1). But it has not been possible to explain many unusual properties of the lowermost ∼150 km of the mantle (the D″ layer) with this mineralogy. Here, using ab initio simulations and high-pressure experiments, we show that at pressures and temperatures of the D″ layer, MgSiO3 transforms from perovskite into a layered CaIrO3-type post-perovskite phase. The elastic properties of the post-perovskite phase and its stability field explain several observed puzzling properties of the D″ layer: its seismic anisotropy2, the strongly undulating shear-wave discontinuity at its top3,4,5,6 and possibly the anticorrelation between shear and bulk sound velocities7,8."
https://openalex.org/W2087382039,"Because human languages vary in sound and meaning, children must learn which distinctions their language uses. For speech perception, this learning is selective: initially infants are sensitive to most acoustic distinctions used in any language, and this sensitivity reflects basic properties of the auditory system rather than mechanisms specific to language; however, infants' sensitivity to non-native sound distinctions declines over the course of the first year. Here we ask whether a similar process governs learning of word meanings. We investigated the sensitivity of 5-month-old infants in an English-speaking environment to a conceptual distinction that is marked in Korean but not English; that is, the distinction between 'tight' and 'loose' fit of one object to another. Like adult Korean speakers but unlike adult English speakers, these infants detected this distinction and divided a continuum of motion-into-contact actions into tight- and loose-fit categories. Infants' sensitivity to this distinction is linked to representations of object mechanics that are shared by non-human animals. Language learning therefore seems to develop by linking linguistic forms to universal, pre-existing representations of sound and meaning."

https://openalex.org/W1997934335,"Exposure of cells to carcinogenic compounds of nickel(II) and cobalt(II) causes activation of the HIF-1 transcription factor and up-regulates a battery of hypoxia-inducible genes. However, the mechanism of HIF-1 activation by these metals is not known. It was shown recently that hydroxylation of prolines in the HIFα subunit of HIF-1 is required for its binding with the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein and the subsequent proteasomal destruction. Here we show that responsible prolyl hydroxylases are targets for both nickel(II) and cobalt(II) because degradation of a reporter protein containing the oxygen-dependent degradation domain (Pro-402/564) of HIFα was abolished in a von Hippel-Lindau-dependent manner in cells exposed to nickel(II) or cobalt(II). The enzymatic activity of prolyl hydroxylases depends on iron as the activating metal, 2-oxoglutarate as a co-substrate, and ascorbic acid as a cofactor. Hydroxylase activity can be impaired by the depletion of any of these factors. We found that exposure of cells to nickel(II) or cobalt(II) did not affect the level of intracellular iron. Instead, nickel(II) or cobalt(II) exposure greatly depleted intracellular ascorbate. Co-exposure of cells to metals and ascorbate resulted in the increase of intracellular ascorbate and reversed both metal-induced stabilization of HIF-1α and HIF-1-dependent gene transcription. Because ascorbate is essential for maintaining iron in prolyl hydroxylases in the active iron(II) state, we suggest that the observed depletion of ascorbate by nickel(II) or cobalt(II) favors iron oxidation and thus inactivation of the enzyme.

Nickel and cobalt have wide industrial usage, which leads to environmental pollution by these metals and their by-products at all stages of production, recycling, and disposal (1Bennett B.G.

Additionally, burning of fossil fuels pollutes the air with metal-containing particles, up to 35% of which could be composed of nickel (3Gavett S.H. Madison S.L. Dreher K.L. Winsett D.W. McGee J.K. Costa D.L. Environ. Res. 1997; 72: 162-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Environmental or occupational exposure to particles containing nickel or cobalt causes various forms of lung injury including pneumonitis, asthma, and fibrosis (4Kelleher P. Pacheco K. Newman L.S.

An interesting feature of nickel or cobalt exposure is the induction of hypoxia-like stress, which is manifested in cells by the activation of the HIF-1 1The abbreviations used are: HIF, hypoxia-inducible factor; CMV, cytomegalovirus; DFX, deferoxamine mesylate; DHA, dehydroascorbic acid; DMOG, dimethyloxalylglycine; FIH, factor inhibiting HIF; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; HRE, HIF response element; Luc, luciferase; 2OG, 2-oxoglutarate; ODD, oxygen-dependent degradation domain; PHD, prolyl hydroxylase domain; VHL, von HippelLindau; wt, wild type. 1The abbreviations used are: HIF, hypoxia-inducible factor; CMV, cytomegalovirus; DFX, deferoxamine mesylate; DHA, dehydroascorbic acid; DMOG, dimethyloxalylglycine; FIH, factor inhibiting HIF; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; HRE, HIF response element; Luc, luciferase; 2OG, 2-oxoglutarate; ODD, oxygen-dependent degradation domain; PHD, prolyl hydroxylase domain; VHL, von HippelLindau; wt, wild type. transcription factor and hypoxia-inducible genes (8Huang L.E.

It has been suggested that the induction of the hypoxia-like stress by these metals is based on their ability to substitute for an iron atom in an “oxygen sensor” (11Goldberg M.A. Dunning S.P. Bunn H.F. Science. 1988; 242: 1412-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar). No direct evidence supporting this interesting hypothesis is available, although several studies have demonstrated that Co(II) can inhibit activity of recombinant asparaginyl (12Hewitson K.S.

The induction of hypoxia-like stress by nickel or cobalt has numerous implications. It is well established that HIF-inducible genes are involved in crucial aspects of cancer biology, including angiogenesis, cell survival, glucose metabolism, and invasion (14Semenza G.L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 721-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (5201) Google Scholar, 15Acker T. Plate K.H. J. Mol. Med. 2002; 80: 562-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar).Recently, using HIF-1α normal and knock-out cells, we have shown that nickel promotes soft agar growth via the HIF-1 transcription factor (16Salnikow K. Davidson T. Zhang Q. Chen L.C. Su W. Costa M. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 3524-3530PubMed Google Scholar). These data indicate that HIF-1 induction may play an important role in nickel-mediated malignant transformation of cells. The HIF-1 transcription factor is a heterodimer composed of α and β subunits (17Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1230-1237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1694) Google Scholar). The activity of HIF-1 depends on the accumulation of short lived HIFα. Under normoxic conditions, hydroxylation of proline residues 402 and 564 in the ODD of HIF-1α leads to its interaction with the VHL tumor suppressor protein, a part of the ubiquitin ·ligase complex, followed by ubiquitylation and rapid proteosomal degradation of HIF-1α (18Maxwell P.H. Wiesener M.S. Chang G.W. Clifford S.C. Vaux E.C. Cockman M.E. Wykoff C.C. Pugh C.W. Maher E.R. Ratcliffe P.J. Nature. 1999; 399: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (4070) Google Scholar, 19Ivan M.

Science. 2001; 292: 468-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (4367) Google Scholar). Under hypoxic conditions, limiting oxygen decreases hydroxylation, which prevents VHL binding and leads to the accumulation of HIF-1α protein. Nickel(II) or cobalt(II) exposure even in the presence of oxygen causes increased accumulation of HIF-1α protein and induction of HIF-1 transcriptional activity (17Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1230-1237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1694) Google Scholar, 21Salnikow K. An W.G. Melillo G. Blagosklonny M.V. Costa M.

The accumulation of HIF-1α protein observed in cells after cobalt(II) exposure resulted from the inability of HIFα to complex with the VHL protein (18Maxwell P.H. Wiesener M.S. Chang G.W. Clifford S.C. Vaux E.C. Cockman M.E. Wykoff C.C. Pugh C.W. Maher E.R. Ratcliffe P.J. Nature. 1999; 399: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (4070) Google Scholar). This inability, as we found here, is associated with inhibition of HIF-1α hydroxylation, manifested by both cobalt(II) and nickel(II) exposure. HIF activity can also be affected by the asparaginyl hydroxylation of the C-terminal transactivation domain, which is regulated by FIH-1 (23Lando D. Peet D.J. Gorman J.J. Whelan D.A. Whitelaw M.L. Bruick R.K. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1466-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1201) Google Scholar). Like the prolyl hydroxylase, this enzyme is Fe(II)- and ascorbate-dependent and could likewise be affected by metals and contribute to the observed phenotype.Prolyl hydroxylases are non-heme iron-dependent oxygenases that utilize 2OG as a co-substrate and ascorbic acid as a cofactor (24Kivirikko K.I. Myllyla R. Pihlajaniemi T. FASEB J. 1989; 3: 1609-1617Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that during the enzymatic reaction, in the presence of oxygen and 2OG, the enzyme-bound iron(II) is rapidly converted to iron(III), which causes the inactivation of the enzyme. The role of ascorbate is to reduce iron(III) and thus reactivate the enzyme (25de Jong L. Albracht S.P. Kemp A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 704: 326-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This scenario implies that depletion or oxidation of iron(II) must lead to the loss of enzymatic activity. In the present paper, we investigated whether nickel(II) and cobalt(II) exposure could deplete cellular iron and/or ascorbate and whether such depletion would result in inhibition of prolyl hydroxylase activity. The results clearly indicate that levels of ascorbate rather than iron limit prolyl hydroxylase activity in metal-exposed cells. Because human cells do not produce ascorbate (26Rose R.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 947: 335-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), the intracellular ascorbate level depends on a delicate balance of metabolic consumption, uptake, and efflux. Here we demonstrate that the cellular ascorbate is greatly depleted by exposure to both metals. We propose that ascorbate depletion in nickel(II)- or cobalt(II)-exposed cells favors enzyme-bound iron oxidation, which by itself or followed by metal substitution leads to the inactivation of prolyl hydroxylases.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents—NiSO4 ·6H2O was obtained from Alfa Aesar (Ward Hill, MA). FeSO4 ·7H2O, CoCl2 ·6H2O, and l-ascorbic acid were obtained from Sigma, and deferoxamine mesylate (DFX) was obtained from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Protease inhibitor mixture was purchased from Roche Applied Science.

An W.G. Melillo G. Blagosklonny M.V. Costa M. Carcinogenesis. 1999; 20: 1819-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). DNA encoding the HIF-1α ODD (amino acids 401–602) was fused in-frame to the 3′-end of the luciferase cDNA in the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) to generate the CMV-Luc-ODD plasmid.Cell Lines and Culture Conditions—The 1HAEo– cell line was obtained from Dr. Gruenert (27Gruenert D.C. Finkbeiner W.E. Widdicombe J.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: L347-L360PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown on plastic coated with the mixture of bovine serum albumin (Invitrogen) and collagen (Cohesion, Palo Alto, CA) in minimum essential medium with Earle's modified salts (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin. 786-0 human renal carcinoma cells with mutant VHL or 786-0 wt4 expressing wild type VHL cells were maintained in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin.Reporter Assays—20,000 1HAEo– cells/well were plated into 96-well plates in 100 μl of medium. The next day cells were transfected with 50 ng/well CMV-Luc-ODD and 200 ng/well pRL-tk Renilla luciferase (RL-tk) or 100 ng/well HRE-Luc and 200 ng/well RL-tk plasmids with the transfection reagent effecten (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). After transfection, plasmid expression was allowed for 16–24 h followed by exposure to metals or other chemicals for an additional 20 h. The reporter expression was detected using the Dual-Glo luciferase system (Promega, Madison, WI) and the MicroLumat LB 96V luminometer (Berthold Technologies, Bad Wildbad, Germany). The data are presented as mean values ± S.D. of normalized relative luciferase units (RLU), which represent the ratio of luminescence produced by CMV-Luc-ODD or HRE-Luc plasmid to the luminescence of the RL-tk reporter in the same well (Promega). Each condition has been tested in quadruplicate in at least three independent experiments.Measurement of Ascorbate Levels—HPLC measurements of total intracellular vitamin C levels were performed by HPLC as described previously (28Quievryn G. Messer J. Zhitkovich A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3156-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar).Determination of Prolyl Hydroxylase Activity—Prolyl hydroxylase activity was determined as described elsewhere (29Kaule G. Gunzler V. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 184: 291-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were collected by scraping in phosphate-buffered saline. The pellet was resuspended in 6 volumes of 0.15 mm MgCl2, 10mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, and incubated for 2 min on ice. Cells were then homogenized using Dounce homogenizer (30 strokes). Dextrose was added to a final concentration 0.25 m, and the homogenate was centrifuged at 1500 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to remove nuclei. The mitochondrial fraction was separated by the second centrifugation at 6500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration was measured using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit. The hydroxylase reaction was carried out using 30 μg of protein in the reaction buffer containing 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 μm FeSO4, 0.1 mm l-[5-14C]α-ketoglutaric acid, 200 μm ODD peptide (amino acids 556–575 of HIF-1α) (Advanced ChemTech, Louisville, KY), 0.25 mm ascorbate, 0.4 mg/ml catalase, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol. Samples were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in a final volume of 50 μl. After incubation, 25 μl of mixture of 20 mm succinate and 2OG was added, followed by the addition of 25 μl of 0.16 m 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine in 30% HClO4. The samples were allowed to sit for 30 min at room temperature following the addition of 50 μl of 1 m 2OG. Supernatants were separated by spinning at 3000 × g for 5 min, and radioactivity was measured in a liquid scintillation counter.Western Blot Analysis—Protein extracts were obtained after lysing cells in the lysis buffer (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA) for 15 min at 4 °C. Equal loading of protein was assured by prior quantitation using the Bio-Rad assay. Protein aliquots were separated by gel electrophoresis in 10 or 12% polyacrylamide minigels and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Roche Applied Science). Western blot analysis of hypoxia-inducible NDRG-1/Cap43 protein levels was performed using rabbit polyclonal antibody as described previously (30Salnikow K. Kluz T. Costa M. Piquemal D. Demidenko Z.N. Xie K. Blagosklonny M.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1734-1741Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Antibodies against α-tubulin were purchased from Sigma. Immunoreactive bands were detected using horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody and enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).RESULTSEffect of Nickel(II) or Cobalt(II) on Hydroxylation of Pro-402/564 in HIF-1α- and HIF-dependent Transcription—The hypothetical mechanism of induction of the hypoxia-like stress by metals suggests substitution for iron in an oxygen sensor (11Goldberg M.A. Dunning S.P. Bunn H.F. Science. 1988; 242: 1412-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar). To find whether nickel can directly substitute for iron in prolyl hydroxylases, 1HAEo– cells were fractionated, and ODD-dependent activity (Pro-564) was tested in the nuclear, mitochondrial, and microsomal fraction. No ODD-dependent activity was found in the nuclear fraction. A high level of ODD-independent activity was observed in the mitochondrial fraction. The ODD-dependent prolyl hydroxylase activity in the microsomal fraction was tested using 0–400 μm ODD substrate (Fig. 1A). 200 μm ODD peptide was selected for reactions in the presence of NiSO4 or CoCl2. Addition of different concentrations of NiSO4 or CoCl2 from 0.05 to 0.5 mm to cell extracts revealed 15–25% inhibition of prolyl hydroxylase activity (Fig. 1B). This inhibition may result from partial substitution of iron in the active center, from a direct interaction of the enzyme with metals, not necessarily at the active center, or from interaction of metals with other components of reaction.It is well established that hydroxylation of Pro-402/564 located in the ODD of HIF-1α is required for HIF-1α interaction with the VHL tumor suppressor protein. To test whether hydroxylation of Pro-402/564 is affected by nickel(II) or cobalt(II) in living cells, we designed a reporter plasmid expressing a protein containing the HIFα ODD fragment fused with luciferase (CMV-Luc-ODD). It was expected that similar to the HIF-1α protein, the half-life of CMV-Luc-ODD reporter protein would depend on the hydroxylation status of Pro-402/564. To test this, we investigated whether CMV-Luc-ODD would undergo the VHL-dependent degradation in a prolyl hydroxylation-dependent manner. The CMV-Luc-ODD reporter was transfected into renal carcinoma 786-0 cells lacking functional VHL and into the same cells that were stably transfected with normal VHL (786-0 wt4 cells). No increase in CMV-Luc-ODD expression was found when the CMV-Luc-ODD plasmidtransfected 786-0 cells were exposed to 0.5 mm NiSO4, 0.25 mm CoCl2, 0.25 mm DFX, or 1 mm DMOG for 20 h (Fig. 2A). In contrast, significant signal induction/reporter stabilization was found in 786-0 cells containing wild type VHL following exposure to the same agents (Fig. 2B). The level of expression of the reporter plasmid in unexposed cells was higher in 786-0 cells with mutated VHL than in cells with normal VHL. These data indicated that the CMV-Luc-ODD reporter protein is normally degraded via the VHL pathway but can be stabilized by exposure to prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors such as DMOG, iron chelator DFX, and metals like nickel(II) or cobalt(II).Fig. 2Expression of CMV-Luc-ODD reporter in VHL mutant and VHL normal cells. The 786-0 renal carcinoma cells with mutant VHL (A) and 786-0 wt4 cells expressing wild type VHL (B) were transiently transfected with CMV-Luc-ODD and with pRL-tk, which was included as a transfection/transcription efficiency control as described under “Experimental Procedures.” 16 h after transfection cells were exposed to metals, the iron chelator DFX, or the prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor DMOG in concentrations indicated on the figure. Relative luciferase activity was detected 20 h after exposure and expressed as -fold increase over control. At least three independent experiments were performed in quadruplicate, and mean values ± S.D. are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Because the inhalation of metal-containing particles is known to induce inflammation and cancer in the lung, we next studied the effect of both metals on Pro-402/564 hydroxylation and HIF-1-dependent transcription in human lung epithelial cells (1HAEo–). It was expected that the VHL-mediated HIFα degradation pathway is functional in these cells and that the CMV-Luc-ODD reporter protein, in a manner similar to HIFα, would be preferentially degraded under normoxic conditions by the proteasome. Indeed, the addition of proteasomal inhibitor lactacystin stabilized the reporter in human 1HAEo– cells, providing evidence that the reporter normally is not accumulated and is indeed degraded by proteasomes in these cells (Fig. 3A). Essentially the same results as obtained in 786-0 wt4 cells were obtained in 1HAEo– cells transfected with CMV-Luc-ODD and exposed for 20 h to nickel(II) or cobalt(II) (Fig. 3, A and C), DFX, or DMOG (not shown). The stabilization of the reporter protein by both nickel(II) and cobalt(II) was dose-dependent starting at 0.1 mm NiSO4 or 0.05 mm CoCl2. The level of signal caused by 0.25 mm NiSO4 was comparable with the signal produced by 0.25 mm CoCl2; at 0.5 mm NiSO4, the signal was almost doubled. It was shown previously that exposure to nickel(II) or cobalt(II) stabilizes HIFα and increases HIF-1-dependent transcription (10Maxwell P. Salnikow K. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2004; 3: 29-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Indeed, transfection of the HRE-Luc reporter showed a dose-dependent induction of HIF-dependent transcription in nickel(II)- and cobalt(II)-exposed 1HAEo– cells (Fig. 3, B and D). These data are in good agreement with those obtained for the CMV-Luc-ODD reporter.Fig. 3Exposure to nickel(II) or cobalt(II) inhibits HIFα degradation and activates HIF-dependent transcription in 1HAEo– cells. Shown is dose-dependent inhibition of CMV-Luc-ODD degradation (inhibition of prolyl hydroxylase activity) by 0.1, 0.25, and 0.5 mm NiSO4 (A) or 0.05, 0.1, and 0.25 mm CoCl2 (C). Also shown is dose-dependent induction of HIF-dependent transcription by 0.1, 0.25, and 0.5 mm NiSO4(B) or 0.05, 0.1, and 0.25 mm CoCl2 (D). 1HAEo– cells were transiently transfected with CMV-Luc-ODD or HRE-Luc and pRL-tk as described under “Experimental Procedures.” 16 h after transfection cells were exposed to NiSO4, CoCl2, FeSO4, or the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin in concentrations indicated on the figure. Relative luciferase activity was measured 20 h after exposure and expressed as -fold increase over control. At least three independent experiments were performed in quadruplicate, and mean values ± S.D. are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Nickel(II)- or Cobalt(II)-induced Hypoxic Stress Is Not Prevented by Iron(II)—Prolyl hydroxylases are iron-containing enzymes. Iron, nickel, and cobalt could be delivered to cells via the divalent metal transporter DMT1 (31Gunshin H. Mackenzie B. Berger U.V. Gunshin Y. Romero M.F. Boron W.F. Nussberger S. Gollan J.L. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1997; 388: 482-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (2631) Google Scholar). To test whether the inhibition of hydroxylation by nickel(II) or cobalt(II) was because of a competitive inhibition of iron uptake, we supplemented the cell culture medium with iron(II). The addition of ferrous iron alone had no effect on the control CMV-Luc-ODD signal. Co-exposure of cells to equal amounts of iron(II) and nickel(II) or cobalt(II) also did not change the signal produced by the non-iron metals alone (Fig. 3, A and C). As it was found for the CMV-Luc-ODD reporter, the addition of iron(II) also had no effect on the expression of the nickel(II)- or cobalt(II)-induced HIF-dependent reporter (Fig. 3, B and D). Finally, using the same conditions, we analyzed the expression of the endogenous hypoxia-inducible NDRG-1/Cap43 gene (22Salnikow K. Blagosklonny M.V. Ryan H. Johnson R. Costa M. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 38-41PubMed Google Scholar) in 1HAEo– cells. We have found that nickel(II) and cobalt(II) strongly induced NDRG-1/Cap43, whereas the simultaneous addition of these metals with ferrous or ferric iron showed no effect on NDRG-1/Cap43 expression (32Salnikow K. Li X. Lippmann M. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2004; 196: 258-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This finding is in full concordance with the results showing a lack of an iron(II) effect on the expression of the Luc reporters.Nickel(II) and Cobalt(II) Deplete Intracellular Ascorbate— Prolyl hydroxylases require both 2OG and ascorbic acid for full activity. Because 2OG is a part of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, we expected that it would be present in cells in sufficient amounts. However, ascorbate, a well known reducing agent and an antioxidant, can be easily exhausted. Determination of intracellular ascorbate levels following exposure of 1HAEo– cells to nickel(II) and cobalt(II) for 20 h showed substantial depletion of intracellular ascorbate (Fig. 4A).Fig. 4Effect of nickel(II) or cobalt(II) on ascorbate metabolism.A, effect of metals on total ascorbate level. 1HAEo– cells were exposed to indicated doses of nickel(II) or cobalt(II) for 20 h. The concentration of intracellular ascorbate was determined using the HPLC method as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The data are presented as mean values ± S.D. Shown is the effect of nickel(II) (B) or cobalt(II) (D) exposure on efflux of 14C-labeled ascorbate. 1HAEo– cells were loaded with labeled ascorbate for 20 h; the medium was changed, and incubation with or without 0.5 mm NiSO4 or 0.25 mm CoCl2 was continued. Samples in triplicate were collected at indicated time points. The data are presented as mean values – S.D. •, 1HAEo– cells cultured alone; ▪, 1HAEo– cells cultured with NiSO4; ▴, 1HAEo– cells cultured with CoCl2. C, time course of the effect of nickel(II) or cobalt(II) exposure on 14C-labeled ascorbate uptake. 1HAEo– cells were incubated with labeled ascorbate for 2, 4, and 20 h alone (•) or in the presence of 0.5 mm NiSO4 (▪) or 0.25 mm CoCl2 (▴). The data are presented as mean values ± S.D. Alternatively, labeled ascorbate was preincubated with 0.5 mm NiSO4 (□) or with 0.25 mm CoCl2 (▵) in complete medium for 4 h prior to the addition to cells. Some error bars are hidden by the symbols.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Effect of Nickel(II) or Cobalt(II) on Ascorbate Uptake and Efflux—The intracellular level of ascorbate is maintained as a balance of uptake and efflux. To understand why exposure to nickel(II) or cobalt(II) depletes intracellular ascorbate, we investigated both uptake and efflux of 14C-labeled ascorbate in the presence of both metals. Fig. 4C shows that the uptake of ascorbate is blocked by nickel or cobalt, whereas the efflux is only slightly affected (Fig. 4, B and D). Compared with that in the control cells, the initial rapid uptake of ascorbate in both nickel(II)- and cobalt(II)-exposed cells came to a halt 2–4 h after the addition of the metals to the cell culture medium. Then, within the next 16–18 h, the cellular [14C]ascorbate decreased gradually to barely detectable levels (Fig. 4C). This time course could be the result of a relatively slow interaction of the metals (or metal complexes) with critical target molecules (ligands) in the medium and/or cells, including ascorbic acid. To test this possibility, [14C]ascorbate in the complete medium was preincubated for 4 h with metals and then added to cells. As expected, much less 14C-labeled ascorbate was found in cells that received"

In sand flies with mature Leishmania infections the anterior midgut is blocked by a gel of parasite origin, the promastigote secretory gel2,3. Here we analyse the inocula from Leishmania mexicana-infected Lutzomyia longipalpis sand flies. Analysis revealed the size of the infectious dose, the underlying mechanism of parasite delivery by regurgitation, and the novel contribution made to infection by filamentous proteophosphoglycan (fPPG), a component of promastigote secretory gel found to accompany the parasites during transmission. Collectively these results have important implications for understanding the relationship between the parasite and its vector, the pathology of cutaneous leishmaniasis in humans and also the development of effective vaccines and drugs. These findings emphasize that to fully understand transmission of vector-borne diseases the interaction between the parasite, its vector and the mammalian host must be considered together."

https://openalex.org/W2040498484,"According to the social intelligence hypothesis, social context represents an important force driving the selection of animal cognitive abilities such as the capacity to estimate the nature of the social relationships between other individuals1,2,3,4. Despite this importance, the influence of this force has been assessed only in primates and never in other animals showing social interactions5,6,7. In this way, avian communication generally takes place in a network of signallers and receivers, which represents an audience altering individual signalling behaviours8,9. Indeed, vocal amplitude10 and repertoire11 are known to be socially regulated and the attitude towards the opposite sex may change depending on the audience8,12,13. This ‘audience effect’8,14,15,16 provides support for the reality of social awareness in some bird species. However no evidence has yet been found to suggest that birds are able to estimate the characteristics of the social relationships between group-mates. Here we show that the male of a gregarious songbird species—the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata)—pays attention to the mating status of conspecific pairs, and uses this information to control its behaviour towards its female partner."
https://openalex.org/W2066383101,"Phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) phosphate (PtdInsP) lipids are used as intracellular signposts for the recruitment and activation of peripheral membrane proteins. Whereas the distribution of most PtdInsPs is restricted to a single organelle, PtdIns(4)P is unique in that it exists in several discrete pools, and so proteins that bind PtdIns(4)P must use extra receptors to achieve a restricted localization. Here we compare the two highly related pleckstrin homology (PH) domains from Osh1p and Osh2p, yeast homologues of oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP), that target membranes using PtdIns(4)P, and in vitro bind both PtdIns(4)P and PtdIns(4,5)P2. We show that Golgi targeting is specified by an additional site on PHOsh1, which lies on a face of the domain not previously known to interact with receptors. In contrast, PHOsh2 does not have a demonstrable second site, and targets multiple pools of PtdInsPs, each dependent on a different PtdIns 4-kinase. This lack of a second site in PHOsh2 allows it to be used as an unbiased reporter for altered distribution of 4-phosphorylated PtdIns. For example, in cells with excess PtdIns(4)P caused by inactivation of the phosphatase Sac1p, PHOsh2 indicates that PtdIns(4)P accumulates on the plasma membrane, whereas other Golgi-targeted PH domains fail to detect this change. Phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) phosphate (PtdInsP) lipids are used as intracellular signposts for the recruitment and activation of peripheral membrane proteins.

Membrane recruitment of peripheral membrane proteins is determined by one or more targeting domains that bind other proteins or membrane lipids. An important class of membrane lipids used to recruit proteins are the PtdInsPs, 1The abbreviations used are: PtdInsP, phosphatidylinositol phosphate; CERT, ceramide transfer protein; OSBP, oxysterol-binding protein; PH, pleckstrin homology; PtdIns, phosphatidylinositol; FAPP1, phosphoinositol 4-phosphate adaptor protein 1; PLCδ1; phospholipase C δ1; GFP, green fluorescent protein; ER, endoplasmic reticulum. phosphates being added at positions 3, 4, or 5 of the inositol sugar in any one of 7 combinations. Most PtdInsPs have quite restricted distributions, and can be considered as intracellular signposts or signals that recruit proteins to specific compartments (1Insall R.H. Weiner O.D. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 743-747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). These distributions are created by the targeting of lipid modifying enzymes. For example, PtdIns(3)P is largely restricted to endosomes: it is synthesized by a PtdIns 3-kinase lying on the trans-Golgi network to the endosome pathway, and it is prevented from reaching other compartments by degradation in the vacuole/lysosome (2Wurmser A.E. Emr S.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4930-4942Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). PtdIns(4)P differs from other PtdInsPs as it performs multiple roles. Not only is it a signpost for protein recruitment, but it is also an essential intermediate in the production of PtdIns(4,5)P2. Furthermore, PtdIns(4)P is synthesized by multiple, separate PtdIns 4-kinases and is therefore likely to have multiple intracellular pools. There are two families of PtdIns 4-kinases: types II and III (type I are now known to be PtdIns 3-kinases (3Whitman M. Downes C.P. Keeler M. Keller T. Cantley L. Nature. 1988; 332: 644-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar)). In mammalian cells, the predominant PtdIns 4-kinases are type II, but have only recently been cloned and are still partially characterized (4Minogue S. Anderson J.S. Waugh M.G. dos Santos M.

J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13236-13241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Analysis of the relative importance of the different kinases in membrane traffic has been carried out in the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which also has type II and III kinases, but with a different emphasis, because here the type III kinases are dominant (9Audhya A. Foti M. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2673-2689Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). The yeast type III α PtdIns 4-kinase homologue, Stt4p, is an essential protein that has been localized to the plasma membrane (10Audhya A. Emr S.D. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 593-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), and has been shown to synthesize the bulk of PtdIns(4)P for cellular requirements. This pool acts as a precursor for PtdIns(4,5)P2 (11Perera N.M. Michell R.H. Dove S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5216-5226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), which is perhaps exclusively on the plasma membrane (12Levine T.P. Munro S. Curr.

Cell. 2002; 13: 542-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), and which is made by a single PtdIns(4)P 5-kinase, Mss4p, that is active on the plasma membrane (14Homma K. Terui S. Minemura M.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4223-4236Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). However, there are important roles for PtdIns(4)P beyond being an intermediate in PtdIns(4,5)P2 production, in particular in budding from the late Golgi. This is the location of Pik1p, another essential PtdIns 4-kinase that is homologous to the human type III β kinase (16Hama H. Schnieders E.A. Thorner J. Takemoto J.Y. DeWald D.B. J. Biol.

Sun H.Q. Martinez M. Sun Y.X. Macia E. Kirchhausen T. Albanesi J.P. Roth M.G. Yin H.L. Cell. 2003; 114: 299-310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Yeast also harbor a third PtdIns 4-kinase, Lsb6p, which is in the type II family, and has no known function (23Han G.S. Audhya A. Markley D.J. Emr S.D. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47709-47718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The question posed by the presence of these different PtdIns 4-kinases is how might proteins detect one specific pool of PtdIns(4)P among the multiple organelles that have active PtdIns 4-kinases? One plausible explanation supported by previous observations with the PH domain of OSBP is that proteins cannot target a specific compartment by virtue of PtdIns(4)P alone, but achieve restricted targeting by binding a membrane lipid in combination with other membrane receptors (12Levine T.P. Munro S. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 695-704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 24Levine T.P. Munro S. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 729-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). OSBP is a peripheral membrane protein that targets the late Golgi solely by virtue of a PH domain that binds to PtdIns(4)P and PtdIns(4,5)P2 with equal affinity (12Levine T.P. Munro S. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 695-704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 18Ridgway N.D. Dawson P.A. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 307-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). In addition, PHOSBP binds a Golgi-restricted receptor dependent on the small GTPase Arf1p (12Levine T.P. Munro S. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 695-704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar), and has recently been shown to bind weakly to ARF1 (21Godi A. Di Campli A. Konstantakopoulos A. Di Tullio G. Alessi D.R. Kular G.S. Daniele T. Marra P. Lucocq J.M. De Matteis M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 393-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Here, we focus on two PH domains from yeast homologues of OSBP: Osh1 and Osh2. Whereas PHOsh1 targets Golgi membranes, PHOsh2, a closely related domain (71% identical and 91% homologous) targets membranes weakly (25Levine T.P. Munro S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1633-1644Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). We have identified the site within PHOsh1 that binds a second membrane receptor, and developed a tool based on PHOsh2 that lacks the second site and so detects pools of 4-phosphorylated PtdIns in an unbiased manner. Using PHOsh2, we demonstrate the physical separation of the two pools of PtdIns(4)P dependent on Stt4p and Pik1p, on the plasma membrane and Golgi, respectively. We then compare PHOsh2 to other PH domains that bind PtdIns(4)P and PtdIns(4,5)P2 as a probe for excess PtdIns(4)P in Δsac1 cells. Plasmids—PH domains were defined as follows (alternative gene names together with accession numbers are given in brackets, followed by starting and ending residues, identified using the three letter amino acid code): Osh1p (YAR042W/YAR044W, AY241177) Glu280-Arg384; Osh2p (YDL019C, NP_010265) long form: Pro256–Pro424; short form: Ser286-Lys391; phospholipase C δ1 (PLCδ1), ceramide transfer protein (CERT, previously called Goodpasture's antigen-binding protein) and phosphoinositol 4-phosphate adaptor protein 1 (FAPP1) as before (12Levine T.P. Munro S. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 695-704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). For chimeras between Osh1p and Osh2p PH domains, 4 restriction sites that do not alter the translated sequence were introduced at roughly equal spacing in both PH domains, to produce 5 segments that shared the same boundary residues in both domains. Plasmids containing PH domains were based on either pRS406 (integrating at URA3) or pRS416 (CEN URA3) and contained the constitutive portion of the PHO5 promoter, followed by GFP, a linker with the Myc epitope (GSMEQKLISEEDLRS), then the PH domain and a carboxyl-terminal extension of XNS (where X is encoded by the last two nucleotides from the source DNA and a guanine) as previously described (12Levine T.P.

Small unilamellar liposomes were prepared, incubated with GFP-PH domain and removed from suspension by centrifugation as described previously (12Levine T.P. Munro S. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 695-704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). The GFP content remaining in the supernatant was measured in a LS50 spectrophotometer (excitation 485 nm, emission 515 nm, slit widths 5 nm). Phosphoinositides were assumed to be equally distributed between the two leaflets of the liposome bilayer. Cell Imaging—GFP-PH domain fusion proteins were visualized in yeast cells growing at mid-log phase (A600 nm = 1) and in COS cells as previously (12Levine T.P. Munro S. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 695-704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 24Levine T.P. Munro S. Curr.

To label yeast with FM4-64, the dye was added at final concentration of 30 μm 15 min prior to imaging endosomal/late Golgi compartments. Identification of the Second Site in PHOsh1 for Golgi Targeting—PHOsh1 targets Golgi membranes in yeast (Fig. 1A) and mammalian fibroblasts (24Levine T.P. Munro S. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 729-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 25Levine T.P. Munro S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1633-1644Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), whereas PHOsh2 shows barely discernible membrane targeting in yeast (Fig. 1B) and fibroblasts (data not shown). This differs from a recent study showing stronger Golgi targeting by monomeric PHOsh2, although in that case a basic patch adjacent to the core PH domain sequence was also included, which may alter targeting (27Nagel W. Schilcher P. Zeitlmann L. Kolanus W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1981-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The portion of primary sequence responsible for the difference in targeting between PHOsh1 and PHOsh2 was mapped using a series of chimeras in which portions of the Osh1p sequence were exchanged for the homologous Osh2p sequence. For this purpose, the PH domain (105 amino acids in Osh1p) was divided into five approximately equal segments, and chimeras were made that contained mixtures of Osh1p and Osh2p sequence (see “Experimental Procedures”). Substitution of the NH2-terminal three-fifths of PHOsh1 with the equivalent region of PHOsh2 had no effect on targeting (Fig. 1C), despite the almost universal location of the binding site in PH domains for PtdInsPs within this NH2-terminal region (28Ferguson K.M.

In contrast, inclusion of the next (i.e. fourth) segment of PHOsh2 inhibited membrane localization (Fig. 1D). The same requirement for the fourth segment of PHOsh1 was seen for Golgi targeting in mammalian COS cell fibroblasts (data not shown). Within the critical fourth segment of 22 residues, PHOsh1 differs from PHOsh2 at 8 positions. By further dissection of this segment, a single residue, histidine at position 79 in PHOsh1 compared with arginine at position 80 in PHOsh2, was shown to be critical for targeting (Table II). To confirm the role of this single residue, arginine was introduced at position 79 of PHOsh1, in which it strongly inhibited Golgi targeting (Fig. 1E). Introduction of histidine at the same site in PHOsh2 induced a striking gain of Golgi targeting (Fig. 1F).Table IIAnalysis of the section of PHOsh1 that determines Golgi targetingConstructPlasmidSequence between residues 61 and 82 of PHOsh1No. changes, cf.

In all known structures, this residue points away from the core of the domain on a side of the molecule at some distance from the membrane interface, assuming that this is defined by the site that binds PtdInsPs (Fig. 2). These results therefore indicate that the second site is unlikely to interact with a membrane lipid receptor, but is more likely to be a protein. PHOsh2 Binds Both PtdIns(4)P and PtdIns(4,5)P2—If PHOsh2 is fully capable of membrane targeting, but just lacks a second site, it should bind PtdInsPs similarly to PHOsh1. To test this, we compared the binding of GFP-tagged PH domains to liposomes containing 2.5% PtdIns(4)P or PtdIns(4,5)P2 (12Levine T.P. Munro S. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 695-704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). As controls, PHPLCδ1 showed its well documented absolute preference for PtdIns(4,5)P2 over PtdIns(4)P, and PHFAPP1 bound to both lipids, with a slight preference for PtdIns(4)P (Fig. 3). PHOsh1 and PHOsh2 bound PtdIns(4,5)P2 with almost identical affinity, greater than that of PHFAPP1 (Fig. 3A); PHOsh1 bound PtdIns(4)P more strongly than PHOsh2 (∼2-fold more) (Fig. 3B). Overall, these experiments show that PHOsh2 binds PtdIns(4)P and PtdIns(4,5)P2 with affinity similar to other PH domains that target membranes efficiently, despite its very weak membrane targeting in vivo. A PHOsh2 Dimer Targets Two Pools of 4-Phosphorylated PtdInsPs in Growing Cells—The above data show that PHOsh2 binds 4-phosphorylated PtdIns, but it differs from closely related PH domains by the absence of a second site. Therefore, we reasoned that if a reporter construct could be made to target membranes dependent purely on PHOsh2, it would reveal the overall distribution of PtdIns(4)P and PtdIns(4,5)P2. To achieve membrane localization, we expressed a tandem dimer of PHOsh2, as has been done for PHPLCδ1 and FYVE domains previously. The presence of two membrane binding sites vastly increases avidity without altering specificity (12Levine T.P. Munro S. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 695-704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 30Gillooly D.J. Morrow I.C. Lindsay M. Gould R. Bryant N.J. Gaullier J.M. Parton R.G. Stenmark H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4577-4588Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). GFP-PHOsh2-dimer showed tight dual localization to punctate internal structures and the plasma membrane, with little cytoplasmic background (Fig. 4A). GFP-PHOsh2-dimer expressed from either a relatively weak promoter (OSH1), or a rapidly inducible promoter (GAL1) produced the same dual localization (data not shown), indicating that it is independent of duration and level of expression. Although the distribution of GFP-PHOsh2-dimer became diffuse after fixation (data not shown), partial co-localization was found in live cells with punctae stained by FM4-64, which traverses the endocytic pathway and also enters late Golgi compartments prior to being sorted back to the cell surface (Fig. 4B) (31Wiederkehr A. Avaro S. Prescianotto-Baschong C. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. Riezman H. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 397-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Therefore, we conclude that the punctate structures are late Golgi and/or early endosomes. In addition, the dual targeting of PHOsh2 implies either that it interacts with two different ligands, or alternatively that a single ligand is present in two sites. An indication that both localizations of GFP-PHOsh2-dimer are PtdInsP-dependent was gained using a dimer in which two conserved positive residues of both PH domain sequences contained mutations that are known to prevent the PtdInsP binding site of the PH domains (12Levine T.P. Munro S. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 695-704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar), which had an entirely diffuse localization (Fig. 4C). To test whether Pik1p plays a role in the localization of PHOsh2, as it does for PHOSBP (12Levine T.P. Munro S. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 695-704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar), GFP-PHOsh2 dimer was expressed in a strain carrying a conditional pik1 allele. Shift to the non-permissive temperature caused a rapid and almost complete loss of internal punctate localization in the mutant cells, with only a slight effect seen in wild-type cells undergoing the same temperature shift (Fig. 5A). By comparison, PHOSBP is only incompletely delocalized under these conditions (12Levine T.P. Munro S. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 695-704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Therefore, PtdIns(4)P produced by Pik1p is likely to be the Golgi ligand for PHOsh2. Next, we sought to identify the plasma membrane ligand for PHOsh2. Initially we looked at the role of PtdIns(4,5)P2 by expressing GFP-PHOsh2 dimer in cells carrying the mss4-2ts allele. Little effect on the plasma membrane localization was detected at the non-permissive temperature under conditions where PtdIns(4,5)P2 levels are known to fall (Fig. 5B) (12Levine T.P. Munro S. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 695-704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). This result does not rule out a role for PtdIns(4,5)P2 at the plasma membrane, but indicates that there must be an additional ligand present when PtdIns(4,5)P2 production is blocked. We next tested whether the other essential PtdIns(4)-kinase, Stt4p, was responsible for synthesizing a pool of PtdInsP on the plasma membrane that is recognized by PHOsh2. In temperature-sensitive strains carrying the mutant allele stt4-4ts, the localization of the PHOsh2 dimer was altered, with much reduced plasma membrane localization even at the permissive temperature (data not shown). Plasma membrane targeting was almost completely lost at the non-permissive temperature, whereas punctate localization was preserved (Fig. 5C), and these effects were not seen in wild-type controls (Fig. 5C), indicating that Stt4p synthesizes the 4-phosphorylated PtdIns that PHOsh2 binds on the plasma membrane. We also examined the role of the single PtdIns 3-kinase in yeast, VPS34, because it is possible that PHOsh2 binds either PtdIns(3)P or PtdIns(3,5)P2. However, localization of the GFP-PHOsh2 dimer was unaffected in Δvps34 cells (data not shown). The combination of this result and the complete loss of punctate localization with the pik1 mutation indicates that the punctate localization of PHOsh2 is not mediated by PtdIns(3)P. Overall, these results show that each of the dual localizations of this PH domain is sensitive to inactivation of a different essential PtdIns 4-kinase, demonstrating that PHOsh2 interacts with two separate pools of 4-phosphorylated PtdIns. PHOsh2 as a Reporter for Altered PtdIns(4)P Levels in Δsac1 Cells—The results above indicate that PHOsh2 is an unbiased reporter of PtdIns(4)P and PtdIns(4,5)P2, so we next examined how its distribution was affected by a well characterized mutation that alters PtdInsP levels. Sac1p is one of five PtdInsP phosphatases in yeast, and its inactivation leads to a large increase in cellular PtdIns(4)P, up to 10-fold, together with a fall in PtdIns(4,5)P2 (16Hama H. Schnieders E.A. Thorner J. Takemoto J.Y. DeWald D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34294-34300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 32Foti M. Audhya A. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2396-2411Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). To determine the effect of these changes in 4-phospholrylated PtdIns, we expressed tagged PH domains in a Δsac1 strain. The GFP-PHOsh2 dimer showed much increased plasma membrane targeting, and an apparent decrease in punctate localization (Fig. 6A, compare with Fig. 4A). This change might be caused by either a reduction in ligand concentration on Golgi/endosomes or an increase in ligand on the plasma membrane. To distinguish between these possibilities, we expressed monomeric GFP-PHOsh2 in the Δsac1 strain, and found that a single copy of PHOsh2 now localized appreciably to the plasma membrane (Fig. 6B, compare with Fig. 1B). This result indicates that the Δsac1 mutation leads to an increase in PtdIns(4)P at the plasma membrane, which is likely, from the results above, to be synthesized by Stt4p. Therefore, our findings agree with previous results that the excess PtdIns(4)P that accumulates in Δsac1 cells is synthesized by Stt4p rather than by Pik1p (32Foti M. Audhya A. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2396-2411Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). We next examined the effect of the Δsac1 mutation on other PH domains that bind PtdIns(4)P. GFP-PHOsh1 did not target the enlarged pool of PtdIns(4)P at the plasma membrane, but remained largely punctate (Fig. 6C). This is further evidence that PHOsh1 does not target memb"

It has been hypothesized to play a central role in cancer progression and resistance to therapy in diverse tumor types. Although some of the transcriptional processes regulating its expression have been established, the diversity of genes that may be controlling the levels of its expression in both normal cells as well as in cancer cells has not been fully explored. The most common genetically mutated pathways in human malignancies are the p53 tumor suppressor pathway and the RB/E2F pathway. Both of these pathways, when intact, provide essential checkpoints in the maintenance of normal cell growth and protect the cell from DNA damage. Using non-transformed embryonic fibroblasts, we provide evidence of a molecular link between the regulation of survivin transcription and the RB/E2F family of proteins. We demonstrate that both pRB and p130 can interact with the survivin promoter and can repress survivin transcription. We also show that the E2F activators (E2F1, E2F2, and E2F3) can bind to the survivin promoter and induce survivin transcription. Genetically modified cells that harbor deletions in various members of the RB/E2F family confirm our data from the wild-type cells. Our findings implicate several members of the RB/E2F pathway in an intricate mechanism of survivin gene regulation that, when genetically altered during the process of tumorigenesis, may function within cancer cells to aberrantly alter survivin levels and enhance tumor progression.

J. 1999; 344: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Mutation within the CDEs abolishes the cell cycle specificity of survivin expression.Survivin is highly expressed in a variety of transformed cell lines, including human cancers of the lung, colon, pancreas, breast, brain, and bone marrow (for review, see Ref. 8Altieri D.C. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8581-8589Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar). High levels of expression within cancer cells correlate with an adverse clinical outcome (8Altieri D.C. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8581-8589Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar). Data from an in vivo tumor model support a mechanism whereby its targeted disruption specifically eliminates tumor cells by a proapoptotic mechanism (9Mesri M. Wall N.R. Li J. Kim R.W. Altieri D.C. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 981-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Survivin also plays a critical role in normal development, as genetic disruption is lethal early in the embryo (65). Postnatally, survivin is expressed in a few select tissues, including bone marrow stem cells, vascular endothelial cells, colonic epithelium, and the ependyma and choroid plexus of the brain (10Altura R.A.

The pattern of survivin expression suggests that it plays a critical role in the maintenance of actively dividing cells and tissues.The RB/E2F pathway plays an essential role in cell cycle regulation and maintenance of cellular homeostasis (14Sherr C.J. McCormick F. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 103-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar, 15Classon M. Harlow E. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 910-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). Mutations in genes within this pathway are found at high rates in almost all types of cancer, attesting to their importance in cell growth control (15Classon M. Harlow E. Nat. Rev.

RB and its structurally and functionally related family members, p107 and p130, have similar properties of binding to the E2F family members and of inhibiting cell cycle progression when ectopically expressed (17Sage J. Mulligan G.J. Attardi L.D. Miller A. Chen S. Williams B. Theodorou E. Jacks T. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 3037-3050Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). The E2F family of proteins includes both the transcriptional activators (E2F1, E2F2, and E2F3) and the repressors (E2F4 and E2F5) (18Trimarchi J.M. Lees J.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar). These proteins bind to specific promoter regions within diverse gene targets. The interaction of RB with the E2F activators normally results in an inhibition of E2F-mediated transactivation and a cell growth arrest at the G1 phase of the cell cycle (19Chellappan S.P.

Nature. 1991; 351: 494-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). RB family mutants that lack the ability to cause growth arrest also lack the ability to bind E2F and inhibit E2F-dependent transcription. Such mutants have been isolated from many different human tumors (22Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4295) Google Scholar, 23Paggi M.G. Baldi A. Bonetto F. Giordano A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 62: 418-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The viral oncoprotein E1A also binds and sequesters the RB family members, resulting in the release of E2F transcriptional activity, induction of DNA synthesis, and transformation of mammalian cells (24Nevins J.R. Science. 1992; 258: 424-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (1364) Google Scholar, 25Samuelson A.V. Lowe S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Overexpression of E2F1, E2F2, and E2F3 can induce entry into the cell cycle and can lead to transformation of primary cells (27Wu L. Timmers C. Maiti B. Saavedra H.I. Sang L. Chong G.T. Nuckolls F.

Deregulated E2F transcriptional activity can also trigger apoptosis through p53-dependent and -independent pathways, although the individual mechanisms and E2F species that play the major role in these processes have not been identified (18Trimarchi J.M. Lees J.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar).Our data, in wild-type cells and in cells that have been genetically modified to delete pRb, the E2Fs, and p53, suggests that survivin and the RB/E2F proteins interact via a mechanism that involves multiple RB/E2F members acting as repressors and activators of survivin transcription. We hypothesize that disruption of upstream elements within the RB pathway such as the deletion of RB, the amplification of CDK4, or the deletion of p16INK4A, perhaps in the early stages of tumorigenesis, may result in the deregulation of survivin, leading to chromosomal instability and an accumulation of mutations that confer resistance to therapy.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCells and Culture Conditions—Primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) harboring genetic deletions of the E2F activators (E2F1, E2F2, and E2F3), as well as pRB and p53, were derived from day 13.5 embryos after breeding mice harboring these genotypes (28de Bruin A. Wu L. Saavedra H.I. Wilson P. Yang Y. Rosol T.J. Weinstein M. Robinson M.L. Leone G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6546-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). These MEFs were designated as follows: 1, p53f/f; 2, pRbf/f; 3, p53f/fE2F1–/–2–/–3f/f; 4, pRbf/fE2F1–/–2–/–3f/f; and 5, E2F3f/f, with f/f indicating an allele derived by insertion of loxP sites around exons of the gene of interest. To delete the genes containing loxP sites in vitro, MEF cells were transduced with a retroviral construct capable of expressing Cre recombinase, an enzyme that recognizes loxP sites within the genome and renders the cell incapable of transcribing these genes from either allele. In vitro experiments were performed on early passage (P2–3) primary MEFs grown in RPMI with 2 mm glutamine and 10% FBS. Rat embryonic fibroblast (REF) and MEF immortalized cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen, 11965) with 2 mm glutamine and 10% FBS. Early passage (P16–P20) human embryo fibroblasts (WI-38) were maintained in Eagle's minimal essential medium (EMEM) (Cambrex Bio Science Walkersville, Inc.) with 2 mm glutamine and 10% FBS. All cells were maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2. For cell growth arrest experiments, cells were plated at low density (40–50% confluence) in complete medium, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and then placed in medium containing 0.25% serum for 48–72 h. For cell cycle stimulation experiments, cells were growthrrested by serum starvation (0.25% serum) and then restimulated with 15% serum.Construction of Plasmids—PGL-3 (Promega) vectors containing a luciferase reporter gene and wild-type or mutant survivin promoter sequence (survivin-Luc) (Fig. 1) were kindly provided by the laboratory of Dr. Takeshi Tokuhisa (Department of Developmental Genetics, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan) (6Otaki M. Hatano M. Kobayashi K. Ogasawara T. Kuriyama T. Tokuhisa T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1493: 188-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Retroviral vectors (pBabe-Hygro) containing cDNAs of wild-type E1A and the RB-binding mutant of E1A (124,135A) were kindly provided by the laboratory of Dr. Amati (29Alevizopoulos K. Sanchez B. Amati B. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2067-2074Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). E1A vectors were subcloned into a mammalian expression vector (pcDNA3.1) for use in luciferase reporter assays.Retroviral and Adenoviral Experiments—Retroviral expression constructs containing E1A cDNAs and empty vector (pBH and pBP) controls were transfected into ecotropic phoenix cells as described previously (30DeGregori J. Leone G. Miron A. Jakoi L. Nevins J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7245-7250Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Culture supernatants containing retroviruses were harvested at 48 h after transfection and used to transduce proliferating REF and MEF cells. Cells were infected two or three times with viral supernatant in the presence of 4 μg/ml polybrene, selected with 2.5 μg/ml puromycin or 150 mg/ml hygromycin for 2–3 days, and harvested as described previously (31Leone G. DeGregori J. Yan Z. Jakoi L. Ishida S. Williams R.S. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2120-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). For adenoviral infection experiments, REF and MEF cells plated on 150-mm2 tissue culture dishes were infected with adenoviral vectors expressing E1A or E2F1 or with a control virus at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 500 colony-forming units in 4 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 1.5 h. Cells were harvested 27 h later.Cell Cycle Analysis—Propidium iodide staining of WI-38 cells was performed as described previously (31Leone G. DeGregori J. Yan Z. Jakoi L. Ishida S. Williams R.S. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2120-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Stained cells were subjected to fluorescence-activated cell sorting based on their ability to absorb propidium iodide. Fluorescence was measured with a Coulter EPICS XL flow cytometer.Promoter Transfection Experiments—Proliferating REF cells were transfected with either wild-type or mutant survivin-Luc reporter vectors and E2F or E1A expression constructs as indicated (13Conway E.M. Zwerts F. Van Eygen V. DeVriese A. Nagai N. Luo W. Collen D. Am. J. Pathol. 2003; 163: 935-946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). 2 μg of reporter DNA and 0, 1, or 3 μg of expression construct were incubated in 500 μl of 250 μm CaCl2 together with carrier DNA (pcDNA3.1 empty vector) and pBSK+ to a total of 8 μg of DNA transfected/60-mm2 dish. DNA/CaCl2 solutions were added dropwise to 500 μl of a bubbled solution of 2× Hepes-buffered saline (1% Hepes, 1.6% NaCl, 0.074% KCl, 0.025% Na2HPO4, 2% dextrose, pH 7.05) and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. 300 μl of this solution was added dropwise to one of three 60-mm2 dishes of REF cells. CMV-β-galactosidase expression vectors were also included in the transfections (0.7 μg/transfection) to control for transfection efficiency as described previously (32Sears R. Ohtani K. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5227-5235Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Cells were brought to quiescence by serum starvation 14–18 h after transfection and then harvested by scraping from the dishes 36 h after serum deprivation. Luciferase and β-galactosidase assays were performed, and luciferase activity was standardized relative to β-galactosidase activity.Northern Blot Analyses—Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from 150 μgof total RNA, subjected to denaturing agarose electrophoresis, and transferred to a nylon membrane (GeneScreen Plus, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Blots were hybridized with a 32P-labeled riboprobe of murine survivin or GAPDH. Signals were quantitated by phosphorImaging (31Leone G. DeGregori J. Yan Z. Jakoi L. Ishida S. Williams R.S. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2120-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar).Western Blot Analyses—50 μg of protein was separated by electrophoresis on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) using a Bio-Rad semidry transfer cell. The membrane was blocked in 20 mm Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.6) with 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) containing 2% (w/v) blocking powder at 4 °C overnight. The membrane was incubated with primary antibody at a 1:5000 dilution (survivin, FL-142, or D-8, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for 1 h at room temperature, washed, and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibody at a 1:5000 dilution (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After TBST washes, the blot was incubated in detection reagent (ECL™ Advance Western blotting detection kit) and exposed to a Hyperfilm™ ECL™ film (Amersham Biosciences). β-Actin served as an internal control and was detected with mouse monoclonal anti-β-actin antibody (Sigma).Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—This procedure was modified from a protocol obtained from the laboratory of Dr. Peggy Farnham (33Weinmann A.S. Bartley S.M. Zhang T. Zhang M.Q. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6820-6832Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). WI-38 cells were serum-starved in EMEM with 2 mm glutamine and 0.2% FBS for 72 h followed by induction into the cell cycle with 15% FBS. Formaldehyde (final concentration, 1%) was added either at h 0 (72 h after addition of low serum) or 20 h after readdition of 15% serum. Plates were incubated at room temperature for 10 min, and reactions were terminated by addition of glycine (final concentration, 0.125 m). Cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, harvested by scraping, and placed in hypotonic buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) at 4 °C for 10 min. Cells were then harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in hypotonic buffer, and lysed with a Dounce homogenizer to release nuclei. Nuclei were collected by centrifugation, then resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) in the presence of protease inhibitors, and incubated on ice for 30 min. Lysates were passed through a 21-gauge needle and then sonicated with a high intensity ultrasonic processor (Cole Parmer). After centrifugation, the soluble chromatin was diluted 1:10 in ChIP buffer (1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), precleared with protein A-agarose, and collected by centrifugation. Each tube was incubated with 5 μg of antibody (E2F1 (C-20), E2F3 (N-20), E2F4 (A-20), E2F5 (E-19), p130 (C-20), p107 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or pRB (Pharmingen)) at 4 °C overnight with agitation. Controls included no antibody and rabbit Ig. After incubation, pre-blocked protein A-agarose was added to each tube, and the mixture was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The immune complex-bound agarose beads were collected by centrifugation and washed sequentially. DNA was eluted with 1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3 and treated with RNase A. To reverse the cross-links, 5 m NaCl was added, and the samples were incubated at 65 °C. The original, non-antibody-treated chromatin was used as total input for a positive control for the PCR reaction and treated similarly. The DNA was precipitated, purified, and assayed by real time quantitative PCR. The position and sequence of human primers used to amplify ChIP-enriched DNA spanning the E2F-like binding site were –137 to –117, 5′-AGC CCC TTC TGG TCC TAA CTT-3′, and +48 to +71, 5′-CCG GCC TAA CTC CTT TTC ACT TCT-3′. The E2F-like binding site and the survivin transcription start site were identified based on a previously published report (34Hoffman W.H. Biade S. Zilfou J.T. Chen J. Murphy M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3247-3257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). Reactions were performed in triplicate for each sample, and results were compared with total input DNA as the reference using the 2–ΔΔCT calculation method (35, Applied Biosystems (2002) Applied Biosystems User Bulletin #2, Foster City, CAGoogle Scholar). Results were obtained at h 0 and at 20 h after the addition of serum. For E2F1 and E2F3, zero-h results were used as the calibrator. For E2F4, E2F5, p130, and pRB, results at 20 h were used as the calibrator.Real Time PCR—Primers to detect mouse survivin were designed according to the Applied Biosystems Primer Express software using the standardized reaction parameters used by the software to quantify relative cDNA expression levels (mouse survivin: forward, ATC CAC TGC CCT ACC GAG AA, and reverse, CTT GGC TCT CTG TCT GTC CAG TT). A SYBR® Green kit (ABI) was used to quantitate mouse survivin RNA levels. GAPDH was used as the internal control (reference). TaqMan analysis was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions by using an Applied Biosystems 7700 sequence detection system. Experiments were performed in triplicate, and standard deviations were based on the average of three experiments. Values were calculated using the 2–ΔΔCT method (35, Applied Biosystems (2002) Applied Biosystems User Bulletin #2, Foster City, CAGoogle Scholar) with the calibrator assigned as that value obtained after the addition of Cre (p53f/fE2F1–/–2–/–3f/f, pRbf/fE2F1–/–2–/–3f/f, and E2F3f/f) or in the absence of Cre (p53f/f and pRbf/f).RESULTSCell Cycle-dependent Expression of Survivin Is E2F-dependent—To validate the use of non-transformed human embryonic fibroblasts as a model for our studies, we first confirmed the cell cycle dependence of survivin expression in these cells. Early passage human fibroblasts (WI-38) were grown to 50% confluence in EMEM, 10% FBS and then serum-deprived by replacing the medium with EMEM, 0.2% serum for 72 h. Cells were then restimulated with 15% FBS and harvested for protein at various time points (Fig. 2A). Although little or no survivin expression could be detected in G1-arrested cells (Fig. 2A, time 0), expression increased dramatically as cells entered the cell cycle (late G1/S phase), with maximal levels detected at 30 h after serum restimulation. At this time, the majority of cells were in G2/M phase, as indicated by flow cytometry analysis of cells plated in parallel (Fig. 2B). These experiments confirmed the cell cycle-dependent expression pattern of survivin in WI-38 cells, reported previously in other cell types.Fig. 2Expression of survivin is cell-cycle dependent in non-transformed fibroblasts.A, Western blot analysis of survivin protein in human embryonic fibroblasts shows maximal induction in G2/M phase. Proliferating WI-38 cells were synchronized in G2 phase by serum starvation for 72 h. 15% serum was readded to the medium, and cells were harvested for protein at the times indicated. Protein blots were probed with a polyclonal antisurvivin antibody and a β-actin control antibody. B, cell cycle analysis of WI-38 cells at various time points before and after readdition of serum. WI-38 cells were synchronized in G1 phase, as described in A, and then harvested for cell cycle analysis at several time points after readdition of 15% serum. A cell cycle analysis program (Cylchred) was used to determine the exact number of cells in the different phases of the cell cycle. C, the CDE/CHR element containing the E2F-like site of mouse survivin is responsive to changes in the cell cycle. A luciferase reporter vector containing a 400-bp region of the mouse survivin promoter harboring either a wild-type (wt) CDE/CHR element and E2F-like site or a 2-bp mutant (mt) (diagrammed in Fig. 1) within this site was transfected into proliferating REF cells. Cells were brought to quiescence by serum starvation and then restimulated by addition of 15% FBS. Cells were harvested and assayed for luciferase activity at time points indicated below the graphs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine whether the cell cycle-dependent expression of survivin described above was mediated via transcriptional mechanisms, non-transformed fibroblasts were transfected with luciferase reporter constructs driven by a 400-bp fragment of the survivin promoter capable of responding to mitogenic signals through the CDE/CHR element (see Fig. 1) (6Otaki M. Hatano M. Kobayashi K. Ogasawara T. Kuriyama T. Tokuhisa T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1493: 188-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These cells were synchronized by serum deprivation as described above and harvested at various time points following serum stimulation. Although very low levels of luciferase activity could be measured in quiescent cells (time 0), stimulation into the cell cycle by serum addition led to a marked increase in reporter activity (∼10-fold increase, Fig. 2C). By contrast, similar experiments using a mutant promoter containing a 2-bp mutation within the CDE/CHR element (diagrammed in Fig. 1) resulted in a significant increase in reporter activity in quiescent cells. There was no further increase in luciferase activity observed after the readdition of serum (Fig. 2C). These results, consistent with those reported in other cell systems (6Otaki M. Hatano M. Kobayashi K. Ogasawara T. Kuriyama T. Tokuhisa T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1493: 188-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), suggest that in non-transformed quiescent cells transcriptional regulation of survivin occurs through active repression that requires an intact CDE/CHR regulatory region. Derepression of these promoter elements is sufficient to maximally induce its expression during entry into the cell cycle.Considering that E2F is a major RB-regulated protein important for the expression of many cell cycle-regulated genes, we utilized an adenoviral vector to overexpress E2F1 to assess its role in the control of survivin expression. Overexpression of E2F1 in quiescent REF cells resulted in an induction of survivin expression (∼30-fold) (Fig. 3A). To examine the possibility of a direct transcriptional effect of the E2F proteins on the survivin promoter, the ability of various E2F family members to activate a wild-type or mutant survivin reporter construct was evaluated in these cells. Transfection of increasing amounts of E2F1, E2F2, and E2F3a expression vectors led to a dose-dependent increase in wild-type survivin reporter activity that was 3–20-fold above basal levels (Fig. 3B). This activation was dependent on an intact CDE/CHR DNA element because survivin reporter constructs disrupted at this site were unresponsive to E2F overexpression (Fig. 3C). Moreover, DNA-binding mutants of E2F1 (E2F1E132) and E2F3a (E2F3aE132) were incapable of inducing survivin reporter activity (Fig. 3B), suggesting that E2F-mediated regulation of survivin expression requires direct contact of the E2F transactivation domain with the CDE/CHR element on the survivin promoter. Interestingly, E2F1-overexpressing REF cells eventually undergo apoptosis despite deregulated expression of survivin (36Hallstrom T.C. Nevins J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10848-10853Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Presumably, proapoptotic signals induced by E2F1 override the potential antiapoptotic effects reported previously for survivin.Fig. 3Expression of survivin is E2F-dependent.A, E2F induces survivin transcription. REF cells were arrested in G1 by serum starvation. Cells were transduced with adenoviral vectors containing either E2F1 or an empty vector control. RNA blots were hybridized with mouse survivin and mouse GAPDH riboprobes. B, the E2F activators induce survivin transcription through the E2F transactivation domain. REF cells were transfected with a wild-type survivin promoter construct, E2F1, E2F2, or E2F3a expression vectors or empty vector control (Con) and a β-galactosidase expression vector. Cells were brought to quiescence and then harvested 36 h after serum deprivation. To determine the requirement for the E"
https://openalex.org/W2155088613,"Human sperm chemotaxis is a critical component of the fertilization process, but the molecular basis for this behavior remains unclear. Recent evidence shows that chemotactic responses depend on activation of the sperm olfactory receptor, hOR17-4. Certain floral scents, including bourgeonal, activate hOR17-4, trigger pronounced Ca2+ fluxes, and evoke chemotaxis. Here, we provide evidence that hOR17-4 activation is coupled to a cAMP-mediated signaling cascade. Multidimensional protein identification technology was used to identify potential components of a G-protein-coupled cAMP transduction pathway in human sperm. These products included various membrane-associated adenylate cyclase (mAC) isoforms and the Golf-subunit. Using immunocytochemistry, specific mAC isoforms were localized to particular cell regions. Whereas mAC III occurred in the sperm head and midpiece, mAC VIII was distributed predominantly in the flagellum. In contrast, Golf was found mostly in the flagellum and midpiece. The observed spatial distribution patterns largely correspond to the spatiotemporal character of hOR17-4-induced Ca2+ changes. Behavioral and Ca2+ signaling responses of human sperm to bourgeonal were bioassayed in the presence, or absence, of the adenylate cyclase antagonist SQ22536. This specific agent inhibits particulate AC, but not soluble AC, activation. Upon incubation with SQ22536, cells ceased to exhibit Ca2+ signaling, chemotaxis, and hyperactivation (faster swim speed and flagellar beat rate) in response to bourgeonal. Particulate AC is therefore required for induction of hOR17-4-mediated human sperm behavior and represents a promising target for future design of contraceptive drugs.

Despite a century of research, fertilization remains one of the least understood fundamental biological processes (1Vacquier V.D. Science. 1998; 281: 1995-1998Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Chemical communication between sperm and egg is critical in sexual reproduction, yet the contribution of soluble egg factors is still unclear. Sperm activation and chemotaxis have been demonstrated in marine broadcast spawners, as well as in terrestrial animals (including humans) with internal fertilization (2Miller R.L. Metz C.B. Monroy A.

Chemically mediated behavior thus is a key component of sperm-egg dynamics, in environments ranging from the turbulent ocean to the relatively benign mammalian reproductive tract. Olfactory receptor proteins (ORs), 1The abbreviations used are: OR, odorant receptor; AC, adenylate cyclase; mAC, membrane-bound adenylate cyclase; sAC, soluble adenylate cyclase; MudPIT, multidimensional protein identification technology; CAVMA, computer-assisted video motion analysis; ACN, acetonitrile; LC, liquid chromatography; MS, mass spectrometry; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; HTF, human tubal fluid. classic G-protein-coupled receptors, comprise the largest gene family in the human genome (7Buck L.B. Axel R. Cell. 1991; 65: 175-187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3695) Google Scholar). They are usually, but not always, expressed in the ciliary compartments of nasal olfactory sensory neurons and are coupled to complex signal transduction pathways. Activation of these pathways leads to stimulation of mAC III and finally an increase in intracellular Ca2+ and Na+ concentrations inducing membrane depolarization (8Firestein S. Nature. 2001; 413: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). Interestingly, several ORs are expressed predominantly or exclusively in human sperm cells (9Parmentier M. Libert F. Schurmans S. Schiffmann S. Lefort A. Eggerickx D. Ledent C. Mollereau C. Gerard C. Perret J. Grootegoed A. Vassart G.

Genomics. 1997; 39: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). We recently reported chemotaxis by human sperm in response to floral scents (e.g. bourgeonal). The Ca2+ influx mediated by bourgeonal binding to an identified receptor protein (hOR17-4) modified flagellar beating, thus directing cell motility (12Spehr M. Gisselmann G. Poplawski A. Riffell J.A. Wetzel C.H. Zimmer R.K. Hatt H. Science. 2003; 299: 2054-2058Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). Unresolved, however, is the mechanistic basis for the transduction events that lead from odor signals to swimming responses. In sperm, hOR17-4-mediated changes in both intracellular Ca2+ and swimming behavior appear to depend on a cAMP-regulated pathway (12Spehr M. Gisselmann G. Poplawski A. Riffell J.A. Wetzel C.H. Zimmer R.K. Hatt H. Science. 2003; 299: 2054-2058Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). However, the identities and properties of the AC(s) involved in mammalian, especially human, spermatozoa are still debated. All nine mAC isoforms identified in somatic mammalian cells convert the cellular energy carrier ATP into the second messenger cAMP using a specific adenosine binding site (P-site) at the heterodimeric active center of the enzyme. Alternatively, an unconventional soluble adenylate cyclase (sAC), identified in sperm of some mammals (13Chen Y. Cann M.J. Litvin T.N. Iourgenko V. Sinclair M.L. Levin L.R. Buck J. Science. 2000; 289: 625-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar), shows a decidedly divergent catalytic domain (14Wuttke M.S. Buck J. Levin L.R. J. Pancreas. 2001; 2: 154-158PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, there is evidence for both a G-protein-activated mAC(s) in mouse sperm (15Leclerc P. Kopf G.S. Biol. Reprod. 1995; 52: 1227-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 16Leclerc P. Kopf G.S. J. Androl. 1999; 20: 126-134PubMed Google Scholar, 17Baxendale R.W. Fraser L.R. Mol. Reprod.

This bicarbonate and Ca2+-activated sAC is structurally related to prokaryotic cyclases but is insensitive to G-proteins or P-site ligands. The goal of this study was to determine the molecular mechanisms that couple OR activation to changes in human sperm swimming behavior. Specifically, we analyzed the expression, spatial distribution, and involvement in cellular and behavioral function of distinct signaling proteins (hOR17-4, G-proteins, and mACs). These studies indicate that, similar to nasal sensory neurons, activation of mAC(s) plays a key role in sperm OR-dependent signaling processes. Specifically, our results implicate mAC(s), rather than sAC, as a molecular link between OR activation and sperm behaviors such as chemotaxis (directed movement with respect to a chemical gradient), swimming (elevated speed), and asymmetric flagellar beating (hyperactivation). Sperm Preparation—Human sperm were freshly obtained from young healthy donors. For Ca2+ imaging, acrosome reaction assays, and immunocytochemistry a Percoll density gradient centrifugation was performed after liquefaction (30 min at 35.5 °C) to isolate mature and motile sperm (20Naaby-Hansen S. Flickinger C.J. Herr J.C. Biol. Reprod. 1997; 56: 771-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In brief, liquefied semen was overlaid on a two-layer Percoll (Amersham Biosciences) density gradient consisting of 80 and 55% isotonic Percoll in Ham's F-10 medium (Invitrogen). After 40-min centrifugation at 500 × g at room temperature the pellet was collected, washed in standard Ringer solution (140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Hepes, 10 mm glucose), and again centrifuged for 15 min. For MudPIT protein expression analysis, pooled human semen samples were snap-frozen by quenching in liquid N2 and stored at -70 °C until required. 50 ml of pooled ejaculate was thawed on ice, and all subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C unless otherwise stated. Spermatozoa were enriched as described above and resuspended in standard Ringer's solution with protease inhibitors (Roche Complete® protease inhibitor mixture). Cells were lysed by homogenization (Ultraturax; 1200 units/min for 1 min) and subsequent sonification for 10 s at 40 watts (Sonifier B12, Branson Sonic Power Co.). Cell debris and nuclei were removed by centrifugation (1,000 × g, 10 min), the pellet was discarded, and the supernatant was centrifuged for 2 h at 100,000 × g. The resultant membrane pellet was solubilized using 1% (w/v) l-α-lysophosphatidylcholine (Sigma); protein concentration was determined by using the Bradford microassay (Bio-Rad). For bioassays frozen sperm of healthy donors was obtained from California Cryobank (Los Angeles, CA) and prepared according to World Health Organization guidelines (21Organization World Health Laboratory Methods for the Examination of Human Serum and Semen-Cervical Mucus Interaction.

Expression Analysis via MudPIT, SDS-PAGE, and In-gel Digestion—A sample aliquot (100 μg) in Laemmli buffer (30% glycerol, 3% SDS, 125 mm Tris/Cl, pH 6.8) was resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE. Coomassie-stained bands were excised, pooled, and washed thrice in 100 mm NH4HCO3 (pH 8.5) in 50% acetonitrile (ACN) for 20 min. Colorless gel pieces were washed in 100% ACN for 10 min and dried by vacuum centrifugation for 15 min at room temperature. Gel pieces were reduced with 20 mm dithiothreitol in 100 mm NH4HCO3, 5% acetonitrile for 1 h at 55 °C, washed (100 mm NH4HCO3 for 10 min), dehydrated (100% ACN 20 min), and alkylated (100 mm iodoacetamide/100 mm NH4HCO3 for 30 min (dark/room temperature). After further washing, dehydration, and drying, the pieces were rehydrated in digestion buffer (40 mm ammonium bicarbonate/9% ACN containing proteomics grade trypsin (Sigma) at an enzyme:substrate ratio of 1:50) and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Peptides were extracted using 1% trifluoroacetic acid in 50% acetonitrile for 20 min. The gel pieces were vortexed for 5 min before recovering the supernatant. The extracted peptides were concentrated by vacuum centrifugation and subjected to LC/LC/MS/MS. LC/LC/MS/MS—A fused-silica microcapillary column was laser-pulled (Model P-2000, Sutter Instrument Co., Novato, CA) and successively packed with 10 cm of 5-μm C18 reverse-phase material (XDBC18, Hewlett Packard) and 4 cm of 5-μm strong cation exchange material (SCX-Partisphere, Whatman, Clifton, NJ) as previously described (22Washburn M.P. Wolters D. Yates 3rd, J.R. Nat. Biotech. 2001; 19: 242-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (4091) Google Scholar). The sample was bomb-loaded and analyzed using fully automated online LC/LC/MS/MS instrumentation (HPLC LC Packings Ultimate, MS, Finnigan LTQ). The resultant MS spectra were searched against the Swiss-Prot data base of Homo sapiens using SEQUEST. Immunocytochemistry—The following primary antibodies were used: (a) a rabbit polyclonal antibody against mAC III (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA); (b) a goat polyclonal antibody against mAC VIII (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); and (c) a rabbit polyclonal antibody against Golf (generous gift from Dr. R. R. Reed). For immunofluorescence secondary goat anti-rabbit or donkey anti-goat conjugated to Alexa 488 or Alexa 568 from Molecular Probes were used. Enriched spermatozoa were plated on polylysine-coated coverslips (15 min/room temperature). Coverslips were washed in Ringer solution and fixed (30 min/room temperature) in 3% paraformaldehyde in Ringer solution containing 10 mm glucose. After washing with PBS, cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS containing 0.5% cold water fish skin gelatin (Sigma) (15 min/room temperature). Cells were incubated with primary antibodies diluted 1:500 in PBS/gelatin/Triton X-100 for 45 min, washed, and incubated with fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies diluted 1:500 in PBS/gelatin/Triton X-100 for 45 min; nuclei were stained with DAPI (Molecular Probes) in this incubation step. Unbound antibodies were washed with PBS, and coverslips were mounted in ProLong Antifade (Molecular Probes). All fluorescence images were obtained with a confocal microscope (LSM510 Meta; Zeiss) using a 40× 1.4-numerical aperture objective (pinhole set to one Airey unit) and further processed with Photoshop (Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, CA). Acrosome Reaction Assay—Acrosome-reacted sperm were visualized according to Meizel and Turner (23Meizel S. Turner K.O. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1993; 34: 457-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), incubating 100 μl of sperm suspension at a time with 5 μl of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated peanut lectin (Sigma). Acrosome-reacted cells were plated on concanavalin A (Sigma)-coated 35-mm dishes and counted using a digital Zeiss fluorescence microscope. Single Cell Ca2+Imaging—Cell density was photometrically adjusted to an extinction of E260nm = 0.035. Sperm were incubated (45 min/35.5 °C) in loading buffer (pH 7.4) containing Ringer solution and 7.5 μm fura-2-AM (Molecular Probes), and 0.1% Pluronic F-127 (Sigma). Next, sperm was centrifuged at 500 × g for 15 min, and the pellet was resuspended in fura-2-free buffer solution. 100 μl of mature motile fura-2-AM-loaded spermatozoa was transferred to concanavalin A (Sigma)-coated 35-mm dishes (30 min at 35.5 °C). Ca2+ imaging was performed using a Zeiss inverted microscope equipped for ratiometric imaging (24Spehr M. Wetzel C.H. Hatt H. Ache B.W. Neuron. 2002; 33: 731-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Ca2+ images were acquired from up to 15 spermatozoa in a randomly selected field of view, and integrated fluorescence ratios (f340/f380 ratio) were measured by separating the sperm head and midpiece. Exposure to bourgeonal (Quest Int., Naarden, Netherlands) and/or the water-soluble mAC inhibitor SQ22536 (Calbiochem) was accomplished using a specialized microcapillary application system (24Spehr M. Wetzel C.H. Hatt H. Ache B.W. Neuron. 2002; 33: 731-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Only spermatozoa with their heads and midpiece attached and their tails beating were included in the analysis. Sperm Population Ca2+Screening—Human fura-2AM-loaded sperm was diluted in Ringer solution (cell density adjusted to E260 = 0.035) and transferred to a 96-well Optiplate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with 150 μl of suspension per well. After addition of different test solutions (normal Ringer's solution (negative control), SQ22536, bourgeonal, progesterone (positive control)) samples were immediately read with a Fusion-α Universal Multiplate Analyzer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using a dual sequential fluorescence mode. Wells were subsequently illuminated (1 s) using a filter of 330 ± 20 nm and a filter of 380 ± 10 nm. Fluorescence signals were detected using a filter of 515 ± 10 nm, and ratios were calculated. Fluorescence changes due to Ringer solution application were subtracted from the originally recorded signals. Sperm Motility Analysis—Microcapillary bioassays were combined with computer-assisted video motion analysis (CAVMA) to determine behavioral effects of mAC signaling. Four replicate trials were performed for each of 12 treatments in a 6 (incubations) × 2 (stimuli) factor design. Sperm from different human donors were used in each trial. Experiments were conducted in compartments with two wells connected by a channel. First, sperm suspensions were incubated for 30-40 min in a pair of wells containing one of six treatments: HEPES-buffered human tubal fluid alone (HTF control, Irvine Scientific, Santa Ana, CA) or with addition of 10, 5, 1, 0.1, or 0.01 mm SQ22536. Second, to each treatment, a 6-μl, flat, microcapillary tube was inserted into the channel with the ends bridging sperm suspensions (106 cells/ml) in opposing wells. The stimulus (HTF medium or 10-7m bourgeonal) was presented in a capillary. After 1-h incubation at 37 °C, the contents of each capillary was transferred to the well of a toxiplasmosis slide, heat-fixed, and stained with 0.1% acridine orange for 1 min. The number of cells was then counted using an Olympus model BH2 microscope (×67 magnification) equipped for phase-contrast and epifluorescence applications. Swimming speeds and directions of individual cells were videotaped over 15 s, beginning 10-15 min after an assay began. Integrating with respect to time, fluid dynamic theory predicts that the concentration gradient created by continuous bourgeonal release should reach steady state in ∼10 min, within 300 μm of the capillary tip (12Spehr M. Gisselmann G. Poplawski A. Riffell J.A. Wetzel C.H. Zimmer R.K. Hatt H. Science. 2003; 299: 2054-2058Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar, 25Crank J. The Mathematics of Diffusion. Oxford Science Publications, Oxford1975Google Scholar). Sperm images were recorded on magnetic tape using a cooled charge-coupled device camera (NEC model TI 23A) mounted on an inverted compound light microscope (Olympus IX70, ×90 magnification) (26Riffell J.A. Krug P.J. Zimmer R.K. J. Exp. Biol. 2002; 205: 1439-1450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The camera had a 100-μm depth of field and focused on a region within 300 μm of the tip. Fluid dynamic theory further predicts that drag forces have especially strong effects on flagellar motion within ∼10 sperm body lengths of a wall, or microscope slide surface. To minimize potential artifacts, we assayed sperm motility in response to chemical stimuli at ∼2 mm, or 70 sperm body lengths, from the nearest chamber wall (26Riffell J.A. Krug P.J. Zimmer R.K. J. Exp. Biol. 2002; 205: 1439-1450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Images were digitized at 30 frames/s and processed using a CAVMA system (Motion Analysis Corp., Model VP320) interfaced with a Sun SPARC2 computer workstation (12Spehr M. Gisselmann G. Poplawski A. Riffell J.A. Wetzel C.H. Zimmer R.K. Hatt H. Science. 2003; 299: 2054-2058Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). To avoid parallax, we discarded short paths (≤10 frames) in which apparent sperm size changed >20%. All other paths were included in analyses. Swimming speed of each individual sperm was determined on a frame-by-frame basis and averaged over each path. The angle of sperm orientation was measured with respect to an origin (0°), defined as the shortest tangent between each cell and the capillary tip. Using circular statistics, a mean vector (r) was calculated to describe the average direction of movement of a cell population. Whereas a vector length of one indicates that all cells swim in a single, common direction, a vector length of zero indicates random motion. To determine if cell movement within a chemical gradient was non-random, each mean direction was compared with a uniform circular distribution using a Rayleigh's test. The production of a bourgeonal concentration gradient was vital to the success of this experimental design. Fluorescent (rhodamine) dye, as a surrogate for bourgeonal, was released from the capillary tip. Planar laser-induced fluorescence imaging revealed a steep, ascending gradient in dye concentration. Rhodamine concentration (a) remained highest at the tip, decreasing as approximately the three-halves power of time, and (b) decreased geometrically as a function of 1/distance from the tip. After 10 min, for example, dye concentration was reduced 10- and 100-fold within 15 and 180 μm of the capillary tip, respectively. In addition, using non-motile sperm as tracers for flow visualization and CAVMA, fluid motion (due to convection, flow from pipette, and mixing) was negligible (<5 μm/s) as compared with the swimming speeds of live cells. Expression of hOR17-4, Stimulatory G-proteins, and mAC(s)—Initially, we asked whether potential signaling proteins that could link sperm OR activation to cAMP-mediated behavioral changes, such as mAC isoforms and stimulatory G-protein α subunits, are expressed in human sperm cells. Because mature mammalian spermatozoa have stopped protein synthesis (27Diez-Sanchez C. Ruiz-Pesini E. Montoya J. Perez-Martos A. Enriquez J.A. Lopez-Perez M.J. FEBS Lett. 2003; 553: 205-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), this analysis cannot be performed at the mRNA level (e.g. by reverse transcription-PCR or in situ hybridization). Therefore, we decided to introduce a state-of-the-art “shotgun”-proteomics approach (MudPIT) to the analysis of sperm protein content that is based on two-dimensional liquid chromatography and mass spectroscopy (22Washburn M.P. Wolters D. Yates 3rd, J.R. Nat. Biotech. 2001; 19: 242-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (4091) Google Scholar). Sperm membrane proteins were separated using one-dimensional gels and subjected to tryptic digestion. All peptide MS/MS spectra were searched using the SEQUEST search criteria allowing for variable modification of methionine (+16 Da) and cysteine (+57 Da). Spectra were assigned as good hits according to Wolters et al. (28Wolters D. Washburn M. Yates 3rd, J.R. Anal. Chem. 2001; 73: 5683-5690Crossref PubMed Scopus (1572) Google Scholar) with all good candidates being manually evaluated. Among ∼100 different membrane proteins detected, this approach identified a set of candidate molecules (Table I), including all nine mammalian mAC isoforms and the “olfactory-specific” stimulatory Golf α-subunit (29Jones D.T. Reed R.R. Science. 1989; 244: 790-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). Furthermore, MudPIT analysis confirms expression of hOR17-4 in human sperm. Thus, several components necessary for G-protein-coupled cAMP generation are present in human spermatozoa.Table IMudPIT reveals expression of candidate OR-associated signaling proteins in human spermDescriptionAccession nos.No. of peptidesType VIII adenylyl cyclase1085410; 867507Type IX adenylate cyclase2715176412Type VI adenylate cyclase, isoform a101810965Type VII adenylate cyclase45572559Type II adenylate cyclase131247027Type I adenylate cyclase5850235Type V adenylate cyclase250140554Type IV adenylate cyclase244975873Type III adenylate cyclase47577241Golf α (olfactory type)45040434Gs α, isoform XL-α-s4795322Gy α-1130416824G α-1545040394Gt α-2 (cone-type transducin α subunit)2119461; 203308051hOR17-4 (OR1D2)45055172 Open table in a new tab Signaling Components Show Distinct Spatial Distribution—Given an OR-mediated signaling pathway, we next determined the spatial distribution of the “olfactory-specific” Golf and mAC III as well as the prominent mAC VIII isoforms. Isolated human spermatozoa were immunostained with anti-mAC III, anti-mAC VIII, and anti-Golf antibodies to examine the (sub-) cellular distributions of the proteins. Spermatozoa were clearly labeled by all of these antibodies (Fig. 1, left panel), whereas control samples labeled with the same secondary antibodies alone lacked any significant staining (Fig. 1, right panel). Interestingly, localization of mAC isoforms differed between different compartments: mAC VIII was strongly localized to the sperm tail, whereas little or no staining was observed on the head and on the midpiece (Fig. 1b). By contrast, mAC III localization differed from cell to cell; some spermatozoa showed a relatively uniform distribution of the protein on the head, although in varying intensities (Fig. 1a, arrows). Other cells showed a ring-like staining around the head (Fig. 1a, arrowhead), which we suspect reflects the equatorial segment. We next investigated the dependence of these localization differences on the acrosome status of the cells and found that strong uniform staining only occurs in acrosome-reacted cells (Fig. 2a). In agreement with previous reports (4Eisenbach M. Dev. Genet. (Amst.). 1999; 25: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), only 6.36 ± 1.57% of more than 2500 sperm cells investigated (5 donors and 15 different samples) were found spontaneously acrosome-reacted, and this ratio was not significantly changed by 10-min incubation with bourgeonal (50 μm) and/or the water-soluble P-site inhibitor of mAC function SQ22536 (3 mm) (Fig. 2b). Most spermatozoa show a relatively strong middle piece staining with antibodies against mAC III, and the staining of the tail in most cases was relatively faint (Fig. 1b). Golf labeling was observed throughout the tail as well as in the middle piece of the spermatozoa (Fig. 1c). Thus, both Golf and mAC III/VIII are localized to the sperm midpiece and/or tail where flagellar beating is initiated.Fig. 2AC distribution is dependent on the acrosome status.a, spermatozoa preparations were incubated with an A568 dye conjugate of lectin peanut agglutinin, which can be used as selective marker for human sperm acrosomes (red), stained with anti-mAC III antibodies (green), and nuclei are counterstained with DAPI (blue). Overlay image demonstrates strong staining of the whole head of acrosome-reacted spermatozoa with mAC III, whereas spermatozoa, which have not undergone acrosome reaction (no red staining), show typical ring-like staining around the head. Single confocal sections. Bar, 10 μm. b, the proportion of spontaneously acrosome-reacted sperm is low under control conditions and not significantly changed by preincubation with bourgeonal (50 μm) and/or SQ22536 (3 mm).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Odorant-induced Ca2+Signals Originate in the Flagellar Midpiece—Generation of odorant-induced Ca2+ signals in sperm cell compartments (12Spehr M.

Science. 2003; 299: 2054-2058Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar) should correspond with the functional localization of hOR17-4 and its signal transduction machinery. Therefore, we investigated the spatiotemporal properties of the bourgeonal response of individual spermatozoa using high resolution Ca2+ imaging. In this experiment, stimulus-induced Ca2+ signals were analyzed separately in the head and flagellar midpiece. A relatively high temporal resolution (of four complete fluoratiometric recording cycles per second) allowed for a sub-cellular analysis of the bourgeonal-induced Ca2+ response (Fig. 3). In 85% of all cells individually tested (17/21) the initial response to bourgeonal was observed in the midpiece region. With a mean latency of 2.15 ± 1.2 s, Ca2+ increases were detectable in the sperm head. Although the overall response waveform was comparable in both compartments, absolute signals were considerably stronger and more persistent in the head region (38.8 ± 8.7 s) than in the midpiece (26.95 ± 3.8 s). Under Ca2+-free extracellular conditions no signals were detected, in either the head or the midpiece (data not shown). In summary, these data are consistent with the spatial distribution of potential signaling components shown in our immunolabeling experiments. Odorant-induced Ca2+Signaling i"
https://openalex.org/W2097663185,"Members of the canonical transient receptor potential (TRPC) subfamily of cation channels are candidates for capacitative and non-capacitative Ca2+ entry channels. When ectopically expressed in cell lines, TRPC3 can be activated by phospholipase C-mediated generation of diacylglycerol or by addition of synthetic diacylglycerols, independently of Ca2+ store depletion. Apart from this mode of regulation, little is known about other receptor-dependent signaling events that modulate TRPC3 activity. In the present study the role of tyrosine kinases in receptor- and diacylglycerol-dependent activation of TRPC3 was investigated. In HEK293 cells stably expressing TRPC3, pharmacological inhibition of tyrosine kinases, and specifically of Src kinases, abolished activation of TRPC3 by muscarinic receptor stimulation and by diacylglycerol. Channel regulation was lost following expression of a dominant-negative mutant of Src, or when TRPC3 was expressed in an Src-deficient cell line. In both instances, wild-type Src restored TRPC3 regulation. We conclude that Src plays an obligatory role in the mechanism for receptor and diacylglycerol activation of TRPC3.

Although the molecular identity of capacitative and non-capacitative calcium entry channels, as well as the signaling mechanisms involved, remain uncertain, mammalian homologues of the Drosophila melanogaster transient receptor potential (TRP) channel have been considered as potential candidates (4Birnbaumer L.

Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Cell. 1996; 85: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar), has been shown in many heterologous expression systems to behave as a receptor-activated channel that can be activated also by exogenous application of diacylglycerols (DAGs) independently of store depletion. In fact, DAG-induced activation of TRPC3 and its structural relatives TRPC6 and TRPC7 (8Hofmann T. Obukhov A.G. Schaefer M. Harteneck C. Gudermann T. Schultz G.

Apart from its regulation by DAG generated from PLC stimulation through either G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) or receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), little is known about additional signaling pathways downstream of receptor-stimulation involved in activation of TRPC3. Stimulation of either of these receptor pathways results in rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins (10Tsai W. Morielli A.D. Peralta E.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4597-4605Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 11Babnigg G. Zagranichnaya T. Wu X. Villereal M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14872-14882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), and so in the present study we investigated whether tyrosine kinases might play a role in the signaling mechanism underlying receptor- and DAG-dependent activation of TRPC3. We found that inhibition of tyrosine kinase activity completely abrogated the ability of either GPCR stimulation or exogenous application of diacylglycerol to induce TRPC3 activation. The results indicate an obligatory requirement for functional Src kinase for TRPC3 activation, likely involving Src-dependent phosphorylation and/or recruitment of an as yet unidentified accessory protein. In addition, the results show that activation of the channels by diacylglycerol is unlikely to involve a direct action of diacylglycerol on the channels. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Measurement of Intracellular Calcium—Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) stably expressing the human TRPC3 (TRPC3-HEK293) with either the hemagglutinin (HA)-epitope (TRPC3-HA) or the green fluorescent protein (TRPC3-GFP) fused to its C terminus, were cultured as previously described (12McKay R.R.

For transient transfections, either TRPC3-HA or TRPC3-GFP cells were grown in 6-well plates and transfected as indicated with 1 μg of either wild-type Src (WT-Src, kindly provided by Dr. Thomas E.

Real-time fluorescence measurements with coverslip-plated cells were performed as in Trebak et al. (14Trebak M. St John Bird G. McKay R.R. Birnbaumer L. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol.

When only Ca2+ was measured in a particular experiment, calibrated [Ca2+]i values are reported (i.e. see Fig. 1). In most instances, when experiments involved measurement of Ba2+ entry, fluorescence ratios (fluorescence at 510 nm with excitation at 340 nm divided by that with excitation at 380 nm) are reported. The DT40 chicken B lymphocyte cell line and the mutant variant deficient in PLCγ-2 (PLCγ-KO) were kindly provided by Dr. Tomohiro Kurosaki (Department of Molecular Genetics, Kansai Medical University). DT40 cells culture, transfection, loading with the Ca2+ indicator Fura-2, and ratiometric measurement of intracellular Ca2+ were accomplished as described previously (15Vazquez G. Wedel B.J.

Transient transfections of the wild-type and PLCγ-KO DT40 cells were performed by electroporation, with either the human isoform of TRPC3 (100 μg/ml TRPC3 into pcDNA3 vector, provided by Dr. Lutz Birnbaumer, NIEHS, NIH), the human M5 muscarinic receptor (50 μg/ml, in pcDNA3), vector alone (pcDNA3, mock transfected cells), or a combination of them, along with EYFP (5 μg) as marker for transfection. Cells were used for real-time fluorescence measurements 17–25 h post-transfection. SYF (Src–/–, Yes–/–, and Fyn–/–) and YF (Yes–/–, Fyn–/–) cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C under humidified air (5% CO2). For transient transfections, SYF and YF cells grown in 6-well plates were transfected by using Lipofectamine 2000 following the manufacturer's instructions, with either human TRPC3 (1 μg), human M5 muscarinic receptor (1 μg), vector alone (pcDNA3, mock transfected cells), or a combination of them, along with EYFP (0.5 μg) as marker for transfection. In some experiments, either WT-Src (1 μg) or CA-Src (1 μg) was co-transfected with TRPC3, M5 receptor, and EYFP into SYF cells. 24 h after transfection, cells were plated onto glass coverslips, and an additional 24 h later used for calcium measurements as described above for HEK293 cells. In all experiments involving transiently transfected cells, real-time fluorescence measurements were performed under the conditions indicated with single EYFP-positive cells, selected by their yellow/green fluorescence (excitation: 485 nm; emission: 520 nm). In figures involving transient transfections, average traces from 8–12 EYFP-positive cells are shown for a single experiment, whereas for stably transfected cells (i.e. for the pharmacological experiments) averages of 30–50 are shown. These are representative of at least three independent experiments. Because the cells are not confluent and behave independently, statistical analyses treat each cell as an individual observation. The use of at least three different coverslips with experiments carried out independently assures that spurious errors do not confound the statistical conclusion. In some instances, statistical significance is assumed on the basis of non-parametric statistical principles when large numbers of cells either do or do not show a qualitative response; i.e. when for example each of 100 different cells shows a strong Ca2+ signal under control conditions, whereas not one of 100 different cells responds in the presence of an inhibitor. Comparisons of quantitative differences between mean levels of [Ca2+] or rates of Ca2+ or Ba2+ entry were made using a two-tailed t test for two means, or analysis of variance for three or more means. When the analysis of variance was found to be significant at p < 0.05, it was followed by Tukey-Kramer multicomparison tests carried out using GraphPad In-Stat software. Summarized data are given as means ± S.E. Cell Lysis, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblotting—Wild-type and HA-TRPC3-expressing HEK293 cells were plated onto polylysine-coated 60-mm tissue culture dishes. After 24 h, cells were washed two times in HEPES-buffered physiological saline solution (HBSS, composition in mm: 140 NaCl, 4.7 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 2.0 CaCl2, 10 glucose, 10 HEPES, pH 7.4) and equilibrated in the same solution for 20 min at room temperature. Following treatment with either vehicle, carbachol (300 μm), EGF (150 ng/ml), or OAG (1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol, 100 μm), the cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution and lysed in lysis buffer containing: 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.2% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 4 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin. After 30-min incubation on ice with shaking, samples were centrifuged for 20 min at maximal speed in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge, and supernatants were used for immunoprecipitation with the desired antibody. The supernatants (800 μg) were then incubated with 2 μg of anti-HA mouse monoclonal antibody (12CA5 clone, Roche Applied Science) or anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (clone 4G10, Upstate Biotechnology, Charlottesville, VA) and 50 μl of protein Aagarose (Invitrogen) for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed four times with PBS (containing inhibitors for proteases and phosphatases) and then heated at 95 °C in 2× SDS sample buffer and resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (10% polyacrylamide). Proteins from gels were electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (0.45-μm pore size, Invitrogen) and subjected to immunoblotting with the indicated antibody. After incubation with the secondary antibody (HRP-conjugated anti-mouse, Amersham Biosciences) immunoreactive bands were visualized by ECL chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences), following the manufacturer's instructions. For evaluation of tyrosine phosphorylation of total cellular proteins, cells were treated and processed as above. Where indicated, cells were incubated for 30 min with 100 μm genistein before carbachol or OAG treatment. Aliquots (20 μg) from each cell lysate were subjected to SDS-PAGE (10% polyacrylamide) electrophoresis and immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10. Evaluation of Src Activation—TRPC3-HEK293 cells plated onto polylysine-coated 60-mm tissue culture dishes were washed two times in HBSS, equilibrated in the same solution for 20 min at room temperature, and then treated with either vehicle, carbachol (300 μm), or OAG (100 μm), either in the presence (2 mm) or absence of extracellular calcium (nominally Ca2+ free) and in the presence of 5 μm Gd3+. Where indicated, the protein kinase C inhibitor Gö6976 (1 μm) was added to the incubation medium 15 min prior to OAG stimulation. The cells were then washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed as detailed above. The supernatants (800 μg) were then incubated with 4 μg of anti-Src mouse monoclonal antibody (clone GD11, Upstate Biotechnology) and 50 μl of protein G-agarose (Calbiochem) for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed four times with PBS (containing inhibitors for proteases and phosphatases) and then processed as above for SDS-PAGE (10% polyacrylamide). Immunoblotting was performed using a specific antiphosphoSrc antibody (Calbiochem), which detects Src phosphorylated at Tyr-418 (16Bourguignon L.Y. Zhu H. Shao L. Chen Y.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7327-7336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). After incubation with the secondary antibody, immunoreactive phosphoSrc was detected by ECL chemiluminescence. Materials—Fura-2-acetoxymethylester was from Molecular Probes Inc. Carbachol, OAG, Gö6976 (12-(2-cyanoethyl)-6,7,12,13-tetrahydro-13-methyl-5-oxo-5H-indolo(2,3-a)pyrrolo(3,4-c)carbazole), genistein, daidzein, erbstatin analogue, herbimycin, lavendustin A, bpV(phen) (bisperoxo(1,10-phenantroline)oxovanadate), AG1478, PP2 (4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine), salicylate, piceatannol (3,4,3′,5′-tetrahydroxy-trans-stilbene), and sodium orthovanadate were purchased from Calbiochem. Recombinant human epidermal growth factor was from Upstate Biotechnology (Charlottesville, VA). The anti-chicken IgM antibody (clone M4) was from Southern Biotechnology Associates Inc. (Birmingham, AL). Nonidet P-40, sodium deoxycholate, sodium pyrophosphate, β-glycerophosphate, sodium fluoride, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, CaCl2, BaCl2, and GdCl2 were from Sigma. Complete® protease inhibitor tablets were from Roche Applied Science. All other reagents used were of analytical grade. Sources of antibodies and reagents for immunoprecipitation, electrophoresis, and immunoblotting are indicated in the corresponding methods sections. We first evaluated the impact of inhibition of cellular tyrosine kinases on receptor-dependent TRPC3 activation by Fura-2 imaging of multiple single cells as indicated under “Materials and Methods” (and see Ref. 14Trebak M.

As in previous work, 5 μm Gd3+ in the extracellular medium was used throughout these experiments to fully inhibit the endogenous capacitative calcium entry pathway (2Broad L.M. Cannon T.R. Taylor C.W. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 517: 121-134Crossref Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 17Trebak M. St John Bird G. McKay R.R. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21617-21623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, muscarinic stimulation of cells in Ca2+-free medium resulted in a transient release of Ca2+ as a consequence of IP3-mediated mobilization from endogenous stores. Re-addition of Ca2+ (2 mm) to the extracellular medium resulted in a robust Gd3+-insensitive Ca2+ entry, indicating activation of TRPC3. Genistein caused a dose-dependent reduction in TRPC3 activation, with complete inhibition at 100 μm genistein. The inactive genistein analogue, daidzein (100 μm), did not inhibit (not shown). Erbstatin analogue, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor not chemically related to genistein (18Umezawa K. Hori T. Tajima H. Imoto M. Isshiki K. Takeuchi T. FEBS Lett. 1990; 260: 198-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), also completely suppressed receptor-activation of TRPC3 (Fig. 1A). At the concentrations used in this study, the tyrosine kinase inhibitors herbimycin (1 μm) and lavendustin A (5 μm) partially inhibited TRPC3-mediated Ca2+ entry (not shown). When TRPC3 is ectopically expressed in most cell lines, OAG-induced Gd3+-insensitive Ca2+ entry constitutes a hallmark of TRPC3 activation (8Hofmann T. Obukhov A.G. Schaefer M. Harteneck C. Gudermann T. Schultz G. Nature. 1999; 397: 259-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar). We next examined the effect of tyrosine kinase inhibitors on OAG-induced activation of TRPC3. Both genistein (100 μm) and erbstatin analogue (20 μm) completely abrogated OAG-induced activation of TRPC3 (Fig. 1B). Importantly, TRPC5, a member of the TRPC family, which has been shown to behave as a receptor-activated non-selective cation channel insensitive to OAG and store depletion (19Schaefer M. Plant T.D. Obukhov A.G. Hofmann T. Gudermann T. Schultz G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17517-17526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar), was not affected by the tyrosine kinase inhibitors used here (not shown), thus ruling out potential nonspecific effects of the tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as plasma membrane depolarization. Finally, because further evidence that the effects of genistein result from inhibition of tyrosine kinases, treatment of TRPC3-expressing HEK293 cells with 200 μm of the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor bisperoxo(1,10-phenantroline)oxovanadate (bpV(phen)) (20Bevan A.P. Burgess J.W. Yale J.F. Drake P.G. Lachance D. Baquiran G. Shaver A. Posner B.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: E60-E66PubMed Google Scholar) resulted in a partial recovery (∼30–40%) from genistein inhibition of TRPC3 activation (Fig. 1C). 2Examination of gels from whole cell extracts immunoblotted for tyrosine phosphates shows that, although the block of tyrosine phosphorylation by genistein is nearly complete, some faint bands remain, indicating a small degree of kinase persists. Thus, we would suppose that a small degree of Src activity persists in the presence of genistein, which can by amplified by the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor. Together, these observations strongly suggest that receptor- and OAG-dependent activation of TRPC3 requires tyrosine kinase activity. To obtain preliminary insight into the putative identity of the tyrosine kinase/s involved in receptor-dependent activation of TRPC3, a panel of inhibitors specific for different families of tyrosine kinases was utilized. The potential roles of epidermal growth factor receptor-associated kinase activity, Syk and Src-family kinases, and the proline-rich tyrosine kinase Pyk2, all known to be activated downstream of stimulation of the Gq-coupled muscarinic receptor (21Igishi T.

Pre-treatment of HEK293 cells with the potent antagonist of the epidermal growth factor receptor, AG1478 (2 μm (27Chen N. Ma W.Y. She Q.B. Wu E. Liu G. Bode A.M. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46722-46728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar)), did not affect the ability of muscarinic receptor stimulation to activate TRPC3-mediated calcium entry (not shown). Neither salicylate (20 mm), a compound reported as a specific inhibitor of Pyk2 (28Byron K.L. Lucchesi P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7298-7307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), nor piceatannol (3,4,3′,5′-tetrahydroxy-trans-stilbene), a specific inhibitor for Syk (29Seow C.J. Chue S.C. Wong W.S. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 443: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 30Lawrence D.S. Niu J. Pharmacol. Ther. 1998; 77: 81-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), a cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine kinase not belonging to the Src family, affected either receptor- or OAG-dependent activation of TRPC3, indicating that neither of these tyrosine kinases was required for signaling to TRPC3 (not shown). However, preincubation of HEK293 cells with the Src kinase-specific inhibitor 4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine (PP2 (31Bain J. McLauchlan H. Elliott M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar)) resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in both muscarinic receptor stimulated- and OAG-induced TRPC3-mediated cation entry, with almost complete inhibition at 5 μm (Fig. 2). This result suggests that an Src family kinase may be involved in both receptor and OAG activation of TRPC3. To investigate more directly the involvement of Src, we determined the effect of transient expression of a kinase-dead dominant-negative mutant of human Src (DN-Src) into TRPC3-expressing HEK293 cells. This mutant carries a kinase inactivating mutation (Lys-295 → Met) that results in complete suppression of Src kinase activity without altering its ability to interact with SH2 and/or SH3 binding partners (32Twamley-Stein G.M. Pepperkok R. Ansorge W. Courtneidge S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7696-7700Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, both muscarinic receptor- and OAG-induced TRPC3-mediated cation entry were completely abrogated by DN-Src, whereas overexpression of the wild-type form of Src (WT-Src) had no such inhibitory effect. In parallel experiments, the endogenous store-operated pathway was assessed by observing thapsigargin-activated Ca2+ entry (in the absence of Gd3+). Significantly, the endogenous store-operated Ca2+ entry pathway was not affected by DN-Src (not shown), ruling out alterations in membrane potential that might reduce the driving force for Ca2+ entry. Also, DN-Src expression in HEK293 cells stably expressing TRPC3 tagged to GFP (TRPC3-GFP) showed that overexpression of the mutant did not affect either expression or the membrane targeting of the channel (not shown). Importantly, co-expression of WT-Src in TRPC3-HEK293 cells together with DN-Src partially rescued both agonist- and OAG-dependent activation of TRPC3 (Fig. 3). Expression of DN-Src and WT-Src was confirmed by Western analysis (not shown). Quantitation of the Western blots indicated that similar amounts of both forms were expressed and that the amount of protein expressed with the combination was approximately twice that for expression of each alone. As an additional test to the hypothesis that Src activity is obligatory for signaling to TRPC3, we transiently expressed TRPC3 (together with the M5 muscarinic receptor) into SYF (Src–/–, Yes–/–, and Fyn–/–) cells. SYF is a mouse embryo fibroblast cell line harboring functional null mutations in both alleles of the Src family protein-tyrosine kinases (33Klinghoffer R.A. Sachsenmaier C. Cooper J.A. Soriano P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2459-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4A, addition of 2 mm Ba2+ to the extracellular bath resulted in the appearance of a significant Gd3+-insensitive cation entry in many transfected cells due to TRPC3 constitutive activity, because it was absent in cells transfected only with the M5 receptor (not shown). Subsequent activation of the muscarinic pathway resulted in a transient increase in intracellular Ca2+ due to release from endogenous stores, but the rate of constitutive Ba2+ entry, an indicator of TRPC3 activity, was not further increased. To minimize the cation entry due to TRPC3 constitutive activity, the Ba2+ concentration was reduced to 0.5 mm. Under these conditions, constitutive Ba2+ entry was minimized, and there was no evidence of carbachol-stimulated TRPC3 activity (Fig. 4A). Similarly, OAG failed to increase TRPC3-mediated Ba2+ entry under these conditions (Fig. 4B). That the lack of TRPC3 regulation in these cells was in fact due to the absence of Src expression was confirmed by two separate strategies. First, TRPC3 was transiently co-expressed with the muscarinic M5 receptor into YF (Yes–/– and Fyn–/–) cells, which were obtained by stably reintroducing the wild-type form of Src into SYF cells (33Klinghoffer R.A. Sachsenmaier C. Cooper J.A. Soriano P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2459-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5 (A and B), challenging these cells with either carbachol or OAG significantly stimulated a Gd3+-insensitive cation entry that was absent in YF cells transfected with either the M5 receptor (Fig. 5A) or vector (pcDNA3, mock cells in Fig. 5B) alone. Second, transiently co-expressing WT-Src into SYF cells together with TRPC3 and M5 receptor resulted in restitution of both receptor and OAG activation of the channel (Fig. 5, C and D).Fig. 5TRPC3 regulation is restored when Src is expressed.A and B, Ba2+ influx was measured in Fura-2-loaded YF (Yes–/– and Fyn–/–) cells transfected with: A, either the M5 muscarinic receptor alone (dotted trace) or the M5 receptor plus TRPC3 (solid trace), or B, either TRPC3 (solid trace) or its vector alone (pcDNA3, Mock, dotted trace). C and D, Ba2+ influx was measured in Fura-2-loaded SYF (Src–/–, Yes–/–, and Fyn–/–) cells co-transfected with either the M5 muscarinic receptor and WT-Src (dotted traces), or the M5 receptor, WT-Src, and TRPC3 (solid traces). EYFP was used as a transfection marker. The cells were maintained in a nominally Ca2+-free medium containing 5 μm Gd3+ and then exposed to 300 μm carbachol (A and C) or 100 μm OAG (B and D). Ba2+ (0.5 mm) was added to the medium 2 min before agonist or OAG stimulation and maintained throughout the experiment. Shown are traces representative of at least three separate experiments. For A, the mean increase in ratio due to Ba2+ entry in cells transfected with TRPC3 was 0.53 ± 0.01 (n = 96). In non-TRPC3-transfected cells, there was no net increase in steady-st"

C. albicans N-linked mannan (Fig. 1) consists of an α-1,6-linked polymannose backbone with side chains comprising α-1,2and α-1,3-linked oligomannosides (18Cutler J.E. Med. Mycol. 2001; 39S: 75-86Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and, in serotype A strains, β-1,2 mannose residues. Mannosylphosphate consists of chains of one to fourteen β-1,2-linked mannose residues attached to the side chains via phosphodiester linkages (19Jigami Y. Odani T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1426: 335-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 20Trinel P.A. Lepage G. Jouault T. Strecker G. Poulain D. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). N-linked mannan can be resolved by mild acid hydrolysis into acid-stable and acid-labile fractions, the former consisting of the phosphodiester bond and all proximal mannose residues and the latter of β-1,2-linked mannose chains only. In C. albicans serotype A strains the acid-stable fraction contains a number of α-1,2- and β-1,2-linked mannose side chains, which constitute antigenic factor 6 and are absent in serotype B strains (21Suzuki S. Candida and Candidosis. ASM Press, Washington, D.C.2002: 29-36Google Scholar). C. albicans N-linked mannan is illustrated in Fig. 1. The other known source of β-1,2-linked mannose residues in the C. albicans cell wall is phospholipomannan, which consists of a lipid (ceramide) attached by a unique mannosylphosphate/manno-inositol phosphate spacer to an unbranched β-1,2-oligomannoside chain of up to 19 residues in length (15Trinel P.A.

Candida and Candidosis. ASM Press, Washington, D.C.2002: 29-36Google Scholar). They have been implicated in complement binding (22Cutler J.E. Res.

Purified β-1,2-manno-oligosaccharides bind to macrophages (24Dalle F. Jouault T. Trinel P.A. Esnault J. Mallet J.M. d'Athis P. Poualain D. Bonnin A. Infect.

Jouault T. Trinel P.A. Esnault J. Mallet J.M. d'Athis P. Poualain D. Bonnin A. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 7061-7068Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Moreover, antibody to β-1,2-mannotriose protected mice against systemic candidiasis in a mouse model of infection (29Jouault T. Lepage G. Berginaud A. Trinel P.-A. Fradin C. Wieruszeski J.-M.

Because most β-1,2-mannose is attached via mannosylphosphate in the C. albicans cell wall, we investigated the role of this fraction in macrophage recognition by constructing a null mutant in the C. albicans homolog of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae MNN4, which is required for mannosylphosphorylation.In S. cerevisiae there are at least four potential mannosylphosphorylation sites. In N-linked mannan, mannosylphosphate may be attached to the terminal α-1,6-mannose residue in the α-1,6-linked polymannose backbone, α-1,2-linked mannose residues in side chains emerging from the α-1,6-linked backbone, and the Man8GlcNAc2 oligosaccharide core. In O-linked mannan, mannosylphosphate may be attached to the second mannose residue of O-linked mannan (18Cutler J.E. Med. Mycol. 2001; 39S: 75-86Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 19Jigami Y.

Much information concerning the control of mannosylphosphorylation in S. cerevisiae stems from the observation that mannosylphosphate-deficient cells have a reduced negative charge and consequently fail to bind the positively charged phthalocyanine dye Alcian Blue (32Ballou C.E. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 440-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). This allowed the development of qualitative (33Ballou C.E. Kern K.A. Raschke W.C. J. Biol.

Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 805-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) assays of yeast cell mannosylphosphorylation. The role of the S. cerevisiae, ScMNN6, and ScMNN4 genes that are involved in mannosylphosphorylation of both O- and N-linked mannan (35Karson E.M. Ballou C.E. J. Biol.

Acta. 1999; 1426: 335-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). ScMnn6p shares significant homology with the Golgi α-1,2-mannosyltransferase Kre2p/Mnt1p. The Scmnn6 mutant has diminished mannosylphosphate transferase activity and is proposed to encode the mannosylphosphate transferase (37Odani T. Shimma Y. Wang X.H. Jigami Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). ScMnn4p does not display homology to known mannosyltransferases and has been proposed to act as a positive regulator of ScMNN6 (34Odani T. Shimma Y. Tanaka A. Jigami Y. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 805-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Mannosylphosphate transferase activity is reduced by ∼80% in both the Scmnn4 and Scmnn4/MNN4 diploid strains, neither of which bind Alcian Blue, indicating that the Scmnn4 mutation is dominant (38Wang X.H. Nakayama K. Shimma Y. Tanaka A. Jigami Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18117-18124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). ScMnn4p has type II membrane protein topology and is characterized by a 130-amino acid region at the C terminus of the protein, consisting mainly of lysine-glutamic acid tandem repeats (KKKKEEEE), which is essential for Mnn4p activity (33Ballou C.E. Kern K.A. Raschke W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 4667-4671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Here we generate a mnn4 null mutant strain of C. albicans that is devoid of mannosylphosphate on its surface. The mutant was viable and unaffected in virulence, indicating that neither mannosylphosphate or the β-1,2-oligomannosides that are linked to it are involved in virulence or the interactions of C. albicans cells with macrophages.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESStrains, Media, and Transformations—C. albicans was grown in shake culture in YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% mycological peptone, 2% glucose), GYEP (2% (w/v) glucose, 0.3% yeast extract, 1% peptone), SD (0.67% yeast nitrogen base, 2% (w/v) glucose), or NGY (0.1% yeast extract, 0.1% neopeptone, 0.4% glucose) with or without 1.5% agar. The media for growth of Ura– auxotrophs were supplemented with 25 μg/ml uridine. For sensitivity testing, cell wall damaging agents were added to YPD agar at various concentrations. Germ tube formation was induced in 20% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) at 37 °C, at a maximum cell density of 107/ml. The C. albicans strains used or constructed in this study are shown in Table I. The plasmids were maintained in DH5-α Escherichia coli cells. C. albicans cells were transformed using the lithium acetate protocol (39Munro C.A. Winter K. Buchan A. Henry K. Becker J.M. Brown A.J.

To make MNN4 disruption cassettes, the HindIII-KpnI fragment of CaMNN4 in pDH1 was replaced with the hisG-URA3-hisG cassette of pMB7 and p5921 to create plasmids pDH2 and pDH3, respectively (Table I). Plasmids pDH2 and pDH3 were digested with KspI (SacII) and SacI to yield a 4.8-kb disruption cassette containing the URA-blaster cassette, flanked by 320-bp upstream and 307-bp downstream sequences of MNN4. Plasmid pDH3 contained BamHI restriction sites at the downstream ends of the HisG repeats that were derived from p5921 and absent in pDH2. Sequential rounds of transformation of CAI-4, with cassettes derived from plasmids pDH2 and pDH3, respectively, were carried out to disrupt CaMNN4 (40Fonzi W.A. Irwin M.Y. Genetics. 1993; 134: 717-728Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ura– segregants were recovered on SD plates supplemented with 1 mg/ml 5-fluoro orotic acid 5-FOA and 25 μg/ml uridine between transformations. Disruption was initially confirmed by PCR from independently derived transformants. Disruption was further confirmed by Southern analysis.Reintegration of MNN4 into the Null Strain—Control strains were generated in which MNN4 was integrated into the RPS10 gene of the mnn4Δ null mutant. The putative CaMNN4 ORF with 744-bp upstream and 27-bp downstream nucleotides was amplified from CAF2–1 genomic DNA by PCR with a single primer pair (Ca-MNN4–7, 5′-GAACAAGAGCTCTCTTCTTTTTCTTTTATAAC-3′; Ca-MNN4–10, 5′-GAAGAAGCGGCCGCGTAAGTAAATATGTTTTATGC-3′) containing SacI and NotI restriction sites (underlined). The MNN4 PCR product was cloned into pGEM-T Easy and three independent recombinants, pDH4A/B and C, were selected. The MNN4 gene was excised from pDH4A by digestion with SacI and NotI and ligated into SacI- and NotI-digested CIp10 (41Murad A.M. Lee P.R. Broadbent I.D. Barelle C.J. Brown A.J.P. Yeast. 2000; 16: 325-327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to make the reintegration vector pDH5 (Table I). The mnn4Δ mutant was transformed with StuI cut pDH5, and transformants were screened by Southern analysis to detect single and multiple reintegrants of MNN4 at the RPS10 locus. Ura–mnn4Δ null mutants were also transformed with StuI-digested CIp10 to create a control strain in which URA3 was expressed at the RPS10 locus.Northern Analysis—Levels of MNN4 in parental strains, heterozygous and homozygous disruptants, and reintegrant strains with one or more copies of CaMNN4 placed at the RPS10 locus were measured by Northern analyses. RNA was isolated from yeast cells harvested in mid-log phase (optical density, 0.8) after growth in YPD at 30 °C. RNA samples were heated at 50 °C for 60 min in 55% Me2SO, 1.1 m glyoxal, separated on a 1.4% (w/v) nondenaturing agarose gel, and then transferred onto Hybond-N nylon membranes and hybridized with 32P-labeled probes. The CaMNN4 transcript was detected using a 1.5-kb probe derived from the deleted region of CaMNN4. ACT1 mRNA was detected as a loading control.DNA Sequencing—The putative MNN4 genes in three independent plasmids, pDH4A, pDH4B, and pDH4C, were amplified in Big Dye 2.0 Terminator Sequencing Cycle reactions (Applied Biosystems). The sequenced ORF was submitted to GenBank™ (accession number AF481861).Alcian Blue Binding and Analysis of Whole Cell Mannan—Alcian Blue binding assays were adapted from Odani et al. (34Odani T. Shimma Y. Tanaka A. Jigami Y. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 805-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A suspension of ∼1.4 × 107 washed, stationary phase C. albicans cells were suspended in 1 ml of 30 μg/ml Alcian Blue (George T. Gurr, London, UK) in 0.02 m HCl (pH 3.0), incubated at room temperature for 10 min, and pelleted by centrifugation. A620 values of 100-μl supernatant samples were determined in a spectrophotometer. Alcian Blue concentration was determined by reference to a standard curve. Alcian Blue binding (pg/cell) was calculated according to the formula: x = [(u–v) ÷n] × 106 where x = Alcian Blue bound (pg/cell), u = original Alcian Blue concentration (μg/ml), v = final Alcian Blue concentration (μg/ml), and n = number of cells stained.For analysis of whole cell mannan, C. albicans cells were labeled with [2-3H]mannose. Acid-labile mannan was released by boiling cells in 10 mm HCl for 1 h. After neutralization with 10 mm NaOH products were analyzed by TLC according to the method of Häusler et al. (42Häusler A.

Murine and rat macrophages, RAW264.7 cells (a murine macrophage cell line; ATCC TIB-71), and L929 mouse fibroblast cells (7Brown G.D. Herre J. Williams D.L. Willement J.A. Marshall A.S.J. Gordon S.

Macrophage growth media were supplemented with 10–15% DMEM10/RPMI 1640 in which L929 cells had been grown for 5–7 days, to provide a source of macrophage colony-stimulating factor (45Botlz-Nitulescu G. Wiltschke C. Holzinger C. Fellinger A. Scheiner O. Gessl A. Foster O. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1987; 41: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Macrophages were distributed into tissue culture plates (Corning) or Chamber slides (Fisher) for phagocytosis assays. For RBMDM phagocytosis assays C. albicans cells were incubated with RBMDM at a 1:1 C. albicans: macrophage ratio for 30 min. Macrophage monolayers were stained with 0.1 mg/ml acridine orange for 90 s and 1 mg/ml crystal violet for 20 s (crystal violet quenches the acridine orange staining of noninternalized Candida cells) (46Lefkowitz S.S. Gelderman M.P. Lefkowitz D.L. Moguilevsky N. Bollen A. J. Infect. Dis. 1996; 173: 1202-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Phagocytosis was expressed as the percentage of macrophages containing one or more C. albicans yeast cells and as a phagocytic index (average number of C. albicans cells within each macrophage). For MBMDM and RAW264.7 adhesion/phagocytosis assays with live C. albicans, yeast cells were incubated with 20 μm FUN1 (Molecular Probes) for 1 h at 30 °C and added to MBMDM at a 20:1 C. albicans:macrophage ratio. After 1 h of incubation at 37 °C in air with 5% CO2, adhesion/phagocytosis was quantified by washing off nonadhered cells, lysing macrophages in Triton X-100, and then measuring fluorescence at excitation/emission of 485/538 nm in a Fluoroskan II fluorometer (Titertek). For adhesion/phagocytosis assays with heat-killed C albicans, cells were killed by heating for 1 h at 100 °C, washed in PBS, stained with Rhodamine green × (Molecular Probes) as described by the manufacturer, washed three times in PBS, and stored at 4 °C in PBS with 10 mm NaN3 until use.Nitrite Production by Macrophages—Nitrite production by RBMDM was detected with Greiss reagent (47Erwig L. Kluth D.C. Walsh G.M. Rees A.J. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 1983-1988PubMed Google Scholar) in 24-well tissue culture plates with DMEM10 growth medium with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Macrophages were stimulated with rat γ-interferon (R & D Systems, Abingdon, UK) for 24 h. After incubation with C. albicans, culture supernatants were removed and centrifuged to remove debris and cells, and the A540 of 50-μl samples was determined in an iEMS MF plate reader and compared with standard solutions of nitrite diluted in DMEM10 (46Lefkowitz S.S. Gelderman M.P. Lefkowitz D.L. Moguilevsky N. Bollen A. J. Infect. Dis. 1996; 173: 1202-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar).Ex Vivo Adherence Assay—The relative adherence of C. albicans strains for mouse splenic marginal zone macrophages was assayed as described previously (48Riesselman M.H. Kanbe T. Cutler J.E. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 145: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Fungal strains, including a wild type control (strain A9) used in other adherence studies, were grown in GYEP rotating (180 rpm) overnight at 37 °C. Each strain was transferred to fresh GYEP, incubated for 24 h under the same conditions, and then transferred once more to fresh medium and incubated for 24 h before harvesting and testing for adherence. Fungal cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed three times in sterile Dulbecco's PBS, and suspended in Dulbecco's PBS containing 5% fetal bovine serum. The final suspension of each was adjusted to 1.5 × 108 yeast cells/ml, and 0.1 ml of the suspension was overlaid at 4 °C onto each cryosection of mouse (female, BALB/c) splenic tissue and incubated at 4 °C for 15 min. The sections were fixed in cold 1.5% glutaraldehyde, washed in cold water, air-dried, and stained with crystal violet, and yeast cells' adherence to the tissue was assessed by bright field microscopy. Each fungal strain was tested on four cryosections, and the yeast adherence to the tissue sections was evaluated for all marginal zone areas of each tissue section. The marginal zones that were associated with yeast cells were scored in the range of 1+ (1–4 yeast cells/marginal zone) to 4+ (greater than 20 yeast cells/marginal zone).Virulence Tests—For mouse inoculation, C. albicans strains were shaken in NGY medium for 18–24hat30 °C. The harvested cells were washed twice in water and resuspended in saline to give an inoculum of 2.5–6.0 × 102 colony-forming units/g mouse body weight in a final volume of 100 μl. The inoculum was adjusted for different batches of DBA/2 mice to give consistent mean survival times for control strains. Inoculum concentrations were verified by viable counting. Groups of six or seven DBA/2 mice (Harlan Sera-Lab Ltd., Loughborough, UK) were inoculated intravenously with each strain. Mice weighed ∼20 g and were supplied with food and water ad libitum. Survival was monitored twice daily over 28 days. Animals that became seriously ill, showing hunched posture, ruffled fur, and reduced mobility, were humanely terminated, and their deaths were recorded as occurring on"

As humans have a second POMT, POMT2, we cloned each Drosophila ortholog of the human POMT genes and carried out RNA interference (RNAi) knock-down to investigate the function of these proteins in vivo. Drosophila POMT2 (dPOMT2) RNAi mutant flies showed a “twisted abdomen phenotype,” in which the abdomen is twisted 30–60°, similar to the dPOMT1 mutant. Moreover, dPOMT2 interacted genetically with dPOMT1, suggesting that the dPOMTs function in collaboration with each other in vivo. We expressed dPOMTs in Sf21 cells and measured POMT activity. dPOMT2 transferred a mannose to the dystroglycan protein only when it was coexpressed with dPOMT1. Likewise, dPOMT1 showed POMT activity only when coexpressed with dPOMT2, and neither dPOMT showed any activity by itself. Each dPOMT RNAi fly totally reduced POMT activity, despite the specific reduction in the level of each dPOMT mRNA. The expression pattern of dPOMT2 mRNA was found to be similar to that of dPOMT1 mRNA using whole mount in situ hybridization. These results demonstrate that the two dPOMTs function as a protein O-mannosyltransferase in association with each other, in vitro and in vivo, to generate and maintain normal muscle development.

Each dPOMT RNAi fly totally reduced POMT activity, despite the specific reduction in the level of each dPOMT mRNA. The expression pattern of dPOMT2 mRNA was found to be similar to that of dPOMT1 mRNA using whole mount in situ hybridization. These results demonstrate that the two dPOMTs function as a protein O-mannosyltransferase in association with each other, in vitro and in vivo, to generate and maintain normal muscle development. O-Mannosylation is an important modification of proteins in various fundamental physiological processes. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, O-linked oligomannose chains are required for the stability, correct localization, and/or function of proteins (1Ecker M. Mrsa V. Hagen I. Deutzmann R.

Yeast O-mannosylation is initiated in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum by a family of protein O-mannosyltransferases, PMT1–PMT6, 1The abbreviations used are: PMT and POMT, protein O-mannosyltransferase; h, human; d, Drosophila; POMGnT, protein O-mannose β1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase; Sia, sialic acid; α-DG, α-dystroglycan; RNAi, RNA interference; EST, expressed sequence tag; MGAT, mannose β1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase; IR, inverted repeat; UAS, upstream activating sequence; RpL32, ribosomal protein L32; ORF, open reading frame; HA, hemagglutinin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MES, 2-morpholinoethanesulfonic acid; PA, pyridylamine. which catalyze the transfer of Man from dolichylphosphate Man to Ser or Thr residues of secretory proteins (7Girrbach V.

The members of the PMT1 subfamily interact heterophilically with those of the PMT2 subfamily, whereas the single member of the PMT4 subfamily acts as a homophilic complex (7Girrbach V. Strahl S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12554-12562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Protein O-mannosyltransferase homologs have been identified in many multicellular eukaryotes such as Drosophila melanogaster, mouse, and human (10Martin-Blanco E. Garcia-Bellido A. Proc. Natl. Acad.

There are two human protein O-mannosyltransferase (POMT) homologs, hPOMT1 and hPOMT2, which belong to the PMT4 and PMT2 subfamilies, respectively (11Willer T. Amselgruber W. Deutzmann R. Strahl S. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 771-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Mutations in the hPOMT1 gene give rise to the severe neuronal migration disorder, Walker-Warburg syndrome (12Beltran-Valero de Bernabe D. Currier S. Steinbrecher A. Celli J. van Beusekom E. van der Zwaag B. Kayserili H. Merlini L. Chitayat D. Dobyns W.B. Cormand B. Lehesjoki A.E. Cruces J. Voit T. Walsh C.A. van Bokhoven H. Brunner H.G. Am. J. Hum.

Walker-Warburg syndrome is a recessive autosomal disorder characterized by congenital muscular dystrophy, severe brain malformation, and structural eye abnormalities. Muscle-eye-brain disease is also a recessive autosomal disorder characterized by congenital muscular dystrophy, brain malformation, and ocular abnormalities. Muscle-eye-brain disease is caused by mutations in the gene encoding UDP-N-acetylglucosamine:protein O-mannose β1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-1 (POMGnT1), contributing to the synthesis of the O-mannosylglycan, Siaα2–3Galβ1–4Glc-NAcβ1–2Manα1-Ser/Thr (13Endo T.

These findings indicate that the O-mannosylation of proteins plays an important role in vivo in making and/or maintaining neuronal and muscular tissues. Most recently, hPOMT1 and hPOMT2 were shown to have POMT activity corresponding to the first step in O-mannosylglycan synthesis only when coexpressed with each other (18Manya H. Chiba A. Yoshida A. Wang X. Chiba Y. Jigami Y. Margolis R.U. Endo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 500-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Drosophila has two POMT orthologs, dPOMT1 and dPOMT2, which correspond to human hPOMT1 and hPOMT2, respectively (11Willer T. Amselgruber W. Deutzmann R. Strahl S. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 771-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The dPOMT1 mutants are known to have reduced viability, whereas escaper flies show the so-called twisted abdomen phenotype that is caused by pronounced defects in muscle development (10Martin-Blanco E. Garcia-Bellido A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6048-6052Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The dPOMT1 gene was named after this phenotype as rotated abdomen (rt) (19Bridges C.D. Morgan T. The Third Chromosome Group of Mutant Characters of Drosophila melanogaster. Carnegie Institute of Washington, Washington, D. C.1923: 1-251Google Scholar). On the other hand, mutants of the dPOMT2 gene have not yet been isolated, and no biochemical report has documented the activities of both dPOMTs. In this study, we report the production of mutant flies by RNA interference (RNAi) of two Drosophila POMT genes, dPOMT1 and dPOMT2. Both of the RNAi mutant flies showed the same rt phenotypes as classical dPOMT1 mutants. Furthermore, genetic interaction analysis revealed a synergistic effect between these two mutations, suggesting that the two gene products function in the same genetic cascade. We also performed biochemical analyses to demonstrate that dPOMTs function as protein O-mannosyltransferase in association with each other. Reduction of in vivo POMT activity in each mutant fly also supports the heterophilic nature of these two enzymes. These data indicate that both dPOMT1 and dPOMT2 are required for functional POMT activity to contribute to normal muscle development in vivo. Materials—The Drosophila expressed sequence tag (EST) clones RE38203 (dPOMT1), LP01681 (dPOMT2), LD43357 (dMGAT1), and GH07804 (dMGAT2) were obtained from Research Genetics (Huntsville, AL). Dolichylphosphate [3H]Man (125,000 dpm/pmol) and UDP-[3H]GlcNAc (400,000 dpm/nmol) were supplied by American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc. (St. Louis, MO) and PerkinElmer Life Sciences, respectively. dPOMT1 and dPOMT2 RNAi Mutant Flies—The cDNA fragments corresponding to the N-terminal region (nucleotides 67–566 of the coding sequence) of dPOMT1 and the C-terminal region (nucleotides 792–1289) of dPOMT2 were amplified by PCR from EST clones RE38203 and LP01681, respectively, and inserted as an inverted repeat (IR) in a modified Bluescript vector, pSC1. IR-containing fragments were introduced into a transformation vector, pUAST. The cloning procedures will be described elsewhere. 2R. Ueda and K. Saigo, manuscript in preparation. Each of the UAS-dPOMT1-IR and UAS-dPOMT2-IR flies was mated with an Act5C-GAL4 fly, and F1 progeny were raised at 25 and 28 °C to observe phenotypes. Quantitative Analysis of dPOMT1 and dPOMT2 Transcripts by Real-time PCR—Total RNA was extracted from Act5C-GAL4/UAS-dPOMT1-IR third instar larvae raised at 25 °C and from Act5C-GAL4/UAS-dPOMT2-IR and Act5C-GAL4/w1118 larvae raised at 28 °C. We could not collect Act5C-GAL4/UAS-dPOMT1-IR larvae at 28 °C because of low viability. First-strand cDNA was synthesized by RevaTra Dash (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan), and real-time PCR of the dPOMT1 and dPOMT2 transcripts was carried out for the region except for the sequences using the IR construction for the RNAi fly. The gene-specific primers were as follows: dPOMT1, 5′-ACACCTGTGGCAACTGCTCT-AC-3′ (forward), 5′-ACTTATGGCATGCATCCATAGCT-3′ (reverse), and 5′-ACGCCGGTCTCACCGATCGC (probe); and dPOMT2, 5′-TTT-CCGGCCTTGATCTTCAA-3′ (forward), 5′-TGGGCAGAACCCTCAAA-ATG-3′ (reverse), and 5′-TCCTTGCTGACGGGCGTTATGTACAACT-3′ (probe). To normalize the efficiency of cDNA preparation among individual samples, the measurement of RpL32 mRNA in each cDNA was carried out using the following primers: RpL32, 5′-GCAAGCCCAAGG-GTATCGA-3′ (forward), 5′-CGATGTTGGGCATCAGATACTG-3′ (reverse), and 5′-AACAGAGTGCGTCGCCGCTTCA-3′ (probe). The probes were labeled at the 5′-end with the reporter dye 3-carboxyfluorescein and at the 3′-end with the quencher dye carboxytetramethylrhodamine (Nippon EGT, Toyama, Japan). Amplifications involved 40 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s and 60 °C for 4 min, performed with an ABI PRISM 7700 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). Vector Construction and Expression of dPOMT1 and dPOMT2 Proteins—The full-length open reading frames (ORFs) of dPOMT1 and dPOMT2 were expressed in insect cells according to the Invitrogen GATEWAY™ cloning technology instruction manual. The DNA fragments of dPOMT1 and dPOMT2 were amplified by two-step PCR. The first PCR used the plasmid DNA from EST clone RE38203 or LP01681 as a template for dPOMT1 or dPOMT2 amplification and the primer set of dPOMT1 (forward primer, 5′-AAAAAGCAGGCTTGTCTGCCACCT-ACACCA-3′; and reverse primer, 5′-AGAAAGCTGGGTAGTACAGGT-GGTGGTTCTTG-3′) or the primer set of dPOMT2 (forward primer, 5′-AAAAAGCAGGCTTGGCAGCAAGTGTTGTTA-3′; and reverse primer, 5′-AGAAAGCTGGGTCTAGAACTCCCAGGTAGAAAG-3′), respectively. The second PCR used the first PCR product as a template, forward primer 5′-GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCT-3′, and reverse primer 5′-GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGT-3′. The amplified fragments were recombined with the pDONR201™ vector (Invitrogen). Each insert was then transferred between the attR1 and attR2 sites of pVL1393g-HA or pVL1393g to yield pVL1393g-dPOMT1-HA or pVL1393g-dPOMT2, respectively. pVL1393g and pVL1393g-HA are expression vectors derived from pVL1393 (Invitrogen), and pVL1393g-HA contains a fragment encoding the three-HA peptide (YPYDVPDYA) at the C terminus. pVL1393-dPOMT1-HA and pVL1393-dPOMT2 were cotransfected with BaculoGold viral DNA (Pharmingen) into Sf21 insect cells according to the manufacturer's instructions, and the cells were incubated for 5 days at 27 °C to produce recombinant viruses. Sf21 cells were infected with each recombinant virus at a multiplicity of infection of 2.5 and incubated for 96 h to express dPOMT1-HA and dPOMT2 proteins. Preparation of Rabbit Anti-dPOMT2 Polyclonal Antibody—The N-terminal region (nucleotides 1–279 of the coding sequence) of dPOMT2 was amplified using a forward primer including the EcoRI site (underlined), 5′-GAATTCATGGCAGCAAGTGTTGTT-3′, and a reverse primer including the XhoI site, 5′-CTCGAGTTAGCCCATCTTGCCAA-AGTG-3′. The amplified fragment was digested with EcoRI and XhoI and subcloned into pGEX-6P-1 (Amersham Biosciences), an N-terminal glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion vector. A transformant of Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) was cultured to A600 = 0.6 at 37 °C and maintained in 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 20 °C for 18 h. The cells were sonicated and centrifuged, and then the supernatant was applied to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences). Eluted GST-fused dPOMT2 protein was injected into a New Zealand White rabbit. After four booster injections, the antiserum was used for Western blot analysis. Western Blot Analysis—The Sf21 cells expressing dPOMT1-HA and dPOMT2 were suspended in an 8 m urea solution, and 15 μg of each protein was subjected to 2–15% SDS-PAGE. The separated proteins were transferred to membranes, which were probed with peroxidase-conjugated anti-HA monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and rabbit anti-dPOMT2 polyclonal antibody and stained with HRP-1000 immunostain (Konica, Tokyo, Japan). Preparation of Cellular Microsomal Membrane Fraction and Larval Extracts—The infected cells were homogenized in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 250 mm sucrose, and 1 mm dithiothreitol with a protease inhibitor mixture (3 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm benzamidine-HCl, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl). After centrifugation at 900 × g for 10 min, the supernatant was subjected to ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The precipitate was used as the microsomal membrane fraction. Act5C-GAL4/UAS-dPOMT1-IR flies and Act5C-GAL4/UAS-dPOMT2-IR and Act5C-GAL4/w1118 flies were raised at 25 and 28 °C, respectively. Third instar larvae were homogenized in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm EDTA, and 0.5% n-octyl-β-d-thioglucoside (Dojindo Laboratories, Kumamoto, Japan) with the protease inhibitor mixture (400 μl for every 20 larvae). The supernatant was obtained by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h and used as larval extract. The protein concentration was determined by BCA assay. Assay of POMT Activity—The POMT activity was based on the amount of [3H]Man transferred to GST-α-DG as described previously (18Manya H. Chiba A. Yoshida A. Wang X. Chiba Y. Jigami Y. Margolis R.U. Endo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 500-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Briefly, the reaction mixture contained 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 nm dolichylphosphate [3H]Man (125,000 dpm/pmol), 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% n-octyl-β-d-thioglucoside, 10 μg of GST-α-DG, and enzyme source (40 μg of total protein from the larval extract or 80 μg of microsomal membrane fraction from infected cells) in a total volume of 20 μl. After a 1-h incubation at 22 °C, the reaction was stopped by adding 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (130 mm NaCl, 7 mm Na2HPO4, and 3 mm NaH2PO4) containing 1% Triton X-100 (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan), and the reaction mixture was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was removed, mixed with 400 μl of phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100 and 10 μlof glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads, rotated at 4 °C for 1 h, and washed three times with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 0.5% Triton X-100. The radioactivity adsorbed by the beads was measured using a liquid scintillation counter. α-Mannosidase Digestion of Mannosyl-GST-α-DG—To characterize the linkage of the mannosyl residue, the radioactive products absorbed to the glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads were incubated with jack bean α-mannosidase (0.8 units; Seikagaku Corp., Tokyo) in 50 μl of 0.1 m ammonium acetate buffer (pH 4.5) containing 1 mm ZnCl2 at 37 °C. Jack bean α-mannosidase (0.8 units) was added freshly every 20 h and was incubated for up to 60 h. Inactivated jack bean α-mannosidase, prepared by heating the enzyme at 100 °C for 5 min, was used as a control. After incubation, the radioactivities of the supernatant and beads were measured using a liquid scintillation counter. Whole Mount in Situ Hybridization—The BglII-EcoRI-digested fragment of dPOMT1 and the Ecl136II-NotI-digested fragment of dPOMT2 were subcloned into pBluescript SK– (Stratagene) digested by BamHI-EcoRI and SmaI-NotI, respectively. The above templates were linearized and transcribed in vitro by T3 or T7 RNA polymerase with a digoxigenin RNA labeling mixture (Roche Applied Science). Each transcript was treated with an alkaline solution containing 80 mm NaHCO3, 120 mm Na2CO3, and 10 mm dithiothreitol for reduction to ∼300 bases as a digested RNA probe. Fixed CantonS embryos were hybridized overnight at 55 °C with the digoxigenin-labeled probes in 50% formamide, 5× SSC (1× SSC = 150 mm NaCl and 15 mm sodium citrate), 100 μg/ml heparin, 0.1% Tween 20, 20 μg/ml yeast RNA, 20 μg/ml heat-denatured salmon sperm DNA, and 10 mm dithiothreitol. After hybridization, the embryos were washed with 50% formamide, 5× SSC, and 0.1% Tween 20 for 20 min. The process of washing was continued by serial dilution from 50% formamide, 5× SSC, and 0.1% Tween 20 to phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20. Detection was carried out by immunoassay using an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin antibody Fab′ fragment (Roche Applied Science). Construction and Purification of dMGAT1 and dMGAT2 Proteins— The ORFs of dMGAT1 and dMGAT2 were expressed in Sf21 insect cells by GATEWAY™ cloning technology as described above. The cDNA fragments of dMGAT1 and dMGAT2 were amplified from EST clones LD43357 and GH07804 using the primer set of dMGAT1 (forward primer, 5′-AAAAAGCAGGCTTCCATACGAGCCGGCATCAG-3′; and reverse primer, 5′-AGAAAGCTGGGTTACTCTGTCCTTAGCGTCGT-3′) and the primer set of dMGAT2 (forward primer, 5′-AAAAAGCAG-GCTCCACCCTGCACAAGTATCTG-3′; and reverse primer, 5′-AGAA-AGCTGGGTGCCTTACCTCGTGGCCAG-3′), respectively. The fragments amplified by two-step PCR were recombined with the pDONR201™ vector, and the inserts were transferred to yield pVL-FLAG-dMGAT1 and pVL-FLAG-dMGAT2, respectively. pVL-FLAG is an expression vector derived from pVL1393 containing the signal sequence of human immunoglobulin κ (MHFQVQIFSFLLISASVIMSRG) and the FLAG peptide (DYKDDDDK) at the N terminus. pVL-FLAG-dMGAT1 and pVL-FLAG-dMGAT2 were transfected into Sf21 cells using the same method as described above. The culture medium of each infected cell containing FLAG-dMGAT1 or FLAG-dMGAT2 recombinant protein was applied to anti-FLAG antibody M1 affinity gel (Sigma). The purified proteins were quantified by Western blotting using anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody as a standard of FLAG-BAP™ control protein (Sigma). Assay for POMGnT Activity—The level of POMGnT activity was based on the amount of [3H]GlcNAc transferred to a mannosylpeptide (Ac-Ala-Ala-Pro-(Thr/Man)-Pro-Val-Ala-Ala-Pro-NH2) as described previously (20Takahashi S. Sasaki T. Manya H. Chiba Y. Yoshida A. Mizuno M. Ishida H. Ito F. Inazu T. Kotani N. Takasaki S. Takeuchi M. Endo T. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Briefly, the reaction mixture contained 140 mm MES (pH 7.0), 400 μm UDP-[3H]GlcNAc (400,000 dpm/nmol), 400 μm mannosylpeptide, 10 mm MnCl2, 2% Triton X-100, 5 mm AMP, 200 mm GlcNAc, 10% glycerol, and 50 μg of microsomal membrane fraction in a total volume of 50 μl. After a 2-h incubation at 37 °C, the peptide was separated on a Wakopak 5C18-200 column (4.6 × 250 mm; Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Osaka). Solvent A was 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in distilled water, and solvent B was 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile. The peptide was eluted at a flow rate of 1 ml/min using a linear gradient of 1–25% solvent B. The peptide separation was monitored continuously at 214 nm, and the radioactivity of each fraction was measured using a liquid scintillation counter. Assay for β1,2-N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferase I and II Activities— The β1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I activity was measured as follows. The reaction mixture contained 100 mm MES (pH 6.0), 100 mm GlcNAc, 5 mm AMP, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 20 mm MnCl2, 1 mm UDP-GlcNAc, 10 μm pyridylaminated oligosaccharide, 0.5% Triton X-100, and recombinant enzyme in a total volume of 20 μl. The pyridylaminated acceptor oligosaccharide Manα1–6(Manα1–3)Manα1–6(Manα1–3)Manβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–4GlcNAc-PA (PA017) was obtained from Takara Shuzo (Otsu, Japan). After a 2-h incubation at 37 °C, the product was separated on a Cosmosil 5C18-AR column (4.6 × 250 mm; Nacalai Tesque). The solvent was 0.15% 1-butanol in 100 mm ammonium acetate (pH 6.0). The product was eluted at a rate of 1.2 ml/min at 45 °C by isocratic elution and was detected by fluorescence of the PA (excitation at 320 nm and emission at 400 nm). The β1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase II activity was measured as follows. The reaction mixture contained 50 mm MES (pH 6.0) 100 mm GlcNAc, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm AMP, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 20 mm MnCl2,1mm UDP-GlcNAc, 10 μm pyridylaminated oligosaccharide, 1% Triton X-100, and recombinant enzyme in a total volume of 10 μl. The acceptor oligosaccharide Manα1–6(GlcNAcβ1–2Manα1–3)Manβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–4GlcNAc-PA (PA100.2) was obtained from Seikagaku Corp. After a 2-h incubation at 37 °C, the product was separated as described above, except that the temperature was 50 °C. Comparison of the PMT Family of Protein O-Mannosyltransferases—We performed a BLAST search of all Drosophila data bases using hPOMT1 and hPOMT2 as queries and obtained two Drosophila POMT genes, dPOMT1 and dPOMT2, whose Drosophila EST clones are RE38203 and LP01681, respectively. RE38203 contains a 2658-bp ORF encoding a dPOMT1 protein of 886 amino acids (GenBank™/EBI accession number AB176550), and LP01681 contains a 2295-bp ORF encoding a dPOMT2 protein of 765 amino acids (GenBank™/EBI accession number AB176551) (11Willer T. Amselgruber W. Deutzmann R. Strahl S. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 771-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). A ClustalW alignment of dPOMT1 and dPOMT2 showed 42 and 52% homology to hPOMT1 and hPOMT2, respectively (Fig. 1, A and C). Hydrophobicity analyses of the amino acid sequences revealed that dPOMT1 and dPOMT2 are type III transmembrane proteins with nine and seven transmembrane domains, respectively (Fig. 1, B and D).Fig. 1Comparison ofDrosophila, human, andS. cerevisiaePOMTs.A and C, ClustalW alignment of the Drosophila and human POMT1 and POMT2 amino acid sequences, respectively.

The branch lengths indicate amino acid substitutions per site.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The PMT family of protein O-mannosyltransferases was vastly conserved from yeast to human in eukaryotes and is classified into three subfamilies, PMT1, PMT2, and PMT4. A phylogenetic tree of the representative PMT families, six S. cerevisiae Pmt proteins (Pmt1–Pmt6), two human POMTs (hPOMT1 and hPOMT2), and two Drosophila POMTs (dPOMT1 and dPOMT2), indicates that dPOMT1 and hPOMT1 are in the PMT4 subfamily and that dPOMT2 and hPOMT2 are in the PMT2 subfamily (Fig. 1E). It is characteristic that only a few members of the PMT families are found in invertebrates and vertebrates. dPOMT1 and dPOMT2 RNAi Mutant Flies—To obtain information about the function of dPOMT1 and dPOMT2 in vivo,we tried to make RNAi mutant flies using the GAL4-UAS-IR system. The Act5C-GAL4 fly has a transgene containing the yeast transcription factor GAL4, the expression of which is under the control of the cytoplasmic actin promoter. We used Act5C-GAL4 as a GAL4 driver fly to induce dPOMT1 and dPOMT2 gene silencing in all cells and at all developmental stages of the fly. The Act5C-GAL4/UAS-dPOMT1-IR fly showed a viability of 19% at 25 °C, but 0% at 28 °C. RNAi knockdown is more effective at 28 °C because of the temperature dependence of the GAL4-UAS expression system. Meanwhile, the Act5C-GAL4/UAS-dPOMT2-IR fly revealed a viability of 63% even at 28 °C. F1 escapers of Act5C-GAL4/UAS-dPOMT1-IR showed a clockwise twisted abdomen phenotype, after which the gene was named rotated abdomen (rt). Interestingly, all escaper flies of Act5C-GAL4/UAS-dPOMT2-IR also exhibited the same phenotype, suggesting that these two POMT genes function with strong interaction in muscle development in the fly (Fig. 2). The transcript levels of third instar larvae of each inducible dPOMT1 and dPOMT2 RNAi fly were determined by real-time PCR. The dPOMT1 transcript level of the Act5C-GAL4/UAS-dPOMT1-IR RNAi fly raised at 25 °C was 32% of that of the Act5C-GAL4/+ control fly (Fig. 3A). The dPOMT2 transcript level of the Act5C-GAL4/UAS-dPOMT2-IR fly raised at 28 °C was 21% (Fig. 3B). However, in each of these two mutant flies, the expression of non-targeted genes was not influenced at all (Fig. 3, A and B). These results, indicating that expression of each gene was specifically suppressed by RNAi, led to the conclusion that the same twisted abdomen phenotype of these mutants was caused by the reduction in each transcript. It was revealed that the transcript level of dPOMT2 was more reduced by RNAi, whereas the mutant fly showed less lethality compared with that of dPOMT1. This discrepancy might come from their independent and unknown functions in development. Genetic Interaction between dPOMT1 and dPOMT2—The same phenotype of dPOMT1 and dPOMT2 RNAi flies suggests an intimate genetic interaction in muscle development. If so, the double mutant of dPOMT1 and dPOMT2 should have a synergistic effect on the phenotype. To test this possibility, first, we combined one copy of the dPOMT1 mutation with the dPOMT2 RNAi mutant allele. To do this, the Act5C-GAL4/SM1;UAS-dPOMT2-IR/TM6B fly was crossed with the +/+; rtP/TM3 fly. Progenies of this cross were reared at 18 °C. RNAi knockdown is so weak at this temperature that the Act5C-GAL4/+;UAS-dPOMT2-IR/TM3 fly showed no aberrant phenotype (Fig. 4C). Also, one copy of the dPOMT1 mutation (rtP) gave no twisted abdomen phenotype because of the recessive character of this allele (Fig. 4B). However, the resulting Act5C-GAL4/+;rtP/UAS-dPOMT2-IR fly showed a clear twisted abdomen phenotype (Fig. 4A), i"

https://openalex.org/W2078260245,"Interferon-γ (IFN-γ) is a multifunctional cytokine that defines the development of Th1 cells and is critical for host defense against intracellular pathogens. IL-2 is another key immunoregulatory cytokine that is involved in T helper differentiation and is known to induce IFN-γ expression in natural killer (NK) and T cells. Despite concerted efforts to identify the one or more transcriptional control mechanisms by which IL-2 induces IFN-γ mRNA expression, no such genomic regulatory regions have been described. We have identified a DNase I hypersensitivity site ∼3.5-4.0 kb upstream of the transcriptional start site. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays we found constitutive histone H3 acetylation in this distal region in primary human NK cells, which is enhanced by IL-2 treatment. This distal region is also preferentially acetylated on histones H3 and H4 in primary Th1 cells as compared with Th2 cells. Within this distal region we found a Stat5-like motif, and in vitro DNA binding assays as well as in vivo chromosomal immunoprecipitation assays showed IL-2-induced binding of both Stat5a and Stat5b to this distal element in the IFNG gene. We examined the function of this Stat5-binding motif by transfecting human peripheral blood mononuclear cells with -3.6 kb of IFNG-luciferase constructs and found that phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin-induced transcription was augmented by IL-2 treatment. The effect of IL-2 was lost when the Stat5 motif was disrupted. These data led us to conclude that this distal region serves as both a target of chromatin remodeling in the IFNG locus as well as an IL-2-induced transcriptional enhancer that binds Stat5 proteins.

NK cells are a major early source of IFN-γ in vivo, and T cell expression of IFN-γ is generally restricted as T helper 1 (Th1) cells (1Szabo S.J. Sullivan B.M. Peng S.L. Glimcher L.H. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 21: 713-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). These cell types and their predominate cytokine IFN-γ are intimately involved in protection against intracellular pathogens and the development of tumors (2Agnello D. Lankford C.S. Bream J. Morinobu A. Gadina M. O'Shea J.J. Frucht D.M. J. Clin. Immunol. 2003; 23: 147-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). This is evident in humans with gene mutations that interfere with IFN-γ signaling, including the IFN-γ receptor (3Jouanguy E. Altare F. Lamhamedi S. Revy P. Emile J.F. Newport M. Levin M. Blanche S. Seboun E. Fischer A. Casanova J.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 335: 1956-1961Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar) and Stat1 (4Dupuis S. Jouanguy E. Al Hajjar S. Fieschi C. Al Mohsen I.Z. Al Jumaah S. Yang K. Chapgier A. Eidenschenk C. Eid P. Al Ghonaium A. Tufenkeji H. Frayha H. Al Gazlan S. Al Rayes H. Schreiber R.D. Gresser I. Casanova J.L. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 388-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar) as well as in IFN-γ-deficient mice (5Dalton D.K. Pitts-Meek S. Keshav S. Figari I.S. Bradley A. Stewart T.A. Science. 1993; 259: 1739-1742Crossref PubMed Scopus (1499) Google Scholar), which are highly susceptible to infectious agents and prone to certain cancers. In contrast, circumstances in which IFN-γ is overproduced or its effects fail to induce negative feedback loops lead to widespread pathology (6Young H.A. Klinman D.M. Reynolds D.A. Grzegorzewski K.J. Nii A. Ward J.M. Winkler-Pickett R.T. Ortaldo J.R. Kenny J.J. Komschlies K.L. Blood. 1997; 89: 583-595Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Not surprisingly, IFN-γ expression patterns are tightly regulated in a tissue-specific manner by precise induction signals. Much effort has focused on characterizing the proximal IFNG promoter and intervening sequences in an effort to identify potential regulatory regions that are responsible for signal- and cell-specific control of gene expression. This approach has been useful in defining putative regulatory regions near the core IFNG promoter. It is notable, however, that regions proximal to the IFNG gene fail to explain tissue-specific patterns of IFN-γ expression as evidenced by transgenic mice expressing only the proximal IFNG promoter linked to a reporter gene (7Aune T.M. Penix L.A. Rincon M.R. Flavell R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 8Soutto M. Zhou W. Aune T.M. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 6664-6667Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In addition, transgenic mice that contain the full-length human IFNG gene and ∼2.7 kb of upstream sequence have similar signal-specific regulatory patterns to the endogenous gene, yet the responses are relatively weak (8Soutto M. Zhou W. Aune T.M. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 6664-6667Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that regions more distal from the core IFNG promoter are involved in determining tissue-specific and optimal signal-specific expression of IFN-γ (9Zhu H. Yang J. Murphy T.L. Ouyang W. Wagner F. Saparov A. Weaver C.T. Murphy K.M. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 855-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In naïve T cells, induction signals for activation and IFN-γ expression are provided optimally through T cell receptor (TCR) and co-stimulatory receptor (CD28) engagement (10Ho I.C. Glimcher L.H. Cell. 2002; 109: S109-S120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Following primary activation, differentiation of effector CD4+ T helper (Th) cell populations occurs over several days and is directed in large part by cytokines such as IL-2, IL-4, and IL-12 (11Murphy K.M. Reiner S.L. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 933-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar). Not only do IL-2 and IL-12 induce Th1 cell development, they also directly induce expression of IFN-γ. This is most apparent in NK cells, because no preceding activation/differentiation signals are required for cytokine responsiveness and transactivation of the IFNG gene (12Biron C.A. Nguyen K.B. Pien G.C. Cousens L.P. Salazar-Mather T.P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 189-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar). Therefore, NK cell models offer an advantage in studying regulation of IFN-γ expression by isolating the effects of autonomous cytokine receptor signaling events. IL-12 acts via the transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription 4 (Stat4) that is thought to mediate trans-activation of the IFNG gene by binding to sequence motifs therein or enhancing the binding of AP-1 to the core IFNG promoter (13Nakahira M. Ahn H.J. Park W.R. Gao P. Tomura M. Park C.S. Hamaoka T. Ohta T. Kurimoto M. Fujiwara H. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 1146-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The requirement of Stat4 in regulating IFN-γ is underscored in Stat4-/- T cells and NK cells that are refractory to IL-12-induced IFN-γ expression. In both mice (14Nguyen K.B. Watford W.T. Salomon R. Hofmann S.R. Pien G.C. Morinobu A. Gadina M. O'Shea J.J. Biron C.A. Science. 2002; 297: 2063-2066Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar) and humans (15Barbulescu K. Becker C. Schlaak J.F. Schmitt E. Meyer Zum Buschenfelde K.H. Neurath M.F. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 3642-3647PubMed Google Scholar), 2Morinobu, A., Kanno, Y., and O'Shea, J. J. (2004) J. Biol. Chem.279, 40640-40646. 2Morinobu, A., Kanno, Y., and O'Shea, J. J. (2004) J. Biol. Chem.279, 40640-40646. Stat4 has been shown to interact with the IFNG gene in the proximal promoter and/or first intron (16Xu X. Sun Y.L. Hoey T. Science. 1996; 273: 794-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 17Gonsky R. Deem R.L. Young H.A. Targan S.R. Eur. J. Immunol. 2003; 33: 1152-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). These elements are based on non-consensus STAT motifs, and their functional role is still not firmly established. Additionally, the human intronic STAT binding region is not present in murine genomic DNA, suggesting its importance in regulating IFNG gene expression may be a recent evolutionary event. Despite concentrated efforts and that fact that IFN-γ is highly regulated by cytokines, the identification of functional STAT binding elements in the IFNG gene has proved to be challenging. In the case of IL-2, the exact mechanisms by which this cytokine regulates IFN-γ have been surprisingly neglected, despite reports dating to 1983 indicating that IL-2 induces IFN-γ expression (18Kasahara T. Hooks J.J. Dougherty S.F. Oppenheim J.J. J. Immunol. 1983; 130: 1784-1789PubMed Google Scholar, 19Farrar W.L. Ruscetti F.W. Young H.A. J. Immunol. 1985; 135: 1551-1554PubMed Google Scholar, 20Reem G.H. Yeh N.H. Science. 1984; 225: 429-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). IL-2 is an important factor in the differentiation of both Th1 and Th2 cells (11Murphy K.M. Reiner S.L. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 933-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar). Accordingly, this cytokine is routinely added to in vitro culture systems to enhance Th cell development and is thought to act via Stat5 (21Zhu J. Cote-Sierra J. Guo L. Paul W.E. Immunity. 2003; 19: 739-748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). In IFN-γ-secreting cells, induction of IFN-γ mRNA by IL-2 is rapid and occurs at the level of transcription, as demonstrated by nuclear run-on analysis. The induction occurs in the presence of cycloheximide, indicating that protein synthesis is not necessary for the induction of transcription (22Young H.A. Birchenall-Sparks M. Kovacs E. Dorman L. Ruscetti F.W. J. Interferon Res. 1988; 8: 527-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Although IL-2 has long been associated with IFN-γ expression, the molecular mechanisms involved are still unknown. In this report, we identify and characterize a distal region of the IFNG gene that is a target for cytokine-driven epigenetic modifications, which correlate with competency of tissue-specific IFN-γ expression profiles. Contained within this same region is a distal cis-acting element that binds Stat5 proteins and enhances transcription of the IFNG promoter in an IL-2-dependent fashion. These data indicate that this distal 5′-flanking region of the IFNG gene is a critical part of the functional IFNG gene and provides the first indication of the molecular mechanisms involved in IL-2 regulation of IFN-γ expression. Antibodies and Cytokines—Antibodies directed against Stat5a, Stat5b, and Stat3 were purchased from R&D Systems and were used in supershift analyses as well as chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Recombinant human IL-2 was obtained from Hoffmann-La Roche. Recombinant mouse IL-12 was generously provided by Genetics Institute (Cambridge, MA). Recombinant human IL-4 was purchased from R&D Systems. Anti-CD3ϵ, anti-CD28, anti-IL-4, anti-IL-12, and anti-IFN-γ antibodies were purchased from BD Pharmingen. Anti-acetylated H3, anti-acetylated H4, and normal rabbit IgG were from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Tissue Culture—NK92 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 200 units/ml recombinant human IL-2, and 10 ng/ml recombinant human IL-15. Cells were cultured to a density of 5 × 105/ml in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2. Prior to stimulation, NK92 cells were starved overnight in medium containing 2% FCS, 2 mml-glutamine, and 100 units/ml of penicillin-streptomycin (starvation medium). Human PBMC were isolated from healthy volunteers over Ficoll-Hypaque, and for T cell differentiation studies, naïve CD4+ T cells were purified with the human CD4+/45RO- naïve T cell subset column kit or human CD4+ T cell subset column kit (both from R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) followed by positive selection using CD45RA beads (Mylteni Biotec Inc., Auburn, CA). Purity was typically >90%. Cells were stimulated with plate-bound anti-CD3 (10 μg/ml) plus anti-CD28 (5 μg/ml) Abs and IL-2 (50 units/ml) for 3 days, and expanded in a new flask for a further 3 days with exogenous IL-2. To generate Th1 cells, IL-12 (10 ng/ml) was added throughout the culture period and anti-IL-4 Ab (10 μg/ml) was added for the first 3 days. For Th2 cells, IL-4 (25 ng/ml) was added throughout the culture period, and anti-IL-12 Ab (5 μg/ml) was added for the first 3 days. Promoter Cloning and Reporter Constructs—Human genomic DNA (200 ng) was used as a template for all PCR reactions in 10- to 50-μl volumes. The full -3.662 kb to +38 bp IFNG 5′-flanking region was amplified in 10-μl PCR reactions containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 200 μm each of dATP, dGTP, dTTP, 80 ng of each oligonucleotide primer, and 1.5 units of High Fidelity Taq polymerase (Invitrogen). The primers used to amplify the -3.662 to +38 region are as follows with the MluI linkers underlined: 5′-GTA CGC GTG TGG AAA CAA GTG CAA AAC G-3′ and 5′-GTA CGC GTC TAA TAG CTG ATC TTC AGA TG-3′. For amplification of the -3.6-kb fragment, the conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 5 min, then 30 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 60 °C for 60 s, and extension at 68 °C for 5 min. These PCR reactions were performed using a Hybaid Touchdown thermal cycler (Hybaid Limited, UK). The -3.6-kb IFNG upstream region was amplified from genomic DNA with MluI linkers and ligated into a TA vector (Invitrogen). Following MluI and PvuI double digestion, the -3.6-kb insert was extracted from the 0.8% agarose gel, purified, and ligated into the PGL3 Basic Luciferase vector (Promega, Madison, WI). Restriction digests revealed clones with a 5′ to 3′ orientation, and sequencing confirmed the STAT element. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on the -3.6-kb IFNG-Luc construct to disrupt the Stat5 motif from TTCAAGGAA to TTCAACCTT. DNA sequencing confirmed the mutagenesis. The mutations introduced in the Stat5 element are the same as those used in EMSA experiments, which failed to bind IL-2-induced Stat5 proteins and do not complete for Stat5 binding by excess cold competition. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Complementary single-stranded oligonucleotides were commercially synthesized (Invitrogen) to span ∼10 bp on either side of the Stat element (in bold). Another oligonucleotide with a 4-bp mutation in the Stat site (underlined) was made, and the sequences are as follows: 5′-AGT TAT TAG AAA TTT CAA GGA AGT GAC AAC AGA G-3′ (Stat WT) and 5′-AGT TAT TAG AAA TTT CAACCT TGT GAC AAC AGA G-3′ (Stat Mutant). Complementary strands were annealed by combining 2 μg of each oligonucleotide and 6 μl of 10× annealing buffer (500 mm Tris, 100 mm MgCl2, and 50 mm dithiothreitol) in a 60-μl reaction, denatured in a boiling water bath for 5 min, and then allowed to cool to room temperature. Double-stranded DNA overhangs were labeled with Klenow enzyme by a fill-in reaction, [α-32P]dCTP and free dNTPs (Amersham Biosciences). The DNA-protein binding reaction was conducted in a 20-μl reaction mixture consisting of 5-10 μg of nuclear protein extract, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Sigma), 4 μl of 5× binding buffer (60 mm Hepes, 7.5 mm MgCl2, 300 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 50% glycerol, and 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride) and 1.5 × 104 cpm of 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe. For supershift analysis to identify Stat proteins interacting with the IFNG promoter, 1 μl of antibody was added to the reaction prior to the addition of the probes and incubated on ice for 20 min. In cold oligonucleotide competition experiments, 10- to 100-fold excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide probe was added 10 min prior to adding the radiolabeled oligonucleotide probe. Cytoplasmic and Nuclear Extraction—Nuclear extracts were prepared from PHA-stimulated human peripheral blood T cells or NK cells, as described previously (23Bream J.H. Ping A. Zhang X. Winkler C. Young H.A. Genes Immun. 2002; 3: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Briefly, following no stimulation (NS) or treatment with cytokines for 30-60 min, cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm KCl, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 100 μm dithiothreitol) and subsequently incubated on ice for 5 min. Cellular suspensions were collected by centrifugation at 2,000 rpm, and the supernatant was harvested as the cytoplasmic protein fraction. Nuclei were washed in wash buffer (lysis buffer without Nonidet P-40) and harvested by centrifugation at 2,000 rpm. Nuclear pellets were resuspended in extraction buffer (500 mm KCl, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 5% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 100 μm dithiothreitol), frozen in dry ice, thawed slowly on ice, and finally centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was harvested, and nuclear proteins were quantified with the bicinchoninic acid protein assay reagent (Pierce). Transfection Assays—PBMCs were transfected following overnight culture in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FCS with or without 10-100 units/ml rhIL-2 (Chiron Therapeutics, Emeryville, CA). Cells were then washed and resuspended in 250 μl of fresh medium at 2 × 107 cells/ml and electroporated in the presence of 50 μg of reporter construct (600 V, for 9 pulses of 500 μs, with 100 μs between pulses) using 4-mm (gap width) cuvettes in a BTX Electro Square Porator ECM 830 (Genetronics, Inc., San Diego, CA). A control plasmid containing the β-actin promoter driving a Renilla luciferase (provided by Dr. Christopher Wilson, University of Washington) was co-transfected as an internal standard, and values were normalized to correct for transfection efficiency (generally 30-50%). After electroporation the cells were diluted in fresh medium, allowed to rest for 1 h prior to plating, and then stimulated with 20 ng/ml PMA plus 400 nm calcium ionophore for 4 h. Luminescence was measured using a Promega luciferase assay kit and counted on a six-detector PerkinElmer Life Sciences 1450 Microbeta liquid scintillation counter with coincidence counting deactivated. Nuclei Isolation and DNase I Hypersensitivity Analysis—NK92 cells were rested in RPMI medium plus 10% FCS without IL-2 and IL-15 for 12 h. Approximately 100 × 106 cells were used for each stimulation. The cells were stimulated with IL-2 (100 units/ml) and IL-12 (10 units/ml) alone and in combination for 1 h. For nuclei isolation NK92 cells were spun at 600 × g, washed once in 1× phosphate-buffered saline, and spun again. The cell pellet was resuspended in 3 ml of cold lysis buffer consisting of 0.35 m sucrose, 60 mm KCl, 15 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 15 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.6% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.15 mm spermine, 0.5 mm spermidine and incubated on ice for 5 min. The lysate was spun at 800 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The nuclear pellet was washed twice in 2 ml of nuclei wash buffer (lysis buffer without Nonidet P-40) and spun at 800 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The nuclei were resuspended in 500 μl of nuclei storage buffer consisting of 60 mm KCl, 15 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 75 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, glycerol (40% by vol.), 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.15 mm spermidine, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and stored at -70 °C until needed. Nuclei were spun at 800 × g and resuspended in a nuclease digest buffer consisting of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm CaCl2. The nuclei were digested with increasing concentrations of DNase I (Roche Applied Science) that ranged from 0 to 0.4 unit per reaction for 10 min at 37 °C. The DNase digestion was stopped by the addition of an equal volume of stop solution consisting of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, 0.6 m NaCl, 1% SDS, and 400 μg/ml proteinase K, and the digests were incubated at 55 °C for overnight. The genomic DNA was purified from each reaction by phenol/chloroform and subsequent ethanol precipitation. The precipitated DNA was resuspended in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and quantitated by optical density. Approximately 20 μg of DNase-treated DNA was digested with HindIII and separated by size on a 0.8% agarose gel using 1 × TBE (Tris/borate/EDTA) buffer. The DNA was transferred to a nylon membrane, and Southern analysis was performed using a 32P-labeled human IFN-γ-specific XcmI-HindIII DNA fragment as the probe. The DNase I hypersensitivity sites were visualized by exposing the blot to x-ray film for 24-36 h. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assays—ChIP assays were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY). Briefly, 2 × 106 cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde, washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in buffer containing 10 μg/ml aprotinin (ICN Biomedicals, Aurora, OH), 10 μg/ml leupeptin (Bachem, Torrance, CA), and 2.5 μm 4-nitrophenyl 4-guanidinobenzoate hydrochloride (Sigma). Nuclei were sonicated for a total of 60 s to shear DNA (Heat Systems, Farmingdale, NY), the lysates were pelleted, and supernatants were diluted. Diluted lysates were pre-cleared with salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose for 30 min prior to immunoprecipitation with specified antibodies. A proportion (2%) of the diluted supernatant was kept as “input” to quantify genomic DNA. After immunoprecipitation, the protein-DNA complexes were incubated with Protein A beads, and the protein-DNA complexes were eluted in 1% SDS/0.1 m NaHCO3, and cross-links were reversed at 65 °C. DNA was recovered by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation then subjected to PCR and/or real-time PCR analysis. PCR was carried out with AmpliTaq Gold (Applied Biosystems) for 35 cycles (40 s at 95 °C, 40 s at 59 °C, and 40 s at 72 °C), and the products were visualized by ethidium bromide staining. The immunoprecipitated DNA samples were normalized to “input” DNA samples. PCR primers for the distal IFNG promoter were as follows: 5′-GTTTCACTGCCAGTCTGG-3′ and 5′-ACTACACCCTATCAGGCTTTA-3′; primers for the proximal IFNG promoter region were 5′-GTTTCACTGCCAGTCTGG-3′ and 5′-ACTACACCCTATCAGGCTTTA-3′. Ribonuclease Protection Assay—RNase protection assays (RPA) were performed according to the manufacturer's specifications (Ambion, Austin, TX) with ∼5 μg of RNA per reaction. RNA hybridization products were separated by size on a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. IL-2 Induces the Expression of IFN-γ mRNA—The process of Th cell differentiation is complicated and involves diverse extracellular signals through multiple classes of receptors, including the T cell receptor (TCR), co-stimulatory molecules, and cytokine receptors (1Szabo S.J. Sullivan B.M. Peng S.L. Glimcher L.H. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 21: 713-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar, 2Agnello D. Lankford C.S. Bream J. Morinobu A. Gadina M. O'Shea J.J. Frucht D.M. J. Clin. Immunol. 2003; 23: 147-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 11Murphy K.M. Reiner S.L. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 933-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar). This process typically: 1) occurs over an extended period of time (5-10 days), 2) seems to occur with cell division (24Reiner S.L. Mullen A.C. Hutchins A.S. Pearce E.L. Immunol. Res. 2003; 27: 463-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), and 3) includes IL-2 in the cultures, either endogenously produced by T cells and/or by exogenous addition. We wanted to isolate the effects of IL-2 on IFNG gene regulation per se from the process of Th cell differentiation. Thus, we have primarily used fresh NK cells and an NK cell line (NK92) as a model to study cytokine-induced epigenetic and transcriptional modifications to the IFNG gene. We first confirmed that IL-2 treatment of NK92 cells leads to IFN-γ mRNA expression (Fig. 1A). Strong IFN-γ mRNA expression in NK92 was evident at 3 h and was slightly diminished after 6 h of IL-2 treatment. Our group and others have also reported that co-treatment of activated T cells or NK cells with IL-2 and IL-12 leads to a highly synergistic effect on IFN-γ expression (25Bream J.H. Curiel R.E. Yu C.R. Egwuagu C.E. Grusby M.J. Aune T.M. Young H.A. Blood. 2003; 102: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 26Chan S.H. Perussia B. Gupta J.W. Kobayashi M. Pospisil M. Young H.A. Wolf S.F. Young D. Clark S.C. Trinchieri G. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 173: 869-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar). A time course experiment was performed on NK92 cells under IL-2, IL-12, and IL-2 plus IL-12 conditions to confirm these data (Fig. 1B). The results confirm that IL-2 and IL-12 induce IFN-γ mRNA expression rapidly and when added together, synergistically induce IFN-γ transcripts. These data are similar to what was observed in activated T cells (data not shown). Fig. 1C shows by real-time PCR the response to individual cytokine treatment and the synergistic response to IL-2 and IL-12 stimulation in NK92 cells. Thus, we determined that the NK92 cell line was an appropriate model to study IL-2-regulation of IFN-γ expression. Identification of a DNase I Hypersensitivity Site ∼3.5-4 kb Upstream of the IFNG Gene—DNase I HS mapping strategies have been used to successfully identify genomic regions that are functionally linked to gene expression. This approach allows for the investigation of the chromatin structure of the native gene in intact nuclei. It has been shown previously that DNase I HSs in the IFNG gene are found only in cells capable of transcribing the gene (27Hardy K.J. Peterlin B.M. Atchison R.E. Stobo J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8173-8177Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the appearance or predominance of these sites in T cells is stimulation-sensitive, indicating a dynamic relationship between cell-specific competency for expression and transcription that is activation-dependent (28Hardy K.J. Manger B. Newton M. Stobo J.D. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 2353-2358PubMed Google Scholar). Because the proximal 5′-flanking region of the IFNG gene fails to account for normal IFN-γ regulation (8Soutto M. Zhou W. Aune T.M. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 6664-6667Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), we sought to determine if more distal regions of the IFNG gene become remodeled upon cytokine stimulation. To identify potential regulatory regions in the IFNG gene we performed DNase I HS analysis using NK92 cells (Fig. 2). The results show the appearance of two bands by Southern blot analysis. The band of ∼12 kb represents the HindIII-HindIII restriction fragment, visible only after phenol-chloroform extraction and complete HindIII digestion. The 3′ HindIII site in the first intron is located at position +669 and the 5′ HindIII site is at position -11,780 relative to the transcriptional start site according to our nomenclature (29Bream J.H. Carrington M. O'Toole S. Dean M. Gerrard B. Shin H.D. Kosack D. Modi W. Young H.A. Smith M.W. Immunogenetics. 2000; 51: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The lower band represents a single DNase I HS that was estimated to be ∼4.5 kb upstream of the 3′ HindIII restriction site in the first intron (Fig. 2, see arrows) and ∼3.5-4 kb 5′ to the transcriptional start site. The 4-kb HS was observed with the highest DNase I concentrations in unstimulated cells (lane 4), but when NK92 cells were treated fo"

https://openalex.org/W2088007882,"SHP-1 is a Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase that plays an essential role in negative regulation of immune cell activity. We describe here a new model for regulation of SHP-1 involving phosphorylation of its C-terminal Ser591 by associated protein kinase Cα. In human platelets, SHP-1 was found to constitutively associate with its substrate Vav1 and, through its SH2 domains, with protein kinase Cα. Upon activation of either PAR1 or PAR4 thrombin receptors, the association between the three proteins was retained, and Vav1 became phosphorylated on tyrosine and SHP-1 became phosphorylated on Ser591. Phosphorylation of SHP-1 was mediated by protein kinase C and negatively regulated the activity of SHP-1 as demonstrated by a decrease in the in vitro ability of SHP-1 to dephosphorylate Vav1 on tyrosine. Protein kinase Cα therefore critically and negatively regulates SHP-1 function, forming part of a mechanism to retain SHP-1 in a basal active state through interaction with its SH2 domains, and phosphorylating its C-terminal Ser591 upon cellular activation leading to inhibition of SHP-1 activity and an increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation status of its substrates.

The reversible phosphorylation of Tyr residues is an important mechanism regulating protein function. The Tyr phosphorylation status, and subsequently the activity, of many proteins is determined by the opposing actions of kinases and phosphatases that are in many cases themselves regulated by phosphorylation. There are large numbers of protein-tyrosine kinases and protein-tyrosine phosphatases with distinct substrate specificity and modes of regulation.

Das A.K. Egloff M.P. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1998; 27: 133-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar) and possess a catalytic domain with two SH2 domains at the N terminus and a C-terminal tail of poorly characterized function. Although closely related in structure, the roles of SHP-1 and SHP-2 in cells have been shown to be quite different. SHP-1 plays a largely negative signaling role (2Zhang J. Somani A.K. Siminovitch K.A. Semin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 361-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) maintaining proteins in an inactive un-phosphorylated state, whereas SHP-2 plays a largely positive signaling role leading to cellular activation (3Neel B.G. Gu G. Pao L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 284-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). The underlying reason for their different roles, despite structural similarity, is still not clear but may partially reside in different mechanisms of regulation of the phosphatases. Solving the crystal structures of the C-terminally truncated versions of, first, SHP-2 (4Hof P. Pluksey S. Dhe-Paganon S. Eck M.J. Shoelson S.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 441-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar) and, second, SHP-1 (5Yang J. Liu L. He D. Song X. Liang X. Zhao Z.J. Zhou G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6516-6520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) has lead to the proposal of a model where the inactive conformation of SHPs is maintained by the N-SH2 domain, which occludes the active site of the enzyme, thereby inhibiting the phosphatase activity. The C-SH2 domain, which has minimal interaction with the catalytic domain, is then responsible for selecting substrates (6Barford D. Neel B.G. Structure (Lond.). 1998; 6: 249-254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). This model was supported by earlier mutagenesis studies of SHP-1 showing that removal of the SH2 domains increased the phosphatase activity at physiological pH (7Pei D. Lorenz U. Klingmuller U. Neel B.G. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15483-15493Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), and another study refined this further by proposing that only the N-SH2 domain was necessary for autoinhibition (8Pei D. Wang J. Walsh C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1141-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). These early studies also revealed a role for the C-terminal tail of SHP-1, absent from the crystal structure, in regulating phosphatase activity since truncation of the C terminus also stimulated phosphatase activity (7Pei D. Lorenz U. Klingmuller U. Neel B.G. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15483-15493Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Tyr residues within the C-terminal tail has been shown for both SHP-1 and SHP-2 although the function of these phosphorylation events is debatable (3Neel B.G. Gu G. Pao L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 284-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). However, studies incorporating site-specific phosphotyrosine mimetics have attempted to address the contributions of the SH2 domains and C-terminal Tyr phosphorylation in the regulation of SHP-2 phosphatase activity (9Lu W. Gong D. Bar-Sagi D. Cole P.A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 759-769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) and SHP-1 phosphatase activity (10Zhang Z. Shen K. Lu W. Cole P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4668-4674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). These studies indicated that phosphorylated Tyr residues within the C-terminal tail interact with both the N-SH2 and C-SH2 domain in vitro and through these interactions the phosphorylated Tyr residues modestly stimulate phosphatase activity (9Lu W. Gong D. Bar-Sagi D. Cole P.A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 759-769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). In addition to Tyr phosphorylation of SHP-1 and SHP-2, other studies have demonstrated Ser phosphorylation of SHP-1 in murine T cells (11Lorenz U. Ravichandran K.S. Pei D. Walsh C.T. Burakoff S.J. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1824-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), in human platelets (12Li R.Y. Gaits F. Ragab A. Ragab-Thomas J.M. Chap H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2519-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and in human neutrophils (13Brumell J.H. Chan C.K. Butler J. Borregaard N. Siminovitch K.A. Grinstein S. Downey G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 875-882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Also, overexpression studies using insulin receptor, PKC isoforms, and SHP-2 have indicated that SHP-2 is phosphorylated on Ser residues in response to insulin receptor stimulation (14Strack V. Krutzfeldt J. Kellerer M. Ullrich A. Lammers R. Haring H.U. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Here we hypothesized that regulation of SHP-1 may fundamentally differ from that of SHP-2 in that, because of its negative signaling role, SHP-1 is more likely than SHP-2 to have activity under basal conditions. The implication for SHP-1 is that upon cellular activation, the basal activity may be switched off, allowing Tyr phosphorylation of proteins to proceed without opposing Tyr phosphatase activity. We show that SHP-1, through its SH2 domains, constitutively binds both PKCα and the SHP-1 substrate Vav1. Upon cellular activation, Ser591 in the C-terminal tail of SHP-1 is phosphorylated by PKC, leading to inhibition of its activity. Cellular activation leading to tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins therefore involves not only any increase in kinases activity but also a decrease in phosphatase activity. In the case of SHP-1, phosphorylation of its C-terminal tail Ser591 is a critical negative regulator of its activity, leading to enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of it substrate Vav1. Preparation and Stimulation of Human Platelets—Platelets were prepared exactly as described previously (15Crosby D. Poole A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9958-9965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In brief, venous blood was obtained from volunteers with acid citrate dextrose as an anticoagulant, used at a 1:7 v/v ratio. Platelet-rich plasma was obtained by centrifugation at 200 × g for 17 min. Platelets were then isolated by centrifugation of the platelet-rich plasma in the presence of 0.14 μm of prostaglandin E1 and 10 μm indomethacin. The pellet was resuspended in a modified Tyrode's-HEPES buffer to a density of 4 × 108 platelets/ml. Platelets (400 μl) were preincubated with 1 mm EGTA for 1 min before stimulation with either 0.1 unit/ml bovine thrombin (Sigma), 10 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA; Tocris-Cookson), the PAR1 peptide SFLLRN (Bachem, Merseyside, UK), or the PAR4 peptide AYPGKF in an aggregometer at 37 °C with continuous stirring. Where indicated, the platelets were preincubated with bisindolylmaleimide I (BIM I; Tocris-Cookson, Bristol, UK) for 15 min at 30 °C before stimulation. Antibodies—The polyclonal anti-SHP-1 antibody (C-19), the anti-SHP-2 antibody (C-18), and the donkey anti-rabbit IgG FITC (sc-2090) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The monoclonal anti-SHP-1 and anti-PKCα antibodies and the anti-BD Living Colors™ full-length polyclonal (anti-GFP) antibody were purchased from BD Biosciences. The polyclonal anti-Ser(P) (PKC) substrate antibody was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (New England Biolabs, Hertfordshire, UK). The anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10) antibody was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Milton Keynes, UK). The anti-Vav1 polyclonal antiserum was a gift from Dr. Martin Turner (Babraham Institute, UK). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Immunoprecipitation—Reactions were stopped by lysis of platelets with an equal volume of 2× neutral detergent lysis buffer (100 mm Tris, 300 mm NaCl, and 2% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, pH 7.5, plus complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) and phosphatase inhibitor mixture (either mixture I for preservation of Ser(P)/Thr(P) or mixture II for preservation of Tyr(P) (Sigma)) or 2× RIPA buffer (100 mm Tris, 300 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1% (w/v) deoxycholic acid, and 0.2% (w/v) SDS, pH 8.0, plus complete protease inhibitors and phosphate inhibitor mixture). Insoluble debris was cleared from the lysate by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were precleared with either protein-A-Sepharose (rabbit polyclonal antibodies) or protein-G-agarose (mouse monoclonal antibodies) beads for 1 h. Antibody-protein-A/G complexes were formed by incubation of protein-A-Sepharose with 2 μg of antibody for 30 min at room temperature. Precleared lysates were added to the antibody-protein-A/G complexes and incubated at 4 °C with constant rotation. Immunoprecipitates were washed twice, and proteins were eluted from the beads by incubation of the immunoprecipitates with 60 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer (24 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.8% (v/v) SDS, 6 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.04% bromphenol blue) at 90 °C for 3 min. Electrophoresis of Proteins and Immunoblotting—SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting were carried out as described (15Crosby D. Poole A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9958-9965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In summary, proteins were separated by discontinuous SDS-PAGE on 10% slab gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane by semi-dry transfer (15 V for 1 h). Membranes were blocked either by incubation with either 5% (w/v) BSA (phosphorylation-specific antibodies) in TBSt (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Trizma (Tris base), and 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, pH 7.6) or 5% (w/v) nonfat milk powder in TBSt. Primary antibodies were diluted in either 5% (w/v) BSA (phosphorylation-specific antibodies) in TBSt or 2.5% (w/v) nonfat milk in TBSt. After incubation with primary antibodies, membranes were washed with TBSt and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, diluted in 3% (w/v) BSA, for 1 h at room temperature. After further washing of the membrane, signals were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. When necessary, membranes were stripped using Restore Western blot stripping buffer (Pierce). Membranes were immersed in stripping buffer and incubated at room temperature for 30 min before extensive washing and reprobing with the appropriate antibody. Mutagenesis of Human SHP-1—The Escherichia coli strain JM109 was transformed with hSHP-1.pGEX-2T DNA (A gift of Dr. Benjamin Neel, Harvard), and plasmid DNA was prepared using a QIAprep miniprep kit (Qiagen). A single point mutation was introduced into the Ser591 codon, converting it to an Ala codon, by PCR using the primer extension overlap method and inserted into pGEX-4T-3 vector for expression as a GST-tagged protein in E. coli or into pEGFP-C3 vector for expression as a GFP-tagged protein in HEK cells. The primer sequences for this mutation are 5′-gagaagagcaagggtgccctcaagaggaagtga-3′ (forward mutagenesis primer) and 5′-cacttcctcttgagggcacccttgctcttctc-3′ (reverse mutagenesis primer; this construct was named SHP-1 S591A). Deletion of the tandem SH2 domains of human SHP-1 was achieved by PCR using the following primers, 5′-ccagggaattcccaagaagacggggattgag-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-cggcctcgagtcacttcctcttgagggaacc-3′ (reverse primer), and was inserted into the pGEX-4T-3 vector for expression as a GST-tagged protein in E. coli. This construct was named ΔT-SH2 SHP-1. Constructs were sequenced to ensure that undesirable mutations were not present. Expression of GFP-tagged Proteins in HEK-293 Cells—HEK-293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with serum and penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C. 35-mm dishes were seeded with HEK-293 cells and transfected with 1 μg of plasmid DNA (GFP-full-length human SHP-1 wild type or S591A) using Genejuice transfection reagent (Novagen) when at ∼75% confluency. 48 h after transfection, cells were washed twice with Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer (Sigma) and then incubated in 1 ml of Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer for 1 h at 37 °C. After 1 h, where indicated, PMA was added to a final concentration of 100 nm and incubated for a further 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were lysed using neutral detergent lysis buffer and GFP-tagged proteins immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP antibody. Expression and Purification of GST Fusion Proteins—The E. coli strain BL21 Rosetta (Novagen and Merck) was transformed with plasmid DNA encoding either wild type human SHP-1, ΔT-SH2 SHP-1, or SHP-1 S591A as GST fusion proteins. Single colonies were picked and used to inoculate 5-ml cultures of LB broth, grown overnight at 37 °C with constant shaking. The following morning the overnight culture was diluted (1:50) into fresh LB broth and grown at 37 °C until the A600 nm = 0.5. Expression of fusion proteins was then induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to 0.1 mm, and incubation was continued at 30 °C for another 4 h. Bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation, and pellets were resuspended in 25 ml/1 liter of original culture of PBS supplemented with 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 and complete protease inhibitors. Cells were lysed by sonication and clarified by centrifugation. The clarified bacterial cell lysates were incubated with glutathione-agarose for 3 h at 4 °C with constant rotation. The agarose beads were then washed with PBS, and bound proteins were eluted with 5 mm reduced glutathione in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0. The eluted proteins were buffer-exchanged into PBS by gel filtration using Bio-Rad P-6DG gel and concentrated using Millipore Ultrafree 15-centrifugal filter devices (30 NMWL). The protein concentration was then determined using the Bradford Assay by using BSA as standard. GST Pulldown Assay—Platelets were stimulated as required and lysed in neutral detergent lysis buffer containing phosphatase inhibitor mixture II (Sigma), centrifuged, and pre-cleared with 50 μl of glutathione-Sepharose (Sigma) by incubation at 4 °C with constant rotation for 1 h. Meanwhile, 10 μg of purified GST fusion protein or GST alone was incubated with 50 μl of glutathione-Sepharose at room temperature for 1 h. After pre-clearing the platelet, lysates were incubated with the GST/GST fusion proteins coupled to beads at 4 °C overnight and washed twice with 1× neutral detergent lysis buffer. Proteins were eluted from the beads by incubation of the GSH-Sepharose beads with 60 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer at 90 °C for 3 min. In Vitro Kinase Assay—The PKCα isoform was immunoprecipitated from stimulated platelet lysates as described earlier under “Experimental Procedures” using a monoclonal anti-PKCα antibody (BD Biosciences). The immunoprecipitates were washed with lysis buffer and resuspended in 50 μl of kinase assay buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.15 mm ATP). GST fusion proteins were added, and the samples were mixed and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with occasional mixing. The reaction was terminated by the addition of SDS sample buffer. Phosphorylation of GST fusion proteins was determined by immunoblotting with the anti-phospho-(Ser) PKC substrate antibody. In Vitro Protein-tyrosine Phosphatase Assay—Tyrosine-phosphorylated Vav1 was immunoprecipitated from pervanadate-treated Jurkat cells using anti-Vav1 antiserum. For each time point 2.5 μl of antiserum was used to immunoprecipitate Vav1 from ∼108 cells/ml. SHP-1 was immunoprecipitated from basal or stimulated human platelets as described in this section and incubated with Vav1 immunocomplexes. Dephosphorylation reactions were carried out in 40 μl of 20 mm imidazole HCl, pH 7.0, containing 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, at 37 °C. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 10 μlof5× sample buffer and incubation at 95 °C for 5 min. 10-μl aliquots were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with the anti-Tyr(P) (4G10) antibody. Immunoblots were scanned and analyzed by densitometry. Immunofluorescence Confocal Imaging of Platelets—Immunostaining of platelets was carried out exactly as described previously (16Crosby D. Poole A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24533-24541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Platelets were stimulated with either thrombin or PMA, and reactions were terminated by the addition of 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS: 147 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4) and left at room temperature for 30 min. Platelets were pelleted by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min and washed twice with PBS. Platelets were immobilized on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips overnight, permeabilized by incubation of coverslips with PBST (PBS plus 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100) at room temperature for 10 min, and then incubated with PBST plus 1% (w/v) BSA for 30 min at room temperature to block nonspecific binding. Immobilized platelets were then incubated with the polyclonal anti-SHP-1 in PBST plus 1% (w/v) BSA at 4 °C for 24 h. Coverslips were then washed three times with PBST before incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled secondary antibody diluted in PBST plus 1% (w/v) BSA. Coverslips were again washed three times with PBST before incubation with 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min; coverslips were mounted onto slides using a 13.5% Mowiol solution containing 2.5% (w/v) 1,4-diazobicyclo-[2,2,2]octane. Platelets were imaged using a Leica TCS-NT confocal laser scanning microscope equipped with Kr/Ar laser (488, 568, and 647 nm lines) attached to a Leica DM IRBE inverted fluorescence microscope. SHP-1 Is Phosphorylated on Ser591 by PKC Upon Cellular Activation—It had already been shown that SHP-1 may be phosphorylated on Ser (12Li R.Y. Gaits F. Ragab A. Ragab-Thomas J.M. Chap H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2519-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), although the function of this phosphorylation, the kinase responsible, and the site of phosphorylation have not been determined. Li et al. (12Li R.Y. Gaits F. Ragab A. Ragab-Thomas J.M. Chap H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2519-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) had provided pharmacological evidence that a PKC isoform may be responsible for phosphorylating SHP-1 in platelets, although Gaits et al. (17Gaits F. Li R.Y. Bigay J. Ragab A. Ragab-Thomas J.M.F. Chap H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20151-20155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) had shown in DAMI cells that SHP-1 Ser phosphorylation was not inhibited by the PKC inhibitor GF109203X (also called bisindolylmaleimide I; BIM I). Given the discrepancy in the literature, we were interested first to determine whether SHP-1 was a PKC substrate in vivo by using an anti-phosphopeptide antibody-based approach. Given the close homology, but distinct functional differences between the two family members SHP-1 and SHP-2, we decided initially to identify putative PKC-mediated phosphorylation sites in SHP-1. This analysis indicated that Ser591 of SHP-1 was the most prominent PKC phosphorylation consensus sequence in SHP-1, and this site had no match within the SHP-2 sequence (Fig. 1A). Serine 591 in SHP-1 lies just five residues from the C terminus of the phosphatase and lies perfectly within a consensus sequence of a commercially available antibody (anti-Ser(P) (PKC) substrate antibody) that has been generated against a set of peptides that correspond to PKC consensus phosphorylation sites, particularly those phosphorylated by conventional PKC isoforms. We were thus able to address if SHP-1 was a PKC substrate in vivo by using an anti-phosphopeptide antibody-based approach. First, we mutated Ser591 in SHP-1 to Ala and expressed the mutant (S591A) as a GST fusion protein. In vitro phosphorylation of purified GST fusion proteins (wild type (WT) and S591A) by immunoprecipitated PKCα from activated platelets (Fig. 1B) revealed that Ser591 was phosphorylated by PKCα, and this residue was indeed the only residue within the SHP-1 sequence to be recognized by the anti-Ser(P) (PKC) substrate antibody as being phosphorylated. This finding was confirmed in vivo by expressing GFP-SHP-1 (wild type and S591A) in HEK cells (Fig. 1C). Phorbol ester activation of the cells leads to detection of phosphorylation by the PKC substrate antibody only in cells expressing wild-type SHP-1, and not in the point mutant Ser591. By having shown then that the anti-Ser(P) (PKC) substrate antibody could act as a specific anti-phosphopeptide antibody for Ser591 within SHP-1, we addressed whether this site was phosphorylated in vivo in platelets upon cellular activation. Fig. 2A shows SHP-1 and SHP-2 immunoprecipitated from basal and thrombin-stimulated human platelet lysates immunoblotted with anti-Ser(P) (PKC) substrate antibody. The data show that SHP-1 but not SHP-2 reacted with the antibody in stimulated conditions (Fig. 2A), indicating that SHP-1 is indeed phosphorylated on Ser591in vivo in platelets. Lack of SHP-2 detection by the antibody validates the specificity of the approach. In addition, membranes were probed with a context independent anti-phosphothreonine (anti-Thr(P)) antibody, which detected no phosphorylation of either SHP-1 or SHP-2 on Thr. This is consistent with Li et al. (12Li R.Y. Gaits F. Ragab A. Ragab-Thomas J.M. Chap H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2519-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) who also showed no phosphorylation of SHP-1 on Thr. Immunoprecipitations were also performed with the polyclonal SHP-1 antibody in the presence of blocking peptide. This confirmed that the immunoreactive band, which was obtained when immunoblotted with anti-Ser(P) (PKC) substrate antibody, was indeed SHP-1 because no immunoreactivity was observed when blocking peptide was included (data not shown). Also, SHP-1 was found to be present in anti-Ser(P) (PKC) substrate antibody immunoprecipitates from thrombin-stimulated human platelet lysates (Fig. 2B), again indicating that SHP-1 was genuinely phosphorylated on Ser591in vivo upon cellular activation. In human platelets thrombin has been shown to elicit signal transduction through both PAR1 and PAR4 receptors (18Kahn M.L. Nakanishi-Matsui M. Shapiro M.J. Ishihara H. Coughlin S.R. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 103: 879-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar), so we determined if activation of one or both of these receptors was required for either Ser591 or Tyr phosphorylation of SHP-1. Human platelets were stimulated with either 0.1 unit/ml thrombin, 100 μm PAR1 peptide (SFLLRN) (19Vu T.K. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I. Coughlin S.R. Cell. 1991; 64: 1057-1068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2641) Google Scholar), or 500 μm PAR4 peptide (AYPGKF) (20Faruqi T.R. Weiss E.J. Shapiro M.J. Huang W. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19728-19734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) for the times indicated in Fig. 2C. SHP-1 was immunoprecipitated, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with anti-Ser(P) (PKC) substrate antibody (Fig. 2C, i) or 4G10 anti-phosphotyrosine (Fig. 2C, ii). Ser591 phosphorylation of SHP-1 was rapid, reaching a maximum within 30 s. When human platelets were stimulated with thrombin and the PAR4-specific peptide (AYPGKF), phosphorylation of Ser591 was sustained over the period of the time course. However, Ser591 phosphorylation of SHP-1 in response to the PAR1-specific peptide (SFLLRN) was maximal by 30 s and decreased slightly after 2 min. Thus activation of either PAR1 or PAR4 causes phosphorylation of SHP-1 on Ser591 with subtly different dynamics. In agreement with previous reports (21Pasquet J.M. Quek L. Pasquet S. Poole A. Matthews J.R. Lowell C. Watson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28526-28531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), thrombin induced phosphorylation of SHP-1 on Tyr also (Fig. 2C). Phosphorylation on Tyr was rapid and sustained for thrombin, PAR1, and PAR4 peptides, indicating that either receptor may couple to this phosphorylation event, as for phosphorylation of Ser591. To confirm that phosphorylation of SHP-1 on Ser591 was because of PKC activity, human platelets were stimulated with the PKC activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). As shown in Fig. 3A, stimulation with 10 nm PMA was sufficient to induce phosphorylation of SHP-1 on Ser591, and experiments with the specific PKC inhibitor BIM I demonstrated that the phosphorylation event was dose-dependently abolished by pre-treatment of human platelets with this inhibitor (Fig. 3B). Pretreatment of human platelets with 5 μm BIM I for 15 min before thrombin stimulation was sufficient to partially reduce Ser phosphorylation of SHP-1; treatment with higher concentrations of BIM I completely abolished immunoreactivity of SHP-1 with the antibody. These experiments indicated that PKC is responsible for phosphorylation of SHP-1 on Ser591 in human platelets. It was important to determine whether Ser591 phosphorylation was dependent upon Tyr phosphorylation of SHP-1. Fig. 3C shows that in the presence of the Src family kinase inhibitor PP1, thrombin-induced Ser591 phosphorylation of SHP-1 is unaffected although Tyr phosphorylation is ablated. This demonstrates that Ser591 phosphorylation of SHP-1 is not dependent upon Tyr phosphorylation of the molecule and that the two phosphorylation events are independent modifications. Thrombin-induced Translocation of SHP-1 Is Not Dependent upon Phosphorylation of Ser591—It was important to ascertain the functional role of Ser591 phosphorylation of SHP-1 by PKC. One possible role was to direct localization of SHP-1 within the cell. We investigated SHP-1 localization in human platelets by immunostaining of fixed platelets with the polyclonal anti-SHP-1 antibody (Fig. 4). In basal platelets (Fig. 4A), SHP-1 was localized to the cytoplasm, in agreement with previous studies using ectopically expressed GFP-SHP-1 (22Craggs G. Kellie S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23719-23725Abst"
https://openalex.org/W2109935448,"During the initiation and progression of fibrosis there is extensive differentiation of cells to a myofibroblastic phenotype. Because the synthesis of hyaluronan (HA) was recently linked to oncogenic epithelial-mesenchymal transformation, the present study investigated whether increased HA synthesis was also associated with myofibroblastic differentiation. HA synthesis and size were measured by incorporation of [3H]glucosamine, ion exchange, and size exclusion chromatography. Hyaluronan synthase (HAS) or hyaluronidase (HYAL) mRNA levels were assessed by reverse transcription-PCR. HYAL was detected by immunoblotting and the degradation of [3H]HA. Between 2- and 3-fold more HA appeared in the conditioned medium and became associated with the cells upon myofibroblastic differentiation. Inhibition of HAS and examination of HAS mRNA expression demonstrated that this was not the result of increased synthesis of HA or the induction of HAS 2. After differentiation, however, myofibroblasts metabolized exogenously supplied [3H]HA at a slower rate than fibroblasts and expressed lower levels of both HYAL 1 and HYAL 2 mRNA. Immunoblotting revealed more HYAL 1 and 2 in the myofibroblast conditioned medium. After acidification, however, there was no difference in HA degradation. This suggests that much of the released HYAL is inactive and that the observed differences in HA degradation are caused by cell-associated rather than secreted activity. This was confirmed by immunohistochemical staining for HYAL 1 and HYAL 2. This finding indicates the potential importance of the HYAL enzymes in controlling fibrotic progression and contrasts HA synthesis as a mediator of oncogenic transformation with that of HA degradation controlling fibrogenic differentiation.

Changes in cellular phenotype and differentiation occur in response to localized alterations in the cellular environment. At sites of inflammation and tissue damage these alterations may have fundamental effects on the phenotype of the resident cells, particularly fibroblasts (1Sappino A.P. Schurch W. Gabbiani G. Lab. Invest. 1990; 63: 144-161PubMed Google Scholar). Fibroblasts, characteristically, are able to undergo a range of phenotypic conversions between distinct but related cell types, and their phenotypic heterogeneity is well described (2Gabbiani G. J. Pathol. 2003; 200: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (1270) Google Scholar). At sites of tissue damage and wound healing, fibroblasts with a contractile phenotype are essential for the synthesis of the collagen-rich scar and for providing the force for wound contraction (3Grinnell F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 401-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). In such circumstances, these “myofibroblasts” are normally a transient cell population. In contrast to wound healing, however, a persistent accumulation of myofibroblasts is associated with the pathological reorganization and expansion of the extracellular matrix (4Desmouliere A. Darby I.A. Gabbiani G. Lab. Invest. 2003; 83: 1689-1707Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). This fibrotic response includes the synthesis and accumulation of extracellular matrix components that may not normally be present or are present at only low levels in normal tissue. One of the earliest of these to be deposited is hyaluronan (HA) 1The abbreviations used are: HA, hyaluronan; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; BSA, bovine serum albumin; CM, conditioned medium extract; HAS, hyaluronan synthase; HBSS, Hanks' balanced salt solution; HYAL, hyaluronidase; 4-MU, 4-methylumbelliferone; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RT, reverse transcription; TGF, transforming growth factor.

HA is a negatively charged, linear, nonsulfated glycosaminoglycan consisting of repeating disaccharide units of glucuronic acid and N-acetylglucosamine. Unlike other glycosaminoglycans its synthesis does not take place in the Golgi. Rather it is extruded from the plasma membrane as a chain, which may reach a size of as much as 107 Da. Three vertebrate HA synthase (HAS) genes have been described (8Meyer M.F. Kreil G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4543-4547Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 9Spicer A.P. McDonald J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1923-1932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). The HAS enzymes they transcribe are bound to the inner, cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane. The expression of each of these is cell type-specific, and each is regulated differentially in response to extracellular mediators. Under normal conditions there is a tightly regulated equilibrium between the synthesis of HA and its turnover. Different tissues, however, turn over HA at different rates, varying from a half-life of less than 5 min in blood to between 1 and 3 weeks in cartilage (10Stern R. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 105R-115RCrossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). HA normally exists as a high molecular weight molecule that is involved in matrix stability and maintenance of cell homeostasis. In contrast, lower molecular weight oligosaccharides of HA stimulate gene expression and protein synthesis of a variety of proinflammatory molecules and mediators (11Noble P.W. Matrix Biol. 2002; 21: 25-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Many of the responses initiated by HA binding to its receptors have been investigated (12Turley E.A. Noble P.W. Bourguignon L.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4589-4592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar), although a detailed understanding of the mechanisms whereby HA influences specific aspects of cellular function is lacking. Recently Zoltan-Jones et al. (13Zoltan-Jones A. Huang L. Ghatak S. Toole B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45801-45810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) demonstrated that overexpression of HAS 2 leading to the increased synthesis of HA, initiated the acquisition of mesenchymal and transformed characteristics in Madin-Darby canine kidney and MCF-10A epithelial cells. Because an increase in myofibroblast numbers in fibrotic tissue is associated with the accumulation of HA, we examined the hypothesis that a change in the synthesis and catabolism of HA is also a major factor contributing to the profibrotic differentiation of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts. Materials—All general reagents were from Sigma, and all tissue culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen unless stated otherwise. Radioisotopes were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Cell Culture—Human lung fibroblasts (AG02262) were purchased from Coriell Cell Repositories (Coriell Institute for Medical Research, NJ). The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and F-12 medium containing 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone). The cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified incubator in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. For differentiation to myofibroblasts, confluent monolayers of fibroblasts were growth arrested in serum-free medium for 72 h and then treated with the optimized concentration of 10 ng/ml transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 (R&D Systems) for 72 h. TGF-β1 was then removed and incubations continued in serum-free medium (14Evans R.A. Tian Y.C. Steadman R. Phillips A.O. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 282: 90-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemical identification of α-smooth muscle actin and the ED-A isoform of fibronectin together with the visualization of stress fibers were used as confirmation of phenotypic change (14Evans R.A. Tian Y.C. Steadman R. Phillips A.O. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 282: 90-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemistry—Subconfluent monolayers of cells grown in 8-well glass chamber slides were fixed in acetone:methanol (1:1 v/v) (Fisher Scientific) for 10 min, then washed in calcium/magnesium-free phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4 (PBS) (Invitrogen). Nonspecific sites on the fixed cells were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS). The fixed cells were then washed thoroughly in 0.1% BSA in HBSS. The slides were incubated with the primary antibody diluted in 0.1% BSA in HBSS for 2 h at room temperature. The source and dilution of the antibodies were as follows: mouse monoclonal anti-α-smooth muscle actin (Sigma), 1:80; mouse monoclonal anti-cytokeratin (DAKO, Cambridgeshire, UK), 1:80; mouse monoclonal anti-ED-A fibronectin (Oxford Biotechnology, Oxford, UK), 1:50; mouse monoclonal anti-vimentin (DAKO), 1:50; rabbit polyclonal anti-HYAL 1 and rabbit polyclonal anti-HYAL 2 (a kind gift from Dr. Robert Stern, Department of Pathology, University of California, San Francisco), 1:20. The cells were washed repeatedly in 0.1% BSA in HBSS and then incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature: fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (DAKO) or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated swine anti-rabbit IgG (DAKO) diluted 1:40 in 0.1% BSA in HBSS. The cells were washed extensively with 0.1% BSA in HBSS, mounted in Vectashield fluorescent mountant (Vecta Laboratories, Peterborough, UK), and examined on a Leica Dialux 20 fluorescent microscope or by confocal laser scanning microscopy on a Leica TCS 4D (Leica Microsystems (UK) Ltd., Milton Keynes, UK). Semiquantitative Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—Confluent monolayers of cells grown in 35-mm dishes were washed once with PBS and then lysed in 1 ml of Tri-Reagent and RNA purified according to the manufacturer's protocol. RT was performed using the random hexamer method. 1 μg of RNA was added to 1 μl of 100 μm random hexamers (hexadeoxyribonucleotides, pd[N]6, Amersham Biosciences), 5 μl of 10 mm dNTPs (Amersham Biosciences), 2 μl of 10× PCR buffer (Applied Biosystems), and 2 μl of 0.1 m dithiothreitol (Invitrogen). The solution was heated to 95 °C for 5 min followed by 4 °C for 2 min. 1 μl of (40 units/μl) ribonuclease inhibitor RNasin (Promega) and 1 μl of (200 units/μl) Superscript (Rnase H-reverse transcriptase) (Invitrogen) were added to each sample and mixed. The solutions were incubated at 20 °C for 10 min, 42 °C for 40 min, and then 95 °C for 5 min on a GeneAmp PCR system 9700 (Applied Biosystems). As a negative control (–RT) reverse transcription was performed with sterile H2O replacing the RNA sample. The cDNA products were stored at –20 °C. The PCR was carried out in a final volume of 50 μl/sample, 2 μlofRT product, 37.25 μl of sterile H2O, 25 pmol of each primer (Table I), 3 μl of 10 mm dNTPs, 5 μl of 10× PCR buffer, and 0.25 unit of Amplitaq Gold. Thermal cycling was carried out using GeneAmp PCR system 9700. Amplification was carried out using a cycle of 94 °C for 40 s, 55 °C for 60 s, and 72 °C for 60 s.Table IDetails of primers usedPrimer sequencesCyclesProduct sizeβ-Actin control26204F-GGAGCAATGATCTTGATCTTR-CCTTCCTGGGCATGGAGTCCTα-sma28369F- ATCTGGCACCACTCTTTCTAR- TCTCACGCTCAGCAGTAGTAHAS 1Up to 40395F- TCTACGGGGCCTTCCTTTCAGCR- CTCCGCCTCCACCTCCCGATAGHAS 236313F- GCAGGCGGAAGAAGGGACAACR-TCAGGCGGATGCACAGTAAGGAHAS 334453F- AGTGCAGCTTCGGGGATGAR- TGATGGTAGCAATGGCAAAGATHYAL 136400F- CAGGCGTGAGCTGGATGGAGAR- GTATGTGCAACACCGTGTGGCHYAL 232446F- GAGTTCGCAGCACAGCAGTTCR- CACCCCAGAGGATGACACCAGHYAL 336150F- GATCCAGGACAGATGGAAGCR- CCTGGCTTTATACTGCTTCTTTAGGC Open table in a new tab A negative control (–PCR) was included with H2O replacing the cDNA sample. 5 μl of each PCR product plus 3 μl of loading buffer (40% sucrose and 0.1% bromphenol blue) were then separated on 1.5% agarose gels (ultrapure agarose) containing 0.5 mg/ml ethidium bromide at 90 V for 1 h. 3 μl of a 123-bp ladder (Invitrogen) plus 3 μl of loading buffer were also loaded onto the gel. The gels were visualized and photographed under UV light using a Chemi Doc™ Gel Documentation system (Bio-Rad Laboratories). The ratio of each product to that of the β-actin housekeeping gene was calculated by scanning densitometry and the results expressed as the mean ± S.D. for each group of five. The results were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test, and statistical significance was taken as a p value < 0.05. Metabolic Labeling and Analysis of HA—Confluent monolayers of cells grown in T75 flasks were incubated in serum-free medium containing 20 μCi/ml [3H]glucosamine for 24 h. The medium was removed, and the cells were washed with PBS. The wash and medium were combined to form the conditioned medium extract (CM). The CM was then treated with an equal volume of 200 μg/ml Pronase in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.05% sodium azide for 24 h. To remove any surface/CD44-associated HA, the cells were treated with 10 μg/ml trypsin in PBS for 10 min at room temperature; this was designated the trypsin extract. The trypsin extract was then treated with an equal volume of 200 μg/ml Pronase for 24 h. The cells remaining in the culture flask were incubated directly with 100 μg/ml Pronase for 24 h. The supernatant was decanted and designated the cell extract. Each extract was passed over DEAE-Sephacel ion exchange columns (Amersham Biosciences), equilibrated with 8 m urea in 20 mm BisTris buffer, pH 6, containing 0.2% Triton X-100. This removed any low molecular weight peptides and unincorporated radiolabel. HA was eluted in 8 m urea buffer containing 0.3 m NaCl. Sulfated glycosylaminoglycans remained bound and were subsequently eluted in 4 m guanidine buffer (4 m guanidine HCl, 50 mm sodium acetate, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 0.05% sodium azide). Each sample was split into two, and the HA was precipitated with 3 volumes of 1% potassium acetate in 95% ethanol in the presence of 50 μg/ml of each HA, heparin, and chondroitin sulfate as coprecipitants. The first half of each sample was resuspended in 500 μl of 4 m guanidine buffer and analyzed on a Sephacryl S-500 column, equilibrated with 4 m guanidine buffer. To confirm that the chromatography profile generated was the result of radiolabeled HA, the second half of each sample was digested at 37 °C overnight with 1 unit of Streptomyces hyalurolyticus hyaluronidase (HYAL) (ICN Pharmaceuticals Ltd.) in 200 μl of 20 mm sodium acetate, pH 6, containing 0.05% sodium azide and 0.15 m sodium chloride. The sample was then mixed with an equal volume of 4 m guanidine buffer and analyzed on the same Sephacryl S-500 column equilibrated with 4 m guanidine buffer. To produce the chromatography profile the 3H activity (dpm) for each half of the sample was normalized, corrected for dilution, and then the HYAL-resistant counts were subtracted. The chromatography profiles only depict HYAL-sensitive activity in each fraction plotted against fraction number. The column was calibrated with (a) [3H]glucosamine hydrochloride, Mr 215; (b) [35S]chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycans, Mr 25 × 103; (c) [35S]decorin, Mr 10 × 104; (d) [35S]versican, Mr 1.3 × 106 (15Thomas G.J.

Purification of [3H]HA—The HK2 cell line was used to prepare large quantities of [3H]HA. Confluent monolayers of HK2 cells grown in T75 flasks were incubated with [3H]glucosamine for 72 h in serum-free medium. The CM was removed, [3H]HA isolated, and each extract was processed and analyzed as under “Metabolic Labeling and Analysis of HA,” above. After size separation on Sephacryl S-500, the fractions corresponding to [3H]HA with a size greater than 1,000 kDa were pooled. Triton X-100 was removed from the sample by passing over DEAE-Sephacel and washing the bound [3H]HA extensively with water. The [3H]HA was eluted with 4 m guanidine buffer without Triton X-100. Before addition of exogenous [3H]HA to confluent monolayers of cells it was dialyzed repeatedly against serum-free medium to remove the 4 m guanidine buffer. For the estimate of cell-free HYAL activity, [3H]HA (50 × 103 dpm) was dialyzed against water and lyophilized. Addition of Exogenous [3H]HA to Confluent Monolayers of Cells— Serum-free medium containing 100,000 dpm of [3H]HA/ml was added to confluent monolayers of cells grown in T25 flasks and incubated at 37 °C in a humidified incubator in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 for 24 and 72 h. Controls consisted of serum-free medium containing 100,000 dpm/ml of [3H]HA/ml incubated for the appropriate time points. The CM was removed, freeze-dried, and then reconstituted in 4 m guanidine buffer and analyzed by size exclusion chromatography on a Sephacryl S-500 column equilibrated with 4 m guanidine buffer. The recovery of HA-specific counts varied between 91 and 95% in the CM and 3 and 5% in the cell layer in these experiments compared with 100% recovery of the cell-free control. Assay of Cell-free HYAL Activity—The CM decanted from confluent monolayers of cells grown in T25 flasks was passed over DEAE-Sephacel ion exchange columns in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8. The flow-through (containing HYAL) was then dialyzed against water and freeze-dried. The samples were reconstituted in 0.1 m sodium formate buffer, pH 3.7, and incubated with 50 × 103 dpm [3H]HA for 72 h at 37 °C. HYAL activity was not detectable at neutral pH (not shown). Controls consisted of 0.1 m sodium formate buffer, pH 3.7, containing 50 × 103 dpm [3H]HA incubated for 72 h. The HA size distribution was then examined by size exclusion chromatography on a Sephacryl S-500 column equilibrated with 4 m guanidine buffer. HA Turnover by Pulse-Chase—Confluent monolayers of cells grown in T75 flasks were incubated in serum-free medium containing 20 μCi/ml [3H]glucosamine for 24 h. The medium was then removed at times up to 12 h, and the cells were washed with PBS, and fresh medium without radiolabel was added. The wash and medium were combined to form the CM as above. The CM was then treated with an equal volume of 200 μg/ml Pronase in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.05% sodium azide for 24 h. The remaining cell/matrix layer was incubated directly with 100 μg/ml Pronase for 24 h. The supernatant was decanted and designated the cell layer extract. Each extract was processed and analyzed as under “Metabolic Labeling and Analysis of HA,” above. Particle Exclusion Assay—The exclusion of horse erythrocytes was used to visualize the HA pericellular coat. Subconfluent layers of cells grown in 35-mm dishes were washed repeatedly in PBS. Formalized horse erythrocytes were washed in PBS and centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 7 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in serum-free medium, approximate density 1 × 108/ml. 500 μl of formalized horse erythrocyte suspension was added to each 35-mm dish and swirled gently to distribute the cell suspension evenly. The dishes were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min to allow the formalized horse erythrocyte to settle around the cell layer. Controls cells were incubated with 200 μg/ml HYAL from bovine testes in serum-free medium for 60 min prior to the addition formalized horse erythrocytes. Zones of exclusion were visualized on a Zeiss Axiovert 135 inverted microscope (Carl Zeiss; Light Microscopy, Gottingen, Germany) with a Hamamatsu C5985 chilled CCD camera (Hamamatsu Photonics UK Ltd., Hertfordshire, UK) and OpenLab software 3.0.8 (Improvision, Coventry, UK). Because of the elongated shape of many of the cell processes, the exclusion zone at some areas of the cell was not visible, making calculation of areas difficult. Therefore, the width of the exclusion zone was calculated at the widest point of the cell (usually at the nucleus). Nonparametric statistical analysis (Mann-Whitney U test) was then carried out on the measurements from each cell type. SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting—The CM decanted from confluent monolayers of cells grown in T25 flasks was passed over DEAE-Sephacel ion exchange columns in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8. The flow-through (containing HYAL) was then dialyzed against water, freeze-dried, and reconstituted in 0.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8. The sample was added to an equal volume of loading buffer, and proteins were separated on discontinuous 7.5% polyacrylamide gels followed by transfer to nitrocellulose. After transfer, blots were blocked with 5% skimmed milk, 0.5% Tween 20 in 50 mm Tris-HCl-buffered saline for 1 h. Rabbit polyclonal anti-HYAL 1 and rabbit polyclonal anti-HYAL 2 (a kind gift from Dr. Robert Stern, Department of Pathology, University of California, San Francisco) diluted 1:200 were added to the blots in 0.1% Tween 20 and 1% BSA in Tris-HCl-buffered saline and incubated at 4 °C overnight. After washing, the blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody. Antibody binding was visualized by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Negative controls consisted of incubation with normal rabbit serum (diluted 1:1,000) in place of the primary antibody. HA Synthesis after Myofibroblast Differentiation—Exposure of human lung fibroblasts to TGF-β1 resulted in their differentiation to a myofibroblast phenotype with the induction of α-smooth muscle actin and ED-A fibronectin, which was maximal by 72 h at concentrations above 10 ng/ml (Fig. 1). As reported previously (14Evans R.A. Tian Y.C. Steadman R. Phillips A.O. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 282: 90-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 16Thannickal V.J. Lee D.Y. White E.S. Cui Z.

Both cell types stained positively for vimentin and were negative for cytokeratin. Labeling the cells with [3H]glucosamine for 24 h after their differentiation resulted in an augmented accumulation of HA compared with fibroblasts. Analysis of HA by size exclusion chromatography indicated that there was between 2- and 3-fold more HA present in the CM of myofibroblasts compared with fibroblasts (Fig. 2A). Myofibroblasts also had more HA associated with the cell surface (Fig. 2B) and with the cell layer (Fig. 2C) than fibroblasts. In addition, although the majority of the HA from each of these three compartments had a high molecular weight, both the MC and the cell layer also contained lower molecular weight forms, which were not found in the trypsin-accessible cell surface extract.Fig. 2Size exclusion chromatography of HA purified from fibroblasts compared with that from myofibroblasts. Myofibroblasts (•) and fibroblasts (○) were metabolically labeled for 24 h with [3H]glucosamine. The radiolabeled HA was isolated from the CM (A), the trypsin extract (B), and the cell layer extract (C) and subjected to size exclusion chromatography on a Sephacryl S-500 column. The column was calibrated as described under “Experimental Procedures” with [3H]glucosamine hydrochloride, Mr 215 (a); [35S]chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycans, Mr 25 × 103 (b); [35S]decorin, Mr 10 × 104 (c); [35S]versican, Mr 1.3 × 106 (d). The results shown are representative of more than 10 preparations from each cell type. Three arbitrary sizes of HA are indicated, high molecular weight (HMW), >1.5 × 106; medium (MMW), 0.4–1.5 × 106; and low (LMW), <40 × 104.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Effect of Manipulation of HA Synthesis and Turnover on Cell Phenotype—The increased synthesis of HA through the induction of HAS 2 has been described previously as a stimulus-initiating epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (13Zoltan-Jones A. Huang L. Ghatak S. Toole B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45801-45810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). To investigate the possibility that a similar mechanism was involved after fibroblast to myofibroblast differentiation, the expression of each of the HAS isoforms was examined by semiquantitative RT-PCR. mRNA for both HAS 2 and HAS 3 was detected in each of five separate cultures of fibroblasts and five cultures of myofibroblasts (Fig. 3). Densitometric analysis of the bands, corrected for the expression of β-actin, however, revealed significantly lower expression of both mRNA species in myofibroblasts (for HAS 2: fibroblast 1.07 ± 0.20, myofibroblast 0.84 ± 0.12 with p = 0.028; for HAS 3: fibroblast 1.02 ± 0.07, myofibroblast 0.72 ± 0.17 with p = 0.009). HAS 1 mRNA was not detected in either cell. 4-Methylumbelliferone (4-MU), an inhibitor of the HAS (17Nakamura T. Takagaki K. Shibata S. Tanaka K. Higuchi T. Endo M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Biochem. 2002; 269: 5066-5075Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), was used to investigate HA further as a potential mediator of myofibroblast differentiation. Metabolic labeling and size exclusion chromatography were used to establish 0.2 mm as the optimal effective concentration of 4-MU. At this concentration there was a maximum 70% inhibition of total HA, and this was used in all subsequent experiments (Fig. 4).Fig. 4Inhibition of HA synthesis in fibroblasts by the optimal concentration of 4-MU. Fibroblasts were metabolically labeled for 24 h with[3H]glucosamine in the absence (○) or presence (•) of 0.2 mm 4-MU. The labeled HA was isolated from the CM (A), the trypsin extract (B), and the cell layer extract (C) and subjected to size exclusion chromatography on a Sephacryl S-500 column as described under “Experimental Procedures.” HMW, MMW, and LMW, as in Fig. 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The HA pericellular coat was visualized using the exclusion of formalized erythrocytes (Fig. 5). Myofibroblasts had a well established coat of HA that was ∼3-fold thicker than that of fibroblasts (Fig. 5F compared with 5B). Taking measurements of the coat thickness at the widest point of 30 randomly chosen cells of each phenotype gave a mean thickness for the myofibroblast coat of 1.61 ± 0.72 μm and for the fibroblast coat of 0.52 ± 0.15 μm (mean ± S.D.) (Z –6.661, p < 0001 Mann-Whitney U test). Incubation with 4-MU inhibited coat assembly in both cell types (Fig. 5, C and G) without affecting cell morphology or viability (not shown). Control cells incubated with bovine testicular HYAL (Fig. 5, D and H) had no pericellular coats. HYAL Activity in Fibroblasts and Myofibroblasts—The observation that there was lower expression of HAS 2 and HAS 3 in myofibroblasts, combined with the metabolic labeling data, suggested that the greater accumulation of HA by myofibroblasts may be the result of decreased HA degradation. The mRNA level for each of the HYAL enzymes was, therefore, examined by RT-PCR. The mRNA for HYAL 1, HYAL 2, and HYAL 3 was detected in each of five separate cultures of each cell type. Although there was no difference between the levels of expression of HYAL 3, both HYAL 1 and HYAL 2 were expressed at lower levels in myofibroblasts than in fibroblasts. This was statistically significant, however, only for HYAL 2 (Table II).Table IIExpression of HYAL mRNA by fibroblasts and myofibroblastsIsoformFibroblastsMyofibroblastsSignificanceaMann-Whitney U test, n = 5.

We show here that Nucling was up-regulated by proapoptotic stimuli and important for the induction of apoptosis after cytotoxic stress. We further demonstrated that overexpressed Nucling was able to induce apoptosis. In Nucling-deficient cells, the expression levels of Apaf-1 and cytochrome c, which are the major components of an apoptosis-promoting complex named apoptosome, were both down-regulated under cellular stress. A deficiency of Nucling also conferred resistance to apoptotic stress on the cell. After UV irradiation, Nucling was shown to reside in an Apaf-1/pro-caspase-9 complex, suggesting that Nucling might be a key molecule for the formation and maintenance of this complex. Nucling induced translocation of Apaf-1 to the nucleus, thereby distributing the Nucling/Apaf-1/pro-caspase-9 complex to the nuclear fraction. These findings suggest that Nucling recruits and transports the apoptosome complex during stress-induced apoptosis.

Cell death is classified into two major morphologically and biochemically distinct modes, necrosis and apoptosis. Necrosis is characterized by swelling of organelles and cells, followed by lysis of the plasma membrane and random DNA degradation. In contrast, apoptosis is a process that is characterized by cell shrinkage, plasma membrane blebbing, nuclear condensation, and endonucleolytic cleavage of DNA into fragments of oligonucleosomal length and is a fundamental and indispensable process during normal embryonic development, tissue homeostasis, and regulation of the immune system (1White E. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar, 2Wyllie A.H. Kerr J.F. Currie A.R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1980; 68: 251-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (6728) Google Scholar, 3Steller H. Science. 1995; 267: 1445-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (2436) Google Scholar). In addition, environmental stressors such as heat shock, radiation, chemical agents, and oxidative stress can also induce apoptosis. These proapoptotic stimuli bring about organellar stress, affecting the nucleus, peroxisome, lysosome, or Golgi apparatus. Most of the apoptosis-inducing signals from these organelles converge at mitochondria. Mitochondria release proteins that promote cell death after cellular stress (4Huang D.C. Strasser A. Cell. 2000; 103: 839-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar). One of these proteins is cytochrome c, which forms a complex with the cytoplasmic protein Apaf-1 and pro-caspase-9, leading to the activation of caspase-9. Caspase-9, in turn, activates caspase-3, the protease that cleaves the majority of caspase substrates during apoptosis. Mitochondria also release apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) 1The abbreviations used are: AIF, apoptosis-inducing factor; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; MEF, mouse embryonal fibroblast; PI, propidium iodide; TUNEL, TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; Nucl.mid, middle portion of Nucling; RT-PCR, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction; BAP, bacterial alkaline phosphatase; zVAD-fmk, benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone; zDQMD-fmk, benzyloxycarbonyl-Asp-Gln-Met-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; CHX, cycloheximide; WT, wild type. and endonuclease G, which appear to kill cells independently of caspases. Therefore, mitochondria are thought to be a central regulatory element in stress-induced apoptosis (5Wang X. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2922-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Nucling was originally isolated from murine embryonal carcinoma cells as a protein, the expression of which was up-regulated during cardiac muscle differentiation (6Sakai T. Liu L. Shishido Y. Fukui K. J Biochem. (Tokyo). 2003; 133: 429-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). A bovine homolog of Nucling, named βCAP73, was isolated and characterized as a novel regulator of β-actin assembly (7Welch A.Y. Herman I.M. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 34: 864-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 8Shuster C.B. Lin A.Y. Nayak R. Herman I.M. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1996; 35: 175-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Recently, we reported that Nucling down-regulates expression of the antiapoptotic molecule, galectin-3, through interference with nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling (9Liu L. Sakai T. Sano N. Fukui K. Biochem. J. 2004; 380: 31-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). It has been reported that galectin-3 is translocated to the perinuclear membranes after exposure to a variety of apoptotic stimuli and becomes abundant in mitochondria, where it prevents mitochondrial damage and cytochrome c release (10Yu F. Finley Jr., R.L. Raz A. Kim H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15819-15827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). These findings led us to investigate whether Nucling is involved in any of the apoptotic signaling pathways. To address this issue, we performed molecular biological analyses, including gene knock-out experiments. In this report, we show that Nucling is a regulatory molecule for stress-induced apoptosis, which interacts with the Apaf-1/pro-caspase-9 complex, thereby acting as a stabilizer for the apoptosome. Nucling was shown to be able to induce apoptosis in mammalian cells and could promote the caspase cascade. Nucling-/- cells showed resistance to cellular stress. Up-regulation of Apaf-1, release of cytochrome c, and activation of caspase-9 induced by cytotoxic stress were not observed in Nucling-/- cells. Two-dimensional native/denaturing-PAGE analysis revealed that Nucling assembles with the Apaf-1/pro-caspase-9 complex in vivo. These findings suggest that Nucling acts as a regulatory factor for stress-induced apoptosis, sustaining the expression level of Apaf-1 by interacting with the Apaf-1/pro-caspase-9 complex. Moreover, this assemblage composed of Nucling, Apaf-1, and caspase-9 was observed in both cytosol and nuclear fractions. Furthermore, we confirmed that Nucling was required for the translocation of Apaf-1 to the nucleus after proapoptotic stress, suggesting that Nucling is a transporter of the Apaf-1/caspase-9 complex to the nucleus. Cell Lines and Culture Conditions—COS7 cells, HeLa cells, and mouse embryonal fibroblast (MEF) cells were used in this study. Cells were maintained in DMEM with 100 units/ml of penicillin, 100 μg/ml of streptomycin, 5 μm mercaptoethanol, and 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum. They were cultured in 10 ml of medium in 95-mm plastic tissue culture plates at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2/95% air in a humidified incubator. For routine propagation, cultures were split, and the growth medium was replenished every three to four days. Construction of Expression Vectors—The cDNA fragment of Nucling was tagged with the sequence encoding the Flag peptide using the vector pFlag-CMV2 (Kodak). Transfection of COS7 Cells with Plasmid DNA—Plasmid DNA was transiently transfected into COS7 cells using the Effecten reagent (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For immunofluorescence microscopic analysis, a sample of COS7 cells was transferred to an eight-well chamber slide for tissue culture and incubated at 37 °C overnight before transfection. Confocal Immunofluorescence Microscopic Analysis—After 24 h of transfection with Flag-Nucling expression plasmid vector or control vector (pFlag-BAP), cells were washed with PBS and incubated with propidium iodine (PI; 3,8-diamino-5-(3-(diethyl-methylamino)propyl)-6-phenyl phenanthridinium diiodide; Sigma) for 20 min at room temperature. After nuclear staining of dead cells with PI, cells were washed with PBS three times and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. For blocking, the cells were incubated with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h. After five washes with PBS, cells were incubated with anti-Flag M5 antibody for 2 h at room temperature. After five washes with PBS, the slides were incubated with FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies against mouse IgG (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h. After five washes with PBS, the slides were mounted with anti-fade solution, sealed, and examined using a confocal laser scanning microscope and software (Leica TCS NT, Heidelberg, Germany). Cell Death Assays—PI staining assays were performed using standard protocols (Oncor). TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) assays were performed using the In Situ Cell Death Detection kit, Fluorescein (Roche) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell death was measured by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assay or trypan blue exclusion assay. For the LDH release assay, the culture medium was centrifuged to remove detached cells, and the supernatants were used to determine the quantitative LDH activity with a Cytotoxicity Detection kit (Roche) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For total LDH activity, cell lysate was prepared from control cells in the culture by adding a 1/100 volume of 10% Triton X-100 into the culture medium, incubated at room temperature for 15 min, and then centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min. For the trypan blue exclusion assay, detached COS7 cells transfected with pFlag-Nucling, or pEGFP-C1 in culture medium, were concentrated by centrifugation (800 × g for 5 min) and resuspended in 100 μl of cold PBS before being incubated with 0.4% trypan blue solution (Sigma) for 10 min. More than 100 cells were scored on a hemocytometer. Western Blot Analysis—Cellular extracts were prepared as described previously (6Sakai T. Liu L. Shishido Y. Fukui K. J Biochem. (Tokyo). 2003; 133: 429-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Antibodies reactive to cytochrome c (BD Biosciences), Apaf-1 (Chemicon), caspase-9 (Cell Signaling), caspase-3 (BD Biosciences), β-actin (Sigma-Aldrich), and the middle portion of Nucling (Nucl.mid) (6Sakai T. Liu L. Shishido Y. Fukui K. J Biochem. (Tokyo). 2003; 133: 429-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) were used in this study. Western blot analysis was carried out according to standard procedures using an ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences) or AP detection kit (Roche). Quantification was performed by comparing densitometric scanning readings using NIH-Image v1.63 software; numbers (arbitrary units) represent values corrected for loading with the data reprobed by β-actin. Northern Blot Analysis—After treatment, COS7 cells were washed with PBS and pelleted by centrifugation. Total RNA was isolated from cells using ISOGEN as described by the manufacturer (Nippon Gene, Toyama, Japan). RNA was fractionated on 2.2 m formaldehyde/1.2% agarose gels and transferred overnight onto Hybond N nylon membranes (Amersham Biosciences) in 10× SSC. The RNA was cross-linked to the membrane using a UV cross-linker (Amersham Biosciences) before hybridization. A specific probe was generated by labeling the cloned cDNA fragment of full-length Nucling with [α-32P]dCTP (NEN, Boston, MA) using Ready-To-Go DNA Labeling Beads (-dCTP) (Amersham Biosciences). After overnight hybridization at 42 °C, the filters were washed once in 2× SSC for 10 min (23 °C) and twice in 0.1× SSC for 15 min (68 °C), covered in plastic wrap, and exposed to Kodak X-Omat AP film at -70 °C for 3-24 h. Generation of Nucling-/- Mice—The genomic DNA containing the Nucling gene was isolated from a 129/Sv mouse genomic library. The targeting vector was constructed by inserting a PGK-neo-poly(A) cassette into a HindIII site of the exon containing the leucine zipper motif region (6Sakai T. Liu L. Shishido Y. Fukui K. J Biochem. (Tokyo). 2003; 133: 429-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) of the Nucling gene. The targeting vector thus contained 0.5- and 5.4-kb regions of homology in the 5′ and 3′ region of the neomycin-resistance marker, respectively. The maintenance, transfection, and selection of embryonic stem cells were performed as described (11Hakem R. Hakem A. Duncan G.S. Henderson J.T. Woo M. Soengas M.S. Elia A. de la Pompa J.L. Kagi D. Khoo W. Potter J. Yoshida R. Kaufman S.A. Lowe S.W. Penninger J.M. Mak T.W. Cell. 1998; 94: 339-352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1171) Google Scholar). The mutant embryonic stem cells were microinjected into C57BL/6 blastocysts, and the resulting male chimeras were mated with female C57BL/6 mice. Heterozygous offspring were intercrossed to produce homozygous mutant animals. All mice were maintained in a specific pathogen-free animal facility. Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)—Total RNA was purified from cells using ISOGEN. RT was performed using 2 μg of total RNA (at 42 °C for 2 h) in a 20-μl reaction volume containing oligo(dT) primer and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The PCR primers, designed based on the published sequence of cytochrome c, and Nucling were 5′-CGAATTAAAAATGGGTGATGTTGAA-3′ (cytochrome c, sense), 5′-GTGGAATTACTCATTAGTAGCCTTTTTAAG-3′ (cytochrome c, antisense), 5′-TGATCACCCAGGACCCGGAAGTTACC-3′ (Nucling, sense), and 5′-GGTGCTCTTTGAGGGCGAGGAAGTG-3′ (Nucling, antisense). The primers 1 and 14 designed by Honarpour et al. (12Honarpour N. Gilbert S.L. Lahn B.T. Wang X. Herz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9683-9687Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) were used for the Apaf-1 message. For PCR, 2 μl of cDNA was used in a 50-μl reaction mixture containing 0.5 mm primers, deoxynucleotide triphosphates, and TaqDNA polymerase, using the cycling profile of 45 s at 94 °C, 1 min at 56 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C for 24 cycles for cytochrome c and 28 cycles for Apaf-1 with a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The cycling profile for Nucling was 1 min at 95 °C, 1 min at 56 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C for 32 cycles with a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. PCR products were analyzed on 2% agarose gel. RT-PCR of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (6Sakai T. Liu L. Shishido Y. Fukui K. J Biochem. (Tokyo). 2003; 133: 429-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) or β-actin was used as a control. Two-dimensional Native/Denaturing-PAGE Analysis of Protein Complexes—Wild-type or Nucling-/- MEF cell lysates were fractionated into cytosol or nuclear fraction as described before (6Sakai T. Liu L. Shishido Y. Fukui K. J Biochem. (Tokyo). 2003; 133: 429-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The fractions were analyzed directly by native-PAGE (13Hansen W.J. Cowan N.J. Welch W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 265-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In short, cell lysates were resolved onto 2-15% precast gels (Daiichi Pure Chemicals Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). For Western blotting, the native gel was soaked in blot buffer (20 mm Tris-base, 150 mm glycine, and 0.08% SDS) for 10 min, and denatured proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA) in the same buffer using the semi-dry blotting technique. Immunodetection was carried out according to standard procedures and was visualized by the ECL method (Amersham Biosciences). For two-dimensional gel analysis, individual lanes were cut out from the first-dimension native gel and layered on top of a 15-25% gradient resolving gel, and a 7% stacking gel was poured over and around the native gel slice. Nucling Is a Potent Promoter of Apoptosis—During the course of our previous study to identify Nucling (6Sakai T. Liu L. Shishido Y. Fukui K. J Biochem. (Tokyo). 2003; 133: 429-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), we had been examining the functional role of this molecule and noticed that the transfection efficiency of the Nucling-expressing plasmid into mammalian culture cells was very low. In addition, the overexpressed Nucling brought about nuclear deformation or fragmentation (data not shown). These findings led us to suspect that Nucling might be able to induce apoptosis. To investigate this possibility, we performed PI staining and TUNEL staining on transfected cells. PI has been used as a marker of cell damage. We first checked whether the nuclei of cells could be stained with PI without permeabilization by immunofluorescence microscopy. An ∼10-fold excess of cells transfected with pFlag-Nucling were stained with PI compared with control cells transfected with pFlag-BAP (data not shown). In addition, we observed a strong correlation between the Flag-Nucling-expressing cells (Fig. 1Aa) and PI-positive cells (Fig. 1, Ab and Ac), whereas no correlation was found between Flag-BAP-expressing cells (control; Fig. 1Ad) and PI-positive cells (Fig. 1, Ae and Af). TUNEL assay also supported the possibility of apoptosis. We found a strong correlation between the Flag-Nucling-expressing cells (Fig. 1Ah) and TUNEL-positive cells (Fig. 1, Ag and Ai), whereas no correlation was found between Flag-BAP-expressing cells (control; Fig. 1Ak) and TUNEL-positive cells (Fig. 1, Aj and Al). To confirm these results concerning cell damage, we investigated the effect of Nucling on cell survival in COS7 cells detected using the transient transfection assay with the LDH release assay. Transfection of the pFlag-Nucling-expressing plasmid in COS7 cells was performed. The LDH release activity in the culture medium was calculated every 24 h for 2 days after transfection. Transfection of pFlag-Nucling led to an increase in LDH activity compared with that of the pFlag-vector control (mock) at 24 and 48 h after transfection (Fig. 1B, columns). At 48 h, an ∼20% increase in LDH activity was observed in Nucling-transfected cells compared with mock-transfected cells. This percentage was in good accord with the estimated transfection efficiency (∼20%, data not shown) of the Nucling expression vector. These results indicate that Nucling possesses an intrinsic cell death-promoting activity. To investigate whether the caspase system is important for the activity of Nucling promoting cell death, we performed a zVAD-fmk inhibition assay. Cell death-inducing activity of the Nucling protein was clearly reduced by zVAD-fmk, a pan- caspase inhibitor (Fig. 1B, □). In addition, the zDQMD-fmk (an inhibitor specific for caspase-3 and caspase-6) treatment assay for the Nucling-overexpressing cells revealed that Nucling can promote cell death by activating caspase-3 or caspase-6, because this treatment clearly suppressed the cell death-inducing activity of Nucling (Fig. 1C). These results suggest that Nucling may be a member of the caspase signaling pathways. Proapoptotic Stimuli Up-regulate Nucling Expression—To assess whether Nucling is a part of the apoptosis signaling pathways, we investigated whether endogenous Nucling expression was regulated by several proapoptotic stimuli. Northern blot analyses revealed that Nucling expression was induced in COS7 cells (Fig. 2Aa) and HeLa cells (data not shown) by tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)/cycloheximide (CHX) (lane 3). Weak up-regulation by H2O2 stress was also observed (lane 2). RT-PCR also revealed that Nucling can be induced by Adriamycin treatment or heat shock stress (Fig. 2Ab). To reconfirm these findings, an immunofluorescence analysis was performed with Nucl.mid antibody to detect the endogenous Nucling protein. We could detect many apoptotic cells by immunofluorescence analysis after TNF-α/CHX treatment for 24 h. Most of the TUNEL-positive cells after TNF-α/CHX treatment expressed endogenous Nucling (Fig. 2B, upper panel). The same results were obtained using H2O2 (1 mm) in COS7 cells. Most of the TUNEL-positive cells following H2O2 stress expressed endogenous Nucling as well (lower panel). To obtain the overall induction profile of endogenous Nucling expression during cellular stress, we examined expression patterns under different degrees of apoptotic stimulation. Serial concentrations of H2O2 were used to induce stepwise stimuli for apoptosis in COS7 cells. Immunofluorescent staining using Nucl.mid antibody was performed to reveal the expression pattern of endogenous Nucling. At 24 h after trypsinization for subculture without any other forms of apoptotic stress, we observed spots of staining in nuclei in some of the cells (Fig. 2C, 0 mm). At 48 h after the subculture, we could not observe any immunodetection cells with Nucl.mid antibody (data not shown). Mild apoptotic stress (0.5 mm H2O2 stress) induced Nucling expression in the nucleus (Fig. 2C, arrowheads), whereas the staining intensity and the increase in positive cell numbers became more evident under severe apoptotic stress (1 mm H2O2 stress) (representatives are indicated by arrows in Fig. 2C). These results suggest that endogenous Nucling is induced by apoptotic stress in a dose-dependent manner. Nucling Is Required for UV Irradiation-induced Apoptosis—To further address the issue of the physiological function of Nucling in vivo, we next generated Nucling-/- mutant mice. We constructed a targeting vector designed to insert the neomycin-resistance cassette into the exon encoding the LZ motif (Fig. 3A). Germline transmission was achieved from two independent clones and confirmed by Southern blot analysis (Fig. 3B). Both heterozygous and homozygous Nucling-/- mice are viable and fertile. Northern blot analysis of total RNA extracted from adult (8-week) wild-type (WT), heterozygous, and homozygous hearts and skeletal muscle using the XbaI fragment of Nucling cDNA as a probe confirmed the absence of Nucling mRNA transcripts in homozygous-deficient mice (Fig. 3C). Thus, our targeting strategy resulted in a null allele for the Nucling gene. To obtain direct evidence that Nucling deficiency leads to defects in the regulatory mechanism for stress-induced apoptosis, we investigated the cell-death response to UV irradiation-induced cellular stress. Exposure to excessive UV irradiation is known to cause apoptosis in murine fibroblasts (14Kimura H. Minakami H. Sekiguchi I. Otsuki K. Shoji A. J Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 126: 340-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In addition, we further reported that Nucling down-regulated the antiapoptotic factor, galectin-3, via the modification of NF-κB activation (9Liu L. Sakai T. Sano N. Fukui K. Biochem. J. 2004; 380: 31-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The activation of NF-κB is known to be induced by UV irradiation, followed by the up-regulation of galectin-3 transcription. At first, we prepared MEFs from WT or Nucling-/- embryos. Western blot analysis was performed to check the expression of Nucling in WT MEFs. We could detect a distinct Nucling band in WT MEFs but not in Nucling-/- MEFs (Fig. 3D). Next, we investigated the reactivity of Nucling-/- MEFs to a proapoptotic stress using UV irradiation. UV irradiation induced an increase in cell death in WT MEFs as compared with Nucling-/- MEFs (Fig. 4). Although the total amount of LDH in Nucling-/- MEFs was less than that in WT MEFs, significant levels of cell killing were observed, arguing that UV irradiation-induced apoptosis has a partial Nucling dependence. Therefore, we assumed that Nucling regulates one or some of the many apoptotic pathways induced by cytotoxic stress from UV irradiation. Nucling May Play a Critical Role in the Expression of Apoptosome-related Molecules—To elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying the apoptosis-promoting activity of Nucling, we investigated expression levels or activation patterns of several candidate molecules related to stress-induced apoptosis. We compared first the expression levels of Apaf-1 between WT and Nucling-/- mice in MEFs treated with H2O2 (Fig. 5A) or UV irradiation (Fig. 5B). At first, we determined whether any defect occurred in the activation of caspase-9 in Nucling-/- MEFs. Immunoblot analysis revealed that not only the proenzyme of caspase-9 (pro-caspase-9) but also some of the processed type of caspase-9 (p37) does exist in WT MEFs, but no processing was observed in Nucling-/- MEFs under normal culture conditions (Fig. 5, A and B, lanes 1 and 2). In addition, this tendency was also observed in response to the apoptotic stimulus of H2O2 (Fig. 5A, lanes 3 and 4) or UV irradiation (Fig. 5B, lanes 5 and 6). The apoptotic pathway mediated by caspase-9 is initiated by the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria (15Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6261) Google Scholar, 16Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2746) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the expression level of cytochrome c in these MEFs. Exposure of WT MEFs to H2O2 caused a large increase in cytoplasmic cytochrome c (Fig. 5A, lane 3). The same result was observed using UV irradiation. In contrast, the apoptotic stress of H2O2 or UV irradiation did not cause cytochrome c up-regulation in Nucling-/- MEFs. In addition, the expression level of cytochrome c in whole-cell lysate from Nucling-/- MEFs was also reduced after H2O2 treatment or UV irradiation (Fig. 5, A and B). Western blot analysis revealed that the total level of cytochrome c in the normal culture without proapoptotic stress was almost the same between WT and Nucling-/- MEFs (Cyto c (whole), lanes 1 and 2). In contrast, cytochrome c expression was remarkably down-regulated in Nucling-/- MEFs compared with WT MEFs after the proapoptotic stress (Fig. 5, lanes 3 and 4 in A, lanes 3-6 in B). These results indicate that Nucling is essential for the up-regulation of cytochrome c in response to apoptotic stimuli but not for the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. Western blot analysis also revealed that Apaf-1 was strikingly down-regulated in its expression in Nucling-/- MEFs after proapoptotic stress (H2O2 in Fig. 5A and UV irradiation in Fig. 5B). In contrast, the expression level of AIF, a mitochondrial apoptosis-inducing factor, was the same in both WT and Nucling-/- MEFs (Fig. 5B). Active caspase-9 (p37) was not detectable in Nucling-/- MEFs (Fig. 5, A and B). Pro-caspase-3 (apoptosis executioner regulated by caspase-9) remained in its inactive form in Nucling-/- MEFs (Fig. 5A, lane 4). This observation can be explained by the absence of p37 in Nucling-/- mice. These results strongly suggest that Nucling may be an apoptosis-promoting factor specifically regulating the Apaf-1/cytochrome c/caspase-9 apoptosome pathway after cellular stress. Semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that the transcriptional levels of both cytochrome c and Apaf-1 expression were not decreased in Nucling-/- MEFs under proapoptotic conditions as shown in Fig. 5C. Both the 0.3-kb fragment of cytochrome c and the 0.5-kb fragment of Apaf-1 were amplified from the RNAs of WT and Nucling-/- MEFs. We could not observe any obvious change in the amplification reactions between these MEFs in response to the proapoptotic stimuli. Consequently, we postulated that the down-regulation of cytochrome c in Nucling-/- MEFs comes from the post-transcriptional regulation of the apoptosome molecules, Apaf-1 and cytochrome c, after proapoptotic stress. Therefore, we focused on investigating the regulatory role of Nucling for the apoptosome components in terms of their interactions at the protein level. Nucling Plays a Critical Role in the Nuclear Translocation of Apaf-1 after Proapoptotic Stress—To confirm whether Nucling intrinsically up-regulates Apaf-1, a double immunostaining assay was performed after transfection of the Nucling expression vector into COS7 cells. The intensity of red-stained endogenous Apaf-1 was up-regulated in most of the Nucling-overexpressing cells (green in Fig. 6A). Very interestingly, the staining pattern of Apaf-1 in the Nucling-overexpressing cells was different from that of nontransfected cells. Ectopic expression of Nucling induced translocation of Apaf-1 from cytoplasm to nucleus (Fig. 6A). To investigate whether Nucling physiologically regulates the nuclear translocation of Apaf-1, we checked the expression profiles of Apaf-1 in WT and Nucling-/- MEFs after UV irradiation (Fig. 6B). We first confirmed the nuclear redistribution of Apaf-1 in WT MEFs after proapoptotic stress as reported previously (17Ruiz-Vela A. Gonzalez de Buitrago G. Martinez A.C. FEBS Lett. 2002; 517: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We found that cytochrome c redistributes 8 h after UV irradiation, forming a ring structure (indicated by an arrow in Fig. 6Bg). In addition, we detected a diffuse cytochrome c pattern in the nucleus (arrowhead in Fig. 6Bg) at the time point when >40% of cells were clearly apoptotic (data not shown). In contrast, Apaf-1 was translocated to the nucleus in most of the cytochrome c redistributed cells (yellow arrows in Fig. 6Bh). In Nucling-/- MEFs, up-regulation of c"

In addition, NC destabilizes the highly structured complementary trans-activation response element (TAR) stem-loop (TAR DNA) at the 3′-end of (-) SSDNA and inhibits TAR-induced self-priming, a dead-end reaction that competes with minus-strand transfer. To investigate the relationship between nucleic acid secondary structure and NC function, a series of truncated (-) SSDNA and acceptor RNA constructs were used to assay minus-strand transfer and self-priming in vitro. The results were correlated with extensive enzymatic probing and mFold analysis. As the length of (-) SSDNA was decreased, self-priming increased and was highest when the DNA contained little more than TAR DNA, even if NC and acceptor were both present; in contrast, truncations within TAR DNA led to a striking reduction or elimination of self-priming. However, destabilization of TAR DNA was not sufficient for successful strand transfer: the stability of acceptor RNA was also crucial, and little or no strand transfer occurred if the RNA was highly stable. Significantly, NC may not be required for in vitro strand transfer if (-) SSDNA and acceptor RNA are small, relatively unstructured molecules with low thermodynamic stabilities. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that for efficient NC-mediated minus-strand transfer, a delicate thermodynamic balance between the RNA and DNA reactants must be maintained.

These short DNAs mimic the small RNA fragments produced by degradation of genomic RNA during minus-strand DNA synthesis (56Driscoll M.D. Hughes S.H. J.

However, when NC and acceptor RNA are both present, there is a dramatic shift in the majority of the TAR DNA molecules to an unfolded state, which blocks self-priming and enables successful strand transfer to occur (25Hong M.K.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 4847-4855Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In this work, we have examined the effect of nucleic acid secondary structure upon the ability of NC to stimulate efficient minus-strand transfer and have focused on structural determinants in both (-) SSDNA and acceptor RNA. Our approach was to test a series of truncated (-) SSDNA and acceptor RNA constructs using an in vitro assay that mimics the biologically relevant events of minus-strand transfer. The results of these assays are interpreted in terms of nucleic acid stability as judged by enzymatic probing and mFold analysis of individual (-) SSDNA or acceptor RNA constructs. Surprisingly, we found that destabilization of (-) SSDNA alone and elimination of self-priming by disruption of the TAR DNA stem-loop did not necessarily result in an increase in strand transfer: destabilization of acceptor RNA structure was also required. Thus, NC mediates efficient strand transfer only if both (-) SSDNA and acceptor RNA are moderately structured. Collectively, these results demonstrate that a delicate balance must exist between the stabilities of intramolecular secondary structures in (-) SSDNA and acceptor RNA and the stability of the intermolecular strand transfer duplex. Proteins—HIV-1 RT was obtained from Worthington. Micrococcal nuclease (MNase) was purchased from U. S. Biochemical Corp. (Cleveland, OH). The following enzymes were obtained from Ambion Inc. (Austin, TX): DNase I, RNase T1, RNase A, RNase V1, S1 nuclease, and proteinase K. Taq DNA polymerase was obtained from Roche Applied Science. Wild-type HIV-1 NC was a generous gift from Dr. Robert Gorelick (SAIC Frederick, Inc., NCI-Frederick, Frederick, MD). The protein was prepared as described previously (28Wu W. Henderson L.E. Copeland T.D. Gorelick R.J. Bosche W.J. Rein A. Levin J.G. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 7132-7142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids and Synthetic (-) SSDNAs—Plasmid pJA has been described previously (51Guo J. Henderson L.E. Bess J. Kane B. Levin J.G. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 5178-5188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); it contains the 3′-half of HIV-1 pNL4-3 DNA (70Adachi A. Gendelman H.E. Koenig S. Folks T. Willey R. Rabson A. Martin M.A. J. Virol. 1986; 59: 284-291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), starting from the EcoRI site at nt 5743 and including all of U5. This plasmid was used for preparation of the 148-nt acceptor RNA by linearizing the DNA with FspI (New England Biolabs Inc., Beverly, MA). Linearized DNA was purified by extracting with 1:1 (v/v) phenol/chloroform, precipitating with ethanol, and resuspending in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water to a final concentration of 1 μg/μl. Synthetic (-) SSDNAs of varying lengths were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). The DNAs were purified by the company by PAGE and resuspended in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water prior to use. PCR Amplification of Transcription Templates—DNA templates for transcription of acceptor RNA truncation mutants were prepared by PCR amplification of pJA (51Guo J. Henderson L.E. Bess J. Kane B. Levin J.G. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 5178-5188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In all cases, the upstream primer included a T7 promoter, whereas the downstream primer defined the 3′-end of the RNA transcript. PCR primers were obtained from either Lofstrand Laboratories Ltd. (Gaithersburg, MD) or Integrated DNA Technologies. The sequences for the upstream primers were as follows: for RNAs 117, 104, and 84, 5′-TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG GGA GTG GCG AGC CCT CAG; for RNAs 100, 87, and 67, 5′-TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG GAT GCT GCA TAT AAG CAG CTG; and for RNAs 70 and 50, 5′-TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG GCT GCT TTT TGC CTG TAC TGG. The sequences for the downstream primers were as follows: for RNAs 117 and 100, 5′-CAG TGG GTT CCC TAG TTA; for RNAs 104, 87, and 70, 5′-AGT TAG CCA GAG AGC TCC CAG; and for RNAs 84, 67, and 50, 5′-GGC TCA GAT CTG GTC. RNAs 100, 87, 70, 67, and 50 all contained an additional G at their 5′-end to facilitate transcription by T7 RNA polymerase (71Milligan J.F. Groebe D.R. Witherell G.W. Uhlenbeck O.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8783-8798Crossref PubMed Scopus (1869) Google Scholar). PCRs were performed with Taq DNA polymerase, and the products were purified with commercial kits (Promega or Amersham Biosciences). The purified DNA was resuspended in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water to a final concentration of 0.5-1 μg/μl. RNA Preparation—RNAs were transcribed in vitro using the T7-MEGAshortscript kit (Ambion Inc.) following the protocol supplied by the manufacturer. Following incubation, the transcription products were precipitated with ethanol, and unincorporated ribonucleoside triphosphates were removed by purification over a Chromaspin-30 column (Clontech) or by denaturing PAGE on a 6% gel.

https://openalex.org/W1997451186,"Almost all observations on the functions of neutral ceramidase have been carried out at cellular levels but not at an individual level. Here, we report the molecular cloning of zebrafish neutral ceramidase (znCD) and its functional analysis during embryogenesis. We isolated a cDNA clone encoding znCD by 5′ and 3′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends-PCR. It possessed an open reading frame of 2,229 base pairs encoding 743 amino acids. A possible signal/anchor sequence near the N terminus and four potential O-glycosylation and eight potential N-glycosylation sites were found in the putative sequence. The enzyme activity at neutral pH increased markedly after transformation of Chinese hamster CHOP and zebrafish BRF41 cells with the cDNA. The overexpressed enzyme was found to be distributed in endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi compartments as well as the plasma membranes. The antisense morpholino oligonucleotide (AMO), which was designed based on the sequence of znCD mRNA, successfully blocked the translation of znCD in a wheat germ in vitro translation system. The knockdown of znCD with AMO led to an increase in the number of zebrafish embryos with severe morphological and cellular abnormalities such as abnormal morphogenesis in the head and tail, pericardiac edema, defect of blood cell circulation, and an increase of apoptotic cells, especially in the head and neural tube regions, at 36 h post-fertilization. The ceramide level in AMO-injected embryos increased significantly compared with that in control embryos. Simultaneous injection of both AMO and synthetic znCD mRNA into one-cell-stage embryos rescued znCD activity and blood cell circulation. These results indicate that znCD is essential for the metabolism of ceramide and the early development of zebrafish.

Ceramidase (CDase, EC 3.5.1.23), which catalyzes the hydrolysis of the N-acyl linkage of Cer, serves to control the intracellular levels of Sph/Cer and possibly S1P and then regulate the cell functions.

Chem. 1995; 270: 23305-23309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Acharya et al. reported that targeted expression of neutral CDase rescued retinal degeneration in arrestin and phospholipase C mutants of Drosophila, correlating with a decrease in Cer (16Acharya U. Patel S. Koundakjian E. Nagashima K. Han X. Acharya J.K. Science. 2003; 299: 1740-1743Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Very recently, they reported that neutral ceramidase could modulate the endocytosis of rhodopsin in Drosophila photoreceptors (17Acharya U. Mowen B.M. Nagashima K. Acharya J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1922-1926Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that neutral CDase could keep a normal level of Cer in cells, and Cer metabolism seems to be important for the functions of photoreceptors in Drosophila. Interestingly, neutral CDases of bacteria (18Okino N. Tani M. Imayama S. Ito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14368-14373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and Drosophila (9Yoshimura Y. Okino N. Tani M. Ito M. J. Biochem. 2002; 132: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) were solely detached from the cells as a soluble form, whereas those of mammalian origins were mainly recovered in membrane fractions (19Tani M. Okino N. Mitsutake S. Tanigawa T. Izu H. Ito M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3462-3468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Recently, we clarified the reason for this discrepancy at the molecular level, i.e. the latter possesses a mucin-like domain (mucin box) near the N terminus that is glycosylated with O-glycans, whereas the former completely lacks this specific domain. A deletion mutant CDase that lacks the mucin box and an Ala replacement mutant CDase in which all Ser or Thr residues in the mucin box are replaced by Ala were not retained in the cell membranes, indicating that O- glycosylation of the mucin box is required to keep the enzyme at the plasma membrane. The mammalian CDase was found to be expressed on plasma membranes as a type II integral protein in which the N-terminal hydrophobic sequence just before the mucin box serves as an anchor to the membranes, and on some occasions the enzyme was detached from the cell via processing of the anchor (20Tani M. Iida H. Ito M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10523-10530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In this study, we cloned the neutral CDase from zebrafish, a well known vertebrate model, and examined the functions of the enzyme during embryogenesis by knockdown of the enzyme using the antisense morpholino oligonucleotide (AMO). It was revealed that the enzyme, which possesses a mucin box, is essential for the metabolism of Cer and the early development of zebrafish. Materials—Chinese hamster CHOP cells and zebrafish BRF41 cells were donated by Dr. K. Nara (Mitsubishi Kagaku Institute of Life Sciences, Tokyo Japan) and Dr. H. Mitani (Department of Biological Sciences, University of Tokyo), respectively. The pCS2+ vector and Cer kinase cDNA, pCR/hCERK, was provided by Dr. S. Takada (National Institute for Basic Biology, Okazaki, Japan) and Dr. T. Kohama (Sankyo Co.), respectively. The anti-Rab6 antibody was provided by Dr. S. Tanaka (Shizuoka University, Shizuoka, Japan). HRP-labeled anti-mouse IgG antibody was purchased from Nacalai Tesque (Tokyo, Japan). Cy3-labeled anti-mouse IgG antibody and the anti-calnexin antibody were obtained from Sigma. ECL Plus and Cy3-labeled anti-rabbit IgG antibody were from Amersham Biosciences. The anti-myc antibody was purchased from Invitrogen. The anti-neutral rat CDase antibody was raised in a rabbit using recombinant CDase as the antigen (10Mitsutake S. Tani M. Okino N. Mori K. Ichinose S. Omori A. Iida H. Nakamura T. Ito M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26249-26259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). C12-NBD-Cer was prepared as described (21Tani M. Kita K. Komori H. Nakagawa T. Ito M. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 263: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). All other reagents were of the highest purity available. Cloning of the cDNA Encoding Neutral CDase—To obtain a DNA fragment encoding zebrafish neutral CDase (znCD), PCR amplification was performed using sense and antisense oligonucleotide primers based on the cDNA sequence of mouse neutral CDase (AB037111); the sense primer (5′-TCCCTGGGGAATTAACAACCATGT-3′) and antisense primer (5′-TCTGAAGAGTTGGATGTATGCAGA-3′) were used for PCR with the cDNA library of adult zebrafish as a template in a GeneAmp PCR System 9700 (Applied Biosystems) using AmpliTaq Gold (Applied Biosystems). The cycling parameters for PCR were 94 °C for 30 s, 45 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min, and the cycle number was 35. An amplified 228-bp PCR product containing the putative CDase sequence was subcloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega) and then sequenced. Further 5′- and 3′-znCD cDNA sequences were obtained by reverse transcription PCR from adult zebrafish mRNA by using the SMART-RACE cDNA amplification kit (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The specific primer sequence used for 5′-RACE, 5′-AGAGTGTGAGGGCCAAAAATGGTGGAT-3′, was based on the fragment mentioned above. Similarly, the specific primer sequence used for 3′-RACE, 5′-AGGGCGGACGTGTAAACCAGCTCTG-3′, was based on the clone obtained by 5′-RACE. To obtain a cDNA containing the putative znCD ORF, PCR was performed using a sense primer with a KpnI site (5′-GGGTACCATGGCGAGTAAGAGTCGT-3′) or a BamHI site (5′-GGGATCCATGGCGAGTAAGAGTCGT-3′) and an antisense primer with a XhoI site and a disrupted stop codon (5′-CCTCGAGAAAGTAGTAGAAACTTCT-3′). The PCR product was subcloned into pcDNA3.1/Myc-His(+) (Invitrogen) and pCS2+ vectors to generate pcDNA/znCD and pCS/znCD, respectively. Cell Culture and Transfection—CHOP cells, Chinese hamster ovary cells that express a polyoma LT antigen to support the replication of eukaryotic expression vectors (22Hefferman M. Dennis W.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), were grown at 37 °C in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2. Zebrafish BRF41 cells were grown at 33 °C in Leibovitz's L-15 medium supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin. cDNA transfection was carried out using LipofectAMINE™ Plus (Invitrogen) for CHOP cells and LipofectAMINE™ 2000 (Invitrogen) for BRF41 cells according to the manufacturer's instructions. Preparation of the Enzyme from Cultured Cells and Embryos—To prepare cell lysates, cells attached to the culture plate were scraped off and collected in a 1.5-ml tube by centrifugation. The cell pellets were rinsed with PBS, suspended in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 μg/ml chymostatin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A, and 2 mm EDTA), and then lysed by sonication. To prepare the enzymes from embryos, embryos were washed with PBS, suspended in lysis buffer, and then lysed by sonication. Protein Assay, SDS-PAGE, and Western Blotting—Protein content was determined by the bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. SDS-PAGE was carried out according to the method of Laemmli (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207012) Google Scholar). Protein transfer onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was performed using Trans-Blot SD (Bio-Rad) according to the method described in a previous study (24Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44893) Google Scholar). After treatment with 3% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h, the membrane was incubated with the primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. After a wash with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20, the membrane was incubated with an HRP-conjugated secondary antibody for 2 h. After another wash with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20, the ECL reaction was performed for 2-3 min as recommended by the manufacturer, and chemiluminescent signals were visualized on an ECL™ Mini-camera (Amersham Biosciences). CDase Assay—CDase activity was measured using C12-NBD-Cer as a substrate as described (18Okino N. Tani M. Imayama S. Ito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14368-14373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 21Tani M. Kita K. Komori H. Nakagawa T. Ito M. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 263: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, 400 pmol (for cell lysates) or 2 nmol (for embryo lysates) of C12-NBD-Cer was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with an appropriate amount of enzyme in 40 μl of reaction mix (50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.05% Triton X-100). For embryo lysates, C12-NBD-Cer was dissolved in methanol and then added to the buffer to dissolve the substrate completely (final concentration of methanol, 10%). The reaction was stopped by adding 100 μl of chloroform/methanol (2:1; v/v), and the lower layer was applied to a Silica Gel 60 TLC plate (Merck), which was then developed with chloroform/methanol/25% ammonia (90:20:0.5; v/v). The NBD-dodecanoic acid released and the C12-NBD-Cer remaining were quantified with a Shimadzu CS-9300 chromatoscanner (Shimadzu, Japan). One enzyme unit was defined as the amount capable of catalyzing the release of 1 μmol of NBD-dodecanoic acid per minute under the conditions described above. A value of 10-3 and 10-6 units of the enzyme was expressed as 1 milliunit and 1 microunit, respectively, in this study. Sphingomyelinase Assay—The activity of sphingomyelinase was measured at pH 4.5 using C6-NBD-sphingomyelin (Matreya, Inc.) as a substrate. Five hundred picomoles of C6-NBD-sphingomyelin was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with 80 μg of embryo lysate in 20 μl of reaction mix (50 mm acetate buffer, pH 4.5, containing 0.5% Triton X-100). Immunoprecipitation of znCD—Anti-neutral CDase antibody at a dilution of 1:100 was incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with 10 μl of protein A-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in 100 μl of reaction buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin). After five washes with reaction buffer, the protein A-agarose-conjugated antibody was resuspended in 900 μl of reaction buffer to which 100 μl of denatured sample (described below) was added, and then incubation was conducted at 4 °C overnight. Before immunoprecipitation, the sample was denatured by boiling for 5 min in 100 μl of SDS sample buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 1% SDS and 1% 2-mercaptoethanol). The precipitate was spun down by centrifugation, washed with reaction buffer five times, and then suspended in 20 μl of SDS sample buffer. After boiling at 100 °C for 5 min, the sample was subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting as described above. Immunocytochemistry of znCD—Transfected cells were cultured on cover glass and then fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min. After being rinsed with PBS and 50 mm NH4Cl in PBS, cells were permeabilized, if necessary, by 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. After treatment with 5% skim milk in PBS (blocking buffer) for 15 min, the samples were incubated with an anti-myc antibody diluted 1:2000 with blocking buffer at 4 °C overnight followed by incubation with Cy3-labeled anti-mouse IgG antibody at room temperature for 2 h. Samples were observed with a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Digital Eclipse C1, Nikon, Japan). Immunohistochemistry of znCD—Zebrafish intestines were fixed with 5% paraformaldehyde in PBS at 4 °C overnight, rinsed with PBS, and then infiltrated with 20% sucrose in PBS at 4 °C overnight. The materials were embedded in OCT compound (Sakura Finetechnical, Japan), rapidly frozen using liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C. The frozen materials were cut into 9-μm-thick sections using a Cryostat (Leica CM1850, Germany) and mounted on poly-l-lysine-coated glass slides. After treatment with blocking buffer at room temperature for 20 min, the samples were incubated with the anti-neutral rat CDase antiserum diluted 1:100 with a blocking buffer at 4 °C overnight followed by Cy3-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Biosciences) at room temperature for 1.5 h. Immunostained samples were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated phalloidin (Sigma) to visualize actin filaments. In Vitro Translation of znCD—In vitro transcription and translation of zebrafish neutral CDase was performed by using the PROTEIOS wheat germ cell-free protein synthesis kit (Toyobo). For the preparation of mRNA, a znCD with a myc tag construct was generated by PCR using pcDNA/znCD as a template, the sense primer with a KpnI site mentioned above, and the antisense primer with a SalI site (5′-GGGTGTCGACTCAATGGTGATGATGATGA-3′) and then cloned into a pEU vector named pEU/znCD. In vitro transcription was performed using pEU/znCD as a template and T7 RNA polymerase according to the manufacturer's protocol. In vitro translation was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol with the following modifications. In a 25 μl reaction, 7 μg of transcribed mRNA of the enzyme and various amounts of AMOs (1-50 μm at the final concentration) were added to the reaction mixture that contained all of the required components for in vitro translation in a 96-well microplate and incubated at 25 °C for 20 h. Twelve microliters from the reaction mixture was withdrawn and then subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE, and proteins were visualized using an anti-myc antibody. Preparation and Injection of AMOs—AMOs were designed with sequences complementary to cDNA encoding znCD around the initiating start codon based on the manufacturer's recommendations (Fig. 7A). Three AMOs and a four-base mismatched AMO were synthesized: AMO1, 5′-GACGACGACTCTTACTCGCCATCAC-3′; AMO2, 5′-CGACTCTTACTCGCCATCACGATTG-3′; AMO3, 5′-GGAGCCGACAGTAAATGGTGTAGAT-3′; and four-base mismatched AMO, 5′-GAgGACcACTCTTACTCcCCAaCAC-3′. An inert standard control oligonucleotide, which has no sequence similarity to zebrafish genes, was used as a control. Morpholino oligonucleotides were solubilized in sterile water at a concentration of 10 μg/μl. The stock solution was diluted to working concentrations in water before injection into one- to four-cell stage embryos. Injected embryos were cultured in E3 medium (5 mm NaCl, 0.17 mm KCl, 0.33 mm CaCl2, and 0.33 mm MgSO4) at 28 °C for specific periods. The injection of AMO and a control oligonucleotide was performed according to the method of Nasevicius and Ekker (25Nasevicius A. Ekker S.C. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 216-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (2116) Google Scholar). Acridine Orange Staining—Embryos were stained with the vital dye acridine orange (Sigma) to detect the apoptotic cells. Embryos were placed in the dye (2 μg/ml) in E3 medium. After treatment with the dye for 30 min, embryos were washed with E3 medium. The visualization and photography was performed using an MZFLIII (Leica, Germany) fluorescence microscope and the Cool Pix 990 (Nikon, Japan) camera system. Preparation of Recombinant Cer Kinase—CHOP cells were transformed with human Cer kinase cDNA, pCR/hCERK, using LipofectAMINE™ Plus (26Sugiura M. Kono K. Shimizugawa T. Minekura H. Spiegel S. Kohama T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23294-23300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). After 2 days of culture, cells were scraped off and collected in a 1.5-ml tube by centrifugation. The cell pellet was rinsed with PBS, suspended in lysis buffer (20 mm Mops, pH 7, containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and proteinase inhibitors), lysed by sonication, and subjected to centrifugation (100,000 × g for 1 h). The precipitated membrane fraction was resuspended in lysis buffer. The specific activity of Cer kinase prepared was 1,460 units/mg. One unit of the Cer kinase is defined as the amount capable of generating 1 pmol of Cer-1-phospate per minute under the conditions described in (27Bektas M. Jolly S.P. Milstein S. Spiegel S. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 320: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Lipid Extraction—After removal of the chorions, zebrafish embryos were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Then, the yolk was carefully removed with forceps under a microscope. Lipid extraction was conducted as described (26Sugiura M. Kono K. Shimizugawa T. Minekura H. Spiegel S. Kohama T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23294-23300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 27Bektas M. Jolly S.P. Milstein S. Spiegel S. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 320: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Briefly, 500 μl of methanol was added to the sample, and then the sample was lysed by sonication. Next, 500 μl of chloroform and 450 μl of H2O were added, and the phases were separated by centrifugation. The organic phase was dried using a speed vacuum and resuspended in micelles by brief sonication in 20 μl of 10 mm imidazole, 7.5% of β-octylglucoside, 5 mm cardiolipin, and 0.2 mm diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DETAPAC). Measurement of Cer Content Using Cer Kinase—To measure the Cer content of zebrafish embryos, a Cer kinase assay was employed as described (27Bektas M. Jolly S.P. Milstein S. Spiegel S. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 320: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) with a minor modification. To 60 μl of 20 mm Mops buffer, pH 7, containing 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 3 mm CaCl2 were added 20 μl of sample (solubilized lipids or standard Cer) and 10 μl of recombinant Cer kinase (20 μg, 29 units). Reactions were initiated by adding 10 μl of [γ-32P]ATP (5 μCi; 10 mm in 100 mm MgCl2). After incubation at 30 °C for 30 min, reactions were stopped by the addition of 0.6 ml of chloroform/methanol (1:1; v/v). After a few seconds of vortexing, 250 μl of 1 m KCl in 20 mm Mops, pH 7, was added and then centrifuged. After the drying up of the organic phase, lipids were dissolved in an aliquot of chloroform/methanol (1:1; v/v) and then spotted on a thin layer chromatography plate that was developed with chloroform/acetone/methanol/acetic acid/water (10:4:3:2:1; v/v). Using an imaging analyzer FLA5000 (Fuji Film, Japan), radioactive bands were visualized and quantified. Rescue of znCD Activity by znCD mRNA Injection—For the preparation of mRNA, a znCD construct was generated by PCR using pcDNA/znCD and cloned into a pCS2+ vector. Capped mRNA was synthesized from the znCD construct using mMESSAGE mMACHINE (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The synthesized mRNA and AMO3 were simultaneously injected into the yolk of embryos. For the control experiment, the same amount of AMO3, but without the mRNA, was injected into embryos. The sequence of znCD mRNA did not overlap with that of AMO3. cDNA Cloning of Zebrafish Neutral CDase—To obtain a DNA fragment encoding znCD, PCR amplification was conducted using primers designed from a mouse neutral CDase sequence (AB037111) and the cDNA library from an adult zebrafish as a template as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Then, 5′- and 3′-RACE PCR were performed to obtain the putative ORF of znCD. Finally, a cDNA clone encoding the znCD ORF was subcloned into the pcDNA3.1/Myc-His(+) vector (Invitrogen) to give pcDNA/znCD. The ORF of the znCD gene was 2,229-bp long and encoded 743 amino acid residues (Fig. 1A). The znCD exhibits sequence identity to other neutral CDases, i.e. 32.7% for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 40.6% for Dictyostelium discoideum, 40.2% for Drosophila melanogaster, 57.2% for mouse, 57.2% for rat, and 59.8% for human, respectively. The predicted molecular weight and pI of the enzyme were 82,065 and 6.04, respectively, judging from the deduced amino acid sequence. The ORF contained eight potential N-glycosylation sites (Fig. 1A, underlined sequences). A hydrophobicity analysis revealed the presence of a prominent hydrophobic segment in the N terminus indicative of a putative signal/anchor sequence (Fig. 1B). Like neutral CDases from mammals, znCD has a Ser/Thr/Pro-rich domain (mucin-like domain) just downstream of the N-terminal hydrophobic region in which four potential O-glycosylation sites were found (Fig. 1A, circles). An alignment of the mucin-like domain of the znCD with that of other neutral CDases is shown in Fig. 1C. Interestingly, this specific domain is present in neutral CDases from vertebrates but not in enzymes from invertebrates such as bacteria, fruit fly, and slime mold. Expression and Characterization of the znCD in CHOP and BRF41 Cells—To verify whether pcDNA/znCD encodes the neutral CDase, CHOP and BRF41 cells were transfected with pcDNA/znCD, and the CDase activity in cell lysates and culture supernatants was then measured using C12-NBD-Cer as a substrate at pH 7.5. The activity of the CDase in cell lysates of the transfected CHOP (Fig. 2A) and BRF41 (Fig. 2B) cells increased markedly compared with that of mock transfectants (mock) or untransfected cells (data not shown). A part of the activity, possibly from the enzyme detached from the cells by processing of the N-terminal signal/anchor sequence, was detected in the culture supernatants of the transfected CHOP"
https://openalex.org/W2039648580,"G protein-coupled receptor kinase-2 (GRK2) can phosphorylate and desensitize the platelet-derived growth factor receptor-β (PDGFRβ) in heterologous cellular systems. To determine whether GRK2 regulates the PDGFRβ in physiologic systems, we examined PDGFRβ signaling in mouse embryonic fibroblasts from GRK2-null and cognate wild type mice. To discern a mechanism by which GRK2-mediated phosphorylation can desensitize the PDGFRβ, but not the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), we investigated effects of GRK2-mediated phosphorylation on the association of the PDGFRβ with the Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor (NHERF), a protein shown to potentiate dimerization of the PDGFRβ, but not the EGFR. Physiologic expression of GRK2 diminished (a) phosphoinositide hydrolysis elicited through the PDGFRβ but not heterotrimeric G proteins; (b) Akt activation evoked by the PDGFRβ but not the EGFR; and (c) PDGF-induced tyrosyl phosphorylation of the PDGFRβ itself. PDGFRβ desensitization by physiologically expressed GRK2 correlated with a 2.5-fold increase in PDGF-promoted PDGFRβ seryl phosphorylation. In 293 cells, GRK2 overexpression reduced PDGFRβ/NHERF association by 60%. This effect was reproduced by S1104D mutation of the PDGFRβ, which also diminished PDGFRβ activation and signaling (like the S1104A mutation) to an extent equivalent to that achieved by GRK2-mediated PDGFRβ phosphorylation. GRK2 overexpression desensitized only the wild type but not the S1104A PDGFRβ. We conclude that GRK2-mediated PDGFRβ seryl phosphorylation plays an important role in desensitizing the PDGFRβ in physiologic systems. Furthermore, this desensitization appears to involve GRK2-mediated phosphorylation of PDGFRβ Ser1104, with consequent dissociation of the PDGFRβ from NHERF.

GRK2 is a ubiquitously expressed member of the GRK family of serine/threonine kinases and has previously been characterized by its ability to phosphorylate and desensitize a vast array of heptahelical receptors (12Freedman N.J. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar). As an allosteric enzyme, GRK2 is activated by agonist-occupied receptors (12Freedman N.J. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar). GRK2 phosphorylates the PDGFRβ in an agonist-dependent manner (10Freedman N.J. Kim L.K. Murray J.P. Exum S.T. Brian L. Wu J.H.

Moreover, GRK2-mediated PDGFRβ seryl phosphorylation reduces the activation of the PDGFRβ itself, as assessed by receptor tyrosyl phosphorylation (10Freedman N.J. Kim L.K. Murray J.P. Exum S.T.

In contrast, GRK2 overexpression does not desensitize the EGFR, even though GRK2 phosphorylates EGFR serine(s) in purified protein and cellular overexpression systems (10Freedman N.J. Kim L.K.

To discern the mechanisms by which GRK2-mediated RPTK phosphorylation could desensitize the PDGFRβ but not the EGFR, we have focused this investigation on the interaction between the PDGFRβ and the Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor (NHERF), a PDZ domain-containing protein known to bind to the PDGFRβ, but not the EGFR, via the C-terminal tetrapeptide Asp-Ser1104-Phe-Leu of the receptor (15Maudsley S.

The association of the PDGFRβ with NHERF (also known as EBP50) has been shown to potentiate PDGFRβ dimerization and signaling (15Maudsley S. Zamah A.M. Rahman N. Blitzer J.T. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Hall R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8352-8363Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). NHERF also binds to the C-terminal tetrapeptide Asp-Ser411-Leu-Leu of the β2-adrenergic receptor, in an agonist-dependent manner (16Hall R.A. Premont R.T. Chow C.W. Blitzer J.T. Pitcher J.A.

Association between NHERF and the β2-adrenergic receptor affects receptor-mediated regulation of Na+/H+ exchange (16Hall R.A. Premont R.T. Chow C.W. Blitzer J.T. Pitcher J.A. Claing A. Stoffel R.H.

Reczek D. Bretscher A. von Zastrow M. Nature. 1999; 401: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). This β2-adrenergic receptor/NHERF association appears to be disrupted by GRK5-mediated phosphorylation of the β2-adrenergic receptor on Ser411 (17Cao T.T. Deacon H.W. Reczek D. Bretscher A. von Zastrow M. Nature. 1999; 401: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar) (a site not phosphorylated by GRK2 (18Fredericks Z.L. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13796-13803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar)). By analogy with the action of GRK5 on the β2-adrenergic receptor, we hypothesized that GRK2 could phosphorylate the PDGFRβ on Ser1104 and thereby decrease the affinity of NHERF/PDGFRβ interaction, diminish PDGFRβ dimerization and activation, and reduce downstream signaling. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effect of GRK2-mediated PDGFRβ phosphorylation on NHERF/PDGFRβ association. In addition, to determine whether GRK2-mediated PDGFRβ phosphorylation and desensitization occur in physiologic systems, we examined PDGFRβ regulation in MEFs derived from GRK2–/– and cognate WT mice. Plasmid Constructs—Plasmids encoding the N-terminal FLAG-tagged human PDGFRβ and bovine GRK2, each in pcDNA I (Invitrogen), have been described (10Freedman N.J. Kim L.K. Murray J.P. Exum S.T.

The bovine GRK2 cDNA was subcloned into pcDNA 3.1/hygro (Invitrogen) by using HindIII sites that flanked the insert (19Freedman N.J. Liggett S.B. Drachman D.E. Pei G. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J.

To create S1104D and S1104A mutations in the PDGFRβ, we employed cassette PCR with the following mutagenic primers: 5′-gggcgcgcggccgcctacaggaagtcatcctctgcttccgcccgaggcgc-3′ (S1104D) and 5′-gggcgcgcggccgcctacaggaaggcatcctctgcttccgcccgaggcgc-3′ (S1104A) (the underscore indicates the mutation to Asp or to Ala, italics indicate the 3′ NotI site, and bold type denotes the stop codon). The 5′ (nonmutagenic) primer comprised nucleotides 3061–3080 of the native PDGFRβ sequence. After PCR, a BstEII/NotI fragment was subcloned into the FLAG-tagged PDGFRβ construct, and the fidelity of mutagenesis was confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. Cell Culture—MEFs were derived from embryonic day 10 embryos by the explant outgrowth and 3T3 approaches (20Wu J.H. Peppel K. Nelson C.D. Lin F.T. Kohout T.A. Miller W.E. Exum S.T. Freedman N.J. J.

All of the animal protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and complied with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. To increase the number of cell lines expressing physiologic levels of GRK2 and the number of GRK2+/+ MEF lines available for genetically valid comparisons, we stably transfected our two GKR2–/– MEF lines with the GRK2/pcDNA3.1/hygro plasmid (using LipofectAMINE 2000; Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The colonies were selected in medium A containing hygromycin at 250 μg/ml. HEK 293 cells were propagated and transfected as previously reported (10Freedman N.J. Kim L.K. Murray J.P. Exum S.T.

For each transfection, cell surface PDGFRβ expression was measured by immunofluorescence and flow cytometry, as described (22Freedman N.J. Ament A.S. Oppermann M. Stoffel R.H. Exum S.T.

Co-transfected and mutant PDGFRβ cell lines were used only when cell surface PDGFRβ density was within 30% of that measured in control cells. GRK2 overexpression levels ranged from 20- to 40-fold over endogenous levels, assessed by immunoblotting serially diluted specimens, and was equivalent for all GRK2-overexpressing cells used within a single experiment. Phosphoinositide Hydrolysis—MEFs were labeled in medium B (medium A without fetal bovine serum and with 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin) with [3H]myoinositol (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 18 h, as described (13Peppel K.

HEK 293 cells were also challenged with the indicated stimuli for 15 min (37°); they were metabolically labeled in medium C (minimal essential medium, 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, penicillin/streptomycin, 1% (v/v) nonessential amino acids, and 1% pyruvate; Invitrogen) and assayed as described (13Peppel K.

To confirm antibody specificity for endogenous proteins, parallel blots were performed with nonimmune IgG of species and isotype identical to that used for identifying proteins of interest. For sequential immunoblots, anti-PDGFRβ IgG was always used before anti-phosphoserine or antiphosphotyrosine IgG, because the latter two IgGs failed to desorb from PDGFRβ bands (data not shown). To quantitate PDGFRβ tyrosyl and seryl phosphorylation, we performed densitometry on chemiluminescence-exposed BioMax MR™ film (Kodak). Anti-phosphotyrosine- or anti-phosphoserine-scored PDGFRβ band densities were normalized to cognate PDGFRβ band densities. (Because phosphotyrosine and phosphoserine signals were negligible in the absence of agonist, only PDGFRβ bands from PDGF-stimulated cells were used for comparisons among cell lines.) To quantitate NHERF/PDGFRβ co-IP, NHERF band densities from co-immunoprecipitations were normalized to cognate PDGFRβ band densities. Phospho-Akt and phospho-ERK1/2 band densities were normalized to cognate actin band densities. Statistical Analyses—Independent means were compared with unpaired t tests, and one-way analysis of variance (with Tukey's post-hoc test for multiple comparisons) was used for comparisons among more than two groups, with Prism 2 software (GraphPad, Inc.). The data are presented as the means ± S.D. in the text and as the means ± S.E. in the figures. Phosphorylation and Desensitization of the PDGFRβ by Physiologic Levels of GRK2—Although we have found that GRK2 phosphorylates and desensitizes the PDGFRβ both in cellular overexpression and in purified protein systems, we have yet to determine whether physiologically expressed GRK2 regulates the PDGFRβ. To address this question, we began by comparing endogenous PDGFRβ signaling in GRK2–/– MEFs with that in cognate WT MEFs. Physiologic expression of GRK2 in WT MEFs reduced PDGFRβ-evoked phosphoinositide hydrolysis by 2.3-fold, compared with that observed in GRK2–/– MEFs (Fig. 1A). This effect of GRK2 was receptor-specific, because physiologic GRK2 expression had no effect on phosphoinositide hydrolysis elicited in these cells through the protease-activated receptor-1 (thrombin receptor) (Fig. 1A), which we have previously shown is a relatively poor GRK2 substrate (25Ishii K. Chen J. Ishii M. Koch W.J. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1125-1130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether random genetic variation could be confounding our comparisons among WT and GRK2–/– MEF lines, we phenotypically characterized each cell line by immunoblotting cell extracts for key proteins in the PDGFRβ-evoked phosphoinositide hydrolysis signaling pathway (Fig. 1B). Although distinctly different with regard to GRK2 expression, both of the WT and both of the GRK2–/– cell lines expressed comparable (or functionally equivalent) levels of PDGFRβ, PLCγ-1, and NHERF. Thus, our inferences about the role of GRK2 on PDGFRβ signaling were facilitated. To minimize the effect of undetected genetic drift on our comparisons among GRK2–/– and WT MEFs, we used our two GRK2–/– MEF lines to create MEF clones stably transfected to express either GRK2 (n = 4) or no protein (GRK20 cells, n = 4). We selected GRK2-transfected clones that expressed GRK2 at levels comparable with those observed in WT MEFs (Fig. 2A). In addition, clones were selected on the basis of expressing comparable levels of proteins that could affect PDGFRβ signaling, including the PDGFRβ itself, PLCγ-1, GRK5, GRK6, and NHERF (Fig. 2A). In results averaged from these four GRK2-expressing and 4 GRK20 clones, physiologic levels of GRK2 expression reduced PDGFRβ-evoked phosphoinositide hydrolysis by 38% (p < 0.01) but had no effect on phosphoinositide hydrolysis evoked through direct activation of heterotrimeric G proteins (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, physiologic levels of GRK2 expression reduced Akt activation evoked by PDGF (by 38 ± 12% (p < 0.05)) but not by epidermal growth factor (Fig. 3A). Thus, GRK2-mediated desensitization of the PDGFRβ was receptor-specific, as it was in the comparison of WT with GRK2–/– MEFs (Fig. 1). In addition, PDGFRβ desensitization by physiologic levels of GRK2 was also signal pathway-specific, as we have observed previously in GRK2 overexpression systems (14Peppel K. Zhang L. Huynh T.T. Huang X. Jacobson A. Brian L. Exum S.T. Hagen P.O. Freedman N.J. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2002; 34: 1399-1409Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas PDGFRβ signaling through PLCγ and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase was attenuated by GRK2 (Figs. 2B and 3A, respectively), signaling through Grb2/Sos1/Ras to ERK1/2 was not (data not shown). Lastly, physiologic levels of GRK2 expression reduced activation of the PDGFRβ itself. Tyrosyl phosphorylation of the PDGFRβ was 25 ± 5% less in GRK2-expressing cells than in GRK20 cells (p < 0.05; Fig. 3B). Thus, by comparing cells expressing physiologic GRK2 levels with cells expressing no GRK2, we found GRK2-mediated PDGFRβ desensitization to be remarkably similar to that observed by comparing GRK2-overexpressing with endogenous GRK2-expressing cells (10Freedman N.J.

In this regard, GRK2-mediated PDGFRβ desensitization paralleled GRK2-mediated heptahelical receptor desensitization. To determine whether GRK2 phosphorylates the PDGFRβ on serine(s) when GRK2 is expressed at physiologic levels, we examined PDGF-induced PDGFRβ seryl phosphorylation in GRK2-expressing and GRK20 MEFs (Fig. 4). Within 10 min of PDGFRβ activation, seryl phosphorylation of the PDGFRβ was 2.5 ± 0.6-fold greater in MEFs expressing physiologic GRK2 levels than it was in GRK20 MEFs (Fig. 4; p < 0.05). Thus, GRK2 serine-phosphorylated the PDGFRβ in cells expressing physiologic levels of both proteins, in a manner that correlated temporally with GRK2-mediated PDGFRβ desensitization. Moreover, the magnitude of PDGFRβ seryl phosphorylation in GRK2-expresssing and -null fibroblasts suggested that GRK2 mediates the majority of agonist-dependent PDGFRβ seryl phosphorylation in these cells. GRK2-mediated PDGFRβ Phosphorylation Attenuates NHERF/PDGFRβ Association—Could GRK2 phosphorylate the PDGFRβ on serine 1104 and thereby diminish the affinity of PDGFRβ/NHERF association? If so, such a mechanism could help to explain why GRK2-mediated phosphorylation reduces tyrosyl phosphorylation of the PDGFRβ but not the EGFR (10Freedman N.J. Kim L.K. Murray J.P. Exum S.T. Brian L.

Although the PDGFRβ is cross-linked by NHERF, the EGFR is not (15Maudsley S. Zamah A.M. Rahman N. Blitzer J.T. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Hall R.A. Mol. Cell.

https://openalex.org/W2072955418,"The serotonin transporter (SERT) belongs to a family of sodium chloride-dependent transporters responsible for uptake of amino acids and biogenic amines from extracellular spaces. SERT represents the main pharmacological target in the treatment of several clinical conditions, including depression and anxiety. Serotonin-selective reuptake inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants are the most predominantly prescribed drugs in the treatment of depression. In addition to antidepressants also psychostimulants, like cocaine and amphetamines, are important SERT antagonists. In the present study, we report the cloning and characterization of chicken SERT. Although the uptake kinetic was very similar to human SERT, the pharmacological profiles differed considerably for the two species. We find that chicken SERT is capable of discriminating between different serotonin-selective reuptake inhibitors; thus, the potency of S-citalopram and paroxetine is reduced more than 40-fold. A cross-species chimera strategy was undertaken and followed by species-scanning mutagenesis. Differences in pharmacological profiles were tracked to amino acid residues 169, 172, and 586 in human SERT. Structure-activity studies on structurally related compounds indicated that species divergences in drug sensitivity between human and chicken SERT were arising from differences in coordination or recognition of an important aminomethyl pharmacophoric substructure, which is shared by all high affinity antidepressants. Consequently, we suggest that Ala169 and Ile172 of human SERT are important residues in sensing the N-methylation state of SERT antagonists.

Serotonergic neurotransmission is modulated by active reuptake of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine or 5-HT) 1The abbreviations used are: 5-HT, serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine); SERT, serotonin transporter; hSERT, human SERT; gSERT, chicken SERT; TM, transmembrane; SSRI, serotonin-selective reuptake inhibitors; MDMA, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine; DASB, 3-amino-4-(2-dimethylaminomethyl-phenylsulfanyl)-benzonitrile; IDAM, [2-(2-dimethylaminomethyl-phenylsulfanyl)-5-iodo-phenyl]-methanol; WT, wild type. from the extracellular space. Reuptake is mediated by the serotonin transporter (SERT), and 5-HT is subsequently either degraded by monoamine oxidases or repackaged into vesicles by the proton-dependent vesicular monoamine transporter. A balance between release and active reuptake of 5-HT determines the magnitude and duration of signaling and thus plays a key role in the spatio-temporal fine tuning of serotonergic neurotransmission. Malfunction in active 5-HT reuptake is speculated to be associated with psychiatric disorders, particularly anxiety and depression (1Fuller R.W. Wong D.T. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1990; 600: 68-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 2Owens M.J. Nemeroff C.B. Clin. Chem. 1994; 40: 288-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). Antidepressants inhibiting 5-HT reuptake are used also in treatment of anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorders, and eating disorders (3Gorman J.M. Korotzer A. Su G. MedWorks Reprint Ser. 2002; 7: 40-44Google Scholar, 4Feighner J.P. J. Clin. Psychiatry. 1999; 60: 18-22PubMed Google Scholar). SERT is a member of a large family of homologous integral membrane proteins (5Nelson N. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1785-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). SERT is of considerable interest as a molecular target for many antidepressants, including the tricyclic antidepressants such as imipramine and amitriptyline, as well as the serotonin-selective reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) like citalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, and fluvoxamine. SERT is also target for drugs of abuse including cocaine and amphetamines such as 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or “ecstasy”) (6Tatsumi M. Groshan K. Blakely R.D. Richelson E. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 340: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar, 7White F.J. Nature. 1998; 393: 118-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). SERT is a putative 12-transmembrane (TM) domain protein that co-transports one 5-HT molecule inwardly, in a protonated form, together with one Na+ ion and one Cl- ion. An internal K+ ion is bound and countertransported, after dissociation of 5-HT, Na+, and Cl-, as SERT returns to its initial state (8Rudnick G. Clark J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1144: 249-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Although the stoichiometry of 5-HT transport predicts an electroneutral process, electrophysiological studies have revealed a net inward current, which probably arises from an uncoupled excess inward flux of Na+ ions (9Mager S.

Blakely R.D. DeFelice L.J. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 3401-3411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of SERT is unknown; however, in the quaternary structure SERT was reported to form homo-oligomeric complexes. This was supported by fluorescence resonance energy transfer interactions, chemical cross-linking, and co-immunoprecipitation of epitope-tagged SERT (11Schmid J.A. Just H. Sitte H.H. Biochem. Soc.

Although the cloning of SERT cDNAs from several different species and their expression in heterologous systems has intensified characterization of recombinant SERT, the molecular mechanisms underlying transport and how it is inhibited are still not well understood (14Chen J.X.

Interspecies differences in pharmacological profiles, combined with construction of cross-species chimeras and site-directed mutagenesis, have been used as a rational strategy to localize domains and residues critical for ligand interaction. Studies using this strategy identified Phe586 in TM12 to be important in high affinity recognition of tricyclic antidepressants (27Barker E.L. Kimmel H.L. Blakely R.D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 799-807PubMed Google Scholar, 28Barker E.L. Blakely R.D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 957-965PubMed Google Scholar), and in a similar study an important determinant of species-selective recognition of mazindol and citalopram was tracked to Tyr95 in TM1 (29Barker E.L. Perlman M.A. Adkins E.M. Houlihan W.J. Pristupa Z.B. Niznik H.B. Blakely R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19459-19468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In one of our own species-scanning mutagenesis studies, we identified Met180 in TM3 and Tyr495 and Phe513, both in TM10, as important molecular determinants of antidepressant interactions (30Mortensen O.V. Kristensen A.S. Wiborg O. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 237-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis studies have indicated that the conserved aspartate in TM1 of the monoamine transporters, Asp98 in human SERT (hSERT), and the conserved serine in TM11, Ser545 in hSERT, are both essential to transport activity, antagonist potency, and ion dependence (31Sur C. Betz H. Schloss P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7639-7644Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 32Barker E.L. Moore K.R. Rakhshan F. Blakely R.D. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4705-4717Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The important role of TM1 was supported by the suggestion of G100 as a structural pivot providing flexibility during substrate translocation (33Kristensen A.S. Larsen M.B. Johnsen L.B. Wiborg O. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2004; 19: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In TM7, several residues are important for uptake and Na+ dependence, indicating that TM7 is involved in binding pocket formation or substrate translocation (34Kamdar G. Penado K.M. Rudnick G. Stephan M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4038-4045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). A cysteine scanning of residues in TM3 indicated that Ile172 and Tyr176 are associated with a 5-HT and cocaine binding pocket (35Chen J.G. Sachpatzidis A. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28321-28327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). A detailed mapping of residues defining the binding sites is, however, still incomplete, and details on transport dynamics and conformational changes during uptake are essentially unknown. In the present study, we report the cloning of chicken SERT (gSERT). Although the amino acid sequence is highly conserved, the pharmacological characterization of a number of selected compounds revealed a profile very different from hSERT. Consequently, a species-scanning mutagenesis strategy was undertaken in order to identify residues that are important for differential binding of SSRIs.

Cloning of gSERT cDNA—Total RNA was isolated from chicken brain tissue using the acid guanidinium thiocyanate method by Chomczynski and Sacchi (36Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). Single-stranded cDNA was synthesized from 5 μg of total RNA using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and the gSERT gene-specific primer KR5 (CGTTGAATTGCTTGGATAG) at 42 °C for 50 min. Complementary RNA was removed with RNase H. Full-length cDNA was cloned by PCR using primers KF1 with an integrated XhoI restriction site (CCGCTCGAGGGCAGGAGAAACCTTGGAA) and KR3 with an integrated XbaI restriction site (CTAGTCTAGACCAAATGTCCGTTGTCAGTG) located in the 5′- and 3′-untranslated region, respectively. The proofreading polymerase PFU Turbo (Stratagene) was used with the following touchdown PCR parameters: 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 61 °C, 150 s at 72 °C for 25 cycles where the annealing temperature was decreased 0.4 °C for every cycle followed by 35 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 51 °C, and 150 s at 72 °C. The resulting fragment was 2200 bp, which was the expected size based on the information from the chicken expressed sequence tags and the hSERT. The fragment was digested with XhoI and XbaI and inserted into the eucaryotic expression vector pcDNA 3 (Invitrogen) cleaved with the same enzymes. The PCR amplification was repeated in an independent experiment, and a total of eight clones were sequenced in their entirety to identify possible PCR-generated artifacts. Sequencing was performed using BigDye Terminator version 3.1 and an automated ABI 3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). The final clone contained 21 bp of 5′-untranslated region, the entire coding sequence, and 128 bp of 3′-untranslated region. Construction of SERT Chimeras and Mutants—A PCR-based approach was chosen to generate rationally designed cross-species chimeras between hSERT and gSERT based on the method by Kirsch and Joly (37Kirsch R.D. Joly E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1848-1850Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The coding region of hSERT was previously cloned from human placenta and inserted into the pcDNA3 vector, denoted hSERT (33Kristensen A.S. Larsen M.B. Johnsen L.B. Wiborg O. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2004; 19: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Briefly, a region of the hSERT was amplified by PCR using primers complementary to hSERT in the 3′-end and complementary to gSERT in the 5′-end. The resulting fragment was gel-purified and subsequently used as a pair of complementary megaprimers following the QuikChange protocol (Stratagene). All chimeras were sequenced in their entirety to verify sequence switching points and exclude PCR-generated errors.

The following double and triple mutations were introduced in gSERT and hSERT: gSERT D209A/V212I, gSERT D209A/L210F, gSERT L210F/V212I, gSERT V223A/F224L, gSERT D209A/L210F/V212I, gSERT D209A/V212I/I626F, and hSERT A169D/I172V/F586I. All mutations were created using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The entire coding region was sequenced in all mutants. Cell Culture and Expression of SERTs in COS-1 Cells—COS-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. For transfections, 0.2 μg of plasmid and 0.4 μl of Fugene6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used per cm2 of plating area. Appropriate amounts of plasmid and Fugene6 were mixed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium according to the manufacturer's recommendations. COS-1 cells were trypsinized and suspended in growth media, and the plasmid/Fugene6 mixture was added followed by dispension into growth plates at 70-80% confluence. White 96-well plates (Corning) were used for uptake experiments. 5-HT Uptake Assays—Uptake assays were performed 40-64 h after transfection. The medium was removed, and the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4, 1.4 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4) containing 0.1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2 (PBSCM). Following washing, cells were incubated at room temperature for 10 min in PBSCM containing 12 (in duplicate) or eight (in triplicate) increasing concentrations of [3H]5-HT diluted 30 times with unlabeled 5-HT for Km and Vmax determinations. Washing with PBSCM terminated the uptake. For IC50 determinations, following the initial washing step, cells were incubated for 30 min with 12 increasing concentrations of drug (in duplicate) to reach equilibrium. Substrates were not preincubated with the cells. Uptake was then initiated by the addition of a solution of [3H]5-HT containing the appropriate drug to give a final [3H]5-HT concentration of 100 nm. The uptake was allowed to continue for 10 min at room temperature and terminated by washing with PBSCM. All washing steps were carried out using an automated plate washer. Following uptake, cells were solubilized in scintillant (MicroScint-20; PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and plates were counted in a Packard TopCounter NXT microplate scintillation counter. Specific uptake was determined as the difference between uptake counts from cells transfected with SERT-containing constructs and mock-transfected cells. Assuming Michaelis-Menten kinetics, the data were plotted and analyzed by nonlinear least-squares curve fit (GraphPad Prism). IC50 values were calculated by nonlinear regression analysis of inhibition of normalized 5-HT uptake versus logarithmic drug concentration (GraphPad Prism). Ki values were calculated from the IC50 values using the Cheng and Prusoff equation (38Cheng Y.C. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12330) Google Scholar) to adjust for substrate concentration. 95% confidence intervals for Ki values were calculated (Graphpad Prism). Ki values were compared using an unpaired t test (Graphpad Prism). RTI-55 Binding Assays—COS-1 cells were transfected as described. Cells were grown for 64 h, and prior to harvesting, dishes were rinsed in PBS. Cells were harvested with a cell scraper in buffer 1 (50 mm Tris-base, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm EDTA, pH 7.4). After centrifugation, cells were suspended and homogenized with an Ultra-turrax homogenizer for 20 s in buffer 1. Membranes were pelleted by ultracentrifugation, and homogenization was repeated. Finally, after ultracentrifugation, membranes were suspended in buffer 3 (50 mm Tris-base, 120 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, pH 7.4) and stored at -80 °C. Membrane protein concentration was determined by the BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce). For IC50 determinations, 2 μg of membrane in buffer 3 was added to each well in a 96-well plate and combined with buffer 3 containing increasing concentrations of the desired drug and a final concentration of 200 pm [125I]RTI-55 (β-carbomethoxy-3β-(4-iodophenyl)tropane) as radioligand. Membranes were incubated for 60 min at room temperature and subsequently washed six times with water after transferring to a 96-well glass fiber filter plate GF/B (Unifilter; Packard Bell) preincubated with 50 μl of 0.5% polyethyleneimine, using a Packard Bell cell harvester. Filters were soaked with 40 μl of MicroScint 20 scintillation liquid (Packard Bell), and accumulated radioactivity per filter was determined by direct counting of plates using a Packard Bell microplate scintillation counter. IC50 values were calculated as described for uptake inhibition. To calculate Ki values from IC50 values using the Cheng and Prusoff equation, KD values for [125I]RTI-55 was measured using 2 μg of membrane in buffer 3 and 12 increasing concentrations of [125I]RTI-55 followed by incubation and washing as described above. Cloning of a Chicken 5-HT Transporter—Initial 5-HT uptake inhibition experiments using synaptosomes prepared from chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) brain indicated that the pharmacological properties of this transporter differed from the human counterpart. To study the molecular mechanisms underlying these differences in a cultured cell model, we cloned the gSERT. We used the hSERT cDNA sequence to search GenBank™ for possible chicken sequences encoding SERT. This search revealed several homologous chicken expressed sequence tag fragments, some of which contained apparent 5′-and 3′-nontranslated regions. We used the nontranslated sequences to design sequence-specific primers for reverse transcription and PCR. Using RNA extracted from chicken brain tissue as a template, we cloned gSERT into the mammalian expression vector, pcDNA3. We sequenced eight independent full-length cDNA clones from which we constructed a consensus sequence (GenBank™ accession number AY573844). The consensus sequence revealed an open reading frame of 2010 bp, which translates into a 670-amino acid protein. gSERT shows a high degree of similarity to the hSERT with an overall identity of 77% (Fig. 1). The main difference between the SERT from the two species is observed in the predicted intracellular N terminus of the protein, which is 40 amino acids longer for gSERT compared with hSERT. Hydropathy analysis with TMHMM (available on the World Wide Web at www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM) predicts 12 transmembrane domains with intracellular N and C termini as described for other transporters of this family. Two potential N-glycosylation sites are present in the large second extracellular loop at Asn248 and Asn257, corresponding to the sites previously identified in rat SERT (rSERT) and human norepinephrine transporter (39Tate C.G.

Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 266-276PubMed Google Scholar). Two cysteine residues, which form a potential disulfide bridge in the rSERT, are also conserved in gSERT (Cys240 and Cys249). Protein kinase C-dependent phosphorylation of hSERT is prevented by transporter substrates, whereas cocaine and antidepressants permit phosphorylation and subsequent internalization of hSERT (41Ramamoorthy S. Blakely R.D. Science. 1999; 285: 763-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). To assess the possibility that gSERT can be phosphorylated, we used the neural network-based NetPhos 2.0 phosphorylation site prediction tool (available on the World Wide Web at www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetPhos/) to analyze the gSERT amino acid sequence for potential phosphorylation sites. NetPhos predicted that gSERT contains 26 potential phosphorylation sites (nine serines, 12 threonines, and five tyrosines), 16 of which are located in putative intracellular domains of the transporter. Of these, six serines (Ser7, Ser15, Ser20, Ser40, Ser102, and Ser123) and six threonines (Thr6, Thr14, Thr95, Thr99, Thr103, and Thr121) are located in the putative N-terminal tail. One serine (Ser499), one threonine (Thr316), and one tyrosine (Tyr398) are located in putative intracellular loops, and one threonine (Thr643) is located in the putative C-terminal tail of the gSERT. 5-HT Uptake and Pharmacology of gSERT Compared with hSERT—When transiently transfected in COS-1 cells, the cloned gSERT displayed robust and saturable 5-HT uptake, with an apparent affinity constant, Km, of 846 ± 90 nm, which is comparable with values obtained for hSERT (Table II and Fig. 2). Vmax values varied with transfection efficiencies, but in individual experiments, gSERT gave rise to slightly higher uptake than hSERT as demonstrated by the example in Fig. 2.Table IIUptake properties of the cloned gSERT and hSERTTransporterKmVmaxμmpmol 5-HT/well/minhSERT0.77 ± 0.080.33 ± 0.05gSERT0.85 ± 0.090.43 ± 0.05 Open table in a new tab The pharmacological profiles of gSERT and hSERT in inhibition studies on 5-HT uptake and RTI-55 binding were established and compared, using transiently transfected COS-1 cells or cell membranes prepared from transfected COS-1 cells.

There are at least four distinctly regulated subgroups of MAPKs: extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2), c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1/2/3, p38 proteins (p38 α/β/γ/δ), and ERK5 (1Sturgill T.W.

Mathison J.C. Ulevitch R.J. Tobias P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8172-8175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was also cloned as a specific target of pyridinyl imidazoles such as SB203580, which were known to inhibit biosynthesis of proinflammatory cytokines in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated monocytes (5Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.J. Heys J.R. Landvatter S.W. Strickler J.E. McLaughlin M.M. Siemens I.R. Fisher S.M. Livi G.P. White J.R. Adams J.L. Young P.R. Nature. 1994; 372: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (3138) Google Scholar). SB203580 is a highly selective inhibitor of p38 with no effect on ERK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and many other protein kinases (6Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3944) Google Scholar). p38 is rapidly activated by diverse stresses (hyperosmolarity, UV light, heat shock, arsenite, and anisomycin) as well as by endotoxins and cytokines (interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor). Activated p38 phosphorylates and regulates downstream protein kinases and certain transcription factors (7Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 807-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (2883) Google Scholar). Multiple p38-dependent inflammatory responses are mediated by a serine/threonine kinase, MAPK-activated protein kinase 2 (MAPKAPK2) (8Zu Y.L. Ai Y. Gilchrist A. Labadia M.E. Sha'afi R.I. Huang C.K.

Previous studies also showed the involvement of p38 MAPK signaling pathways in several apoptotic regulations. Undevia et al. reported a proapoptotic signaling pathway involving p38 MAPK, which is elicited by transforming growth factor-β 1 (11Undevia N.S. Dorscheid D.R. Marroquin B.A. Gugliotta W.L. Tse R.

Several targets for MAPKAPK2 phosphorylation were identified: heat shock protein 27 (Hsp27), tristetraprolin, leukocyte-specific protein 1, 5-lipooxygenase, p16-Arc, and Tuberin (13Nahas N.

However, to figure out completely the signal transduction pathways controlled by p38 MAPK-mediated functional responses, comprehensive identification of both p38 and MAP-KAPK2 substrates and subsequent elucidation of their biological functions are required. Recently, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis has been applied to analyze intracellular signaling events. However, due to insufficient resolution power, the dense spots of components for cytoskeleton or housekeeping metabolic enzymes have frequently obscured low abundance proteins such as factors involved in signal transduction. To overcome this problem, prefractionation of proteins is highly desirable. Prefractionation includes purification of organelles, fractionation of proteins according to their isoelectric points (pIs), isolation of specific protein complexes, purification of glycoproteins by lectins, conventional chromatography, and so on. Another prefractionation procedure, phosphoprotein purification, is suitable for the identification of substrates of a kinase of interest, since it enriches phosphorylated substrates while reducing the number of protein species, which greatly facilitates protein identification. In this study, we combined three key methodologies, enrichment of phosphorylated proteins, fluorescent two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE), and mass spectrometric identification of proteins, to globally identify the factors involved in the p38 MAPK cascades. We have identified Bcl2-associated athanogene 2 (BAG2) protein, splicing factor, and Ran-binding protein as candidates for targets of p38 MAPK-dependent phosphorylation in response to anisomycin treatment in HeLa cells. Furthermore, we provided definite evidence that MAPKAPK2 phosphorylates BAG2 at Ser20in vitro and in vivo. These results demonstrate that BAG2 is a novel component of the p38 MAPK signaling pathways. Cell Lines and Materials—HeLa and 293 cells were purchased from the ATCC (Manassas, VA). Both cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Transfections were performed using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Protein kinase inhibitors U0126, SP600125, and SB203580 were purchased from Calbiochem. Construction of Plasmids—The following plasmids were prepared. For pEF-BOS/HA-BAG2, the DNA fragment coding N-terminal HA-tagged human BAG2 was amplified with PCR using primers (5′-CATGGTACCCAGACCGTGCATCATGTACCCATACGACGTCCCAGACTACGCTGCTCAGGCGAAGATCAACGCT-3′ and 5′-CATGGATCCCTAATTGAATCTGCTTTCAGCATTT-3′) and cloned into pEF-BOS vector (19Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1502) Google Scholar). For pEF-BOS/HA-BAG2-S20A, Ser20 of BAG2 on pEF-BOS/HA-BAG2 was mutated to alanine with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's instructions using complementary primers (5′-GCCGCTCCTCCGCCATGGCTGACCG-3′ and 5′-CGGTCAGCCATGGCGGAGGAGCGGC-3′). For pGEX-3-X/BAG2 and pGEX-3X/BAG2-S20A, two DNA fragments were amplified from pEF-BOS/HA-BAG2 or pEF-BOS/HA-BAG2-S20A vector, respectively, using primers (5′-CATGGATCCCCGCTCAGGCGAAGATCAACGCTA-3′ and 5′-CATGAATTCCTAATTGAATCTGCTTTCAGCATTT-3′). The fragments were directly cloned into pGEX-3X vector (Amersham Biosciences). For pGEX-4T-1/Hsp27, the DNA fragment coding human Hsp27 was amplified with PCR using primers (5′-CATGGATCCACCGAGCGCCGCGTCCCCTTCT-3′ and 5′-CATCTCGAGTTACTTGGCGGCAGTCTCATC-3′) and cloned into pGEX-4T-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences). Identification of Signaling Mediators of the p38 MAPK Cascade— Total cell lysates were prepared from HeLa cells cultured in the normal condition and cells precultured in the presence or absence of 10 μm SB203580 for 50 min followed by treatment with 1 μg/ml anisomycin for 15 min. To enrich phosphorylated proteins, each extract was subjected to a phosphoprotein purification kit (Qiagen), and protein concentration was determined according to Bradford (20Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216377) Google Scholar). Then 2D-DIGE was carried out as follows. Three purified samples (50 μg each) were labeled with Cy2, Cy3, and Cy5 minimal dyes (Amersham Biosciences), respectively, following the manufacturer's instructions. Labeled samples were combined and passively rehydrated into a 24-cm pH 4–7 immobilized pH gradient strips (Amersham Biosciences) for 12 h and subjected to isoelectric focusing using the Ettan IPGphor isoelectric focusing system (Amersham Biosciences) for a total of 61,500 V-h (hold at 500 V for 500 V-h, hold at 1 kV for 1 kV-h, and hold at 8 kV for 60 kV-h). Reduction and carbamidomethylation of cysteine sulfhydryls were carried out as recommended by the manufacturer. The second-dimensional SDS-PAGE was carried out with Ettan DALTtwelve (Amersham Biosciences). The Cy2, Cy3, and Cy5 signals were individually imaged with mutually exclusive excitation/emission wavelengths of 480/530, 520/590, and 620/680 nm, respectively, using Typhoon 9400 (Amersham Biosciences). DeCyder software (Amersham Biosciences) was used for pairwise comparisons of Cy2 and Cy3, Cy2 and Cy5, or Cy3 and Cy5 images and for quantitative determination of intensity changes of all spots among three combinations. Determination of Proteins of Interest Using 2D-DIGE and Mass Spectrometry—Phosphoprotein-enriched sample prepared as above from anisomycin-treated cells (650 μg, nonlabeled) was subjected to second dimension gel, transferred to ProBlott membranes (Applied Biosystems), and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Proteins of interest were excised, equilibrated with a reduction buffer (0.5 m Tris, pH 8.5, 8 m guanidine hydrochloride, 0.3% EDTA, 5% acetonitrile), and digested with 1 pmol of lysylendopeptidase (Wako) in 6 μl of digestion buffer (18 mm Tris, pH 8.9, 70% acetonitrile) for 90 min at 37 °C. Acetonitrile was added to a final concentration of 90%, and the sample was desalted/concentrated using ZipTip HPL (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Peptides were eluted with 1 μl of matrix solution (0.1% acetic acid, 50% acetonitrile saturated with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid) and applied onto a sample plate (Applied Biosystems). Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry was performed using a Voyager-DE PRO (PerSeptive Biosystems). Ions specific for each sample were then used to interrogate human protein sequences in the NCBInr data base using the MASCOT (available on the World Wide Web at www.matrixscience.com) data base search algorithms. In Vitro Kinase Assays—Phosphorylation of recombinant GST-BAG2 or GST-BAG2-S20A by MAPKAPK2 was examined by incubation of 20 ng of active-MAPKAPK2 (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY) or 1 unit of ERK2 (active MAPK; Calbiochem) with 1.0 μg each of GST-BAG2, GST-BAG2-S20A, or GST-Hsp27 and 0.5 μCi of [γ-32P] in 20 μl of a kinase buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm ATP) for 20 min at 30 °C. Reactions were terminated with Laemmli SDS sample buffer to a final volume of 30 μl, halves of samples were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE, and phosphorylation reactions were visualized by autoradiography. Construction and Transfection of siMAPKAPK2—A short interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting endogenous MAPKAPK2 was generated using BLOCK-iT Dicer RNAi kits (Invitrogen) following recommended protocols, except that the target sequence was amplified by PCR using primers (5′-CAAGAAGAACGCCATCATC-3′ and 5′-GAGGGTTGGATGCATCTT-3′). Purified siMAPKAPK2 (250 or 500 ng/well) was used for transfection into 293 cells cultured in 6-well plates. Two-dimensional Western Blotting and Antibodies—Proteins were rehydrated into 24-cm pH 4–7 immobilized pH gradient strips followed by isoelectric focusing, resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Immunoblotting was performed using the following antibodies: anti-phospho-MAPKAPK2 (Thr334), anti-phospho-HSP27 (Ser82), anti-phospho-c-Jun (Ser63), anti-phospho-p44/p42 MAPK (Thr202/Tyr204), and anti-MAPKAPK2 (Cell Signaling Technology); anti-actin (Chemicon International); and anti-HA High Affinity (3F10) (Roche Applied Science). Identification of Signaling Molecules in the p38 MAPK Cascade—To globally identify factors involved in the p38 MAPK cascade, we developed a system consisting of phosphoprotein purification, fluorescent 2D-DIGE, and mass spectrometric identification of proteins. We prepared three lysates of HeLa cells (control untreated cells and cells treated with anisomycin in the presence or absence of SB203580), in which p38 MAPK activity was suppressed or activated, respectively. The specificity of SB203580 inhibition of p38 MAPK pathways was also confirmed as shown later. Phosphoproteins were enriched by using a commercially available purification kit. We confirmed that phosphorylated forms of p38 MAPK, MAPKAPK2, and Hsp27 bound to the column and were eluted with relatively good recoveries from the column (data not shown). Phosphoprotein-enriched fractions from the three lysates were labeled with cyanine dyes Cy2, Cy3, and Cy5, respectively; combined; and run on the same gel. The Cy2 (control cells), Cy3 (anisomycin), and Cy5 (anisomycin + SB203580) signals were individually scanned at mutually exclusive excitation/emission wavelengths, which are exhibited as blue, red, and green pseudocolors (Fig. 1, A–C). Fig. 1D shows a merge of three images. There were a large number of red spots, the amount of which was higher in p38-activated cells than in the other two cells (88 and 101 spots exhibiting a 1.5-fold or higher increase among 2865 and 2891 spots in two separate experiments employing different cell lysates). Since phosphoproteins were enriched before the analysis, these spots were candidates for proteins phosphorylated in p38 signaling pathways. Most of the remaining spots were white as a merge of blue, red, and green, demonstrating their equal quantities among three samples. These spots may be the phosphoproteins unrelated to the p38 pathway or proteins non-specifically trapped by the column. Green spots were also observed, some of which were characterized as described below. Determination of Proteins Using 2D-DIGE and Peptide Mass Fingerprinting—Phosphoprotein-enriched sample derived from HeLa cells treated with anisomycin (650 μg, nonlabeled) was separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and stained with Coomassie Blue. The spots corresponding to those of a–f in Fig. 1E (magnified view of a boxed region in D) were excised and subjected to peptide mass fingerprinting as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The MALDI-TOF mass spectrum of one of these proteins is shown in Fig. 2. Using the MASCOT data base search algorithms, this protein was identified as human BAG2 (spot a). Other spots were Hsp27 (spots b–d), human splicing factor arginine/serine-rich 9 (spot e), and human Ran-binding protein (spot f). Since the activation of p38 by anisomycin caused Hsp27 phosphorylation at Ser15, Ser78, and Ser82 (21Landry J. Lambert H. Zhou M. Lavoie J.N. Hickey E. Weber L.A. Anderson C.W. J. Biol.

Ran-binding protein (spot f) exhibited a green spot suggesting a phosphorylation by a SB203580-sensitive pathway. The peptide coverages of the proteins and scores in the MASCOT analyses are shown in Table I. The ratios of signal intensities of these spots between three sample combinations by using images shown in Fig. 1 are also shown.Table ISummary of protein identifications of p38 MAPK signaling pathwaysSpotDescriptionCy3/Cy2aFluorescent intensity ratios Cy3 (anisomycin)/Cy2 (nontreated), Cy5 (SB203580 + anisomycin)/Cy2 (nontreated), and Cy3 (anisomycin)/Cy5 (SB203580 + anisomycin) were calculated by DeCyder software using images in Fig. 1.Cy5/Cy2aFluorescent intensity ratios Cy3 (anisomycin)/Cy2 (nontreated), Cy5 (SB203580 + anisomycin)/Cy2 (nontreated), and Cy3 (anisomycin)/Cy5 (SB203580 + anisomycin) were calculated by DeCyder software using images in Fig. 1.Cy3/Cy5aFluorescent intensity ratios Cy3 (anisomycin)/Cy2 (nontreated), Cy5 (SB203580 + anisomycin)/Cy2 (nontreated), and Cy3 (anisomycin)/Cy5 (SB203580 + anisomycin) were calculated by DeCyder software using images in Fig. 1.Sequence coveragebSequence coverages of MALDI-TOF peptide mass fingerprint analyses are also shown.%aBcl2-associated athanogene 27.281.166.2835bHeat shock protein 270.350.940.3836cHeat shock protein 275.661.085.2436dHeat shock protein 2712.281.518.1336eSplicing factor, arginine/serine-rich 92.840.783.6429fRan-binding protein1.063.040.3526a Fluorescent intensity ratios Cy3 (anisomycin)/Cy2 (nontreated), Cy5 (SB203580 + anisomycin)/Cy2 (nontreated), and Cy3 (anisomycin)/Cy5 (SB203580 + anisomycin) were calculated by DeCyder software using images in Fig. 1.b Sequence coverages of MALDI-TOF peptide mass fingerprint analyses are also shown. Open table in a new tab BAG2 and splicing factor arginine/serine-rich 9 (spots a and e) were significantly up-regulated in a p38-dependent manner just as Hsp27, a known substrate phosphorylated in the p38-MAPKAPK2 pathway, on spots c and d, suggesting that BAG2 and splicing factor arginine/serine-rich 9 are novel factors involved in the p38-dependent phosphorylation cascades. In this study, we focused on BAG2 as a candidate of p38-signaling factor and characterized its phosphorylation in the following experiments. BAG2 Phosphorylation Is Specifically Controlled by p38 MAPK—To confirm that BAG2 was specifically phosphorylated by the p38 cascade in response to treatment of anisomycin, we used HeLa cells transiently overexpressed with N-terminal HA-tagged human BAG2. The transfected cells were treated with or without anisomycin in the presence or absence of specific protein kinase inhibitors. Consistent with previous reports, SB203580 inhibited the activation of MAPKAPK2 by p38 and thereby inhibited Hsp27 phosphorylation (23Kramer R.M. Roberts E.F. Um S.L. Borsch-Haubold A.G. Watson S.P. Fisher M.J. Jakubowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27723-27729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar), SP600125 inhibited phosphorylation of c-Jun (24Bennett B.L. Sasaki D.T. Murray B.W. O'Leary E.C. Sakata S.T. Xu W. Leisten J.C. Motiwala A. Pierce S. Satoh Y. Bhagwat S.S. Manning A.M. Anderson D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13681-13686Crossref PubMed Scopus (2228) Google Scholar), and U0126 inhibited the activation of ERK1/2 (25DeSilva D.R. Jones E.A. Favata M.F. Jaffee B.D. Magolda R.L. Trzaskos J.M. Scherle P.A. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 4175-4181PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A). These inhibitors did not affect the expression of HA-BAG2. These total lysates were used for second dimension immunoblot with anti-HA antibody (Fig. 3B). We detected four spots (indicated as arrows a–d) of HA-BAG2 in control HeLa cells. Treatment with anisomycin resulted in a remarkable increase in the two spots (c and d) with more acidic pI values and a corresponding decrease in the remaining two spots (a and b). These shifts in pI values were significantly inhibited by preincubation of cells with SB203580 but neither with SP600125 nor with U0126. These results suggested that BAG2 was specifically phosphorylated by p38 MAPK cascades in response to anisomycin treatment. BAG2-Ser20 Is Directly Phosphorylated by MAPKAPK2 in Vitro—To identify the phosphorylation site on BAG2 specifically phosphorylated in response to anisomycin, we scanned the whole peptide sequences of BAG2 of three distinct species (Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, and Danio rerio) for possible phosphorylation sites. Then we found a discriminative sequence in human BAG2 (residues 13–22) that completely matched with the consensus MAPKAPK2 phosphorylation site, Hyd-X-Arg-X-X-Ser, where Hyd is a bulky hydrophobic residue (Phe > Leu > Val ≫ Ala) and Ser is a phosphorylation site (26Stokoe D. Caudwell B. Cohen P.T. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 843-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig. 4 with a schematic domain structure of human BAG2, this sequence motif in human BAG2 is perfectly conserved among three species. We therefore constructed a vector plasmid expressing a mutant human BAG2 in which Ser20 was mutated to alanine to determine whether BAG2-Ser20 was directly phosphorylated by MAPKAPK2. Recombinant GST-BAG2, GST-BAG2-S20A, or GST-Hsp27 was incubated with recombinant MAPKAPK2 or ERK in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP in vitro. Fig. 5A shows that GST-BAG2-wt as well as GST-Hsp27 were strongly phosphorylated by MAPKAPK2 and that substitution of alanine for Ser20 completely abolished MAPKAPK2 phosphorylation of BAG2. In contrast, ERK did not phosphorylate GST-BAG2-wt at all. The kinase activity of ERK was confirmed strong phosphorylation of myelin basic protein (27Sette C. Barchi M. Bianchini A. Conti M. Rossi P. Geremia R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33571-33579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) (data not shown). The result demonstrates that MAPKAPK2 directly phosphorylates BAG2 at Ser20. BAG2-Ser20 Is Phosphorylated in Vivo in a p38-dependent Manner—To confirm that the phosphorylation of BAG2-Ser20 was the phosphorylation site in response to anisomycin in vivo, two-dimensional immunoblot was performed using HeLa cells expressing BAG2-wt or BAG2-S20A mutant. As shown in Fig. 5B, mutation at Ser20 dramatically inhibited the pI shifts (left panel) that were observed in wild type BAG2 in response to anisomycin treatment (right). Moreover, only two forms of BAG2 with more basic pI values (spots a and b) were detectable in HeLa cells expressing mutant BAG2, although four forms of BAG2 with different pIs were detectable in HeLa cells expressing wild type BAG2 (spots a–d). Therefore, it is highly likely that spots c and d correspond to BAG2 phosphorylated at Ser20 by p38-dependent pathways. These results demonstrated that BAG2 was phosphorylated at Ser20 in response to anisomycin treatment in vivo. Judging from the pattern of two-dimensional immunoblot, another phosphorylation site independent of p38 activation was suggested. MAPKAPK2 Phosphorylates BAG2 in Vivo in Response to Anisomycin Treatment—MAPKAPK2 is activated downstream of p38 MAPK, and we have proved that recombinant MAP-KAPK2 is able to phosphorylate GST-BAG2 in vitro (Fig. 5A). Next we generated siRNA targeting endogenous MAPKAPK2 to evaluate the role of MAPKAPK2 in the p38 MAPK cascade in respect to phosphorylation of BAG2. To ascertain the efficiency of siRNA, 293 cells cultured in 6-well plates were transfected with 250 or 500 ng of siMAPKAPK2. Two days after transfection, cell lysates were prepared and subjected to immunoblot with anti-MAPKAPK2 antibody (Fig. 6A). The result showed that 250 ng of siMAPKAPK2 were sufficient to suppress the endogenous expression of MAPKAPK2. Phosphorylation of BAG2 in response to anisomycin treatment was then examined by two-dimensional immunoblot in 293 cells co-transfected with 500 ng pEF-BOS/HA-BAG2 and either 500 ng of control RNA (top panel) or 500 ng of siMAPKAPK2 (second panel). siMAPKAPK2 significantly reduced the intensities of spots c and d, suggesting the essential role of MAPKAPK2 in the anisomycin-dependent phosphorylation of BAG2. SB203580 treatment of cells co-transfected with 500 ng of pEF-BOS/HA-BAG2 and 500 ng of control RNA also diminished the spot intensities of a and b as already shown in Figs. 3 and 5. MAPKAPK2 level was also examined on the same blot showing the efficacy of siRNA-mediated inhibition of MAPKAPK2 expression. Nonspecifically reacted spots on the upper left corners showed the equal loadings of protein samples. The results indicate that significant portion of anisomycin-induced phosphorylation of BAG2 is mediated by MAPKAPK2. Cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis are regulated by diverse extracellular signals. The MAPK cascades integrate and process various extracellular signals by phosphorylating substrates, which alters their catalytic activities and conformations or creates binding sites for protein-protein interactions. To identify proteins that are involved in MAPK cascades, diverse approaches were developed. We have shown here that components of the p38 MAPK cascade can be identified by a proteomic approach. Our approach consisted of phosphoprotein purification, 2D-DIGE, and identification of proteins by peptide mass finger printing. This method enabled us to identify many spots unique to p38 MAPK-activated cells, which may be the candidates for the factors involved in the signaling pathway. Our approach is suitable to identify components that are phosphorylated within minutes after stimulation. Previous approaches such as transient expression of the active form of kinases in the cascade may not be appropriate to detect such factors. Interaction between a kinase and its substrates is generally not strong enough to pull down its substrates by immunoaffinity purification. A yeast two-hybrid system often produces false positives. The enrichment of phosphoproteins may be effective to identify minor components such as factors involved in signal transduction, since when total cell lysates from p38 MAPK-activated and -suppressed cells were analyzed by 2D-DIGE under the same conditions, most of the red spots detected by using phosphoprotein-enriched samples were hardly visible hidden behind other spots of nonphosphorylated proteins (data not shown). We detected numerous red or orange spots at a higher molecular weight range (Fig. 1A). By using narrower pH ranges for the first dimension and polyacrylamide gels at different concentrations for the second dimension, more candidates will be detected. We are focusing our effort to identify these proteins by peptide mass fingerprinting. We identified here BAG2 and splicing factor arginine/serine-rich 9 the phosphorylation of which varies upon stimulation of p38 MAPK cascade together with Hsp27, a known substrate for p38-activated MAPKAPK2. All of spots b–d in Fig. 1 were Hsp27. Since Hsp27 proteins are phosphorylated by MAP-KAPK2 at three sites, spots c and d may reflect different phosphorylation states. Since spot b was green (more abundant in p38-suppressed cells) and spots c and d were red (more abundant in p38-activated cells) with more acidic pI values, Hsp27 in spot b may undergo shifts to spots c and d by p38-dependent phosphorylation. MAPKAPK2 regulates heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A0 biding to cytokine mRNAs through phosphorylation. Arginine/serine-rich 9 also binds to mRNA of heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 and regulates its alternative splicing. If the activity of arginine/serine-rich 9 can be changed through phosphorylation, it would provide another example of regulation of mRNA metabolism by p38/MAPKAPK2 cascade. BAG2 was phosphorylated in a p38 MAPK-dependent manner in response to anisomycin stimulation. An in vitro kinase assay clearly demonstrated that MAPKAPK2 phosphorylated BAG2 on Ser20. Moreover, by utilizing a Ser to Ala mutant, we confirmed that BAG2-Ser20 was phosphorylated in a p38 MAPK-dependent manner. The results of two-dimensional immunoblot using the BAG2-S20A mutant suggested that there was another phosphorylation site on BAG2. The detail of the phosphorylation is currently unknown. siRNA-mediated inhibition of MAPKAPK2 expression significantly but not completely decreased the shifts in pI of BAG2 (Fig. 6), suggesting that p38-dependent kinase(s) other than MAPKAPK2 exists. Possible candidates are other MAPKAPK family members, since their substrate specificity resembles that of MAPKAPK2 (28New L. Jiang Y. Zhao M. Liu K. Zhu W. Flood L.J. Kato Y. Parry G.C. Han J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3372-3384Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Previous studies demonstrated that BAG family proteins are known as pivotal binding partner proteins of Hsc/Hsp70 molecular chaperones. All of the BAG1, BAG2, the BAG3 proteins interact with ATPase domain of Hsc/Hsp70 through the BAG domains, and suppress the chaperon activities of Hsc/Hsp70 in vitro (29Takayama S. Xie Z. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 781-786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Furthermore, most of BAG family proteins play important roles in the regulation of apoptosis, cell survival, and stress response. For example, BAG4 (SODD) was identified as a binding partner for tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 (TNF-R1), death receptor 3, and Bcl-2 and was shown to act in an antiapoptotic manner (30Antoku K. Maser R.S. Scully Jr., W.J. Delach S.M. Johnson D.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 1003-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 31Jiang Y. Woronicz J.D. Liu W. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1999; 283: 543-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). BAG3 was also reported as a regulator of stress-induced apoptosis in normal and neoplastic leukocytes (32Bonelli P. Petrella A. Rosati A. Romano M.F. Lerose R. Pagliuca M.G. Amelio T. Festa M. Martire G. Venuta S. Turco M.C. Leone A. Leukemia. 2004; 18: 358-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). These previous results suggested the involvement of BAG2 in the regulation of apoptosis. We therefore extensively examined the effect of BAG2 expression using wild type and mutants of S20A and S20D (phosphomimetic). However, none of them accelerated or inhibited the anisomycin-induced apoptosis of HeLa cells so far examined (data not shown). We confirmed the previous results and found that BAG2 constitutively bound to Hsp70 irrespective of the cellular stresses in vivo and that this tight binding to Hsp70 resulted in the strong inhibition of chaperon activity of Hsp70 in the refolding of denatured luciferase (data not shown). We also tested the effect of phosphorylation on the binding of BAG2 to Hsp70 using wild type and S20A and S20D mutants. However, these BAG2 proteins did not show significant difference in the binding to Hsp70 in vivo and in the inhibition of the chaperon activity. BAG family proteins share BAG domains at their C terminus, whereas their N-terminal regions did not show significant similarity, of which functions remain unclear. It is known that heat shock proteins form giant multimolecular complex possibly containing Hsp-binding proteins such as BAG2 (33Bukau B. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2428) Google Scholar). In this regard, it is of note that BAG2 has a coiled-coil domain near the amino terminus (Fig. 4). This coiled-coil domain starts at Ser20, which is the phosphorylation site by MAPKAPK-2. Since the coiled-coil domain functions in protein-protein interaction, it may be an interesting possibility that BAG2 interaction with other unidentified protein through the coiled-coil domain is regulated through the phosphorylation of BAG2 within the complex. In this study, we have demonstrated the method constituting of phosphoprotein purification, 2D-DIGE, and mass spectrometric determination of the proteins for the identification of substrates for p38 MAPK cascades. Our approach could be applicable to any protein kinase of which a specific inhibitor would be available. Therefore, this method will provide a wide range of applications to diverse biological phenomena. We thank Drs.

In Salmonella enterica, the thiH gene product is required for the synthesis of the 4-methyl-5-β hydroxyethyl-thiazole monophosphate moiety of TPP.

Thiamine pyrophosphate is an essential cofactor that stabilizes acyl carbanions generated by several enzymes in carbohydrate metabolism such as transketolase, α-ketoacid decarboxylase, α-ketoacid dehydrogenase, and acetolactate synthase.

Our understanding of thiazole biosynthesis has increased dramatically with the reconstitution of the pathway in cell-free extracts by two groups (9Park J.H. Dorrestein P.C. Zhai H. Kinsland C.

Chem. 2004; 279: 17054-17062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Although these groups used proteins from Bacillus subtilis and E. coli, the proposed mechanisms are similar. The primary difference between these pathways is the generation of the glycine imine intermediate from which the C-2 and N-3 of the thiazole product are derived. In B. subtilis, ThiO catalyzes the oxidation of glycine to form the imine (11Settembre E.C. Dorrestein P.C. Park J.H. Augustine A.M. Begley T.P. Ealick S.E. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2971-2981Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), whereas in E. coli, the imine intermediate is proposed to be the product of ThiH (10Leonardi R. Roach P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17054-17062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In the case of ThiH, it is suggested that an interaction between S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet), and the [Fe-S] cluster allows the formation of the 5′-deoxyadenosyl radical, generating a tryosyl radical that results in the glycine imine via a series of steps (10Leonardi R. Roach P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17054-17062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Genetic studies identified a connection between thiamine biosynthesis and [Fe-S] cluster metabolism in Salmonella enterica and suggested that ThiH was the weak link in thiazole synthesis (12Gralnick J. Webb E. Beck B. Downs D. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5180-5187Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). ThiH is a 45-kDa protein that was identified as a member of the radical AdoMet superfamily of proteins (13Sofia H.J. Chen G. Hetzler B.G. Reyes-Spindola J.F. Miller N.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1097-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). Proteins in this superfamily are characterized by a conserved cysteine motif (CXXXCXXC) that provides three cysteine ligands for a labile [4Fe-4S] cluster. The characterized proteins of this family generate radical species by reductive cleavage of AdoMet at the [Fe-S] cluster, and structural and biochemical data have shown that the AdoMet molecule binds either the iron that is not liganded by the protein or one of the μ3-bridging sulfides of the cluster (14Chen D.

ThiH homologs are not prevalent in genomes of microorganisms that synthesize thiamine. Organisms that are able to synthesize thiamine yet lack thiH (e.g. B. subtilis and Rizobium etli) have thiO, which encodes a glycine oxidase (11Settembre E.C. Dorrestein P.C. Park J.H. Augustine A.M.

The difference(s) between the chemistries and metabolic requirements of the ThiO and ThiH pathways in vivo are not clear. Our interest in thiazole biosynthesis focuses on understanding the integration of this pathway with the metabolic network of the cell. The work herein was initiated to better understand both the direct and indirect requirements for ThiH activity in vivo. A series of thiH mutations were generated, and the mutant phenotypes were characterized. Data obtained support a role for an [Fe-S] cluster and AdoMet in the function of ThiH and define other critical residues that suggest structural features of the protein.

The appropriate strains were transformed with relevant plasmid DNA by electroporation using an E. coli Pulser (Bio-Rad Instruments) for 3 s at 2 kV. After an hour of incubation, the mixture was plated on nutrient agar plates with the relevant antibiotic. PCR Mutagenesis—For PCR mutagenesis plasmid pThiH1 (wild type thiH in pSU19 (26Bartolome B. Jubete Y. Martinez E. de la Cruz F. Gene. 1991; 102: 75-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar)) was used as a template. Gene specific primers (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA) with the following sequence were used in amplification reactions with Vent (exo-) polymerase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA): NdeF3P, 5′PO4GAAGGAGATATACATATGAAAACCTTCACCGAC-3′ and BamR2P, 5′PO4AGGATCCTCACCGCGTTTGCGAAG-3′. The mutagenized population of thiH fragments was gel purified and ligated into pSU19 that had been digested with SmaI and treated with calf intestinal phosphatase (Promega, Madison, WI). Ligation mixtures were transformed into strain DM2275 (thiH) and plated on nutrient broth-chloramphenicol. The chloramphenicol resistant transformants were scored for their nutritional requirement by replica printing to minimal media, minimal media with l-tyrosine, and minimal media with thiamine. All plasmid-containing strains were reconstructed, and the phenotypes were verified. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Two different methods for site-directed mutagenesis were used. One method involved the generation of two PCR products using either Nde3P or BamR2P primers with a primer with the desired mutation. Both fragments were gel purified and used together in a PCR reaction with the external Nde3P and BamR2P primers, generating a full-length thiH that was then ligated into pSU19. A second method was performed as described in the QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Mutant plasmids were confirmed by sequence analysis. DNA Sequencing—DNA sequencing was performed at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Biotechnology Center-Nucleic Acid Facility. DNA sequence analysis program BLAST was used to compare the sequences to wild type thiH sequence from the data base (27Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (68368) Google Scholar). Liquid Growth—Nutritional requirements were determined by replica printing on solid media and liquid growth analysis. For the latter, strains were grown overnight in nutrient broth (plus chloramphenicol as indicated) and cells were pelleted, resuspended in saline, and inoculated into liquid media, and absorbance at 650 nm (A650) was used to monitor growth (25Petersen L.A. Downs D.M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4894-4900Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When final yield was to be measured, growth was initiated as described above, and the A650 was measured after 18 h of incubation at 37 °C with shaking. When strains containing gshA, apbC, or apbE were assessed for thiazole synthesis, HMP was provided in the media at a level that allowed growth of a thiC mutant. Overexpression of AdoMet Synthase—Plasmids pMETK2 and a control vector (pPL1 (28Lutz R. Bujard H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1203-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (1190) Google Scholar)) were a gift from N. Buan and J. C. Escalante-Semerena. MetK was induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside to the medium at a final concentration of 1 mm. Conserved [Fe-S] Cluster and AdoMet Binding Motifs Are Critical for ThiH Function in Vivo—The thiH gene was mutagenized using both random (PCR) and directed approaches. Missense mutations in thiH were generated in plasmid pThiH1 and introduced into a strain lacking a functional thiH gene in the chromosome. Substitutions that affected the in vivo function of ThiH were identified by growth phenotype. The locations of mutated residues are shown in Fig. 2A, and the specific substitutions are listed in Fig. 2B. Effect of Mutations Affecting the Putative [Fe-S] Cluster Binding Motif—Site-directed mutagenesis was used to change amino acid residues 87, 89, and 91 to alanine. Each of these residues was within the CXXXCXXC92 motif diagnostic of the radical AdoMet superfamily of proteins and was considered to be the site of coordination of the [Fe-S] cluster (13Sofia H.J.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15668-15673Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). All three mutant proteins failed to support growth of strain DM460 (thiH) in the absence of THZ or thiamine. A conservative Y91F substitution, generated by site-specific mutagenesis, also resulted in a non-functional protein in vivo. Effect of Mutations Affecting the Putative AdoMet Binding Motif—S. enterica ThiH contains a sequence block (LLLVTGEHQAKV136) that shares weak identity with the AdoMet binding motif found in S-adenosylmethionine methyltransferases (13Sofia H.J. Chen G. Hetzler B.G. Reyes-Spindola J.F. Miller N.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1097-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). In this motif, residues Gly-130 and Glu-131 are conserved among the 20 ThiH homologs considered in this analysis. Alanine substitutions at G130A or E131A inactivated ThiH. In addition, an E131K substitution mutation was isolated in a screen for randomly generated for thiH null alleles. Critical Residues Are Dispersed Throughout ThiH—Random mutagenesis identified amino acid substitutions that eliminated in vivo function of ThiH. Only alleles that resulted in stable proteins (as determined by immunoblot analysis) were considered. Residues critical for function were distributed throughout the protein (Fig. 2A). As expected, substitutions that eliminated in vivo function of the enzyme primarily changed conserved or invariant residues; a notable exception was the E187D substitution. At this position, a glutamic acid residue is found in only 3 of 20 ThiH homologs, and yet in S. enterica ThiH reduction of the side chain of this residue by one methylene group generated a null phenotype. The null phenotype of this conservative substitution was confirmed by creating the same allele by site-directed mutagenesis. Multiple Residue Changes That Generate a ThiH* Phenotype—We identified previously a unique class of thiH alleles that encode proteins (referred to as ThiH*) that are functional in vivo when tyrosine is present (12Gralnick J. Webb E. Beck B. Downs D. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5180-5187Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The mutations of this class described previously generated mutant proteins ThiHH124Y or ThiHP347S (12Gralnick J. Webb E. Beck B. Downs D. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5180-5187Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Additional plasmids encoding thiH alleles of this class were generated in this work (Fig. 2). Substitution of Residues That Result in a Null or ThiH* Phenotypes—Two residues, Cys-285 and Ala-61 (Fig. 2), were of interest because substitutions at these residues were found in proteins that caused null or ThiH* phenotypes. In the case of residue Cys-285, a change to histidine eliminated function, whereas a change to an alanine resulted in the ThiH* phenotype. Strikingly, only 11 of 20 homologs have a cysteinyl residue at this position, and the remaining 9 have an alanine. An alanine to threonine change at position 61 resulted in a null phenotype, whereas the ThiH* phenotype was observed with a change to serine and only when another mutation was present, P334Q. thiH alleles with either one of these single substitutions encoded functional proteins. AdoMet Synthase in Multicopy Restores Thiamine Synthesis to thiH* Mutants—We noted that the H124Y mutation was juxtaposed to the AdoMet binding motif (Fig. 2A), raising the possibility that a ThiH* phenotype reflected weak AdoMet binding. To pursue this hypothesis, the wild type allele of the gene encoding S-adenosylmethionine synthase (metK) was introduced into two mutant strains, DM4104 and DM4106, that have a ThiH* phenotype and contain ThiHH124Y and ThiHP347S mutant proteins, respectively. The resulting strains were monitored for thiamine-independent growth. As shown in Fig. 3, increased levels of MetK restored thiamine synthesis in these two strains. The induction of metK in plasmid pMETK2 increases AdoMet synthase activity >5-fold. 2P. Frey, personal communication. ThiH* Phenotype Caused by Other Metabolic Functions Is Distinct from That of thiH Alleles—Mutations in loci involved in Fe-S cluster metabolism (gshA, apbC, apbE, iscA) result a ThiH* phenotype (12Gralnick J. Webb E. Beck B. Downs D. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5180-5187Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 18Skovran E. Downs D.M. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 98-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 19Skovran E. Downs D.M. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3896-3903Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The induction of metK in gshA, apbC, or apbE mutant strain backgrounds failed to allow significant growth in the absence of tyrosine or THZ (data not shown). This result suggested that the ThiH* phenotype could be generated by at least two mechanisms. This interpretation was consistent with the observation that suppressors of the gshA, apbC, or apbE mutant strains (anaerobic growth, over-production of YggX) were unable to restore thiamine synthesis in strains with a thiH* allele (data not shown). Plasmids containing each of nine alleles of thiH generating a ThiH* phenotype were transformed into gshA, apbE, or apbC mutant backgrounds. Growth of the resulting strains in medium supplemented with thiamine or l-tyrosine was assessed. The resulting data showed that each of the 27 resulting strains had a null mutant phenotype (i.e. requirement for THZ or thiamine). In medium with or without tyrosine, the cell density (A650) of cultures of 26 of these strains was between 0.02 and 0.13 after 18 h of incubation with no further increase observed after 24 h of incubation. A culture of the remaining strain reached an A650 of 0.3. In the presence of thiamine, all cultures reached high cell densities (A650 > 0.7) after 18 h of incubation. Control experiments confirmed that a thiH null mutant (DM460) carrying each of these plasmids individually displayed a ThiH* phenotype, as reflected by a final A650 ranging from 0.04 to 0.15 and 0.61 to 1.3 in minimal medium or minimal medium supplemented with tyrosine or thiamine, respectively. Finally, when the only source of ThiH was encoded by a plasmid carrying the wild type allele of thiH, strains with lesions in the gshA, apbE, and apbC genes retained a ThiH* phenotype (data not shown). Oligomers Formed by Different ThiH* Mutant Proteins Restore Function—Four plasmids carrying thiH alleles encoding ThiH* proteins were transformed into a strain carrying a chromosomal thiH allele that encodes a ThiH* protein (DM4104). Growth of the resulting strains was assessed, and the results are summarized in Table II. Some combinations of the chromosomal and plasmid-encoded ThiH* proteins allowed thiamine-independent growth. Of the four alleles tested, three allowed growth on minimal medium when present in a strain containing the ThiHH124Y mutant protein. A similar pattern of growth was seen with the same plasmids present in a strain containing the ThiHP347S mutant protein (data not shown). As expected, strains carrying the same allele on the chromosome and plasmid maintained a requirement for thiazole or tyrosine. This result is consistent with (but not conclusive of) the functional form of ThiH being a multimer and does not exclude its interaction with other proteins as suggested (20Leonardi R. Fairhurst S.A. Kriek M. Lowe D.J. Roach P.L.

Fairhurst S.A. Kriek M. Lowe D.J. Roach P.L. FEBS Lett. 2003; 539: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and thiazole synthesis has been reconstituted in two systems (9Park J.H.

Chem. 2004; 279: 17054-17062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), no activity assay for purified ThiH has yet been described. To circumvent the lack of an in vitro ThiH activity assay we took an in vivo approach to gain insights into the mechanism of function of this protein in S. enterica. The in vivo characterization of mutant ThiH proteins described here provides the basis for future work aimed at integrating the results of in vivo and in vitro studies of ThiH function. Structural Features Critical for ThiH Function—Sequence analysis of ThiH identifies a CXXCXXXC92 motif and residues of a weakly defined AdoMet binding motif (LLVTGEHQAKV136) that together result in the assignment of ThiH to the AdoMet radical superfamily (13Sofia H.J. Chen G. Hetzler B.G. Reyes-Spindola J.F. Miller N.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1097-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). The identification of substitutions at these residues that eliminate ThiH function support a role for AdoMet and the [Fe-S] cluster in enzyme mechanism. Among radical AdoMet proteins there is a near consensus requirement for an aromatic residue in the position adjacent to the third cysteinyl residue of this motif (e.g. X91). In S. enterica ThiH this residue is a tyrosine, and a substitution by alanine or phenylalanine inactivates the protein. In the published structures of biotin synthase (BioB) (15Berkovitch F. Nicolet Y. Wan J.T. Jarrett J.T. Drennan C.L. Science. 2004; 303: 76-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar), coproporphyrinogen III oxidase (HemN) (16Logan D.T. Andersson J. Sjoberg B.M. Nordlund P. Science. 1999; 283: 1499-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), and pyruvate-formatelyase activase this residue (Tyr, Phe, and Tyr respectively) interacts with the adenine moiety of AdoMet. In the case of BioB this interaction could be explained by a hydrogen bond between the hydroxyl group of the tyrosyl residue and the 3′-hydroxyl group of the adenyl moiety of AdoMet. 3Available at www.proteinexplorer.org. The fact that phenylalanine cannot substitute for tyrosine at position 91 in the S. enterica ThiH suggests a critical role for the hydroxyl group of the tyrosine. In HemN and pyruvate-formate-lyase activase the aromatic interaction between the purine moiety of AdoMet and the respective phenylalanine residue is responsible for stabilization. Two residues within the putative AdoMet binding motif, namely Gly-130 and Glu-131, were found to be critical for function. Structural data available for HemN suggests that these residues interact with the adenine moiety of AdoMet. Residue Glu-187 is critical for ThiH function in S. enterica. This may be a specific feature of a few ThiH homologs because a glutamyl residue is found at this position in only 3 of the 20 homologs analyzed. The structural role of residue Glu-187 is so critical that shortening the side chain of this residue by a single carbon eliminates enzyme activity. We predict that the Glu-187 residue is also critical for the function of the other two ThiH homologs in which it is present. Comparison of the primary sequence of ThiH with those of radical AdoMet proteins, HemN and BioB, for which crystal structures are available identified a number of residues that are conserved in the active site. Residues Cys-89 and Tyr-91 are conserved in all radical AdoMet proteins (13Sofia H.J. Chen G. Hetzler B.G. Reyes-Spindola J.F. Miller N.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1097-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). Our mutational analysis supports the important roles of these residues in enzyme function. The ThiH* Phenotype Provides Insight on ThiH Structure and Function in Vivo—Mutants that require tyrosine, THZ, or thiamine are said to have a ThiH* phenotype. Our working model suggests that a ThiH* phenotype may result from disrupting one of two structural features of the ThiH protein, either AdoMet binding or [Fe-S] cluster integrity. We suggest that correction of the ThiH* phenotype by increased levels of AdoMet supports the idea of AdoMet stabilizing the former class of mutant proteins. The lesions in the two mutants that were suppressed by increased AdoMet levels are consistent with this hypothesis, in particular the H124Y substitution, which is directly adjacent to the AdoMet binding motif. Mutants defective in apbC, apbE, or gshA functions are compromised in the assembly and/or repair of Fe-S clusters (12Gralnick J. Webb E. Beck B. Downs D. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5180-5187Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 18Skovran E. Downs D.M. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 98-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and thus we have proposed that the ThiH* phenotype in strains lacking these functions reflects a compromised Fe-S cluster (12Gralnick J. Webb E. Beck B. Downs D. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5180-5187Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We propose that some thiH lesions that generate the ThiH* phenotype do so by disrupting the structure of the Fe-S cluster. The effect of such mutations would not be corrected by increased levels of AdoMet as is the case for mutations affecting AdoMet binding. Significantly, tyrosine restores ThiH function in both classes of proteins suggesting that the binding of tyrosine may provide stability lost by reduced binding of AdoMet or a destabilized Fe-S cluster. There is precedent for a stabilizing role of substrate in radical AdoMet enzymes. In the case of BioB there is >20-fold enhancement of AdoMet binding when the substrate (dethiobiotin) is bound (15Berkovitch F. Nicolet Y. Wan J.T. Jarrett J.T. Drennan C.L. Science. 2004; 303: 76-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Noteworthy was the finding that tyrosine did not restore function to a ThiH protein that was simultaneously compromised in both AdoMet and Fe-S cluster binding, perhaps indicating the severity of the structural defects in this situation. Analysis of the BioB and HemN structures show that the C-terminal portion of the protein is partially folded back with residues of the N-terminal in close proximity. We envision an active site of ThiH that is defined by residues involved in the binding of the Fe-S cluster and AdoMet and suggest that tyrosine has contacts near both the C and N termini indicating a folded structure similar to that of BioB (15Berkovitch F. Nicolet Y. Wan J.T. Jarrett J.T. Drennan C.L. Science. 2004; 303: 76-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). This conformation is consistent with the mutant analysis of thiH, particularly the finding that two substitutions (A61S/P334Q and A51V/A373P) are found in some strains with a ThiH* phenotype. In the case of ThiHA61S/P334Q neither substitution alone disrupted function of the protein (although an A61T substitution was non-functional), yet together they generated a ThiH* phenotype. The similarity of substitutions (A51V/A373P) found in another mutant with a ThiH* phenotype was striking. We interpret these results to indicate that in the folded protein, the N-terminal residues (Ala-52 and Ala-61) are in close proximity with those in the C terminus (Pro-334 and Ala-373). This interpretation is bolstered by the distribution of randomly generated mutations in the primary sequence of ThiH (Fig. 2A). In this analysis, 9/12 residues involved in ThiH* phenotypes and 4/10 causing null mutants are in the first 61 residues or the last 40 residues of the protein. One interpretation of the apparent intragenic complementation that occurred between different alleles of thiH with a ThiH* phenotype is that ThiH functions in vivo as a homomultimer. Experiments performed in E. coli with overexpressed proteins suggested that the ThiH formed a complex with ThiG (20Leonardi R. Fairhurst S.A. Kriek M. Lowe D.J. Roach P.L. FEBS Lett. 2003; 539: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This possibility is not excluded by our data. However, comparison with members of the two-component radical AdoMet enzymes, such as pyruvate-formate-lyase activase (PflB) showed that ThiG does not have the characteristic motif RXXGY that provides the glycine loop present in the activation subunit of these enzymes. Additional work, both in vivo and in vitro, is required to clarify the oligomeric state and biochemical mechanism associated with functional ThiH.

https://openalex.org/W2022146485,"Tightly regulated expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II genes is critical for the immune system. A conserved regulatory module consisting of four cis-acting elements, the W, X, X2 and Y boxes, controls transcription of MHC class II genes. The X, X2, and Y boxes are bound, respectively, by RFX, CREB, and NF-Y to form a MHC class II-specific enhanceosome complex. The latter constitutes a landing pad for recruitment of the transcriptional co-activator CIITA. In contrast to the well defined roles of the X, X2, and Y boxes, the role of the W region has remained controversial. In vitro binding studies have suggested that it might contain a second RFX-binding site. We demonstrate here by means of promoter pull-down assays that the most conserved subsequence within the W region, called the S box, is a critical determinant for tethering of CIITA to the enhanceosome complex. Binding of CIITA to the enhanceosome requires both integrity of the S box and a remarkably stringent spacing between the S and X boxes. Even a 1–2-base pair change in the native S-X distance is detrimental for CIITA recruitment and promoter function. In contrast to current models, binding of RFX to a putative duplicated binding site in the W box is thus not required for either CIITA recruitment or promoter activity. This paves the way for the identification of novel factors mediating the contribution of the S box to the activation of MHC class II promoters."

To probe the movement of this loop (residues 152–164), a site-directed mutant of metallo-β-lactamase L1 was engineered that contained a Trp residue on the loop to serve as a fluorescent probe. It was necessary first, however, to evaluate the contribution of each native Trp residue to the fluorescence changes observed during the catalytic cycle of wild-type L1. Five site-directed mutants of L1 (W39F, W53F, W204F, W206F, and W269F) were prepared and characterized using metal analyses, CD spectroscopy, steady-state kinetics, stopped-flow fluorescence, and fluorescence titrations. All mutants retained the wild-type tertiary structure and bound Zn(II) at levels comparable with wild type and exhibited only slight (<10-fold) decreases in kcat values as compared with wild-type L1 for all substrates tested. Fluorescence studies revealed a single mutant, W39F, to be void of the fluorescence changes observed with wild-type L1 during substrate binding and catalysis. Using W39F as a template, a Trp residue was added to the flexile loop over the active site of L1, to generate the double mutant, W39F/D160W. This double mutant retained all the structural and kinetic characteristics of wild-type L1. Stopped-flow fluorescence and rapid-scanning UV-visible studies revealed the motion of the loop (kobs = 27 ± 2 s–1) to be similar to the formation rate of a reaction intermediate (kobs = 25 ± 2 s–1).

The ability of bacteria to acquire resistance to antibiotics is a serious problem that continues to challenge modern society (1Neu H.C. Science. 1992; 257: 1064-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (2373) Google Scholar). Excessive and often misuse of antibiotics in the clinic and for agricultural purposes has resulted in tremendous selective pressure for antibiotic-resistant bacteria (2Levy S.B. Sci. Am. 1998; 3: 47-53Google Scholar). These bacteria utilize a variety of methods to become resistant, including modification of cell wall components to prevent antibiotic binding, expression of efflux pumps that transport the antibiotic out of the cell, and the production of enzymes that hydrolyze and render antibiotics ineffective (1Neu H.C. Science. 1992; 257: 1064-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (2373) Google Scholar, 2Levy S.B. Sci. Am. 1998; 3: 47-53Google Scholar). The most common, least expensive, and effective antibiotics currently used are the β-lactams, such as carbapenems, cephalosporins, and penicillins (3Kotra L.P. Mobashery S. Arch. Immunol. Ther. Exp. 1999; 47: 211-216PubMed Google Scholar, 4Bush K. Mobashery S. Mobashery R.A. Resolving the Antibiotic Paradox. Kluwer Academic /Plenum Publishers, New York1998: 71-98Google Scholar). These antibiotics are mechanism-based inhibitors of transpeptidase, a bacterial enzyme required for the production of a strong viable cell wall (5Bush K. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1989; 33: 264-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 6Bush K. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1989; 33: 271-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In response to their widespread use, an increasing number of bacterial strains have acquired the ability to produce β-lactamases, enzymes that hydrolyze and render β-lactam antibiotics ineffective. There are more than 300 distinct β-lactamases known, and Bush has classified these into four distinct groups based on their molecular properties (5Bush K. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1989; 33: 264-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 6Bush K. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1989; 33: 271-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). One of the more troubling of these is group 3, the metallo-β-lactamases, which are Zn(II)-dependent enzymes that hydrolyze nearly all known β-lactams and for which there are no clinically useful inhibitors (7Siemann S.

Research Signpost. 1999; 3: 105-132Google Scholar). To date, there are no reports of a metallo-β-lactamase being isolated from a major pathogen (15Bush K. Clin. Infect. Dis. 2001; 32: 1085-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 16Rice L.B. Bonomo R.A. Drug Resist. Updat. 2000; 3: 178-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar); however, these enzymes are produced by a variety of minor clinical pathogens such as Bacteroides fragilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and the continued extensive use of β-lactam containing antibiotics will inevitably result in the production of a metallo-β-lactamase by a major pathogen (2Levy S.B. Sci. Am. 1998; 3: 47-53Google Scholar). There is significant diversity within the metallo-β-lactamases, and Bush, based on their amino acid sequence identities and substrate affinities, has further divided them into three subgroups (17Bush K. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1998; 27: 48-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). A similar grouping scheme based on structural properties has also been offered (18Galleni M. Lamotte-Brasseur J. Rossolini G.M. Spencer J. Dideberg O. Frere J.M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2001; 45: 660-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). The diversity of these subgroups is best exemplified by their vastly differing efficacies toward non-clinical inhibitors; these differences lead to the prediction that finding a single inhibitor for all metallo-β-lactamases may not be possible (14Crowder M.W.

To address this problem, we are currently characterizing a representative enzyme from each of the metallo-β-lactamase subgroups with the goal of identifying common structural and mechanistic similarities that can be targeted for the generation of clinically useful inhibitors. This work describes our efforts on characterizing metallo-β-lactamase L1 1The abbreviations used are: L1, metallo-β-lactamase from S. maltophilia; apo, metal-free; WT, wild type; PM, photomultiplier. from S. maltophilia. S. maltophilia is an important pathogen in nosocomial infections of immunocompromised patients suffering from cancer, cystic fibrosis, drug addition, and AIDS, and in patients with organ transplants and on dialysis (28Khardori N.

Schacher B. Frei R. Rev. Infect. Dis. 1988; 10: 765-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and to β-lactams, due to the production of a chromosomally expressed group 2e β-lactamase (L2) and a group 3c β-lactamase (L1) (32Walsh T.R. Payne D.J. Neville T. Tolson D. MacGowan A.P. Bennett P.M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1997; 41: 1460-1462Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Walsh T.R. Hall L. Assinder S.J. Nichols W.W. Cartwright S.J. MacGowan A.P. Bennett P.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1218: 199-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). L1 has been cloned, overexpressed, and partially characterized by kinetic and crystallographic studies (34Crowder M.W. Walsh T.R. Banovic L. Pettit M. Spencer J. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 921-926Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Ullah J.H. Walsh T.R. Taylor I.A. Emery D.C. Verma C.S. Gamblin S.J. Spencer J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 125-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). The enzyme exists as a homotetramer of ∼118 kDa in solution and in the crystalline state, tightly binding two Zn(II) ions per subunit. The Zn1 site has three histidine residues and one bridging hydroxide as ligands, and the Zn2 site has two histidines, one aspartic acid, one terminally bound water, and the bridging hydroxide as ligands (Fig. 1). Efforts to solve the crystal structure of one of the metallo-β-lactamases with a bound substrate molecule have failed, most likely due to the high activity of the enzymes, even in the crystalline state, toward all β-lactam-containing antibiotics (35Ullah J.H.

Therefore, computational studies have been used extensively to study substrate binding, the role of the Zn(II) ions in catalysis, the protonation state of the active site, protein dynamics, and inhibitor binding (35Ullah J.H.

The crystal structure of L1 reveals a series of amino acids that form a flexible loop, a structural feature shared with other metallo-β-lactamases, which extends over its active site (residues 152–164). It has been suggested that this loop plays an important role during the catalytic cycle of the enzyme, clamping down on substrate, perhaps inducing strain to assist in hydrolysis or helping to stabilize a reaction intermediate (35Ullah J.H. Walsh T.R. Taylor I.A. Emery D.C. Verma C.S. Gamblin S.J. Spencer J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 125-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). To monitor the motion of this loop in L1, we proposed to introduce a Trp residue on the loop to act as a fluorescent probe. However, this simple approach was complicated by the presence of five Trp residues in wild-type L1: Trp-39, Trp-53, Trp-204, Trp-206, and Trp-269 at 6.2, 25.2, 18.8, 39.8, and 19.6 Å from the active site, respectively (Fig. 1). Spencer and co-workers (43Spencer J. Clark A.R. Walsh T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33638-33644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) had demonstrated previously that the quenching of fluorescence and subsequent return to original values in wild-type L1 could be used to monitor substrate binding and catalysis (43Spencer J. Clark A.R. Walsh T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33638-33644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). It was, therefore, necessary to determine whether these fluorescence changes could be pinpointed to a single Trp residue. To this end, five mutant enzymes were generated in which each Trp residue, in turn, was changed to a Phe residue, resulting in five mutant enzymes: W39F, W53F, W204F, W206F, and W269F. Because of its proximity to the active site and predicted edge/face interaction with His-263, a metal binding ligand (35Ullah J.H. Walsh T.R. Taylor I.A. Emery D.C. Verma C.S. Gamblin S.J. Spencer J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 125-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that if indeed the observed fluorescence changes were due to a single Trp residue, it was likely Trp-39. If this strategy was successful a second mutation could be introduced into W39F, replacing Asp-160, a residue located on the flexible loop, with a Trp to act as a fluorescent probe, resulting in the double mutant W39F/D160W. This work describes our efforts to determine whether we could generate an enzyme free of fluorescence changes during substrate binding and catalysis and subsequently create a double mutant that could be used to monitor the dynamics of the flexible loop in L1. Escherichia coli strains DH5α and BL21(DE3) were obtained from Invitrogen and Novagen, respectively. The plasmid pET26b was purchased from Novagen. Primers for sequencing and mutagenesis studies were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies. QuikChange™ mutagensis kit was purchased from Stratagene.

Luria-Bertani media in powder form was purchased from Invitrogen. Isopropyl-β-thiogalactoside, Biotech grade, was procured from Anatrace. Protein solutions were concentrated with an Amicon ultrafiltration cell equipped with YM-10 DIAFLO membranes from Amicon, Inc. Dialysis tubing was prepared using Spectra/Por regenerated cellulose molecular porous membranes with a molecular weight cut-off of 6–8000 g/mol (44Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T.

Q-Sepharose Fast Flow was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Nitrocefin was purchased from BD Biosciences, and solutions of nitrocefin were filtered through a Fisher-brand 0.45-μm syringe filter (34Crowder M.W. Walsh T.R. Banovic L. Pettit M. Spencer J.

Meropenem was generously supplied by Zeneca Pharmaceuticals. All buffers and media were prepared using Barnstead NANOpure ultrapure water. The overexpression plasmid for L1, pUB5832, was mutated using the Stratagene QuikChange mutagenesis kit.

The DNA sequences were analyzed using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences ABI 5300 Genetic Analyzer. To test for overexpression of the mutant enzymes, E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cells were transformed with the mutated overexpression plasmids, and small scale growth cultures were used (45Carenbauer A.L. Garrity J.A. Periyannan G. Yates R.B. Crowder M.W. BMC Biochem. 2002; 3: 4-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Large scale (4-liter) preparations of the L1 mutants were performed as described previously (34Crowder M.W. Walsh T.R. Banovic L. Pettit M. Spencer J. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 921-926Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with the exception of W53F and W206F. With these two mutants we observed lower levels of isolatable protein using the established protocol and, therefore, reduced the temperature from 37 to 25 °C during cell growth and induction and subsequently were able to obtain amounts of isolatable protein comparable with those of wild-type L1. Protein purity was ascertained by SDS-PAGE. Extinction coefficients for the mutants were determined utilizing the BCA protein assay kit purchased from Fisher, with wild-type L1 used to create the calibration curve. The concentrations of L1 and the mutants were determined by measuring the protein absorbances at 280 nm and using the published extinction coefficient of ϵ280 nm = 54,606 m–1·cm–1 for wild-type L1 (34Crowder M.W. Walsh T.R. Banovic L. Pettit M. Spencer J. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 921-926Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the experimentally determined extinction coefficients for the mutants. Analysis of metal content was performed on enzyme samples that were incubated for 1 h on ice in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, containing a final concentration of 100 μm ZnCl2. Weakly bound metal was removed by dialysis versus 2 × 1 liter of metal-free (chelexed) 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5. A Varian Liberty 2 inductively coupled plasma spectrometer with atomic emission spectroscopy detection was used to determine the metal content of multiple preparations of wild-type L1 and L1 mutants. Calibration curves were based on four standards and had correlation coefficient limits of at least 0.9950. The final dialysis buffer was used as a blank. The emission line of 213.856 nm is the most intense for zinc and was used to determine the zinc content in the samples. The errors in metal content data reflect the S.D. (σn–1) of multiple enzyme preparations. Circular dichroism samples were prepared by dialyzing the purified enzyme samples versus 3× 2 liters of 5 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, over 6 h. The samples were diluted with final dialysis buffer to ∼75 μg/ml. A Jasco J-810 CD spectropolarimeter operating at 25 °C was used to collect CD spectra (34Crowder M.W. Walsh T.R. Banovic L. Pettit M. Spencer J. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 921-926Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Carenbauer A.L. Garrity J.A. Periyannan G. Yates R.B. Crowder M.W. BMC Biochem. 2002; 3: 4-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Steady-state kinetic assays were conducted at 25 °C in 50 mm cacodylate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 100 μm ZnCl2 on a HP 5480A diode array UV-visible spectrophotometer. The changes in molar absorptivities (Δϵ) used to follow the reactions were (in m–1cm–1): nitrocefin, Δϵ485 = 17,420; cephalothin, Δϵ265 = –8,790; meropenem, Δϵ293 = –7,600; penicillin G, Δϵ235 = –936. When possible, substrate concentrations were varied between 0.1 to 10 times the Km value, and changes in absorbance (ΔA) versus time data were measured for a period of 60 s for each substrate concentration. Steady-state kinetic constants, Km and kcat, were determined by fitting initial velocity versus substrate concentration data directly to the Michaelis equation using Igor Pro (34Crowder M.W. Walsh T.R. Banovic L. Pettit M. Spencer J. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 921-926Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The reported errors reflect fitting uncertainties. All steady-state kinetic studies were performed in triplicate with recombinant L1 and L1 mutants from at least three different enzyme preparations. Fluorescence spectra of 2 μm wild-type L1 and L1 mutant samples were obtained at 25 °C using an excitation wavelength of 295 nm on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS 55 luminescence spectrometer. Apo (metal-free) enzymes for fluorescence titrations were prepared by dialysis of samples versus 5× 1 liter of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, containing 10 mm phenanthroline followed by dialysis versus 5× 1 liters of metal-free (chelexed) 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, and metal analyses were used to verify that the enzymes were metal-free. Data from fluorescence titrations were fitted to f(x)=Finitial+(ΔF/[E])(0.5)(KD+[E]+x)−((KD+[E]+x)exp2−4xFinitial)(Eq. 1) where Finitial is the initial fluorescence reading for each sample, [E] is the apoenzyme concentration, KD is the dissociation constant, f(x) is fluorescence reading, and x is concentration (m) (46Stewart J.D. Roberts V.A. Thomas N.R. Getzoff E.D. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1994-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Stopped-flow fluorescence studies of nitrocefin hydrolysis by wild-type L1 and L1 mutants were performed on an Applied Photophysics SX.18MV spectrophotometer using an excitation wavelength of 295 nm and a WG320-nm cut-off filter on the photomultiplier. These experiments were conducted at 2 and 25 °C depending on the enzyme studied using the same buffer as in the rapid-scanning visible studies. Rapid-scanning UV-visible studies were performed under identical conditions using the above-mentioned instrument and utilizing an Applied Photophysics diode array detector. Wild-type L1 and the L1 mutants were overexpressed in E. coli and purified as previously described (34Crowder M.W. Walsh T.R. Banovic L. Pettit M. Spencer J. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 921-926Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with the changes for W53F and W206F as noted under “Experimental Procedures.” This procedure produced an average of 50–60 mg of >95% pure, active protein per 4 liters of growth culture. Circular dichroism spectra were collected on samples of wild-type L1 and each of the mutants to ensure the proteins produced using the pET26b overexpression system had the correct secondary structure. The CD spectra of wild-type L1 and the mutants were similar and showed an intense, broad feature at 190 nm and a smaller feature at 215 nm (data not shown). These features are consistent with a sample with significant α/β content (35Ullah J.H. Walsh T.R. Taylor I.A. Emery D.C. Verma C.S. Gamblin S.J. Spencer J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 125-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Analyses of the CD spectra were performed on-line using DICHROWEB utilizing an algorithm called CDSSTR (www.cryst.bbk.ac.uk/cdweb/html/home.html) (47Lobley A. Whitmore L. Wallace B.A. Bioinformatics. 2002; 18: 211-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar, 48Lobley A. Wallace B.A. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 1570Google Scholar). Results are shown in Table I. The CD spectra demonstrate no significant changes in the amount of unordered content and only minor differences in α/β content that can be attributed to fitting errors using the CDSSTR program. Metal analyses on multiple preparations of wild-type L1 and the mutants demonstrated that the wild-type L1 and W39F, W53F, W204F, W206F, W269F, and W39F/D160W mutants bind 1.9 ± 0.2, 1.9 ± 0.2, 1.6 ± 0.3, 1.8 ± 0.2, 1.5 ± 0.3, 2.0 ± 0.1, and 1.9 ± 0.2 Zn(II) eq per monomer (Table I). Within the limits of error, the metal analyses demonstrate that the single point mutations did not result in significant changes in metal binding ability of the enzymes.Table IAnalysis of CD spectra using CDSSTR using a 43-protein reference set optimized for 190–240 nmα-Helixβ-Sheetβ-TurnUnorderedMetal analysisϵ%%%%mol of Zn(II)/mol of monomerm-1·cm-1WT L1311821301.9 ± 0.254,606W39F292020311.9 ± 0.241,256W53F182426321.6 ± 0.346,387W204F202424321.8 ± 0.241,910W206F182524331.5 ± 0.336,969W269F302020302.0 ± 0.154,588W39F/D160W301921301.9 ± 0.254,600 Open table in a new tab Steady-state kinetic constants, Km and kcat, were determined for wild-type L1 and each of the mutants with four substrates. These values are presented in Table II.

The L1 preference for penicillins and carbapenems over cephalosporins, as exemplified by the kcat values, is in agreement with previous studies (34Crowder M.W. Walsh T.R. Banovic L. Pettit M. Spencer J. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 921-926Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and supports the L1 placement in the β-lactamase Bc family (17Bush K. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1998; 27: 48-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). For all substrates tested, the mutant enzymes exhibited slightly reduced kcat values (<10-fold) as compared with wild-type L1. Because Km values are often used as a first approximation of substrate binding (49Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1993: 44-53Google Scholar), the Km values exhibited by the mutants were compared with those of wild-type L1. All five mutants, with the exception of W39F and W39F/D160W, exhibited similar Km values to wild-type L1. Km values for W39F were typically 4-fold greater than those of wild-type L1, whereas those of the double mutant approached and in one case (cephalothin) exceeded 10-fold that of wild-type L1. Because changes of 10-fold or greater are the standard to indicate significant differences (50Fersht A. Enzyme Structure and Mechanism. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1985: 420-455Google Scholar), steady-state kinetics indicate that only W39F and W39F/D160W approach this standard. However, both enzymes retained enough activity to be suitable for the purpose of this study.Table IISteady-state kinetics constants for wild-type L1 and L1 mutantsNitrocefinCephalothinMeropenemPenicillin GkcatKmkcat/KmkcatKmkcat/KmkcatKmkcat/KmkcatKmkcat/Kms-1μms-1μms-1μms-1μmWT L141 ± 14.1 ± 1.01082 ± 58.9 ± 1.59.2157 ± 915 ± 410.5600 ± 10038 ± 215.8W39F38 ± 418 ± 52.133 ± 233 ± 71.033 ± 29 ± 23.796 ± 4125 ± 180.77W53F36 ± 13.9 ± 0.59.253 ± 14.9 ± 0.510.876 ± 312 ± 26.3402 ± 724 ± 316.8W204F30 ± 13.3 ± 0.29.146 ± 15.4 ± 0.78.566 ± 210 ± 26.6397 ± 735 ± 411.3W206F36 ± 14.0 ± 0.59.049 ± 214 ± 23.564 ± 211 ± 15.8407 ± 1231 ± 513.1W269F21 ± 12.1 ± 0.31055 ± 16.4 ± 0.78.634 ± 18 ± 14.3376 ± 1234 ± 611.1W39F/D160W39 ± 323 ± 41.723 ± 195 ± 110.2417 ± 16 ± 12.8161 ± 5356 ± 310.45 Open table in a new tab Initial fluorescence scans of wild-type L1 and the L1 mutants (Fig. 2) revealed that W39F and W206F exhibited decrease"

In this study we designed experiments to test whether PtdCho or its N-methylated lipid precursors were truly essential for the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In S. cerevisiae, PtdCho can be synthesized by the pathway PtdSer → PtdEtn → PtdEtn(Me) → PtdEtn(Me)2 → PtdCho as outlined in Fig. 1. Pem1p and Pem2p are methyltransferases that synthesize PtdCho from PtdEtn (4Summers E.F. Letts V.A. McGraw P. Henry S.A. Genetics. 1988; 120: 909-922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Kodaki T. Yamashita S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15428-15435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When ethanolamine (Etn) and choline (Cho) are present, PtdEtn and PtdCho are synthesized via the Kennedy pathways that use CDP-ethanolamine and CDP-choline intermediates. PtdEtn derived from the Kennedy pathway can also be methylated to form PtdCho (6Carman G.M. Henry S.A. Prog. Lipid. Res. 1999; 38: 361-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Phosphoethanolamine, an intermediate in the Kennedy pathway, can also be synthesized as a consequence of sphingolipid degradation (7Saba J.D. Nara F. Bielawska A. Garrett S. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26087-26090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 8Storey M.K. Clay K.L. Kutateladze T. Murphy R.C. Overduin M. Voelker D.J. J. Biol.

Monomethylethanolamine (Etn(Me)) and dimethylethanolamine (Etn(Me)2) can also be assimilated into PtdEtn(Me) and PtdEtn(Me)2, respectively, via the Kennedy pathways. Yeast mutants (pem1 pem2Δ) lacking the methyltransferase enzymes cannot make N-methylated phospholipids by the de novo pathway. The growth defect of these mutants can be rescued by choline, Etn(Me)2, or Etn(Me) but not by Etn (4Summers E.F. Letts V.A. McGraw P. Henry S.A. Genetics. 1988; 120: 909-922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These findings have led to the conclusions that some form of methylated PtdEtn is essential for yeast growth (1Howe A.G. McMaster C.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1534: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 4Summers E.F. Letts V.A. McGraw P. Henry S.A. Genetics. 1988; 120: 909-922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test if PtdCho and N-methylated lipids are critical for cell viability, we examined whether propanolamine (Prn), an ethanolamine analogue, could rescue the growth defect of methylation-defective mutant strains. Previous research showed that yeast mutants (psd1Δ psd2Δ) lacking PtdSer decarboxylases require Cho or Etn for growth but can also grow on Prn (8Storey M.K. Clay K.L. Kutateladze T. Murphy R.C. Overduin M. Voelker D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48539-48548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Mutant strains supplemented with Prn accumulate a novel lipid, phosphatidylpropanolamine (PtdPrn). PtdPrn can comprise up to 40% of the total phospholipid content in Prn-supplemented cells, at the expense of PtdCho and PtdEtn. In Prn-supplemented cells with psd1Δ psd2Δ mutations, the PtdCho content was reduced from 38 to 10% total phospholipid, and the PtdEtn content was reduced to 1% of total phospholipid. This result suggests that with appropriate genetic manipulation PtdPrn might be able to replace the entire PtdCho and PtdEtn pools. Under physiological conditions, unsaturated PtdCho, PtdSer, and PtdIns all form bilayers when hydrated, but PtdEtn and PtdPrn form a hexagonal phase in vitro (8Storey M.K. Clay K.L. Kutateladze T.

These hexagonal phase structures have been proposed to be important for protein translocation, membrane fluidity, and membrane fusion events (11Yeagle P.L. FASEB J. 1989; 3: 1833-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 12Cullis P.R. Fenske D.B. Hope M.J. Vance D.E. Vance J.E. Biochemistry of Lipids, Lipoproteins and Membranes. 31.

In this study we applied genetic and biochemical approaches to determine whether: 1) PtdCho and its N-methylated phospholipid precursors could be eliminated from cells without loss of viability; 2) PtdCho could also be eliminated for growth on both a fermentable carbon source (glucose) and a nonfermentable carbon source (requiring functional mitochondria); and 3) PtdCho depletion was accompanied by a shift to more saturated species of primary amine-containing phospholipids. The results demonstrate that PtdCho and N-methylated phospholipids are nonessential in yeast and are not required for mitochondrial function. Construction of Methylation-defective Strains—Deletion mutants for the PEM2 gene were generated by homologous recombination in the RYY52 strain (Matα, trp1, lys2, ura3, leu2, his3, suc2, psd1Δ-1::TRP1) (14Wu W.I. Routt S. Bankaitis V.A. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14446-14456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) by transformation with PCR products harboring a KanMX sequence. These PCR products were made by using primers identical to a 24-nucleotide sequence, 541 bp upstream of PEM2, and a 22-nucleotide sequence, 545 bp downstream of PEM2. Chromosomal DNA templates for the PCR were prepared from a pem2Δ strain (Research Genetics, Inc.) in which the entire PEM2 coding sequence was deleted and replaced by KanMX. The resulting psd1Δ pem2Δ strain was isolated by selection for G418 resistance. Correct replacement of PEM2 by the KanMX sequence was confirmed by PCR analysis using primers outside of the target sequence and a primer specific to the KanMX sequence. Disruption of the PEM1 gene was accomplished by homologous recombination of the psd1Δ pem2Δ strain using transformation with PCR products containing a 3.2-kb pem1::LEU2 cassette. The pem1::LEU2 module was amplified by PCR from the pem1 disruption strain ESXI-1(4d) obtained from Dr. Susan Henry (Cornell University). The disruption of the PEM1 gene was verified by PCR using one primer within LEU2 and the other outside of the target locus. Strains with a functional Psd1p were generated from pem1 pem2Δ psd1 mutant strains by transformation with a YCp50-PSD1 plasmid. Growth Measurement of Lipid Methylation-defective Strains—The methylation-defective strains (pem1::LEU2 pem2Δ::KanMX or pem1::LEU2 pem2Δ::KanMX psd1Δ::TRP1) were pre-grown at 30 °C on synthetic complete medium plates containing Prn (20 mm) to dilute out cellular PtdCho. The cells were next inoculated into synthetic complete lactate or glucose medium and washed twice with the same medium. Cells were re-inoculated at an A600 of 0.005 in synthetic glucose or 0.02 in synthetic lactate medium plus or minus 20 mm Etn, 20 mm Prn, or 2 mm Cho. Cell growth at 30 °C was monitored by culture absorbance at 600 nm. Lipid Phosphorus Measurement—Lipid methylation-defective strains were grown to mid-log phase at 30 °C in synthetic glucose or semi-synthetic lactate (2% lactate and 0.05% glucose) media plus Prn (20 mm) or Cho (2 mm). The cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed twice with water. Mitochondria were prepared as described previously (15Glick B.S. Pon L.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). The lipids were extracted from whole cells and mitochondria as described previously (16Trotter P.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6062-6070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The phospholipids were separated by two-dimensional TLC on Silica 60 plates using chloroform/methanol/ammonium hydroxide (65:35:5, v/v/v) followed by chloroform/acetic acid/methanol/water (75:25:5:2.2, v/v/v). Lipids were visualized with iodine vapor and quantified by measuring phosphorus (17Rouser G. Siakatos A.N. Fleischer S. Lipids. 1966; 1: 85-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1318) Google Scholar). The results are shown as the percentage of total lipid phosphorus in each phospholipid fraction. Data are means ± S.D. for two or three independent experiments. Mass Spectrometry—Lipids extracted from the cells grown in synthetic complete medium with glucose plus Prn (20 mm) or Cho (2 mm) were separated by two-dimensional TLC as described above. Lipid spots corresponding to PtdPrn, PtdEtn, or PtdCho were scraped into glass tubes and extracted from the silica gel by the method of Bligh and Dyer (18Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42855) Google Scholar). Samples dissolved in methanol were analyzed with a PE Sciex API 3000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer configured to perform multiple experiments during a single flow injection and by using electrospray ionization. Tandem mass spectrometry was performed in the positive ion mode with a first scan event corresponding to the detection of all precursor ions for m/z 184.3, an ion diagnostic for individual molecular species of PtdCho (19Pulfer M. Murphy R.C. Mass Spectrom. Rev. 2003; 22: 332-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). The next scan event involved configuring the tandem mass spectrometer to detect the loss of 141.1 daltons, a neutral loss characteristic of the PtdEtn molecular species (20Kayganich K.A. Murphy R.C. Anal. Chem. 1992; 64: 2965-2971Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The next scan event detected the neutral loss of 155.1 daltons indicative of PtdPrn molecular species, as the homologous ion to the constant neutral loss of 141 for PtdEtn. The instrument next acquired a full mass spectrum of positive ions from m/z 650–850. The final scan event was in the negative ion mode scanning the mass range from m/z 650–850. In separate experiments phospholipid classes were separated by TLC, eluted from the silica gel, and examined by full scan negative ion flow injection analysis. Anions present in the negative ion full scan were further analyzed in the subsequent injection of the sample for collision-induced dissociation of [M - H]- or [M - 15]- in order to determine the individual fatty acyl components present in each molecular species, using conditions described previously (21Uhlson C. Harrison K. Allen C.B. Ahmad S. White C.W. Murphy R.C. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2002; 15: 896-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We also conducted experiments to rule out the possibility that the Prn used in these studies was contaminated by Cho. The Prn was analyzed by electrospray mass spectrometry that was sensitive for both the presence of Prn ([M + H]+, m/z 76) as well as Cho ([M + H]+, m/z 104). There was no evidence for the occurrence of Cho in the commercial Prn at a level less than 1 ppm as evidenced by a lack of any ion at m/z 104 when the signal for m/z 76 was 4.4 × 105 intensity units. An equal quantity of choline analyzed after the propanolamine generated 3.2 × 106 intensity units, thus having a higher detectability as expected for this quaternary amine. Prn Supplementation of Methylation-defective Mutants Supports Growth on Glucose and Completely Depletes PtdCho—Methylation-defective strains that have deletion/disruption in PEM1 and PEM2 genes cannot make PtdCho and N-methylated lipids (4Summers E.F. Letts V.A. McGraw P. Henry S.A. Genetics. 1988; 120: 909-922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These mutant cells were grown in the presence of Prn to enable them to make PtdPrn via the Kennedy pathway as shown in Fig. 2. The mutant strains grew on minimal glucose agar media supplemented with Prn. However, when lipids extracted from these cultures were separated by two-dimensional TLC and stained with iodine vapor, there was a minor spot in the PtdCho region. This minor component was identified as PtdCho by mass spectrometry. Quantification of this PtdCho demonstrated that it comprised 2–3% of total phospholipids (data not shown). Consistent with previous findings (8Storey M.K. Clay K.L. Kutateladze T. Murphy R.C. Overduin M. Voelker D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48539-48548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), this result demonstrates marked reduction of PtdCho can occur without affecting cell viability. These data also reveal that trace amounts of choline can be derived from agar plates. Because our goal was to deplete all PtdCho and N-methylated precursors from these yeast strains, all subsequent growth analyses were performed in liquid media. In liquid medium, yeast mutants (pem1 pem2Δ) lacking the methyltransferase enzymes cannot make N-methylated phospholipids. The growth defect of the mutants can be rescued by choline, Etn(Me)2, or Etn(Me) but not by Etn. To examine further whether PtdCho and N-methylated lipids are critical for cell viability, we investigated the growth of the lipid methylation-defective mutant strain on minimal glucose media supplemented either with Etn, Prn, Cho, or no phospholipid precursor (Fig. 3). Unsupplemented cultures or those receiving Etn failed to support growth of the mutant strain. As expected, the strain grew normally when supplied with Cho. In the presence of Prn the cultures grew with a pronounced lag but reached nearly the same saturation level obtained with Cho supplementation. Lipids extracted from the cells grown on either Cho or Prn medium were separated by two-dimensional TLC (Fig. 4A). In the presence of Cho, PtdCho was recovered as the major phospholipid. In the absence of Cho but the presence of Prn, the lipid composition of the lipid methylation-defective mutant showed dramatic changes. The PtdCho spot disappeared, and a novel lipid, PtdPrn, was detected. Quantification of each lipid extracted from the TLC plates also confirmed the above observation (Fig. 4B). PtdCho was reduced to the limits of detection. The PtdIns pool more than doubled, and PtdPrn accounted for 30% of the total phospholipid. Furthermore, with Prn supplementation, the hexagonal phase lipids PtdEtn and PtdPrn comprised 58% of the total phospholipid. Mass Spectrometry Analysis Reveals That There Is No Marked Shift in the Degree of Unsaturation in PtdEtn and PtdPrn—The dramatic increase of total hexagonal phase lipids (PtdEtn and PtdPrn) in the mutants supplemented with Prn might result in fatty acid compositional changes to make a compensatory shift in the degree of saturation of these lipids toward more bilayer-forming species. To test this idea the individual molecular species of PtdEtn, PtdPrn, and PtdCho were analyzed by negative ion mass spectrometry. A relatively simple mixture of molecular species was found in yeast grown in the presence of choline, because only four major molecular species of PtdEtn were observed at m/z 686, 688, 714, and 716 (Fig. 5A). The identity of these molecular species was determined after collisional activation of each of these ions, which yielded the carboxylate anions corresponding to each fatty acyl substituent (Fig. 5A, inset). Collisional activation of m/z 686 generated only one carboxylate anion at m/z 253, indicative of the fatty acyl group palmitoleoyl at both sn-1 and sn-2 of this PtdEtn molecular species (16:l/16:1-PtdEtn). However, collision-induced decomposition of m/z 688 revealed a mixture of two isobaric components, the major species corresponding to 16:0/16:1-PtdEtn, but a somewhat less abundant species at the same mass corresponding to 14:0/18:1-PtdEtn was also present in the precursor [M - H]- at m/z 688.4. Similarly, analysis of m/z 714 and 716 revealed the molecular species 16:1/18:1-PtdEtn and 16:0/18:1 with somewhat smaller amounts of 18:0/16:1-PtdEtn. Abundance of the fatty acyl substituents with the corresponding phosphatidylcholine molecular species isolated from the yeast cultures was indicated by the [M-15]- ion, revealing a similar small number of molecular species with glycerophosphocholine as the polar moiety (Fig. 5B). A slightly more abundant species was observed, corresponding to 16:0/16: 1-PtdCho relative to the corresponding molecular species in the PtdEtn class. When cells were incubated with propanolamine, there was no change in the relative molecular species distribution within the phosphatidylethanolamine species either at the level of [M - H]- ion abundances or their collision-induced decomposition products (Fig. 5C). New PtdPrn molecular species were now observed at m/z 700, 702, 728, and 730 which corresponded to 16:1/16:1-PtdPrn, 16:0/16:1-PtdPrn, 16:1/18:1-PtdPrn, and 16:1/18:0-PtdPrn plus 16:0/18:1-PtdPrn, respectively (Fig. 5D). The identities of these were confirmed again by tandem mass spectrometry (inset,Fig. 5D). This direct determination of the individual molecular species and fatty acyl substituents (Fig. 5) demonstrated that the saturated fatty acyl species were not increased in the PtdPrn and PtdEtn classes of the mutant supplemented with Prn.Fig. 5Mass spectrometry analysis reveals that there is no marked shift in the degree of saturation in PtdEtn and PtdPrn when the PtdCho pool is eliminated. Lipid classes of pem1 pem2Δ mutant strains were purified by TLC, and the areas corresponding to PtdPrn, PtdEtn, or PtdCho were recovered, extracted from the silica gel, and dissolved in methanol prior to mass spectrometric analysis.

We analyzed cell growth under respiratory conditions to determine whether PtdPrn could support mitochondrial function. For this analysis, the methylation-defective mutants were grown on minimal lactate media either without supplementation or with Etn, Prn, or Cho (Fig. 6). Both unsupplemented cultures and those provided with Etn failed to support the growth of methylation-defective strains. In contrast, the mutants grew normally when supplied with Cho. In addition, after a significant lag, the mutants also grew when supplemented with Prn. Lipids extracted from the cells grown on minimal lactate medium supplemented either with Cho or Prn were separated by two-dimensional thin layer chromatography. As with glucose grown cells, the mutants grown in minimal lactate medium supplemented with Prn showed dramatic alterations in lipid composition. Quantification of phospholipids resolved on TLC plates, by phosphorus assay (Fig. 7), revealed that PtdCho levels declined precipitously, to the limits of detection. The loss of PtdCho was accompanied by a modest increase in PtdIns and the appearance of PtdPrn as greater than 20% of the total phospholipid. Under these conditions the hexagonal phase lipids PtdEtn and PtdPrn accounted for more than 60% of the phospholipid pool. We also examined the consequences of the methyltransferase mutations and Prn supplementation upon the lipid composition of isolated mitochondria. The results of this analysis are shown in Fig. 8 and demonstrate that the mitochondrial phospholipid composition closely parallels that found for the whole cell. The findings clearly demonstrate that PtdCho is not essential for mitochondrial function and that the organelle can tolerate a hexagonal phase lipid content of greater than 60% of its total phospholipid. Cells Lacking PtdCho and the Ability to Synthesize Mitochondrial PtdEtn Remain Viable with Prn Supplementation on Glucose-containing Medium—Previous research (8Storey M.K. Clay K.L. Kutateladze T.

Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 997-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) has demonstrated that mitochondrial PtdEtn generated by Psd1p is critical for the respiratory growth of yeast strains. We performed experiments to test if mitochondrial PtdEtn as well as PtdCho can be replaced by PtdPrn (Fig. 9). We used triple mutant strains defective in PEM1 and PEM2 for phospholipid methylation and defective in PSD1 for PtdEtn synthesis in mitochondria. The mutation in the PSD1 gene results in a decrease in the PtdEtn pool in mitochondria. The triple mutants were grown on minimal glucose media either lacking supplements or with Etn, Prn, or Cho (Fig. 10). Cultures of the triple mutant without supplementation or with Etn failed to grow. In contrast, the strain grew normally when supplied with Cho. The strain also grew with Prn supplementation, showing a pronounced lag. The results clearly show that Prn-supplemented mutants still can grow despite genetic elimination of PtdCho synthesis and mitochondrial PtdEtn synthesis.Fig. 10Cells lacking PtdCho and with reduced mitochondrial PtdEtn remain viable with Prn supplementation in glucose medium. The pem1 pem2Δ psd1 mutant strains were pregrown at 30 °C on synthetic lactate plates containing Prn (20 mm) to dilute out cellular PtdCho. Cells were inoculated into synthetic glucose medium and washed twice with the same medium. Cells were re-inoculated at an absorbance of 0.005 in synthetic glucose either without supplements or plus 20 mm Etn, 20 mm Prn, or 2 mm Cho. Cell growth at 30 °C was monitored by A600. The data are from a representative one of four experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Lipids extracted from the cells grown on either Cho- or Prn-containing media were separated by two-dimensional TLC. When the lipids were visualized by iodine staining the triple mutant strain grown on Prn lacked detectable PtdCho and accumulated PtdPrn (Fig. 11A). In addition, the PtdIns spot appeared much more prominent in the triple mutant supplemented with Prn when compared with this strain supplemented with choline. Quantification of the phospholipids (Fig. 11B) demonstrated the elimination of PtdCho and a 4-fold increase in PtdIns, and an accumulation of PtdPrn to 33% of the total phospholipid pool. Unlike Cho-supplemented cells, the Prn-supplemented cells did not accumulate relatively high levels of PtdSer. We also isolated mitochondria from glucose-grown cells harboring pem1 pem2Δ psd1Δ mutations and quantified the phospholipids of these organelles. The results shown in Fig. 11C demonstrate that choline supplementation of the triple mutant produces mitochondria in which PtdCho is the most abundant phospholipid (44.3%), and PtdIns, PtdEtn, and PtdSer are nearly equivalent, ranging from 12 to 17% of the total phospholipids. As expected for a strain lacking Psd1p, the PtdEtn content of the organelle is reduced by 49% when compared with the level of this phospholipid in total cell membranes (see Fig. 11B). Analysis of the mitochondria derived from the triple mutant supplemented with 2 mm Prn demonstrates the organelles are devoid of PtdCho and contain PtdPrn as the most abundant phospholipid (35.2%). These mitochondria also contain relatively high levels of PtdIns (30.1%) and lower levels of PtdEtn (18.7%) and PtdSer (8%). We next sought to determine whether PtdPrn could support the growth of the triple mutant under respiratory conditions. The results of these experiments are shown in Fig. 12. Cells lacking both mitochondrial PtdCho and the pool of PtdEtn generated by Psd1p fail to grow with Prn supplementation under conditions requiring functional mitochondria. These findings demonstrate that PtdPrn is unable to fulfill both PtdCho and PtdEtn requirements for mitochondrial function during respiration. In experiments described in this report we tested the essentiality of PtdCho and other methylated forms of PtdEtn for the growth and mitochondrial function of S. cerevisiae. In many well described eukaryotes typically used for biochemical experiments, PtdCho is the most abundant phospholipid and is often assumed to be essential for membrane structure and function and cell growth (1Howe A.G. McMaster C.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1534: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 3Schneiter R. Brugger B. Sandhoff R. Zellnig G. Leber A. Lampl M. Athenstaedt K. Hrastnik C. Eder S.

FASEB J. 1989; 3: 1833-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). The results of our studies provide clear evidence that neither PtdCho, PtdEtn(Me), nor PtdEtn(Me)2 is required for either cell viability or mitochondrial function in yeast. Our general approach to examining the role of methylated forms of PtdEtn, including PtdCho, in supporting cell growth was to use the Etn analog Prn. Prn, like Etn, contains a primary amine. Previous studies have shown that Prn is readily incorporated into phospholipid in both Saccharomyces and Tetrahymena species (8Storey M.K. Clay K.L. Kutateladze T. Murphy R.C. Overduin M. Voelker D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48539-48548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 23Smith J.D. Barrows L.J. Biochem. J. 1988; 254: 301-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The physical properties of PtdPrn are similar to those of PtdEtn. Most notably, PtdPrn forms hexagonal HII phase structures. NMR studies reveal that PtdPrn has a higher propensity to form hexagonal phase structures than PtdEtn (8Storey M.K. Clay K.L. Kutateladze T. Murphy R.C. Overduin M. Voelker D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48539-48548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Although PtdPrn forms hexagonal phase structures, it cannot fully substitute for the cellular requirements for PtdEtn in yeast. In addition, in earlier studies examining PtdPrn metabolism, we demonstrated that this novel lipid replaced much of the PtdCho present in cells and simultaneously enabled cells to survive with drastically reduced levels of PtdEtn, created by mutations in PtdSer decarboxylases (8Storey M.K. Clay K.L. Kutateladze T. Murphy R.C. Overduin M. Voelker D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48539-48548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). These observations led to the initial experiments described in this study designed to test whether PtdPrn formation would be permissive for cell growth in the absence of PtdCho synthesis. The experiments described in Figs. 3 and 6 demonstrate that Prn supplementation enables strains harboring deletions in PEM1 and PEM2 genes to grow, albeit at a slower initial rate than the same cells supplemented with Cho. Analysis of the lipid composition of these cells reveals several interesting findings. Unexpectedly, cells grown on minimal agar plates lacking choline, but supplemented with Prn, are able to synthesize low levels of PtdCho. This result indicates that agar contains trace levels of Cho that the cells are able to successfully scavenge. With growth in liquid medium, no PtdCho was formed above the background levels of our assay system. These data clearly demonstrate that yeast does not require PtdCho or the mono- or di-methylated forms of PtdEtn for growth. Previous work by Summers et al. (4Summers E.F. Letts V.A. McGraw P. Henry S.A. Genetics. 1988; 120: 909-922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that yeast cells could grow moderately well with PtdEtn(Me)2 replacing PtdCho and poorly with PtdEtn(Me) replacing PtdCho but implicated a specific need for at least some methylation of PtdEtn as essential for growth. Additional work in mammalian cells also provided evidence that PtdEtn(Me)2 could support growth of mammalian cells containing greatly diminished levels of PtdCho (24Esko J.D. Nishijima M. Raetz C.R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 1698-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, the complete replacement of PtdCho and all N-methylated forms of PtdEtn by the primary amine-containing and hexagonal phase-forming PtdPrn was quite surprising. We extended these studies to more restrictive growth conditions by examining methyltransferase-defective strains under respiratory growth conditions. As with cells grown on glucose, PtdPrn formation permitted growth in the absence of PtdCho and other N-methylated phospholipids when functional mitochondria were required. These results permit a number of additional important conclusions. Most importantly, mitochondrial maturation and function does not require PtdCho or methylated PtdEtn. In addition, the analysis of mitochondrial phospholipids shown in Fig. 8 demonstrates that PtdPrn is readily incorporated into this organelle as well as other membranes. We currently have preliminary data with choline kinase and ethanolamine kinase mutants that implicate the formation of phospho-Prn and CDP-Prn in the formation of PtdPrn. These latter findings are consistent with choline phosphotransferase (25Hjelmstad R.H. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3909-3917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and ethanolaminephosphotransferase (26Hjelmstad R.H. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19748-19757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) acting as the terminal transferases in the synthesis of PtdPrn in the endoplasmic reticulum. Thus, it is highly likely that PtdPrn must be synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi (27Henneberry A.L. Wright M.M. McMaster C.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3148-3161Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) and be transported to the mitochondria. Consequently, the phospholipid transport systems that exist must be insensitive to the structural anomaly of PtdPrn. Another important finding from these experiments is that the mitochondria remain fully functional with as much as 70% of their complement of phospholipid containing primary amines. Since earlier studies (8Storey M.K. Clay K.L. Kutateladze T. Murphy R.C. Overduin M. Voelker D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48539-48548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) demonstrated that PtdPrn synthesis allowed for dramatic reduction of cellular PtdEtn content, we also tested whether PtdPrn could eliminate and replace the PtdEtn pool of mitochondria. Cells harboring the triple mutations pem1 pem2Δ psd1Δ are unable to synthesize PtdCho by methyltransferase action and mitochondrial PtdEtn by Psd1p action. In glucose medium these mutant strains grow with a pronounced lag but reach normal levels of saturation when supplemented with Prn. As expected, PtdPrn replaced PtdCho, and the presence of the psd1Δ mutation had little effect upon total cellular PtdEtn content. In psd1Δ strains grown without Etn, PtdEtn formation depends mostly upon the activity of Psd2p and to a lesser extent upon the breakdown of sphingolipids and the action of Dpl1p (7Saba J.D. Nara F. Bielawska A. Garrett S. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26087-26090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 8Storey M.K. Clay K.L. Kutateladze T. Murphy R.C. Overduin M. Voelker D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48539-48548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). However, PtdEtn formation and content in the mitochondria is also dependent upon the catalysis performed by Psd1p. Shifting the triple mutant cells to lactate as the carbon source requires that they possess functional mitochondria for growth. The growth curve shown in Fig. 12 reveals that the triple mutant cannot grow with Prn supplementation but can grow with Cho supplementation. Thus PtdPrn can replace mitochondrial PtdCho only when there is adequate PtdEtn present in the organelle. The PtdPrn appears unable to replace both PtdCho and PtdEtn pools within the mitochondria. These findings are consistent with other observations indicating that PtdEtn plays an essential role in mitochondrial membrane structure and function during respiration (8Storey M.K. Clay K.L. Kutateladze T. Murphy R.C. Overduin M. Voelker D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48539-48548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 22Birner R. Burgermeister M. Schneiter R. Daum G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 997-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In all conditions described in this report, the supplementation of cells with Prn resulted in elevated levels of PtdIns when compared with cells supplemented with Cho. This consistent finding was most pronounced when analyzing the phospholipids of the pem1 pem2Δ psd1Δ triple mutant. The elevation of membrane PtdIns content may reflect the biophysical need to replace some of the eliminated PtdCho with the bilayer forming PtdIns to counteract the propensity of PtdPrn and PtdEtn to form nonbilayer structures (8Storey M.K. Clay K.L. Kutateladze T. Murphy R.C. Overduin M. Voelker D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48539-48548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In summary, this work demonstrates that it is possible to alter dramatically the phospholipid composition of yeast and its mitochondria with a combination of genetic and biochemical manipulations. PtdCho, the major lipid of many eukaryotes, can be eliminated along with other N-methylated forms of PtdEtn, indicating that these phospholipids are nonessential. The dispensability of PtdCho is true under both respiratory and nonrespiratory growth conditions."

The x-ray structures for the α subunits of transducin (αT) and other G proteins suggest that the nucleotide-binding (Ras-like) domain and a large helical domain form a “clam shell” that buries the GDP molecule. Thus, receptor-promoted G protein activation may involve “opening the clam shell” to facilitate GDP dissociation. In this study, we have examined whether perturbing the linker regions connecting the Ras-like and helical domains of Gα subunits gives rise to a more readily exchangeable state. The sole glycine residues in linkers 1 and 2 were individually changed to proline residues within an αT/αi1 chimera (designated αT*). Both αT* linker mutants showed significant increases in their basal rates of GDP-GTP exchange when compared either to retinal αT or recombinant αT*. The αT* linker mutants were responsive to aluminum fluoride, which binds to α-GDP complexes and induces changes in Switch 2. Although both linker mutants were further activated by light-activated rhodopsin together with the βγ complex, their activation was not influenced by βγ alone, arguing against the idea that the βγ complex helps to pry apart the helical and Ras-like domains of Gα subunits. Once activated, the αT* linker mutants were able to stimulate the cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase. Overall, these findings highlight a new class of activated Gα mutants that constitutively exchange GDP for GTP and should prove valuable in studying different G protein-signaling systems.

Overall, these findings highlight a new class of activated Gα mutants that constitutively exchange GDP for GTP and should prove valuable in studying different G protein-signaling systems. The visual phototransduction cascade in retinal rod outer segments consists of the heterotrimeric G protein, transducin, its upstream receptor rhodopsin and its downstream effector, cGMP-phosphodiesterase (PDE). 1The abbreviations used are: PDE, cGMP-phosphodiesterase; GTPγS, guanosine-5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate); R*, light-activated rhodopsin. 1The abbreviations used are: PDE, cGMP-phosphodiesterase; GTPγS, guanosine-5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate); R*, light-activated rhodopsin. This is a highly sensitive system, capable of detecting and being activated by a single photon of light, which excites the seven-membrane spanning receptor, rhodopsin. Upon the absorption of light, rhodopsin is activated through the photoisomerization of the chromophore, retinal, which is attached through a Schiff base linkage to the seventh membrane-spanning helix of the protein. Light-activated rhodopsin binds and activates the α subunit of transducin (αT) by stimulating its GDP-GTP exchange reaction. Activated GTP-bound αT then stimulates PDE activity by altering the positions of its regulatory γ subunits (γPDE) and thereby allowing the α and β catalytic subunits (αPDE and βPDE) to hydrolyze and consequently decrease cellular cGMP concentrations. This causes cation-specific cGMP-gated ion channels in the outer segments to close, leading to the hyperpolarization of rod outer segment membranes and the generation of the visual response. There is an amplification of the signal at every step of this cascade such that a single photon of light can lead to the inhibition of 106-107 Na+ ions from entering the rod cell.Members of the family of large G proteins are made up of three distinct subunits: α (39-46 kDa), β (37 kDa), and γ (8 kDa), with the β and γ subunits being in a tightly associated complex, under all nondenaturing conditions. The N-terminal region of Gα subunits, together with the C-terminal region of Gγ subunits, have lipid modifications and are involved in membrane attachment (1Wittinghofer A. Cell. 1994; 76: 201-204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 2Hepler J.R. Gilman A.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 383-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar, 3Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 669-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar). G proteins are inactive and unable to propagate signals when their α subunits are in the GDP-bound state. They become activated by receptor-catalyzed guanine-nucleotide exchange, resulting in the dissociation of GDP and the binding of GTP to the Gα subunit. This leads to dissociation of the βγ complex from the GTP-bound Gα subunit, freeing both the Gα and βγ subunits to engage downstream effectors. Thus, in a sense, the γ phosphate of GTP acts as a molecular switch that relays information in the form of a conformational change. The rate-limiting step for G protein activation is GDP release. Compared with other large G proteins, including close family members (Gαi1), the retinal G protein transducin has an extremely low basal nucleotide exchange rate, although it undergoes a very rapid receptor-catalyzed nucleotide exchange reaction (4Muradov K.G. Artemyev N.O. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3937-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The low level of background noise exhibited by transducin in the absence of a signal from light-activated rhodopsin is consistent with its role in visual phototransduction, where low biochemical noise levels and extremely tight regulation of signaling are required.One of the fundamentally important, but still unanswered, questions regarding the mechanism of G protein function is to understand the structural and molecular changes that need to occur within the α subunits (Gα) to activate them for signal propagation. The overall importance of G protein activation is demonstrated by the severe biological consequences ranging from developmental disorders to malignant transformation that can occur when heptahelical receptors or their G protein targets become hyperactive as an outcome of mutagenesis. Both the guanine nucleotide exchange and GTP hydrolytic activities of G proteins need to be tightly regulated, because the loss of regulation can have dire biological consequences. For example, point mutations in the Gαs subunit that accelerate GDP dissociation (A366S) or inhibit GTP binding to a nucleotide-depleted protein (R231H) give rise to an endocrine disorder (testotoxicosis) and to Type I pseudohypoparathyroidism, respectively (5Iiri T. Farfel Z. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1998; 394: 35-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar).A particularly interesting and perhaps puzzling feature of the activation mechanism of large G proteins is the observation that the heptahelical G protein-coupled receptors do not seem to directly contact either the nucleotide-binding site or the bound nucleotide (6Onrust R. Herzmark P. Chi P. Garcia P.D. Lichtarge O. Kingsley C. Bourne H.R. Science. 1997; 275: 381-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The x-ray crystal structures of different Gα subunits show that their helical and Ras-like GTPase domains act like a clam shell to bury the nucleotide and its associated Mg2+ ion (1Wittinghofer A. Cell. 1994; 76: 201-204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 7Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B.

These two domains are connected by linkers (in the case of αT, linker 1 consists of residues 54-58 and linker 2 includes residues 173-179) that may help to open and close the clam shell. The helical domain is thought to act as a rigid lid over the nucleotide-binding site, and hence it is believed that for a heptahelical receptor to stimulate nucleotide exchange and Gα activation, there must be a conformational change that opens the cleft (7Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1993; 366: 654-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar, 8Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B.

Nature. 1994; 372: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar).In this study, we decided to investigate the role of the two linkers in controlling the basal nucleotide exchange rate of Gα subunits. In the case of αT (and for virtually all Gα subunits), each of the linkers has a single glycine residue; Gly56 in linker 1 and Gly179 in linker 2. Each glycine was mutated to a proline in the background of an αT/αi1 chimera that contains wild-type αT residues except in the Switch 3 domain (see “Experimental Procedures”). This chimera, designated from here on as αT*, was used because unlike wild-type αT, it can be readily expressed and purified from Escherichia coli. The assumption was that the Gly → Pro substitutions would decrease the flexibility and consequently increase the rigidity of the linkers. Our results indicate that both αT* linker mutants show constitutive nucleotide exchange in the absence of light-activated receptor and full stimulation of PDE activity and thereby represent a novel class of dominant-active Gα subunits.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESSite-directed Mutagenesis—Sense and antisense oligonucleotide primers were synthesized with the desired mutated base in the center of the primer. The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to carry out the PCR-based mutagenesis on miniprep plasmid DNA. The parental DNA template was digested using DpnI endonuclease and the nicked vector DNA with the desired mutation was transformed into Epicurian Coli XL-1 Blue supercompetent cells. DNA was purified from single colonies using the Qiagen plasmid miniprep kit. The DNA was sequenced at the Bio Resource Center of Cornell University.Construction of the αT*Chimera—The αT subunit, when expressed in E. coli, is not functional, whereas Gαi1 is fully functional. There are several αi1 and αT chimeras available, that can be expressed in E. coli and bind guanine nucleotides similar to bovine retinal αT but are unable to stimulate the PDE (12Skiba N.P. Bae H. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). We have used a construct designated pHis6Chi6 that was obtained from Prof. Heidi Hamm at Vanderbilt University. This chimera, which has the corresponding region from αi1 inserted between residues 215 and 294 of αT, is unable to stimulate PDE activity, although it is capable of binding to the γPDE subunit in a GTP-dependent manner. The mutation of residues 244 (Lys → His) and 247 (Asp → Asn) to the original residues in αT restores the ability to stimulate PDE activity to about 50% of the levels obtained with retinal αT. From here on, the αT/αi1 chimera (previously known as Chi6) that contains these mutations at positions 244 and 247 will be referred to as αT*. The linker mutations described in this study have been made in the αT* background. Thus, the Gα subunits containing the glycine to proline substitutions in the linker regions are designated as αT* (G56P) and αT* (G179P).Protein Expression and Purification—The recombinant αT* and the αT* linker mutants were expressed in BL21(DE3) supercompetent cells and purified in the presence of 50 μm GDP as described in Ref. 12Skiba N.P.

In a typical assay, αT* was preincubated with βγ, light-activated rhodopsin (R*), GTPγS, and PDE in a buffer containing 5 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 2 mm MgCl2, and 100 mm NaCl, at room temperature and in room light for 30 min. The reaction was initiated by addition of the substrate, cGMP, to a final concentration of 5 mm, and the change in pH was monitored over time.GTP Hydrolysis Assays—Rhodopsin, αT*-GDP, and βγ were incubated in HMN buffer for 20 min at room temperature and in room light. The assays were initiated by the addition of [γ-32P]GTP (final concentration, 0.5 μm; specific activity, 13 Ci/mmol). Aliquots (40 μl) were removed at specific time points and added to 1 ml of 5% activated charcoal (neutralized) in 50 mm NaH2PO4. The samples were centrifuged at high speed, and then 100 μl of supernatant was added to scintillation fluid and counted in a scintillation counter (LS6500 Multipurpose Scintillation counter).Fluorescence Measurements—The binding of aluminum fluoride ( AlF4−) as well as GTPγS was measured by monitoring the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of αT* upon excitation at 300 nm and emission at 345 nm (18Faurobert E. Otto-Bruc A. Chardin P. Chabre M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4191-4198Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 19Sternweis P.C. Gilman A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 4888-4891Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). In a typical experiment, 300 nm αT* (as determined by [35S]GTPγS binding activity) was preincubated in HM buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2) at room temperature. In the AlF4− binding assays, fluorescence enhancement was read until saturation after the addition of AlF4− (the AlF4− complex was formed by mixing 5 mm NaF and 30 μm AlCl3). When comparing the effects at 25 and 35 °C, αT* was preincubated at the particular temperature, and the change in fluorescence emission was monitored after the addition of GTPγS. The measurements were made using a Varian eclipse spectrofluorimeter.RESULTSThe Linker Mutants Exhibit Receptor-independent Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Activity—The x-ray crystal structure of αT shows that its helical domain and Ras-like GTPase domain may act like a clam shell to bury the bound guanine nucleotide (Fig. 1 and Refs. 1Wittinghofer A. Cell. 1994; 76: 201-204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar and 7Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1993; 366: 654-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). These domains are connected by two linkers (linker 1, residues 54-58, and linker 2, residues 173-179). The helical domain is thought to cover the guanine nucleotide-binding site, such that for a heptahelical receptor (e.g. rhodopsin) to stimulate nucleotide exchange and Gα activation, there must be a conformational change that opens the cleft (7Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1993; 366: 654-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar, 8Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B.

Nature. 1994; 372: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Thus, we asked whether by perturbing the juxtaposition of the helical domain relative to the Ras-like GTPase domain and thereby opening the cleft between them, can we generate a Gα subunit that mimics the receptor-promoted activated state? In particular, we suspected that the linkers connecting the two domains of Gα subunits may help to open and close the clam shell and thus control the basal nucleotide exchange rate. We therefore assumed that by altering the “rigidity” of the linkers, it may be possible to open the cleft between the two domains and increase the intrinsic rate of guanine nucleotide exchange on a Gα subunit (e.g. αT).Many of the residues in both linkers 1 and 2 are highly conserved among the heterotrimeric Gα subunits, suggesting that these residues may be critical for participating in or maintaining interdomain interactions. For example, each of the linkers contains a single glycine residue; Gly56 in linker 1 and Gly179 in linker 2 of αT. Glycine, being the amino acid lacking a side chain, shows the greatest conformational flexibility. Using PCR-based mutagenesis, each flexible glycine was mutated to a proline, the amino acid with the least conformational flexibility. The assumption was that the Gly → Pro substitutions would decrease the flexibility and consequently increase the rigidity of the linkers and thereby potentially trap the clam shell formed by the helical and Ras-like domains of αT in an open state. To facilitate expression in E. coli, these point mutations were prepared in the background of an αT/αi1 chimera (see “Experimental Procedures”), which we refer to as αT*.Fig. 2 shows the results of [35S]GTPγS binding assays that led us to conclude that the linker mutants can indeed exchange nucleotide without receptor. The αT* subunit showed the expected requirement of light-activated rhodopsin (R*) and the βγ complex for GDP-GTP exchange and consequent activation (Fig. 2A). Similar to what has been observed with the native retinal αT, the E. coli recombinant αT* subunit shows little detectable nucleotide exchange in the absence of R* and βγ, and only relatively weak exchange activity when incubated with either R* or βγ, alone. On the other hand, the αT*(G56P) (Fig. 2B) and αT*(G179P) (Fig. 2C) mutants exhibited significant nucleotide exchange when assayed in the absence of R* and βγ, although in both cases, the rate of nucleotide exchange was further enhanced in the presence of R* and βγ. For the conditions shown in Fig. 2, we determined the following pseudo-first order rate constants for αT*, αT*(G56P), and αT*(G179P) in the presence of rhodopsin and βγ: 0.22 ± 0.03 min-1 ( αT*), 0.19 ± 0.04 min-1 ( αT*(G56P)), and 0.10 ± 0.001 min-1 ( αT*(G179P)), respectively. The corresponding rate constants in the absence of rhodopsin and βγ were 0.04 ± 0.02 and 0.025 ± 0.006 min-1 for αT*(G56P) and αT*(G179P), respectively, whereas the binding of GTPγS to αT*, in the absence of rhodopsin and βγ, was too slow to measure accurately.Fig. 2Receptor-independent [35S]GTPγS binding by the αT* linker mutants. The αT* (A), αT*(G56P) (B), and αT*(G179P) (C) subunits (700 nm each as measured by [35S]GTPγS binding activity) were preincubated in the presence or absence of 700 nm βγ and in the presence or absence of 20 nm R* (solubilized in 0.01% dodecyl maltoside), in a total volume of 150 μl of HMDN buffer for 20 min at room temperature and in room light. The labeling mixture (150 μl), containing a final concentration of 5 μm [35S]GTPγS (specific activity, 1 Ci/mmol), was added to initiate the reaction, and 20-μl aliquots of the reaction mixture were added directly to prewetted nitrocellulose filters on a suction manifold to quench the reaction. The filters were subsequently washed twice with HMN buffer and added to 3 ml of scintillation liquid and counted. [35S]GTPγS binding activities (as a percentage of maximum; in all cases, this represented 14 pmol of bound [35S]GTPγS) are plotted against time (minutes). ○, with R* and without βγ; ▵, without R* and without βγ; □, with R* and with βγ; ▿, without R* and with βγ.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 3 compares the rates of receptor-independent GDPGTPγS exchange for αT*, αT*(G56P) and αT*(G179P), as assayed by the real time changes in the fluorescence of Trp207, which accompanies the GTP-induced “activating conformational change” within the Switch 2 domain. At room temperature (25 °C), a very slow enhancement in the Trp207 fluorescence of αT* occurred upon the addition of GTPγS to the cuvette, similar to the results obtained with the native retinal αT subunit (Fig. 3, right panel). However, both the αT*(G56P) and αT*(G179P) mutants exhibited a significantly enhanced rate of change in Trp207 fluorescence, reflecting a much more rapid GDP-GTPγS exchange reaction. The same was true when comparing these fluorescence changes at 35 °C. Although under these conditions, the basal rate of nucleotide exchange activity for αT* was higher than that measured at room temperature, as well as being greater than the basal rate of GDP-GTPγS exchange for retinal αT as reported earlier (12Skiba N.P. Bae H. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), the corresponding rates for nucleotide exchange on the αT* linker mutants were still significantly greater than that of αT* (Fig. 3, left panel). Taken together, the results presented in Figs. 2 and 3 demonstrate that perturbing the regions that link the helical and Ras-like domains of αT do indeed give rise to constitutive GDP-GTP exchange activity.Fig. 3Temperature dependence of nucleotide exchange. The retinal αT and the recombinant αT*, αT*(G56P) and αT*(G179P) subunits (300 nm each as measured by [35S]GTPγS binding activity) were preincubated in HM buffer at 25 °C or 35 °C. GTPγS (final concentration, 24 μm) was added, and the change in the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of the different αT subunits (excitation, 280 nm; emission, 340 nm) was monitored in real time until saturation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Both the αT*(G56P)and αT*(G179P)Mutants Respond to AlF4−—G protein α subunits, when in the GDP-bound state, undergo an activating conformational change upon the formation of a Gα-GDP-AlF4−-complex (18Faurobert E.

A. 1982; 79: 4888-4891Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Similar to the case for GTPγS-induced activation of αT (shown in Fig. 3), the AlF4−-promoted activation event, which requires the presence of GDP in the nucleotide-binding site, can be monitored in real time by changes in Trp207 fluorescence. The AlF4−-induced enhancement of the Trp207 fluorescence of αT* occurs within seconds (Fig. 4). The αT*(G56P) mutant shows virtually identical kinetics for the AlF4−-induced conformational change as that observed for αT*, whereas the αT*(G179P) mutant shows a similar but slightly slower rate for the corresponding AlF4−-induced change. Overall, these results indicate that the nucleotide-binding pocket of the αT* linker mutants is not empty following their expression and purification but rather contains bound GDP, as is required for the binding of AlF4−. The AlF4−-induced changes in Trp207 fluorescence also verify that these linker mutants are capable of undergoing the necessary structural changes in Switch 2 that normally accompany the activation event.Fig. 4Aluminum fluoride-induced activation of αT* and the αT* linker mutants. The αT*, αT*(G56P), and αT*(G179P) subunits were preincubated in 1 ml of HM buffer at room temperature. A premixed aliquot (20 μl) containing 250 mm NaF and 150 μm AlCl3 was added, and the enhancement in intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence (excitation, 300 nm; emission, 345 nm) was monitored in real time.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)βγ Dependence—In the absence of receptor, the rate of nucleotide exchange for the αT* linker mutants shows little dependence on the concentration of βγ. The exact role that the βγ complex of transducin plays in the rhodopsin-stimulated nucleotide exchange reaction is still debatable. The βγ subunit complex has been shown to increase the affinity of αT for rhodopsin (20Phillips W.J. Wong S.C. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17040-17046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and in this way may work together with the photoreceptor to stimulate GDP dissociation and nucleotide exchange (21Fung B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10495-10502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been proposed that receptors use the βγ subunit complex as a lever to pull a flexible lip of Gα subunits (comprised of Switch 1 and the β3/α2 loop) away from its normal position of blocking an exit from the nucleotide-binding site, thereby setting the stage for the release of GDP (5Iiri T.

However, the mechanism(s) by which autocrine TGF-β functions to inhibit cell growth and suppress tumor progression has not been addressed. We utilized a unique experimental system, HCT116 cells, TGF-β RII-transfected cells (designated RII Cl 37), and chromosome 3-transfected cells (designated HCT116Ch3) to elucidate the mechanisms of cell cycle regulation by autocrine and exogenous TGF-β. As reported previously, HCT116 cells had no autocrine TGF-β activity and no inhibitory response to exogenous TGF-β as a result of mutational inactivation of TGF-β RII, whereas RII Cl 37 cells exhibited autocrine negative TGF-β activity after expression of wild type TGF-β RII cDNA (49Wang J.

However, responsiveness to growth inhibition by exogenous TGF-β was not restored in RII Cl 37 cells. The RII-transfected cells showed reduced tumorigenicity relative to NEO-transfected control cells (49Wang J. Sun L.-Z. Myeroff L. Wang X.-F. Gentry L.E. Yang J. Liang J. Zborowska E. Markowitz S.

In contrast, HCT116Ch3 cells that had regained wild type TGF-β RII from chromosome 3 showed restored responsiveness to both autocrine and exogenous TGF-β (54Miyafuji Y. Zhong X. Uchida I. Koi M. Hemmi H. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 187: 356-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In this report, we show that autocrine TGF-β induced p21 expression, which resulted in markedly reduced CDK2 activity and prolonged growth arrest in RII Cl 37 cells in contrast to HCT116Ch3 cells in which autocrine TGF-β increased p21 expression, whereas exogenous TGF-β treatment led to decreased CDK4 expression and reduced pRb phosphorylation in association with growth inhibition. These results indicate that autocrine TGF-β regulates the cell cycle through a pathway different from exogenous TGF-β in the sense that autocrine TGF-β saturates the more sensitive p21 pathway at a relatively low level of receptor occupation. Although this saturation could occur through exogenous TGF-β treatment if autocrine TGF-β were absent, the occupation of additional receptors by exogenous TGF-β leads to the induction of a second, less sensitive pathway involving the inhibition of CDK4 expression and Rb phosphorylation. Cell Culture—The RII Cl 37 cells were obtained by transfection of wild type TGF-β RII cDNA into HCT116 human colon carcinoma cells, whereas NEO pool cells were generated by transfection of a control plasmid as described previously (49Wang J. Sun L.-Z. Myeroff L. Wang X.-F. Gentry L.E. Yang J. Liang J. Zborowska E. Markowitz S. Willson J.K.V. Brattain M.G. J. Biol.

The HCT116Ch3 and HCT116Chr2 cells were obtained by transferring normal human chromosomes 3 and 2 into HCT116 cells, respectively, as described by Koi et al. (55Koi M. Umar A. Chauhan D.P. Cherian S. Carethers J.M. Kunkel T. Boland C.R. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4308-4312PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in McCoy's 5A serum-free medium (Sigma) supplemented with pyruvate, vitamins, amino acids, antibiotics, 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, 20 μg/ml insulin, and 4 μg/ml transferrin (56Boyd D.

Cell Proliferation and Flow Cytometry—Growth curves were generated by plating NEO pool and RII Cl 37 cells at a sparse density (5 × 104 cells/well) in 6-well cell culture plates and measuring DNA synthesis every day after initiation of culture, as described previously (50Wang J. Han W. Zborowska E. Liang J. Wang X.-F. Willson J.K.V. Sun L.-Z. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17366-17371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were labeled with 51 Ci/mmol [3H]thymidine (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h. DNA was then precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid and solubilized in 0.2 m NaOH. The amount of [3H]thymidine incorporated into DNA was analyzed by liquid scintillation counting in a Beckman LS7500 scintillation counter. To study the effects of TGF-β1-neutralizing antibody on cell proliferation, NEO pool and RII Cl 37 cells were plated at a low density (5 × 103 cells/well) in 24-well tissue culture plates. TGF-β1-neutralizing antibody or normal chicken IgG (R&D system) was added to the medium at a concentration of 30 μg/ml. [3H]Thymidine incorporation was measured on days 4 and 5 as described above. Inhibition of [3H]thymidine incorporation in HCT116Ch3 cells by exogenous TGF-β was determined as described previously (51Wu S.P. Theodorescu D. Kerbel R. Willson J.K.V. Mulder K.M. Humphrey L.E.

Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 115-123PubMed Google Scholar) using a standard DNA synthesis assay. Cells for flow cytometry analysis were prepared from cultures in 6-well plates as described above and harvested on days 3-5. The cells were trypsin treated, washed, and stained for DNA by resuspending them in stain solution I (50 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma), 3% polyethylene glycol, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 4 mm sodium citrate) with 40 μg/ml RNase A, followed by incubation for 30 min at 37 °C. Equal volumes of stain solution II (50 μg/ml propidium iodide, 3% polyethylene glycol, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 400 mm sodium chloride) were added to the samples, which were then stored at 4 °C for at least 1 h before being analyzed on a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Cell cycle compartments were analyzed using a ModFit LT program (Verity Software House, Inc.). Histone H1 Kinase Assay—Cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm NaVO3, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 25 μg/ml aprotinin, 25 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, and 25 μg/ml leupeptin) at 4 °C. The supernatants were cleared by centrifugation. 100 μg of fresh total cell lysates was immunoprecipitated for 2 h at 4 °C with rabbit polyclonal antibodies against CDK2 (M2, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), cyclin A (H-432, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), cyclin E (C-19, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and p21 (C-19, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), followed by incubation with immobilized protein A-agarose beads (Invitrogen) for another2hat4 °C with rotation. The beads were then washed three times with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and another three times with kinase buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 4 mm MgCl2). Phosphorylation of histone H1 was measured by incubating the beads with 10 μl of reaction mixture containing 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and 2.4 μg of histone H1 (Sigma) in kinase buffer for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by placing the samples on ice. The samples were then boiled in 2× sample buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.04% bromphenol blue, and 4% β-mercaptoethanol) for 5 min and resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE. The gel was dried and subjected to autoradiography. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—Cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 buffer as described above. The supernatants were cleared by centrifugation. Equal amounts of total cell lysates were boiled in 2× sample buffer, resolved by 12 or 15% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences) for Western blot analysis. The blots were probed with various primary antibodies at a concentration of 1 μg/ml (anti-p21, anti-CDK2, anti-cyclin A, anti-p27 (C-19, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-CDK4 (H-22, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-cyclin E (HE12, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-phospho-pRB (ser 780)), which was then followed by incubation with 0.2 μg/ml horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG or anti-mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The proteins were then detected by the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitation followed by Western blot analysis was performed to detect protein levels in the complexes. Equal amounts of total cell lysates were immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C with the various antibodies (anti-p21 and anti-CDK2 (M2-G, Santa Cruz Biotechnology)) and then incubated with immobilized protein A-agarose (for anti-p21, anti-cyclin A, and anti-cyclin E; Invitrogen) or protein G-agarose (for anti-CDK2; Invitrogen) for 1 h. The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer and boiled in 2× sample buffer for 5 min. The eluted samples were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis. RNA Analysis—RNase protection assays were performed as described previously (52Wu S.P. Sun L.Z. Willson J.K.V. Fields K. Humphrey L. Brattain M.G. Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 115-123PubMed Google Scholar) to compare mRNA expression of p21 in NEO pool and RII Cl 37 cells. The cells were plated at a low density (3.5 × 105 cells/dish) in 100-mm tissue culture dishes. Total RNA was isolated on days 3-5. The p21 antisense riboprobe plasmid was constructed by inserting a 321-bp EcoRI-ApaI fragment of the 5′-region of the human p21 cDNA into pBSK(-). After linearizing with StuI, the probe was synthesized in vitro using T7 RNA polymerase. The probe protects a 196-base fragment of p21 mRNA. The 32P-labeled probes were hybridized with 40 μg of total RNA. The hybridization mixture was then digested with RNase A and RNase T1, followed by proteinase K treatment. The protected fragments were resolved on 6% urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography. Actin mRNA protected by an actin riboprobe was used to normalize sample loading as described previously (52Wu S.P. Sun L.Z. Willson J.K.V. Fields K. Humphrey L. Brattain M.G. Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 115-123PubMed Google Scholar). Luciferase Assays—The reporter constructs of p21 promoter (p21P, p21PΔ1.1, and p21P-SmaΔ1) have been described previously (44Datto M.B. Li Y. Panus J.F. Howe D.J. Xiong Y. Wang X.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5545-5549Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). Briefly, p21P is a full-length p21 promoter, whereas p21PΔ1.1 is the p21 promoter with the p53-responsive element deleted and p21PSmaΔ1 is the control construct with the entire p21 promoter region deleted. Each of these constructs was fused to a luciferase cDNA to generate a promoter-reporter chimera. HCT116 NEO pool and RII Cl 37 cells were transiently transfected with 30 μg of one of the three reporter constructs using electroporation as described previously (49Wang J. Sun L.-Z. Myeroff L. Wang X.-F. Gentry L.E. Yang J. Liang J. Zborowska E. Markowitz S. Willson J.K.V. Brattain M.G. J. Biol.

A 10-μg β-galactosidase reporter construct was cotransfected to normalize luciferase activity to transfection efficiency. After transfection, the cells were plated on 100-mm dishes at a low density (3.5 × 105 cells/dish) and grown for 48 h. The cells were then harvested, and luciferase activity was assayed using the Luciferase Assay Systems (Promega). Luciferase activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity. Effects of Autocrine TGF-β Activity on Cell Proliferation and Growth Arrest—Growth curves of sparsely plated cells were generated to compare the growth rate of NEO pool and RII Cl 37 cells and to define operationally the lag phase of growth for each cell type. The lag phase is a period of adaptation following subculture and reseeding during which the cells build up growth promoting factors to a level to support maximal reentry into the cell cycle and consequently, exponential growth. NEO pool and RII Cl 37 cells were plated at equal clonal densities. As shown in Fig. 1, growth rates in the exponential growth phase were essentially identical for NEO pool and RII Cl 37 cells, but RII Cl 37 cells had a longer lag phase than NEO pool cells before entry into exponential phase. Treatment of RII Cl 37 cells in the lag phase by TGF-β1-neutralizing antibody led to increased [3H]thymidine incorporation (43%) relative to normal IgG-treated cells, whereas NEO pool cells did not show any response to the antibody (Fig. 2). These results indicate that autocrine negative TGF-β activity in RII Cl 37 cells antagonized the cumulative effects of positive growth factors in the lag phase, thus preventing RII Cl 37 cells from reentering the cell cycle as quickly as NEO pool cells. Flow cytometric analysis of DNA content in NEO pool and RII Cl 37 cells was then performed to confirm this observation. FACS analysis revealed that there was a lower percentage of S phase and a higher percentage of G0-G1 phase cells in RII Cl 37 than in NEO pool (Table I). On day 5, there was a 35% increase of NEO pool cells entering S phase, but there was no significant increase of the S phase cell population of RII Cl 37 over days 3 and 4. Thus, the percentage of S phase cells in NEO pool is about 1.6-fold higher than that in RII Cl 37. This indicated that RII Cl 37 cells took a longer time to reenter the cell cycle than NEO pool cells after plating at sparse densities.Fig. 2Stimulation of DNA synthesis by TGF-β1-neutralizing antibody in RII Cl 37 cells. NEO pool and RII Cl 37 cells were plated at 5,000 cells/well in 24-well plates. TGF-β1-neutralizing antibody and normal chicken IgG were added separately at a concentration of 30 μg/ml.

https://openalex.org/W2068251639,"The development of specific inhibitors for the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) family of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) has been a recent research focus because of the association of JNK with cell death in conditions such as stroke and neurodegeneration. We have demonstrated previously the presence of critical inhibitory residues within an 11-mer peptide (TI-JIP) based on the sequence of JNK-interacting protein-1 (JIP-1). However, the corresponding region of JNK bound by this JIP-1-based peptide was unknown. To identify this region, we used a novel reverse two-hybrid approach with TI-JIP as bait. We screened a library of JNK1 mutants that had been generated by random PCR mutagenesis and found three mutants of JNK1 that failed to interact with TI-JIP. The mutations in JNK1 were L131R, R309W, and Y320H. Of these mutated residues, Leu-131 and Tyr-320 were located on a common face of the JNK protein close to other residues implicated previously in the interactions of MAPKs with substrates, phosphatases, and scaffolds. To test whether these JNK1 mutants were thus affected in their regulation, we evaluated their activation in mammalian cells in response to hyperosmolarity or cotransfection with a constitutively active upstream kinase or their direct phosphorylation by either MAPK kinase (MKK)4 or MKK7. In each situation, all three JNK mutants were not activated or phosphorylated to the same level as wild-type JNK. Therefore, the results of our unbiased reverse two-hybrid screening approach have identified residues of JNK responsible for binding JIP-1-based peptides as well as MKK4 or MKK7."
https://openalex.org/W2015195697,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rad53 has crucial functions in many aspects of the cellular response to DNA damage and replication blocks. To coordinate these diverse roles, Rad53 has two forkhead-associated (FHA) phosphothreonine-binding domains in addition to a kinase domain. Here, we show that the conserved N-terminal FHA1 domain is essential for the function of Rad53 to prevent the firing of late replication origins in response to replication blocks. However, the FHA1 domain is not required for Rad53 activation during S phase, and as a consequence of defective downstream signaling, Rad53 containing an inactive FHA1 domain is hyperphosphorylated in response to replication blocks. The FHA1 mutation dramatically hypersensitizes strains with defects in the cell cycle-wide checkpoint pathways (rad9Δ and rad17Δ) to DNA damage, but it is largely epistatic with defects in the replication checkpoint (mrc1Δ). Altogether, our data indicate that the FHA1 domain links activated Rad53 to downstream effectors in the replication checkpoint. The results reveal an important mechanistic difference to the homologous Schizosaccharomyces pombe FHA domain that is required for Mrc1-dependent activation of the corresponding Cds1 kinase. Surprisingly, despite the severely impaired replication checkpoint and also G2/M checkpoint functions, the FHA1 mutation by itself leads to only moderate viability defects in response to DNA damage, highlighting the importance of functionally redundant pathways.

DNA damage, from endogenous or environmental sources, can be disastrous for cell survival and proliferation if not accurately repaired. Checkpoint pathways are vital to protect the genome as they monitor cell cycle progression and function to arrest the cell cycle in the presence of DNA damage and to activate repair. These checkpoint pathways are complex intricate signaling networks that are highly conserved among eukaryotes (reviewed in Ref. 1Zhou B.B. Elledge S.J.

Cell. 1999; 97: 621-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Cell cycle-wide DNA damage is sensed by two overlapping pathways, one involving the Rad17-Ddc1-Mec3 complex and the other involving Rad9 (16Kondo T. Matsumoto K. Sugimoto K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1136-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 17de la Torre-Ruiz M.A. Green C.M. Lowndes N.F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2687-2698Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The replication checkpoint is independent of the Rad17 and Rad9 branches, and its components (e.g. Pol2, Sgs1, Tof1, Mrc1, and Rfc5) are parts of or closely associated with the replication machinery. This facilitates a rapid response to DNA replication blocks that includes stabilization of stalled replication forks, inhibition of late origin firing, and prevention of S/M spindle elongation (reviewed in Ref. 10Foiani M. Pellicioli A. Lopes M. Lucca C. Ferrari M. Liberi G. Muzi Falconi M. Plevani P. Mutat. Res. 2000; 451: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In response to either of these pathways, Rad53 is activated through phosphorylation in a Mec1-dependent manner and then integrates these signals to activate effectors. Surprisingly, rad53Δ cells have much lower gross chromosomal rearrangement rates (27-fold increased as compared with wild type) than cells lacking Mec1 (194-fold) or another Chk2-like kinase, Dun1 (211-fold) (18Myung K. Datta A. Kolodner R.D. Cell. 2001; 104: 397-408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, it is now clear that there are additional Mec1-dependent pathways that act in parallel with Rad53, for example, involving the structurally diverse Chk1 kinase (19Sanchez Y. Bachant J. Wang H. Hu F. Liu D. Tetzlaff M. Elledge S.J. Science. 1999; 286: 1166-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar) or direct regulation of Pds1 (20Clarke D.J. Segal M. Jensen S. Reed S.I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In contrast to other Chk2-like kinases, Rad53 contains two FHA domains, the conserved N-terminal FHA1 and an additional FHA2 domain C-terminal to the kinase domain (21Hammet A. Pike B.L. Mitchelhill K.I. Teh T. Kobe B. House C.M. Kemp B.E. Heierhorst J. FEBS Lett. 2000; 471: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The FHA2 is required for the interaction of Rad53 with phosphorylated upstream Rad9 in response to DNA damage and subsequent Rad53 activation (22Sun Z. Hsiao J. Fay D.S. Stern D.F. Science. 1998; 281: 272-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 23Gilbert C.S. Green C.M. Lowndes N.F. Mol.

Cell. 2002; 9: 1055-1065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the FHA1 can also bind to phosphorylated Rad9 in vitro (25Durocher D. Henckel J. Fersht A.R. Jackson S.P. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 387-394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar); however, it is still unclear whether Rad9 is a physiological target of the FHA1 and whether the roles of the two FHA domains overlap in this respect. Other suggested binding partners for the FHA1 domain include the protein phosphatase Ptc2 (26Leroy C. Lee S.E. Vaze M.B. Ochsenbien F. Guerois R. Haber J.E. Marsolier-Kergoat M.C. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 827-835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), the Cdc7 kinase regulatory subunit Dbf4 (27Duncker B.P. Shimada K. Tsai-Pflugfelder M. Pasero P. Gasser S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16087-16092Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), the chromatin assembly factor Asf1 (28Schwartz M.F. Lee S.J. Duong J.K. Eminaga S. Stern D.F. Cell Cycle. 2003; 2: 384-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and the recently identified checkpoint target Mdt1 (29Pike B.L. Yongkiettrakul S. Tsai M.D. Heierhorst J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2779-2788Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This indicates that multiple binding partners for the FHA domains contribute to the complex functions of Rad53. We have recently shown that the FHA domains are crucial for Rad53 DNA damage checkpoint functions as a rad53-R70AR605A allele, containing disrupted phosphothreonine-binding sites in both FHA domains, displays severe hypersensitivity and greatly reduced Rad53 activation to DNA damage and replication blocks, similar to a rad53Δ strain phenotype (30Pike B.L. Yongkiettrakul S. Tsai M.D. Heierhorst J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30421-30424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In terms of requirements throughout the cell cycle, both FHA domains have specific roles during G2/M as inactivation of either FHA1 or FHA2 abolishes Rad53 activation and cell cycle arrest by the G2/M checkpoint, whereas the two FHA domains are largely redundant for Rad53 activation in asynchronous cells (30Pike B.L. Yongkiettrakul S. Tsai M.D. Heierhorst J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30421-30424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate a novel function of the FHA1 domain by showing that it is specifically required to link activated Rad53 to downstream effectors for its established function to prevent late origin firing as part of the replication checkpoint. Yeast Strains, Plasmids, and Cultures—To focus on the checkpoint function of Rad53, all mutant strains in this study were in the W303-1a background (with wild type RAD5) containing deletion of the SML1 gene to suppress viability defects of rad53 mutants (31Zhao X. Muller E.G. Rothstein R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 329-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Construction of the rad53-R70A allele has been described (32Pike B.L. Hammet A. Heierhorst J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14019-14026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). All other mutant strains were generated by standard PCR-based allele replacements with auxotrophic selection or antibiotic-resistant markers (Table I). Cultures were grown at 30 °C in 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose (YPD), except for α-factor-treated cultures, which were grown at 24 °C. pYES-PTC2 was a gift from Mary-Jane Gething and Leon Helfenbaum, University of Melbourne. For overexpression experiments, cells were grown in medium lacking uracil and containing 2% sucrose or induced in 2% sucrose + 2% galactose for 6 h.Table IYeast strains used in this studyStrainGenotypeSourceY53MATa ade2-1 can1-100 leu 2-3,112 trp1-1 ura3-1 sml1::HIS3 RAD5(31Zhao X.

For liquid assays, overnight cultures were diluted to A600 = 0.2 and grown for 3 h before the addition of MMS or HU. Aliquots removed immediately before and 3 h after MMS addition or every 2 h over a 12-h period after the addition of 100 mm HU were plated on YPD. After 3 days, survival rates were calculated as the percentage of colonies formed in damage-treated as compared with untreated samples in ≥3 independent experiments. Intra-S Phase Analyses—Cells were synchronized in G1 with two doses of 20 μg/ml α-factor over 3 h and >95% synchrony, as confirmed by phase contrast microscopy. Cells were released into 200 mm HU, and samples were removed at 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after release. To visualize replication intermediates generated by stalled replication forks, genomic DNA was subjected to denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis as described (33Santocanale C. Diffley J.F. Nature. 1998; 395: 615-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). The gel was washed twice for 20 min in neutralization buffer (1.5 m sodium chloride, 0.5 m Tris, pH 8.0), and the samples were transferred to Biodyne B positively charged nylon membrane (Pall Corp.) and hybridized with ARS305 and ARS501 sequences (probes described in Ref. 33Santocanale C. Diffley J.F. Nature. 1998; 395: 615-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar) using standard procedures. Western Blots and Kinase Assays—Overnight cultures were diluted to A600 = 0.2, and after 3 h, they were treated with 150 mm HU for 1 h or left untreated. Western blots and kinase assays were performed as described (30Pike B.L. Yongkiettrakul S. Tsai M.D. Heierhorst J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30421-30424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). For cell cycle phase Western analysis, cells were synchronized in G1 or allowed to proceed from a G1 arrest into S phase for 30 min or synchronized in G2/M with two doses of 15 μg/ml nocodazole over 3 h. PhosphorImager autoradiographs and densitometry scans of Western blots were quantified using ImageQuant software (34Hammet A. Pike B.L. Heierhorst J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22469-22474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Genetic Analyses of the Interaction between the Rad53 FHA1 Domain and the Rad9 and Rad17 DNA Damage Sensor Pathways—We have previously shown that introduction of an R70A mutation into the endogenous RAD53 gene, which disrupts the FHA1 phosphothreonine-binding site without affecting domain folding, leads to moderately increased DNA damage sensitivity (32Pike B.L. Hammet A. Heierhorst J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14019-14026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Extending these studies, we found that the R70A mutation completely abolishes Rad53 activation and Rad53-dependent cell cycle arrest in the G2/M checkpoint (30Pike B.L. Yongkiettrakul S. Tsai M.D. Heierhorst J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30421-30424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This role of the FHA1 could be due to its proposed interaction with Rad9 previously suggested from in vitro studies (24Schwartz M.F. Duong J.K. Sun Z. Morrow J.S. Pradhan D. Stern D.F. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1055-1065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 35Liao H. Yuan C. Su M.I. Yongkiettrakul S. Qin D. Li H. Byeon I.J. Pei D. Tsai M.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 941-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 36Durocher D. Taylor I.A. Sarbassova D. Haire L.F. Westcott S.L. Jackson S.P. Smerdon S.J. Yaffe M.B. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1169-1182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). To test this possibility, a strain combining the rad53-R70A allele with a gene deletion of RAD9 was generated and analyzed for DNA damage sensitivity. In these assays, the wild type strain had normal growth when plated on medium containing MMS or HU or after being UV-irradiated before plating on YPD, whereas the rad53Δ strain had greatly reduced viability in response to MMS and HU, and to a lesser extent, UV (Fig. 1). In the presence of these low concentrations of DNA-damaging agents, the FHA1 mutant strain had no obvious growth defect, consistent with its previously observed moderate damage sensitivity phenotype (30Pike B.L. Yongkiettrakul S. Tsai M.D. Heierhorst J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30421-30424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 32Pike B.L. Hammet A. Heierhorst J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14019-14026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, the rad9Δ strain was also only mildly damage-hypersensitive (Fig. 1). Interestingly, when these two alleles were combined in rad9Δrad53-R70A double mutants, cells became dramatically hypersensitive to DNA damage by MMS or UV treatment (Fig. 1), indicating Rad9-independent functions of the FHA1 domain. Similar results were obtained when the rad53-R70A mutation was combined with gene deletions of RAD17 or DDC1 in which disruption of the FHA1 domain severely hypersensitized both the rad17Δ and the ddc1Δ strains to DNA damage by MMS and UV (Fig. 1). In contrast to the rad9Δrad53-R70A double mutant, the rad53-R70A mutation in rad17Δ or ddc1Δ also caused a synergistic hypersensitivity to the replication blocking agent HU (Fig. 1). These synthetic genetic interactions of the rad53-R70A allele with rad9Δ, rad17Δ, and ddc1Δ indicate that the FHA1 domain has major functions outside the cell cycle-wide checkpoint pathways. As the increased sensitivity of double mutants to chronic exposure to genotoxic agents could reflect either a growth defect or increased lethality, quantitative survival analyses were performed in which cells were treated for shorter times in liquid culture before replating on normal medium to allow survivors to form colonies. Again, in response to MMS, the rad53-R70A mutation severely increased the DNA damage hypersensitivity of rad9Δ and rad17Δ strains, as well as a strain lacking DDC1 (Fig. 2A and data not shown), and the HU sensitivity of rad17Δ (Fig. 2B). rad53-R70A also increased the MMS sensitivity of a rad17Δrad9Δ double mutant, further demonstrating that the FHA1 domain has major Rad9- and Rad17-independent functions for DNA damage survival. The FHA1 Phosphothreonine-binding Site Mutation Does Not Exacerbate Rad53 Activation Defects in rad9Δ and rad17Δ Mutants—Rad53 phosphorylation in response to DNA damage correlates with activation of the checkpoint response and can be monitored by electrophoretic mobility shifts in Western blots (37Sun Z. Fay D.S. Marini F. Foiani M. Stern D.F. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 395-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 38Sanchez Y. Desany B.A. Jones W.J. Liu Q. Wang B. Elledge S.J. Science. 1996; 271: 357-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Rad53 phosphorylation by upstream kinases Mec1 or Tel1 activates its protein kinase catalytic domain, and increased kinase activity can be detected in autophosphorylation assays (39Pellicioli A. Lucca C. Liberi G. Marini F. Lopes M. Plevani P. Romano A. Di Fiore P.P. Foiani M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6561-6572Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 40Pellicioli A L.S. Lucca C Foiani M Haber JE. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 293-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). To explore the mechanism by which rad53-R70A FHA1 phosphothreonine-binding site mutation enhances defects in upstream activating pathways, Rad53 activation was monitored by both mobility shifts in Western blots and in kinase autophosphorylation assays. Slower mobility forms of Rad53 were observed in response to both HU and MMS, and these Rad53 mobility shifts were not diminished in the rad53-R70A mutant as compared with wild type (Fig. 3A). In response to MMS treatment, Rad53 shifts were reduced in rad9Δ, rad17Δ, and rad9Δrad17Δ mutants; however, the FHA1-R70A substitution did not further reduce Rad53 mobility shifts in these strains (Fig. 3, A and C). Likewise, rad53-R70A did not reduce Rad53 autokinase activity in otherwise wild type or these mutant strains (Fig. 3C, top panel). In fact, the Rad53-R70A isoform actually had moderately increased autokinase activity as compared with the wild type protein after DNA damage treatment (Fig. 3C). Therefore, the increased DNA damage sensitivity of checkpoint mutant strains by the rad53-R70A mutation is unlikely to be due to a synergistic defect in Rad53 kinase activation. The FHA1 Domain Functions in the Replication Checkpoint Pathway—An alternative explanation for the DNA damage sensitivity phenotypes could be that the Rad53 FHA1 domain has important RAD9- and RAD17-independent DNA damage response functions in the replication checkpoint. DNA is most susceptible to damage during S phase (41Tercero J.A. Longhese M.P. Diffley J.F. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1323-1336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). The DNA replication process generates structural intermediates containing regions of single-stranded DNA that are fragile and can mimic DNA structures found after damage. As well as sensing DNA damage, the checkpoint machinery must also differentiate between damage and replication intermediates and be able to detect failure of replication fork progression during S phase (reviewed in Ref. 42Jares P. Donaldson A. Blow J.J. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 319-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). When nucleotide pools are depleted by HU or when replication forks collide with DNA lesions, a separate replication checkpoint pathway, in addition to the S phase functions of the Rad9/Rad17 pathways (43Paulovich A.G. Hartwell L.H. Cell. 1995; 82: 841-847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar), relays DNA replication interference signals to the central transducers Mec1 and Rad53 (44Elledge S.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1664-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1765) Google Scholar, 45Navas T.A. Zhou Z. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 29-39Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Of the proteins that function to activate Rad53 specifically in the replication checkpoint pathway, Mrc1 is suggested to have a similar role to Rad9 in the cell cycle-wide damage response (46Alcasabas A.A. Osborn A.J. Bachant J. Hu F. Werler P.J. Bousset K. Furuya K. Diffley J.F. Carr A.M. Elledge S.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 958-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether the rad53-R70A-associated DNA damage hypersensitivity could be attributed to defective signaling from the replication checkpoint branch by deleting MRC1 from various relevant strains. mrc1Δ alone did not obviously sensitize the cells to HU, MMS, or UV at low concentrations in plate assays or higher concentrations in liquid assays (Figs. 1 and 2, C and D). Interestingly, in contrast to rad9Δrad53-R70A and rad17Δrad53-R70A, the mrc1Δrad53-R70A double mutant displayed no increase in MMS, UV, or HU sensitivity as compared with the respective single mutants (Figs. 1 and 2, C and D). This suggests that the Mrc1 and FHA1 pathways are largely overlapping, and therefore, that the FHA1 is critical for Rad53 functions in the replication checkpoint pathway. Similar to rad17Δrad53-R70A, a rad17Δmrc1Δ double mutant was dramatically hypersensitive to HU, MMS, and UV (Figs. 1 and 2). Therefore, rad53-R70A and mrc1Δ have qualitatively similar synthetic effects with rad17Δ. Furthermore, rad53-R70A did not enhance the phenotype of rad17Δmrc1Δ, consistent with a function of the FHA1 in the Mrc1 pathway (Figs. 1 and 2, C and D). However, the sensitivity of the rad17Δmrc1Δ strain to HU was considerably greater than that of rad17Δrad53-R70A (Fig. 2D), indicating that the FHA1 domain is only involved in some parts of the Mrc1 pathway. Conversely, introduction of the rad53-R70A allele resulted in slightly increased sensitivity to UV and high doses of MMS in the rad17Δmrc1Δ background (Figs. 1 and 2C), indicating that the FHA1 phosphothreonine-binding site has some MRC1-independent functions, consistent with its role in the G2/M checkpoint (30Pike B.L. Yongkiettrakul S. Tsai M.D. Heierhorst J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30421-30424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the overall striking similarity between the DNA damage sensitivities of mrc1Δ in the presence and absence of the rad53-R70A allele demonstrates that the FHA1 functions in the Mrc1 pathway. The Rad53 FHA1 Domain Is Required to Regulate the Firing of Late Replication Origins—Eukaryotic DNA replication origins are classified as “early” or “late” depending on the time during S phase at which they are activated to initiate a pair of replication forks. A major function of the Mrc1/Rad53 pathway is to inhibit late replication origin firing in the presence of replication blocks (33Santocanale C. Diffley J.F. Nature. 1998; 395: 615-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar, 47Shirahige K. Hori Y. Shiraishi K. Yamashita M. Takahashi K. Obuse C. Tsurimoto T. Yoshikawa H. Nature. 1998; 395: 618-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether the FHA1 domain is required for this Rad53-dependent suppression of late origin firing. Replication intermediates of undigested genomic DNA can be resolved using denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis, in which small replication intermediates can enter the gel and can be visualized as a smear after hybridization with origin-specific probes. We followed the accumulation of replication intermediates from the well characterized early ARS305 and late ARS501 origins. We chose the mrc1Δ strain as a control because it has previously been shown that the absence of Mrc1 or Rad53 causes identical defects in the regulation of late origin firing, but mrc1Δ does not share the poor growth properties of rad53Δ (46Alcasabas A.A. Osborn A.J. Bachant J. Hu F. Werler P.J. Bousset K. Furuya K. Diffley J.F. Carr A.M. Elledge S.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 958-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). In the presence of HU, no replication intermediates were detected from the late ARS501 origin in wild type cells, even 120 min after release from α-factor (Fig. 4A). Similar to previous observations (46Alcasabas A.A. Osborn A.J. Bachant J. Hu F. Werler P.J. Bousset K. Furuya K. Diffley J.F. Carr A.M. Elle"
