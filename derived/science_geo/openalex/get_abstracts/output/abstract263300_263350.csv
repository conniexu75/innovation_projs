https://openalex.org/W2089417246,"A crystal structure of a complex between the DNA methyltransferase regulatory factor Dnmt3L and the catalytic domain of Dnmt3a leads to a model being proposed for the preferential methylation of DNA on maternally imprinted genes. Genetic imprinting, found in flowering plants and placental mammals, uses DNA methylation to yield gene expression that is dependent on the parent of origin1. DNA methyltransferase 3a (Dnmt3a) and its regulatory factor, DNA methyltransferase 3-like protein (Dnmt3L), are both required for the de novo DNA methylation of imprinted genes in mammalian germ cells. Dnmt3L interacts specifically with unmethylated lysine 4 of histone H3 through its amino-terminal PHD (plant homeodomain)-like domain2. Here we show, with the use of crystallography, that the carboxy-terminal domain of human Dnmt3L interacts with the catalytic domain of Dnmt3a, demonstrating that Dnmt3L has dual functions of binding the unmethylated histone tail and activating DNA methyltransferase. The complexed C-terminal domains of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3L showed further dimerization through Dnmt3a–Dnmt3a interaction, forming a tetrameric complex with two active sites. Substitution of key non-catalytic residues at the Dnmt3a–Dnmt3L interface or the Dnmt3a–Dnmt3a interface eliminated enzymatic activity. Molecular modelling of a DNA–Dnmt3a dimer indicated that the two active sites are separated by about one DNA helical turn. The C-terminal domain of Dnmt3a oligomerizes on DNA to form a nucleoprotein filament. A periodicity in the activity of Dnmt3a on long DNA revealed a correlation of methylated CpG sites at distances of eight to ten base pairs, indicating that oligomerization leads Dnmt3a to methylate DNA in a periodic pattern. A similar periodicity is observed for the frequency of CpG sites in the differentially methylated regions of 12 maternally imprinted mouse genes. These results suggest a basis for the recognition and methylation of differentially methylated regions in imprinted genes, involving the detection of both nucleosome modification and CpG spacing."
https://openalex.org/W2080914771,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is an anxiety-spectrum disorder characterized by persistent intrusive thoughts (obsessions) and repetitive actions (compulsions). Dysfunction of cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical circuitry is implicated in OCD, although the underlying pathogenic mechanisms are unknown. SAP90/PSD95-associated protein 3 (SAPAP3; also known as DLGAP3) is a postsynaptic scaffolding protein at excitatory synapses that is highly expressed in the striatum. Here we show that mice with genetic deletion of Sapap3 exhibit increased anxiety and compulsive grooming behaviour leading to facial hair loss and skin lesions; both behaviours are alleviated by a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Electrophysiological, structural and biochemical studies of Sapap3-mutant mice reveal defects in cortico-striatal synapses. Furthermore, lentiviral-mediated selective expression of Sapap3 in the striatum rescues the synaptic and behavioural defects of Sapap3-mutant mice. These findings demonstrate a critical role for SAPAP3 at cortico-striatal synapses and emphasize the importance of cortico-striatal circuitry in OCD-like behaviours. The underlying neurobiology of obsessive-compulsive disorder is largely unknown, although disruptions in corticostriatal circuits are suspected. For many medical conditions, mouse models provide a means of examining pathogenesis and drug testing. Surprisingly, that option is now available for obsessive-compulsive disorder too. Targeted deletion of SAPAP3, a postsynaptic scaffolding protein highly expressed in the striatum, yields mice with many of the behavioural characteristics of obsessive-compulsive disorder: they compulsively self-groom, display anxiety, and have abnormal corticostriatal physiology. The behavioural signs are alleviated by selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, drugs used to treat obsessive-compulsive disorder. Targeted deletion of SAPAP3, a postsynaptic scaffolding protein expressed in the striatum, yields a behavioral phenotype with many characteristics of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). SAPAP3−/− mice compulsively overgroom themselves and are unusually anxious. Behavioral symptoms are alleviated by SSRIs, and both behaviour and physiological abnormalities are rescued by lentiviral-mediated expression of SAPAP3 in the striatum."

https://openalex.org/W2121045435,"Plants and their pollinators and seed dispersers form complex networks of interdependences. These networks have a well-defined architecture that strongly affects biodiversity maintenance. Using a phylogenetic approach, Rezende et al. show that past evolutionary history of plants and animals partly explains the network patterns. Closely related species tend to play similar roles in the network. As a result, coextinction cascades following a species extinction affect taxonomically related species, resulting in a non-random pruning of the evolutionary tree. From a conservation standpoint, this means that cascades of coextinction may spread across related species, further increasing the erosion of taxonomic diversity. A phylogenetic approach is used to show that past evolutionary history partly explains network patterns that link plants and their pollinators and seed dispersers. Species close in the phylogeny tend to play similar roles in the network. As a result, co-extinction cascades following the extinction of a species affect taxonomically related species, resulting in a non-random pruning of the evolutionary tree. The interactions between plants and their animal pollinators and seed dispersers have moulded much of Earth’s biodiversity1,2,3. Recently, it has been shown that these mutually beneficial interactions form complex networks with a well-defined architecture that may contribute to biodiversity persistence4,5,6,7,8. Little is known, however, about which ecological and evolutionary processes generate these network patterns3,9. Here we use phylogenetic methods10,11 to show that the phylogenetic relationships of species predict the number of interactions they exhibit in more than one-third of the networks, and the identity of the species with which they interact in about half of the networks. As a consequence of the phylogenetic effects on interaction patterns, simulated extinction events tend to trigger coextinction cascades of related species. This results in a non-random pruning of the evolutionary tree12,13 and a more pronounced loss of taxonomic diversity than expected in the absence of a phylogenetic signal. Our results emphasize how the simultaneous consideration of phylogenetic information and network architecture can contribute to our understanding of the structure and fate of species-rich communities."

https://openalex.org/W2094809677,"The irreversible evolution of a microscopic system under measurement is a central feature of quantum theory. From an initial state generally exhibiting quantum uncertainty in the measured observable, the system is projected into a state in which this observable becomes precisely known. Its value is random, with a probability determined by the initial system's state. The evolution induced by measurement (known as 'state collapse') can be progressive, accumulating the effects of elementary state changes. Here we report the observation of such a step-by-step collapse by non-destructively measuring the photon number of a field stored in a cavity. Atoms behaving as microscopic clocks cross the cavity successively. By measuring the light-induced alterations of the clock rate, information is progressively extracted, until the initially uncertain photon number converges to an integer. The suppression of the photon number spread is demonstrated by correlations between repeated measurements. The procedure illustrates all the postulates of quantum measurement (state collapse, statistical results and repeatability) and should facilitate studies of non-classical fields trapped in cavities."
https://openalex.org/W1999223777,"Reproduction numbers, defined as averages of the number of people infected by a typical case, play a central role in tracking infectious disease outbreaks. The aim of this paper is to develop methods for estimating reproduction numbers which are simple enough that they could be applied with limited data or in real time during an outbreak. I present a new estimator for the individual reproduction number, which describes the state of the epidemic at a point in time rather than tracking individuals over time, and discuss some potential benefits. Then, to capture more of the detail that micro-simulations have shown is important in outbreak dynamics, I analyse a model of transmission within and between households, and develop a method to estimate the household reproduction number, defined as the number of households infected by each infected household. This method is validated by numerical simulations of the spread of influenza and measles using historical data, and estimates are obtained for would-be emerging epidemics of these viruses. I argue that the household reproduction number is useful in assessing the impact of measures that target the household for isolation, quarantine, vaccination or prophylactic treatment, and measures such as social distancing and school or workplace closures which limit between-household transmission, all of which play a key role in current thinking on future infectious disease mitigation."

https://openalex.org/W2054554285,"Marburg and Ebola viruses can cause large hemorrhagic fever (HF) outbreaks with high case fatality (80–90%) in human and great apes. Identification of the natural reservoir of these viruses is one of the most important topics in this field and a fundamental key to understanding their natural history. Despite the discovery of this virus family almost 40 years ago, the search for the natural reservoir of these lethal pathogens remains an enigma despite numerous ecological studies. Here, we report the discovery of Marburg virus in a common species of fruit bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus) in Gabon as shown by finding virus-specific RNA and IgG antibody in individual bats. These Marburg virus positive bats represent the first naturally infected non-primate animals identified. Furthermore, this is the first report of Marburg virus being present in this area of Africa, thus extending the known range of the virus. These data imply that more areas are at risk for MHF outbreaks than previously realized and correspond well with a recently published report in which three species of fruit bats were demonstrated to be likely reservoirs for Ebola virus."

https://openalex.org/W1989722258,"Background T cell mediated inflammation contributes to atherogenesis and the onset of acute cardiovascular disease. Effector T cell functions are under a tight control of a specialized T cell subset, regulatory T cells (Treg). At present, nothing is known about the in situ presence of Treg in human atherosclerotic tissue. In the present study we investigated the frequency of naturally occurring Treg cells in all developmental stages of human atherosclerotic lesions including complicated thrombosed plaques. Methodology Normal arteries, early lesions (American Heart Association classification types I, II, and III), fibrosclerotic plaques (types Vb and Vc) and ‘high risk’ plaques (types IV, Va and VI) were obtained at surgery and autopsy. Serial sections were immunostained for markers specific for regulatory T cells (FOXP3 and GITR) and the frequency of these cells was expressed as a percentage of the total numbers of CD3+ T cells. Results were compared with Treg counts in biopsies of normal and inflammatory skin lesions (psoriasis, spongiotic dermatitis and lichen planus). Principle findings In normal vessel fragments T cells were virtually absent. Treg were present in the intima during all stages of plaque development (0.5–5%). Also in the adventitia of atherosclerotic vessels Treg were encountered, in similar low amounts. High risk lesions contained significantly increased numbers of Treg compared to early lesions (mean: 3.9 and 1.2%, respectively). The frequency of FOXP3+ cells in high risk lesions was also higher compared to stable lesions (1.7%), but this difference was not significant. The mean numbers of intimal FOXP3 positive cells in atherosclerotic lesions (2.4%) was much lower than those in normal (24.3%) or inflammatory skin lesions (28%). Conclusion Low frequencies of Treg in all developmental stages of human plaque formation could explain the smoldering chronic inflammatory process that takes place throughout the longstanding course of atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W2110512562,"Current evidence supports a contribution of polyphenols to the prevention of cardiovascular disease, but their mechanisms of action are not understood. We investigated the impact of red wine polyphenols on postprandial cytotoxic lipid peroxidation products (MDA) levels in humans. In a randomized, crossover study, the effect of red wine polyphenols on postprandial levels of plasma and urine MDA was investigated. Three meals of 250 g turkey cutlets supplemented by water (A); soaked in red wine after heating plus 200 ml of red wine (B); or soaked in red wine prior to heating plus 200 ml of red wine (C) were administered to 10 healthy volunteers. Subject baseline plasma levels of MDA were 50 +/- 20 nM. After a meal of turkey meat cutlets, plasma MDA levels increased by 160 nM (P<0.0001); after (B) there was a 75% reduction in the absorption of MDA (P<0.0001). However, after (C), the elevation of plasma MDA was completely prevented (P<0.0001). Similar results were obtained for MDA accumulation in urine. Our study suggests that red wine polyphenols exert a beneficial effect by the novel new function, absorption inhibition of the lipotoxin MDA. These findings explain the potentially harmful effects of oxidized fats found in foods and the important benefit of dietary polyphenols in the meal."
https://openalex.org/W2027575557,"Differentiation and patterning in the developing nervous system require the vitamin A metabolite all-trans-retinoic acid (atRA). Recent data suggest that higher cognitive functions, such as creation of hippocampal memory, also require atRA and its receptors, RAR, through affecting synaptic plasticity. Here we show that within 30 min atRA increased dendritic growth approximately 2-fold, and PSD-95 and synaptophysin puncta intensity approximately 3-fold, in cultured mouse hippocampal neurons, suggesting increased synapse formation. atRA (10 nM) increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation within 10 min. In synaptoneurosomes, atRA rapidly increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2, its target 4E-BP, and p70S6K, and its substrate, ribosome protein S6, indicating activation of MAPK and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Immunofluorescence revealed intense dendritic expression of RARalpha in the mouse hippocampus and localization of RARalpha on the surfaces of primary cultures of hippocampal neurons, with bright puncta along soma and neurites. Surface biotinylation confirmed the locus of RARalpha expression. Knockdown of RARalpha by shRNA impaired atRA-induced spine formation and abolished dendritic growth. Prolonged atRA stimulation reduced surface/total RARalpha by 43%, suggesting internalization, whereas brain-derived nerve growth factor or bicuculline increased the ratio by approximately 1.8-fold. atRA increased translation in the somatodendritic compartment, similar to brain-derived nerve growth factor. atRA specifically increased dendritic translation and surface expression of the alpha-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate receptor (AMPAR) subunit 1 (GluR1), without affecting GluR2. These data provide mechanistic insight into atRA function in the hippocampus and identify a unique membrane-associated RARalpha that mediates rapid induction of neuronal translation by atRA."
https://openalex.org/W2162300885,"We have determined CO2 permeabilities, P(CO2), of red cells of normal human blood and of blood deficient in various blood group proteins by a previously described mass spectrometric technique. While P(CO2) of normal red cells is approximately 0.15 cm/s, we find in red blood cells (RBCs) lacking the Rh protein complex (Rh(null)) a significantly reduced P(CO2) of 0.07 cm/s +/-0.02 cm/s (P<0.02). This value is similar to the value we have reported previously for RBCs lacking aquaporin-1 protein (AQP-1(null)), suggesting that each of the Rh and AQP-1 proteins is responsible for approximately 1/2 of the normal CO2 permeability of the RBC membrane. Four other blood group deficiencies tested lack diverse membrane proteins but exhibit normal CO2 permeability. The CO2 pathway constituted by Rh proteins was inhibitable at pH(e)= 7.4 by NH4Cl with an I50 of approximately 10 mM corresponding to an I50 for NH3 of approximately 0.3 mM. The pathway independent of Rh proteins, presumably that constituted by AQP-1, was not inhibitable by NH4Cl/NH3. However, both pathways were strongly inhibited by DIDS, which accounts for the marked inhibitory effect of DIDS on normal P(CO2), while in contrast another AE1 inhibitor, DiBAC, does not inhibit P(CO2), although it markedly reduces P(HCO3-). We conclude that Rh protein, presumably the Rh-associated glycoprotein RhAG, possesses a gas channel that allows passage of CO2 in addition to NH3."

Interestingly, our results show that αKlotho, another Klotho family protein related to βKlotho, also induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation in response to FGF19 treatment and increased FGF19-FGFR4 interactions in vitro, similar to the effects of βKlotho. In addition, heparin further enhanced the effects of both αKlotho and βKlotho in FGF19 signaling and interaction experiments.

This family of secreted proteins has been implicated in a variety of functions including angiogenesis, mitogenesis, vertebrate and invertebrate development, cellular differentiation, wound healing/repair, and metabolic regulations (2Eswarakumar V.P.

Genome Biol. 2001; 2 (REVIEWS3005.1-3005.12)Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Four tyrosine kinase receptors have been identified for FGFs (FGFR1–4), each containing an extracellular ligand binding domain, a single transmembrane domain, and an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain (5Mohammadi M. Olsen S.K. Ibrahimi O.A. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2005; 16: 107-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Alternative RNA splicing of one of two unique exons in FGFR1–3 results in the two different, b and c, receptor isoforms (2Eswarakumar V.P. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2005; 16: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1465) Google Scholar). Because most FGFs only function in an autocrine or paracrine fashion, the tissue distribution of these FGFs determines the tissue specific functions for most of the FGF family members (2Eswarakumar V.P. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2005; 16: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1465) Google Scholar, 4Ornitz D.M. Itoh N. Genome Biol. 2001; 2 (REVIEWS3005.1-3005.12)Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The FGF19 subfamily contains three members, FGF19, FGF21, and FGF23. In contrast to other FGFs, which require heparin or heparan sulfate for high affinity receptor binding and activation, FGF19 subfamily members do not bind heparin with high affinity (6Goetz R. Beenken A. Ibrahimi O.A. Kalinina J. Olsen S.K. Eliseenkova A.V. Xu C. Neubert T.A. Zhang F. Linhardt R.J. Yu X. White K.E. Inagaki T. Kliewer S.A. Yamamoto M. Kurosu H. Ogawa Y. Kuro-o M. Lanske B.

In addition, FGF19 subfamily members contain intramolecular disulfide bonds, which may function to increase their stability in plasma and allow them to function as hormones (7Harmer N.J.

Hypertens. 2005; 14: 325-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These unique features of the FGF19 subfamily suggest that they may interact with their receptors differently from the canonical FGFs and may require different receptor complexes to function.The unique receptor requirements were first noted from studies with FGF23 (16Urakawa I. Yamazaki Y. Shimada T. Iijima K. Hasegawa H. Okawa K. Fujita T. Fukumoto S. Yamashita T. Nature. 2006; 444: 770-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (1421) Google Scholar, 17Kurosu H. Ogawa Y. Miyoshi M.

The αKlotho gene encodes a 130-kDa single-pass transmembrane protein with a short cytoplasmic domain. Since FGF23-deficient mice (Fgf23–/– mice) and αKlotho-deficient mice (αKloth–/– mice) share remarkable similarity in phenotypes, including shortened life span, growth retardation, infertility, muscle atrophy, hypoglycemia, and vascular calcification in the kidneys (18Shimada T.

Fujimori T. Nabeshima Y. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), it was hypothesized that FGF23 and αKlotho function through a common signal transduction pathway. Direct evidence for αKlotho as a co-receptor for FGF23 came from recent biochemical and cellular studies (16Urakawa I. Yamazaki Y. Shimada T. Iijima K. Hasegawa H. Okawa K. Fujita T. Fukumoto S. Yamashita T. Nature. 2006; 444: 770-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (1421) Google Scholar, 17Kurosu H. Ogawa Y. Miyoshi M. Yamamoto M. Nandi A. Rosenblatt K.P. Baum M.G. Schiavi S. Hu M.C. Moe O.W. Kuro-o M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6120-6123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar). It was shown that although FGF23 alone has poor affinity for FGFRs and did not promote efficient activation of FGFRs in cells, αKlotho was able to function as an essential cofactor for the activation of FGFR signaling by FGF23. This suggests that FGF23 binds an αKlotho-FGFR complex with higher affinity than to either receptor alone. Coexpression of αKlotho in HEK293 and Chinese hamster ovary cells significantly enhanced the ability of FGF23 to induce phosphorylation of FGF receptor substrate and ERK1/2 in these cells (16Urakawa I. Yamazaki Y. Shimada T. Iijima K. Hasegawa H. Okawa K. Fujita T. Fukumoto S. Yamashita T. Nature. 2006; 444: 770-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (1421) Google Scholar, 17Kurosu H. Ogawa Y. Miyoshi M.

Similar observations have recently been reported for FGF21. Instead of requiring αKlotho as a cofactor, FGF21 utilizes another Klotho family protein, βKlotho, as a coreceptor for signaling (20Ogawa Y. Kurosu H. Yamamoto M. Nandi A. Rosenblatt K.P. Goetz R. Eliseenkova A.V. Mohammadi M. Kuro-o M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 7432-7437Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Therefore, the presence of βKlotho confers high affinity binding of FGF21 to FGFRs and allows cells coexpressing βKlotho and FGFRs to respond to FGF21 and activate signal transduction pathways.Although earlier observations suggest that heparin has low affinity interaction with FGF19 and may act as a weak cofactor for FGF19 (21Xie M.H. Holcomb I. Deuel B. Dowd P. Huang A. Vagts A. Foster J. Liang J. Brush J. Gu Q. Hillan K. Goddard A. Gurney A.L. Cytokine. 1999; 11: 729-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), whether additional factors were required or could modulate FGF19-FGFR interactions and the effect of heparin on receptor complex formation have not been defined. Here, we show that both αKlotho and βKlotho may function as coreceptors for FGF19. The presence of αKlotho or βKlotho together with relatively high concentrations of heparin confers the strongest binding of FGF19 to FGFR and results in the highest level of ERK1/2 phosphorylation following receptor activation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids and Proteins—Full-length human βKlotho, αKlotho, and extracellular domains of human βKlotho and αKlotho were cloned into the pTT14 expression vector. pFA2-Elk1 and pFR-Luc plasmids used in the ERK luciferase reporter assay were from Stratagene. Renilla luciferase, pRL-TK (Promega), was used as an internal control reporter. Recombinant FGF19 and FGFR-Fc fusion proteins were purchased from R&D.Cell Culture and Transfections—HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were transfected with the expression vector plasmids using the Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol.Conditioned Medium Preparation—HEK293 cells were transfected with expression vectors encoding the extracellular domains of βKlotho and αKlotho, and the medium was collected 3 days after transfection. Expression of soluble βKlotho and αKlotho was confirmed by Western blot using anti-βKlotho and anti-αKlotho antibodies (R&D). Medium from cells transfected with vector encoding green florescent protein (GFP) was also collected as a negative control.Pull-down Assay—To analyze the interaction between FGF19 and FGF receptors, recombinant FGF19 (0.5 μg) was mixed with FGFR1c-Fc, FGFR2c-Fc, FGFR3c-Fc, or FGFR4-Fc fusion proteins (0.5 μg) in conditioned medium and applied to 50 μl of protein G-Sepharose at 4 °C for 2 h. The beads were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and then suspended in SDS sample buffer and subjected to Western blot analysis with anti-FGF19 antibody (R&D).ERK Activation Reporter Assay—HEK293 cells were seeded in 96-well plates (105 cells/well). For each well, the transfection was done by mixing 10 ng of pFA2-Elk1, 150 ng of pFR-Luc, and 10 ng of pRL-TK reporter plasmids and 150 ng of βKlotho expression vector in 25 μl of OptiMEM (Invitrogen) with 0.5 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 in 25 μl of OptiMEM. On the following day, the cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without serum but with 0.2% bovine serum albumin overnight. The cells were incubated with various concentrations of FGF19 for 5 h, and the luciferase activity was measured using DualGlo (Promega), according to the manufacturer's instructions.Western Blot Analysis of the FGF Signaling Pathway—HEK293 cells were transfected in 6-well plates and starved in serum-free medium overnight the day after transfection. For heparitinase treatment, 0.2 units/ml heparitinase (Sigma) was incubated with the cells for 3 h before FGF19 was added. After treatment with various concentrations of recombinant human FGF19 for 15 min, cells were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and cell lysates were prepared in SDS sample buffer and subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-phospho-p44/42 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase (anti-phospho-ERK1/2) antibody (Cell Signaling) and anti-ERK antibody (Cell Signaling).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONSβKlotho and Heparin Enhance FGF19 Activation of FGFR Signaling—Since βKlotho is highly expressed in the liver and mice deficient in βKlotho exhibit a dramatic elevation of bile acid synthesis, we tested the possibility that βKlotho might function as a co-receptor for FGF19. We used a luciferase reporter assay system based on ERK1/2 phosphorylation (22Kawasaki H. Springett G.M. Toki S. Canales J.J. Harlan P. Blumenstiel J.P. Chen E.J. Bany I.A. Mochizuki N. Ashbacher A.

A. 1998; 95: 13278-13283Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) to test the activation of the FGF signaling pathway by FGF19 in HEK293 cells, which normally do not respond to FGF19 treatment. In HEK293 cells transfected with only control GFP vector, FGF19 did not activate any luciferase reporter expression (Fig. 1). To test whether βKlotho is required for FGF19 activation of FGF signaling, we transfected HEK293 cells with full-length human βKlotho and stimulated the cells with various concentrations of FGF19. As shown in Fig. 1, βKlotho-expressing cells responded to FGF19 in a dose-dependent manner with an EC50 value of 54 nm. Although FGF19 has been reported to have significantly lower heparin binding affinity (6Goetz R. Beenken A. Ibrahimi O.A. Kalinina J. Olsen S.K. Eliseenkova A.V. Xu C. Neubert T.A. Zhang F. Linhardt R.J. Yu X. White K.E. Inagaki T. Kliewer S.A. Yamamoto M. Kurosu H. Ogawa Y. Kuro-o M. Lanske B. Razzaque M.S. Mohammadi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 3417-3428Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar), adding heparin at a relatively high concentration of 20 μg/ml to the cells further enhanced the FGF19 response (Fig. 1). Heparin alone at this concentration had no effect on the reporter expression (Fig. 1). These results suggest that FGF19 may signal through the complex formed by βKlotho, heparin, and FGF receptors.βKlotho and Heparin Enhance the Binding of FGF19 to FGFR4—The mammalian FGFRs are encoded by four distinct genes (FGFR1 through FGFR4). A major alternative mRNA splicing event within one of the three immunoglobulin-like extracellular domains of FGFR1–3 generates the b and c isoforms. It has been shown that both βKlotho and αKlotho preferentially bind to the c isoforms of FGFR1–3 and FGFR4 (17Kurosu H. Ogawa Y. Miyoshi M. Yamamoto M. Nandi A. Rosenblatt K.P. Baum M.G. Schiavi S.

FGF21 interacted with FGFR1c, FGFR2c, and FGFR4 complexed with βKlotho (20Ogawa Y. Kurosu H. Yamamoto M. Nandi A. Rosenblatt K.P. Goetz R. Eliseenkova A.V. Mohammadi M. Kuro-o M. Proc. Natl. Acad.

To investigate the effects of βKlotho and heparin on the binding of FGF19 to the various FGFRs, we used pull-down experiments to test whether FGF19 can be co-precipitated by Fc-FGFR fusion proteins complexed to protein G beads. In the presence of 20 μg/ml heparin, we demonstrated the binding of FGF19 to FGFR4 but did not detect significant binding to FGFR1c, FGFR2c, and FGFR3c (Fig. 2A, left panel). When conditioned medium containing the extracellular domain of βKlotho was added to the immunoprecipitation reaction, the FGF19-FGFR4 interaction was increased, but still no significant interactions could be observed between FGF19 and the other FGFRs (Fig. 2A, right panel). These results are consistent with the previous findings that FGF19 specifically interacts with FGFR4 (21Xie M.H. Holcomb I. Deuel B. Dowd P. Huang A. Vagts A. Foster J. Liang J. Brush J. Gu Q. Hillan K. Goddard A. Gurney A.L. Cytokine. 1999; 11: 729-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar); however, they do not necessarily rule out interactions between FGF19 and other receptors under different conditions. To further dissect the individual roles played by βKlotho and heparin on the interactions between FGF19 and FGFR4, we tested the additional combination of heparin and βKlotho. In the absence of βKlotho and heparin, no significant interactions were observed between FGF19 and FGFR4 (Fig. 2B, left panel). The addition of either soluble βKlotho conditioned media or heparin alone increased the interaction between FGF19 and FGFR4 (Fig. 2B, middle two panels). The strongest signal was detected when both βKlotho and heparin were present in the immunoprecipitation solution (Fig. 2B, right panel). These results suggest that although either βKlotho or heparin alone could potentiate interactions between FGF19 and FGFR4, together they show an even greater effect and perhaps may work synergistically with FGFR4 to provide the high affinity receptor complex for FGF19.FIGURE 2FGF19 interaction with FGFRs requires both βKlotho and heparin. A, FGF19 binds to FGFR4. Interactions between FGF19 and Fc-FGF fusion receptors were analyzed by a pull-down assay. In the presence of 20 μg/ml heparin and soluble βKlotho, FGF19 binds to FGFR4. The left panel and the right panel are on the same gel with the same exposure. 1c, FGFR1c; 2c, FGFR2c; 3c, FGFR3c; 4, FGFR4. B, FGF19 requires either heparin or βKlotho to bind to FGFR4. βKlotho is needed for the binding between FGF19 and FGFR4 in the absence of heparin.

An experiment similar to that performed for βKlotho (Fig. 2B) was also established for αKlotho. In the absence of αKlotho and heparin, similar to the results seen in Fig. 2B, no significant interaction was observed between FGF19 and FGFR4 (Fig. 3, left panel). The addition of either soluble αKlotho conditioned medium or heparin alone increased the interactions between FGF19 and FGFR4 (Fig. 3, middle two panels). Again, similar to what was observed for βKlotho, the strongest signal was detected when both αKlotho and heparin were present in the immunoprecipitation solution (Fig. 3, right panel). These results suggest that, in contrast to FGF21 and FGF23, which are specific for one form of Klotho protein, FGF19 is able to interact with FGFR complexes that are formed with either αKlotho or βKlotho.FIGURE 3αKlotho enhances the binding of FGF19 to FGFR4.

Heparin also seemed to stimulate ERK1/2 phosphorylation in the presence of αKlotho as it did in the presence of βKlotho (Figs. 2B and 4). FGF19 was not able to activate ERK1/2 phosphorylation in HEK293 cells without Klotho proteins (Fig. 1 and data not shown). Therefore, it appears that at least in vitro, FGFRs/heparin complexed with either βKlotho or αKlotho may serve as receptor complexes for FGF19.FIGURE 4FGF19 actives ERK1/2 phosphorylation in HEK293 cells transfected withαKlotho orβKlotho. HEK293 cells were transfected with expression vectors for αKlotho or βKlotho. After being starved with serum-free medium overnight, the cells were stimulated with vehicle or 50 nm recombinant FGF19 for 15 min and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Heparin (20 μg/ml) was added just before the FGF19 treatment. Cell lysates were processed for Western blot with antibodies against phosphorylated ERK1/2 (pERK1/2) or total ERK1/2 (ERK1/2).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Both heparin and heparan sulfate are known to stimulate FGF signal transduction by increasing the affinity between the FGFs and FGFRs (23Pellegrini L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 629-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar); however, only heparan sulfate is present on cell surfaces. In our pull-down assay, we also found that heparin enhanced the binding of FGF19 and FGFR4 independent of αKlotho or βKlotho. However, in the ERK1/2 phosphorylation assay using HEK293 cells, FGF19 could not activate FGF signaling with heparin alone (Fig. 1). One potential explanation is that although either Klotho or heparin can stabilize the FGF19-FGFR complex, Klotho is fundamentally required for the activation of FGFR by FGF19, perhaps by inducing a specific conformation change in the receptor, which activates downstream signaling pathways. The other possibility is that the presence of endogenous heparan sulfate on the cell surface masked the effects of exogenously added heparin at the concentrations tested in the absence of Klotho proteins. To assess the possible contribution of endogenous heparan sulfate to the FGF19 signaling and provide evidence that the observed effects of heparin are physiologically relevant, we tested the effects of heparitinase treatment on FGF19-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation in βKlotho-transfected HEK293 cells. As shown in Fig. 5, heparitinase treatment significantly suppressed the FGF19 signaling in the absence of added heparin as observed by the reduced ERK1/2 phosphorylation levels. This result suggests that endogenous heparan sulfate could contribute to FGF19 signaling and that FGFRs/heparan sulfate complexed with Klotho may serve as receptor complexes for FGF19.FIGURE 5Effects of heparitinase treatment on FGF19 activation in HEK293 cells. HEK293 cells were transfected with expression vectors for βKlotho. After being serum-starved overnight, cells were treated with 0.2 units/ml heparitinase for 3 h before being stimulated with 100 nm recombinant FGF19 for 15 min and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen.

Our results strongly suggest that βKlotho acts as a cofactor that converts a canonical FGFR into a specific receptor for FGF19. The expression pattern of βKlotho may therefore restrict the action of FGF19 and thus confer the tissue-specific bioactivity on FGF19. This would be consistent with studies on the other two family members, FGF21 and FGF23 (16Urakawa I. Yamazaki Y. Shimada T. Iijima K. Hasegawa H. Okawa K. Fujita T. Fukumoto S. Yamashita T.

Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1129-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar). One of the most pressing problems in developing ESC-based applications has been the inefficient differentiation of ESCs into the specific therapeutic cell type of choice and the presence of unwanted differentiated cells of other germ layers. A strategy to overcome this problem is to derive lineage-specific progenitor stem cells from ESCs. The advantages of lineage-specific progenitor cells over ESCs are that they differentiate into a limited number of cell types of a particular lineage and, therefore, the differentiation will be robust and more efficient. In addition, they can self-renew, and thus, can be maintained as a renewable source of cells. ESCs can aggregate to form embryoid bodies (EBs) (2Doetschman T.C. Kim H. Katz M. Schmidt W. Kemler R. J.

However, there can be a mixture of differentiating cells in using an EB approach, whereas differentiation using monolayer culture can yield more uniform and homogenous results. A successful strategy for the use of ESCs in regenerative medicine could involve formation of lineage-restricted progenitor cell using a monolayer culture system as a first step. Gene expression analysis and fate maps together indicate that endoderm and mesoderm are derived, at least in part, from bipotent mesendodermal cells that separate during gastrulation (4Kimelman D.

The stability of β-catenin, the operative molecule of the canonical Wnt pathway, is controlled by glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β) via phosphorylation and subsequent degradation. Upon Wnt pathway activation, GSK-3β is inhibited, and the non-phosphorylated β-catenin is stabilized and enters the nucleus to activate transcription of Wnt-regulated genes (16Gregorieff A. Kim H. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 877-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 17Gordon M.D. Kim R. J. Biol.

Pharmacological inhibitors of GSK-3β have been used as direct intracellular activators of the canonical Wnt pathway. The objective of this study was to utilize Wnt pathway activation of ESCs grown under monolayer culture conditions to drive differentiation toward a progenitor population. Using a specific small molecule inhibitor of GSK-3β, we have isolated multipotential “mesendodermal progenitor clones” (MPCs) from mouse ESCs. These MPCs are T+, Flk-1+, Gsc+, and Foxa2+, and they exhibit stable phenotype in culture over a year. More importantly, MPCs have significantly enhanced potential to differentiate along a variety of mesodermal cell types, including skeletal lineage. Thus, our findings can be utilized to differentiate ESCs into lineage-specific progenitor clones, which are multipotential but restricted to meso/endodermal differentiation. These progenitors provide a unique opportunity to better understand mechanisms of early lineage commitment and open new avenues in cell replacement therapy.

Western Blotting—Total protein was extracted using lysis buffer from Cell Signaling, and 50 μg of protein was loaded per lane and resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE. For details, see Supplementary A in the supplemental materials. Luciferase Assay—Cells transfected with SuperTOP or Super-FOP plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) were treated as indicated, and luciferase assays were performed using a Pro-mega kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Wnt Pathway Activation and Isolation of MPC—Mouse ESCs were cultured continuously for 3 weeks in the presence of leukemia inhibitory factor as described above either in growth medium supplemented with 1 μm GSK-3β inhibitor (Eli Lilly) or in 50% growth medium and 50% Wnt3A CM to activate the Wnt pathway. Human ESCs were grown for 2 weeks similarly except that the concentration of GSK-3β inhibitor was 2 μm for H1 and 1 μm for the HuES lines. Isolation of MPCs—To isolate clones, single cell sorting was performed on E14 cells cultured continuously in the presence of specific inhibitor of GSK-3β (iGSK-3β, 1 μm) and leukemia inhibitory factor using BD fluorescence-activated cell sorter analyzer into 96-well dishes coated with feeders. Each well of 96-well dish had a single colony (or no colony), which was expanded in the presence of iGSK-3β (1 μm) and leukemia inhibitory factor and used for further molecular analysis and differentiation studies. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—E14 cells, H1 cells, and sprouting EBs grown on chamber slides were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature and permeabilized using 0.3% Triton-X in phosphate-buffered saline incubated with primary antibodies and secondary antibodies as described in Supplementary A in the supplemental materials. Molecular Analysis—1 μg of total RNA extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and purified using the spin column (Qiagen) was reverse-transcribed into cDNA using an Archive kit (Applied Biosystems). For details on RT-PCR, see Supplementary A in the supplemental materials. RT-PCR products were confirmed by sequencing. In real-time RT-PCR analysis, untreated mouse/human ESC cDNA was used as control, and data were normalized to β-actin expression and presented as -fold increase over untreated or Ctrl CM-treated ESCs. Endothelial, Cardiac, and Osteogenic Differentiation Assays—Prior to differentiation assays, MPCs were cultured in the presence of (1 μm) iGSK-3β; however, iGSK-3β was not present during differentiation assays. Endothelial Sprouting Assay—An endothelial sprouting assay was performed using ES-CULT endothelial kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (StemCell Technologies). Briefly, 10-day-old EBs formed using E14 cells or MPCs in methylcellulose were harvested, and an equal number of EBs were replated in collagen solution in the presence or absence of cytokines viz vascular endothelial growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, interleukin-6, and erythropoietin. EBs were scored on day 3 for sprouts, indicative of endothelial cells. Molecular analysis and immunofluorescence microscopy were performed on day 3 sprouting EBs. Cardiac Differentiation Assay—The hanging drop method (21Boheler K.R. Kim J. Tweedie D. Yang H.T. Anisimov S.V. Wobus A.M. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 189-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar) was employed to aggregate 625 cells/25 μl of medium for 2 days. On day 3, EBs were collected and cultured in suspension for 2 days in ES medium. On day 5, EBs were collected, and 20 EBs were plated on 0.1% gelatin-coated 10-cm dishes in ES medium in triplicate. EB was scored as a “beating EB” on day 6 only if each EB was beating in three or more separate areas. Osteogenic Differentiation Assays—E14 cells and MPCs 23, 31, and 38 were cultured on 0.1% gelatin-coated dishes in ES medium. 24 h later, medium optimized for osteogenic differentiation Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose) supplemented with 10% FBS, 0.1 μm dexamethasone, 50 μm ascorbate-2-phosphate, and 10 μm β-glycerophosphate was added (22Zuk P.A. Kim M. Mizuno H. Huang J. Futrell J.W. Katz A.J. Benhaim P. Lorenz H.P. Hedrick M.H. Tissue Eng. 2001; 7: 211-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (6245) Google Scholar). The medium was changed every 2 days, and cells were passaged as required. Molecular analysis and histochemical stainings were performed at the end of 3 weeks. Histochemical Staining—For all the stainings, cells were fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min and then washed with distilled water. Cells were stained using the alkaline phosphatase kit from Chemicon. Cells were incubated in freshly prepared 2% Alizarin Red S solution for 5 min and then washed with distilled water to remove nonspecific staining. Cells were incubated with 1% Alcian blue for 30 min and washed with 0.1 m HCl, pH 1.0, to remove the excess dye. Activation of Wnt Pathway Induces Differentiation of ESCs along Meso/Endoderm—Wnt signaling was induced in two ways: by the addition of active Wnt3A CM and a selective inhibitor of GSK-3β. CM made from L cells was used as a control (Ctrl CM). A well documented luciferase reporter assay was used to assess the ability of Wnt3A and iGSK-3β to activate the Wnt pathway in ESCs. The promoter driving luciferase expression contains either functional (SuperTOP Flash) or non-functional (SuperFOP Flash) β-catenin-responsive T cell factor binding sites. The Wnt3A CM and recombinant Wnt3A (100 ng/ml), when added to mouse ESCs (E14), increased the luciferase reporter activity in the TOP FLASH assays (Fig. 1A), whereas Ctrl CM did not, substantiating the contribution of Wnt3A present in the CM (Fig. 1A). We used iGSK-3β, a specific inhibitor of GSK-3β, from Eli Lilly as an intracellular activator of the Wnt pathway and compared its activity against BIO, a GSK-3β inhibitor used by others (23Sato N. Kim L. Skaltsounis L. Greengard P. Brivanlou A.H. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1709) Google Scholar). Luciferase reporter assays in E14 cells indicated that both iGSK-3β and BIO at 1 μm increased luciferase activity by several hundredfold. Induction by iGSK-3β was approximately double that of BIO, indicating higher potency of the iGSK-3β over BIO (Fig. 1A). Activation of the Wnt pathway leads to accumulation of dephosphorylated β-catenin in the cytoplasm (20Shibamoto S. Kim K. Takada R. Ito F. Takeichi M. Takada S. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 659-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The addition of Wnt3A CM or iGSK-3β (2 μm) on human ESCs (H1) led to accumulation of active β-catenin, whereas Ctrl CM did not, as determined by Western blotting using an antibody against active/non-phosphorylated β-catenin (Fig. 1B, upper panel). Total β-catenin levels remained the same in all the treatments (Fig. 1B, lower panel). We performed immunostaining to confirm the nuclear localization of β-catenin, an indication of active Wnt signaling. Fig. 1C shows that the iGSK-3β (1 μm)-treated E14 cells (lower panel) showed nuclear accumulation of β-catenin (green), whereas untreated cells did not (upper panel). Thus, both, Wnt3A CM and iGSK-3β activate the Wnt pathway in mouse and human ESCs. To understand the role of long term activation of the Wnt pathway in ESCs, H1 and E14 cells were treated continuously for 2 and 3 weeks, respectively, with either Wnt3A CM or iGSK-3β. Differentiation of E14 cells was assessed by real-time RT-PCR every 2 days for induction of differentiation (data not shown). The molecular analysis indicated that Wnt pathway activation led to induction of meso/endodermal markers (T-brachyury, Gata2, Nkx2.5, Hand1, Foxa2, AFP, Gata4, and Sox17) in E14 cells by 7-10 days, and the induction was stronger at day 21 (Fig. 1, D and E). We observed similar results in H1 cells (supplemental Fig. 1, A and B). Ctrl CM had no effect on up-regulation of markers of differentiation. Both iGSK-3β and Wnt3A gave very similar results of meso/endodermal induction of ESCs, indicating the specific activation of the Wnt pathway and the lack of nonspecific effects of either iGSK-3β or Wnt3A CM (Fig. 1, D and E). Interestingly, neither H1 nor E14 cells expressed markers indicative of ectoderm/neuroectoderm viz Pax6, Sox4, and Nestin in response to Wnt activation (Fig. 1E and supplemental Fig. 1B). By the end of 3 weeks, robust (up to 100-fold) up-regulations of mesodermal (T-brachyury, Nkx2.5, and Hand1) and endodermal (Foxa2, AFP, Gata4, Gata 6, and Sox17) markers were observed in E14 cells (Fig. 1E). A 20-100-fold increase in T-brachyury and Pitx2, which are direct targets of β-catenin, confirmed activation of the Wnt pathway (Fig. 1E). Immunostaining and Western blotting were performed to confirm the induction of some of the differentiation markers. iGSK-3β-treated H1 cells showed nuclear and perinuclear staining for Foxa2 and T-brachyury, respectively (Fig. 1F, right panel). The lack of staining in untreated H1 cells was indicative of the absence of proteins and nonspecific staining (Fig. 1F, left panel). We obtained similar results using H1 cells treated with Wnt3A CM (data not shown). Fig. 1G shows the presence of Foxa2 protein by Western blotting in Wnt3A- and iGSK-3β-treated H1 cells along with HepG2 cells (as a positive control). Untreated H1 cells and Ctrl CM-treated H1 cells lacked the proteins, and β-actin levels showed equal loading (Fig. 1G). To assess whether this Wnt pathway-induced differentiation is a universal phenomenon or unique to the ESCs tested, we performed the same experiment using multiple mouse and human ESCs. Indeed, we observed that sustained Wnt pathway activation induced meso/endoderm-specific differentiation of multiple human (HuES 6, 7, 8, and 9) and mouse (D3, CS, V6.4) ESCs (supplemental Fig. 2, A-E). Thus, sustained activation of the Wnt pathway induces meso/endodermal differentiation of mouse and human ESCs. Active Wnt Signaling Enhances Endothelial Differentiation—The Wnt pathway is implicated to play a role in differentiation of the vascular and hematopoietic and cardiovascular system (6Maretto S. Kim M. Dupont S. Braghetta P. Broccoli V. Hassan A.B. Volpin D. Bressan G.M. Piccolo S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3299-3304Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar, 24Li F. Kim Z.Z. Maiese K. Histol. Histopathol. 2006; 21: 103-124PubMed Google Scholar). Given our results that the Wnt pathway induces meso/endoderm, we hypothesized that activation of the Wnt pathway would impart upon ESCs an enhanced potential to differentiate along these lineages. We compared the potential of untreated and Wnt pathway-activated E14 cells to differentiate along endothelial lineage by performing endothelial sprout assays (see “Experimental Procedures”). About 10% of the EBs formed from untreated E14 cells formed endothelial sprouts (Fig. 1H). In contrast, Wnt pathway-activated cells displayed the significantly increased (50-70%) potential to form endothelial sprouts (Fig. 1H). To assess whether the endothelial sprout formation efficiency can be improved further, we decided to isolate single cell clones from the population of Wnt pathway-activated cells. Isolation and Characterization of MPCs from Mouse ESCs—We isolated single cell clones from long term iGSK-3β-treated E14 cells to assess differences in differentiation potential represented by the individual cells. Single cell clones, hereafter referred to as MPCs, were stably maintained in the presence of iGSK-3β over a year. MPCs have slightly reduced growth rate as compared with undifferentiated ESCs. In contrast to the typical ESC colony morphology where cells are tightly packed, MPCs grow as flat monolayer colonies, and individual cells containing nuclei within a colony were easily discernable (Fig. 2A). Reduced alkaline phosphatase staining intensity indicated possible loss of pluripotency of MPCs as compared with ESCs (Fig. 2A). We also isolated single cell clones from untreated E14 cells, and molecular analysis of these clones indicated no up-regulation of lineage-specific markers confirming that they are undifferentiated ESCs (data not shown). This observation is important as it shows that MPCs are not an artifact of single cell sorting performed to isolate clones. Molecular analysis on four randomly chosen MPCs indicates that they express a variety of primitive streak markers such as Lefty2, Sprouty2, Wnt3, FGF8, and Nodal (Fig. 2B), and up to 1200-fold induction of Lhx1 was observed (data not shown). In addition, the MPCs express a variety of mesendodermal markers, such as PDGFRα, chordin, CK18 (Fig. 2B), and goosecoid (Fig. 2C) (25Tada S. Kim T. Furusawa C. Sakurai H. Nishikawa S. Kinoshita M. Nakao K. Chiba T. Development (Camb.). 2005; 132: 4363-4374Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Real-time RT-PCR on MPCs indicated a striking (up to 300-fold) induction of meso/endodermal markers such as T-brachyury, Pitx2, Runx1, Runx2, Sox9, AFP, Foxa2, Gata4, and Sox17 (Fig. 2C), which was higher than that observed in the population of E14 cells treated with iGSK-3β (Fig. 1E). Interestingly, the individual MPCs showed variable up-regulation of mesendodermal markers (e.g. only MPCs 23 and 38 have high levels of goosecoid and T-brachyury, and MPCs 31 and 38 have high AFP), which probably reflects their varied differentiation potential (Fig. 2C). As expected, there was minimal, if any, up-regulation of neuroectoderm markers viz NeuroD, Ngn2, Pax6, and Shc3 (Fig. 2C). The up-regulation of transcripts for some of the mesendodermal markers such as goosecoid, Foxa2, Sox17, and T-brachyury was confirmed by immunocytochemical analysis (Fig. 2D). We also assessed the reversible nature of the MPCs by culturing them in the absence of iGSK-3β and performed molecular analysis on markers of differentiation. Culturing MPCs in the absence of the inhibitor led to dramatic reduction in transcript levels for all of the meso/endodermal markers to near ESC levels in 2 weeks (Fig. 2E). This indicated that continuous activation of the Wnt pathway is essential to maintain the MPCs. In Vitro Differentiation of the Mesendodermal Progenitor Clones—We analyzed the differentiation potential of MPCs along the following mesodermal lineages. Endothelial Lineage—We performed RT-PCR analysis to assess whether the MPCs 23 and 38 have transcripts for key endothelial markers as an indication of increased propensity to differentiate along endothelial lineage. Transcripts for Flk-1 and Flt-1, the key receptor tyrosine kinases involved in endothelial cell growth and development, along with α-SMA, VE-Cadherin, PECAM1, and podoplanin were present in the MPCs (Fig. 3A) (26Yamaguchi T.P. Kim D.J. Conlon R.A. Breitman M.L. Rossant J. Development (Camb.). 1993; 118: 489-498Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Shibuya M. Kim S. Yamane A. Ikeda T. Tojo A. Matsushime H. Sato M. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 519-524PubMed Google Scholar, 28Choi K. Kim M. Kazarov A. Papadimitriou J.C. Keller G. Development (Camb.). 1998; 125: 725-732Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Untreated E14 cells had transcripts for PECAM1 and Tie2 only (Fig. 3A), indicating that Wnt pathway activation poises the MPCs to differentiate along endothelial lineage. Molecular analysis further revealed that MPCs 23 and 38 also expressed markers of hematopoietic lineage c-Kit, Scl, β-H1, and β-major, the last two only in MPC 23, and calponin, a vascular smooth muscle (VSM) marker (Fig. 3A) (28Choi K. Kim M. Kazarov A. Papadimitriou J.C. Keller G. Development (Camb.). 1998; 125: 725-732Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Yamashita J. Kim H. Hirashima M. Ogawa M. Nishikawa S. Yurugi T. Naito M. Nakao K. Nature. 2000; 408: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (1157) Google Scholar). A 20-25-fold induction of Runx1, a transcription factor required for hematopoietic stem cell maintenance, was seen in both the MPCs (Fig. 2C) (30Okuda T. Kim J. Hiebert S.W. Grosveld G. Downing J.R. Cell. 1996; 84: 321-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar). Collectively, these results suggested that MPCs 23 and 38 are poised to differentiate along endothelial, hematopoietic, and VSM lineages. Endothelial sprout assays were performed to analyze the endothelial/hematopoietic potential of MPCs. 50-60% EBs formed using MPCs 23 and 38 showed endothelial sprouting in the absence of growth factors, whereas near 100% efficiency of endothelial sprouting was achieved upon the addition of growth factors (Fig. 3B). Results obtained with untreated E14 cells (Fig. 3B) were consistent with the previous experiment (Fig. 1H), i.e. about 10% sprouting in the absence of growth factors. Fig. 3C shows a sprouting EB of MPC 23 as indicated by the long thin outgrowths that branch out from the dense center of the EB. The morphology of the cells in the sprouting EB was somewhat heterogeneous, ranging from large elongated flat cells (of endothelial origin) with fibroblastic morphology (Fig. 3C, black arrows) to relatively small, round cells (of hematopoietic origin) (Fig. 3D, black arrows). To confirm that the elongated flat cells were of endothelial lineage, the sprouting EBs were analyzed by immunofluorescence for cell surface markers indicative of endothelial cells. Fig. 3E shows flat and elongated endothelial-like cells immunostained for Flk-1, Flt-1, PECAM1, CD34, and Tie2 (in red). Molecular analysis on the sprouting EBs showed expression of calponin and vascular SMA (v-SMA), indicative of VSM lineage (Fig. 3F). These observations indicate that MPCs 23 and 38 have increased potential to differentiate into endothelial, hematopoietic, and VSM lineages. Cardiac Lineage—The myocardial, endothelial, and smooth muscle lineages are believed to develop from a common Flk-1-positive progenitor (31Kattman S.J. Kim T.L. Keller G.M. Dev. Cell. 2006; 11: 723-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). The presence of high levels of transcripts of T-brachyury and Flk-1 (Fig. 3, A and B) and the early cardiac markers such as Gata4, Hand1, and Tbx5 (Fig. 4A) in the MPCs 23 and 38 indicated that they are poised to differentiate along cardiac lineage (31Kattman S.J. Kim T.L. Keller G.M. Dev. Cell. 2006; 11: 723-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar, 32Arceci R.J. Kim A.A. Simon M.C. Orkin S.H. Wilson D.B. Mol. Cell.

The potential of MPCs 23, 31, and 38 to differentiate along cardiac lineage was addressed by performing the two-step protocol of hanging drop aggregation followed by plating of equal number of EBs on gelatin-coated dishes (21Boheler K.R. Kim J. Tweedie D. Yang H.T. Anisimov S.V. Wobus A.M. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 189-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). Beating cardiomyocytes were scored on day 6 only if beating was observed in three separate areas of an EB. 15% of the EBs formed by untreated E14 cells showed cardiac potential. EBs formed from MPCs 23 and 38 had up to 70%, whereas MPC 31 had about 35% efficiency of forming beating cardiomyocytes (Fig. 4B). Molecular analysis on the beating EBs was performed to further confirm cardiac differentiation. Hand1, Gata4, Nkx2.5, and Tbx5 markers indicative of primary heart field cells were further up-regulated (Fig. 4C). Up-regulation of Mef2c and myocardin (Fig. 4C), MLC-2a, MLC-2v, and Tbx20 (Fig. 4D), mature cardiomyocytes markers, confirmed cardiac specification (31Kattman S.J. Kim T.L. Keller G.M. Dev.

https://openalex.org/W2074007968,"Many biological databases that provide comparative genomics information and tools are now available on the internet. While certainly quite useful, to our knowledge none of the existing databases combine results from multiple comparative genomics methods with manually curated information from the literature. Here we describe the Princeton Protein Orthology Database (P-POD, http://ortholog.princeton.edu), a user-friendly database system that allows users to find and visualize the phylogenetic relationships among predicted orthologs (based on the OrthoMCL method) to a query gene from any of eight eukaryotic organisms, and to see the orthologs in a wider evolutionary context (based on the Jaccard clustering method). In addition to the phylogenetic information, the database contains experimental results manually collected from the literature that can be compared to the computational analyses, as well as links to relevant human disease and gene information via the OMIM, model organism, and sequence databases. Our aim is for the P-POD resource to be extremely useful to typical experimental biologists wanting to learn more about the evolutionary context of their favorite genes. P-POD is based on the commonly used Generic Model Organism Database (GMOD) schema and can be downloaded in its entirety for installation on one's own system. Thus, bioinformaticians and software developers may also find P-POD useful because they can use the P-POD database infrastructure when developing their own comparative genomics resources and database tools."
https://openalex.org/W2074661356,"The initial prodromal state of psychosis (IPS) is defined as an early disease stage prior to the onset of overt psychosis characterized by sub-threshold or more unspecific psychiatric symptoms. Little is known regarding the biochemical changes during this period.We investigated the metabolic/proteomic profiles of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of first-onset drug naïve paranoid schizophrenia patients (n = 54) and individuals presenting with initial prodromal symptoms (n = 24), alongside healthy volunteers (n = 70) using proton nuclear magnetic resonance ((1)H-NMR) spectroscopy and surface enhanced laser desorption ionization (SELDI) mass spectrometry, respectively. Partial least square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) showed that 36%/29% of IPS patients displayed proteomic/metabolic profiles characteristic of first-onset, drug naïve schizophrenia, i.e., changes in levels of glucose and lactate as well as changes in a VGF-derived peptide (VGF23-62) and transthyretin protein concentrations. However, only 29% (n = 7) of the investigated IPS patients (who to date have been followed up for up to three years) have so far received a diagnosis of schizophrenia. The presence of biochemical alterations in the IPS group did not correlate with the risk to develop schizophrenia.Our results imply that schizophrenia-related biochemical disease processes can be traced in CSF of prodromal patients. However, the biochemical disturbances identified in IPS patients, at least when measured at a single time point, may not be sufficient to predict clinical outcome."
https://openalex.org/W2132814931,"Activation of Myc induces epidermal stem cells to exit their niche and differentiate into sebocytes and interfollicular epidermis, a process that is associated with widespread changes in gene transcription. We have identified chromatin modifications that are characteristic of epidermal stem cells and investigated the effects of Myc activation. Quiescent stem cells in the interfollicular epidermis and the hair follicle bulge had high levels of tri-methylated histone H3 at lysine 9 and H4 at lysine 20. Chromatin in both stem cell populations was hypoacteylated at histone H4 and lacked mono-methylation of histone H4 at lysine 20. Myc-induced exit from the stem cell niche correlated with increased acetylation at histone H4 and transiently increased mono-methylation at lysine 20. The latter was replaced by epigenetic modifications that are largely associated with chromatin silencing: di-methylation at histone H3 lysine 9 and histone H4 lysine 20. These modifications correlated with changes in the specific histone methyltransferases Set8 and Ash-1. The Myc-induced switch from mono- to di-methylated H4K20 required HDAC activity and was blocked by the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA). TSA treatment induced a similar epidermal phenotype to activation of Myc, and activation of Myc in the presence of TSA resulted in massive stimulation of terminal differentiation. We conclude that Myc-induced chromatin modifications play a major role in Myc-induced exit from the stem cell compartment."
https://openalex.org/W2087530259,"Glioma cells prominently express a unique splice variant of a large conductance, calcium-activated potassium channel (BK channel). These channels transduce changes in intracellular calcium to changes of K+ conductance in the cells and have been implicated in growth control of normal and malignant cells. The Ca2+ increase that facilitates channel activation is thought to occur via activation of intracellular calcium release pathways or influx of calcium through Ca2+-permeable ion channels. We show here that BK channel activation involves the activation of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptors (IP3R), which localize near BK channels in specialized membrane domains called lipid rafts. Disruption of lipid rafts with methyl-β-cyclodextrin disrupts the functional association of BK channel and calcium source resulting in a >50% reduction in K+ conductance mediated by BK channels. The reduction of BK current by lipid raft disruption was overcome by the global elevation of intracellular calcium through inclusion of 750 nm Ca2+ in the pipette solution, indicating that neither the calcium sensitivity of the channel nor their overall number was altered. Additionally, pretreatment of glioma cells with 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate to inhibit IP3Rs negated the effect of methyl-β-cyclodextrin, providing further support that IP3Rs are the calcium source for BK channels. Taken together, these data suggest a privileged association of BK channels in lipid raft domains and provide evidence for a novel coupling of these Ca2+-sensitive channels to their second messenger source.

Gliomas are primary brain malignancies that derive from glial cells. These tumors are characterized by extensive cell migration and diffuse infiltration of normal brain making surgical removal almost impossible. Accumulating evidence indicates that glioma migration is supported by the activity of K+ and Cl- channels (1Kraft R. Kim P. Jung S. Basrai D. Liebmann L. Bolz J. Patt S.

Specifically, ion flux through Cl- and K+ channels along with obligated water is presumed to cause the profound changes in cell shape and cell volume as cells invade. In this vein, our laboratory, as well as others, has attempted to identify and characterize the underlying ion channels involved in this process. This led us to the molecular cloning of a novel large conductance calcium-activated K+ (BK) channel that is uniquely expressed in glioma cells and particularly up-regulated in highly invasive grade IV gliomas (6Liu X. Kim Y. Reinhart P.H. Sontheimer H. Chang Y. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 1840-1849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A unique feature of BK channels is the ability to be activated by two independent stimuli, namely membrane voltage and the intracellular second messenger Ca2+, whereas typical K+ channels are gated by voltage alone. Hence cell volume changes are likely to result from the activation of BK channels via changes in intracellular [Ca2+]. In the absence of large increases in [Ca2+]i, BK channel activation requires very large depolarization of the membrane (approximately +80 mV), which is expected to be an uncommon occurrence in a nonexcitable cell such as a glioma cell.

Kim X. Sontheimer H. Glia. 2002; 38: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar)). Physiological conditions that raise Ca2+ throughout the cell sufficiently to activate glioma BK channels yet without compromising other Ca2+-dependent processes are difficult to envision. One way to solve this problem is by localizing BK channels in close proximity to a Ca2+ source, i.e. a Ca2+ channel, Ca2+-permeable receptor, or intracellular release pathway. Such a privileged association may be achieved through direct protein-protein interactions as has been demonstrated in rat brain where BK channels are linked to L-type voltage-gated calcium channels (10Grunnet M. Kim W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36445-36453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Alternatively, privileged associations may occur through localization to membrane microdomains. Microdomains can be established through specialized membrane patches in the plasma membrane enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids, and these are called lipid rafts (11Simons K. Kim E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8117) Google Scholar). The existence of such raft domains within the plasma membrane and the idea that microdomains within the plasma membrane are suitable for the assembly of signaling complexes are now well accepted (for review see Ref. 12Simons K. Kim D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5164) Google Scholar). Lipid rafts have been demonstrated to participate in protein trafficking and the assembly of signaling complexes, and indeed, a number of ion channels have been shown to localize to lipid raft domains. These include, for example, cardiac pacemaker channels, KCa channels, L-type voltage-gated calcium channels, Kv, Kir, as well as Na+ channels, and in most instances, channel association with lipid rafts directly affects the biophysical properties of these channels (13Delling M.

Similarly, KCa, KATP, P2X receptors, cyclic nucleotide-gated channels, and transient receptor potential channels (TRPC) 2The abbreviations used are: TRPC, transient receptor potential channel; IP3R, inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor; MβCD, methyl-β-cyclodextrin; 2-APB, 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate; LR, lipid rafts; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; IP3, inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate; VGCC, voltage-gated calcium channel; ACh, acetylcholine; mAChR, muscarinic acetylcholine receptor; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate. all localize to lipid rafts as part of signaling complexes (16Lockwich T.P.

In light of these findings and a hypothesized requirement for glioma BK channels to localize closely to a source for Ca2+ entry or release, we set out to investigate whether BK channels in glioma cells may localize to microdomains and whether these may be established by lipid rafts. Using biophysical and biochemical methods, we indeed demonstrate that glioma BK channels localize preferentially to lipid raft microdomains where they assemble in proximity to the IP3R and respond to IP3-mediated intracellular calcium release. As a consequence, physiological activation of BK channels occurs via muscarinic acetylcholine receptors but only when lipid raft coupling of BK channels and IP3Rs is intact. Cell Culture and Drugs—The glioma cell lines D54-MG and U251-MG (World Health Organization, grade IV, glioblastoma multiforme) were a gift from Dr. D. Bigner (Duke University, Durham, NC). Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (Media Tech, University of Alabama at Birmingham Media Preparation Facility) supplemented with 2 mm glutamine (Media Tech) and 7% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), at 37 °C and 10% CO2. Unless otherwise stated, all reagents were purchased from Sigma, and stock solutions were made according to manufacturer's instructions. Methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) was made fresh daily by resuspending in either bath solution or media at a concentration of 5 mg/ml. Drug Treatment—For all experiments using MβCD, treatment was carried out as follows. MβCD, at a concentration of 5 mg/ml, was resuspended in either Normal Bath solution or media lacking serum. In the case of electrophysiology experiments, MβCD was added to the bath and perfused onto cells for a total of 15 min. For all other experiments, cells were washed two times with serum-free media to ensure that any noncellular cholesterol was removed, and then MβCD-containing media were added to the cells for 15 min. Cells were then immediately used for experiments. Electrophysiology—Recordings of whole cell currents were made using an Axopatch 200A amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) following standard recording techniques (20Hamill O.P. Kim A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pfluegers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15149) Google Scholar). For both perforated patch and whole cell patch recordings, patch pipettes were made with thin walled borosilicate glass (World Precision Instruments (TW150F-4), Sarasota, FL) using an upright puller (Narishige Instruments (PP-830), Tokyo, Japan), and had resistances of 3-5 megohms. Current recordings were digitized on line at 10 kHz and low pass filtered at 2 kHz using a Digidata 1200 (Axon Instruments). pClamp 8.2 (Axon Instruments) was used to acquire and store data. Series resistance (Rs) was compensated to 80%, reducing voltage errors, and cells with a compensated Rs above 10 megohms were omitted. U251 cells were plated on glass coverslips and allowed to adhere overnight. Cells were used between 1 and 4 days in culture Solutions—Our standard bath solution consisted of the following (in mm): 125 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1.2 MgSO4, 1 CaCl, 1.6 Na2HPO4, 0.4 NaH2PO4, 10.5 glucose, and 32.5 Hepes acid; pH was adjusted to 7.4 using NaOH, and osmolarity was ∼300 mosm. MβCD (5 mg/ml) was added directly to the bath solution. Pipette solutions contained the following (in mm): 145 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 10 EGTA, 10 Hepes sodium salt, pH adjusted to 7.3 with Tris base. CaCl2 was added directly to pipette solution the day of use at a concentration of 0.2 mm resulting in a free Ca2+ concentration of 1.9 nm. For perforated patch recordings, pipette solution also contained amphotericin B (240 μg/ml) and 50 μm Alexa Fluor 488 (Molecular Probes, Carlsbad, CA). Standard bath solution was continuously exchanged at a rate of ∼1 ml/min. Lipid Raft Isolation—The entire process was carried out at 4 °C. Following treatment with either SF media (control) or SF media with 5 mg/ml MβCD, confluent cultures of cells were washed two times in cold PBS. Cells were collected in PBS containing protease inhibitors by scraping and centrifuged for 5 min at 12,000 × g. The supernatant was aspirated, and cells were resuspended in 500 μl of PBS and mechanically homogenized. Protein concentrations were determined using the DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) according to manufacturer's instructions. After determining protein concentration, all samples were diluted to the same concentration (typically 1 mg/ml) and same volume to allow for comparison between samples. Lysates were then centrifuged for 1 h at 5000 rpm, and the supernatant was transferred to another tube and labeled the “water-soluble” fraction. The remaining pellet was resuspended in cold lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100 in TNE buffer: 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA) and incubated on ice for 15 min with occasional vortexing. The water-insoluble fraction was then centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 30 min. The supernatant was removed and labeled the “detergent-soluble” fraction. The pellet was then resuspended in a 40% Optiprep solution (60% stock Optiprep diluted in TNE) and placed in an ultracentrifuge tube. 3.5 ml of a 30% Optiprep solution were then layered on top of the 40% layer. Finally, 0.5 ml of a 5% Optiprep solution was layered on top. The tubes were then weighed to ensure that they were balanced, and the samples were spun in an Beckman Ultracentrifuge using the SW-60 swinging bucket rotor at 36,000 rpm for 16 h at 4 °C. Following centrifugation, 500-μl fractions were collected from the top to the bottom of each sample and numbered 1-9. Samples were then loaded onto a 4-20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel and run according to the Western blotting protocol. Western Blotting—Following either the lipid raft isolation or biotinylation protocol, 15 μl of each of the 11 samples (WS, DS, and fractions 1-9) were added to 3 μl of 6× sample buffer (60% glycerol, 300 nm Tris, pH 6.8, 12 mm EDTA, 12% SDS, 864 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.05% bromphenol blue) and loaded into their own individual well of a 4-20% gradient pre-cast SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad). Protein separation was performed at a constant 100 V for ∼90 min. Gels were then transferred at 200 mA for 110 min at room temperature onto polyvinylidene difluoride paper (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Membranes were blocked in blocking buffer (5% nonfat dried milk, 2% bovine serum albumin, 2% normal goat serum in TBS plus 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST)). The primary antibodies anti-Cav-1 (sc-894, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and anti-BK (Alomone, Jerusalem, Israel) were used at dilutions of 1:100 and 1:500, respectively. Blots were incubated in primary antibody for 1 h followed by a wash period (four times for 5 min). Membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h, followed by another wash period (four times for 5 min) and developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Biosciences) on Hyperfilm (Amersham Biosciences). Biotinylation—The entire process was carried out at 4 °C. Cells were washed twice in standard bath solution containing 1 mm Ca2+. After washing, sulfo-NHS-biotin (1.5 mg/ml; Pierce) was added and allowed to incubate for 30 min with occasional gentle rocking. Biotinylation was quenched by washing cells twice with standard bath solution containing 100 mm glycine plus an additional 15-min wash. Cells were then rinsed once in bath solution, collected, spun down, and resuspended in 0.5 ml of RIPA buffer supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (1:100; Sigma). Suspension was rotated for 30 min followed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 5 min. At this point protein concentration was measured, and 10 μg of protein was set aside as total lysate. The remainder of the sample was incubated with agarose-streptavidin beads (400-μl beads/ml supernatant; Pierce) for 2 h. Once again beads were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 s, and the supernatant (representing the unbound fraction) was collected. The beads were gently washed four times with RIPA Buffer and resuspended in 100 mm glycine, pH 2.8, for 3 min with occasional vortexing to separate surface protein from the beads. Sample buffer was added immediately to neutralize pH. In the few cases where sample buffer was not enough to neutralize pH (as evidenced by a yellowish color), one drop of 1 n NaOH was added. Additionally, 6× sample buffer was added to the total lysate fraction, and all three samples were loaded onto a 4-20% gradient pre-cast SDS-polyacrylamide gel, separated, and transferred according to the Western protocol. All blots were probed with anti-actin (1:1000) as a negative control to ensure that the surface protein fraction was not contaminated with intracellular protein, and anti-Na+,K+-ATPase (1:1000, Abcam, Cambridge, MA) was used as a positive control to denote that we had, indeed, isolated the membrane fraction. Immunocytochemistry—Cells were cultured on coverslips (12-mm round; Macalaster Bicknell, New Haven, CT) for 1-3 days. Cells were subsequently treated for 15 min in either SF media or SF media containing MβCD (5 mg/ml). After washing cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were then washed twice in PBS and blocked and permeabilized in PBS containing 0.3% Triton and 5% normal goat serum for 30 min. Once again, cells were washed in PBS containing 5% normal goat serum and incubated overnight with primary antibodies at 4 °C. The following day, cells were washed four times in PBS and labeled with secondary antibodies for 1 h in the dark. After labeling, cells were washed with PBS and incubated with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole for 5 min. Cells were washed two more times and mounted onto slides with Gel/Mount (Biomedia Corp., Forest City, CA). ×63 images were acquired with a Zeiss Axiovert 200 M (Göttingen, Germany). Migration Assay—The day before the experiment was performed, an ∼70% confluent dish of U251 cells were rinsed and supplied with serum-free media overnight. Cell culture inserts (BD Biosciences) with 8-μm pores were coated overnight with Vitronectin (BD Biosciences) at a concentration of 5 μg/ml in PBS. The following day, inserts were washed two times with PBS and blocked with 1% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin for 1 h. Inserts were then washed two times in PBS, and 400 μl of Migration Assay Buffer (MAB, 0.1% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin in serum-free media) was added to the bottom of each well. Cells were rinsed once in PBS and were lifted off the dish by the addition of 0.5 mm EGTA for ∼20 min. U251 cells were rinsed twice by centrifugation and resuspended in MAB and counted. Forty thousand cells were plated on top of each filter and allowed to adhere for 30 min before drug was added. After addition of drug, cells were allowed to migrate for 5 h. Filters were then fixed and stained with Crystal Violet, and the tops were wiped clean of cells, and representative fields (five per filter) were counted with a Zeiss Axiovert 200 M microscope with a 10× objective. Data Analysis—Results were analyzed using Origin (version 6.0, MicroCal Software, Northhampton, MA) and Excel 2000 (Microsoft, Seattle). Significance was determined by one-way analysis of variance because all data showed normal distribution. All data reported are mean ± S.E., and * denotes p < 0.05 unless otherwise stated. BK Channels in Glioma Cell Lines Localize to Lipid Raft Domains—The central hypothesis examined by this study is that glioma BK channels localize to privileged membrane subregions or microdomains where sufficient local changes in [Ca2+]i can be achieved to allow channel activation in response to physiological stimuli as cells invade. We further hypothesized that these microdomains may be established through privileged membrane regions termed lipid rafts (LRs). In a first series of experiments, we examined the possible association of BK channels with LRs in glioma cells by labeling cells in culture with antibodies directed against the Maxi K+ α-subunit and three common lipid raft markers, specifically caveolin-1, flotillin, and a fluorescently conjugated cholera toxin B subunit, which binds to GM1 ganglioside, a common component of lipid rafts (21Orlandi P.A. Kim P.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 905-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). Representative examples from two different cell lines, one (GBM-62) derived directly from a patient biopsy, are shown in Fig. 1. In both cell lines, BK channel immunoreactivity is found diffusely throughout the cell. In addition, however, both BK channels and each of the LR proteins caveolin-1 (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. 1A) and flotillin (Fig. 1B and supplemental Fig. 1B) as well as the cholera toxin B subunit (Fig. 1C and supplemental Fig. 1C) appeared to be found in hot spots at the protruding edges of the cell. The cells in Fig. 1B appeared to have been migrating away from one another probably having just recently divided. Interestingly, the BK and LR hotspots in both of these cells seem to localize to the leading edge, or lamellipodia, of each cell, indicating that these channels may associate with LRs in distinct regions in migratory cells. These immunocytochemical stainings suggest that BK channels may indeed be found in lipid raft microdomains in glioma cells. To further verify this association, we examined this question biochemically. To do this we adapted a well described lipid raft isolation protocol (22Rujoi M. Kim J. Borchman D. Tang D. Yappert M.C. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2003; 44: 1634-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) that separates whole cell lysates into water, detergent-soluble, and detergent-insoluble fractions at 4 °C based on their relative solubilities in aqueous solutions with or without detergent. Based on this isolation technique, as described in greater detail under “Experimental Procedures,” cytosolic constituents were isolated in the water-soluble fraction (Fig. 2A, W) because they exist in an aqueous environment in the cell. Following removal of the cytosolic fraction, we were left primarily with membrane and cytoskeletal elements that we further dissociated into a detergent-soluble fraction (Fig. 2A, D) containing membrane-associated proteins capable of being solubilized in Triton X-100 and detergent-insoluble proteins. The detergent-insoluble fraction consists of cytoskeletal proteins as well as proteins associated with regions of the membrane exhibiting a large enough concentration of lipid to render them insoluble in detergent at 4 °C, i.e. lipid rafts. The remaining proteins were further separated into 9 fractions by discontinuous gradient centrifugation. All 11 isolated fractions were run on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and then Western-blotted to probe for both lipid raft markers and BK channels. As depicted in Fig. 2A, caveolin-1 (Cav-1), a common lipid raft-associated protein used to biochemically define the lipid raft containing gradient fractions, was found in the second density gradient fraction. This lane was herein referred to as the lipid raft fraction because lipid rafts are buoyant and thus their constituents are typically found in the less dense fractions of the gradient. In addition to precipitating in the 2nd detergent-insoluble fraction, a portion of Cav-1 was also found in the detergent-soluble lane likely consisting in part of protein not yet trafficked to the membrane and to partial solubilization of a small amount of lipid rafts. Importantly, these were the two fractions that also contain BK channels further suggesting that BK channels associate with the caveolar lipid raft fraction and consistent with our immunocytochemistry data (Fig. 1 and Fig. 2B). To address the importance of lipid rafts for the clustered localization of BK channels to specialized membrane regions, we next experimentally disrupted lipid rafts. For this purpose we used methyl-β-cyclodextrin, a member of the cyclodextrin family of cyclic oligosaccharides consisting of seven glucopyranose units. This family of molecules is commonly used as a solubilizing agent for molecules that are, alone, insoluble in aqueous solutions. MβCD is the most commonly used member of the family, and its ability to solubilize cholesterol in aqueous solutions has been well documented (23Hartel S. Kim H.A. Ojeda F. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 258: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Several studies have shown that MβCD, in addition to being able to solubilize cholesterol, can also actively remove and sequester cholesterol from membrane (24Christian A.E. Kim M.P. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 2264-2272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Kilsdonk E.P. Kim P.G. Stoudt G.W. Bangerter F.W. Johnson W.J. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. J. Biol.

Investig. 1997; 99: 773-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). To demonstrate its usefulness as an LR-disrupting agent, U251 glioma cells were treated with MβCD at a concentration of 5 mg/ml for 15 min at 37 °C prior to performing the same biochemical and immunocytochemical assays described above. As shown in Fig. 2A, treatment with MβCD resulted in a complete shift of BK channel protein from the lipid raft fraction to the detergent-soluble fraction of the membrane. Likewise, immunostaining of Cav-1 and BK channels (Fig. 2B) illustrates that BK channel and Cav-1 protein coexist in an ordered arrangement with both proteins being found in hot spots on the lamellipodia and in perinuclear regions indicative of endoplasmic reticulum localization. However, immunostaining of cells treated with MβCD demonstrated a redistribution of channels in the membrane, disrupting the tight organization found under normal conditions indicating that MβCD does indeed interrupt an association between BK channels and lipid rafts. Furthermore, immunolabeling of U251 glioma cells with phalloidin illustrates no difference in the distribution of actin filaments following MβCD treatment. This indicates that MβCD does not interfere with the intracellular actin architecture. Lipid Raft Disruption Reduces Whole Cell BK Currents—To examine whether the BK channel association with LRs has any functional significance, we next performed electrophysiological experiments before and after acute disruption of lipid rafts. Specifically we recorded whole cell BK currents in glioma cells while continuously bath-applying MβCD (5 mg/ml) for a total of 15 min. A representative example of one such experiment before and after 15 min of MβCD is illustrated in Fig. 3A. Cells were voltage-clamped at -40 mV, and BK currents were activated by stepping the membrane in 20-mV increments to +180 mV before and after application of MβCD. To verify that the MβCD effect was unique to BK currents, we recorded inward currents mediated by Kir channels in U251 cells, which were activated by stepping the membrane to negative potentials between -160 and +20 mV following a 200-ms prepulse at 0 mV. As shown in the representative traces in Fig. 3A, following 15 min of MβCD treatment, BK currents were reduced by ∼50%, whereas Kir currents were unaffected. Cumulative data from 13 cells for BK currents and 10 cells for Kir currents are shown in Fig. 3, B and C, respectively. As is evident in the raw traces, treatment with MβCD selectively reduced whole cell BK currents without affecting Kir currents in the same cell, ruling out nonspecific effects of the drug and, importantly, suggesting that intact LRs may be required for maximal BK channel function. Lipid Raft Disruption Does Not Cause Channel Internalization or Alter Ca2+ Sensitivity of the Channel—The above illustrated whole cell recordings were all conducted 15 min following MβCD treatment. To determine the time course of the MβCD-induced reduction in whole cell BK currents in more detail, we performed whole cell voltage clamp recordings as described above using only a single step to +140 mV from a holding potential of -40 mV every 30 s for a 15-min period. Fig. 4A shows a representative example in which the peak BK current recorded in response to a voltage step to 140 mV was normalized at every given time point to the starting value, preceding the application of MβCD. As is clearly evident from this plot, MβCD caused a rapid decrease in BK currents that reached a maximum in approximately 5 min after which current amplitudes remained relatively constant for the duration of the experiment. This rapid time course of MβCD-induced BK current reduction may indicate that either BK channels are being rapidly internalized, as l"
https://openalex.org/W1995404574,"Background Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) IIIB (Sanfilippo Syndrome type B) is caused by a deficiency in the lysosomal enzyme N-acetyl-glucosaminidase (Naglu). Children with MPS IIIB develop disturbances of sleep, activity levels, coordination, vision, hearing, and mental functioning culminating in early death. The murine model of MPS IIIB demonstrates lysosomal distention in multiple tissues, a shortened life span, and behavioral changes. Principal Findings To more thoroughly assess MPS IIIB in mice, alterations in circadian rhythm, activity level, motor function, vision, and hearing were tested. The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) developed pathologic changes and locomotor analysis showed that MPS IIIB mice start their daily activity later and have a lower proportion of activity during the night than wild-type controls. Rotarod assessment of motor function revealed a progressive inability to coordinate movement in a rocking paradigm. Purkinje cell counts were significantly reduced in the MPS IIIB animals compared to age matched controls. By electroretinography (ERG), MPS IIIB mice had a progressive decrease in the amplitude of the dark-adapted b-wave response. Corresponding pathology revealed shortening of the outer segments, thinning of the outer nuclear layer, and inclusions in the retinal pigmented epithelium. Auditory-evoked brainstem responses (ABR) demonstrated progressive hearing deficits consistent with the observed loss of hair cells in the inner ear and histologic abnormalities in the middle ear. Conclusions/Significance The mouse model of MPS IIIB has several quantifiable phenotypic alterations and is similar to the human disease. These physiologic and histologic changes provide insights into the progression of this disease and will serve as important parameters when evaluating various therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2056148985,"Mixed lineage kinase 3 (MLK3) is a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase member that activates the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway. Aberrant activation of MLK3 has been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases. Similarly, glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3β has also been shown to activate JNK and contribute to neuronal apoptosis. Here, we show a functional interaction between MLK3 and GSK-3β during nerve growth factor (NGF) withdrawal-induced cell death in PC-12 cells. The protein kinase activities of GSK-3β, MLK3, and JNK were increased upon NGF withdrawal, which paralleled increased cell death in NGF-deprived PC-12 cells. NGF withdrawal-induced cell death and MLK3 activation were blocked by a GSK-3β-selective inhibitor, kenpaullone. However, the MLK family inhibitor, CEP-11004, although preventing PC-12 cell death, failed to inhibit GSK-3β activation, indicating that induction of GSK-3β lies upstream of MLK3. In GSK-3β-deficient murine embryonic fibroblasts, ultraviolet light was unable to activate MLK3 kinase activity, a defect that was restored upon ectopic expression of GSK-3β. The activation of MLK3 by GSK-3β occurred via phosphorylation of MLK3 on two amino acid residues, Ser789 and Ser793, that are located within the C-terminal regulatory domain of MLK3. Furthermore, the cell death induced by GSK-3β was mediated by MLK3 in a manner dependent on its phosphorylation of the specific residues within the C-terminal domain by GSK-3β. Taken together, our data provide a direct link between GSK-3β and MLK3 activation in a neuronal cell death pathway and identify MLK3 as a direct downstream target of GSK-3β.

JNK is stimulated by pro-inflammatory cytokines, oxidative stress, growth factor deprivation, heat shock, UV, γ-radiation, and other cellular stress (1Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 807-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (2897) Google Scholar, 2Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3666) Google Scholar). The signals in the stress-activated JNK pathway are transmitted via three core protein kinase modules: MAP3K, MAP2K, and MAPK. In the JNK pathway, the activating stimuli activate the MAP3K members, such as members of mixed lineage kinases (MLKs) or MEKKs, which, in turn, phosphorylate MAP2K members such as SEK1/MKK4 and MKK7 (5Rana A.

Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 663-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). The activated MAP2Ks then phosphorylate JNK at a tyrosine and threonine residue leading to activation and phosphorylation of transcription factors, such as, c-Jun, ELK1, and ATF2. The phosphorylated transcription factors bind to their cognate DNA targets and modulate gene transcription and cellular fate. MLKs are members of a significant MAP3K family and have been implicated in neuronal cell death pathways (7Maroney A.C. Finn J.P. Connors T.J. Durkin J.T. Angeles T. Gessner G. Xu Z. Meyer S.L.

Biol. 2002; 3: 663-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that ectopic expression of MLK3 or NGF withdrawal causes neuronal cell death, which is blocked by treatment with a small molecule inhibitor of MLKs, CEP-1347 (7Maroney A.C. Finn J.P. Connors T.J. Durkin J.T. Angeles T. Gessner G. Xu Z. Meyer S.L. Savage M.J. Greene L.A. Scott R.W. Vaught J.L. J. Biol.

Similarly, CEP-11004, an analog of CEP-1347, has also been shown to have neuroprotective roles in NGF withdrawal-induced cell death (11Murakata C. Kaneko M. Gessner G. Angeles T.S. Ator M.A. O'Kane T.M. McKenna B.A. Thomas B.A. Mathiasen J.R. Saporito M.S. Bozyczko-Coyne D. Hudkins R.L. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2002; 12: 147-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Previously, we showed that cell death induced by MLK3 activation is attenuated by insulin via PI3K-AKT pathway activation (12Barthwal M.K. Sathyanarayana P. Kundu C.N. Rana B. Pradeep A. Sharma C. Woodgett J.R. Rana A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3897-3902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The cell survival protein AKT/PKB directly phosphorylates Ser674 in the C-terminal regulatory domain of MLK3. The phosphorylation of MLK3 by AKT attenuates MLK3 kinase and its cell death induction properties (12Barthwal M.K. Sathyanarayana P. Kundu C.N. Rana B. Pradeep A. Sharma C. Woodgett J.R. Rana A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3897-3902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). β-Amyloid peptide has been implicated in promoting neuronal loss during Alzheimer's disease (13Gandy S. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 1121-1129PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition of MLKs by CEP-1347 can prevent neuronal cell death, evoked by β-amyloid peptide (14Troy C.M. Rabacchi S.A. Xu Z.

These results indicate a significant and a direct role of MLKs in controlling a major cell death promoting pathway. However, the detailed mechanism by which different effectors modulate MLK3 activity and regulate cell death is poorly defined. Analogous to MLKs, GSK-3β activation also promotes neuronal cell death (16Pap M. Cooper G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19929-19932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar, 17Jope R.S. Johnson G.V. Trends Biochem.

Hernandez F. Gomez-Ramos P. Moran M.A. Hen R. Avila J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 27-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). It has been shown that NGF withdrawal-induced cell death in PC-12 cells can be ameliorated by the GSK-3 inhibitor, lithium (18Grimes C.A. Jope R.S. Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 65: 391-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (1319) Google Scholar, 21Bhat R.V. Shanley J. Correll M.P. Fieles W.E. Keith R.A. Scott C.W. Lee C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11074-11079Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). GSK-3β has also been shown to activate the JNK pathway through MEKK1 activation (22Kim J.W. Lee J.E. Kim M.J. Cho E.G. Cho S.G. Choi E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13995-14001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Neurons subjected to severe apoptotic paradigms such as serum deprivation, combined with exposure to an N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist or treatment with PI3K inhibitors, exhibit elevated GSK-3β activation, followed by induction of apoptosis (23Hetman M. Cavanaugh J.E. Kimelman D. Xia Z. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2567-2574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar to MLKs, β-amyloid peptide also activates GSK-3β kinase activity and induces cell death (24Takashima A. Honda T. Yasutake K. Michel G. Murayama O. Murayama M. Ishiguro K. Yamaguchi H. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 31: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 25Takashima A. Noguchi K. Michel G. Mercken M. Hoshi M. Ishiguro K. Imahori K. Neurosci. Lett. 1996; 203: 33-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar); this effect is attenuated by lithium treatment (26Hoshi M. Sato M. Matsumoto S. Noguchi A. Yasutake K. Yoshida N. Sato K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6370-6375Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). These results indicate that GSK-3β, which is an important enzyme for glucose metabolism and transcriptional regulation, also plays an important role in cell death pathways. However, the detailed mechanism by which GSK-3β activation induces neuronal cell death and the functional relationship, if any, between GSK-3β and MLK3 in cell death pathway remain to be determined. In this study, we demonstrate that MLK3 is a direct substrate of GSK-3β, and their functional interaction is regulated by apoptotic stimuli (i.e. NGF withdrawal) in PC-12 cells. This regulatory event that is induced by GSK-3β has measurable consequences on MLK3 downstream signaling, including activation of JNK and apoptosis. Our data also suggest that MLK3 is a cellular target of GSK-3β and raises the possibility that under pathophysiological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, neuronal loss may be controlled by directly inhibiting MLK3 kinase activity using small molecule inhibitors. Cell Culture—PC-12 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated horse serum and 5% fetal bovine serum, as described earlier (9Xu Z. Maroney A.C. Dobrzanski P. Kukekov N.V. Greene L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4713-4724Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). PC-12 cells were differentiated for 5–7 days in RPMI containing 0.2% fetal bovine serum and 50 ng/ml of 2.5S-NGF (Promega, Madison, WI). Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK-293) cells, GSK-3β-deficient (GSK-3β–/–), and normal mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum as described earlier (27Hoeflich K.P. Luo J. Rubie E.A. Tsao M.S. Jin O. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 2000; 406: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1228) Google Scholar). Transfection and Treatments—HEK-293 and MEFs were transfected with the appropriate expression vectors, as indicated, using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Kenpaullone (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) and CEP-11004 (kind gift from Cephalon, PA) pretreatments were given for the indicated time periods before starting the NGF withdrawal. Apoptosis was induced by washing the cells with NGF-free medium and was accelerated by the addition of anti-NGF antibodies (1:1000) (Sigma). Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblot Analyses—HEK-293, PC-12, and MEFs were lysed in lysis buffer as described earlier (5Rana A. Gallo K. Godowski P. Hirai S. Ohno S. Zon L. Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19025-19028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The cell extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 5 min, and the protein contents were measured using Bradford method. Immunoprecipitation and glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull downs were performed either by specific antibodies or glutathione-Sepharose (GSH) beads. The immunoprecipitates were washed thoroughly and processed either for immunoblotting or kinase assay. For immunoblotting, equal protein content of cell extracts or the immunoprecipitated protein samples were taken. The proteins were separated on denaturing SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and blotted with antibodies as indicated. The antibodies used were: JNK (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA), GST (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), HA tag (BAbCO), cleaved caspase-3 (Cell Signaling Technology), and GSK-3β (BD Biosciences). Antibody for immunoprecipitating endogenous JNK was provided by Dr. Joseph Avruch (Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA). For immunoprecipitating endogenous MLK3, antibody against the C-terminal peptide of the protein was developed in the laboratory as described earlier (12Barthwal M.K. Sathyanarayana P. Kundu C.N.

Kinase Assays—GSK-3β kinase assay was done as described elsewhere (29Yost C. Torres M. Miller J.R. Huang E. Kimelman D. Moon R.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1443-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar), using GST-β-catenin as the substrate. MLK3 kinase assay was performed using GST-SEK1 (K-R) as the substrate as described earlier (5Rana A. Gallo K. Godowski P. Hirai S. Ohno S. Zon L. Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19025-19028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). For in vitro kinase assay, prokaryotic recombinant proteins were expressed and purified as described earlier (5Rana A. Gallo K. Godowski P. Hirai S. Ohno S. Zon L. Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19025-19028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The purified GSK-3β (active kinase) was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Metabolic 32P Labeling—Transfected HEK-293 cells were transferred to phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing [32P]orthophosphate (100 μCi/ml) (Perkin Elmer Life Sciences) and were incubated for 3 h as described earlier (12Barthwal M.K.

Plasmids and Site-directed Mutagenesis—GSK-3β (WT) and GSK-3β (K-A) constructs were used as reported earlier (27Hoeflich K.P. Luo J. Rubie E.A. Tsao M.S. Jin O. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 2000; 406: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1228) Google Scholar, 30Stambolic V. Ruel L. Woodgett J.R. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1664-1668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All MLK3 constructs were generated in the laboratory by PCR and subcloning. Site-directed mutagenesis of human MLK3 was performed with a QuikChange™ kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The MLK3 T680A, S789A, and S793A mutants were generated with the oligonucleotide 5′-CAACACCCCCCgCGCCAACGCCCGCG-3′, 5′-GGGCCACGGCCTgCTCCCCTGCCATC-3′, 5′-CTCCCCTGCCAgCACCACAGCCTGC-3′ (mismatch with the wild type MLK3 template is indicated by a lowercase letter). The single point mutants were used as a template to generate double and subsequently triple mutants. Mutations were confirmed after sequencing the clones (Davis Sequencing, Davis, CA). Generation of GST-β-Catenin—Full-length β-catenin was subcloned in pGEX4T2 bacterial expression vector between BamH1 and NotI sites. The HA-tagged wild type β-catenin clone was used as a template for PCR amplification. The primers used for full-length β-catenin (amino acids 1–781) were as follows: 5′-CGGGATCCGCCATGGCTACTCAAGCTGATTTGATG-3′ and 5′-ATAGTTTAGCGGCCGCCAGGTCAGTATCAAACCAGGC-3′. Following subcloning of the β-catenin in the pGEX4T2 vector, its GST-fused protein was purified and used as the substrate for in vitro GSK-3β kinase assays. Apoptotic Cell Death—The NGF withdrawal-induced cell death in differentiated PC-12 cells was measured by estimating the mono- and oligonucleosomes specifically released in cytoplasm, using a cell death detection kit following manufacturer's protocol (Roche Applied Science catalog number 1774425) and as described (21Bhat R.V. Shanley J. Correll M.P. Fieles W.E. Keith R.A. Scott C.W. Lee C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11074-11079Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 31Bhat R.V. Leonov S. Luthman J. Scott C.W. Lee C.M. J. Alzheimer's Dis. 2002; 4: 291-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The cell extracts were, in addition, blotted for cleaved and total caspase-3. Cell death was also measured in differentiated PC-12 cells under overexpressed conditions. 2 × 106 differentiated PC-12 cells were transfected with pEGFP-C1 (Promega, WI) along with the vectors encoding the proteins, as indicated, using AMAXA biosystem (AMAXA, Germany) following manufacturer's protocol. Cell death was measured in the GFP-positive cells using DAPI stain. Briefly, the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and subsequently permeablized with 0.1% Triton-X-100 followed by staining with ProLong Gold antifade reagent, containing DAPI (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The DAPI-stained nuclei in GFP-positive cells were analyzed for apoptotic morphology by fluorescence microscopy. The percentage of apoptotic cells was calculated as the number of GFP-positive cells with apoptotic nuclei divided by the total number of GFP-positive cells. NGF Withdrawal Induces GSK-3β, MLK3, and JNK Protein Kinase Activities and Promotes Cell Death in PC-12 Cells—A widely used experimental model of neuronal apoptosis is trophic factor withdrawal-induced cell death in cultured neuronal cells. To examine the effects of trophic factor withdrawal on the protein kinase activities of GSK-3β, MLK3, and JNK and its consequential effect on neuronal cell death, NGF was withdrawn at different time intervals from differentiated PC-12 cell culture medium. NGF depletion was accelerated by adding anti-NGF antibody to the cell culture medium, and the cells were harvested at different time intervals ranging from 30 min to 24 h (Fig. 1). The kinase activities of endogenous JNK, GSK-3β, and MLK3 were determined using specific substrate for each kinase. There was a time-dependent activation of JNK activity (Fig. 1A), which peaked (∼4.5-fold) at 4 h of NGF withdrawal. NGF withdrawal also activated GSK-3β (Fig. 1B) and MLK3 (Fig. 1C) kinase activities in a time-dependent manner. GSK-3β was activated about 4-fold at 4 h of NGF withdrawal, and MLK3 kinase activity also peaked (∼5-fold) at 4 h of withdrawal. To determine whether the activation of JNK, GSK-3β, and MLK3 correlated with NGF withdrawal-induced cell death in PC-12 cells, we measured the kinetics of PC-12 cell death. NGF withdrawal-induced cell death in differentiated PC-12 cells was observed as early as 1 h following withdrawal, which was amplified with the time, and sustained up to 24 h, with a 12–15-fold increase in cell death compared with the control (Fig. 1D) cells. Together, these results indicate a possible correlation between induction of cell death and activation of GSK-3β, JNK, and MLK3 in PC-12. These results also suggest that once the process of cell death is initiated by the activation of these death-associated kinases, it is sustained via modulating downstream effectors of cell death pathways. NGF Withdrawal-induced Cell Death Is Attenuated by MLK3 and GSK-3 Inhibitors—To examine whether NGF withdrawal-induced GSK-3β and MLK3 activation play any role in PC-12 cell death, the cells were treated either with kenpaullone (32Knockaert M. Wieking K. Schmitt S. Leost M. Grant K.M. Mottram J.C. Kunick C. Meijer L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25493-25501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 33Leost M.

Biochem. 2000; 267: 5983-5994Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar), a GSK-3 inhibitor, or CEP-11004 (11Murakata C. Kaneko M. Gessner G. Angeles T.S. Ator M.A. O'Kane T.M. McKenna B.A. Thomas B.A. Mathiasen J.R. Saporito M.S. Bozyczko-Coyne D. Hudkins R.L. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2002; 12: 147-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), a MLK3 inhibitor, before NGF withdrawal. The inhibition of either GSK-3 or MLK3 almost completely inhibited NGF withdrawal-induced cell death (Fig. 2A) in PC-12 cells, suggesting that these protein kinases play a significant role in trophic factor deprivation-induced neuronal cell death. Furthermore, NGF withdrawal-induced JNK activation was also inhibited by both these inhibitors (Fig. 2B). Kenpaullone and CEP-11004 also inhibited NGF withdrawal-induced MLK3 activation significantly, an effect that was synergized in the presence of both of the inhibitors (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, although kenpaullone was able to inhibit MLK3 activation (Fig. 2C), the MLK3 inhibitor CEP-11004 failed to block NGF withdrawal-induced GSK-3β activation (Fig. 2D). These results indicate that GSK-3β might be functioning upstream of MLK3. GSK-3β Is an Upstream Activator of MLK3—There are two isoforms of GSK-3, GSK-3α and GSK-3β. To determine whether GSK-3β played a direct role in MLK3 activation, we took advantage of MEFs derived from GSK-3β-deficient mice (27Hoeflich K.P. Luo J. Rubie E.A. Tsao M.S. Jin O. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 2000; 406: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1228) Google Scholar). First, the expression of GSK-3β and MLK3 were determined by immunoblotting. As expected, GSK-3β was detected in normal but not in GSK-3β-deficient MEFs (Fig. 3A). MLK3 expression in GSK-3β-deficient MEFs was comparable with the normal MEFs (Fig. 3A). Recently, it has been shown that UV irradiation activates GSK-3β kinase activity (22Kim J.W. Lee J.E. Kim M.J. Cho E.G. Cho S.G. Choi E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13995-14001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 34Liu S. Yu S. Hasegawa Y. Lapushin R. Xu H.J. Woodgett J.R. Mills G.B. Fang X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51075-51081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To understand whether activation of GSK-3β by UV influences MLK3 kinase activity, GSK-3β-deficient and normal MEFs were exposed to 80 J/m2 of UV irradiation. The endogenous MLK3 in GSK-3β-null MEFs was not activated by UV. However, in normal MEFs, MLK3 was significantly activated (∼3-fold) upon UV exposure (Fig. 3A). This MLK3 activation was not induced by an unknown UV-inducible kinase, because in GSK-3β-deficient MEFs, the basal and UV-induced MLK3 kinase activities were comparable (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, the basal MLK3 kinase activity in normal MEFs was higher than that of GSK-3β-deficient MEFs (Fig. 3A). To further corroborate the requirement for GSK-3β for MLK3 activation, the GSK-3β-deficient MEFs were complemented with either kinase-active (GSK-3β, WT) or kinase-inactive (GSK-3β, K-A) GSK-3β expression plasmids. The kinase-active, but not kinase-inactive GSK-3β complementation restored UV-induced MLK3 activation (Fig. 3B), suggesting that GSK-3β function is necessary for MLK3 activation. GSK-3β Interacts with and Phosphorylates MLK3—Three stringent putative consensus GSK-3 phosphorylation sequences are present in the C-terminal half of human MLK3 (see Fig. 5A). Because NGF withdrawal activated both MLK3 and GSK-3 (Fig. 1), we postulated that the activation of MLK3 may be mediated proximally through GSK-3β phosphorylation of MLK3. To test this hypothesis, we tested for association between endogenous MLK3 and GSK-3β in differentiated PC-12 cells following NGF withdrawal. GSK-3β co-precipitated with MLK3 in response to NGF withdrawal (Fig. 4A), but this association was completely blocked by the GSK-3 inhibitor, kenpaullone, suggesting that GSK-3β interacts with MLK3 in a kinase-active-dependent manner.FIGURE 4GSK-3β interacts with and phosphorylates MLK3. Endogenous interaction between MLK3 and GSK-3β was determined in PC-12 cells, whereas interactions between recombinant proteins or phosphorylation of full-length of MLK3 was performed in HEK-293 cells. A, NGF withdrawal induces interaction between endogenous MLK3 and GSK-3β in PC-12 cells. The differentiated PC-12 cells were pretreated with kenpaullone or vehicle for 12 h. prior to NGF withdrawal (for 4 h). Endogenous MLK3 was immunoprecipitated (IP) using anti-MLK3 antibody, and immunoblotting was performed by anti-GSK-3β antibody. The cell extracts were also blotted for MLK3 and GSK-3β. B, GSK-3β interacts with the C-terminal regulatory domain of MLK3. Different GST-MLK3 constructs, as indicated, were co-transfected with either HA-tagged, WT, or kinase-inactive (K-A) GSK-3β. MLK3 proteins were pulled down with glutathione-Sepharose beads, and any associated GSK-3β protein was detected using anti-HA antibody (12CA5). The cell lysates were also blotted with anti-HA and anti-GST antibodies to determine the expression of recombinant GSK-3β and MLK3, respectively. C, GSK-3β directly phosphorylates the C-terminal regulatory domain of MLK3. Different MLK3 proteins, as indicated, were expressed and purified as GST fusion proteins from bacteria. In vitro kinase assays were performed in the presence of purified kinase active GSK-3β, either in the presence or absence of kenpaullone as indicated. The kinase activities of purified GSK-3β proteins were determined using bacterially expressed β-catenin protein as the substrate. The polyvinylidene difluoride membrane after kinase assay was first stained with Coomassie stain and then blotted with anti-GSK-3β antibody. D, GSK-3β phosphorylates MLK3 in vivo. HEK-293 cells were transfected with GST-MLK3 (K-A), in combination with either WT (GSK-3β) or kinase inactive (GSK-3β, K-A) GSK-3β. Post-transfection, the cells were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate, and the kinase-inactive MLK3 (GST-MLK3, K-A) proteins were precipitated using glutathione-Sepharose beads and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Phosphorylation of kinase-inactive MLK3 was detected by autoradiography. The cell extracts were also blotted with anti-GST and anti-HA antibodies to examine the expression of recombinant MLK3 and GSK-3β proteins, respectively. E, endogenous MLK3 is phosphorylated by NGF withdrawal-induced GSK-3β. PC-12 cells were differentiated and pretreated either with kenpaullone or vehicle as indicated for 12 h. The cells were labeled with 32P and NGF was withdrawn for 4 h as described in the legend to Fig. 1. The endogenous MLK3 was immunoprecipitated, r"
https://openalex.org/W2139510149,"Although it is acknowledged that genetic variation contributes to individual differences in thermotolerance, the specific genes and pathways involved and how they are modulated by the environment remain poorly understood. We link natural variation in the thermotolerance of neural function and behavior in Drosophila melanogaster to the foraging gene (for, which encodes a cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG)) as well as to its downstream target, protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). Genetic and pharmacological manipulations revealed that reduced PKG (or PP2A) activity caused increased thermotolerance of synaptic transmission at the larval neuromuscular junction. Like synaptic transmission, feeding movements were preserved at higher temperatures in larvae with lower PKG levels. In a comparative assay, pharmacological manipulations altering thermotolerance in a central circuit of Locusta migratoria demonstrated conservation of this neuroprotective pathway. In this circuit, either the inhibition of PKG or PP2A induced robust thermotolerance of neural function. We suggest that PKG and therefore the polymorphism associated with the allelic variation in for may provide populations with natural variation in heat stress tolerance. for's function in behavior is conserved across most organisms, including ants, bees, nematodes, and mammals. PKG's role in thermotolerance may also apply to these and other species. Natural variation in thermotolerance arising from genes involved in the PKG pathway could impact the evolution of thermotolerance in natural populations."
https://openalex.org/W1996115484,"Background Hox genes are implicated in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) regulation as well as in leukemia development through translocation with the nucleoporin gene NUP98. Interestingly, an engineered NUP98-HOXA10 (NA10) fusion can induce a several hundred-fold expansion of HSCs in vitro and NA10 and the AML-associated fusion gene NUP98-HOXD13 (ND13) have a virtually indistinguishable ability to transform myeloid progenitor cells in vitro and to induce leukemia in collaboration with MEIS1 in vivo. Methodology/Principal Findings These findings provided a potentially powerful approach to identify key pathways mediating Hox-induced expansion and transformation of HSCs by identifying gene expression changes commonly induced by ND13 and NA10 but not by a NUP98-Hox fusion with a non-DNA binding homedomain mutation (N51S). The gene expression repertoire of purified murine bone marrow Sca-1+Lin- cells transduced with retroviral vectors encoding for these genes was established using the Affymetrix GeneChip MOE430A. Approximately seventy genes were differentially expressed in ND13 and NA10 cells that were significantly changed by both compared to the ND13(N51S) mutant. Intriguingly, several of these potential Hox target genes have been implicated in HSC expansion and self-renewal, including the tyrosine kinase receptor Flt3, the prion protein, Prnp, hepatic leukemia factor, Hlf and Jagged-2, Jag2. Consistent with these results, FLT3, HLF and JAG2 expression correlated with HOX A cluster gene expression in human leukemia samples. Conclusions In conclusion this study has identified several novel Hox downstream target genes and provides important new leads to key regulators of the expansion and transformation of hematopoietic stem cells by Hox."
https://openalex.org/W2087176235,"Is sexual orientation associated with structural differences in the brain? To address this question, 80 homosexual and heterosexual men and women (16 homosexual men and 15 homosexual women) underwent structural MRI. We used voxel-based morphometry to test for differences in grey matter concentration associated with gender and sexual orientation. Compared with heterosexual women, homosexual women displayed less grey matter bilaterally in the temporo-basal cortex, ventral cerebellum, and left ventral premotor cortex. The relative decrease in grey matter was most prominent in the left perirhinal cortex. The left perirhinal area also showed less grey matter in heterosexual men than in heterosexual women. Thus, in homosexual women, the perirhinal cortex grey matter displayed a more male-like structural pattern. This is in accordance with previous research that revealed signs of sex-atypical prenatal androgenization in homosexual women, but not in homosexual men. The relevance of the perirhinal area for high order multimodal (olfactory and visual) object, social, and sexual processing is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2090030757,"Reproductive isolation is a defining characteristic of populations that represent unique biological species, yet we know very little about the gene expression basis for reproductive isolation. The advent of powerful molecular biology tools provides the ability to identify genes involved in reproductive isolation and focuses attention on the molecular mechanisms that separate biological species. Herein we quantify the sterility pattern of hybrid males in African Clawed Frogs (Xenopus) and apply microarray analysis of the expression pattern found in testes to identify genes that are misexpressed in hybrid males relative to their two parental species (Xenopus laevis and X. muelleri).Phenotypic characteristics of spermatogenesis in sterile male hybrids (X. laevis x X. muelleri) were examined using a novel sperm assay that allowed quantification of live, dead, and undifferentiated sperm cells, the number of motile vs. immotile sperm, and sperm morphology. Hybrids exhibited a dramatically lower abundance of mature sperm relative to the parental species. Hybrid spermatozoa were larger in size and accompanied by numerous undifferentiated sperm cells. Microarray analysis of gene expression in testes was combined with a correction for sequence divergence derived from genomic hybridizations to identify candidate genes involved in the sterility phenotype. Analysis of the transcriptome revealed a striking asymmetric pattern of misexpression. There were only about 140 genes misexpressed in hybrids compared to X. laevis but nearly 4,000 genes misexpressed in hybrids compared to X. muelleri.Our results provide an important correlation between phenotypic characteristics of sperm and gene expression in sterile hybrid males. The broad pattern of gene misexpression suggests intriguing mechanisms creating the dominance pattern of the X. laevis genome in hybrids. These findings significantly contribute to growing evidence for allelic dominance in hybrids and have implications for the mechanism of species differentiation at the transcriptome level."
https://openalex.org/W2069635533,"Background The control of emergence and spread of infectious diseases depends critically on the details of the genetic makeup of pathogens and hosts, their immunological, behavioral and ecological traits, and the pattern of temporal and spatial contacts among the age/stage-classes of susceptible and infectious host individuals. Methods and Findings We show that failing to acknowledge the existence of heterogeneities in the transmission rate among age/stage-classes can make traditional eradication and control strategies ineffective, and in some cases, policies aimed at controlling pathogen emergence can even increase disease incidence in the host. When control strategies target for reduction in numbers those subsets of the population that effectively limit the production of new susceptible individuals, then control can produce a flush of new susceptibles entering the population. The availability of a new cohort of susceptibles may actually increase disease incidence. We illustrate these general points using Classical Swine Fever as a reference disease. Conclusion Negative effects of culling are robust to alternative formulations of epidemiological processes and underline the importance of better assessing transmission structure in the design of wildlife disease control strategies."

However, mechanisms that contribute to the beneficial effects of fish oil consumption are poorly understood. Mounting evidence suggests that oxidation products of EPA and DHA may be responsible, at least in part, for these benefits. Previously, we have defined the free radical-induced oxidation of arachidonic acid in vitro and in vivo and have proposed a unified mechanism for its peroxidation. We hypothesize that the oxidation of EPA can be rationally defined but would be predicted to be significantly more complex than arachidonate because of the fact that EPA contains an addition carbon-carbon double bond. Herein, we present, for the first time, a unified mechanism for the peroxidation of EPA. Novel oxidation products were identified employing state-of-the-art mass spectrometric techniques including Ag+ coordination ionspray and atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mass spectrometry. Predicted compounds detected both in vitro and in vivo included monocylic peroxides, serial cyclic peroxides, bicyclic endoperoxides, and dioxolane-endoperoxides.

Experiments in animals, as well as human epidemiological studies and recent clinical intervention trials, suggest that fish consumption or dietary supplementation with fish oil reduces the incidence of important human disorders including atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, cardiac sudden death, stroke, and asthma, among others (1Barnham K.J.

Identifying the mechanism(s) responsible for the beneficial effects of ω-3 fatty acids is of significant importance although it is not currently understood. One hypothesis to account for the anti-atherogenic and anti-inflammatory properties of ω-3 PUFAs is via interference with the arachidonic acid cascade that generates pro-inflammatory eicosanoids. EPA, a structurally close analogue of arachidonic acid, not only can replace arachidonic acid in phospholipid bilayers but is also a substrate for the cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase enzymes, generating 3-series prostaglandins (PGs) and thromboxane and 5-series leukotrienes (10Wada M. DeLong C.J. Hong Y.H. Rieke C.J. Song I. Sidhu R.S. Yuan C. Warnock M. Schmaier A.H. Yokoyama C. Smyth E.M. Wilson S.J. FitzGerald G.A. Garavito R.M. Sui D.X. Regan J.W. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 22254-22266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). In addition, EPA reduces the production of 2-series PGs and thromboxane and 4-series leukotrienes from arachidonate. These latter compounds are known to possess potent pro-inflammatory activities (11Laneuville O. Breuer D.K. Xu N. Huang Z.H. Gage D.A. Watson J.T. Lagarde M. DeWitt D.L. Smith W.L. J. Biol.

Commun. 1997; 241: 513-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). On the other hand, eicosanoids derived from EPA are either less biologically active or inactive compared with those from arachidonate and are thus considered to exert effects that are less inflammatory (13Bagga D. Wang L. Farias-Eisner R. Glaspy J.A. Reddy S.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1751-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Of particular interest, Serhan et al. (14Serhan C.N. Clish C.B. Brannon J. Colgan S.P. Chiang N. Gronert K. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1197-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar) have more recently reported that lipid mediators derived from EPA via COX-2 after aspirin treatment show potent anti-inflammatory actions. These compounds are termed Resolvins because they were first identified in resolving inflammatory exudates (15Serhan C.N. Hong S. Gronert K. Colgan S.P. Devchand P.R. Mirick G. Moussignac R.-L. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 1025-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar). Several studies have also reported that ω-3 PUFAs can be oxidized non-enzymatically and that the products are both anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative (16Sethi S. Ziouzenkova O. Ni H. Wagner D.D. Plutzky J. Mayadas T.N. Blood. 2002; 100: 1340-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 17Sethi S. Redox Rep. 2002; 17: 369-378Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, structural characterization of these biologically active peroxidation products of EPA and DHA has never been undertaken. EPA and DHA are readily oxidized under free radical conditions because they have additional carbon-carbon double bonds compared with arachidonate and other PUFAs (18Gao L. Wang J. Sekhar K.R. Yin H. Yared N.F. Schneider S.N. Sasi S. Dalton T.P. Anderson M.E. Chan J.Y. Morrow J.D. Freeman M.L. J. Biol.

Soc. 2006; 128: 14897-14904Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Thus, studies to rationally define the peroxidation of EPA and DHA may help to identify those products that contribute to the biology of ω-3 PUFA consumption. Free radical-induced oxidation of arachidonic acid has been well studied and a unified mechanism that leads to the formation of various oxidation products has been proposed (Scheme 2) (21Yin H. Havrilla C.M. Gao L. Morrow J.D. Porter N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16720-16725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 22Yin H. Porter N.A. Antioxid.

The oxidation proceeds via hydrogen atom abstraction at one of three bis-allylic positions at carbon 7, 10, and 13 to form a pentadienyl radical that can be trapped by molecular oxygen to form a peroxyl radical. A regiosomeric mixture of peroxyl radicals can be formed and the 11-peroxyl radical 2b is taken as an example. This peroxyl radical can lead to the formation of 11-hyperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HpETE), 2c and the corresponding alcohol 11-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (11-HETE), 2d. On the other hand, further cyclization of the peroxyl radical 2b will generate bicyclic endoperoxides 2g via two consecutive steps of 5-exo cyclization. Reduction of 2g gives rise to one of the major classes of oxidation products, F2-isoprostanes (IsoPs) (24Morrow J.D. Harris T.M. Roberts Jr., L.J. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 184: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 25Morrow J.D. Hill E. Burk R.F. Nammour T.M. Badr K.F. Roberts Jr., L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Quantification of F2-IsoPs by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS) has been shown to be one of the most reliable markers to assess oxidant stress status and lipid peroxidation in vivo (26Morrow J.D.

In addition to the IsoPs, monocyclic peroxides 2j, serial cyclic peroxides 2k, and dioxolane-isoprostane peroxides 2l have also been identified. Thus, the major oxidation products from arachidonate can be predicted based on a unified free radical mechanism and this mechanism has been confirmed experimentally.FIGURE 3CID analysis of oxidation products of 5-HpEPA Me analyzed by LC/Ag+ CIS-MS (a) CID of starting material 5-HpEPA Me (m/z 455). b, monocyclic peroxides 4g (m/z 487). c, bicyclic endoperoxides 4h (m/z 487). d, bicyclic peroxides 4j (m/z 519). e, tricyclic peroxides 4i (m/z 551).

We report, for the first time, systematic identification of the oxidation products derived from EPA using a variety of mass spectrometric techniques. It is our contention that formation of these novel oxidation products may be responsible for some of the beneficial effects of fish oil consumption in animals and humans.

Other chemicals were from Aldrich (Milwaukee, WI) and were of the highest purity. Detection and Separation of Lipid Oxidation Products—Reactions involving hydroperoxides were visualized by thin layer chromatography (TLC) using a stain of 1.5 g of N,N′-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride/25 ml H2O/125 ml of MeOH/1 ml of acetic acid. Hydroperoxides yield an immediate pink color, while cyclic peroxides exhibit a pink color after mild charring. General TLC staining was accomplished by use of a phosphomolybdic acid stain prepared as a 20% (w:v) solution in ethanol. In general, hydroperoxides were stored as dilute solutions with 1 mol% BHT in either hexanes or benzene at –78 °C and were never exposed to temperatures >40 °C. Flash column chromatography was performed using silica gel 60 (EMD, NJ) and eluted with hexane:ethyl acetate (90:10). TLC was performed using 0.2-mm layer thickness silica gel-coated aluminum (60 F254, EM Industries, Industry, CA), and TLC plates were analyzed using UV light (254 nm) with a Mineralight UVSL-25 hand lamp. Analytical HPLC was performed using a Waters Model 600E pump with a Waters 996 photodiode array detector. Millenium32 chromatography software (Waters Corp., Milford, MA) was utilized to control the array detector and to collect and process data.

Samples were analyzed using a ThermoFinnigan TSQ Quantum Ultra instrument. The atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) source was fitted with a deactivated fused silica capillary (100 μm i.d.). The mass spectrometer was operated in negative ion mode with a capillary temperature of 300 °C, vaporizer temperature of 300 °C. The spray voltage, ion transfer tube voltage, and skimmer voltage were optimized to achieve maximal response. Nitrogen was used as both the sheath gas and the auxiliary gas. For tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) experiments, collision energies were optimized under 1.5 mTorr of argon. Data acquisition and analysis were performed using Xcaliber software, version 2.0 Service Release-2 (SR-2). Samples were introduced either by direct liquid infusion (DLI) or by HPLC. For normal phase HPLC, samples were introduced by a Hewlett-Packard 1090 HPLC system. Oxidation of EPA Methyl Ester to Primary Hydroperoxides and More Complex Oxidation Products—EPA methyl ester (500 mg, 1.59 mmol) was dissolved in 1.5 ml of acetonitrile to make a solution of 1.06 m. To the mixture were added 44 mg of N-methyl benzohydoxamic acid (NMBHA), 2.92 mmol and 0.05 equivalent in benzene of free radical initiator di-tert-butyl hyponitrite (DTBN) (29Punta C. Rector C.L.

The reaction was quenched by adding 2 mg of BHT and NMBHA and DTBN were removed by flash chromatography on silica gel using hexane:ethyl acetate (90: 10). The hydroperoxides were analyzed and separated by analytical and semi-preparative HPLC. The separated fractions of primary hydroperoxides were converted to more highly oxidized peroxides according to our previous procedure (30Havrilla C.M. Hachey D.L. Porter N.A. J. Am. Chem.

The reduced lipid was subjected to basic hydrolysis using 1.0 m KOH for 60 min at 37 °C. After adjusting to pH 3, the mixture was loaded onto a C18 Sep-Pak cartridge that was preconditioned with 5 ml of methanol and then 5 ml of water. The column was washed with 5 ml of water and 5 ml of heptane. The eluent of 10 ml of ethyl acetate was collected. The solution was dried over Na2SO4. After evaporation of the solvent, the residue was dissolved in 20 μl of CH3CN. To the resulting solution was added 20 μl of 10% (v:v) PFB bromide in acetonitrile and 10 μl of 10% (v:v) N,N-diisopropylethylamine (DIEA) in acetonitrile and the mixture was kept at room temperature for 30 min. The reagent was dried under nitrogen, and the residue was subjected to TLC separation (60ALK6D plates, Whatman, Maidstone UK). The PFB esters, after TLC separation, were either directly analyzed by LC/APCI-MS or were further derivatized to TMS derivatives. For the latter, after evaporation of the ethyl acetate, 20 μl of BSTFA and 10 μl of dimethylformamide were added to the residue, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. Identification of Oxidation Products of EPA in Mice Tissue— Mice (strain C57BL/6J(B6)) were fed with a rodent American Institute of Nutrition (AIN)-93 M (maintenance) (Dyets Inc., Bethlehem, PA) diet supplemented with either 0% (control diet) or 0.56% EPA (EPA diet) (by weight). The formulation of AIN-93 diets is an improvement to replace the previous version of AIN-76 (34Reeves P.G. J. Nutr. 1997; 127: 838S-841SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). The EPA in this modified AIN-93 diet is stable employing the feeding conditions used in the studies as noted under “Results.” In particular, experiments were carried out to ensure that complex oxidation products of EPA were present at minimal levels in the diet when freshly obtained, at the end of the study, and after being stored at room temperature in the same conditions used in the feeding studies. After 8 weeks of feeding, mice were administered CCl4 (2 ml/kg in corn oil). After 2 h, the animals were anesthetized with pentobarbital (60 mg/kg) intraperitoneally, sacrificed, and the livers were removed. Approximately 1.0 g of tissue was immediately homogenized and extracted in 20 ml of Folch solution (MeOH: CHCl3 = 1:2 containing BHT 0.005%) and 4 ml of 0.9% NaCl solution was added to obtain a crude phospholipid extract (35Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The aqueous layer was not acidified prior to the extraction. It should be noted that we have previously shown that this extraction approach does not lead to oxidation of arachidonate or EPA ex vivo (19Gao L. Yin H. Milne G.L. Porter N.A. Morrow J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14092-14099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 25Morrow J.D. Hill E. Burk R.F. Nammour T.M. Badr K.F. Roberts Jr., L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The pH of the solution was adjusted to 3 by addition of 1 n HCl. 10 μl of 0.1 ng/μl internal standard 15-F2t-IsoP-d4 ethanol was added to the mixture to correct the sample loss. Then the mixture was further purified by C18 as mentioned above and an additional silica Sep-Pak solid phase extraction was carried out. The silica Sep-Pak was preconditioned with 5 ml of ethyl acetate. Afterward, it was washed with 5 ml of ethyl acetate and the samples were eluted with 5 ml of 1:1 (ethyl acetate:methanol). PFB esterification was carried out, and TLC was performed using chloroform: ethanol (93:7). A wide TLC cut was chosen to include all the possible oxidation products. After extraction of the compounds from the scraped silica gel by ethyl acetate, the TMS derivatives were obtained by the procedures described above. LC/APCI-MS analyses were carried out using a narrowbore reverse phase column using methanol as a solvent. Analysis of F3-IsoPs as PFB esters was performed using the same protocol as above employing normal phase LC with a solvent system of 12% isopropyl alcohol in hexanes (32Yin H. Havrilla C.M. Morrow J.D. Porter N.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 7745-7754Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). For quantitative studies involving the measurement of F3-IsoPs in mouse tissues, a highly accurate gas chromatography/MS assay using stable isotope dilution methods was employed as described (19Gao L.

A Unified Mechanism That Leads to the Formation of Novel Oxidation Products from EPA and Rationale for Overall Methods Employed For Product Analysis—Based on the free radical mechanism of arachidonic acid autoxidation, the oxidation profile of EPA can be rationally defined. As shown in Scheme 3, eight regioisomeric hydroperoxides (hydroperoxyeicosapentaenoic acid, HpEPA) can be generated from the peroxidation of EPA because of the presence of an additional double bond compared with arachidonate. These eight primary hydroperoxides can be further oxidized to generate more complex peroxidation products. The same types of reactions as those observed for arachidonate peroxidation are anticipated for EPA and include 5-exo cyclization and hydrogen atom abstraction. Different precursors should give rise to different sets of oxidation products (Scheme 4). For example, oxidation of 15-HpEPA (4a) will lead to the formation of bicyclic endoperoxides 4b via two 5-exo cyclizations; these endoperoxides are precursors of IsoPs including F3-IsoPs and D3/E3-IsoPs. Monocyclic peroxides 4c, dioxolane-IsoP peroxides 4d, and bis-dioxolane IsoP 4e will also be formed. On the other hand, oxidation of 5-HpEPA gives rise to a different set of oxidation products that include monocyclic peroxides 4g, bicyclic endoperoxides 4h, bicyclic peroxides 4j, and tricyclic peroxides 4i. Overall, the oxidation profile of 8-HpEPA, 12-HpEPA, and 11-HpEPA will resemble that of 15-HpEPA whereas oxidation of 9-HpEPA, 14-HpEPA, and 18-HpEPA will generate similar types of oxidation products as those of 5-HpEPA. In order to simplify the oxidation pattern for the studies reported herein, we separated the primary hydroperoxides of EPA methyl ester by semi-preparative HPLC and oxidized the separated fractions.SCHEME 4View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A number of MS techniques were developed and applied to identify these novel oxidation products (Scheme 5). Ag+ CIS-MS has proven powerful to characterize the intact peroxides of PUFAs based on the unique fragmentation patterns induced by Ag+ coordination and was initially employed in studies discussed below. Oxidation mixtures were then reduced by PPh3 and derivatized to PFB esters and APCI-MS was employed to further confirm the structure of the oxidation products. APCI-MS was also utilized to provide additional information about EPA oxidation products after trimethylsilyl (TMS) derivatization. Formation of Eight Regioismeric Hydroperoxides from the Oxidation of EPA—Primary hydroperoxides of EPA can be obtained from the oxidation of EPA in the presence of good hydrogen atom donors such as α-tocopherol, methyl trolox, or cyclohexadiene although a catalytic system based on the hydrogen atom donor NMBHA gives much higher yield of hydroperoxides from polyunsaturated fatty acids (29Punta C. Rector C.L. Porter N.A. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2005; 18: 349-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The eight hydroperoxide regioisomers of HpEPA Me were prepared using the latter reagent and separated by HPLC (Fig. 1a). Only 5- and 15-HpEPA Me can be separated from other hydroperoxides whereas 12 and 14-HpEPA, 11- and 18-HpEPA, and 8-HpEPA and 9-HpEPA are collected as mixtures. The structures of these different hydroperoxides were confirmed using Ag+ CIS-MS based on the specific Hock cleavage fragments of each hydroperoxides (data not shown). It is interesting that once the hydroperoxides are reduced to corresponding alcohols (hydroxyeicosapentaenoic acids, HEPAs), all regioisomers can be separated as eight distinct peaks and their structures can be identified by APCI-MS after PFB esterification (Fig. 1b). The elution order of the eight alcohols is 15-, 12-, 14-, 11-, 18-, 8-, 9-, and 5-HEPA employing normal phase HPLC. Identification of Intact Peroxides from the Oxidation of EPA by Ag+CIS-MS—After separation, individual HpEPA regioisomers were further oxidized to generate different cyclic peroxides predicted in Scheme 4. Oxidation products of 5-HpEPA and 15-HpEPA are detailed herein to provide evidence confirming the proposed mechanism of EPA oxidation. Most of the predicted oxidation products of EPA have cyclic peroxide moieties and are unstable when analyzed by conventional ESI-MS. However, a milder ionization technique, Ag+ CIS-MS, has proven to be useful in identification of these intact peroxides based on characteristic fragmentation induced by Ag+ coordination of lipids (30Havrilla C.M.

https://openalex.org/W2160047008,"Optimization of a serotype-selective, small-molecule inhibitor of botulinum neurotoxin serotype A (BoNTA) endopeptidase is a formidable challenge because the enzyme-substrate interface is unusually large and the endopeptidase itself is a large, zinc-binding protein with a complex fold that is difficult to simulate computationally. We conducted multiple molecular dynamics simulations of the endopeptidase in complex with a previously described inhibitor (K(i) (app) of 7+/-2.4 microM) using the cationic dummy atom approach. Based on our computational results, we hypothesized that introducing a hydroxyl group to the inhibitor could improve its potency. Synthesis and testing of the hydroxyl-containing analog as a BoNTA endopeptidase inhibitor showed a twofold improvement in inhibitory potency (K(i) (app) of 3.8+/-0.8 microM) with a relatively small increase in molecular weight (16 Da). The results offer an improved template for further optimization of BoNTA endopeptidase inhibitors and demonstrate the effectiveness of the cationic dummy atom approach in the design and optimization of zinc protease inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2085920668,"Phylogenetic and geographic evidence suggest that many parthenogenetic organisms have evolved recently and have spread rapidly. These patterns play a critical role in our understanding of the relative merits of sexual versus asexual reproductive modes, yet their interpretation is often hampered by a lack of detail. Here we present a detailed phylogeographic study of a vertebrate parthenogen, the Australian gecko Heteronotia binoei, in combination with statistical and biophysical modeling of its distribution during the last glacial maximum. Parthenogenetic H. binoei occur in the Australian arid zone and have the widest range of any known vertebrate parthenogen. They are broadly sympatric with their sexual counterparts, from which they arose via hybridization. We have applied nested clade phylogeographic, effective migration, and mismatch distribution analyses to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences obtained for 319 individuals sampled throughout the known geographic ranges of two parthenogenetic mitochondrial lineages. These analyses provide strong evidence for past range expansion events from west to east across the arid zone, and for continuing eastward range expansion. Parthenogen formation and range expansion events date to the late Pleistocene, with one lineage expanding from the northwest of its present range around 240,000 years ago and the second lineage expanding from the far west around 70,000 years ago. Statistical and biophysical distribution models support these inferences of recent range expansion, with suitable climatic conditions during the last glacial maximum most likely limited to parts of the arid zone north and west of much of the current ranges of these lineages. Combination of phylogeographic analyses and distribution modeling allowed considerably stronger inferences of the history of this complex than either would in isolation, illustrating the power of combining complementary analytical approaches."
https://openalex.org/W2152291001,"Background In many communities where TB occurs at high incidence, the major force driving the epidemic is transmission. It is plausible that the typical long delay from the onset of infectious disease to diagnosis and commencement of treatment is almost certainly the major factor contributing to the high rate of transmission. Methodology/Principal Findings This study is confined to communities which are epidemiologically relatively isolated and which have low HIV incidence. The consequences of delays to diagnosis are analyzed and the existence of a threshold delay value is demonstrated. It is shown that unless a sufficient number of cases are detected before this threshold, the epidemic will escalate. The method used for the analysis avoids the standard computer integration of systems of differential equations since the intention is to present a line of reasoning that reveals the essential dynamics of an epidemic in an intuitively clear way that is nevertheless quantitatively realistic. Conclusions/Significance The analysis presented here shows that typical delays to diagnosis present a major obstacle to the control of a TB epidemic. Control can be achieved by optimizing the rapid identification of TB cases together with measures to increase the threshold value. A calculated and aggressive program is therefore necessary in order to bring about a reduction in the prevalence of TB in a community by decreasing the time to diagnosis in all its ramifications. Intervention strategies to increase the threshold value relative to the time to diagnosis and which thereby decrease disease incidence are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1965403984,"Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is a severe muscle degenerative disease, due to absence of dystrophin. There is currently no effective treatment for DMD. Our aim is to up-regulate the expression level of the dystrophin related gene utrophin in DMD, complementing in this way the lack of dystrophin functions. To this end we designed and engineered several synthetic zinc finger based transcription factors. In particular, we have previously shown that the artificial three zinc finger protein named Jazz, fused with the appropriate effector domain, is able to drive the transcription of a test gene from the utrophin promoter ""A"". Here we report on the characterization of Vp16-Jazz-transgenic mice that specifically over-express the utrophin gene at the muscular level. A Chromatin Immunoprecipitation assay (ChIP) demonstrated the effective access/binding of the Jazz protein to active chromatin in mouse muscle and Vp16-Jazz was shown to be able to up-regulate endogenous utrophin gene expression by immunohistochemistry, western blot analyses and real-time PCR. To our knowledge, this is the first example of a transgenic mouse expressing an artificial gene coding for a zinc finger based transcription factor. The achievement of Vp16-Jazz transgenic mice validates the strategy of transcriptional targeting of endogenous genes and could represent an exclusive animal model for use in drug discovery and therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W1994182245,"We re-examine the evidence for a 62 million year (Myr) periodicity in biodiversity throughout the Phanerozoic history of animal life reported by, as well as related questions of periodicity in origination and extinction. We find that the signal is robust against variations in methods of analysis, and is based on fluctuations in the Paleozoic and a substantial part of the Mesozoic. Examination of origination and extinction is somewhat ambiguous, with results depending upon procedure. Origination and extinction intensity as defined by may be affected by an artifact at 27 Myr in the duration of stratigraphic intervals. Nevertheless, when a procedure free of this artifact is implemented, the 27 Myr periodicity appears in origination, suggesting that the artifact may ultimately be based on a signal in the data. A 62 Myr feature appears in extinction, when this same procedure is used. We conclude that evidence for a periodicity at 62 Myr is robust, and evidence for periodicity at approximately 27 Myr is also present, albeit more ambiguous."
https://openalex.org/W2010423785,"A key issue regarding the role of α6β4 in cancer biology is the mechanism by which this integrin exerts its profound effects on intracellular signaling, including growth factor-mediated signaling. One approach is to evaluate the intrinsic signaling capacity of the unique β4 intracellular domain in the absence of contributions from the α6 subunit and tetraspanins and to assess the ability of growth factor receptor signaling to cooperate with this domain. Here, we generated a chimeric receptor composed of the TrkB extracellular domain and the β4 transmembrane and intracellular domains. Expression of this chimeric receptor in β4-null cancer cells enabled us to assess the signaling potential of the β4 intracellular domain alone or in response to dimerization using brain-derived neurotrophic factor, the ligand for TrkB. Dimerization of the β4 intracellular domain results in the binding and activation of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 and the activation of Src, events that also occur upon ligation of intact α6β4. In contrast to α6β4 signaling, however, dimerization of the chimeric receptor does not activate either Akt or Erk1/2. Growth factor stimulation induces tyrosine phosphorylation of the chimeric receptor but does not enhance its binding to SHP-2. The chimeric receptor is unable to amplify growth factor-mediated activation of Akt and Erk1/2, and growth factor-stimulated migration.

The α6β4 integrin is a structural and functional anomaly among the integrin family of receptors. This integrin, which is expressed primarily on the basal surface of epithelia and in a few other cell types, is defined as an adhesion receptor for most of the known laminins (1Kikkawa Y. Sanzen N.

Cell Res. 2000; 261: 360-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The distinguishing structural feature of α6β4 is the atypical intracellular domain of the β4 subunit. Two pairs of fibronectin type III repeats separated by a connecting segment characterize this domain, and it is distinct both in size (∼1000 amino acids) and structure from any other integrin subunit (4Borradori L. Sonnenberg A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 647-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Although the α6β4 integrin provides a well characterized adhesive function in normal epithelial cells by anchoring the epithelium to its underlying basement membrane, the carcinoma-associated functions of this integrin are becoming increasingly recognized (5Lipscomb E.A.

Importantly, the expression of this integrin is often maintained as epithelial structures dissociate during the initiation and progression of carcinomas, and, consequently, many carcinomas express α6β4 (6Mercurio A.M.

The dichotomy of α6β4 function is summarized best by the hypothesis that α6β4 switches from a mechanical adhesive device into a signaling competent receptor during the progression from normal epithelium to invasive carcinoma (5Lipscomb E.A.

A key issue regarding the role of α6β4 in carcinoma biology is the mechanism by which this integrin exerts its profound effects on intracellular signaling. Given that α6β1 and α6β4 exhibit substantial differences in their known signaling functions, it is reasonable to postulate that the unique signaling properties of α6β4 derive largely from the β4 intracellular domain (21Shaw L.M. Rabinovitz I. Wang H.H. Toker A. Mercurio A.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 949-960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Despite its large size, however, the β4 intracellular domain lacks intrinsic kinase activity. A current hypothesis argues that the β4 intracellular domain functions as a “signaling adaptor” that facilitates signaling through growth factor receptors such as Met (22Trusolino L. Bertotti A. Comoglio P.M. Cell. 2001; 107: 643-654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Another viable, though not mutually exclusive, hypothesis is that the association of α6β4 with tetraspanins and its localization in tetraspanin-enriched membrane microdomains enhances its signaling capacity (23Yang X. Kovalenko O.V. Tang W. Claas C. Stipp C.S. Hemler M.E. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 1231-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). These hypotheses are complicated by the finding that α6β4 signaling can be either dependent on engagement of its ligands (laminins) or independent of such ligation (22Trusolino L. Bertotti A. Comoglio P.M. Cell. 2001; 107: 643-654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 24O'Connor K.L. Shaw L.M. Mercurio A.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1749-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). One approach to understanding the nature of α6β4 signaling in more detail is to evaluate the intrinsic signaling capacity of the unique β4 intracellular domain itself in the absence of contributions from the α6 subunit and tetraspanins, and to assess the ability of growth factor receptor signaling to cooperate with this intracellular domain. To execute this approach, we generated a chimeric receptor composed of the TrkB extracellular domain and the β4 transmembrane and intracellular domains. Expression of this chimeric receptor in β4-null cancer cells enabled us to assess the signaling potential of the β4 intracellular domain either alone or in response to dimerization of the chimeric receptor using brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), the ligand for TrkB (25Bibel M. Barde Y.A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2919-2937Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). The data obtained indicate that the β4 intracellular domain has some intrinsic signaling potential but that it cannot mimic the full signaling capacity of the intact α6β4 integrin. These data also highlight the need to re-evaluate the putative role of the β4 intracellular domain as an “adaptor” for growth factor receptor signaling. Cells—The MDA-MB-435 cancer cell line, which has been reported to be derived from the melanoma cell line M14 (26Rae J.M. Creighton C.J. Meck J.M. Haddad B.R. Johnson M.D. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2007; 104: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), was obtained from the Lombardi Breast Cancer Depository at Georgetown University (Washington, D. C.) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 1 g/liter glucose, 5% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and 10 mm HEPES. MDA-MB-435 cells stably expressing the α6β4 integrin were described previously (21Shaw L.M. Rabinovitz I. Wang H.H. Toker A. Mercurio A.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 949-960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). MDA-MB-435 cells stably expressing full-length TrkB, TrkBextra, and TrkBβ4 were generated as follows. For generation of a full-length TrkB retroviral expression construct, a 2.5-kb EcoRI/SalI fragment was removed from the rat TrkB expression construct pEYFP-N1TrkB (a gift from Dr. Luis Parada, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX), blunt-ended with T4 DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), and subcloned into XhoI-digested and blunt-ended pCLXSN (Imgenex, San Diego, CA). To generate a TrkBextra retroviral expression construct, the extracellular and transmembrane regions (amino acids 1-458) of TrkB were PCR-amplified from pEYFP-N1TrkB with the following primers: Primer 1 (forward) 5′-CCGCTCGAGCGGATGTCGCCCTGGCCGAGGT and Primer 2 (reverse) 5′-CCGCTCGAGCGGCTAATGTCTCGCCAACTTGA. Purified PCR products were then digested with XhoI and subcloned into XhoI-digested pCLXSN. For generation of a retroviral TrkBβ4 expression construct, the TrkB extracellular domain (amino acids 1-429) was first amplified from pEYFP-N1TrkB by PCR, adding 18 bp of sequence complementary to the coding region for the first 6 amino acids of the β4 transmembrane domain (710-715) to the 3′-end of the product, using the following primers: Primer 1 (forward) and Primer 3 (reverse) 5′-GAGCCACCAGAAGGAATGCTCCCGATTGGTT. Next, the transmembrane and intracellular domains of β4 were amplified from pRc/CMVβ4 (27Clarke A.S. Lotz M.M. Chao C. Mercurio A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22673-22676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), adding 18 bp of sequence complementary to the coding region of the final 6 amino acids of the TrkB extracellular domain (424-429) to the 5′-end of the product, using the following primers: Primer 4 (forward) 5′-AACCAATCGGGAGCATTCCTTCTGGTGGCTC and Primer 5 (reverse) 5′-CCGCTCGAGCGGTCAAGTTTGGAAGAACTGT. Finally, these two PCR products were used together as template with Primer 1 (forward) and Primer 5 (reverse) to PCR-amplify the TrkBβ4 insert. This insert was then digested with XhoI and subcloned into pCLXSN. All plasmids were sequenced to confirm that the inserts were correctly inserted and contained no mutations. To generate stable cell lines expressing full-length TrkB, TrkBextra, and TrkBβ4, the above retroviral expression constructs were transfected along with expression plasmids for the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein envelope glycoprotein and Gag-Pol packaging proteins into 293T cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Three days post-transfection, viral supernatants were harvested, diluted in serum-containing media supplemented with 8 μg/ml Polybrene (Sigma), and used to infect MDA-MB-435 cells. Following 24 h of infection, cells were selected with Geneticin (2.5 mg/ml) to yield stable cell lines, and cells were then maintained in 1.0 mg/ml Geneticin. Immunoblotting was performed, as described below, to confirm protein expression in the stable cell lines. For the generation of cell lines with stable knockdown of the SHP-2 protein, an shRNA cloned into the pSUPER retroviral expression construct was obtained from Ben Neel (Ontario Cancer Institute, Toronto), and viral production and infection were performed as described above. Puromycin (0.5 μg/ml) was used for cell selection. To create the β4 shRNA-pFSIPPW expression plasmid, the following oligonucleotides (Invitrogen) were annealed and ligated into pFSIPPW (a gift of Andrew Kung, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA) between the EcoRI and BamHI restriction sites: 5′-aattcccGAGCTGCACGGAGTGTGTCtgcaagagaGACACACTCCGTGCAGCTCtttttg and 5′-gatccaaaaaGAGCTGCACGGAGTGTGTCtctcttgcaGACACACTCGTGCAGCTCggg. To generate stable HCC1937 cell lines expressing β4 shRNA-pFSIPPW the above construct was transfected along with the ViraPower lentiviral packaging mix (Invitrogen) into 293T cells using Lipofectamine 2000 following the manufacturer's instructions. Viral supernatants were harvested 3 days post-transfection, diluted in serum-containing medium supplemented with 8 μg/ml Polybrene, and used to infect HCC1937 cells. Stable cell lines were generated by selection with puromycin (1 μg/ml). Cells were maintained in 0.5 μg/ml puromycin. Suppression of β4 expression was confirmed by immunoblotting as described below. A875 melanoma cells were a generous gift from Alonzo Ross (University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA) and were maintained in DMEM containing 1g/liter glucose, 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and 10 mm HEPES. Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from cells using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). Gene-specific mRNA was then reverse transcribed into cDNA and amplified from 1 μg of total RNA using a OneStep reverse transcription-PCR kit (Qiagen). PCR amplification of cDNA was performed for 30 cycles using the following primers: p75NTR forward (5′-CGACAACCTCATCCCTGTCT), p75NTR reverse (5′-ACTGCACAGACTCTCCACGA), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase forward (5′-ATCACCATCTTCCAGGAGCGA), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase reverse (5′-GCTTCACCACCTTCTTGATGT). Antibodies and Reagents—The following Abs were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA): polyclonal TrkB Ab (H-181), SHP-2 mAb (B-1), phospho-tyrosine mAb (PY99), Src mAb (B-12), and actin Ab (C-11). Abs specific for phospho-SHP-2 (Tyr-542), phospho-Akt (Ser-473), Akt, phospho-p44/42 Erk kinase (Thr-202/Tyr-204), and p44/42 Erk kinase were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). The Src (pTyr-418) and (pTyr-529) Abs were purchased from Invitrogen/BIOSOURCE (Carlsbad, CA). The 505 Ab, raised against a peptide comprising the final 20 amino acids of the β4 C terminus (14) and α6 mAb (2B7) (28Shaw L.M. Lotz M.M. Mercurio A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11401-11408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were produced by our laboratory. An mAb against the extracellular domain of β4 (UMA9) was purchased from Ancell (Bayport, MN). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse Abs (Pierce) and a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat Ab (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) were used as secondary Abs. The streptavidin agarose-conjugate, calpeptin, calpastatin peptide, and ALLN were purchased from EMD Biosciences (San Diego, CA), and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and BDNF were purchased from Peprotech (Rocky Hill, NJ). Biochemical Analyses—Biotinylation of cell surface proteins was performed using EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce) following the manufacturer's instructions with a few modifications, as follows. Cells were washed and suspended in PBS (pH 8.0) at a concentration of 25 × 106 cells/ml and labeled with 0.5 mg/ml biotin for 30 min at room temperature. Following the labeling, cells were washed with PBS containing 100 mm glycine to quench and remove excess biotin and then extracted in a Triton X-100 buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100) supplemented with 1 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and complete-Mini protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). For co-immunoprecipitation studies, cells were extracted with either the Triton X-100 buffer or an Nonidet P-40 buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and complete-Mini protease inhibitor mixture). Cell extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min and pre-absorbed for 2 h using protein G-Sepharose beads. After centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 5 min to pellet the beads, extracts were incubated with primary Abs for 1 h, and immune complexes were then precipitated with protein G-Sepharose overnight. For precipitation of biotinylated proteins, pre-absorbed extracts were incubated with a streptavidin agarose-conjugate overnight. Precipitates were washed two times with lysis buffer, one time with PBS, and then eluted in 1× reducing SDS sample buffer while boiling for 5 min. For immunoblotting, cell extracts were prepared as described above, and protein concentrations determined using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). These extracts, or eluted immune complexes from the immunoprecipitations, were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). Membranes were then blocked in TBS-T (Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) containing 5% nonfat dry milk for at least 30 min, except for immunoblots for phosphorylated proteins, in which case TBS-T containing 5% BSA was used. Following blocking, membranes were incubated overnight with primary Ab in blocking buffer, washed 3× with TBS-T, incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary Ab in blocking buffer, washed 3× with TBS-T, and detected using SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). For assays where BDNF was used to dimerize the TrkBβ4 chimera, cells were washed once with PBS and serum-deprived for 24 h in DMEM containing 1 g/liter glucose, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, 10 mm HEPES, and 0.1% BSA. Following serum starvation, cells were incubated with fresh serum-free medium supplemented with 100 ng/ml BDNF for the indicated time periods at 37 °C. Treatment of cells with HGF was performed in a similar manner, using HGF at a final concentration of 100 ng/ml. Integrin Clustering—Cells were removed from their dishes with trypsin and washed twice with RPMI medium containing 1% BSA (RH/BSA). After washing, the cells were resuspended in the same buffer at a concentration of 106 cells/ml and incubated for 30 min with either α6- or β4-integrin-specific Abs (2 μg/ml) or in buffer alone. The cells were washed once, resuspended in RH/BSA, and added to plates that had been coated overnight at 4 °C with anti-mouse IgG (100 μg/10-cm plate). The plates were blocked with RH/BSA for 30 min prior to the addition of the cells. Inhibitors were added to the cells for 15 min prior to plating the cells in the antibody-coated plates. After incubation at 37 °C for 15-60 min, the cells were washed twice with PBS and solubilized at 4 °C for 10 min in the Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. Nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 8 min. Migration Assays—Migration assays were performed using Corning (Corning, NY) Transwell chambers (8.0-μm pore size). Membranes were prepared by coating the upper and lower surfaces with 15 μg/ml collagen (Cohesion, Palo Alto, CA) overnight at 4 °C, and then blocking with DMEM containing 0.25% heat-inactivated BSA for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were then trypsinized, counted, and resuspended in DMEM containing 0.25% heat-inactivated BSA. A total of 1 × 106 cells was added to the upper chamber of the Transwell, and HGF (50 μg/ml) was added to the bottom wells as a chemoattractant. Migration was allowed to proceed for 2.5 h at 37 °C at which time non-migrating cells were removed mechanically from the upper chamber using a cotton swab. Cells that migrated to the lower surface of the Transwell membrane were fixed in methanol for 10 min at room temperature, and membranes were mounted on glass slides using Vectashield mounting medium containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Migration was quantified by counting the number of stained nuclei in five fields of view in each Transwell, in triplicate. Generation and Characterization of a TrkBβ4 Chimeric Receptor—To assess the intrinsic signaling capacity of the β4 integrin intracellular domain, we generated an expression construct consisting of the extracellular domain of the neuronal TrkB receptor fused to the transmembrane and intracellular domains of β4 (Fig. 1A). We used this system as a model of β4 lateral clustering following adhesion of α6β4 to its extracellular matrix ligand by inducing dimerization of these chimeric molecules with the TrkB ligand, BDNF. We also generated a truncated, signaling incompetent TrkB construct consisting of only the extracellular and transmembrane regions of TrkB to use as a negative control (Fig. 1A). This control enabled us to discount the possibility that endogenous receptors mediate BDNF signaling. These constructs, as well as full-length TrkB, were expressed in MDA-MB-435 cancer cells, which express neither the α6β4 integrin nor the TrkB receptor, as shown in immunoblots of extracts from subclones expressing backbone vector (pCLXSN) alone (Fig. 1B). We chose these cells because they have been used in numerous studies of β4 function and signaling, allowing us to compare the signaling capability of the TrkBβ4 chimera to that of wild-type α6β4 (12Jauliac S. Lopez-Rodriguez C. Shaw L.M. Brown L.F. Rao A. Toker A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 21Shaw L.M. Rabinovitz I. Wang H.H. Toker A. Mercurio A.M.

Expression of the transfected proteins in stable clones was confirmed by immunoblotting using an Ab against the extracellular domain of TrkB (anti-TrkB), which recognizes all three proteins, and one against the intracellular domain (carboxyl 20 amino acids) of β4 (505), which recognizes only the TrkBβ4 chimera (Fig. 1B). To confirm cell surface localization of these expressed proteins, we performed biotinylation followed by immunoprecipitation with streptavidin-agarose and immunoblotting for TrkB. As shown in Fig. 1C, the TrkBβ4 chimera, as well as the full-length TrkB and TrkBextra proteins, were all immunoprecipitated, indicating that they are localized at the cell surface. The TrkBβ4 chimera, unlike the intact α6β4 integrin, should not associate with the α6 subunit, because the association of the α and β subunits of integrin heterodimers occurs through their extracellular domains (31Hynes R.O. Cell. 2002; 110: 673-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6687) Google Scholar). Indeed, as shown in Fig. 1D, TrkBβ4 was not detected by immunoblotting in α6 immunoprecipitates, although the full-length β4 subunit was detected. Moreover, we were unable to detect any association of the TrkBβ4 chimera with tetraspanins (data not shown), a result that is consistent with the observation that this association occurs though the α6 subunit of α6β4 (32Sterk L.M.

The neurotrophin, BDNF, not only binds to the TrkB receptor but also binds to the non-selective p75 neurotrophic receptor (p75NTR) with a lower affinity (34Barbacid M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 148-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Expression of p75NTR has been observed in several non-neuronal cell types and cancers (35Kruttgen A. Schneider I. Weis J. Brain Pathol. 2006; 16: 304-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 36Sariola H. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 1061-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), including melanoma cells (37Puma P. Buxser S.E. Watson L. Kelleher D.J. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3370-3375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Given that the MDA-MB-435 cell line may possess properties of melanoma cells (26Rae J.M. Creighton C.J. Meck J.M. Haddad B.R. Johnson M.D. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2007; 104: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), we examined whether these cells express p75NTR, to exclude the possibility of signaling through p75NTR following BDNF treatment. Expression of p75NTR mRNA was examined by reverse transcription-PCR. Although the melanoma cell line, A875, expresses a significant amount of mRNA for p75NTR, the MDA-MB-435 TrkBβ4 cell line did not express mRNA for this receptor (Fig. 1E). Dimerization of the β4 Intracellular Domain Induces SHP-2 Binding and Activation—A recent report demonstrated that signaling through the Met receptor can promote the association of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 with the β4 intracellular domain (29Bertotti A. Comoglio P.M. Trusolino L. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 993-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). A key issue that has not been addressed, however, is whether clustering of the β4 intracellular domain by itself is sufficient to induce SHP-2 binding in the absence of growth factor stimulation. The TrkBβ4 chimera provided an ideal model system for testing this issue. SHP-2 was immunoprecipitated from MDA-MB-435 cells expressing TrkBβ4, and the presence of TrkBβ4 in these immunoprecipitates was assessed by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 2A, BDNF stimulation resulted in a significant increase in the amount of TrkBβ4 that co-immunoprecipitated with SHP-2. To verify this finding, we performed the reverse immunoprecipitation to de"
https://openalex.org/W1990994212,"Background Reversible phosphorylation catalysed by kinases is probably the most important regulatory mechanism in eukaryotes. Methodology/Principal Findings We studied the in vitro phosphorylation of peptide arrays exhibiting the majority of PhosphoBase-deposited protein sequences, by factors in cell lysates from representatives of various branches of the eukaryotic species. We derived a set of substrates from the PhosphoBase whose phosphorylation by cellular extracts is common to the divergent members of different kingdoms and thus may be considered a minimal eukaryotic phosphoproteome. The protein kinases (or kinome) responsible for phosphorylation of these substrates are involved in a variety of processes such as transcription, translation, and cytoskeletal reorganisation. Conclusions/Significance These results indicate that the divergence in eukaryotic kinases is not reflected at the level of substrate phosphorylation, revealing the presence of a limited common substrate space for kinases in eukaryotes and suggests the presence of a set of kinase substrates and regulatory mechanisms in an ancestral eukaryote that has since remained constant in eukaryotic life."
https://openalex.org/W2088345598,"The HIV-1 nucleocapsid is formed during protease (PR)-directed viral maturation, and is transformed into pre-integration complexes following reverse transcription in the cytoplasm of the infected cell. Here, we report a detailed transmission electron microscopy analysis of the impact of HIV-1 PR and reverse transcriptase (RT) on nucleocapsid plasticity, using in vitro reconstitutions. After binding to nucleic acids, NCp15, a proteolytic intermediate of nucleocapsid protein (NC), was processed at its C-terminus by PR, yielding premature NC (NCp9) followed by mature NC (NCp7), through the consecutive removal of p6 and p1. This allowed NC co-aggregation with its single-stranded nucleic-acid substrate. Examination of these co-aggregates for the ability of RT to catalyse reverse transcription showed an effective synthesis of double-stranded DNA that, remarkably, escaped from the aggregates more efficiently with NCp7 than with NCp9. These data offer a compelling explanation for results from previous virological studies that focused on i) Gag processing leading to nucleocapsid condensation, and ii) the disappearance of NCp7 from the HIV-1 pre-integration complexes. We propose that HIV-1 PR and RT, by controlling the nucleocapsid architecture during the steps of condensation and dismantling, engage in a successive nucleoprotein-remodelling process that spatiotemporally coordinates the pre-integration steps of HIV-1. Finally we suggest that nucleoprotein remodelling mechanisms are common features developed by mobile genetic elements to ensure successful replication."
https://openalex.org/W2023135908,"Yersinia pestis, the etiologic agent of plague, was responsible for several devastating epidemics throughout history and is currently of global importance to current public heath and biodefense efforts. Y. pestis is widespread in the Western United States. Because Y. pestis was first introduced to this region just over 100 years ago, there has been little time for genetic diversity to accumulate. Recent studies based upon single nucleotide polymorphisms have begun to quantify the genetic diversity of Y. pestis in North America.To examine the evolution of Y. pestis in North America, a gapped genome sequence of CA88-4125 was generated. Sequence comparison with another North American Y. pestis strain, CO92, identified seven regions of difference (six inversions, one rearrangement), differing IS element copy numbers, and several SNPs.The relatively large number of inverted/rearranged segments suggests that North American Y. pestis strains may be undergoing inversion fixation at high rates over a short time span, contributing to higher-than-expected diversity in this region. These findings will hopefully encourage the scientific community to sequence additional Y. pestis strains from North America and abroad, leading to a greater understanding of the evolutionary history of this pathogen."
https://openalex.org/W2156252708,"SV40 is a small, non enveloped DNA virus with an icosahedral capsid of 45 nm. The outer shell is composed of pentamers of the major capsid protein, VP1, linked via their flexible carboxy-terminal arms. Its morphogenesis occurs by assembly of capsomers around the viral minichromosome. However the steps leading to the formation of mature virus are poorly understood. Intermediates of the assembly reaction could not be isolated from cells infected with wt SV40. Here we have used recombinant VP1 produced in insect cells for in vitro assembly studies around supercoiled heterologous plasmid DNA carrying a reporter gene. This strategy yields infective nanoparticles, affording a simple quantitative transduction assay. We show that VP1 assembles under physiological conditions into uniform nanoparticles of the same shape, size and CsCl density as the wild type virus. The stoichiometry is one DNA molecule per capsid. VP1 deleted in the C-arm, which is unable to assemble but can bind DNA, was inactive indicating genuine assembly rather than non-specific DNA-binding. The reaction requires host enzymatic activities, consistent with the participation of chaperones, as recently shown. Our results demonstrate dramatic cooperativity of VP1, with a Hill coefficient of approximately 6. These findings suggest that assembly may be a concerted reaction. We propose that concerted assembly is facilitated by simultaneous binding of multiple capsomers to a single DNA molecule, as we have recently reported, thus increasing their local concentration. Emerging principles of SV40 assembly may help understanding assembly of other complex systems. In addition, the SV40-based nanoparticles described here are potential gene therapy vectors that combine efficient gene delivery with safety and flexibility."
https://openalex.org/W1999806697,"Objective The objective was to compare the safety and cellular immunogenicity of intradermal versus intramuscular immunization with an HIV-lipopeptide candidate vaccine (LIPO-4) in healthy volunteers. Methodology A randomized, open-label trial with 24 weeks of follow-up was conducted in France at six HIV-vaccine trial sites. Sixty-eight healthy 21– to 55–year-old HIV-uninfected subjects were randomized to receive the LIPO-4 vaccine (four HIV lipopeptides linked to a T-helper–stimulating epitope of tetanus-toxin protein) at weeks 0, 4 and 12, either intradermally (0.1 ml, 100 µg of each peptide) or intramuscularly (0.5 ml, 500 µg of each peptide). Comparative safety of both routes was evaluated. CD8+ T-cell immune responses to HIV epitopes (ELISpot interferon-γ assay) and tetanus toxin-specific CD4+ T-cell responses (lymphoproliferation) were assessed at baseline, two weeks after each injection, and at week 24. Results and Conclusion No severe, serious or life-threatening adverse events were observed. Local pain was significantly more frequent after intramuscular injection, but local inflammatory reactions were more frequent after intradermal immunization. At weeks 2, 6, 14 and 24, the respective cumulative percentages of induced CD8+ T-cell responses to at least one HIV peptide were 9, 33, 39 and 52 (intradermal group) or 14, 20, 26 and 37 (intramuscular group), and induced tetanus toxin-specific CD4+ T-cell responses were 6, 27, 33 and 39 (intradermal), or 9, 46, 54 and 63 (intramuscular). In conclusion, intradermal LIPO-4 immunization was well tolerated, required one-fifth of the intramuscular dose, and induced similar HIV-specific CD8+ T-cell responses. Moreover, the immunization route influenced which antigen-specific T-cells (CD4+ or CD8+) were induced. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00121121"
https://openalex.org/W2066732639,"Chromosome shaping and individualization are necessary requisites to warrant the correct segregation of genomes in either mitotic or meiotic cell divisions. These processes are mainly prompted in vertebrates by three multiprotein complexes termed cohesin and condensin I and II. In the present study we have analyzed by immunostaining the appearance and subcellular distribution of condensin I in mouse mitotic and meiotic chromosomes. Our results demonstrate that in either mitotically or meiotically dividing cells, condensin I is loaded onto chromosomes by prometaphase. Condensin I is detectable as a fuzzy axial structure running inside chromatids of condensed chromosomes. The distribution of condensin I along the chromosome length is not uniform, since it preferentially accumulates close to the chromosome ends. Interestingly, these round accumulations found at the condensin I axes termini colocalized with telomere complexes. Additionally, we present the relative distribution of the condensin I and cohesin complexes in metaphase I bivalents. All these new data have allowed us to propose a comprehensive model for meiotic chromosome structure."
https://openalex.org/W2114158810,"Background Peru has a concentrated HIV epidemic in which men who have sex with men are particularly vulnerable. We describe the lifetime prevalence of same-sex sexual contact and associated risk behaviors of men in Peru's general population, regardless of their sexual identity. Methods and Results A probability sample of males from low-income households in three Peruvian cities completed an epidemiologic survey addressing their sexual risk behavior, including sex with other men. Serum was tested for HSV-2, HIV, and syphilis. Urine was tested for chlamydia and gonorrhea. A total of 2,271 18–30 year old men and women were contacted, of whom 1,645 (72.4%) agreed to participate in the study. Among the sexually experienced men surveyed, 15.2% (85/558, 95% CI: 12.2%–18.2%) reported a history of sex with other men. Men ever reporting sex with men (MESM) had a lower educational level, had greater numbers of sex partners, and were more likely to engage in risk behaviors including unprotected sex with casual partners, paying for or providing compensated sex, and using illegal drugs. MESM were also more likely to have had previous STI symptoms or a prior STI diagnosis, and had a greater prevalence of HSV-2 seropositivity. Conclusions Many low-income Peruvian men have engaged in same-sex sexual contact and maintain greater behavioral and biological risk factors for HIV/STI transmission than non-MESM. Improved surveillance strategies for HIV and STIs among MESM are necessary to better understand the epidemiology of HIV in Latin America and to prevent its further spread."
https://openalex.org/W2091841673,"Our previous studies on scalp-recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) showed that somatosensory N140 evoked by a tactile vibration in working memory tasks was enhanced when human subjects expected a coming visual stimulus that had been paired with the tactile stimulus. The results suggested that such enhancement represented the cortical activities involved in tactile-visual crossmodal association. In the present study, we further hypothesized that the enhancement represented the neural activities in somatosensory and frontal cortices in the crossmodal association. By applying independent component analysis (ICA) to the ERP data, we found independent components (ICs) located in the medial prefrontal cortex (around the anterior cingulate cortex, ACC) and the primary somatosensory cortex (SI). The activity represented by the IC in SI cortex showed enhancement in expectation of the visual stimulus. Such differential activity thus suggested the participation of SI cortex in the task-related crossmodal association. Further, the coherence analysis and the Granger causality spectral analysis of the ICs showed that SI cortex appeared to cooperate with ACC in attention and perception of the tactile stimulus in crossmodal association. The results of our study support with new evidence an important idea in cortical neurophysiology: higher cognitive operations develop from the modality-specific sensory cortices (in the present study, SI cortex) that are involved in sensation and perception of various stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W2054234550,"Hormone level differences are generally accepted as the primary cause for sexual dimorphism in animal and human development. Levels of low molecular weight metabolites also differ between men and women in circulating amino acids, lipids and carbohydrates and within brain tissue. While investigating the metabolism of blue crab tissues using Phosphorus-31 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, we discovered that only the male blue crab (Callinectes sapidus) contained a phosphorus compound with a chemical shift well separated from the expected phosphate compounds. Spectra obtained from male gills were readily differentiated from female gill spectra. Analysis from six years of data from male and female crabs documented that the sex-specificity of this metabolite was normal for this species. Microscopic analysis of male and female gills found no differences in their gill anatomy or the presence of parasites or bacteria that might produce this phosphorus compound. Analysis of a rare gynandromorph blue crab (laterally, half male and half female) proved that this sex-specificity was an intrinsic biochemical process and was not caused by any variations in the diet or habitat of male versus female crabs. The existence of a sex-specific metabolite is a previously unrecognized, but potentially significant biochemical phenomenon. An entire enzyme system has been synthesized and activated only in one sex. Unless blue crabs are a unique species, sex-specific metabolites are likely to be present in other animals. Would the presence or absence of a sex-specific metabolite affect an animal's development, anatomy and biochemistry?"
https://openalex.org/W2044474493,"Background Cellular signaling involves a sequence of events from ligand binding to membrane receptors through transcription factors activation and the induction of mRNA expression. The transcriptional-regulatory system plays a pivotal role in the control of gene expression. A novel computational approach to the study of gene regulation circuits is presented here. Methodology Based on the concept of finite state machine, which provides a discrete view of gene regulation, a novel sequential logic model (SLM) is developed to decipher control mechanisms of dynamic transcriptional regulation of gene expressions. The SLM technique is also used to systematically analyze the dynamic function of transcriptional inputs, the dependency and cooperativity, such as synergy effect, among the binding sites with respect to when, how much and how fast the gene of interest is expressed. Principal Findings SLM is verified by a set of well studied expression data on endo16 of Strongylocentrotus purpuratus (sea urchin) during the embryonic midgut development. A dynamic regulatory mechanism for endo16 expression controlled by three binding sites, UI, R and Otx is identified and demonstrated to be consistent with experimental findings. Furthermore, we show that during transition from specification to differentiation in wild type endo16 expression profile, SLM reveals three binary activities are not sufficient to explain the transcriptional regulation of endo16 expression and additional activities of binding sites are required. Further analyses suggest detailed mechanism of R switch activity where indirect dependency occurs in between UI activity and R switch during specification to differentiation stage. Conclusions/Significance The sequential logic formalism allows for a simplification of regulation network dynamics going from a continuous to a discrete representation of gene activation in time. In effect our SLM is non-parametric and model-independent, yet providing rich biological insight. The demonstration of the efficacy of this approach in endo16 is a promising step for further application of the proposed method."
https://openalex.org/W2065796225,"Background We investigate the usefulness of expressed sequence tags, ESTs, for establishing divergences within the tree of placental mammals. This is done on the example of the established relationships among primates (human), lagomorphs (rabbit), rodents (rat and mouse), artiodactyls (cow), carnivorans (dog) and proboscideans (elephant). Methodology/Principal Findings We have produced 2000 ESTs (1.2 mega bases) from a marsupial mouse and characterized the data for their use in phylogenetic analysis. The sequences were used to identify putative orthologous sequences from whole genome projects. Although most ESTs stem from single sequence reads, the frequency of potential sequencing errors was found to be lower than allelic variation. Most of the sequences represented slowly evolving housekeeping-type genes, with an average amino acid distance of 6.6% between human and mouse. Positive Darwinian selection was identified at only a few single sites. Phylogenetic analyses of the EST data yielded trees that were consistent with those established from whole genome projects. Conclusions The general quality of EST sequences and the general absence of positive selection in these sequences make ESTs an attractive tool for phylogenetic analysis. The EST approach allows, at reasonable costs, a fast extension of data sampling from species outside the genome projects."
https://openalex.org/W2050551938,"Background RNA interference (RNAi), mediated by small interfering RNA (siRNA), is an effective method used to silence gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. Upon introduction into target cells, siRNAs incorporate into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). The antisense strand of the siRNA duplex then “guides” the RISC to the homologous mRNA, leading to target degradation and gene silencing. In recent years, various vector-based siRNA expression systems have been developed which utilize opposing polymerase III promoters to independently drive expression of the sense and antisense strands of the siRNA duplex from the same template. Principal Findings We show here the use of a ligase chain reaction (LCR) to develop a new vector system called pInv-H1 in which a DNA sequence encoding a specific siRNA is placed between two inverted minimal human H1 promoters (∼100 bp each). Expression of functional siRNAs from this construct has led to efficient silencing of both reporter and endogenous genes. Furthermore, the inverted H1 promoter-siRNA expression cassette was used to generate a retrovirus vector capable of transducing and silencing expression of the targeted protein by>80% in target cells. Conclusions The unique design of this construct allows for the efficient exchange of siRNA sequences by the directional cloning of short oligonucleotides via asymmetric restriction sites. This provides a convenient way to test the functionality of different siRNA sequences. Delivery of the siRNA cassette by retroviral transduction suggests that a single copy of the siRNA expression cassette efficiently knocks down gene expression at the protein level. We note that this vector system can potentially be used to generate a random siRNA library. The flexibility of the ligase chain reaction suggests that additional control elements can easily be introduced into this siRNA expression cassette."
