https://openalex.org/W2302970633,"Modulating metal oxides The more difficult step in fuel cells and water electrolysis is the oxygen evolution reaction. The search for earth-abundant materials to replace noble metals for this reaction often turns to oxides of three-dimensional metals such as iron. Zhang et al. show that the applied voltages needed to drive this reaction are reduced for iron-cobalt oxides by the addition of tungsten. The addition of tungsten favorably modulates the electronic structure of the oxyhydroxide. A key development is to keep the metals well mixed and avoid the formation of separate phases.

https://openalex.org/W2310703973,"A comparison of DFT methods Density functional theory (DFT) is now routinely used for simulating material properties. Many software packages are available, which makes it challenging to know which are the best to use for a specific calculation. Lejaeghere et al. compared the calculated values for the equation of states for 71 elemental crystals from 15 different widely used DFT codes employing 40 different potentials (see the Perspective by Skylaris). Although there were variations in the calculated values, most recent codes and methods converged toward a single value, with errors comparable to those of experiment.

One way to approach this is to build a minimal genome that includes only the genes essential for life. In 2010, a 1079-kb genome based on the genome of Mycoplasma mycoides (JCV-syn1.0) was chemically synthesized and supported cell growth when transplanted into cytoplasm. Hutchison III et al. used a design, build, and test cycle to reduce this genome to 531 kb (473 genes). The resulting JCV-syn3.0 retains genes involved in key processes such as transcription and translation, but also contains 149 genes of unknown function.

https://openalex.org/W2307185071,"Brazil has experienced an unprecedented epidemic of Zika virus (ZIKV), with ~30,000 cases reported to date. ZIKV was first detected in Brazil in May 2015, and cases of microcephaly potentially associated with ZIKV infection were identified in November 2015. We performed next-generation sequencing to generate seven Brazilian ZIKV genomes sampled from four self-limited cases, one blood donor, one fatal adult case, and one newborn with microcephaly and congenital malformations. Results of phylogenetic and molecular clock analyses show a single introduction of ZIKV into the Americas, which we estimated to have occurred between May and December 2013, more than 12 months before the detection of ZIKV in Brazil. The estimated date of origin coincides with an increase in air passengers to Brazil from ZIKV-endemic areas, as well as with reported outbreaks in the Pacific Islands. ZIKV genomes from Brazil are phylogenetically interspersed with those from other South American and Caribbean countries. Mapping mutations onto existing structural models revealed the context of viral amino acid changes present in the outbreak lineage; however, no shared amino acid changes were found among the three currently available virus genomes from microcephaly cases. Municipality-level incidence data indicate that reports of suspected microcephaly in Brazil best correlate with ZIKV incidence around week 17 of pregnancy, although this correlation does not demonstrate causation. Our genetic description and analysis of ZIKV isolates in Brazil provide a baseline for future studies of the evolution and molecular epidemiology of this emerging virus in the Americas."

https://openalex.org/W2307860721,"Perovskite solar cells recycle photons Inorganic-organic perovskite solar cells are very efficient in part because the charge carriers exhibit very long path lengths. Pazos-Outón et al. show that photon recycling, as seen previously in highly efficient gallium arsenide solar cells, contributes to this effect (see the Perspective by Yablonovitch). In most solar cells, the recombination of photogenerated charge carriers (electrons and holes) wastes all of the energy. In these lead tri-iodide cells, recombination emits a photon that can be reabsorbed and create more charge carriers. Science , this issue p. 1430 ; see also p. 1401"

Scientists aim to design vaccines that would elicit such antibodies. Jardine et al. report an important step toward this goal: They engineered an immunogen that could engage B cells from HIV-uninfected individuals that express the germline versions of the immunoglobulin genes harbored by a particular class of bNAbs. The frequencies of these B cells, their affinities for the immunogen, and structural analysis suggest that the immunogen is a promising candidate. Further shaping of the B cell response with subsequent immunogens may eventually elicit bNAbs in people. Science , this issue p. 1458"

Grosmark and Buzsáki observed that both familiar and novel aspects of learned information are replayed during synchronous bursts of activity in the hippocampus. Familiarity was encoded by fast-firing less-modifiable neurons that showed rate and sequence correlations that persisted into postlearning sleep. The novel features of an experience were represented by a different set of slowly firing and highly plastic cells. Science , this issue p. 1440"
https://openalex.org/W2303084576,"Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) may provide a biological alternative to fix atmospheric N2 and delay N remobilisation in maize plant to increase crop yield, based on an understanding that plant-N remobilisation is directly correlated to its plant senescence. Thus, four PGPR strains were selected from a series of bacterial strains isolated from maize roots at two locations in Malaysia. The PGPR strains were screened in vitro for their biochemical plant growth-promoting (PGP) abilities and plant growth promotion assays. These strains were identified as Klebsiella sp. Br1, Klebsiella pneumoniae Fr1, Bacillus pumilus S1r1 and Acinetobacter sp. S3r2 and a reference strain used was Bacillus subtilis UPMB10. All the PGPR strains were tested positive for N2 fixation, phosphate solubilisation and auxin production by in vitro tests. In a greenhouse experiment with reduced fertiliser-N input (a third of recommended fertiliser-N rate), the N2 fixation abilities of PGPR in association with maize were determined by 15N isotope dilution technique at two harvests, namely, prior to anthesis (D50) and ear harvest (D65). The results indicated that dry biomass of top, root and ear, total N content and bacterial colonisations in non-rhizosphere, rhizosphere and endosphere of maize roots were influenced by PGPR inoculation. In particular, the plants inoculated with B. pumilus S1r1 generally outperformed those with the other treatments. They produced the highest N2 fixing capacity of 30.5% (262 mg N2 fixed plant-1) and 25.5% (304 mg N2 fixed plant-1) of the total N requirement of maize top at D50 and D65, respectively. N remobilisation and plant senescence in maize were delayed by PGPR inoculation, which is an indicative of greater grain production. This is indicated by significant interactions between PGPR strains and time of harvests for parameters on N uptake and at. % 15Ne of tassel. The phenomenon is also supported by the lower N content in tassels of maize treated with PGPR, namely, B. pumilus S1r1, K. pneumoniae Fr1, B. subtilis UPMB10 and Acinetobacter sp. S3r2 at D65 harvest. This study provides evidence that PGPR inoculation, namely, B. pumilus S1r1 can biologically fix atmospheric N2 and provide an alternative technique, besides plant breeding, to delay N remobilisation in maize plant for higher ear yield (up to 30.9%) with reduced fertiliser-N input."

https://openalex.org/W2307226936,"Organic contributions to cloud theory Current theories about the formation of cloud droplets from aerosol particles containing organic components assume that the organic molecules are distributed throughout the droplet. Ruehl et al. show that this assumption is not always correct (see the Perspective by Noziere). During droplet nucleation, droplet diameters were 50% larger than predicted by the standard model. This suggests that the organic particles reside in a surface layer rather than in the bulk of the droplet. Models that neglect organic surface activity will thus underestimate how well organic-rich particles seed clouds. Science , this issue p. 1447 ; see also p. 1396"

To investigate the role of TM6SF2 in hepatic triglyceride (TG) metabolism, we inactivated the gene in mice. Chronic inactivation of Tm6sf2 in mice is associated with hepatic steatosis, hypocholesterolemia, and transaminitis, thus recapitulating the phenotype observed in humans. No dietary challenge was required to elicit the phenotype. Immunocytochemical and cell fractionation studies revealed that TM6SF2 was present in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex, whereas the excess neutral lipids in the Tm6sf2−/− mice were located in lipid droplets. Plasma VLDL-TG levels were reduced in the KO animals due to a 3-fold decrease in VLDL-TG secretion rate without any associated reduction in hepatic apoB secretion. Both VLDL particle size and plasma cholesterol levels were significantly reduced in KO mice. Despite levels of TM6SF2 protein being 10-fold higher in the small intestine than in the liver, dietary lipid absorption was only modestly reduced in the KO mice. Our data, taken together, reveal that TM6SF2 is required to mobilize neutral lipids for VLDL assembly but is not required for secretion of apoB-containing lipoproteins.

Obesity is the major risk factor for accumulation of excess hepatic fat, but liver fat content varies widely among obese individuals (1.Browning J.D. Szczepaniak L.S. Dobbins R. Nuremberg P.

The reasons for these wide variations in susceptibility to NAFLD are not known. As a first step toward elucidating the pathophysiology of the disorder, we screened the Dallas Heart Study population for DNA sequence variations associated with liver fat content, as determined by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (3.Szczepaniak L.S.

To elucidate the biologic function of TM6SF2 and the pathogenic mechanisms of TM6SF2-associated liver disease, we generated mice in which expression of the gene was ablated by insertional mutagenesis using a gene trap vector. Here we show that chronic germ line inactivation of Tm6sf2 leads to accumulation of TG in enterocytes as well as hepatocytes. TM6SF2 is expressed both in the ER and in the Golgi complex, and we provide evidence that the polytopic protein participates in lipidation of apoB-containing lipoproteins without interfering with secretion of the particles from the liver. Animals were maintained on a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle and fed ad libitum Teklad Rodent Diet 2016 (Harlan Teklad), a high fat diet (D12451; 45% kcal from lard; Research Diets), or a high sucrose diet (HSD) (number 901683; 74% kcal from sucrose; MP Biomedicals) with free access to water. All experimental protocols were approved by the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center Institutional Animal Care and Research Committee. For the fasting-refeeding experiments, chow-fed male C57BL/6N mice (n = 4 mice/group, age 8 weeks) were fasted for 18 h (2:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m.) and then refed with an HSD (number 901683, MP Biomedicals) for 6 h (8:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m.) for 3 days. On the morning of the fourth day, mice in the fasted group were deprived of food for an additional 6 h (total: 24-h fast), and the refed group was given food (HSD) for 6 h. The two groups of mice were sacrificed simultaneously, and the livers were collected. For all other measurements, mice were fed ad libitum overnight, and food was withdrawn at 7:00 a.m. Blood and tissue samples were taken at 11:00 a.m., 4 h after food withdrawal. Total body fat and lean body mass were determined by nuclear magnetic resonance imaging using a Minispec MQ10 analyzer (Bruker). Mouse embryonic stem cells in which one Tm6sf2 allele was inactivated (Fig. 1D) were purchased from the Knock-out Mouse Project (Davis, CA). The cells were injected into C57BL/6N (B6N-Tyrc-Brd/BrdCrCrl, albino, Charles River Laboratories) early stage mouse embryos, and the embryos were implanted into the uteri of C57BL/6N albino female mice. Chimeric males generated from these embryos were selected, and those with the greatest proportion of mutant cells (assessed by coat color) were bred with C57BL/6N albino females (Charles River Laboratories). Black offspring were genotyped and back-crossed with C57BL/6N females. Offspring of heterozygous (Tm6sf2+/−) matings were used for all experiments described in this paper. DNA (∼100 ng) extracted from the tails of mice was PCR-amplified using two forward oligonucleotides (5′-taattatgtctttctcccctatgccc-3′ (WT) and 5′-ttatacgaagttatggtctgagctcg-3′ (KO)) and a reverse primer (5′-ggcagaggcaggcaagtttc-3′). PCR products were size-fractionated on 2% agarose gels and visualized with ethidium bromide. mRNA levels were determined by real-time PCR as described (20.Engelking L.J. Kuriyama H. Hammer R.E. Horton J.D. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Liang G. Overexpression of Insig-1 in the livers of transgenic mice inhibits SREBP processing and reduces insulin-stimulated lipogenesis.J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 113: 1168-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Mouse 36B4 was used as an internal control. Lipids were extracted from pieces of liver (95–125 mg) using the method of Folch and Lees (21.Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.H. A simple method for the isolation and purification of total lipides from animal tissues.J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tissue levels of TG, cholesterol, cholesteryl ester, free cholesterol, and phosphatidylcholine were measured using enzymatic assays (Infinity, Thermo Electron Corp., and Wako Inc.) and normalized to sample weight. Serum levels of alanine transaminase, aspartate aminotransferase, TG, cholesterol, albumin, and glucose were measured using the Vitros 250 system (GMI Inc.). Serum levels of nonesterified fatty acids were measured by enzymatic assay using a commercial reagent (Wako Inc.). ELISAs were used to quantify serum insulin (Crystal Chem Inc.) and plasma PCSK9 levels. For the PCSK9 assays, LumiNunc Maxisorp assay plates (NalgeNunc) were coated with polyclonal rabbit anti-mouse PCSK9 antibody (clone IgG-551C, Jay Horton, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center) diluted to 5 μg/ml in 100 μl of Buffer A (100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Na3PO4, pH 7.5). After an overnight incubation at 4 °C, plates were washed three times with 350 μl of PBST (PBS with Tween 20 (0.05%), pH 7.4) and then incubated in 150 μl of 0.5% BSA in Buffer A for 1 h at room temperature. All subsequent plate washes were conducted on a BioTek ELv405 plate washer. Standards and antibodies were diluted in Buffer A plus 0.5% BSA. Duplicate plasma samples (1 μl) were applied to each well. A standard curve was constructed using purified mouse PCSK9 serially diluted to final concentrations of 0.39–50 ng/ml. Plates were shaken at 37 °C for 2.5 h, and then the samples were washed before adding 100 μl of rabbit anti-mouse PCSK9 polyclonal antibody (IgG-552C, biotinylated with EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-Biotin kit, Pierce). After 2 h of incubation at room temperature, the plate was washed again. A total of 100 μl of avidin-HRP (1:40,000; Pierce) was added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After a final wash, 100 μl of SuperSignal ELISA Pico Substrate (Pierce) was added for 1 min. Luminescence was quantified using a ThermoFisher Luminex luminometer. Linear regression analysis of the standard curve was used to determine concentrations of PCSK9. To measure plasma lipid and lipoprotein levels, blood was collected from mice fasted for 4 h, and plasma from 4–5 mice was pooled (total volume 400 μl) and size-fractionated on a fast performance liquid chromatography (FPLC) Superose 6 column (GE Healthcare). A total of 42 fractions (300 μl each) were collected, and cholesterol and TG content of each fraction were measured using enzymatic assays (Infinity, Thermo Scientific). To analyze the fatty acid composition of different lipid classes, pieces of liver (50–60 mg) were homogenized in 5 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) and 1 ml of NaCl. Homogenized samples were centrifuged at 4,000 × g for 10 min at room temperature, and the lower phases were collected. One-third of the extract was dried under N2, and the residue was resuspended in 100 μl of chloroform. Triglycerides, phospholipid (phosphatidylcholine), cholesteryl esters, and nonesterified fatty acids were separated by thin layer chromatography on silica plates using hexane/diethyl ether/acetic acid (120, 30, and 3 ml, respectively) as the mobile phase. Bands corresponding to each lipid class were visualized using iodine vapor, excised, and placed in 2 ml of methanol/benzene (4:1). Acetyl chloride (200 μl) was added as the sample was vortexed. The sample was incubated at 100 °C for 1 h and then allowed to cool to room temperature. Once at room temperature, 5 ml of 6% aqueous K2CO3 was added slowly, followed by the addition of 1.5 ml of benzene. Samples were mixed and centrifuged at 4,000 × g for 10 min. The upper phase was removed, dried under N2, and reconstituted in 150 μl of hexane. Fatty acids were measured by gas chromatography (GC) using a Hewlett Packard 6890 series GC system. The identities of the fatty acids were determined by comparing the retention times with fatty acid standards (GLC-744, NU-Chek Prep) using pentadecanoic acid (C15:0) as an internal standard. Fatty acid concentrations were calculated based on the area of the C15:0 peak. Sterols were extracted from bile collected from the gall bladders of mice after a 4-h fast and measured using GC-MS. Eluted sterols were identified and quantified using electron ionization-MS in single-ion-monitoring mode, as described previously (22.Wang J. Mitsche M.A. Lütjohann D. Cohen J.C. Xie X.S. Hobbs H.H. Relative roles of ABCG5/ABCG8 in liver and intestine.J. Lipid Res. 2015; 56: 319-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Individual sterols were identified using a pattern of three ions. The sterol levels were quantified using ions with the following m/z: cholesterol, 458; campesterol, 382; sitosterol, 396; stigmasterol, 484. For Oil Red O staining, livers were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h and then equilibrated in 10% and then 18% sucrose (all in PBS) for 24 h each at 4 °C. Tissue was cryosectioned, brought to room temperature, and air-dried for 2 h and then fixed in methanol-free paraformaldehyde (4%). Slides were washed three times with H2O and then incubated for 10 min in 0.18% Oil Red O (Sigma) prepared in 60% isopropyl alcohol. Slides were washed five times in H2O. Nuclei were counterstained with hematoxylin, and the coverslips were affixed with aqueous mounting medium (Vector Laboratories). Sections were visualized using a Leica microscope (DM2000) at ×20, ×40, and ×63 magnification. The numbers and sizes of lipid droplets (original magnification ×63) were determined in five randomly selected images from each slide (n = 4 mice/group) using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health). To image very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) using electron microscopy, 400 μl of plasma was obtained from WT and KO mice after a 4-h fast. Plasma was placed at the bottom of an ultracentrifuge tube (1 ml) and overlaid with 600 μl of KBr (1.006 g/ml) solution. Samples were centrifuged at 434,000 × g for 2 h at 16 °C in a S120-AT2 rotor. A total of 200 μl from the top of tube was collected (VLDL fraction). A 5-μl aliquot of the VLDL fraction was applied to a carbon-coated copper grid and stained with 2.0% uranyl acetate for 15 min (23.Rong X. Wang B. Dunham M.M. Hedde P.N. Wong J.S. Gratton E.

Lpcat3-dependent production of arachidonoyl phospholipids is a key determinant of triglyceride secretion.Elife. 2015; https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06557Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Grids were visualized with a Tecnai G2 Spirit transmission electron microscope (FEI). Images of VLDL were recorded on a Gatan 2,000 × 2,000 CCD camera, and the size distribution of the particles was determined using ImageJ (10 random images/group). Liver tissue (50–100 mg) was homogenized in RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1.0% IGEPAL CA-630, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, supplemented with protease inhibitors (Protease Inhibitor Mixture, Roche Applied Science)). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation (12,000 × g) for 15 min at 4 °C, mixed with 2× Western blot Laemmli sample buffer (65.8 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2.1% SDS, 26.3% (w/v) glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue, 5% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol), and incubated at 37°C for 1 h. Samples were size-fractionated by 10% SDS-PAGE, and proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane (Immobilin-FL, Millipore). Membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with antibodies against the following proteins (source, catalogue number, and dilution of the antibodies are given in parentheses): calnexin (Enzo, ADI-SPA-860-F; 1:5,000), PLIN2 (perlipin 2) (Fitzgerald Industries International, 20R-AP002; 1:5,000), lactate dehydrogenase (Abcam, ab134187; 1:1,000), PNPLA3 (R&D Systems, AF5179; 1:1,000), FASN (320D, rabbit polyclonal anti-mouse antibody, gift from Jay Horton; 1:5,000), adipocyte TG lipase (Cell Signaling, 2439S; 1:1,000), SAR1b (Abcam, ab155278; 1:5,000), microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTTP) (BD Biosciences, 612022; 1:5,000), calnexin N terminus (Novus, NB100-1965; 1:1,000), BiP (Cell Signaling, 3183S; 1:1,000), GOS28 (Abcam, ab82961; 1:1,000), phospholipid transfer protein (Novus, NB400-106; 1:500), LSD1 (Cell Signaling, 2184; 1:1,000), and apoB (Abcam, ab20737, 1:1000). A polyclonal rabbit anti-mouse anti-TM6SF2 antibody (792D) and mouse mAbs (clones 8B3-B7 and 8B3-E1) were raised against a keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated peptide corresponding to the C-terminal 15 amino acids of mouse TM6SF2 (CALPSSPQDQDKKQQ obtained from GenScript). We used a goat anti-mouse IgG, Fcγ fragment-specific antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Inc., 115-035-071; 1:3000) to detect the primary anti-mouse TM6SF2 antibody. To detect apoB, liver lysates were prepared by homogenizing tissue in modified RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1.0% IGEPAL CA-630, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% SDS, 1 m urea, and 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0) supplemented with protease inhibitors. Lysates were size-fractionated by 5% SDS-PAGE and then transferred overnight to a Hybond-C membrane (GE Healthcare) at 0.1 A at 4 °C overnight. Membranes were incubated with an apoB antibody overnight at 4 °C. ApoB was detected in mouse plasma by immunoblotting. Plasma (10 μl) was added to 50 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer and 40 μl of RIPA buffer, and 2 μl of the mixture was size-fractionated on 4–12% BisTris gels (Bio-Rad). To assess the processing of SREBP-1c (sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c), mice were metabolically synchronized for 3 days (fasting from 8:00 a.m. until 8:00 p.m.; refeeding 8:00 p.m. until 8:00 a.m.) and sacrificed at the end of the last refeeding cycle. Livers were collected and stored at −80°C. A total of 100 mg of liver was homogenized on ice in 1 ml of homogenization buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, 5 mm DTT, and 1 mm PMSF) supplemented with 5× protease inhibitors using a T10 mechanical homogenizer (IKA) set on maximum speed. Lysates were centrifuged for 5 min at 3,000 × g at 4 °C, and 800 μl of supernatant was collected (the postnuclear supernatant). The remaining pellet and supernatant were maintained at 4 °C (the nuclear fraction). The postnuclear supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min (47,100 rpm; Sorvall S120AT2 rotor), and the pellet was collected (membrane fraction). The membrane fraction was dissolved in 400 μl of RIPA buffer, and the protein concentration was determined using a BCA kit (Pierce). The remaining supernatant was aspirated from the nuclear fraction, and the pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of homogenization buffer and centrifuged for 5 min at 1,000 × g at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was resuspended in 300 μl of Buffer B (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 2.5% glycerol (v/v), 0.42 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA supplemented with 5× protease inhibitor). The resuspended nuclei were rocked for 45 min at 4 °C and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min (47,100 rpm, Sorvall S120AT2 rotor). The supernatant (nuclear extract) was collected, and the protein concentration was determined. A total 20 μg of protein was mixed with 6XSDS sample buffer (0.375 m Tris, pH 6.8, 12% SDS, 60% glycerol (v/v), 0.6 m DTT, 0.06% bromphenol blue) and heated at 95 °C for 8 min. Equal volumes of nuclear and membrane fractions from each group (n = 4) were pooled, and 40 μg of protein was loaded onto an SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel. The blot was incubated overnight at 4 °C with rabbit anti-mouse SREBP-1c antibody that was developed in the Department of Molecular Genetics (University of Texas Southwestern). After signal detection, membranes were stripped (Restore Western blot stripping buffer, Thermo Scientific) and reblotted with antibodies against calnexin and LSD1 to determine the purity and loading consistency of each fraction. The ECL signal was detected and quantified using a LI-COR Biosciences Odyssey Fc imager. To measure rates of VLDL-TG secretion, five female mice (10 weeks old) of each genotype were fasted for 4 h at the beginning of the light cycle. A bolus of Triton WR-1339 (Tyloxapol, Sigma-Aldrich) (500 mg/kg) was given via the tail vein (24.Jones C. Garuti R. Michaely P. Li W.P. Maeda N. Cohen J.C. Herz J. Hobbs H.H.

Blood samples (∼40 μl) were collected from the tail vein in EDTA-coated tubes (Microvette 500 KE, Sartedt) before and 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after the injection of detergent. ApoB secretion rates were measured exactly as described previously (25.Wang Y. McNutt M.C. Banfi S. Levin M.G. Holland W.L. Gusarova V. Gromada J. Cohen J.C. Hobbs H.H.

Briefly, each mouse was injected with 200 μCi of [35S]methionine (1,175 Ci/mmol) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and Triton WR-1339 (500 mg/kg). Blood was collected from the tail vein into aprotinin-containing EDTA-coated tubes, before and 45 and 90 min after the injection. Plasma from the 90 min time point was isolated, diluted 1:20 in PBS containing protease inhibitors, and incubated with deoxycholate (100 μl of 0.15% solution) for 10 min at room temperature. Trichloroacetic acid (TCA) (50 μl) was added, and the mixture was incubated for 30 min on ice and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was resuspended, washed twice in ice-cold acetone, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Pellets were air-dried, dissolved in buffer containing 2% SDS and 1 m urea, and heated to 37 °C for 1 h. Samples were mixed with 6× SDS sample buffer, heated for 5 min at 95 °C, and size-fractionated by SDS 5%-PAGE. Gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film (BIOMAX XAR) for 4 days at −80 °C.

Barrera et al. investigated whether amino acid variants changed the DNA binding specificity or affinity of transcription factors. Predictive analyses identified changes in the proteins, and protein-binding microarrays verified changes that affected transcription factor function, including those associated with disease. Thus, within-human protein sequence variation can affect transcriptional regulatory networks, which, depending on the genetic variant, may confer robustness and buffer against amino acid changes and could explain phenotypic variation among individuals.

https://openalex.org/W2304170721,"Patients with cirrhosis often have functional limitations, decreased muscle mass, and a high risk of falls. These variables could improve with exercise. The aim was to study the effects of moderate exercise on functional capacity, body composition and risk of falls in patients with cirrhosis. Twenty-three cirrhotic patients were randomized to an exercise programme (n = 14) or to a relaxation programme (n = 9). Both programmes consisted of a one-hour session 3 days a week for 12 weeks. At the beginning and end of the study, we measured functional capacity using the cardiopulmonary exercise test, evaluated body composition using anthropometry and dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, and estimated risk of falls using the Timed Up&Go test. In the exercise group, cardiopulmonary exercise test showed an increase in total effort time (p<0.001) and ventilatory anaerobic threshold time (p = 0.009). Upper thigh circumference increased and mid-arm and mid-thigh skinfold thickness decreased. Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry showed a decrease in fat body mass (-0.94 kg, 95%CI -0.48 to -1.41, p = 0.003) and an increase in lean body mass (1.05 kg, 95%CI 0.27 to 1.82, p = 0.01), lean appendicular mass (0.38 kg, 95%CI 0.06 to 0.69, p = 0.03) and lean leg mass (0.34 kg, 95%CI 0.10 to 0.57, p = 0.02). The Timed Up&Go test decreased at the end of the study compared to baseline (p = 0.02). No changes were observed in the relaxation group. We conclude that a moderate exercise programme in patients with cirrhosis improves functional capacity, increases muscle mass, and decreases body fat and the Timed Up&Go time.

https://openalex.org/W2304796014,"Variability for a day or a season Species that experience larger seasonal climatic fluctuations are likely to be more physiologically flexible and thus likely to occur across a wider elevational range. Daily changes in temperature are also common but have rarely been considered. Chan et al. used a global data set of vertebrates to look at how these two different sets of variation affect a species' elevational distribution (see the Perspective by Perez et al. ). Unexpectedly, larger daily fluctuations were associated with smaller elevational distributions. Thus, specialists are favored where daily fluctuations are dominant, whereas generalists are favored where seasonal fluctuations are the main climate influence.

We found an efficient small-scale dynamo that suppresses small-scale flows, which mimics the properties of large diffusivity. As a result, the global-scale magnetic field is maintained even in the regime of small diffusivities—that is, large Reynolds numbers."

https://openalex.org/W2304133322,"Berberine (BBR) has been shown to exhibit protective effects against diabetes and dyslipidemia. Previous studies have indicated that BBR modulates lipid metabolism and inhibits hepatic gluconeogensis by decreasing expression of Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor-4α (HNF-4α). However, the mechanism involved in this process was unknown. In the current study, we examined the mechanism of how BBR attenuates hepatic gluconeogenesis and the lipid metabolism alterations observed in type 2 diabetic (T2D) mice and in palmitate (PA)-incubated HepG2 cells. Treatment with BBR for 4 weeks improve all biochemical parameters compared to T2D mice. Treatment of T2D mice for 4 weeks or treatment of PA-incubated HepG2 cells for 24 h with BBR decreased expression of HNF-4α and the microRNA miR122, the key gluconeogenesis enzymes Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and Glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) and the key lipid metabolism proteins Sterol response element binding protein-1 (SREBP-1), Fatty acid synthase-1 (FAS-1) and Acetyl-Coenzyme A carboxylase (ACCα) and increased Carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1(CPT-1) compared to T2D mice or PA-incubated HepG2 cells. Expression of HNF-4α in HepG2 cells increased expression of gluconeogenic and lipid metabolism enzymes and BBR treatment or knock down of miR122 attenuated the effect of HNF-4α expression. In contrast, BBR treatment did not alter expression of gluconeogenic and lipid metabolism enzymes in HepG2 cells with knockdown of HNF-4α. In addition, miR122 mimic increased expression of gluconeogenic and lipid metabolism enzymes in HepG2 cells with knockdown of HNF-4α. These data indicate that miR122 is a critical regulator in the downstream pathway of HNF-4α in the regulation of hepatic gluconeogenesis and lipid metabolism in HepG2 cells. The effect of BBR on hepatic gluconeogenesis and lipid metabolism is mediated through HNF-4α and is regulated downstream of miR122. Our data provide new evidence to support HNF-4α and miR122 regulated hepatic gluconeogenesis and lipid metabolism as promising therapeutic targets for the treatment of T2D."
https://openalex.org/W2305497100,"Environmental gradients (EG) related to climate, topography and vegetation are among the most important drivers of broad scale patterns of species richness. However, these different EG do not necessarily drive species richness in similar ways, potentially presenting synergistic associations when driving species richness. Understanding the synergism among EG allows us to address key questions arising from the effects of global climate and land use changes on biodiversity. Herein, we use variation partitioning (also know as commonality analysis) to disentangle unique and shared contributions of different EG in explaining species richness of Neotropical vertebrates. We use three broad sets of predictors to represent the environmental variability in (i) climate (annual mean temperature, temperature annual range, annual precipitation and precipitation range), (ii) topography (mean elevation, range and coefficient of variation of elevation), and (iii) vegetation (land cover diversity, standard deviation and range of forest canopy height). The shared contribution between two types of EG is used to quantify synergistic processes operating among EG, offering new perspectives on the causal relationships driving species richness. To account for spatially structured processes, we use Spatial EigenVector Mapping models. We perform analyses across groups with distinct dispersal abilities (amphibians, non-volant mammals, bats and birds) and discuss the influence of vagility on the partitioning results. Our findings indicate that broad scale patterns of vertebrate richness are mainly affected by the synergism between climate and vegetation, followed by the unique contribution of climate. Climatic factors were relatively more important in explaining species richness of good dispersers. Most of the variation in vegetation that explains vertebrate richness is climatically structured, supporting the productivity hypothesis. Further, the weak synergism between topography and vegetation urges caution when using topographic complexity as a surrogate of habitat (vegetation) heterogeneity."
https://openalex.org/W2304206210,"Retinoic acid is a promising tool in adjuvant cancer therapies, including refractory thyroid cancer, and its biological role is mediated by the retinoic acid receptor beta (RARβ). However, expression of RARβ is lowered in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), contributing to promotion of tumor growth and inefficiency of retinoic acid and radioactive iodine treatment. The causes of aberrant RARB expression are largely unknown. We hypothesized that the culpable mechanisms include the action of microRNAs from the miR-146 family, previously identified as significantly upregulated in PTC tumors. To test this hypothesis, we assessed the expression of RARB as well as miR-146a-5p and miR-146b-5p in 48 PTC tumor/normal tissue pairs by Taqman assay to reveal that the expression of RARB was 3.28-fold decreased, and miR-146b-5p was 28.9-fold increased in PTC tumors. Direct interaction between miRs and RARB was determined in the luciferase assay and further confirmed in cell lines, where overexpression of miR-146a-5p and miR-146b-5p caused a 31% and 33% decrease in endogenous RARB mRNA levels. Inhibition of miR-146a and miR-146b resulted in 62.5% and 45.4% increase of RARB, respectively, and a concomitant decrease in proliferation rates of thyroid cancer cell lines, analyzed in xCELLigence system.We showed that two microRNAs of the miR-146 family directly regulate RARB. Inhibition of miRs resulted in restoration of RARB expression and decreased rates of proliferation of thyroid cancer cells. By restoring RARB levels, microRNA inhibitors may become part of an adjuvant therapy in thyroid cancer patients."

https://openalex.org/W2309174028,"In a microarray study, we found that hepatic miR-291b-3p was significantly increased in leptin-receptor-deficient type 2 mice (db/db), a mouse model of diabetes. The function of miR-291b-3p is unknown. The potential role of miR-291b-3p in regulating hepatic lipid metabolism was explored in this study. High-fat diet (HFD)- and chow-fed mice were injected with an adenovirus expressing a miR-291b-3p inhibitor and a miR-291b-3p mimic through the tail vein. Hepatic lipids and lipogenic gene expression were analyzed. Additionally, gain- and loss-of-function studies were performed in vitro to identify direct targets of miR-291b-3p. MiR-291b-3p expression and the protein levels of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) and fatty acid synthase (FAS) were increased in the steatotic liver of db/db mice and HFD-fed mice versus their respective controls. Inhibition of hepatic miR-291b-3p expression prevented increases in hepatic lipogenesis and steatosis in HFD-fed mice. The opposite was observed when miR-291b-3p was overexpressed in the livers of chow-fed C57BL/6J wild-type mice. In vitro studies revealed that silencing of miR-291b-3p in NCTC1469 hepatic cells ameliorated oleic acid/palmitic acid mixture-induced elevation of cellular triglycerides. Importantly, we identified AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-α1 as a direct target of miR-291b-3p. Using metformin, an activator of AMPK, we showed that AMPK activation-induced inhibition of hepatic lipid accumulation was accompanied by reduced expression of miR-291b-3p in the liver. Liver miR-291b-3p promoted hepatic lipogenesis and lipid accumulation in mice. AMPKα1 is a direct target of miR-291b-3p. In conclusion, our findings indicate that miR-291b-3p promotes hepatic lipogenesis by suppressing AMPKα1 expression and activity, indicating the therapeutic potential of miR-291b-3p inhibitors in fatty liver disease."
https://openalex.org/W2303348722,"Adrenomedullin (AM) is a peptide hormone with numerous effects in the vascular systems. AM signals through the AM1 and AM2 receptors formed by the obligate heterodimerization of a G protein-coupled receptor, the calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CLR), and receptor activity-modifying proteins 2 and 3 (RAMP2 and RAMP3), respectively. These different CLR-RAMP interactions yield discrete receptor pharmacology and physiological effects. The effective design of therapeutics that target the individual AM receptors is dependent on understanding the molecular details of the effects of RAMPs on CLR. To understand the role of RAMP2 and -3 on the activation and conformation of the CLR subunit of AM receptors, we mutated 68 individual amino acids in the juxtamembrane region of CLR, a key region for activation of AM receptors, and determined the effects on cAMP signaling. Sixteen CLR mutations had differential effects between the AM1 and AM2 receptors. Accompanying this, independent molecular modeling of the full-length AM-bound AM1 and AM2 receptors predicted differences in the binding pocket and differences in the electrostatic potential of the two AM receptors. Druggability analysis indicated unique features that could be used to develop selective small molecule ligands for each receptor. The interaction of RAMP2 or RAMP3 with CLR induces conformational variation in the juxtamembrane region, yielding distinct binding pockets, probably via an allosteric mechanism. These subtype-specific differences have implications for the design of therapeutics aimed at specific AM receptors and for understanding the mechanisms by which accessory proteins affect G protein-coupled receptor function."

Moreover, 15 spatial indicators (slope, aspect, elevation, compound topographic index (CTI), CORINE land-cover classification, parent material, texture, world reference base (WRB) soil classification, geological formations, annual average temperature, min-max temperature, total precipitation and average precipitation (for years 1960–1990 and 2000–2010)) were used as auxiliary variables in this prediction. One of the most popular geostatistical techniques, Regression-Kriging (RK), was applied to build the model and assess the distribution of SOC. This study showed that, even though RK method was appropriate for successful SOC mapping, using combined databases was not helpful to increase the statistical significance of the method results for assessing the SOC distribution. According to our results; SOC variation was mainly affected by elevation, slope, CTI, average temperature, average and total precipitation, texture, WRB and CORINE variables for Europe scale in our model. Moreover, the highest average SOC contents were found in the wetland areas; agricultural areas have much lower soil organic carbon content than forest and semi natural areas; Ireland, Sweden and Finland has the highest SOC, on the contrary, Portugal, Poland, Hungary, Spain, Italy have the lowest values with the average 3%."

However, only a few studies on the prevalence and antibiotic resistance of C. difficile in healthy individuals in China have been reported. We employed a spore enrichment culture to screen for C. difficile in the stool samples of 3699 healthy Chinese individuals who were divided into 4 groups: infants younger than 2 years of age and living at home with their parents; children aged 1 to 8 years of age and attending three different kindergarten schools; community-dwelling healthy adult aged 23–60 years old; and healthcare workers aged 28–80 years old. The C. difficile isolates were analyzed for the presence of toxin genes and typed by PCR ribotyping and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). The minimum inhibitory concentration of 8 antimicrobial agents was determined for all of the isolates using the agar dilution method. The intestinal carriage rate in the healthy children was 13.6% and ranged from 0% to 21% depending on age. The carriage rates in the 1654 community-dwelling healthy adults and 348 healthcare workers were 5.5% and 6.3%, respectively. Among the isolates, 226 were toxigenic (225 tcdA+/tcdB+ and 1 tcdA+/tcdB+ ctdA+/ctdB+). Twenty-four ribotypes were found, with the dominant type accounting for 29.7% of the isolates. The toxigenic isolates were typed into 27 MLST genotypes. All of the strains were susceptible to vancomycin, metronidazole, fidaxomicin, and rifaximin. High resistance to levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin at rates of 39.8% and 98.3%, respectively, were observed. ST37 isolates were more resistant to levofloxacin than the other STs. The PCR ribotypes and sequence types from the healthy populations were similar to those from the adult patients."
https://openalex.org/W2305033656,"Nutritional enhancement of crops using genetic engineering can potentially affect herbivorous pests. Recently, oilseed crops have been genetically engineered to produce the long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) at levels similar to that found in fish oil; to provide a more sustainable source of these compounds than is currently available from wild fish capture. We examined some of the growth and development impacts of adding EPA and DHA to an artificial diet of Pieris rapae, a common pest of Brassicaceae plants. We replaced 1% canola oil with EPA: DHA (11:7 ratio) in larval diets, and examined morphological traits and growth of larvae and ensuing adults across 5 dietary treatments. Diets containing increasing amounts of EPA and DHA did not affect developmental phenology, larval or pupal weight, food consumption, nor larval mortality. However, the addition of EPA and DHA in larval diets resulted in progressively heavier adults (F 4, 108 = 6.78; p = 0.011), with smaller wings (p < 0.05) and a higher frequency of wing deformities (R = 0.988; p = 0.001). We conclude that the presence of EPA and DHA in diets of larval P. rapae may alter adult mass and wing morphology; therefore, further research on the environmental impacts of EPA and DHA production on terrestrial biota is advisable."
https://openalex.org/W2311995289,"Mechanisms of abnormal protein phosphorylation that regulate cell invasion and metastasis in pancreatic cancer remain obscure. In this study, we used high-throughput phosphorylation array to test two pancreatic cancer cell lines (PC-1 cells with a low, and PC-1.0 cells with a high potential for invasion and metastasis). We noted that a total of 57 proteins revealed a differential expression (fold change ≥ 2.0). Six candidate proteins were further validated by western blot with results found to be accordance with the array. Of 57 proteins, 32 up-regulated proteins (e.g. CaMK1-α and P90RSK) were mainly involved in ErbB and neurotrophin signaling pathways as determined using DAVID software, while 25 down-regulated proteins (e.g. BID and BRCA1) were closely involved in apoptosis and p53 signaling pathways. Moreover, four proteins (AKT1, Chk2, p53 and P70S6K) with different phosphorylation sites were found, not only among up-regulated, but also among down-regulated proteins. Importantly, specific phosphorylation sites can affect cell biological functions. CentiScaPe software calculated topological characteristics of each node in the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network: we found that AKT1 owns the maximum node degrees and betweenness in the up-regulation protein PPI network (26 nodes, average path length: 1.89, node degrees: 6.62±4.18, betweenness: 22.23±35.72), and p53 in the down-regulation protein PPI network (17 nodes, average path length: 2.04, node degrees: 3.65±2.47, betweenness: 16.59±29.58). In conclusion, the identification of abnormal protein phosphorylation related to invasion and metastasis may allow us to identify new biomarkers in an effort to develop novel therapeutic drug targets for pancreatic cancer treatment."

https://openalex.org/W2303936412,"Radiation therapy is an important treatment choice for unresectable advanced human lung cancers, and a critical adjuvant treatment for surgery. However, radiation as a lung cancer treatment remains far from satisfactory due to problems associated with radiation resistance in cancer cells and severe cytotoxicity to non-cancer cells, which arise at doses typically administered to patients. We have recently identified a promising novel inhibitor of β-catenin/Tcf4 interaction, named BC-23 (C21H14ClN3O4S), which acts as a potent cell death enhancer when used in combination with radiation. Sequential exposure of human p53-null non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) H1299 cells to low doses of x-ray radiation, followed 1 hour later by administration of minimally cytotoxic concentrations of BC-23, resulted in a highly synergistic induction of clonogenic cell death (combination index <1.0). Co-treatment with BC-23 at low concentrations effectively inhibits Wnt/β-catenin signaling and down-regulates c-Myc and cyclin D1 expression. S phase arrest and ROS generation are also involved in the enhancement of radiation effectiveness mediated by BC-23. BC-23 therefore represents a promising new class of radiation enhancer."
https://openalex.org/W2306506154,"Introduction Suspected osteopathology in chronically ill children often necessitates the assessment of bone mineral density. The most frequently used methods are dual-energy X-ray-absorption (DXA) and peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT). The BoneXpert software provides an automated radiogrammatic method to assess skeletal age from digitalized X-rays of the left hand. Furthermore, the program calculates the Bone Health Index (BHI), a measure of cortical thickness and mineralization, which is obtained from indices of three metacarpal bones. In our study, we analyzed the manner in which BHI information provided by BoneXpert compares with DXA or pQCT measurements in youths. Study Design The BHI was retrospectively obtained using digitalized X-rays of the left hand and compared with the results of 203 corresponding DXA readings (Lunar Prodigy, GE Healthcare) of the lumbar vertebrae and femur as well as 117 pQCT readings (XCT 900, Stratec) of the distal radius. Results The BHI values showed a strong positive correlation with the DXA readings at each and all lumbar vertebrae (L1 –L4: r = 0.73; P < 0.0001). The age-adjusted Z-score of L1 –L4 and the height-adjusted score showed a positive correlation with the BHI-SDS (standard deviation score, r = 0.23; P < 0.002 and r = 0.27; P < 0.001, respectively). Total bone mineral density, as assessed via pQCT, also positively correlated with the BHI (r = 0.39; P < 0.0001), but the trabecular values displayed only a weak correlation. Conclusions The BHI obtained using BoneXpert can be a useful parameter in the assessment of bone health in children in most cases. This technique provides observer-independent information on cortical thickness and mineralization based on X-ray imaging of the hands."
https://openalex.org/W2309647741,"Assemblages that are exposed to recurring temporal environmental changes can show changes in their ecological properties. These can be expressed by differences in diversity and assembly rules. Both can be identified using two measures of diversity: functional (FD) and phylogenetic diversity (PD). Frog communities are understudied in this regard, especially during the tadpole life stage. We utilised tadpole assemblages from Madagascan rainforest streams to test predictions of seasonal changes on diversity and assemblage composition and on diversity measures. From the warm-wet to the cool-dry season, species richness (SR) of tadpole assemblages decreased. Also FD and PD decreased, but FD less and PD more than expected by chance. During the dry season, tadpole assemblages were characterised by functional redundancy (among assemblages—with increasing SR), high FD (compared to a null model), and low PD (phylogenetic clustering; compared to a null model). Although mutually contradictory at first glance, these results indicate competition as tadpole community assembly driving force. This is true during the limiting cool-dry season but not during the more suitable warm-wet season. We thereby show that assembly rules can strongly depend on season, that comparing FD and PD can reveal such forces, that FD and PD are not interchangeable, and that conclusions on assembly rules based on FD alone are critical."
https://openalex.org/W2310826711,"Background Pneumonia is the leading infectious cause of mortality in children under five worldwide. Community-level interventions, such as integrated community case management, have great potential to reduce the burden of pneumonia, as well as other diseases, especially in remote populations. However, there are still questions as to whether community health workers (CHW) are able to accurately assess symptoms of pneumonia and prescribe appropriate treatment. This research addresses limitations of previous studies using innovative methodology to assess the accuracy of respiratory rate measurement by CHWs and provides new evidence on the quality of care given for children with symptoms of pneumonia. It is one of few that assesses CHW performance in their usual setting, with independent re-examination by experts, following a considerable period of time post-training of CHWs. Methods In this cross-sectional mixed methods study, 1,497 CHW consultations, conducted by 90 CHWs in two districts of Luapula province, Zambia, were directly observed, with measurement of respiratory rate for children with suspected pneumonia recorded by video. Using the video footage, a retrospective reference standard assessment of respiratory rate was conducted by experts. Counts taken by CHWs were compared against the reference standard and appropriateness of the treatment prescribed by CHWs was assessed. To supplement observational findings, three focus group discussions and nine in depth interviews with CHWs were conducted. Results and Conclusion The findings support existing literature that CHWs are capable of measuring respiratory rates and providing appropriate treatment, with 81% and 78% agreement, respectively, between CHWs and experts. Accuracy in diagnosis could be strengthened through further training and the development of improved diagnostic tools appropriate for resource-poor settings."
https://openalex.org/W2309779914,"Objectives To evaluate sources of error in the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) measurement of percent fibroglandular tissue (%FGT) using two-point Dixon sequences for fat-water separation. Methods Ten female volunteers (median age: 31 yrs, range: 23–50 yrs) gave informed consent following Research Ethics Committee approval. Each volunteer was scanned twice following repositioning to enable an estimation of measurement repeatability from high-resolution gradient-echo (GRE) proton-density (PD)-weighted Dixon sequences. Differences in measures of %FGT attributable to resolution, T1 weighting and sequence type were assessed by comparison of this Dixon sequence with low-resolution GRE PD-weighted Dixon data, and against gradient-echo (GRE) or spin-echo (SE) based T1-weighted Dixon datasets, respectively. Results %FGT measurement from high-resolution PD-weighted Dixon sequences had a coefficient of repeatability of ±4.3%. There was no significant difference in %FGT between high-resolution and low-resolution PD-weighted data. Values of %FGT from GRE and SE T1-weighted data were strongly correlated with that derived from PD-weighted data (r = 0.995 and 0.96, respectively). However, both sequences exhibited higher mean %FGT by 2.9% (p < 0.0001) and 12.6% (p < 0.0001), respectively, in comparison with PD-weighted data; the increase in %FGT from the SE T1-weighted sequence was significantly larger at lower breast densities. Conclusion Although measurement of %FGT at low resolution is feasible, T1 weighting and sequence type impact on the accuracy of Dixon-based %FGT measurements; Dixon MRI protocols for %FGT measurement should be carefully considered, particularly for longitudinal or multi-centre studies."
https://openalex.org/W2304312761,"The biophysical mechanism of the sense of smell, or olfaction, is still highly debated. The mainstream explanation argues for a shape-based recognition of odorant molecules by olfactory receptors, while recent investigations suggest the primary olfactory event to be triggered by a vibrationally-assisted electron transfer reaction. We consider this controversy by studying the influence of a receptor on the vibrational properties of an odorant in atomistic details as the coupling between electronic degrees of freedom of the receptor and the vibrations of the odorant is the key parameter of the vibrationally-assisted electron transfer. Through molecular dynamics simulations we elucidate the binding specificity of a receptor towards acetophenone odorant. The vibrational properties of acetophenone inside the receptor are then studied by the polarizable embedding density functional theory approach, allowing to quantify protein-odorant interactions. Finally, we judge whether the effects of the protein provide any indications towards the existing theories of olfaction."
https://openalex.org/W2306527412,"We use chloroplast DNA sequencing to examine aspects of the pre-European Māori cultivation of an endemic New Zealand root crop, Arthropodium cirratum (rengarenga). Researching the early stages of domestication is not possible for the majority of crops, because their cultivation began many thousands of years ago and/or they have been substantially altered by modern breeding methods. We found high levels of genetic variation and structuring characterised the natural distribution of A. cirratum, while the translocated populations only retained low levels of this diversity, indicating a strong bottleneck even at the early stages of this species’ cultivation. The high structuring detected at four chloroplast loci within the natural A. cirratum range enabled the putative source(s) of the translocated populations to be identified as most likely located in the eastern Bay of Plenty/East Cape region. The high structuring within A. cirratum also has implications for the conservation of genetic diversity within this species, which has undergone recent declines in both its natural and translocated ranges."
https://openalex.org/W2310925577,"The molecular mechanism underlying PKA-mediated regulation of Na(+),K(+)-ATPase was explored in mutagenesis studies of the potential PKA site at Ser-938 and surrounding charged residues. The phosphomimetic mutations S938D/E interfered with Na(+) binding from the intracellular side of the membrane, whereas Na(+) binding from the extracellular side was unaffected. The reduction of Na(+) affinity is within the range expected for physiological regulation of the intracellular Na(+) concentration, thus supporting the hypothesis that PKA-mediated phosphorylation of Ser-938 regulates Na(+),K(+)-ATPase activity in vivo Ser-938 is located in the intracellular loop between transmembrane segments M8 and M9. An extended bonding network connects this loop with M10, the C terminus, and the Na(+) binding region. Charged residues Asp-997, Glu-998, Arg-1000, and Lys-1001 in M10, participating in this bonding network, are crucial to Na(+) interaction. Replacement of Arg-1005, also located in the vicinity of Ser-938, with alanine, lysine, methionine, or serine resulted in wild type-like Na(+) and K(+) affinities and catalytic turnover rate. However, when combined with the phosphomimetic mutation S938E only lysine substitution of Arg-1005 was compatible with Na(+),K(+)-ATPase function, and the Na(+) affinity of this double mutant was reduced even more than in single mutant S938E. This result indicates that the positive side chain of Arg-1005 or the lysine substituent plays a mechanistic role as interaction partner of phosphorylated Ser-938, transducing the phosphorylation signal into a reduced affinity of Na(+) site III. Electrostatic interaction of Glu-998 is of minor importance for the reduction of Na(+) affinity by phosphomimetic S938E as revealed by combining S938E with E998A."
https://openalex.org/W2304574632,"Understanding patterns in species richness and diversity over environmental gradients (such as altitude and depth) is an enduring component of ecology. As most biological communities feature few common and many rare species, quantifying the presence and abundance of rare species is a crucial requirement for analysis of these patterns. Coral reefs present specific challenges for data collection, with limitations on time and site accessibility making efficiency crucial. Many commonly used methods, such as line intercept transects (LIT), are poorly suited to questions requiring the detection of rare events or species. Here, an alternative method for surveying reef-building corals is presented; the point count transect (PCT). The PCT consists of a count of coral colonies at a series of sample stations, located at regular intervals along a transect. In contrast the LIT records the proportion of each species occurring under a transect tape of a given length. The same site was surveyed using PCT and LIT to compare species richness estimates between the methods. The total number of species increased faster per individual sampled and unit of time invested using PCT. Furthermore, 41 of the 44 additional species recorded by the PCT occurred ≤ 3 times, demonstrating the increased capacity of PCT to detect rare species. PCT provides a more accurate estimate of local-scale species richness than the LIT, and is an efficient alternative method for surveying reef corals to address questions associated with alpha-diversity, and rare or incidental events."
https://openalex.org/W2305584478,"Yeast strain Clavispora NRRL Y-50464 is able to produce cellulosic ethanol from lignocellulosic materials without addition of external β-glucosidase by simultaneous saccharification and fermentation. A β-glucosidase BGL1 protein from this strain was recently reported supporting its cellobiose utilization capability. Here, we report two additional new β-glucosidase genes encoding enzymes designated as BGL2 and BGL3 from strain NRRL Y-50464. Quantitative gene expression was analyzed and the gene function of BGL2 and BGL3 was confirmed by heterologous expression using cellobiose as a sole carbon source. Each gene was cloned and partially purified protein obtained separately for direct enzyme assay using varied substrates. Both proteins showed the highest specific activity at pH 5 and relatively strong affinity with a Km of 0.08 and 0.18 mM for BGL2 and BGL3, respectively. The optimum temperature was found to be 50°C for BGL2 and 55°C for BGL3. Both proteins were able to hydrolyze 1,4 oligosaccharides evaluated in this study. They also showed a strong resistance to glucose product inhibition with a Ki of 61.97 and 38.33 mM for BGL2 and BGL3, respectively. While BGL3 was sensitive showing a significantly reduced activity to 4% ethanol, BGL2 demonstrated tolerance to ethanol. Its activity was enhanced in the presence of ethanol but reduced at concentrations greater than 16%. The presence of the fermentation inhibitors furfural and HMF did not affect the enzyme activity. Our results suggest that a β-glucosidase gene family exists in Clavispora NRRL Y-50464 with at least three members in this group that validate its cellobiose hydrolysis functions for lower-cost cellulosic ethanol production. Results of this study confirmed the cellobiose hydrolysis function of strain NRRL Y-50464, and further supported this dual functional yeast as a candidate for lower-cost cellulosic ethanol production and next-generation biocatalyst development in potential industrial applications."
https://openalex.org/W2316405543,"Background and Purpose The intraocular pressure (IOP)-lowering and side effects in response to different prostaglandin F2α analogues can be variable, but, the underlying basis for this difference remains unknown. This study investigated the differential changes of cellular proteins relevant to IOP-lowering effects of latanoprost and bimatoprost. Methods The human T lymphoblast (MOLT-3) cell line and immortalized human trabecular meshwork (iHTM) cells were studied by quantitative PCR and by immunofluorescence after treatment with either latanoprost or bimatoprost. New Zealand white rabbit eyes were treated topically with each agent and, following euthanasia, anterior segment tissues were studied with immunostaining. Results In cultured MOLT-3 cells, mRNA expression of both c-fos and matrix metalloproteinase 9 increased significantly in response to each agent. In addition, there was little change in tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-3 mRNA, but a significant decrease in TIMP-4. Fibronectin mRNA in MOLT-3 cells was down-regulated with bimatoprost, but was up-regulated with latanoprost. Immunofluorescence analysis of iHTM cells showed that intracellular fibronectin was significantly decreased by bimatoprost, but was increased by latanoprost. Both latanoprost and bimatoprost increased mRNA expression of NF-кB p65 and decreased that of IкBα. Aquaporin-1 mRNA expression was significantly down-regulated by bimatoprost. Immunostaining also revealed a significant decrease of aquaporin-1 in the ciliary epithelium of New Zealand white rabbits after bimatoprost treatment. Conclusions Similarities in protein expression produced by latanoprost and bimatoprost in vitro may be relevant to the mechanism for their IOP-lowering effects in vivo. Differences in fibronectin expression and in aquaporin-1 expression in response to each agent may contribute to variability in the IOP-lowering efficacy in some studies."
https://openalex.org/W2302884839,"Small Wind Turbines (SWTs) are a growing micro-generation industry with over 870,000 installed units worldwide. No research has focussed on public attitudes towards SWTs, despite evidence the perception of such attitudes are key to planning outcomes and can be a barrier to installations. Here we present the results of a UK wide mail survey investigating public attitudes towards SWTs. Just over half of our respondents, who were predominantly older, white males, felt that SWTs were acceptable across a range of settings, with those on road signs being most accepted and least accepted in hedgerows and gardens. Concern about climate change positively influenced how respondents felt about SWTs. Respondent comments highlight visual impacts and perceptions of the efficiency of this technology are particularly important to this sector of the UK public. Taking this into careful consideration, alongside avoiding locating SWTs in contentious settings such as hedgerows and gardens where possible, may help to minimise public opposition to proposed installations."
https://openalex.org/W2303475068,"The archaeon Halobacterium salinarum can produce energy using three different processes, namely photosynthesis, oxidative phosphorylation and fermentation of arginine, and is thus a model organism in bioenergetics. Compared to its bacteriorhodopsin-driven photosynthesis, less attention has been devoted to modeling its respiratory pathway. We created a system of ordinary differential equations that models its oxidative phosphorylation. The model consists of the electron transport chain, the ATP synthase, the potassium uniport and the sodium-proton antiport. By fitting the model parameters to experimental data, we show that the model can explain data on proton motive force generation, ATP production, and the charge balancing of ions between the sodium-proton antiporter and the potassium uniport. We performed sensitivity analysis of the model parameters to determine how the model will respond to perturbations in parameter values. The model and the parameters we derived provide a resource that can be used for analytical studies of the bioenergetics of H. salinarum."
https://openalex.org/W2310565721,"Thrombin is produced from the C-terminal half of prothrombin following its proteolytic activation. The N-terminal half, released as the propiece Fragment 12 (F12), is composed of an N-terminal γ-carboxyglutamate domain (Gla) followed by two kringles (K1 and K2). The propiece plays essential roles in regulating prothrombin activation and proteinase function. The latter results from the ability of F12 to reversibly bind to the (pro)catalytic domain through K2 with high affinity and highly favorable thermodynamic constants when it is a zymogen in comparison to proteinase. Such discrimination is lost for K2 binding after proteolytic removal of the N-terminal Gla-K1 region of F12. The Ca2+-stabilized structure of the Gla domain is not required for F12 to bind the zymogen form more favorably. Enhanced binding to zymogen versus proteinase correlates with the ability of the propiece to enforce zymogen-like character in the proteinase. This is evident in variants of meizothrombin, an intermediate of prothrombin activation that contains the propiece covalently attached. This phenomenon is also independent of the Gla domain. Thus, the presence of K1 in covalent linkage with K2 in the propiece governs the ability of K2 to bind the (pro)catalytic domain in favor of zymogen, thereby enforcing zymogen-like character in the proteinase.

The role played by ABE1 in ligating a range of thrombin substrates and ligands has been established by numerous biochemical and structural studies (6Lane D.A. Philippou H. Huntington J.A. Directing thrombin.Blood. 2005; 106: 2605-2612Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 7Bock P.E. Panizzi P. Verhamme I.M. Exosites in the substrate specificity of blood coagulation reactions.J. Thromb. Haemost. 2007; 5: 81-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In contrast, far fewer ligands have been identified for ABE2, found approximately on the opposite face of the proteinase domain from ABE1 (6Lane D.A. Philippou H. Huntington J.A. Directing thrombin.Blood. 2005; 106: 2605-2612Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Although ABE2 was originally defined on the basis of heparin binding, the propiece of the zymogen precursor that is cleaved away when thrombin is produced represents an important protein ligand for this site (9Arni R.K. Padmanabhan K. Padmanabhan K.P. Wu T.P. Tulinsky A.

Prothrombin, the zymogen precursor, requires cleavage at two sites to be converted to thrombin (Scheme 1). Cleavage at Arg271 releases the N-terminal propiece (F12), whereas cleavage at Arg320 is analogous to the cleavage at Arg15 in chymotrypsinogen and yields the proteinase. Thrombin is composed of the catalytic domain in disulfide linkage with a short light chain (Scheme 1). When Arg320 is not cleaved, the C-terminal procatalytic domain corresponds to the zymogen, prethrombin 2 (P2). The F12 propiece is composed of an N-terminal domain (Gla), bearing γ-carboxyglutamic acid residues, which is stabilized by Ca2+ and allows for membrane binding. Two kringle domains (K1 and K2) follow separated by a linker (Scheme 1). The presence of a thrombin-sensitive cleavage site at position 155, within the linker, facilitates the separation of F12 into the N-terminal fragment 1 (F1, Gla-K1) and fragment 2 (F2) bearing K2. A series of x-ray structures establish that it is F2 that contacts the ABE2 site within the (pro)catalytic domain, and the F1 region extends away as schematically illustrated (Scheme 1)(10Adams T.E.

Padmanabhan K. Padmanabhan K.P. Wu T.P. Tulinsky A.

Chem. 2008; 283: 30164-30173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). F12 binds the zymogen P2 with ∼30-fold higher affinity than it does to thrombin (13Kamath P. Krishnaswamy S. Fate of membrane-bound reactants and products during the activation of human prothrombin by prothrombinase.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 30164-30173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Binding of F12 imparts membrane binding function and accounts for the membrane-dependent cleavage of the F12-P2 complex to thrombin by prothrombinase, the membrane-bound enzyme complex responsible for prothrombin activation (13Kamath P. Krishnaswamy S. Fate of membrane-bound reactants and products during the activation of human prothrombin by prothrombinase.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 30164-30173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The ∼30-fold weaker interaction of F12 with thrombin releases the bulk of the proteinase product from the membrane surface freeing it to act on its multiple substrates in a membrane-independent manner (13Kamath P. Krishnaswamy S. Fate of membrane-bound reactants and products during the activation of human prothrombin by prothrombinase.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 30164-30173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The differential affinity of F12 for zymogen and proteinase is dwarfed by profound and compensating differences in enthalpy and entropy for the binding of the propiece to P2 and thrombin (14Kamath P. Huntington J.A. Krishnaswamy S. Ligand binding shuttles thrombin along a continuum of zymogen- and proteinase-like states.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 28651-28658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Thus, F12 binding to the zymogen is highly thermodynamically favored in comparison to the proteinase. This is evident from the finding that F12 binding to ABE2 enforces zymogen-like character in thrombin (14Kamath P. Huntington J.A. Krishnaswamy S. Ligand binding shuttles thrombin along a continuum of zymogen- and proteinase-like states.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 28651-28658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Despite irreversible cleavage at Arg320, thrombin can reversibly interconvert between zymogen-like and proteinase-like states depending on the complement of ligands bound to ABE2, the active site, and the Na+ binding site in the proteinase domain (14Kamath P. Huntington J.A. Krishnaswamy S. Ligand binding shuttles thrombin along a continuum of zymogen- and proteinase-like states.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 28651-28658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Although these ideas provide a unifying framework for the consideration of thrombin allostery, their physiologic relevance is questionable because of the modest affinity of F12 for the proteinase (13Kamath P. Krishnaswamy S. Fate of membrane-bound reactants and products during the activation of human prothrombin by prothrombinase.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 30164-30173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 14Kamath P. Huntington J.A. Krishnaswamy S.

Binding affinity is not at issue in the case of meizothrombin (mIIa) that is cleaved only at Arg320 and retains covalent linkage with F12 (Scheme 1). Accordingly, despite cleavage at the equivalent of Arg15 in chymotrypsinogen, mIIa displays prominent zymogen-like character (15Bradford H.N. Krishnaswamy S. Meizothrombin is an unexpectedly zymogen-like variant of thrombin.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 30414-30425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). It exists in approximately equally populated zymogen-like and proteinase-like forms that interconvert slowly (15Bradford H.N. Krishnaswamy S. Meizothrombin is an unexpectedly zymogen-like variant of thrombin.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 30414-30425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). This has major implications for the sequential cleavage of prothrombin activation by prothrombinase in which mIIa is produced as a major intermediate and for the understanding of the basis of its skewed spectrum of biological functions in comparison to thrombin (15Bradford H.N. Krishnaswamy S. Meizothrombin is an unexpectedly zymogen-like variant of thrombin.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 30414-30425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 16Krishnaswamy S. The transition of prothrombin to thrombin.J. Thromb. Haemost. 2013; 11: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, despite the fact that it is K2 in the propiece that contacts ABE2, F2 binding to the zymogen and proteinase are energetically equivalent and weak (13Kamath P. Krishnaswamy S. Fate of membrane-bound reactants and products during the activation of human prothrombin by prothrombinase.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 30164-30173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Thus, provided the thermodynamic arguments have merit, F2 will not be expected to elicit zymogen-like features in the proteinase. This discrepancy in the binding characteristics of F12 and F2 suggests that the N-terminal F1 domain somehow enforces the zymogen favoring ability of K2 and the following residues in their interaction with ABE2. The possibility that the F2 domain is fundamentally altered when F12 is cleaved at Arg155 is not obvious from available x-ray structures (10Adams T.E. Huntington J.A. Structural transitions during prothrombin activation: on the importance of fragment 2.Biochimie. 2016; 122: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). It is also inconsistent with evidence suggesting that F1 and F2 are independent folding domains within F12 or prothrombin (17Bloom J.W. Mann K.G. Prothrombin domains: circular dichroic evidence for a lack of cooperativity.Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 1957-1961Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). On the other hand, several lines of evidence suggest that the Ca2+-dependent folding of the Gla domain has distant effects on the proteinase domain (18Armstrong S.A. Husten E.J. Esmon C.T. Johnson A.E. The active site of membrane-bound meizothrombin. A fluorescence determination of its distance from the phospholipid surface and its conformational sensitivity to calcium and factor Va.J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 11374-11380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It, therefore, seems plausible that the folded structure of the Gla domain regulates the binding of F12 through the F2 region to the proteinase domain. The thermodynamic and kinetic approaches presented here shed unexpected light on the function of the F1 domain as zymogenizer within the propiece. Human plasma used for protein isolation was a gift of the Plasmapheresis Unit of the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. d-Phenylalanyl-l-proline-l-arginine chloromethyl ketone (FPRck, Calbiochem), dansylarginine-N-(3-ethyl-1,5-pentanediyl)-amide (DAPA, Hematologic Technologies), and Nα-dansyl-(p-guanidino)-phenylalanine-piperidide (I-2581,DiaPharma), tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone, and tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone (Sigma) were from the indicated suppliers. Concentrations of stock solutions prepared in water were determined using E330m = 4010 m−1·cm−1 (DAPA) and E342m = 4105 m−1·cm−1 (I-2581). Prothrombin was isolated from human plasma by established procedures (21Baugh R.J. Krishnaswamy S. Role of the activation peptide domain in human factor X activation by the extrinsic Xase complex.J.

Bovine chymotrypsin (Worthington) was treated with tosyl-lysine chloromethyl ketone dialyzed into 20 mm Hepes, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.4, and stored frozen in aliquots.

Recombinant prothrombin with alanine substituting the catalytic serine (IIA195, chymotrypsin numbering) or bearing glutamine substitutions for arginine as positions 155, 271, and 284 (IIQQQ, sequential numbering of the mature protein) were expressed as either fully carboxylated or uncarboxylated (dG) forms and purified as before (13Kamath P.

The stated degree of carboxylation was confirmed by amino acid analysis of γ-carboxyglutamate content after base hydrolysis and ion exchange HPLC with post-column derivatization (24Price P.A.

Preparative proteolysis of plasma prothrombin was used to generate F12, F2, and prethrombin 1 followed by their purification (25Mann K.G. Elion J. Butkowski R.J. Downing M. Nesheim M.E. Prothrombin.Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 286-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Uncarboxylated F12 (dG-F12), P2A195, and IIaA195 were generated from dG-IIA195 and purified as described (14Kamath P. Huntington J.A. Krishnaswamy S.

IIQQQ lacking the first 43 residues (IIQQQ-Δ43) was generated by preparative cleavage of fully carboxylated IIQQQ with chymotrypsin (26Pollock J.S. Shepard A.J. Weber D.J. Olson D.L. Klapper D.G.

The cleavage mixture (11 ml) contained 13.9 μm IIQQQ and 140 nm chymotrypsin in 20 mm Tris, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.4. After digestion for 1 h at 25 °C, chymotrypsin was inactivated by the addition of 20 μm tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone, diluted with 50 ml of 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and applied at 5 ml/min to a 10 × 100-mm column of Poros HQM (Thermo Fisher). After washing with the same buffer, bound protein was eluted with a gradient of increasing NaCl (0–600 mm NaCl in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 ml/min, 12 min). Fractions containing IIQQQ-Δ43 free of precursor and the cleaved peptide were pooled and precipitated with solid (NH4)2SO4 to 80% saturation. Precipitated protein was collected by centrifugation, dissolved in 50% (v/v) glycerol, and stored at −20 °C. The chemical identity of IIQQQ-Δ43 was established by N-terminal sequence analysis performed by Dr. Jan Pohl (Centers for Disease Control). While the bulk of the product was cleaved at Tyr43, a minor second sequence (∼10% yield) was observed consistent with some cleavage at Trp41. Protein concentrations were determined using the following molecular weights and extinction coefficients (E2800.1%): all full-length prothrombin variants, 72,000, 1.47 (25Mann K.G. Elion J.

Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was performed using an iTC200 (Microcal) at 25 °C. All protein species were treated with 10 μm p-amidinophenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma) before dialysis for 18 h versus 2 changes of 4 liters of buffer composed of 20 mm Hepes, 0.15 m NaCl containing either 5 mm Ca2+ or 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, at 4 °C. For two experiments, buffering in the second dialysis step was done with 20 mm Bistris propane instead of Hepes. After dialysis the samples were concentrated by centrifugal ultrafiltration if needed (Ultracel-10K, Amicon) and centrifuged to remove particulates before use. The cell (204 μl) contained either P2A195 or IIaA195 (14.6–30 μm), and the injection syringe (45 μl) contained F12 or F2 (224–431 μm). Heat flow was measured with continuous stirring, with injections of titrant at 180-s intervals. Typically, the first injection was 0.5 μl followed by 20 injections of 2 μl each. Heat flow due to ligand dilution and buffer mismatch was determined from an identical series of injections of titrant into dialysate. Samples were taken both before and after the experiment for analysis by SDS-PAGE to confirm that the heat flow measurements were not compromised by proteolytic degradation of the proteins. Stopped flow fluorescence measurements were performed at 25 °C using a SX20 stopped flow instrument with a 20-μl cell (Applied Photophysics). The binding of DAPA or I-2581 to mIIa variants was measured after rapid mixing of probe with proteinase using λEX = 280 nm and monitoring broadband fluorescence (λEX > 500 nm) using a long pass filter (LWP-500, Miles Girot) in the emission beam. As previously described, mIIa variants were prepared by cleaving the appropriate prothrombin variants with recombinant ecarin in situ and maintaining the cleaved product on ice for the ∼4-h experiment duration (15Bradford H.N. Krishnaswamy S. Meizothrombin is an unexpectedly zymogen-like variant of thrombin.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 30414-30425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). This approach minimizes possible perturbations in the zymogen/proteinase equilibrium that could result from the use of ion exchange to repurify the cleaved product (15Bradford H.N. Krishnaswamy S. Meizothrombin is an unexpectedly zymogen-like variant of thrombin.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 30414-30425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). IIA195 or IIQQQ were used to generate mIIaA195 or mIIaQQQ and dG-IIA195 or dG-IIQQQ to yield the corresponding uncarboxylated mIIa forms. Prethrombin 1 was cleaved by ecarin to yield mIIa-ΔF1, and IIQQQ-Δ43 was used to produce mIIaQQQ-Δ43. For cleavage, 5 μm concentrations of the zymogen variant in 20 mm Hepes, 0.15 m NaCl, 5 mm Ca2+, 0.1% (w/v) PEG-8000, 5 μm CoCl2, pH 7.4, was treated with 100 nm ecarin for 10 min at 25 °C and transferred to ice. For experiments done in EDTA, the cleavage mixture lacked Ca2+, and the reaction mixture was supplemented with 5 mm EDTA after cleavage was complete. SDS-PAGE analysis confirmed quantitative conversion to the appropriate mIIa species, and stability over the experimental period was established by gel analysis after the ∼4-h experiment duration. Stopped flow measurements were conducted by rapid mixing of equal volumes of enzyme solution (0.6 μm mIIa variant) with 10 different concentrations of either DAPA or I-2581 (1–16 μm) in the same buffer. Traces were acquired over 2 time scales, typically 2000 points in 0.2 s followed by 1000 points in 6.0 s, to permit description of the rapid and slow phases of the transient. Probe dissociation was measured by trapping free proteinase using FPRck (15Bradford H.N. Krishnaswamy S. Meizothrombin is an unexpectedly zymogen-like variant of thrombin.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 30414-30425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). For these studies, 0.6 μm mIIa variant was premixed with 4 μm probe and reacted with equal volumes of 400 or 800 μm FPRck in the same buffer. Traces describing the decrease in fluorescence associated with probe dissociation were collected using 10,000 data points over ∼10 t½ of the transient. Despite the fact that mIIaA195 cannot covalently react with FPRck, the inhibitor evidently binds with sufficient affinity to trap free enzyme. Successful isolation of the intrinsic dissociation rate constant for the probe was inferred from the independence of the time constant for fluorescence decay on the concentration of FPRck. Heat traces from ITC measurements were initially analyzed by singular value decomposition using the program NITPICK to normalize for baseline variation and noise and yield integrated areas for each injection (28Keller S.

https://openalex.org/W2311948652,"Use of estrogen or estrogen/progestin combination was an approved regimen for menopausal hormonal therapy (MHT). However, more recent patient-centered studies revealed an increase in the incidence of breast cancer in women receiving menopausal hormone therapy with estrogen plus progestin rather than estrogen alone. Tissue selective estrogen complex (TSEC) has been proposed to eliminate the progesterone component of MHT with supporting evidences. Based on our previous studies it is evident that SPRMs have a safer profile on endometrium in preventing unopposed estrogenicity. We hypothesized that a combination of estradiol (E2) with selective progesterone receptor modulator (SPRM) to exert a safer profile on endometrium will also reduce mammary gland proliferation and could be used to prevent breast cancer when used in MHT. In order to test our hypothesis, we compared the estradiol alone or in combination with our novel SPRMs, EC312 and EC313. The compounds were effectively controlled E2 mediated cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in T47D breast cancer cells. The observed effects were found comparable that of BZD in vitro. The effects of SPRMs were confirmed by receptor binding studies as well as gene and protein expression studies. Proliferation markers were found downregulated with EC312/313 treatment in vitro and reduced E2 induced mammary gland proliferation, evidenced as reduced ductal branching and terminal end bud growth in vivo. These data supporting our hypothesis that E2+EC312/EC313 blocked the estrogen action may provide basic rationale to further test the clinical efficacy of SPRMs to prevent breast cancer incidence in postmenopausal women undergoing MHT."
https://openalex.org/W2309040424,"DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification critical for normal development and diseases. The determination of genome-wide DNA methylation at single-nucleotide resolution is made possible by sequencing bisulfite treated DNA with next generation high-throughput sequencing. However, aligning bisulfite short reads to a reference genome remains challenging as only a limited proportion of them (around 50-70%) can be aligned uniquely; a significant proportion, known as multireads, are mapped to multiple locations and thus discarded from downstream analyses, causing financial waste and biased methylation inference. To address this issue, we develop a Bayesian model that assigns multireads to their most likely locations based on the posterior probability derived from information hidden in uniquely aligned reads. Analyses of both simulated data and real hairpin bisulfite sequencing data show that our method can effectively assign approximately 70% of the multireads to their best locations with up to 90% accuracy, leading to a significant increase in the overall mapping efficiency. Moreover, the assignment model shows robust performance with low coverage depth, making it particularly attractive considering the prohibitive cost of bisulfite sequencing. Additionally, results show that longer reads help improve the performance of the assignment model. The assignment model is also robust to varying degrees of methylation and varying sequencing error rates.
