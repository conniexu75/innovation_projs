https://openalex.org/W3159728495,"Abstract High-quality and complete reference genome assemblies are fundamental for the application of genomics to biology, disease, and biodiversity conservation. However, such assemblies are available for only a few non-microbial species 1–4 . To address this issue, the international Genome 10K (G10K) consortium 5,6 has worked over a five-year period to evaluate and develop cost-effective methods for assembling highly accurate and nearly complete reference genomes. Here we present lessons learned from generating assemblies for 16 species that represent six major vertebrate lineages. We confirm that long-read sequencing technologies are essential for maximizing genome quality, and that unresolved complex repeats and haplotype heterozygosity are major sources of assembly error when not handled correctly. Our assemblies correct substantial errors, add missing sequence in some of the best historical reference genomes, and reveal biological discoveries. These include the identification of many false gene duplications, increases in gene sizes, chromosome rearrangements that are specific to lineages, a repeated independent chromosome breakpoint in bat genomes, and a canonical GC-rich pattern in protein-coding genes and their regulatory regions. Adopting these lessons, we have embarked on the Vertebrate Genomes Project (VGP), an international effort to generate high-quality, complete reference genomes for all of the roughly 70,000 extant vertebrate species and to help to enable a new era of discovery across the life sciences."
https://openalex.org/W3158099307,"Glaciers distinct from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets are shrinking rapidly, altering regional hydrology1, raising global sea level2 and elevating natural hazards3. Yet, owing to the scarcity of constrained mass loss observations, glacier evolution during the satellite era is known only partially, as a geographic and temporal patchwork4,5. Here we reveal the accelerated, albeit contrasting, patterns of glacier mass loss during the early twenty-first century. Using largely untapped satellite archives, we chart surface elevation changes at a high spatiotemporal resolution over all of Earth's glaciers. We extensively validate our estimates against independent, high-precision measurements and present a globally complete and consistent estimate of glacier mass change. We show that during 2000-2019, glaciers lost a mass of 267 ± 16 gigatonnes per year, equivalent to 21 ± 3 per cent of the observed sea-level rise6. We identify a mass loss acceleration of 48 ± 16 gigatonnes per year per decade, explaining 6 to 19 per cent of the observed acceleration of sea-level rise. Particularly, thinning rates of glaciers outside ice sheet peripheries doubled over the past two decades. Glaciers currently lose more mass, and at similar or larger acceleration rates, than the Greenland or Antarctic ice sheets taken separately7-9. By uncovering the patterns of mass change in many regions, we find contrasting glacier fluctuations that agree with the decadal variability in precipitation and temperature. These include a North Atlantic anomaly of decelerated mass loss, a strongly accelerated loss from northwestern American glaciers, and the apparent end of the Karakoram anomaly of mass gain10. We anticipate our highly resolved estimates to advance the understanding of drivers that govern the distribution of glacier change, and to extend our capabilities of predicting these changes at all scales. Predictions robustly benchmarked against observations are critically needed to design adaptive policies for the local- and regional-scale management of water resources and cryospheric risks, as well as for the global-scale mitigation of sea-level rise."

https://openalex.org/W3158308213,"Somatic mutations drive the development of cancer and may contribute to ageing and other diseases1,2. Despite their importance, the difficulty of detecting mutations that are only present in single cells or small clones has limited our knowledge of somatic mutagenesis to a minority of tissues. Here, to overcome these limitations, we developed nanorate sequencing (NanoSeq), a duplex sequencing protocol with error rates of less than five errors per billion base pairs in single DNA molecules from cell populations. This rate is two orders of magnitude lower than typical somatic mutation loads, enabling the study of somatic mutations in any tissue independently of clonality. We used this single-molecule sensitivity to study somatic mutations in non-dividing cells across several tissues, comparing stem cells to differentiated cells and studying mutagenesis in the absence of cell division. Differentiated cells in blood and colon displayed remarkably similar mutation loads and signatures to their corresponding stem cells, despite mature blood cells having undergone considerably more divisions. We then characterized the mutational landscape of post-mitotic neurons and polyclonal smooth muscle, confirming that neurons accumulate somatic mutations at a constant rate throughout life without cell division, with similar rates to mitotically active tissues. Together, our results suggest that mutational processes that are independent of cell division are important contributors to somatic mutagenesis. We anticipate that the ability to reliably detect mutations in single DNA molecules could transform our understanding of somatic mutagenesis and enable non-invasive studies on large-scale cohorts. NanoSeq is used to detect mutations in single DNA molecules and analyses show that mutational processes that are independent of cell division are important contributors to somatic mutagenesis."
https://openalex.org/W3159116119,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent cause of dementia1. Although there is no effective treatment for AD, passive immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies against amyloid beta (Aβ) is a promising therapeutic strategy2,3. Meningeal lymphatic drainage has an important role in the accumulation of Aβ in the brain4, but it is not known whether modulation of meningeal lymphatic function can influence the outcome of immunotherapy in AD. Here we show that ablation of meningeal lymphatic vessels in 5xFAD mice (a mouse model of amyloid deposition that expresses five mutations found in familial AD) worsened the outcome of mice treated with anti-Aβ passive immunotherapy by exacerbating the deposition of Aβ, microgliosis, neurovascular dysfunction, and behavioural deficits. By contrast, therapeutic delivery of vascular endothelial growth factor C improved clearance of Aβ by monoclonal antibodies. Notably, there was a substantial overlap between the gene signature of microglia from 5xFAD mice with impaired meningeal lymphatic function and the transcriptional profile of activated microglia from the brains of individuals with AD. Overall, our data demonstrate that impaired meningeal lymphatic drainage exacerbates the microglial inflammatory response in AD and that enhancement of meningeal lymphatic function combined with immunotherapies could lead to better clinical outcomes."

https://openalex.org/W3157334032,"Sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) exclusively affects elderly people. Using direct conversion of AD patient fibroblasts into induced neurons (iNs), we generated an age-equivalent neuronal model. AD patient-derived iNs exhibit strong neuronal transcriptome signatures characterized by downregulation of mature neuronal properties and upregulation of immature and progenitor-like signaling pathways. Mapping iNs to longitudinal neuronal differentiation trajectory data demonstrated that AD iNs reflect a hypo-mature neuronal identity characterized by markers of stress, cell cycle, and de-differentiation. Epigenetic landscape profiling revealed an underlying aberrant neuronal state that shares similarities with malignant transformation and age-dependent epigenetic erosion. To probe for the involvement of aging, we generated rejuvenated iPSC-derived neurons that showed no significant disease-related transcriptome signatures, a feature that is consistent with epigenetic clock and brain ontogenesis mapping, which indicate that fibroblast-derived iNs more closely reflect old adult brain stages. Our findings identify AD-related neuronal changes as age-dependent cellular programs that impair neuronal identity."
https://openalex.org/W3159826075,"Vascular malformations are thought to be monogenic disorders that result in dysregulated growth of blood vessels. In the brain, cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs) arise owing to inactivation of the endothelial CCM protein complex, which is required to dampen the activity of the kinase MEKK31–4. Environmental factors can explain differences in the natural history of CCMs between individuals5, but why single CCMs often exhibit sudden, rapid growth, culminating in strokes or seizures, is unknown. Here we show that growth of CCMs requires increased signalling through the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)–mTOR pathway as well as loss of function of the CCM complex. We identify somatic gain-of-function mutations in PIK3CA and loss-of-function mutations in the CCM complex in the same cells in a majority of human CCMs. Using mouse models, we show that growth of CCMs requires both PI3K gain of function and CCM loss of function in endothelial cells, and that both CCM loss of function and increased expression of the transcription factor KLF4 (a downstream effector of MEKK3) augment mTOR signalling in endothelial cells. Consistent with these findings, the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin effectively blocks the formation of CCMs in mouse models. We establish a three-hit mechanism analogous to cancer, in which aggressive vascular malformations arise through the loss of vascular ‘suppressor genes’ that constrain vessel growth and gain of a vascular ‘oncogene’ that stimulates excess vessel growth. These findings suggest that aggressive CCMs could be treated using clinically approved mTORC1 inhibitors. Aggressive cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs) are found to grow through a three-hit cancer-like mechanism, involving gain of function of a gene that promotes vascular growth, and loss of function of genes that suppress it."

https://openalex.org/W3158717271,"Abstract Oxytocin (OXT; hereafter OT) and arginine vasopressin or vasotocin (AVP or VT; hereafter VT) are neurotransmitter ligands that function through specific receptors to control diverse functions 1,2 . Here we performed genomic analyses on 35 species that span all major vertebrate lineages, including newly generated high-contiguity assemblies from the Vertebrate Genomes Project 3,4 . Our findings support the claim 5 that OT (also known as OXT ) and VT (also known as AVP ) are adjacent paralogous genes that have resulted from a local duplication, which we infer was through DNA transposable elements near the origin of vertebrates and in which VT retained more of the parental sequence. We identified six major oxytocin–vasotocin receptors among vertebrates. We propose that all six of these receptors arose from a single receptor that was shared with the common ancestor of invertebrates, through a combination of whole-genome and large segmental duplications. We propose a universal nomenclature based on evolutionary relationships for the genes that encode these receptors, in which the genes are given the same orthologous names across vertebrates and paralogous names relative to each other. This nomenclature avoids confusion due to differential naming in the pre-genomic era and incomplete genome assemblies, furthers our understanding of the evolution of these genes, aids in the translation of findings across species and serves as a model for other gene families."
https://openalex.org/W3159182318,"Quasi-Periodic Eruptions (QPEs) are extreme high-amplitude bursts of X-ray radiation recurring every few hours and originating near the central supermassive black holes in galactic nuclei. It is currently unknown what triggers these events, how long they last and how they are connected to the physical properties of the inner accretion flows. Previously, only two such sources were known, found either serendipitously or in archival data, with emission lines in their optical spectra classifying their nuclei as hosting an actively accreting supermassive black hole. Here we present the detection of QPEs in two further galaxies, obtained with a blind and systematic search over half of the X-ray sky. The optical spectra of these galaxies show no signature of black hole activity, indicating that a pre-existing accretion flow typical of active nuclei is not required to trigger these events. Indeed, the periods, amplitudes and profiles of the newly discovered QPEs are inconsistent with current models that invoke radiation-pressure driven accretion disk instabilities. Instead, QPEs might be driven by an orbiting compact object. Furthermore, their observed properties require the mass of the secondary object to be much smaller than the main body and future X-ray observations may constrain possible changes in the period due to orbital evolution. This scenario could make QPEs a viable candidate for the electromagnetic counterparts of the so-called extreme mass ratio inspirals, with considerable implications for multi-messenger astrophysics and cosmology."

https://openalex.org/W3157743200,"G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) have central roles in intercellular communication1,2. Structural studies have revealed how GPCRs can activate G proteins. However, whether this mechanism is conserved among all classes of GPCR remains unknown. Here we report the structure of the class-C heterodimeric GABAB receptor, which is activated by the inhibitory transmitter GABA, in its active form complexed with Gi1 protein. We found that a single G protein interacts with the GB2 subunit of the GABAB receptor at a site that mainly involves intracellular loop 2 on the side of the transmembrane domain. This is in contrast to the G protein binding in a central cavity, as has been observed with other classes of GPCR. This binding mode results from the active form of the transmembrane domain of this GABAB receptor being different from that of other GPCRs, as it shows no outside movement of transmembrane helix 6. Our work also provides details of the inter- and intra-subunit changes that link agonist binding to G-protein activation in this heterodimeric complex."
https://openalex.org/W3157122502,"Abstract The accurate and complete assembly of both haplotype sequences of a diploid organism is essential to understanding the role of variation in genome functions, phenotypes and diseases 1 . Here, using a trio-binning approach, we present a high-quality, diploid reference genome, with both haplotypes assembled independently at the chromosome level, for the common marmoset ( Callithrix jacchus ), an primate model system that is widely used in biomedical research 2,3 . The full spectrum of heterozygosity between the two haplotypes involves 1.36% of the genome—much higher than the 0.13% indicated by the standard estimation based on single-nucleotide heterozygosity alone. The de novo mutation rate is 0.43 × 10 −8 per site per generation, and the paternal inherited genome acquired twice as many mutations as the maternal. Our diploid assembly enabled us to discover a recent expansion of the sex-differentiation region and unique evolutionary changes in the marmoset Y chromosome. In addition, we identified many genes with signatures of positive selection that might have contributed to the evolution of Callithrix biological features. Brain-related genes were highly conserved between marmosets and humans, although several genes experienced lineage-specific copy number variations or diversifying selection, with implications for the use of marmosets as a model system."
https://openalex.org/W3158595574,"Several enteric pathogens can gain specific metabolic advantages over other members of the microbiota by inducing host pathology and inflammation. The pathogen Clostridium difficile is responsible for a toxin-mediated colitis that causes 450,000 infections and 15,000 deaths in the United States each year1; however, the molecular mechanisms by which C. difficile benefits from this pathology remain unclear. To understand how the metabolism of C. difficile adapts to the inflammatory conditions that its toxins induce, here we use RNA sequencing to define, in a mouse model, the metabolic states of wild-type C. difficile and of an isogenic mutant that lacks toxins. By combining bacterial and mouse genetics, we demonstrate that C. difficile uses sorbitol derived from both diet and host. Host-derived sorbitol is produced by the enzyme aldose reductase, which is expressed by diverse immune cells and is upregulated during inflammation-including during toxin-mediated disease induced by C. difficile. This work highlights a mechanism by which C. difficile can use a host-derived nutrient that is generated during toxin-induced disease by an enzyme that has not previously been associated with infection."
https://openalex.org/W3157934132,"The state of deprotonation/protonation of surfaces has far-ranging implications in chemistry, from acid-base catalysis1 and the electrocatalytic and photocatalytic splitting of water2, to the behaviour of minerals3 and biochemistry4. An entity's acidity is described by its proton affinity and its acid dissociation constant pKa (the negative logarithm of the equilibrium constant of the proton transfer reaction in solution). The acidity of individual sites is difficult to assess for solids, compared with molecules. For mineral surfaces, the acidity is estimated by semi-empirical concepts, such as bond-order valence sums5, and increasingly modelled with first-principles molecular dynamics simulations6,7. At present, such predictions cannot be tested-experimental measures, such as the point of zero charge8, integrate over the whole surface or, in some cases, individual crystal facets9. Here we assess the acidity of individual hydroxyl groups on In2O3(111)-a model oxide with four different types of surface oxygen atom. We probe the strength of their hydrogen bonds with the tip of a non-contact atomic force microscope and find quantitative agreement with density functional theory calculations. By relating the results to known proton affinities of gas-phase molecules, we determine the proton affinity of the different surface sites of In2O3 with atomic precision. Measurements on hydroxylated titanium dioxide and zirconium oxide extend our method to other oxides."
https://openalex.org/W3158419451,"While most researchers interested in the concept of dynamic capabilities focus their attention on analyzing how companies transform their resources to compete in their environment, the process of developing dynamic capabilities is treated as a marginal issue. Although the literature suggests various approaches to developing dynamic capabilities, they are formulated in general terms, and doubts can be raised about the links between actions. There is also a lack of empirical research indicating the links between activities in the process of developing dynamic capabilities and their influence on the effectiveness of an organization. The aim of the study is to formulate a proposal for a model of the process of developing dynamic capabilities aimed at increasing the economic effectiveness of a company and to determine the links between the activities in the model. The theoretical contribution of the paper consists in presenting a model of the process of developing dynamic capabilities aimed at increasing the economic effectiveness of the company. The results presented in the paper refer to an empirical examination of the model of developing dynamic capabilities, covering five activities: searching for opportunities; knowledge management and learning; coordination; configuration and reconfiguration; and organizational adaptation. The study also includes an examination of the possible impact the components of the dynamic capabilities building process have on a company’s performance. The study uses the survey method and data was obtained from top managers. The conclusion, based on data from 471 Polish companies, was made using structural equation modelling. The results of the empirical research suggest that the individual activities in the process of developing dynamic capabilities are interconnected, and through mutual interactions and couplings, they positively affect the economic effectiveness of an enterprise. The results indicate that searching for opportunities is the precursor, and the main factor influencing the other activities in the process, which suggests that managers should focus on improving activities in this area."
https://openalex.org/W3159779107,"This paper investigates economic impacts of COVID-19 on households based on differences in the socio-economic status (SES). We determine the household-level effects of the COVID-19 shock using income sources, types of industries, communities’ resilience, household susceptibility, and relevant policy measures. For this purpose, we used primary data of 555 households collected through snowball sampling technique using an online survey questionnaire from different villages mostly located in Sichuan Province, China. Using step-wise binary logistic regression analysis, we estimated and validated the model. Results suggest the use of SES as a better measure for understanding the impacts of COVID-19 on different households. We find that households with low SES tend to depend more on farmland income and transfer payments from the government. Contrarily, high SES households focus more on business and local employment as sources of income generation. Poor households were less resilient and more likely to fall back into poverty due to COVID-19, while the opposite stands true for non-poor households with high SES. Based on the estimations, policies encouraging employment and businesses complemented with loans on lower interest rates are recommended, which may increase the SES, thus minimizing vulnerability and enhancing the households’ resilience towards poverty alleviation and economic shocks."
https://openalex.org/W3159946220,"Molecular quantum gases (that is, ultracold and dense molecular gases) have many potential applications, including quantum control of chemical reactions, precision measurements, quantum simulation and quantum information processing1-3. For molecules, to reach the quantum regime usually requires efficient cooling at high densities, which is frequently hindered by fast inelastic collisions that heat and deplete the population of molecules4,5. Here we report the preparation of two-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) of spinning molecules by inducing pairing interactions in an atomic condensate near a g-wave Feshbach resonance6. The trap geometry and the low temperature of the molecules help to reduce inelastic loss, ensuring thermal equilibrium. From the equation-of-state measurement, we determine the molecular scattering length to be + 220(±30) Bohr radii (95% confidence interval). We also investigate the unpairing dynamics in the strong coupling regime and find that near the Feshbach resonance the dynamical timescale is consistent with the unitarity limit. Our work demonstrates the long-sought transition between atomic and molecular condensates, the bosonic analogue of the crossover from a BEC to a Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) superfluid in a Fermi gas7-9. In addition, our experiment may shed light on condensed pairs with orbital angular momentum, where a novel anisotropic superfluid with non-zero surface current is predicted10,11, such as the A phase of 3He."
https://openalex.org/W3140404421,"Heat stress is a major abiotic stress factor reducing crop productivity and climate change models predict increasing temperatures in many production regions. Common bean ( Phaseolus vulgaris L .) is an important crop for food security in the tropics and heat stress is expected to cause increasing yield losses. To study physiological responses and to characterize the genetics of heat stress tolerance, we evaluated the recombinant inbred line (RIL) population IJR (Indeterminate Jamaica Red) x AFR298 of the Andean gene pool. Heat stress (HS) conditions in the field affected many traits across the reproductive phase. High nighttime temperatures appeared to have larger effects than maximum daytime temperatures. Yield was reduced compared to non-stress conditions by 37% and 26% in 2016 and 2017 seasons, respectively. The image analysis tool HYRBEAN was developed to evaluate pollen viability (PolVia). A significant reduction of PolVia was observed in HS and higher viability was correlated with yield only under stress conditions. In susceptible lines the reproductive phase was extended and defects in the initiation of seed, seed fill and seed formation were identified reducing grain quality. Higher yields under HS were correlated with early flowering, high pollen viability and effective seed filling. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis revealed a QTL for both pod harvest index and PolVia on chromosome Pv05, for which the more heat tolerant parent IJR contributed the positive allele. Also, on chromosome Pv08 a QTL from IJR improved PolVia and the yield component pods per plant. HS affected several traits during the whole reproductive development, from floral induction to grain quality traits, indicating a general heat perception affecting many reproductive processes. Identification of tolerant germplasm, indicator traits for heat tolerance and molecular tools will help to breed heat tolerant varieties to face future climate change effects."
https://openalex.org/W3158504899,"Purpose Pseudoexfoliation (PXF) is a unique form of glaucoma characterized by accumulation of exfoliative material in the eyes. Changes in tear profile in disease stages may give us insights into molecular mechanisms involved in causing glaucoma in the eye. Methods All patients were categorized into three main categories; pseudoexfoliation (PXF), pseudoexfoliation glaucoma (PXG) and cataract, which served as control. Cytokines, transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1), matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) and fibronectin (FN1) were assessed with multiplex bead assay, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), gelatin zymography, and immunohistochemistry (IHC) respectively in different ocular tissues such as tears, tenon’s capsule, aqueous humor (AH) and serum samples of patients with PXF stages. Results We found that TGFβ1, MMP-9 and FN1 protein expression were upregulated in tears, tenon’s capsule and AH samples in PXG compared to PXF, though the MMP-9 protein activity was downregulated in PXG compared with control or PXF. We have also found that in PXG tears sample the fold change of TGF-α (Transforming Growth Factor-α), MDC (Macrophage Derived Chemokine), IL-8 (Interleukin-8), VEGF (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor) were significantly downregulated and the levels of GM-CSF (Granulocyte Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor), IP-10 (Interferon- γ produced protein-10) were significant upregulated. While in AH; IL-6 (Interleukin-6), IL-8, VEGF, IFN-a2 (Interferon- α2), GRO (Growth regulated alpha protein) levels were found lower and IL1a (Interleukin-1α) level was higher in PXG compared to PXF. And in serum; IFN-a2, Eotaxin, GM-CSF, Fractalkine, IL-10 (Interleukin-10), IL1Ra (Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist), IL-7 (Interleukin-7), IL-8, MIP1β (Macrophage Inflammatory Protein-1β), MCP-1 (Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1) levels were significantly upregulated and PDGF-AA (Platelet Derived Growth Factor-AA) level was downregulated in the patients with PXG compared to PXF. Conclusions Altered expression of these molecules in tears may therefore be used as a signal for onset of glaucoma or for identifying eyes at risk of developing glaucoma in PXF."
https://openalex.org/W3159837519,"Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) conversion prediction from the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage has been a difficult challenge. This study focuses on providing an individualized MCI to AD conversion prediction using a balanced random forest model that leverages clinical data. In order to do this, 383 Early Mild Cognitive Impairment (EMCI) patients were gathered from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Of these patients, 49 would eventually convert to AD (EMCI_C), whereas the remaining 334 did not convert (EMCI_NC). All of these patients were split randomly into training and testing data sets with 95 patients reserved for testing. Nine clinical features were selected, comprised of a mix of demographic, brain volume, and cognitive testing variables. Oversampling was then performed in order to balance the initially imbalanced classes prior to training the model with 1000 estimators. Our results showed that a random forest model was effective (93.6% accuracy) at predicting the conversion of EMCI patients to AD based on these clinical features. Additionally, we focus on explainability by assessing the importance of each clinical feature. Our model could impact the clinical environment as a tool to predict the conversion to AD from a prodromal stage or to identify ideal candidates for clinical trials."
https://openalex.org/W3158480927,"Myocardial infarction (MI) activates the epicardium to form epicardial stromal cells (EpiSC) that reside in the epicardial hypoxic microenvironment. Paracrine factors secreted by EpiSC were shown to modulate the injury response of the post-MI heart and improve cardiac function. We have previously reported that the expression of the angiogenic cytokines vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) and IL-6 is strongly upregulated in EpiSC by adenosine acting via the A2B receptor (A2BR). Since tissue hypoxia is well known to be a potent stimulus for the generation of extracellular adenosine, the present study explored the crosstalk of A2BR activation and hypoxia-hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1α) signaling in cultured EpiSC, isolated from rat hearts 5 days after MI. We found substantial nuclear accumulation of HIF-1α after A2BR activation even in the absence of hypoxia. This normoxic HIF-1α induction was PKC-dependent and involved upregulation of HIF-1α mRNA expression. While the influence of hypoxia on adenosine generation and A2BR signaling was only minor, hypoxia and A2BR activation cumulatively increased VEGFA expression. Normoxic A2BR activation triggered an HIF-1α-associated cell-protective metabolic switch and reduced oxygen consumption. HIF-1α targets and negative regulators PHD2 and PHD3 were only weakly induced by A2BR signaling, which may result in a sustained HIF-1α activity. The A2BR-mediated normoxic HIF-1α induction was also observed in cardiac fibroblasts from healthy mouse hearts, suggesting that this mechanism is also functional in other A2BR-expressing cell types. Altogether, we identified A2BR-mediated HIF-1α induction as novel aspect in the HIF-1α-adenosine crosstalk, which modulates EpiSC activity and can amplify HIF-1α-mediated cardioprotection."
https://openalex.org/W3158462577,"Global warming is predicted to have major effects on the annual time windows during which species may successfully reproduce. At the organismal level, climatic shifts engage with the control mechanism for reproductive seasonality. In mammals, laboratory studies on neuroendocrine mechanism emphasize photoperiod as a predictive cue, but this is based on a restricted group of species. In contrast, field-oriented comparative analyses demonstrate that proximate bioenergetic effects on the reproductive axis are a major determinant of seasonal reproductive timing. The interaction between proximate energetic and predictive photoperiodic cues is neglected. Here, we focused on photoperiodic modulation of postnatal reproductive development in common voles (Microtus arvalis), a herbivorous species in which a plastic timing of breeding is well documented. We demonstrate that temperature-dependent modulation of photoperiodic responses manifest in the thyrotrophin-sensitive tanycytes of the mediobasal hypothalamus. Here, the photoperiod-dependent expression of type 2 deiodinase expression, associated with the summer phenotype was enhanced by 21°C, whereas the photoperiod-dependent expression of type 3 deiodinase expression, associated with the winter phenotype, was enhanced by 10°C in spring voles. Increased levels of testosterone were found at 21°C, whereas somatic and gonadal growth were oppositely affected by temperature. The magnitude of these temperature effects was similar in voles photoperiodical programmed for accelerated maturation (ie, born early in the breeding season) and in voles photoperiodical programmed for delayed maturation (ie, born late in the breeding season). The melatonin-sensitive pars tuberalis was relatively insensitive to temperature. These data define a mechanistic hierarchy for the integration of predictive temporal cues and proximate thermo-energetic effects in mammalian reproduction."
https://openalex.org/W3158981435,"There are not many sites in densely populated temperate Europe where primary forest succession has a chance to run without direct human intervention for a long time and over a relatively large area. The extensive drift sand area of the Veluwe, central Netherlands, provided an opportunity to study succession in a formerly open and dynamic inland sand dune system combining chronosequence and permanent plot approaches. Different successional stages, aged up to 205 years since the first tree individuals established, were identified and vegetation studied using 1200 permanent plots established in 1988 in three adjacent sand dune complexes of different successional age, and resampled during the past three decades. After two centuries, forest succession has proceeded to a pine forest with gradually increasing participation of native deciduous trees. However, their expansion has been arrested by browsing of wild ungulates. Species diversity peaked after about 40 years of forest succession, then declined, and increased again after 100 years. During the past three decades, the herb layer has differentiated in the oldest plots, and the spontaneous forest succession is still in progress. Besides open drift sand with early successional stages, also the spontaneously established late successional forests are valuable from the conservation point of view."
https://openalex.org/W3159623064,"Trade credit is a payment extension granted by a selling firm to its customer. Companies typically respond to late payments from their customers by delaying payments to suppliers, thus generating a ripple through the transaction network. Therefore, trade credit is as a potential vehicle of propagation of losses in case of default events. The goal of this work is to leverage information on the trade credit among connected firms to predict imminent defaults of firms. We use a unique dataset of client firms of a major Italian bank to investigate firm bankruptcy between October 2016 to March 2018. We develop a model to capture network spillover effects originating from the supply chain on the probability of default of each firm via a sequential approach: the output of a first model component on single firm features is used in a subsequent model which captures network spillovers. While the first component is the standard econometrics way to predict such dynamics, the network module represents an innovative way to look into the effect of trade credit on default probability. This module looks at the transaction network of the firm, as inferred from the payments transiting via the bank, in order to identify the trade partners of the firm. By using several features extracted from the network of transactions, this model is able to predict a large fraction of the defaults, thus showing the value hidden in the network information. Finally, we merge firm and network features with a machine learning model to create a ‘hybrid’ model, which improves the recall for the task by almost 20 percentage points over the baseline."
https://openalex.org/W3158929276,"Cell death-inducing DFFA-like effector C (CIDEC) is responsible for metabolic disturbance and insulin resistance, which are considered to be important triggers in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM). To investigate whether CIDEC plays a critical role in DCM, DCM rat model was induced by a high-fat diet and a single injection of low-dose streptozotocin (27.5 mg/kg). DCM rats showed severe metabolic disturbance, insulin resistance, myocardial hypertrophy, interstitial fibrosis, ectopic lipid deposition, inflammation and cardiac dysfunction, accompanied by CIDEC elevation. With CIDEC gene silencing, the above pathophysiological characteristics were significantly ameliorated accompanied by significant improvements in cardiac function in DCM rats. Enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) α activation was involved in the underlying pathophysiological molecular mechanisms. To further explore the underlying mechanisms that CIDEC facilitated collagen syntheses in vitro, insulin-resistant cardiac fibroblast (CF) model was induced by high glucose (15.5 mmol/L) and high insulin (104 μU/mL). We observed that insulin-resistant stimulation dramatically raised CIDEC expression and promoted CIDEC nuclear translocation in CFs. Meanwhile, AMPKα2 was observed to distribute almost completely inside CF nucleus. The results further proved that CIDEC biochemically interacted and co-localized with AMPKα2 rather than AMPKα1 in CF nucleus, which provided a novel mechanism of CIDEC in promoting collagen syntheses. This study suggested that CIDEC gene silencing alleviates DCM via AMPKα signaling both in vivo and in vitro, implicating CIDEC may be a promising target for treatment of human DCM."

Methods In this prospective cohort study, a total of 901 consenting participants were enrolled from November 2016 to February 2017 and a structured questionnaire administered to them through the open data kit application on android tablets. Twenty-two months later, we revisited the MAT clinics and reviewed 823 of the 901 enrolled participant’s medical records in search for documentation on TB disease diagnosis and treatment. Medical records reviewed included those of participants whom at enrolment were asymptomatic, not on TB disease treatment, not on TB preventive therapy and those who had a documented tuberculin skin test (TST) result. Results Of the 823 medical records reviewed 22 months after enrolment, 42 had documentation of being diagnosed with TB disease and initiated on TB treatment. This is equivalent to a TB disease incidence rate of 2,925.2 patients per 100,000 person years with a total follow up time of 1,440 person-years. At enrolment the prevalence of TB disease and TB infection was 2.6% and 54% respectively and the HIV prevalence was 44% and 16% among females and males respectively. Conclusion PWUD attending MAT clinics bear an extremely high burden of TB and HIV and are known to have driven TB epidemics in a number of countries. Our reported TB disease incidence is 12 times that of the general Tanzanian incidence of 237 per 100,000 further emphasizing that this group should be prioritized for TB screening, testing and treatment. Gender specific approaches should also be developed as female PWUDs are markedly more affected with HIV and TB disease than male PWUDs."
https://openalex.org/W3159795537,"Aggressive behavior in school is an ongoing concern. The current focus is on specific manifestations such as bullying, but the behavior is broad and heterogenous. Children spend a substantial amount of time in school, but their behaviors in the school setting tend to be less well characterized than at home. Because aggression may index multiple behavioral problems, we used three validated instruments to assess means, correlations and gender differences of teacher-rated aggressive behavior with co-occurring externalizing/internalizing problems and social behavior in 39,936 schoolchildren aged 7-14 from 4 population-based cohorts from Finland, the Netherlands, and the UK. Correlations of aggressive behavior were high with all other externalizing problems (r: 0.47-0.80) and lower with internalizing problems (r: 0.02-0.39). A negative association was observed with prosocial behavior (r: -0.33 to -0.54). Mean levels of aggressive behavior differed significantly by gender. Despite the higher mean levels of aggressive behavior in boys, the correlations were notably similar for boys and girls (e.g., aggressive-hyperactivity correlations: 0.51-0.75 boys, 0.47-0.70 girls) and did not vary greatly with respect to age, instrument or cohort. Thus, teacher-rated aggressive behavior rarely occurs in isolation; boys and girls with problems of aggressive behavior likely require help with other behavioral and emotional problems. Important to note, higher aggressive behavior is not only associated with higher amounts of other externalizing and internalizing problems but also with lower levels of prosocial behavior."

We therefore examined circulating monocyte dynamics immediately after reperfusion of the culprit coronary vessel in STEMI patients to determine whether this correlated with level of cardiac injury. A mouse model of cardiac ischemia/reperfusion injury was subsequently used to establish the degree of monocyte margination to the coronary vasculature that could potentially contribute to the drop in circulating monocytes. We retrospectively analyzed blood samples from 51 STEMI patients to assess the number of non-classical (NC), classical, and intermediate monocytes immediately following primary percutaneous coronary intervention. Classical and intermediate monocytes showed minimal change. On the other hand, circulating numbers of NC monocytes fell by approximately 50% at 90 minutes post-reperfusion. This rapid decrease in NC monocytes was greatest in patients with the largest infarct size (P < .05) and correlated inversely with left ventricular function (r = 0.41, P = .04). The early fall in NC monocytes post-reperfusion was confirmed in a second prospective study of 13 STEMI patients. Furthermore, in a mouse cardiac ischemia model, there was significant monocyte adhesion to coronary vessel endothelium at 2 hours post-reperfusion pointing to a specific and rapid vessel margination response to cardiac injury. In conclusion, rapid depletion of NC monocytes from the circulation in STEMI patients following coronary artery reperfusion correlates with the level of acute cardiac injury and involves rapid margination to the coronary vasculature."
https://openalex.org/W3157162362,"The serine-threonine protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a heterotrimeric enzyme complex that regulates many fundamental cellular processes. PP2A is involved in tumorigenesis because mutations in the scaffold subunit, PPP2R1B, were found in several types of cancers. However, the biological function of PPP2R1B remains largely unknown. We report here that homozygous deletion of Ppp2r1b in Mus musculus impairs meiotic recombination and causes meiotic arrest in spermatocytes. Consistently, male mice lacking Ppp2r1b are characterized with infertility. Furthermore, heterozygous missense mutations in the Homo sapiens PPP2R1B gene, which encodes PPP2R1B, are identified in azoospermia patients with meiotic arrest. We found that PPP2R1B mutants are susceptible to degradation by an E3 ligase CRL4ADCAF6, and resistant to de-polyubiquitylation by ubiquitin-specific protease 5 (USP5). In addition, heterozygous mutations in PPP2R1B reduce stability of the wild-type PPP2R1B. Our results demonstrate an essential role of PPP2R1B in spermatogenesis and identify upstream regulators of PPP2R1B."

Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying synthesis of milk components provides practical benefits to improve the milk quality via systematic breeding program in mammals. Through RNAi with EEF1D in primary bovine mammary epithelial cells, we phenotypically observed aberrant formation of cytoplasmic lipid droplets and significantly decreased milk triglyceride level by 37.7%, and exploited the mechanisms by which EEF1D regulated milk lipid synthesis via insulin (PI3K-Akt), AMPK, and PPAR pathways. In the EEF1D CRISPR/Cas9 knockout mice, incompletely developed mammary glands at 9th day postpartum with small or unformed lumens, and significantly decreased triglyceride concentration in milk by 23.4% were observed, as well as the same gene expression alterations in the three pathways. For dairy cattle, we identified a critical regulatory mutation modifying EEF1D transcription activity, which interpreted 7% of the genetic variances of milk lipid yield and percentage. Our findings highlight the significance of EEF1D in mammary gland development and milk lipid synthesis in mammals."

Bufalin is an extract of traditional Chinese medicine, which has been proved to have anticancer effect. The target of bufalin in suppressing gastric cancer peritoneal dissemination (GCPD) and the underlying mechanism are still unclear. In this research, GC cell line MGC-803 and high-potential peritoneal dissemination cell line MKN-45P were treated with bufalin or L-NAME. Malignant biological behavior and protein level of GC cell lines were detected with MTT, wound healing, transwell, adhesion, and western blotting. Bioinformatics analysis and patient tissues were used to verify the role of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS3) in GC. Mice model was used to assess the effect of bufalin and role of NOS3 in vivo. We found that bufalin inhibited the proliferation, invasion, and migration in GC cell lines. NOS3, which was an independent prognostic factor of GC patients, was predicted to be a potential target of bufalin. Further experiments proved that bufalin reduced the phosphorylation of NOS3, thereby inhibiting the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, and ultimately suppressed GCPD by inhibiting EMT process. In conclusion, NOS3 was a potential therapeutic target and prognostic biomarker of GC. Bufalin could suppress GCPD through NOS3-MAPK signaling pathway, which provided more evidence support for intraperitoneal perfusion of bufalin to treat GCPD."
https://openalex.org/W3158506021,"We report comprehensive evidence for obligatory thelytokous parthenogenesis in an ant Monomorium triviale . This species is characterized by distinct queen–worker dimorphism with strict reproductive division of labor: queens produce both workers and new queens without mating, whereas workers are completely sterile. We collected 333 nests of this species from 14 localities and three laboratory-reared populations in Japan. All wild queens dissected had no sperm in their spermathecae. Laboratory observation confirmed that virgin queens produced workers without mating. Furthermore, microsatellite genotyping showed identical heterozygous genotypes between mothers and their respective daughters, suggesting an extremely low probability of sexual reproduction. Microbial analysis detected no bacterial genera that are known to induce thelytokous parthenogenesis in Hymenoptera. Finally, the lack of variation in partial sequences of mitochondrial DNA among individuals sampled from across Japan suggests recent rapid spread or selective sweep. M . triviale would be a promising model system of superorganism-like adaptation through comparative analysis with well-studied sexual congeners, including the pharaoh ant M . pharaonis ."
https://openalex.org/W3159168959,"Obesity is a risk factor for postmenopausal breast cancer. Obesity-related inflammation upregulates aromatase expression, the rate-limiting enzyme for estrogen synthesis, in breast adipose tissue (BAT), increasing estrogen production and cancer risk. The regulation of aromatase gene (CYP19A1) in BAT is complex, and the mechanisms linking obesity and aromatase dysregulation are not fully understood. An obesity-associated factor that could regulate aromatase is the CC chemokine ligand (CCL) 2, a pro-inflammatory factor that also activates signaling pathways implicated in CYP19A1 transcription. By using human primary breast adipose stromal cells (ASCs) and aromatase reporter (hARO-Luc) mouse mammary adipose explants, we demonstrated that CCL2 enhances the glucocorticoid-mediated CYP19A1 transcription. The potential mechanism involves the activation of PI.4 via ERK1/2 pathway. We also showed that CCL2 contributes to the pro-inflammatory milieu and aromatase expression in obesity, evidenced by increased expression of CCL2 and CYP19A1 in mammary tissues from obese hARO-Luc mice, and subcutaneous adipose tissue from obese women. In summary, our results indicate that postmenopausal obesity may promote CCL2 production in BAT, leading to exacerbation of the menopause-related inflammatory state and further stimulation of local aromatase and estrogens. These results provide new insights into the regulation of aromatase and may aid in finding approaches to prevent breast cancer."

This study, thus, sought to measure the breeding efficiency of herders before and after the implementation of GECP. Moreover, the study also thought to analyze the effect and the effecting path of the implementation of GECP on the efficiency of herders’ livestock breeding. GECP enables herders to obtain financial subsidies while minimizing the utilization of grassland, which brings challenges and opportunities to herders’ traditional livestock production. This study used the two-stage data obtained from a randomly selected sample of 449 herders in the Inner Mongolia grassland area of China in 2018. Data envelopment analysis (DEA) and parallel mediating effect (PME) models were used to analyze the data. The results show that the general effect of GECP on the breeding efficiency of herders in the Inner Mongolia is positive (P &lt; 0.01), and the change of breeding methods (direct effect) is the main influence path. Specifically, the grassland circulation behavior (P &lt; 0.01) and the scale of breeding (P &lt; 0.01) are part of the mediating effect. While the mediating effect of the breeding structure is not significant (P &gt; 0.1). This study also shows that the non-agricultural and animal husbandry income of herders has a negative impact on the breeding efficiency (P &lt; 0.01), and herders’ age and breeding scale have a positive effect on the breeding efficiency (P&lt;0.01). This study has not only answered the question whether the GECP can improve the efficiency of husbandry, but also focused on the analysis of the impacting mechanism of policies on efficiency. It is of great significance to further improve GECP and the related supporting policies and promote the transformation of China’s grassland animal husbandry."

It has been observed that sinus bradycardia, rare but in certain situations life threatening adverse drug reaction, can be induced by SGAs across different schizophrenia populations. However, the roles of genetic factors in this phenomenon have not been studied yet. In the present study, a genome-wide association study of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was performed on Chinese Han SCZ patients to identify susceptibility loci that were associated with sinus bradycardia induced by SGAs. This study applied microarray to obtain genotype profiles of 88 Han Chinese SCZ patients. Our results found that there were no SNPs had genome-wide significant association with sinus bradycardia induced by SGAs. The top GWAS hit located in gene KIAA0247 , which mainly regulated by the tumor suppressor P53 and thus plays a role in carcinogenesis based on resent research and it should not be a susceptibility locus to sinus bradycardia induced by SGAs. Using gene-set functional analysis, we tested that if top 500 SNPs mapped genes were relevant to sinus bradycardia. The result of gene prioritization analysis showed CTNNA3 was strongly correlated with sinus bradycardia, hinting it was a susceptibility gene of this ADR. Our study provides a preliminary study of genetic variants associated with sinus bradycardia induced by SGAs in Han Chinese SCZ patients. The discovery of a possible susceptibility gene shed light on further study of this adverse drug reaction in Han Chinese SCZ patients."

An evolutionarily conserved post-translational mechanism for over-expression of BCL2 in human B cell lymphomas and the BCL2 paralogue CED-9 in Caenorhabditis elegans results from loss-of-function mutations in human FBXO10 and its C . elegans paralogue DRE-1, a BCL2/CED-9-binding subunit of the SKP-CULLIN-FBOX (SCF) ubiquitin ligase. Here, we tested the role of FBXO10 in BCL2 regulation by producing mice with two different CRISPR/ Cas9 -engineered Fbxo10 mutations: an Asp54Lys (E54K) missense mutation in the FBOX domain and a Cys55SerfsTer55 frameshift (fs) truncating mutation. Mice homozygous for either mutant allele were born at the expected Mendelian frequency and appeared normal in body weight and appearance as adults. Spleen B cells from homozygous mutant mice did not have increased BCL2 protein, nor were the numbers of mature B cells or germinal centre B cells increased as would be expected if BCL2 was increased. Other lymphocyte subsets that are also regulated by BCL2 levels also displayed no difference in frequency in homozygous Fbxo10 mutant mice. These results support one of two conclusions: either FBXO10 does not regulate BCL2 in mice, or it does so redundantly with other ubiquitin ligase complexes. Possible candidates for the latter include FBXO11 or ARTS-XIAP. The difference between the role of FBXO10 in regulating BCL2 protein levels in C . elegans and in human DLBCL, relative to single-gene deficient mouse leukocytes, should be further investigated."
https://openalex.org/W3157891748,"Artificial forms of mechanical limb stimulation are used within multiple fields of study to determine the level of cortical excitability and to map the trajectory of neuronal recovery from cortical damage or disease. Square-wave mechanical or electrical stimuli are often used in these studies, but a characterization of sensory-evoked response properties to square-waves with distinct fundamental frequencies but overlapping harmonics has not been performed. To distinguish between somatic stimuli, the primary somatosensory cortex must be able to represent distinct stimuli with unique patterns of activity, even if they have overlapping features. Thus, mechanical square-wave stimulation was used in conjunction with regional and cellular imaging to examine regional and cellular response properties evoked by different frequencies of stimulation. Flavoprotein autofluorescence imaging was used to map the somatosensory cortex of anaesthetized C57BL/6 mice, and in vivo two-photon Ca 2+ imaging was used to define patterns of neuronal activation during mechanical square-wave stimulation of the contralateral forelimb or hindlimb at various frequencies (3, 10, 100, 200, and 300 Hz). The data revealed that neurons within the limb associated somatosensory cortex responding to various frequencies of square-wave stimuli exhibit stimulus-specific patterns of activity. Subsets of neurons were found to have sensory-evoked activity that is either primarily responsive to single stimulus frequencies or broadly responsive to multiple frequencies of limb stimulation. High frequency stimuli were shown to elicit more population activity, with a greater percentage of the population responding and greater percentage of cells with high amplitude responses. Stimulus-evoked cell-cell correlations within these neuronal networks varied as a function of frequency of stimulation, such that each stimulus elicited a distinct pattern that was more consistent across multiple trials of the same stimulus compared to trials at different frequencies of stimulation. The variation in cortical response to different square-wave stimuli can thus be represented by the population pattern of supra-threshold Ca 2+ transients, the magnitude and temporal properties of the evoked activity, and the structure of the stimulus-evoked correlation between neurons."

Globally, 820,000 children and 20,000 women lost due to in appropriate breastfeeding each year. In Ethiopia, 50,000 children lost related to malnutrition with 18% were due to poor breastfeeding habit. Little is known on the determinants of breastfeeding with hierarchical level. Therefore, this study aimed to identify factors influencing optimal breastfeeding among children under six month in Ethiopia using a multilevel analysis. Methods The data of this study were obtained from Ethiopian Demographic and health survey conducted from January to June 2016. A total 1,087 children aged 0–5 months were selected using two stage stratified sampling technique. Multilevel logistic regression analysis was done to identify significant explanatory variables. Akaike information criteria were used to select the best model fit. Fixed effect was done to estimate the association between the outcome and explanatory variable and also random effect to measure the variation explained by the higher level. Result Among the total of 1,087 children, 45.4% were optimally breastfeed. Children from the richest wealth index (AOR = 2.87; 95% CI: 1.53–5.43) was positively associated with optimal breastfeeding but, children aged 4–5 months (AOR = 0.19; 95%CI: 0.12–0.27), children born through cesarean section (AOR = 0.18; 955 CI: 0.07–0.51) and residing in Afar region (AOR = 0.13; 95%CI: 0.02–0.92) were found inversely associated with optimal breastfeeding. The random-effects showed that the variation between communities was statistically significant. Conclusion Individual and community level factors play a significant role in shaping optimal breastfeeding. Future strategies and health interventions should be strengthen to target individual and community level factors that enhance optimal breastfeeding."

However, O -linked glycans was detected on the P . pastoris -derived rBer e 1, which is not naturally present in nBer e 1, and may contribute to the allergic sensitisation. In this study, we addressed the glycosylation differences between P . pastoris -derived recombinant Ber e 1 and its native counterparts. We also determined whether this fungal glycosylation could affect the antigenicity and immunogenicity of the rBer e 1 by using dendritic cells (DC) as an immune cell model due to their role in modulating the immune response. We identified that the glycosylation occurs at Ser96, Ser101 and Ser110 on the large chain and Ser19 on the small polypeptide chain of rBer e 1 only. The glycosylation on rBer e 1 was shown to elicit varying degree of antigenicity by binding to different combination of human leukocyte antigens (HLA) at different frequencies compared to nBer e 1 when tested using human DC-T cell assay. However, both forms of Ber e 1 are weak immunogens based from their low response indexes (RI). Glycans present on rBer e 1 were shown to increase the efficiency of the protein recognition and internalization by murine bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (bmDC) via C-type lectin receptors, particularly the mannose receptor (MR), compared to the non-glycosylated nBer e 1 and SFA8, a weak allergenic 2S albumin protein from sunflower seed. Binding of glycosylated rBer e 1 to MR alone was found to not induce the production of IL-10 that modulates bmDC to polarise Th2 cell response by suppressing IL-12 production and DC maturation. Our findings suggest that the O -linked glycosylation by P . pastoris has a small but measurable effect on the in vitro antigenicity of the rBer e 1 compared to its non-glycosylated counterpart, nBer e 1, and thus may influence its applications in diagnostics and immunotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W3157364090,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic lung disease of unknown etiology with minimal treatment options. Repetitive alveolar epithelial injury has been suggested as one of the causative mechanisms of this disease. Type 2 alveolar epithelial cells (AEC2) play a crucial role during fibrosis by functioning as stem cells able to repair epithelial damage. The DNA demethylase Tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2 (TET2) regulates the stemness of multiple types of stem cells, but whether it also affects the stemness of AEC2 during fibrosis remains elusive. To study the role of TET2 in AEC2 during fibrosis, we first determined TET2 protein levels in the lungs of IPF patients and compared TET2 expression in AEC2 of IPF patients and controls using publicly available data sets. Subsequently, pulmonary fibrosis was induced by the intranasal administration of bleomycin to wild-type and AEC2-specific TET2 knockout mice to determine the role of TET2 in vivo. Fibrosis was assessed by hydroxyproline analysis and fibrotic gene expression. Additionally, macrophage recruitment and activation, and epithelial injury were analyzed. TET2 protein levels and gene expression were downregulated in IPF lungs and AEC2, respectively. Bleomycin inoculation induced a robust fibrotic response as indicated by increased hydroxyproline levels and increased expression of pro-fibrotic genes. Additionally, increased macrophage recruitment and both M1 and M2 activation were observed. None of these parameters were, however, affected by AEC2-specific TET2 deficiency. TET2 expression is reduced in IPF, but the absence of TET2 in AEC2 cells does not affect the development of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W3157651644,"India has experienced a significant increase in facility-based delivery (FBD) coverage and reduction in maternal mortality. Nevertheless, India continues to have high levels of maternal health inequity. Improving equity requires data collection methods that can produce a better contextual understanding of how vulnerable populations access and interact with the health care system at a local level. While large population-level surveys are valuable, they are resource intensive and often lack the contextual specificity and timeliness to be useful for local health programming. Qualitative methods can be resource intensive and may lack generalizability. We describe an innovative mixed-methods application of Large Country-Lot Quality Assurance Sampling (LC-LQAS) that provides local coverage data and qualitative insights for both FBD and antenatal care (ANC) in a low-cost and timely manner that is useful for health care providers working in specific contexts. LC-LQAS is a version of LQAS that combines LQAS for local level classification with multistage cluster sampling to obtain precise regional or national coverage estimates. We integrated qualitative questions to uncover mothers’ experiences accessing maternal health care in the rural district of Sri Ganganagar, Rajasthan, India. We interviewed 313 recently delivered, low-income women in 18 subdistricts. All respondents participated in both qualitative and quantitative components. All subdistricts were classified as having high FBD coverage with the upper threshold set at 85%, suggesting that improved coverage has extended to vulnerable women. However, only two subdistricts were classified as high ANC coverage with the upper threshold set at 40%. Qualitative data revealed a severe lack of agency among respondents and that household norms of care seeking influenced uptake of ANC and FBD. We additionally report on implementation outcomes (acceptability, feasibility, appropriateness, effectiveness, fidelity, and cost) and how study results informed the programs of a local health non-profit."

Methods and results 40 patients (mean age 9,68 years, 75% male) after BAV and 62 control subjects matched to the age and heart rate were prospectively evaluated. The 2D STE assessment of LV longitudinal and circumferential strain and strain rate was performed. Left ventricular eccentric hypertrophy (LVEH) was diagnosed in 75% of patients in the study group. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was normal in all patients. In study group, global longitudinal strain (GLS), global longitudinal strain rate (GLSr) were significantly lower compared with the controls: GLS (-19.7±2.22% vs. -22.3±1.5%, P &lt; 0.001), GLSr (-0.89±0.15/s vs. -1.04 ±0.12/s, P &lt; 0.001). Regional (basal, middle and apical segments) strain and strain rate were also lower compared with control group. Global circumferential strain (GCS), global circumferential strain rate (GCSr) as well as regional (basal, middle and apical segments) strain and strain rate were normal. Multivariable logistic regression analysis included: instantaneous peak systolic Doppler gradient across aortic valve (PG max ), grade of aortic regurgitation (AR), left ventricular mass index (LVMI), left ventricular relative wall thickness (LVRWT), left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDd), peak systolic mitral annular velocity of the septal and lateral corner (S’spt, S’lat), LVEF before BAV and time after BAV and showed that the only predictor of reduced GLS was LV eccentric hypertrophy [odds ratio 6.9; (95% CI: 1.37–12.5), P = 0.045]. Conclusion Patients at long-term observation after BAV present the subclinical LV systolic impairment, which is associated with the presence of its remodeling. Longitudinal deformation is the most sensitive marker of LV systolic impairment in this group of patients."
https://openalex.org/W3158410617,"Although current antiretroviral therapies (ART) are successful in controlling HIV-1 infection, a stable viral reservoir reactivates when ART is discontinued. Consequently, there is a major research effort to develop approaches to disrupt the latent viral reservoir and enhance the immune system's ability to clear HIV-1. A number of small molecules, termed latency reversal agents (LRAs), have been identified which can reactivate latent HIV-1 in cell lines and patients' cells ex vivo. However, clinical trials have suggested that combinations of LRAs will be required to efficiently reactivate HIV-1 in vivo, especially LRAs that act synergistically by functioning through distinct pathways. To identify novel LRAs, we used an image-based assay to screen a natural compound library for the ability to induce a low level of aggregation of resting primary CD4+ T cells from healthy donors. We identified celastrol as a novel LRA. Celastrol functions synergistically with other classes of LRA to reactivate latent HIV-1 in a Jurkat cell line, suggesting a novel mechanism in its LRA activity. Additionally, celastrol does not appear to activate resting CD4+ T cells at levels at which it can reactivate latent HIV-1. Celastrol appears to represent a novel class of LRAs and it therefore can serve as a lead compound for LRA development."

My people use the oil extracted from larvae of the snout beetle Rhynchophorus palmarum (Linnaeus, 1758) to treat and heal skin wounds and respiratory diseases. Based on this ethnopharmacological knowledge, the chemical composition and antioxidant, antimicrobial, and healing properties of R . palmarum larvae oil (RPLO) were investigated, as well as possible toxic effects, through in vitro and in vivo assays. The chemical composition of the RPLO was determined using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. The antioxidant activity of RPLO was investigated through the direct 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging assay, and the antimicrobial activity was evaluated against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria that are pathogenic to humans. The healing properties of RPLO were investigated by performing a cell migration assay using human lung fibroblasts (MRC-5), and the toxicity was analyzed, in vivo , using a Caenorhabditis elegans model and MRC-5 cells, in vitro . RPLO contains 52.2% saturated fatty acids and 47.4% unsaturated fatty acids, with palmitic acid (42.7%) and oleic acid (40%) representing its major components, respectively. RPLO possesses direct antioxidant activity, with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) of 46.15 mg.ml -1 . The antimicrobial activity of RPLO was not observed at a concentration of 1% (v/v). RPLO did not alter the viability of MRC-5 cells and did not exert toxic effects on C . elegans . Furthermore, MRC-5 cells incubated with 0.5% RPLO showed a higher rate of cell migration than that of the control group, supporting its healing properties. Taken together, RPLO possesses direct antioxidant activity and the potential to aid in the healing process and is not toxic toward in vitro and in vivo models, corroborating the safe use of the oil in traditional Guarani-Kaiowá medicine."
https://openalex.org/W3158845100,"Rationale/Study design A major challenge in the development of HIV vaccines is finding immunogens that elicit protection against a broad range of viral strains. Immunity to a narrow range of viral strains may protect infants of HIV-infected women or partners discordant for HIV. We hypothesized that immunization to the relevant viral variants could be achieved by exposure to infectious virus during prophylaxis with antiretroviral drugs. To explore this approach in an animal model, macaques were exposed to live virus (SIV mne or HIV-2 287 ) during prophylaxis with parenteral tenofovir and humoral and cellular immune responses were quantified. Subsequently, experimental animals were challenged with homologous virus to evaluate protection from infection, and if infection occurred, the course of disease was compared to control animals. Experimental animals uninfected with SIV mne were challenged with heterologous HIV-2 287 to assess resistance to retroviral infection. Methodology/Principal findings Juvenile female Macaca nemestrina (N = 8) were given ten weekly intravaginal exposures with either moderately (SIV mne ) or highly (HIV-2 287 ) pathogenic virus during tenofovir prophylaxis. Tenofovir protected all 8 experimental animals from infection, while all untreated control animals became infected. Specific non-neutralizing antibodies were elicited in blood and vaginal secretions of experimental animals, but no ELISPOT responses were detected. Six weeks following the cessation of tenofovir, intravaginal challenge with homologous virus infected 2/4 (50%) of the SIV mne -immunized animals and 4/4 (100%) of the HIV-2 287 -immunized animals. The two SIV mne -infected and 3 (75%) HIV-2 287 -infected had attenuated disease, suggesting partial protection. Conclusions/Significance Repeated exposure to SIV mne or HIV-2 287 , during antiretroviral prophylaxis that blocked infection, induced binding antibodies in the blood and mucosa, but not neutralizing antibodies or specific cellular immune responses. Studies to determine whether antibodies are similarly induced in breastfeeding infants and sexual partners discordant for HIV infection and receiving pre-exposure antiretroviral prophylaxis are warranted, including whether these antibodies appear to confer partial or complete protection from infection."
