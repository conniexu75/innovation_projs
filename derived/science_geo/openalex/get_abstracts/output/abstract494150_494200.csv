https://openalex.org/W2061659241,"Quantitative views of cellular functions require precise measures of rates of biomolecule production, especially proteins-the direct effectors of biological processes. Here, we present a genome-wide approach, based on ribosome profiling, for measuring absolute protein synthesis rates. The resultant E. coli data set transforms our understanding of the extent to which protein synthesis is precisely controlled to optimize function and efficiency. Members of multiprotein complexes are made in precise proportion to their stoichiometry, whereas components of functional modules are produced differentially according to their hierarchical role. Estimates of absolute protein abundance also reveal principles for optimizing design. These include how the level of different types of transcription factors is optimized for rapid response and how a metabolic pathway (methionine biosynthesis) balances production cost with activity requirements. Our studies reveal how general principles, important both for understanding natural systems and for synthesizing new ones, emerge from quantitative analyses of protein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1993287310,"Tissue regeneration is an orchestrated progression of cells from an immature state to a mature one, conventionally represented as distinctive cell subsets. A continuum of transitional cell states exists between these discrete stages. We combine the depth of single-cell mass cytometry and an algorithm developed to leverage this continuum by aligning single cells of a given lineage onto a unified trajectory that accurately predicts the developmental path de novo. Applied to human B cell lymphopoiesis, the algorithm (termed Wanderlust) constructed trajectories spanning from hematopoietic stem cells through to naive B cells. This trajectory revealed nascent fractions of B cell progenitors and aligned them with developmentally cued regulatory signaling including IL-7/STAT5 and cellular events such as immunoglobulin rearrangement, highlighting checkpoints across which regulatory signals are rewired paralleling changes in cellular state. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of human B lymphopoiesis, laying a foundation to apply this approach to other tissues and ""corrupted"" developmental processes including cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2035847235,"The mammalian heart has a remarkable regenerative capacity for a short period of time after birth, after which the majority of cardiomyocytes permanently exit cell cycle. We sought to determine the primary postnatal event that results in cardiomyocyte cell-cycle arrest. We hypothesized that transition to the oxygen-rich postnatal environment is the upstream signal that results in cell-cycle arrest of cardiomyocytes. Here, we show that reactive oxygen species (ROS), oxidative DNA damage, and DNA damage response (DDR) markers significantly increase in the heart during the first postnatal week. Intriguingly, postnatal hypoxemia, ROS scavenging, or inhibition of DDR all prolong the postnatal proliferative window of cardiomyocytes, whereas hyperoxemia and ROS generators shorten it. These findings uncover a protective mechanism that mediates cardiomyocyte cell-cycle arrest in exchange for utilization of oxygen-dependent aerobic metabolism. Reduction of mitochondrial-dependent oxidative stress should be an important component of cardiomyocyte proliferation-based therapeutic approaches."
https://openalex.org/W2159620582,"All bacteria form persisters, cells that are multidrug tolerant and therefore able to survive antibiotic treatment. Due to the low frequencies of persisters in growing bacterial cultures and the complex underlying molecular mechanisms, the phenomenon has been challenging to study. However, recent technological advances in microfluidics and reporter genes have improved this scenario. Here, we summarize recent progress in the field, revealing the ubiquitous bacterial stress alarmone ppGpp as an emerging central regulator of multidrug tolerance and persistence, both in stochastically and environmentally induced persistence. In several different organisms, toxin-antitoxin modules function as effectors of ppGpp-induced persistence."
https://openalex.org/W2084179820,"Brain function is mediated by neural circuit connectivity, and elucidating the role of connections is aided by techniques to block their output. We developed cell-type-selective, reversible synaptic inhibition tools for mammalian neural circuits by leveraging G protein signaling pathways to suppress synaptic vesicle release. Here, we find that the pharmacologically selective designer Gi-protein-coupled receptor hM4D is a presynaptic silencer in the presence of its cognate ligand clozapine-N-oxide (CNO). Activation of hM4D signaling sharply reduced synaptic release probability and synaptic current amplitude. To demonstrate the utility of this tool for neural circuit perturbations, we developed an axon-selective hM4D-neurexin variant and used spatially targeted intracranial CNO injections to localize circuit connections from the hypothalamus to the midbrain responsible for feeding behavior. This synaptic silencing approach is broadly applicable for cell-type-specific and axon projection-selective functional analysis of diverse neural circuits."
https://openalex.org/W1963745085,"Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) sustain blood formation throughout life and are the functional units of bone marrow transplantation. We show that transient expression of six transcription factors Run1t1, Hlf, Lmo2, Prdm5, Pbx1, and Zfp37 imparts multilineage transplantation potential onto otherwise committed lymphoid and myeloid progenitors and myeloid effector cells. Inclusion of Mycn and Meis1 and use of polycistronic viruses increase reprogramming efficacy. The reprogrammed cells, designated induced-HSCs (iHSCs), possess clonal multilineage differentiation potential, reconstitute stem/progenitor compartments, and are serially transplantable. Single-cell analysis revealed that iHSCs derived under optimal conditions exhibit a gene expression profile that is highly similar to endogenous HSCs. These findings demonstrate that expression of a set of defined factors is sufficient to activate the gene networks governing HSC functional identity in committed blood cells. Our results raise the prospect that blood cell reprogramming may be a strategy for derivation of transplantable stem cells for clinical application."

We measured neuronal activity in the entorhinal-hippocampal circuit while mice performed a reward-based spatial working memory task. During the memory retention period, a transient burst of high gamma synchronization preceded an animal’s correct choice in both prospective planning and retrospective mistake correction, but not an animal’s incorrect choice. Optogenetic inhibition of the circuit targeted to the choice point area resulted in a coordinated reduction in both high gamma synchrony and correct execution of a working-memory-guided behavior. These findings suggest that transient high gamma synchrony contributes to the successful execution of spatial working memory.

Furthermore, our data are consistent with an association between transient high gamma synchrony and explicit awareness of the working memory content. Network oscillations are proposed to underlie the temporal binding of spatially distributed neuronal populations to enable information processing for cognition and its ensuing behavior (Singer, 1993Singer W. Synchronization of cortical activity and its putative role in information processing and learning.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1993; 55: 349-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (1302) Google Scholar). In addition, certain oscillations are hypothesized to allow conscious perception and awareness of associations between external cues and internal goals encoded in the synchronized brain areas (Singer, 1993Singer W.

Measuring contingent action selection and neural activity simultaneously in an animal model that allows for neural intervention would enable the relationship between a neural activity, such as gamma oscillations, and a discrete cognitive event to be assessed more precisely. When rodents engage in a spatial working memory task, two major oscillations of local field potentials (LFP) emerge in both the entorhinal cortex (EC) and hippocampus (HPC) (Bragin et al., 1995Bragin A. Jandó G. Nádasdy Z. Hetke J. Wise K. Buzsáki G. Gamma (40-100 Hz) oscillation in the hippocampus of the behaving rat.J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 47-60PubMed Google Scholar). Theta and gamma oscillations represent continuous and transient oscillatory phenomena (Belluscio et al., 2012Belluscio M.A. Mizuseki K. Schmidt R. Kempter R. Buzsáki G.

Neurosci. 2010; 30: 11128-11142Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), respectively. Gamma oscillation frequencies are broad but can be classified as low gamma oscillations (25–50 Hz) and high gamma oscillations (65–140 Hz) (Belluscio et al., 2012Belluscio M.A. Mizuseki K. Schmidt R. Kempter R. Buzsáki G. Cross-frequency phase-phase coupling between θ and γ oscillations in the hippocampus.J.

Frequency of gamma oscillations routes flow of information in the hippocampus.Nature. 2009; 462: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar). Low gamma oscillations typically overlap with the descending phase of the theta oscillation and are hypothesized to be the consequence of CA3 inputs to CA1 (Belluscio et al., 2012Belluscio M.A. Mizuseki K. Schmidt R. Kempter R. Buzsáki G. Cross-frequency phase-phase coupling between θ and γ oscillations in the hippocampus.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 423-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Low gamma oscillations coexist with hippocampal replay events, suggesting that they may coordinate memory reactivation across the hippocampal network during some sharp-wave ripple (SWR) events (Carr et al., 2012Carr M.F. Karlsson M.P. Frank L.M. Transient slow gamma synchrony underlies hippocampal memory replay.Neuron. 2012; 75: 700-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). High gamma oscillations are typically phase locked to the trough of the theta oscillation, but their role in the EC-HPC network and in memory, or indeed in any brain circuit or cognitive process, is unknown. We investigated the relationship between synchronized high-frequency gamma oscillations and access to spatial working memory using a delayed nonmatching-to-place (DNMP) T maze task. Our results reveal a tight association of transient cortico-hippocampal high gamma synchrony with the successful use of working memory. To block synaptic transmission from the medial EC layer III (MECIII) to CAI, we used triple transgenic mice, ECIII-TeTX mice (see Experimental Procedures for the genotype), in which synaptic transmission from MECIII to CA1 is blocked by tetanus toxin (TeTX) (Figure 1A), resulting in an impairment in spatial working memory (Suh et al., 2011Suh J. Rivest A.J. Nakashiba T. Tominaga T. Tonegawa S. Entorhinal cortex layer III input to the hippocampus is crucial for temporal association memory.Science. 2011; 334: 1415-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). To detect electrophysiological abnormalities in these mice, which we henceforth refer to as MT (for mutant), we used silicone linear probe arrays to record LFP profiles along the somatodendritic axis of dorsal CA1 (dCA1) of MTs and control littermates (CTs, see Experimental Procedures for the genotype), and the recorded LFP was categorized into different frequency bands, particularly the two distinct gamma oscillations (Figure 1B and Figure S1A available online). When mice freely explored an open space, high gamma oscillation power, but not theta or low gamma oscillation power, was significantly lower in MTs compared to CTs (Figures 1C, 1D, and S1B–S1E). We also did not detect a significant difference in the frequency, duration, and occurrence of sharp-wave ripples between MTs and CTs (Figure S1F). Autocorrelation analysis showed that the high gamma components were distinct from higher-frequency range oscillations (e.g., >100 Hz), which tend to be susceptible to the possible contamination from spiking activities (Figure S1G). In a delayed nonmatching-to-place (DNMP) T maze task that assays spatial working memory (Figure 1E), MTs showed a significantly delayed learning curve compared to CTs (Figure 1F), as reported previously (Suh et al., 2011Suh J. Rivest A.J. Nakashiba T. Tominaga T. Tonegawa S. Entorhinal cortex layer III input to the hippocampus is crucial for temporal association memory.Science. 2011; 334: 1415-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). High gamma oscillation power spectral densities (PSDs) were lower during the test trial in MTs compared to CTs, but no effect of TeTX blockade was observed on theta or low gamma oscillation power (Figure 1G).Figure S1Blockade of MEC Input to Hippocampal CA1 Impairs High Gamma Oscillations in CA1 but Has No Effect on Sharp-Wave Ripples, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) CSD profiles in a CT mouse (wideband: 1-500 Hz and passband filtered CSDs).

We divided the T maze into multiple segments (Figure 2A, 15 cm bins, c1 to c5 for central arm and r1 and r2 for reward arms) and estimated low gamma oscillation and high gamma oscillation power for each segment separately as mice performed the T maze task. We detected transient high gamma and low gamma incidents (HGIs and LGIs, respectively) by thresholding the power at the 3 SD of the baseline level (see Experimental Procedures for details). HGIs were predominantly detected just before the animals reached the T junction (Figure S2A). Population analysis showed that the power of HGIs, but not the power of LGIs, was greater in the central arm compared to the reward arms in test trials (Figure 2B) and greater in test trials than in sample trials (Figure 2C). The power of HGIs was significantly greater in the segment closest to the T junction (i.e., c1) compared to other segments during test trials (Figures 2D and 2E). The enhanced high gamma oscillation power during test trials tended to dissipate as the animals became overtrained and presumably employed a different strategy to resolve the T maze task (i.e., more than 18 days of training, Figures S2B and S2C).Figure S2Pronounced High Gamma Oscillations at the T Junction Have a Time Window to Be Observed, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Top: low gamma LFP traces (Lo-G) and high gamma LFP traces (Hi-G) in dCA1.

An oscillatory phase synchrony analysis (Figures 3A and S3) (Lachaux et al., 1999Lachaux J.P. Rodriguez E. Martinerie J. Varela F.J. Measuring phase synchrony in brain signals.Hum.

Perception’s shadow: long-distance synchronization of human brain activity.Nature. 1999; 397: 430-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (1558) Google Scholar) revealed that HGIs in dCA1 and dMEC became phase synchronized (for the phase relationship between dCA1 and dMEC, see Figure S3A) when the mouse approached the T junction in test trials and made a correct arm choice (Figures 3B and S3B) (for the detection criteria of synchronized high gamma incidents [sHGIs], see Experimental Procedures). No enhanced synchronization of HGIs was observed during sample trials (Figure 3C as an example) or test trials in which the mouse made an incorrect choice (Figure 3D as an example). LGIs were generally infrequent in MEC, and no major synchrony was observed (Figures 3B–3D, S3B, and S3C as examples). Figures 3E and 3F show quantitative comparisons of cumulative sHGIs during test versus sample trials and success versus failure test trials, respectively, as a function of the track segments in which the animals were located. We found that the phase synchrony started to diverge between sample and test trials in c3, and the difference reached a statistically significant level in c1 (Figure 3E). We also found that the phase synchrony started to diverge between success and failure trials in c2, and the difference reached a statistically significant level in c1 (Figure 3F). Similar results were obtained when we used smaller or larger segmentations of the T maze (Figure S3D) or used different passband settings (Figure S3E). We further determined the distributions of sHGI candidates and significant sHGI events (see Experimental Procedures) found during success test trials and sample trials as a function of the magnitude of phase synchrony (Figures 3G–3J). As is consistent with the Figures 3E and 3F results, much greater numbers of sHGIs were detected in success trials than in sample trials, and the majority of these incidents in success trials occurred in the c1 segment (Figures 3H and 3J).Figure S3Phase Synchrony Statistics between MEC and CA1, More Examples, Different Spatial/Passband Filtering Does Not Alter the Results, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Result of phase synchrony in the high gamma band.

In some test trials (21 trials out of a total of 200 trials monitored) of all wild-type (5 out of 5) that were in earlier stages of training (days 5 to 9), some animals momentarily entered the wrong arm but quickly corrected their choice by changing their heading within the r1 segment and completed the trial successfully (dubbed “oops” case) (Figures 4A, 4B, S3C, S4A, S4C, and Movie S1). In these cases, the sHGIs with the highest synchrony shifted from a point in c1 to the point where the mice were about to make the directional change in r1 (Figures 4A, 4B, S3C, S4A and S4C ). The shift in the location of sHGIs with the highest synchrony from segment c1 to r1 was significant between normal success trials and oops success trials (Figure 4C). The shifted sHGIs on oops success trials occurred at around 200 ms prior to the directional reversal, whereas during normal success trials, the highest sHGIs occurred at around 350 ms before mice made the turn (Figure 4D). Behaviorally, there was not a significant difference in the animal’s trajectories along the central arm between right-turn and left-turn trials (Figure S4D).Figure S4Representative Trajectories for Oops and Normal Success Cases, Related to Figure 4Show full caption(A) Animal trajectory traces from all the Oops Success trials (21 cases including the two cases shown in Figure 4) of CT mice (n = 5 mice).

We next analyzed the spiking activity in dMEC and dCA1 as animals performed the DNMP task. In CTs, we found strong periodic bursts of multiunit activity (MUA) in dMEC that were phase locked to the local theta oscillation (Figure S5A) as they traversed the central arm during success test trials (examples in Figures 5A and S5B). These MUA bursts were sparse in c5 and c4, ramped up toward the T junction in c3 to c1, and rapidly returned to sparse levels in r1 and r2. In failure test trials, however, the MUA bursts did not ramp up (Figure S5D). In oops success trials, MUA bursts and their periodicity remained low in the central arm, elevated to higher levels in the following r1 segment, and subsided as the mice entered r2 (Figure 5B). During sample trials, MUA bursts in dMEC gradually increased toward the T junction but remained high in r1 and r2 (an example in Figure S5C). MUA bursts in dMEC remained sparse throughout the test trials in MTs (an example in Figure S5E). A population analysis confirmed a significant increase in dMEC MUA bursts and their periodicity as CTs traversed the central arm toward the T junction during success test trials (Figure 5C), as well as sustained MUA bursts after the T junction during CT sample trials (Figure S5F). Interestingly, in failure trials, MUA bursts and their periodicity remained relatively low in dMEC throughout the test trials (Figures 5C and S5D). MUA bursts in MTs were much weaker in dMEC compared to CTs, and no obvious ramping was observed toward the T junction (Figure 5C). In dCA1 of CTs, MUA bursts were relatively sparse during test trials compared to dMEC. Nevertheless, a closer analysis of the data revealed heightened burst activities in dCA1 during sHGIs associated with the T junction, which were delayed by about 38 ms compared to dMEC (an example: Figure 5D; group data: Figure 5E). In contrast, we did not detect any sustained bursts in dCA1 of MTs, and MT firing rates were relatively high throughout the trials. To examine whether the high gamma oscillations are linked to spiking output, we also analyzed the phase locking of MUAs in dCA1 to LFP and found that MUAs were phased locked to the high"
https://openalex.org/W1994267372,"To understand regulatory systems, it would be useful to uniformly determine how different components contribute to the expression of all other genes. We therefore monitored mRNA expression genome-wide, for individual deletions of one-quarter of yeast genes, focusing on (putative) regulators. The resulting genetic perturbation signatures reflect many different properties. These include the architecture of protein complexes and pathways, identification of expression changes compatible with viability, and the varying responsiveness to genetic perturbation. The data are assembled into a genetic perturbation network that shows different connectivities for different classes of regulators. Four feed-forward loop (FFL) types are overrepresented, including incoherent type 2 FFLs that likely represent feedback. Systematic transcription factor classification shows a surprisingly high abundance of gene-specific repressors, suggesting that yeast chromatin is not as generally restrictive to transcription as is often assumed. The data set is useful for studying individual genes and for discovering properties of an entire regulatory system."
https://openalex.org/W2074517075,"PTEN dysfunction plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of hereditary and sporadic cancers. Here, we show that PTEN homodimerizes and, in this active conformation, exerts lipid phosphatase activity on PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. We demonstrate that catalytically inactive cancer-associated PTEN mutants heterodimerize with wild-type PTEN and constrain its phosphatase activity in a dominant-negative manner. To study the consequences of homo- and heterodimerization of wild-type and mutant PTEN in vivo, we generated Pten knockin mice harboring two cancer-associated PTEN mutations (PtenC124S and PtenG129E). Heterozygous Pten(C124S/+) and Pten(G129E/+) cells and tissues exhibit increased sensitivity to PI3-K/Akt activation compared to wild-type and Pten(+/-) counterparts, whereas this difference is no longer apparent between Pten(C124S/-) and Pten(-/-) cells. Notably, Pten KI mice are more tumor prone and display features reminiscent of complete Pten loss. Our findings reveal that PTEN loss and PTEN mutations are not synonymous and define a working model for the function and regulation of PTEN."
https://openalex.org/W2064236156,"Neurodegenerative diseases can occur so early as to affect neurodevelopment. From a cohort of more than 2,000 consanguineous families with childhood neurological disease, we identified a founder mutation in four independent pedigrees in cleavage and polyadenylation factor I subunit 1 (CLP1). CLP1 is a multifunctional kinase implicated in tRNA, mRNA, and siRNA maturation. Kinase activity of the CLP1 mutant protein was defective, and the tRNA endonuclease complex (TSEN) was destabilized, resulting in impaired pre-tRNA cleavage. Germline clp1 null zebrafish showed cerebellar neurodegeneration that was rescued by wild-type, but not mutant, human CLP1 expression. Patient-derived induced neurons displayed both depletion of mature tRNAs and accumulation of unspliced pre-tRNAs. Transfection of partially processed tRNA fragments into patient cells exacerbated an oxidative stress-induced reduction in cell survival. Our data link tRNA maturation to neuronal development and neurodegeneration through defective CLP1 function in humans."
https://openalex.org/W1972140586,"Though much is known about the cellular and molecular components of the circadian clock, output pathways that couple clock cells to overt behaviors have not been identified. We conducted a screen for circadian-relevant neurons in the Drosophila brain and report here that cells of the pars intercerebralis (PI), a functional homolog of the mammalian hypothalamus, comprise an important component of the circadian output pathway for rest:activity rhythms. GFP reconstitution across synaptic partners (GRASP) analysis demonstrates that PI cells are connected to the clock through a polysynaptic circuit extending from pacemaker cells to PI neurons. Molecular profiling of relevant PI cells identified the corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) homolog, DH44, as a circadian output molecule that is specifically expressed by PI neurons and is required for normal rest:activity rhythms. Notably, selective activation or ablation of just six DH44+ PI cells causes arrhythmicity. These findings delineate a circuit through which clock cells can modulate locomotor rhythms."
https://openalex.org/W2139657437,"CLP1 is a RNA kinase involved in tRNA splicing. Recently, CLP1 kinase-dead mice were shown to display a neuromuscular disorder with loss of motor neurons and muscle paralysis. Human genome analyses now identified a CLP1 homozygous missense mutation (p.R140H) in five unrelated families, leading to a loss of CLP1 interaction with the tRNA splicing endonuclease (TSEN) complex, largely reduced pre-tRNA cleavage activity, and accumulation of linear tRNA introns. The affected individuals develop severe motor-sensory defects, cortical dysgenesis, and microcephaly. Mice carrying kinase-dead CLP1 also displayed microcephaly and reduced cortical brain volume due to the enhanced cell death of neuronal progenitors that is associated with reduced numbers of cortical neurons. Our data elucidate a neurological syndrome defined by CLP1 mutations that impair tRNA splicing. Reduction of a founder mutation to homozygosity illustrates the importance of rare variations in disease and supports the clan genomics hypothesis."
https://openalex.org/W2047223461,"During social interactions, an individual's behavior is largely governed by the subset of signals emitted by others. Discrimination of ""self"" from ""other"" regulates the territorial urine countermarking behavior of mice. To identify the cues for this social discrimination and understand how they are interpreted, we designed an olfactory-dependent countermarking assay. We find major urinary proteins (MUPs) sufficient to elicit countermarking, and unlike other vomeronasal ligands that are detected by specifically tuned sensory neurons, MUPs are detected by a combinatorial strategy. A chemosensory signature of ""self"" that modulates behavior is developed via experience through exposure to a repertoire of MUPs. In contrast, aggression can be elicited by MUPs in an experience-independent but context-dependent manner. These findings reveal that individually emitted chemical cues can be interpreted based on their combinatorial permutation and relative ratios, and they can transmit both fixed and learned information to promote multiple behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W2000348340,"The otocyst harbors progenitors for most cell types of the mature inner ear. Developmental lineage analyses and gene expression studies suggest that distinct progenitor populations are compartmentalized to discrete axial domains in the early otocyst. Here, we conducted highly parallel quantitative RT-PCR measurements on 382 individual cells from the developing otocyst and neuroblast lineages to assay 96 genes representing established otic markers, signaling-pathway-associated transcripts, and novel otic-specific genes. By applying multivariate cluster, principal component, and network analyses to the data matrix, we were able to readily distinguish the delaminating neuroblasts and to describe progressive states of gene expression in this population at single-cell resolution. It further established a three-dimensional model of the otocyst in which each individual cell can be precisely mapped into spatial expression domains. Our bioinformatic modeling revealed spatial dynamics of different signaling pathways active during early neuroblast development and prosensory domain specification."
https://openalex.org/W1967386359,"Multimeric, ring-shaped molecular motors rely on the coordinated action of their subunits to perform crucial biological functions. During these tasks, motors often change their operation in response to regulatory signals. Here, we investigate a viral packaging machine as it fills the capsid with DNA and encounters increasing internal pressure. We find that the motor rotates the DNA during packaging and that the rotation per base pair increases with filling. This change accompanies a reduction in the motor's step size. We propose that these adjustments preserve motor coordination by allowing one subunit to make periodic, specific, and regulatory contacts with the DNA. At high filling, we also observe the downregulation of the ATP-binding rate and the emergence of long-lived pauses, suggesting a throttling-down mechanism employed by the motor near the completion of packaging. This study illustrates how a biological motor adjusts its operation in response to changing conditions, while remaining highly coordinated."
https://openalex.org/W2171236529,"To signal the onset of salient sensory features or execute well-timed motor sequences, neuronal circuits must transform streams of incoming spike trains into precisely timed firing. To address the efficiency and fidelity with which neurons can perform such computations, we developed a theory to characterize the capacity of feedforward networks to generate desired spike sequences. We find the maximum number of desired output spikes a neuron can implement to be 0.1–0.3 per synapse. We further present a biologically plausible learning rule that allows feedforward and recurrent networks to learn multiple mappings between inputs and desired spike sequences. We apply this framework to reconstruct synaptic weights from spiking activity and study the precision with which the temporal structure of ongoing behavior can be inferred from the spiking of premotor neurons. This work provides a powerful approach for characterizing the computational and learning capacities of single neurons and neuronal circuits."
https://openalex.org/W1965906495,"RUNX2 is a transcription factor that is first expressed in early osteoblast-lineage cells and represents a primary determinant of osteoblastogenesis. While numerous target genes are regulated by RUNX2, little is known of sites on the genome occupied by RUNX2 or of the gene networks that are controlled by these sites. To explore this, we conducted a genome-wide analysis of the RUNX2 cistrome in both pre-osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells (POB) and their mature osteoblast progeny (OB), characterized the two cistromes and assessed their relationship to changes in gene expression. We found that although RUNX2 was widely bound to the genome in POB cells, this binding profile was reduced upon differentiation to OBs. Numerous sites were lost upon differentiation, new sites were also gained; many sites remained common to both cell states. Additional features were identified as well including location relative to potential target genes, abundance with respect to single genes, the frequent presence of a consensus TGTGGT RUNX2 binding motif, co-occupancy by C/EBPβ and the presence of a typical epigenetic histone enhancer signature. This signature was changed quantitatively following differentiation. While RUNX2 binding sites were associated extensively with adjacent genes, the distal nature of the majority of these sites prevented assessment of whether they represented direct targets of RUNX2 action.

Mature osteoblasts are derived from mesenchymal progenitors via a set of distinct cellular intermediates that include the pre-osteoblast; their primary function in the vertebrate skeleton is to form bone (1Bianco P.

It is also apparent that in addition to SOX9, RUNX2, and OSX, osteoblast differentiation and function are also regulated by the temporal and overlapping expression of a myriad of additional transcription factors that include MSX2, TWIST1, SATB2, NFATc1, ATF4, STAT1, C/EBP isoforms, and multiple nuclear receptors as well (2Long F. Building strong bones: molecular regulation of the osteoblast lineage.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2012; 13: 27-38Crossref Scopus (777) Google Scholar). Many of these factors interact directly with RUNX2 and/or OSX either to facilitate or suppress transcription factor events that are important to osteoblast differentiation and/or function. Nevertheless, while many of the players are known, the overall temporal activities of each and their interactions with each other are not well understood. RUNX2 represents one of three members of the RUNT domain family of transcription factors (RUNX-1, -2, and -3) that play central roles in cell fate determination, directing hematopoiesis, skeletogenesis and neurogenesis among others (17Cohen M.M. Perspectives on RUNX genes: an update.Am. J. Med. Genet. 2009; 149A: 2629-2646Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar).

This complexity in regulation highlights the relevance of the direct interactions that occur between RUNX2 and the many additional classes of factors that include cellular kinases, DNA-binding (C/EBPβ, SMADS, β-catenin) and non DNA-binding (HDACs) transcription factors, and regulatory factors that control chromatin structure and function as well. Temporal control of RUNX2 activity ensures the timely expression of gene networks that orchestrate bone cell development and function. A number of genes are known to be directly regulated by RUNX2 (2Long F. Building strong bones: molecular regulation of the osteoblast lineage.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2012; 13: 27-38Crossref Scopus (777) Google Scholar). These targets include osteocalcin (Bglap2), osteopontin (Spp1), Fgf18, Rankl, Vdr, and Runx2 itself. The typical DNA response sequence located at these gene loci that acts in cis is comprised of 5′-T/A/C G T/A/C GG T/G-3′ (31Meyers S. Downing J.R. Hiebert S.W. Identification of AML-1 and the (8;21) translocation protein (AML-1/ETO) as sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins: the runt homology domain is required for DNA binding and protein-protein interactions.Mol.

A clear understanding of the network of genes that are directly regulated by RUNX2 has not been delineated however, due primarily to this factor's diverse biological role in osteoblast lineage cells as well as its complex regulation. A recent ChIP-chip analysis which coupled the binding of RUNX2 at a genome-wide collection of promoter regions in osteosarcoma cells to gene expression has defined a number of potential genetic sites of action of RUNX2 (32van der Deen M. Akech J. Lapointe D. Gupta S. Young D.W. Montecino M.A. Galindo M. Lian J.B. Stein J.L. Stein G.S. van Wijnen A.J.

Chem. 2012; 287: 4503-4517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In addition, an unbiased genome-wide ChIP-seq analysis using RUNX2-negative prostate cells engineered to express RUNX2 in a doxycycline-conditional manner suggests a limited RUNX2 cistrome that is enriched for the cognate RUNX2 binding site motif (33Little G.H. Noushmehr H. Baniwal S.K. Berman B.P. Coetzee G.A. Frenkel B. Genome-wide Runx2 occupancy in prostate cancer cells suggests a role in regulating secretion.Nucleic Acids Res. 2012; 40: 3538-3547Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Despite these studies, an in-depth analysis of the RUNX2 cistrome in osteoblast lineage cells has not been described. In the current study, we used the mouse pre-osteoblastic cell line MC3T3-E1 (POB) and it's in vitro differentiated osteoblast progeny (OB) to investigate the properties of the RUNX2 cistrome in osteoblast lineage cells and to explore the relationship between RUNX2 binding and gene expression. We show through ChIP-seq analysis that while the RUNX2 cistrome is extensive in POBs, it undergoes significant restriction upon differentiation to OBs. Many of the sites identified confirm those found in previous studies through single site analyses. Interestingly, C/EBPβ was found to be a frequent genome-wide co-occupant at many sites of RUNX2 binding. Sites occupied by either RUNX2 or C/EBPβ or both exhibited enriched levels of methylated histone H3K4 (H3K4me1) and acetylated histones H3 and H4, known epigenetic signatures that highlight authentic enhancers. Finally, we show that components of the RUNX2 cistromes correlate directly with both genes whose expression levels are unchanged as well as genes whose expression were altered during in vitro differentiation. Changes in RUNX2 binding are noted at genes whose activities are both increased and decreased during the process of differentiation. ChIP antibodies to C/EBPβ (C-19, sc-150, lot F3011) and RUNX2 (M-70, sc-10758, lot D1411) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA).

Cells were grown to confluency and then changed into differentiation media (10 mm β-glycerophosphate and 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid) and cultured for an additional 15 days, replenishing the media every 2–3 days, to prepare OBs. At the conclusion of differentiation, cells were stained with Alizarin Red and Von Kossa for mineral deposition and bone nodule formation as well as alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and an ALP enzymatic activity assay. For Alizarin Red staining, the cells were washed in PBS, fixed with 10% formaldehyde solution for 20 min at room temp, stained with Alizarin Red solution for 20 min (Alizarin Red S (Sigma-Aldrich) in ddH2O, pH 4.2), rinsed with tap water and dried. For Von Kossa staining, cells were washed with PBS, 5% silver nitrate solution was added for 30 min at room temp, rinsed with ddH2O, exposed to carbonate-formaldehyde solution for 5 min, rinsed with tap water and dried. For ALP staining, cells were washed in PBS, then stained with Alkaline Phosphatase kit (Sigma, 86R-1KT) according to manufacturer's protocol. For ALP enzymatic activity assay, cells were washed in PBS twice, lysed for 30 min shaking at room temperature in Lysis Buffer (20 mm Tris, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm ZnCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100), scraped from plates and transferred to microfuge tubes for assay or storage at −80 °C. The activity assay was performed according to the Alkaline Phosphatase Kit (Sigma 104-100). Samples were compared against a standard curve of diluted p-nitrophenol solution (Sigma N7660) in 0.02 N NaOH. Activity is expressed as International Units (IU) per liter (L), normalized to total lysate protein as assayed by Bradford. A Student's t test was completed for statistical significance compared with D0 (POB). POBs or OBs were first prepared from MC3T3-E1 cells as described above. RNA was isolated using the TRI-Reagent protocol (MRC, Cincinnati, OH) and amplification methods according Roche NimbleGen protocols. Briefly, 10 μg of total RNA was DNase treated and reverse transcribed with the Superscript double stranded cDNA synthesis system (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Double stranded cDNA (dscDNA) was verified for integrity by an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer and qPCR analysis. dscDNA was then labeled with Cy3 as described by Roche NimbleGen. Labeled samples were hybridized to mouse (mm8) 385k microarrays (Roche NimbleGen) in triplicate. Extracted data were processed with the Arraystar 5 package from DNASTAR (Madison, WI) using a moderated t test and multiple testing correction, FDR (Benjimini-Hochberg). All data passing 95% confidence limits greater than 2-fold were included in up- or down-regulated data analysis. Data are displayed as log2 values (log2) as well as fold change values in supplemental Table S1. For all other qRT-PCR and validation, cells were differentiated for 15 or 30 days, 1 μg of isolated total RNA was DNase treated, reverse transcribed using the High Capacity cDNA Kit (ABI, Foster City, CA), and then diluted to 100 μl with RNase/DNase free water. qPCR was performed using primers specific to a select set of differentially expressed genes by Taqman analyses available in supplemental Table S1. Cells were differentiated in 10 cm plates for 0 (POB) or 15 (OB) days as described above. Cells were collected in PBS, centrifuged for 4 min at 4k rpm (4 °C). Pellet is dissolved in buffer A (10 mm Hepes-KOH pH 7.8, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm DTT, and 0.5 mm PMSF) and incubated on ice for 10 min. The differentiated samples contained substantial mineralized matrix and were subjected to 3 × 15s pulses with a Polytron Homogenizer (Power Gen 125, Fisher Scientific). The resulting homogenate was centrifuged (200 × g) through a 10% sucrose buffer at a 1:1 ratio (10 mm Tris-HCl, 15 mm NaCl, 60 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% sucrose). The pelleted nuclei were resuspended in 100 μl of 1× Laemmli buffer (Bio-Rad) and sonicated with a microtip sonic dismembrantor (Fisher) 3 × 10 s pulses. 15 μl of sample was heated to 95 °C for 5 min and loaded for POB and OB samples on TRIS-glycine 4–20% gels (Invitrogen). Blots were transferred to PVDF membrane and blocked with 5% milk in PBS with 1% Tween-20 (PBST) overnight at 4 °C. Primary antibodies for RUNX2 (D130-3, MBL International, 1:1,000) or LaminB1 (ab16048, Abcam, 1:1,000) were applied in 1% milk PBST at room temperature for 1 h. Blots were washed 3 × 15 min with PBST. Secondary antibodies were goat α-mouse IgG2b-HRP (Santa Cruz, 1:10,000) and goat α–rabbit IgG-HRP (Santa Cruz, 1:5,000) in 1% milk PBST at room temperature for 1 h. PVDF membrane was stripped 3× (50 mm glycine pH 2.5, 1% SDS) at room temperature and washed 3× with PBST prior to LaminB1 Western analysis. Detection was completed with SuperSignal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate (Thermo Scientific) on an ImageQuant LAS-4000 (GE Healthcare). Densitometry was completed with ImageJ software. Chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed as described previously (35Meyer M.B. Goetsch P.D. Pike J.W.

Briefly, samples were subjected to immunoprecipitation using either a control IgG antibody or the indicated experimental antibody (VDR, RXR, C/EBPβ, RUNX2, H3K5Ac, H3K9Ac, H3K4me1, H3K4me3, or H3K36me3). For differentiated cells, there was substantial mineralized matrix. To remove the matrix from the assay, the cell/matrix mix was subjected to 3 × 15s pulses with a Polytron Homogenizer (Power Gen 125, Fisher Scientific) while in NCP 1 buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 6.5, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.25% Triton X-100). The resulting homogenate was centrifuged (200 × g) through a 10% sucrose buffer at a 1:1 ratio (10 mm Tris-HCl, 15 mm NaCl, 60 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% sucrose). The resulting cell pellet was re-suspended in NCP 2 buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 6.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 200 mm NaCl) and the remainder of the protocol was followed (35Meyer M.B. Goetsch P.D.

The isolated DNA (or Input DNA acquired prior to precipitation) was then validated by quantitative real time PCR (qPCR) and further prepared for ChIP-seq analysis. ChIP-seq libraries were prepared using the NEBNext DNA sample prep kit (NEB, E6000L) with the Bioo NEXTflex ChIP-seq Barcodes (Bioo Scientific, Austin, TX, 514122) according to manufacturer's protocols. During the NEBNext prep, the Illumina adapters were replaced with the Bioo Scientific Barcoded adapters according to Bioo protocols. ChIP-DNA ligated libraries were purified with Agencourt AMPureXP Magnetic Beads (Beckman-Coulter, A63881). A pre-size selection PCR procedure was performed using Phusion polymerase, NEXTflex Primer Mix, and purified ligation product for 4 PCR cycles according to the Bioo Protocol. Libraries were size-selected using Invitrogen E-gels to 400–500 bp. Samples were then amplified by PCR for 14 cycles using Phusion polymerase, NEXTflex Primer mix and the size-selected DNA as per the Bioo protocol, followed by an Agencourt bead clean up.

https://openalex.org/W1997669380,"Exogenous interleukin 6 (IL-6), synthesized at the initiation of the acute phase response, is considered responsible for signaling hepatocytes to produce acute phase proteins. It is widely posited that IL-6 is either delivered to the liver in an endocrine fashion from immune cells at the site of injury, or alternatively, in a paracrine manner by hepatic immune cells within the liver. A recent publication showed there was a muted IL-6 response in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-injured mice when nuclear NFκB was specifically inactivated in the hepatocytes. This indicates hepatocellular signaling is also involved in regulating the acute phase production of IL-6. Herein, we present extensive in vitro and in vivo evidence that normal hepatocytes are directly induced to synthesize IL-6 mRNAs and protein by challenge with LPS, a bacterial hepatotoxin, and by HGF, an important regulator of hepatic homeostasis. As the IL-6 receptor is found on the hepatocyte, these results reveal that induction of the acute phase response can be regulated in an autocrine as well as endocrine/paracrine fashion. Further, herein we provide data indicating that following partial hepatectomy (PHx), HGF differentially regulates IL-6 production in hepatocytes (induces) versus immune cells (suppresses), signifying disparate regulation of the cell sources involved in IL-6 production is a biologically relevant mechanism that has previously been overlooked. These findings have wide ranging ramifications regarding how we currently interpret a variety of in vivo and in vitro biological models involving elements of IL-6 signaling and the hepatic acute phase response."
https://openalex.org/W2031706510,"Early brain injury (EBI) plays a key role in the pathogenesis of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Neuronal apoptosis is involved in the pathological process of EBI. Hydrogen can inhibit neuronal apoptosis and attenuate EBI following SAH. However, the molecular mechanism underlying hydrogen-mediated anti-apoptotic effects in SAH has not been elucidated. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate whether hydrogen alleviates EBI after SAH, specifically neuronal apoptosis, partially via the Akt/GSK3β signaling pathway.Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 85) were randomly divided into the following groups: sham group (n = 17), SAH group (n = 17), SAH + saline group (n = 17), SAH + hydrogen-rich saline (HS) group (n = 17) and SAH + HS + Ly294002 (n = 17) group. HS or an equal volume of physiological saline was administered immediately after surgery and repeated 8 hours later. The PI3K inhibitor, Ly294002, was applied to manipulate the proposed pathway. Neurological score and SAH grade were assessed at 24 hours after SAH. Western blot was used for the quantification of Akt, pAkt, GSK3β, pGSK3β, Bcl-2, Bax and cleaved caspase-3 proteins. Neuronal apoptosis was identified by double staining of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining and NeuN, and quantified by apoptosis index. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescent double-labeling staining was performed to clarify the relationships between neuronal apoptosis and pAkt or pGSK3β.HS significantly reduced neuronal apoptosis and improved neurological function at 24 hours after SAH. The levels of pAkt and pGSK3β, mainly expressed in neurons, were markedly up-regulated. Additionally, Bcl-2 was significantly increased while Bax and cleaved caspase-3 was decreased by HS treatment. Double staining of pAkt and TUNEL showed few colocalization of pAkt-positive cells and TUNEL-positive cells. The inhibitor of PI3K, Ly294002, suppressed the beneficial effects of HS.HS could attenuate neuronal apoptosis in EBI and improve the neurofunctional outcome after SAH, partially via the Akt/GSK3β pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2019101047,"Recent progress characterizing the reaction mechanism(s) of fluorescent probes with reactive oxygen species has made it possible to rigorously analyze these reactive species in biological systems. We have developed rapid high throughput-compatible assays for monitoring cellular production of superoxide radical anion and hydrogen peroxide using hydropropidine and coumarin boronic acid probes, respectively. Coupling plate reader-based fluorescence measurements with HPLC-based simultaneous monitoring of superoxide radical anion and hydrogen peroxide provides the basis for the screening protocol for NADPH oxidase (Nox) inhibitors. Using this newly developed approach along with the medium-throughput plate reader-based oximetry and EPR spin trapping as confirmatory assays, it is now eminently feasible to rapidly and reliably identify Nox enzyme inhibitors with a markedly lower rate of false positives. These methodological advances provide an opportunity to discover selective inhibitors of Nox isozymes, through enhanced conceptual understanding of their basic mechanisms of action."
https://openalex.org/W1982133548,"Background Effective teamwork is necessary for optimal patient care. There is insufficient understanding of interactions between physicians and nurses on internal medicine wards. Objective To describe resident physicians’ and nurses’ actual behaviours contributing to teamwork quality in the setting of a simulated internal medicine ward. Methods A volunteer sample of 14 pairs of residents and nurses in internal medicine was asked to manage one non-urgent and one urgent clinical case in a simulated ward, using a high-fidelity manikin. After the simulation, participants attended a stimulated-recall session during which they viewed the videotape of the simulation and explained their actions and perceptions. All simulations were transcribed, coded, and analyzed, using a qualitative method (template analysis). Quality of teamwork was assessed, based on patient management efficiency and presence of shared management goals and of team spirit. Results Most resident-nurse pairs tended to interact in a traditional way, with residents taking the leadership and nurses executing medical prescriptions and assuming their own specific role. They also demonstrated different types of interactions involving shared responsibilities and decision making, constructive suggestions, active communication and listening, and manifestations of positive team building. The presence of a leader in the pair or a truly shared leadership between resident and nurse contributed to teamwork quality only if both members of the pair demonstrated sufficient autonomy. In case of a lack of autonomy of one member, the other member could compensate for it, if his/her own autonomy was sufficiently strong and if there were demonstrations of mutual listening, information sharing, and positive team building. Conclusions Although they often relied on traditional types of interaction, residents and nurses also demonstrated readiness for increased sharing of responsibilities. Interprofessional education should insist on better redefinition of respective roles and reinforce behaviours shown to enhance teamwork quality."
https://openalex.org/W2017275992,"Background Physical exercise has positive effects on cognitive function in elderly people. It is unknown, however, if combinations of non-pharmaceutical interventions can produce more benefits than single ones. This study aimed to identify if physical exercise combined with music improves cognitive function in normal elderly people more than exercise alone. Methods We enrolled 119 subjects (age 65–84 years old). Forty subjects performed physical exercise (once a week for an hour with professional trainers) with musical accompaniment (ExM group), developed by YAMAHA Music Foundation; 40 subjects performed the same exercise without music (Ex group); 39 subjects were the control group (Cont group). Before and after the year-long intervention, each patient was assessed by neuropsychological batteries. MRIs were performed before and after intervention; the Voxel-based Specific Regional analysis system for Alzheimer's Disease (VSRAD) was used to assess medial temporal lobe atrophy. Results Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was significant only in visuospatial function. The multiple comparison (ExM vs. Ex, ExM vs. Cont, Ex vs. Cont) was significant between the ExM and Cont group. Intra-group analyses before and after intervention revealed significant improvement in visuospatial function in the ExM group, and significant improvements in other batteries in all three groups. The VSRAD score significantly worsened in the ExM and Ex groups. Conclusions Physical exercise combined with music produced more positive effects on cognitive function in elderly people than exercise alone. We attributed this improvement to the multifaceted nature of combining physical exercise with music, which can act simultaneously as both cognitive and physical training.

Tetratricopeptide repeats (TPR) are protein structural motifs that support protein-protein interactions. A single TPR domain consists of a degenerate 34-amino acid sequence that is composed of two anti-parallel helices (9D'Andrea L.D. Regan L. TPR proteins: the versatile helix.Trends Biochem.

A minimum of three consecutive TPR domains is required to form a functional unit, and this is the most common number of TPR found in a cluster (9D'Andrea L.D. Regan L. TPR proteins: the versatile helix.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 655-662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). Clusters composed of up to 16 sequential TPR have been observed. Proteins with three TPR domains in a cluster favor the recognition of short and defined sequences, whereas proteins with long stretches of consecutive TPR domains tend to be more promiscuous in their selectivity. For example, the Hsp70-Hsp90 organizing protein (HOP) uses two separate clusters of three consecutive TPR domains to bind the EEVD sequence located at the C termini of Hsp70 and Hsp90, facilitating the handoff of a substrate from one chaperone to another (11Scheufler C.

Tom70 displays a combination of TPR clusters as it uses a cluster of three TPR domains to recognize the C terminus of Hsp70 for substrate delivery and a second cluster of seven TPR domains to potentially prepare substrates for mitochondrial import (14Wu Y.

Given the extensive utilization of TPR domains in metazoans to support protein-protein interactions, the ER is expected to contain additional TPR domain proteins that contribute to complex formation and ER organization. An in silico approach was used to expand our understanding of ER adapters that participate in the organization of the ER using TPR domains. TMTC1 and TMTC2 were identified as TPR-containing proteins that possess potential N-terminal ER targeting sequences and multimembrane spanning regions. They were both found to reside in the ER membrane with their TPR domains oriented within the ER lumen. A role for TMTC1 and TMTC2 as adapter proteins was supported by their appearance in large molecular weight complexes. A shotgun proteomics approach was employed that identified SERCA2B as a potential binding partner for TMTC1 and TMTC2, as well as calnexin for TMTC2. Manipulation of the expression levels of TMTC1 and TMTC2 combined with live cell calcium measurements demonstrated that TMTC1 and TMTC2 influenced calcium sequestering in the ER. Collectively, these findings showed that TMTC1 and TMTC2 are two novel TPR-containing ER adapters involved in calcium homeostasis. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), calcium-free DMEM, fetal calf serum, penicillin, streptomycin, and Zysorbin were purchased from Invitrogen. 1-Deoxynojirimycin (DNJ) and Easy-Tag [35S]Cys/Met were purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals and PerkinElmer Life Sciences, respectively. S-protein-agarose beads and S tag antibody were purchased from EMD Millipore. Endo H, PNGase F, avian myeloblastosis virus first strand synthesis kit, and all cloning reagents were purchased from New England Biolabs. FastStart SYBR Green qPCR mix was purchased from Roche Diagnostics, and all primers were acquired from IDT DNA. Anti-mouse HRP IgG, anti-rabbit HRP IgG, and protein A-Sepharose CL-4B were purchased from GE Healthcare. Antibodies directed toward the following antigens were also purchased: SERCA2 (Cell Signaling); Myc (Cell Signaling); calnexin (Enzo Life Sciences); calreticulin (Thermo Scientific); and GM130 (BD Biosciences). TMTC1 and TMTC2 cDNA were purchased (Open Biosystems) and cloned into a pcDNA3.1 A−, a plasmid harboring either a C-terminal S or Myc tag, using standard molecular biology techniques. TMTC1 and TMTC2 were tagged with GFP by inserting the GFP cDNA between the coding region and the C-terminal S tag. These constructs were termed TMTC1GFP and TMTC2GFP. The pcDNA3.1 A− S tag backbone was modified to possess an N-terminal BiP signal sequence prior to the multiple cloning site and a KDEL sequence after the C-terminal S tag. The TPR domains of TMTC1 and TMTC2 were cloned into this plasmid to create TMTC1TPR and TMTC2TPR constructs. shRNA plasmids were purchased from Qiagen. All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. The primary amino acid sequence of TMTC1 and TMTC2 was analyzed by UniProtKB and TPRpred to identify the number and position of putative TPR domains (17UniProt Consortium Update on activities at the Universal Protein Resource (UniProt) in 2013.Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41: D43-D47Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar, 18Karpenahalli M.R. Lupas A.N. Söding J. TPRpred: a tool for prediction of TPR-, PPR-, and SEL1-like repeats from protein sequences.BMC Bioinformatics. 2007; 8: 2Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Hydrophobic domains were identified by the ΔG software, which predicts transmembrane domains (19Hessa T. Meindl-Beinker N.M. Bernsel A. Kim H. Sato Y. Lerch-Bader M. Nilsson I.

Homologues of TMTC1 and TMTC2 were identified by Basic Local Alignment Search Tool searches (20Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. Basic local alignment search tool.J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70322) Google Scholar). The similarity and identify of TMTC1 and TMTC2 were determined using Clustal Omega software (21Sievers F. Wilm A. Dineen D. Gibson T.J. Karplus K. Li W. Lopez R. McWilliam H. Remmert M. Söding J. Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Fast, scalable generation of high-quality protein multiple sequence alignments using Clustal Omega.Mol. Syst. Biol. 2011; 7: 539Crossref PubMed Scopus (9092) Google Scholar). Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T or COS7 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Cells were transfected with polyethyleneimine and the appropriate plasmids for 16 h. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 10 min at room temperature followed by permeabilization with methanol for 10 min at −20 °C. Slides were stained with the indicated primary antibody followed by staining with the appropriate Alexa Fluor 488 or 594 secondary antibodies in immunostaining buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 2% bovine serum albumin). Slides were rinsed and mounted onto coverslips with VectaShield (Vector Laboratories). Images were obtained with a Fluoview 1000 MPE, IX81 motorized inverted research microscope (Olympus Inc.) equipped with a Hamamatsu C8484-05G camera. All images were acquired with a Plan Apo N ×60 1.42NA lens and processed by using the FV10-ASW and the Adobe Photoshop software. Radiolabeling of proteins with [35S]Cys/Met was performed as described previously (22Svedine S. Wang T. Halaban R. Hebert D.N. Carbohydrates act as sorting determinants in ER-associated degradation of tyrosinase.J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2937-2949Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in MNT buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 20 mm MES, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5)). All steps were conducted at 4 °C. The postnuclear supernatant was isolated by centrifugation followed by preclearing with Zysorbin for 1 h. Cleared supernatant was incubated with S-protein-agarose beads overnight and subsequently washed twice with MNT buffer. After the final MNT wash, glycosylation assays were performed by adding appropriate buffers and either mock, Endo H, or PNGase F enzymes according to the manufacturer's protocol. Finally, reducing sample buffer was added to all samples, and they were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Alkaline extraction was performed as described previously (23Tamura T. Cormier J.H. Hebert D.N. Characterization of early EDEM1 protein maturation events and their functional implications.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 24906-24915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Briefly, radiolabeled cells were resuspended in ice-cold homogenization buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 5 mm KCl, 120 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.3 m sucrose) and passed through a 22-gauge needle 20 times. All subsequent steps were conducted at 4 °C. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min to pellet the nuclear fraction. The remaining postnuclear supernatant was centrifuged at 45,000 rpm in Beckman rotor (TLA 120.2) for 10 min to separate the cytosol (supernatant) from the cellular membranes (pellet). The cellular membrane fraction was resuspended in homogenization buffer, and a portion of the resuspended membranes was incubated with 0.1 m Na2CO3 (pH 11.5) for 30 min on ice. The alkaline-extracted portion was centrifuged at 65,000 rpm for 20 min through a sucrose cushion (50 mm triethanolamine, 0.3 m sucrose (pH 7.5)) to separate soluble proteins from membrane proteins in the supernatant and pellet, respectively. The pH was adjusted in the alkaline-extracted sample with 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). An excess of MNT was added to all fractions, and immunoprecipitation or affinity precipitation was performed with protein A-Sepharose and appropriate antisera or with S-protein-agarose, respectively. Radiolabeled cells were homogenized, and the microsomes were purified as described above. Microsomes were resuspended in homogenization buffer, and 10 μg of trypsin and/or Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 0.1%. After incubation for 15 min at 27 °C, the reaction was quenched with 5 μg of soybean trypsin inhibitor. Samples were then resuspended in MNT, and affinity purification was performed as described above. HEK293T cells were treated with either 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 μm thapsigargin, 5 μg/ml tunicamycin, or starved for Cys and Met for 8 h prior to RNA isolation with the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). One μg of purified RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA using the avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase kit (New England Biolabs). qRT-PCRs were performed in 20-μl reactions using FastStart universal SYBR Green master (Rox) kit (Roche Diagnostics Corp.) on an Mx3000P real time PCR machine (Agilent Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Changes in mRNA levels were calculated using the change in cycle threshold value method with β-actin as the reference gene (24Pfaffl M.W. A new mathematical model for relative quantification in real-time RT-PCR.Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: e45Crossref PubMed Scopus (25413) Google Scholar). Statistical analysis of the data was calculated using GraphPad Prism 4.0 (GraphPad Software), and the significance between treatment groups was determined using one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey's multiple comparison tests. The following primers were used: β-actin (5′-GCACTCTTCCAGCCTTCC-3′ and 5′-TGTCCACGTCACACTTCATG-3′), BiP (5′-GCTGTTTCTATTGGCCTTTCTC-3′ and 5′-TGTCTCTTTCACCAGCATCG-3′), TMTC1 (5′-GCTGTTTCTATTGGCCTTTCTC-3′ and 5′-TGTCTCTTTCACCAGCATCG-3′), TMTC2 (5′-GATGTCTTTGTCTTTCACAGGC-3′ and 5′-TGTTTCCCATCCAGTATAACCG 3′). Polycistronic plasmids that express a cytoplasmic GFP and a predesigned shRNA were purchased from Qiagen. HEK293T cells were transfected with the shRNA for 24 h prior to RNA purification and qRT-PCR as described above. To determine transfection efficiency, HEK293T cells were transfected for 24 h followed by trypsinization and resuspension in DMEM. Resuspended cells were loaded onto a Guava easy flow Cytometer (Millipore). Transfected versus nontransfected cells were distinguished based on fluorescence from the cytoplasmic GFP. A total of 5,000 events were counted per measurement. Transfected cells were homogenized, and microsomes were purified as described above. Microsomes were resuspended in mass spectrometry buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 300 mm NaCl, 25 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100) followed by affinity purification with S-protein-agarose beads. Beads were washed twice in MS buffer and twice with 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate followed by resuspension in reducing sample buffer. Samples were loaded onto an SDS-PAGE and allowed to run ∼1 cm into a gel before trypsin digestion. Tryptic peptides were lyophilized, resuspended, and loaded onto a custom column that eluted into a Proxeon Easy nanoLC system directly coupled to an LTQ Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). The Orbitrap was set to achieve full scans from 350 to 2000 m/z with a resolution of 6000. The LTQ ion trap instrument performed 10 scans. Data were analyzed with either Mascot Distiller (Matrix Science, Inc.) or Extract_MSN (Thermo Scientific). The Mascot Search engine (Matrix Science, Inc.) and SwissProt database were used for protein identification. Trypsin digestion and subsequent steps were performed by the Proteomics and Mass Spectrometry Facility, University of Massachusetts Medical School for mass spectrometric analysis. Transfected cells were suspended in homogenization buffer. Part of the homogenate was centrifuged at 45,000 rpm for 10 min to purify microsomes; the pellet was resuspended in reducing sample buffer and was considered the total membrane fraction. An excess of MNT buffer was added to an equal portion of homogenate, and preclearing was performed with control agarose beads, followed by affinity purification with S-protein-agarose beads overnight. Beads were washed twice in MNT buffer. Reducing sample buffer was added, and samples were loaded onto SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and immunoblotted with the appropriate antisera. Blots were developed, and TIFF files were acquired using a G:Box (New England BioGroup), and densitometric quantification of Western blots were performed using MultiGauge software (Fujifilm). The TMTC2 and calnexin interaction was calculated by dividing the amount of calnexin in the S tag affinity purification with the amount of calnexin in the total membrane fraction, with or without DNJ. The interaction with TMTC2 and calnexin in the absence of DNJ was then set to 100%. Error bars represent the standard deviation for three independent experiments. Transfected cells were lysed in MNT, and the postnuclear supernatant was layered on top of a continuous 10–40% sucrose gradient with a 60% cushion in MNT buffer. The gradients were centrifuged for 16 h at 4 °C with a Beckman SW41 at 145,000 × g. Standards used to determine sedimentation velocities were bovine serum albumin (4.6 S, 66 kDa), β-amylase (8.9 S, 200 kDa), and bovine thyroglobulin (19 S, 669 kDa). After centrifugation, 9% of the total gradient volume was collected per fraction, and proteins were isolated with trichloroacetic acid precipitation. Samples were resuspended in reducing sample buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting with the appropriate antisera. After the last fraction was collected, the pellet was processed by adding sample buffer directly to the ultracentrifugation tube. HEK293T cells were plated on a glass bottom 3.5-cm dish and transfected the following day. Cells were loaded with 2.5 μm Fura2 acetoxymethyl ester (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and 2.5 μm Pluronic F-127 for 45 min 16 h post-transfection. Plates were washed with fresh media and incubated for 45 min to allow hydrolysis of the Fura2 acetoxymethyl ester. Plates were then rinsed with fresh media and placed on an inverted microscope with a ×20 objective (Nikon Corp., Tokyo, Japan). Fluorescence was measured every 20 s, and the excitation wavelength was switched between 340 and 380 nm by a filter wheel. After stable baseline fluorescence had been established, carbachol and ATP (final concentration 100 μm for each) were added to the media to release intracellular calcium. Light emitted by Fura2 was collected by a cool SNAP ES digital camera, and all the obtained data were processed using SimplePCI software. Statistical analysis and areas under the curve calculations were completed using GraphPad Prism 4.0 software. The area under the curve was calculated by subtracting the baseline for each of the cells prior to the addition of carbachol. Once individual areas under the curve were obtained, the measurements were averaged for all cells in that treatment. The average calculated for the mock was set to 1.00, and the values of the treated cells were calculated relative to this number. Statistical significance was calculated using an unpaired t test. Cells analyzed in all Fura2 experiments were from at least five different plates collected on three separate days. Experiments with ionomycin were carried out in the same manner with the exception of calcium-free media being used during imaging. As adapter proteins commonly use clusters of TPR domains to modulate protein-protein interactions, we hypothesized that the ER might contain TPR domain-containing proteins, in addition to SEL1L and p58IPK that contribute to the organization of the ER.

https://openalex.org/W2019189343,"The biogenesis of thylakoid membranes in cyanobacteria is presently not well understood, but the vipp1 gene product has been suggested to play an important role in this process. Previous studies in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 reported that vipp1 (sll0617) was essential. By constructing a fully segregated null mutant in vipp1 (SynPCC7002_A0294) in Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002, we show that Vipp1 is not essential. Spectroscopic studies revealed that Photosystem I (PS I) was below detection limits in the vipp1 mutant, but Photosystem II (PS II) was still assembled and was active. Thylakoid membranes were still observed in vipp1 mutant cells and resembled those in a psaAB mutant that completely lacks PS I. When the vipp1 mutation was complemented with the orthologous vipp1 gene from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 that was expressed from the strong P(cpcBA) promoter, PS I content and activities were restored to normal levels, and cells again produced thylakoids that were indistinguishable from those of wild type. Transcription profiling showed that psaAB transcripts were lower in abundance in the vipp1 mutant. However, when the yfp gene was expressed from the P(psaAB) promoter in the presence and the absence of Vipp1, no difference in YFP expression was observed, which shows that Vipp1 is not a transcription factor for the psaAB genes. This study shows that thylakoids are still produced in the absence of Vipp1 and that normal thylakoid biogenesis in Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 requires expression and biogenesis of PS I, which in turn requires Vipp1."

This is mainly based on the findings that the ligand TRAIL has been shown to specifically induce apoptosis in many tumor-derived cell lines or primary tumor cells, whereas most normal tissue cells are resistant to the apoptotic effects of TRAIL (1Johnstone R.W.

TRAILR3 is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein likely lacking any intracellular signaling capability, and TRAILR4 features a truncated DD with sparsely defined signaling capability in its intracellular part, which is obviously incompetent for apoptosis induction (2Kimberley F.C. Screaton G.R. Following a TRAIL: update on a ligand and its five receptors.Cell Res. 2004; 14: 359-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). TRAILR3 and TRAIL4 are often referred to as “decoy receptors,” abbreviated as decoy receptor 1 (DcR1) and DcR2 (2Kimberley F.C. Screaton G.R. Following a TRAIL: update on a ligand and its five receptors.Cell Res. 2004; 14: 359-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar).

Most human cell lines coexpress several TRAIL receptors, and thus receptor interference has been proposed to occur at several levels. First, TRAILR3 and TRAILR4 can bind and consume ligand molecules in terms of a classical decoy mechanism. Regarding ligand binding affinities, however, all four TRAIL receptors appear comparable (7Lee H.W. Lee S.H. Lee H.W. Ryu Y.W. Kwon M.H. Kim Y.S.

In fact, overexpression of TRAILR3 or TRAILR4 has been show to efficiently inhibit TRAILR1- or TRAILR2-mediated apoptosis (10Pan G. Ni J. Wei Y.-F. Yu G.-L. Gentz R. Dixit V.M.

Med. 1997; 186: 1165-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). A second mechanism of receptor interference could occur at the level of signal complex formation. As the ligand TRAIL forms tightly packed homotrimers with three receptor interaction sites between each of its individual subunits (12Hymowitz S.G. Christinger H.W. Fuh G. Ultsch M. O'Connell M. Kelley R.F. Ashkenazi A. de Vos A.M. Triggering cell death: the crystal structure of apo2L/TRAIL in a complex with death receptor 5.Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 563-571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), it was assumed that ligand-mediated receptor trimerization represents the signal initiating structural event. Being incorporated into such signaling complexes, TRAILR3 or TRAILR4 could interfere, resulting in reduced or prevented signaling. Finally, TRAILR4-derived (more unlikely TRAILR3-derived) signals could interfere with pro-apoptotic signaling of TRAIL death receptors (8Degli-Esposti M.A. Dougall W.C. Smolak P.J. Waugh J.Y.

However, the situation at the level of ligand receptor interaction and signal complex formation is likely to be even more complex. Lenardo and co-workers (13Chan F.K. Chun H.J. Zheng L. Siegel R.M.

The PLAD has been originally detected for the TNF receptor and the CD95/Fas system but later also in the TRAIL receptor system. Remarkably, and in contrast to the TNF receptor system, it was reported that TRAIL receptors are also capable of forming heterooligomers via PLAD interaction (15Clancy L. Mruk K. Archer K. Woelfel M. Mongkolsapaya J. Screaton G. Lenardo M.J. Chan F.K. Preligand assembly domain-mediated ligand-independent association between TRAIL receptor 4 (TR4) and TR2 regulates TRAIL-induced apoptosis.Proc.

This is in agreement with the highly conserved membrane distal partial cysteine-rich domain 1 (CRD1) of these molecules, which probably contains the PLAD interaction motif (12Hymowitz S.G.

It was argued that the existence of pre-assembled mixed receptor complexes allows TRAILR4 to act as a regulatory receptor independent from the classical decoy mechanism. In contrast, Micheau and co-workers (17Mérino D. Lalaoui N. Morizot A. Schneider P. Solary E. Micheau O. Differential inhibition of TRAIL-mediated DR5-DISC formation by decoy receptors 1 and 2.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 7046-7055Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) argued that TRAILR4 becomes recruited into the signaling complex of TRAILR2 in a strictly ligand-dependent manner, whereas TRAILR3, being located in cholesterol enriched membrane microdomains, acts via the decoy mechanism. In addition, overexpression of TRAILR4 has been reported to induce anti-apoptotic activities via stimulation of NFκB (8Degli-Esposti M.A. Dougall W.C. Smolak P.J. Waugh J.Y. Smith C.A. Goodwin R.G.

Based on studies with bivalent chemical cross-linking agents, originally a stoichiometry of three was proposed for the TNF receptors and CD95/Fas (13Chan F.K. Chun H.J. Zheng L. Siegel R.M. Bui K.L. Lenardo M.J. A domain in TNF receptors that mediates ligand-independent receptor assembly and signaling.Science. 2000; 288: 2351-2354Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar, 14Siegel R.M.

In our studies, however, using TNF receptor chimeras containing the intracellular signaling domain of CD95/Fas, predominantly homodimer formation was found (20Branschädel M. Aird A. Zappe A. Tietz C. Krippner-Heidenreich A. Scheurich P. Dual function of cysteine rich domain (CRD) 1 of TNF receptor type 1: conformational stabilization of CRD2 and control of receptor responsiveness.Cell.

Signal. 2010; 22: 1088-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Deletion studies showed that the PLAD-positive membrane distal CRD of TNFR1 is necessary for high affinity ligand interaction (13Chan F.K. Chun H.J. Zheng L. Siegel R.M. Bui K.L. Lenardo M.J. A domain in TNF receptors that mediates ligand-independent receptor assembly and signaling.Science. 2000; 288: 2351-2354Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). It is evident that the homotrimeric ligand might bind to oligomerized receptors with higher avidity (22Winkel C. Neumann S. Surulescu C. Scheurich P. A minimal mathematical model for the initial molecular interactions of death receptor signaling.Math. Biosci. Eng. 2012; 9: 663-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) but in addition CRD1 is likely to serve as a scaffold for CRD2, which is involved in ligand interaction (20Branschädel M. Aird A. Zappe A. Tietz C. Krippner-Heidenreich A. Scheurich P. Dual function of cysteine rich domain (CRD) 1 of TNF receptor type 1: conformational stabilization of CRD2 and control of receptor responsiveness.Cell. Signal. 2010; 22: 404-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In the present study we confirm that TRAIL receptors 1, 2, and 4 are capable of forming not only homooligomers but also all combinations of heterooligomers in a ligand-independent manner. For both homo- and heterooligomeric complexes the predominant formation of dimers is observed. Using cells coexpressing TRAILR1 and TRAILR4, we demonstrate that the latter efficiently inhibits both pro- and anti-apoptotic signals transduced by TRAILR1. Direct anti-apoptotic signaling mediated by TRAILR4 is excluded experimentally. Mathematical modeling reveals that formation of nonfunctional heteromeric complexes of both TRAIL receptors represents a powerful mechanism of TRAIL receptor interference that is in good accordance with our experimental data. In contrast, a ligand consuming decoy mechanism can be excluded by our simulation studies. Accordingly, the mechanism of TRAILR1 and TRAILR4 interference observed by us is likely based on the formation of signaling incompetent mixed receptor complexes, a process driven by the distribution of homo- and heterodimers present on the cell already in the absence of ligand. The expression plasmid pEFpuroTRAILR4 was generated by subcloning TRAILR4 cDNA from the plasmid pCR3 hTRAILR4full (kindly provided by Prof. H. Wajant, University of Wuerzburg, Wuerzburg, Germany) using the restriction endonucleases BamHI and EcoRV (New England Biolabs Inc., Ipswich, MA). Expression plasmids encoding the fusion proteins TRAILR1ΔC-GFP, TRAILR1ΔC-mCherry, TRAILR2ΔC-GFP, TRAILR2ΔC-mCherry, TRAILR4ΔC-GFP, and TRAILR4ΔC-mCherry were produced by PCR cloning. Therefore, the extracellular and transmembrane domains as well as the first 14 intracellular amino acids were amplified from the plasmids pCR3 DR4, pCR3 DR5 (kindly provided by Prof. H. Wajant), or pEFpuroTRAILR4 by standard PCR and subsequently ligated into the expression plasmids peGFP-N1 or pmCherry-N1 (Clontech Laboratories, Mountain View, CA) after double digestion using SacI and AgeI. The expression plasmid coding for TNFR1ΔC-GFP has been described elsewhere (23Gerken M. Krippner-Heidenreich A. Steinert S. Willi S. Neugart F. Zappe A. Wrachtrup J. Tietz C. Scheurich P.

For stable expression in mammalian cells, TRAILR2ΔC-GFP and TRAILR4ΔC-GFP were subcloned from pEGFP-N1 into pCDNA3.1+ (Invitrogen) using HindIII and NotI. Generation of TRAILR2ΔC-FLAG was achieved by standard PCR using appropriate primers carrying a nucleotide sequence encoding for a FLAG tag at the 5′-end of the reverse primer. The resulting fragment was ligated into the expression plasmid pEFpuro (24Huang D.C. Cory S. Strasser A.

All constructs generated by PCR were verified by DNA sequencing. FLAG-tagged recombinant human TRAIL (TRAIL) was purchased from Enzo Life Sciences (Lörrach, Germany). Cycloheximide and α-FLAG antibody (clone M2) were from Sigma. Bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)-suberate (BS3) was purchased from Pierce. All chemicals were of analytical grade.

HeLa cells had been obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (LGC Standards GmbH, Wesel, Germany). Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 2 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (PAN Biotech, Aidenbach, Germany).For generation of stably transfected cells, MFs (3 × 105 cells per well) were seeded in 6-well plates and grown overnight. The following day cells were transfected with the respective expression plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. HeLa (3 × 105 cells per well) were seeded in 6-well plates and transfected the following day with plasmids pEFpuroTRAILR4 or pCDNA3.1+TRAILR4ΔC-GFP using Effectene (Qiagen, Duesseldorf, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The day after transfection, cells were selected for stable expression using 2 μg/ml puromycin and/or 200 μg/ml zeocin. After 2–3 weeks cells were sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Cell sorting was performed two to three times per cell line in total. Samples were resolved by Tris/glycine SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (Whatman, Schleicher & Schuell), which was then blocked using Roche blocking reagent (Roche Diagnostics) or 5% nonfat milk powder (Carl Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) in PBS containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature. Cleaved caspase-8 was detected using rabbit α-cleaved Caspase-8 (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Danvers, MA) antibody, and for detection of caspase-3, rabbit α-Caspase 3 (Cell Signaling Technology) was used. Proteins fused to FLAG tag or enhanced GFP (eGFP) were detected using rabbit α-DYKDDDDK-tag (Cell Signaling Technology) or mouse α-GFP antibody (Roche Diagnostics), respectively. IκBα and phospho-IκBα were detected using mouse α-IκBα and mouse α-phospho-IκBα, both purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated α-mouse IgG and α-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies were from Dianova (Hamburg, Germany). Mouse α-tubulin-α (NeoMarkers, ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) in combination with IRDye800CW-conjugated α-mouse IgG (LI-COR Biotechnology GmbH, Bad Homburg, Germany) was used as loading control. For cell death assays HeLa cells (2 × 104 cells/well) were grown in 96-well plates overnight. The next day cells were preincubated for 1 h with 20 μm benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone (Bachem AG, Bubendorf, Switzerland) or not and then stimulated with serial dilutions of recombinant human TRAIL (previously cross-linked by incubation with 1 μg/ml α-FLAG M2 antibody for 1 h at 37 °C) in combination with 0.5 μg/ml cycloheximide. After 24 h cells were stained with crystal violet (20% methanol, 0.5% crystal violet), and optical density at 550 nm was determined using an ELISA plate reader as described (25Krippner-Heidenreich A. Tübing F. Bryde S. Willi S. Zimmermann G. Scheurich P. Control of receptor-induced signaling complex formation by the kinetics of ligand/receptor interaction.J. Biol.

Mouse fibroblasts stably expressing truncated TRAILR variants (1 × 106 cells) were grown overnight in 6-cm cell culture dishes. Chemical cross-linking was performed on ice as described (20Branschädel M. Aird A. Zappe A. Tietz C. Krippner-Heidenreich A. Scheurich P. Dual function of cysteine rich domain (CRD) 1 of TNF receptor type 1: conformational stabilization of CRD2 and control of receptor responsiveness.Cell. Signal. 2010; 22: 404-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation of chemically cross-linked cell surface proteins MFs stably expressing two differently tagged truncated TRAILR variants (3 × 106 cells) were grown overnight in 10-cm cell culture dishes, and cell surface proteins were cross-linked the following day. Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, harvested, and pelleted. The cells were then lysed in solubilization buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.25% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, pH 7.4) supplemented with complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics) and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Five micrograms of α-FLAG antibody were added and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h before the addition of 25 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) for 16 h on a rotary mixer at 4 °C. Beads were washed with solubilization buffer, and Laemmli sample buffer with 5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol was added. For FACS analysis 2 × 105 cells and for FACS sorting 3 × 106 cells were resuspended in PBA (PBS supplemented with 0.5% (w/v) BSA and 0.02% (w/v) NaN3) containing primary antibody (α-TRAILR1 MAB347, α-TRAILR2 MAB6311, α-TRAILR3 MAB6302, or α-TRAILR4 MAB 633; all from R&D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN). After incubation for 1 h on ice cells were washed in PBA and resuspended in PBA containing the secondary goat α-mouse-IgG+IgM (H+L)-phycoerythrin-conjugated (Dianova). After 45 min of incubation cells were washed again and resuspended in 400 μl of PBA. Cells were analyzed using Beckman Coulter Cytomics FC 500 or sorted using BD Biosciences FACS Vantage SE with FACSDiVa. For sorting, 3 × 104 positive cells were collected in 5 ml of RPMI1640 + 5% FCS containing 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Immediately after sorting, cells were transferred into 6-well plates and cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Results from cytofluorometric analyses are presented as biexponential (logicle) histogram plots. MFs (1.5 × 105 cells) were seeded on 18 × 18-mm coverslips and grown overnight. The following day cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of plasmid DNA encoding the receptor-eGFP and 0.25 μg of plasmid DNA encoding the receptor-mCherry fusion protein using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 24 h transfected cells were washed with PBS and fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at 20–25 °C. Coverslips were then mounted onto microscopy slides using Fluoromount G. Images were acquired using a Zeiss LSM710 confocal laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Jena, Germany). GFP was excited with the 488 nm line of the argon laser, and fluorescence was detected at 490- 550 nm. mCherry was excited with the 561-nm line of a diode-pumped solid state laser, and fluorescence was detected at 570- 650 nm. The imaging sequence was as follows: first donor and acceptor channels were sequentially scanned at low laser intensity. Subsequently, the acceptor was bleached with the 561-nm laser line at 75% intensity. Finally, donor and acceptor channels were again scanned at low laser intensity. Acquired images were exported to 8-bit TIFF format using Zeiss ZEN 2010 software. For analysis of FRET efficiency, images were imported into Fiji, and FRET efficiency was calculated using the ImageJ plug-in FRETcalc Version 4.0 (26Stepensky D. FRETcalc plugin for calculation of FRET in non-continuous intracellular compartments.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 359: 752-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). False-colored FRET images for illustration purposes were calculated using the MATLAB standalone application FRET_Plotter. To quantify the effect of the formation of heteromeric receptor complexes on TRAIL signaling, we developed a mechanistic mathematical model of the biochemical reaction network. This model considered the formation of receptor homo- and heterodimers (R1-R3) as well as the binding of TRAIL to receptor dimers (R4-R6).

https://openalex.org/W2094659734,"Albumin is the most abundant protein in blood and plays a pivotal role as a multitransporter of a wide range of molecules such as fatty acids, metabolites, hormones, and toxins. In addition, it binds a variety of drugs. Its role as distributor is supported by its extraordinary serum half-life of 3 weeks. This is related to its size and binding to the cellular receptor FcRn, which rescues albumin from intracellular degradation. Furthermore, the long half-life has fostered a great and increasing interest in utilization of albumin as a carrier of protein therapeutics and chemical drugs. However, to fully understand how FcRn acts as a regulator of albumin homeostasis and to take advantage of the FcRn-albumin interaction in drug design, the interaction interface needs to be dissected. Here, we used a panel of monoclonal antibodies directed towards human FcRn in combination with site-directed mutagenesis and structural modeling to unmask the binding sites for albumin blocking antibodies and albumin on the receptor, which revealed that the interaction is not only strictly pH-dependent, but predominantly hydrophobic in nature. Specifically, we provide mechanistic evidence for a crucial role of a cluster of conserved tryptophan residues that expose a pH-sensitive loop of FcRn, and identify structural differences in proximity to these hot spot residues that explain divergent cross-species binding properties of FcRn. Our findings expand our knowledge of how FcRn is controlling albumin homeostasis at a molecular level, which will guide design and engineering of novel albumin variants with altered transport properties."
https://openalex.org/W1974996125,"Nitric oxide (NO) is a critical regulator of vascular tone and plays an especially prominent role in liver by controlling portal blood flow and pressure within liver sinusoids. Synthesis of NO in sinusoidal endothelial cells by endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) is regulated in response to activation of endothelial cells by vasoactive signals such as endothelins. The endothelin B (ETB) receptor is a G-protein-coupled receptor, but the mechanisms by which it regulates eNOS activity in sinusoidal endothelial cells are not well understood. In this study, we built on two previous strands of work, the first showing that G-protein βγ subunits mediated activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Akt to regulate eNOS and the second showing that eNOS directly bound to the G-protein-coupled receptor kinase-interacting protein 1 (GIT1) scaffold protein, and this association stimulated NO production. Here we investigated the mechanisms by which the GIT1-eNOS complex is formed and regulated. GIT1 was phosphorylated on tyrosine by Src, and Y293F and Y554F mutations reduced GIT1 phosphorylation as well as the ability of GIT1 to bind to and activate eNOS. Akt phosphorylation activated eNOS (at Ser(1177)), and Akt also regulated the ability of Src to phosphorylate GIT1 as well as GIT1-eNOS association. These pathways were activated by endothelin-1 through the ETB receptor; inhibiting receptor-activated G-protein βγ subunits blocked activation of Akt, GIT1 tyrosine phosphorylation, and ET-1-stimulated GIT1-eNOS association but did not affect Src activation. These data suggest a model in which Src and Akt cooperate to regulate association of eNOS with the GIT1 scaffold to facilitate NO production."

OSAS risk was determined by positivity for Berlin questionnaire (BQ), and daytime sleepiness by the Sleepness Epworth Scale (ESS). Liver damage was evaluated according to the NAFLD activity score.In NAFLD patients, BQ alone was positive in 39 (25%), ESS in 8 (5%), and both in 13 (8%, OSAS with sleepines); p = ns vs. controls without steatosis. In NAFLD patients at risk for OSAS with (but not in those without) sleepiness, we observed a higher prevalence of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH; 11/13, 85% vs. 72/146, 49%; p = 0.018), and of clinically significant fibrosis (stage>1; 9/13, 69% vs. 39/146, 27%; p = 0.003). At multivariate logistic regression analysis, OSAS with sleepiness was strongly associated with NASH and fibrosis>1 independently of known clinical risk factors such as age, gender, BMI, diabetes, and ALT levels (OR 7.1, 95% c.i. 1.7-51, p = 0.005 and OR 14.0, 95% c.i. 3.5-70, p = 0.0002, respectively).A proportion of NAFLD patients without severe obesity is at risk for OSAS with daytime sleepiness, which is associated with the severity of liver damage independently of body mass and other cofactors."
https://openalex.org/W2025532147,"Secretin, a classical gastrointestinal hormone released from S cells in response to acid and dietary lipid, regulates pleiotropic physiological functions, such as exocrine pancreatic secretion and gastric motility. Subsequent to recently proposed revisit on secretin's metabolic effects, we have confirmed lipolytic actions of secretin during starvation and discovered a hormone-sensitive lipase-mediated mechanistic pathway behind. In this study, a 12 wk high-fat diet (HFD) feeding to secretin receptor-knockout (SCTRT–/–) mice and their wild-type (SCTR+/+) littermates revealed that, despite similar food intake, SCTR–/– mice gained significantly less weight (SCTR+/+ : 49.6±0.9 g; SCTRT–/– : 44.7±1.4 g; P<0.05) and exhibited lower body fat content. These SCTR–/– mice have corresponding alleviated HFD-associated hyperleptinemia and improved glucose/insulin tolerance. Further analyses indicate that SCTR–/– have impaired intestinal fatty acid absorption while having similar energy expenditure and locomotor activity. Reduced fat absorption in the intestine is further supported by lowered postprandial triglyceride concentrations in circulation in SCTR–/– mice. In jejunal cells, transcript and protein levels of a key fat absorption regulator, cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36), was reduced in knockout mice, while transcript of Cd36 and fatty-acid uptake in isolated enterocytes was stimulated by secretin. Based on our findings, a novel positive feedback pathway involving secretin and CD36 to enhance intestinal lipid absorption is being proposed.—Sekar, R., Chow, B. K. C.

Although the protein-l-isoaspartyl (d-aspartyl) O-methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.77) can initiate the repair of l-isoaspartyl residues to l-aspartyl residues in most organisms, no gene homolog or enzymatic activity is present in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Therefore, we used biochemical approaches to elucidate how proteins containing isoaspartyl residues are metabolized in this organism.

Selective blockade of leukocyte migration into the gut is a promising strategy for the treatment of IBD. This study explored the effect of the immunomodulating tellurium compound ammonium trichloro (dioxoethylene-o,o′) tellurate (AS101) on dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced murine colitis. Both oral and intraperitoneal administration of AS101 significantly reduced clinical manifestations of IBD. Colonic inflammatory cytokine levels (IL-17 and IL-1β) were significantly down-regulated by AS101 treatment, whereas IFN-γ was not affected. Neutrophil and α4β7+ macrophage migration into the tissue was inhibited by AS101 treatment. Adhesion of mesenteric lymph node cells to mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule (MAdCAM-1), the ligand for α4β7 integrin, was blocked by AS101 treatment both in vitro and in vivo. DSS-induced destruction of colonic epithelial barrier/integrity was prevented by AS101, via up-regulation of colonic glial-derived neurotrophic factor, which was found previously to regulate the intestinal epithelial barrier through activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway. Indeed, the up-regulation of glial-derived neurotrophic factor by AS101 was associated with increased levels of colonic pAKT and BCL-2 and decreased levels of BAX. Furthermore, AS101 treatment reduced colonic permeability to Evans blue and decreased colonic TUNEL+ cells. Our data revealed multifunctional activities of AS101 in the DSS-induced colitis model via anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic properties.

Studies in humans and in experimental models of IBD have revealed impaired mucosal barrier function, activated innate immunity, altered production of Th1 and Th2 cytokines, and the activation of CD4+ T cells in the pathogenesis of IBD (1Podolsky D.K.

T regulatory cells play an essential role in the maintenance of intestinal immune homeostasis and were also shown to be capable of preventing and reversing established colitis (4Mottet C. Uhlig H.H. Powrie F. Cutting edge: cure of colitis by CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells.J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 3939-3943Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). The etiologies of these diseases remain unclear. The most widely held hypothesis regarding the pathogenesis of IBD is that aberrant activation or defective down-regulation of innate immunity and overly aggressive acquired (T cell) immune responses to a subset of commensal enteric bacteria develop in genetically susceptible hosts, and environmental factors precipitate the onset or reactivation of disease (1Podolsky D.K.

It is evident now that both innate cell populations (e.g. γδ T cells, LTi-like cells, and monocytes/macrophages) and adaptive T cells (Th17 cells) can produce IL-17, which has a crucial role in inflammatory and autoimmune diseases (7Cua D.J.

In addition to IL-17, IL-1 is important in the pathogenesis of IBD because of its pro-inflammatory activities. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from patients with Crohn disease were shown to produce high levels of IL-1 in vitro compared with normal control cells (13Satsangi J. Wolstencroft R.A.

Macrophages have been implicated in the pathogenesis of a variety of chronic and autoimmune diseases including IBD. The classically activated macrophages are key producers of many cytokines (e.g. IL-1, IL-6, and TNFα) and reactive metabolites of oxygen and nitrogen (e.g. nitric oxide) that have been implicated in the development of IBD (16Mosser D.M.

Feeding mice with polymeric dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) in their drinking water induces acute or chronic colitis characterized by bloody diarrhea, ulceration, loss of body weight, and infiltration with granulocytes or mononuclear cells, reflecting IBD symptoms (18Okayasu I. Hatakeyama S. Yamada M. Ohkusa T. Inagaki Y. Nakaya R.

This widely used murine colitis model is helpful for studying the effect of novel therapeutic agents for the management of IBD (19Wirtz S. Neurath M.F. Mouse models of inflammatory bowel disease.Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 2007; 59: 1073-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Integrins are transmembrane cell adhesion receptors composed of noncovalently associated α and β subunits that bind to cell surface ligands, soluble ligands, and extracellular matrix proteins (20Hynes R.O. Integrins: versatility, modulation, and signaling in cell adhesion.Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9002) Google Scholar). These adhesive interactions are essential for leukocyte recirculation, migration into inflammatory sites, recognition of foreign antigens, and survival and proliferation (21Hynes R.O.

Circulating T cells that bear α4β7 integrins bind to mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule (MAdCAM), which is constitutively expressed on high endothelial venules of Peyer's patches and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs), as well as on postcapillary venules of gut lamina propia (LP) (2Sartor R.B.

MAdCAM-1 expression is up-regulated on inflamed venules in chronic inflammatory diseases such as in IBD, diabetes, chronic relapsing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, etc. Of note, α4β7 integrin is also expressed on stimulated monocytes and macrophages (25Yang Y.

Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 383-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibody to integrin-α4 (natalizumab), which binds both integrin-α4β7 (the MAdCAM-1 ligand) and integrin-α4β1 (the vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 ligand), is effective in treating Crohn disease (26Ghosh S.

The neurotrophin glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) has a strong effect on neurite outgrowth and differentiation and is able to protect neurons from apoptosis under various conditions. Interestingly, it has been shown that ablation of enteric glia leads to a fulminant hemorrhagic jejunoileitis in mice (28Bush T.G. Savidge T.C. Freeman T.C. Cox H.J. Campbell E.A. Mucke L.

GDNF is up-regulated in IBD and has strong anti-apoptotic properties in colonic epithelial cells via activation of MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways (29Steinkamp M. Geerling I. Seufferlein T. von Boyen G.

AS101 is a small nontoxic tellurium IV compound (Fig. 1) currently being evaluated in phase II clinical trials in psoriasis patients (unpublished data) and in prevention of bone marrow toxicity induced by chemotherapy in cancer patients (30Sredni B.

Accumulated evidence suggests that much of the biological activity of tellurium compounds is directly related to their specific chemical interactions with endogenous thiols. If the reacting thiol is a cysteine residue, the reaction product may alter the biological activity of the target protein (34Albeck A. Weitman H. Sredni B. Albeck M. Tellurium compounds: Selective inhibition of cysteine proteases and model reaction with thiols.Inorg. Chem. 1998; 37: 1704-1712Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The Te(IV)-thiol chemical bond may lead to conformational change or disulfide bond formation, possibly resulting in a loss of biological activity, if the thiol residue is essential for a particular function. Indeed, we demonstrated that AS101 specifically inactivates cysteine proteases while exhibiting no effect on the other families of serine-, aspartic-, and metallo-proteases, in good agreement with the predictions of its unique Te (IV)-thiol chemistry. Furthermore, the proteolytic activity of the inactivated cysteine proteases could be recovered by reducing agents such as NaBH4, further supporting the suggestion that the inactivation process involves oxidation of the catalytic thiol to a disulfide (34Albeck A. Weitman H. Sredni B. Albeck M. Tellurium compounds: Selective inhibition of cysteine proteases and model reaction with thiols.Inorg. Chem. 1998; 37: 1704-1712Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In light of its chemical activities, AS101 has been shown to exert anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects in different in vivo models (35Brodsky M. Yosef S. Galit R. Albeck M. Longo D.L.

In the present study, we tested the effect of AS101 on a DSS-induced murine colitis model. Our findings revealed anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic properties of AS101 through the down-regulation of colonic inflammatory cytokine levels, prevention of inflammatory cell migration into the tissue, and inhibition of colonic apoptotic processes. Male C57BL/6 mice, 8–12 weeks old, were purchased from Harlan Laboratories (Jerusalem, Israel). The mice were kept in a specific pathogen-free environment and fed standard pellet diet and tap water. The mice were allowed to acclimate for 7 days before the experiments. Animal experiments were performed in accordance with institutional protocols, and experiments were approved by the institutional animal care and use committee. The mice were divided into groups with identical average body weight. DSS (molecular weight, 36,000–50,000; MP Biomedicals, Eschwege, Germany) was added to tap water at a concentration of 3.5% (w/v). The mice were given DSS solution for 7 days, followed by 5 days of regular water. Fresh DSS solution was prepared every other day. AS101 was supplied in a solution of PBS (pH 7.4) and maintained at 4 °C. Before use, AS101 was diluted in PBS, and the indicated doses were used. AS101 was administrated either by intraperitoneal injection or by oral administration. In the injection treatment, mice were given DSS and injected daily intraperitoneally with PBS (DSS+PBS) or with AS101 (10 μg/mouse per injection) either concomitantly with the initiation of DSS supplementation (DSS+AS(d0)) or 2 days later (DSS+AS(d2)). The control mice received regular tap water only and were injected daily with intraperitoneal injections of PBS (PBS). For the oral treatment, the mice were given DSS and were treated by oral administration of PBS (DSS+PBS) or AS101 (100 μg/mouse) given concomitantly with DSS (DSS+AS(d0)) by 18 gauge feeding needle. Control mice received oral administration of PBS alone (PBS). The mice were monitored for body weight, stool consistency, rectal bleeding, and fecal occult blood. Fecal occult blood was examined by Hemoccult test (Beckman Coulter Inc, Fullerton CA). Bleeding score included the fecal occult blood test, and visible blood from the rectum and was graded as 0 = negative, 2 = positive by Hemoccult, and 3 = visible blood. Fecal pellets were given a stool consistency score of 0 = normal fecal pellet, 1 = slightly loose stool, 2 = loose stool, and 3 = diarrhea. At necropsy, the colons were cut out and measured to determine colon length. 1 cm of the distal colon was taken for histology or immunohistochemical staining. Another 1–2 cm of the distal colon was used for protein analysis. Tissue sections from the distal colon were fixed in 4% buffered formaldehyde. Paraffin-embedded sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Histopathology scoring was performed by a pathologist in a blinded fashion and graded according to the following parameters: severity of inflammation (0–3; none, slight, moderate, and severe), depth of injury (0–3; none, mucosal, mucosal and submucosal, and transmural), and crypt damage (0–4; none, basal damage, severe basal damage, only surface epithelium intact, and loss of entire crypt and epithelium). The score of all the parameters was summed to a maximum score of 10 per mouse and calculated as an average histopathology score per group. Histopathology scoring was performed on sections prepared from the experiment testing AS101 treatment by intraperitoneal injection. Immunohistochemical detection of IL-17 and CD4 was performed on paraffin-embedded slides of distal colon sections. Deparaffinized sections were incubated overnight (4 °C) with rabbit polyclonal antibody against human IL-17 (Santa Cruz) or mouse monoclonal antibody against mouse CD4 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA). Subsequently, incubation with secondary antibodies and substrate addition was performed using a commercial staining kit (Vectastain ABC kit) following the manufacturer's instructions. Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. For in situ detection of apoptosis, the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) method (Apoptag kit; Millipore) was used. Paraffin tissue sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated followed by heat-induced antigen retrieval using boiling 0.01 m citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for 10 min in a microwave. The sections were then blocked for 30 min using a blocking buffer (1% BSA and 0.5% Triton in PBS). Double staining was performed at 4 °C overnight using a mixture of mouse anti-CD68 (Abcam) and rabbit anti-ITGB7 (Proteintech) primary antibodies. Secondary antibodies were a mixture of Alexa 594 (anti-mouse) and Alexa 488 (anti-rabbit) conjugates (Molecular Probes). Nuclei were counterstained using Hoechst. MPO was measured in tissue from distal colon. Samples were rinsed with cold PBS, blotted dry, and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Samples were stored at −80 °C until assayed for MPO activity using the ο-dianisidine method (40Krawisz J.E. Sharon P. Stenson W.F. Quantitative assay for acute intestinal inflammation based on myeloperoxidase activity. Assessment of inflammation in rat and hamster models.Gastroenterology. 1984; 87: 1344-1350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1626) Google Scholar). Tissue samples were thawed and weighed. The samples were then suspended (5% w/v) in 50 mm potassium buffer phosphate (pH 6) containing 0.5% hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (0.1 g/20 ml of potassium phosphate) and homogenized. Samples were sonicated for 30 s (15 watts) and then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 25 min at 4 °C. The reaction was initiated by incubating the supernatant (20 μl) at 20 °C for 20 min with 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (180 μl) containing 1 mm ο-dianisidine dihydrochloride and 5 × 10−4% H2O2. The change in the absorbance was read every 30 s by a microplate reader (Bio-Rad). MPO activity was expressed as the amount of enzyme necessary to produce a 1 unit change in the absorbance per min per g of tissue. An IL-17/IL-1β ELISA kit (R&D Systems) and IFN-γ ELISA kit (Diaclone) were used for quantitative cytokine measurements in mouse colonic lysates. GDNF concentrations in colonic lysates were measured by a commercial GDNF ELISA kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (GDNF Emax ImmunoAssay system kit; Promega). Colon tissues were suspended in ice-cold lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 0.1% protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem) for 30 min on ice and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 20 min. Tissue lysates were boiled for 5 min and electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE, and membranes were incubated with anti-Bax, anti-BCL2 (Santa-Cruz Biotechnology), anti-pAKT (Cell Signaling), anti-iNOS (Santa-Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-Actin (Sigma). Blots were developed using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and the ECL detection system (Pierce). A 96-well plate was coated with 80 μl/well of 5μg/ml recombinant mouse MAdCAM-1 Fc chimera (R&D Systems). For the in vitro assay, control wells were coated with 2.5% BSA (Sigma). The plate was incubated overnight at 4 °C. Then the wells were washed two times with 150–200 μl of PBS and blocked with 80 μl of 2.5% BSA for 1 h in the incubator at 37 °C. The wells were washed again two times with 150–200 μl of PBS. Next, 0.5 × 106 MLN cells/100 μl from five DSS-treated mice were seeded onto each well, and 0.1, 0.5, or 1 μg/ml AS101 was added into MAdCAM-1-coated wells. For the in vivo experiment, 0.5 × 106 MLN cells/100 μl from each group (n = 5) were seeded on the MAdCAM-1-coated wells. After 2 h, the wells were washed twice with 150–200 μl of PBS to remove the unbound cells. Then each well was loaded with 100 μl of RPMI + 50 μl of tetrazolium salt, XTT solution (Biological Industries), and the plate was incubated overnight in the incubator at 37 °C. Then the plate was read in a microplate reader (Bio-Rad) at a wavelength of 450 nm. Colonic mucosal permeability was assayed using a modification of the method described by Kitajima et al. (41Kitajima S. Takuma S. Morimoto M. Changes in colonic mucosal permeability in mouse colitis induced with dextran sulfate sodium.Exp. Anim. 1999; 48: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The mice were sacrificed, and the colon of each mouse was removed. The dissected colon was opened longitudinally and stained with 0.1 ml of 0.02% (w/v) Evans blue (Sigma) in PBS. After 120 min of exposure to Evans blue, the colon was rinsed three times in 6 mm acetylcysteine to remove any unabsorbed dye. The colon was then dried, weighed, and incubated with 1 ml of formamide for 12 h to elute the Evans blue. Colorimetric measurements of the solvent were performed in a microplate reader (Bio-Rad) at a wavelength of 655 nm, and permeability was calculated as μg of Evans blue/mg of colonic tissue based on the standard curve of Evans blue in formamide. The cells from intestinal LP were isolated as described previously (42Weigmann B. Tubbe I. Seidel D. Nicolaev A. Becker C. Neurath M.F"
https://openalex.org/W2021574248,"Endothelin-2 (EDN2), a potent vasoconstrictive peptide, is transiently produced by periovulatory follicles at the time of ovulation when corpus luteum (CL) formation begins. EDN2 induces contraction of ovarian smooth muscles ex vivo via an endothelin receptor A-mediated pathway. In this study, we aimed to determine if EDN2 is required for normal ovulation and subsequent CL formation in?vivo. In the ovaries of a mouse model that globally lacks the Edn2 gene (Edn2 knockout mouse; Edn2KO), histology showed that post-pubertal Edn2KO mice possess follicles of all developmental stages, but no corpora lutea. When exogenous gonadotropins were injected to induce super-ovulation, Edn2KO mice exhibited significantly impaired ovulation and CL formation compared to control littermates. Edn2KO ovaries that did ovulate in response to gonadotropins did not contain histologically and functionally identifiable CL. Intra-ovarian injection of EDN2 peptide results suggest partial induction of ovulation in Edn2KO mice. Endothelin receptor antagonism in wild type mice similarly disrupted ovulation, CL formation, and progesterone secretion. Overall, this study suggests that EDN2 is necessary for normal ovulation and CL formation."

https://openalex.org/W1972834989,"This study was designed to extensively characterize the skeletal muscle development in the low weight (LW) quail selected from random bred control (RBC) Japanese quail in order to provide a new avian model of impaired and delayed growth in physically normal animals. The LW line had smaller embryo and body weights than the RBC line in all age groups (P<0.05). During 3 to 42 d post-hatch, the LW line exhibited approximately 60% smaller weight of pectoralis major muscle (PM), mainly resulting from lower fiber numbers compared to the RBC line (P<0.05). During early post-hatch period when myotubes are still actively forming, the LW line showed impaired PM growth with prolonged expression of Pax7 and lower expression levels of MyoD, Myf-5, and myogenin (P<0.05), likely leading to impairment of myogenic differentiation and consequently, reduced muscle fiber formation. Additionally, the LW line had delayed transition of neonatal to adult myosin heavy chain isoform, suggesting delayed muscle maturation. This is further supported by the finding that the LW line continued to grow unlike the RBC line; difference in the percentages of PMW to body weights between both quail lines diminished with increasing age from 42 to 75 d post-hatch. This delayed muscle growth in the LW line is accompanied by higher levels of myogenin expression at 42 d (P<0.05), higher percentage of centered nuclei at 42 d (P<0.01), and greater rate of increase in fiber size between 42 and 75 d post-hatch (P<0.001) compared to the RBC line. Analysis of physiological, morphological, and developmental parameters during muscle development of the LW quail line provided a well-characterized avian model for future identification of the responsible genes and for studying mechanisms of hypoplasia and delayed muscle growth."
https://openalex.org/W1998809872,"Taking advantage of their optical transparency, we clearly observed the third stage infective juveniles (IJs) of Steinernema feltiae freezing under a cryo-stage microscope. The IJs froze when the water surrounding them froze at −2°C and below. However, they avoid inoculative freezing at −1°C, suggesting cryoprotective dehydration. Freezing was evident as a sudden darkening and cessation of IJs' movement. Freeze substitution and transmission electron microscopy confirmed that the IJs of S. feltiae freeze intracellularly. Ice crystals were found in every compartment of the body. IJs frozen at high sub-zero temperatures (−1 and −3°C) survived and had small ice crystals. Those frozen at −10°C had large ice crystals and did not survive. However, the pattern of ice formation was not well-controlled and individual nematodes frozen at −3°C had both small and large ice crystals. IJs frozen by plunging directly into liquid nitrogen had small ice crystals, but did not survive. This study thus presents the evidence that S. feltiae is only the second freeze tolerant animal, after the Antarctic nematode Panagrolaimus davidi, shown to withstand extensive intracellular freezing."

By labeling the fingers domain with ((((2-iodoacetyl)amino)ethyl)amino)naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid (IAEDANS) and the DNA substrate with Dabcyl, we are able to observe rapid fingers closing in the presence of correct dNTPs as the IAEDANS comes into contact with a Dabcyl-labeled, one-base gapped DNA. Our findings show that not only do the fingers close after binding to the correct dNTP, but that there is a second conformational change associated with a non-covalent step not previously reported for Pol β. Further analyses suggest that this conformational change corresponds to the binding of the catalytic metal into the polymerase active site. FRET studies with incorrect dNTP result in no changes in fluorescence, indicating that the fingers do not close in the presence of incorrect dNTP.

A monofunctional glycosylase generates an abasic (AP) site that is processed by apurinic/apyrimidinic AP endonuclease 1 (APE1), which nicks the sugar-phosphate backbone to generate a 3′ OH and a 5′ deoxyribose phosphate, which is removed by Pol β. Bifunctional glycosylases catalyze excision of the damaged base and AP site removal, leaving a 3′ deoxyribose phosphate and a 5′ phosphate. APE1 catalyzes removal of the 3′ deoxyribose phosphate to generate a 3′ OH. In both cases, Pol β fills in the gap and XRCC1-Ligase IIIα or Ligase I seals the remaining nick in the DNA (3Yamtich J.

Pol β plays an important role in ensuring the fidelity of DNA synthesis during repair. The 39-kDa protein is a member of the X-family of DNA polymerases and has four domains: the 8-kDa lyase, thumb, palm, and fingers domains. Whereas the other three domains are responsible for DNA binding and catalytic activity, the fingers domain (residues 262–335) forms the nucleotide binding pocket and thus plays a central role in nucleotide selection (4Prasad R.

These studies, which did not monitor FRET, suggest that there is a step prior to chemistry that is not rate-limiting for DNA synthesis by Pol β, which is likely associated with fingers closing. Many of these studies were conducted on a recessed DNA substrate, which is not the physiologically relevant substrate for Pol β (20Chagovetz A.M. Sweasy J.B. Preston B.D.

Given these limitations, we developed a FRET-based approach to monitor the movements of the fingers domain during DNA synthesis by Pol β, using a single nucleotide-gapped DNA substrate. Our results reveal that there is a rapid closing of the fingers domain in the presence of the correct nucleotide, followed by an additional and not previously identified non-covalent step that precedes chemistry and product release. The conformational changes we observe with correct dNTP incorporation are absent in the presence of the incorrect dNTP, suggesting that Pol β catalysis is different for incorporation of correct versus incorrect nucleotides.

The protein was kept at 4 °C during the labeling process. Approximately 100 μm Pol β was reduced with 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) for 45 min. The DTT was removed from the sample by gel filtration using a PD-10 desalting column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) and exchanged into Buffer C (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 150 μm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine-HCl (Thermo Scientific)) following the manufacturer's spin protocol. A 10 mm stock of IAEDANS was prepared in Buffer D (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, and 100 mm NaCl). A total of 500 μm IAEDANS solution was slowly added to 100 μm Pol β and allowed to react for 16–18 h at 4 °C. The reaction was stopped with the addition of 0.5 mm DTT and incubation for 20 min. The protein mixture was separated from free IAEDANS by a second PD-10 column (following gravity protocol) and exchanged into Buffer C. Fractions of 500 μl were collected, UV-visible analyzed at 336 and 280 nm, and concentrated to a final concentration of ∼60–100 μm. Samples were analyzed by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and stained with either Coomassie or viewed under UV light (Fig. 2, A and B). A protein preparation containing the C239S/C267S mutation was labeled in conjunction with V303C to ensure that Cys-178 was not labeled. Fig. 2, A and B, demonstrates that the thiol reaction occurred only at position 303. The labeling was determined to be greater than 89%. For simplicity, the modified, labeled WT is referred to as Pol β-AEDANS. Deoxyoligonucleotides for the one-base gapped DNA, including the Dabcyl-T modified DNA, were purchased from the Keck Oligo Synthesis Resource (Yale University) and purified by PAGE (Table 1). Deoxyoligonucleotides were annealed together to form the preferred DNA substrate of Pol β, as previously described (24Murphy D.L. Kosa J. Jaeger J. Sweasy J.B. The Asp285 variant of DNA polymerase β extends mispaired primer termini via increased nucleotide binding.Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 8048-8057Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). For consistency, nomenclature for the DNA substrates is as described by Joyce et al. (23Joyce C.M. Potapova O. Delucia A.M. Huang X. Basu V.P. Grindley N.D.

Chemical quench experiments were carried out on a RQF-3 KinTek Chemical Quench Flow apparatus. A solution of 100 nm protein and 300 nm 32P-labeled, one-base gapped DNA (Table 1) were mixed with 100 μm dCTP and 10 mm MgCl2. All mixtures contained reaction buffer E (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol) and were allowed to react for 0.2 to 3 s at 37 °C. Reactions were quenched with 0.5 m EDTA and 90% formamide sequencing dye. Radioactive products were separated on a 20% denaturing polyacrylamide gel, observed on a Storm 860 PhosphorImager, and quantified based on n and n+1 products using ImageQuant software. The data were fitted to the following biphasic burst equation using Prism 6 GraphPad software.

IAEDANS-labeled Pol β (Pol β-AEDANS) was studied on T(−8)D:3′OH (Table 1). To determine optimal single turnover conditions, various concentrations of Pol β-AEDANS (500 to 2000 nm) were reacted with 100 nm T(−8)D:3′OH and 100 μm dCTP for 0.03 to 10 s. Reactions were quenched with 0.5 m EDTA and 90% formamide sequencing dye. Radioactive products were separated on a 20% denaturing polyacrylamide gel as described above. The data were fitted to the following single exponential equation using Prism 6 GraphPad software. [Product]=A(1−e−kobst)(Eq. 2) Here, kobs is the observed rate at each concentration of enzyme. Pol β-AEDANS and radiolabeled T(−6)D:3′OH were assayed on the KinTek apparatus to determine kpol and Kd(dNTP) at 37 °C. Correct nucleotide (dCTP) was titrated from 0.5 to 200 μm over a range of 0.03 to 10 s with 500 nm Pol β and 50 nm DNA. Radioactive products were separated on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel and quantified as described above. Using Prism 6, the data were fitted to a single exponential equation, where kobs is the observed rate constant at each concentration of dNTP. The rates (kobs) are plotted against concentration of dNTP and fitted to the hyperbolic equation, kobs=kobs[dNTP]Kd(dNTP)+[dNTP](Eq. 3) kpol is the maximum rate of polymerization and Kd(dNTP) is the equilibrium dissociation constant for the incoming dNTP. The secondary structural characteristics of unlabeled Pol β, Pol β-AEDANS, and Cys-178 were analyzed by circular dichroism as previously described (24Murphy D.L. Kosa J. Jaeger J. Sweasy J.B. The Asp285 variant of DNA polymerase β extends mispaired primer termini via increased nucleotide binding.Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 8048-8057Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The ellipicity of 3 μm labeled protein solution was normalized to 3 μm unlabeled Pol β. The fluorescence of Pol β-AEDANS (600 nm) was observed at room temperature on the Photon Technology International spectrofluorometer in Buffer F (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm EDTA). The sample was excited at 336 nm and an emission scan was performed from 380 to 650 nm. The DNA substrate T(−8)D:3′H was added to the protein mixture and scanned, followed by the addition of 100 μm dCTP (correct) or 500 μm dATP (incorrect). In all experiments, the sample was excited at 336 nm, the emissions were filtered with a 400-nm filter, and the voltage was fixed at 400 V. Pol β-AEDANS was assayed along with Dabcyl-labeled DNA substrate (see figure legends for specific DNA used) in the stopped-flow SX-19 (Applied Photophysics) at 37 °C. Under single turnover conditions, 500 nm Pol β was co-incubated with 200 nm T(−8)D:3′H or 100 nm T(−8)D:3′OH in buffer E and then rapidly mixed in the stopped-flow instrument with various concentrations of dNTP as detailed in the Figure legends. In some experiments, MgCl2 was exchanged for CaCl2. Data collection began as soon as mixing occurred (pre-trigger setting). Fluorescent signal artifacts from the flow and mixing of the solutions were removed from the traces (0–0.0308 s) based on the results from standardized reactions (25Peterman B.F. Measurement of the dead time of a fluorescence stopped-flow instrument.Anal. Biochem. 1979; 93: 442-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). A logarithmic data collection of 500 time points over 10 s was evaluated for each mixing event with five traces per dNTP concentration that were averaged together. Rate constants were determined by KinTek Explorer Professional Version 3 (26Johnson K.A. Simpson Z.B. Blom T.

Simpson Z.B. Blom T. FitSpace explorer: an algorithm to evaluate multidimensional parameter space in fitting kinetic data.Anal. Biochem. 2009; 387: 30-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Raw data were imported into the program as a concentration series. The data were plotted a logarithmic time scale and plot residuals were used to ensure a precise fit. In addition, concentration series offset (addition/subtraction) was added to the simulation. The observables were noted as, a×(ED+b×EDN+c×END…)+offset_1a(Eq. 4) where the observables reflect the presence of protein [E]. The Kd(dNTP) was confirmed using the following equation, Kd(dnTP)=k−k+(Eq. 5) where k− and k+ correspond to the rate constants determined by KinTek Explorer. A nonlinear regression equation was used to initially estimate the fit of the raw stopped-flow data. In instances where the non-covalent step was absent (Fig. 8A), the analytic function f(t) = a1 × exp(−b1 × t) + c, was used. When the non-covalent step was present (Figs. 5, A and B, and 8B), the function f(t) = a1 × exp(−b1 × t) + a2 × exp(−b2 × t) + c was used. Data for extendable DNA (Fig. 7A) was estimated to a quadruple exponential equation. The data were fit by KinTek Explorer to the best possible fit and constrained by standard error and chemical quench data (Fig. 3) (26Johnson K.A. Simpson Z.B. Blom T.

Potapova O. Delucia A.M. Huang X. Basu V.P. Grindley N.D. Fingers-closing and other rapid conformational changes in DNA polymerase I (Klenow fragment) and their role in nucleotide selectivity.Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 6103-6116Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). We chose to label Pol β with the thiol reactive IAEDANS in the fingers domain, and to label the DNA template with Dabcyl. Quenching of fluorescence will occur upon finger closure, as the fingers move toward the Dabcyl in the DNA, according to crystal structures of the open binary and closed ternary complexes. Pol β contains three endogenous Cys residues at positions 178, 239, and 267; none of which would be appropriate for accurately reporting the fingers movement. An initial characterization of Pol β C239S and Pol β C267S, in which either Cys-239 or Cys-267 were altered to Ser, or of the double mutant (C239S,C267S) indicated that altering these residues to Ser would not affect the overall Pol β function (Table 2). However, alteration of Cys-178 to Ser affected activity (Table 2), and we thus elected not to alter this residue. Val-303, located on a small loop in the fingers domain, was mutated to a Cys residue that could react with the IAEDANS (Fig. 1A). The placement of the Dabcyl quencher on the DNA was carefully selected to maintain an appropriate Förster distance of about 40 Å. A Dabcyl-T was inserted eight bases downstream (−8) from the single nucleotide gap, which provided an optimal distance for observing FRET (Table 1 and Fig. 1, A and B). The variant of Pol β bearing three mutations (C239S, C267S, and V303C) termed V303C, was subcloned into a tagless pET28a expression vector and expressed in Escherichia coli. The purified protein was labeled with IAEDANS similar to previously published protocols (23Joyce C.M. Potapova O. Delucia A.M. Huang X. Basu V.P. Grindley N.D.

Analysis of a 10% SDS-PAGE gel containing samples of both the IAEDANS-treated V303C and Cys-178 protein preparations detected either by UV or Coomassie staining suggests that the thiol reaction occurs at the Cys-303 position and that Cys-178 is not labeled with IAEDANS (Fig. 2, A and B) presumably because it is buried. To further confirm protein structure, circular dichroism spectroscopy suggests labeled protein preparations retained similar secondary structure characteristics of unlabeled WT Pol β (Fig. 2C). Pol β V303C-AEDANS was assessed for pre-steady-state burst activity using the extendable T(−8)D:3′OH substrate. The burst rate observed for Pol β V303C-AEDANS (14 s−1) is similar to the burst rate of unlabeled Pol β (13 s−1) on non-labeled DNA (Fig. 3A and Table 2). This rapid rate of 14 s−1 suggests that alteration of Cys-239 and Cys-267 to Ser, as well as the labeling with IAEDANS at position 303, did not affect the overall rate of DNA synthesis catalyzed by Pol β and that the overall rate-limiting step was still product release. We also performed experiments under single turnover condition"
https://openalex.org/W2093821263,"The role of programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4) in tumor biology is context-dependent. PDCD4 is described as a tumor suppressor, but its coexpression with protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) promotes accelerated tumor growth. Here, we report that PDCD4 is methylated during nutrient deprivation. Methylation occurs because of increased stability of PDCD4 protein as well as increased activity of PRMT5 toward PDCD4. During nutrient deprivation, levels of methylated PDCD4 promote cell viability, which is dependent on an enhanced interaction with eIF4A. Upon recovery from nutrient deprivation, levels of methylated PDCD4 are regulated by phosphorylation, which controls both the localization and stability of methylated PDCD4. This study reveals that, in response to particular environmental cues, the role of PDCD4 is up-regulated and is advantageous for cell viability. These findings suggest that the methylated form of PDCD4 promotes tumor viability during nutrient deprivation, ultimately allowing the tumor to grow more aggressively."

Methods We used Medicaid claims data from 2005 to 2007 for a retrospective cohort study. We compared frequency variances of HIV treatment uptake among persons of different racial- ethnic groups using univariate and multivariate methods. The unadjusted odds ratio was estimated through multinomial logistic regression. The multinomial logistic regression model was repeated with adjustment for multiple covariates. Results Of the 23,801 Medicaid enrollees who met criteria for initiation of ARV treatment, only one third (34.6%) received ART consistent with national guideline treatment protocols, and 21.5% received some ARV medication, but with sub-optimal treatment profiles. There was no significant difference in the proportion of people who received ARV treatment between black (35.8%) and non-Hispanic whites (35.7%), but Hispanic/Latino persons (26%) were significantly less likely to receive ARV treatment. Conclusions Overall ARV treatment levels for all segments of the population are less than optimal. Among the Medicaid population there are no racial HIV treatment disparities between Black and White persons living with HIV, which suggests the potential relevance of Medicaid to currently uninsured populations, and the potential to achieve similar levels of equality within Medicaid for Hispanic/Latino enrollees and other segments of the Medicaid population."
https://openalex.org/W1971485754,"Canine distemper virus (CDV) exhibits a profound lymphotropism that causes immunosuppression and increased susceptibility of affected dogs to opportunistic infections. Similar to human measles virus, CDV is supposed to inhibit terminal differentiation of dendritic cells (DCs), responsible for disturbed repopulation of lymphoid tissues and diminished antigen presenting function in dogs. In order to testify the hypothesis that CDV-infection leads to an impairment of professional antigen presenting cells, canine DCs have been generated from peripheral blood monocytes in vitro and infected with CDV. Virus infection was confirmed and quantified by transmission electron microscopy, CDV-specific immunofluorescence, and virus titration. Flow cytometric analyses revealed a significant down-regulation of the major histocompatibility complex class II and co-stimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 in CDV-infected DCs, indicative of disturbed antigen presenting capacity. Molecular analyses revealed an increased expression of the immune inhibitory cytokine interleukin-10 in DCs following infection. Results of the present study demonstrate that CDV causes phenotypical changes and altered cytokine expression of DCs, which represent potential mechanisms to evade host immune responses and might contribute to immune dysfunction and virus persistence in canine distemper."
https://openalex.org/W1998395515,"Cardiac hypertrophy appears to be a specialized form of cellular growth that involves the proliferation control and cell cycle regulation. NIMA (never in mitosis, gene A)-related kinase-6 (Nek6) is a cell cycle regulatory gene that could induce centriole duplication, and control cell proliferation and survival. However, the exact effect of Nek6 on cardiac hypertrophy has not yet been reported. In the present study, the loss- and gain-of-function experiments were performed in Nek6 gene-deficient (Nek6−/−) mice and Nek6 overexpressing H9c2 cells to clarify whether Nek6 which promotes the cell cycle also mediates cardiac hypertrophy. Cardiac hypertrophy was induced by transthoracic aorta constriction (TAC) and then evaluated by echocardiography, pathological and molecular analyses in vivo. We got novel findings that the absence of Nek6 promoted cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis and cardiac dysfunction, which were accompanied by a significant activation of the protein kinase B (Akt) signaling in an experimental model of TAC. Consistent with this, the overexpression of Nek6 prevented hypertrophy in H9c2 cells induced by angiotonin II and inhibited Akt signaling in vitro. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that the cell cycle regulatory gene Nek6 is also a critical signaling molecule that helps prevent cardiac hypertrophy and inhibits the Akt signaling pathway."

As a result, significant variation exists in the reported results. Recently, we found that one source of variation was the use of various catalysts, and have therefore evaluated its three forms. In this paper, we characterize three substrates under near uniform reaction conditions using the most active catalytic form of the toxin. Bovine serum albumin at varying optimum concentrations stimulated enzymatic activity with all three substrates. Sodium chloride had a stimulating effect on the full length synaptosomal-associated protein of 25 kDa (SNAP25) and its 66-mer substrates but had an inhibitory effect on the 17-mer substrate. We found that under optimum conditions, full length SNAP25 was a better substrate than its shorter 66-mer or 17-mer forms both in terms of kcat, Km, and catalytic efficiency kcat/Km. Assay times greater than 15 min introduced large variations and significantly reduced the catalytic efficiency. In addition to characterizing the three substrates, our results identify potential sources of variations in previous published results, and underscore the importance of using well-defined reaction components and assay conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2124927138,"Despite the high prevalence of venous diseases that are associated with and based on the structural reorganization of the venous vessel wall, not much is known about their mechanistic causes. In this context, we demonstrated that the quantity of myocardin, a transcriptional regulator of the contractile and quiescent smooth muscle cell phenotype, was diminished in proliferating synthetic venous smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) of human and mouse varicose veins by 51 and 60%, respectively. On the basis of the relevance of proteasomal activity for such phenotypic changes, we hypothesized that the observed VSMC activation is attenuated by the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib. This drug fully abolished VSMC proliferation and loss of myocardin in perfused mouse veins and blocked VSMC invasion in collagen gels by almost 80%. In line with this, topical transdermal treatment with bortezomib diminished VSMC proliferation by 80%, rescued 90% of VSMC myocardin abundance, and inhibited varicose-like venous remodeling by 67 to 72% in a mouse model. Collectively, our data indicate that the proteasome plays a pivotal role in VSMC phenotype changes during venous remodeling processes. Its inhibition protects from varicose-like vein remodeling in mice and may thus serve as a putative therapeutic strategy to treat human varicose veins.—Pfisterer, L., Meyer, R., Feldner, A., Drews, O., Hecker, M., Korff, T.

Anti-coagulants are an extremely important class of drug, one of the most widely used types of medication, but there remains a pressing need for novel treatments, however, as present drugs such as warfarin have significant drawbacks. Nature provides a number of examples of anti-coagulant proteins produced by blood-sucking animals, which may provide templates for the development of new small molecules with similar physiological effects. We have, therefore, studied an Anopheles anti-platelet protein from a malaria vector mosquito and report its crystal structure in complex with an antibody. Overall the protein is extremely sensitive to proteolysis, but the crystal structure reveals a stable domain built from two helices and a turn, which corresponds to the functional region. The antibody raised against Anopheles anti-platelet protein prevents it from binding collagen. Our work, therefore, opens new avenues to the development of both novel small molecule anti-clotting agents and anti-malarials."

The CHK2-BRCA1 tumour suppressor pathway ensures chromosomal stability in human somatic cells.Nat. Cell Biol. 2010; 12: 492-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Thus, CHK2 depletion is associated with an abnormal SAC and chromosome mis-segregation (8Stolz A. Ertych N. Kienitz A. Vogel C. Schneider V. Fritz B. Jacob R. Dittmar G. Weichert W. Petersen I. Bastians H. The CHK2-BRCA1 tumour suppressor pathway ensures chromosomal stability in human somatic cells.Nat. Cell Biol. 2010; 12: 492-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In addition to the upstream kinase ATM, we have shown previously that CHK2 can be phosphorylated at threonine 68 and can be activated by the SAC kinase hMps1 (human Mps1) in response to DNA damage (9Wei J.H. Chou Y.F. Ou Y.H. Yeh Y.H. Tyan S.W. Sun T.P. Shen C.Y. Shieh S.Y. TTK/hMps1 participates in the regulation of DNA damage checkpoint response by phosphorylating CHK2 on Threonine 68.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7748-7757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Interestingly, CHK2 can also phosphorylate hMps1 at threonine 288 and can regulate the stability of the kinase, thus forming a positive feedback loop (10Yeh Y.H. Huang Y.F. Lin T.Y. Shieh S.Y. The cell cycle checkpoint kinase CHK2 mediates DNA damage-induced stabilization of TTK/hMps1.Oncogene. 2009; 28: 1366-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In this report, we explored the role of the CHK2-hMps1 circuitry in mitosis. We demonstrate the involvement of CHK2-mediated hMps1 Thr-288 phosphorylation in the regulation of hMps1 kinetochore localization and in the maintenance of chromosome stability during mitosis. HeLa and 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (HyClone, Logan, UT) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). Cells were treated with nocodazole (50 ng/ml) overnight for 16 to 18 h and then harvested as indicated. The HeLa Tet-Off cell lines WT-r-9 and T288A-r-16, which express siRNA-resistant WT or T288A hMps1, were grown and maintained as described previously (10Yeh Y.H. Huang Y.F. Lin T.Y. Shieh S.Y.

Cell lysates were prepared by lysing the cells in TEGN buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 400 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm DTT) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. The antibodies used were anti-actin (A2066, Sigma-Aldrich), anti-CHK2 (K0087, MBL, Nagoya, Japan), anti-hMps1 (9Wei J.H. Chou Y.F. Ou Y.H. Yeh Y.H. Tyan S.W. Sun T.P. Shen C.Y. Shieh S.Y.

For kinetochore protein immunostaining, HeLa cells grown on coverslips were extracted and fixed in 4% formaldehyde buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100, 20 mm PIPES, 10 mm EGTA, and 1 mm MgCl2 for 10 min. Cells were blocked in 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS at room temperature for 45 min and then incubated with primary antibodies for 2 h at room temperature. The antibodies used for immunofluorescence were mouse anti-HA (HA-11, Covance), rabbit anti-hMps1 (9Wei J.H. Chou Y.F. Ou Y.H. Yeh Y.H. Tyan S.W. Sun T.P. Shen C.Y. Shieh S.Y.

An FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody and a TRITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) or a DyLight 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody and a TRITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) were used as secondary antibodies. DNA was counterstained with DAPI. Images were obtained using a Carl Zeiss LSM700 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Oberkochen, Germany). Plasmids expressing hMps1 WT or T288A and the corresponding siRNA-resistant constructs have been described previously (10Yeh Y.H. Huang Y.F. Lin T.Y. Shieh S.Y. The cell cycle checkpoint kinase CHK2 mediates DNA damage-induced stabilization of TTK/hMps1.Oncogene. 2009; 28: 1366-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To generate Mis12 fusion protein, the cDNA encoding Mis12 was cloned into the BamHI site of the pXJ-HA-hMps1 vectors to express HA-tagged Mis12-hMps1. Turbofect transfection reagent (Thermo, Rockford, IL) was used to transfect HA-hMps1 and its derivatives. All siRNAs were synthesized by and purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The sequences targeted by hMps1 and CHK2 siRNA were 5′-TGAACAAAGTGAGAGACAT-3′ (TK1), and 5′-TGTGTGAATGACAACTACT-3′ (CHK2–3) or 5′-GTTGTTGGTAGTGGATCCA-3′ (CHK2–4), respectively. Transfection of siRNA was performed using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) in HeLa cells plated at 5 × 104 cells per 35-mm dish on the day before transfection. For cell cycle analysis, cells were detached using trypsin and collected in culture medium by centrifugation. Cells were fixed in cold methanol and stored at −20 °C for at least 2 h. Cells were rehydrated with cold PBS and resuspended in PBS containing 60 μg/ml propidium iodide and 50 μg/ml RNase A. Samples were analyzed using a BD FACSCanto flow cytometer (BD Biosciences), and the data were analyzed using CellQuest Pro (BD Biosciences). To determine whether Thr-288 phosphorylation is involved in the spindle checkpoint function of hMps1, we utilized the stable Tet-Off HeLa cells inducibly express the WT or the T288A mutant of hMps1; in the latter, Thr-288 has been changed to alanine (10Yeh Y.H. Huang Y.F. Lin T.Y. Shieh S.Y. The cell cycle checkpoint kinase CHK2 mediates DNA damage-induced stabilization of TTK/hMps1.Oncogene. 2009; 28: 1366-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We first down-regulated endogenous hMps1 with a specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) and then induced the expression of HA-tagged WT hMps1 or the T288A mutant by withdrawing doxycycline. Immunoblot analysis confirmed that the expression of hMps1 was regulated as expected (Fig. 1A). These cells were then subjected to nocodazole treatment, and the mitotic arrest was analyzed by flow cytometry for histone H3 Ser-10 phosphorylation (H3 pSer-10), an M phase marker. Depletion of hMps1 abrogated the SAC, as evidenced by a reduced H3 pSer-10-positive population. Reexpression of WT but not the T288A mutant effectively rescued the checkpoint arrest (Fig. 1, B and C). A dysfunctional SAC has been shown to result in polyploidy, which is linked to aneuploidy and tumorigenesis (11Fang X. Zhang P. Aneuploidy and tumorigenesis.Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2011; 22: 595-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 12Ganem N.J. Storchova Z. Pellman D. Tetraploidy, aneuploidy and cancer.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2007; 17: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). Because the T288A mutant was unable to restore the SAC (Fig. 1C), we then tested whether the ploidy of these cells would be affected after challenge with nocodazole. Consistent with the defective mitotic arrest, more of the T288A-expressing cells acquired greater than 4 n DNA content compared with the WT hMps1-expressing cells (Fig. 1D). These cells also accumulated less cyclin B and H3 pSer-10 compared with cells restored by WT hMps1 (Fig. 1E), further indicative of a failed SAC. Taken together, these results strongly suggest a role of Thr-288 phosphorylation in the proper execution of the checkpoint upon spindle disruption. Because hMps1 is involved in sensing kinetochore attachment of the spindle and consequently in chromosome alignment and segregation (2Liu X. Winey M. The MPS1 family of protein kinases.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2012; 81: 561-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), we sought to determine whether the T288A-expressing cells, shown above to be defective in mitotic arrest, exhibit any abnormality in chromosome arrangement. The MG132-arrested cells were costained with CENP-B (to identify the kinetochore) and α-tubulin (to identify the spindle) in addition to 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), which stains the condensed chromosomes. As reported previously (13Jelluma N. Brenkman A.B. van den Broek N.J. Cruijsen C.W. van Osch M.H. Lens S.M. Medema R.H. Kops G.J. Mps1 phosphorylates Borealin to control Aurora B activity and chromosome alignment.Cell. 2008; 132: 233-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), down-regulation of hMps1 increased the number of abnormal spindles and misaligned chromosomes (Fig. 2, A and B). This defect was reversed by expression of siRNA-resistant WT hMps1 but not by the T288A mutant, although both were expressed in equivalent amounts (Fig. 2C). These results confirm the importance of Thr-288 phosphorylation in normal spindle function and chromosome alignment. Human Mps1 is known to be recruited to the kinetochore when cells are exposed to a spindle poison (14Stucke V.M. Silljé H.H. Arnaud L. Nigg E.A. Human Mps1 kinase is required for the spindle assembly checkpoint but not for centrosome duplication.EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1723-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). To determine whether the abnormalities in T288A-expressing cells described above originated from defective kinetochore localization, we used confocal microscopy to compare the kinetochore localization of EGFP-hMps1 WT and EGFP-hMps1 T288A. As shown in Fig. 3A, both constructs were expressed efficiently. Whereas the EGFP-hMps1 WT protein colocalized with the kinetochore marker ACA, EGFP-hMps1 T288A was inefficient in doing so (Fig. 3B). As shown in Fig. 3C, the EGFP-hMps1 T288A mutant was ∼50% as efficient as the EGFP-hMps1 WT protein in localizing to the kinetochore in this overexpression system. The kinetochore localization of hMps1 is mediated by the N-terminal domain (residues 1–300) (15Liu S.T. Chan G.K. Hittle J.C. Fujii G. Lees E. Yen T.J. Human MPS1 kinase is required for mitotic arrest induced by the loss of CENP-E from kinetochores.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1638-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 16Stucke V.M. Baumann C. Nigg E.A. Kinetochore localization and microtubule interaction of the human spindle checkpoint kinase Mps1.Chromosoma. 2004; 113: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We next used the EGFP-hMps1 (2–301) construct to test whether Thr-288 phosphorylation is also important in the context of the minimal domain. Similar to what we observed with the full-length construct, the EGFP-hMps1 T288A (2–301) protein also exhibited impaired kinetochore localization compared with its WT counterpart (Fig. 3, D and E). This result suggests that the effect of modification at Thr-288 is independent of the kinase domain of hMps1. The impairments we observed with the T288A mutant suggested that hMps1 must be phosphorylated at Thr-288 for correct kinetochore localization. To demonstrate directly that kinetochore hMps1 is phosphorylated at Thr-288, we used a phospho-Thr-288-specific Mps1 antibody that we had raised previously in rabbits (10Yeh Y.H. Huang Y.F. Lin T.Y. Shieh S.Y. The cell cycle checkpoint kinase CHK2 mediates DNA damage-induced stabilization of TTK/hMps1.Oncogene. 2009; 28: 1366-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Confocal microscopy showed the colocalization of pThr-288 staining with BubRI, a checkpoint protein localized at the kinetochore (Fig. 3F). Down-regulation of CHK2 greatly reduced the pThr-288 staining concomitant with decreased BubRI kinetochore localization (Fig. 3F), suggesting that CHK2 acts as an hMps1 Thr-288 kinase during mitosis in addition to its action in the DNA damage response (10Yeh Y.H. Huang Y.F. Lin T.Y. Shieh S.Y. The cell cycle checkpoint kinase CHK2 mediates DNA damage-induced stabilization of TTK/hMps1.Oncogene. 2009; 28: 1366-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Spindle attachment to the kinetochore requires the KNL1-Mis12-Ndc80 (KMN) network complex, including proteins KNL-1, Mis12, and HEC1/Ndc80 (Fig. 4A). Because HEC1 is required for Mps1 kinetochore localization (17Martin-Lluesma S. Stucke V.M. Nigg E.A. Role of Hec1 in spindle checkpoint signaling and kinetochore recruitment of Mad1/Mad2.Science. 2002; 297: 2267-2270Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), we first determined whether the T288A mutation would affect the interaction with HEC1. HA-tagged WT or T288A hMps1 was coexpressed with Myc-tagged HEC1 in 293T cells, and the interactions were assessed by coimmunoprecipitation using anti-hMps1 antibody. The results in Fig. 4B show that the interaction between hMps1 and HEC1 was increased by nocodazole treatment and that the interaction was diminished significantly by T288A mutation. By contrast, interaction of hMps1 with the inner kinetochore protein CENP-B was not affected (Fig. 4C). These results suggest that the kinetochore localization defect of the T288A mutant can be attributed at least in part to reduced HEC1 interaction. If the defects observed with the T288A mutant were due to its inability to localize to the kinetochore, we would expect that forced kinetochore localization would correct these defects. We therefore generated a chimera protein with Mis12 fused to the N terminus of hMps1. As shown in Fig. 4D, the proteins expressed were of the correct size. Confocal microscopy (Fig. 4E) showed that the Mis12-hMps1 T288A protein localized to the kinetochore almost as efficiently as the Mis12-WT hMps1 protein and more efficiently than the T288A hMps1 protein (Fig. 4F), even though a similar amount of the latter was expressed (Fig. 4D). Next, we examined chromosome alignment in Mis12-hMps1 T288A-expressing cells. Cells expressing various hMps1 constructs were arrested with monastrol and then released to form bipolar spindles. Consistent with the kinetochore localization results, expression of Mis12-hMps1 T288A in hMps1-depleted cells corrected the chromosome misalignment defect, whereas the hMps1 T288A protein could not correct the defect (Fig. 4G). Similar results were obtained when lagging chromosomes were examined in anaphase (Fig. 4H). Taken together, our data strongly suggest that the mitotic checkpoint defect associated with the T288A mutant reflects its inability to localize to the kinetochore. We demonstrated previously that CHK2 phosphorylates hMps1 at Thr-288 during the DNA damage response (10Yeh Y.H. Huang Y.F. Lin T.Y. Shieh S.Y. The cell cycle checkpoint kinase CHK2 mediates DNA damage-induced stabilization of TTK/hMps1.Oncogene. 2009; 28: 1366-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Because CHK2 is activated in mitosis and upon spindle disruption (8Stolz A. Ertych N. Kienitz A. Vogel C. Schneider V. Fritz B. Jacob R. Dittmar G. Weichert W. Petersen I. Bastians H. The CHK2-BRCA1 tumour suppressor pathway ensures chromosomal stability in human somatic cells.Nat. Cell Biol. 2010; 12: 492-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), we wondered whether CHK2 is the kinase responsible for hMps1 Thr-288 phosphorylation in M phase. To address this issue, we first used specific siRNA to down-regulate endogenous CHK2 in HeLa cells. As shown in Fig. 5A, nocodazole treatment increased hMps1 Thr-288 phosphorylation, and this increase was attenuated in CHK2-depleted cells, suggesting that CHK2 is involved in Thr-288 phosphorylation in mitosis-arrested cells. Furthermore, CHK2 knockdown caused defective mitotic arrest (Fig. 5B), as demonstrated by reduced H3 pSer-10 staining (Fig. 5, B and C). Importantly, kinetochore localization of hMps1 was also reduced markedly in CHK2 knockdown cells (Fig. 5, D and E); this finding is consistent with the requirement for Thr-288 phosphorylation shown in the T288A mutant (Fig. 3, B and C). Additionally, we compared the activity of WT hMps1 and the phospho-mimicking mutant T288D in restoring the mitotic checkpoint in hMps1-depleted cells. Our data indicated that the T288D mutant was not as efficient as the WT protein, as evidenced by the levels of H3 pSer-10 (Fig. 5F). This result suggests that increased negative charge may not represent fully the impact of phosphorylation. To determine whether forced localization of hMps1 to the kinetochore could rescue the chromosome alignment defect observed in CHK2 knockdown cells, we transiently expressed Mis12, hMps1 WT, or Mis12-hMps1 WT in these cells. Neither Mis12 nor hMps1 WT could restore chromosome alignment to the level as in small interfering control cells. However, the defect in CHK2-depleted cells was partially rescued by Mis12-hMps1 fusion (Fig. 5, G and I), suggesting that CHK2 regulates the SAC at least in part through modulation of hMps1 kinetochore localization. Collectively, our data show the importance of hMps1 Thr-288 phosphorylation in hMps1 kinetochore localization, maintenance of the SAC, and chromosome segregation. Our data are consistent with a model in which, during mitosis, CHK2 phosphorylates hMps1 at Thr-288 to promote its interaction with HEC1 on the unattached kinetochore, thus facilitating its localization to the kinetochore where hMps1 activates the SAC and safeguards chromosome attachment. Failure to do so, for example, in the T288A mutant, would lead to chromosome misalignment and impaired mitotic arrest, culminating in polyploidy and genome instability (12Ganem N.J. Storchova Z. Pellman D. Tetraploidy, aneuploidy and cancer.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2007; 17: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). In addition to being a CHK2 site (10Yeh Y.H. Huang Y.F. Lin T.Y. Shieh S.Y. The cell cycle checkpoint kinase CHK2 mediates DNA damage-induced stabilization of TTK/hMps1.Oncogene. 2009; 28: 1366-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), Thr-288 was previously reported to be an hMps1 autophosphorylation site (18Xu Q. Zhu S. Wang W. Zhang X. Old W. Ahn N. Liu X. Regulation of kinetochore recruitment of two essential mitotic spindle checkpoint proteins by Mps1 phosphorylation.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 10-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We do not think that autophosphorylation is involved here because this would contradict a recent finding by Thebault et al. (19Thebault P. Chirgadze D.Y. Dou Z. Blundell T.L. Elowe S. Bolanos-Garcia V.M. Structural and functional insights into the role of the N-terminal Mps1 TPR domain in the SAC (spindle assembly checkpoint).Biochem. J. 2012; 448: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) that inhibition of hMps1 kinase activity promotes its kinetochore localization. In addition, our data with the EGFP-hMps1 (2–301) protein (Fig. 3, D and E) also suggest that the C-terminal kinase domain is dispensable for Thr-288 phosphorylation. Although the role of CHK2 was first defined as a replication checkpoint regulator in yeast (20Branzei D. Foiani M. The Rad53 signal transduction pathway: replication fork stabilization, DNA repair, and adaptation.Exp. Cell Res. 2006; 312: 2654-2659Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), its functions have since multiplied in mammals to include various DNA damage checkpoints (21Stracker T.H. Usui T. Petrini J.H. Taking the time to make important decisions: The checkpoint effector kinases Chk1 and Chk2 and the DNA damage response.DNA Repair. 2009; 8: 1047-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). More recently, its involvement in the mitotic checkpoint was unveiled. Stolz et al. (8Stolz A. Ertych N. Kienitz A. Vogel C. Schneider V. Fritz B. Jacob R. Dittmar G. Weichert W. Petersen I. Bastians H. The CHK2-BRCA1 tumour suppressor pathway ensures chromosomal stability in human somatic cells.Nat. Cell Biol. 2010; 12: 492-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) showed that CHK2 participates in maintaining chromosome stability through phosphorylation of BRCA1. Our findings here add another layer of complexity by linking CHK2 directly to the spindle checkpoint kinase hMps1, making CHK2 an essential component of the SAC machinery. Our observations that CHK2 down-regulated mitotic cells exhibited not only reduced hMps1 Thr-288 phosphorylation but also the checkpoint defects similar to those of the T288A mutant cells suggest that CHK2 likely affects hMps1 directly by phosphorylation. Additionally, our data suggest that hMps1 may not be the only effector downstream of CHK2, as forced localization of hMps1 to the kinetochore reduced but not completely rescued the chromosome misalignment defect (Fig. 5H). How CHK2 is activated in mitosis remains unclear. ATM has been shown to be activated by default or by Aurora B in mitosis (22Oricchio E. Saladino C. Iacovelli S. Soddu S. Cundari E. ATM is activated by default in mitosis, localizes at centrosomes and monitors mitotic spindle integrity.Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 23Yang C. Tang X. Guo X. Niikura Y. Kitagawa K. Cui K. Wong S.T. Fu L. Xu B. Aurora-B mediated ATM serine 1403 phosphorylation is required for mitotic ATM activation and the spindle checkpoint.Mol. Cell. 2011; 44: 597-608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and therefore might phosphorylate and activate CHK2. Alternatively, hMps1 itself may act as the CHK2 activator in mitotic cells, as we have shown previously that hMps1 can phosphorylate and activate CHK2 (9Wei J.H. Chou Y.F. Ou Y.H. Yeh Y.H. Tyan S.W. Sun T.P. Shen C.Y. Shieh S.Y. TTK/hMps1 participates in the regulation of DNA damage checkpoint response by phosphorylating CHK2 on Threonine 68.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7748-7757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In this scenario, initial activation of hMps1 may drive the activation of CHK2, which in turn reinforces and stabilizes hMps1 function by phosphorylating the kinase on Thr-288. Much work is needed to test this autoregulatory circuitry and its relationship with other regulators such as Aurora B, which is known to also affect hMps1 kinetochore localization."
https://openalex.org/W2133850865,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common cancer associated with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Conventional interferon-α (IFN-α) and pegylated IFNs (PEG-IFNs) approved for chronic HBV infection treatment can reduce the risk of HCC but are not suitable for the majority of patients and cause significant side effects. IFN-λ1 is a type III IFN with antiviral, antiproliferative, and immunomodulatory functions similar to type I IFNs but with fewer side effects. However, the tolerability and antitumor activity of PEG-IFN-λ1 in HCC xenograft mice are unknown. In vitro IFN-λ1 treatment of Hep3B and Huh7 human hepatoma cell lines increased MHC class I expression, activated JAK-STAT signaling pathways, induced IFN-stimulated gene expression, and inhibited hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) expression. IFN-λ1 treatment also caused 23.2 and 19.9% growth inhibition of Hep3B and Huh7 cells, respectively, and promoted cellular apoptosis. PEG-IFN-λ1, but not IFN-λ1 treatment, significantly suppressed tumor growth (P= 0.002) and induced tumor cell apoptosis in a Hep3B cell xenograft mouse model without significant weight loss or toxicity. PEG-IFN-λ1 also significantly inhibited (P= 0.000) serum HBsAg secretion from Hep3B xenograft tumors in vivo. Thus, PEG-IFN-λ1 can suppress Hep3B xenograft tumor growth and inhibit HBsAg production and may be a potential treatment for HBV-related HCC.—Tian, S., Hui, X., Fan, Z., Li, Q., Zhang, J., Yang, X., Ma, X., Huang, B., Chen, D., Chen, H.

https://openalex.org/W2001171563,"Expression of the breast cancer metastasis suppressor 1 (BRMS1) protein is dramatically reduced in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells and in primary human tumors. Although BRMS1 is a known suppressor of metastasis, the mechanisms through which BRMS1 functions to regulate cell migration and invasion in response to specific NSCLC driver mutations are poorly understood. To experimentally address this, we utilized immortalized human bronchial epithelial cells in which p53 was knocked down in the presence of oncogenic K-RasV12 (HBEC3-p53KD-K-RasV12). These genetic alterations are commonly found in NSCLC and are associated with a poor prognosis. To determine the importance of BRMS1 for cytoskeletal function, cell migration and invasion in our model system we stably knocked down BRMS1. Here, we report that loss of BRMS1 in HBEC3-p53KD-K-RasV12 cells results in a dramatic increase in cell migration and invasion compared to controls that expressed BRMS1. Moreover, the loss of BRMS1 resulted in additional morphological changes including F-actin re-distribution, paxillin accumulation at the leading edge of the lamellapodium, and cellular shape changes resembling mesenchymal phenotypes. Importantly, re-expression of BRMS1 restores, in part, cell migration and invasion; however it does not fully reestablish the epithelial phenotype. These finding suggests that loss of BRMS1 results in a permanent, largely irreversible, mesenchymal phenotype associated with increased cell migration and invasion. Collectively, in NSCLC cells without p53 and expression of oncogenic K-Ras our study identifies BRMS1 as a key regulator required to maintain a cellular morphology and cytoskeletal architecture consistent with an epithelial phenotype."
