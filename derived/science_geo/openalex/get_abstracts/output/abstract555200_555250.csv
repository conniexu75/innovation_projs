https://openalex.org/W2294707565,"Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) is used extensively worldwide in plastic products, and its accumulation in the environment has become a global concern. Because the ability to enzymatically degrade PET has been thought to be limited to a few fungal species, biodegradation is not yet a viable remediation or recycling strategy. By screening natural microbial communities exposed to PET in the environment, we isolated a novel bacterium, Ideonella sakaiensis 201-F6, that is able to use PET as its major energy and carbon source. When grown on PET, this strain produces two enzymes capable of hydrolyzing PET and the reaction intermediate, mono(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalic acid. Both enzymes are required to enzymatically convert PET efficiently into its two environmentally benign monomers, terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol."

Whether and how oncogenes contribute to this process are not well understood. In a study of mice, Casey et al. found that the MYC oncogene, which is aberrantly activated in many human cancers, up-regulates the expression of genes encoding proteins that dampen the antitumor response. These include two proteins that are often overexpressed on tumor cells and that serve as immune checkpoints. One of them (PDL1) sends to the immune system a “don't find me” signal, and the other (CD47) sends a “don't eat me” signal. Thus, therapies aimed at suppressing MYC may help promote an immune response against tumors. Science , this issue p. 227"
https://openalex.org/W2297307165,"How the bacterial pilus works Many bacteria, including important pathogens, move by projecting grappling-hook–like extensions called type IV pili from their cell bodies. After these pili attach to other cells or objects in their environment, the bacteria retract the pili to pull themselves forward. Chang et al. used electron cryotomography of intact cells to image the protein machines that extend and retract the pili, revealing where each protein component resides. Putting the known structures of the individual proteins in place like pieces of a three-dimensional puzzle revealed insights into how the machine works, including evidence that ATP hydrolysis by cytoplasmic motors rotates a membrane-embedded adaptor that slips pilin subunits back and forth from the membrane onto the pilus.

https://openalex.org/W2325510615,"Between 1999 and 2006, a plateau interrupted the otherwise continuous increase of atmospheric methane concentration [CH4] since preindustrial times. Causes could be sink variability or a temporary reduction in industrial or climate-sensitive sources. We reconstructed the global history of [CH4] and its stable carbon isotopes from ice cores, archived air, and a global network of monitoring stations. A box-model analysis suggests that diminishing thermogenic emissions, probably from the fossil-fuel industry, and/or variations in the hydroxyl CH4 sink caused the [CH4] plateau. Thermogenic emissions did not resume to cause the renewed [CH4] rise after 2006, which contradicts emission inventories. Post-2006 source increases are predominantly biogenic, outside the Arctic, and arguably more consistent with agriculture than wetlands. If so, mitigating CH4 emissions must be balanced with the need for food production."
https://openalex.org/W2292973084,"Faulty channels, not faulty synapses SHANK3 is a widely expressed scaffolding protein that is enriched in postsynaptic specializations. In mutant mice, SHANK3 mutations cause autism-like behavioral changes and exhibit alterations in synaptic transmission. Yi et al. produced human neurons lacking SHANK3 but not other genes that are also involved in the autism-like disease Phelan-McDermid syndrome. Instead of affecting synapses, SHANK3 mutations primarily caused a channelopathy, with the major phenotype consisting of a specific impairment of HCN channels. Chronic impairment of membrane currents through channelopathy could account for the phenotypes observed in Phelan-McDermid neurons, such as alterations in cognitive functions and the predisposition to epilepsy.

https://openalex.org/W2293026832,"Stochastic properties of phage promoter Full understanding of regulated gene expression requires characterization of stochastic variation in the activity of individual promoters. To avoid cell-to-cell variability and variation between the activity of specific gene copies, Sepúlveda et al. investigated the behavior of the lysogeny maintenance promoter of phage lambda in individual Escherichia coli cells. They measured the concentration of transcription factor and the actual number of mRNAs produced, and used mathematical modeling to discern the stochastic activity of the regulated promoter. The promoter underwent switching between configurations that occurred more rapidly than the lifetime of mRNA molecules produced, and individual copies of the same gene functioned independently in the same cell. Such studies can reveal new aspects of systems that have been well studied by more conventional techniques. Science , this issue p. 1218"
https://openalex.org/W2294864820,"Heavy metals such as cadmium, arsenic and nickel are classified as carcinogens. Although the precise mechanism of carcinogenesis is undefined, heavy metal exposure can contribute to genetic damage by inducing double strand breaks (DSBs) as well as inhibiting critical proteins from different DNA repair pathways. Here we take advantage of two previously published culture assay systems developed to address mechanistic aspects of DNA repair to evaluate the effects of heavy metal exposures on competing DNA repair outcomes. Our results demonstrate that exposure to heavy metals significantly alters how cells repair double strand breaks. The effects observed are both specific to the particular metal and dose dependent. Low doses of NiCl2 favored resolution of DSBs through homologous recombination (HR) and single strand annealing (SSA), which were inhibited by higher NiCl2 doses. In contrast, cells exposed to arsenic trioxide preferentially repaired using the error prone non-homologous end joining (alt-NHEJ) while inhibiting repair by HR. In addition, we determined that low doses of nickel and cadmium contributed to an increase in mutagenic recombination-mediated by Alu elements, the most numerous family of repetitive elements in humans. Sequence verification confirmed that the majority of the genetic deletions were the result of Alu-mediated non-allelic recombination events that predominantly arose from repair by SSA. All heavy metals showed a shift in the outcomes of alt-NHEJ repair with a significant increase of non-templated sequence insertions at the DSB repair site. Our data suggest that exposure to heavy metals will alter the choice of DNA repair pathway changing the genetic outcome of DSBs repair."

https://openalex.org/W2293739757,"Chemoenzymatic synthesis is emerging as a promising approach to the synthesis of homogeneous glycopeptides and glycoproteins highly demanded for functional glycomics studies, but its generality relies on the availability of a range of enzymes with high catalytic efficiency and well defined substrate specificity. We describe in this paper the discovery of glycosynthase mutants derived from Elizabethkingia meningoseptica endoglycosidase F3 (Endo-F3) of the GH18 family, which are devoid of the inherent hydrolytic activity but are able to take glycan oxazolines for transglycosylation. Notably, the Endo-F3 D165A and D165Q mutants demonstrated high acceptorsubstrate specificity toward α1,6-fucosyl-GlcNAc-Asn or α1,6-fucosyl-GlcNAc-polypeptide in transglycosylation, enabling a highly convergent synthesis of core-fucosylated, complex CD52 glycopeptide antigen. The Endo-F3 mutants were able to use both bi- and triantennary glycan oxazolines as substrates for transglycosylation, in contrast to previously reported endoglycosidases derived from Endo-S, Endo-M, Endo-D, and Endo-A mutants that could not recognize triantennary N-glycans. Using rituximab as a model system, we have further demonstrated that the Endo-F3 mutants are highly efficient for glycosylation remodeling of monoclonal antibodies to produce homogeneous intact antibody glycoforms. Interestingly, the new triantennary glycan glycoform of antibody showed much higher affinity for galectin-3 than that of the commercial antibody. The Endo-F3 mutants represent the first endoglycosidase-based glycosynthases capable of transferring triantennary complex N-glycans, which would be very useful for glycoprotein synthesis and glycosylation remodeling of antibodies."

Chen et al. found that the timing of a radiation treatment of human breast cancer–derived cells in culture determined whether cell survival was enhanced or reduced. Depletion of the oncogene product MDMX caused an initial burst of expression of the tumor suppressor protein p53 within the first 24 hours, and then oscillations of lower amplitude. When the radiation treatment coincided with the first phase, 95% of the cells died, but if radiation was applied in the second phase, fewer than 20% of the cells died. Science , this issue p. 1204"
https://openalex.org/W2385963202,"N-Glycosylation is a post-translational modification common to all three domains of life. In many archaea, the oligosacharyltransferase (AglB)-dependent N-glycosylation of flagellins is required for flagella assembly. However, whether N-glycosylation is required for the assembly and/or function of the structurally related archaeal type IV pili is unknown. Here, we show that of six Haloferax volcanii adhesion pilins, PilA1 and PilA2, the most abundant pilins in pili of wild-type and ΔaglB strains, are modified under planktonic conditions in an AglB-dependent manner by the same pentasaccharide detected on H. volcanii flagellins. However, unlike wild-type cells, which have surfaces decorated with discrete pili and form a dispersed layer of cells on a plastic surface, ΔaglB cells have thick pili bundles and form microcolonies. Moreover, expressing PilA1, PilA2, or PilA6 in ΔpilA[1–6]ΔaglB stimulates microcolony formation compared with their expression in ΔpilA[1–6]. Conversely, expressing PilA3 or PilA4 in ΔpilA[1–6] cells results in strong surface adhesion, but not microcolony formation, and neither pilin stimulates surface adhesion in ΔpilA[1–6]ΔaglB cells. Although PilA4 assembles into pili in the ΔpilA[1–6]ΔaglB cells, these pili are, unlike wild-type pili, curled, perhaps rendering them non-functional. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a differential effect of glycosylation on pilus assembly and function of paralogous pilins. The growth of wild-type cells in low salt media, a condition that decreases AglB glycosylation, also stimulates microcolony formation and inhibits motility, supporting our hypothesis that N-glycosylation plays an important role in regulating the transition between planktonic to sessile cell states as a response to stress.

https://openalex.org/W2293722879,"To evaluate the feasibility to detect activated brown adipose tissue (BAT) using single-time-point infrared thermography of the supraclavicular skin region under thermoneutral conditions. To this end, infrared thermography was compared with 18-F-FDG PET, the current reference standard for the detection of activated BAT.120 patients were enrolled in this study. After exclusion of 18 patients, 102 patients (44 female, 58 male, mean age 58±17 years) were included for final analysis. All patients underwent a clinically indicated 18F-FDG-PET/CT examination. Immediately prior to tracer injection skin temperatures of the supraclavicular, presternal and jugular regions were measured using spatially resolved infrared thermography at room temperature. The presence of activated BAT was determined in PET by typical FDG uptake within the supraclavicular adipose tissue compartments. Local thickness of supraclavicular subcutaneous adipose tissue (SCAT) was measured on CT. Measured skin temperatures were statistically correlated with the presence of activated BAT and anthropometric data.Activated BAT was detected in 9 of 102 patients (8.8%). Local skin temperature of the supraclavicular region was significantly higher in individuals with active BAT compared to individuals without active BAT. However, after statistical correction for the influence of BMI, no predictive value of activated BAT on skin temperature of the supraclavicular region could be observed. Supraclavicular skin temperature was significantly negatively correlated with supraclavicular SCAT thickness.We conclude that supraclavicular SCAT thickness influences supraclavicular skin temperature and thus makes a specific detection of activated BAT using single-time-point thermography difficult. Further studies are necessary to evaluate the possibility of BAT detection using alternative thermographic methods, e.g. dynamic thermography or MR-based thermometry taking into account BMI as a confounding factor."

Groups I and II, were orally treated with distilled water {3.0 ml/kg body weight (BW)} and naringin (50 mg/kg BW), respectively. Groups III, IV, V and VI were rendered diabetic by a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (60 mg/kg, BW) and were similarly treated with subcutaneous insulin (8.0 I.U/kg BW, twice daily), naringin (50 mg/kg BW), distilled water (3.0 ml/Kg BW) and ramipril (3.0 mg/kg/BW), respectively. The animals were sacrificed after 56 days by halothane overdose; blood and heart samples removed for further analysis.The untreated diabetic rats exhibited significantly increased oxidative stress, NADPH oxidase activity, increased cardiac fibrosis, PKC-β and p38 mitogen activated protein kinase expression compared to controls.

https://openalex.org/W2293029604,"Bacterial infections can quickly turn into sepsis, with its attendant clinical sequelae of inflammation, tissue injury, and organ failure. Paradoxically, sustained inflammation in sepsis may lead to immune suppression, because of which the host is unable to clear the existing infection. Use of agents that suppress the inflammatory response may accelerate host immune suppression, whereas use of traditional antibiotics does not significantly affect inflammation. In this study, we investigated whether lipoxin A4 (LXA4), a specialized, proresolution lipid mediator, could increase neutrophil phagocytic activity as well as reduce bacterial virulence. Using the mouse cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) model of sepsis, the administration of LXA4 (7 μg/kg i.v.) 1 h after surgery increased neutrophil phagocytic ability and Fcγ receptor I (CD64) expression. Ex vivo studies have confirmed that the direct addition of LXA4 to CLP neutrophils increased phagocytic ability but not CD64 expression. LXA4 did not affect neutrophils taken from control mice in which CD64 expression was minimal. Taken together with in vivo data, these results suggest that LXA4 directly augments CD64-mediated neutrophil phagocytic ability but does not directly increase neutrophil CD64 expression. Bacterial communication and virulence is regulated by quorum sensing inducers. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, virulence is induced with release of various virulence factors, by N-3-oxododecanolyl homoserine lactone binding to the quorum sensing receptor, LasR. We show that LXA4 is an inhibitor of LasR in P. aeruginosa and that it decreases the release of pyocyanin exotoxin. These results suggest that LXA4 has the novel dual properties of increasing host defense and decreasing pathogen virulence by inhibiting quorum sensing.-Wu, B., Capilato, J., Pham, M. P., Walker, J., Spur, B., Rodriguez, A., Perez, L. J., Yin, K. Lipoxin A4 augments host defense in sepsis and reduces Pseudomonas aeruginosa virulence through quorum sensing inhibition."

We aimed to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a universal opt-out HIV, Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C testing programme for Emergency Department patients and to describe the incidence and prevalence of blood-borne viruses in this population. Methods An opt-out ED blood borne virus screening programme was piloted from March 2014 to January 2015. Patients undergoing blood sampling during routine clinical care were offered HIV 1&2 antibody/antigen assay, HBV surface antigen and HCV antibody tests. Linkage to care where necessary was co-ordinated by the study team. New diagnosis and prevalence rates were defined as the new cases per 1000 tested and number of positive tests per 1000 tested respectively. Results Over 45 weeks of testing, of 10,000 patient visits, 8,839 individual patient samples were available for analysis following removal of duplicates. A sustained target uptake of >50% was obtained after week 3. 97(1.09%), 44(0.49%) and 447(5.05%) HIV, Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C tests were positive respectively. Of these, 7(0.08%), 20(0.22%) and 58(0.66%) were new diagnoses of HIV, Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C respectively. The new diagnosis rate for HIV, Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C was 0.8, 2.26 and 6.5 per 1000 and study prevalence for HIV, Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C was 11.0, 5.0 and 50.5 per 1000 respectively. Conclusions Opt-out blood borne viral screening was feasible and acceptable in an inner-city ED. Blood borne viral infections were prevalent in this population and newly diagnosed cases were diagnosed and linked to care. These results suggest widespread blood borne viral testing in differing clinical locations with differing population demographic risks may be warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2293178353,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small RNAs that regulate the expression of target mRNAs by specific binding on the mRNA 3'UTR and promoting mRNA degradation in the majority of cases. It is often of interest to know the specific targets of a miRNA in order to study them in a particular disease context. In that sense, some databases have been designed to predict potential miRNA-mRNA interactions based on hybridization sequences. However, one of the main limitations is that these databases have too many false positives and do not take into account disease-specific interactions. We have developed an R package (miRComb) able to combine miRNA and mRNA expression data with hybridization information, in order to find potential miRNA-mRNA targets that are more reliable to occur in a specific physiological or disease context. This article summarizes the pipeline and the main outputs of this package by using as example TCGA data from five gastrointestinal cancers (colon cancer, rectal cancer, liver cancer, stomach cancer and esophageal cancer). The obtained results can be used to develop a huge number of testable hypotheses by other authors. Globally, we show that the miRComb package is a useful tool to deal with miRNA and mRNA expression data, that helps to filter the high amount of miRNA-mRNA interactions obtained from the pre-existing miRNA target prediction databases and it presents the results in a standardised way (pdf report). Moreover, an integrative analysis of the miRComb miRNA-mRNA interactions from the five digestive cancers is presented. Therefore, miRComb is a very useful tool to start understanding miRNA gene regulation in a specific context. The package can be downloaded in http://mircomb.sourceforge.net."

Psoriasis is associated with multiple comorbidities including autoimmune disease, neurological disorders, cardiometabolic diseases and inflammatory-bowel disease. An integrated system biology approach is utilized to decipher the molecular alliance of psoriasis with its comorbidities. An unbiased integrative network medicine methodology is adopted for the investigation of diseasome, biological process and pathways of five most common psoriasis associated comorbidities. A significant overlap was observed between genes acting in similar direction in psoriasis and its comorbidities proving the mandatory occurrence of either one of its comorbidities. The biological processes involved in inflammatory response and cell signaling formed a common basis between psoriasis and its associated comorbidities. The pathway analysis revealed the presence of few common pathways such as angiogenesis and few uncommon pathways which includes CCKR signaling map and gonadotrophin-realising hormone receptor pathway overlapping in all the comorbidities. The work shed light on few common genes and pathways that were previously overlooked. These fruitful targets may serve as a starting point for diagnosis and/or treatment of psoriasis comorbidities.

https://openalex.org/W2294552243,"Background Despite an increased awareness of shared decision-making (SDM) and its prominent position on the health policy agenda, its implementation in routine care remains a challenge in Germany. In order to overcome this challenge, it is important to understand healthcare providers’ views regarding SDM and to take their perspectives and opinions into account in the development of an implementation program. The present study aimed at exploring a) the attitudes of different healthcare providers regarding SDM in oncology and b) their experiences with treatment decisions in daily practice. Material and Methods A qualitative study was conducted using focus groups and individual interviews with different healthcare providers at the University Cancer Center Hamburg, Germany. Focus groups and interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed and analyzed using conventional content analysis and descriptive statistics. Results N = 4 focus groups with a total of N = 25 participants and N = 17 individual interviews were conducted. Attitudes regarding SDM varied greatly between the different participants, especially concerning the definition of SDM, the attitude towards the degree of patient involvement in decision-making and assumptions about when SDM should take place. Experiences on how treatment decisions are currently made varied. Negative experiences included time and structural constraints, and a lack of (multidisciplinary) communication. Positive experiences comprised informed patients, involvement of relatives and a good physician-patient relationship. Conclusion The results show that German healthcare providers in oncology have a range of attitudes that currently function as barriers towards the implementation of SDM. Also, their experiences on how decision-making is currently done reveal difficulties in actively involving patients in decision-making processes. It will be crucial to take these attitudes and experiences seriously and to subsequently disentangle existing misconceptions in future implementation programs."

We conducted multivariate logistic regressions to examine the effects of mobility combined with the interaction between mobility and migration status on STIs and sexual risk behaviors, when controlling for risk environment characteristics. Results Mobility was associated with increased risk for biologically-confirmed STIs, sex trading, and unprotected sex among non-migrants, but not among internal or external migrants. Condom use rates were low among all three groups, particularly external migrants. Risk environment factors of low-income status, debt, homelessness, and limited access to medical care were associated with unprotected sex among external migrants.

Failures to eliminate wild-type copies of furA gene from the polyploid genome suggest essential functions. In the present study, we developed a selectively regulated furA expression system by the replacement of furA promoter in the Anabaena sp. chromosomes with the Co2+/Zn2+ inducible coaT promoter from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. By removing Co2+ and Zn2+ from the medium and shutting off furA expression, we showed that FurA was absolutely required for cyanobacterial growth. RNA-seq based comparative transcriptome analyses of the furA-turning off strain and its parental wild-type in conjunction with subsequent electrophoretic mobility shift assays and semi-quantitative RT-PCR were carried out in order to identify direct transcriptional targets and unravel new biological roles of FurA. The results of such approaches led us to identify 15 novel direct iron-dependent transcriptional targets belonging to different functional categories including detoxification and defences against oxidative stress, phycobilisome degradation, chlorophyll catabolism and programmed cell death, light sensing and response, heterocyst differentiation, exopolysaccharide biosynthesis, among others.

Here we have determined its distribution in prostate cancer tissue and its role in prostate tumorigenesis using in vitro and in vivo assays. Data-mining studies strongly suggest that 12-HETER1 expression positively correlates with the aggressiveness and progression of prostate tumors. This was corroborated with real-time PCR analysis of human prostate tumor tissue arrays that revealed the expression of 12-HETER1 positively correlates with the clinical stages of prostate cancers and Gleason scores. Immunohistochemistry analysis also proved that the expression of 12-HETER1 is positively correlated with the grades of prostate cancer. Knockdown of 12-HETER1 in prostate cancer cells markedly reduced colony formation and inhibited tumor growth in animals. To discover the regulatory factors, 5 candidate 12-HETER1 promoter cis elements were assayed as luciferase reporter fusions in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, where the putative cis element required for gene regulation was mapped 2 kb upstream of the 12-HETER1 transcriptional start site.

MR imaging and neurocognitive tests were performed in patients within 7 days of injury. White matter integrity was examined by using diffusion tensor imaging. We used three approaches, tract-based spatial statistics, graphical-model-based multivariate analysis, and region-of-interest analysis, to detect altered cerebellar white matter integrity in mild traumatic brain injury patients. Results Results from three analysis methods were in accordance with each other, and suggested fractional anisotropy in the middle cerebellar peduncle and the pontine crossing tract was changed in the acute-phase mild traumatic brain injury patients, relative to controls (adjusted p-value < 0.05). Higher fractional anisotropy in the middle cerebellar peduncle was associated with worse performance in the fluid cognition composite (r = -0.289, p-value = 0.037).

The purpose of this study was to discover an alternative lymph node staging system for gastric cancer. Data from 6025 patients who underwent gastrectomy for primary gastric cancer between January 2000 and December 2010 were reviewed. The lymph node groups were reclassified into lesser-curvature, greater-curvature, and extra-perigastric groups. Presence of any metastatic lymph node in one group was considered positive. Lymph node groups were further stratified into four (new N0-new N3) according to the number of positive lymph node groups. Survival outcomes with this new N staging were compared with those of the current TNM system. For validation, two centers in Japan (large center, n = 3443; medium center, n = 560) were invited. Even among the same pN stages, the more advanced new N stage showed worse prognosis, indicating that the anatomical extent of metastatic lymph nodes is important. The prognostic performance of the new staging system was as good as that of the current TNM system for overall advanced gastric cancer as well as lymph node-positive gastric cancer (Harrell C-index was 0.799, 0.726, and 0.703 in current TNM and 0.799, 0.727, and 0.703 in new TNM stage). Validation sets supported these outcomes. The new N staging system demonstrated prognostic performance equal to that of the current TNM system and could thus be used as an alternative."
https://openalex.org/W2325675341,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked recessive disease caused by mutations in the gene encoding dystrophin. Loss of dystrophin protein compromises the stability of the sarcolemma membrane surrounding each muscle cell fiber, leading to membrane ruptures and leakiness that induces myofiber necrosis, a subsequent inflammatory response, and progressive tissue fibrosis with loss of functional capacity. Cathepsin S (Ctss) is a cysteine protease that is actively secreted in areas of tissue injury and ongoing inflammation, where it participates in extracellular matrix remodeling and healing. Here we show significant induction of Ctss expression and proteolytic activity following acute muscle injury or in muscle from mdx mice, a model of DMD. To examine the functional ramifications associated with greater Ctss expression, the Ctss gene was deleted in the mdx genetic background, resulting in protection from muscular dystrophy pathogenesis that included reduced myofiber turnover and histopathology, reduced fibrosis, and improved running capacity. Mechanistically, deletion of the Ctss gene in the mdx background significantly increased myofiber sarcolemmal membrane stability with greater expression and membrane localization of utrophin, integrins, and β-dystroglycan, which anchor the membrane to the basal lamina and underlying cytoskeletal proteins. Consistent with these results, skeletal muscle-specific transgenic mice overexpressing Ctss showed increased myofiber necrosis, muscle histopathology, and a functional deficit reminiscent of muscular dystrophy. Hence, Ctss induction during muscular dystrophy is a pathologic event that partially underlies disease pathogenesis, and its inhibition might serve as a new therapeutic strategy in DMD.

Determinants of the incidence of Duchenne muscular dystrophy.Ann. Transl. Med. 2015; 3: 287PubMed Google Scholar). DMD pathogenesis is characterized by the appearance of muscle weakness and fatigue in juveniles that progresses to muscle-based paralysis in young adult patients, with eventual death because of respiratory failure or cardiomyopathy (2.Bushby K.

Dystrophin is a component of the membrane-anchored dystrophin-glycoprotein complex, whose primary function is to anchor the intracellular cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix (ECM), thus providing structural support to the sarcolemma (4.Gumerson J.D.

McNally E.M. The dystrophin glycoprotein complex: signaling strength and integrity for the sarcolemma.Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 1023-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Loss of dystrophin protein results in destabilization of the greater dystrophin-glycoprotein complex and sarcolemmal fragility that leads to the unrestrained influx of calcium, causing myofiber necrosis and the induction of tissue inflammation, fibrosis, and a progressive loss of muscle contractile performance (4.Gumerson J.D.

Currently there is no cure for DMD, and although gene therapy to restore dystrophin expression is a promising concept, it remains in the distant future (6.Wein N. Alfano L. Flanigan K.M.

Thus, it will be critical to develop novel pharmacologic therapies that address key aspects of disease pathogenesis, such as increased protease activity (7.Hollinger K. Selsby J.T.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy extracellular matrix Cathepsin S transgenic non-transgenic barium chloride Evans blue dye tibialis anterior creatine kinase N-morpholinourea-leucine-homophenylalanine-vinyl-sulfonephenol. Cathepsin S (Ctss) belongs to the family of lysosomal cysteine proteases. Ctss was first identified in macrophages and dendritic cells as a major endoprotease cleaving the invariant chain from the major histocompatibility class II complex prior to antigen presentation (9.Shi G.P.

Developmental regulation of invariant chain proteolysis controls MHC class II trafficking in mouse dendritic cells.Cell. 1998; 93: 1135-1145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Genetic deletion of the Ctss gene in the mouse does not affect viability, although these animals have altered antigen processing that causes a mild immune-compromised phenotype (9.Shi G.P. Villadangos J.A. Dranoff G. Small C. Gu L. Haley K.J. Riese R. Ploegh H.L. Chapman H.A. Cathepsin S required for normal MHC class II peptide loading and germinal center development.Immunity. 1999; 10: 197-206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to its role in antigen processing, Ctss can remodel the ECM in various tissues when secreted. Unlike others acidic lysosomal proteases, Ctss remains catalytically active and stable in a neutral pH environment, allowing for its proteolytic activity when secreted. Collagen, elastin, and fibronectin are some of the ECM proteins cleaved by Ctss (12.Conus S. Simon H.U. Cathepsins and their involvement in immune responses.Swiss Med. Wkly. 2010; 140: w13042PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Bromme D. Wilson S. Extracellular Matrix Degradation.in: Parks W.C. Mecham R.P. 1st ed. Springer, Berlin2011Google Scholar). Numerous studies have demonstrated that increased activity of select proteases in the skeletal muscle of mouse models of muscular dystrophy, such as the calpains and matrix metalloproteinases, contributes to tissue histopathology (7.Hollinger K. Selsby J.T. The physiological response of protease inhibition in dystrophic muscle.Acta Physiol. (Oxf.). 2013; 208: 234-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 14.Li H. Mittal A.

Genet. 2009; 18: 2584-2598Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). For example, genetic inhibition of a broad class of serine proteases achieved by overexpressing the inhibitor Serpina3n in skeletal muscle attenuated dystrophic disease in two mouse models of muscular dystrophy (15.Tjondrokoesoemo A. Schips T. Kanisicak O. Sargent M.A. Molkentin J.D. Genetic overexpression of Serpina3n attenuates muscular dystrophy in mice.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2016; 25: 1192-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Furthermore, skeletal muscle function in various muscular dystrophy models was improved following application of broad serine protease inhibitors or antifibrotic drugs known to modulate matrix metalloproteinase activity (14.Li H. Mittal A. Makonchuk D.Y. Bhatnagar S. Kumar A. Matrix metalloproteinase-9 inhibition ameliorates pathogenesis and improves skeletal muscle regeneration in muscular dystrophy.Hum. Mol.

Bowman-Birk inhibitor attenuates dystrophic pathology in mdx mice.J. Appl. Physiol. 2010; 109: 1492-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Such studies led us to examine proteases that are both induced in dystrophic skeletal muscle and amenable to pharmacologic inhibition, which might represent a new therapeutic approach in DMD. One of these proteases, Ctss, was previously identified as an mRNA species up-regulated in both muscle from DMD patients and mdx mice, although the functional effects of this increase were not investigated (17.Baron D. Magot A. Ramstein G. Steenman M. Fayet G. Chevalier C. Jourdon P. Houlgatte R. Savagner F. Pereon Y. Immune response and mitochondrial metabolism are commonly deregulated in DMD and aging skeletal muscle.PloS ONE. 2011; 6: e26952Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 18.Fang J. Shi G.P.

Muscle genome-wide expression profiling during disease evolution in mdx mice.Physiol. Genomics. 2009; 37: 119-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Here we observed that Ctss expression and activity are up-regulated in the skeletal muscle of mdx mice. Deletion of the Ctss gene in the mdx background resulted in healthier skeletal muscle with reduced myofiber degeneration and fibrosis and improved running performance. Mechanistically, loss of Ctss in mdx mice stabilized membrane adhesion complexes and levels of associated proteins, such as utrophin, β-dystroglycan, and the integrins, thereby increasing sarcolemma membrane stability and protection from injury. We also generated a skeletal muscle-specific transgenic mouse overexpressing Ctss (Ctss TG). These mice had greater muscle Ctss proteolytic activity that was associated with induction of muscle histopathology reminiscent of muscular dystrophy. Hence, increased Ctss expression and activity in skeletal muscle is detrimental to DMD pathology, and its inhibition represents a novel therapeutic vantage point for this disease. All animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (protocol IACUC2013-0013). The exact number of mice used is given in the figure legends or within the figures, and the numbers used reflect the minimum needed to achieve statistical significance (see “Statistics”). Animals used in the study were not randomized or handled in a blinded manner because this was not commensurate with the experimental design. No data collected from animals were excluded. No human subjects were used. Ctss−/− mice were provided by Dr. Guo-Ping Shi (9.Shi G.P. Villadangos J.A. Dranoff G. Small C. Gu L. Haley K.J. Riese R. Ploegh H.L. Chapman H.A. Cathepsin S required for normal MHC class II peptide loading and germinal center development.Immunity. 1999; 10: 197-206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). mdx mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (stock no. 001801). To generate mdx/Ctss−/− mice, mdx female mice in the C57Bl/10 background were mated with male Ctss−/− mice in the related C57Bl/6 background. The subsequent litters were backcrossed three times to generate mdx/Ctss−/− mice, and only male mdx/Ctss−/− and mdx littermates were used. WT C57Bl/6 male mice were used as controls. The following primers were used for Ctss−/− genotyping: Neo cassette (forward, 5′TGA ATG AAC TGC AGG ACG AG; reverse, 5′AAT ATC ACG GGT AGC CAA CG), WT (forward, 5′CTC TGT GTA GCC TGG AAT TCA C; reverse, 5′ATG CCA GAT GCA AAA AGC TTT AAC), and KO (forward, same primer as the WT forward sequence; reverse, 5′ACT TGT GTA GCG CCA AGT GCC). Genotyping for mdx was performed as shown previously (20.Shin J.H. Hakim C.H. Zhang K. Duan D. Genotyping mdx, mdx3cv, and mdx4cv mice by primer competition polymerase chain reaction.Muscle Nerve. 2011; 43: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The mouse Ctss cDNA was cloned in a modified human skeletal α-actin promoter (21.Brennan K.J. Hardeman E.C. Quantitative analysis of the human α-skeletal actin gene in transgenic mice.J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 719-725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to create skeletal muscle-specific TG mice (FVBN strain). Two TG lines were generated by DNA injection into newly fertilized mouse oocytes. TG males were compared with NTG littermate males. The following primers were used for genotyping of the Ctss transgene: forward, 5′CGA GAG TAG CAG TTG TAG CTA; reverse, 5′CAC AGT GTC AGG CAA TGT CC. A Ctss activity assay (Abcam, ab65307) was used to measure the cysteine proteolytic activity in either the dystrophic or BaCl2-injured skeletal muscle. Other cysteine protease activities measured included cathepsin B (Abcam, ab65300) and cathepsin L (Abcam, ab65306). Briefly, isolated muscles were frozen, ground into a fine powder using a mortar and pestle, and sonicated before the ice-cold buffer from the assay kit was added to the samples. The enzymatic assay itself was conducted according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Isolated muscles were frozen and ground to a fine powder using a mortar and pestle, homogenized, sonicated, and then added to ice-cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. Ctss was detected using rabbit polyclonal antibody from EMD Millipore (catalog no. 219384, 1:1000, against human and mouse epitope) by Western blotting as described previously (15.Tjondrokoesoemo A. Schips T. Kanisicak O. Sargent M.A. Molkentin J.D. Genetic overexpression of Serpina3n attenuates muscular dystrophy in mice.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2016; 25: 1192-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Skeletal muscle membrane enrichment protein fractions were prepared following a protocol described previously (22.Kobayashi Y.M. Rader E.P. Crawford R.W. Iyengar N.K. Thedens D.R. Faulkner J.A. Parikh S.V. Weiss R.M. Chamberlain J.S. Moore S.A. Campbell K.P. Sarcolemma-localized nNOS is required to maintain activity after mild exercise.Nature. 2008; 456: 511-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Standard Western blotting was then performed with the membrane-enriched protein extracts as shown previously (15.Tjondrokoesoemo A. Schips T. Kanisicak O. Sargent M.A. Molkentin J.D. Genetic overexpression of Serpina3n attenuates muscular dystrophy in mice.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2016; 25: 1192-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies used were α5-integrin (EMD Millipore, AB1928, 1:1000, polyclonal rabbit against mouse). The other antibodies used are listed in a study published previously (15.Tjondrokoesoemo A. Schips T. Kanisicak O. Sargent M.A. Molkentin J.D. Genetic overexpression of Serpina3n attenuates muscular dystrophy in mice.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2016; 25: 1192-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). ECM protein fractionation from quadriceps muscle was generated as described previously (23.Barallobre-Barreiro J. Didangelos A. Yin X. Doménech N. Mayr M. A sequential extraction methodology for cardiac extracellular matrix prior to proteomics analysis.Methods Mol. Biol. 2013; 1005: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies used included collagen IV (Abcam, ab19808, 1:1000, rabbit polyclonal against mouse) and fibronectin (Abcam, ab2413, 1:1000, rabbit polyclonal against mouse). These extracts were then subjected to Western blotting as described previously (15.Tjondrokoesoemo A. Schips T. Kanisicak O. Sargent M.A. Molkentin J.D. Genetic overexpression of Serpina3n attenuates muscular dystrophy in mice.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2016; 25: 1192-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted from muscles using the RNeasy kit according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Qiagen) and reverse-transcribed using SuperScript® III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, 18080-044). Differences in transcript levels were analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR using SYBR Green (Applied Biosystems). The primer sequences for Ctss were as follows: forward, 5′TGC GTC ACT GAG GTG AAA TAC C; reverse, 5′ CTT CAT TTG AGC AGT CCA CCA G. The primer sequences for other genes are listed in a previous study (15.Tjondrokoesoemo A. Schips T. Kanisicak O. Sargent M.A. Molkentin J.D. Genetic overexpression of Serpina3n attenuates muscular dystrophy in mice.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2016; 25: 1192-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Muscles were paraffin-embedded, and 6-μm histological sections were cut at the center of the muscle and stained with H&E or Masson trichrome. Pictures were generated at a magnification of ×200, and fibers of the quadriceps muscle were counted for central nucleation using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health). Interstitial fibrotic regions were quantified using MetaMorph 7.1 (Molecular Devices) as the percentage of the blue area stained with Masson trichrome. Immunohistochemistry was performed on muscle histological cryosections from optimal cutting temperature compound-embedded muscles using the following antibodies: Ctss (Abcam, ab96788, 1:100, rabbit polyclonal against human epitope), Laminin α-2 chain (Sigma-Aldrich, L0663, 1:200, rat monoclonal against mouse and human), and lysosome-associated membrane protein 2 (Lamp-2, Abcam, ab13524, 1:100, rat monoclonal against mouse and rabbit). Nuclei were stained blue with 1 mg/ml DAPI diluted to 1:5000 in saline. Wheat germ agglutinin-FITC (Sigma-Aldrich, L4895) was used at 50 μg/ml to outline membranes in Evans blue dye (EBD) experiments. Antibodies used for immunohistochemistry of sarcolemma adhesion components were described previously (15.Tjondrokoesoemo A. Schips T. Kanisicak O. Sargent M.A. Molkentin J.D. Genetic overexpression of Serpina3n attenuates muscular dystrophy in mice.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2016; 25: 1192-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Mice were injected with Evans blue dye (intraperitoneally, 10 mg/ml, 0.1 ml/10 g of body weight). Twenty-four hours later, mice were subjected to forced treadmill running for 30 min and sacrificed. The tibialis anterior (TA) muscles were removed, embedded in optimal cutting temperature compound and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen as described previously (15.Tjondrokoesoemo A. Schips T. Kanisicak O. Sargent M.A. Molkentin J.D. Genetic overexpression of Serpina3n attenuates muscular dystrophy in mice.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2016; 25: 1192-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). For the treadmill running protocol, ∼2- to 4-month-old mice were acclimatized to the treadmill (Omni-Pacer LC4/M, Columbus Instruments International) for 10 min at a speed of 6 m/min prior to shock grid activation. The speed was then changed to 10 m/min for 30 min. Running capacity was assessed by the maximum running endurance time before exhaustion. Exhaustion was determined by the animal remaining on the shock grid for more than 10 consecutive seconds. Sixty microliters of an aqueous 1.2% mass/volume BaCl2 (Sigma-Aldrich, 202-7385g) solution was injected along the whole length of the left TA muscle to induce injury and degeneration (24.Casar J.C. Cabello-Verrugio C. Olguin H. Aldunate R. Inestrosa N.C. Brandan E. Heparan sulfate proteoglycans are increased during skeletal muscle regeneration: requirement of syndecan-3 for successful fiber formation.J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 73-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Myofiber isolation from the flexor digitorum brevis was performed as described previously (15.Tjondrokoesoemo A. Schips T. Kanisicak O. Sargent M.A. Molkentin J.D. Genetic overexpression of Serpina3n attenuates muscular dystrophy in mice.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2016; 25: 1192-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Enzymatically dissociated flexor digitorum brevis fibers were plated onto Mattek glass-bottomed dishes containing 1.25 mm Ca2+ isotonic Tyrode solution. Damage to the myofibers was induced by irradiating a 5 × 5 pixel area on the sarcolemma membrane with 80 milliwatts at 351/364-nm wavelength for 10 s using a Nikon A1 confocal microscope equipped with a ×60 water immersion lens in the presence of 2.5 μm FM1-43 dye (Molecular Probes) in the extracellular Tyrode solution. Images were captured at 5-s intervals following irradiation with the laser. The mean fluorescence intensity in the damaged area was quantified by ImageJ software. Calcium-free analysis was performed by replacing the 1.25 mm Ca2+ with isotonic Tyrode solution lacking this divalent cation, which was also supplemented with 0.5 mm EGTA. All results are presented as mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed with unpaired two-tailed t test (for two groups) and one-way analysis of variance with Bonferroni correction (for groups of three or more). p values of <0.05 were considered significant. Animal numbers reflected the minimal number needed for statistical significance based on power analysis and prior experience. No data were excluded from the animal experiments, and blinding was not performed. mRNA profiling in humans with DMD and the mdx mouse showed an increase in Ctss expression (17.Baron D. Magot A. Ramstein G. Steenman M. Fayet G. Chevalier C. Jourdon P. Houlgatte R. Savagner F. Pereon Y.

Muscle genome-wide expression profiling during disease evolution in mdx mice.Physiol. Genomics. 2009; 37: 119-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), which we also observed in Affymetrix arrays from the muscle of δ-sarcoglycan-deficient mice (Sgcd−/−), a model of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, and in transgenic mice overexpressing the calcium/sodium influx channel Trpc3 that also develop a muscular dystrophy phenotype (25.Millay D.P. Goonasekera S.A. Sargent M.A. Maillet M. Aronow B.J. Molkentin J.D. Calcium influx is sufficient to induce muscular dystrophy through a TRPC-dependent mechanism.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 19023-19028Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). To validate these prior observations from various gene arrays, we performed quantitative PCR for Ctss, which revealed a 6-fold up-regulation of this mRNA in the skeletal muscle of mdx mice (Fig. 1A). More importantly, Ctss activity assays and Western blotting from skeletal muscle of mdx mice demonstrated Ctss up-regulation, this time at 6 weeks and 10 months of age (Fig. 1, B and C). Immunohistochemistry showed essentially no Ctss expression (green) in normal skeletal muscle, but skeletal muscle from mdx mice had abundant Ctss protein co-localized with laminin within the ECM region between myofibers but not within lysosomes, as co-stained with Lamp-2 (Fig. 1D). This suggested that, in dystrophic muscle, Ctss was up-regulated and primarily localized to the extracellular compartment. To assess whether up-regulation of Ctss is induced following acute muscle injury, 60 μl of 1.2% BaCl2 solution was injected into the TA muscle of WT mice (24.Casar J.C. Cabello-Verrugio C. Olguin H. Aldunate R. Inestrosa N.C. Brandan E. Heparan sulfate proteoglycans are increased during skeletal muscle regeneration: requirement of syndecan-3 for successful fiber formation.J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 73-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Significant induction of Ctss proteolytic activity and protein expression was observed with initial expression 3 days post-injury that was sustained through day 6 (Fig. 1, E and F). Myogenin was used to show myofibers undergoing regeneration because of a successful injury response. Collectively, these results demonstrate that endogenous Ctss is up-regulated following acute injury to skeletal muscle and during chronic muscular dystrophy. Genetic deletion of Ctss in an atherosclerotic mouse background resulted in reduced disease progression either through modulation of the immune response or stabilization of ECM components (26.de Nooijer R.

To determine whether Ctss is an effector of chronic muscle disease, we crossed the viable and fertile Ctss−/− mouse with the mdx model. Basal characterization of skeletal muscle from Ctss−/− mice showed no morphology signs of disease or any observable alterations (data not shown). Western blotting analysis and Ctss activity assays confirmed the loss of Ctss protein expression and proteolytic activity in the skeletal muscle of mdx/Ctss−/− mice (Fig. 2, A and B). Genetic deletion of Ctss in mdx mice also blunted the increase in activity of the cysteine protease cathepsin B but not the increase in cathepsin L, both of which are also up-regulated in dystrophic skeletal muscle (Fig. 2B). Histological assessment of skeletal muscle from 2-month-old mdx/Ctss−/− mice showed a noticeable reduction in myofiber necrosis, fibrosis, and other aspects of muscle histopathology compared with mdx mice (Fig. 2C). This early time point (2 months) is especially important because it corresponds to the first few cycles of myofiber degeneration-regeneration during DMD pathogenesis in mice. Improvements in muscle histopathology were also observed in older (10-month-old) mdx/Ctss−/− mice (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, histological analysis of the"

Intravaginal practices—including behaviors such as intravaginal cleansing and insertion of products—have been linked to a number of adverse reproductive health outcomes, including increased risk for bacterial vaginosis, sexually transmitted infections, and HIV. Currently, little is known about the motivations for intravaginal practices among women in the United States. The objective of this study was to identify and describe motivations for intravaginal washing and intravaginal insertion of products among women of differing ages and racial/ethnic groups.
Methods 
Between 2008 and 2010, we enrolled a convenience sample of sexually active women aged 18–65 years living in Los Angeles recruited through community education and outreach activities in HIV/AIDS service organizations, women’s health clinics, community-based organizations, and HIV testing sites. At the enrollment visit, women completed a self-administered, computer-assisted questionnaire covering demographics, sexual behaviors, intravaginal practices, and motivations for intravaginal practices over the past month and past year.
Results 
We enrolled 141 women; 34% of participants were Caucasian, 40% African American, and 26% Latina. Peri-sexual intravaginal washing was common in all groups, whether to clean up after sex (70%) or to prepare for sex (54%). African American women were more likely to report learning to wash intravaginally from their mothers compared to Latina or Caucasian women (70% vs. 49%, P = 0.04). Sixty-one percent of African American women reported using a douching device over the past year compared to 41% of Latina and 40% of Caucasian women (p = 0.02). Younger women were more likely to report that their male partners wanted them to wash intravaginally than older women (77% vs. 24%, P<0.01), and more likely to report the removal of odors as a motive than older women (65% vs. 40%, P = 0.04). The most commonly used intravaginal products included sexual lubricants, petroleum jelly, body lotions, oils, and wet wipes. Use of these products varied by race, and motives given included increasing lubrication, preparing for sex, smelling good, and preventing sexually transmitted infections.
Conclusion 
Women’s intravaginal practices and motivations for these practices differ across race and age. Motivations for use also vary by type of intravaginal product used. Given that some intravaginal practices have been shown to be harmful, interventions, programs and counseling messages to encourage less harmful practices are needed, and should consider underlying motivations that influence women’s vaginal practices. Practitioners may use these results to better support women in achieving vaginal health."

After quality filtering, putative transmission linkages were inferred when two sequences were ≤1.5% genetically different. Multiple linkages were resolved into putative transmission clusters. Further phylogenetic analyses were performed using BEAST v1.8.1. Finally, we investigated putative links between the 259 sequences from South-East Austria and all publicly available HIV polymerase sequences in the Los Alamos National Laboratory HIV sequence database. We found that 45.6% (118/259) of the sampled sequences were genetically linked with at least one other sequence from South-East Austria forming putative transmission clusters. Clustering individuals were more likely to be men who have sex with men (MSM; p<0.001), infected with subtype B (p<0.001) or subtype F (p = 0.02). Among clustered males who reported only heterosexual (HSX) sex as an HIV risk, 47% clustered closely with MSM (either as pairs or within larger MSM clusters). One hundred and seven of the 259 sequences (41.3%) from South-East Austria had at least one putative inferred linkage with sequences from a total of 69 other countries. In conclusion, analysis of HIV-1 sequences from newly diagnosed individuals residing in South-East Austria revealed a high degree of national and international clustering mainly within MSM. Interestingly, we found that a high number of heterosexual males clustered within MSM networks, suggesting either linkage between risk groups or misrepresentation of sexual risk behaviors by subjects."

https://openalex.org/W2293838243,"Sensorineural hearing loss occurs due to damage to the inner and outer hair cells of the peripheral auditory system. Hearing loss can cause decreases in audibility, dynamic range, frequency and temporal resolution of the auditory system, and all of these effects are known to affect speech intelligibility. In this study, a new reference-free speech intelligibility metric is proposed using 2-D neurograms constructed from the output of a computational model of the auditory periphery. The responses of the auditory-nerve fibers with a wide range of characteristic frequencies were simulated to construct neurograms. The features of the neurograms were extracted using third-order statistics referred to as bispectrum. The phase coupling of neurogram bispectrum provides a unique insight for the presence (or deficit) of supra-threshold nonlinearities beyond audibility for listeners with normal hearing (or hearing loss). The speech intelligibility scores predicted by the proposed method were compared to the behavioral scores for listeners with normal hearing and hearing loss both in quiet and under noisy background conditions. The results were also compared to the performance of some existing methods. The predicted results showed a good fit with a small error suggesting that the subjective scores can be estimated reliably using the proposed neural-response-based metric. The proposed metric also had a wide dynamic range, and the predicted scores were well-separated as a function of hearing loss. The proposed metric successfully captures the effects of hearing loss and supra-threshold nonlinearities on speech intelligibility. This metric could be applied to evaluate the performance of various speech-processing algorithms designed for hearing aids and cochlear implants."
https://openalex.org/W2293978648,"Activation of inflammatory signaling pathways links obesity with metabolic disorders. TLR4-mediated activation of MAPKs and NF-kB are 2 such pathways implicated in obesity-induced inflammation. Apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) exerts anti-inflammatory effects on adipocytes by effluxing cholesterol from the cells via the ATP binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1). It is not known if these effects involve inhibition of inflammatory signaling pathways by apoA-I. This study asks if apoA-I inhibits activation of MAPKs and NF-kB in mouse 3T3-L1 adipocytes and whether this inhibition is ABCA1 dependent. Incubation of differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes with apoA-I decreased cell surface expression of TLR4 by 16 ± 2% and synthesis of the TLR4 adaptor protein, myeloid differentiation primary response 88, by 24 ± 4% in an ABCA1-dependent manner. ApoA-I also inhibited downstream activation of MAPKs, such as ERK, p38MAPK, and JNK, as well as expression of proinflammatory adipokines in bacterial LPS-stimulated 3T3-L1 adipocytes in an ABCA1-dependent manner. ApoA-I, by contrast, suppressed nuclear localization of the p65 subunit of NF-kB by 30 ± 3% in LPS-stimulated 3T3-L1 adipocytes in an ABCA1-independent manner. In conclusion, apoA-I inhibits TLR4-mediated inflammatory signaling pathways in adipocytes by preventing MAPK and NF-kB activation.—Sultana, A., Cochran, B.

https://openalex.org/W2294636877,"Male house mice produce large quantities of major urinary proteins (MUPs), which function to bind and transport volatile pheromones, though they may also function as scavengers that bind and excrete toxic compounds (‘toxic waste hypothesis’). In this study, we demonstrate the presence of an industrial chemical, 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol (DTBP), in the urine of wild-derived house mice (Mus musculus musculus). Addition of guanidine hydrochloride to male and female urine resulted in an increased release of DTBP. This increase was only observed in the high molecular weight fractions (HMWF; > 3 kDa) separated from male or female urine, suggesting that the increased release of DTBP was likely due to the denaturation of MUPs and the subsequent release of MUP-bound DTBP. Furthermore, when DTBP was added to a HMWF isolated from male urine, an increase in 2-sec-butyl-4,5-dihydrothiazole (SBT), the major ligand of MUPs and a male-specific pheromone, was observed, indicating that DTBP was bound to MUPs and displaced SBT. These results suggest that DTBP is a MUP ligand. Moreover, we found evidence for competitive ligand binding between DTBP and SBT, suggesting that males potentially face a tradeoff between eliminating toxic wastes versus transporting pheromones. Our findings support the hypothesis that MUPs bind and eliminate toxic wastes, which may provide the most important fitness benefits of excreting large quantities of these proteins."

However, the ideal mode of processing and presenting these immunogens for effective vaccination has yet to be determined. We used our recently described vaccine candidate based on full-length HCV E1 or E2 glycoproteins fused to the heterologous hepatitis B virus S envelope protein to compare the use of the E1 and E2 proteins as separate immunogens with their use as the E1E2 heterodimer, in terms of immunogenetic potential and the capacity to induce neutralizing antibodies. The specific anti-E1 and anti-E2 antibody responses induced in animals immunized with vaccine particles harboring the heterodimer were profoundly impaired with respect to those in animals immunized with particles harboring E1 and E2 separately. Moreover, the anti-E1 and anti-E2 antibodies had additive neutralizing properties that increase the cross-neutralization of heterologous strains of various HCV genotypes, highlighting the importance of including both E1 and E2 in the vaccine for an effective vaccination strategy. Our study has important implications for the optimization of HCV vaccination strategies based on HCV envelope proteins, regardless of the platform used to present these proteins to the immune system."

In this Commentary, we identify key elements of communication required to successfully translate promising biological findings to novel approved drug therapies and discuss the attendant challenges and opportunities. The discovery and development of new medicines that promote human health and potentially extend natural life remains a remarkably challenging endeavor. In this Commentary, we identify key elements of communication required to successfully translate promising biological findings to novel approved drug therapies and discuss the attendant challenges and opportunities. While the successful development of numerous drugs to manage a wide variety of maladies has improved the quality and length of life for countless people, there remains a large unmet need for therapeutics for especially challenging diseases, including various cancers, cardiovascular disease, metabolic disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, psychiatric disorders, infectious diseases, and numerous genetic syndromes. What are the key factors that limit our ability to tackle these diseases with novel medicines? For one, disease biology is immensely complex, and despite an ever-increasing understanding of both basic and disease biology, our ability to identify the most relevant therapeutic targets and to discover drugs that selectively, effectively, and safely modulate those targets to produce clinical benefit remains frustratingly limited. Furthermore, recent advances in the various “omic” technologies that enable precise molecular characterization of diseased tissue have revealed substantial inter-patient heterogeneity, prompting efforts to “personalize” drug treatment. This new paradigm presents both an opportunity to match patients with the right medicines as well as the challenge to develop a sufficiently diverse arsenal of drugs to benefit the growing number of subsets of biomarker-stratified patients. There is also the challenge of the drug discovery and development process itself—a byzantine and expensive undertaking that fails far more often than it succeeds. A typical program, culminating with regulatory approval, involves dozens to hundreds of workers, requires 10–15 years, and costs hundreds of millions of dollars (DiMasi et al., 2016DiMasi J.A. Grabowski H.G. Hansen R.W. Innovation in the Pharmaceutical Industry: New Estimates of R&D Costs.Journal of Health Economics. 2016; (Published online 12 February 2016)https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhealeco.2016.01.012Crossref PubMed Scopus (1645) Google Scholar). Several recent trends have converged to highlight the role of effective, forthright communication among the many participants in this process as an important element of success. While the discovery and development of currently approved drugs has proceeded through various paths, a somewhat standard approach underlies most successful programs (Figure 1). Typically, a drug discovery campaign begins with a biological observation and an associated therapeutic hypothesis. In most cases, the identification of such targets reflects the cumulative findings of multiple investigators whose independent efforts eventually converge. However, even a single especially provocative discovery can prompt efforts to prosecute a target for therapeutic development. Initial findings are usually reported by academic researchers in peer-reviewed publications, and the especially promising reports prompt efforts to further validate the target and the therapeutic hypothesis. Once a promising target is deemed “validated,” it is often prosecuted for drug discovery. The development of high-throughput screening approaches and improvements in medicinal chemistry and antibody engineering methods in the 1980s and 1990s have revolutionized the pharmaceutical industry, greatly enabling the discovery of candidate therapeutic molecules. The underlying technology has moved beyond pharmaceutical companies, and screening is also now conducted (usually on a smaller scale) in many academic research institutions, with academic laboratories pursuing efforts to discover drugs—or at least “tool compounds” to serve as potential starting points for drug development. Such efforts have yielded numerous tantalizing publications as well as many licensing agreements between academic institutions and biopharmaceutical companies. Unfortunately, many of the published claims regarding candidate therapeutic targets and “lead compounds” prove problematic. In a revealing study, Amgen scientists described their efforts to replicate results from dozens of landmark cancer research publications (Begley and Ellis, 2012Begley C.G. Ellis L.M. Drug development: Raise standards for preclinical cancer research.Nature. 2012; 483: 531-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (1895) Google Scholar). The result was disappointing—findings could be replicated in only six of 53 cases. While this was surprising to many, our experience as industry scientists and that of many of our colleagues has been similar. A number of root causes and contributing factors have been suggested, and they continue to be widely discussed. In any event, a basic failure of scientific communication was made plain by this experiment. The ensuing discussion of these issues has been generally productive. While some changes in the manuscript review process have been implemented, it is too early to assess the impact. One approach, implemented by some journals, is a checklist for authors of life sciences articles intended to document the rigor with which experiments were conducted, including statistical methods and measures taken to address potential bias (Nature Editors, 2013Nature EditorsReporting checklist for life sciences articles.Nature. 2013; 496: 398Crossref Google Scholar; see also checklist available at: http://www.nature.com/authors/policies/checklist.pdf). The editors of some journals have also indicated a willingness to commission statisticians as consultants for certain manuscripts—noting that the training of young biologists is often inadequate with regard to statistics and quantitative analysis, potentially resulting in invalid conclusions. In the context of drug discovery reports, especially those coming from academic biologists, many of whom underestimate the rigorous evaluation required to adequately credential a novel pharmacologic agent, journal editors should routinely engage industry-based scientists with relevant technical expertise to review such studies. This would be analogous to the aforementioned enhanced use of statisticians as consultants in the review process. One reason why industry reviewers are particularly attentive to robustness is their recognition of the cost of all-too-frequent clinical development failures. Prior to publication, even at the early stages of a drug discovery project, academic biologists should be encouraged to seek guidance from technical experts. While soliciting consultation from industry scientists is likely to be challenging, many experts with relevant knowledge are in fact embedded within most academic biomedical research institutions these days. Notably, academic technology transfer departments within these institutions have a clear incentive to foster such interactions, considering their interest in developing and licensing intellectual property resulting from drug discovery projects. In our experience, industry reviewers of such licensing opportunities often uncover flaws that were perhaps missed by journal reviewers and the investigators themselves. More fundamentally, communicating information regarding novel candidate targets and therapeutics in journal articles can be problematic because many claims are simply “oversold,” with authors failing to note potential caveats, or other limitations of their analysis. Contributing factors include a peer-review journal publication process that sometimes favors luster over rigor, the evolving NIH mission that increasingly emphasizes translational potential, as well as the occasionally blind optimism that characterizes human nature. However, considering the importance of these target and drug discoveries in the future development of medicines to address important human diseases, additional scrutiny is appropriate before such claims are published. We also suggest that published claims regarding novel targets or inhibitors should include specific communication regarding potential caveats. Journal editors should consider mandating that the Discussion section of such reports includes an honest and complete listing of these limitations. Such “disclaimers” should not preclude publication (unless the limitations are substantial), but rather, they should set a realistic foundation for the next important steps in the process of adequately credentialing and validating a candidate target or molecule. In short, the benefit of an enhanced process for manuscript review and publication to improve communication of genuine biomedical advances with the potential to provide a foundation for eventual drug development seems clear. The drug discovery paradigm itself introduces a variety of communication challenges. Typically, once a target is validated, a project team is formed within a biotechnology or pharmaceutical company to initiate the laborious process of discovering and evaluating candidate molecules with therapeutic potential. Teams include biologists, medicinal chemists, biochemists, structural biologists, pharmacologists, safety toxicologists, clinicians, and marketing professionals. This group is charged with oversight of a carefully orchestrated effort involving various technical functions. Although they share a common goal, each of the experts on the team is, in some measure, a “specialist,” having trained for many years to develop competence in an arcane discipline. The biologists talk of “membrane blebs” and “mitotic catastrophe,” chemists describe “chiral centers” and “rotational bonds,” structural biologists refer to “steric hindrance” and “NMR spectroscopy,” biochemists speak of “Hill coefficients” and “non-competitive inhibition,” pharmacologists relate to “bioequivalence” and “hepatic clearance,” toxicologists make note of “exposure limits” and “genotoxicity,” and clinicians describe “marrow suppression” and “edema.” In short, the various team members each speak a different “language,” and unlike at a United Nations meeting, there is usually no interpreter at the table. Given the high level of specialization among the participants, the drug discovery paradigm faces an inherent communication challenge, operating against a backdrop of the innumerable decisions required of project teams. We suggest that team experts make a concerted effort to describe vital information using language that is readily understandable to everyone on the team. A conscious effort should be made to avoid jargon. It is neither necessary nor practical that everyone on the team understands all the technical nuances of each discipline, and use of jargon often bundles assumptions in a “short-hand” that can obscure the essential points for others. The most effective project teams use their shared understanding, facilitated by genuine efforts to develop a common and informative language, to enable optimal decision-making. By engaging all the key participants, a conscious effort at clear, forthright communication is thus likely to increase the chance of program success. If we consider drug discovery as an engineering problem—which to a large degree it is—we can examine the role of communication in the context of other ambitious engineering feats. Putting a man on the moon required that teams of highly specialized aeronautical, mechanical, electrical, chemical, and computer engineers carefully coordinated their activities to ensure mission success. A failure to appropriately link these functions could be catastrophic. And while a communication breakdown due to “language” differences could be problematic, other forms of miscommunication among scientists and between scientists and managers can also play a role. In fact, NASA has substantial experience in this area, as their many ambitious programs were not uniformly successful. For example, the Apollo 13 explosion was ultimately attributed to a series of poor communications between engineers and managers that led to some bad decisions before the mission even began. Similar communication problems contributed to the two space shuttle disasters, the flawed Hubble telescope construction, and the infamous metric conversion error that doomed the Mars Orbiter. By analogy, the successful “engineering” of a new drug depends critically on effective communication of innumerable bits of information among a large number of experts and managers, and includes an ever-present risk of catastrophic failure. One noteworthy distinction between drug discovery programs and more conventional engineering projects relates to the role and magnitude of the attendant uncertainty. Putting a man on the moon should not have required good luck—rather, it required accurate calculations and quantitative measurements of well-understood physical systems. Biology, on the other hand, is still very much incompletely understood, and the result of various perturbations of biological systems remains largely unpredictable. Consequently, much of our new knowledge is determined empirically. As such, in the iterative trial-and-error process that underlies much of biology discovery, communicating experimental failure can be just as important as communicating success. Moving beyond the discovery of candidate drugs, the drug development process required to evaluate the clinical potential of a novel drug candidate is similarly associated with communication challenges. Appropriate scrutiny at an early stage should translate into a greater probability of future success. Surprisingly, however, a recent analysis of AstraZeneca’s drug development pipeline revealed that, among the projects classified as efficacy failures in Phase II, 40% were associated with a fundamental failure to link the supposed molecular target to the intended indication (Cook et al., 2014Cook D. Brown D. Alexander R. March R. Morgan P. Satterthwaite G. Pangalos M.N. Lessons learned from the fate of AstraZeneca’s drug pipeline: a five-dimensional framework.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2014; 13: 419-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar). Many such failures could probably have been avoided by focusing at an early stage on issues such as the strength of the evidence supporting the drug target, adequate pharmacodynamics measures, and robust activity in a well-validated animal model, and ensuring that all of the relevant information was clearly communicated among project team members. Evidence of failed communication was implied in another finding from the AstraZeneca analysis—development plans targeting the wrong patient population were cited as a reason for failure to demonstrate clinical efficacy in a third of cases. The authors suggested that some teams may have overvalued commercial considerations relative to targeting the most appropriate patient populations based on the underlying disease biology. One example is the development of olaparib, a PARP inhibitor originally shown to confer synthetic lethality in cancer cells with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations (Bryant et al., 2005Bryant H.E. Schultz N. Thomas H.D. Parker K.M. Flower D. Lopez E. Kyle S. Meuth M. Curtin N.J. Helleday T. Specific killing of BRCA2-deficient tumours with inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase.Nature. 2005; 434: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (3647) Google Scholar). Despite the obvious clinical development path informed by early results in patients with BRCA mutations, later clinical development focused on a much larger (and more heterogeneous) population that was not selected on the basis of BRCA mutations, and the inhibitor failed to demonstrate sufficient efficacy. Clinical development in BRCA-deficient tumors ultimately continued and proved highly efficacious after an unfortunate delay, and the drug is now approved. We suggest that a focus on translational biology and forthright communication of the therapeutic hypothesis by the project team might have avoided the delays and expense that resulted from targeting the wrong patient population. Central to the drug development enterprise is the need to translate the underlying biological discovery into a relevant patient population. Use of the word “translate” in this context implies the challenge of effectively communicating the potential impact of basic biomedical discoveries so that therapies on which they are based can be effectively evaluated in humans. The terms “translational biology” and “translational medicine” suggest that more than one language is being spoken and highlights the need for a core understanding. Indeed, the National Center for Advancing Translational Science (NCATS; http://www.ncats.nih.gov/about) was established within the NIH to “transform the translational science process so that new treatments and cures for disease can be delivered to patients faster” (Collins, 2011Collins F.S. Reengineering translational science: the time is right.Sci. Transl. Med. 2011; 3: 90cm17Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). A key part of the mission is to ensure training and education that focuses on team-based, interdisciplinary science outside of traditionally-defined fields. It appears that momentum is gathering to develop future researchers who are well versed in the core translational curriculum. Such individuals will make up the next generation of drug developers, and will hopefully develop a lingua franca that will facilitate communication more deeply and intuitively than a mere attempt at “translation.” We believe that success of “precision medicine” will depend on developing and rewarding similar competencies among biomedical scientists and physicians. In the IOM report, “Toward Precision Medicine: Building a Knowledge Network for Biomedical Research and a New Taxonomy of Disease,” the authors note that the new system will require that healthcare providers develop great literacy in the interpretation and application of molecular data and that biomedical education will need to adjust to accommodate this emerging need (Committee on a Framework for Development a New Taxonomy of Disease; et al., 2011Committee on a Framework for Development a New Taxonomy of Disease; Board on Life Sciences; Division on Earth and Life Studies; National Research CouncilToward precision medicine: Building a knowledge network for biomedical research and a new taxonomy of disease. The National Academies Press, 2011https://doi.org/10.17226/13284http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=13284Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar). An example cited by the authors is a system characterized by vertical integration of biomedical information rather than discipline-specific training. The goal would be to have future physicians develop a holistic view of biological processes, one that prepares them to successfully integrate genomics with a new taxonomy of disease and promotes far more informed decision-making in clinical practice. A fundamental change in medical education of this type would have the additional benefit of preparing students pursuing research careers to function in a biomedical milieu that increasingly requires multidisciplinary approaches. Realizing the full benefits of precision medicine in drug development will require an integrated approach to communicating genuine discoveries as well as more prosaic results. Ensuring an appropriate degree of scientific rigor in disseminating key discoveries is ongoing, but institutional barriers and biases that tend to discourage publishing negative data and confirmatory data still exist. Some progress toward openness has come in the form of a commitment by several pharmaceutical companies to make available raw clinical trial data for exploratory analyses by third-party researchers (http://www.phrma.org/phrmapedia/responsible-clinical-trial-data-sharing). Regulatory agencies, including the FDA, have expressed enthusiasm for enhanced communication with drug sponsors to improve the efficiency of the drug development process (U.S. Department of Health and Human ServicesFood and Drug AdministrationCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER)and Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), 2015U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug Administration, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), and Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER)Draft guidance: Best practices for communication between IND sponsors and FDA during drug development—Guidance for industry and review staff.

The FDA regularly provides advice on the adequacy of technical data in support of an IND filing, design of a clinical trial, and the information needed to meet regulatory requirements. For drugs developed under expedited programs, the FDA offers more intensive guidance with increased interactions and communications, including meetings. In the final analysis, the biomedical community must communicate effectively with the public at large. Given the enormous public investment in drug development, together with the high cost of new treatments, the public has a right to understand and question current practices. When people seek to build a bridge or even send someone to the moon, they do not envision a process that succeeds only rarely! Many are dismayed by the seemingly feeble pace of progress in developing treatments for many common diseases. It will certainly require our collective communication skills to explain the disappointing reality that so many expensive drug development efforts are viewed simply as “shots on goal.” A solid scientific hypothesis, thoughtful decision-making, and high-quality experimental execution are generally regarded as essential components of any successful drug development campaign. However, because much of biology remains poorly understood, even when we believe that we have mitigated the potential risks associated with a new investigational agent to the best of our abilities, it is well understood that the outcome of clinical experimentation is unpredictable, and in most cases, development unfortunately fails. Good fortune notwithstanding, we suggest that effective communication among the many participants throughout the long course of this complex process is yet another important element, and one for which some relatively straightforward steps could be taken to make significant improvements and thereby increase the likelihood of success for these vitally important programs."

We previously showed efficacy of ganglidiomab in vivo, a murine anti-idiotype (anti-Id) IgG1. In order to tailor immune responses to variable regions, we generated a new human/mouse chimeric anti-Id antibody (Ab) ganglidiximab by replacing murine constant fragments with corresponding human IgG1 regions. DNA sequences encoding for variable regions of heavy (VH) and light chains (VL) were synthesized by RT-PCR from total RNA of ganglidiomab-producing hybridoma cells and further ligated into mammalian expression plasmids with coding sequences for constant regions of human IgG1 heavy and light chains, respectively. We established a stable production cell line using Chinese hamster ovarian (CHO) cells co-transfected with two expression plasmids driving the expression of either ganglidiximab heavy or light chain. After purification from supernatants, anti-idiotypic characteristics of ganglidiximab were demonstrated. Binding of ganglidiximab to anti-GD2 Abs of the 14.18 family as well as to NK-92tr cells expressing a GD2-specific chimeric antigen receptor (scFv(ch14.18)-zeta) was shown using standard ELISA and flow cytometry analysis, respectively. Ganglidiximab binding affinities to anti-GD2 Abs were further determined by surface plasmon resonance technique. Moreover, binding of anti-GD2 Abs to the nominal antigen GD2 as well as GD2-specific Ab-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC, CDC) was competitively inhibited by ganglidiximab. Finally, ganglidiximab was successfully used as a protein vaccine in vivo to induce a GD2-specific humoral immune response. In summary, we report generation and characterization of a new human/mouse chimeric anti-Id Ab ganglidiximab for active immunotherapy against NB. This Ab may be useful to tailor immune responses to the paratope regions mimicking GD2 overexpressed in NB."
https://openalex.org/W2343259062,"Admixture and recombination create populations and genomes with genetic ancestry from multiple source populations. Analyses of genetic ancestry in admixed populations are relevant for trait and disease mapping, studies of speciation, and conservation efforts. Consequently, many methods have been developed to infer genome-average ancestry and to deconvolute ancestry into continuous local ancestry blocks or tracts within individuals. Current methods for local ancestry inference perform well when admixture occurred recently or hybridization is ongoing, or when admixture occurred in the distant past such that local ancestry blocks have fixed in the admixed population. However, methods to infer local ancestry frequencies in isolated admixed populations still segregating for ancestry do not exist. In the current paper, I develop and test a continuous correlated beta process model to fill this analytical gap. The method explicitly models autocorrelations in ancestry frequencies at the population-level and uses discriminant analysis of SNP windows to take advantage of ancestry blocks within individuals. Analyses of simulated data sets show that the method is generally accurate such that ancestry frequency estimates exhibited low root-mean-square error and were highly correlated with the true values, particularly when large (±10 or ±20) SNP windows were used. Along these lines, the proposed method outperformed post hoc inference of ancestry frequencies from a traditional hidden Markov model (i.e., the linkage model in structure), particularly when admixture occurred more distantly in the past with little on-going gene flow or was followed by natural selection. The reliability and utility of the method was further assessed by analyzing genetic ancestry in an admixed human population (Uyghur) and three populations from a hybrid zone between Mus domesticus and M. musculus. Considerable variation in ancestry frequencies was detected within and among chromosomes in the Uyghur, with a large region of excess French ancestry harboring a gene with a known disease association. Similar variation was detected in the mouse hybrid zone, with notable constancy in regions of excess ancestry among admixed populations. By filling what has been an analytical gap, the proposed method should be a useful tool for many biologists. A computer program (popanc), written in C++, has been developed based on the proposed method and is available on-line at http://sourceforge.net/projects/popanc/."
https://openalex.org/W2293158405,"Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a debilitating, often fatal disease caused by Leishmania donovani complex; however, it is a neglected tropical disease. L. donovani complex comprises two closely related species, L. donovani that is mostly anthroponotic and L. infantum that is zoonotic. Differentiation between these two species is critical due to the differences in their epidemiology and pathology. However, they cannot be differentiated morphologically, and their speciation using isoenzyme-based methods poses a difficult task and may be unreliable. Molecular characterization is now the most reliable method to differentiate between them and to determine their phylogenetic relationships. The present study aims to characterize Leishmania species isolated from bone marrows of Yemeni pediatric patients using sequence analysis of the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer-1 (ITS1) gene. Out of 41 isolates from Giemsa-stained bone marrow smears, 25 isolates were successfully amplified by nested polymerase chain reaction and sequenced in both directions. Phylogenetic analysis using neighbor joining method placed all study isolates in one cluster with L. donovani complex (99% bootstrap). The analysis of ITS1 for microsatellite repeat numbers identified L. infantum in 11 isolates and L. donovani in 14 isolates. These data suggest the possibility of both anthroponotic and zoonotic transmission of VL-causing Leishmania species in Yemen. Exploring the possible animal reservoir hosts is therefore needed for effective control to be achieved."

Phospholipase C gamma 2 (PLCG2) is important for B-cell survival and proliferation. We used BALB/c mice with a gain-of-function mutation in the Plcg2 gene (Ali5) to analyze its role in the development of gastric MALT lymphoma. Heterozygous BALB/c Plcg2Ali5/+ and wildtype (WT) mice were infected with Helicobacter felis (H. felis) and observed up to 16 months for development of gastric MALT lymphomas. In contrast to our initial hypothesis, Plcg2Ali5/+ mice developed MALT lymphomas less frequently than their WT littermates after long-term infection of 16 months. Infected Plcg2Ali5/+ mice showed downregulation of proinflammatory cytokines and decreased H. felis-specific IgG1 and IgG2a antibody responses. These results suggested a blunted immune response of Plcg2Ali5/+ mice towards H. felis infection. Intriguingly, Plcg2Ali5/+ mice harboured higher numbers of CD73 expressing regulatory T cells (Tregs), possibly responsible for impaired immune response towards Helicobacter infection. We suggest that Plcg2Ali5/+ mice may be protected from developing gastric MALT lymphomas as a result of elevated Treg numbers, reduced response to H. felis and decrease of proinflammatory cytokines."
https://openalex.org/W2295538205,"Triggering receptors expressed on myeloid cells (TREM) form a multigene family of immunoregulatory Ig-like receptors and play important roles in the regulation of innate and adaptive immunity. In chickens, three members of the TREM family have been identified on chromosome 26. One of them is TREM-B1 which possesses two V-set Ig-domains, an uncharged transmembrane region and a long cytoplasmic tail with one ITSM and two ITIMs indicating an inhibitory function. We generated specific monoclonal antibodies by immunizing a Balb/c mouse with a TREM-B1-FLAG transfected BWZ.36 cell line and tested the hybridoma supernatants on TREM-B1-FLAG transfected 2D8 cells. We obtained two different antibodies specific for TREM-B1, mab 7E8 (mouse IgG1) and mab 1E9 (mouse IgG2a) which were used for cell surface staining. Single and double staining of different tissues, including whole blood preparations, revealed expression on thrombocytes. Next we investigated the biochemical properties of TREM-B1 by using the specific mab 1E9 for immunoprecipitation of either lysates of surface biotinylated peripheral blood cells or stably transfected 2D8 cells. Staining with streptavidin coupled horse radish peroxidase revealed a glycosylated monomeric protein of about 50 kDa. Furthermore we used the stably transfected 2D8 cell line for analyzing the cytoplasmic tyrosine based signaling motifs. After pervanadate treatment, we detected phosphorylation of the tyrosine residues and subsequent recruitment of the tyrosine specific protein phosphatase SHP-2, indicating an inhibitory potential for TREM-B1. We also showed the inhibitory effect of TREM-B1 in chicken thrombocytes using a CD107 degranulation assay. Crosslinking of TREM-B1 on activated primary thrombocytes resulted in decreased CD107 surface expression of about 50–70%."
https://openalex.org/W2301466677,"3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; ecstasy) metabolism is known to be stereoselective, with preference for S-stereoisomers. Its major metabolic step involves CYP2D6-catalyzed demethylenation to 3,4-dihydroxymethamphetamine (DHMA), followed by methylation and conjugation. Alterations in CYP2D6 genotype and/or phenotype have been associated with higher toxicity. Therefore, the impact of CYP2D6 function on the plasma pharmacokinetics of MDMA and its phase I and II metabolites was tested by comparing extensive metabolizers (EMs), intermediate metabolizers (IMs), and EMs that were pretreated with bupropion as a metabolic inhibitor in a controlled MDMA administration study. Blood plasma samples were collected from 16 healthy participants (13 EMs and three IMs) up to 24 h after MDMA administration in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, four-period, cross-over design, with subjects receiving 1 week placebo or bupropion pretreatment followed by a single placebo or MDMA (125 mg) dose. Bupropion pretreatment increased the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 h (AUC24) of R-MDMA (9% and 25%, respectively) and S-MDMA (16% and 38%, respectively). Bupropion reduced the Cmax and AUC24 of the CYP2D6-dependently formed metabolite stereoisomers of DHMA 3-sulfate, DHMA 4-sulfate, and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxymethamphetamine (HMMA sulfate and HMMA glucuronide) by approximately 40%. The changes that were observed in IMs were generally comparable to bupropion-pretreated EMs. Although changes in stereoselectivity based on CYP2D6 activity were observed, these likely have low clinical relevance. Bupropion and hydroxybupropion stereoisomer pharmacokinetics were unaltered by MDMA co-administration. The present data might aid further interpretations of toxicity based on CYP2D6-dependent MDMA metabolism."

Children who inherit one null allele of the retinoblastoma 1 gene (RB1) are RB1+/− in all cells and develop retinoblastoma with full penetrance, and the retinoblastoma cells are invariably RB1−/−. These cases represent the classic “two-hit” RB1-deficient tumorigenesis. Mice that inherited one knock-out allele of Rb1 (the mouse homolog of RB1) are Rb1+/− in all cells and develop pituitary melanotroph tumors with full penetrance, and the tumor cells are invariably Rb1−/−. Rb1+/− mice therefore model the two-hit RB1-deficient tumorigenesis. Biochemical studies have identified many repressing targets of pRb (encoded by RB1), with E2F1, E2F2, and E2F3 being the best studied (1.Trimarchi J.M. Lees J.A. Sibling rivalry in the E2F family.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar).

The mice used in this study were on mixed C57BL/6J×129Sv×FVB strain background. The mice were maintained under pathogen-free conditions in the Albert Einstein College of Medicine animal facility. All procedures were reviewed and approved by Einstein Animal Care Committee, conforming to accepted standards of humane animal care. Gestation and embryo age were determined by timed mating. Male and female mice were put in the same cage in late evening on day 1 and were separated in early morning on day 2. The embryo age was counted as E0.5 on day 2 if the female mice were found pregnant later. Pregnant females were intraperitoneally injected with BrdU (0.1 mg/g) 2 h before harvest. Embryos at various ages were harvested and were fixed in 10% formalin (Fisher Scientific, SF 100-4), embedded in paraffin wax, and sectioned. For embryos older than E15.5, decalcification was performed before routine processing to paraffin embedding. Embryo histology studies were conducted together with Albert Einstein Cancer Center mouse pathology core. Embryo brains used for RT-PCR and Western blots were dissected, snap frozen, and kept in −80 °C freezer. For IHC and IF staining, embryos were sectioned at 5-μm thickness. The slides were deparaffinized, hydrated, and incubated in a steamer for 20 min in sodium citrate buffer (Vector Labs, H3301) for antigen retrieval. Sections were first treated with 3% H2O2 to quench endogenous peroxidase, washed several times, blocked with 10% normal goat serum, and then incubated in primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight. The following antibodies were used: BrdU (CalBiochem, NA61, 1:100 dilution), PCNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-56, 1:100 dilution), and aCasp3 (Cell Signaling Technology, 9664S, 1:100 dilution). SuperPictureTM kit (Invitrogen, 879263 and 879163) was used to detect signals in IHC staining. IF detection of PCNA was done with rhodamine-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (Thermo Scientific, 31660, 1:100 dilution), aCasp3 was detected by TSATMPLUS fluorescence kit (NEL741001KT, PerkinElmer Life Science), and TUNEL staining was performed with an apoptosis detection kit (Millipore, S7100 and S7110). IHC staining was counterstained with Harris Hematoxylin (Poly Scientific R&D Corp, S212), and IF staining was counterstained with DAPI (Sigma-Aldrich, D-9564). The images were visualized with a Nikon Eclipse Ti-U microscope, captured with Olympus DP71 camera and DP Controller software (3.2.1.276), and saved with DP manager software (3.1.1.208). The images were further processed by Adobe Photoshop. For BrdU and TUNEL staining quantification, pictures were taken under 400× magnificence. Approximately 400–500 total cells were counted in each sample. For RT-qPCR analyses, total RNA was isolated from indicated embryo brains with RNeasy kit (Qiagen), and 2.5 μg of RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA in a 20-μl reaction with Superscript first strand synthesis system (Invitrogen). After 20 times dilution, ∼2 μl of cDNA of each sample was used as template for real time PCRs using SYBR Green dye (Applied Biosystems). All RT-qPCR results were normalized with GAPDH in the same samples and presented as the average of results from at least three embryo brains for each genotype. The primers for RT-qPCR were described before (20.Lu Z. Bauzon F. Fu H. Cui J. Zhao H. Nakayama K. Nakayama K.I. Zhu L.

For Western blot analyses, embryo brains were homogenized with Dounce glass homogenizer in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. Protein concentrations were determined by Bio-Rad protein assay kit (catalog no. 500-0006) using a SmartSpecTM 3000 spectrophotometer for equal loading by protein content. The same amount of protein extract was loaded on SDS gel, blotted, and probed with the following antibodies: pRb (BD Pharmingen, 554136, 1:1000 dilution), PCNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-56, 1:500 dilution), E2F1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-193, 1:200 dilution), Cyclin A (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-751, 1:200 dilution), Cyclin E (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-481, 1:200 dilution), Skp2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-7164, 1:200 dilution), p73 (Abcam, ab40658, 1:1000 dilution), phosphorylated-Histon H3 (Cell Signaling, 9701L, 1:1000 dilution), aCasp3 (Cell Signaling Technology, 9664S, 1:1000 dilution), p27 (BD Transduction Lab, 610242, 1:1000 dilution), and Tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich, T6074, 1:5000 dilution). 8% SDS-PAGE gel was used for pRb protein analysis, 12% gels were used for pHH3 and aCasp3 analyses, and 10% gels were used for other protein analyses. The protein marker for Western blot was from Crystalgen Inc. (catalog no. 65-0671). At least three embryo brains of indicated genotypes at different embryonic stages were analyzed with highly reproducible results. Differences in BrdU, TUNEL labeling, and RT-qPCR between indicated samples were analyzed by two-sided Student's t test. p < 0.05 is considered as statistically significant. Embryo survival analyses were analyzed by Fisher's exact test (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.005).

We found dead Rb1−/− embryos at low frequencies on E10.5 (1 of 19), E11.5 (2 of 19), E12.5 (0 of 9), and E13.5 (1 of 7). These low frequencies increased to 1 of 8, 9 of 16, 3 of 4, and 5 of 5, respectively, in Skp2−/−;Rb1−/− embryos. The increases are statistically significant on E11.5 (p = 0.0088), E12.5 (p = 0.014), and E13.5 (p = 0.015). Thus, Skp2−/− and Rb1−/− are synthetic lethal at the organismal level in mouse embryogenesis.TABLE 1Skp2−/−;Rb1−/− embryogenesis becomes lethal on E11.5AgeTotalSkp2+/+; Rb1+/+Skp2+/+; Rb1−/−Skp2−/−; Rb1−/−p valuesE10.514810 (0)19 (1)8 (1)p = 1.000E11.519716 (0)19 (2)16 (9)p = 0.009E12.51163 (0)9 (0)4 (3)p = 0.014E13.51205 (0)7 (1)5 (5)p = 0.015 Open table in a new tab Lethality in Rb1−/− embryogenesis on E14.5-E15.5 is caused by placental defects.

Because 60% of Skp2−/−;Rb1−/− embryos were dead on E11.5, we examined proliferation and apoptosis of placentas of the four combinations of Skp2 and Rb1 genotypes (Skp2+/+;Rb1+/+, Skp2+/+;Rb1−/−, Skp2−/−;Rb1+/+, and Skp2−/−;Rb1−/−) on E10.5. We found indistinguishable high proliferation (Fig. 1, A and C) and low apoptosis (Fig. 1, B and D) among these four genotypes. The structural defect of Rb1−/− placenta on E13.5 is clumps of trophoblasts in the labyrinth layer to the extent that restricted mother-fetus exchange space. On E10.5, trophoblasts clumps can be found in the labyrinth layer of WT and Skp2−/− placentas, likely because of the high proliferation in this location at this gestational stage. In comparison to WT and Skp2−/− placentas, Rb1−/− and Skp2−/−;Rb1−/− placentas showed noticeably larger trophoblast clumps (Fig. 1E). In the embryo proper, the four genotypes showed comparable organogenesis at E10.5 of heart (Fig. 2A, marked as H) and the central nervous system showing encephalic vesicles (Fig. 2A, marked as E), roof of hindbrain (Fig. 2A, marked as R), and fourth ventricle (Fig. 2A, marked as 4). Upon BrdU labeling, Rb1−/− embryos (Skp2+/+ or Skp2−/−) showed ectopic proliferation in the intermediate zone of the neuroepithelium in the developing brain (Fig. 2, B and D), and these brain regions in Skp2−/−;Rb1−/− embryos further contained significant TUNEL staining (Fig. 2, C and E). Thus, the Skp2-Rb1 synthetic lethal relationship is present at a cellular level as neuronal apoptosis in E10.5 Skp2−/−;Rb1−/− embryos, but not in E10.5 Rb1−/− or E10.5 Skp2−/− embryos.Figure 2Apoptosis in developing brains of E10. 5 Skp2−/−;Rb1−/− embryos.

When genotyping was performed at weaning age (21 days or older), we have not found a Skp2−/−;Nes-Cre;Rb1lox/lox mouse, indicating that Skp2−/− did not rescue the neonatal lethality of Nes-Cre;Rb1lox/lox mice (22.MacPherson D.

E13.5 Skp2+/+;Nes-Cre;Rb1lox/lox embryos did not contain apoptosis in the neuroepithelium of the brain (Fig. 3, A and B, panel b), which confirmed a previous report (22.MacPherson D. Sage J.

In Skp2−/− E13.5 embryos, the same Rb1 deletion induced massive apoptosis in the brain, detectable by TUNEL staining (Fig. 3, B, panel d, and D, panel d; quantified Fig. 3E), H&E staining (Fig. 3C, panel d), and staining (see Fig. 5G) and Western blotting (Fig. 5D) for cleaved (activated) Caspase 3 (aCasp3 for short). In Rb1−/− embryogenesis, E13.5 Rb1−/− embryos also showed similar neuronal apoptosis, but the apoptosis was prevented when Rb1−/− embryos were supplied with Rb1+/+ placentas. Nes-Cre;Rb1lox/lox does not delete Rb1 in placentas nor in non-neuronal tissues in embryo proper.TABLE 2Nes-Cre;Rb1lox/lox;Skp2−/− embryos develop to full termAgeNes-Cre;Rb1lox/lox;Skp2+/+Nes-Cre;Rb1lox/lox;Skp2−/−E13.522 (15)14 (8)E15.515 (10)12 (9)E17.513 (8)4 (3) Open table in a new tab Figure 5Biochemical and further cellular analysis of Skp2-Rb1 synthetic lethal neuronal apoptosis on E13. 5.

Loss of Rb activates both p53-dependent and independent cell death pathways in the developing mouse nervous system.EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6178-6188Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). When we additionally deleted Trp53 in neuronal lineage together with Rb1 in Skp2−/−;Nes-Cre;Rb1lox/lox;Trp53lox/lox embryos, the brain apoptosis remained, as detected by TUNEL staining (Fig. 4, B, panel b, and D, panel b) and H&E staining (Fig. 4C, panel b). These findings demonstrate that combined deletion of Rb1 and Skp2 can cell autonomously induce apoptosis in neuroepithelium of the developing brain and that the underlying mechanism for this synthetic lethal apoptosis is fundamentally different from that for the non-cell autonomously induced brain apoptosis in Rb1−/− embryos. To investigate the mechanisms of Skp2-Rb1 synthetic lethal brain apoptosis, we determined how Skp2−/− affected the effects of Rb1 deletion in the brain. Nes-Cre-mediated deletion of Rb1 in embryos afforded us brain tissues to quantitatively determine E2F target gene expression by RT-qPCR and Western blot. pRb represses the activating E2F subfamily E2F1, E2F2, and E2F3, whose target genes are mostly proliferative, with E2F1 being able to additionally activate expression of apoptotic gene PUMA via ARF-p53 and p73 directly as an E2F1 target gene. Following loss of Rb1, expression of typical proliferative E2F target genes is increased comparing brain tissues of Rb1lox/lox and Nes-Cre;Rb1lox/lox embryos (Fig. 5A). Consistent with the lack of brain apoptosis in Nes-Cre;Rb1lox/lox embryos, expression of E2F1 apoptotic target genes was not increased (Fig. 5B). When we determined expression of proliferative E2F target genes in brains of Skp2−/−;Nes-Cre;Rb1lox/lox embryos, we found that Skp2−/− did not correct the increased expression but instead increased the expression further and activated expression of E2F1 apoptotic target genes (Fig. 5, A and B). The further increased expression of proliferative E2F target genes and activation of expression of apoptotic E2F1 target genes in the brains of Skp2−/−;Nes-Cre;Rb1lox/lox embryos were more dramatic at protein levels (Fig. 5D). We next show that ectopic proliferation in the intermediate zone, as measured by BrdU labeling (Fig. 5, E and F) and Western blot for pHH3 (Fig. 5D), is increased following Rb1 deletion in brains of"
https://openalex.org/W2294881260,"The neo (neomycin phosphotransferase) gene is widely used as a selection marker in the production of genetically engineered animals and plants. Recent attention has been focused on safety concerns regarding neo transgene expression. In this study, neo transgenic and non-transgenic piglets were randomly assigned into Group A and Group B to evaluate effects of neo transgene by studying changes in gut microbiota using high-throughput sequencing. Group A pigs were fed a standard diet supplemented with antibiotic neomycin; Group B pigs were fed a standard diet. We examined horizontal transfer of exogenous neo gene using multiplex PCR; and investigated if the presence of secreted NPT II (neo expression product) in the intestine could lead to some protection against neomycin in transgenic pigs by monitoring different patterns of changes in gut microbiota in Group A animals. The unintended effects of neo transgene on gut microbiota were studied in Group B animals. Horizontal gene transfer was not detected in gut microbiota of any transgenic pigs. In Group A, a significant difference was observed between transgenic pigs and non-transgenic pigs in pattern of changes in Proteobacteria populations in fecal samples during and post neomycin feeding. In Group B, there were significant differences in the relative abundance of phyla Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria, and genera Lactobacillus and Escherichia-Shigella-Hafnia between transgenic pigs and non-transgenic pigs. We speculate that the secretion of NPT II from transgenic tissues/cells into gut microbiota results in the inhibition of neomycin activity and the different patterns of changes in bacterial populations. Furthermore, the neo gene also leads to unintended effects on gut microbiota in transgenic pigs that were fed with basic diet (not supplemented with neomycin). Thus, our data in this study caution that wide use of the neo transgene in genetically engineered animals should be carefully considered and fully assessed."

In this study, we determined the crystal structures of LysY from Thermus thermophilus HB27 (TtLysY) complexed with TtLysW-γ-AASA and TtLysW-γ-AAA, respectively. In both structures, the globular domain of TtLysW was recognized by positively charged residues on helix α9 and the β11-α10 loop of TtLysY through conformational changes.

The extended LysW recognition loop and conserved arginine residue were identified as signatures to discriminate LysY from ArgC, which is involved in arginine biosynthesis. Combined with the previously determined TtLysZ·TtLysW complex structure, TtLysW may simultaneously bind TtLysZ and TtLysY.

https://openalex.org/W2296127566,"Objective The recognition of mental illness without anticipating stigma might encourage adolescents’ help-seeking behavior. We aimed to identify the relationship between mental illness identification and adolescents’ intention to seek help if faced with mental illness. Method We examined the relationships between help-seeking intentions and recognition of mental illness (RMI) without correctly identifying the disease name, as well as correct labelling of schizophrenia (LSC) using a vignette about a person with schizophrenia in a cross-sectional survey of 9,484 Japanese high-school students aged 15–18 years. Results When compared with adolescents who were unable to recognize the mental illness (UMI) in the vignette, those in the RMI group reported they were significantly more likely to seek help from friends (odds ratio [OR] = 1.29; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.17–1.41; P < 0.001) and expressed an increased likelihood to seek help from professionals (all P < .05). Those in the LSC group reported they were significantly less likely to exhibit help-seeking behavior (OR = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.65–0.92, P = 0.003) and expressed an increased likelihood of help-seeking from health professionals than the UMI group (all P < .05). Conclusion The ability to recognize mental illness without identifying the disease may increase help-seeking from friends, while the ability to identify the disease as schizophrenia might decrease late adolescents’ help-seeking. To promote help-seeking behavior among adolescents, improving their ability to recognize mental illness generally is recommended."

New York Times columnist and science writer Carl Zimmer discusses the challenges of effectively communicating with the public about science. As a science writer, I often start my day with some words from scientists. Sometimes those words are in a new scientific paper. But very often they come in other forms. I check my RSS reader for new blog posts from scientists such as paleoanthropologist John Hawks and virologist Vincent Racaniello. I check in on Twitter, where geneticist Daniel Macarthur may point to an interesting new study or dispense some snark on a hyperventilating newspaper article. If I’m feeling a deep urge to procrastinate, I may head to YouTube to watch cosmologist Sean Carroll explain the arrow of time. When that’s over, I may glance at the podcast app on my phone to see if there’s a new episode of Story Collider—a series made up mostly of scientists telling stories before a live audience. As I listen, I might get distracted by a thump outside the front door: a review copy of a new book written by a scientist—perhaps Frans de Waal writing about animal cognition or Bryan Fry writing about snake venom. It wasn’t always like this. When I started my career in the early 1990s, few scientists showed much interest in engaging with an audience, unless it was a group of scientists at a conference or a herd of undergraduates in a lecture hall. I asked some of them about their disinterest, and they told me that they didn’t see communicating science to the public as part of their job description. They viewed science as a kind of monastic occupation, separate from worldly affairs. There may have been other scientists who yearned to communicate with the public, but in the early 1990s they had very few options. They might try to submit an essay to the handful of magazines that would consider writing from a scientist. Television and other forms of media were simply off limits to scientists, unless their name was Carl Sagan. Many factors have brought us from there to here. Advances in technology turned the Internet into a public square. Scientists no longer had to wait for permission to be published; they could start a blog or plunge into social media. Professional-quality cameras and microphones made it possible for scientists to record their own videos or podcasts. Those tools would have lain idle if scientists didn’t develop a strong urge to use them. I first became aware of that urge in the early 2000s, when I started reading blogs by scientists. In many cases, their posts were fueled by frustration. They would read misleading coverage in newspapers and magazines and feel the urge to set the record straight. As a journalist, I greatly appreciated these blogs; they made me keenly aware of the hidden traps of our profession. Frustration was not their only motivation. They also wanted to share their science with the rest of the world—a noble undertaking sometimes given the dreary label of “outreach.” In 2007, I began to observe this passion up close when I was asked by the Yale Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Department to design a short science-writing workshop for graduate students. At first we thought a handful of students would register. Instead, over fifty people signed up. I’ve taught the workshop every year since, and that level of enthusiasm has not shown any sign of flagging. These budding scientists, I’ve found, are motivated by a mix of joy and fear. They want other people to understand what it is about a subatomic particle or a particular species of tree frog that inspires them to dedicate their lives to understanding it. At the same time, many of them worry that their very survival as scientists depends on helping the public understand the value of their work. They can see how politicians advance their careers by claiming that basic scientists waste public funds or by accusing climate scientists of outright fraud (Roberts, 2015). No longer can they sequester themselves in their labs and field sites, unconcerned with what happens in the outside world. Whatever their intentions may be, however, scientists cannot simply wake up one morning and decide to create the next Lives of A Cell. Writing about science (or drawing science animations or recording science podcasts) is a skill that takes time to develop. Of course, all scientists do a lot of writing, in the form of scientific papers, grant proposals, and lecture notes. But there are some important differences between scientific writing and the kind of writing other people actually want to read when they are perfectly free to do something else with their free time. We can start with the individual words that we choose. Scientists learn to rely on technical jargon, and for very good reason: it’s an efficient way for two people steeped in expert knowledge to discuss complex concepts. But jargon becomes a hindrance when scientists try to communicate with anyone else—even other scientists. How many biochemists understand the jargon of astrophysics, or vice versa? “Readers can be very clever,” observes the biologist Robert Dunn, “but it is not their job to know all of the words that you and the twelve people you call colleagues made up” (Dunn, 2013). Some scientists have bristled when I’ve suggested they step away from their jargon. They’ve retorted that it’s condescending to the reader, who can always look up an obscure word in a dictionary. I think they overlook just how much knowledge is bundled up in the jargon of science. If readers need to look up ubiquitination, they will learn that it’s an enzymatic process that involves the bonding of an ubiquitin protein to a substrate protein. They may need then to look up ubiquitin—and perhaps even substrate. Instead of sending a reader back and forth through a dictionary, writers ought to help a lay reader develop an admiration for the marvel of ubiquitination—the way in which cells can destroy themselves so as to rebuild themselves anew. Rather than rely on jargon, in other words, writers should try to unfold concepts for their readers. Jargon is the most obvious manifestation of a broader challenge in science writing: making sense. In his recent book The Sense of Style, cognitive scientist Steven Pinker warns scientists of something he calls the Curse of Knowledge. “The main cause of incomprehensible prose,” he writes, “is the difficulty of imagining what it’s like for someone else not to know something that you know.” This curse applies not just to the individual words that people choose, but the ways in which they structure explanations and entire narratives. It’s incumbent on writers to be always mindful of the reader and the fact that the reader cannot gain access to their brains. All a reader can rely on are the words on the page. It can be tempting to respond to the Curse of Knowledge by burying readers in information. If there’s something unclear in a story, just add another paragraph. But more information does not equal more insight. In fact, a lot of the information people usually add is only loosely connected to the main point of their piece. The best cure for the Curse of Knowledge is to take precisely the opposite strategy. Writers should ask themselves, what is the bare minimum that they need to include in a piece for it to work? To answer this question, writers need to figure out what their piece is about—what story they are trying to tell. Once they identify that, everything else can fall away. I’m always happy to talk to scientists about these matters. But recently I’ve gotten a bit leery about just how far their enthusiasm for communication is getting. I’m noticing a trend in pieces with headlines such as “Why Scientists Should Write for the Public” and “Science and the Public: Why Every Lab Should Tweet.” Note the use of the word should. That word transforms a voluntary act of joy into a dreaded mandatory task. Expecting all scientists to engage with the public non-stop also ignores some fundamental facts about science communication in the twenty-first century. For one thing, your average reader is drowning in an ocean of things to read, watch, and listen to. A professional science news site like Scientific American or Nature may pump out a dozen pieces of original reporting every day. If you want to watch TED talks about science, there’s well over 100 hours of video waiting for you. While I enjoy learning about scientific developments on Twitter, there are moments when I look away from the stream of tweets and realize to my shock that my morning has vanished. There’s a parallel explosion taking place in the scientific literature. By one estimate, global scientific output is doubling every nine years. PubMed added 698,051 papers published in 2005. In 2015, it added 1,213,348. That translates to a new paper coming out every 26 seconds. Even if I were to spend my entire working day with the words of scientists, I wouldn’t be able to learn about more than a minuscule fraction of the research coming out each year. The push to capture the public’s scarce attention brings with it the risk of hype. Hype is already a serious problem in science journalism, and there are worry signs that it’s infecting scientific publications as well. One 2015 study found that the frequency of positive-sounding words like “amazing” and “unprecedented” has increased almost nine-fold in the titles and abstracts of papers published between 1974 and 2014 (Ball, 2015). It would be a shame for scientists to add to the hype by crafting clickbait. None of this should scare away scientists who want to follow in the footsteps of Peter Medawar or Neil deGrasse Tyson or Emily Graslie. If they feel this calling, they should follow it. But they should do so while being mindful of the cacophonous world in which we all move today.
