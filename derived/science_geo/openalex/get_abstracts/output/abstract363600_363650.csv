https://openalex.org/W1992721127,"The endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) system is essential for multivesicular body biogenesis, in which cargo sorting is coupled to the invagination and scission of intralumenal vesicles. The ESCRTs are also needed for budding of enveloped viruses including human immunodeficiency virus 1, and for membrane abscission in cytokinesis. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, ESCRT-III consists of Vps20, Snf7, Vps24 and Vps2 (also known as Did4), which assemble in that order and require the ATPase Vps4 for their disassembly. In this study, the ESCRT-III-dependent budding and scission of intralumenal vesicles into giant unilamellar vesicles was reconstituted and visualized by fluorescence microscopy. Here we show that three subunits of ESCRT-III, Vps20, Snf7 and Vps24, are sufficient to detach intralumenal vesicles. Vps2, the ESCRT-III subunit responsible for recruiting Vps4, and the ATPase activity of Vps4 were required for ESCRT-III recycling and supported additional rounds of budding. The minimum set of ESCRT-III and Vps4 proteins capable of multiple cycles of vesicle detachment corresponds to the ancient set of ESCRT proteins conserved from archaea to animals."
https://openalex.org/W2087668602,"Activated antigen-specific T cells produce a variety of effector molecules for clearing infection but also contribute to inflammation and tissue injury. Here we report an anti-inflammatory property of antiviral CD8+ and CD4+ effector T cells (T(eff) cells) in the infected periphery during acute virus infection. We find that, during acute influenza infection, interleukin-10 (IL-10) is produced in the infected lungs in large amounts--exclusively by infiltrating virus-specific T(eff) cells, with CD8+ T(eff) cells contributing a larger fraction of the IL-10 produced. These T(eff) cells in the periphery simultaneously produce IL-10 and proinflammatory cytokines and express lineage markers characteristic of conventional T helper type 1 or T cytotoxic type 1 cells. Notably, blocking the action of the T(eff) cell-derived IL-10 results in enhanced pulmonary inflammation and lethal injury. Our results show that antiviral T(eff) cells exert regulatory functions--that is, they fine-tune the extent of lung inflammation and injury associated with influenza infection by producing an anti-inflammatory cytokine. We discuss the potential implications of these findings for infection with highly pathogenic influenza viruses."
https://openalex.org/W2086391970,"Trudy Mackay and colleagues present a resource of 40 Drosophila melanogaster wild-derived inbred lines. The authors quantify genome-wide variation in transcript abundance for six ecologically relevant traits, characterize the transcriptome and identify transcriptional modules. Determining the genetic architecture of complex traits is challenging because phenotypic variation arises from interactions between multiple, environmentally sensitive alleles. We quantified genome-wide transcript abundance and phenotypes for six ecologically relevant traits in D. melanogaster wild-derived inbred lines. We observed 10,096 genetically variable transcripts and high heritabilities for all organismal phenotypes. The transcriptome is highly genetically intercorrelated, forming 241 transcriptional modules. Modules are enriched for transcripts in common pathways, gene ontology categories, tissue-specific expression and transcription factor binding sites. The high degree of transcriptional connectivity allows us to infer genetic networks and the function of predicted genes from annotations of other genes in the network. Regressions of organismal phenotypes on transcript abundance implicate several hundred candidate genes that form modules of biologically meaningful correlated transcripts affecting each phenotype. Overlapping transcripts in modules associated with different traits provide insight into the molecular basis of pleiotropy between complex traits."

Although the regulatory mechanisms and signalling pathways controlling DNA repair and apoptosis are well characterized, the precise molecular strategies that determine the ultimate choice of DNA repair and survival or apoptotic cell death remain incompletely understood. Here we report that a protein tyrosine phosphatase, EYA, is involved in promoting efficient DNA repair rather than apoptosis in response to genotoxic stress in mammalian embryonic kidney cells by executing a damage-signal-dependent dephosphorylation of an H2AX carboxy-terminal tyrosine phosphate (Y142). This post-translational modification determines the relative recruitment of either DNA repair or pro-apoptotic factors to the tail of serine phosphorylated histone H2AX (gamma-H2AX) and allows it to function as an active determinant of repair/survival versus apoptotic responses to DNA damage, revealing an additional phosphorylation-dependent mechanism that modulates survival/apoptotic decisions during mammalian organogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1982330320,"Integrins are the major adhesion receptors of leukocytes and platelets. Beta1 and beta2 integrin function on leukocytes is crucial for a successful immune response and the platelet integrin alpha(IIb)beta3 initiates the process of blood clotting through binding fibrinogen. Integrins on circulating cells bind poorly to their ligands but become active after 'inside-out' signaling through other membrane receptors. Subjects with leukocyte adhesion deficiency-1 (LAD-I) do not express beta2 integrins because of mutations in the gene specifying the beta2 subunit, and they suffer recurrent bacterial infections. Mutations affecting alpha(IIb)beta3 integrin cause the bleeding disorder termed Glanzmann's thrombasthenia. Subjects with LAD-III show symptoms of both LAD-I and Glanzmann's thrombasthenia. Their hematopoietically-derived cells express beta1, beta2 and beta3 integrins, but defective inside-out signaling causes immune deficiency and bleeding problems. The LAD-III lesion has been attributed to a C --> A mutation in the gene encoding calcium and diacylglycerol guanine nucleotide exchange factor (CALDAGGEF1; official symbol RASGRP2) specifying the CALDAG-GEF1 protein, but we show that this change is not responsible for the LAD-III disorder. Instead, we identify mutations in the KINDLIN3 (official symbol FERMT3) gene specifying the KINDLIN-3 protein as the cause of LAD-III in Maltese and Turkish subjects. Two independent mutations result in decreased KINDLIN3 messenger RNA levels and loss of protein expression. Notably, transfection of the subjects' lymphocytes with KINDLIN3 complementary DNA but not CALDAGGEF1 cDNA reverses the LAD-III defect, restoring integrin-mediated adhesion and migration."

https://openalex.org/W2042371636,"Monogenic deficiency diseases provide unique opportunities to define the contributions of individual molecules to human physiology and to identify pathologies arising from their dysfunction. Here we describe a deficiency disease in two human siblings that presented with severe bleeding, frequent infections and osteopetrosis at an early age. These symptoms are consistent with but more severe than those reported for people with leukocyte adhesion deficiency III (LAD-III). Mechanistically, these symptoms arose from an inability to activate the integrins expressed on hematopoietic cells, including platelets and leukocytes. Immortalized lymphocyte cell lines isolated from the two individuals showed integrin activation defects. Several proteins previously implicated in integrin activation, including Ras-associated protein-1 (RAP1) and calcium and diacylglycerol-regulated guanine nucleotide exchange factor-1 (CALDAG-GEF1), were present and functional in these cell lines. The genetic basis for this disease was traced to a point mutation in the coding region of the KINDLIN3 (official gene symbol FERMT3) gene. When wild-type KINDLIN-3 was expressed in the immortalized lymphocytes, their integrins became responsive to activation signals. These results identify a genetic disease that severely compromises the health of the affected individuals and establish an essential role of KINDLIN-3 in integrin activation in humans. Furthermore, allogeneic bone marrow transplantation was shown to alleviate the symptoms of the disease."
https://openalex.org/W2007066406,"Research into the biological role of the Ca(2+)-releasing second messenger NAADP (nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate) has been hampered by a lack of chemical probes. To find new chemical probes for exploring NAADP signaling, we turned to virtual screening, which can evaluate millions of molecules rapidly and inexpensively. We used NAADP as the query ligand to screen the chemical library ZINC for compounds with similar three-dimensional shape and electrostatic properties. We tested the top-ranking hits in a sea urchin egg bioassay and found that one hit, Ned-19, blocks NAADP signaling at nanomolar concentrations. In intact cells, Ned-19 blocked NAADP signaling and fluorescently labeled NAADP receptors. Moreover, we show the utility of Ned-19 as a chemical probe by using it to demonstrate that NAADP is a key causal link between glucose sensing and Ca(2+) increases in mouse pancreatic beta cells."
https://openalex.org/W2010357659,"Background Artemisinin combination treatments (ACT) are recommended as first line treatment for falciparum malaria throughout the malaria affected world. We reviewed the efficacy of a 3-day regimen of mefloquine and artesunate regimen (MAS3), over a 13 year period of continuous deployment as first-line treatment in camps for displaced persons and in clinics for migrant population along the Thai-Myanmar border. Methods and Findings 3,264 patients were enrolled in prospective treatment trials between 1995 and 2007 and treated with MAS3. The proportion of patients with parasitaemia persisting on day-2 increased significantly from 4.5% before 2001 to 21.9% since 2002 (p<0.001). Delayed parasite clearance was associated with increased risk of developing gametocytaemia (AOR = 2.29; 95% CI, 2.00–2.69, p = 0.002). Gametocytaemia on admission and carriage also increased over the years (p = 0.001, test for trend, for both). MAS3 efficacy has declined slightly but significantly (Hazards ratio 1.13; 95% CI, 1.07–1.19, p<0.001), although efficacy in 2007 remained well within acceptable limits: 96.5% (95% CI, 91.0–98.7). The in vitro susceptibility of P. falciparum to artesunate increased significantly until 2002, but thereafter declined to levels close to those of 13 years ago (geometric mean in 2007: 4.2 nM/l; 95% CI, 3.2–5.5). The proportion of infections caused by parasites with increased pfmdr1 copy number rose from 30% (12/40) in 1996 to 53% (24/45) in 2006 (p = 0.012, test for trend). Conclusion Artesunate-mefloquine remains a highly efficacious antimalarial treatment in this area despite 13 years of widespread intense deployment, but there is evidence of a modest increase in resistance. Of particular concern is the slowing of parasitological response to artesunate and the associated increase in gametocyte carriage."
https://openalex.org/W2139775939,"Senile graying of human hair has been the subject of intense research since ancient times. Reactive oxygen species have been implicated in hair follicle melanocyte apoptosis and DNA damage. Here we show for the first time by FT-Raman spectroscopy in vivo that human gray/white scalp hair shafts accumulate hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) in millimolar concentrations. Moreover, we demonstrate almost absent catalase and methionine sulfoxide reductase A and B protein expression via immunofluorescence and Western blot in association with a functional loss of methionine sulfoxide (Met-S=O) repair in the entire gray hair follicle. Accordingly, Met-S=O formation of Met residues, including Met 374 in the active site of tyrosinase, the key enzyme in melanogenesis, limits enzyme functionality, as evidenced by FT-Raman spectroscopy, computer simulation, and enzyme kinetics, which leads to gradual loss of hair color. Notably, under in vitro conditions, Met oxidation can be prevented by L-methionine. In summary, our data feed the long-voiced, but insufficiently proven, concept of H(2)O(2)-induced oxidative damage in the entire human hair follicle, inclusive of the hair shaft, as a key element in senile hair graying, which does not exclusively affect follicle melanocytes. This new insight could open new strategies for intervention and reversal of the hair graying process."
https://openalex.org/W2112666000,"Birt–Hogg–Dubé (BHD) syndrome is a tumor-suppressor gene disorder characterized by skin tumors, cystic lung disease and renal cell carcinoma. Very little is known about the molecular pathogenesis of BHD. Clinical similarities between BHD and tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) suggest that the BHD and TSC proteins may function within a common pathway. The TSC proteins inhibit the activity of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1), and in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Bhd and Tsc1/Tsc2 have opposing roles in the regulation of amino-acid homeostasis. We report here that in mammalian cells, downregulation of BHD reduces the phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6, an indicator of TORC1 activity. To determine whether folliculin, the product of the BHD gene, regulates mammalian target of rapamycin activity in vivo, we generated a mouse with targeted inactivation of the Bhd gene. The mice developed spontaneous oncocytic cysts and tumors composed of cells that resemble the renal cell carcinomas in BHD patients. The cysts and tumors had low levels of phospho-S6. Taken together, these data indicate that folliculin regulates the activity of TORC1, and suggest a new paradigm in which both inappropriately high and inappropriately low levels of TORC1 activity can be associated with renal tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2166447146,"We describe a system that permits conditional mobilization of a Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposase allele by Cre recombinase to induce cancer specifically in a tissue of interest. To demonstrate its potential for developing tissue-specific models of cancer in mice, we limit SB transposition to the liver by placing Cre expression under the control of an albumin enhancer/promoter sequence and screen for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)-associated genes. From 8,060 nonredundant insertions cloned from 68 tumor nodules and comparative analysis with data from human HCC samples, we identify 19 loci strongly implicated in causing HCC. These encode genes, such as EGFR and MET, previously associated with HCC and others, such as UBE2H, that are potential new targets for treating this neoplasm. Our system, which could be modified to drive transposon-based insertional mutagenesis wherever tissue-specific Cre expression is possible, promises to enhance understanding of cancer genomes and identify new targets for therapeutic development."
https://openalex.org/W1999088044,"The motility of cancer cells in 3D matrices is of two types: mesenchymal motility, in which the cells are elongated and amoeboid motility, in which the cells are round. Amoeboid motility is driven by an actomyosin-based contractile force, which is regulated by the Rho/ROCK pathway. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the motility of elongated cells remain unknown. Here, we show that the motility of elongated cells is regulated by Rac signaling through the WAVE2/Arp2/3-dependent formation of elongated pseudopodia and cell-substrate adhesion in 3D substrates. The involvement of Rac signaling in cell motility was different in cell lines that displayed an elongated morphology in 3D substrates. In U87MG glioblastoma cells, most of which exhibit mesenchymal motility, inhibition of Rac signaling blocked the invasion of these cells in 3D substrates. In HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells, which display mixed cell motility involving both elongated and rounded cells, inhibition of Rac1 signaling not only blocked mesenchymal motility but also caused a mesenchymal-amoeboid transition. Additionally, Rac1 and RhoA signaling regulated the mesenchymal and amoeboid motility in these cells, respectively, and the inhibition of both pathways dramatically decreased cell invasion. Hence, we could conclude that Rac1 and RhoA signaling simultaneously regulate cell invasion in 3D matrices."
https://openalex.org/W1997697061,"A genome-wide RNAi screen reveals the importance of local pH regulation during planar epithelial polarization. The plasma membrane association of the planar cell polarity components Dishevelled/Frizzled depends on the activity of the Na+/H+ membrane exchanger Nhe2. Dishevelled (Dsh) is a cytoplasmic multidomain protein that is required for all known branches of the Wnt signalling pathway1,2,3. The Frizzled/planar cell polarity (Fz/PCP) signalling branch requires an asymmetric cortical localization of Dsh, but this process remains poorly understood. Using a genome-wide RNA interference (RNAi) screen in Drosophila melanogaster cells, we show that Dsh membrane localization is dependent on the Na+/H+ exchange activity of the plasma membrane exchanger Nhe2. Manipulating Nhe2 expression levels in the eye causes PCP defects, and Nhe2 interacts genetically with Fz. Our data show that the binding and surface recruitment of Dsh by Fz is pH- and charge-dependent. We identify a polybasic stretch within the Dsh DEP domain that binds to negatively charged phospholipids and appears to be mechanistically important. Dsh recruitment by Fz can be abolished by converting these basic amino-acid residues into acidic ones, as in the mutant, DshKR/E. In vivo, the DshKR/E(2×) mutant with two substituted residues fails to associate with the membrane during active PCP signalling but rescues canonical Wnt signalling defects in a dsh-background. These results suggest that direct interaction between Fz and Dsh is stabilized by a pH and charge-dependent interaction of the DEP domain with phospholipids. This stabilization is particularly important for the PCP signalling branch and, thus, promotes specific pathway selection in Wnt signalling."
https://openalex.org/W2009927945,"HIV-1 is a master at deceiving the immune system and usurping host biosynthetic machinery. Although HIV-1 is coated with host-derived glycoproteins, only glycosylation of viral gp120 has been described. Here we use lectin microarray technology to analyze the glycome of intact HIV-1 virions. We show that the glycan coat of human T cell line–derived HIV-1 matches that of native immunomodulatory microvesicles. The carbohydrate composition of both virus and microvesicles is cell-line dependent, which suggests a mechanism to rapidly camouflage the virus within the host. In addition, binding of both virus and microvesicles to antiviral lectins is enriched over the host cell, raising concern about targeting these glycans for therapeutics. This work also sheds light on the binding of HIV-1 to galectin-1, an important human immune lectin. Overall, our work strongly supports the theory that HIV-1 co-opts the exocytic pathway of microvesicles, thus potentially explaining why eliciting a protective antiviral immune response is difficult."
https://openalex.org/W2086202782,"The adaptation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to situations in which cell wall integrity is seriously compromised mainly involves the cell wall integrity (CWI) pathway. However, in a recent work (Bermejo, C., Rodriguez, E., García, R., Rodríguez-Peña, J. M., Rodríguez de la Concepción, M. L., Rivas, C., Arias, P., Nombela, C., Posas, F., and Arroyo, J. (2008) Mol. Biol. Cell 19 1113-1124) we have demonstrated the co-participation of the high osmotic response (HOG) pathway to ensure yeast survival to cell wall stress mediated by zymolyase, which hydrolyzes the β-1,3 glucan network. Here we have characterized the role of both pathways in the regulation of the overall yeast transcriptional responses to zymolyase treatment using whole genome expression profiling. A main group of yeast genes is dependent on both MAPKs, Slt2 and Hog1, for their induction. The transcriptional activation of these genes depends on the MAPKKK Bck1, the transcription factor Rlm1, and elements of the sho1 branch of the HOG pathway, but not on the sensors of the CWI pathway. A second group of genes is dependent on Slt2 but not Hog1 or Pbs2. However, the induction of these genes is dependent on upstream elements of the HOG pathway such as Sho1, Ste50, and Ste11, in accordance with a sequential activation of the HOG and CWI pathways. Zymolyase also promotes an osmotic-like transcriptional response with the activation of a group of genes dependent on elements of the Sho1 branch of HOG pathway but not on Slt2, with the induction of many of them dependent on Msn2/4. Additionally, in the absence of Hog1, zymolyase induces an alternative response related to mating and filamentation as a consequence of the cross-talk between these pathways and the HOG pathway. Finally, in the absence of Slt2, zymolyase increases the induction of genes associated with osmotic adaptation with respect to the wild type, suggesting an inhibitory effect of the CWI pathway over the HOG pathway. These studies clearly reveal the complexity of the signal transduction machinery responsible for regulating yeast adaptation responses to cell wall stress.

These studies clearly reveal the complexity of the signal transduction machinery responsible for regulating yeast adaptation responses to cell wall stress. Yeast cell integrity depends on an external envelope, the cell wall, whose mechanical strength allows cells to support turgor pressure and affords them protection against extreme environmental conditions. Because this structure is essential for survival, stress conditions that alter the cell wall lead to the activation of a cellular response that allows cells to adapt and survive (2Levin D.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev... 2005; 69: 262-291Google Scholar, 3Popolo L. Gualtieri T. Ragni E. Med. Mycol... 2001; 39: 111-121Google Scholar). This response is mainly characterized by activation of a transcriptional adaptation program that been extensively studied in the last few years by means of DNA microarray experiments. Transcriptional responses in mutants deleted in genes that are important for cell wall biogenesis as well as those activated in the presence of cell wall-perturbing agents have been characterized (4Lagorce A.

Such responses include the transcriptional activation of specific genes for each particular stress condition but also the induction of a cluster of genes that are co-induced under all the conditions mentioned above. This common group of genes represents the transcriptional fingerprint of cell wall stress adaptation responses and includes mainly genes related to cell wall remodeling, metabolism, and signaling (5García R. Bermejo C. Grau C. Pérez R. Rodríguez-Peña J.M. Francois J. Nombela C. Arroyo J. J. Biol. Chem... 2004; 279: 15183-15195Google Scholar, 8Rodríguez-Peña J.M. Diéz-Muñiz S. Nombela C. Arroyo J.

The final consequences of these responses are an increase in the amount of several cell wall proteins (CWPs) synthesized by the cell, an increase in β-glucan and chitin contents, changes in the association among cell wall polymers, and the relocalization of important proteins from the cell wall construction machinery to the lateral cell wall, all of them required for proper cell wall remodeling under cell wall stressing circumstances. The regulation of these adaptive responses to cell wall stress is mainly mediated by the cell wall integrity pathway (see Ref. 2Levin D.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev... 2005; 69: 262-291Google Scholar for a recent review). A pair of membrane proteins, Mid2 and Wsc1, act as the main sensors of this pathway (9Ketela T. Green R. Bussey H. J.

Under conditions of activation, these sensors interact with the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Rom2, activating the small GTPase Rho1, which then interacts and activates Pkc1 (2Levin D.E.

The main role of activated Pkc1 is to trigger a MAPK 3The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MAPKK, MAPK kinase; MAPKKK, MAPK kinase kinase; WT, wild type; RT, reverse transcription; qPCR, quantitative PCR; HOG, high osmotic response; CWI, cell wall integrity. module. Phosphorylation of the MAPKKK Bck1 activates a pair of redundant MAPKKs (Mkk1 and Mkk2), which finally phosphorylate the MAPK Slt2. The phosphorylated form of this protein acts mainly on two transcription factors: the MCM1-Agamous-Deficiens-serum response factor box transcription factor Rlm1 (11Watanabe Y. Takaesu G. Hagiwara M. Irie K. Matsumoto K. Mol. Cell. Biol... 1997; 17: 2615-2623Google Scholar) and SCB binding factor (12Baetz K. Moffat J. Haynes J. Chang M. Andrews B. Mol. Cell.

The transcriptional activation of most genes induced in response to Congo Red and heat shock, both of them stresses activating this pathway, mainly depends on Rlm1 (5García R. Bermejo C. Grau C.

This activation is responsible for the transcriptional program described above that finally allows cells to become adapted. However, differences in the regulation of cell wall stress responses have been found, depending on the actual type of cell wall stress. We have recently shown that in contrast to the yeast transcriptional response to Congo Red, which depends almost completely on the MAPK Slt2 and the transcription factor Rlm1 (5García R. Bermejo C. Grau C. Pérez R. Rodríguez-Peña J.M. Francois J. Nombela C. Arroyo J. J. Biol. Chem... 2004; 279: 15183-15195Google Scholar), adaptation to cell wall stress caused by zymolyase requires the participation of both the cell wall integrity (CWI) and the high osmotic response (HOG) pathways (1Bermejo C. Rodríguez E. García R. Rodríguez-Peña J.M. Rodríguez de la Concepción M.L. Rivas C. Arias P. Nombela C. Posas F. Arroyo J. Mol. Biol. Cell.. 2008; 19: 1113-1124Google Scholar). Cellular responses to this stress require essential components of the CWI pathway, namely, the redundant MAPKKs Mkk1/Mkk2, the MAPKKK Bck1, and Pkc1, but they do not require upstream elements, including the sensors Mid2 and Wsc1 and the guanine nucleotide exchange factors of this pathway (1Bermejo C.

Moreover, activation of the MAPK of the CWI pathway (Slt2) depends on the elements of the Sho1 branch of the HOG pathway (i.e. Sho1, Ste20, Ste50, Ste11, and Pbs2), and it is blocked in a double mutant strain in which genes encoding the mucin-like proteins Msb2 and Hkr1, recently described as potential osmosensors of the Sho1 branch of the HOG pathway (17Tatebayashi K.

Therefore, zymolyase-mediated cell wall damage should be sensed through the Sho1 branch of the HOG pathway, leading to the sequential activation of the MAPK Slt2 of the CWI pathway, which in turns activates the transcription factor Rlm1 (1Bermejo C.

Transcriptional activation of CRH1, one of the targets of the cell wall stress response that encodes a transglycosidase activity responsible for Chitin-β-1,6 glucan cross-linking (18Rodríguez-Peña J.M. Cid V.J. Arroyo J. Nombela C. Mol. Cell. Biol... 2000; 20: 3245-3255Google Scholar, 19Cabib E. Blanco N. Grau C. Rodríguez-Peña J.M. Arroyo J. Mol.

Chem... 2008; 283: 29859-29872Google Scholar), by zymolyase requires this connection between the HOG and CWI pathways (1Bermejo C. Rodríguez E. García R. Rodríguez-Peña J.M. Rodríguez de la Concepción M.L. Rivas C. Arias P. Nombela C. Posas F. Arroyo J. Mol. Biol. Cell.. 2008; 19: 1113-1124Google Scholar). Here, to globally characterize how yeast regulates transcriptional responses to damage to the β-1,3 glucan network caused by zymolyase and to investigate the role of the CWI and HOG pathways in this regulation in more detail, genome-wide transcriptional responses to zymolyase were characterized in Saccharomyces cerevisiae wild type and mutant strains deleted in different elements of both pathways by using DNA microarrays. Data analysis revealed a complex level of regulation of these responses and a completely collaborative participation of both pathways to assess cell integrity under these cell wall stress circumstances. Yeast Strains—All of the experiments were performed with the S. cerevisiae BY4741 strain (MATa, his3Δ1, leu2Δ0, met15Δ0, ura3Δ0) and mutant derivatives provided by Euroscarf (Frankfurt, Germany). Single mutant strains present the corresponding gene completely deleted and replaced by the geneticin resistance-codifying KanMX4 module. The yeast strains used in this work were: sho1Δ, ste50Δ, ste11Δ, ssk1Δ, pbs2Δ, hog1Δ, wsc1Δ, mid2Δ, bck1Δ, slt2Δ, rlm1Δ, fus3Δ, and kss1Δ. The double mutants hog1Δslt2Δ (strain CR001) and msn2Δmsn4Δ (RG001) have been described previously (1Bermejo C. Rodríguez E. García R. Rodríguez-Peña J.M. Rodríguez de la Concepción M.L. Rivas C. Arias P. Nombela C. Posas F. Arroyo J. Mol. Biol. Cell.. 2008; 19: 1113-1124Google Scholar). Culture Conditions—Depending on the experimental approaches used, yeast cells were grown on YPD (2% glucose, 2% peptone, 1% yeast extract) or SD medium (0.17% yeast nitrogen base, 0.5% ammonium sulfate, 2% glucose) supplemented with the required amino acids. For routine cultures, yeast cells were grown overnight at 24 °C to an optical density of 0.8-1 (A600). The culture was refreshed to optical density of 0.2 at 600 nm and grown at 24 °C for 3 h. Next, the culture was divided into two parts. One part was allowed to continue growing under the same conditions (the non-treated culture) while the other one was supplemented with zymolyase from Arthrobacter luteus (MP Biomedicals, Inc.) to a final concentration of 0.8 unit/ml. The cells were collected at the indicated times and processed, depending on the experimental approach, as described below. Plasmids—To obtain the collection of plasmids bearing transcriptional fusions to the LacZ gene used in this work, we replaced the 1.1-kb fragment (EcoRI/BamHI) containing the promoter of CRH1 from the pCRH1-LACZ plasmid (1Bermejo C. Rodríguez E. García R. Rodríguez-Peña J.M. Rodríguez de la Concepción M.L. Rivas C. Arias P. Nombela C. Posas F. Arroyo J. Mol. Biol. Cell.. 2008; 19: 1113-1124Google Scholar) by the promoter region of selected genes obtained from genomic DNA by PCR amplification (the oligonucleotide sequences are available upon request). Thus, the following plasmids were generated: pAFR1-LacZ (-842/-7), pSED1-LacZ (-999/-1), pCWP1-LacZ (-978/-5), pMLP1-LacZ (-1186/-1), pHOR2-LacZ (-954/-19), and pHSP12-LacZ (-589/+9). The numbers in parentheses indicate the upstream fragment with respect to the open reading frame start codon used for each gene. β-Galactosidase Assays—Yeast cell extracts were prepared by harvesting cells by centrifugation from 5 ml of an exponentially growing culture. Then the cells were resuspended in 250 μl of breaking buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH.8, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol), and glass beads (Glasperlen ca. 1 mm, Sartorius AG, Germany) were added to break cells in a Fast-Prep system (FP120/BIO101 ThermoSavant). Finally, extracts were clarified by centrifugation, and protein concentrations were measured using the Bradford method. β-Galactosidase assays were performed using the crude extracts obtained as described previously (21Amberg D.C. Burke D.J. Strathern J.N. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Course Manual.John Inglis, Cold Spring Harbor, NY. 2005; Google Scholar), scaling the protocol to a 96-well microtiter plate format. 10 μl of cell extract was mixed with 90 μl of Z buffer plus β-mercaptoethanol (0.03%) and 20 μl of o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (4 mg/ml in Z buffer). The absorbance of the enzymatic reaction was measured at 415 nm on a microplate reader (model 680; Bio-Rad) after at least 10 min of incubation at 30 °C and the addition of 50 μl of 1 m Na2CO3 to stop the reaction. β-Galactosidase activity was expressed as nmoles of o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside converted/min/mg of protein. The experiments were performed at least in triplicate from independent yeast transformants. RNA Isolation, cDNA Synthesis, and Chip Hybridization—Total RNA was isolated from exponentially growing cells (5 × 108) with the ""mechanical disruption protocol"" using the RNeasy MIDI kit (Qiagen), following the instructions of the manufacturer. RNA concentrations were determined by measuring absorbance at 260 nm. RNA purity and integrity were assessed using RNA Nano Labchips in an Agilent 2100B Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions. Next, cDNA was synthesized from 25-30 μg of total RNA by reverse transcription using the CyScribe™ post-labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences), incorporating Cy3-dUTP or Cy5-dUTP into the cDNA corresponding to each sample to be compared. Both labeled cDNA populations were combined, dried in a vacuum trap, and used as a hybridization probe after resuspension in 15 μl of hybridization solution (50% formamide, 6× SSC, 0.5% SDS, 5× Denhardt's solution, 20 μg of poly(A) (P-9403; Sigma), and 100 μg/ml salmon sperm (Invitrogen). The printed microarrays, including the complete set of 6306 open reading frames coded by the S. cerevisiae genome, used in this study were provided by the Microarray Centre of the University Health Network, Toronto, Canada. The slides were prehybridized in prehybridization solution (6× SSC, 0.5% SDS, 1% bovine serum albumin (A-7906; Sigma)) for 1 h and were then hybridized overnight with labeled probe at 42 °C in a Lucidea SlidePro Automated Hybridization Station (Amersham Biosciences). Before scanning, the chips were washed and dried in the Hybridization Station. For each condition tested, comparison of treated and untreated samples, the total RNA from two different cultures was analyzed, and in addition, for each sample two different hybridizations were performed, including fluorochrome swapping to minimize transcriptional changes because of technical variability (7Rodríguez-Peña J.M. Pérez-Díaz R.M. Alvarez S. Bermejo C. García R. Santiago C. Nombela C. Arroyo J. Microbiology.. 2005; 151: 2241-2249Google Scholar). This therefore corresponded to four DNA microarrays analyzed for each condition. Microarray Image Analysis, Data Processing, and Statistical Methods—All of these processes were basically carried out following the protocols described previously by García et al. (5García R. Bermejo C. Grau C. Pérez R. Rodríguez-Peña J.M. Francois J. Nombela C. Arroyo J. J. Biol. Chem... 2004; 279: 15183-15195Google Scholar). The genes were considered to be up- or down-regulated when their expression ratio under the conditions tested was >2 or <0.5, respectively. To determine whether the gene induction observed in the wild type strain after treatment with zymolyase was blocked, in the mutant strains used along this work we used the relationship between the responses of each mutant versus those of the wild type strain. Thus, a value of mutant ratio/wild type ratio of 0.65 was considered the threshold for defining a significant reduction in gene induction. In any case, genes whose ratio (zymolyase ±) was <1.6 in any of the mutant backgrounds tested were deemed as not being up-regulated. Clustering analysis was performed using MEV (Multiexperiment viewer) version 4.2 software from TIGR (22Saeed A.I. Sharov V. White J. Li J. Liang W. Bhagabati N. Braisted J. Klapa M. Currier T.

The microarray data described here follow the minimum information about a microarray experiment recommendations and have been deposited at the NCBI gene expression and hybridization array data repository with accession numbers GSM248993, GSM248994, GSM248995, GSM249020, GSM249086, GSM249088, GSM249091, GSM249098, GSM249099, GSM249101, GSM249103, GSM249104, GSM249105, GSM249106, GSM249125, GSM249126, GSM249127, GSM249128, GSE9930, GSE9931, GSE9932, GSE9933, GSE9934, and GSE12684. Promoter Analysis—The YEASTRACT program was used to find associations between transcription factors and genes induced under the conditions studied (23Teixeira M.C. Monteiro P. Jain P. Tenreiro S. Fernandes A.R. Mira N.P. Alenquer M. Freitas A.T. Oliveira A.L. Sa-Correia I. Nucleic Acids Res... 2006; 34: D446-D451Google Scholar). Documented associations between a transcription factor and target gene are supported by published data concerning: (i) a change in the expression of the target gene caused by a deletion (or mutation) in the gene encoding transcription factor and (ii) binding of the transcription factor to the promoter region of the target gene, as supported by band shift, footprinting, or chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Potential associations between a transcription factor and a target gene are based on the occurrence of the transcription factor-binding site in the promoter region of the target gene. Quantitative RT-PCR Assays—Total RNA was isolated from cells (5 × 107) with the mechanical disruption protocol using the RNeasy MINI kit (Qiagen), following the manufacturer's instructions. RNA concentration, purity, and integrity were determined as described above. Real time RT-qPCR assays were performed as previously described (5García R. Bermejo C. Grau C. Pérez R. Rodríguez-Peña J.M. Francois J. Nombela C. Arroyo J. J. Biol. Chem... 2004; 279: 15183-15195Google Scholar), using an ABI 7700 instrument (Applied Biosystems). For quantification, the abundance of each gene was determined using the amount of the standard transcript of ACT1 for input cDNA normalization, and the final data on relative gene expression between the two conditions tested were calculated following the 2-ΔΔCt method, as described by Livak and Schmittgen (24Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods.. 2001; 25: 402-408Google Scholar). The primer sequences are available upon request. Transcriptional Profiles of WT, slt2Δ, and hog1Δ Cells in Response to Zymolyase Treatment—The finding that the transcriptional activation of CRH1 by zymolyase was dependent on both pathways, the CWI and HOG pathways (1Bermejo C. Rodríguez E. García R. Rodríguez-Peña J.M. Rodríguez de la Concepción M.L. Rivas C. Arias P. Nombela C. Posas F. Arroyo J. Mol. Biol. Cell.. 2008; 19: 1113-1124Google Scholar), prompted us to study whether this dual regulation was unique to CRH1 or, as expected, a general mechanism for regulating gene expression responses to this specific cell wall stress. To accomplish this, using DNA microarrays we characterized the global pattern of yeast gene expression after zymolyase treatment in WT cells as well as in strains deleted in SLT2, encoding the MAPK of the CWI pathway and HOG1, which encodes the MAPK of the HOG pathway. In a previous work (5García R. Bermejo C. Grau C. Pérez R. Rodríguez-Peña J.M. Francois J. Nombela C. Arroyo J. J. Biol. Chem... 2004; 279: 15183-15195Google Scholar) we described the transcriptome of wild type yeasts in the presence of several cell wall stresses, including 5 units/ml of zymolyase. However, the mutant strains slt2Δ and hog1Δ proved to be hypersensitive to this concentration of zymolyase, so we repeated these experiments using a concentration of zymolyase compatible with the growth of these mutants (0.8 unit/ml). First, the global pattern of gene expression of a wild type strain BY4741 growing in the absence or presence of 0.8 unit/ml for 3 h was determined. At this concentration, 77 genes were induced, and 10 were repressed by zymolyase treatment. As shown in Fig. 1, the main functional groups of genes include cell wall biogenesis, metabolism, signal transduction, stress, transport, and morphogenesis. Moreover, the response at 0.8 unit/ml was very similar to that observed at 5 units/ml (5García R. Bermejo C. Grau C. Pérez R. Rodríguez-Peña J.M. Francois J. Nombela C. Arroyo J. J. Biol. Chem... 2004; 279: 15183-15195Google Scholar) (see supplemental Table S1 for details). We then addressed the involvement of the HOG and CWI pathways in the regulation of this response. Strains slt2Δ and hog1Δ were grown in the presence of 0.8 unit/ml of zymolyase for 3 h, and their transcriptional profiles were analyzed using DNA microarrays. The ratio of expression for each gene in the wild type and mutant strains was calculated, and levels of Hog1 and Slt2 dependence were established as described under ""Experimental Procedures.” On the basis of the dependence on these MAPKs for their induction, the genes induced by zymolyase in a WT strain were classified in three different groups (Fig. 1). A main group, including 34 genes, was found to be dependent on both the Slt2 and Hog1 MAPKs. A second group of 13 genes were dependent on Slt2 but not on Hog1. A third group of 29 genes proved to be dependent on the MAPK Hog1 but not on Slt2. Finally, an additional gene (YNL208W) was neither dependent on Hog1 nor Slt2. The gene expression data of 18 of the 77 genes, belonging to the different groups, were checked by RT-qPCR to validate the microarray results. A very good correlation was found between both data sets (supplemental Table S2), except for slight variations in the case of BGL2, PRY2, YHR097C, and ALD3. The details of the gene expression data, based on microarrays and RT-qPCR experiments, together with a clustering analysis to visualize the different groups based on the dependence on the Slt2 and Hog1 MAPKs, are shown in Fig. 1. To predict potential transcription factors involved in the regulation of the response, genes included in the different groups were analyzed for documented regulatory associations using YEASTRACT (see ""Experimental Procedures”). The main regulatory associations are shown in Table 1.Table 1Regulatory associations for genes included in the genome-wide transcriptional response to zymolyase Transcription factor DRA TF-binding sites % % Slt2-dependent genes Ste12 69.2 30.8 Tec1 53.8 38.5 Swi4 53.8 23.1 Rlm1 46.2 69.2 Slt2/Hog1-dependent genes Rlm1 67.6 67.6 Sok2 50.0 50.0 Hog1-dependent genes Sok2 82.8 34.5 Met4 75.9 13.8 Msn4 69.0 86.2 Msn2 65.5 86.2 Yap1 65.5 31.0 Aft1 62.1 10.3 Cst6 58.6 24.1 Hsf1 51.7 27.6 Alternative genes induced in hog1Δ Ste12 78.4 63.5 Tec1 52.9 34.6 Sok2 52.9 46.2 Alternative genes induced in slt2Δ Sok2 73.3 43.3 Yap1 63.3 33.3 Msn4p 56.7 86.7 Msn2p 56.7 86.7 Rpn4 56.7 0.0 Aft1 53.3 1.0 Met4 50.0 3.3 Open table in a new tab Genes Regulated by Slt2 and Hog1—The genomic approach described above allowed us to conclude that dual regulation by the Slt2 and Hog1 MAPKs in response to zymolyase was not exclusive to CRH1 but that it functioned for many other yeast genes (see Fig. 1 for details). As expected, many of the genes within this group (67.6%) were potentially regulated by Rlm1 (Table 1). Using DNA microarrays, the transcriptional profile of an rlm1Δ strain growing in the presence of 0.8 unit/ml zymolyase was determined and compared with the profile of the WT growing under the same conditions. The results from this analysis are shown in Fig. 1. Considering the same threshold as that used in the analysis of hog1Δ and slt2Δ strains to define the dependence of the induction of each gene on these MAPKs, the whole set of genes included in the groups of Slt2/Hog1- and Slt2-dependent genes was also dependent on Rlm1 for induction. In contrast, as expected only the induction of four genes within the group of Hog1-dependent genes but not Slt2-dependent genes, MSC1, YLR414C, HOR7, and YHR033W, was dependent on Rlm1 (Fig. 1). We have previously shown that the induction of CRH1, one of the genes included in the group of Slt2/Hog1-dependent genes, by zymolyase requires essential elements of the CWI pathway, including Rho1, Pkc1, Bck1, Mkk1/Mkk2, Slt2, and the transcription factor Rlm1, as well as elements of the Sho1 branch of the HOG pathway such as Hog1, Pbs2, Ste11, Ste20, Ste50, and Sho1, but not the transcription factors regulated by Hog1 such as Hot1, Msn2/4, Sko1, or Smp1 (1Bermejo C.

Because Rlm1 was required for transcriptional activation of the whole set of these genes within this group, the most likely hypothesis was that all these genes were being regulated by the same mechanism as"

Affected birds had a slimy yellow-green material on their feathers, which were saturated with water, and they were severely hypothermic. We determined that foam containing surfactant-like proteins, derived from organic matter of the red tide, coated their feathers and neutralized natural water repellency and insulation. No evidence of exposure to petroleum or other oils or biotoxins were found. This is the first documented case of its kind, but previous similar events may have gone undetected. The frequency and amplitude of red tides have increased in Monterey Bay since 2004, suggesting that impacts on wintering marine birds may continue or increase."
https://openalex.org/W2003099132,"Most mutations that delay aging and prolong lifespan in the mouse are related to somatotropic and/or insulin signaling. Calorie restriction (CR) is the only intervention that reliably increases mouse longevity. There is considerable phenotypic overlap between long-lived mutant mice and normal mice on chronic CR. Therefore, we investigated the interactive effects of CR and targeted disruption or knock out of the growth hormone receptor (GHRKO) in mice on longevity and the insulin signaling cascade. Every other day feeding corresponds to a mild (i.e. 15%) CR which increased median lifespan in normal mice but not in GHRKO mice corroborating our previous findings on the effects of moderate (30%) CR on the longevity of these animals. To determine why insulin sensitivity improves in normal but not GHRKO mice in response to 30% CR, we conducted insulin stimulation experiments after one year of CR. In normal mice, CR increased the insulin stimulated activation of the insulin signaling cascade (IR/IRS/PI3K/AKT) in liver and muscle. Livers of GHRKO mice responded to insulin by increased activation of the early steps of insulin signaling, which was dissipated by altered PI3K subunit abundance which putatively inhibited AKT activation. In the muscle of GHRKO mice, there was elevated downstream activation of the insulin signaling cascade (IRS/PI3K/AKT) in the absence of elevated IR activation. Further, we found a major reduction of inhibitory Ser phosphorylation of IRS-1 seen exclusively in GHRKO muscle which may underpin their elevated insulin sensitivity. Chronic CR failed to further modify the alterations in insulin signaling in GHRKO mice as compared to normal mice, likely explaining or contributing to the absence of CR effects on insulin sensitivity and longevity in these long-lived mice."
https://openalex.org/W1982450147,"Activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) inhibits protein synthesis through the suppression of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), a critical regulator of muscle growth. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the role of the AMPKalpha1 catalytic subunit on muscle cell size control and adaptation to muscle hypertrophy. We found that AMPKalpha1(-/-) primary cultured myotubes and myofibers exhibit larger cell size compared with control cells in response to chronic Akt activation. We next subjected the plantaris muscle of AMPKalpha1(-/-) and control mice to mechanical overloading to induce muscle hypertrophy. We observed significant elevations of AMPKalpha1 activity in the control muscle at days 7 and 21 after the overload. Overloading-induced muscle hypertrophy was significantly accelerated in AMPKalpha1(-/-) mice than in control mice [+32 vs. +53% at day 7 and +57 vs. +76% at day 21 in control vs. AMPKalpha1(-/-) mice, respectively]. This enhanced growth of AMPKalpha1-deficient muscle was accompanied by increased phosphorylation of mTOR signaling downstream targets and decreased phosphorylation of eukaryotic elongation factor 2. These results demonstrate that AMPKalpha1 plays an important role in limiting skeletal muscle overgrowth during hypertrophy through inhibition of the mTOR-signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2034174983,"Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) patients treated with imatinib mesylate (IM) become drug resistant by mutations within the kinase domain of Bcr–Abl, and by other changes that cause progression to advanced stage (blast crisis) and increased expression of the Lyn tyrosine kinase, the regulation of which is not understood yet. In Bcr–Abl+ cells inhibition of Jak2, a downstream target of Bcr–Abl, by either Jak2 inhibitors or Jak2-specific short interfering RNA (siRNA) reduced the level of the SET protein, and increased PP2A Ser/Thr phosphatase and Shp1 tyrosine phosphatase activities, which led to decreased levels of activated Lyn. Activation of PP2A combined with Jak2 inhibition enhanced the reduction of activated Lyn kinase compared with Jak2 inhibition alone. In contrast, inhibition of either PP2A or Shp1 combined with Jak2 inhibition interfered with the loss of Lyn kinase activation more so than Jak2 inhibition alone, indicating the involvement of PP2A and Shp1 in the inactivation of the Lyn kinase caused by Jak2 inhibition. Inhibition of Jak2 induced apoptosis and reduced colony formation in IM-sensitive and -resistant Bcr–Abl mutant cell lines. Jak2 inhibition also induced apoptosis in CML cells from blast crisis patients but not in normal hematopoietic cells. These results indicate that Lyn is downstream of Jak2, and Jak2 maintains activated Lyn kinase in CML through the SET–PP2A–Shp1 pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2153947452,"Calsequestrin-1 (CASQ1) is a moderate-affinity, high-capacity Ca(2+)-binding protein in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) terminal cisternae of skeletal muscle. CASQ1 functions as both a Ca(2+)-binding protein and a luminal regulator of ryanodine receptor (RYR1)-mediated Ca(2+) release. Mice lacking skeletal CASQ1 are viable but exhibit reduced levels of releasable Ca(2+) and altered contractile properties. Here we report that CASQ1-null mice exhibit increased spontaneous mortality and susceptibility to heat- and anesthetic-induced sudden death. Exposure of CASQ1-null mice to either 2% halothane or heat stress triggers lethal episodes characterized by whole-body contractures, elevated core temperature, and severe rhabdomyolysis, which are prevented by prior dantrolene administration. The characteristics of these events are remarkably similar to analogous episodes observed in humans with malignant hyperthermia (MH) and animal models of MH and environmental heat stroke (EHS). In vitro studies indicate that CASQ1-null muscle exhibits increased contractile sensitivity to temperature and caffeine, temperature-dependent increases in resting Ca(2+), and an increase in the magnitude of depolarization-induced Ca(2+) release. These results demonstrate that CASQ1 deficiency alters proper control of RYR1 function and suggest CASQ1 as a potential candidate gene for linkage analysis in families with MH/EHS where mutations in the RYR1 gene are excluded."
https://openalex.org/W2064171774,"The exponential increase of published biomedical literature prompts the use of text mining tools to manage the information overload automatically. One of the most common applications is to mine protein-protein interactions (PPIs) from PubMed abstracts. Currently, most tools in mining PPIs from literature are using co-occurrence-based approaches or rule-based approaches. Hybrid methods (frame-based approaches) by combining these two methods may have better performance in predicting PPIs. However, the predicted PPIs from these methods are rarely evaluated by known PPI databases and co-occurred terms in Gene Ontology (GO) database.We here developed a web-based tool, PPI Finder, to mine human PPIs from PubMed abstracts based on their co-occurrences and interaction words, followed by evidences in human PPI databases and shared terms in GO database. Only 28% of the co-occurred pairs in PubMed abstracts appeared in any of the commonly used human PPI databases (HPRD, BioGRID and BIND). On the other hand, of the known PPIs in HPRD, 69% showed co-occurrences in the literature, and 65% shared GO terms.PPI Finder provides a useful tool for biologists to uncover potential novel PPIs.

https://openalex.org/W2050492928,"Background Most hypotheses on population limitation of small mammals and their predators come from studies carried out in northern latitudes, mainly in boreal ecosystems. In such regions, many predators specialize on voles and predator-prey systems are simpler compared to southern ecosystems where predator communities are made up mostly of generalists and predator-prey systems are more complex. Determining food limitation in generalist predators is difficult due to their capacity to switch to alternative prey when the basic prey becomes scarce. Methodology We monitored the population density of a generalist raptor, the Eurasian kestrel Falco tinnunculus over 15 years in a mountainous Mediterranean area. In addition, we have recorded over 11 years the inter-annual variation in the abundance of two main prey species of kestrels, the common vole Microtus arvalis and the eyed lizard Lacerta lepida and a third species scarcely represented in kestrel diet, the great white-toothed shrew Crocidura russula. We estimated the per capita growth rate (PCGR) to analyse population dynamics of kestrel and predator species. Principal Findings Multimodel inference determined that the PCGR of kestrels was better explained by a model containing the population density of only one prey species (the common vole) than a model using a combination of the densities of the three prey species. The PCGR of voles was explained by kestrel abundance in combination with annual rainfall and mean annual temperature. In the case of shrews, growth rate was also affected by kestrel abundance and temperature. Finally, we did not find any correlation between kestrel and lizard abundances. Significance Our study showed for the first time vertebrate predator-prey relationships at southern latitudes and determined that only one prey species has the capacity to modulate population dynamics of generalist predators and reveals the importance of climatic factors in the dynamics of micromammal species and lizards in the Mediterranean region."
https://openalex.org/W2092231589,"The Clp protease is conserved among eubacteria and most eukaryotes, and uses ATP to drive protein substrate unfolding and translocation into a chamber of sequestered proteolytic active sites. The main constitutive Clp protease in photosynthetic organisms has evolved into a functionally essential and structurally intricate enzyme. The model Clp protease from the cyanobacterium Synechococcus consists of the HSP100 molecular chaperone ClpC and a mixed proteolytic core comprised of two distinct subunits, ClpP3 and ClpR. We have purified the ClpP3/R complex, the first for a Clp proteolytic core comprised of heterologous subunits. The ClpP3/R complex has unique functional and structural features, consisting of twin heptameric rings each with an identical ClpP33ClpR4 configuration. As predicted by its lack of an obvious catalytic triad, the ClpR subunit is shown to be proteolytically inactive. Interestingly, extensive modification to ClpR to restore proteolytic activity to this subunit showed that its presence in the core complex is not rate-limiting for the overall proteolytic activity of the ClpCP3/R protease. Altogether, the ClpP3/R complex shows remarkable similarities to the 20 S core of the proteasome, revealing a far greater degree of convergent evolution than previously thought between the development of the Clp protease in photosynthetic organisms and that of the eukaryotic 26 S proteasome. The Clp protease is conserved among eubacteria and most eukaryotes, and uses ATP to drive protein substrate unfolding and translocation into a chamber of sequestered proteolytic active sites.

The model Clp protease from the cyanobacterium Synechococcus consists of the HSP100 molecular chaperone ClpC and a mixed proteolytic core comprised of two distinct subunits, ClpP3 and ClpR. We have purified the ClpP3/R complex, the first for a Clp proteolytic core comprised of heterologous subunits. The ClpP3/R complex has unique functional and structural features, consisting of twin heptameric rings each with an identical ClpP33ClpR4 configuration. As predicted by its lack of an obvious catalytic triad, the ClpR subunit is shown to be proteolytically inactive. Interestingly, extensive modification to ClpR to restore proteolytic activity to this subunit showed that its presence in the core complex is not rate-limiting for the overall proteolytic activity of the ClpCP3/R protease. Altogether, the ClpP3/R complex shows remarkable similarities to the 20 S core of the proteasome, revealing a far greater degree of convergent evolution than previously thought between the development of the Clp protease in photosynthetic organisms and that of the eukaryotic 26 S proteasome. Proteases perform numerous tasks vital for cellular homeostasis in all organisms. Much of the selective proteolysis within living cells is performed by multisubunit chaperone-protease complexes. These proteases all share a common two-component architecture and mode of action, with one of the best known examples being the proteasome in archaebacteria, certain eubacteria, and eukaryotes (1Pickart C.M. Cohen R.E. Nat. Rev. 2004; 5: 177-187Crossref Scopus (606) Google Scholar). The 20 S proteasome is a highly conserved cylindrical structure composed of two distinct types of subunits, α and β. These are organized in four stacked heptameric rings, with two central β-rings sandwiched between two outer α-rings. Although the α- and β-protein sequences are similar, it is only the latter that is proteolytic active, with a single Thr active site at the N terminus. The barrel-shaped complex is traversed by a central channel that widens up into three cavities. The catalytic sites are positioned in the central chamber formed by the β-rings, adjacent to which are two antechambers conjointly built up by β- and α-subunits. In general, substrate entry into the core complex is essentially blocked by the α-rings, and thus relies on the associating regulatory partner, PAN and 19 S complexes in archaea and eukaryotes, respectively (1Pickart C.M. Cohen R.E. Nat. Rev. 2004; 5: 177-187Crossref Scopus (606) Google Scholar). Typically, the archaeal core structure is assembled from only one type of α- and β-subunit, so that the central proteolytic chamber contains 14 catalytic active sites (2Löwe J. Stock D. Jap B. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Huber R. Science. 1995; 268: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar). In contrast, each ring of the eukaryotic 20 S complex has seven distinct α- and β-subunits. Moreover, only three of the seven β-subunits in each ring are proteolytically active (3Groll M. Ditzel L. Lowe J. Stock D. Bochtler M. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. Nature. 1997; 386: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1944) Google Scholar). Having a strictly conserved architecture, the main difference between the 20 S proteasomes is one of complexity. In mammalian cells, the three constitutive active subunits can even be replaced with related subunits upon induction by γ-interferon to generate antigenic peptides presented by the class 1 major histocompatibility complex (4Tanaka K. Kasahara M. Immunol. Rev. 1998; 163: 161-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Two chambered proteases architecturally similar to the proteasome also exist in eubacteria, HslV and ClpP. HslV is commonly thought to be the prokaryotic counterpart to the 20 S proteasome mainly because both are Thr proteases. A single type of HslV protein, however, forms a proteolytic chamber consisting of twin hexameric rather than heptameric rings (5Bochtler M. Ditzel L. Groll M. Huber R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6070-6074Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Also displaying structural similarities to the proteasome is the unrelated ClpP protease. The model Clp protease from Escherichia coli consists of a proteolytic ClpP core flanked on one or both sides by the ATP-dependent chaperones ClpA or ClpX (6Grimaud R. Kessel M. Beuron F. Steven A.C. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12476-12481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The ClpP proteolytic chamber is comprised of two opposing homo-heptameric rings with the catalytic sites harbored within (7Wang J. Hartling J.A. Flanagan J.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 447-456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). ClpP alone displays only limited peptidase activity toward short unstructured peptides (8Thompson M. Maurizi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18201-18208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Larger native protein substrates need to be recognized by ClpA or ClpX and then translocated in an unfolded state into the ClpP proteolytic chamber (9Kim Y.I. Levchenko I. Fraczkowska K. Woodruff R.V. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 230-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 10Ortega J. Lee H.S. Maurizi M.R. Steven A.C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4938-4949Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Inside, the unfolded substrate is bound in an extended manner to the catalytic triads (Ser-97, His-122, and Asp-171) and degraded into small peptide fragments that can readily diffuse out (11Kang S.G. Maurizi M.R. Thompson M. Mueser T. Ahvazi B. J. Struct. Biol. 2004; 148: 338-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Several adaptor proteins broaden the array of substrates degraded by a Clp protease by binding to the associated HSP100 partner and modifying its protein substrate specificity (12Levchenko I. Seidel M. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. Science. 2000; 289: 2354-2356Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 13Dougan D.A. Reid B.G. Horwich A.L. Bukau B. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 673-683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). One example is the adaptor ClpS that interacts with ClpA (EcClpA) and targets N-end rule substrates for degradation by the ClpAP protease (14Erbse A. Schmidt R. Bornemann T. Schneider-Mergener J. Mogk A. Zahn R. Dougan D.A. Bukau B. Nature. 2006; 439: 753-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Like the proteasome, the Clp protease is found in a wide variety of organisms. Besides in all eubacteria, the Clp protease also exist in mammalian and plant mitochondria, as well as in various plastids of algae and plants. It also occurs in the unusual plastid in Apicomplexan protozoan (15Waller R.F. Keeling P.J. Donald R.G.K. Striepen B. Handman E. Lang-Unnasch N. Cowman A.F. Besra G.S. Roos D.S. McFadden G.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12352-12357Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar), a family of parasites responsible for many important medical and veterinary diseases such as malaria. Of all these organisms, photobionts have by far the most diverse array of Clp proteins. This was first apparent in cyanobacteria, with the model species Synechococcus elongatus having 10 distinct Clp proteins, four HSP100 chaperones (ClpB1–2, ClpC, and ClpX), three ClpP proteins (ClpP1–3), a ClpP-like protein termed ClpR, and two adaptor proteins (ClpS1–2) (16Clarke A.K. MacDonald T.M. Sjögren L.L.E. Physiol. Plant. 2005; 123: 406-412Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Of particular interest is the ClpR variant, which has protein sequence similarity to ClpP but appears to lack the catalytic triad of Ser-type proteases (17Porankiewicz J. Wang J. Clarke A.K. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 449-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). This diversity of Clp proteins is even more extreme in photosynthetic eukaryotes, with at least 23 different Clp proteins in the higher plant Arabidopsis thaliana, most of which are plastid-localized (18Adam Z. Adamska I. Nakabayashi K. Ostersetzer O. Haussuhl K. Manuell A. Zheng B. Vallon O. Rodermel S.R. Shinozaki K. Clarke A.K. Plant Physiol. 2001; 125: 1912-1918Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that two distinct Clp proteases exist in Synechococcus, both of which contain mixed proteolytic cores. The first consists of ClpP1 and ClpP2 subunits, and associates with ClpX, whereas the other has a proteolytic core consisting of ClpP3 and ClpR that binds to ClpC, as do the two ClpS adaptors (19Stanne T.M. Pojidaeva E. Andersson F.I. Clarke A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 14394-14402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Of these proteases, it is the more constitutively abundant ClpCP3/R that is essential for cell viability and growth (20Clarke A.K. Eriksson M.J. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 31: 721-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 21Schelin J. Lindmark F. Clarke A.K. Microbiol. 2002; 148: 2255-2265Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). It is also the ClpP3/R complex that is homologous to the single type in eukaryotic plastids, all of which also have ClpC as the chaperone partner (16Clarke A.K. MacDonald T.M. Sjögren L.L.E. Physiol. Plant. 2005; 123: 406-412Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In algae and plants, however, the complexity of the plastidic Clp proteolytic core has evolved dramatically. In Arabidopsis, the core complex consists of five ClpP and four ClpR paralogs, along with two unrelated Clp proteins unique to higher plants (22Peltier J.B. Ripoll D.R. Friso G. Rudella A. Cai Y. Ytterberg J. Giacomelli L. Pillardy J. van Wijk K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4768-4781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Like ClpP3/R, the plastid Clp protease in Arabidopsis is essential for normal growth and development, and appears to function primarily as a housekeeping protease (23Shikanai T. Shimizu K. Ueda K. Nishimura Y. Kuroiwa T. Hashimoto T. Plant Cell Physiol. 2001; 42: 264-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 24Sjögren L.L.E. Stanne T.M. Zheng B. Sutinen S. Clarke A.K. Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 2635-2649Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). One of the most striking developments in the Clp protease in photosynthetic organisms and Apicomplexan parasites is the inclusion of ClpR within the central proteolytic core. Although this type of Clp protease has evolved into a vital enzyme, little is known about its activity or the exact role of ClpR within the core complex. To address these points we have purified the intact Synechococcus ClpP3/R proteolytic core by co-expression in E. coli. The recombinant ClpP3/R forms a double heptameric ring complex, with each ring having a specific ClpP3/R stoichiometry and arrangement. Together with ClpC, the ClpP3/R complex degrades several polypeptide substrates, but at a rate considerably slower than that by the E. coli ClpAP protease. Interestingly, although ClpR is shown to be proteolytically inactive, its inclusion in the core complex is not rate-limiting to the overall activity of the ClpCP3/R protease. In general, the results reveal remarkable similarities between the evolutionary development of the Clp protease in photosynthetic organisms and the eukaryotic proteasome relative to their simpler prokaryotic counterparts. Purification of ClpP3/R Complex—The Synechococcus clpP3 and clpR genes were amplified from genomic clones using Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) and cloned into the pACYC Duet vector (Novagen) for co-expression in E. coli. Another construct was made in which site-directed mutagenesis was used to replace the active site Ser residue in ClpP3 with Ala. A similar approach was used to prepare the chimeric form of ClpR, in which the central region of clpR coding for amino acids 38 to 212 was replaced with the corresponding region from clpP3. In all cases, a His6 tag was added to the 3′ end of the clpP3 gene to aid purification, whereas no such tag was included in the clpR gene. All gene constructs were confirmed by sequencing. Co-expression of ClpP3 and ClpR was performed in E. coli BL21-STAR cells (Invitrogen) grown at 37 °C in 10 liters of LB cultures. Once in mid-exponential growth (i.e. A600 of 0.5), cultures were cooled to 16 °C and isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside added (final concentration 0.5 mm) to induce protein expression. After 6 h, cells were pelleted and then resuspended in buffer A (20 mm Tris/Cl, pH 7.5, 400 mm NaCl, 40 mm imidazole, 1 mm DTT). 2The abbreviations used are: DTT, dithiothreitol; AMC, amido-4-methylcoumarin; EcClpA, E. coli ClpA; EcClpP, E. coli ClpP; ESI, electrospray ionization; GFP, green fluorescent protein; MS, mass spectrometry; Synechococcus, Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; AFM, atomic force microscopy; TEM, transmission electron microscopy. Cells were ruptured using a French Press (1000 atm) followed by centrifugation to remove insoluble cell debris. The soluble protein fraction was loaded onto a Ni2+ affinity column (HisTrap HP, GE Healthcare). After washing the column with buffer A, bound proteins were eluted using buffer B (20 mm Tris/Cl, pH 7.5, 400 mm NaCl, 400 mm imidazole, 1 mm DTT). SDS-PAGE revealed that both ClpP3-His6 and ClpR were purified in the same fraction, indicating that the co-expressed proteins formed a single stable oligomer. After dialysis (Slid-A-Lyzer, Pierce) and equilibration in buffer C (20 mm Tris/Cl, pH 7.5, 75 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT), the ClpP3/R oligomer was further purified by gel filtration chromatography using a 16/60 Superdex column (GE Healthcare). Mass spectrometry (MS) of the sample revealed no contamination of the purified proteins with E. coli ClpP, as did a lack of peptidase activity as shown in supplemental Fig. S2. Proteins were stored in buffer C with 15% glycerol. Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford assay (Pierce), with the concentration of ClpP3/R used in each assay based on a monomeric conformation. Purification of ClpC and ClpS1—Purification of Synechococcus ClpC and ClpS1 was performed as previously described (25Andersson F.I. Blakytny R. Kirstein J. Turgay K. Bukau B. Mogk A. Clarke A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5468-5475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford assay, with the concentration of ClpC and ClpS1 used in each assay based on a monomeric conformation. Native PAGE—Separation of purified ClpP3/R complexes under non-denaturing conditions was done using a Tris borate gel system (19Stanne T.M. Pojidaeva E. Andersson F.I. Clarke A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 14394-14402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). For recombinant ClpP3/R complexes, 25 μg of protein were resolved on 6–16% polyacrylamide gradient gels. To accurately separate proteins solely on their molecular mass, gels were run at constant current at 4 °C as described (26Clarke A.K. Critchley C. Plant Physiol. 1992; 100: 2081-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Ferretin (440 kDa, monomer; 880 kDa, dimer), urease (270 kDa, trimer), and bovine serum albumin (132 kDa, dimer) were used as molecular mass markers. Protein complexes were visualized using Coomassie Blue staining (Invitrogen). When comparing the size of recombinant and native ClpP3/R complexes, 250 ng of recombinant protein was separated with 20 μg of soluble protein extracted from wild type Synechococcus. The ClpP3/R complex was then detected by immunoblotting using a ClpP3-specific antibody (19Stanne T.M. Pojidaeva E. Andersson F.I. Clarke A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 14394-14402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)—AFM was performed with a MultiMode NanoScope IIIa (Veeco) in a commercial glass fluid cell with SiN cantilevers (OMCL-TR-800, normal force constant 0.57 N m-1, Olympus). For sample preparation, freshly cleaved mica was incubated with buffer solution (20 mm Tris/Cl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm DTT) containing 7 μg ml-1 ClpP3/R for 10 min. After several washing steps with buffer for removal of excess protein, imaging under native conditions was performed in TappingMode. For negative stain TEM, samples were prepared on plasma-treated carbon-coated copper grids by incubating a 5-μl droplet of the sample solution for 60 s. Excess suspension was removed by blotting with filter paper. After a washing step using 5 μl of buffer, the grid was blotted and stained with 5 μl of 2% uranyl acetate for 60 s. Images were recorded using a FEI CM20 FEG at a pixel size of 3.2 Å and a defocus of -2 μm. Candidate particles were selected automatically from electron micrographs using a blob detector. A subset of 1000 picks were subjected to unsupervised clustering based on a full similarity matrix derived by cross-correlating each particle with each other accounting for the rotational and translational degrees of freedom. Good particle views were then selected from the class averages of the resulting clusters, and the complete data set was classified against these templates. The highest scoring matches for each class were used to create a final set of class averages for visual inspection. The complete processing pipeline was implemented in the in-house Python/C++ package “empi.” Mass Spectrometry—To determine the stoichiometry of the ClpP3/R complex electrospray ionization (ESI), MS and tandem MS (MS/MS) experiments were performed on a high mass Q-TOF type instrument adapted for a QSTAR XL platform (27Sobott F. Hernandez H. McCammon M.G. Tito M.A. Robinson C.V. Anal. Chem. 2002; 74: 1402-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 28Chernushevich I.V. Thomson B.A. Anal. Chem. 2004; 76: 1754-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Prior to MS analysis 300 μl of a 0.6 mg ml-1 solution of ClpP3/R in buffer C was concentrated 6-fold by using a Vivaspin (Vivascience) centrifugal device with a molecular mass cutoff of 5 kDa. The sample was then buffer exchanged twice into different concentrations of ammonium acetate solution (0.1, 0.2, or 1 m) using Bio-Rad Biospin columns. To induce dissociation of complex-containing solutions methanol was added from 5 to 20%. Nano-ESI capillaries were prepared inhouse from borosilicate glass tubes (29Nettleton E.J. Sunde M. Lai Z. Kelly J.W. Dobson C.M. Robinson C.V. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 553-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and an aliquot of 2 μl of solution was loaded for sampling. The conditions within the mass spectrometer were adjusted to preserve non-covalent interactions. The following experimental parameters were used: capillary voltage up to 1.3 kV, declustering potential up to 150 V, focusing potential 250 V, second declustering potential 55 V, and focusing rod offset ranging from 20 to 100 V, MCP 2350 V. For tandem MS experiments peaks centered at m/z 5,650 or 5,850 were selected in the quadrupole and collision energy up to 200 V was employed. Argon was used as a collision gas at maximum pressure. All spectra were calibrated externally by using a solution of cesium iodide (100 mg ml-1). Spectra are shown here with minimal smoothing and without background subtraction. Homology Modeling—The monomeric structure of ClpR has been modeled based on the homologous template EcClpP (Protein Data Bank code 2fzs; Ref. 30Szyk A. Maurizi M.R. J. Struct. Biol. 2006; 156: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) using MODELLER (31Sali A. Blundell T. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10565) Google Scholar) following the alignment computed by hhsearch (32Soding J. Bioinformatics (Oxf.). 2005; 21: 951-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (1866) Google Scholar). Its N terminus has been remodeled in SPDBV (33Guex N. Peitsch M. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9590) Google Scholar) using the EcClpP template 1yg6A (34Bewley M.C. Graziano V. Griffin K. Flanagan J.M. J. Struct. Biol. 2006; 153: 113-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the C terminus was completed with coordinates from the human ClpP structure (1tg6E) (11Kang S.G. Maurizi M.R. Thompson M. Mueser T. Ahvazi B. J. Struct. Biol. 2004; 148: 338-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The insertions in ClpR were modeled in SPDBV as N-terminal extensions to the helices of which they are part. The monomer of ClpP3 has been modeled using the template EcClpP (PDB code 2fzs). The alignment was computed using PSI-BLAST (35Altschul S. Madden T. Schaffer A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59933) Google Scholar); the catalytic residues are conserved (Fig. 4A). The tetradecameric complex formed by two heptameric rings of ClpP33ClpR4 (Fig. 4C) was built following a previous method (36Diemand A. Lupas A. J. Struct. Biol. 2006; 156: 230-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Additionally, the final model was selected from a number of alternative models recomputed using MODELLER and energy minimized in SPDBV. The model was analyzed using the iMolTalk server (37Diemand A. Scheib H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W512-W516Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and interface contacts in the complex were detected with a distance threshold of 3.4 Å. Images have been prepared using either Molscript (38Kraulis P. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar) and Raster3D (39Merritt E.A. Bacon D.J. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 505-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (3875) Google Scholar), or SPDBV and Povray. Peptidase Assay—The peptidase activity of ClpP3/R and EcClpP was measured against the fluorogenic peptides N-succinyl (Suc)-Leu-Tyr-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (AMC), Suc-Val-Lys-Met-AMC, and Suc-Ile-Ile-Trp-AMC (Sigma). For each assay, 30 μm peptide and 1–5 μg of ClpP3/R or EcClpP were incubated in buffer D (25 mm Tris/Cl, pH 7.5, 75 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT) for 5–20 min at 37 °C. Peptide degradation was measured as an increase in relative fluorescence (FluoSTAR; BWG) at 310–380 nm excitation and 460 nm emission wavelengths. Degradation of α-Casein and GFP Substrates—For the proteolytic assays, each of the Clp proteins used was diluted to 1 μm final concentration in buffer D together with an ATP-regeneration system (13Dougan D.A. Reid B.G. Horwich A.L. Bukau B. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 673-683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). For each assay 1 μm α-casein was used, whereas 100 nm was used for FITC-casein and the GFP substrates (FR-GFP and MR-GFP). All reactions were performed at 37 °C. Degradation of α-casein was monitored by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining, whereas FITC-casein degradation was measured by fluorescence (FluoSTAR; BWG) at 490 nm excitation and 525 nm emission wavelengths. Degradation of FR- and MR-GFP was determined either by immunoblotting using a GFP-specific antibody or by loss in fluorescence at 400 nm excitation and 510 nm emission wavelengths. ATPase Activity—The ATPase activity of ClpC was measured by the release of inorganic phosphate as previously described (25Andersson F.I. Blakytny R. Kirstein J. Turgay K. Bukau B. Mogk A. Clarke A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5468-5475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In the assays, 0.5 μm ClpC was incubated either alone or with 1 μm wild type or mutated ClpP3/R in buffer D (+4 mm ATP) for 20 min at 37 °C. Purification of Synechococcus ClpP3 and ClpR—We have shown that the two constitutively expressed ClpP3 and ClpR proteins in Synechococcus form an essential hetero-oligomeric complex in vivo (19Stanne T.M. Pojidaeva E. Andersson F.I. Clarke A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 14394-14402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Initial attempts to reconstitute this core complex by mixing individually purified ClpP3 and ClpR proteins failed (data not shown), and so a new strategy was adopted (note: neither ClpP3 nor ClpR form a proteolytic core complex on their own). Given that both clpP3 and clpR genes in Synechococcus are arranged within a bicistronic operon (21Schelin J. Lindmark F. Clarke A.K. Microbiol. 2002; 148: 2255-2265Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), we used an E. coli expression system in which the genes were co-expressed within the same cell (Fig. 1A). Based on the premise that both proteins would readily oligomerize together once synthesized in E. coli, a His6 tag was included at the C terminus of only ClpP3 to aid in purification of the core complex. Upon induction with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, soluble cell extracts containing both ClpP3 and ClpR were first passed over a Ni2+-affinity column. Following extensive washing to remove nonspecific contaminants, both ClpP3 and ClpR were the principle proteins eluted from the column indicating they form a stable oligomeric complex. The ClpP3/R proteins were then further purified by size exclusion chromatography (Fig. 1A). Recombinant ClpP3/R Proteins Form a Core Complex—To determine whether the recombinant ClpP3 and ClpR proteins formed a proteolytic core complex, we first separated the purified proteins by native PAGE. As shown in Fig. 1B, the ClpP3/R proteins formed a single oligomer of 270 kDa, the size of which was identical to that formed in vivo by the native ClpP3/R proteins (Fig. 1C) (19Stanne T.M. Pojidaeva E. Andersson F.I. Clarke A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 14394-14402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To further analyze the overall structure of the ClpP3/R complex we performed both AFM and negative-stain TEM. Using AFM, the ClpP3/R complexes could be successfully imaged under native conditions in buffer solution (supplemental Fig. S1). Topographical analysis revealed that the imaged particles grouped into two classes, one with a height of 5 nm, the other 8.8 nm (Fig. 2A). Assuming an overall structure of the ClpP3/R complex similar to that of E. coli ClpP (EcClpP), the higher particles most likely correspond to upright standing ClpP3/R, whereas the 5-nm high population might derive from half of the ClpP3/R where the upper ring has been sheered off by the scanning tip. Such equatorial sectioning of barrel-shaped multisubunit complexes has been previously reported while imaging under similar conditions (40Schiener J. Witt S. Hayer-Hartl M. Guckenberger R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 328: 477-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In addition to the AFM analysis, template-free class averages obtained from single-particle analysis of negative stain TEM showed a symmetric, seven-pointed object with straight edges, a central hole, and a diameter of about 9 nm, compatible with the top view of the structural models for EcClpP and ClpP3/R. The other class averages show a slightly more bulky view with an elongated cleft in the center, compatible with a diagonal view of two sandwiched rings (Fig. 2B). Taken together, the results suggest that the recombinant proteins form a complex matching that of native ClpP3/R in vivo, with a double layered heptameric ring structure consistent with that of a Clp proteolytic core. Subunit Composition of the ClpP3/R Complex—Because the ClpP3/R core, unlike most other ClpP complexes described so far, consists of two distinct subunits, we set out to elucidate its structural arrangement using MS. Composition of the ClpP3/R complex was explored under conditions designed either to maintain the complex intact or to disrupt the complex in solution or gas phase (see “Experimental Procedures”). The major component in all mass spectra corresponds to a heptameric complex, consisting of four and three copies of ClpR and ClpP3, respectively (ClpP33ClpR4) (Fig. 3A). In addition, a minor population corresponds to a double heptameric ring. To gain more insight into the subunit arrangement of the ClpP3/R complex we dissociated the ring using tandem MS, collisional activation, or disruption in solution. By collisional activation, acceleration of the complex induces dissociation of both ClpP3 and ClpR subunits and the resulting stripped complexes correspond"

https://openalex.org/W2067750760,"Tumor metastasis is a complex phenomenon that is the culmination of effects of numerous cellular factors. We have shown that the Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) oncoprotein, latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1), is capable of inducing a wide range of such factors in cell culture, expression of which is also elevated in the LMP1-expressing tumor, nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), a highly invasive neoplasm. Recently, the membrane crosslinker protein, ezrin, has been implicated in tumor cell metastasis and malignant progression. In this study, we evaluated the possible role of LMP1 and ezrin in the pathophysiology of NPC. We show that C-terminal phosphorylation of ezrin is increased by the expression of LMP1 in nasopharyngeal (NP) cells through a protein kinase C (PKC) pathway. LMP1 enhances the organization of a ternary complex of CD44, ezrin and F-actin, which is a prerequisite for ezrin phosphorylation. In NPC tissues, the expression of phosphoezrin and LMP1 is directly correlated. Silencing of endogenously expressed ezrin suppresses LMP1-induced cell motility and invasiveness. Moreover, the inhibition of ezrin phosphorylation by PKC inhibitor suppresses migration and invasion of NP cells. These data show that the phosphorylation of ezrin and its recruitment to the cell membrane linked to F-actin and CD44 is a process required for LMP1-stimulated cell motility and invasion of NP cells."
https://openalex.org/W2005585420,"Background The impact of tomato lycopene extract (TLE) on intestinal inflammation is currently unknown. We investigated the effect of TLE on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced innate signaling and experimental colitis. Methodology/Principal Findings Mice were fed a diet containing 0.5 and 2% TLE or isoflavone free control (AIN-76). The therapeutic efficacy of TLE diet was assessed using dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) exposed mice and IL-10−/−;NF-κBEGFP mice, representing an acute and spontaneous chronic colitis model respectively. A mini-endoscope was used to determine the extent of macroscopic mucosal lesions. Murine splenocytes and intestinal epithelial cells were used to determine the in vitro impact of TLE on LPS-induced NF-κB signaling. In vitro, TLE blocked LPS-induced IκBα degradation, RelA translocation, NF-κB transcriptional activity and MIP-2 mRNA accumulation in IEC-18 cells. Moreover, LPS-induced IL-12p40 gene expression was dose-dependently inhibited in TLE-treated splenocytes. Interestingly, DSS-induced acute colitis worsened in TLE-fed NF-κBEGFP mice compared to control diet as measured by weight loss, colonoscopic analysis and histological scores. In contrast, TLE-fed IL-10−/−;NF-κBEGFP mice displayed decreased colonic EGFP expression compared to control diet. IL-6, TNFα, and MCP-1 mRNA expression were increased in the colon of TLE-fed, DSS-exposed NF-κBEGFP mice compared to the control diet. Additionally, caspase-3 activation and TUNEL positive cells were enhanced in TLE diet-fed, DSS-exposed mice as compared to DSS control mice. Conclusions/ Significance These results indicate that TLE prevents LPS-induced proinflammatory gene expression by blocking of NF-κB signaling, but aggravates DSS-induced colitis by enhancing epithelial cell apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2076891226,"RNA enzymes have been developed that undergo self-sustained replication at a constant temperature in the absence of proteins1. These RNA molecules amplify exponentially through a cross-replicative process, whereby two enzymes catalyze each other's synthesis by joining component oligonucleotides. Other RNA enzymes have been made to operate in a ligand-dependent manner by combining a catalytic domain with a ligand-binding domain (aptamer) to produce an 'aptazyme'2,3. The principle of ligand-dependent RNA catalysis has now been extended to the cross-replicating RNA enzymes so that exponential amplification occurs in the presence, but not the absence, of the cognate ligand. The exponential growth rate of the RNA depends on the concentration of the ligand, allowing one to determine the concentration of ligand in a sample. This process is analogous to quantitative PCR (qPCR) but can be generalized to a wide variety of targets, including proteins and small molecules that are relevant to medical diagnostics and environmental monitoring."
https://openalex.org/W2010076338,"Decitabine, an epigenetic modifier that reactivates genes otherwise suppressed by DNA promoter methylation, is effective for some, but not all cancer patients, especially those with solid tumors. It is commonly recognized that to overcome resistance and improve outcome, treatment should be guided by tumor biology, which includes genotype, epigenotype, and gene expression profile. We therefore took an integrative approach to better understand melanoma cell response to clinically relevant dose of decitabine and identify complementary targets for combined therapy. We employed eight different melanoma cell strains, determined their growth, apoptotic and DNA damage responses to increasing doses of decitabine, and chose a low, clinically relevant drug dose to perform whole-genome differential gene expression, bioinformatic analysis, and protein validation studies. The data ruled out the DNA damage response, demonstrated the involvement of p21Cip1 in a p53-independent manner, identified the TGFβ pathway genes CLU and TGFBI as markers of sensitivity to decitabine and revealed an effect on histone modification as part of decitabine-induced gene expression. Mutation analysis and knockdown by siRNA implicated activated β-catenin/MITF, but not BRAF, NRAS or PTEN mutations as a source for resistance. The importance of protein stability predicted from the results was validated by the synergistic effect of Bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor, in enhancing the growth arrest of decitabine in otherwise resistant melanoma cells. Our integrative analysis show that improved therapy can be achieved by comprehensive analysis of cancer cells, identified biomarkers for patient's selection and monitoring response, as well as targets for improved combination therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2075458078,"Background India has the highest estimated burden of tuberculosis in the world, accounting for 21% of all tuberculosis cases world-wide. However, due to lack of systematic analysis using multiple markers the available information on the genomic diversity of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in India is limited. Methodology/Principal Findings Thus, 65 M. tuberculosis isolates from New Delhi, India were analyzed by spoligotyping, MIRU-VNTR, large deletion PCR typing and single nucleotide polymorphism analysis (SNP). The Central Asian (CAS) 1 _DELHI sub-lineage was the most prevalent sub-lineage comprising 46.2% (n = 30) of all isolates, with shared-type (ST) 26 being the most dominant genotype comprising 24.6% (n = 16) of all isolates. Other sub-lineages observed were: East-African Indian (EAI)-5 (9.2%, n = 6), EAI6_BGD1 (6.2%, n = 4), EAI3_IND, CAS and T1 with 6.2% each (n = 4 each), Beijing (4.6%, n = 3), CAS2 (3.1%, n = 2), and X1 and X2 with 1 isolate each. Genotyping results from five isolates (7.7%) did not match any existing spoligopatterns, and one isolate, ST124, belonged to an undefined lineage. Twenty-six percent of the isolates belonged to the TbD1+ PGG1 genogroup. SNP analysis of the pncA gene revealed a CAS-lineage specific silent mutation, S65S, which was observed for all CAS-lineage isolates (except two ST26 isolates) and in 1 orphan. Mutations in the pncA gene, conferring resistance to pyrazinamide, were observed in 15.4% of all isolates. Collectively, mutations in the rpoB gene, the katG gene and in both rpoB and katG genes, conferring resistance to rifampicin and isoniazid, respectively, were more frequent in CAS1_DELHI isolates compared to non-CAS_DELHI isolates (OR: 3.1, CI95% [1.11, 8.70], P = 0.045). The increased frequency of drug-resistance could not be linked to the patients' history of previous anti-tuberculosis treatment (OR: 1.156, CI95% [0.40, 3.36], P = 0.79). Fifty-six percent of all new tuberculosis patients had mutations in either the katG gene or the rpoB gene, or in both katG and rpoB genes. Conclusion CAS1_DELHI isolates circulating in New Delhi, India have a high frequency of mutations in the rpoB and katG genes. A silent mutation (S65S) in the pncA gene can be used as a putative genetic marker for CAS-lineage isolates."
https://openalex.org/W2000288557,"It is now evident that Gαs traffics into cytosol following G protein-coupled receptor activation, and α subunits of some heterotrimeric G-proteins, including Gαs bind to tubulin in vitro. Nevertheless, many features of G-protein-microtubule interaction and possible intracellular effects of G protein α subunits remain unclear. In this study, several biochemical approaches demonstrated that activated Gαs directly bound to tubulin and cellular microtubules, and fluorescence microscopy showed that cholera toxin-activated Gαs colocalized with microtubules. The activated, GTP-bound, Gαs mimicked tubulin in serving as a GTPase activator for β-tubulin. As a result, activated Gαs made microtubules more dynamic, both in vitro and in cells, decreasing the pool of insoluble microtubules without changing total cellular tubulin content. The amount of acetylated tubulin (an indicator of microtubule stability) was reduced in the presence of Gαs activated by mutation. Previous studies showed that cholera toxin and cAMP analogs may stimulate neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells. However, in this study, overexpression of a constitutively activated Gαs or activation of Gαs with cholera toxin in protein kinase A-deficient PC12 cells promoted neurite outgrowth in a cAMP-independent manner. Thus, it is suggested that activated Gαs acts as an intracellular messenger to regulate directly microtubule dynamics and promote neurite outgrowth.

These data serve to link G-protein signaling with modulation of the cytoskeleton and cell morphology. Heterotrimeric G proteins, activated upon agonist binding to G protein-coupled receptors, play a vital role in propagating extracellular signals across the plasma membrane. Gα and βγ subunits undergo a functional dissociation upon activation, allowing them to regulate downstream effectors, such as adenylyl cyclase and ion channels. Signaling is terminated when the intrinsic GTPase of Gα subunits hydrolyzes GTP into GDP. Although most heterotrimeric G proteins are localized on the plasma membrane, numerous studies have suggested intracellular functions either in the cytosol or in conjunction with cytosolic organelles (1Charlie N.K.

Recently, a number of biochemical studies observed intracellular translocation of Gαs proteins subsequent to activation by β-adrenergic agonists, cholera toxin, or direct binding of a hydrolysis-resistant GTP analog (7Ransnas L.A. Svoboda P. Jasper J.R. Insel P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1989; 86: 7900-7903Google Scholar, 8Rasenick M.M. Wheeler G.L. Bitensky M.W. Kosack C.M. Malina R.L. Stein P.J. J.

More recently, taking advantage of an internal sequence Gαs-GFP fusion protein, the translocation of Gαs into the cytoplasm was directly observed in living cells upon stimulation with agonists (10Yu J.Z. Rasenick M.M. Mol. Pharmacol... 2002; 61: 352-359Google Scholar, 11Hynes T.R. Mervine S.M. Yost E.A. Sabo J.L. Berlot C.H. J. Biol. Chem... 2004; 279: 44101-44112Google Scholar). This translocation of Gαs from membrane to cytoplasm triggered by agonist appears to occur through lipid rafts on the plasma membrane (12Allen J.A. Yu J.Z. Donati R.J. Rasenick M.M. Mol. Pharmacol... 2005; 20: 1452-1461Google Scholar).The fate of internalized Gαs is not well characterized. Two current studies have suggested that activated, internalized Gαs could invoke developmental paradigms. In mouse oocytes, meiotic prophase was maintained (arrested) due to the prolonged, receptor-mediated activation of Gαs, which assumed a cytosolic localization subsequent to internalization (13Freudzon L. Norris R.P. Hand A.R. Tanaka S. Saeki Y. Jones T.L. Rasenick M.M. Berlot C.H. Mehlmann L.M. Jaffe L.A. J. Cell Biol... 2005; 171: 255-265Google Scholar). Activated Gαs was also invoked to explain prostaglandin E2-mediated stimulation of colon cancer cell growth. It appeared that Gαs associated with axin and allowed β-catenin to activate the proliferative state (14Castellone M.D. Teramoto H. Williams B.O. Druey K.M. Gutkind J.S. Science.. 2005; 310: 1504-1510Google Scholar). Results from these studies suggest that Gαs subunits may undertake some intracellular functions beyond the ""traditional"" pathway of G protein signaling.Microtubules, a major component of the cytoskeleton, participate in many cellular activities, including chromosome movements during mitosis, intracellular transport, and the modulation of cell morphology. A heterodimer of α- and β-tubulin is the basic building block of microtubules, and both α- and β-tubulin bind GTP; this GTP is hydrolyzed to GDP in β-tubulin subunits by an intrinsic GTPase, which is activated by the association of a second microtubule subunit in the growing microtubule (15Carlier M.F. Didry D. Valentin-Ranc C. J. Biol. Chem... 1991; 266: 12361-12368Google Scholar). GTP hydrolysis allows microtubules to depolymerize by weakening the bonds between tubulin subunits to decrease microtubule stability (16Cassimeris L. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton.. 1993; 26: 275-281Google Scholar, 17Albrert B. Bray D. Lewis J. Raff M. Roberts K. Watson J.D. Molecular Biology of the Cell.Garland Publishing, Inc., New York. 1994; 37: 805-816Google Scholar). These cellular biologic functions of microtubules are dependent, in significant part, on the regulation of microtubule dynamics and stability. In non-mitotic cells, at least two populations of microtubules have been distinguished: short lived or dynamic microtubules (t½ = 5–10 min) and long lived or stable microtubules (t½ > 1 h) (18Webster D.R. Gundersen G.G. Bulinski J.C. Borisy G.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1987; 84: 9040-9044Google Scholar, 19Schulze E. Kirschner M. J. Cell Biol... 1987; 104: 277-288Google Scholar). In many cell types, stable microtubules accumulate detyrosinated tubulin and acetylated tubulin due to post-translational modification. In contrast, dynamic microtubules contain predominantly tyrosinated tubulin (20Bulinski J.C. Gundersen G.G. BioEssays.. 1991; 13: 285-293Google Scholar). In cells, some microtubule-binding proteins, such as Tau protein or SCG40, can also modulate microtubule stability through direct interaction with microtubules. The interaction between Gα subunits and tubulin has been studied for more than 2 decades (21Roychowdhury S. Rasenick M.M. FEBS J.. 2008; 275: 4654-4663Google Scholar), and studies with purified proteins implicate Gα subunits as potential regulators (22Wang N. Rasenick M.M. Biochemistry.. 1991; 30: 10957-10965Google Scholar, 23Roychowdhury S. Rasenick M.M. Biochemistry.. 1994; 33: 9800-9805Google Scholar).This study inquired whether activated Gαs, released from the plasma membrane, regulates microtubule stability via direct interaction with microtubules. Gαs binds to tubulin and acts as a GTPase-activating protein for that molecule. The resulting loss of the GTP cap confers an increase in dynamic instability of microtubules. One result of this is to potentiate neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells. This report shows that Gαs serves as an intracellular messenger to regulate microtubule dynamics and does so in a cAMP-independent fashion. Thus, we demonstrate a direct link between heterotrimeric G protein signaling and modulation of the cytoskeleton.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Wild-type PC12 cells, wild-type rat Gαs with hemagglutinin epitope (HA), 3The abbreviations used are: HA, hemagglutinin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; Ad, adenovirus; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; 8-CPT-cAMP, 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-adenosine-3′:5′-cyclic monophosphate; PKA, protein kinase A; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; PC, phosphocellulose; GDPβS, guanyl-5′-yl thiophosphate; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate. tag and constitutively activated GαsQ227L with HA tag were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Gα Q213Ls and the protein kinase A (PKA)-deficient PC12 cells (123.7) were generous gifts from John A. Wagner (Cornell University Medical College) (24Ginty D.D. Glowacka D. Bader D.S. Hidaka H. Wagner J.A. J. Biol. Chem... 1991; 266: 17454-17458Google Scholar) and Tarun Patel (Loyola University, Chicago, IL), respectively. Construction of Gαs-GFP was described in a previous report (10Yu J.Z. Rasenick M.M. Mol. Pharmacol... 2002; 61: 352-359Google Scholar). Monoclonal anti-α-tubulin and anti-HA antibodies were purchased from ICN Biomedicals (Costa Mesa, CA) and Berkeley Antibody Co. (Richmond, CA). Polyclonal antibody against detyrosinated tubulin was from Chemicon International Inc. (Temecula, CA). Monoclonal antibodies against acetylated and tyrosinated tubulin were from Sigma. Polyclonal antibody against Gαs was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. All other biochemicals used were of the highest purity available.Cell Culture and Transfection—PC12 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 5% horse serum, and 1% antibiotic (penicillin and streptomycin). Cells were maintained in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. Medium was changed every 3 days, and cells were passaged once per week.PC12 cells in 12-well culture plates were transfected with Gαs-GFP using GenePORTER™ transfection reagent (Gene Therapy Systems, Inc., San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Adenoviral Gene Transfer—Construction of recombinant adenoviruses Ad/Gαs or Ad/GαsQ227L was as follows. Rat Gαs and GαsQ227L cDNAs were cloned into PcDNA3 vector at the SalI site, and the entire cassette was excised and cloned into pADtrack-CMV shuttle vector (Quantum Biotechnologies, Inc.). The linearized shuttle vector and AdEasy vector (Quantum Biotechnologies) were then co-transformed into Escherichia coli strain BJ5183. Positive recombinant plasmid Ad/Gαs or GαsQ227L was selected, respectively. The virus was purified with CsCl banding and stored at –70 °C. Ten μl with 1 × 105 or 4 × 105 virus particles of Ad/Gαs or GαsQ227L was applied to each well of culture cells in a 12-well plate or to each 25-ml culture flask for infection. Greater than 90% of cells were infected in any given experiments.Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot—PC12 cells infected with Ad/GFP, Ad/Gαs, or Ad/GαsQ227L were cultured for 40 h and then washed twice in PBS. Cells were lysed in 500 μl of lysis buffer (PBS, 0.5% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, protease inhibitors) on ice for 30 min. The lysate was collected and cleared by centrifuging at 12,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration of supernatants was determined by the method of Bradford (Bio-Rad). After adjusting protein concentration to equal amounts for each sample, the supernatant (450 μl) was transferred to 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes and incubated with agarose beads coated with anti-mouse IgG for 1 h at 4 °C with continuous gentle inversion. The agarose beads were pulled down by centrifuging at room temperature and discarded. The lysate was then incubated with 5 μl of monoclonal antibody against HA for 20 h at 4 °C, and then the antibody/lysate mixture was incubated with agarose beads coated with anti-mouse IgG for 2 h at 4 °C with continuous gentle inversion. After the agarose beads were washed with lysis buffer three times, the 50 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added to the agarose beads. Fifteen μl of supernatant was applied onto 5–12% gradient SDS-PAGE, and the resolved proteins were analyzed on a Western blot using the polyclonal antibody against α-tubulin. The film was stripped with stripper buffer (100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, 2% SDS, pH 6.7) and then detected with antibody against Gαs to show sample loading. The Western blot was done as described previously (10Yu J.Z. Rasenick M.M. Mol. Pharmacol... 2002; 61: 352-359Google Scholar). Tubulin bands in immunoblotting were quantified, and the integrated optical density of each band was measured and was expressed as a percentage of control.Immunocytochemistry—PC12 cells grown on coverslips in 12-well plates were washed twice with PBS and fixed with cold 100% methanol (–20 °C) for 4 min after extraction with 0.2% (w/v) saponin in microtubule-stabilizing buffer (80 mm PIPES/KOH, pH 6.8, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 30% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm GTP). The coverslips were then incubated with PBSS buffer (PBS plus 0.01% saponin) containing 10% bovine serum albumin for 20 min, and then incubated in a 1:1000 dilution of anti-α-tubulin in PBSS buffer for 3 h. Subsequently, the coverslips were washed with PBSS four times and incubated with a 1:180 dilution of secondary antibodies labeled with TRITC in PBSS buffer for 40 min. These coverslips were washed with PBSS buffer four times and mounted on the slide with mounting medium. The slides were air-dried and examined by deconvolution microscopy.Microscopy—Cells were observed using a Nikon diaphot digital fluorescence microscope equipped with a 100-watt mercury arc lamp. Images were acquired with an interline charge-coupled device camera (1300 YHS; Roper Scientific, Trenton, NJ) driven by IP Lab imaging software (Scanalytics, Inc., Suitland, VA) and processed with IP Lab and Adobe Photoshop 5.0 (Adobe Systems, Mountain View, CA). For deconvolution microscopy, images were captured with the Applied Precision, Inc. (Seattle) DeltaVision system built on an Olympus IX-70 base. Z-stacks were deconvolved using the Softworx software. Sections were captured every 200 nm. Typically, 15 iterations based on a measured point spread function, calculated from 1 μm fluorescent beads, were used. PC12 cells transfected with Gαs-GFP were fixed, stained for tubulin, and shown as a volume projection of a z-series. Images were processed using Adobe Photoshop 5.0.Quantification of the internalization of Gαs-GFP was done as described previously (10Yu J.Z. Rasenick M.M. Mol. Pharmacol... 2002; 61: 352-359Google Scholar). The mean gray value within the cytoplasm in fluorescence images was collected by selecting an area that corresponded to the maximal cytoplasmic region for each cell using Scion Image (Scion, Frederick, MD).In order to quantify the colocalization between Gαs and microtubules, images were imported to Volocity (Improvision Inc., Waltham, MA) for deconvolution and colocalization analysis. Measuring the degree of colocalization was done by ""volocity quantitation,"" as described by Manders et al. (25Aoki C. Go C.G. Wu K. Siekevitz P. Brain Res... 1992; 596: 189-201Google Scholar). The extent of overlap between Gαs and microtubules was defined with Pearson's correlation.Purification of PC-tubulin and His6-tagged Gαs—PC-tubulin was purified from sheep brain by two cycles of assembly and disassembly followed by phosphocellulose chromatography. The tubulin preparation made by two assembly-disassembly cycles contains microtubule-associated proteins. These microtubule-associated proteins were removed by phosphocellulose chromatography. His6-tagged Gsα was expressed in the E. coli and purified as described earlier (26Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Methods Enzymol... 1991; 195: 202-215Google Scholar). Tryptophan fluorescence was determined with excitation at 280 nm and emission at 340 nm to monitor AlF–4-dependent conformational change of Gαs (27Chen N.F. Yu J.Z. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Rasenick M.M. J. Biol. Chem... 2003; 278: 15285-15290Google Scholar). The eluted proteins were stored at –80 °C for several months with no loss of functional activity.Pull-down Assay—Purified Gαs with the His6 tag was loaded with GDPβS or GTPγS, respectively, as described previously (28Zera E.M. Molloy D.P. Angleson J.K. Lamture J.B. Wensel T.G. Malinski J.A. J. Biol. Chem... 1996; 271: 12925-12931Google Scholar), and free nucleotides were removed by concentration/dialysis (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The GDP- and GTP-bound Gαs were incubated with a 1- or 3-fold molar ratio of PC-tubulin/Gα for 1 h, and complexes were incubated with 50 μl of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads. After 2.5 h at 4 °C, the samples were centrifuged and washed with 50 mm Tris buffer. The samples were resuspended in 1× SDS sample buffer and separated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue before drying.Surface Plasmon Resononance Using BIAcore 1000—To determine Gαs-tubulin affinity, amine groups on tubulin were cross-linked to a carboxymethyl dextran-coated CM5 BIAcore sensor chip (500–1000 resonance units). His6-tagged Gα Q213Ls or wild-type His6-tagged Gαs in buffer (10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 0.005% P-20, pH 6.9) was allowed to bind for 10 min at 25 °C, followed by 15 min of disassociation at a 10 μl/min flow rate, and kinetic curves were fit to a 1:1 association model after controlling for nonspecific binding in a sham-immobilized reference flow cell and buffer responses. KD and Bmax values were determined using equilibrium analysis for nine concentrations of Gαs in duplicate. Control experiments using ovalbumin failed to show binding to tubulin. Statistical analysis was done using BIAEvaluation version 4.1 and GraphPad Prism version 4.0 software. BIAcore 1000 and sensor chips were obtained from GE Healthcare.GTPase Assay—For steady-state assay of GTPase, PC-tubulin was allowed to bind GTP (23Roychowdhury S. Rasenick M.M. Biochemistry.. 1994; 33: 9800-9805Google Scholar). The samples were then incubated with Gαs-GDPβS or Gαs-GTPγS or ovalbumin at 30 °C for 30 min and treated with 1% SDS at room temperature for 15 min. Nucleotide analysis was done by thin layer chromatography on polyethyleneimine-cellulose plates. Two μl of a 10 mm solution of GTP and GDP were spotted 1.5 cm apart on a polyethyleneimine-cellulose thin layer plate, followed by 2 μl of each sample. The spots containing [32P]GTP or [32P]GDP were visualized with a UV lamp, and plates were exposed to film for autoradiography. Quantitative analysis was done by measuring the integrated optical density of each GDP spot. The integrated optical density represents the GTPase activity as measured by GDP formation.To determine single-turnover tubulin GTPase activity, tubulin was loaded with [32P]GTP, and unbound nucleotide was removed by gel filtration using a P6-DG column (Bio-Rad). Tubulin-GTP (0.6–0.9 mol of 32P/mol of tubulin) was added to Gα Q213Ls-GTP in buffer (100 mm PIPES, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, pH 6.9) at 37 °C for 5–20 min, the reaction was stopped with 5% trichloroacetic acid, and released 32Pi was quantified after charcoal extraction (29Mejillano M.R. Shivanna B.D. Himes R.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys... 1996; 336: 130-138Google Scholar).Measurement of Detergent-insoluble Microtubules—To measure microtubule mass, detergent-extracted cytoskeletons, free of unassembled tubulin, were prepared under microtubule-stabilizing conditions essentially as described by Solomon et al. (30Solomon F. Magendantz M. Salzman A. Cell.. 1979; 18: 431-438Google Scholar, 31Drubin D.G. Feinstein S.C. Shooter E.M. Kirschner M.W. J. Cell Biol... 1985; 101: 1799-1807Google Scholar). The tubulin content of the cytoskeletons was measured with immunoblot. In brief, cells in a 25-ml flask were washed once with 37 °C PBS and once with extraction buffer (0.1 m PIPES, 1 mm MgSO4, 2 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 m glycerol, pH 6.75). Cells were subsequently extracted twice for 8 min with 0.5 ml of extraction buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors. After excess extraction buffer was drained from each flask, 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (25 mm Na2HPO4, 0.4 m NaCl, 0.5% SDS, pH 7.2) was added for 3–5 min to solubilize the detergent-extracted cytoskeletons. In addition, the 0.5 ml of extraction buffer used to extract PC12 cells was centrifuged for 1 min to collect insoluble material that came off of the culture flask during extraction. This material was added back to the lysis mixture in lysis buffer. The viscous cytoskeletal lysate was boiled for 3 min and then centrifuged for l0 min (2000 × g) in a tabletop centrifuge, and the DNA-containing pellet was removed. The protein concentration of the extracted and cytoskeletal fractions was determined by the Lowry assay. Equal amounts of cytoskeletal protein fraction samples were loaded onto SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and the tubulin contents were determined by immunoblotting.Quantification of Neurite Outgrowth—The extent of neurite outgrowth was quantitated in more than three independent experiments on living cells. About 100 transfected PC12 or PC12–123.7 cells were scored for each experiment. The morphological differentiation of cells was determined by the percentage of neurite-bearing cells. One individual, blinded to experimental conditions, scored a cell as neurite-bearing if a cell contained at least one slender projection that exceeded the cellular diameter in length.Statistical Analysis—Data are from at least three different independent experiments and expressed as mean ± S.E. Significant differences (p < 0.05) were determined by a one-way analysis of variance using the Prism version 3.0 software package for statistical analysis (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA).RESULTSThe GTP-bound Form of Gαs Interacts Preferentially with Tubulin in Vitro and in Vivo—To test whether the activated (GTP-bound) or inactive (GDP-bound) form of Gαs differentially binds to tubulin, purified His6-tagged Gαs was loaded with GTPγS or GDPβS and incubated with PC-tubulin. The results indicate that tubulin cosedimented with Gαs-GTPγS but not Gαs-GDPβS when proteins were incubated at equal molar concentrations (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. 2A). In the presence of a 3-fold molar excess of tubulin to Gαs, both Gαs-GDPβS and Gαs-GTPγS bound tubulin. However, a strong preference was consistently shown for tubulin binding to the GTP form of Gαs. To confirm that the activated form of Gαs was binding to tubulin, we compared the affinity of wild-type Gαs loaded with GDP to constitutively activated Gα Q213Ls using surface plasmon resononace. The results (Fig. 1B) showed that purified Gα Q213Ls bound strongly to immobilized tubulin, whereas wild-type Gαs-GDP did not. Gα Q213Ls bound with a KD of 102 ± 18 nm and Bmax of 127 ± 6 resonance units, whereas wild-type Gαs-GDP was insufficient to calculate their values (Fig. 1B).These in vitro results gave rise to the possibility that activated Gαs interacts with microtubules and tubulin in intact cells. To test this, adenoviruses with Gαs (Ad/Gαs) or its activated mutant (Ad/GαsQ227L) were constructed (supplemental Fig. 1). PC12 cells were infected with Ad/Gαs or Ad/GαsQ227L, and expressions of both constructs were approximately equal and 2.5-fold that of endogenous Gαs (supplemental Fig. 2B). Immunoprecipitation was conducted with anti-HA polyclonal antibody. The cells expressing Ad/GαsQ227L or Ad/Gαs treated with cholera toxin showed a 4-fold increase in association between tubulin and Gαs compared with that in cells infected with Ad/Gαs (Fig. 1C and supplemental Fig. 3A). No changes in the level of Gαs loaded were observed by Western blotting (Fig. 1D). Since activation of Gαs, either by mutation or cholera toxin, can increase intracellular levels of cAMP and activates PKA, it is necessary to determine whether this affects Gαs association with tubulin and microtubules. Cells were treated with Rp-cAMP (an inhibitor of PKA) prior and subsequent to infection with Ad/GαsQ227L. Gαs binding to tubulin was maintained in the presence of the cAMP inhibitor, suggesting that the interaction is independent of the cAMP/PKA pathway (supplemental Fig. 3B). Note that Gα Q213Ls and GαsQ227L represent the same mutant in the short and long isoform of Gαs, respectively, and they appear to be functionally identical.Cholera Toxin Promotes Gαs-GFP Localization on Cellular Microtubules—We previously developed a fully functional Gαs-GFP fusion protein that couples to G protein-coupled receptors and activates adenylyl cyclase. We have used this construct to observe that activation of the fusion protein by receptor agonists or cholera toxin promoted Gαs-GFP internalization (10Yu J.Z. Rasenick M.M. Mol. Pharmacol... 2002; 61: 352-359Google Scholar). In order to determine if activated Gαs associates with microtubules, PC12 cells were transfected with Gαs-GFP. Transfected cells were treated with cholera toxin to activate Gαs-GFP or forskolin to stimulate adenylyl cyclase and increase cAMP. Microtubules were visualized in saponin-extracted cells, which remove soluble unpolymerized tubulin. Deconvolved fluorescent images showed that either forskolin or cholera toxin treatment promoted neurite outgrowth (Fig. 2). However, cholera toxin activation of Gαs-GFP, but not forskolin or vehicle treatments, resulted in a displacement of Gαs-GFP from the plasma membrane. Compared with pretreatment values, the mean gray value of Gαs in cytoplasm was increased by 60 ± 12% following cholera toxin treatment; however, no significant increase in cytoplasmic Gαs was observed in cells treated with forskolin. Gαs colocalization along microtubules was seen in cells treated with cholera toxin but not in those treated with forskolin (Fig. 2). Quantification of colocalization revealed that cholera toxin increased the Pearson's correlation from 0.397 ± 0.02 to 0.591 ± 0.02. However, forskolin treatment did not significantly change the Pearson's correlation relative to control (0.393 ± 0.02 versus 0.397 ± 0.09). These results suggest that activation of Gαs induces Gαs translocation to the cytoplasm, where it associates with microtubules.FIGURE 2Activated, intracellular, Gαs-GFP colocalizes with microtubules. PC12 cells expressing Gαs-GFP were treated with vehicle (Control), cholera toxin (CTX), or forskolin and fixed with cold methanol after extraction with saponin. Microtubules were visualized with a α-tubulin antibody and a rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody. Cells were examined with deconvolution microcopy. Yellow shows the overlay of Gαs-GFP along microtubules. Tubulin (red) and Gαs-GFP (green) are also shown in the image.

Although activated GαsQ227L significantly increased the number of cells bearing neuritis, wild-type Gαs did not (Fig. 3). In an effort to clarify the role of PKA in this phenomenon, Gαs and GαsQ227L were expressed in a PKA-deficient PC12 cell line (123.7 cells), and expression of both constructs was to a similar extent (about 2.5-fold of endogenous Gαs). Expression of GαsQ227L in 123.7 cells induced neurite outgrowth, but this was not observed in cells expressing GFP alone or in cells infected with wild-type Gαs virus (Fig. 3A). Expression of GαsQ227L promoted neurite outgrowth in 35% of PKA-deficient 123.7 cells and 60% of native PC12 cells (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that PKA contributes to neurite outgrowth but is not required for Gαs-induced neurite outgrowth. In conclusion, activated Gαs can induce morphologic changes independently of PKA in PC12 cells, suggesting that Gαs can signal independently of this canonical pathway to modulate cytoskeleton-related morphologic changes.FIGURE 3Activated Gαs promotes neurite outgrowth i"

https://openalex.org/W2074506384,"As pathogens that circumvent the host immune response are favoured by selection, so are host alleles that reduce parasite load. Such evolutionary processes leave their signature on the genes involved. Deciphering modes of selection operating on immune genes might reveal the nature of host-pathogen interactions and factors that govern susceptibility in host populations. Such understanding would have important public health implications.We analyzed polymorphisms in four mosquito immune genes (SP14D1, GNBP, defensin, and gambicin) to decipher selection effects, presumably mediated by pathogens. Using samples of Anopheles arabiensis, An. quadriannulatus and four An. gambiae populations, as well as published sequences from other Culicidae, we contrasted patterns of polymorphisms between different functional units of the same gene within and between populations. Our results revealed selection signatures operating on different time scales. At the most recent time scale, within-population diversity revealed purifying selection. Between populations and between species variation revealed reduced differentiation (GNBP and gambicin) at coding vs. noncoding- regions, consistent with balancing selection. McDonald-Kreitman tests between An. quadriannulatus and both sibling species revealed higher fixation rate of synonymous than nonsynonymous substitutions (GNBP) in accordance with frequency dependent balancing selection. At the longest time scale (>100 my), PAML analysis using distant Culicid taxa revealed positive selection at one codon in gambicin. Patterns of genetic variation were independent of exposure to human pathogens.Purifying selection is the most common form of selection operating on immune genes as it was detected on a contemporary time scale on all genes. Selection for ""hypervariability"" was not detected, but negative balancing selection, detected at a recent evolutionary time scale between sibling species may be rather common. Detection of positive selection at the deepest evolutionary time scale suggests that it occurs infrequently, possibly in association with speciation events. Our results provided no evidence to support the hypothesis that selection was mediated by pathogens that are transmitted to humans."
https://openalex.org/W2081049732,"Protein phosphorylation is involved in posttranslational control of essentially all biological processes. Using mass spectrometry, recent analyses of whole phosphoproteomes led to the identification of numerous new phosphorylation sites. However, the function of most of these sites remained unknown. We chose the Drosophila Bicaudal-D protein to estimate the importance of individual phosphorylation events. Being involved in different cellular processes, BicD is required for oocyte determination, for RNA transport during oogenesis and embryogenesis, and for photoreceptor nuclei migration in the developing eye. The numerous roles of BicD and the available evidence for functional importance of BicD phosphorylation led us to identify eight phosphorylation sites of BicD, and we tested a total of 14 identified and suspected phosphoserine residues for their functional importance in vivo in flies. Surprisingly, all these serines turned out to be dispensable for providing sufficient basal BicD activity for normal growth and development. However, in a genetically sensitized background where the BicDA40V protein variant provides only partial activity, serine 103 substitutions are not neutral anymore, but show surprising differences. The S103D substitution completely inactivates the protein, whereas S103A behaves neutral, and the S103F substitution, isolated in a genetic screen, restores BicDA40V function. Our results suggest that many BicD phosphorylation events may either be fortuitous or play a modulating function as shown for Ser103. Remarkably, amongst the Drosophila serines we found phosphorylated, Ser103 is the only one that is fully conserved in mammalian BicD."
https://openalex.org/W2041022431,"Cell growth critically depends on signalling pathways whose regulation is the focus of intense research. Without utilizing a priori knowledge of the relative importance of pathway components, we have applied in silico computational methods to the EGF-induced MAPK cascade. Specifically, we systematically perturbed the entire parameter space, including initial conditions, using a Monte Carlo approach, and investigate which protein components or kinetic reaction steps contribute to the differentiation of ERK responses. The model, based on previous work by Brightman and Fell (2000), is composed of 28 reactions, 27 protein molecules, and 48 parameters from both mass action and Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Our multi-parametric systems analysis confirms that Raf inactivation is one of the key steps regulating ERK responses to be either transient or sustained. Furthermore, the results of amplitude-differential ERK phosphorylations within the transient case are mainly attributed to the balance between activation and inactivation of Ras while duration-differential ERK responses for the sustained case are, in addition to Ras, markedly affected by dephospho-/phosphorylation of both MEK and ERK. Our sub-module perturbations showed that MEK and ERK's contribution to this differential ERK activation originates from fluctuations in intermediate pathway module components such as Ras and Raf, implicating a cooperative regulatory mode among the key components. The initial protein concentrations of corresponding reactions such as Ras, GAP, and Raf also influence the distinct signalling outputs of ERK activation. We then compare these results with those obtained from a single-parametric perturbation approach using an overall state sensitivity (OSS) analysis. The OSS findings indicate a more pronounced role of ERK's inhibitory feedback effect on catalysing the dissociation of the SOS complex. Both approaches reveal the presence of multiple specific reactions involved in the distinct dynamics of ERK responses and the cell fate decisions they trigger. This work adds a mechanistic insight of the contribution of key pathway components, thus may support the identification of biomarkers for pharmaceutical drug discovery processes."
https://openalex.org/W2056258034,"Spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease characterized by cerebellar ataxia and seizures. The disease is caused by a large ATTCT repeat expansion in the ATXN10 gene. The first families reported with SCA10 were of Mexican origin, but the disease was soon after described in Brazilian families of mixed Portuguese and Amerindian ancestry. The origin of the SCA10 expansion and a possible founder effect that would account for its geographical distribution have been the source of speculation over the last years. To unravel the mutational origin and spread of the SCA10 expansion, we performed an extensive haplotype study, using closely linked STR markers and intragenic SNPs, in families from Brazil and Mexico. Our results showed (1) a shared disease haplotype for all Brazilian and one of the Mexican families, and (2) closely-related haplotypes for the additional SCA10 Mexican families; (3) little or null genetic distance in small normal alleles of different repeat sizes, from the same SNP lineage, indicating that they are being originated by a single step mechanism; and (4) a shared haplotype for pure and interrupted expanded alleles, pointing to a gene conversion model for its generation. In conclusion, we show evidence for an ancestral common origin for SCA10 in Latin America, which might have arisen in an ancestral Amerindian population and later have been spread into the mixed populations of Mexico and Brazil."
https://openalex.org/W2130723383,"Although the prevalence of inflammatory airway diseases is steadily growing, our knowledge regarding the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms is fragmentary. The striking simplicity of the fruit fly's airway epithelium, which is composed of epithelial cells only, justifies its use as a model to study general features and response characteristics of airway epithelia in general. Infection with the gram-negative pathogen Erwinia carotovora induces an immune response in all epithelial cells via activation of the immune deficiency (IMD) pathway, but the transcriptional profile differs significantly from that observed after ectopic activation of this signaling pathway. After strong infections, genes controlling central aspects of tracheal development are reactivated, a response that is not seen after ectopic IMD pathway activation. Presumably to counteract infection-induced cell death-promoting signals, a survival response is launched, characterized by the concurrent expression and activation of the longevity genes dfoxo and dthor. Regions of the airways featuring the strongest immune reactions show substantial remodeling, which is characterized by a significant thickening of the epithelial cells. In conclusion, features related to those observed in inflammatory diseases of the human airways are apparently part of the normal response repertoire of airway epithelia to infection."
https://openalex.org/W2113123349,"Elevated ambient levels of particulate matter air pollution are associated with excess daily mortality, largely attributable to increased rates of cardiovascular events. We have previously reported that particulate matter induces p53-dependent apoptosis in primary human alveolar epithelial cells. Activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway by p53 often requires the transcription of the proapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins Noxa, Puma, or both. In this study, we exposed alveolar epithelial cells in culture and mice to fine particulate matter <2.5 microm in diameter (PM(2.5)) collected from the ambient air in Washington, D. C. Exposure to PM(2.5) induced apoptosis in primary alveolar epithelial cells from wild-type but not Noxa(-/-) mice. Twenty-four hours after the intratracheal instillation of PM(2.5), wild-type mice showed increased apoptosis in the lung and increased levels of mRNA encoding Noxa but not Puma. These changes were associated with increased permeability of the alveolar-capillary membrane and inflammation. All of these findings were absent or attenuated in Noxa(-/-) animals. We conclude that PM(2.5)-induced cell death requires Noxa both in vitro and in vivo and that Noxa-dependent cell death might contribute to PM-induced alveolar epithelial dysfunction and the resulting inflammatory response."

However, existing methodologies, involving metabolic labelling by incorporation of radioactive amino acids into nascent polypeptides, cannot be applied to monitor protein synthesis in specific cells or tissues, in live specimens. We have developed a novel approach for monitoring protein synthesis in specific cells or tissues, in vivo. Fluorescent reporter proteins such as GFP are expressed in specific cells and tissues of interest or throughout animals using appropriate promoters. Protein synthesis rates are assessed by following fluorescence recovery after partial photobleaching of the fluorophore at targeted sites. We evaluate the method by examining protein synthesis rates in diverse cell types of live, wild type or mRNA translation-defective Caenorhabditis elegans animals. Because it is non-invasive, our approach allows monitoring of protein synthesis in single cells or tissues with intrinsically different protein synthesis rates. Furthermore, it can be readily implemented in other organisms or cell culture systems."
https://openalex.org/W1984102669,"Background We have previously reported that intestinal epithelium-specific TAK1 deleted mice exhibit severe inflammation and mortality at postnatal day 1 due to TNF-induced epithelial cell death. Although deletion of TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) can largely rescue those neonatal phenotypes, mice harboring double deletion of TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) and intestinal epithelium-specific deletion of TAK1 (TNFR1KO/TAK1IEKO) still occasionally show increased inflammation. This indicates that TAK1 is important for TNF-independent regulation of intestinal integrity. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study, we investigated the TNF-independent role of TAK1 in the intestinal epithelium. Because the inflammatory conditions were sporadically developed in the double mutant TNFR1KO/TAK1IEKO mice, we hypothesize that epithelial TAK1 signaling is important for preventing stress-induced barrier dysfunction. To test this hypothesis, the TNFR1KO/TAK1IEKO mice were subjected to acute colitis by administration of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). We found that loss of TAK1 significantly augments DSS-induced experimental colitis. DSS induced weight loss, intestinal damages and inflammatory markers in TNFR1KO/TAK1IEKO mice at higher levels compared to the TNFR1KO control mice. Apoptosis was strongly induced and epithelial cell proliferation was decreased in the TAK1-deficient intestinal epithelium upon DSS exposure. These suggest that epithelial-derived TAK1 signaling is important for cytoprotection and repair against injury. Finally, we showed that TAK1 is essential for interleukin 1- and bacterial components-induced expression of cytoprotective factors such as interleukin 6 and cycloxygenase 2. Conclusions Homeostatic cytokines and microbes-induced intestinal epithelial TAK1 signaling regulates cytoprotective factors and cell proliferation, which is pivotal for protecting the intestinal epithelium against injury."

However, mechanisms underlying such ectopic bone formation are not fully understood. Bone morphogenetic protein (BMPs) are defined as inducers of ectopic bone formation, and they are regulated by several types of inhibitors. ANA is an antiproliferative molecule that belongs to Tob/BTG family, but its activity in bone metabolism has not been known. Here, we examined the role of ANA on ectopic bone formation activity of BMP. In ANA-deficient and wild-type mice, BMP2 was implanted to induce ectopic bone formation in muscle. ANA deficiency increased mass of newly formed bone in vivo compared with wild-type based on 3D-μCT analyses. ANA mRNA was expressed in bone in vivo as well as in osteoblastic cells in vitro. Such ANA mRNA levels were increased by BMP2 treatment in MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells. Overexpression of ANA suppressed BMP-induced expression of luciferase reporter gene linked to BMP response elements in these cells. Conversely, ANA mRNA knockdown by small interference RNA enhanced the BMP-dependent BMP response element reporter expression. It also enhanced BMP-induced osteoblastic differentiation in muscle-derived C2C12 cells. Immunoprecipitation assay indicated that ANA interacts with Smad8.

Akiyama T. Usui M. Yoneda M. Yoshida Y. Nakamura T. Minowa O. Noda M. Tanaka S. Noda T. Yamamoto T. FEBS Lett... 2008; 582: 1313-1318Google Scholar). These observations suggest that each of the molecules in the Tob/BTG family members may possess their distinct functions. ANA (abundant in neuroepithelial area)/BTG3 is known to inhibit progression of the cell cycle in NIH3T3 cells (18Guehenneux F. Duret L. Callanan M. Bouhas R. Hayette S. Berthet C. Samarut C. Rimokh R. Birot A.M. Wang Q. Magaud J.P. Rouault J.P. Leukemia.. 1997; 11: 370-375Google Scholar). ANA mRNA is expressed in a variety of adult tissues, including testis, prostate, ovary, thymus, and liver. In embryonic mice, ANA is detected in the ventricular zone of brain, Meckel's cartilage, and rib cartilage (10Yoshida Y. Matsuda S. Ikematsu N. Kawamura-Tsuzuku J. Inazawa J. Umemori H. Yamamoto T. Oncogene.. 1998; 16: 2687-2693Google Scholar). In vitro, ANA associates with Caf1/Cnot7 (CCR4 transcription factor-associated protein) (19Yoshida Y. Hosoda E. Nakamura T. Yamamoto T. Jpn. J. Cancer Res... 2001; 92: 592-596Google Scholar), which is involved in negative regulation of bone mass (20Washio-Oikawa K. Nakamura T. Usui M. Yoneda M. Ezura Y. Ishikawa I. Nakashima K. Yamamoto T. Noda M. J. Cell. Biochem... 2006; 99: 538-544Google Scholar, 21Washio-Oikawa K. Nakamura T. Usui M. Yoneda M. Ezura Y. Ishikawa I. Nakashima K. Noda T. Yamamoto T. Noda M. J. Bone Miner. Res... 2007; 22: 1217-1223Google Scholar). Although ANA has been detected in embryonic cartilage, its effects on BMP-induced bone formation have not been known. Recently, ectopic and heterotopic ossifications have been reported to be in association with high levels of expression of BMP2 (22Toom A. Arend A. Gunnarsson D. Ulfsparre R. Suutre S. Haviko T. Selstam G. Calcif. Tissue Int... 2007; 80: 259-267Google Scholar). Here, we examined whether ANA regulates BMP activities with respect to ectopic bone formation. To investigate the influence of ANA, we implanted BMP into the muscle of either wild-type or ANA-deficient mice and compared the levels of ectopic bone formation. We found that ANA deficiency enhances BMP2-induced ectopic bone formation. We further found that ANA suppresses BMP signaling pathway in osteoblasts at least in part via modulation of transcriptional events. Generation of ANA-deficient Mice—ANA-deficient mice in C57B6/J background were produced by Yoneda et al. as reported elsewhere (34Yoneda M. Suzuki T. Nakamura T. Ajima R. Yoshida Y. Kakuta S. Sudo K. Iwakura Y. Shibutani M. Mitsumori K. Yokota J. Yamamoto T. Cancer Sci... 2008; 100: 225-232Google Scholar). Heterozygous F1 mice were crossed to produce homozygous ANA-deficient mice. Wild-type and ANA-deficient mice were maintained under conventional conditions. All the animal experiments were approved by animal welfare committee of our university. BMP Implantation Assay—Sixteen-week-old either wild-type or ANA-deficient male mice were used as recipients of BMP implantation. The quadriceps muscle was exposed, and an incision was made in the muscle to implant a pellet of cholesterol-bearing pullulan cross-linked by polyethylene glycol (CHP-PEG) containing 2 μg of rhBMP2 (in the right side thigh muscle) or another CHP-PEG pellet containing vehicle alone (in the left side thigh muscle) (23Akiyoshi K. Kobayashi S. Shichibe S. Mix D. Baudys M. Kim S.W. Sunamoto J. J. Controlled Release.. 1998; 54: 313-320Google Scholar). CHP-PEG was previously used to carry bone anabolic agent such as prostaglandin E2 and has been proven to be effective in bone formation in vivo (24Kato N. Hasegawa U. Morimoto N. Saita Y. Nakashima K. Ezura Y. Kurosawa H. Akiyosh K. Noda M. J. Cell. Biochem... 2007; 101: 1063-1070Google Scholar). Muscle and skin were sutured respectively. The mice were sacrificed 2 weeks later. Bone Marrow Ablation—The left femora of 9-week-old male mice were subjected to bone marrow ablation. Briefly, a drill hole was made using a 26-gauge needle from the intercondyle groove at the distal end of the femur. The hole was gradually expanded by insertion of dental files (0.15–0.6 mm diameter). Kirschner wire with a diameter of 0.6 mm was then inserted into the bone marrow, and x-ray images were taken to confirm that the bone marrow was precisely ablated. Finally the wire was removed and the wound was closed. The bone was harvested 9 days later. 3D-μCT Analyses—Femur and newly formed bone (ossicles) induced by BMP implantation in muscle were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight and fixed again in 70% ethanol, and then stored at 4 °C for 3D-μCT analyses. Three-dimensional images of femur and newly formed bone after BMP implantation were taken by using Scan-Xmate-E090 (Comscan Tecno Co.), and the bone volume was quantified by using an image analyzer (TRI/3D-BON, Ratoc System Engineering Co.) for the analyses. LacZ Staining—To examine the expression pattern of ANA in bone, E16.5 heterogeneous mutant embryos carrying LacZ in one allele of the ANA gene locus were subjected to LacZ staining as previously described (20Washio-Oikawa K. Nakamura T. Usui M. Yoneda M. Ezura Y. Ishikawa I. Nakashima K. Yamamoto T. Noda M. J. Cell. Biochem... 2006; 99: 538-544Google Scholar). Briefly mouse embryos were fixed in a phosphate buffer containing 0.2% glutaraldehyde, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, and 0.8% formaldehyde for 45 min at room temperature, rinsed twice in a buffer containing 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.2% Nonidet P-40 for a half hour each and incubated in X-gal staining solution (1 mg/ml X-gal, 5 mm K4Fe(CN)6, 5 mm K3Fe(CN)6 in rinse buffer) for 1–3 days. After staining, embryos were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline and refixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C overnight. For frozen sections, the spine and lower limb were removed, immersed in 30% sucrose solution overnight, and embedded in Tissue-Tek O.C.T. compound. Frozen sections (5 μm in thickness) were prepared using a microtome (Leica CM 3050 S). Transfection and Luciferase Assay—MC3T3-E1 cells were seeded in 24-well plates at a density of 1 × 104 cells per well 1 day before transfection. One day later, the cells were transfected with plasmid DNA and/or siRNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacture's protocol. For overexpression experiments, we transfected human ANA expression vector constructed in a pME-18S mammalian expression vector with insertion of full-length human ANA cDNA or an empty vector in combination with 7× BMP response element (BRE) containing luciferase DNA (7×BRE-luc). After culture for 48 h in the presence or absence of rhBMP2 (200 ng/ml), the cells were lysed in Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega), and the lysates were mixed with luciferin substrates. Bioluminescence was measured by using Lumat LB 9507 analyzer (Berthold Technologies). We also transfected siRNA for ANA (Ambion) or Silencer Negative Control (Ambion) as a reference. After incubation for 4 h in the presence or absence of rhBMP2, the cells were lysed for measurement of luciferase activities. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—COS-7 cells were transfected with 6Myc-tagged Smads (14Yoshida Y. Tanaka S. Umemori H. Minowa O. Usui M. Ikematsu N. Hosoda E. Imamura T. Kuno J. Yamashita T. Miyazono K. Noda M. Noda T. Yamamoto T. Cell.. 2000; 103: 1085-1097Google Scholar) and FLAG-tagged human ANA expression vector using FuGene6 (Roche Applied Science). After incubation for 48 h cells were lysed with TNE lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm NaF, 1% aprotinin, 50 μm MG132). After precleared with protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences Bioscience), the lysates were incubated sequentially with monoclonal antibodies to FLAG (M2, Sigma) and protein G-Sepharose. Immunoprecipitates were rinsed five times with lysis buffer followed by immunoblotting with monoclonal antibodies to Myc (9E10, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). ALP Activity Assay—C2C12 cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 3 × 103 cells per well 1 day before transfection. These cells were transfected with siRNA for ANA or negative control. After incubation for 72 h in the presence or absence of rhBMP2, the cells were lysed with lysis buffer, and the lysates were subjected to examination of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity (14Yoshida Y. Tanaka S. Umemori H. Minowa O. Usui M. Ikematsu N. Hosoda E. Imamura T. Kuno J. Yamashita T. Miyazono K. Noda M. Noda T. Yamamoto T. Cell.. 2000; 103: 1085-1097Google Scholar). Primary Cultures of Osteoblast-enriched Cells—Primary cultures of osteoblast-enriched cells were prepared as described previously (25Bellows C.G. Ciaccia A. Heersche J.N.M. Bone.. 1998; 23: 119-125Google Scholar). Briefly, mouse osteoblast-enriched cells were prepared from the calvariae of 3- to 5-day old newborn mice as follows. Calvariae of the newborn mice were taken aseptically and rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline. They were digested in a solution containing 2.5% collagenase (Sigma), 0.25% trypsin, 40 mm EDTA, and 1% antibiotics in phosphate-buffered saline sequentially for six times. The last three fractions out of the six fractions were collected and cultured in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% antibiotics. Reverse Transcription-Real-time PCR Analyses—Tissue RNAs were obtained from adult mice according to the methods described elsewhere (26Mirams M. Robinson B.G. Mason R.S. Nelson A.E. Bone.. 2004; 35: 1192-1199Google Scholar). MC3T3-E1 cells and the osteoblast-enriched cells obtained from mouse calvariae were cultured in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum with in the presence or absence of rhBMP2 (100 ng/ml). Twenty-four hours later, total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription was performed using 1 μg of total RNA, oligo(dT) primers (Invitrogen), and Superscript II transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacture's protocol. Real-time PCR was carried out using SYBR Green Supermix and iCycler (Bio-Rad). The data were analyzed by using iQ5 data analyzing software. Primer sequences for real-time PCR were as follows: ana, forward (5′-CCA AAG GTC AGG CCT ACA GA-3′) and reverse (5′-CCC AGG TCG CTG TAC AAG AT-3′); gapdh, forward (5′-AGA AGG TGG TGA AGC AGG CAT C-3′) and reverse (5′-CGA AGG TGG AAG AGT GGG AGT TG-3′). All the quantified data were normalized against those for GAPDH. Statistical Evaluation—Data were expressed as mean ± S.D. for all values. Results were evaluated using Students' t test or one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey-Kramers' posthoc test. ANA mRNA Is Expressed in Bone Tissue and in Osteoblasts—As an initial step of examination, RNAs from adult mouse tissues were obtained and ANA mRNA expression levels normalized against GAPDH levels were evaluated based on real-time PCR. ANA mRNA was expressed in adult bone tissues in vivo (Fig. 1). ANA mRNA is also expressed in other tissues such as bone marrow, brain, heart, and liver. Further analyses revealed that ANA mRNA was expressed in the primary cultures of osteoblast-enriched cells and the levels of expression in these cells were higher than those in RNAs prepared from bone tissues (Fig. 1). ANA Is Expressed in Developing Bone—To localize ANA-expressing cells in bone in vivo, tibiae, and lumbar vertebrae of the E16.5 homozygote ANA-deficient embryos containing LacZ gene in both of the ANA locus were subjected to LacZ staining. LacZ activity was observed in the cells of the epiphyseal bone revealing the expression in osteoblasts (Fig. 2A). Hypertrophic chondrocytes in the femur (Fig. 2B) and proliferating chondrocytes (Fig. 2C) are also positive for LacZ. Some of the stromal cells were also positive for LacZ staining. Phase-contrast images of the corresponding regions indicated the presence of cells that were not shown in LacZ staining images (Fig. 2, A′–C′). LacZ-positive osteoblasts were also aligned along the bone collar (Fig. 2D). As control, the cells in wild-type embryos were negative for LacZ staining (Fig. 2, E, bone collar, and F, cartilage). These observations indicated that ANA is expressed in the skeletal cells in developing bone. The Link between ANA and BMP Action in Osteoblastic Differentiations—Because ANA is expressed in osteoblasts, we examined the link between ANA and BMP. First, we tested whether ANA is a target gene of BMP action. MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells were cultured in the presence or absence of rhBMP2. rhBMP2 treatment enhanced the levels of ANA mRNA expression normalized against GAPDH ∼2-fold compared with vehicle treatment (Fig. 3). Thus, ANA is a novel target of BMP in these cells. Next, we examined the function of ANA on BMP signaling. For this purpose, human ANA expression vector or an empty vector and a luciferase reporter plasmid containing BRE were co-transfected into MC3T3-E1 cells, and these cells were subjected to BMP2 treatment. BMP treatment enhanced the BRE reporter activity in the presence of empty vector (Fig. 4, lanes 2 versus 1). In contrast, overexpression of human ANA suppressed BMP-induced BRE activity (Fig. 4, lanes 4 versus 3). To carry out reverse experiments to examine the function of ANA on BMP activity, siRNAs were used. Transfection of siRNA for ANA reduced ANA mRNA expression levels by ∼50% compared with the cells treated with control siRNA (Fig. 5A). Under this condition, siRNAs were co-transfected with BRE-luc reporter, and these MC3T3-E1 cells were subjected to BMP treatment. Transfection of siRNA targeting ANA enhanced the BMP2-induced reporter activities ∼2-fold compared with control siRNA (Fig. 5B). These data indicated that ANA is inhibitory against BMP-induced transcriptional events. We then asked how ANA interferes BMP signaling in the cells. Because ANA does not have a nuclear localizing signal, it is a cytoplasmic protein. Because Smads mediate BMP signaling events in the cytoplasmic pathway from the receptor to the nuclei, we tested whether ANA interacts with Smads. 6Myc-tagged Smads and FLAG-tagged ANA were transfected into COS-7 cells, and the interactions of ANA and Smads were tested based on immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblotting. Although BMP signaling is mediated by Smad1 and -5, ANA did not interact with Smad1 or -5 (Fig. 6, lanes 4 and 6). However, ANA specifically interacts with Smad8 (Fig. 6, lanes 9). Both human and mouse ANA were co-precipitated with Smad8 (Fig. 6, lanes 9 and 10). Thus, ANA-Smad8 interaction can be observed regardless of different species. We further examined whether observations on the above intracellular events are translated into ANA regulation of cellular function. Because ALP activity is a phenotypic marker of osteoblastic differentiation, we measured ALP activities in C2C12 cells transfected with siRNA targeting ANA or control siRNA and cultured in the presence or absence of rhBMP2. C2C12 cells are a muscular cell line, and BMP treatment converts these cells to become osteoblasts. This in vitro phenomenon mimics the ectopic bone formation activity of BMP in vivo. BMP treatment enhanced ALP activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 7, white bar). Transfection of siRNA for ANA, which suppressed ANA expression by ∼50% compared with control (data not shown), enhanced ALP activity in the cells treated with higher concentration of rhBMP2 (Fig. 7). These results indicated that ANA suppresses BMP actions on the expression of osteoblastic differentiation marker in muscle lineage cells. ANA Deficiency Enhances the Levels of Ectopic Bone Formation Induced by BMP2 Implantation in Muscle—To examine the effects of ANA deficiency on ectopic bone formation, we implanted BMP in muscles. It is notable that original definition of BMP activity is to induce ectopic bone formation in vivo. rhBMP2 or vehicle was transplanted into the femoral quadriceps muscles of the right side or the left side, respectively, in either wild-type or ANA-deficient mice using CHP-PEG Nanogel as a carrier (23Akiyoshi K. Kobayashi S. Shichibe S. Mix D. Baudys M. Kim S.W. Sunamoto J. J. Controlled Release.. 1998; 54: 313-320Google Scholar, 24Kato N. Hasegawa U. Morimoto N. Saita Y. Nakashima K. Ezura Y. Kurosawa H. Akiyosh K. Noda M. J. Cell. Biochem... 2007; 101: 1063-1070Google Scholar) (Fig. 8A). We implanted 2 μg of BMP based on our previous experiments that indicated that this dose is optimal for ectopic bone formation in mice (data not shown). Plain x-ray images indicated that ANA deficiency enhanced the size of radiopaque shadow in quadriceps (Fig. 8B). The ossicles in muscle were excised from quadriceps and were subjected to 3D-μCT analyses. Quantification of the three-dimensional images indicated that ANA deficiency increased the bone volume of the ossicles in this implantation assay ∼2-fold compared with wild type (Fig. 8C). Thus, ANA suppresses in vivo bona fide BMP activity to induce ectopic bone formation in muscle. Quality of ectopically formed bone in ANA-deficient mice was examined morphologically. Histological inspection showed that the ossicles formed in ANA-deficient mice contained woven bones similar to those formed in wild-type mice (Fig. 9, A and B). In some part of the section, occasional chondrogenic tissues were observed in the ossicles of both wild-type and ANA-deficient mice (data not shown). Osteoclasts were also observed in these ossicles, and their distribution and shape were similar in wild-type and ANA-deficient groups (Fig. 9, C–F). Thus, morphological properties of the ossicles (bone) induced in ANA-deficient mice were similar to those of the ossicles (bone) in wild type. To examine whether the effects of ANA deficiency on bone formation is specific to BMP-induced ectopic bone formation or they are also seen in another bone formation model in vivo, bone marrow ablation was conducted. Interestingly, although ANA suppresses BMP action in ectopic bone formation assay, basal levels of bone volume in cancellous bone in ANA-deficient mice were similar to those in wild-type mice (Fig. 10, A and B). Cortical envelope sizes were comparable (data not shown). The levels of newly formed bone after bone marrow ablation were also similar in both genotypes (Fig. 10, C and D). Thus, enhancing effects of ANA deficiency on bone formation were specific to BMP-induced ectopic bone formation and not a general one in any type of bone formation. We have found that ANA deficiency enhanced BMP-induced ectopic bone formation in vivo. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the molecule that specifically suppresses the levels of ectopic bone formation induced by BMP without affecting basal bone mass levels. Our observations point to the fact that ANA is a unique modulator of BMP-induced ectopic bone formation activity. ANA differs in many ways from previously reported molecules. For instance, deletion of Noggin deteriorates embryonic joint development severely and results in embryonic lethality (28Brunet L.J. McMahon J.A. McMahon A.P. Harland R.M. Science.. 1998; 280: 1455-1457Google Scholar). Deficiency of Tob and Caf1 is not lethal but enhances bone volume in the cancellous bone envelope in adult mice (15Usui M. Yoshida Y. Tsuji K. Oikawa K. Miyazono K. Ishikawa I. Yamamoto T. Nifuji A. Noda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2004; 101: 6653-6658Google Scholar, 21Washio-Oikawa K. Nakamura T. Usui M. Yoneda M. Ezura Y. Ishikawa I. Nakashima K. Noda T. Yamamoto T. Noda M. J. Bone Miner. Res... 2007; 22: 1217-1223Google Scholar, 29Usui M. Yoshida Y. Yamashita T. Nifuji A. Ishikawa I. Yamamoto T. Noda M. J. Bone Miner. Res... 2000; 15: S190Google Scholar). In contrast, ANA deficiency specifically suppresses the level of BMP-induced ectopic bone formation, but it does not affect the levels of bone mass systemically, post-injury recovery of bone formation, or morphology of the joints and skeleton. In the light of contemplating strategies to suppress ectopic bone formation, low molecular weight chemicals mimicking ANA action is desirable. Vice versa, to enhance BMP2 actions and thus apply our observations on the function of this molecule for the treatment of bone defects or fracture healing, which involve the osteoblastic differentiation from soft tissue cells surrounding skeleton, ANA is a possible target to modulate specifically the bone formation in such BMP-induced events in the local environment. It would be advantageous if we could develop inhibitors of ANA that can be administered orally or systemically for the patients who need bone formation induced by BMP at fracture sites or at other sites such as spinal fusion or bone defects Recently, the causes for fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva have been reported to be due to active mutations of the ALK, a BMP receptor family member (30Shore E.M. Xu M. Feldman G.J. Fenstermacher D.A. Cho T.J. Choi I.H. Connor J.M. Delai P. Glaser D.L. LeMerrer M. Morhart R. Rogers J.G. Smith R. Triffitt J.T. Urtizberea J.A. Zasloff M. Brown M.A. Kaplan F.S. Nat. Genet... 2006; 38: 525-527Google Scholar). In fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, bone formation occurs everywhere in non-skeletal tissues, including muscle, to lead to the death of the patients due to immobilization of thorax and joints. These observations suggest that BMP activities should be properly suppressed in several ways in many places in such non-skeletal tissues as receptors for BMP could be expressed ubiquitously. BMP plays a role during the whole period of life. It is required for the induction of mesoderm in the early embryos, formation of bone and joint morphogenesis in the later embryonic stages, and the growth of bone during childhood and adolescence, and it also plays a role in many non-skeletal tissues, including skin, gut, and heart (27Canalis E. Economides A.N. Gazzerro E. Endocr. Rev... 2003; 24: 218-235Google Scholar, 31Hogan B.L.M. Genes Dev... 1996; 10: 1580-1594Google Scholar). In fact, BMP receptors are expressed in most of the tissues. Consequently, it is necessary to properly control such BMP activities to establish appropriate balance for the expression of its target genes or proper levels of homeostasis of the activity of these molecules. Identification of ANA, to specifically suppress ectopic bone formation in muscle induced by BMP without affecting the basal levels of steady-state bone metabolism and bone turnover, suggests that ANA plays a pivotal role in this particular pathological condition. It is still to be elucidated whether ANA is related to ectopic or heterotopic bone formation in patients after arthroplasty and brain injury. During fracture heeling, ∼5% of the patients suffer from non-union. Exact mechanisms or molecules responsible for such non-union have not yet been clearly understood. These patients are healthy in terms of the other skeletal or non-skeletal systems. Therefore, particular action of BMP during the healing of the fracture may be impaired at least in some of the fraction of the patients. Recently, BMP2 molecule (but not the other BMPs) has been implicated specifically in fracture healing (5Tsuji K. Bandyopadhyay A. Harfe B.D. Cox K. Kakar S. Gerstenfeld L. Einhorn T. Tabin C.J. Rosen V. Nat. Genet... 2006; 38: 1424-1429Google Scholar). However, it is still to be determined whether BMP actions could be regulated during the repair of bone at the local site specifically by some groups of molecules, which may only act in the local milieu but not in the whole body. To this end, if molecules like ANA are involved in such pathological situation, they could be possible targets for the manipulation of the locally applied BMP activities. It is intriguing that several members of the antiproliferative gene family have been shown to exert their effects as BMP modulators. Because BMPs are known to be involved in malignancy such as colon cancer (32Kodach L.L. Bleurning S.A. Musler A.R. Peppelenbosch M.R. Hommes D.W. van Den Brink G.R. van Noesel C.J.M. Offerhaus G.J.A. Hardwick J.C.H. Cancer.. 2008; 112: 300-306Google Scholar), antiproliferative actions as well as anti-BMP actions may be in concert to suppress the oncogenicity. ANA deficiency has been also shown to correlate with lung adenocarcinoma (34Yoneda M. Suzuki T. Nakamura T. Ajima R. Yoshida Y. Kakuta S. Sudo K. Iwakura Y. Shibutani M. Mitsumori K. Yokota J. Yamamoto T. Cancer Sci... 2008; 100: 225-232Google Scholar). However, so far it has not been known how these two properties of this family member coordinate to play a role in suppression of the oncogenesis. If the reciprocal relationship between proliferation and differentiation could exist in the regulation of the bone development, antiproliferative action of the molecules may lead to the differentiation of the cell. If this is the case, antiproliferative genes may on one hand suppress proliferation to lead to promote differentiation while they may also suppress differentiation to balance the levels of homeostasis for the positive and negative forces for differentiation. Our observations indicated that ANA is expressed in skeletal tissues where BMP molecules as well as their receptors are also expressed. ANA can be regarded as a part of negative feedback loop to balance the action of BMP signaling. Interestingly, not only ANA but also Tob and Caf1 expression is under the control of BMP (14Yoshida Y. Tanaka S. Umemori H. Minowa O. Usui M. Ikematsu N. Hosoda E. Imamura T. Kuno J. Yamashita T. Miyazono K. Noda M. Noda T. Yamamoto T. Cell.. 2000; 103: 1085-1097Google Scholar, 21Washio-Oikawa K. Nakamura T. Usui M. Yoneda M. Ezura Y. Ishikawa I. Nakashima K. Noda T. Yamamoto T. Noda M. J. Bone Miner. Res... 2007; 22: 1217-1223Google Scholar). BMP is also known to stimulate the expression of Noggin and other BMP antagonists (33Gazzerro E. Gangji V. Canalis E. J. Clin. Investig... 1998; 102: 2106-2114Google Scholar). Thus, many BMP inhibitors are under the control of BMP by itself. These observations revealed that the potency of BMP to induce bone formation should be tightly controlled in the normal situation by the action of BMP itself. These inhibitory actions are necessary for the body to survive, because uncontrolled formation of bone in joints and muscle severely deteriorates locomotor function and breathing. The discovery of ANA as one of the molecules involved in this negative feedback system further suggests the presence of ""fine"" tuning of the potency of BMP in the physiology of the body. Tob was reported to interact with Smad1, -5, and -8, and its deficiency enhances basal bone mass in mice. Interestingly, ANA does not interact with Smad1 or -5, but instead it interacts with Smad8. Whether this feature may link to the specific effects of ANA deficiency on the enhancement of ectopic bone formation without affecting basal bone mass levels or not remains to be further elucidated. In conclusion, we identified ANA as a unique and novel BMP antagonist that specifically suppresses ectopic bone formation activity of BMP, a definitive character of this molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1990027286,"Hepatoma-derived growth factor-related proteins (HRP) comprise a family of 6 members, which the biological functions are still largely unclear. Here we show that during embryogenesis HRP-3 is strongly expressed in the developing nervous system. At early stages of development HRP-3 is located in the cytoplasm and neurites of cortical neurons. Upon maturation HRP-3 relocalizes continuously to the nuclei and in the majority of neurons of adult mice it is located exclusively in the nucleus. This redistribution from neurites to nuclei is also found in embryonic cortical neurons maturing in cell culture. We show that HRP-3 is necessary for proper neurite outgrowth in primary cortical neurons. To identify possible mechanisms of how HRP-3 modulate neuritogenesis we isolated HRP-3 interaction partners and demonstrate that it binds tubulin through the N-terminal so called HATH region, which is strongly conserved among members of the HRP family. It promotes tubulin polymerization, stabilizes and bundles microtubules. This activity depends on the extranuclear localization of HRP-3. HRP-3 thus could play an important role during neuronal development by its modulation of the neuronal cytoskeleton."
https://openalex.org/W2029107624,"Gammaherpesviruses have a common biological characteristic, latency and lytic replication. The balance between these two phases in murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV-68) is controlled by the replication and transcription activator (RTA) gene. In this report, we investigated the effect of DNA demethylation and histone acetylation on MHV-68 replication. We showed that distinctive methylation patterns were associated with MHV-68 at the RTA promoter during latency or lytic replication. Treatment of MHV-68 latently-infected S11E cells with a DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) inhibitor 5-azacytidine (5-AzaC), only weakly reactivated MHV-68, despite resulted in demethylation of the viral RTA promoter. In contrast, treatment with a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) strongly reactivated MHV-68 from latency, and this was associated with significant change in histone H3 and H4 acetylation levels at the RTA promoter. We further showed that HDAC3 was recruited to the RTA promoter and inhibited RTA transcription during viral latency. However, TSA treatment caused rapid removal of HDAC3 and also induced passive demethylation at the RTA promoter. In vivo, we found that the RTA promoter was hypomethylated during lytic infection in the lung and that methylation level increased with virus latent infection in the spleen. Collectively, our data showed that histone acetylation, but not DNA demethylation, is sufficient for effective reactivation of MHV-68 from latency in S11E cells."

It is needed to investigate the impact of altruistic behaviors by its contents on the development of MD prospectively. Methodology/Principal Findings The National Survey of Midlife Development in the United States (MIDUS) in 1995–1996 and the MIDUS Psychological Experience Follow-Up study in 1998 were analyzed (weighted N = 563). Financial support of 10 or more dollars per month had a significant impact on the development of MD in comparison to no financial support (OR: 2.64, 95% CI: 1.05–6.62). Unpaid assistance and providing emotional support were not significantly associated with the development of MD in later life. Conclusions/Significances Those who provide financial contribution to individuals other than family members can be at risk of developing MD."

We propose that the balance, as well as the general sensitivity of the endothelium to these factors, varies from individual to individual. Indeed, we have found that individual mouse strains have dramatically different responses to growth factor-induced neovascularization. Quantitative trait loci (QTLs), which influence the extent of corneal angiogenesis induced by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF2), were previously identified by our laboratory. To investigate the genetic contribution to choroidal neovascularization (CNV), a leading cause of blindness, we have undertaken a similar mapping approach to identify QTLs that influence laser-induced CNV in the BXD series of recombinant inbred mouse strains. Composite interval mapping identified new angiogenic QTLs on chromosomes 2 and 19, in addition to confirming our previous corneal neovascularization QTLs of AngVq1 and AngFq2. The new QTLs are named AngCNVq1 and AngCNVq2. The newly mapped regions contain several candidate genes involved in the angiogenic process, including thrombospondin 1, delta-like 4, BclII modifying factor, phospholipase C, beta 2, adrenergic receptor, beta 1, actin-binding LIM protein 1 and colony stimulating factor 2 receptor, alpha. Differences in these regions may control individual susceptibility to CNV."
https://openalex.org/W1993481159,"Background The question of how organisms adapt is among the most fundamental in evolutionary biology. Two recent studies investigated the evolution of Escherichia coli in response to challenge with the antibiotic cefotaxime. Studying five mutations in the β-lactamase gene that together confer significant antibiotic resistance, the authors showed a complex fitness landscape that greatly constrained the identity and order of intermediates leading from the initial wildtype genotype to the final resistant genotype. Out of 18 billion possible orders of single mutations leading from non-resistant to fully-resistant form, they found that only 27 (1.5×10−7%) pathways were characterized by consistently increasing resistance, thus only a tiny fraction of possible paths are accessible by positive selection. I further explore these data in several ways. Principal Findings Allowing neutral changes (those that do not affect resistance) increases the number of accessible pathways considerably, from 27 to 629. Allowing multiple simultaneous mutations also greatly increases the number of accessible pathways. Allowing a single case of double mutation to occur along a pathway increases the number of pathways from 27 to 259, and allowing arbitrarily many pairs of simultaneous changes increases the number of possible pathways by more than 100 fold, to 4800. I introduce the metric ‘repeatability,’ the probability that two random trials will proceed via the exact same pathway. In general, I find that while the total number of accessible pathways is dramatically affected by allowing neutral or double mutations, the overall evolutionary repeatability is generally much less affected. Conclusions These results probe the conceivable pathways available to evolution. Even when many of the assumptions of the analysis of Weinreich et al. (2006) are relaxed, I find that evolution to more highly cefotaxime resistant β-lactamase proteins is still highly repeatable."
https://openalex.org/W2068553144,"IkappaB alpha is an inhibitor of the transcriptional factor NF-kappaB, and it is an essential component of the signaling pathways that lead to expression of inflammatory molecules. These include cytokines and costimulatory molecules associated with antigen presentation in an inflammatory immune response. In this study, we report that antigen-presenting cells exposed to TGF-beta induce peripheral tolerance by increasing IkappaB alpha expression. Exposure of antigen presenting cells (APCs) to TGF-beta is known to impair their ability to secrete IL-12, and such impairment correlated with reduced NF-kappaB activity as indicated by significantly reduced nuclear levels of p50, an essential subunit of NF-kappaB for IL-12 transcription. Blockade of increased nuclear IkappaB alpha in APCs by expression of small interfering RNA molecules (siRNAs) targeting IkappaB alpha transcripts prevented IL-12 impairment and the decline in nuclear p50 levels. Furthermore, such IkappaB alpha blockade also interfered with the tolerogenic property of TGF-beta-exposed APCs. However, increased expression of IkappaB alpha in APCs, independent of TGF-beta exposure, reduced nuclear p50 levels and permitted tolerance induction by APCs. Thus, our findings attribute a direct and significant role to IkappaB alpha in the tolerogenic potential of APCs. Increased IkappaB alpha expression in APCs may therefore offer a therapeutic approach to achieve antigen-specific immunomodulation."
https://openalex.org/W2058539404,"Comparative genomics has revealed the ubiquity of gene and genome duplication and subsequent gene loss. In the case of gene duplication and subsequent loss, gene trees can differ from species trees, thus frequent gene duplication poses a challenge for reconstruction of species relationships. Here I address the case of multi-gene sets of putative orthologs that include some unrecognized paralogs due to ancestral gene duplication, and ask how outgroups should best be chosen to reduce the degree of non-species tree (NST) signal. Consideration of expected internal branch lengths supports several conclusions: (i) when a single outgroup is used, the degree of NST signal arising from gene duplication is either independent of outgroup choice, or is minimized by use of a maximally closely related post-duplication (MCRPD) outgroup; (ii) when two outgroups are used, NST signal is minimized by using one MCRPD outgroup, while the position of the second outgroup is of lesser importance; and (iii) when two outgroups are used, the ability to detect gene trees that are inconsistent with known aspects of the species tree is maximized by use of one MCRPD, and is either independent of the position of the second outgroup, or is maximized for a more distantly related second outgroup. Overall, these results generalize the utility of closely-related outgroups for phylogenetic analysis."
