https://openalex.org/W3133859624,"The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project was established to characterize genetic effects on the transcriptome across human tissues and to link these regulatory mechanisms to trait and disease associations. Here, we present analyses of the version 8 data, examining 15,201 RNA-sequencing samples from 49 tissues of 838 postmortem donors. We comprehensively characterize genetic associations for gene expression and splicing in cis and trans, showing that regulatory associations are found for almost all genes, and describe the underlying molecular mechanisms and their contribution to allelic heterogeneity and pleiotropy of complex traits. Leveraging the large diversity of tissues, we provide insights into the tissue specificity of genetic effects and show that cell type composition is a key factor in understanding gene regulatory mechanisms in human tissues."

https://openalex.org/W3085879587,"Accurate understanding of the global spread of emerging viruses is critical for public health responses and for anticipating and preventing future outbreaks. Here we elucidate when, where, and how the earliest sustained severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission networks became established in Europe and North America. Our results suggest that rapid early interventions successfully prevented early introductions of the virus from taking hold in Germany and the United States. Other, later introductions of the virus from China to both Italy and Washington state, United States, founded the earliest sustained European and North America transmission networks. Our analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of public health measures in preventing onward transmission and show that intensive testing and contact tracing could have prevented SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks from becoming established in these regions."
https://openalex.org/W3084331777,"Many complex human phenotypes exhibit sex-differentiated characteristics. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these differences remain largely unknown. We generated a catalog of sex differences in gene expression and in the genetic regulation of gene expression across 44 human tissue sources surveyed by the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx, v8 release). We demonstrate that sex influences gene expression levels and cellular composition of tissue samples across the human body. A total of 37% of all genes exhibit sex-biased expression in at least one tissue. We identify cis expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) with sex-differentiated effects and characterize their cellular origin. By integrating sex-biased eQTLs with genome-wide association study data, we identify 58 gene-trait associations that are driven by genetic regulation of gene expression in a single sex. These findings provide an extensive characterization of sex differences in the human transcriptome and its genetic regulation."
https://openalex.org/W3086281727,"Low-grade heat (below 373 kelvin) is abundant and ubiquitous but is mostly wasted because present recovery technologies are not cost-effective. The liquid-state thermocell (LTC), an inexpensive and scalable thermoelectric device, may be commercially viable for harvesting low-grade heat energy if its Carnot-relative efficiency (η r ) reaches ~5%, which is a challenging metric to achieve experimentally. We used a thermosensitive crystallization and dissolution process to induce a persistent concentration gradient of redox ions, a highly enhanced Seebeck coefficient (~3.73 millivolts per kelvin), and suppressed thermal conductivity in LTCs. As a result, we achieved a high η r of 11.1% for LTCs near room temperature. Our device demonstration offers promise for cost-effective low-grade heat harvesting."

https://openalex.org/W3086967467,"A series of unfortunate events The history of how severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spread around the planet has been far from clear. Several narratives have been propagated by social media and, in some cases, national policies were forged in response. Now that many thousands of virus sequences are available, two studies analyzed some of the key early events in the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Bedford et al. found that the virus arrived in Washington state in late January or early February. The viral genome from the first case detected had mutations similar to those found in Chinese samples and rapidly spread and dominated subsequent undetected community transmission. The other viruses detected had origins in Europe. Worobey et al. found that early introductions into Germany and the west coast of the United States were extinguished by vigorous public health efforts, but these successes were largely unrecognized. Unfortunately, several major travel events occurred in February, including repatriations from China, with lax public health follow-up. Serial, independent introductions triggered the major outbreaks in the United States and Europe that still hold us in the grip of control measures. Science , this issue p. 571 , p. 564"

https://openalex.org/W3085288603,"Although deforestation rates in the Brazilian Amazon are well known, the extent of the area affected by forest degradation is a notable data gap, with implications for conservation biology, carbon cycle science, and international policy. We generated a long-term spatially quantified assessment of forest degradation for the entire Brazilian Amazon from 1992 to 2014. We measured and mapped the full range of activities that degrade forests and evaluated the relationship with deforestation. From 1992 to 2014, the total area of degraded forest was 337,427 square kilometers (km 2 ), compared with 308,311 km 2 that were deforested. Forest degradation is a separate and increasing form of forest disturbance, and the area affected is now greater than that due to deforestation."

https://openalex.org/W3015170908,"The population-level case-fatality rate (CFR) associated with COVID-19 varies substantially, both across countries at any given time and within countries over time. We analyze the contribution of two key determinants of the variation in the observed CFR: the age-structure of diagnosed infection cases and age-specific case-fatality rates. We use data on diagnosed COVID-19 cases and death counts attributable to COVID-19 by age for China, Germany, Italy, South Korea, Spain, the United States, and New York City. We calculate the CFR for each population at the latest data point and also for Italy, Germany, Spain, and New York City over time. We use demographic decomposition to break the difference between CFRs into unique contributions arising from the age-structure of confirmed cases and the age-specific case-fatality. In late June 2020, CFRs varied from 2.2% in South Korea to 14.0% in Italy. The age-structure of detected cases often explains more than two-thirds of cross-country variation in the CFR. In Italy, the CFR increased from 4.2% to 14.0% between March 9 and June 30, 2020, and more than 90% of the change was due to increasing age-specific case-fatality rates. The importance of the age-structure of confirmed cases likely reflects several factors, including different testing regimes and differences in transmission trajectories; while increasing age-specific case-fatality rates in Italy could indicate other factors, such as the worsening health outcomes of those infected with COVID-19. Our findings lend support to recommendations for data to be disaggregated by age, and potentially other variables, to facilitate a better understanding of population-level differences in CFRs. They also show the need for well-designed seroprevalence studies to ascertain the extent to which differences in testing regimes drive differences in the age-structure of detected cases."

https://openalex.org/W3085774086,"Rare genetic variants are abundant across the human genome, and identifying their function and phenotypic impact is a major challenge. Measuring aberrant gene expression has aided in identifying functional, large-effect rare variants (RVs). Here, we expanded detection of genetically driven transcriptome abnormalities by analyzing gene expression, allele-specific expression, and alternative splicing from multitissue RNA-sequencing data, and demonstrate that each signal informs unique classes of RVs. We developed Watershed, a probabilistic model that integrates multiple genomic and transcriptomic signals to predict variant function, validated these predictions in additional cohorts and through experimental assays, and used them to assess RVs in the UK Biobank, the Million Veterans Program, and the Jackson Heart Study. Our results link thousands of RVs to diverse molecular effects and provide evidence to associate RVs affecting the transcriptome with human traits."

https://openalex.org/W3084553224,"Several plant-derived compounds have demonstrated efficacy in pre-clinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) rodent models. Each of these compounds share a gallic acid (GA) moiety, and initial assays on this isolated molecule indicated that it might be responsible for the therapeutic benefits observed. To test this hypothesis in a more physiologically relevant setting, we investigated the effect of GA in the mutant human amyloid β-protein precursor/presenilin 1 (APP/PS1) transgenic AD mouse model. Beginning at 12 months, we orally administered GA (20 mg/kg) or vehicle once daily for 6 months to APP/PS1 mice that have accelerated Alzheimer-like pathology. At 18 months of age, GA therapy reversed impaired learning and memory as compared with vehicle, and did not alter behavior in nontransgenic littermates. GA-treated APP/PS1 mice had mitigated cerebral amyloidosis, including brain parenchymal and cerebral vascular β-amyloid deposits, and decreased cerebral amyloid β-proteins. Beneficial effects co-occurred with reduced amyloidogenic and elevated nonamyloidogenic APP processing. Furthermore, brain inflammation, gliosis, and oxidative stress were alleviated. We show that GA simultaneously elevates α- and reduces β-secretase activity, inhibits neuroinflammation, and stabilizes brain oxidative stress in a pre-clinical mouse model of AD. We further demonstrate that GA increases abundance of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 10 (ADAM10, Adam10) proprotein convertase furin and activates ADAM10, directly inhibits β-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1, Bace1) activity but does not alter Adam10 or Bace1 transcription. Thus, our data reveal novel post-translational mechanisms for GA. We suggest further examination of GA supplementation in humans will shed light on the exciting therapeutic potential of this molecule.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) irreversibly affects memory and cognition in the elderly, beginning with brain changes decades before dementia. Although AD etiology is largely unknown, it has been suggested that a combination of genetic factors, accumulation of amyloid β-protein (Aβ) and neurofibrillary tangles, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and synaptic/neuronal loss conspires in the onset and progression of the disease (1Selkoe D.J. Alzheimer's disease: genes, proteins, and therapy.Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81 (11274343): 741-76610.1152/physrev.2001.81.2.741Crossref PubMed Scopus (4883) Google Scholar). Designer drugs currently available for AD have only mild symptomatic benefits (i.e. acetylcholinesterase inhibitors or N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonists), and do not modify disease. Furthermore, such drugs typically incur unwanted side effects, and chronic usage can bring about drug resistance. In this regard, “nutraceuticals” (i.e. compounds that are naturally present in the diet) typically have few if any side effects, are well-tolerated, and do not develop resistance. We previously focused on nutraceutical candidates with anti-amyloidogenic properties, including (–)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (2Rezai-Zadeh K. Shytle D. Sun N. Mori T. Hou H. Jeanniton D. Ehrhart J.

Interestingly, these compounds all share a common structure, the gallate moiety, which metabolizes into a smaller molecule when given orally, gallic acid (GA, 3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoic acid).

These intriguing observations raised the question of whether GA might be the common nutraceutical moiety that mediates beneficial effects in the AD context. GA is an aromatic carboxylic acid that belongs to the hydrolysable tannin family (10Serrano J. Puupponen-Pimiä R. Dauer A. Aura A.M. Saura-Calixto F.

In this report, we tested whether 6 months of oral GA therapy impacts AD-relevant phenotypes in the mutant human amyloid β-protein precursor/presenilin 1 (APP/PS1) transgenic AD mouse model. APP/PS1 mice manifest transgene-associated learning and memory impairment as early as 5-7 months of age (21Arendash G.W. King D.L. Gordon M.N. Morgan D. Hatcher J.M. Hope C.E. Diamond D.M. Progressive, age-related behavioral impairments in transgenic mice carrying both mutant amyloid precursor protein and presenilin-1 transgenes.Brain Res. 2001; 891 (11164808): 42-5310.1016/S0006-8993(00)03186-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), and we began by assessing baseline cognitive status prior to dosing (mouse age = 12 months). Compared with nontransgenic WT littermates, this cohort of 12-month–old APP/PS1 mice demonstrated impaired novel object recognition, Y-maze, and radial arm water maze (RAWM) test performance (data not shown). We then randomly assigned behaviorally impaired APP/PS1 mice and unimpaired WT littermate controls to either GA or vehicle treatment groups. Oral treatment (via gavage) was given once daily for 6 months with GA (at 20 mg/kg) or vehicle beginning at 12 months in APP/PS1 mice and in WT littermate controls. Directly administered oral treatment more precisely delivers treatment compared with ad libitum access to drinking water or chow. At the end of therapy (18 months of age), we repeated the behavioral testing battery described above. First, we assessed episodic memory by the novel object recognition test, and all four mouse groups revealed similar recognition indices (49–52%) in the training phase of the test (Fig. 1A). In the retention phase, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by post hoc comparisons disclosed statistically significant differences on recognition index between APP/PS1-V mice and the other three mouse groups (Fig. 1B; **, p < 0.01 for APP/PS1-V versus all other mouse groups). GA-treated APP/PS1 mice had significantly increased novel object exploration frequency by 61% versus APP/PS1-V mice (50%). Notably, GA therapy completely reversed episodic memory impairment, which did not significantly differ from any of the WT mouse groups (Fig. 1B; p > 0.05). Next, we tested exploratory activity and spatial working memory in the alternation Y-maze task. One-way ANOVA followed by post hoc testing revealed significant differences for total arm entries between APP/PS1-V mice and the other three mouse groups (Fig. 1C; ***, p < 0.001).

Han P.L. Optimization of chronic stress paradigms using anxiety- and depression-like behavioral parameters.J. Neurosci. Res. 2006; 83 (16416425): 497-50710.1002/jnr.20754Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Significantly, APP/PS1 transgene-associated hyperactivity, typically operationalized as anxiety-like behavior, was completely stabilized by GA therapy, as GA-treated APP/PS1 mice did not significantly (p > 0.05) differ from WT mouse groups (Fig. 1C). Mice spontaneously alternate arms in the Y-maze, such that they enter the three arms in sequence more often than by chance (50%, see dotted line in Fig. 1D); this behavioral phenotype is often interpreted as a spatial working memory index (21Arendash G.W. King D.L. Gordon M.N. Morgan D. Hatcher J.M. Hope C.E. Diamond D.M. Progressive, age-related behavioral impairments in transgenic mice carrying both mutant amyloid precursor protein and presenilin-1 transgenes.Brain Res. 2001; 891 (11164808): 42-5310.1016/S0006-8993(00)03186-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). As predicted, APP/PS1-V mice showed less tendency to alternate compared with nontransgenic littermates. One-way ANOVA followed by post hoc testing disclosed significant differences on Y-maze spontaneous alternation between APP/PS1-V mice and the other three mouse groups (Fig. 1D; **, p < 0.01). Again, APP/PS1-GA mice did not significantly differ from any of the WT mouse groups. Therefore, 6 months of oral GA therapy completely restored defective spatial working memory in the alternation Y-maze. Last, we tested hippocampus-dependent spatial reference learning and memory in the RAWM. On day 1, overall ANOVA demonstrated main effects of block and genotype (p ≤ 0.001 for errors and escape latency). APP/PS1-V mice tended toward increased numbers of errors and longer escape times to reach the visible or hidden platform locations compared with the other three mouse groups. On day 2, overall ANOVA revealed main effects of block, genotype, and treatment (p < 0.001 for both errors and escape latency). Repeated-measures ANOVA followed by post hoc testing showed statistically significant differences between APP/PS1-V mice and the other three mouse groups (Fig. 1E; **, p < 0.01 for errors and *, p < 0.05 for escape latency). APP/PS1-V mice had more errors and extended escape latencies to touch the visible or hidden platforms compared with the other three mouse groups; yet, APP/PS1-GA mice finished the task with significantly less errors and shorter escape times, and their behavior did not significantly differ from either WT mouse group (p > 0.05). Remarkably, there were no significant between-groups differences (p > 0.05) on swim speed, nor did we observe thigmotaxis (characteristic of extreme anxiety-like behavior) in any of the mice tested. We can therefore reasonably conclude negligible impact of motivation, locomotor impairment, or anxiety to RAWM testing. Importantly, we addressed sex as a biological variable by including it as a categorical covariate in multiple ANOVA models, which did not show significant main effects or interactive terms with sex (p > 0.05). Furthermore, we stratified all analyses by sex and did not find any significant differences (p > 0.05). Collectively, these cognitive/behavioral tests show that 6 months of oral GA therapy completely remediates APP/PS1 transgene-related spatial reference learning and memory impairment. At 18 months of age, APP/PS1-V mice had typical cerebral amyloid (∼7–9% cerebral β-amyloid burden) throughout retrosplenial cortex (RSC), entorhinal cortex (EC), and hippocampus (H) regions of interest (ROI). By contrast, GA therapy significantly reduced cerebral β-amyloid burden across all three brain regions (by 38–44%; Fig. 2, A and B; ***, p < 0.001). To determine whether GA treatment prevented versus reversed cerebral β-amyloid deposition, we enrolled a separate cohort of eight untreated 12-month–old APP/PS1 mice in parallel (Fig. 2B). Strikingly, GA reversed β-amyloid accumulation across all three brain regions (Fig. 2B), and this effect was sex-independent (data not shown). To verify whether reduced cerebral β-amyloid burden was specific to a particular plaque type or was more general, we performed morphometric analysis by blindly assigning β-amyloid plaques to one of three mutually exclusive categories based on maximum diameter: small (<25 μm), medium (between 25 and 50 μm), or large (>50 μm). GA therapy consistently and significantly reduced all three plaque sizes: small (20–44%), medium (32–36%), and large (43–63%) (Fig. 2, C–E; *, p < 0.05; ***, p < 0.001). This effect was also independent of sex (data not shown). Adding to brain parenchymal deposition of β-amyloid as senile plaques, 83% of AD patients manifest cerebral vascular β-amyloid deposits known as cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) (29Ellis R.J. Olichney J.M. Thal L.J. Mirra S.S. Morris J.C. Beekly D. Heyman A. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease: the CERAD experience, part XV.Neurology. 1996; 46 (8649554): 1592-159610.1212/wnl.46.6.1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). In this regard, we blindly counted Aβ antibody (4G8)-stained cerebral vascular β-amyloid deposits in walls of penetrating arteries at the pial surface in RSC and EC regions, and in small arteries at the hippocampal fissure and brachium of the superior colliculus in the hippocampal area. APP/PS1 mice that received GA had significant reductions in mean numbers of CAA deposits in all three brain regions examined (20–29%; Fig. 3, A and B; *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001). We moved on to validate histological results with biochemical analysis of Aβ species in brain homogenates by sandwich ELISA. In the TBS-soluble fraction, GA-treated APP/PS1 mice had significantly decreased Aβ1-40 (38%) and Aβ1-42 (54%) compared with vehicle-treated APP/PS1 mice (Fig. 3C; **, p < 0.01 for Aβ1-40 and ***, p ≤ 0.001 for Aβ1-42). A similar pattern of GA reductions was noted when considering the detergent-soluble fraction for Aβ1-40 (33%) and Aβ1-42 (43%) (Fig. 3D; **, p ≤ 0.01 for Aβ1-40 and ***, p < 0.001 for Aβ1-42). The guanidine-HCl–soluble pellet, which most closely reflects β-amyloid deposits, disclosed GA-dependent reductions in APP/PS1 brain homogenates for Aβ1-40 (35%) and Aβ1-42 (34%) (Fig. 3E; ***, p ≤ 0.001 for Aβ1-40 and **, p < 0.01 for Aβ1-42). Mitigation of cerebral amyloid pathology by long-term GA oral treatment could be owed to 1) shifting equilibrium toward brain-to-blood Aβ efflux (30DeMattos R.B. Bales K.R. Cummins D.J. Paul S.M. Holtzman D.M. Brain to plasma amyloid-β efflux: a measure of brain amyloid burden in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.Science. 2002; 295 (11910111): 2264-226710.1126/science.1067568Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar), 2) decreasing expression of APP or PS1 transgenes, or 3) modulating APP cleavage. To begin addressing these possibilities, we assayed plasma Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-42 species in peripheral blood samples from each APP/PS1 mouse group, but did not detect between-groups differences (data not shown). We then compared transgene-derived APP or PS1 proteins in brain homogenates from GA- and vehicle-treated APP/PS1 mice by Western blotting, and found similar band densities between-groups, showing that long-term GA oral therapy does not alter transgene-derived APP (Fig. 4A) or PS1 (data not shown) proteins. Having ruled out the first two possibilities, we moved on to assess APP metabolites, including nonamyloidogenic soluble APP-α (sAPP-α), amyloidogenic soluble APP-β (sAPP-β), β-C-terminal APP fragment (β-CTF/C99), phospho-β-CTF (P-β-CTF/P-C99), and Aβ species. Although holo-APP protein was comparable between-groups, densitometry disclosed significantly elevated nonamyloidogenic APP processing to sAPP-α in brain homogenates from GA- versus vehicle-treated APP/PS1 mice (Fig. 4, A and B; ***, p < 0.001). By contrast, amyloidogenic APP processing to sAPP-β as well as C99 and P-C99 was significantly reduced in brain homogenates from GA-treated APP/PS1 mice (Fig. 4, A and C, and D; ***, p < 0.001). Additionally, band densities of 4-kDa monomers (Fig. 4A) and species between 25 and 75 kDa (putative Aβ oligomers) were also decreased in brain homogenates from GA-treated APP/PS1 mice compared with vehicle-treated animals (Fig. 4A). We corroborated this by 82E1 sandwich ELISA for Aβ oligomers (Fig. 4E; **, p < 0.01 for APP/PS1-GA versus APP/PS1-V mice). Collectively, our biochemical results suggest that GA therapy exerts dual activities on elevating nonamyloidogenic and reducing amyloidogenic APP processing. We moved on to examine a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 10 (ADAM10, an α-secretase candidate) and β-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1, β-secretase) proteins in brain homogenates from each group of APP/PS1 mice by Western blotting. Both precursor ADAM10 (pADAM10, 90-kDa band) and mature (active) ADAM10 (mADAM10, 68-kDa band) protein expressions were significantly increased in brain homogenates from GA-treated mice (Fig. 5, A–C; ***, p < 0.001 for pADAM10 and mADAM10). ADAM10 is regulated by the proprotein convertase, furin, which activates the enzyme by cleaving the zymogen into the mature form (31Vincent B. Regulation of the α-secretase ADAM10 at transcriptional, translational and post-translational levels.Brain Res.

Therefore, we investigated furin expression in brain homogenates from each group of APP/PS1 mice by Western blotting. Results showed that furin protein abundance was significantly increased in brains from GA- compared with vehicle-treated mice (Fig. 5, A and D; ***, p < 0.001). By contrast, BACE1 protein expression was reduced in brain homogenates from GA- versus vehicle-treated APP/PS1 mice (Fig. 5, A and E; **, p < 0.01, APP/PS1-GA compared with APP/PS1-V mice). To assess if GA altered transcription of Adam10 or Bace1 in the brain, we assayed both mRNA species by quantitative real-time PCR (q-PCR). We did not observe any between-groups differences (Fig. 6, A and B), suggesting that GA functions at the post-transcriptional level.Figure 6GA therapy modulates α- and β-secretase activities in brains from APP/PS1 mice.

Our findings provide detailed molecular insights into how cAMP-PKA signaling inactivates CaMKK2 and reveals a pathway to inhibit CaMKK2 with potential for treating human diseases. The calcium ion (Ca2+) is a dynamic second messenger that relays signals from ligand-activated receptors and voltage-stimulated ion channels at the cell membrane to regulate a wide array of physiological functions (1Clapham D.E.

A key transducer of Ca2+ signaling is calmodulin (CaM), a ubiquitous Ca2+-binding protein that regulates the activity of numerous downstream effectors in response to elevations in intracellular Ca2+ (2Hoeflich K.P. Ikura M. Calmodulin in action: diversity in target recognition and activation mechanisms.Cell. 2002; 108 (11955428): 739-74210.1016/S0092-8674(02)00682-7Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). Important to the actions of the Ca2+-CaM complex is the Ca2+-CaM–dependent protein kinase kinase-2 (CaMKK2), which is the core component of a phosphorylation signaling pathway that regulates appetite and whole-body energy metabolism (3Marcelo K.L.

CaMKK2 regulation involves a complex interplay between allosteric activation by Ca2+-CaM and multisite phosphorylation. It has a modular structure composed of an internal catalytic domain and a regulatory module made up of overlapping autoinhibitory and CaM-binding sequences, flanked by N- and C-terminal sequences of unknown function (7Racioppi L. Means A.R. Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase 2: roles in signaling and pathophysiology.J. Biol.

The autoinhibitory sequence obstructs the catalytic site by an intrasteric mechanism that is relieved by Ca2+-CaM binding, allowing for maximal kinase activity (8Tokumitsu H. Wayman G.A. Muramatsu M.

In human CaMKK2, activation by Ca2+-CaM induces Thr85 autophosphorylation, which creates a molecular memory of the Ca2+ signal that keeps CaMKK2 in the activated state after the stimulus has diminished (9Scott J.W.

Likewise, deletion of the RIIα regulatory subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) in mice (which results in activation of the PKA catalytic subunit) causes a similar phenotype (15London E.

Consistent with this idea, it was reported recently that CaMKK2 is inactivated by cAMP-dependent PKA in cell-free assays (17Psenakova K. Petrvalska O. Kylarova S. Lentini Santo D. Kalabova D. Herman P. Obsilova V. Obsil T. 14-3-3 protein directly interacts with the kinase domain of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase (CaMKK2).Biochim. Biophys. Acta Gen.

Here, we report that CaMKK2 is inactivated in cells by agonists that stimulate cAMP-PKA signaling, including the appetite suppressant liraglutide. PKA inactivates CaMKK2 by a direct mechanism that impairs Ca2+-CaM activation and an indirect mechanism involving recruitment of 14-3-3 adaptor proteins. Our data reveal how cAMP-PKA signaling negatively regulates CaMKK2 and provides a molecular rationale for using PKA-activating drugs for human diseases associated with inappropriate activation of the CaMKK2 pathway. COS7 cells expressing recombinant human CaMKK2 were treated with forskolin and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) to increase intracellular cAMP, after which we immunoprecipitated CaMKK2 and measured kinase activity over a range of CaM concentrations. Forskolin/IBMX treatment increased intracellular cAMP (680-fold over control) and impaired CaMKK2 activation by Ca2+-CaM (Fig. 1, A and B), whereas the concentration of CaM required for half-maximal activation and kinase activity in the absence of Ca2+-CaM were not significantly affected (Table 1). Co-expression with a small-hairpin RNA that decreased expression of the PKA α catalytic subunit (Fig. 1, C and D) or pretreating cells with the PKA inhibitor H89 (Fig. 1E) completely prevented forskolin/IBMX-induced inactivation of CaMKK2.Table 1cAMP-PKA–dependent signaling impairs CaMKK2 activation by Ca2+-CaMTreatmentBasal activity (nmol/min/mg)Maximal activity (nmol/min/mg)A0.5 (nm)Control0.3441.90949.68Forskolin/IBMX0.3181.022****64.52 Open table in a new tab Activation of the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor decreases food intake and promotes weight loss via stimulation of PKA activity (18Hayes M.R.

Therefore, we examined the effect of the GLP-1 receptor agonist liraglutide on CaMKK2 activity in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells that endogenously express the GLP-1 receptor (19Li Y. Perry T. Kindy M.S.

Similar to the effects of forskolin/IBMX, liraglutide diminished Ca2+-CaM activation but had no effect on CaMKK2 activity in the absence of Ca2+-CaM (Fig. 1F). To investigate the mechanism by which cAMP-PKA signaling inactivates CaMKK2, we determined the phosphorylation profile of CaMKK2 in cells under control and PKA-activated conditions. Cells expressing human CaMKK2 were treated with or without forskolin/IBMX, after which CaMKK2 was purified and analyzed by whole-protein TOF MS. Under control conditions, the primary mass peak corresponded to a triply phosphorylated CaMKK2 species (Fig. 2A) as previously reported (14Green M.F. Scott J.W. Steel R. Oakhill J.S. Kemp B.E. Means A.R. Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase β is regulated by multisite phosphorylation.J. Biol.

In contrast, CaMKK2 purified from forskolin/IBMX-treated cells showed a higher range of mass peaks, consistent with increased phosphorylation on at least three additional sites (Fig. 2B). Using tandem MS, we compared the spectra of tryptic peptides from CaMKK2 purified from control and forskolin/IBMX-treated cells and found that Ser100, Ser495 (which resides within the CaM-binding sequence), and Ser511 were phosphorylated in CaMKK2 from the forskolin/IBMX-treated cells but not from the control cells (Fig. S1). All three sites match the PKA phosphorylation consensus motif (Arg/Lys-Arg/Lys-X-Ser/Thr, where X is any amino acid) (21Kemp B.E. Graves D.J. Benjamini E. Krebs E.G. Role of multiple basic residues in determining the substrate specificity of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase.J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252 (194899): 4888-4894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and are conserved across a diverse range of species (Fig. S2). Using validated phospho-specific antibodies (Fig. S3), we confirmed PKA-dependent phosphorylation of all three serine residues by immunoblot (Fig. 2C). The function of each site was determined by treating cells expressing nonphosphorylatable mutants (S100A, S495C, and S511A) with forskolin/IBMX, after which we measured kinase activity in the presence and absence of Ca2+-CaM. We substituted Ser495 for cysteine rather than alanine because the S495A mutation impaired binding of Ca2+-CaM (Fig. S4). The S495C mutant was activated by Ca2+-CaM with similar kinetic parameters to WT CaMKK2 (Fig. S5). WT CaMKK2 and the S100A and S511A mutants from forskolin/IBMX-treated cells displayed decreased Ca2+-CaM activation; however, the S495C mutant was unaffected (Fig. 2D). This indicates that phosphorylation of Ser495 is entirely responsible for suppressing Ca2+-CaM activation in response to PKA signaling. Mirroring the impaired Ca2+-CaM activation, WT CaMKK2 and the S100A and S511A mutants from forskolin/IBMX-treated cells displayed decreased Ca2+-CaM binding, but the S495C mutant did not (Fig. 2E). Analysis of the phosphorylation sites indicated that the sequence surrounding Ser511 conforms to a canonical 14-3-3 protein–binding motif (mode-1 motif RSXpSXP, where X is any amino acid) (22Muslin A.J. Tanner J.W. Allen P.M. Shaw A.S. Interaction of 14-3-3 with signaling proteins is mediated by the recognition of phosphoserine.Cell. 1996; 84 (8601312): 889-89710.1016/S0092-8674(00)81067-3Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1135) Google Scholar). We therefore immunoprecipitated CaMKK2 from cells treated with forskolin/IBMX and tested for copurification of endogenous 14-3-3 proteins by immunoblot. Fig. 3A shows that forskolin/IBMX treatment induced binding of 14-3-3 proteins to CaMKK2 but not in cells pretreated with H89. We detected binding of all seven isoforms of 14-3-3 by tandem MS (Table S1). 14-3-3 binding depends upon phosphorylation of both Ser100 and Ser511 (but not Ser495), because the S100A and S511A mutations were individually sufficient to abolish copurification of 14-3-3 proteins with CaMKK2 (Fig. 3B). A recent study reported that 14-3-3 binding to CaMKK2 impaired dephosphorylation of phospho-Ser495 (pSer495) by protein phosphatase-1 in a cell-free assay (17Psenakova K. Petrvalska O. Kylarova S. Lentini Santo D. Kalabova D. Herman P. Obsilova V. Obsil T. 14-3-3 protein directly interacts with the kinase domain of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase (CaMKK2).Biochim. Biophys. Acta Gen.

To test whether this mechanism occurs in a cellular context, cells expressing WT CaMKK2 or the S100A and S511A mutants were treated with forskolin/IBMX, after which we measured Ser495 phosphorylation and Ca2+-CaM activation at various time points following incubation with H89. Forskolin/IBMX stimulated Ser495 phosphorylation and suppressed Ca2+-CaM activation of WT CaMKK2, which was sustained over the treatment period even after the addition of H89. In contrast, pSer495 was dephosphorylated and maximal activation was restored within 5 min for the S100A and S511A mutants in response to H89 treatment (Fig. 3, C and D). The simplest interpretation of these data is that 14-3-3 binding protects against pSer495 dephosphorylation in cells. 14-3-3 proteins exist functionally as dimers and therefore contain two phosphopeptide-binding pockets that can interact with two sites simultaneously, often on the same target protein (23Yaffe M.B. Rittinger K. Volinia S. Caron P.R. Aitken A. Leffers H. Gamblin S.J. Smerdon S.J. Cantley L.C. The structural basis for 14-3-3:phosphopeptide binding specificity.Cell. 1997; 91 (9428519): 961-97110.1016/S0092-8674(00)80487-0Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar). For 14-3-3 target proteins containing two phosphorylation sites, there is generally a primary high-affinity site that initiates 14-3-3 recruitment by binding to one monomer in the 14-3-3 dimer, which then permits binding of the weaker secondary site to the adjoining monomer to stabilize the overall interaction (24Yaffe M.B. How do 14-3-3 proteins work? - Gatekeeper phosphorylation and the molecular anvil hypothesis.FEBS Lett. 2002; 513 (11911880): 53-5710.1016/S0014-5793(01)03288-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). To simulate the interaction between CaMKK2 and 14-3-3, we used surface plasmon resonance to measure 14-3-3 binding to a series of synthetic phosphopeptides corresponding to the unphosphorylated (Ser100-Ser511), monophosphorylated (pSer100-Ser511 and Ser100-pSer511), and diphosphorylated (pSer100-pSer511) species of CaMKK2 (Fig. S6). As expected, we did not observe any 14-3-3 binding to the unphosphorylated Ser100-Ser511 peptide (Fig. 4A). The pSer100-Ser511 peptide (Fig. 4B) showed modest binding to 14-3-3 (KD 1.91 µm) relative to the Ser100-pSer511 peptide, which displayed a 5-fold increase in binding affinity (KD 0.35 µm) consistent with pSer511 conforming to the canonical 14-3-3 binding motif (Fig. 4C). Phosphorylation of both sites further strengthened binding to 14-3-3 (KD 0.09 µm), displaying a 4-fold increase in affinity over the pSer511 site alone (Fig. 4D). To further investigate the interaction between CaMKK2 and 14-3-3, we determined the crystal structure of 14-3-3ζ in complex with the diphosphorylated pSer100-pSer511 peptide to a resolution of 2.44 Å (Table S2). The unit cell contained four molecules of 14-3-3, arranged in a back-to-back dimer of dimers, with a 180° rotation with respect to the other dimer. Each dimer contained two phosphopeptide-binding sites, both of which showed strong electron density for the critical pSer100 and pSer511 residues (Fig. 5A). We did not observe an admixture of the pSer100-pSer511 peptide bound in both possible orientations to the 14-3-3 dimer; therefore, we were able to unambiguously place pSer100 and pSer511 into the phosphopeptide-binding sites of discrete monomers within the dimeric complex. Coordination of the phosphoserines was conserved in both binding sites (mediated by Lys-4914-3-3, Arg-5614-3-3, Arg-12714-3-3, and Tyr-12814-3-3); however, the pSer511 end of the peptide bound in site 1 makes considerably more interactions through its main chain and side chain atoms compared with the pSer100 end in site 2 (Fig. 5, B and C). The side chain of Ser509 forms hydrogen bonds with side chains of Tyr-22814-3-3 and Glu-18014-3-3, and the side chain of Arg508 makes parallel planar stacking interactions with Arg-6014-3-3. Additionally, the main chain amine from Ser509 and Leu510 form hydrogen bonds with Glu-18014-3-3 and Asn-22414-3-3, respectively. In contrast, only residues Leu99 and Leu101 on the pSer100 end make hydrogen bonds with 14-3-3 via main chain interactions with the side chains of Asn-22414-3-3 and Asn-17314-3-3, respectively. Herein, we report that stimulation of cAMP-PKA signaling in cells inactivates CaMKK2 by a mechanism involving tripartite phosphorylation of conserved serine residues and recruitment of 14-3-3 adaptor proteins. We found that phosphorylation of Ser495, a highly conserved site located within the CaM-binding sequence, directly impairs Ca2+-CaM binding and activation of CaMKK2. A similar mechanism of inhibitory cross-talk by the cAMP-PKA pathway, involving direct phosphorylation of CaM-binding sites, has been reported for other Ca2+-CaM–regulated proteins including CaMKK1, β-adducin, and the Ca2+-dependent K+ channel KCa3.1 (25Wayman G.A.

This provides a multi-level system for fine-tuning Ca2+ signaling by allowing the magnitude and duration of signal transmission to be modulated (28Hofer A.M. Interactions between calcium and cAMP signaling.Curr. Med. Chem. 2012; 19 (22963560): 5768-577310.2174/092986712804143286Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). As well as impairing Ca2+-CaM activation via Ser495 phosphorylation, PKA-dependent phosphorylation of Ser100 and Ser511 mediates binding of 14-3-3 proteins, which keep CaMKK2 in the inactivated state by protecting against pSer495 dephosphorylation by cellular protein phosphatases. The absolute requirement for phosphorylation on both sites for 14-3-3 binding and phosphatase protection is consistent with the “gatekeeper” model of 14-3-3 engagement with target proteins (24Yaffe M.B. How do 14-3-3 proteins work? - Gatekeeper phosphorylation and the molecular anvil hypothesis.FEBS Lett. 2002; 513 (11911880): 53-5710.1016/S0014-5793(01)03288-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). In this model, 14-3-3 target proteins that contain two phospho-binding sites generally have a primary high-affinity site that functions as the gatekeeper and a secondary lower affinity site that is not only required to stabilize the overall interaction but is also essential for the biological effect of 14-3-3 binding. Our data indicate that pSer511 is the gatekeeper site on CaMKK2 because of its greater 14-3-3 binding affinity compared with the pSer100 site, which is in accordance with the pSer511 site matching the canonical 14-3-3 consensus binding motif (23Yaffe M.B.

Our crystal structure of 14-3-3 complexed with a diphosphorylated peptide that simulates simultaneous binding of the pSer100 and pSer511 sites revealed that each site occupies the phosphopeptide-binding groove of discrete 14-3-3 monomers within the dimeric complex. Strong electron density was observed for the residues directly adjacent to the phosphoserine residues (five residues surrounding pSer100 and seven residues surrounding pSer511), whereas no electron density was visible for the flexible glycine linker region of the peptide. We also observed distinct binding of the diphosphorylated peptide to specific 14-3-3 monomers within the dimer, such that the gatekeeper pSer511 was always bound to 14-3-3 monomers B and D, whereas pSer100 was always bound to monomers A and C. This peculiarity is common to all tandem phosphopeptides/14-3-3 complex structures solved to date (29Kostelecky B. Saurin A.T. Purkiss A. Parker P.J. McDonald N.Q.

Although the structures of all four monomers are highly alike (RMSD < 0.35 Å for monomers A, B, C, and D), there are perhaps subtle structural changes that allow the crystal to pack with the 14-3-3 dimer in the same orientation with respect to the phosphorylated peptide (pSer511 versus pSer100). The 14-3-3 dimer has been described as a molecular anvil because it maintains its overall structure upon ligand binding while distorting the ligand to fit the phosphopeptide-binding groove (24Yaffe M.B. How do 14-3-3 proteins work? - Gatekeeper phosphorylation and the molecular anvil hypothesis.FEBS Lett. 2002; 513 (11911880): 53-5710.1016/S0014-5793(01)03288-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Consequently, the 14-3-3 interaction forces a new conformation on the target protein to regulate activity, localization, post-translation modifications, or protein-protein interactions. In the case of CaMKK2, 14-3-3 protein binding does not directly alter kinase activity because forskolin/IBMX treatment failed to impair Ca2+-CaM activation of the S495C mutant, despite the fact that 14-3-3 binding was unaffected. Rather, the effect of 14-3-3 binding is purely steric hindrance to protect pSer495 from d"

However, studies on cyanobacteria and microalgae are few compared with those on bacteria and viruses. Research is especially lacking on the presence and taxonomic composition of cyanobacteria and microalgae near economically important water bodies with much tourism, such as the Adriatic Sea region. Here, we present the first characterization of the airborne cyanobacteria and microalgae in this area. Sampling conducted between 11th and 15th June 2017 revealed a total of 15 taxa of airborne cyanobacteria and microalgae. Inhalation of many of the detected taxa, including Synechocystis sp., Synechococcus sp., Bracteacoccus sp., Chlorella sp., Chlorococcum sp., Stichococcus sp., and Amphora sp., poses potential threats to human health. Aside from two green algae, all identified organisms were capable of producing harmful metabolites, including toxins. Moreover, we documented the presence of the cyanobacterium Snowella sp. and the green alga Tetrastrum sp., taxa that had not been previously documented in the atmosphere by other researchers. Our study shows that the Adriatic Sea region seems to be a productive location for future research on airborne cyanobacteria and microalgae in the context of their impacts on human health, especially during the peak of tourism activity."
https://openalex.org/W3086381040,"As the Watson–Crick faces of nucleobases are protected in dsDNA, it is commonly assumed that deleterious alkylation damage to the Watson–Crick faces of nucleobases predominantly occurs when DNA becomes single-stranded during replication and transcription. However, damage to the Watson–Crick faces of nucleobases has been reported in dsDNA in vitro through mechanisms that are not understood. In addition, the extent of protection from methylation damage conferred by dsDNA relative to ssDNA has not been quantified. Watson–Crick base pairs in dsDNA exist in dynamic equilibrium with Hoogsteen base pairs that expose the Watson–Crick faces of purine nucleobases to solvent. Whether this can influence the damage susceptibility of dsDNA remains unknown. Using dot-blot and primer extension assays, we measured the susceptibility of adenine-N1 to methylation by dimethyl sulfate (DMS) when in an A-T Watson–Crick versus Hoogsteen conformation. Relative to unpaired adenines in a bulge, Watson–Crick A-T base pairs in dsDNA only conferred ∼130-fold protection against adenine-N1 methylation, and this protection was reduced to ∼40-fold for A(syn)-T Hoogsteen base pairs embedded in a DNA-drug complex. Our results indicate that Watson–Crick faces of nucleobases are accessible to alkylating agents in canonical dsDNA and that Hoogsteen base pairs increase this accessibility. Given the higher abundance of dsDNA relative to ssDNA, these results suggest that dsDNA could be a substantial source of cytotoxic damage. The work establishes DMS probing as a method for characterizing A(syn)-T Hoogsteen base pairs in vitro and also lays the foundation for a sequencing approach to map A(syn)-T Hoogsteen and unpaired adenines genome-wide in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W3085850424,"Successful DNA replication requires carefully regulated mechanisms to overcome numerous obstacles that naturally occur throughout chromosomal DNA. Scattered across the genome are tightly bound proteins, such as transcription factors and nucleosomes, that are necessary for cell function, but that also have the potential to impede timely DNA replication. Using biochemically reconstituted systems, we show that two transcription factors, yeast Reb1 and Tbf1, and a tightly positioned nucleosome, are strong blocks to the strand displacement DNA synthesis activity of DNA polymerase δ. Although the block imparted by Tbf1 can be overcome by the DNA-binding activity of the single-stranded DNA-binding protein RPA, efficient DNA replication through either a Reb1 or a nucleosome block occurs only in the presence of the 5'-3' DNA helicase Pif1. The Pif1-dependent stimulation of DNA synthesis across strong protein barriers may be beneficial during break-induced replication where barriers are expected to pose a problem to efficient DNA bubble migration. However, in the context of lagging strand DNA synthesis, the efficient disruption of a nucleosome barrier by Pif1 could lead to the futile re-replication of newly synthetized DNA. In the presence of FEN1 endonuclease, the major driver of nick translation during lagging strand replication, Pif1-dependent stimulation of DNA synthesis through a nucleosome or Reb1 barrier is prevented. By cleaving the short 5' tails generated during strand displacement, FEN1 eliminates the entry point for Pif1. We propose that this activity would protect the cell from potential DNA re-replication caused by unwarranted Pif1 interference during lagging strand replication."
https://openalex.org/W3084738380,"The ubiquitin–proteasome system is the canonical pathway for protein degradation in eukaryotic cells. GFP is frequently used as a reporter in proteasomal degradation assays. However, there are multiple variants of GFP in use, and these variants have different intrinsic stabilities. Further, there are multiple means by which substrates are targeted to the proteasome, and these differences could also affect the proteasome's ability to unfold and degrade substrates. Herein we investigate how the fate of GFP variants of differing intrinsic stabilities is determined by the mode of targeting to the proteasome. We compared two targeting systems: linear Ub4 degrons and the UBL domain from yeast Rad23, both of which are commonly used in degradation experiments. Surprisingly, the UBL degron allows for degradation of the most stable sGFP-containing substrates, whereas the Ub4 degron does not. Destabilizing the GFP by circular permutation allows degradation with either targeting signal, indicating that domain stability and mode of targeting combine to determine substrate fate. Difficult-to-unfold substrates are released and re-engaged multiple times, with removal of the degradation initiation region providing an alternative clipping pathway that precludes unfolding and degradation; the UBL degron favors degradation of even difficult-to-unfold substrates, whereas the Ub4 degron favors clipping. Finally, we show that the ubiquitin receptor Rpn13 is primarily responsible for the enhanced ability of the proteasome to degrade stable UBL-tagged substrates.

Our results indicate that the choice of targeting method and reporter protein are critical to the design of protein degradation experiments. The ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS) is responsible for the bulk of protein degradation in eukaryotic cells. Proteins to be degraded are typically polyubiquitinated on one or more lysines by the action of E1, E2, and E3 enzymes. The polyubiquitin chain is recognized by one of three ubiquitin receptors on the 19S subunit of the proteasome, Rpn1, Rpn10, or Rpn13, or by ubiquitin shuttle proteins that bind to both polyubiquitin and one of the ubiquitin receptors. The substrate is then engaged by the ATP-dependent Rpt motor proteins at an unstructured initiation region and translocated into the 20S core particle's central degradation chamber. The polyubiquitin chain passes by the deubiquitinase Rpn11 during translocation, which removes the chain, allowing ubiquitin to be recycled for additional rounds of protein targeting. Although recent advances have led to the understanding of many of the details of substrate recognition and unfolding, it remains unclear why three ubiquitin receptors (and multiple adaptors) are necessary or what controls whether a protein targeted to the proteasome by ubiquitination is successfully unfolded or escapes degradation. GFP and its derivatives are some of the most commonly used reporters used to study the UPS both in vitro and in vivo (1Trauth J. Scheffer J. Hasenjäger S. Taxis C. Strategies to investigate protein turnover with fluorescent protein reporters in eukaryotic organisms.AIMS Biophys. 2020; 7: 90-11810.3934/biophy.2020008Crossref Google Scholar).

However, there are challenges to using GFP as a model substrate. GFP forms an exceptionally stable 11-stranded β-barrel. Extraction of a single β-strand from the barrel by ATP-dependent proteases leads to a still stable 10-stranded intermediate, and the original β-barrel can fully reform if pulling is not rapid enough (20Nager A.R. Baker T.A. Sauer R.T. Stepwise unfolding of a β barrel protein by the AAA+ ClpXP protease.J. Mol. Biol. 2011; 413 (21821046): 4-1610.1016/j.jmb.2011.07.041Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Indeed, GFP-containing fragments as an end point of degradation have been observed both in cells and in vitro (16Reichard E.L. Chirico G.G. Dewey W.J. Nassif N.D. Bard K.E. Millas N.E. Kraut D.A. Substrate ubiquitination controls the unfolding ability of the proteasome.J. Biol.

On the other hand, circular permutants of GFP that unfold in a single step have been shown to be degraded by the bacterial ATP-dependent protease ClpXP without stalling (20Nager A.R. Baker T.A. Sauer R.T. Stepwise unfolding of a β barrel protein by the AAA+ ClpXP protease.J. Mol. Biol. 2011; 413 (21821046): 4-1610.1016/j.jmb.2011.07.041Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The proteasome has been suggested to be even more processive than ClpXP (21Koodathingal P. Jaffe N.E. Kraut D.A. Prakash S. Fishbain S. Herman C. Matouschek A. ATP-dependent proteases differ substantially in their ability to unfold globular proteins.J. Biol.

Anderson R.T. Smith D.M. The proteasomal ATPases use a slow but highly processive strategy to unfold proteins.Front. Mol. Biosci. 2017; 4 (28421184): 1810.3389/fmolb.2017.00018Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). However, in some cases GFP unfolding and degradation in cells requires the unfoldase cdc48/p97 in addition to the proteasome's own unfoldase activity (22Dai R.M. Li C.C.

Thus, a better understanding of GFP unfolding by the proteasome will inform the interpretation of a diversity of experiments. We recently showed that substrate ubiquitination can increase the proteasome's unfolding ability and that proteasomal ubiquitin receptors mediate this increase, with Rpn13 playing the largest role (16Reichard E.L. Chirico G.G. Dewey W.J. Nassif N.D. Bard K.E. Millas N.E. Kraut D.A. Substrate ubiquitination controls the unfolding ability of the proteasome.J. Biol.

Herein we set out to determine whether the degradation of GFP is affected by the mode of targeting to the proteasome, and, if so, which ubiquitin receptors are responsible. We used two previously established targeting systems, the linear Ub4 modification, with four nonhydrolyzable ubiquitins connected by short linkers, and the ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain from yeast Rad23, both attached to the N terminus. In both cases, addition of an unstructured initiation region at the C terminus of a target protein has been shown to lead to efficient degradation by the proteasome (26Inobe T. Fishbain S. Prakash S. Matouschek A. Defining the geometry of the two-component proteasome degron.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2011; 7 (21278740): 161-16710.1038/nchembio.521Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Rpn1 has been suggested to be the primary receptor for Rad23 (27Shi Y. Chen X. Elsasser S. Stocks B.B. Tian G. Lee B.-H. Shi Y. Zhang N. de Poot S.A. Tuebing F. Sun S. Vannoy J. Tarasov S.G. Engen J.R. Finley D. et al.Rpn1 provides adjacent receptor sites for substrate binding and deubiquitination by the proteasome.Science. 2016; 351 (26912900): aad942110.1126/science.aad9421Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), although Rpn10 and Rpn13 are thought to be the primary receptors for ubiquitinated substrates (28Grice G.L. Nathan J.A. The recognition of ubiquitinated proteins by the proteasome.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2016; 73 (27137187): 3497-350610.1007/s00018-016-2255-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Quite recently, the Matouschek laboratory used a circular permutant of GFP to show that indeed Rpn10 and to a lesser extent Rpn13 were the only receptors used by Ub4, whereas Rpn1 and Rpn13 were the receptors of choice for the UBL domain (18Martinez-Fonts K. Davis C. Tomita T. Elsasser S. Nager A.R. Shi Y. Finley D. Matouschek A. The proteasome 19S cap and its ubiquitin receptors provide a versatile recognition platform for substrates.Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 (31980598): 47710.1038/s41467-019-13906-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, because a relatively easy-to-unfold substrate was used, it remained unclear to what extent the proteasome's unfolding ability is affected by the targeting mode or receptor choice. By using substrates containing GFP variants of different stabilities with WT and receptor-mutant proteasomes and using gel-based assays that can detect partial degradation, we show here that UBL-targeted substrates are degraded more efficiently than Ub4-targeted substrates and that this difference seems to be correlated with reliance on the Rpn13 receptor. We first examined the ability of the proteasome to degrade a substrate consisting of superfolder GFP (sGFP) with a linear Ub4 tag on the N terminus and a C-terminal unstructured tail of 44 amino acids (including a terminal hexa-histidine tag), Ub4-sGFP-38-His6. The substrate was incubated with purified yeast proteasome, and the reaction mixture was run on an SDS-PAGE gel and visualized and quantified using the inherent fluorescence of GFP. When GFP is unfolded or degraded, it loses fluorescence. There was essentially no degradation of sGFP as determined by quantifying the total fluorescence (Fig. 1A, green). However, there was substantial “clipping” of the tail (Fig. 1A, red and blue) as has been seen previously with other GFP-containing substrates (16Reichard E.L. Chirico G.G. Dewey W.J. Nassif N.D. Bard K.E. Millas N.E. Kraut D.A. Substrate ubiquitination controls the unfolding ability of the proteasome.J. Biol.

Clipping could occur because the unstructured tail is too short to initiate processive unfolding or because after the proteasome initiates degradation, it is unable to unfold sGFP, stalls, and eventually releases the substrate. Longer initiation regions improve degradation of some proteasomal substrates (18Martinez-Fonts K. Davis C. Tomita T. Elsasser S. Nager A.R. Shi Y. Finley D. Matouschek A. The proteasome 19S cap and its ubiquitin receptors provide a versatile recognition platform for substrates.Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 (31980598): 47710.1038/s41467-019-13906-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 26Inobe T. Fishbain S. Prakash S. Matouschek A. Defining the geometry of the two-component proteasome degron.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2011; 7 (21278740): 161-16710.1038/nchembio.521Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), but we found replacing the tail with an 108-amino acid-long tail (Ub4-sGFP-102-His6) only modestly increased the rate and extent of complete degradation, and clipping remained the predominant outcome of degradation (Fig. 1, B, E, and F). On the other hand, replacement of sGFP with a circular permutant of GFP (in which the 8th β-strand is the C terminus instead of the 11th), cp8sGFP, led to rapid degradation of the substrate with very little clipping (Fig. 1C), consistent with the hypothesis that the proteasome stalls while trying to unfold the highly stable sGFP. Additional experiments support the possibility that the linear Ub4 tag is capable of targeting proteins to the proteasome, but the ability to successfully unfold and degrade the substrates depends on their stabilities. First, we confirmed that the Ub4-sGFP substrate did bind to the proteasome, because it was able to inhibit the degradation of a conventionally ubiquitinated substrate (Fig. S1). As expected, clipping of the sGFP substrate and degradation of the cp8sGFP substrate were both greatly slowed by proteasome inhibitors (Fig. S2, A and B). However, the addition of free polyubiquitin chains slowed degradation of cp8sGFP but not clipping of sGFP, suggesting that clipping does not depend on ubiquitin (Fig. S2, C and D). We observed that clipping of sGFP could be mediated by either the 20S or 26S proteasome, because both free 20S core particle or doubly capped 26S proteasome (reconstituted by the addition of excess purified 19S particle to purified 20S core particle) clipped the sGFP substrate similarly. In contrast, the cp8sGFP substrate was clipped by 20S proteasome but degraded once any 19S particle was added (Fig. S3). Replacing sGFP with the less stable enhanced GFP (eGFP) led to intermediate levels of clipping and degradation (Fig. 1, D and F). In sum, although the linear Ub4 tag targets proteins to the proteasome, their unfolding and degradation depends on their stabilities. If substrates are too stable to be unfolded rapidly, they are instead clipped in a ubiquitin-independent manner, shortening and presumably inactivating the unstructured initiation site and thereby preventing retargeting. Next, we replaced the Ub4 targeting sequence on sGFP with the UBL domain from yeast Rad23 (UBL-sGFP-102-His6). The proteasome was able to robustly degrade this substrate (as had been previously described (15Yu H. Kago G. Yellman C.M. Matouschek A. Ubiquitin-like domains can target to the proteasome but proteolysis requires a disordered region.EMBO J. 2016; 35 (27234297): 1522-153610.15252/embj.201593147Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar)) with little clipping observed (Fig. 2, A and E). Degradation proceeded through a transient long fragment (blue curve), such that the rate of disappearance of full-length protein was much faster than the rate of disappearance of fluorescence (Fig. 2D). A shorter persistent fragment (purple curve) was also produced that presumably has an unstructured tail too short to serve as an initiation site. This fragment was likely produced directly from the full-length substrate, analogous to clipping of the Ub4-containing substrates via a proteasome-dependent but UBL-independent pathway (see Fig. 4 below). As with the Ub4-containing substrates, replacing sGFP with the less stable cp8sGFP (Fig. 2B) reduced the difference between full-length and fluorescence degradation rates (Fig. 2D) and reduced the extent of clipping (Fig. 2E) such that the cp8sGFP substrate was degraded without the detection of any intermediates or formation of clipped fragment. (We note that this substrate also ran as a thicker band on a gel, potentially obscuring detection of intermediates.) Only small differences were seen between eGFP and sGFP (Fig. 2C). In all cases, the extent of complete degradation of a given GFP protein was larger with a UBL tag then with a Ub4 tag, indicating that the UBL domain is better able to promote the unfolding and degradation of the substrate by the proteasome.Figure 4Partially degraded protein can be rebound and degraded. A, model for degradation of UBL-sGFP-102-His6 substrate. The substrate can be clipped, forming a short fragment, in a UBL-independent (but proteasome-dependent) process, or can be bound via the UBL and engaged, and then the tail is partly degraded to produce the longer fragment, which can either be unfolded and completely degraded or can alternatively be released and rebound repeatedly until it is degraded. Rate constants were derived from fitting the model to the data from C and D below (Fig. S4). For binding and release steps, the Km of 85 nm for UBL-sGFP-102-His6 (15Yu H. Kago G. Yellman C.M. Matouschek A. Ubiquitin-like domains can target to the proteasome but proteolysis requires a disordered region.EMBO J. 2016; 35 (27234297): 1522-153610.15252/embj.201593147Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) was used as the KD, and kbind was set to 51 μm−1 min−1 as determined for Ub4 from single-molecule data (30Lu Y.

Anderson R.T. Smith D.M. The proteasomal ATPases use a slow but highly processive strategy to unfold proteins.Front. Mol. Biosci. 2017; 4 (28421184): 1810.3389/fmolb.2017.00018Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The authors concluded from this result that unlike bacterial ATP-dependent proteases, the proteasome is highly processive and does not release GFP sufficiently for refolding to occur. That is, even at low ATPase rates, krefold ≪ kunfold2 (Fig. 3A). However, as we have shown, this circularly permuted substrate is much easier for the proteasome to unfold than eGFP or sGFP and might indeed unfold catastrophically. We therefore set out to determine the effect of reducing ATP hydrolysis rates on unfolding and degradation of our substrates using ATPγS. In contrast to previous results (which were conducted using mammalian proteasome, not yeast proteasome), we found that replacing even a small fraction of ATP with ATPγS led to a precipitous drop in degradation rates for Ub4-cp8sGFP-38-His6 (Fig. 3, B–D). At higher ATPγS concentrations, there was also a substantial increase in the extent of clipping (Fig. 3E). This result was surprising, because we had not anticipated the formation of a stable unfolding intermediate with the cp8sGFP substrate. However, this analysis assumes that replacing ATP with ATPγS will linearly decrease the ATPase rate, which to our knowledge had not been tested. Using a coupled lactate dehydrogenase/pyruvate kinase ATPase assay, we found that even a small fraction of ATPγS is able to dramatically decrease the ATPase activity of the proteasome, consistent with a cooperative ATPase mechanism (Fig. 3F). Similar results were seen using a malachite green assay (data not shown), indicating that the results were not due to ATPγS inhibition of pyruvate kinase. Thus, there is indeed a linear dependence of degradation rate on ATPase rate for the cp8sGFP substrate (Fig. 3G), consistent with a highly processive degradation mechanism for cp8sGFP, although important differences in terms of sensitivity to ATPγS are noted relative to mammalian proteasome. The increase in clipping seen at higher ATPγS concentrations indicates that slowing degradation sufficiently can cause the nonproductive Ub-independent clipping pathway to become competitive with degradation even for this less stable substrate. We next examined the degradation of the more stable sGFP-containing substrate, UBL-sGFP-102-His6. Replacing 25% of the ATP with ATPγS, which reduced the ATPase rate ∼8-fold, reduced the initial rate of fluorescence loss by ∼10-fold, approximately twice the effect seen with the cp8-sGFP substrate (an ∼5-fold effect) (Fig. 3H versus Fig. 2A). Interestingly, the initial disappearance of full-length protein was only reduced by 1.6-fold, suggesting that formation of the longer clipped intermediate (kunfold1) is less sensitive to ATP concentration than unfolding of the rest of GFP (kunfold2). The extent of clipping was also doubled from ∼10% to ∼20%. Overall, these results indicate that although there is some ability for this more stable GFP to refold upon initial unfolding, even at low ATPase rates, processive degradation is the predominate pathway taken. Thus, at least when targeted via the UBL domain, the proteasome does indeed processively degrade even a highly stable protein with little stalling. For comparison, ClpXP requires only an ∼10% drop in ATPase rates for an ∼90% decrease in degradation rates of sGFP (20Nager A.R. Baker T.A. Sauer R.T. Stepwise unfolding of a β barrel protein by the AAA+ ClpXP protease.J. Mol. Biol. 2011; 413 (21821046): 4-1610.1016/j.jmb.2011.07.041Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The larger GFP-containing fragment that appears and then decreases in intensity during degradation of UBL-targeted substrates (Fig. 2A) could represent transiently stalled protein bound to the proteasome before it has been degraded.

ADAMTSL2 is a matricellular protein previously shown to interact with latent transforming growth factor-β binding protein 1 and influence assembly of fibrillin 1 microfibrils. ADAMTSL2 contains seven thrombospondin type-1 repeats (TSRs), six of which contain the consensus sequence for O-fucosylation by protein O-fucosyltransferase 2 (POFUT2). O-fucose–modified TSRs are subsequently elongated to a glucose β1-3-fucose (GlcFuc) disaccharide by β1,3-glucosyltransferase (B3GLCT). B3GLCT mutations cause Peters Plus Syndrome (PTRPLS), which is characterized by skeletal defects similar to GPHYSD1. Several ADAMTSL2 TSRs also have consensus sequences for C-mannosylation. Six reported GPHYSD1 mutations occur within the TSRs and two lie near O-fucosylation sites. To investigate the effects of TSR glycosylation on ADAMTSL2 function, we used MS to identify glycan modifications at predicted consensus sequences on mouse ADAMTSL2. We found that most TSRs were modified with the GlcFuc disaccharide at high stoichiometry at O-fucosylation sites and variable mannose stoichiometry at C-mannosylation sites. Loss of ADAMTSL2 secretion in POFUT2−/− but not in B3GLCT−/− cells suggested that impaired ADAMTSL2 secretion is not responsible for skeletal defects in PTRPLS patients. In contrast, secretion was significantly reduced for ADAMTSL2 carrying GPHYSD1 mutations (S641L in TSR3 and G817R in TSR6), and S641L eliminated O-fucosylation of TSR3. These results provide evidence that abnormalities in GPHYSD1 patients with this mutation are caused by loss of O-fucosylation on TSR3 and impaired ADAMTSL2 secretion.

ADAMTSL2 is a member of the ADisintegrin-like And Metalloprotease with Thrombospondin type I repeats (ADAMTS) superfamily. The mammalian ADAMTS family contains 19 secreted metalloproteases and seven matricellular ADAMTS-Like (ADAMTSL) members (1Apte S.S.

ADAMTS proteins consistently have one or more thrombospondin type-1 repeats (TSRs), a cysteine-rich domain, a spacer region, and a variety of C-terminal modules in addition to the protease domain, whereas ADAMTSL proteins lack the protease domain. Although the functions of ADAMTSL proteins are less well understood, recent findings from genetic disorders suggested that some of them may operate within the context of fibrillin microfibrils or synaptic function (2Hubmacher D.

Each of the seven TSRs in mouse ADAMTSL2 contains at least one consensus sequence for glycosylation (Fig. 1).

ADAMTSL2 contains 10 N-glycosylation sites, one of which falls within TSR6 and overlaps with a predicted protein O-fucosyltransferase 2 (POFUT2) consensus sequence (Fig. 1). TSRs are modified with an O-fucose on a serine (Ser) or threonine (Thr) within the consensus sequence C-X-X-(S/T)-C by POFUT2 (12Luo Y. Koles K. Vorndam W. Haltiwanger R.S. Panin V.M.

The O-fucose is typically elongated with a glucose (Glc) by β1,3-glucosyltransferase (B3GLCT), forming a glucose β1,3-fucose (GlcFuc) disaccharide on TSRs (10Haltiwanger R.S. Wells L. Freeze H.H.

In fact, blocking secretion of ADAMTS9, which is required for early development in mice, appears to be the reason for the embryonic lethality in Pofut2-null mice (28Benz B.A. Nandadasa S. Takeuchi M.

Interestingly, siRNA knockdown or CRISPR-Cas9 knockout of B3GLCT in HEK293T cells reduces secretion of some but not all POFUT2 targets, suggesting PTRPLS and phenotypes in B3glct-null mice may result from reduced secretion of a subset of POFUT2 targets. ADAMTSL2 secretion was reduced when either POFUT2 or B3GLCT were knocked down using siRNA (20Vasudevan D. Takeuchi H. Johar S.S. Majerus E. Haltiwanger R.S.

Several GPHYSD1 mutations reduce secretion of ADAMTSL2, including a GPHYSD1 mutation adjacent to the O-fucosylation site in TSR6 (G811R) (6Le Goff C. Morice-Picard F. Dagoneau N. Wang L.W. Perrot C.

Another GPHYSD1 mutation, S635L, falls within the POFUT2 consensus sequence in TSR3 from ADAMTSL2 (8Allali S. Le Goff C. Pressac-Diebold I. Pfennig G. Mahaut C. Dagoneau N. Alanay Y. Brady A.F.

These results raised the possibility that altered O-fucosylation is responsible for reduced secretion of ADAMTSL2 in GHPYSD1 S635L and G811R patients. To address the relationship between GPHYSD1 mutations and glycosylation of ADAMTSL2, we used MS to analyze glycosylation on WT mouse ADAMTSL2, which shares 88% sequence identity with human ADAMTSL2 including complete conservation of consensus sequences for TSRs glycosylation. TSR3 and TSR6, in which these mutations occur, share sequence identity of 95 and 96%, respectively (Fig. S1). Mouse knockouts of Adamtsl2 phenocopy many of the defects observed in GPHYSD1 patients (4Delhon L. Mahaut C. Goudin N. Gaudas E. Piquand K. Le Goff W. Cormier-Daire V. Le Goff C.

In addition, we also examined the impact of GPHYSD1 mutations on glycosylation and secretion of ADAMTSL2 using cell-based secretion assays. We show that loss of O-fucosylation, such as in POFUT2−/− cells, eliminated secretion of mouse ADAMTLS2, whereas lack of extension to the GlcFuc disaccharide in B3GLCT−/− cells had no effect on secretion. We also demonstrated that GPHYSD1 analogous mutations in TSR3 (S641L) and TSR6 (G817R) reduced secretion of mouse ADAMTSL2. Significantly, we showed that the reduction in secretion of the S641L mutation results from reduced O-fucosylation of TSR3, providing a molecular explanation for GPHYSD1 in patients with this mutation. The seven ADAMTSL2 TSRs contain six consensus sites for O-fucosylation, eight consensus sites for C-mannosylation, and one consensus site for N-glycosylation (Fig. 1). To determine the glycoforms present on ADAMTSL2 TSRs and the stoichiometry of glycan modifications, we subjected purified mouse ADAMTSL2 (mADAMTSL2) to tryptic and chymotryptic digestions and analyzed digested fragments via nano-LC–MS/MS to identify glycopeptides containing the POFUT2 consensus sites as described under “Experimental procedures.” To determine the relative amounts of O-fucose (O-Fuc) monosaccharide, disaccharide, and unmodified peptide (naked), we generated extracted ion chromatograms (EICs) for each glycoform of the selected peptides and calculated peak areas for each (30Leonhard-Melief C. Haltiwanger R.S. O-Fucosylation of thrombospondin type 1 repeats.Methods Enzymol. 2010; 480 (20816219): 401-41610.1016/S0076-6879(10)80018-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). At predicted O-fucosylation sites, the elongated GlcFuc disaccharide was the major glycoform on TSR1, TSR3 and TSR7 (Fig. 2A, Fig. S2, A, B, D, H, and I). TSR5 was mainly unmodified with only a small percentage of GlcFuc disaccharide, suggesting that an innate characteristic of this TSR reduces recognition by POFUT2 (Fig. 2A, Fig. S2F). Surprisingly, TSR2 was predominantly modified with O-Fuc monosaccharide, suggesting this TSR is poorly modified by B3GLCT (Fig. 2A, Fig. S2C). Using MS, we were unable to detect peptides containing the TSR6 POFUT2 consensus site, even with multiple different protease and glycosidase digestions. TSR6 is unusual in that the POFUT2 consensus site overlaps with an N-glycosylation consensus site and therefore could be modified with either or both modifications (Fig. 1). As an alternative approach to determine whether TSR6 was O-fucosylated, we tested whether ADAMTSL2 TSR6 (TSL2-TSR6) expressed in HEK293T cells incorporated the bio-orthogonal probe 6-alkynylfucose (6AF). Previously we have shown that 6AF is efficiently transferred onto O-fucose sites in TSRs by POFUT2 and can be modified with azide-biotin using “click” chemistry, allowing for detection with streptavidin (31Al-Shareffi E. Chaubard J.L. Leonhard-Melief C. Wang S.K. Wong C.H. Haltiwanger R.S. 6-alkynyl fucose is a bioorthogonal analog for O-fucosylation of epidermal growth factor-like repeats and thrombospondin type-1 repeats by protein O-fucosyltransferases 1 and 2.Glycobiology. 2013; 23 (23045360): 188-19810.1093/glycob/cws140Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). 6AF was efficiently incorporated onto TSP1-TSR3, which is known to be O-fucosylated (31Al-Shareffi E. Chaubard J.L. Leonhard-Melief C. Wang S.K. Wong C.H. Haltiwanger R.S. 6-alkynyl fucose is a bioorthogonal analog for O-fucosylation of epidermal growth factor-like repeats and thrombospondin type-1 repeats by protein O-fucosyltransferases 1 and 2.Glycobiology. 2013; 23 (23045360): 188-19810.1093/glycob/cws140Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) but was not incorporated onto TSL2-TSR6 (Fig. 2B), demonstrating that TSR6 from ADAMTSL2 is not O-fucosylated. To determine whether TLS2-TSR6 was N-glycosylated, we tested for presence of N-glycans by treatment with PNGase F (Fig. 2B). TSL2-TSR6 size-shifted significantly following PNGase F treatment, suggesting that it is N-glycosylated. The complete shift of TSL2-TSR6 after PNGase F treatment suggested the N-glycosylation in TSR6 was stoichiometric. In contrast, TSR3 from human thrombospondin-1 (TSP1-TSR3), which lacks an N-glycosylation site, did not shift (Fig. 2B). In contrast to POFUT2 consensus sites, C-mannosylation sites were modified at lower stoichiometries (Fig. 2C). For ADAMTSL2 TSR1, the most abundant C-mannosylation species were detected on the second and third tryptophans in the W-X-X-W-X-X-W-X-X-C motif, with very little modification of the first W (Fig. S2B). In contrast, TSRs 3-7 each have a single W-X-X-C C-mannosylation consensus motif (Fig. 1). Among these TSRs, significant levels of C-mannosylation were only detected on TSR3 and TSR7, with no modification detected on TSRs 4, 5, or 6 (Fig. S2, D–G and I). The glycan modifications are summarized in Fig. 2D. Previous work demonstrated that siRNA knockdown of POFUT2 in HEK293T cells significantly reduced ADAMTSL2 secretion (20Vasudevan D. Takeuchi H. Johar S.S. Majerus E. Haltiwanger R.S. Peters Plus Syndrome mutations disrupt a noncanonical ER quality-control mechanism.Curr.

To confirm the importance of TSR O-fucosylation for ADAMTSL2 secretion, we examined ADAMTSL2 secretion in Lec13 CHO cells grown in the presence or absence of fucose (Fig. 3A). Lec13 CHO cells have a mutation in GDP-mannose 4,6-dehydratase (32Ripka J. Adamany A. Stanley P. Two Chinese hamster ovary glycosylation mutants affected in the conversion of GDP-mannose to GDP-fucose.Arch. Biochem.

The mutation can be rescued through the GDP-fucose salvage pathway by addition of fucose to the medium (20Vasudevan D. Takeuchi H. Johar S.S. Majerus E. Haltiwanger R.S. Peters Plus Syndrome mutations disrupt a noncanonical ER quality-control mechanism.Curr.

In the absence of fucose, ADAMTSL2 was trapped in the cell lysate and was not secreted to the medium from Lec13 CHO cells, but secretion was restored when medium was supplemented with fucose (Fig. 3A), suggesting that loss of either TSR O-fucosylation or fucosylation of N-glycans impaired ADAMTSL2 secretion. To distinguish between these possibilities, we compared secretion of ADAMTSL2 in WT (Pro5) and mutant (Lec1) CHO cells (Fig. 3B). Lec1 cells have a mutation in Mgat1 that blocks processing of N-glycans to hybrid or complex types that could contain fucose (33Stanley P. Caillibot V. Siminovitch L. Selection and characterization of eight phenotypically distinct lines of lectin-resistant Chinese hamster ovary cell.Cell. 1975; 6 (1182798): 121-12810.1016/0092-8674(75)90002-1Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). ADAMTSL2 was secreted from both Pro5 and Lec1 cells (Fig. 3B). Moreover, ADAMTSL2 secreted from the Lec1 cells migrated faster than that from the Pro5 cells, consistent with the lack of N-glycan processing. The efficient secretion of ADAMTSL2 lacking fucosylation on N-glycans suggested that loss of O-fucosylation on ADAMTSL2 TSR motifs was responsible for reduced secretion of ADAMTSL2 secretion from Lec13 CHO cell"

Octapeptin C4 and FADDI-115 both penetrated into the OM hydrophobic center but experienced different conformational transitions from an unfolded to a folded state that was highly dependent on the structural flexibility of their respective N-terminal fatty acyl groups. The additional hydroxyl group present in the fatty acyl group of octapeptin C4 resulted in the molecule becoming trapped in a semifolded state, leading to a higher free energy barrier for OM penetration. The free energy barrier for the translocation through the OM hydrophobic layer was ∼72 kcal/mol for octapeptin C4 and 62 kcal/mol for FADDI-115. Our results help to explain the lower antimicrobial activity previously observed for octapeptin C4 compared with FADDI-115 and more broadly improve our understanding of the structure–function relationships of octapeptins.

Of particular concern are the Gram-negative ‘superbugs,‘ including Acinetobacter baumannii, that show resistance to almost all currently available antibiotics (2MacLean R.C. San Millan A.

Given that the development of new antibiotics has stagnated in recent years, polymyxins (i.e. polymyxin B and colistin) are increasingly used as a last-line therapy against these multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens (3Velkov T. Thompson P.E. Nation R.L. Li J. Structure–activity relationships of polymyxin antibiotics.J. Med.

Novel antibiotic treatments that can target polymyxin resistance are therefore urgently required. The octapeptins are lipopeptide antibiotics discovered over 40 years ago as natural products in the soil bacterium Bacillus circulans (9Velkov T. Roberts K. Li J. Rediscovering the octapeptins.Nat. Prod. Rep. 2017; 34 (28180225): 295-30910.1039/c6np00113kCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although structurally similar to the polymyxins (Table S1), there are major differences in the antibacterial activity between the two classes of lipopeptides. Whereas the polymyxins are only active against Gram-negative bacteria (3Velkov T. Thompson P.E. Nation R.L. Li J. Structure–activity relationships of polymyxin antibiotics.J. Med.

Roberts K. Li J. Rediscovering the octapeptins.Nat. Prod. Rep. 2017; 34 (28180225): 295-30910.1039/c6np00113kCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, the octapeptins do not exhibit cross-resistance with polymyxins and retain activity against polymyxin-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (10Velkov T. Gallardo-Godoy A. Swarbrick J.D. Blaskovich M.A.T. Elliott A.G. Han M. Thompson P.E. Roberts K.D. Huang J.X. Becker B. Butler M.S. Lash L.H. Henriques S.T. Nation R.L.

The development of resistance to the octapeptins in Gram-negative organisms also appears to be more difficult than occurs with the polymyxins (11Meyers E. Pansy F.E. Basch H.I. Mcripley R.J. Slusarchyk D.S. Graham S.F. Trejo W.H. EM49, a new peptide antibiotic: iii. biological characterization in vitro in vivo.J.

These unique features make the octapeptins promising candidates for the development of novel lipopeptide antibiotics (12Fayad A.A. Herrmann J. Müller R.

Given the structural similarities to the polymyxins, the octapeptins are believed to have a similar mode of action that involves insertion into the OM of Gram-negative bacteria followed by membrane disorganization, lysis, and eventual cell death (3Velkov T. Thompson P.E. Nation R.L. Li J. Structure–activity relationships of polymyxin antibiotics.J. Med.

Resistance to the polymyxins generally develops through modification of the lipid A component of lipopolysaccharide in the OM with cationic moieties such as ethanolamine and 4′-aminoarabinose (14Jeannot K. Bolard A. Plésiat P. Resistance to polymyxins in Gram-negative organisms.Int. J. Antimicrob.

Interestingly, lipid A–based NMR models revealed that the octapeptins can specifically bind to the ethanolamine- or 4′-aminoarabinose–modified lipid A molecule through strong hydrophobic contacts (10Velkov T.

Minor structural modifications to the octapeptin core scaffold not involving the α-γ-diaminobutyric acid (Dab) residues have also been shown to dramatically hinder their bactericidal activity (9Velkov T.

These findings suggest that the activity of the octapeptins depends upon their unique interaction pattern with the OM rather than simply acting as a cationic detergent. However, the interaction between the octapeptins and the bacterial OM has never been investigated at the atomic level, significantly limiting our understanding of their mechanism of activity and hindering the discovery of novel octapeptins. In the present study, an asymmetric lipid A–phosphoethanolamine (lipid A–pEtN; Fig. S1)–modified OM model was constructed based on our quantitative lipidomics results of polymyxin-resistant A. baumannii (Fig. 1B) (19Zhu Y. Lu J. Han M. Jiang X. Azad M.A.K. Patil N.A. Lin Y. Zhao J. Hu Y. Yu H.H. Chen K. Boyce J.D. Dunstan R.A. Lithgow T.

Sci. 2020; 7 (32775156): 200070410.1002/advs.202000704Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). For the first time, we employed all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and umbrella sampling technique to investigate the conformation and energetics governing the penetration of two octapeptins (octapeptin C4 and FADDI-115) into the lipid A–pEtN modified OM. Despite their close structural similarity, significant changes in their free energy profiles and conformational transitions during OM penetration were observed, revealing new insight into the structure–interaction relationship of octapeptins. The motion trajectories of the octapeptin molecules in the steered simulations were tracked relative to the center of the OM (Fig. 2A). After ∼5 ns, both the octapeptin C4 and FADDI-115 molecules approached the surface of the outer leaflet of the OM, traversing the polar headgroup region after ∼12 ns. After a short plateau phase (∼2 ns for octapeptin C4 and 4 ns for FADDI-115), the octapeptin molecule completely penetrated into the hydrophobic region of the OM after roughly 36 ns. We investigated the interactions between the octapeptin molecules and the OM at different stages of penetration. At the surface-binding stage, the positively charged side chains of d-Dab1 and Dab6 of octapeptin C4 closely interacted with the negatively charged phosphate groups of adjacent lipid A–pEtN molecules (Fig. 2B, panel i). Similarly, the side chains of d-Dab1 and Dab3 in FADDI-115 bound to the phosphate groups of lipid A–pEtN molecules (Fig. 2C, panel i). These results indicate that the initial binding of the octapeptins to the bacterial OM was mainly driven by the long-range electrostatic interactions. Subsequently, both octapeptin C4 and FADDI-115 inserted their fatty acyl groups into the hydrocarbon region of the OM, although their cyclic heptapeptide segments formed multiple hydrogen bonds with the headgroups of lipid A–pEtN molecules (Fig. 2, B and C, panels ii). After this, both octapeptins formed a folded conformation within the hydrophobic center of the OM. For octapeptin C4, its N-terminal fatty acyl group and the d-Phe4 oriented toward the OM center and formed hydrophobic contacts with the hydrocarbon chains of lipid A–pEtN and phospholipid molecules, whereas the polar heptapeptide ring made intensive interactions with the phosphate groups of lipid A–pEtN molecules (Fig. 2B, panel iii). The interaction was somewhat different for FADDI-115; the fatty acyl chain and Leu8 were embedded in the hydrocarbon region of the OM, whereas the cyclic head interacted with the phosphate groups of lipid A–pEtN molecules (Fig. 2C, panel iii). During the OM penetration process, the positively charged Dab residues of both octapeptins formed strong interactions with the headgroups of lipid A–pEtN molecules, which triggered ∼150° rotation of the headgroups of the adjacent lipid A–pEtN molecules (Fig. 2D) and the local structural disorganization of the OM (Fig. S2). Before the penetration of the octapeptins, water molecules could only reach the polar headgroup region of the OM and were largely excluded from the hydrophobic region. However, following the penetration of the octapeptin molecule into the center of the OM, a large number of water molecules entered into the hydrophobic layer of the OM through the penetration site of the octapeptin molecules; the number of water molecules within the membrane–water interface increased from ∼350 to 650 in the octapeptin C4 system (Fig. 3A) and to 550 in the FADDI-115 system (Fig. 3B). This increase in the water permeability of the bacterial OM promoted by the octapeptins may lead to further destabilization of the bacterial OM and help explain the antimicrobial activity of the octapeptins. Free energy profiles are useful to evaluate the membrane-penetrating ability of antimicrobials and closely relates to their efficacy (20Yesylevskyy S. Marrink S.J. Mark A.E.

Through a series of umbrella sampling simulations, we characterized the free energy profiles for the octapeptins moving from the bulk water to the hydrophobic center of the OM (Fig. 4).

The ΔGbind describes the binding of the octapeptin to the surface of the OM outer leaflet (2.5 nm < Z < 3.0 nm), whereas the ΔGtranslocate-1 and ΔGtranslocate-2 values describe the translocations of the octapeptin molecule through the headgroup region (1.8 nm < Z < 2.5 nm) and the hydrocarbon region (0 nm < Z < 1.8 nm) of the OM outer leaflet, respectively. The ΔGbind was approximately −3.5 kcal/mol (favorable) for both octapeptin C4 and FADDI-115. The ΔGtranslocate-1 was comparatively unfavorable (∼8 kcal/mol) because the octapeptin C4 and FADDI-115 passed through the headgroup region of the OM. Curiously, the free energy profile diverged when traversing the hydrocarbon region of the OM for each octapeptin, especially in the range Z < 1.2 nm. To pass through this hydrophobic region, the ΔGtranslocate-2 was ∼72 kcal/mol for octapeptin C4 and 62 kcal/mol for FADDI-115 (energy-unfavorable). Interestingly, the free energy profiles of octapeptin C4 and FADDI-115 significantly diverged when they penetrated through the inner leaflet of the OM. The free energy curve reached the plateau at Z = −1 nm in the system with FADDI-115, and the free energy for FADDI-115 was ∼50 kcal/mol lower than that for octapeptin C4 at Z = −3 nm (Fig. S3). Because the only structural difference between these two octapeptins is an additional hydroxyl group on the fatty acyl chain of octapeptin C4 (Fig. 1A), these results show that this structural variation did not affect their binding affinity with the bacterial OM and penetrating ability through the polar headgroup region but significantly changed their ability to traverse the hydrophobic region of the OM. As shown in Fig. 2 (B and C, panels iii), both octapeptin C4 and FADDI-115 formed a folded conformation in the hydrophobic center of the OM, consistent with the previous NMR findings (10Velkov T. Gallardo-Godoy A. Swarbrick J.D. Blaskovich M.A.T. Elliott A.G. Han M. Thompson P.E. Roberts K.D. Huang J.X. Becker B. Butler M.S. Lash L.H. Henriques S.T. Nation R.L. Sivanesan S. et al.Structure, function, and biosynthetic origin of octapeptin antibiotics active against extensively drug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria.Cell Chem.

To examine the mechanism of the conformational transition, we characterized the conformational ensembles of the octapeptin C4 and FADDI-115 molecules by measuring their radius of gyration (Rg) around the z axis during the penetration process. The octapeptin C4 molecule displayed three major conformational clusters during the entire penetration process (Fig. 5A). It adopted an unfolded state (Rg > 0.6 nm) in the polar headgroup region of the OM (Z > 1.8 nm), transformed into an intermediate, semifolded state (Rg = ∼0.54 nm) in the headgroup–hydrocarbon interface region of the OM (1.0 nm < Z < 1.5 nm), and finally stayed in a more compact, folded state (Rg = ∼0.45 nm) near the OM hydrophobic center (Z < 0.5 nm). Similarly, the FADDI-115 molecule also maintained an unfolded state in the polar headgroup region of the OM and formed a folded state near the OM center (Fig. 5B). However, the transition between these two states was achieved through an intermediate aisle (0.5 nm < Z < 1 nm), rather than the intermediate conformational cluster observed in the octapeptin C4 system. Interestingly, structural superimposition showed that the cyclic heptapeptide component of the octapeptin C4 and FADDI-115 molecules was well-aligned among their unfolded, intermediate, and folded states. The variation in the radius of gyration observed was due to conformational swing of their respective fatty acyl groups (Fig. 5, C and D). This may suggest that the hydroxyl group on the fatty acyl group of octapeptin C4 is a key factor for their observed different conformational transitions in the OM. The all-atom simulation results were utilized to examine the interactions between the OM and the octapeptin molecule in its folded state. A single octapeptin C4 molecule was observed to bind to three lipid A–pEtN molecules, and the complex was stabilized by a combination of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions (Fig. 6A). The positively charged side chains of Dab7 interacted with the negatively charged phosphate group of the lipid A–pEtN molecule; the side chain of d-Dab1 made a hydrogen bond with the sugar of the lipid A–pEtN molecule; the main chain of the residues on the cyclic segment contributed five hydrogen bonds with the lipid A–pEtN molecules, and the N-terminal fatty acyl group and d-Phe4 formed hydrophobic contacts with the hydrocarbon chains of the adjacent lipid A–pEtN molecules. Notably, the side chains of Dab3 and Dab6 made few interactions with the lipid A–pEtN molecules, likely because of the shielding from the hydrophobic d-Phe4, Leu5 and Leu8. Similarly, the FADDI-115 molecule bound to three lipid A–pEtN molecules (Fig. 6B). The side chains of d-Dab1, Dab3, and Dab7 interacted with the phosphate groups of the lipid A–pEtN molecules; the main chains of Dab3 and Dab6 made three hydrogen bonds with the lipid A–pEtN molecules; and the N-terminal fatty acyl group and Leu8 formed hydrophobic contacts with the hydrocarbon tails of the adjacent lipid A–pEtN molecules. Additionally, we examined the interactions associated with the hydroxyl group on the fatty acyl group of octapeptin C4 (Fig. 6C). The hydroxyl group formed up to two hydrogen bonds with the OM lipids during the entire penetration process and likely contributed two hydrogen bonds when the octapeptin C4 molecule reached the headgroup–hydrocarbon interface region of the OM (1.0 nm < Z < 1.5 nm). These intermolecular hydrogen bonds with octapeptin C4 appear to change the conformational dynamics of the fatty acyl group, which stabilized a large intermediate, semifolded conformational cluster at this interface region (Fig. 5A). The octapeptins are structurally similar to the polymyxins, with both possessing an N-terminal fatty acyl group and three cationic Dab residues located at the same positions in a heptapeptide ring. However, despite these similarities, the octapeptins retain activity against many polymyxin-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (9Velkov T. Roberts K. Li J. Rediscovering the octapeptins.Nat. Prod.

As a class of membrane-targeting antibiotics, the interaction between the octapeptins and the bacterial OM has not been investigated at the atomic level to date. In this study, all-atom MD simulations were employed to investigate how the octapeptins interact with the lipid A–pEtN modified OM that renders many Gram-negative bacteria polymyxin-resistant.

Analysis of the simulations revealed that a minor structural variation between octapeptin C4 and FADDI-115, namely, the presence of a hydroxyl group on the fatty acyl group of octapeptin C4 (Fig. 1A), was sufficient to impact their conformational transitions and resulted in different free energy profiles for OM penetration. These results provided novel atomic-scale insights into the structure–activity relationship of the octapeptins against polymyxin-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. Free energy profiles quantitatively evaluated the energetics governing the penetration of the octapeptin molecules into the bacterial OM (Fig. 4). The free energy barrier for the translocation through the hydrophobic layer of the OM (ΔGtranslocate-2 = ∼72 and 62 kcal/mol for octapeptin C4 and FADDI-115, respectively; Fig. 4) was much lower than that of colistin A (∼82 kcal/mol) (27Jiang X. Yang K. Han M. Yuan B. Li J. Gong B. Velkov T. Schreiber F. Wang L. Li J. Outer membranes of polymyxin-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii with phosphoethanolamine-modified lipid a and lipopolysaccharide loss display different atomic-scale interactions with polymyxins.ACS Infect. Dis. 2020; 10.1021/acsinfecdis.0c00330Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The high free energy barrier in this region suggests that the hydrophobic layer of the OM constitutes the major defense to the action of both octapeptins and polymyxins. Lacking the hydroxyl group found on the fatty acyl tail of octapeptin C4 (Fig. 1A), FADDI-115 is slightly more hydrophobic than octapeptin C4. The lower free energy required for FADDI-115 to penetrate the membrane indicates that the additional hydroxyl group of octapeptin C4 negatively impacted OM penetration.

https://openalex.org/W3085876289,"Maedi-visna (MV) is a complex lentiviral disease syndrome characterised by long immunological and clinical latencies and chronic progressive inflammatory pathology. Incurable at the individual level, it is widespread in most sheep-keeping countries, and is a cause of lost production and poor animal welfare. Culling seropositive animals is the main means of control, but it might be possible to manage virus transmission effectively if its epidemiology was better quantified. We derive a mathematical epidemiological model of the temporal distributions of seroconversion probabilities and estimate susceptibility, transmission rate and latencies in three serological datasets. We demonstrate the existence of epidemiological latency, which has not explicitly been recognised in the SRLV literaure. This time delay between infection and infectiousness apparently exceeds the delay between infection and seroconversion. Poor body condition was associated with more rapid seroconversion, but not with a higher probability of infection. We estimate transmission rates amongst housed sheep to be at about 1,000 times faster than when sheep were at grass, when transmission was negligible. Maternal transmission has only a small role in transmission, because lambs from infected ewes have a low probability of being infected directly by them, and only a small proportion of lambs need be retained to maintain flock size. Our results show that MV is overwhelmingly a disease of housing, where sheep are kept in close proximity. Prevalence of MV is likely to double each year from an initial low incidence in housed flocks penned in typically-sized groups of sheep (c. 50) for even a few days per year. Ewes kept entirely at grass are unlikely to experience transmission frequently enough for MV to persist, and pre-existing infection should die out as older ewes are replaced, thereby essentially curing the flock."
https://openalex.org/W3086204944,"The liquid foodstuffs such as edible oil products remain a problem of excessive aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) content. This paper focused on the preparation of magnetic mesoporous silica (MMS) from rice husk ash for the removal of AFB1 in oil system. The MMS preparation process, adsorption conditions, structural characteristics, and adsorption mechanism were investigated. The optimum conditions for MMS preparation were pH 11.0 and 80°C for 24 h. The characterization results showed that magnetic particles were successfully embedded in the MMS and had high responsiveness to a magnetic field, which was advantageous for recyclability. The MMS had ordered uniform channels with a specific surface area of 730.98 m2/g and pore diameter of 2.43 nm. The optimum adsorption conditions were 2 h at 20°C. For AFB1 with an initial concentration of 0.2 μg/mL, the MMS adsorption capacity was 171.98 μg/g and the adsorption rate was 94.59%. The MMS adsorption isotherm fitted the Langmuir model well under the assumption of monolayer AFB1 adsorption with uniformly distributed adsorption sites on the MMS surface. The maximum amount of AFB1 adsorbed according to the Langmuir isotherm was 1118.69 μg/g. A quasi-second-order kinetic model gave a better fit to the process of AFB1 adsorption on MMS. The values of ΔH (-19.17 kJ/mol) and ΔG (-34.09, -34.61, and -35.15 kJ/mol at 283, 293, and 303 K, respectively) were negative, indicating that AFB1 adsorption on MMS was a spontaneous exothermic process. The results indicated that MMS was a promising material for AFB1 removal in oil system, and this study will serve as a guide for practical MMS applications."

Families play an important role in their care of children with complex needs, yet their knowledge, experience and skills are rarely harnessed in existing interventions to best support these families.This study explores the use of mothers as facilitators for a community-based group intervention for children with CZS and their caregivers in Brazil.Four facilitators were trained to deliver the 10-week intervention called ""Juntos"". Two were mothers of a child with CZS (""expert mothers"") and two were therapists (speech therapist and physiotherapist). The intervention was delivered to three groups, generally including 8-10 caregivers. Two researchers, who were psychologists, observed the groups and held focus group discussions at the end of each session. They undertook semi-structured interviews post intervention with a purposive sample of caregivers, and with the facilitators. Observation notes were collated and summarised. Transcripts were transcribed and thematically analysed using five elements to assess feasibility: acceptability, demand, implementation, practicality and adaptation.The use of expert mothers as facilitators was considered to be acceptable and there was demand for their role. Their experiential knowledge was viewed as important for sharing and learning, and supporting and encouraging the group. The intervention was delivered with fidelity by the expert mothers. The practicality of the intervention was facilitated by holding the group sessions in the community, providing transport costs to facilitators and participants, paying expert mothers and therapist facilitators equally and supporting the expert mothers through a mentorship programme. Equal payment with the therapist enabled the expert mothers to better facilitate the groups, through increased confidence in the value of their role. Adaptation of the intervention included development of video resources and mentoring guidelines.The use of expert mothers as facilitators of caregiver groups provides a unique approach to harness the knowledge, experience, and skills of families to provide care, and is likely to be feasible in similar contexts."

However, little is known about the mechanisms underpinning ascorbic acid-mediated cholesterol metabolism. Here, we determined if ascorbic acid can regulate expression of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 (PCSK9), which binds low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) leading to its intracellular degradation, to influence low-density lipoprotein (LDL) metabolism. At cellular levels, ascorbic acid inhibited PCSK9 expression in HepG2 and Huh7 cell lines. Consequently, LDLR expression and cellular LDL uptake were enhanced. Similar effects of ascorbic acid on PCSK9 and LDLR expression were observed in mouse primary hepatocytes. Mechanistically, ascorbic acid suppressed PCSK9 expression in a forkhead box O3-dependent manner. In addition, ascorbic acid increased LDLR transcription by regulating sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2. In vivo, administration of ascorbic acid reduced serum PCSK9 levels and enhanced liver LDLR expression in C57BL/6J mice. Reciprocally, lack of ascorbic acid supplementation in L-gulono-γ-lactone oxidase deficient (Gulo−/−) mice increased circulating PCSK9 and LDL levels, and decreased liver LDLR expression, whereas ascorbic acid supplementation decreased PCSK9 and increased LDLR expression, ameliorating LDL levels in Gulo−/− mice fed a high fat diet. Moreover, ascorbic acid levels were negatively correlated to PCSK9, total and LDL levels in human serum samples.

The increased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-cholesterol or LDL) levels in plasma is a pivotal risk factor for the initiation of cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of death in all countries (1Hunt K.J.

LDL receptor (LDLR) plays a critical role in anti-atherosclerosis by regulating LDL catabolism. The majority of excess LDL can be cleared by hepatic LDLR (2Kong W.J. Liu J. Jiang J.D. Human low-density lipoprotein receptor gene and its regulation.J. Mol. Med. (Berl.)). 2006; 84 (16292665): 29-3610.1007/s00109-005-0717-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). LDLR binds LDL to mediate LDL endocytosis and degradation in lysosomes, and then recycles itself to the cell surface (3Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. The LDL receptor.Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2009; 29 (19299327): 431-43810.1161/ATVBAHA.108.179564Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). Therefore, mutations of LDLR, either heterozygous or homozygous, result in familial hypercholesterolemia (2Kong W.J. Liu J. Jiang J.D. Human low-density lipoprotein receptor gene and its regulation.J. Mol. Med. (Berl.)). 2006; 84 (16292665): 29-3610.1007/s00109-005-0717-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). It is effective to lower plasma LDL levels by enhancing hepatic LDLR expression. At the transcriptional level, LDLR expression is predominantly activated by sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 (SREBP2), which binds to the sterol regulatory element (SRE) in the promoter of LDLR to trigger its transcription (4Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. The SREBP pathway: regulation of cholesterol metabolism by proteolysis of a membrane-bound transcription factor.Cell. 1997; 89 (9150132): 331-34010.1016/S0092-8674(00)80213-5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2781) Google Scholar). In addition to SREBP2, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 (PCSK9) regulates LDLR expression at the post-translational level (5Poirier S. Mayer G.

Ther. 2013; 7 (24115837): 1135-114810.2147/DDDT.S36984PubMed Google Scholar). PCSK9 can bind LDLR to lead LDLR degradation intracellularly, resulting in suppressed LDL clearance from the circulation (6Park S.W. Moon Y.A. Horton J.D.

Accordingly, reduction of PCSK9 decreases plasma LDL levels efficiently. PCSK9 is mainly synthesized and secreted from the liver, and the circulating PCSK9 has become an important target for treatment of cardiovascular diseases.

In addition, in Gulo and ApoE double-deficient (Gulo−/−Apoe−/−) mice, the total cholesterol (CHO) levels is decreased by increased ascorbic acid intake (16Nakata Y. Maeda N. Vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque morphology in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice unable to make ascorbic acid.Circulation. 2002; 105: 1485-149010.1161/01.CIR.0000012142.69612.25Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that ascorbic acid supplement can influence LDL metabolism. However, the precise actions and the involved mechanisms by ascorbic acid remain unknown. In this study, we investigated if ascorbic acid can affect LDL levels and the action is completed by regulating PCSK9 and LDLR expression. PCSK9 is mainly present in hepatocytes as a ∼72 kDa precursor and secreted from cells after autocleaved as a mature form with a molecular mass of ∼62 kDa (9Tao R. Xiong X. DePinho R.A. Deng C.X.

We first assessed the effects of ascorbic acid on PCSK9 expression in human hepatic cell lines, HepG2 and Huh7 cells. As shown in Fig. 1A, ascorbic acid down-regulated both PCSK9 precursor and mature form in HepG2 cell in concentration- and time-dependent manners. To determine whether inhibition of PCSK9 protein expression by ascorbic acid is associated with reduced PCSK9 mRNA expression, total cellular RNA was extracted after treatment and used to determine PCSK9 mRNA levels by qRT-PCR. Consistently, ascorbic acid reduced PCSK9 mRNA expression in the similar patterns to protein (Fig. 1B), indicating reduction of PCSK9 expression by ascorbic acid can be at a transcriptional level. Similar to HepG2 cells, ascorbic acid also reduced PCSK9 protein and mRNA expression in Huh7 cells, another human hepatic cell line (Fig. 1, C and D). Inhibition of PCSK9 expression can result in increased LDLR protein levels (18Tavori H. Giunzioni I. Fazio S. PCSK9 inhibition to reduce cardiovascular disease risk: recent findings from the biology of PCSK9.Curr. Opin. Endocrinol. Diabetes Obes. 2015; 22 (25692926): 126-13210.1097/MED.0000000000000137Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To detect whether ascorbic acid-reduced PCSK9 can increase LDLR protein expression, we evaluated LDLR protein levels by Western blotting, and found LDLR expression in HepG2 cells was increased by ascorbic acid in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). In addition, ascorbic acid increased LDLR mRNA expression (Fig. 2B), indicating it may enhance LDLR levels at both transcriptional and translational levels. Meanwhile, we found a significant increase of Dil-LDL uptake by HepG2 cell in response to ascorbic acid treatment (Fig. 2C), suggesting the enhanced LDLR activity by ascorbic acid. In parallel, ascorbic acid induced LDLR protein and mRNA expression, as well as uptake of Dil-LDL by Huh7 cells (Fig. 2, D–F). Furthermore, we treated primary hepatocytes isolated from C57BL/6J mice with ascorbic acid. Similarly, ascorbic acid increased LDLR although decreased PCSK9 expression in murine primary hepatocytes (Fig. 2G), which indicates that regulation of PCSK9/LDLR expression by ascorbic acid is not species-dependent. To identify the molecular mechanism by which ascorbic acid inhibits PCSK9 expression in hepatocytes, we detected effects of ascorbic acid on transcription factors responsible for PCSK9 expression, such as PPARγ and FoxO3a. Although it has been reported that ascorbic acid deficiency up-regulates PPARγ in the liver of senescence marker protein 30-deficient mice (19Park J.K. Ki M.R. Lee H.R. Hong I.H. Ji A.R. Ishigami A. Park S.I. Kim J.M. Chung H.Y. Yoo S.E. Jeong K.S. Vitamin C deficiency attenuates liver fibrosis by way of up-regulated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ expression in senescence marker protein 30 knockout mice.Hepatology. 2010; 51 (20162732): 1766-177710.1002/hep.23499Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), we observed that both PPARγ protein and mRNA levels were not altered by ascorbic acid (Fig. 3, A and B). In contrast, ascorbic acid clearly increased FoxO3a protein and mRNA expression (Fig. 3, A and B). We further examined the transcriptional activity of PPARγ and FoxO3a. Consistently, mRNA levels of CD36 and fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4), the downstream genes of PPARγ (20Briot A. Decaunes P. Volat F. Belles C. Coupaye M. Ledoux S. Bouloumié A. Senescence alters PPARγ (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ)-dependent fatty acid handling in human adipose tissue microvascular endothelial cells and favors inflammation.Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2018; 38 (29545239): 1134-114610.1161/ATVBAHA.118.310797Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), were not affected by ascorbic acid either (Fig. 3C). In contrast, mRNA levels of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) and catalase (CAT), the downstream genes of FoxO3a (21Fasano C. Disciglio V. Bertora S. Lepore Signorile M. Simone C. FOXO3a from the nucleus to the mitochondria: A round trip in cellular stress response.Cells. 2019; 8: 111010.3390/cells8091110Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar), were obviously enhanced by ascorbic acid (Fig. 3D). Furthermore, increased FoxO3a nuclear translocation was determined in cells treated with ascorbic acid (Fig. 3, E and F). To investigate if ascorbic acid can decrease FoxO3a phosphorylation to enhance its nuclear translocation because the phosphorylated FoxO3a retains in the cytoplasm (22Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Akt promotes cell survival by phosphorylating and inhibiting a Forkhead transcription factor.Cell. 1999; 96 (10102273): 857-86810.1016/S0092-8674(00)80595-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5132) Google Scholar), we determined total and phosphorylated FoxO3a levels, and found ascorbic acid increased total FoxO3a but decreased phosphorylated FoxO3a levels (Fig. 3G). To further determine the role of FoxO3a in ascorbic acid-inhibited PCSK9 expression, we used FoxO3a siRNA to inhibit FoxO3a protein and mRNA expression (Fig. 4, A and B). As expected, inhibition of FoxO3a expression not only increased PCSK9 expression, but also abolished the effect of ascorbic acid on PCSK9 expression (Fig. 4, A and B). Moreover, FoxO3a siRNA attenuated ascorbic acid-induced LDLR expression (Fig. 4A), which should be due to the failure of PCSK9 inhibition in the presence of FoxO3a siRNA. It has been reported that PCSK9 promoter contains a FoxO3a binding motif, the IRE, with a conserved sequence of TGTTTA (from −381 to −376) (9Tao R. Xiong X. DePinho R.A. Deng C.X. Dong X.C. FoxO3 transcription factor and Sirt6 deacetylase regulate low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol homeostasis via control of the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (Pcsk9) gene expression.J.

To clarify the role of FoxO3a in regulation of PCSK9 transcription by ascorbic acid, we constructed a normal human PCSK9 promoter and the promoter with IRE mutation (-381CGTCTT-376, the underlined letters are mutated nucleotides). We found that ascorbic acid reduced PCSK9 promoter activity in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 4C). However, mutation in IRE attenuated the inhibitory effect of ascorbic acid on PCSK9 transcription. In addition, FoxO3a siRNA abolished ascorbic acid-inhibited PCSK9 promoter activity (Fig. 4D). These results collectively suggest that FoxO3a plays a central role in suppressing PCSK9 transcription by ascorbic acid. Although inhibition of PCSK9 resulted in increased LDLR protein levels, we also observed induction of LDLR mRNA by ascorbic acid at high concentrations (Fig. 2, B and F). Thus, in addition to the regulation by PCSK9, ascorbic acid may activate LDLR expression by other pathways. SREBP2 is the transcription factor activating LDLR expression at the transcriptional level. We initially determined the effect of ascorbic acid on SREBP2 expression and maturation, and observed that ascorbic acid enhanced SREBP2 expression and maturation (Fig. 4E). To clarify the role of SREBP2 in regulating LDLR transcription by ascorbic acid, we used SREBP2 siRNA to inhibit SREBP2 expression. As expected, inhibition of SREBP2 expression abolished the enhancement of LDLR protein and mRNA expression by ascorbic acid (Fig. 4, E and F). Correspondingly, we found ascorbic acid enhanced LDLR promoter activity at a high concentration (Fig. 4G, left). However, the activation was abolished when SRE in LDLR promoter was mutated (Fig. 4G, right). Moreover, SREBP2 siRNA attenuated ascorbic acid-enhanced LDLR promoter activity (Fig. 4H). In addition, we determined the effect of ascorbic acid on stability of LDLR mRNA. Treatment of HepG2 cells with actinomycin D inhibited RNA transcription, therefore, reduced LDLR mRNA levels were determined with time of actinomycin D treatment due to the mRNA degradation. In contrast, compared with actinomycin D alone, co-treatment with ascorbic acid increased LDLR mRNA levels (Fig. 4I), suggesting ascorbic acid reduces LDLR mRNA degradation or increases its stability. Therefore, the data above suggest that in addition to activation by reduced PCSK9, ascorbic acid also activates LDLR expression by enhancing its stability and SREBP2 transcriptional activity. To determine the physiological relevance of ascorbic acid on PCSK9/LDLR expression, C57BL/6J mice fed either normal chow or a high-fat diet (HFD, containing 21% fat and 0.5% cholesterol) were i.p. injected ascorbic acid solution or vehicle (saline) daily for 1 week. Although WT mice do not depend on exogenous ascorbic acid supplement, as shown in Fig. 5, A and F, injection with ascorbic acid for 1 week still moderately increased ascorbic acid levels in the liver. Compared with control mice, ascorbic acid treatment did not cause differences to the animals, such as the ratio of liver weight to body weight and lipid profiles (Fig. 5, B and G). Similar to results in in vitro studies, PCSK9 levels in the liver of mice fed normal chow were decreased by ascorbic acid (Fig. 5, C and E). PCSK9 is mainly synthesized in the liver and is rapidly secreted into plasma after its maturation through a self-engaged autocatalytic cleavage (17Zaid A. Roubtsova A. Essalmani R. Marcinkiewicz J. Chamberland A. Hamelin J. Tremblay M. Jacques H. Jin W. Davignon J. Seidah N.G. Prat A. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9): hepatocyte-specific low-density lipoprotein receptor degradation and critical role in mouse liver regeneration.Hepatology. 2008; 48 (18666258): 646-65410.1002/hep.22354Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Thus, we evaluated the secretion of PCSK9 using an ELISA kit, and found ascorbic acid also significantly reduced circulating PCSK9 levels compared with control mice (27 ± 3 versus 41 ± 3 ng/ml, Fig. 5D). Consistently, ascorbic acid inhibited PCSK9 expression and secretion in HFD-fed mice (Fig. 5, H and I). Consequently, ascorbic acid treatment significantly enhanced LDLR expression in the liver (Fig. 5, C, E, H, and J). In addition to LDLR, associated with changes of FoxO3a and SREBP2 expression by ascorbic acid, expression of the target genes of FoxO3a (SOD1 and CAT) and SREBP2 (HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR), HMG-CoA synthase (HMGCS)) was also activated (Fig. 5, E and J). Naturally, C57BL/6J mice are able to synthesize ascorbic acid. They are not a hyperlipidemic model even though they are fed HFD. Therefore, technically it is not easy to manipulate ascorbic acid levels in vivo to influence LDL levels in mice naturally. To further clarify the effect of ascorbic acid on cholesterol metabolism in vivo, we investigated the effect of ascorbic acid deficiency on regulation of the LDL metabolism in Gulo−/− mice, the animals are fully dependent on exogenous ascorbic acid supplement. After removal of ascorbic acid from the drinking water for 3 weeks, compared with WT mice, Gulo deficiency reduced ascorbic acid more than 60% in the liver (Fig. 6A). Associated with reduced ascorbic acid, serum PCSK9 levels and hepatic PCSK9 expression were increased (Fig. 6, B-D), which resulted in reduced hepatic LDLR expression in Gulo−/− mice (Fig. 6, C and D). Correspondingly, serum LDL levels were significantly increased, whereas HDL levels were decreased, thereby resulting in decreased ratio of HDL to LDL (Fig. 6E). In contrast to ascorbic acid deficiency, injection of HFD-fed Gulo−/− mice with ascorbic acid solution for 2 weeks substantially increased ascorbic acid levels in the liver (Fig. 6F). Associated with increased hepatic ascorbic acid levels, serum PCSK9 levels and hepatic PCSK9 expression were reduced (Fig. 6, G-I). Meanwhile, hepatic LDLR expression was activated (Fig. 6, H and I). Consequently, serum LDL levels were reduced, whereas HDL levels and the ratio of HDL to LDL were increased by exogenous ascorbic acid supplement in Gulo−/− mice (Fig. 6J). In addition, we observed reduced SREBP2 and FoxO3a activity (decreased HMGCR, HMGCS, SOD1, and CAT, Fig. 6D) by ascorbic acid deficiency, and activated both (activated HMGCR, HMGCS, SOD1 and CAT, Fig. 6I) by ascorbic acid supplement in Gulo−/− mice fed HFD. Taken together, these results suggest the importance of hepatic ascorbic acid in maintaining cholesterol homeostasis. The correlation between PCSK9 and circulating cholesterol levels has been well established (11Abdollahzad H. Eghtesadi S. Nourmohammadi I. Khadem-Ansari M. Nejad-Gashti H. Esmaillzadeh A.

Our results above suggest that ascorbic acid deficiency increased PCSK9 expression, which can make a substantial contribution to increased LDL levels in Gulo−/− mice. Similar to guinea pigs or Gulo−/− mice, human beings are not able to produce ascorbic acid either, and our life solely depends on the exogenous ascorbic acid supplement. Therefore, we speculated that ascorbic acid levels in humans could be one of determinants for circulating PCSK9, LDL and total CHO levels. To determine it, we collected serum samples form 24 volunteers and determined levels of CHO, LDL, PCSK9, and ascorbic acid. Consistent with the previous study, serum CHO and LDL levels were positively correlated to PCSK9 levels (data not shown). Interestingly, we observed that PCSK9 levels were negatively correlated to ascorbic acid levels in human serum (Fig. 6K). Furthermore, serum ascorbic acid levels were negatively correlated to serum CHO and LDL levels (Fig. 6, L and M), suggesting the role of ascorbic acid in regulating PCSK9 expression and cholesterol metabolism in humans. As a water-soluble antioxidant, ascorbic acid has multiple biological functions. It is essential for collagen synthesis and enzyme activity maintenance (13Michels A.J. Hagen T.M. Frei B.

Lack of ascorbic acid production in mice exacerbates diabetic kidney injury, suggesting that compensation for ascorbic acid loss is an effective treatment for diabetic kidney injury (26Ji X. Hu X.

https://openalex.org/W3086467150,"The molecular mechanisms behind infection and propagation of human restricted pathogens such as human norovirus (HuNoV) have defied interrogation because they were previously unculturable. However, human intestinal enteroids (HIEs) have emerged to offer unique ex vivo models for targeted studies of intestinal biology, including inflammatory and infectious diseases. Carbohydrate-dependent histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs) are known to be critical for clinical infection. To explore whether HBGAs of glycosphingolipids contribute to HuNoV infection, we obtained HIE cultures established from stem cells isolated from jejunal biopsies of six individuals with different ABO, Lewis, and secretor genotypes. We analyzed their glycerolipid and sphingolipid compositions and quantified interaction kinetics and the affinity of HuNoV virus-like particles (VLPs) to lipid vesicles produced from the individual HIE-lipid extracts. All HIEs had a similar lipid and glycerolipid composition. Sphingolipids included HBGA-related type 1 chain glycosphingolipids (GSLs), with HBGA epitopes corresponding to the geno- and phenotypes of the different HIEs. As revealed by single-particle interaction studies of Sydney GII.4 VLPs with glycosphingolipid-containing HIE membranes, both binding kinetics and affinities explain the patterns of susceptibility toward GII.4 infection for individual HIEs. This is the first time norovirus VLPs have been shown to interact specifically with secretor gene–dependent GSLs embedded in lipid membranes of HIEs that propagate GII.4 HuNoV ex vivo, highlighting the potential of HIEs for advanced future studies of intestinal glycobiology and host-pathogen interactions."
https://openalex.org/W3085366006,"The change of direction (COD) ability is an important task-specific skill for success in team sports, dependent on both strength and reactive strength. The sprint approaching the COD and degrees of the turn are factors influencing the specificity of the COD. Thus, CODs have been suggested to be categorized as force- (> 90°) and velocity-dominant (< 90°) dependent on the degree of the turn. When training programmes fail to provide a significant increase in COD performance, it is often due to neglecting the task-specific demands of the COD. As such, 23 male football players volunteered to complete a randomized controlled trial, investigating the association of maximal strength and power performance with performance in a force- (180°) and velocity-dominant (45°) COD, with a 4 m and 20 m sprint approach. Three strength and three plyometric exercises, matched in movement patterns, were used. Muscle activity of the different conditions was also compared. The correlational analysis revealed that better performance in the plyometric tests were associated with less time to complete both force- and velocity-dominant CODs, supported by similarities in muscle activation. None of the performances in strength exercises correlated to COD performance, due to the slow contraction velocity of maximal lifts. It was concluded that plyometrics share more physical similarities with CODs than the strength exercises."

Here, we investigate the role of ORP2 in endothelial cell (EC) cholesterol and PI(4,5)P2 distribution, angiogenic signaling, and angiogenesis. We show that ORP2 knock-down modifies the distribution of cholesterol accessible to a D4H probe, between late endosomes and the PM. Depletion of ORP2 from ECs inhibits their angiogenic tube formation capacity, alters the gene expression of angiogenic signaling pathways such as VEGFR2, Akt, mTOR, eNOS, and Notch, and reduces EC migration, proliferation, and cell viability. We show that ORP2 regulates the integrity of VEGFR2 at the PM in a cholesterol-dependent manner, the depletion of ORP2 resulting in proteolytic cleavage by matrix metalloproteinases, and reduced activity of VEGFR2 and its downstream signaling. We demonstrate that ORP2 depletion increases the PM PI(4,5)P2 coincident with altered F-actin morphology, and reduces both VEGFR2 and cholesterol in buoyant raft membranes. Moreover, ORP2 knock-down suppresses the expression of the lipid raft-associated proteins VE-cadherin and caveolin-1. Analysis of the retinal microvasculature in ORP2 knock-out mice generated during this study demonstrates the subtle alterations of morphology characterized by reduced vessel length and increased density of tip cells and perpendicular sprouts. Gene expression changes in the retina suggest disturbance of sterol homeostasis, downregulation of VE-cadherin, and a putative disturbance of Notch signaling. Our data identifies ORP2 as a novel regulator of EC cholesterol and PI(4,5)P2 homeostasis and cholesterol-dependent angiogenic signaling."

Viruses exploit many strategies to encapsidate the genome that codes for its container. The exact packaging process depends on the nature and form of the genetic material as well as the container or capsid. For some dsDNA viruses, there is clear structural separation between container and message; the genome is pumped into the preformed protein capsid by ATP-activated motor proteins (1Aksyuk A.A.

Ionic strength-dependent persistence lengths of single-stranded RNA and DNA.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Because ssRNA viruses are prevalent in human disease, there is significant interest in revealing their assembly mechanisms and packaged structures. Fortunately, a fair amount is known about RNA structure from work on other biological RNAs. These polymers contain self-complementary regions and fold on themselves to form series of short, base-paired duplexes joined by a wide range of non–base-paired regions, including junctions, bulges, or loops. Many of these latter motifs serve as protein-binding sites. In viral genomic RNA, recent work suggests that some RNA motifs that bind proteins, so-called packaging signals, are essential for viral assembly (11Bunka D.H.J. Lane S.W. Lane C.L. Dykeman E.C.

Their presence may explain why ssRNA viruses selectively pack their own genome relative to other cellular RNAs. Thus, the prevailing picture of how ssRNA genomes are encapsidated by proteins in viruses may be best viewed as a cooperative, specific protein-RNA folding process, as opposed to a sequential assembly of protein capsid followed by genome insertion (19Twarock R. Stockley P.G. RNA-mediated virus assembly: Mechanisms and consequences for viral evolution and therapy.Annu. Rev.

The self-assembly of ssRNA viruses can therefore be viewed as a process that exploits the delicate balance between RNA–RNA interactions, RNA–protein interactions and, of course, protein–protein interactions (20Patel N.

From this vantage point, the packaging of some ssRNA genomes can be recast as an RNA folding problem. In the past 10–20 years, significant progress has been made toward defining the rules for RNA folding, largely in response to the growing appreciation of the role of RNA conformational dynamics in biology (22Ganser L.R.

Time-resolved experiments have been particularly useful at revealing the dynamics and transiently populated states of RNA. When compared with simulations or models, these studies elucidate the principles that direct folding of small to moderately sized (<1 kb) RNAs (24Plumridge A. Katz A.M. Calvey G.D. Elber R. Kirmizialtin S. Pollack L.

Of the many biophysical tools applied to study the dynamic restructuring of RNAs, solution small-angle X-ray scattering (or SAXS) is particularly useful for revealing large-scale, time-dependent conformational changes. SAXS has been recently applied to monitor the changing structures that accompany capsid self-assembly, providing new information about the underlying mechanisms for the simplest systems (34Kler S.

These works are informative but confounded by SAXS' sensitivity to all components present: both capsid components and nucleic acid. In fact, most of the information extracted was related to the number, and/or conformation of protein subunits. Thus, past kinetic studies of virus assembly by SAXS primarily reported the assembly of the capsid. Fortunately, contrast variation (CV-) SAXS can be used to extract the structures of individual components of complexes, when these components have different electron densities. The nucleic acid genome, for example, can be selectively detected even when encapsidated. The high X-ray flux available at synchrotron sources has already enabled time-resolved CV-SAXS studies of nucleic acid structuring by proteins in other systems (38Chen Y. Tokuda J.M. Topping T. Meisburger S.P. Pabit S.A. Gloss L.M. Pollack L. Asymmetric unwrapping of nucleosomal DNA propagates asymmetric opening and dissociation of the histone core.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Applying this technique to study viral assembly could reveal valuable information about the role of RNA in the assembly process. The goal of this work is to assess the feasibility of time-resolved CV-SAXS studies of virus assembly. Here we report static CV-SAXS studies of bacteriophage MS2, a model system. Bacteriophage MS2 is an Escherichia coli phage from the leviviridae family with an ssRNA genome of 3569 nucleotides, and a T = 3 icosahedral capsid. This container is composed of 180 copies of the capsid protein and a maturation protein. MS2 is commonly used as model system to study +ssRNA viral assembly. As such, it has been widely studied both biochemically (39Rolfsson Ó. Toropova K. Ranson N.A. Stockley P.G.

In these studies, structural information about the encapsidated RNA was inferred, not directly measured. Furthermore, the ability to perform these measurements with X-rays exploits the higher signals available from synchrotron sources relative to neutron sources. Recent asymmetric cryo-EM reconstructions have produced electron density models of the encapsidated RNA for comparison with our findings (5Dai X. Li Z. Lai M. Shu S. Du Y. Zhou Z.H. Sun R.

The MS2 system is an excellent candidate for future time-resolved studies, as recent work suggests that, as a result of specific interactions with capsid proteins, its assembly pathways are orderly (49Garmann R.F.

Thus, it is an ideal candidate to benchmark the performance of contrast variation SAXS in virus self-assembly experiments. With the goal of directly measuring the encapsidated viral RNA, we performed CV-SAXS on bacteriophage MS2, as well as a recombinantly produced MS2 virus-like particle (VLP) devoid of viral RNA. Contrast variation SAXS, illustrated in Fig. 1 and described in full detail in Ref. 53Tokuda J.M. Pabit S.A. Pollack L. Protein–DNA and ion–DNA interactions revealed through contrast variation SAXS.Biophys. Rev. 2016; 8 (27551324): 139-14910.1007/s12551-016-0196-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, exclusively detects the nucleic acid component of a protein-RNA complex, enabling structural studies of the RNA genome contained within the fully assembled virus and potentially throughout the assembly or disassembly process. Time-resolved CV-SAXS has been successfully implemented in studies of DNA unwrapping from protein (histone) cores in nucleosome core particles (38Chen Y. Tokuda J.M. Topping T. Meisburger S.P. Pabit S.A. Gloss L.M. Pollack L. Asymmetric unwrapping of nucleosomal DNA propagates asymmetric opening and dissociation of the histone core.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2017; 114 (28028239): 334-33910.1073/pnas.1611118114Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, in nucleosome core particles, the nucleic acid surrounds the proteins, whereas the opposite is true for viruses. We first address the feasibility of CV-SAXS for particles where the nucleic acid is enclosed by protein. Previous work from Zipper et al. (54Zipper P. Kratky O. Herrmann R. Hohn T. An X-ray small angle study of the bacteriophages fr and R17.Eur. J. Biochem. 1971; 18 (5540512): 1-910.1111/j.1432-1033.1971.tb01206.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) suggests that contrast variation works equally well in either geometry. They performed a limited set of contrast variation SAXS on bacteriophages fr and R17. They extrapolated the radial electron density distribution for the phages but did not thoroughly explore the contrast matched condition. The use of high intensity X-ray sources and sophisticated SAXS data analysis tools make it worthwhile to revisit this approach. To establish the feasibility of CV-SAXS in virus-like systems, we first performed control experiments on the empty capsid, the MS2 VLP. These studies directly address two primary concerns of CV-SAXS in these systems. The first is that the capsid may be impermeable to the contrast agent, resulting in different electron densities on its inside and outside. As described in Ref. 53Tokuda J.M. Pabit S.A. Pollack L. Protein–DNA and ion–DNA interactions revealed through contrast variation SAXS.Biophys. Rev. 2016; 8 (27551324): 139-14910.1007/s12551-016-0196-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, we use high concentrations of sucrose to effect the dramatic changes in solvent electron density required to match the protein density. If the capsid is impermeable to sucrose, the solvent inside the capsid would have an excess negative electron density relative to the solvent outside. Because scattering depends only on density differences, which can be positive or negative, a signal would result. This effect is illustrated using a simple model that treats the capsid as a spherical shell. An analytical solution (see “Experimental procedures”) is used to obtain scattering profiles where the density inside the sphere is different from the density outside. Spheres are particularly amenable to characterization using SAXS; their dimensions are encoded in the positions of (multiple) extrema in the scattering profiles. In particular, the positions of the minima reflect the size of the particle. Fig. 2 shows the predicted behavior of the two cases, a permeable versus nonpermeable capsid, as the (outer) solvent electron density is raised. Here, the expected intensity of the scattered X-rays (I on the y axis) is plotted against the momentum transfer q, defined to be q = (4π sin(θ)/λ), where λ is the X-ray wavelength and 2θ is the scattering angle. Noise was added to simulate realistic experimental conditions. In the former case, the overall signal decreases without significant change in the shape of the scattering profile, assessed through the positions of the extrema. In contrast, for the latter case of a nonpermeable capsid, the positions of the maxima and minima of the scattering profile change, and the signal intensity never drops substantially. A second concern is that sucrose could create osmotic pressures that swell, disrupt, or cause other structural modifications of the capsid. These changes are harder to predict; however, any significant alterations would manifest through a change in the positions of the extrema. The absence of a significant change in the scattering profile of the VLP through the contrast series would suggest that the structure of the capsid is not altered (at the resolution of our measurements) by osmotic effects. Experimentally determined SAXS scattering profiles of the MS2 VLP, acquired in solutions containing different amounts of sucrose, are shown in Fig. 3. As the protein contrast is reduced by increasing the sucrose concentration, the intensity of the scattering profile decreases, but no change"
https://openalex.org/W3086367191,"Leaf morphology is one of the most important agronomic traits in rice breeding because of its contribution to crop yield. The drooping leaf (dr) mutant was developed from the Ilpum rice cultivar by ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) mutagenesis. Compared with the wild type, dr plants exhibited drooping leaves accompanied by a small midrib, short panicle, and reduced plant height. The phenotype of the dr plant was caused by a mutation within a single recessive gene on chromosome 2, dr (LOC_Os02g15230), which encodes a GDSL esterase. Analysis of wild-type and dr sequences revealed that the dr allele carried a single nucleotide substitution, glycine to aspartic acid. RNAi targeted to LOC_Os02g15230 produced same phenotypes to the dr mutation, confirming LOC_Os02g15230 as the dr gene. Microscopic observations and plant nutrient analysis of SiO2 revealed that silica was less abundant in dr leaves than in wild-type leaves. This study suggests that the dr gene is involved in the regulation of silica deposition and that disruption of silica processes lead to drooping leaf phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W3085509249,"Introduction During the Covid-19 pandemic, major journals have published a significant number of Covid-19 related articles in a short period of time. While this is necessary to combat the worldwide pandemic, it may have trade-offs with respect to publishing research from other disciplines. Objectives To assess differences in published research design before and after the Covid-19 pandemic. Methods We performed a cross-sectional review of all 322 full-length research studies published between October 1, 2019 and April 30, 2020 in three major medical journals. We compared the number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and studies with a control group before and after January 31, 2020, when Covid-19 began garnering international attention. Results The number of full-length research studies per issue was not statistically different before and after the Covid-19 pandemic (from 3.7 to 3.5 per issue, p = 0.17). Compared to before January 31, 2020, 0.7 fewer non-Covid-19 studies per issue were published versus after January 31, 2020 (p<0.001), a change that was offset by Covid-19 studies. Among non-Covid-19 studies, 0.9 fewer studies with a control group per issue were published after January 31, 2020, with RCTs contributing to nearly all the decline (p<0.001, p = 0.001, respectively). In the same timeframe, non-Covid-19 studies without a control group and non-Covid-19 studies without randomization experienced relatively small changes that did not meet our threshold for statistical significance (increases of 0.1 and 0.1 per issue, p = 0.80, p = 0.88, respectively). Limitations Using a simple heuristic for assessing research design and lack of generalizability to the general medical literature. Conclusions In summary, the increase in Covid-19 studies coincided with a decrease of mostly non-Covid-19 RCTs."
https://openalex.org/W3086860454,"The evolution of glyphosate resistance (GR) in weeds is an increasing problem. Glyphosate has been used intensively on wild poinsettia (Euphorbia heterophylla L.) populations for at least 20 years in GR crops within South America. We investigated the GR mechanisms in a wild poinsettia population from a soybean field in southern Brazil. The GR population required higher glyphosate doses to achieve 50% control (LD50) and 50% dry mass reduction (MR50) compared to a glyphosate susceptible (GS) population. The ratio between the LD50 and MR50 of GR and GS resulted in resistance factors (RF) of 6.9-fold and 6.1-fold, respectively. Shikimate accumulated 6.7 times more in GS than in GR when leaf-discs were incubated with increasing glyphosate concentrations. No differences were found between GR and GS regarding non-target-site mechanisms. Neither population metabolized glyphosate to significant levels following treatment with 850 g ha-1 glyphosate. Similar levels of 14C-glyphosate uptake and translocation were observed between the two populations. No differences in EPSPS expression were found between GS and GR. Two target site mutations were found in all EPSPS alleles of homozygous resistant plants: Thr102Ile + Pro106Thr (TIPT-mutation). Heterozygous individuals harbored both alleles, wild-type and TIPT. Half of GR individuals were heterozygous, suggesting that resistance is still evolving in the population. A genotyping assay was developed based on the Pro106Thr mutation, demonstrating high efficiency to identify homozygous, heterozygous or wild-type EPSPS sequences across different plants. This is the first report of glyphosate-resistant wild-poinsettia harboring an EPSPS double mutation (TIPT) in the same plant."
https://openalex.org/W3084553732,"The Philippines confirmed its first epidemic of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) on August 11, 2017. It ended in November of 2017. Despite the successful management of the epidemic, reemergence is a continuous threat. The aim of this study was to conduct a mathematical model to assess the spatial transmission of HPAI among poultry farms in Central Luzon. Different control strategies and the current government protocol of 1 km radius pre-emptive culling (PEC) from infected farms were evaluated. The alternative strategies include 0.5km PEC, 1.5km PEC, 2 km PEC, 2.5 km PEC, and 3 km PEC, no pre-emptive culling (NPEC). The NPEC scenario was further modeled with a time of government notification set at 24hours, 48 hours, and 72 hours after the detection. Disease spread scenarios under each strategy were generated using an SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed) stochastic model. A spatial transmission kernel was calculated and used to represent all potential routes of infection between farms. We assumed that the latent period occurs between 1–2 days, disease detection at 5–7 days post-infection, notification of authorities at 5–7 days post-detection and start of culling at 1–3 days post notification. The epidemic scenarios were compared based on the number of infected farms, the total number of culled farms, and the duration of the epidemic. Our results revealed that the current protocol is the most appropriate option compared with the other alternative interventions considered among farms with reproductive ratio (Ri) > 1. Shortening the culling radius to 0.5 km increased the duration of the epidemic. Further increase in the PEC zone decreased the duration of the epidemic but may not justify the increased number of farms to be culled. Nonetheless, the no-pre-emptive culling (NPEC) strategy can be an effective alternative to the current protocol if farm managers inform the government immediately within 24 hours of observation of the presence of HPAI in their farms. Moreover, if notification is made on days 1–3 after the detection, the scale and length of the outbreak have been significantly reduced. In conclusion, this study provided a comparison of various control measures for confronting the spread of HPAI infection using the simulation model. Policy makers can use this information to enhance the effectiveness of the current control strategy."
https://openalex.org/W3084942666,"Aim In view of the current context of poverty and socio-economic inequalities and the high and rising burdens of HIV infection and non-communicable diseases in South Africa, this study aims to describe the distribution of adverse life events (ALEs) by age and gender, and examine the socio-demographic characteristics, psychosocial coping mechanisms, risky lifestyle behaviours and family burden of HIV-related ill-health associated with ALEs in 25-74-year-old black residents of Cape Town. Materials and methods In a random cross-sectional sample, 12 ALEs, tobacco and alcohol use, sense of coherence (SOC), locus of control (LOC) and impact of HIV in the family were determined by administered questionnaires. Data analyses included descriptive statistics adjusted for the realised sample. Multivariable linear regression models assessed the independent associations of increasing number of ALEs. Results Among 1099 participants, mean lifetime score of ALE categories examined was 6.1 ±2.1 (range 0–12) with men reporting significantly higher number of events compared with women (p<0.001). The most frequent ALE was the death of a loved one (88.5%) followed by a major financial crisis (81.2%) with no trend across gender or age group. In the multivariable linear regression model, increasing ALEs were significantly associated with male gender, unemployment, having spent >50% of life in urban areas, >7 years of education, problematic alcohol use and poorer psychosocial coping mechanisms defined by low SOC and LOC. All four variables pertaining to HIV-related burden of ill-health in the family were significantly associated with increasing ALEs. Conclusions Considering that lower SOC and LOC and problem drinking were significantly linked to ALEs, policymakers need to formulate strategies that improve coping mechanisms and promote problem-solving behaviours, target the high burden of alcohol misuse and address unemployment."
https://openalex.org/W3086355972,"In Australia, physiotherapists are registered healthcare practitioners who possess the knowledge and skills to care for clients with poor physical health as a result of musculoskeletal, neurological, and respiratory conditions. Although physiotherapists are not considered a primary profession in the Australian mental health workforce, the association between suicide and poor physical health suggests that they may encounter clients with suicidal thoughts and behaviours. We used a qualitative approach inspired by phenomenology to explore the experiences of nine physiotherapists who encountered clients with suicidal thoughts and behaviours. We used a combination of focus groups and in-depth interviews to collect this data. The data were analysed inductively using framework analysis. The main themes identified in the data were: i) the importance of trust, ii) the mechanism of conversation, and iii) the 'middle space'. The middle space refers to the experience of working with clients at risk of low or medium risk of suicide. A trusting practitioner-client relationship was reported to be essential in facilitating the disclosure of suicidal thoughts and behaviours. Physiotherapists also reported that less structured subjective assessments encourage clients to talk more openly, which in turn facilitates the disclosure of suicidal thoughts and behaviours. Once the disclosure of suicidal thoughts and behaviours occurred, physiotherapists reported a lack of confidence regarding role clarity and issues associated with this. Difficulties were most evident during encounters with clients with low to medium suicide risk due to a lack of confidence in the accuracy of assessment of these clients. The findings suggest that physiotherapists are well placed to detect and/or receive disclosure of suicidal thoughts and behaviours, as well as the need for physiotherapists to be trained in how to support clients who disclose suicidal thoughts and behaviours."
https://openalex.org/W3086877538,"We report a powerful method for capturing the time-resolved concentration profiles, liquid swelling and surface phenomena during the absorption of methane (CH4) in still liquid ethanol (C2D6O) and n-decane (n-C10D22) and at high spatial resolution (pixel size 21.07 μm) using neutron imaging. Absorption of supercritical methane was followed at two temperatures and two pressures of methane, namely 7.0, 37.8 °C and 80, 120 bar. Fick’s second law, which was used in the liquid-fixed coordinates, enabled for an adequate parameterization of the observed concentration profiles and liquid levels using simple analytical expressions. For both studied liquids, anomalously slow diffusion was observed in the initial stage of the absorption experiment. This was ascribed to the slow formation of the surface excess on the interface, time constant ranged 130–275 s. The axial symmetry of the cell allowed for the tomographic reconstructions of the profiles of the menisci. Based on these profiles, contact angle and surface tension were evaluated using the Young-Laplace equation. Overall, neutron imaging made it possible to capture time- and space-resolved information from which the methane concentration, liquid level and meniscus shape under high-pressure conditions inside a cylindrical titanium vessel were quantitatively derived. Multiple characteristics of ethanol, a methane hydrate inhibitor, and n-decane, a model constituent of crude oil, were thus measured for the first time under industrially relevant conditions in a one-pot experiment."
https://openalex.org/W3086758044,"Counterproductive academic behaviors (CAB) is a problem that has plagued academic institutions for centuries. However, research has mostly been focused on higher learning institutes in North America. For this reason, literature on CAB must be expanded to other geographical areas and academic levels. The present research analyses the prevalence and correlates of CAB in a sample of Spanish high school students. The results indicate that CAB is a common phenomenon, cheating and low effort behaviors being the most prevalent forms. Correlational analyses revealed that conscientiousness (ρ = -.55, p < .01), emotional stability (ρ = .28, p < .01), and agreeableness (ρ = -.26, p < .05) are predictors of CAB. Multiple regression analyses showed that conscientiousness is the dimension exerting the strongest impact on CAB (β = -.64, p < .01), followed by agreeableness, and emotional stability. These three dimensions accounted for 51% of CAB variance. Last, implications for theory and practice are described."
https://openalex.org/W3084716742,"Metaflammation is a primary inflammatory complication of metabolic disorders characterized by altered production of many inflammatory cytokines, adipokines, and lipid mediators. Whereas multiple inflammation networks have been identified, the mechanisms by which metaflammation is initiated have long been controversial. As the mevalonate pathway (MVA) produces abundant bioactive isoprenoids and abnormal MVA has a phenotypic association with inflammation/immunity, we speculate that isoprenoids from the MVA may provide a causal link between metaflammation and metabolic disorders. Using a line with the MVA isoprenoid producer geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase (GGPPS) deleted, we find that geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) depletion causes an apparent metaflammation as evidenced by abnormal accumulation of fatty acids, eicosanoid intermediates, and proinflammatory cytokines. We also find that GGPP prenylate cytochrome b5 reductase 3 (CYB5R3) and the prenylated CYB5R3 then translocate from the mitochondrial to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) pool. As CYB5R3 is a critical NADH-dependent reductase necessary for eicosanoid metabolism in ER, we thus suggest that GGPP-mediated CYB5R3 prenylation is necessary for metabolism. In addition, we observe that pharmacological inhibition of the MVA pathway by simvastatin is sufficient to inhibit CYB5R3 translocation and induces smooth muscle death. Therefore, we conclude that the dysregulation of MVA intermediates is an essential mechanism for metaflammation initiation, in which the imbalanced production of eicosanoid intermediates in the ER serve as an important pathogenic factor. Moreover, the interplay of MVA and eicosanoid metabolism as we reported here illustrates a model for the coordinating regulation among metabolite pathways.

Moreover, the interplay of MVA and eicosanoid metabolism as we reported here illustrates a model for the coordinating regulation among metabolite pathways. In obesity and several metabolic disorders, altered production of many inflammatory cytokines, adipokines, lipid mediators, and signaling through a plethora of immune receptors and intracellular mediators have been complicated. Such a metabolically triggered inflammation is called metaflammation (1Hotamisligil G.S. Inflammation and metabolic disorders.Nature. 2006; 444 (17167474): 860-86710.1038/nature05485Crossref PubMed Scopus (5530) Google Scholar), and now it is usually represents a state of chronic low-grade inflammation as a response to metabolic or nutrient disruption from one or more sources. It has been well-demonstrated that metaflammation seriously impacts the progression of the diseases (2Hotamisligil G.S. Inflammation, metaflammation and immunometabolic disorders.Nature. 2017; 542 (28179656): 177-18510.1038/nature21363Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar). Current knowledge shows that the integration of the metabolic and inflammatory signaling network occurs at multiple levels, but how the metabolic disorders start with inflammation have long been unclear. In light of the phenotypic association of the MVA pathway with inflammation/immunity (3Favier L.A. Schulert G.S. Mevalonate kinase deficiency: current perspectives.Appl. Clin. Genet. 2016; 9 (27499643): 101-11010.2147/TACG.S93933Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the MVA pathway might be a metabolic pathway triggering metaflammation. The MVA pathway is fundamental for cholesterol biosynthesis and acts as an essential lipid-lowering therapeutic target (4Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Regulation of the mevalonate pathway.Nature. 1990; 343 (1967820): 425-43010.1038/343425a0Crossref PubMed Scopus (4329) Google Scholar). This pathway begins with synthesis of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) by HMG-CoA synthase and then conversion of the resultant HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid by HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR), the rate-limiting enzyme of the MVA pathway. By over 20 subsequent enzyme reactions along this pathway, cholesterol is synthesized by the post-squalene pathway, and meanwhile several bioactive intermediaries and end products are produced by a nonsterol pathway. These nonsterol metabolites include isoprenoids, dolichol, ubiquinone, and isopentenyladenine. Among these metabolites, farnesyl diphosphate and GGPP are the primary forms of isoprenoids capable of modifying proteins (5McTaggart S.J. Isoprenylated proteins.Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2006; 63 (16378247): 255-26710.1007/s00018-005-5298-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Protein prenylation is a class of lipid modification of proteins, in which the farnesyl diphosphate (15-carbon) or GGPP (20-carbon) isoprenoids are covalently added to conserved cysteine residues (e.g. CAAX and CCXX) at or near the C terminus of proteins. This modification enables the proteins to interact with membrane or other proteins (5McTaggart S.J. Isoprenylated proteins.Cell Mol.

There are reports showing that small GTPases, including RAS, RHO, and RAB may be prenylated and translocated to membrane (7Clarke S.

Based on clinical observations from the mevalonate kinase deficiency patients with the mevalonate kinase loss-of-function gene mutation, however, the syndromes caused by the impairment of the MVA pathway are primarily exhibited by autoinflammation and autoimmune disorders (3Favier L.A.

We thus speculated that the MVA pathway served as an important regulator of sterile inflammation. This point is also supported by recent observations (17Munoz M.A. Jurczyluk J. Mehr S. Chai R.C.

The vascular smooth muscle seems sensitive to the impairment of MVA pathway. In addition, there is accumulating evidence showing a close relation of vascular smooth muscle in metabolic inflammation (25Sun J. Tao T. Zhao W. Wei L. She F. Wang P. Li Y. Zheng Y. Chen X. Wang W. Qiao Y. Zhang X.N. Zhu M.S. CPI-17-mediated contraction of vascular smooth muscle is essential for the development of hypertension in obese mice.J. Genet.

Biochem. 2018; 47 (29794461): 707-72010.1159/000490024Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We thus examined the role of GGPPS in vascular smooth muscle cells. By analyzing a mouse line with smooth muscle-specific deletion of Ggps1, we surprisingly found that the mutant mice displayed abnormal expression of the genes related to inflammation and immunity, along with a progressive apoptosis of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). The addition of exogenous GGPP was able to restore the apoptosis process in vitro. Moreover, the deletion of GGPPS resulted in a significant increase in polyunsaturated fatty acids, showing an impaired eicosanoid production. This effect was attributable to abolished prenylation of CYB5R3 and hence failed translocation from mitochondria to the ER pool. As CYB5R3 was a required reductase for maintaining the microsomal oxidation/reduction environment necessary for eicosanoid metabolism, we concluded that GGPP produced by the MVA pathway essentially regulated eicosanoids homeostasis. As the eicosanoids are closely related to inflammation and immunity, our result reveals a link of MVA or cholesterol biosynthesis with metaflammation. In postnatal animals, to adapt to new environments such as milk nutrition and developmental requirements, such tissues as blood vessels remodel their metabolic programs. Among these programs, cholesterol biosynthesis is particularly important for synthesis of membrane material necessary for cell proliferation. We first measured MVA-associated genes in developing aorta smooth muscle tissues by a real-time PCR assay. From embryonic day 18.5 to adulthood, Ggps1, farnesyl diphosphate synthase (Fdps), and Hmgcr genes were expressed at a relatively constant level. The maximum difference was within 4-fold (Fig. 1A), showing the important role of MVA metabolism during aorta smooth muscle development. The expression of Ggps1 was especially stable until day 25. We also measured the genes related to glycolysis (Hk2, Pfkp (platelet phosphofructokinase), Ldhb (lactate dehydrogenase B), and Pdk2 (pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoform 2)), lipolysis (Lpl), β-oxidation (Cpt1a (carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A) and Acadl (acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase)), lipogenesis (Fasn), and mitochondrial oxidation (Cox4i1 and Cox7a1 (cytochrome c oxidase subunit 4I1 and 7A1, respectively)). The expression levels of glucose and lipid metabolism–associated genes showed significant change with development and each played an important role at different stages (Fig. 1, B–D). To determine the role of GGPP/GGPPS in vivo, we established a line with smooth muscle–specific deletion of Ggps1 gene by crossing Ggps1flox/flox mice with SMA-Cre mice. The resultant Ggps1flox/flox; SMA-Cre+ (Ggps1SMKO) mice were used as knockout (KO) mice and Ggps1flox/flox; SMA-Cre− or Ggps1flox/+; SMA-Cre− mice were used as control (CTR) mice (Fig. 2A). A GGPPS expression in KO aorta declined up to 90% compared with CTR aorta while GGPPS expression in KO jejunum declined only 60% compared with CTR jejunum (Fig. 2, B and C). The birth of KO and CTR pups obeyed Mendelian ratio, but the KO pups started to die from 5 weeks after birth (Fig. 2E). The body weights of KO mice at 6 weeks were slightly reduced (CTR (21.71 ± 2.78 g) versus KO (18.47 ± 3.18 g), p < 0.05) (Fig. 2D). Macrophenotypic examination for the mutant mice showed normal morphologies of the main organs, including brain, lung, gut, bladder, airway, liver, and skeletal muscle (Fig. S1, A–C and F–J). The mutant hearts appeared slightly larger, but their histology and function show no apparent alteration (Fig. S1E and Table S1). To our surprise, the systolic blood pressure (SBP) of the KO mice at 7 weeks old was significantly reduced (from 116 ± 6.61 mm Hg of CTR to 66 ± 11.86 mm Hg; p < 0.0001) (Fig. 2F). Such a low SBP might cause severe cardiovascular disease and death (27Bundy J.D. Li C. Stuchlik P. Bu X. Kelly T.N. Mills K.T. He H. Chen J. Whelton P.K. He J. Systolic blood pressure reduction and risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality: a systematic review and network meta-analysis.JAMA Cardiol. 2017; 2 (28564682): 775-78110.1001/jamacardio.2017.1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 28Huynh K.

In addition, no aorta aneurysm phenotype was observed in the mutant mice (Fig. S1D). Thus, our observation indicates that that the hypotension induced by GGPPS deletion may be the leading cause of animal death. As blood pressure may be regulated by VSMC contraction (29Qiao Y.N. He W.Q. Chen C.P. Zhang C.H. Zhao W. Wang P. Zhang L. Wu Y.Z. Yang X. Peng Y.J. Gao J.M. Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. Zhu M.S. Myosin phosphatase target subunit 1 (MYPT1) regulates the contraction and relaxation of vascular smooth muscle and maintains blood pressure.J. Biol.

To our surprise, for the mesentery from 7-week-old mice, the contractile responses to KCl depolarization and agonists (norepinephrine (NE) and U46619) were almost abolished (Fig. 2G). Smooth muscle contraction depends on the expression of contractile proteins, such as SMA, smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (SMMHC), and calponin. Immunofluorescent staining with anti-SMA antibody showed no expression of contractile proteins in the 7-week-old mutant aorta (Fig. 3C). More surprisingly, there were no DAPI signals in smooth muscle layer, indicating that no smooth muscle cells existed within the tissue (Fig. 3C). Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining also supported this conclusion (Fig. 3E). To find the point at which the smooth muscle cells started to decrease, we tested the aorta smooth muscle morphology at diverse ages. Before 3 weeks after birth, the mutant aorta tissues had normal smooth muscle cells and regular elastic lines, whereas the mutant aorta from 3-week-old mice had fewer smooth muscle cells, and the elastic lines between muscle layers became straight. At 7 weeks after birth, almost no smooth muscle cells were observed, and the elastic lines were straightened entirely (Fig. 3, E and F). To test whether there was a problem with smooth muscle development, we also tested mesentery contraction function at 4 weeks old. Upon respective treatment with KCl depolarization and NE, the mesentery from 4-week-old KO mice developed significantly smaller force in contrast to CTR mice (KCl: KO (1.641 ± 0.35 mN) versus CTR (2.463 ± 0.425 mN), p < 0.005; NE: KO (1.78 ± 0.662 mN) versus CTR (2.98 ± 0.237 mN), p < 0.01). A similar inhibitory effect was also observed when the muscle was treated with U46619 (Fig. 3A). The corresponding reduction in the proportion of contraction function with smooth muscle cell decrease suggests a progressive loss of smooth muscle cells in the aorta, which agrees well with the force development. To characterize the cell death, we measured the broken DNAs with the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling(TUNEL) method and the protein expression of LC3-II, GASDME, and GASDMD by Western blotting. By 3 weeks after birth, the smooth muscle cells of the mutant aorta had a clear broken DNA signal (Fig. 3D and Fig. S2A). LC3-II expression both in whole cell and mitochondria fractions (Fig. S2B) was significantly increased. As no GASDMD or GASDME proteins expressed in aorta smooth muscle (Fig. S2C), the death of the mutant VSMCs was attributable to apoptosis mixed with mitophagy, rather than to pyroptosis. We then measured the rescue effect of exogenous GGPP in vitro. First, we isolated smooth muscle cells from 2-week-old mice and cultured in vitro. The CTR cells grew rapidly from the 4th to 5th day, whereas the mutant cells died gradually (Fig. 4A). Upon the addition of GGPP to the culture medium, the mutant cells displayed morphology comparable with that of CTR, although the growth velocity was relatively slow (Fig. 4, A and B). In addition, all of these rescued cells were SMA- and SMMHC-positive (Fig. 4C). These results strongly suggested that the apoptosis of the mutant cells was contributed by GGPP depletion. However, the primary cells of the mutant jejunum, airway, and bladder smooth muscles grew in a similar manner as in CTR cells (Fig. S3, A–F). This phenomenon explained that these smooth muscles were insensitive to GGPPS deletion due to heterogeneous metabolic patterns. However, the relative low KO efficiency of GGPPS in these tissues might contribute to this differential sensitivity also (Fig. 2, B and C). To determine the gene expression profile after GGPPS deletion, we subjected the GGPPS-deficient aorta tissue of 3-week-old mice to RNA-Seq analysis (Table S3). Among 1668 genes with >3-fold altered expression, 1013 genes were up-regulated, and 655 genes were down-regulated. GOTERM function analysis showed that these genes involved 537 pathways or physiological processes. Interestingly, most of them related to innate immunity or inflammation, such as the response to virus, neutrophil chemotaxis, interferon β, and proinflammatory cytokines (e.g. interleukin-6, interleukin-1, and tumor necrosis factor) (Fig. 5, A–C). This result indicated an apparent metaflammation phenotype after GGPPS deletion. BIOCARTA analysis showed that the altered genes involved cell cycle, eicosanoid metabolism, multiple-drug resistance factors, p53 signaling pathway, classical complement pathway, neutrophil markers, and Ras-independent pathway in NK cell–mediated cytotoxicity (Fig. 5D). To further validate the alteration of eicosanoids metabolism, qPCR assays were performed. As expected, the expressions of Ptgs-1 (also called Cox-1), Cyp2c5, and Ptgs-2 (also called Cox-2) were changed in the same pattern with the RNA-Seq results (Fig. S4). As eicosanoids are closely related to inflammatory responses (30Esser-von Bieren J. Immune-regulation and -functions of eicosanoid lipid mediators.Biol.

To learn how eicosanoid metabolism changed, we then examined by the LC–MS method the metabolic products of 53 liposomes related to eicosanoid metabolism (Table S4). Orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysis (O-PLS-DA) was initially applied to LC–MS data to illustrate separation between KO and control individuals (Fig. 6A). The S-plot highlighted four metabolites significantly correlated with GGPPS deficiency (leukotriene B4(LTB4), leukotriene E4(LTE4) instead of LTB4, LTE4, PGE1, and LXA5) (Fig. 6B). These dimensionality reduction analyses showed that the metabolite production was significantly changed in GGPPS-deficient aorta smooth muscle (Fig. 6, A and B) by their change in abundance (Fig. S5). In GGPPS-deficient smooth muscle, such fatty acids as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and arachidonic acid (AA) were accumulated significantly (Fig. 6C). Particularly, AA and its intermediate products were elevated apparently (e.g. LTB4 and LTE4 produced by 5-lipoxygenases (LOXs) were elevated about ∼4-fold; the (19R)-hydroxy-5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z-eicosatetraenoic acid (19-HETE) catalyzed by cytochrome P450 (CYP450) was elevated about ∼2-fold; the epoxyeicosatrienoic acids produced by CYP450, including 14,15-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (EET), 11,12-EET, 8,9-EET, and 5,6-EET, were elevated about ∼1.7-fold. The increased liposomes were reported to show proinflammatory tendency, such as chemotaxis of LTB4 (36Lämmermann T. Afonso P.V. Angermann B.R. Wang J.M. Kastenmüller W. Parent C.A. Germain R.N. Neutrophil swarms require LTB4 and integrins at sites of cell death in vivo.Nature. 2013; 498 (23708969): 371-37510.1038/nature12175Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar) and enhanced vascular permeability by LTE4 (37Chan C.C. Ford-Hutchinson A. Effects of synthetic leukotrienes on local blood flow and vascular permeability in porcine skin.J. Invest.

Therefore, the accumulation of fatty acids or eicosanoids and their bioactive intermediates implies damage to eicosanoid metabolism and thereby inducing inflammation and apoptosis (38Song Z. Huang G. Chiquetto Paracatu L. Grimes D. Gu J. Luke C.J. Clemens R.A. Dinauer M.C.

Given that the accumulated eicosanoids are a pathogenic factor for the inflammation and apoptosis, the neonatal animals in a suckling period would be expected to be more sensitive to GGPPS deletion because abundant polyunsaturated fatty acids existed in mother milk (39Nilsson A.K.

https://openalex.org/W3085417762,"“Do you have any advice for future graduate students?” I asked. The student had recently defended his Ph.D., and I was conducting an exit interview—something I do with every graduating biomedical Ph.D. student at my university, where I am in charge of evaluating our medical school's Ph.D. training programs. He sat back in his chair and thought for a minute before responding: He wished he had started to plan for his post-Ph.D. career earlier. My shoulders dropped and I let out a sigh. “Program directors recommend this to incoming students every year, but some don't seem to hear it,” I said. “How do you think we can get them to listen?” This time, he didn't hesitate. “They are graduate students in science ,” he exclaimed. “Show them the data!”



> “Even when you're just getting started, you need to look forward.” 

That was my aha moment. I immediately began to document the responses to this question in subsequent interviews. It has been 3 years now, and the data I've collected confirm my suspicions—the same answers come up again and again. As a new cohort of Ph.D. students starts grad school this fall, here are the five pieces of advice graduates offer most frequently.

Thirty-two percent of graduating students said this is the most critical decision a Ph.D. student can make. Many students gravitate toward mentors who work in areas they find interesting and exciting, but it is also important to think about what style of mentoring you respond to best. Finding a mentor with the right mentoring approach for you is at least as important as finding one who studies a specific topic.

You need time to (a) decide which career paths you find appealing and (b) start preparing for those careers. Twenty percent of graduating students recommended exploring future careers as early as possible so you can use your time in grad school to build additional skills you will need. To learn about specific professions, you can conduct informational interviews, attend seminars where alumni discuss their careers, do an internship, or engage in a variety of other options.

Graduate school is full of ups and downs. Thirteen percent of graduates said that if you feel the need to talk to someone on or off campus, don't hesitate. “If you are not happy, try to do something about it and make a change,” one student said. If you feel isolated, another student recommended joining a campus group to connect with others.

Twelve percent of graduates recommended that students consistently and critically evaluate their progress throughout their training. Make an outline of your research and career goals and when you want to achieve them, and hold yourself to that plan. Some students use an individual development plan to prompt discussions with their mentor and thesis committee. But don't wait for these meetings; setting goals and holding yourself accountable should be a continuous habit.

This looks different for different people, but don't ignore it. You should expect to work hard in grad school, but the right work-life balance can have an important influence on your mental health and overall quality of life. Nine percent of graduates recommended finding something that helps you unwind, such as pursuing hobbies, getting together with friends, or volunteering in the community.

Observant readers may notice that the numbers above only add up to 86%. Other pieces of advice included be assertive and ask for what you need, learn to trust your experimental results as long as the controls work, and plan your projects around what's needed for a publishable paper. But the most important thing is to take these pointers to heart early on. Even when you're just getting started, you need to look forward."
