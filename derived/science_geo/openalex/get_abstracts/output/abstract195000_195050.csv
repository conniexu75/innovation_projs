When fructose is placed on the mucosal side of hamster intestine in titro, some of the sugar is converted to glucose which appears predomi- nantly on the serosal side. This conversion is completely inhibited anaero- bically, while the movement of free fructose across the wall increases. Evi- dence is presented which suggests that the movement of free fructose is by passive diffusion. 2. Galactose is absorbed rapidly against a concentration gradient in this preparation and this absorption is completely inhibited anaerobically. 3. Glucose, galactose, and 3-methylglucose were the only sugars which were absorbed against a concentration gradient among those tested (fruc- tose, sorbose, mannose, arabinose, xylose, and ribose). 4. Sucrose, maltose, lactose, and starch were added to the mucosal side of the intestine and the rate of hydrolysis, as well as the rate of absorption of the split products, was studied. Thanks are due to Dr. S. H. Jaros of the Ayerst Laboratories (Division of American Home Products Corporation), New York, for a sample of 3-methylglucose."

It has been found to contain amino acids and hexosamine and gives the carbazole color reaction for uranic acid. It contains less than 0.1 per cent sulfur as sulfate, less than 0.2 per cent phosphorus, and less than 5 per cent lipides. No evidence for the presence of heparin was found. The molecular weight was estimated at 100,000, the mobility in Verona1 buffer at pH 8.6, p = 0.1, was -5.4 X 10-S sq. cm. per second per volt, the sedimentation constant was .so,~ = 3.75, and the diffusion constant was DZo = 3.4 f 0.3 x 10-â€™ sq. cm. per second.
