https://openalex.org/W1503667331,"Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) activates erythropoietin gene transcription in Hep3B cells subjected to hypoxia. HIF-1 activity is also induced by hypoxia in non-erythropoietin-producing cells, suggesting a more general regulatory role. We now report that RNAs encoding the glycolytic enzymes aldolase A (ALDA), phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1), and pyruvate kinase M were induced by exposure of Hep3B or HeLa cells to inducers of HIF-1 (1% O2, cobalt chloride, or desferrioxamine), whereas cycloheximide blocked induction of glycolytic RNAs and HIF-1 activity. Oligonucleotides from the ALDA, PGK1, enolase 1, lactate dehydrogenase A, and phosphofructokinase L (PFKL) genes, containing sequences similar to the HIF-1 binding site in the erythropoietin enhancer, specifically bound HIF-1 present in crude nuclear extracts or affinity-purified preparations. Sequences from the ALDA, PFKL, and PGK1 genes containing HIF-1 binding sites mediated hypoxia-inducible transcription in transient expression assays. These results support the role of HIF-1 as a mediator of adaptive responses to hypoxia that underlie cellular and systemic oxygen homeostasis."

PRS2 is a resistance gene of Arabidopsis thaliana that confers resistance against Pseudomonas syringae bacteria that express avirulence gene avrRpt2. RPS2 was isolated by the use of a positional cloning strategy. The derived amino acid sequence of RPS2 contains leucine-rich repeat, membrane-spanning, leucine zipper, and P loop domains. The function of the RPS2 gene product in defense signal transduction is postulated to involve nucleotide triphosphate binding and protein-protein interactions and may also involve the reception of an elicitor produced by the avirulent pathogen."

https://openalex.org/W2015197182,"In the last few years there have been rapid advances in developing genetic maps for humans, greatly enhancing our ability to localize and identify genes for inherited disorders. Through the collaborative efforts of three large groups generating microsatellite markers and the efforts of the 110 CEPH collaborators, a comprehensive human linkage map is presented here. It consists of 5840 loci, of which 970 are uniquely ordered, covering 4000 centimorgans on the sex-averaged map. Of these loci, 3617 are polymerase chain reaction-formatted short tandem repeat polymorphisms, and another 427 are genes. The map has markers at an average density of 0.7 centimorgan, providing a resource for ready transference to physical maps and achieving one of the first goals of the Human Genome Project—a comprehensive, high-density genetic map."

This report describes purification of a receptor for 1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3 (VDR) located in the basal-lateral membrane (BLM) of vitamin D-replete chick intestinal epithelium, which is implicated in the nongenomic stimulation of calcium transport (transcaltachia). The BLM-VDR exhibited saturable binding for [3H]1,25-(OH)2D3 (KD = 0.72 x 10(-9)M, Bmax = 0.24 pmol/mg of protein). A 4500-fold purification of the BLM-VDR receptor was achieved. In addition, saturable binding was observed for [3H]24R,25-(OH)2D3 at physiologically relevant levels (KD = 19 x 10(-9) M, Bmax = 2.4 pmol/mg of protein) to a component apparently distinct from the 1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3 BLM-VDR. A functional correlation between the BLM-VDR and transcaltachia was observed in three experimental situations: (i) vitamin D deficiency, which suppresses transcaltachia, resulted in reduced specific [3H]1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3 binding in the BLM-VDR, relative to corresponding fractions from vitamin D-replete chicks; (ii) the BLM-VDR exhibited down-regulation of specific [3H]1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3 binding following exposure to nonradioactive 1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3; and (iii) the relative potencies of two 6-s-cis analogs of 1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3 to initiate transcaltachia and their ability to compete with [3H]1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3 for binding to the BLM-VDR were parallel. The combined results support the existence of a plasmalemal 1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3 receptor which is a prime candidate for signal transduction in transcaltachia."

https://openalex.org/W1527680278,"Using gene targeting in embryonic stem cells, we have generated mice lacking apolipoprotein C-III (ApoC-III). Homozygous mutant animals show absence of ApoC-III protein and no expression of ApoC-III mRNA in the liver or in the intestine. Expression of the neighboring genes, coding for apolipoprotein A-I and apolipoprotein A-IV, are not altered in the liver but are reduced in the intestine. This suggests that these three genes share a tissue-specific element for intestinal expression and that insertion of an additional promoter for the neomycin-resistant gene into the locus affects interaction between the tissue-specific element and the promoter of the individual gene. Fasted plasma triglyceride levels in the homozygous mutants are reduced to about 70% of normal, while heterozygotes have values intermediate between those of the homozygous mutants and wild types. Plasma levels of total cholesterol and of high density lipoprotein cholesterol in homozygotes are consistently lower than those in normal mices but the reduction does not reach statistical significance. A fat meal test showed that postprandial hypertriglyceridemia is abolished in homozygotes lacking ApoC-III. The homozygous mutants also clear chylomicrons faster than wild type controls. These data indicate that ApoC-III modulates the catabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and plays a role in the postprandial management of triglycerides."

Fifty-nine of these genes (22 percent) were previously identified. Of the 210 novel genes, 65 are predicted to encode proteins that are similar to other proteins of known or predicted function. Sixteen genes appear to be relatively recently duplicated. On average, there is one gene approximately every 2 kilobases. Although the coding density and base composition across the chromosome are not uniform, no regular pattern of variation is apparent."

https://openalex.org/W1512267378,"Lactoferrin is an iron-binding protein which is synthesized by mucosal epithelium and neutrophils and released by these cells in response to inflammatory stimuli. It promotes neutrophil aggregation and manifests iron-dependent and -independent antimicrobial properties in vitro. Since lactoferrin binds to glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and sulfated polysaccharides can inhibit its clearance in vivo and in vitro, we sought to examine its interaction with the GAGs chondroitin sulfate and heparin. Amino-terminal sequencing of proteolytic fragments of human lactoferrin that were fractionated by GAG chromatography suggested that the amino-terminal 6 kDa of the secreted protein mediates its interaction with GAGs. Synthetic peptides were used to show that the first 33 residues of human lactoferrin can bind well to solid-phase or solution-phase GAGs. The first 33 residues bound fluoresceinamine-labeled heparin with an IC50 (611 nM) which approximated that of the intact protein (124 nM). In contrast, when the first six residues (GRRRRS) were removed from this peptide, it then bound poorly to heparin (IC50 = 49 microM). Our results suggest that the GRRRRS sequence at the amino terminus of human lactoferrin acts synergistically with an RKVR sequence at positions 28-31 to form the predominate functional GAG-binding site of human lactoferrin. Molecular modeling of the crystalline structure of lactoferrin supports a synergistic activity between these two sites since it shows that they juxtapose each other on the surface of the folded protein. Solid docking calculations indicate that they can form a cationic cradle as a binding site for chondroitin sulfate."

https://openalex.org/W2041918235,"Individual small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) U1, U2, and U4/U6 were removed from nuclear extracts of HeLa cells by antisense affinity depletion. Addition of a highly purified preparation of SR proteins fully restored splicing activity in reactions depleted of U1 snRNP but did not reconstitute splicing in reactions depleted of the other snRNPs. Affinity selection experiments revealed that spliceosomes lacking U1 snRNA formed in the U1 snRNP-depleted reactions reconstituted with SR proteins. Thus, high concentrations of SR proteins facilitate the assembly of precursor messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) into a spliceosome in the absence of interactions with U1 snRNP."
https://openalex.org/W1593864150,"The human p120 nucleolar protein is a cell cycle-related protein that peaks during the S phase and has been shown to be associated with a beaded fibrillar structure. To study domains responsible for the nucleolar localization of protein p120, initially deletion mutants were made that defined sequences containing the localization signals; then, fusion genes that were composed of segments of the p120 molecule joined to the N-terminal end of the Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase were constructed. In the absence of the localization signals the beta-galactosidase remained in the cytoplasm. When the identified nuclear localization signal containing the amino acid sequence 99-110 (NAPRGKKRPAPG) was fused to the beta-galactosidase, the protein localized to the nucleus. When only the identified nucleolar localization signal containing the amino acid sequence 40-57 (SKRLSSRARKRAAKRRLG) was fused to the beta-galactosidase, the fusion protein remained in the cytoplasm. When both the nuclear and nucleolar localization signals were fused to the beta-galactosidase it localized predominantly to the nucleolus. Nucleolar protein B23, a putative shuttle protein, bound to amino acid sequence 24-56 of protein p120. Deletion analysis showed that amino acids 187-215 of protein B23 bound to protein p120. The results suggest that protein B23 may be part of the mechanism of protein targeting to the nucleolus."
https://openalex.org/W1626287517,"A cytoplasmic membrane protein, p12, of Escherichia coli was discovered as a new factor that stimulates the protein translocation activity reconstituted with SecA, SecY, and SecE (Nishiyama, K., Mizushima, S., and Tokuda, H. (1993) EMBO J. 12, 3409-3415). Direct involvement of p12 in protein translocation was subsequently demonstrated in vivo by genetic studies, and the name SecG has been proposed for p12 (Nishiyama, K., Hanada, M., and Tokuda, H. (1994) EMBO J. 13, 3272-3277). To elucidate the role of SecG in protein translocation and to characterize the translocation apparatus comprising these four Sec proteins, the activity of reconstituted proteoliposomes was examined in detail as a function of the amount of each component. SecG markedly stimulated the translocation activity over wide ranges of amounts of the other three Sec proteins, indicating that none of the other three Sec proteins substitutes for the SecG function. Detailed kinetic analyses indicated that the activity of proteoliposomes was dependent on the amount of the SecY-SecE complex when SecG was absent and the amount of the SecY.SecE.SecG complex when the proteoliposomes contained SecG. The translocation activity of the latter complex was significantly higher than that of the former one. Binding of SecA to liposomes appreciably increased when they contained both SecY and SecE, whereas the further presence of SecG did not enhance the binding. On the other hand, the ATPase activity of SecA, which was dependent on proOmpA and SecY.SecE-containing proteoliposomes, was significantly enhanced when the proteoliposomes contained SecG. Taken together, these results indicate that SecG enhances the translocation activity of the apparatus after the step of SecA targeting to SecY.SecE."

https://openalex.org/W1616494231,"The glycoprotein (GP) Ib-IX complex is the receptor on platelet surfaces that mediates their adhesion to subendothelium. It comprises three polypeptides (GP Ib alpha, GP Ib beta, GP IX), each of which belongs to a superfamily of proteins containing conserved leucine-rich motifs. In this study, we used Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing every combination of two GP Ib-IX complex subunits to demonstrate that GP Ib beta plays an essential role in the synthesis of the heterotrimer by associating with both of the other two subunits. Confocal microscopy demonstrated that GP Ib beta was present in the same cellular locations as GP Ib alpha in CHO alpha beta cells (cells expressing only GP Ib alpha and GP Ib beta) and as GP IX in CHO beta IX cells. The two polypeptides expressed in CHO alpha IX cells did not co-localize. Association between GP Ib alpha and GP Ib beta was demonstrated biochemically on immunoblots of detergent lysates of CHO alpha beta cells; electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions revealed the two subunits to be covalently linked through a disulfide bond. Association of GP Ib alpha and GP Ib beta was further demonstrated by the finding that immunoprecipitations with antibodies against either polypeptide precipitated both. Similarly, immunoprecipitations of lysates of CHO beta IX cells with antibodies against GP Ib beta or GP IX precipitated both polypeptides. In contrast, co-immunoprecipitation of the two polypeptides expressed in CHO alpha IX cells could not be demonstrated. Transient expression in CHO cells of GP Ib beta with GP IX yielded higher GP IX levels on the cell membrane than did expression of GP IX alone; supertransfection of CHO alpha IX cells with GP Ib beta also increased GP IX levels on the cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W1655079079,"The Rac GTP-binding proteins regulate the actin cytoskeleton and the superoxide-forming NADPH oxidase of phagocytic leukocytes. These functions of Rac are determined by the GTP/GDP state of the protein, which can be modulated by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). The interaction of Ras with both downstream signaling targets and GAPs is mediated via an domain (amino acids 30-40). We demonstrate that the effector domain of Rac2 is required for both NADPH oxidase activation and actin assembly, but that mutations in this region do not decrease the responsiveness of Rac to GAPs. In contrast, mutations of residues 12 (Gly-->Val) or 61 (Gln-->Leu) inhibit both intrinsic- and GAP-stimulated GTP hydrolysis by Rac2. A double mutation in which both the effector domain and Q61L were modified restored NADPH oxidase activation and membrane ruffling, while the equivalent effector domain and G12V double mutation did not. The Rac2 Q61L mutant had an increased affinity for NADPH oxidase activation and for GAP binding as compared to the wild type or G12V proteins. These experiments suggest that Rac contains at least two interaction sites, and that changes in binding interactions at one of these sites may influence the function of the other."
https://openalex.org/W1490915687,"The effects of a number of metabolic inhibitors on the influx of Ca2+ activated by stimulation of receptors coupled to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate generation or by depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores with thapsigargin were investigated in four different cell types: Ehrlich ascites tumor cells, Jurkat and HeLa cell lines, and rat hepatocytes. Independently of their chemical structure and site of inhibition, all of these metabolic poisons markedly inhibited Ca2+ influx without significantly affecting Ca2+ release. This inhibition was not due to membrane potential depolarization or to alteration in cytosolic pH but appeared correlated to a drop in the cellular concentration of ATP. The decreases in cellular [ATP] were paralleled by decreases in [GTP] and by increases in [ADP] and [GDP]. The reduction in ATP level necessary to drastically reduce Ca2+ influx was quite small, e.g. a 50% inhibition for a 5% reduction in [ATP], thus within the range of fluctuation presumably occurring under physiological conditions. We suggest that changes in the adenine or guanine nucleotide concentrations may represent an important modulatory mechanism of Ca2+ influx activated by store depletion."
https://openalex.org/W1985388319,"Two heterologous prokaryotic activators, the bacteriophage λcI protein (λcI) and the Escherichia coli cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP), were shown to activate transcription synergistically from an artificial promoter bearing binding sites for both proteins. The synergy depends on a functional activation (positive control) surface on each activator. These results imply that both proteins interact directly with RNA polymerase and thus suggest a precise mechanism for transcriptional synergy: the interaction of two activators with two distinct surfaces of RNA polymerase."
https://openalex.org/W2069606832,"Studies of the development of murine intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) have yielded markedly different results depending on the experimental system used. In athymic radiation chimeras, IELs consist of all subsets found in euthymic mice; adult mice that were athymic at birth have only IELs that are positive for T cell receptor γδ and CD8αα. These differences are resolved by the finding that administration of the neuropeptide thyrotropin-releasing hormone to adult mice thymectomized as neonates leads to the development of all IEL T cells. Thus, a neuroendocrine signal initiated by the thymus during fetal or neonatal life appears to be required for subsequent extrathymic maturation of gut αβ T cells."
https://openalex.org/W1508217034,"NMR spectroscopy and selective isotope labeling of both recombinant cardiac troponin C (cTnC3) and a truncated cardiac troponin I (cTnI/NH2) lacking the N-terminal 32-amino acid cardiac-specific sequence have been used to probe protein-protein interactions central to muscle contraction. Using [methyl-13C]Met-labeled cTnC3, all 10 cTnC Met residues of Ca(2+)-saturated cTnC3 could be resolved in the two-dimensional heteronuclear single- and multiple-quantum coherence spectrum of the cTnI.cTnC complex. Based on the known Met assignments in cTnC3, the largest chemical shift changes were observed for Met81, Met120, Met137, and Met157. Methionines 120, 137, and 157 are all located in the C-terminal domain of cTnC. Methionine 81 is located at the N terminus of the central helix. Minimal chemical shift changes were observed for Met45, Met47, and Met103 of cTnC3 in the cTnI.cTnC complex. All 6 Met residues in [methyl13C]Met-labeled cTnI/NH2 could be resolved in the cTnI.cTnC complex, suggesting that both cTnI and cTnC form a stable homogeneous binary complex under the conditions of the NMR experiment. In the absence of added protease inhibitors in the cTnI.cTnC complex, cTnI/NH2 was found to undergo selective proteolysis to yield a 5.5-kDa N-terminal fragment corresponding to residues 33-80. Judging from the NMR spectra of [methyl13C]Met-labeled cTnC3, cTnI-(33-80) was sufficient for interaction with the C-terminal domain of cTnC in a manner identical to that observed for native cTnI/NH2. However, in the presence of the proteolytic fragment cTnI-(33-80), the chemical shift of Met81 was not perturbed from its position in free cTnC3. Thus, residues located C-terminal to Arg80 in cTnI appear to be responsible for interaction with the N-terminal half of cTnC. Taken together, these results provide strong evidence for an antiparallel arrangement for the two proteins in the troponin complex such that the N-terminal portion of cTnI interacts with the C-terminal domain of cTnC. This interaction likely plays a role in maintaining the stability of the TnI.TnC complex."
https://openalex.org/W1547461551,"In an earlier subcellular fractionation study of epithelial tissue (liver and pancreas), we demonstrated that the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) is found in association with biochemically distinct cellular membranes, including the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and plasma membrane (Sharp, A. H., Snyder, S. H., and Nigam, S. K. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 7444-7449). To further characterize epithelial IP3Rs, we have now employed cultured Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, a well studied tight polarized epithelial cell type. Indirect immunofluorescence with an antiserum which specifically recognizes IP3R in MDCK cells by immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation gave an ER-like staining pattern as well as a basolateral plasma membrane-like staining pattern, the latter being particularly evident in highly confluent monolayers. In sections of adult rat kidney tubules a similar staining pattern was observed. Interestingly, whereas known basolateral proteins (Na+,K(+)-ATPase and the facilitated glucose transporter) gave a continuous basolateral staining pattern, that seen for IP3R was discontinuous (punctate). A highly similar staining pattern was observed for the caveolar protein, caveolin, suggesting that the punctate basolateral plasma membrane-like staining pattern observed for IP3R reflects its localization to basolateral caveolae. Biotinylation of non-permeabilized and permeabilized MDCK cells, followed by immunoprecipitation of IP3R and detection with streptavidin, indicated that while most IP3R is localized to biotin-inaccessible compartments (i.e. ER), a fraction (10-20%) of IP3R was accessible to externally added biotin primarily from the basolateral side. This result is compatible with the dual ER and basolateral caveolar localization suggested by immunocytochemistry, although it does not exclude the presence of some IP3R in the basolateral plasma membrane as well. Solubility studies revealed IP3R to be considerably more insoluble than the basolateral proteins, Na+,K(+)-ATPase and the liver cell adhesion molecule, as well as the cytoskeletal proteins, ankyrin and fodrin. In the most insoluble fraction, IP3R was found along with caveolin, further supporting the notion that part of the cellular IP3R pool associates with caveolae. Since multiple localizations of IP3R within a cell might reflect the existence of multiple isoforms, polymerase chain reaction amplification of first strand cDNA with primers specific for the three isotypes of IP3R was performed. All three isoforms of IP3R were expressed in the homogeneous population of MDCK cells. The existence of distinct membrane localizations and multiple isoforms of IP3R within the same cell type suggests an explanation for the complex spatiotemporal patterns of Ca2+ release from inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-sensitive Ca2+ pools in epithelial and other cells."
https://openalex.org/W2157265748,"Polysialic acid (PSA) is an unusual homopolymer of sialic acid (Sia) found on a limited number of animal glycoproteins and in the capsules of certain pathogenic bacteria. The biological properties of PSA are known to vary markedly with the length of the polymer. We confirm here that while the primary linkage unit of PSA (Sia alpha 2-8Sia) is more stable than commoner Sia linkages, PSA with > 3 Sia units is substantially more labile. A ""limit digest"" of PSA yields fragments of degree of polymerization (DP) = 2 and 3 and little monomeric Sia. In keeping with this, the fragmentation of PSA of DP 4 is non-random, with the internal glycosidic bond being more labile than those at the two ends. The accelerated breakdown of PSA involves an intramolecular mechanism that is not explained by lactone formation, cation effects, or specific secondary structural features. However, it is dependent upon the intactness of internal carboxyl groups, which have an anomalously high pKa. Thus, the instability of PSA appears to result from intramolecular self-cleavage of the glycosidic bonds of internal Sia units, in which the adjacent carboxyl group with a high pKa acts as a proton donor for general acid catalysis. This lability of PSA is seen under mildly acidic conditions that can be encountered in various physiological and pathological situations and thus has potential implications for neuronal adhesion, embryogenesis, and bacterial pathogenicity."
https://openalex.org/W1622053312,"Signal transduction by dioxin is mediated by the intracellular basic helix-loop-helix dioxin receptor which, in its ligand-activated state, binds to target DNA as a heteromeric complex with the partner factor Arnt. In contrast, the repressed form of the receptor is a complex with hsp90 which appears to maintain the receptor in an inducible conformation. In human keratinocytes dioxin receptor activation has previously been shown to depend on phosphorylation processes. To further dissect mechanisms regulating dioxin receptor function the importance of tyrosine phosphorylation was investigated by the use of specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Here we report that the inhibitor genistein inhibited dioxin-dependent induction of expression of the target gene cytochrome P-450IA1. This effect was rapid and reversible and did not lead to altered levels of dioxin receptor protein. Analyses of dioxin receptor or Arnt fusion proteins that function independently of one another showed that the target for genistein action was the dioxin receptor, and, more specifically, a region of the receptor harboring its ligand-binding domain. In addition, function of an unrelated transactivator, the glucocorticoid receptor, was inhibited by genistein while a truncated form lacking the ligand-binding domain was not. A common denominator between the ligand-binding domains of both receptors is their ability to interact with hsp90. Importantly, co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that genistein inhibited ligand-induced release of hsp90 from the glucocorticoid receptor. Thus, the interaction of these transactivators with hsp90 may be regulated by a tyrosine kinase-dependent pathway."

Phosphorylation of FixJ was previously demonstrated to dramatically enhance its transcriptional activity at the nifA and fixK promoters. Here we show that the isolated carboxyl-terminal domain of FixJ, FixJC, binds the fixK promoter, whereas binding of the full-length FixJ protein requires its phosphorylation. By analyzing the DNase I and Exonuclease III protection patterns of the wild-type and a mutant fixK promoter, we have identified two overlapping binding regions for both phosphorylated FixJ and FixJC. A higher affinity region is located between positions -69 and -44 relative to the transcription start site, and a lower affinity region, between positions -57 and -31, overlaps the -35 region of the promoter."
https://openalex.org/W1606837110,"In ram spermatozoa, treatment with the ionophore A23187 and Ca2+ led to an increase in total diacylglycerol mass and to exocytosis of the acrosomal granule. If sperm cells were prelabeled with [3H]palmitic acid, stimulation with A23187/Ca2+ resulted in the generation of [3H]diacylglycerols with a mixture of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. When cells were prelabeled with 1-O-[3H]octadecylglycerophosphocholine, stimulation led to the generation of [3H]alkylacylglycerol. No rise in [3H]diacyl- or [3H]alkylacylphosphatidic acid was detected under these conditions. Moreover, no changes in the mass of phosphatidic acid have been previously noted under similar conditions. Thus, these results indicate that diradylglycerols are generated via phospholipase C (PLC). Increases in diradylglycerols were paralleled by rises in monoacyl- or monoalkylglycerols labeled at position 1, but not in free [3H]palmitic acid or [3H]octadecanol, implying that, unlike somatic cells, spermatozoa catabolize diradylglycerols via a 2-diglyceride lipase. Activation of PLC appears to be effected by phosphoinositide-derived diacylglycerol: exposure to Mg2+, a cation known to inhibit phosphoinositide hydrolysis, resulted in less PLC activity upon stimulation, and addition of exogenous 1,2-diacylglycerols enhanced the enzyme's activity. However, 1,3-diacylglycerol and alkylacylglycerol also stimulated PLC activity, suggesting that the effect is unlikely to be mediated via protein kinase C. Since diradylglycerols are known to be essential in the molecular sequence leading to membrane fusion in mammalian spermatozoa, these results suggest that their generation via PLC constitutes a fundamental event during acrosomal exocytosis in response to physiological agonists."
https://openalex.org/W1527021271,"Acyloxyacyl hydrolase, a leukocyte enzyme that acts on bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) and many glycerolipids, is synthesized as a precursor polypeptide that undergoes internal disulfide linkage before being proteolytically processed into two subunits. The larger subunit contains an amino acid sequence (Gly-X-Ser-X-Gly) that is found at the active sites of many lipases, while the smaller subunit has amino acid sequence similarity to saposins (sphingolipid activator proteins), cofactors for sphingolipid glycohydrolases. We show here that both acyloxyacyl hydrolase subunits are required for catalytic activity toward LPS and glycerophosphatidylcholine. In addition, mutations that truncate or delete the small subunit have profound effects on the intracellular localization, proteolytic processing, and stability of the enzyme in baby hamster kidney cells. Remarkably, proteolytic cleavage of the precursor protein increases the activity of the enzyme toward LPS by 10-20-fold without altering its activity toward glycerophosphatidylcholine. Proper orientation of the two subunits thus seems very important for the substrate specificity of this unusual enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1516890768,"Abstract Two beta-glucuronidase-deficient Mennonite siblings were found to be homozygous for a mutation in exon 3 of the beta-glucuronidase gene that produces a Leu-->Phe substitution (L176F). The siblings also have the previously described benign polymorphism, P649L. Although their cultured fibroblasts contained 1.5-2.2% of normal beta-glucuronidase activity, transient expression of the L176F/P649L cDNA in COS cells produced nearly as much enzyme activity as the wild-type control cDNA. The L176F/P649L enzyme was as stable as wild-type enzyme following endocytosis by fibroblasts and delivery to lysosomes, but was more labile to heat inactivation at 65 degrees C. To study the mutant enzyme at lower levels of expression, we stably transfected mouse mucopolysaccharidosis type VII cells with the L176F/P649L cDNA and selected single-copy cell lines. Metabolic labeling with [35S]methionine revealed that cell lines expressing the mutant enzyme activity at low levels (7-10% of the wild type) actually produced the same amount of enzyme protein as the cell lines expressing the more active wild-type enzyme. However, the cell lines expressing four times this much mutant enzyme protein produced 150-200% as much enzyme activity as the cell line expressing the single-copy wild-type cDNA. These data suggest that overexpression can drive the folding reaction or the self-association of mutant monomers to form active tetramers and, at least partially, correct the beta-glucuronidase deficiency seen at low levels of expression with certain missense mutations."
https://openalex.org/W1525566025,"Activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) was examined in the A7r5 rat vascular smooth muscle cell line. Treatment of A7r5 cells with vasopressin, phorbol ester (PMA), or serum resulted in activation of two MAPKs, Erk-1 and Erk-2. Phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C was activated in response to vasopressin but not to PMA. Vasopressin and PMA both caused maximal activation of PLD within 5 minutes. Application of bacterial phospholipase D (PLD) to A7r5 cells increased phosphatidic acid to levels similar to those seen with vasopressin or PMA. Acute exposure of the cells to vasopressin, PMA, or PLD increased phosphorylation of many of the same cytosolic and membrane proteins. However, bacterial PLD did not promote significant activation of Erk-1 and Erk-2. Phosphatidic acid and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) likewise did not stimulate MAPK activity in A7r5 cells. Serum and vasopressin stimulated DNA synthesis when present for more than 30 min, while PLD, PMA, phosphatidic acid, and LPA were not mitogenic. These data suggest that activations of MAPKs and PLD are concurrent but independent responses to vasopressin in A7r5 cells. Acute activation of these enzymes is not sufficient to simulate DNA synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1563241689,"The involvement of exon sequences in splice site selection was studied in vivo in HeLa cells transfected with a series of model three exon-two intron pre-mRNAs which differed only in the sequence of their internal exons. When the majority of the human globin-derived 175-nucleotide internal exon (DUP175) was replaced with a sequence from the yeast URA3 gene (DUP184), the splicing pathway changed from complete inclusion of the internal exon in DUP175 to its predominant skipping in the DUP184 construct. Skipping of the exon was reversed by increasing the strength of its flanking splicing elements indicating that exon sequences exert their effect only in the presence of relatively weak splicing signals. A series of block mutations in the internal exon of DUP184 showed that a stretch of 6 cytidine nucleotides increased the inclusion of the DUP184 internal exon about 7-fold. Mutations generating purine-rich sequences (AAG and GAAG) at the 3' end of the exon led to complete exon inclusion while stepwise insertion of sequences from the internal exon of DUP175 into the DUP184 background increased exon inclusion 5-fold. Combination of the stretch of cytidines with sequences derived from DUP175 exon resulted in complete exon inclusion indicating that diverse signals within exons may cooperate with each other in affecting splice site selection."

https://openalex.org/W1652942959,"Lipoprotein lipase (LPL)-binding heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) were isolated from cell extracts and conditioned media of cultured adipocytes treated with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PIPLC). The methodology employed included anion exchange chromatography, affinity chromatography on LPL Affi-Prep 10 and hydrophobic chromatography. HSPGs were resolved into two distinct fractions on the Octyl-Sepharose CL-4B matrix. Treatment of the eluted fractions with heparinase and heparitinase yielded core proteins of 48.4 and 39 kDa. The 39-kDa core protein is anchored to the cell surface by a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol anchor as evidenced by 1) release of the HSPG with the 39-kDa core protein into media by PIPLC treatment and 2) biosynthetic incorporation of [3H]ethanolamine and [32P]orthophosphate into the PIPLC-releasable 39-kDa core protein. PIPLC released 23% of the total heparin-releasable LPL. A similar percentage (24.5%) of the total heparan sulfate chains was released by PIPLC. Over 96% of the total adipocyte heparan sulfate chains bound to LPL Affi-Prep 10 column. The heterogeneity of core proteins of HSPGs with affinity for LPL may provide a structural basis for the multiple fates of LPL on the surface of adipocytes, i.e. internalization, degradation, or recycling to the cell surface and translocation into the medium."
https://openalex.org/W1496686664,"Initiation of DNA replication and negative control of initiation frequency in many bacterial plasmids are mediated by multiple binding sites (iterons) for the replicon-encoded initiator protein. Here we show that a single iteron of plasmid P1, when cloned in a multicopy vector, pUC19, can control replication of a miniP1 plasmid effectively. Using this assay system, several iterons with single point mutations were analyzed. The degree of control was directly correlated with the binding affinity of the iterons for the initiator protein in vitro. The control was also unaffected whether or not a wild type iteron was flanked with strong transcription terminators. We conclude that initiator binding is the only activity of P1 iteron sequences relevant to replication control."
https://openalex.org/W1560178275,"GLUT4, the major insulin-responsive glucose transporter isoform in rat adipocytes, rapidly recycles between an intracellular pool and the plasma membrane in the basal and insulin-stimulated states. To gain insight into the route of this GLUT4 recycling, we studied the effects of brefeldin A (BFA) on glucose transport and glucose transporter subcellular distribution in rat adipocytes in the absence and in the presence of insulin. 3-O-Methyl-D-glucose equilibrium exchange measurements revealed that BFA inhibits insulin-stimulated glucose transport by as much as 80%, whereas the inactive BFA analog, B36, was without effect. The inhibition was reversible and was a saturable function of BFA concentration with an apparent Ki of less than 1 microM. In the absence of insulin, on the other hand, BFA caused a slight (up to 2-fold) increase in glucose transport. Subcellular fractionation and semiquantitative immunoblotting analysis revealed that BFA inhibits insulin-induced redistribution of GLUT4 from microsomes to the plasma membranes, with a dose dependence similar to that for glucose transport inhibition. BFA also caused a slight increase in the plasma membrane GLUT4 level in the absence of insulin. BFA did not affect the subcellular distribution of GLUT1 in these experiments. These findings strongly suggest that GLUT4 recycling in rat adipocytes involves a BFA-sensitive, coat protein-mediated, membrane-budding step, which is distinct between the constitutive and the insulin-induced pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1579713959,"A novel membrane-bound polyphosphoinositide phosphatase has been purified 7700-fold from rat brain. A combination of gel filtration chromatography and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicated that the enzyme is a monomer with a molecular weight of 85,000-90,000. Biochemical analysis of the polyphosphoinositide phosphatase demonstrated that the enzyme utilizes phosphatidylinositol(4)phosphate (PtdIns(4)P), phosphatidylinositol(3)phosphate (PtdIns(3)P), and phosphatidylinositol (4,5)bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) as substrates. In the case of PtdIns(4,5)P2, the substrate is doubly dephosphorylated to yield PtdIns. The apparent Km values for PtdIns(4)P and PtdIns(4,5)P2 are 45 and 5 microM, respectively. Inositol(1,4)bisphosphate and inositol(1,4,5)trisphosphate neither serve as direct substrates for the polyphosphoinositide phosphatase nor inhibit its activity even at concentrations as high as 100 microM. Thus, the substrate specificity of the polyphosphoinositide phosphatase is distinct from that of previously identified phosphatases that utilize both inositol phospholipids and soluble inositol phosphates as substrates. The ability of the polyphosphoinositide phosphatase to hydrolyze phosphate from the 3-, 4-, or 5-position of the inositol ring suggests that this enzyme may play a key role in maintaining homeostasis among all forms of polyphosphoinositides."

https://openalex.org/W1605360449,"cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) is an important participant in neuronal modulation: the ability of neurons to change their properties in response to external stimuli. In Aplysia mechanosensory neurons, PKA plays roles in both short and long term presynaptic facilitation, which is a simple model for learning and memory. PKA in Aplysia is a collection of structurally and functionally diverse regulatory and catalytic (C) subunits. We have argued that this diversity may in part account for the ability of the enzyme to take part in neuronal events that are spatially and temporally separated. Here, we add credence to this hypothesis by showing that C subunits of Aplysia PKA with alternative N termini target different substrates in subcellular fractions from Aplysia neurons, despite their similar actions on synthetic peptide substrates. Purified recombinant CAPL-AN1A1, which has an N terminus that is homologous to the myristylated sequence described in mammals, catalyzes the formation of two phosphoproteins of 24 and 8 kDa more rapidly than CAPL-AN2A1, which has a distinct N terminus weakly related to that of the yeast TPK1 gene product. The 24-kDa phospoprotein, but not the 8-kDa species, is detected in taxol-stabilized microtubules, suggesting that it is associated with the cytoskeleton. CAPL-AN2A1, in contrast, generates a 55-kDa phosphoprotein that is not observed with CAPL-AN1A1. The 55-kDa species is found in the detergent supernatant of the cytoskeleton fraction. Differential targeting of substrates by C subunits of PKA may therefore contribute to the ability of this kinase to play multiple roles in neuronal modulation."
