https://openalex.org/W1589645365,"Abstract Bovine heart cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cAMP) phosphodiesterase requires a heat-stable protein activator for full enzymic activity. Enzyme preparations, largely freed of the protein activator, possess low enzyme activity which is independent of Ca2+. Addition of excess protein activator stimulates the enzyme activity 6- to 10-fold. This activation by the protein activator is shown to be completely dependent on the presence of low concentrations of Ca2+. The concentration of Ca2+ required to give 50% of the maximal activation is 2.3 µm. An equilibrium binding study has shown that 45Ca binds to the protein activator. A Scatchard plot exhibits two linear regions suggesting the presence of two sets of Ca2+ binding sites on the protein with different affinities: one high affinity site and two low affinity sites per protein activator. The dissociation constants for Ca2+ bound at the high and low affinity sites are 3 and 12 µm, respectively. The results suggest that the complex of Ca2+ and the protein activator is the true activator for cAMP phosphodiesterase."
https://openalex.org/W1552595500,"Abstract The kinetics of the reduction by dithionite of several biochemically interesting substances has been investigated under anaerobic conditions by stopped flow spectrophotometry at pH 8.0 and 25°. Solutions of sodium dithionite were prepared and standardized by titration against lumiflavin 3-acetate in the absence of oxygen. Under pseudo-first order conditions (dithionite in excess) the reactions of spinach ferredoxin, horse metmyoglobin, lumiflavin 3-acetate, horse heart ferricytochrome c, and spinach plastocyanin conform to first order kinetics for several half-lives. Dependence of the observed pseudo-first order rate constant (kobs) on the dithionite concentration is described by the equation, kobs = a[S2O42-]½, where a = 8.6, 100, and 960 m-½ s-1 for ferredoxin, metmyoglobin, and lumiflavin 3-acetate, respectively. These results support a mechanism involving SO2- as the kinetically important reducing species. With cytochome c and plastocyanin, the dependence of kobs on dithionite concentration is described by the equation, kobs = a[S2O42-]½ + b[S2O42-], where a and b are 1450 m-½ s-1 and 1.5 x 104 m-1 s-1 in the case of cytochrome c and 1100 m-½ s-1 and 1.35 x 105 m-1 s-1 in the case of plastocyanin. These two proteins apparently react with both SO2- and S2O42-. Analysis of the reaction of cytochrome c with dithionite in the presence of oxygen gave an estimated rate constant of 47 m-½ s-1 for the oxygen-dithionite reaction. The rate constant of the reaction of ferricyanide with S2O42- is 1.4 x 105 m-1 s-1. Evidence is presented that ferricyanide also reacts rapidly with SO2-. When dithionite reacts with excess ferricytochome c, lumiflavin 3-acetate, or oxygen, the reaction rate is virtually independent of the oxidant concentration and a limiting first order rate constant of 1.7 s-1 is approached in each case. This rate constant has been assigned to the monomerization rate of S2O42-, and its temperature dependence gives an activation energy of 24.1 Cal per mole for the dissociation of S2O42-. Determination of the equilibrium constant (K) for the reaction S2O42- ⇌ 2SO2- by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy has given a value of 1.4 ± 0.4 x 10-9 m. Dividing the above listed values of a by K½ gives the absolute rate constants for the reactions between SO2- and oxidants."

An important clinical implication is that patients complaining only of insomnia may be suffering from this syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W1506942093,"Abstract In rat ventral prostate the action of many natural androgens, including testosterone, appears to depend on their conversion to 5α-dihydrotestosterone that binds firmly to an androgen receptor (β protein) and is subsequently retained by cell nuclei. We have found, however, that many potent synthetic androgens can bind directly to β protein and to prostate cell nuclei without a metabolic conversion. For these studies, simple methods were devised to compare the receptor binding affinities of various androgenic steroids. These methods are especially useful if test compounds are available only in minute quantities (l1 µg). In general, the correlation between the relative competition indices of various synthetic androgens determined by these procedures and the relative androgenicities of these androgens was very good. This supports the concept that the β protein and nuclear binding of androgens play important roles in androgen actions in ventral prostates. Most of the highly active synthetic androgens that could bind to β protein were Δ4-3-ketosteroids without an angular methyl group at C-10. Since they can bind to β protein tightly, their androgen action may bypass the action of Δ4-3-ketosteroid-5α-oxidoreductase that appears to be necessary for the action of testosterone. These findings, together with molecular model building, indicate that the bulkiness and flatness of the steroid molecule play a more important role in receptor binding than the detailed electronic structure at the Δ4 bond of Ring A. For example, potent androgens with conjugated double bonds extending from Rings A and B to C (such as 2-oxa-17α-methyl-17β-hydroxy-estra-4,9,11-triene-3-one and 17α-methyl-17β-hydroxy-estra-4,9,11-triene-3-one) are indeed very flat molecules and bind to the androgen receptor firmly. Substitution of a 7α-methyl group in 17β-hydroxyestr-4-en-3-one (19-nortestosterone) or its 17α-methyl derivative enhanced the androgenic activities of the parent compounds as well as their ability to bind to β protein and to prostate cell nuclei. Thus, 7α, 17α-dimethyl-19-nortestosterone had an apparent affinity for βprotein several times higher than that of 5α-dihydrotestosterone. A tritiated form of 7α, 17α-dimethyl-19-nortestosterone was also used to show its binding to β protein and to prostate cell nuclei. The tritiated androgen appeared to be very stable to metabolic conversion in prostate tissue. Notably, it was not reduced by prostate Δ4-3-ketosteroid-5α-oxidoreductase."
https://openalex.org/W1592059338,"Abstract A plasma membrane fraction was prepared from pig kidney medulla. It contained lysine-vasopressin-sensitive adenylate cyclase activity (maximum activation: 4- to 6-fold, apparent Km value for the hormone: about 5 x 10-9 m). Lysine-vasopressin was not inactivated by the membrane preparation even at low hormonal concentrations. The specific [3H]lysine-vasopressin (vasopressin) binding sites found are probably involved in adenylate cyclase activation; binding occurred in a concentration range giving dose-dependent activation of the adenylate cyclase. Relative affinities of vasopressin, oxytocin, (O-methyl)-tyrosine2-oxytocin and angiotensin (vasopressin g oxytocin g (O-Me)-Tyr2-oxy g angiotensin) for binding and adenylate cyclase activation were similar. Nonspecific binding, i.e. binding which could not be inhibited by 10-5 m unlabeled vasopressin, represented 12.5% of the specific binding at 10-8 m [3H]vasopressin. For all hormonal concentrations, [3H]vasopressin binding increased with time up to an equilibrium value. The binding was reversible. The time course of hormone-receptor complex formation was highly temperature- and hormone concentration-dependent. Dissociation and association rate constants at 30° varied from 0.02 to 0.088 min-1 for k-1, and from 1.3 x 10+7 to 3.0 x 10+7 m-1 min-1 for k1. For the same enzyme preparation, the k-1:k1 ratio was very close to the value deduced from the hormonal concentration giving half the maximum binding at equilibrium. When adenylate cyclase activation was measured as a function of time after the addition of hormone, activation was found to be progressive. The time required to reach maximum activation is similar to that needed to reach an equilibrium value for [3H]vasopressin binding at the same concentration. These data suggest that adenylate cyclase activation is a function of receptor occupancy. Reversal of adenylate cyclase activation was also progressive. When adenylate cyclase activation at equilibrium was measured for different values of receptor occupancy, it was found that for the same increment in receptor occupancy, the increment in adenylate cyclase activation drops as total receptor occupancy increases."
https://openalex.org/W1585454793,"A comparative study of the resonance Raman spectra of a number of hemoproteins with excitation in the Soret region reveals features that characterize the valence and spin state of the iron. (a) The frequency of the strongest band in the spectra for reduced (ferrous) hemoproteins always occurs between 1356 and 1361 cm-1, whereas for oxidized (ferric) proteins it occurs between 1370 and 1378 cm-1. (b) In all cases studied there is a band in the conjugated double bond stretching region, with principal component at 1584 and 1566 cm-1 for the low and high spin configurations, respectively. Since the strongest band of oxyhemoglobin occurs at 1375 cm-1 and the 1584 cm-1 band dominates the conjugated double bond stretching region, the present results strongly support the assignment of a low spin ferric structure to the iron ion in oxyhemoglobin."

https://openalex.org/W1484498866,"Abstract It has previously been postulated from studies conducted under in vivo conditions (Tsai, H. C., Wong, R. G., and Norman, A. W. (1972) J. Biol. Chem. 247, 5728–5735) that there may be a cause-and-effect relationship between the appearance of the calciferol (vitamin D) metabolite, 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol in the intestinal chromatin fraction, and the initiation of the physiological responses attributed to calciferol in this target tissue. The present report describes efforts to study via in vitro techniques the properties, specificity, and requirements of an intestinal homogenate system capable of effecting the localization of 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol in the intestinal chromatin fraction. Incubation of intestinal homogenates in 0.25 m sucrose, 0.02 m KCl, 0.05 m MgCl2, and 0.05 m Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, with 32 to 325 pmoles of 1,25-dihydroxy[3H]cholecalciferol at 0–4° for 30 min resulted in the saturation of the subsequently isolated chromatin fraction at a level of 6.2 pmoles of steroid per chick intestinal chromatin. Previous experiments (Tsai, H. C., Wong, R. C., and Norman, A. W. (1972) J. Biol. Chem. 247, 5728–5735) where 1,25-dihydroxy[3H]cholecalciferol was given intracardially to a cholecalciferol-deficient chick resulted in the binding of 5.2 pmoles of steroid per chick intestinal chromatin fraction. Under identical conditions in vitro only 1.4 pmoles of cholecalciferol, 2.0 pmoles of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol, or 0.3 pmole of estradiol were bound to the intestinal chromatin fraction. Evidence was obtained for the mandatory binding of the 1,25-dihydroxy[3H]cholecalciferol to a cytoplasmic receptor protein prior to the association of this steroid with the intestinal chromatin fraction. The intestinal cytoplasmic receptor was judged to be a macromolecule on the basis of its migration in a sucrose gradient, gel filtration chromatography, and a protein on the basis of its sensitivity to treatment with Pronase, but not RNase or DNase, its heat lability, and its precipitability by ammonium sulfate. The cytoplasmic receptor was highly specific for the binding and transfer of 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol to the intestinal chromatin fraction; only a 250-fold excess of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol, but not cholecalciferol, 5,6-trans-cholecalciferol, or dihydrotachysterol effected a significant (50%) reduction of the chromatin localization of 1,25-dihydroxy-[3H]cholecalciferol. Evidence was also obtained from a tissue specificity both for the cytoplasmic receptor and the chromatin binding. Neither liver, kidney, or spleen cytosol were able to transfer effectively 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol to intestinal chromatin, nor were liver or kidney nuclei able to accept the steroid from the intestinal cytosol receptor. These results describing the in vitro conditions which permit the sequential binding of 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol to first a cytoplasmic and then a nuclear receptor are analogous both to the results obtained in vivo with this steroid and to those reported to occur under in vivo and in vitro conditions for many other steroid hormones."
https://openalex.org/W1488766752,"Abstract 1. Cytochrome oxidase was combined with a hydrophobic protein fraction derived from bovine heart mitochondria in the presence of cytochrome c, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and sodium cholate. After removal of cholate by dialysis and of external cytochrome c by washing, the vesicles were combined with coupling factors. The reconstituted vesicles catalyzed oxidative phosphorylation in the presence of ascorbate plus N-methylphenazinium methyl sulfate with a P:O ratio between 0.25 and 0.5. 2. For optimal activity the ratios of the protein and of the phospholipid components were critical. Excess cytochrome oxidase or cytochrome c yielded vesicles with a low P:O ratio. The ratio of cholate to phospholipids and the proportions of individual phospholipids also influenced the effectiveness of reconstitution. With purified phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine a ratio of 1:4 was optimal. At a ratio of 1:1 the rate of phosphorylation was low but was markedly increased when cardiolipin was added to the phospholipid mixture. 3. Synthetic phospholipids replaced the natural phospholipids even when they contained unnatural side chains. With synthetic phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine the P:O ratio was lower and optimal conditions were different from those used with natural phospholipids. 4. The reconstituted vesicles oxidized both external and internal ferrocytochrome c. Removal of external cytochrome c was essential for effective coupled phosphorylation. In the presence of external ferrocytochrome c the P:O ratio as well as the net rate of phosphorylation was depressed. This uncoupling effect by external cytochrome c was not observed with submitochondrial particles. It appears therefore that in contrast to the membrane of mitochondria and of submitochondrial particles, which are asymmetrical, the reconstituted particles exhibit symmetrical features of assembly. Asymmetry, required for phosphorylation, was only induced by removal of external cytochrome c."
https://openalex.org/W1589976215,"Abstract The rapid anaerobic reduction of xanthine oxidase by substrate has been studied using rapid freeze electron paramagnetic resonance, stopped flow spectrophotometry, and steady state kinetic analyses. Four major points have been resolved. The two types of molybdenum EPR signals which appear in the rapid phases of reduction are interconvertible by a prototopic equilibrium. The rapid optical bleaching which occurs during reduction has identical kinetics to the appearance of the non-heme iron-sulfur group signals determined by rapid freeze EPR studies. This rate of reduction is identical to the Vmax determined by steady state kinetic analysis implying that the oxygen independent steps must be rate limiting during catalysis. There are significant deuterium kinetic isotope effects on all of the EPR-detectable species as well as specific deuterium effects on the line shape of the molybdenum EPR spectrum. These are strong pieces of evidence that substrates transfer a hydride ion to molybdenum in the course of reducing the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1552439704,"Abstract Luteinizing hormone binding sites with high affinity and specificity for ovine-luteinizing hormone have been shown to be present in a purified plasma membrane preparation obtained from bovine corpus luteum. The specific binding of 125I-luteinizing hormone to the membranes is a saturable process with respect to 125I-luteinizing hormone. Native luteinizing hormone competes for the binding in a way expected from the biological identity of the 2 molecules. Human chorionic gonadotropin and pregnant mare serum gonadotropin, two gonadotropins which have luteinizing hormone activity, compete for the binding site of luteinizing hormone, with an affinity which is less than that of native luteinizing hormone. The same holds for the α and β chains of luteinizing hormone which showed, respectively, 100 and 200 times less affinity than luteinizing hormone for its binding site. Follicle-stimulating hormone, which does not have intrinsic luteinizing hormone activity, does not compete for the binding site of luteinizing hormone to an extent greater than its contamination by luteinizing hormone allows. The binding of 125I-luteinizing hormone is temperature-dependent and reaches its maximum in 10 min at 37°. The rate constant of the luteinizing hormone-membrane association (2.17 x 106 m-1 s-1) and dissociation (2.46 x 10-3 s-1) have been measured independently at 23 and 10°. The dissociation constant (1.13 x 10-9 m) based on these rate constants is similar to that (3 x 10-9 m) calculated separately from equilibrium data. Measurement of the rate constants at various temperatures gives similar values for the dissociation constant. This shows that the decrease in dissociation rate is proportionately the same as the decrease in association rate. Binding is maximal at pH 7.6 and is not affected by Ca2+ concentration in the range of 0.1 to 20 mm. The effects of different enzymatic preparations on the binding site of luteinizing hormone have been investigated. It is not affected by DNase, trypsin, chymotrypsin, pepsin, and collagenase. Treatment of the membrane preparations by neuraminidase increased the binding capacity for luteinizing hormone by 2-fold. Phospholipase C, as well as phospholipase A, decreases it by half."
https://openalex.org/W1758769421,"Abstract In cell-free systems, glucocorticoid receptor-dexamethasone complexes from hepatoma tissue culture (HTC) cells bind to HTC cell nuclei, and estrogen receptor-estradiol complexes from immature uteri bind to uterine nuclei. The binding is specific in that it is of high affinity (apparent Kd = 2 to 3 x 10-10 m) and involves a limited number of acceptor sites (about 3850 per haploid genome). Furthermore, nonradioactive receptor-steroid complexes inhibit the binding of the homologous receptors complexed with tritiated steroid. In each case, the maximum number of complexes bound to isolated nuclei is very similar to the number found in the nuclear fraction of intact cells exposed to saturating concentrations of steroid. Receptor-glucocorticoid complexes also bind with high affinity (apparent Kd = 2.6 x 10-10 m) to about 2150 acceptor sites (per haploid genome) in isolated uterine nuclei, even though the immature uterus is devoid of glucocorticoid receptors. The uterine acceptor sites for glucocorticoid receptors are different from those for estrogen receptors. Thus, the binding of one class of receptor-steroid complex is not inhibited by the other type. The acceptor sites for glucocorticoid receptors in both uterine and HTC cell nuclei are destroyed by DNase, whereas those for estrogen receptors are resistant. Nuclear-bound receptor-dexamethasone complexes are released from both uterine and HTC cell nuclei at a lower concentration of NaCl than is required to release bound receptor-estradiol complexes. Finally, acceptors for estrogen receptors are not found in HTC cell nuclei. It is concluded that nuclear acceptors for glucocorticoid receptors are not restricted to target tissues and therefore nuclei from certain cells are able to bind more than one class of steroid receptor. Where this occurs, however, the results show that each type of nuclear acceptor site binds only one of the two classes of receptor-steroid complex examined. Glucocorticoid and estrogen acceptor sites differ chemically and physically, possibly reflecting differences in the molecular mechanisms of action of these hormones."
https://openalex.org/W1539817651,"Abstract Sodium fluxes across the plasma membrane of turkey erythrocytes are 2 to 3 times greater than corresponding fluxes in human erythrocytes. Extracellular potassium stimulates fractional sodium outflux and inhibits sodium influx in turkey erythrocytes. In contrast to human erythrocytes, turkey erythrocytes showed no evidence for sodium-sodium exchange, and at all sodium concentrations studied addition of extracellular potassium inhibited sodium influx. Isoproterenol stimulated accumulation of cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cyclic 3':5'-AMP) and produced a 2- to 4-fold increase in sodium fluxes in turkey erythrocytes. The potency of catecholamine analogs for stimulation of sodium transport correlated directly with their potency for activation of adenylate cyclase in the turkey erythrocyte membrane. Stimulation of sodium transport by isoproterenol is reproduced by adding cyclic 3':5'-AMP to the medium and is blocked by propranolol. The increase in cyclic 3':5'-AMP in response to isoproterenol progresses unimpaired for at least 2 hours. The increase in sodium transport, however, begins to diminish within 30 min after addition of isoproterenol, and after 3 hours of incubation sodium fluxes are only slightly greater than for the control. This phenomenon presumably reflects accumulation of an inhibitor or depletion of a necessary factor for the transport system activated by intracellular cyclic 3':5'-AMP. The rapid effect described here of catecholamines on sodium transport as well as certain results with other systems controlled by hormones through cyclic 3':5'-AMP suggest that endocrine regulation of sodium transport is of general biological significance."
https://openalex.org/W1492318776,"Abstract Arginase activity accumulates in rat mammary gland during lactation, although an effective urea cycle is absent. This arginase has been partially purified and its properties have been compared to those of the purified rat liver enzyme. Conditions that allow solubilization of liver arginase leave more than 60% of the mammary gland enzyme particulate. Since solubilization requires treatment with 1-butanol, the enzyme is probably located in the membrane. Liver arginase is stable at 60°, whereas mammary gland enzyme is labile at 55°. Liver arginase has maximal catalytic activity between pH 10.0 and 10.6. At pH 10.6 the mammary gland enzyme has lost 75% of its activity. Chromatography on Sephadex G-150 separates the mammary gland activity into two fractions of different molecular weights (42,000 and 94,000), both less than that of the liver enzyme (120,000). A rabbit anti-serum that quantitatively precipitates adult and fetal liver arginases does not cross-react with the enzyme of mammary gland extracts. Arginase preparations from small intestine, kidney, and a transplanted renal carcinoma share some of these properties, and also do not cross-react with the anti-serum to liver arginase. An intermediate type of arginase found in hepatoma 7777 reacts with the antiserum, but less strongly than does liver arginase."
https://openalex.org/W1598282543,"Abstract The binding of phosphorylated non-histone proteins to DNA has been studied via the technique of DNA-cellulose chromatography. At an NaCl concentration of 0.14 m, approximately 1 % of this protein fraction prepared from rat liver binds to rat DNA. Both the percentage of binding observed and the binding constant for the protein-DNA interaction are dependent on ionic strength. The phosphorylated proteins bind less efficiently to foreign DNAs than to host DNA, thereby demonstrating the specificity of the binding reaction. Treatment with various enzymes demonstrates the protein nature of the material involved in conferring the specificity of binding of the non-histone proteins. At physiological ionic strength, binding sites on the DNA are saturated at a value of approximately 1 µg of phosphorylated protein per 100 µg of DNA. The material which selectively binds to the DNA is still a heterogeneous family of phosphorylated proteins as demonstrated via sodium dodecyl sulfate acrylamide gel electrophoresis. The majority of these DNA-binding proteins fall in a molecular weight range of 30,000 to 70,000, and amino acid analyses confirm that these phosphorylated proteins are non-histones. The results are consistent with a proposed role of the phosphorylated non-histone proteins in specific gene control."

https://openalex.org/W1553066780,"Abstract A rapid method for preparing plasma membranes from bovine corpus luteum is described. Various fractions are isolated by differential centrifugation and discontinuous sucrose density gradients. The plasma membrane fractions have a density in sucrose of 1.16 and 1.18. The yield is 0.5 to 0.75 mg per g of corpus luteum. This fraction is characterized by electron microscopy, enzymatic assay, and binding properties of 125I-luteinizing hormone. The plasma membrane fraction is free of nuclei and mitochondria when examined by electron microscopy. It is mainly vesicular in nature, with a unit membrane structure evident in most sections. The cholesterol to phospholipid ratio is 0.72. A small amount of RNA is found to be associated with the plasma membrane but no DNA is detected. 5'-Nucleotidase and ouabain-sensitive ATPase are concentrated in the plasma membrane. No more than 3 to 8% contamination by mitochondria is indicated by the activity of the mitochondrial markers: cytochrome c oxidase and succinate dehydrogenase. The microsomal marker activities of glucose 6-phosphatase and glucose-6-P dehydrogenase are low, corresponding to 2 to 5% contamination by microsomes. The binding of 125I-luteinizing hormone to the plasma membrane fraction is 20 times greater than its binding to the homogenate. The binding of 125I-luteinizing hormone to nuclei, mitochondria, and microsomes is low and parallels the 5'-nucleotidase activity of those fractions. It probably reflects their contamination by plasma membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1533735300,"Abstract A particulate preparation isolated from Escherichia coli B catalyzes the acylation of 1-acyl-sn-glycerol 3-phosphate (1-acyl-GP) with both oleoyl-CoA and palmitoyl-CoA. The optimum conditions were determined for the acyl-CoA: 1-acyl-GP acyltransferase. The acyltransferase is specific for the 1-acyl-GP and does not acylate 2-acyl-sn-glycerol 3-phosphate (2-acyl-GP) under the conditions used. The particulate preparation also catalyses the acylation of sn-glycerol 3-phosphate (glycerophosphate) with both palmitoyl-CoA and oleoyl-CoA. When palmitoyl-CoA is the substrate, both monoacyl-sn-glycerol 3-phosphate (monoacyl-GP) and diacyl-sn-glycerol 3-phosphate (diacyl-GP) are produced. The two products show a typical precursor-product relationship. When oleoyl-CoA is used, the major product is diacyl-GP; monoacyl-GP is formed, but the amount reaches a very low steady state level within 2 min of incubation. Structural analyses of the monoacyl-GP formed after short time incubations of glycerophosphate with unsaturated or saturated acyl-CoAs showed the major isomer to be 1-acyl-GP. The amounts of 2-acyl-GP formed are relatively small. The lack of accumulation of 2-acyl-GP during the acylation of glycerophosphate is not due to the isomerization of 2-acyl-GP to the 1-acyl-GP isomer. During the acylation of radioactive glycerophosphate with unsaturated acyl-CoA, radioactive monoacyl-GP is trapped effectively by the addition of nonlabeled 1-acyl-GP but ineffectively by adding nonlabeled 2-acyl-GP. The monoacyl-GP trapped in the presence of either 1-acyl-GP or 2-acyl-GP is mostly the 1-acyl-GP isomer. Thus, the pathway of diacyl-GP synthesis from glycerophosphate in E. coli is primarily via the 1-acyl-GP as intermediate regardless of whether the substrate is saturated or unsaturated acyl-CoA."

While we did not examine all of the possibilities, we did not find a ribosome function that was appreciably and consistently altered by phosphorylation. The synthesis of polyphenylalanine at high concentrations of magnesium (12.5 mm), which was dependent on elongation factors EF-1 and EF-2, was not changed if the ribosomes were phosphorylated. The synthesis of polyphenylalanine at low concentrations of magnesium (6 mm), which required the initiation factors EIF-1 and EIF-2 as well as elongation factors, was increased (18%) if the concentrations of phosphorylated ribosomes were limiting but not if initiation factors were limiting. The phosphorylation of the 40 S subunit increased only slightly (13%) the EIF-1-catalyzed binding of Phe-tRNA to the particle. Finally, there was no appreciable difference in the ability of phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated ribosomes to translate encephalomyocarditis virus RNA (which required all three initiation factors)."

https://openalex.org/W1601120844,"Abstract Treatment of intact chicken embryo fibroblasts in tissue culture with trypsin leads to an alteration of the kinetic properties of a particulate cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) phosphodiesterase. Distribution studies show that this phosphodiesterase is principally located in the plasma membrane. Little activity is found in nuclear, mitochondrial, and microsomal fractions. The trypsin-sensitive phosphodiesterase activity does not function on the exterior of the cell membrane. The Km and Vmax of the enzyme are altered by trypsin treatment of intact cells and this effect is quantitatively reproduced by trypsin treatment of the isolated plasma membrane fraction. The supernatant fraction of chicken embryo fibroblasts contains phosphodiesterases capable of hydrolyzing both cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP. DEAE-cellulose chromatography of the supernatant fraction resolves phosphodiesterase activity into two peaks. One fraction is specific for cyclic AMP and is kinetically similar to the plasma membrane enzyme, whereas the other fraction hydrolyzes both cyclic nucleotides in a Michaelis-Menten fashion. The cyclic AMP-specific phosphodiesterase appears to be under negative cooperative regulation. These studies show that chicken embryo fibroblasts contain a cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase in the plasma membrane, the kinetic properties of which can be altered by an enzyme that acts on the outer cell membrane."

In the absence of oleate or other activators, the enzyme had a pH optimum at 8.4 with either Mn2+ or Mg2+. The addition of oleate imposed additional neutral activity onto the activity observed in its absence. Activation by oleate was half-maximal at a concentration of 4 µm and had a pH optimum of 7.1 with either metal. Oleate or 3-phosphoglycerate protected the enzyme from inactivation by ATP and ADP. Half-maximal protection against inactivation by 1.5 mm ATP was found with either 9 µm oleate or 90 µm 3-phosphoglycerate. AMP inhibition of the oleate-protected or untreated enzyme was cooperative, with 50% inhibition observed at 17 µm AMP. In contrast, the ATP-inactivated enzyme showed noncooperative AMP inhibition with a Ki of 7 µm. Physical interaction of fructose 1,6-diphosphatase and oleate was supported by demonstration of the solubilization of [14C]oleic acid adsorbed on Celite. Fatty acids appear to be unique among physiologically occurring effectors of fructose 1,6-diphosphatase in that they serve as potent activators and also protect the enzyme from ATP inactivation."
https://openalex.org/W1512695521,"Abstract The kinetic mechanism of lipoamide dehydrogenase has been studied at pH 8.0, 37°, using the enzyme from rat liver mitochondria. Initial velocity patterns obtained for both the forward and reverse reactions were a series of parallel lines. Michaelis constants for the reactants are: NAD, 0.52 mm; dihydrolipoamide, 0.49 mm; NADH, 0.062 mm; lipoamide, 0.84 mm. Isotopic exchange between NAD and NADH was also studied. The exchange rate in the absence of lipoyl derivatives was not significantly increased by the presence of all of the reactants. These data, as well as the results from product inhibition studies, are consistent with a Bi Bi Ping Pong mechanism for this enzyme as originally proposed by Massey et al. (Massey, V., Gibson, Q. H., and Veeger, C. (1960) Biochem. J. 77, 341). In addition, the formation of kinetically significant abortive complexes between the enzyme and NADH or lipoamide is shown."

https://openalex.org/W1543517491,"Abstract 1,2-Dihydroxybenzene-3,5-disulfonic acid (Tiron) has been investigated with regard to oxidation to the o-semiquinone form by both photochemical and enzymatic systems. The formation of the o-semiquinone radical can be recorded at pH 6.8 in the electron spin resonance spectrometer at room temperature. The kinetics of formation and decay of the radical has been determined, since it is relatively stable in solution. The parent catechol is not autoxidized to a significant extent below pH 7. The utility of Tiron as a model compound for catechol oxidation reactions lies in the stability of the o-semiquinone at lower pH values and the relative absence of side reactions or formation of highly oxidized pigments. The reaction between oxygen-reductant complexes and this catechol may be diagnostic of the formation of such intermediates where superoxide dismutase fails to inhibit effectively oxygen-dependent electron transfer. It has been previously reported (Massey, V., Palmer, G., and Ballou, D. (1971) in Flavins and Flavoproteins (Kamin, H., ed) p. 349, University Park Press, Baltimore) that in the photochemical system, reduced flavin mononucleotide reacts with oxygen to form a compound which then may dissociate to yield the flavin semiquinone and free superoxide anion. The equilibrium position for dissociation of the reduced flavin-oxygen compound may be shifted toward free superoxide anion at higher pH values. The flavin radical is shown to be unreactive with Tiron at pH 6.8. The disulfonated catechol which was used in the present work is chemically similar to catecholamines and other catechols of biological origin in that metal-catalyzed autoxidation to the o-semiquinone takes place readily above pH 8.5. Evidence is presented indicating that catechols and ferricytochrome c can react directly with the reduced flavin-oxygen compound by a pathway which is not susceptible to inhibition by superoxide dismutase. In contrast, the oxidation of Tiron by iron-flavoproteins is completely inhibited by superoxide dismutase. Thus, in the latter case, superoxide anion must be released from the enzyme active site before reacting with catechols or cytochrome c."
https://openalex.org/W1596582715,"Abstract Analysis of purified plasma membranes from isolated fat cells by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis resolved at least 11 major peptide components which ranged in apparent molecular weights from 168,000 to 22,000. No alteration in the number or mobilities of these components was found when fat cells were isolated with three different preparations of partially characterized crude collagenase (Clostridium histolyticum) or if plasma membranes were purified on linear or discontinuous sucrose gradients. Fat cell plasma membranes contained two major glycopeptides with apparent molecular weights of 94,000 and 78,000. The isolated fat cell plasma membrane fraction consisted of approximately 40% protein, 40% phospholipid, 16% cholesterol, and 4% neutral carbohydrate. Essentially complete removal of phospholipid and cholesterol from membranes could be attained by extraction with ethanol at room temperature for 15 min. The alcohol-insoluble fraction consisted of about 95% protein, 4% neutral sugar, and 0.5% sialic acid. A diffuse Schiff reagent-positive band which migrated near the dye front on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels was alcohol-soluble indicating the possible presence of glycolipid. The marked reduction in the ability of plasma membranes derived from trypsinized fat cells to bind 125I-insulin was accompanied by the selective digestion of two major membrane peptides of molecular weights 68,000 and 54,000 and the partial digestion of a 42,000 molecular weight peptide. The membrane glycoproteins were relatively resistant to trypsin treatment of intact cells or isolated plasma membranes in Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer. In contrast, membranes suspended in hypotonic EDTA (1 mm) were uniformly degraded by trypsin, apparently as a consequence of altered conformations of the membrane or the membrane peptides, or both, in this medium."
https://openalex.org/W1490751034,"Abstract Glycopeptides from soluble rat skin collagen were prepared by sequential digestion with collagenase and trypsin. The isolation of the major glycopeptides was accomplished with gel filtration and ion exchange chromatography. The glycohexapeptide, Gly-Met-Hyl (Gal-Glc)-Gly-His-Arg, has previously been characterized in digests of various vertebrate collagens studied in this and other laboratories. Two other glycopeptides known to be present in digests of human skin collagen, Gly-Phe-Hyl(Gal-Glc)-Gly-Ile-Arg and Gly-Pro-Hyl(Gal) were also isolated from digests of rat skin collagen. Three additional glycopeptides which had not been previously reported in other vertebrate collagens were purified and their structures analyzed. Two of them were hexapeptides, Gly-Phe-Hyl(Gal)-Gly-Ile-Arg and Gly-Pro-Hyl(Gal)-Gly-Glu-Leu, while the other was a tripeptide, Gly-Met-Hyl(Gal). Characterization of the glycopeptides obtained from the purified α1 and α2 components of rat skin collagen and hexose analysis of the cyanogen bromide (CNBr) peptides derived from whole collagen as well as from both chains indicate the presence of only four major sites of glycosylation in the molecule. The evidence presented is consistent with the existence of an identical site in each α1 chain, corresponding to a disaccharide unit near the NH2 terminus of the α1-CB5 cyanogen bromide peptide. The other two sites are located in the CNBr peptide α2-CB4 derived from the α2 chain. There are, in addition, other minor sites of glycosylation in the molecule. The limited number of sites of glycosylation and the location of all such sites in the same general area of the α chains near the NH2 terminus suggest a specific but unknown functional role in synthesis, fibril formation, or other basic aspects of collagen metabolism in skin."
https://openalex.org/W1544637166,Abstract Initial velocity studies over the pH range 7.5 to 10.5 have been utilized to derive kinetic constants for the hydrolysis of deoxythymidine-3'-phosphate-5'-p-nitrophenylphosphate catalyzed by staphylococcal nuclease. A pronounced decline in reaction rate at high substrate concentration has been attributed to multiple binding of the substrate to the enzyme. The pH dependence of the parameters κ2 and Km has been employed to derive kinetically apparent ionization constants for the processes of binding and reaction. This analysis also yielded the pH-independent kinetic constants κ2 in water and deuterium oxide with the ratio κ2h2o/κ2d2o = 0.95. The relationship of these data to the possible mechanism of catalysis has been considered.
https://openalex.org/W1587913679,"Abstract The inhibitory effect of ATP on glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.12) has been investigated under conditions simulating the intracellular milieu. The inhibition is strongly pH-dependent. With the physiological concentrations of ATP, NAD, and orthophosphate, the dehydrogenase reaction is 87 % inhibited at pH 6.8, 67 % at pH 7.4, and only 20 % at pH 8.1. ADP, adenosine 5'-monophosphate, and cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate are almost equally inhibitory but have less physiological significance since the intracellular levels are much lower than ATP. The ATP inhibition is mixed type inhibition in which ATP is nearly competitive with respect to either NAD or Pi. ATP (6 mm) increases Km for NAD from 0.06 to 0.3 mm and decreases Vmax from 91 to 65 µmoles of NADH per min per mg of protein. Similarly the Km for Pi is changed from 1.2 to 6.1 mm whereas Vmax is decreased from 89 to 61. Experiments using AMP or pyrophosphate as the component parts of ATP have also been carried out. AMP reacts competitively with respect to NAD but not Pi, whereas PPi is nearly competitive with Pi but not NAD. These data suggest that ATP simultaneously obstructs both NAD and Pi binding in the active center. ATP is noncompetitive with regard to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. Mg2+ or Mn2+ reduces the inhibitory effect of ATP by complexing with the nucleotide. ATP also effects a time-dependent inactivation, which is additive with the instantaneous inhibition mentioned above. This time-dependent inhibition is counteracted by NAD but not Pi. The physiological implication of ATP inhibition on the dehydrogenase is discussed in the connection with muscle physiology. ATP inhibition may in part account for the high levels of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase in the muscle, protect against excessive acidity due to lactic production, limit maximal glycolytic flux, and modify the turnover of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1501471226,Abstract The kinetics for inactivation of rat liver membrane adenylate cyclase by iodoacetamide is reported. Glucagon at 1 µm stimulates the rate of inactivation by a factor of 10-fold. It is proposed that interaction of glucagon with its receptor in the membranes promotes conformational changes which either increase exposure or enhance nucleophilicity of one or more sulfhydryl groups crucial for adenylate cyclase activity. The possibility that hormonal stimulation of adenylate cyclase may be mediated through sulfhydryl reactivity is considered.
https://openalex.org/W1560621696,"Abstract UDP-galactose-4-epimerase and TDP-glucose-oxidoreductase are shown to have analogous reaction mechanisms. TDP-glucose is a substrate for both enzymes, and when labeled with tritium at carbon 4 it displayed an isotope effect for both enzymes. Neither enzyme exhibited an isotope effect with the 3-tritiated substrate. The value of the isotope effect for the 4-tritiated substrate was identical for both enzymes within the limits of error. Consistent with these findings, TDP-[4-3H]glucose donated tritium to enzyme-bound NAD+, leading to formation of enzyme-[3H1]NADH. This suggests that a nucleoside diphospho-4-ulose (of the configuration d-xylo-4-hexosulose) is an intermediate in the reactions catalyzed by UDP-galactose-4-epimerase and TDP-glucose-oxidoreductase."
https://openalex.org/W1485881868,"Abstract Phosphocreatine inhibited glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase crystallized from rabbit muscle or yeast. Creatine at the same concentration showed no inhibition. The inhibition was competitive with respect to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. At the approximate physiological concentrations of substrate (0.01 mm) and phosphocreatine (20 mm), the enzyme was 65 % inhibited. Phosphocreatine is not competitive with respect to NAD or orthophosphate. The inhibition by phosphocreatine was maximal at pH 7.4 and decreased about 17 % with a pH fall to 6.8 or a rise to 8.5. Incubation of the muscle enzyme with phosphocreatine produced a time-dependent inactivation which was prevented by the addition of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. This time-dependent inactivation and the instantaneous inhibition were additive. Magnesium partially relieved the inhibitory effects of phosphocreatine. The properties of the inhibitory effects of phosphocreatine and ATP are compared. Since the phosphocreatine level in muscle may decrease very rapidly during muscle contraction, the inhibition on triose phosphate dehydrogenase may be lessened substantially, and ATP resynthesis will be promoted. Further physiological consequences of phosphocreatine and ATP inhibition in the resting and contracting muscle are considered."
https://openalex.org/W1498611453,"Abstract A partially purified plasma membrane fraction was prepared from the rat renal medulla by flotation in a discontinuous sucrose density gradient. The preparation was enriched in vasopressin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity to a greater extent than either fluoride-stimulated or basal activity. The Km for vasopressin was 4 to 15 x 10-9 m in different preparations. The Km for ATP was 0.12 to 0.16 mm for basal, hormone-stimulated, and fluoride-stimulated activities. The different reaction rates under the three conditions were due to differences in the maximal velocity of the reaction. The concentration of Mg++ required for half-maximal enzyme activity was the same for basal, vasopressin-stimulated, and fluoride-stimulated activities. The activation energy of the reaction was 15 to 17 Cal per mole for all three conditions. The reversibility of hormone stimulation of adenylate cyclase was studied by measuring the rate of change of enzyme activity following dilution of the hormone. Decreasing the concentration of hormone led to an immediate drop in the rate of formation of adenosine cyclic 3':5'-monophosphate to that expected at the lower vasopressin concentration. This indicates that the hormone is in equilibrium with the receptors and that the binding of hormone is rapidly reversible."

https://openalex.org/W123413327,"The mechanism of action of Escherichia coli gal repressor on in vitro gal messenger RNA synthesis has been studied. The purified transcription system includes RNA polymerase holoenzyme, cyclic adenosine 3′:5′-monophosphate (cyclic AMP), cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP), and a λpgal DNA template. We find that gal repressor acts in a manner competitive with RNA polymerase plus CRP. A preinitiation complex formed by λpgal DNA, RNA polymerase, CRP, and cyclic AMP is resistant to inhibition by gal repressor. Conversely, incubation of λpgal DNA with gal repressor prior to the addition of RNA polymerase, CRP, and cyclic AMP prevents the formation of a preinitiation complex. We conclude that the gal operator and promoter regions overlap functionally, and we consider a variety of models to explain this effect."

https://openalex.org/W1502657219,"Abstract In vitro methods currently utilized for the determination of lipolytic responses in adipose tissue have not allowed for the continuous monitoring of rapid successive changes in rates of lipolysis. The perifused fat cell system utilized in this investigation offers a simple, reproducible method by which minute-to-minute changes in the rate of lipolysis of isolated fat cells may be monitored. In this technique, isolated fat cells are placed in a plastic column and perifused with albumin-containing buffer in the absence and presence of various lipolytic agents. Using this technique, we have been able to observe alterations in the rates of glycerol release during the initiation of hormone-induced lipolysis. In addition, we have been able to observe the decline in glycerol release following the removal of the lipolytic hormone. In the perifused fat cell system, epinephrine, isoproterenol, and norepinephrine elicited a maximal lipolytic response at 10 µm, theophylline at 1 mm, and glucagon at 5 µm. In addition, N6, O2'-dibutyryl cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (1 mm), adrenocorticotropic hormone (100 milliunits per ml), and thyroid stimulating hormone (75 milliunits per ml) effectively stimulated lipolysis in the perifused fat cell system, whereas cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (1 mm) and serotonin (1 mm) were without effect. Unlike the incubated tissue method, growth hormone (20 µg per ml) was found to be a potent stimulator of lipolysis in this system. The combined administration of theophylline and epinephrine, both at submaximal concentrations, resulted in rates of glycerol release which were significantly greater than the sum of the rates observed during individual administration."

https://openalex.org/W1492136619,"Abstract A molecular weight of 164,000 was determined for an NAD-specific succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase from a Pseudomonas species by gel filtration, polyacrylamide electrophoresis with reference proteins, and ultracentrifugation. Electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate gave rise to a single subunit band with a molecular weight of 54,500, indicating that this enzyme is a three-subunit enzyme. Ultracentrifugal studies show that the enzyme dissociates into subunits at pH values of 9.7 or higher. Under conditions of low ionic strength and absence of sulfhydryl protective reagents, the enzyme reversibly associates to form a dimer with a molecular weight of about 320,000 as calculated from the Svedberg equation and from polyacrylamide electrophoresis with reference proteins. Immunodiffusion in the absence of NaCl gave one precipitin line corresponding to the monomer, while immunodiffusion in the presence of 0.15 m NaCl gave three precipitin lines which can be correlated to the subunit, the monomer, and the dimer. Antisuccinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase cross-reacts with other enzyme fractions from this Pseudomonas which are active toward 3-aminopropanal and 4-aminobutanal as well as succinic semialdehyde. It is suggested that these fractions represent hybrids of succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase and aminoaldehyde dehydrogenases."
https://openalex.org/W1525349075,"Abstract A Mn++-stimulated aminopeptidase was separated from homogenates of bovine cerebrum and was observed to inactivate melanocyte-stimulating hormone release-inhibiting factor (Pro-Leu-Gly-NH2) in a manner similar to leucine aminopeptidase and arylamidase, by liberating both proline and leucine from the amino end of the tripeptide amide. The brain enzyme has physical and enzymic properties distinctly different from rat brain arylamidase. The Mn++-stimulated aminopeptidase, in common with leucine aminopeptidase, does not hydrolyze thyrotropin-releasing factor, luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone, Lys-bradykinin, bradykinin, (Asp1Ile5) angiotensin I, oxytocin, or Arg-vasotocin. Two Mn++-inhibited bovine brain aminopeptidases, which cleave Leu-Gly-Gly in common with the Mn++-stimulated aminopeptidase, were inactive toward all the peptide hormones tested, including melanocyte-stimulating hormone release-inhibiting factor. Bovine cerebrum homogenates hydrolyzed the linear peptide hormones but did not act upon the cyclic ones, oxytocin and Arg-vasotocin. These results support the suggestion that brain peptidases capable of acting upon the peptide hormones exhibit a very high degree of substrate specificity."
https://openalex.org/W1538436457,"Abstract A decrease in enzymatic activity during the standard assay procedure for UDP-galactose-4-epimerase (EC 5.1.3.2) led to the observation that ADP-ribose-(5) (5-(adenosine-5'-pyrophosphoryl)d-ribose), a degradation product of NAD+, is a strong inhibitor for the enzyme. This inhibition was completely reversed by the addition of TDP-4-keto-6-deoxyglucose. Synthetic analogues of ADP-ribose-(5), such as TDP-ribose-(5) and TDP-glucose-(6) were found to be even better inhibitors than ADP-ribose-(5). Incubation of UDP-galactose-4-epimerase with TDP-[1-3H]glucose-(6) established the reaction mechanism of the inhibition as follows: TDP-[1-3H]glucose-(6) + enzyme·NAD+ → (TDP-gluconic acid-(6)·enzyme-[3H1]NADH). We call this process inhibition. One criterion used to recognize reductive inhibition is the reversal of this process by the addition of TDP-4-keto-6-deoxyglucose: (TDP-gluconic acid-(6)·enzyme·[3H1]NADH) + TDP-4-keto-6-deoxyglucose → enzyme·NAD+ + TDP-gluconic acid-(6) + TDP-6-deoxy-[4-3H]glucose + TDP-6-deoxy-[4-3H]galactose. These results, in combination with a stereochemical examination of the hydrogen mediation of the substrate as well as of the reductive inhibitor, led us to conclude that the same active site on the enzyme is involved in both processes. The concept of reductive inhibition is illustrated and applied to other groups of compounds as well as to other enzymes. In all cases discussed, reductive inhibition occurs according to the following scheme: 3H-inhibitor + enzyme·NAD+ → ((Inhibitor)oxidized ·enzyme-[3H1]NADH)"

Data obtained at physiological pH were compared with those previously noted at pH 5.0 where the cAMP-protein kinase interaction is optimal. Reactions utilizing the binding subunit exhibited second order association kinetics and temperature dependence. The second order rate constant was dependent on [cAMP]0, an anomaly previously noted at pH 5.0. Reactions using the cAMP-dependent protein kinase exhibited nonlinear second order plots with little temperature dependence. The dissociation process was substantially faster at pH 7.4 and appeared to be biphasic. Thus, the reaction between cAMP and its receptor in the presence or absence of the catalytic subunit exhibited qualitatively similar behavior at pH values of 5.0 and 7.4."

https://openalex.org/W1564588296,"Abstract Various aspects of lactate metabolism were compared in perfused livers from normal and hypophysectomized rats. Glucose production by livers from hypophysectomized animals exceeded that by normal rat livers largely due to enhanced rates of lactate gluconeogenesis. When perfusion was carried out with a nonrecirculating medium containing physiological levels of lactate (1 to 4 mm), the rate of glucose synthesis from labeled lactate by livers from hypophysectomized rats was 3 to 4 times that of normal rat livers. Saturating levels of substrate were 6 to 8 mm lactate for livers from hypophysectomized rats and 14 mm lactate for normal rat livers. At these levels, the rates of gluconeogenesis in both groups were similar. Over a range of lactate concentrations from physiological to saturating levels, the rates of conversion of lactate to CO2, glycogen, protein, and fatty acids were reduced below normal in livers from hypophysectomized rats. In livers perfused with 1 mm lactate, tissue levels of pyruvate, P-enolpyruvate, 2-P-glycerate, 3-P-glycerate, and glucose-6-P were increased above normal by hypophysectomy. At saturating lactate concentrations, levels of gluconeogenic intermediates in livers from normal and hypophysectomized rats were similar. These data, in addition to the similar rates of total lactate utilization, indicated that hypophysectomy affected a redistribution of substrate among competitive metabolic pathways. It was suggested that at physiological levels of lactate a reduction in pyruvate oxidation led to an increased availability of substrate for gluconeogenesis. The hepatic level of cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate was unchanged following hypophysectomy, suggesting that the increased rate of gluconeogenesis was not due to an elevation in the concentration of this nucleotide. Livers from hypophysectomized rats did not appear to respond to conditions which elevate the tissue level of this nucleotide since an overnight fast, or perfusion with glucagon, had no effect on the rate of conversion of lactate to glucose."
https://openalex.org/W1581367252,"Abstract The effects of sugar phosphates, nucleotides, and other phosphorylated compounds on NAD-linked l-glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase from rabbit liver were studied. Glucose-6-P, fructose-1,6-P2, ribose-5-P, ribulose-1,5-P2, 2,3-propanediol-3-P, and 3-P-glycerate, but not 2-P-glycerate, 2,3-P2-glycerate, or glycerol-2-P, inhibited the oxidation of glycerol-3-P in a noncompetitive manner with respect to either glycerol-3-P or NAD+. The inhibition constants were in the range from 1 to 4 mm. These sugar phosphates in the range from 0.4 to 4 mm did not significantly inhibit the reduction of dihydroxyacetone-P at 0.03 mm dihydroxyacetone-P and 0.01 mm NADH. On the other hand, glyceraldehyde-3-P elicited competitive inhibition (Ki = 0.9 mm) with respect to glycerol-3-P and noncompetitive inhibition (Ki = 1.7 mm) with respect to NAD+. Inorganic phosphate in the range from 1 to 20 mm did not significantly affect the oxidation of glycerol-3-P. However, a significant inhibition on the rate of reduction of dihydroxyacetone-P in a noncompetitive manner with respect to either dihydroxyacetone-P or NADH was observed. Nucleotides and pyrophosphate were found to inhibit both the reverse and forward reactions in a competitive manner with respect to NAD+ or its reduced form and in a noncompetitive manner with respect to glycerol-3-P or dihydroxyacetone-P. From the present kinetic studies, it seems that sugar phosphates, phosphoenolpyruvate, and inorganic phosphate interact with different sites of the enzyme. Nucleotides and pyrophosphate likely interact with the enzyme at the site for NAD+. The physiological significance of the findings in relation to the carbohydrate and lipid metabolism is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1563977241,"The distributions in dextran-sucrose or sucrose gradients of biosynthetic and enzymatic activities associated with HeLa cell mitochondria have been analyzed.

The sedimentation profile of mitochondria assayed by DNA content follows fairly precisely that of mitochondria assayed by macromolecular synthetic activities. The distribution in a dextran-sucrose gradient of mitochondria assayed by malate dehydrogenase activity is intermediate between those of mitochondria identified by cytochrome oxidase or in vivo macromolecular biosynthetic activities. An electron microscope examination of the structures fractionated in a dextran-sucrose gradient has given results, which, when correlated with the biochemical data, indicate that HeLa cell mitochondria are active in macromolecular syntheses in proportion to their size, while cytochrome oxidase activity is concentrated in smaller mitochondria. The possibility that an in vivo heterogeneity of HeLa cell mitochondria in DNA content and enzyme activities is responsible for the observed differences in mitochondrial distributions in the dextran-sucrose or sucrose gradients is discussed."
