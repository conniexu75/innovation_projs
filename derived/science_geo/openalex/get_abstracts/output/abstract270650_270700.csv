https://openalex.org/W1996530017,"Samples of fossil coral and oolite from marine formations of the Bahamas and the Florida Keys have been analyzed for their concentrations of uranium and thorium isotopes. Ages calculated from the ratio Th(230): U(234) clearly indicate periods of marine limestone formation at about 85,000, 130,000, and 190,000 years ago, implying that the surface of the ocean was then close to its present level."
https://openalex.org/W2035088954,"Alcohol dehydrogenase, in Drosophila melanogaster homozygous for the alleles Adh(F) or Adh(S), is found in three electrophoretically different forms. Adh' differs from Adh(5) in that isozymes with faster electrophoretic mobilities are present. In Adh(F)/Adh(S) heterozygotes, hybrid isozymes as well as the parental isozymes are present, indicating that the dehydrogenase may exist as a dimer of two polypeptide subunits. The gene, Adh, is located on the second chromosome, with a map position of 50.1 and a cytological position between 34E3 and 35D1."
https://openalex.org/W2032527957,"The thorium-230: uranium-234 method of dating corals and oolites has been evaluated in detail for reliability, and various criteria have been established. Reliable ages for extensive coral formations of about 6000 and 120,000 years were obtained. A hiatus in the development of coral between 6000 and 120,000 years ago on the Pactfic atoll of Eniwetok implies that conditions did not permit coral growth during this period. The record prior to 120,000 years ago is not clear, probably because of a lack of unaltered samples."
https://openalex.org/W2063289315,"Comparison of infrared spectra of amber no older than Oligo-Miocene with present-day resins provides convincing evidence as to source, especially with corroboration from paleobotanical remains and knowledge of living resin producers. Spectroscopy is also useful in establishing that amber in widely separated areas in the Cretaceous and Eocene is from the same botanical source, although it may not be possible to relate these older resins to those from present-day plant populations."
https://openalex.org/W2022996442,"Results are presented for the first time-resolved x-ray absorption measurements with a time resolution of 300 microseconds on a dynamically evolving chemical system. By synchronizing a neodymium: yttrium-aluminum-garnet pulsed laser with the bursts of x-rays emitted from the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source, it was possible to monitor at room temperature the recombination of carbon monoxide with myoglobin after laser photolysis. Changes in the pre-edge structure and in the position of the iron edge of this protein were detected as a function of time."
https://openalex.org/W1999723783,It was shown previously that infants who have neither reached nor crawled discriminate changes in spatial position on the basis of cues other than the projective size of objects displaced in space. It is now shown that binocular vision is not necessary for discrimination and that pictorial cues are not sufficient for discrimination. Parallax variables provide the information used by such infants for the discrimination of size and distance.
https://openalex.org/W1987254072,"The sensitivity of monolayers of Ilford L-4 nuclear emulsion to beta(-)-particles is approximately 0.20 grain per particle emitted for H(3), and 0.025 grain per particle for p(32). The sensitivity for thick layers is 1.3 grains per tritium beta(-)-particle emitted within the emulsion. In electron microscopic autoradiographs the maximum resolution is approximately 0.1 micron for H(3) and 0.3 micron for p(32)."

Selection of aberrant colonies and examination of the cultural characteristics of these clones suggest that mutants of at least several types are easily derivable in Anacystis."

https://openalex.org/W2059641952,"Certain problems usually associated with the histochemistry of lipases are obviated by a technique that utilizes the endogenous blood chylomicrons and the cellular stores of triglyceride as substrates for the histochemical demonstration of lipolytic enzyme activity in situ. In spreads of mesenteric adipose tissue, the technique makes it possible to distinguish between lipoprotein lipase activity at sites in the capillaries and lipolysis occurring in the adipocytes. The selective anatomic lolization of the lipase reaction correlated with the functional state of the tissue, and the absence of reaction product in control mesenteries from starved mice or in heat-inactivated controls, support the validity of this histochemical reaction."

https://openalex.org/W2025220256,"The appositional regions between the surface membrane and sarcoplasmic reticulum in insects, decapod crustaceans, and barnacles are largely diadic and show a four-layered structure which is roughly circular in surface view. Each consists of the 56-angstrom double-membrane of the in-termediary (here called excitatory) element, and the 75-A double-membrane of the cisternal element of the reticulum, separated by a space of about 100 A. A sheet of electron-dense material is found between the two elements, giving the superficial appearance of an additional membrane. The orbits of thin filaments around the thick filaments adjacent to both excitatory and reticular elements are incomplete on the contact side. Regularly spaced bridges connect the thick filaments with both the excitatory elements and cisternal elements and hold the diads in place during stretch and contraction."
https://openalex.org/W2058675839,"Measurements of the respiratory water exchanges of Tursiops truncatus and Lagenorhynchus obli-quidens indicate that these species lose, respectively, only 30 and 77 percent as much water through evaporation as would terrestrial mammals of the same body weight. Control of temperature and pressure within the respiratory system and a lower ventilation rate account for this relatively small loss of water."
https://openalex.org/W2018235248,"Aquatic softshell turtles (Trionyx spinifer spinifer) show a net active uptake of sodium from solutions of this cation as dilute as 5 micromoles per liter. This probably occurs in the pharynx, a site of aquatic respiration. Inhibition of active sodium transport by low temperatures causes an extreme lowering of the sodium concentration in the plasma. Other fresh-water turtles may utilize this mechanism of ionic regulation. The ultrastructure of the pharyngeal villi is similar to that of frog skin and toad bladder."
https://openalex.org/W2043763665,The apical meristem of the vegetative shoot of Chenopodium album (lamb's-quarters) exhibits alterations in cytoplasmic structure as early as 3 hours after the plant has been subjected to one photoinductive cycle which promotes flowering. The endo-plasmic reticulum shows an altered distribution and there is evidence of an increase in acid phosphatase production. Dictyosomes increase in number per cell by the end of the second inductive cycle.

Reduced trimethylene dipyridyl in darkness will reduce spinach ferredoxin, Clostridium pasteurianum ferredoxin, nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate, and other viologen-type dyes."
https://openalex.org/W2167290525,"Excised peripheral nerves from several species of mammals from interior Alaska continue to operate when supercooled to temperatures as low as -6 degrees C. In some nerves, spontaneous freezing begins before activity ceases. If the nerves are not allowved to remain in a partially or completely frozen state for a prolonged period they will regain their activity when rewarmed."
https://openalex.org/W2018450973,The class of ribosomes from Escherichia coli that associate with plant virus RNA in vitro can be separated from the bulk of ribosomes by gradient centrifugation. The relative activity for subsequent incorporation of amino acid into polypeptides directed by the viral RNA in comparison to that directed by polyuridylic acid is the same for that class as for the bulk of ribosomes.
https://openalex.org/W2029996802,"A report that low permeability could cause gross errors in psychrometric determinations of water potential in leaves has not been confirmed. No measurable error from this source could be detected for either of two types of thermocouple psychrometer tested on four species, each at four levels of water potential. No source of error other than tissue respiration could be demonstrated."

https://openalex.org/W2069598725,"Helium, resident in relatively high concentrations in certain natural gas fields in the United States, can be lost to the atmosphere when the natural gas is burned as fuel. In 1960, Congress amended the Helium Act of 1925 to provide for stripping natural gas of its helium, for purchase of the separated helium by the government, and for its long-term storage. In 1971, after about 28 billion cubic feet had been stored, the purchase program was terminated by the government, an action that unleashed several lawsuits and not a little acrimony. After more than a decade of controversy, much of the litigation has been concluded, much of the helium that could have been saved has been wasted to the atmosphere, and the gas fields supplying the helium are almost depleted. A new rich source of helium has been discovered in southwestern Wyoming that could ensure adequate supplies for many decades if an appropriate new federal policy on helium is developed and implemented."
https://openalex.org/W1965608921,"The nonspecificity of rabbit gamma-globulin (antibody) to western equine encephalitis virus and the non-specificity of normal rabbit gamma-globulin in complement-fixation tests with anti-gens prepared from chick-embryo cells infected with this virus and normal chick-embryo cells resided primarily in Porter's fragment III. Addition of complement to fragment III from the anti-body globulin, followed by inactivation of the added complement, abolished the complement-fixing ability of fragment III with both specific and nonspecific antigens. Similar treatment of the undigested antibody abolished its complement-fixing ability with nonspecific antigen only."
