https://openalex.org/W4240237951,"The elucidation of the human genome sequence has made it possible to identify genetic alterations in cancers in unprecedented detail. To begin a systematic analysis of such alterations, we determined the sequence of well-annotated human protein-coding genes in two common tumor types. Analysis of 13,023 genes in 11 breast and 11 colorectal cancers revealed that individual tumors accumulate an average of ∼90 mutant genes but that only a subset of these contribute to the neoplastic process. Using stringent criteria to delineate this subset, we identified 189 genes (average of 11 per tumor) that were mutated at significant frequency. The vast majority of these genes were not known to be genetically altered in tumors and are predicted to affect a wide range of cellular functions, including transcription, adhesion, and invasion. These data define the genetic landscape of two human cancer types, provide new targets for diagnostic and therapeutic intervention, and open fertile avenues for basic research in tumor biology."

In plants, it has been assumed that microscopic surface openings, such as stomata, serve as passive ports of bacterial entry during infection. Surprisingly, we found that stomatal closure is part of a plant innate immune response to restrict bacterial invasion. Stomatal guard cells of Arabidopsis perceive bacterial surface molecules, which requires the FLS2 receptor, production of nitric oxide, and the guard-cell-specific OST1 kinase. To circumvent this innate immune response, plant pathogenic bacteria have evolved specific virulence factors to effectively cause stomatal reopening as an important pathogenesis strategy. We provide evidence that supports a model in which stomata, as part of an integral innate immune system, act as a barrier against bacterial infection."

A metal ion stabilizes a kink in the mRNA that demarcates the boundary between A and P sites, which is potentially important to prevent slippage of mRNA. Metal ions also stabilize the intersubunit interface. The interactions of E-site tRNA with the 50 S subunit have both similarities and differences compared to those in the archaeal ribosome. The structure also rationalizes much biochemical and genetic data on translation."

TSC2 inhibits cell growth by acting as a GTPase-activating protein toward Rheb, thereby inhibiting mTOR, a central controller of cell growth. Here, we show that Wnt activates mTOR via inhibiting GSK3 without involving beta-catenin-dependent transcription. GSK3 inhibits the mTOR pathway by phosphorylating TSC2 in a manner dependent on AMPK-priming phosphorylation. Inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin blocks Wnt-induced cell growth and tumor development, suggesting a potential therapeutic value of rapamycin for cancers with activated Wnt signaling. Our results show that, in addition to transcriptional activation, Wnt stimulates translation and cell growth by activating the TSC-mTOR pathway. Furthermore, the sequential phosphorylation of TSC2 by AMPK and GSK3 reveals a molecular mechanism of signal integration in cell growth regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2056673958,"Sir2 is an NAD-dependent deacetylase that connects metabolism with longevity in yeast, flies, and worms. Mammals have seven Sir2 homologs (SIRT1-7). We show that SIRT4 is a mitochondrial enzyme that uses NAD to ADP-ribosylate and downregulate glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) activity. GDH is known to promote the metabolism of glutamate and glutamine, generating ATP, which promotes insulin secretion. Loss of SIRT4 in insulinoma cells activates GDH, thereby upregulating amino acid-stimulated insulin secretion. A similar effect is observed in pancreatic beta cells from mice deficient in SIRT4 or on the dietary regimen of calorie restriction (CR). Furthermore, GDH from SIRT4-deficient or CR mice is insensitive to phosphodiesterase, an enzyme that cleaves ADP-ribose, suggesting the absence of ADP-ribosylation. These results indicate that SIRT4 functions in beta cell mitochondria to repress the activity of GDH by ADP-ribosylation, thereby downregulating insulin secretion in response to amino acids, effects that are alleviated during CR."

https://openalex.org/W2065564965,"In this issue, three separate labs report the discovery of a protein that regulates ageing specifically in stem cells. This helps answer a fundamental question: why do mammalian progenitor cells gradually lose their ability to divide and generate new cells as they grow old? Norman Sharpless and colleagues generated a knockout mouse lacking tumour suppressor p16INK4a, a protein involved in cell cycle control and known to be expressed in an age-dependent manner. Studying its role in regeneration of the blood, pancreas and brain, the three groups separately found that p16INK4a is not only a biomarker, but an effector of ageing. By comparing the effect of elevated or reduced p16INK4a expression in mice, they found that p16INK4a halts proliferation of stem cells, but only in older mice. Taken together, the work suggests that p16INK4a reduces cancer incidence via its tumour suppressor action, at the same time contributing to ageing by reducing stem cell function. The work also suggests that type 2 diabetes might be linked to the failure of the pancreatic islets to renew, and that blocking this protein in certain tissues might combat some effects of ageing. Three separate labs report that p16INK4a, a protein known to be expressed in an age-dependent manner regulates ageing specifically in stem cells. Studying its role in regeneration of three different tissues, the blood, pancreas, and brain, the three groups separately found that p16INK4a is not only a biomarker, but an effector of ageing. Mammalian ageing is associated with reduced regenerative capacity in tissues that contain stem cells1,2. It has been proposed that this is at least partially caused by the senescence of progenitors with age3,4; however, it has not yet been tested whether genes associated with senescence functionally contribute to physiological declines in progenitor activity. Here we show that progenitor proliferation in the subventricular zone and neurogenesis in the olfactory bulb, as well as multipotent progenitor frequency and self-renewal potential, all decline with age in the mouse forebrain. These declines in progenitor frequency and function correlate with increased expression of p16INK4a, which encodes a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor linked to senescence5. Ageing p16INK4a-deficient mice showed a significantly smaller decline in subventricular zone proliferation, olfactory bulb neurogenesis, and the frequency and self-renewal potential of multipotent progenitors. p16INK4a deficiency did not detectably affect progenitor function in the dentate gyrus or enteric nervous system, indicating regional differences in the response of neural progenitors to increased p16INK4a expression during ageing. Declining subventricular zone progenitor function and olfactory bulb neurogenesis during ageing are thus caused partly by increasing p16INK4a expression."
https://openalex.org/W2124833370,"Rapid and reversible methods for perturbing the function of specific proteins are desirable tools for probing complex biological systems. We have developed a general technique to regulate the stability of specific proteins in mammalian cells using cell-permeable, synthetic molecules. We engineered mutants of the human FKBP12 protein that are rapidly and constitutively degraded when expressed in mammalian cells, and this instability is conferred to other proteins fused to these destabilizing domains. Addition of a synthetic ligand that binds to the destabilizing domains shields them from degradation, allowing fused proteins to perform their cellular functions. Genetic fusion of the destabilizing domain to a gene of interest ensures specificity, and the attendant small-molecule control confers speed, reversibility, and dose-dependence to this method. This general strategy for regulating protein stability should enable conditional perturbation of specific proteins with unprecedented control in a variety of experimental settings.

This general strategy for regulating protein stability should enable conditional perturbation of specific proteins with unprecedented control in a variety of experimental settings. Techniques that target gene function at the level of DNA and mRNA are general and powerful strategies for perturbing the protein products encoded by specific genes. The tet/dox and Cre/lox systems have been widely used to target various genes at the transcriptional level (Ryding et al., 2001Ryding A.D.S. Sharp M.G.F. Mullins J.J. Conditional transgenic technologies.J. Endocrinol. 2001; 171: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and RNA interference is rapidly being adopted as a method to achieve posttranscriptional gene silencing (Fire et al., 1998Fire A. Xu S. Montgomery M.K. Kostas S.A. Driver S.E. Mello C.C. Potent and specific genetic interference by double-stranded RNA in C. elegans.Nature. 1998; 391: 806-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (10946) Google Scholar, Medema, 2004Medema R.H. Optimizing RNA interference for application in mammalian cells.Biochem. J. 2004; 380: 593-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, experimental approaches to regulate proteins directly are limited, especially in mammalian cells. In certain cases, inhibitors or activators of specific proteins have been found in nature, and these reagents are often cell-permeable small molecules. Many of these molecules have found widespread use as biological probes, often because the speed, dose-dependence, and reversibility of their activities provide a useful complement to genetic techniques (Schreiber, 2003Schreiber S.L. The small-molecule approach to biology: Chemical genetics and diversity-oriented organic synthesis make possible the systematic exploration of biology.Chem. Eng. News. 2003; 81: 51-61Google Scholar). However, the question of specificity remains of the utmost importance; in many cases, proteomic analysis reveals that a small-molecule regulator of protein function targets at least one, if not many, off-target proteins (Davies et al., 2000Davies S.P.

USA. 2003; 100: 15434-15439Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Shokat and coworkers have developed a method by which a specific kinase can be inhibited using a small-molecule modulator (Shah et al., 1997Shah K. Liu Y. Deirmengian C. Shokat K.M.

Design of allele-specific inhibitors to probe protein kinase signaling.Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 257-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). This method involves genetic manipulation of the protein of interest, typically replacing a large conserved residue in the active site with a smaller glycine or alanine. Specificity is achieved by chemically modifying a previously promiscuous inhibitor with a large substituent, which prevents binding to kinases lacking the cavity-forming mutation. This approach has been successful both in cultured cells and in mice (Bishop et al., 2000Bishop A.C. Ubersax J.A. Petsch D.T. Matheos D.P. Gray N.S. Blethrow J. Shimizu E. Tsien J.Z. Schultz P.G.

A chemical-genetic approach to studying neurotrophin signaling.Neuron. 2005; 46: 13-21Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar); however, it is limited to ATPases and GTPases. Although the relatively large size of the kinase family makes this approach fairly general, additional methods are required in order to probe the functions of a wider array of proteins. To this end, investigators have devised alternative strategies to perturb protein function by taking advantage of existing cellular processes (Banaszynski and Wandless, 2006Banaszynski L.A. Wandless T.J. Conditional control of protein function.Chem. Biol. 2006; 13: 11-21Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Varshavsky and coworkers' recognition that a protein's intrinsic stability is in part dependent upon its N-terminal residue (Bachmair et al., 1986Bachmair A. Finley D. Varshavsky A. In vivo half-life of a protein is a function of its amino-terminal residue.Science. 1986; 234: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1301) Google Scholar) resulted in the genesis of several methods to control the function of a protein of interest in a general manner. Szostak and coworkers showed that a small peptide sequence could be fused to the N terminus of a protein of interest, and that fusion of this degron resulted in decreased stability of that protein in yeast (Park et al., 1992Park E.-C. Finley D. Szostak J.W. A strategy for the generation of conditional mutations by protein destabilization.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1992; 89: 1249-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Varshavsky and coworkers then isolated a temperature-sensitive dihydrofolate reductase degron with a greatly reduced half-life at nonpermissive temperatures (Dohmen et al., 1994Dohmen R.J. Wu P. Varsahvsky A. Heat-inducible degron: a method for constructing temperature-sensitive mutants.Science. 1994; 263: 1273-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), enabling studies of essential proteins in yeast (Labib et al., 2000Labib K.

Uninterrupted MCM2-7 function required for DNA replication fork progression.Science. 2000; 288: 1643-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, Kanemaki et al., 2003Kanemaki M. Sanchez-Diaz A. Gambus A. Labib K. Functional proteomic identification of DNA replication proteins by induced proteolysis in vivo.Nature. 2003; 423: 720-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). More recently, several researchers have engineered systems in which dimeric small molecules are used to conditionally target fusion proteins for degradation through induced localization to either an E3 ligase complex or to the proteasome itself (Schneekloth et al., 2004Schneekloth J.S. Fonseca F.N. Koldobskiy M. Mandal A. Deshaies R. Sakamoto K. Crews C.M. Chemical genetic control of protein levels: selective in vivo targeted degradation.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 3748-3754Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, Janse et al., 2004Janse D.M. Crosas B. Finley D. Church G.M. Localization to the proteasome is sufficient for degradation.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21415-21420Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). However, these systems either require a prior knowledge of high-affinity ligands for the protein of interest or are restricted to engineered yeast strains. An alternative approach for controlling protein function is to perturb subcellular localization. Several technologies achieve small-molecule regulation of protein localization by taking advantage of the FKBP•rapamycin•FRB ternary complex (Kohler and Bertozzi, 2003Kohler J.J. Bertozzi C.R. Regulating cell surface glycosylation by small molecule control of enzyme location.Chem. Biol. 2003; 10: 1303-1331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, Inoue et al., 2005Inoue T. Heo W.D. Grimley J.S. Wandless T.J. Meyer T. Inducible translocation strategy to rapidly activate and inhibit small GTPase signaling pathways.Nat. Methods. 2005; 2: 415-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Fusions of proteins of interest can be made to either FKBP or a small domain of the mTOR protein called FRB, and colocalization is induced upon addition of the small molecule rapamycin. Because of rapamycin's inherent biological activity, researchers have developed a “bump-hole” strategy similar to that employed by Shokat and coworkers. Rapamycin derivatives possessing large substituents at the FRB binding interface bind poorly to wild-type FRB and in turn bind poorly to the biologically relevant target mTOR, with binding restored upon introduction of compensatory cavity-forming mutations in FRB. Specifically, a C20-methallyl-rapamycin derivative (MaRap) binds to a triple mutant of FRB called FRB∗ (Liberles et al., 1997Liberles S.D. Diver S.T. Austin D.J. Schreiber S.L. Inducible gene expression and protein translocation using nontoxic ligands identified by a mammalian three-hybrid screen.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1997; 94: 7825-7830Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). We recently fused GSK-3β to FRB∗ with the goal of using MaRap to conditionally mislocalize GSK-3β from the nucleus (Stankunas et al., 2003Stankunas K. Bayle J.H. Gestwicki J.E. Lin Y.-L. Wandless T.J. Crabtree G.R. Conditional protein alleles using knockin mice and a chemical inducer of dimerization.Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1615-1624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we noticed decreased levels of the GSK-3β-FRB∗ fusion relative to an otherwise identical fusion with wild-type FRB. Levels of the FRB∗ fusion protein were rescued upon addition of MaRap. Although fusion to FRB∗ confers instability to multiple different proteins in the absence of MaRap, this chance observation of conditional stabilization is less than ideal. First, two proteins (FKBP and FRB) are required to stabilize the protein of interest. A second and more troubling problem is that of the ligand itself. MaRap is expensive, difficult to synthesize and formulate, and exhibits poor pharmacokinetics in vivo. The inaccessibility of the stabilizing ligand makes widespread implementation of this technology unlikely. Nevertheless, FRB∗ serves as proof-of-concept that the ligand-dependent stability of one protein can predictably affect the stability of a fused partner protein. We thus set out to develop a “single ligand-single domain” system that would allow conditional small-molecule control of protein stability. We envisioned the fusion of any protein of interest to a ligand binding domain that is engineered to be unstable, and thus degraded, in the absence of its ligand. Binding of the ligand to this destabilizing domain would stabilize the fusion protein and shield it from degradation, thus restoring function to the protein of interest (Figure 1A). Ideally, this destabilizing domain would be capable of conferring ligand-dependent stability to a wide variety of proteins, thus achieving generality. We chose the FK506- and rapamycin-binding protein (FKBP12) as a candidate destabilizing domain. This 107 residue protein has been widely studied, often in the context of fusion proteins, and dozens of high-affinity ligands for FKBP12 have been developed (Pollock and Clackson, 2002Pollock R. Clackson T. Dimerizer-regulated gene expression.Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2002; 13: 459-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In one study, ligands that possess a synthetic “bump” in the FKBP12 binding domain were shown to bind more tightly to the cavity-forming F36V mutant relative to the wild-type protein by almost three orders of magnitude (Clackson et al., 1998Clackson T. Yang W. Rozamus L.W. Hatada M. Amara J.F. Rollins C.T. Stevenson L.F. Magari S.R. Wood S.A. Courage N.L. et al.Redesigning an FKBP-ligand interface to generate chemical dimerizers with novel specificity.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1998; 95: 10437-10442Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Importantly, this family of ligands does not elicit any undesired responses when administered to cultured cells or animals including humans (Iuliucci et al., 2001Iuliucci J.D. Oliver S.D. Morley S. Ward C. Ward J. Dalgarno D. Clackson T. Berger H.J. Intravenous safety and pharmacokinetics of a novel dimerizer drug, AP1903, in healthy volunteers.J. Clin. Pharmacol. 2001; 41: 870-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To identify mutants that display the desired ligand-dependent behavior, we implemented a cell-based screen in which the fluorescence of yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) served as an indicator of FKBP12 stability. A library based on the FKBP12 F36V gene sequence (hereafter FKBP) was generated using error-prone PCR and then cloned in-frame in front of YFP. A Moloney murine leukemia retroviral expression system was used to stably integrate this library of FKBP-YFP fusions into NIH3T3 fibroblasts, and the transduced cells were subjected to three rounds of sorting using flow cytometry. In the first round, cells were treated with 5 μM of the FKBP ligand SLF∗ (Figure 1B) for 24 hr prior to sorting. Fluorescent cells were collected and further cultured in the absence of ligand for 60 hr. Reanalysis revealed that approximately 5% of the cell population exhibited decreased fluorescence levels, indicating that the majority of the sequences were either unmutated or contained mutations that did not affect stability of the fusion protein. This small population of cells exhibiting decreased fluorescence was collected and cultured once more in the presence of 5 μM SLF∗ for 24 hr, at which time YFP-expressing cells were collected and the genomic DNA was isolated. Sequence analysis of 72 FKBP clones (see Table S1 in the Supplemental Data) revealed several frequently recurring mutations. Mutations were distributed fairly evenly over the primary amino acid sequence, and localized clustering on the tertiary structure was not observed. All observed sequences maintained the F36V mutation and the majority were spatially separated from the ligand binding site, suggesting that ligand binding was crucial for selection. Before analyzing the behavior of the individual mutants, we synthesized a derivative of SLF∗ in which the carboxylic acid is replaced with a morpholine group (Figure 1B). This functional group is commonly appended to drug-like molecules to improve their pharmacokinetic properties, and we hypothesized that its addition to SLF∗ in a position known not to interfere with FKBP binding would enhance intracellular availability and improve the potency of the stabilizing ligand. This cell-permeable FKBP ligand is designed to protect an otherwise unstable protein domain from degradation, so we call the morpholine-containing ligand Shield-1 (Shld1). To validate the screening method and to further characterize ligand-responsive destabilizing domains, we chose five mutants (F15S, V24A, H25R, E60G, and L106P) for further analysis. Each mutant was separately transduced into NIH3T3 cells, and YFP fluorescence levels were measured in the absence of Shld1 (Figure 2A). All five mutants showed decreased fluorescence levels with respect to a positive control, indicating that the mutants identified from the library screen are indeed destabilizing. The mutants exhibit varying degrees of destabilization, with the most destabilizing mutant, L106P, expressing YFP fluorescence at a level of only 1%–2% relative to the positive control. All mutants showed increased fluorescence upon addition of Shld1 (see Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data), with observed efficiencies of rescue varying by over an order of magnitude (Figure 2B). Mutant V24A showed the most efficient rescue (EC50 ∼5 nM), whereas the more destabilizing L106P required higher concentrations of Shld1 (EC50 ∼100 nM) to stabilize the YFP fusion protein. In a kinetic study of NIH3T3 cells stably expressing each destabilizing domain, we observed that YFP fluorescence for all five mutants increased at approximately the same rate upon addition of Shld1, with maximum fluorescence achieved at 24 hr and stably maintained for at least an additional 48 hr without further dosing of Shld1 (Figure S2). These results imply that, upon addition of Shld1, these FKBP mutants are able to adopt a conformation that approximates the stability of the wild-type protein, and that increases in fluorescence are mainly a function of the rate of protein synthesis and/or YFP maturation within the cell. In a related experiment, NIH3T3 cells transduced with the FKBP L106P-YFP fusion (hereafter L106P-YFP) were treated with various concentrations of Shld1, and YFP fluorescence was monitored as a function of time (Figure 2C). YFP expression is observed within 15 min, and we observe that when cells are incubated with lower concentrations of Shld1 they achieve steady state expression levels more rapidly than cells that have been incubated with higher concentrations of Shld1. We next assayed the five destabilizing domains for kinetics of protein degradation. Upon withdrawal of Shld1, we observed distinct differences in fluorescence decay profiles among the destabilizing domains (Figure 2D). This study revealed a correlation between the rate of degradation and the degree of destabilization conferred by each mutation. Mutant H25R, which is the least destabilizing of this group, showed the slowest rate of degradation, whereas L106P, the most destabilizing of the five, was degraded most quickly, with protein levels becoming negligible within 4 hr. To correlate YFP fluorescence with intracellular protein levels, and to look for evidence of partial proteolysis, cells stably expressing each destabilizing domain fused to YFP were either mock-treated or treated with Shld1. Antibodies against either FKBP12 (Figure 2E) or YFP (data not shown) were used to immunoblot cell lysates. Neither antibody was capable of detecting protein in lysates from mock-treated cells expressing the mutant FKBP-YFP fusions, whereas Shld1-treated cells showed strong expression of the expected fusion proteins, which correlated with the observed fluorescence levels. F15S and L106P fusions to YFP were also monitored using fluorescence microscopy, and the predicted Shld1-dependent fluorescence is observed (Figure S3). To gain additional insight into this inducible degradation system and to understand possible limitations thereof, we examined the mechanism of degradation for the F15S and L106P mutants. The ubiquitin-proteasome system is a major mediator of intracellular protein degradation (Pickart, 2004Pickart C.M. Back to the future with ubiquitin.Cell. 2004; 116: 181-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar), so we treated cells expressing either F15S or L106P fusions to YFP with either MG132 (Figure 2F) or lactacystin (Figure S4). Following withdrawal of Shld1, the inability of cells to degrade the fusions in the presence of proteasome inhibitors suggests that the degradation of the YFP fusion proteins is mediated, at least in part, by the proteasome. RNA interference (RNAi) has become a widely used tool for reducing intracellular levels of a protein of interest, so we wanted to compare the rate of RNAi-mediated silencing of an endogenous gene to the rate of degradation achieved through fusion of a protein of interest to a destabilizing domain. Lamin A/C is a nonessential cytoskeletal protein commonly used as a control in RNAi experiments. Previous studies have shown more than 90% reduction in lamin A/C expression in HeLa cells assayed 40 to 45 hr after transfection with a cognate siRNA duplex (Elbashir et al., 2001Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Duplexes of 21-nucleotide RNAs mediate RNA interference in cultured mammalian cells.Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (7837) Google Scholar). This suggests that the half-life of the lamin A/C proteins is no more than 10 to 12 hr, which is significantly shorter than that of green fluorescent protein (t1/2 = 26 hr, Corish and Tyler-Smith, 1999Corish P. Tyler-Smith C. Attenuation of green fluorescent protein half-life in mammalian cells.Protein Eng. 1999; 12: 1035-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). When HeLa cells were transfected with siRNA against lamin A/C, we began to observe a decrease in protein levels after 24 hr, with a significant reduction in lamin A/C observed by 48 hr (Figure 2G, Figure S5). In contrast, cells stably expressing L106P-YFP show nearly complete degradation of the fusion within 4 hr of removal of Shld1, illustrating that fusion of a destabilizing domain to a protein of interest dramatically reduces its stability in cultured cells. Taken together, these data show that we have identified ligand-sensitive mutants of FKBP, and they further suggest that we may be able to predictably regulate YFP levels with excellent temporal control. To test this theory, we subjected a population of NIH3T3 cells stably expressing L106P-YFP to various concentrations of Shld1 over the course of 1 week (Figure 3). The dose-dependent control that this technology offers is exemplified by the proximity of the observed fluorescence levels to values predicted from the dose-response experiments shown in Figure 2B. This level of control could prove invaluable when the biological function of a protein of interest depends upon its intracellular concentration (Niwa et al., 2000Niwa H. Miyazaki J. Smith A.G.

Genet. 2000; 24: 372-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (2785) Google Scholar, Pan et al., 2005Pan X. Ohneda O. Ohneda K. Lindeboom F. Iwata F. Shimizu R. Nagano M. Suwabe N. Philipsen S.

Chem. 2005; 280: 22385-22394Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Many proteins can accommodate fusions at their N termini without loss of function; however, in some cases the intrinsic protein structure or requirements for posttranslational modifications may prohibit N-terminal fusions. Reversing the orientation of FKBP and YFP, we performed a screen of a YFP-FKBP library to identify several candidate C-terminal destabilizing domains (Table S2). From these candidate domains, we chose six FKBP mutants (M66T, R71G, D100G, D100N, E102G, and K105I) for further analysis. At the same time, we tested the ability of the L106P destabilizing domain to confer ligand-dependent stability when placed at the C terminus of a protein of interest. Overall, destabilizing domains fused to the C terminus of YFP are less destabilizing than their N-terminal counterparts (Table S3). For example, when the L106P mutant is fused to the N terminus of YFP (L106P-YFP), fluorescence is only ∼1%–2% of that observed in the presence of Shld1; however, when the orientation is reversed (YFP-L106P), fluorescence in the absence of Shld1 is ∼10% of that observed in its presence. Interestingly, L106P at the C terminus of YFP is as destabilizing as any mutant identified through our screening process. Both C-terminal and N-terminal destabilizing domains respond similarly to Shld1, with EC50s ranging from 10 nM to 100 nM (Figure S6). As observed with N-terminal destabilizing domains, all mutants exhibit nearly identical rates of increase in fluorescence upon addition of Shld1, regardless of the degree of instability conferred (Figure S7). Again, rates of fluorescence decay upon removal of Shld1 could be correlated with the relative degree of destabilization conferred by each mutant (Figure S8), with levels of the most destabilizing domains (D100G and L106P) becoming negligible within 8 hr. These destabilizing domains appear to be quite effective in the context of transduced fibroblasts, so we wanted to ensure that the same behavior would be observed upon transient introduction of the fusions into a variety of different cell types. We therefore tested our destabilizing domains fused to either the N or C terminus of YFP in several commonly used cell lines (NIH3T3, HEK 293T, HeLa, and COS-1) using transient transfection to introduce the chimeric gene. Shld1-dependent fluorescence is observed (Table 1), demonstrating that ligand-dependent stability is not restricted to one cell type. Additionally, these FKBP-derived destabilizing domains can be stabilized by commercially available ligands such as FK506 (Figure S9), keeping in mind that FK506, unlike Shld1, will perturb the cellular environment by inhibiting calcineurin.Table 1Fluorescence of FKBP-YFP Fusions in the Absence of Shld1 in Transiently Transfected Cell LinesPercent residual YFP fluorescence∗Data are presented as the average mean fluorescence intensity relative to that of the maximum fluorescence intensity observed for the individual mutant.

The experiment was performed in duplicate. Open table in a new tab Although the FKBP mutants are efficient destabilizing domains for YFP, it was unclear if this behavior could be used to target other proteins of interest that perform more relevant cellular functions. In choosing candidates, we aimed to target proteins of various characteristics (e.g., size, fold, function, and cellular localization). Using the F15S and L106P destabilizing domains fused at the N termini, Shld1-dependent stability is conferred to the kinases GSK-3β and CDK1, the cell cycle regulatory proteins securin and p21, and three small GTPases, Rac1, RhoA, and Cdc42 (Figure 4A). Interestingly, we were able to induce degradation of an otherwise stable protein (CDK1) and stabilize relatively short-lived cell cycle regulators (p21 and securin), proteins that are normally targeted for degradation by the APC complex (Nigg, 2001Nigg E.A. Mitotic kinases as regulators of cell division and its checkpoints.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar). When either the D100G or L106P destabilizing domain was fused to the C terminus of the transcription factor CREB or the small GTPases Arf6 and Arl7, we observed Shld1-dependent stability of these fusion proteins (Figure 4B). To date, we have tested 14 proteins and all have shown ligand-dependent stability when expressed in NIH3T3 cells. The ability to regulate the function of membrane-bound proteins would allow greater understanding of a range of physiological processes. When CD8α, a transmembrane glycoprotein found on the surface of T cells, was fused at its C terminus to either the D100G or L106P destabilizing domain and expressed in NIH3T3 cells, we were able to elicit Shld1-dependent expression as assayed by flow cytometry (Figure 5). We observed a decrease in CD8α levels at the cell surface upon removal of Shld1, suggesting that the FKBP destabilizing domains possess the ability to recruit the cellular proteins necessary for internalization of membrane-bound proteins (Hicke and Dunn, 2003Hicke L.

Yet El Niño events have not always produced severe droughts. We show that El Niño events with the warmest sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the central equatorial Pacific are more effective in focusing drought-producing subsidence over India than events with the warmest SSTs in the eastern equatorial Pacific. The physical basis for such different impacts is established using atmospheric general circulation model experiments forced with idealized tropical Pacific warmings. These findings have important implications for Indian monsoon forecasting.

Mutations in presenilins 1 and 2 (PS1 and PS2) account for approximately 40% of familial AD (FAD) cases. FAD mutations and genetic deletions of presenilins have been associated with calcium (Ca(2+)) signaling abnormalities. We demonstrate that wild-type presenilins, but not PS1-M146V and PS2-N141I FAD mutants, can form low-conductance divalent-cation-permeable ion channels in planar lipid bilayers. In experiments with PS1/2 double knockout (DKO) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), we find that presenilins account for approximately 80% of passive Ca(2+) leak from the endoplasmic reticulum. Deficient Ca(2+) signaling in DKO MEFs can be rescued by expression of wild-type PS1 or PS2 but not by expression of PS1-M146V or PS2-N141I mutants. The ER Ca(2+) leak function of presenilins is independent of their gamma-secretase activity. Our data suggest a Ca(2+) signaling function for presenilins and provide support for the ""Ca(2+) hypothesis of AD."""

Prokaryotes sense environmental stimuli through modular, dimeric transmembrane receptors, whose extra- and intracellular parts are often connected by a HAMP domain, located invariably at the C-terminal end of the last transmembrane segment. HAMP domains were originally discovered by Inouye and coworkers (Jin and Inouye, 1994Jin T. Inouye M. Transmembrane signaling. Mutational analysis of the cytoplasmic linker region of Taz1-1, a Tar-EnvZ chimeric receptor in Escherichia coli.J. Mol.

Lett. 1999; 176: 111-116Crossref PubMed Google Scholar for their occurrence in histidine kinases, adenylyl cyclases, methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins, and phosphatases. Currently, over one-fifth of histidine kinases and two-thirds of chemotaxis receptors annotated in the SMART database contain HAMP domains. Proteins containing HAMP domains are also found in fungi, plants, and protists, presumably due to lateral gene transfer from the endosymbiotic ancestors of mitochondria and chloroplasts (Koretke et al., 2000Koretke K.K. Lupas A.N. Warren P.V. Rosenberg M. Brown J.R. Evolution of two-component signal transduction.Mol. Biol. Evol. 2000; 17: 1956-1970Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The sequences of HAMP domains show a repeating seven-residue pattern, whose positions are labeled a–g and in which hydrophobic residues occupy positions a and d (Figure 1). This pattern corresponds to the heptad periodicity postulated by Crick as the hallmark of coiled-coil structure (Crick, 1953Crick F.H.C. The packing of α-helices: simple coiled-coils.Acta Crystallogr. 1953; 6: 689-697Crossref Google Scholar). Computational methods have also pointed to an elevated coiled coil-forming potential in the corresponding region of histidine kinases (Singh et al., 1998Singh M. Berger B. Kim P.S. Berger J.M. Cochran A.G. Computational learning reveals coiled coil-like motifs in histidine kinase linker domains.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1998; 95: 2738-2743Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). It has therefore been generally accepted that the HAMP domain consists of two amphipathic helices with coiled-coil properties, in agreement with the results of cysteine scans (Butler and Falke, 1998Butler S.L. Falke J.J. Cysteine and disulfide scanning reveals two amphiphilic helices in the linker region of the aspartate chemoreceptor.Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10746-10756Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Sequence conservation of the domain is not strong and includes no invariant residues. HAMP domains can be exchanged between receptors, e.g., between the histidine kinase EnvZ and the chemotaxis receptor Tar (Utsumi et al., 1989Utsumi R. Brissette R.E. Rampersaud A. Forst S.A.

Chem. 2003; 278: 22812-22819Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These phenotypes have been explained by the following two modes of action of the HAMP domains: mechanical, in relaying conformational changes between two domains (cis signaling); and interactive, by specific binding to effector domains (trans signaling). The interchangeable nature of HAMP domains suggests that both modes of action stem from a common mechanism. HAMP is the last widely occurring domain of prokaryotic transmembrane receptors for which no structure is known (the structures of the cytoplasmic domains from mycobacterial adenylyl cyclases, various histidine kinases, and the serine chemoreceptor either naturally lacked the HAMP domain or were constructed to omit it). Its structure is of particular interest for understanding signal propagation across the membrane because it is continuous with the last membrane-spanning helix of a wide range of sensory modules. The planarity of the membrane limits motion that transmembrane helices can undergo during signal transduction to the following four types: translation in the plane of the membrane (association/dissociation), translation perpendicular to the membrane (piston motion), rotation along an axis parallel to the membrane (pivot motion), and rotation along an axis perpendicular to the membrane. We have determined the solution structure of an archaeal HAMP domain by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and present a model for its mechanism of signal transduction. Our results are only compatible with a propagation of the signal by rotation along an axis perpendicular to the membrane. The gene region between base pairs 1356672 and 1359698 of the Archaeoglobus fulgidus genome contains four genes on the minus strand, af1505–1502, which appear to be organized as an operon (see Supplemental Data). The first gene, af1505, encodes a member of the solute carrier family 41, classified as the Mg2+-transporter-E family (9.A.19) in the Transport Classification Database (TCDB, www.tcdb.org). The other three genes are translationally coupled and may constitute a regulatory system for the permease. One of these genes encodes a putative transmembrane receptor, Af1503, which is unusual in containing a HAMP domain as its sole cytoplasmic part. The lack of potential structural constraints from further cytoplasmic domains and its origin from a hyperthermophile suggested that this HAMP domain might form a stable protein suited for structure determination. We expressed the domain corresponding to residues S278–E331 in Escherichia coli and obtained a soluble dimer of 13 kDa, as expected from the dimeric nature of prokaryotic transmembrane receptors. Circular dichroism measurements and thermal denaturation studies (Tm of 59°C) indicated a stable, well-folded protein (see Supplemental Data). This construct proved amenable for structure determination by NMR. Spectra of Af1503 HAMP showed a single set of signals, indicating a symmetric structure. Full backbone and aliphatic side-chain resonance assignments were available, except for the amide protons of S278, T279, and A309, which were lacking presumably due to rapid exchange with solvent. Assignments were also obtained for the aromatic resonances of H305 and for the HNɛ resonances of R308 and R323. The structural data consisted of distance restraints derived from several 2D and 3D NOESY spectra, J-coupling constants, and chemical shift-derived backbone torsion angle restraints. To distinguish inter- from intramolecular contacts, an asymmetrically 13C/15N-labeled dimer was used (see Experimental Procedures). The initial model incorporating these data was the starting point for iterative assignments of further NOE connectivities resulting in the final set of experimental restraints (Table 1). The structure was well defined, with an rmsd for the final set of 22 dimeric structures (residues T282–Y325) of 0.14 Å for backbone atoms and 0.56 Å for all heavy atoms (Figure 2). The final structure set also has very low restraint violations, with no violation of distance restraints greater than 0.1 Å (Table 1).Table 1Structural Statistics and Atomic RmsdA.

Open table in a new tab The dimer forms a parallel, four-helical coiled coil. The two helices of each monomer (α1 and α2) are of equal length, offset by one helical turn and connected in a righthanded way by a loop of 13 residues (G297–A309) (Figure 2, Figure 3). But for its opposite handedness, this topology resembles the helix-loop-helix domain of basic-region transcription factors, on which HAMP has been previously modeled (Koretke et al., 2003Koretke K.K. Volker C. Bower M.L. Lupas A.N. In Histidine Kinases In Signal Transduction.in: Inouye M. Dutta R. Academic Press, New York2003: 483-506Google Scholar). The 13 residues of the connector assume a largely extended conformation to span the 26 Å distance between the ends of the helices, from which L299, P304, and Q306 deviate to cause a series of β turns. The connector is tightly packed into the groove between the two helices, reflecting conserved features of HAMP sequences (Figure 1): small side-chain sizes for residues pointing into the interface and hydrophobic contacts between L299–L326 and V303–I319/E320. The sharp reverse turn required at the N-terminal end of the connector is made possible by a conserved glycine residue (G297). At its C-terminal end, the connector leads into a conserved D310-E-x-G313 motif, which serves as a capping sequence for α2 and forms a ring of interacting residues with P283, I284, and I312 as the most conserved region in all HAMP domains. In addition, residues in the connector participate in several salt-bridge and hydrogen bond interactions, which are not conserved (e.g., Q306–V303, R308–D310, and H305–E286) and presumably contribute to the thermostability of the Af1503 domain. The connector shows somewhat higher flexibility than the helical core, as evidenced by elevated transverse relaxation times. However, the 15N{1H}-heteronuclear NOE values are only slightly lower than those for the helices, and therefore the amplitude of motions on fast (picosecond) timescales must be low (see Supplemental Data). The helices of the HAMP domain have crossing angles of 3°–13° within a monomer and 10°–15° relative to the central axis of the bundle; these values are typical for four-helical coiled coils. However, the packing of core residues has an unusual geometry. From the strong heptad periodicity of hydrophobic residues (Figure 1), we expected knobs-into-holes packing, long considered the defining feature of coiled coils (Crick, 1953Crick F.H.C. The packing of α-helices: simple coiled-coils.Acta Crystallogr. 1953; 6: 689-697Crossref Google Scholar, Gruber and Lupas, 2003Gruber M. Lupas A.N. Historical review: another 50th anniversary–new periodicities in coiled coils.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 679-685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). This geometry specifies the packing of a residue from one helix (knob) into a space surrounded by four side chains of the facing helix (hole). Thus, symmetry-related hydrophobic residues are arranged side-by-side to form layers throughout the core of coiled coils (Figure 4, right). In the HAMP domain, however, symmetry-related residues of the hydrophobic core assume knobs-to-knobs packing. This packing is normally associated with coiled coils whose sequence deviates from the heptad repeat. Knobs-to-knobs packing has two distinct geometries, the x-layer, in which side chains point straight at the central supercoil axis, and the da-layer, in which side chains point sideways to form an interacting ring of residues enclosing a central cavity (for a detailed description of coiled-coil nomenclature, see Experimental Procedures). In the HAMP domain x- and da-layers alternate along the helices, and tight packing is achieved by offsetting the helices and combining the x-layers of α1 with the da-layers of α2 and vice versa, thus forming mixed x-da layers (layer 1: x I284 - da E311/I312; layer 2: da L287/S288 - x L315; layer 3: x A291– da S318/I319; layer 4: da I294/A295 - x L322; Figure 3, Figure 4). We designate this packing mode as “complementary x-da.” A similar packing mode has only been observed naturally in the tetramerization domain of the Lac repressor (1LBI, residues 335–357 [Solan et al., 2002Solan A. Ratia K. Fairman R. Exploring the role of alanine in the structure of the Lac repressor tetramerization domain, a ferritin-like Alacoil.J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 601-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar]), where it however specifies an antiparallel orientation of the helices (Alberti et al., 1993Alberti S. Oehler S. von Wilcken-Bergmann B. Müller-Hill B. Genetic analysis of the leucine heptad repeats of Lac repressor: evidence for a 4-helical bundle.EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3227-3236Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), which is energetically more favorable when the helices are identical. The knobs-into-holes and complementary x-da packing geometries are nearly isoenergetic, as judged from the small number of mutations necessary to convert one into the other. Their primary difference lies in the number of residues needed to form the hydrophobic core; complementary x-da packing uses three positions per heptad repeat, whereas canonical coiled coils use two. In the Lac repressor, the core is formed by positions a, d, and e, and mutation of residues in position e to hydrophilic residues is sufficient to convert the structure to a canonical coiled coil (Alberti et al., 1993Alberti S. Oehler S. von Wilcken-Bergmann B. Müller-Hill B. Genetic analysis of the leucine heptad repeats of Lac repressor: evidence for a 4-helical bundle.EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3227-3236Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This transition in core packing has also been engineered into the GCN4 leucine zipper, converting the structure from knobs-into-holes packing to complementary x-da by either mutating residues in position g to hydrophobic residues, thus creating an a-d-g core (Deng et al., 2006Deng Y. Liu J. Zheng Q. Eliezer D. Kallenbach N.R. Lu M. Antiparallel four-stranded coiled coil specified by a 3-3-1 hydrophobic heptad repeat.Structure. 2006; 14: 247-255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), or by mutating a single glutamate in position e to cysteine, thus creating an a-d-e core (Yadav et al., 2006Yadav M.K. Leman L.J. Price D.J. Brooks III, C.L. Stout C.D. Ghadiri M.R. Coiled coils at the edge of configurational heterogeneity. Structural analyses of parallel and antiparallel homotetrameric coiled coils reveal configurational sensitivity to a single solvent-exposed amino acid substitution.Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 4463-4473Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Indeed, mutating this glutamate to serine has made it possible to obtain the structure of both packing forms for the same sequence, by using different crystallization conditions (Yadav et al., 2006Yadav M.K. Leman L.J. Price D.J. Brooks III, C.L. Stout C.D. Ghadiri M.R. Coiled coils at the edge of configurational heterogeneity. Structural analyses of parallel and antiparallel homotetrameric coiled coils reveal configurational sensitivity to a single solvent-exposed amino acid substitution.Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 4463-4473Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In all these cases, the change from knobs-into-holes to complementary x-da packing was accompanied by a change from a parallel to an antiparallel helix orientation in the coiled coil. In the case of HAMP, though, the complementary x-da structure is already in a parallel orientation and the transition to canonical packing could thus be achieved without a change in helix orientation, by a concerted rotation of 26° in all four helices (Figure 4). Since both packing modes involve the interdigitation of side chains, which gives HAMP the character of a gear box with four cogwheels, neighboring helices must rotate in the opposite direction (Figure 4). Given that knobs-into-holes packing is symmetric, it follows that the complementary x-da packing of HAMP must be asymmetric. That is exactly what we observed: whereas α1 contributes positions a, d, and e to the core, α2 contributes a, d, and g. In contrast, the cores of the Lac repressor and the engineered GCN4 mutants are formed by the same three positions in all four helices. Based on these observations, we propose that HAMP transduces signals by alternating between the observed structure and a canonical coiled coil, and that its conformational output is a rotation of downstream elements by 26°. Such a conformational change requires that the two structures be of nearly equivalent stability and that their interconversion energy be low. In order to achieve this balance, the HAMP domain appears to contain two sets of features, each favoring one packing mode at the expense of the other. As noted above, only two positions of the heptad repeat are hydrophobic, a property known to favor knobs-into-holes interactions and not favor complementary x-da packing. In searching for a feature with the opposite effect, we noted A291, which is much smaller than all other core residues of Af1503 HAMP. As seen from the average side-chain size plot in Figure 1, this size discrepancy is conserved in HAMP domains. Small residues are known to favor knobs-to-knobs packing (Gernert et al., 1995Gernert K.M. Surles M.C. Labean T.H. Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C.

The structure of alpha-helical coiled coils.Adv. Protein Chem. 2005; 70: 37-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar), and, indeed, increasing the side-chain size of this residue to valine causes a biased phenotype in two histidine kinases, EnvZ (Tokishita et al., 1992Tokishita S. Kojima A. Mizuno T. Transmembrane signal transduction and osmoregulation in Escherichia coli: functional importance of the transmembrane regions of membrane-located protein kinase, EnvZ.J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 111: 707-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and NarX (Appleman and Stewart, 2003Appleman J.A. Stewart V. Mutational analysis of a conserved signal-transducing element: the HAMP linker of the Escherichia coli nitrate sensor NarX.J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), both of which naturally contain alanine at this position. Because of its phenotype in EnvZ and NarX, we introduced the A291V mutation into Af1503 HAMP. The mutation had a profound effect on the stability of the protein, increasing its midpoint of thermal denaturation by 18°C (see Supplemental Data). This suggested to us that wild-type and mutant indeed had different conformations. Thus we undertook a full structural study of this mutant. The 15N-HSQC spectrum of Af1503 HAMP A291V yielded a single set of signals, with considerable differences relative to wild-type (see Supplemental Data). The diffusion time of the mutant was identical to that of the wild-type domain, pointing to a dimeric, compactly folded structure. Full resonance assignment was completed, and local NOE contacts showed that the mutant retained a parallel helical structure, with the helices preserving their length and the connector adopting a similar conformation (see Supplemental Data). However, the inter- and intramolecular helical contacts could not be resolved to a single structure. Thus the domain appeared to undergo considerable internal motions on a submillisecond timescale. This was confirmed by dynamics studies that showed a temperature- and field-dependent line broadening in the mutant but not in the wild-type. This broadening was reflected in shorter transverse relaxation times (T2) for most residues of the mutant (see Supplemental Data). A partial aggregation of the mutant leading to higher effective molecular weight was excluded by the identical diffusion rates of both mutant and wild-type domains at lower temperatures. From these data we conclude that, whereas the wild-type is primarily present in one form at room temperature, the A291V mutant oscillates rapidly between two forms. Although we cannot resolve the spectra of the A291V mutant to a single structure, we can derive a number of important constraints for the alternate form. Thus, the four-helical bundle remains intact, and the helices maintain the same register. This is not compatible with two wide-spread models for HAMP activity, one proposing a piston motion of the helices perpendicular to the plane of the membrane, which requires changes in the helical register (Kim et al., 1999Kim K.K.

Side chains at the membrane-water interface modulate the signaling state of a transmembrane receptor.Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 1763-1770Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and the other proposing a disassembly of the helical bundle and a peripheral association of the N-terminal helix with the membrane (Williams and Stewart, 1999Williams S.B. Stewart V. Functional similarities among two-component sensors and methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins suggest a role for linker region amphipathic helices in transmembrane signal transduction.Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 1093-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Also, the similar hydrogen exchange rates for wild-type and mutant are not compatible with signal transduction by partial unfolding of the helices or formation of a molten globule (Bordignon et al., 2005Bordignon E. Klare J.P. Doebber M. Wegener A.A. Martell S. Engelhard M. Steinhoff H.J. Structural analysis of a HAMP domain: the linker region of the phototransducer in complex with sensory rhodopsin II.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 38767-38775Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, the NOEs we obtained for the A291V mutant are compatible with an in-register rotation of the helices (see Supplemental Data). In order to explore the structural transition of Af1503 HAMP in vitro and in vivo, we generated fusions to the mycobacterial adenylyl cyclase Rv3645 and to the E. coli aspartate chemoreceptor, Tar (see Experimental Procedures). The catalytic domain of the mycobacterial adenylyl cyclase Rv3645 is linked via a HAMP domain to a hexahelical membrane anchor and requires dimerization for activity (Linder et al., 2004Linder J.U. Hammer A. Schultz J.E. The effect of HAMP domains on class IIIb adenylyl cyclases from Mycobacterium tuberculosis.Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 2446-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We coupled the Af1503 HAMP domain (residues 278–331) to the catalytic domain of Rv3645 (residues 331–549) and obtained a chimera with a 2.2-fold higher Vmax of the cyclase than that of a construct containing the endogenous HAMP domain (residues 279–549, Figures 5A and 5B). The ATP concentration required for half-maximal activity (SC50) was reduced 12-fold in the chimera (from 2.7 mM to 230 μM ATP) indicating an increased substrate affinity. In contrast, a mutant chimera carrying the A291V mutation was 62% less active than the unmutated chimera (Figure 5B). This was due to a significant decrease in Vmax and an increase in SC50 to 750 μM ATP. These results bear out the expectation that Af1503 HAMP and Af1503 HAMP A291V would affect adenylyl cyclase activity in opposite directions. We note that rotation has recently been described as a general mechanism in the activation and inactivation of adenylyl cyclase catalytic dimers (Sinha et al., 2005Sinha S.C. Wetterer M. Sprang S.R. Schultz J.E. Linder J.U. Origin of asymmetry in adenylyl cyclases: structures of Mycobacterium tuberculosis Rv1900c.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 663-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, Tews et al., 2005Tews I. Findeisen F. Sinning I. Schultz A. Schultz J.E. Linder J.U. The structure of a pH-sensing mycobacterial adenylyl cyclase holoenzyme.Science. 2005; 308: 1020-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). We tested the effects of Af1503 HAMP and of the A291V mutant in vivo using bacterial chemotaxis. During unstimulated motion, bacteria alternate swimming episodes of a few seconds with brief tumbling episodes, in which they acquire a random new direction. As a result, they execute a random walk (Berg, 1993Berg H.C. Random Walks in Biology. Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ1993Google Scholar). In a gradient of attractants (e.g., aspartate, serine, ribose) or repellents (e.g., indole, benzoate), they switch to a biased walk by reducing the frequency of tumbles while moving in a favorable direction. Tumbling is triggered by a phosphorylation cascade originating from the membrane bound chemoreceptors, whose modular structure includes a HAMP domain. We replaced the HAMP domain of the E. coli aspartate receptor, Tar (residues 214–266), with the Af1503 HAMP domain. Cells expressing this chimeric receptor lost their ability to execute a biased walk on swarm plates and showed a high frequency of tumbling (Figures 5A and 5C), which could be suppressed by the addition of high concentrations of attractant. The chimera carrying the A291V mutation was also unable to swarm, due however to a low frequency of tumbles (Figure 5C), which could likewise be reversed by the addition of high concentrations of a repellent (Ni2+). Thus, as already observed with the adenylyl cyclase chimeras, Af1503 HAMP activated Tar-mediated signaling and the A291V mutant inhibited it. Both chimeras remained responsive to stimuli, but their threshold for conformational change seemed to be outside the range required for effective chemotaxis. As expected from NMR spectroscopy, the threshold was too high for Af1503 HAMP and too low for the A291V mutant. Rotation has been previously shown to affect the ability of the cytoplasmic Tar domain to stimulate CheA phosphorylation and induce tumbles (Cochran and Kim, 1996Cochran A.G. Kim P.S. Imitation of Escherichia coli aspartate receptor signaling in engineered dimers of the cytoplasmic domain.Science. 1996; 271: 1113-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). When fused to the GCN4 leucine zipper, an insertion of four residues between zipper and the Tar cytoplasmic domain, which causes a torque in the same direction as that exerted in our model by wild-type Af1503 HAMP, activates the phosphorylation cascade, while an insertion of three residues, which causes a torque in the opposite direction, inactivates it. Hybrids between the yeast histidine kinase SLN1p and the leucine zipper of C/EBP showed similar effects for residue insertions into the coiled-coil region connecting the HAMP and histidine kinase domains (Tao et al., 2002Tao W. Malone C.L. Ault A.D. Deschenes R.J. Fassler J.S. A cytoplasmic coiled-coil domain is required for histidine kinase activity of the yeast osmosensor, SLN1.Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 459-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The clear phenotype of the A291V mutation prompted us to explore more systematically the effect of side-chain size on activity at this position. In a recent study, Ghadiri and coworkers introduced cavities into the hydrophobic core of the parallel, four-stranded coiled-coil GCN4-pLI by mutating leucines and isoleucines to smaller residues (Yadav et al., 2005Yadav M.K. Redman J.E. Leman L.J. Alvarez-Gutierrez J.M. Zhang Y. Stout C.D. Ghadiri M.R. Structure-based engineering of internal cavities in coiled-coil peptides.Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 9723-9732Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The mutant forms maintained knobs-into-holes packing but were progressively less stable with the size of the introduced cavity. Since in our model the HAMP domain naturally forms an internal cavity at the conserved A291 position in its knobs-into-holes packing form, we predicted a correlation between the stability of the off state and the side-chain size at this position. As expected, the activity of the AfHAMP-CHD adenylyl cyclase chimera progressively decreased with increasing side-chain size, from A291G to A291I (Figure 5B). The single exception was A291C, which was twice as active as expected and almost as active as the glycine mutant. We therefore introduced this mutant also into the Tar-AfHAMP chimera, yet in our chemotaxis assays, the A291C mutant was as inactive as A291V (Figure 5C). The possibility of a disulfide-bonded cyclase locked in the on state seems unlikely, as reducing conditions did not change the cyclase activity. NMR spectroscopy of the cysteine mutant also did not support the presence of a disulfide bond at that position. The reasons for this discrepancy are thus unclear to us at present. Several mechanisms have been proposed by which transmembrane receptors transmit signals into a cell, building on the four basic types of motion possible relative to the membrane. These mechanisms include piston-like displacements and pivot movements (Scott and Stoddard, 1994Scott W.G. Stoddard B.L. Transmembrane signalling and the aspartate receptor.Structure. 1994; 2: 877-887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), as well as composite motions (“swinging-piston” model; Chervitz and Falke, 1996Chervitz S.A. Falke J.J. Molecular mechanism of transmembrane signaling by the aspartate receptor: a model.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1996; 93: 2545-2550Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Most recently, Engelhard and coworkers showed that the phototaxis receptor NpSRII of Natronomonas pharaonis transduces signals by a 15°, clockwise rotation of the second transmembrane helix along an axis perpendicular to the membrane and a lateral displacement of this helix by 0.9 Å in the plane of the membrane (Moukhametzianov et al., 2006Moukhametzianov R. Klare J.P. Efremov R. Baeken C. Goppner A. Labahn J. Engelhard M. Buldt G. Gordeliy V.I. Development of the signal in sensory rhodopsin and its transfer to the cognate transducer.Nature. 2006; 440: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Regardless of the precise way by which a signal reaches the HAMP domain, our results suggest that it relays it by rotation of the helices. HAMP could thus act as a converter of multiple motion types upstream into a defined rotation downstream, based on a low-energy transition between two packing modes. As such it would represent a binary switch, absorbing transient conformational changes and producing a rotational output as an all-or-none signal, if a certain threshold is exceeded. It is worth noting that in our model the HAMP domain reverses the direction of rotation induced by the signal. Its excision from a receptor should thus have profound effects on the output, including a possible reversal of the signaling behavior."

https://openalex.org/W2042080470,"The cis-trans isomerization of proline serves as a regulatory switch in signaling pathways. We identify the proline isomerase Fpr4, a member of the FK506 binding protein family in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, as an enzyme which binds the amino-terminal tail of histones H3 and H4 and catalyses the isomerization of H3 proline P30 and P38 in vitro. We show that P38 is necessary for methylation of K36 and that isomerization by Fpr4 inhibits the ability of Set2 to methylate H3 K36 in vitro. These results suggest that the conformational state of P38, controlled by Fpr4, is important for methylation of H3K36 by Set2. Consistent with such an antagonistic role, abrogation of Fpr4 catalytic activity in vivo results in increased levels of H3K36 methylation and delayed transcriptional induction kinetics of specific genes in yeast. These results identify proline isomerization as a novel noncovalent histone modification that regulates transcription and provides evidence for crosstalk between histone lysine methylation and proline isomerization."

https://openalex.org/W2171721922,"The remarkable structural diversity of glycans in nature, and their roles in cellular processes, host-pathogen interactions, biological diversity and speciation can be explained by evolutionary processes. The remarkable structural diversity of glycans in nature, and their roles in cellular processes, host-pathogen interactions, biological diversity and speciation can be explained by evolutionary processes. The title of this Essay is a slight modification of the title of a classic article about evolution (Dobzhansky, 1973Dobzhansky T. Am. Biol. Teach. 1973; 35: 125-129Crossref Scopus (1494) Google Scholar). Indeed, one can substitute many other biological terms in place of “glycobiology” and still have an appropriate title for an interesting discussion. All cells in nature are covered with a dense coating of glycans that is important not only for the biological processes of hosts but also for the binding of pathogens to them. Thus, glycans may be trapped in neverending cycles of evolutionary “Red Queen” effects in which long-lived hosts must evade the more rapidly evolving pathogens that infect them by changing their glycan expression patterns, without compromising their own survival (Van Valen, 1974Van Valen L. Nature. 1974; 252: 298-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, Hamilton et al., 1990Hamilton W.D. Axelrod R. Tanese R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1990; 87: 3566-3573Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar). The colorful term, “Red Queen” effect, recalls the comment to Alice by the Red Queen in Lewis Carroll's Through the Looking Glass that “it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place.” This may explain the remarkable structural variations of glycans in nature, which contribute to biological diversity and perhaps even to speciation. All classes of biological molecules undergo evolution by neutral processes, natural selection, and/or sexual selection. This Essay examines how glycans—the oligosaccharide chains of sugars attached to many proteins and lipids—are prone to undergo rapid evolutionary change (Gagneux and Varki, 1999Gagneux P. Varki A. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 747-755Crossref Scopus (404) Google Scholar). I suggest here that rapid evolution of glycans driven by infectious agents could possibly mediate speciation (the formation of new species), that is, pathogen selection could be an even stronger force of natural selection than previously recognized. Until the 1980s, it was assumed that glycosylation was only found on secreted molecules, on the exterior leaflet of the plasma membrane, or on intracellular organelle membranes with the same orientation, that is, facing away from the cytosol. This dogma was demolished by the discovery of glycosylation on many nuclear and cytosolic proteins (Hart et al., 1989Hart G.W. Haltiwanger R.S. Holt G.D. Kelly W.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 841-874Crossref Scopus (316) Google Scholar). However, the inside and the outside of a cell are subject to rather different evolutionary selection forces—with internal mechanisms generally reflecting conservation and stability, and external processes characterized by dynamic and frequent evolutionary change. Indeed, the study of these two different biological spheres should perhaps be termed “endobiology” and “exobiology,” respectively. Thus, it is not surprising that these two worlds of cellular glycosylation are also quite distinct, both with regard to the nature of the glycan structures and the types of functions such structures mediate. For example, although extracellular glycans can mediate cell-cell and host-pathogen interactions (Sharon, 1996Sharon N. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1996; 408: 1-8Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar, Esko and Selleck, 2002Esko J.D. Selleck S.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 435-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar), intracellular glycans can serve as dynamic regulatory switches, often competing with protein modifications such as phosphorylation (Hart et al., 1989Hart G.W. Haltiwanger R.S. Holt G.D. Kelly W.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 841-874Crossref Scopus (316) Google Scholar). This Essay focuses on the “exobiology” of glycosylation. Francis Crick once observed that there are no (absolute) laws in biology—only gadgets (comment made at a 2002 symposium on human evolution; http://origins.ucsd.edu/Nov02). One exception may be that all cells in nature are covered with a dense and complex coat of glycans. There are probably many reasons for this including the diversity, complexity, hydrophilicity, and structural mobility of cell-surface glycans, as well as their combinatorial nature, which provides the possibility for rapid change to escape the pathogens that bind to them (Gagneux and Varki, 1999Gagneux P. Varki A. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 747-755Crossref Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Most glycan structures found on the cell surface and on secreted molecules are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus, in an assembly-line-like process that is not template driven and is subject to multiple sequential and competitive enzymatic pathways (Drickamer and Taylor, 1998Drickamer K. Taylor M.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 321-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (151) Google Scholar, Esko and Selleck, 2002Esko J.D. Selleck S.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 435-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar). Partly as a consequence of this “analog” mechanism of synthesis, the array of glycans on a given cell surface is difficult to predict, based on gene expression patterns alone. The glycans can also change dynamically, responding to small variations in the extracellular environment and intracellular events. Regardless of this, each cell type in each organism expresses a distinct array of glycans under defined conditions, and these expression patterns tend to be conserved within the same species. Moreover, these cell-type-specific glycan expression patterns are subject to striking and stereotypic species-specific changes during development, e.g., the evolutionarily conserved switch from peanut-agglutinin negative to positive during thymic development of T cells (Lowe and Marth, 2003Lowe J.B. Marth J.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 643-691Crossref Scopus (507) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that the expression of glycans is under strict regulatory control. The regulated expression of a limited set of genes encoding glycosyltransferases and glycan-modifying enzymes appears to control most cell-type-specific glycosylation patterns. These enzymes use specific high-energy nucleotide donors to carry out glycosylation reactions within the ER-Golgi pathway (Esko and Selleck, 2002Esko J.D. Selleck S.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 435-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar, Drickamer and Taylor, 1998Drickamer K. Taylor M.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 321-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and are conserved among related taxa. For example, the sialyltransferases that mediate the transfer of terminal sialic acid residues to glycans are conserved between mice and humans, not only in terms of specific orthologs, but also in their primary sequence and in their enzymatic specificity for acceptor substrates (Harduin-Lepers et al., 2005Harduin-Lepers A. Mollicone R. Delannoy P. Oriol R. Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 805-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The same is true of the genes involved in glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis (Esko and Selleck, 2002Esko J.D. Selleck S.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 435-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar). Thus, evolution appears to have favored conservation of these gene sequences and maintenance of distinct sets of such enzymes (Angata and Varki, 2002Angata T. Varki A. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 439-470Crossref Scopus (974) Google Scholar). Despite the conservation of glycosylation genes, one can find major intra- and interspecies variations in glycosylation patterns (Gagneux and Varki, 1999Gagneux P. Varki A. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 747-755Crossref Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Variations within a given species tend to be limited but can be dramatic, such as the ABO blood groups within humans and other primates (Hakomori, 1999Hakomori S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta Gen. Subj. 1999; 1473: 247-266Crossref Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Available information indicates that interspecies variations in glycosylation are more extensive. On rare occasions, a specific type of terminal glycan can be permanently eliminated in an entire evolutionary clade by inactivation of a specific glycosylation-related gene. A good example is the loss of the terminal α-galactose epitope (Galα1-3Galβ1-4GlcNAcβ1-R) in old world primates (Galili et al., 1987Galili U. Clark M.R. Shohet S.B. Buehler J. Macher B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1987; 84: 1369-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar), and the human-specific loss of the common mammalian sialic acid Neu5Gc (N-glycolylneuraminic acid) (Angata and Varki, 2002Angata T. Varki A. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 439-470Crossref Scopus (974) Google Scholar). However, even when comparing orthologous sets of conserved glycosyltransferases in closely related species such as mice and rats, one can find dramatic differences in the expression patterns of many terminal glycan structures (N. Varki, personal communication). Furthermore, the same conserved glycoprotein can carry markedly different glycan structures in closely related species (Gagneux and Varki, 1999Gagneux P. Varki A. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 747-755Crossref Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Taken together with the conservation of glycosyltransferase genes, this suggests that these marked differences are mediated by differential control of the individual enzymes in different species. Indeed, limited evidence suggests that this is the case, and that regulation of gene expression and/or posttranscriptional mechanisms govern these differences. A wide variety of pathogens initiate infection by binding to the surface glycans of host cells (Sharon, 1996Sharon N. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1996; 408: 1-8Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This is not surprising as cell-surface glycans are the first molecules encountered by pathogens when they contact potential host cells or their secretions. Outer terminal glycan sequences such as those carrying sialic acid residues are even more likely to be preferred targets, as they are the first residues that pathogens encounter. Examples include influenza virus infection of the lung, erythrocyte invasion by the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, Helicobacter pylori infection of the stomach, and intestinal diarrhea caused by the toxin of Vibrio cholerae (Mammen et al., 1998Mammen M. Choi S.-K. Whitesides G.M. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1998; 37: 2754-2794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Angata and Varki, 2002Angata T. Varki A. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 439-470Crossref Scopus (974) Google Scholar). Why are glycosylation genes and biosynthetic pathways so highly conserved if they generate glycan targets for many potentially deadly pathogens? It appears that individual cell types or whole species have committed themselves to important endogenous functions for such glycans, often in a cell-type-specific fashion, thus constraining their ability to discard glycans (Lowe and Marth, 2003Lowe J.B. Marth J.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 643-691Crossref Scopus (507) Google Scholar). For example, inactivation of specific sialyltransferases in the mouse results in cell-type-specific defects, such as loss of certain T cell subsets or blood coagulation abnormalities (Lowe and Marth, 2003Lowe J.B. Marth J.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 643-691Crossref Scopus (507) Google Scholar). In contrast, complete elimination of any major glycan class results in death of the mouse embryo (Schwarzkopf et al., 2002Schwarzkopf M. Knobeloch K.P. Rohde E. Hinderlich S. Wiechens N. Lucka L. Horak I. Reutter W. Horstkorte R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 5267-5270Crossref Scopus (261) Google Scholar, Esko and Selleck, 2002Esko J.D. Selleck S.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 435-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar, Lowe and Marth, 2003Lowe J.B. Marth J.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 643-691Crossref Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Meanwhile, glycan binding pathogens are evolving much more rapidly than their hosts, by virtue of their short generation times and high mutation rates. Thus, the glycans of complex multicellular organisms with long life cycles may be subject to evolutionary “Red Queen” effects (Figure 1), in which such organisms must evolve rapidly to survive the onslaught of microbial pathogens that can replicate (and thus evolve) even faster (Van Valen, 1974Van Valen L. Nature. 1974; 252: 298-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, Hamilton et al., 1990Hamilton W.D. Axelrod R. Tanese R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1990; 87: 3566-3573Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar). Complex multicellular organisms may change their glycan profiles frequently to escape the pathogens that are tracking them (Figure 1). Indeed, the same scenario is apparently being played out even in single-celled prokaryotes, in which the bacteria's own pathogens (phages) often mediate attachment by recognition of bacterial surface polysaccharides. Further complexity arises from the fact that soluble secreted glycan-bearing molecules (such as the mucin molecules in mucus or serum glycoproteins) can potentially act as decoys, diverting the binding of pathogens away from target cell surfaces (Gagneux and Varki, 1999Gagneux P. Varki A. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 747-755Crossref Scopus (404) Google Scholar, Perrier et al., 2006Perrier C. Sprenger N. Corthesy B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14280-14287Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). With viruses, we have suggested that even non-nucleated cells such as mammalian erythrocytes could potentially act as glycan decoys. Of course, pathogens can also evolve rapidly away from such decoys, or even start to exploit them, fueling additional bouts of such arms races or cycles of “Red Queen” effects (Figure 1). There are many other evolutionary forces potentially and simultaneously driving the diversification of glycan expression. For example, cell-type-specific expression of certain glycans can mediate specific biological roles within an organism (Lowe and Marth, 2003Lowe J.B. Marth J.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 643-691Crossref Scopus (507) Google Scholar), which thus may be under positive selection. Also, the sudden elimination of a glycan in an entire evolutionary lineage (clade)—such as the loss of α-galactose residues in old world primates—can be accompanied by the spontaneous expression of high levels of complement-fixing antibodies directed against the same structure (Galili et al., 1987Galili U. Clark M.R. Shohet S.B. Buehler J. Macher B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1987; 84: 1369-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Such antibodies have been proposed to restrict lateral transmission of enveloped viruses, as these usually carry along the surface glycan structures of the organisms from which they originate (Takeuchi et al., 1996Takeuchi Y. Porter C.D. Strahan K.M. Preece A.F. Gustafsson K. Cosset F.L. Weiss R.A. Collins M.K.L. Nature. 1996; 379: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). For example, a new world monkey virus could have its envelope glycoproteins extensively modified with α-galactose residues, resulting in killing of the virus upon first contact with the blood of an old world primate such as a human. This may help to explain the contrast between the many zoonotic old world primate viruses that cause human diseases and the rarity of human diseases caused by new world monkey viruses (P. Gagneux, personal communication). Additional Red Queen effects may arise from the fact that many pathogens use a successful form of molecular mimicry, disguising themselves with cell-surface glycans similar to those of their hosts (Figure 1). Interestingly, most of these instances do not represent lateral gene transfer from vertebrates but rather involve recruitment of pre-existing homologous genes or possibly convergent evolution (reinventions). These and other forces are likely to have further driven the diversification of species-specific glycosylation patterns during evolution. Meanwhile, host glycan binding proteins such as siglecs (sialic-acid binding immunoglobulin-like lectins) dedicated to recognizing self also need to evolve rapidly in order to keep up with the ever evolving host “glycome” (Crocker, 2005Crocker P.R. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2005; 5: 431-437Crossref Scopus (179) Google Scholar, Varki and Angata, 2006Varki A. Angata T. Glycobiology. 2006; 16: 1R-27RCrossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). (There are many possible definitions of the term “glycome,” ranging from a static and simple parts list of types of glycans found in a given organism to a dynamic array of presentations of glycans that vary with individual cell types and change with time, space, and environmental conditions. I use the term glycome to mean the latter.) There is compelling evidence that cell-surface and secreted glycans are involved in many aspects of reproductive biology such as the coating of germ cells, the passage of sperm through the female reproductive tract, maturation of sperm, attachment of sperm to female reproductive surfaces, fertilization, and implantation (Mengerink and Vacquier, 2001Mengerink K.J. Vacquier V.D. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 37R-43RCrossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar, Diekman, 2003Diekman A.B. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 298-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, Lapid and Sharon, 2006Lapid K. Sharon N. Glycobiology. 2006; 16: 39R-45RCrossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Some biologists remain unconvinced that glycosylation plays a key role in reproductive biology, perhaps because of the diverse and confusing findings reported to date and the apparent lack of conservation of expression patterns of most of the glycans involved. Also, some genetic mutations have not produced the predicted loss of fertility (Lowe and Marth, 2003Lowe J.B. Marth J.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 643-691Crossref Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Due to its key role in evolution, reproduction is a rapidly evolving biological process for which one should actually expect to find marked diversification and redundancy of function. Such diversification and redundancy may be driven by sexual selection and sexual conflict, and by the need to isolate the fertilization event to prevent unwanted crossfertilization by other related species, while limiting the opportunity for infection by sexually transmitted pathogens. Unwanted crossfertilization is of special importance to species with external fertilization (such as echinoderms and fish), and sexually transmitted pathogens are of particular importance to species with internal fertilization (such as mammals). Much is written about the role of rapid evolutionary processes in the diversification of symbionts and pathogens and their relationships to hosts (Lederberg, 1999Lederberg J. Genetics. 1999; 153: 1-3PubMed Google Scholar). It is assumed that infectious diseases can have remarkable selective effects in generating intraspecies polymorphisms, such as sickle cell disease resulting from selection by malaria (Lederberg, 1999Lederberg J. Genetics. 1999; 153: 1-3PubMed Google Scholar). Despite this, little attention has been given to the notion that such pathogen-mediated selection might contribute to driving the speciation process itself. The reason for this is that infectious diseases usually do not directly affect the germline, nor do they affect specific primary steps of reproduction, such as mating and fertilization. But the regulation of glycan production can potentially provide a mechanism for linking the processes of natural selection and sexual selection (Figure 2). Thus, infection of a population by a deadly pathogen that binds to specific host glycans could result in survival of only a few individuals whose glycosylation patterns happen to be altered due to genomic or transcriptional changes. This type of altered glycosylation pattern might in turn also be manifest in the reproductive tract or on germ cells, leading to significant changes in fertility and the fertilization process, for example by blocking fertilization by the original population allowing sympatric speciation (speciation without geographic separation from the ancestor), or perhaps contributing to anomalous fertilization by closely related species. Meanwhile, if such glycosylation changes eventually become fixed in other cell types, this could result in pleiotropic changes affecting embryogenesis and morphogenesis, further contributing to speciation. Marked reductions in population size by deadly pathogens could also leave isolated pockets of survivors, helping to drive allopatric speciation (speciation after geographic separation from the ancestor) via such founder events (Figure 2). Scenarios can even be envisioned in which female antibodies against sperm bound glycans could help to drive speciation by generating postmating prezygotic isolation, such as selective elimination of sperm after they have entered the female reproductive tract (P. Gagneux, personal communication). Overall, one can speculate that some episodes of speciation might be mediated by pathogens that bind to specific forms of cell-surface glycans. Whatever the reader might think of the speculations in this Essay, it is safe to suggest that approaches to understanding glycan biology must fully take into account the role of multiple and often simultaneous evolutionary processes, an aspect that has received limited attention. Indeed, almost 150 years after Darwin's revelation and more than 50 years after the Neo-Darwinian synthesis, some biologists still assume that natural selection through “survival of the fittest” (a term never actually used by Darwin) has already honed most biological processes to near perfection. In reality, we biologists are simply studying a brief window of biological time, which represents the present status of trade-offs reached by currently living organisms subject to a number of evolutionary forces: positive selection, neutral drift, purifying selection, and sexual selection, all taking place under ever-changing biotic and abiotic environments. These forces are all acting jointly but nondirectionally, diversifying and complicating biological processes in unexpected ways, including the process of speciation. I thank P. Gagneux for enlightening discussions and N. Varki and T. Angata for helpful comments."

Heart failure is a leading cause of mortality worldwide, affecting about 1-2% of the population in Japan, Europe, and the United States (1Liew C.C. Dzau V.J. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2004; 5: 811-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Heart failure results from an imbalance between left ventricular (LV) 2The abbreviations used are: LV, left ventricular; CAG, cytomegalovirus enhancer/chicken β-actin; COX, cytochrome c oxidase; MCK, muscle creatine kinase; SOD, superoxide dismutase; MnTBAP, manganese 5,10,15,20-tetrakis (4-benzoic acid) porphyrin; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; OXPHOS, oxidative phosphorylation; PAS, periodic acid-Schiff; ROS, reactive oxygen species; SDH, succinate dehydrogenase; O2⋅¯, superoxide; TA, tibialis anterior; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MDA, malondialdehyde; TUNEL, terminal dUTP nick-end labeling. performance and myocardial energy consumption, a phenomenon that is best described as mechanoenergetic uncoupling. Despite the markedly impaired work of the left ventricle in this process, the oxygen used by muscle contraction remains relatively unchanged, which results in a decline in the contractile function of the myocardium. The mechanisms responsible for the progression of heart failure are emerging, whereas there is increasing evidence to suggest that reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a major pathological role (2Alameddine F.M. Zafari A.M. Congest. Heart Fail. 2002; 8 (172): 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 3Givertz M.M. Colucci W.S. Lancet. 1998; 352: SI34-SI38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, several studies on human cases have revealed increased ROS production in the hearts of individuals with congestive heart failure. Biomarkers for ROS have been detected in the pericardial fluid (4Mallat Z. Philip I. Lebret M. Chatel D. Maclouf J. Tedgui A. Circulation. 1998; 97: 1536-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) as well as in the peripheral blood (5Diaz-Velez C.R. Garcia-Castineiras S. Mendoza-Ramos E. Hernandez-Lopez E. Am. Heart J. 1996; 131: 146-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 6Keith M. Geranmayegan A. Sole M.J. Kurian R. Robinson A. Omran A.S. Jeejeebhoy K.N. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 1998; 31: 1352-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar) of heart failure patients. Although it is still controversial whether antioxidative enzymes are inactivated in failing hearts (7Dieterich S. Bieligk U. Beulich K. Hasenfuss G. Prestle J. Circulation. 2000; 101: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 8Khaper N. Kaur K. Li T. Farahmand F. Singal P.K. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2003; 251: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), polymorphisms in the candidate genes that are responsive to oxidative stress affect the susceptibility to and contribute to the risk of heart failure (2Alameddine F.M. Zafari A.M. Congest. Heart Fail. 2002; 8 (172): 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). It is therefore hypothesized that heart failure is attributable to an imbalance between the generation of ROS and cellular antioxidative defensive mechanisms. Superoxide (O2⋅¯), one of the ROS generated in mitochondrial respiration, is involved in a variety of biological processes in the myocardium, including alterations in mitochondrial DNA (9Ide T. Tsutsui H. Hayashidani S. Kang D. Suematsu N. Nakamura K. Utsumi H. Hamasaki N. Takeshita A. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 529-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar), contractile proteins (10Suzuki S. Kaneko M. Chapman D.C. Dhalla N.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1074: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), ion channels (11Jabr R.I. Cole W.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 812-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), or mitochondrial respiratory enzymes (12Wallace D.C. Methods Mol. Biol. 2002; 197: 3-54PubMed Google Scholar, 13Melov S. Coskun P. Patel M. Tuinstra R. Cottrell B. Jun A.S. Zastawny T.H. Dizdaroglu M. Goodman S.I. Huang T.T. Miziorko H. Epstein C.J. Wallace D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 846-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) is a principal scavenger enzyme located in mitochondrial matrix, which detoxifies O2⋅¯ by dismutation, protecting cells from oxidative stress. Interestingly, polymorphisms in the targeting signal of the Mn-SOD gene affect the efficiency of its transport to mitochondria. The allele frequency is then associated with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (14Hiroi S. Harada H. Nishi H. Satoh M. Nagai R. Kimura A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 332-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 15Valenti L. Conte D. Piperno A. Dongiovanni P. Fracanzani A.L. Fraquelli M. Vergani A. Gianni C. Carmagnola L. Fargion S. J. Med. Genet. 2004; 41: 946-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). These genetic data suggested that Mn-SOD plays an important role in the susceptibility to and/or the progression of dilated cardiomyopathy. In previous studies, two groups independently reported on Mn-SOD-deficient mice (16Li Y. Huang T.T. Carlson E.J. Melov S. Ursell P.C. Olson J.L. Noble L.J. Yoshimura M.P. Berger C. Chan P.H. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 376-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (1455) Google Scholar, 17Lebovitz R.M. Zhang H. Vogel H. Cartwright J.J. Dionne L. Lu N. Huang S. Matzuk M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9782-9787Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar). The Mn-SOD deficiency on a CD1 background resulted in neonatal death by day 10 from severe dilated cardiomyopathy, liver dysfunction, and metabolic acidosis (16Li Y. Huang T.T. Carlson E.J. Melov S. Ursell P.C. Olson J.L. Noble L.J. Yoshimura M.P. Berger C. Chan P.H. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 376-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (1455) Google Scholar). Other Mn-SOD-deficient mice in a mixed genetic background of C57BL/6 and 129/Sv, on the other hand, died by day 18 with neuronal degeneration, particularly in the basal ganglia and brainstem (17Lebovitz R.M. Zhang H. Vogel H. Cartwright J.J. Dionne L. Lu N. Huang S. Matzuk M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9782-9787Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar). In this context, it was hard to investigate the pathological consequences of oxidative damages in adult tissues by using these Mn-SOD-deficient mice. These authors also argued that the phenotypes are too complex to sequestrate the specific aging processes in each tissue of mutant mice in vivo. In the present study, we successfully generated heart/muscle-specific Mn-SOD-deficient mice (H/M-Sod2-/-) using the Cre-loxP system under the control of the muscle creatine kinase (MCK) promoter and established a murine model for congestive heart failure as well as age-related physical disability induced by oxidative stress. Since heart failure still remains a significant health problem, with mortality rates as high as 45% within 1 year (1Liew C.C. Dzau V.J. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2004; 5: 811-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), more effective treatments should be established. Since the biological effects of oxidative stress in heart failure have been precisely analyzed in the last decade, we expect an emergence of new cardiovascular medicine or new nutritional interventions that will improve the quality of life in patients with heart failure. Many of the antioxidants and oxidative stress-related medicines currently under investigation are controversial (3Givertz M.M. Colucci W.S. Lancet. 1998; 352: SI34-SI38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Tang W.H. Francis G.S. Expert Opin. Investig. Drugs. 2003; 12: 1791-1801Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). With this model, we provide a means to evaluate the efficacy of medicine or interventions over a physiological as well as pathological range of heart functions and failures. Animals and Genotyping—The generation of Mn-SOD flox mice was described previously (19Ikegami T. Suzuki Y. Shimizu T. Isono K. Koseki H. Shirasawa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 296: 729-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The Mn-SOD flox mice were back-crossed to C57BL6/CrSlc mice for five or six generations. The cross-breeding of homozygous Mn-SOD flox mice with MCK-Cre transgenic mice of FVB background (20Bruning J.C. Michael M.D. Winnay J.N. Hayashi T. Horsch D. Accili D. Goodyear L.J. Kahn C.R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 559-569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar) gave rise to H/M-Sod2-/- mice. All genotyping of the Cre transgene and the Mn-SOD flox was performed by PCR using genomic DNA isolated from the tail tip. The primers for identifying carriers of the MCK-Cre transgene (5′-TTC CAG CTA GAG AGA CTG AGT CCC-3′ and 5′-TCG ACC AGT TTA GTT ACC C-3′) and Mn-SOD flox allele (5′-TTA GGG CTC AGG TTT GTC CAG AA-3′, 5′-CGA GGG GCA TCT AGT GGA GAA-3′, and 5′-AGC TTG GCT GGA CGT AA-3′) were used. The deleted alleles were confirmed as described previously (19Ikegami T. Suzuki Y. Shimizu T. Isono K. Koseki H. Shirasawa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 296: 729-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). DNA isolated from cytomegalovirus enhancer/chicken β-actin (CAG) promoter Cre Mn-SOD-deficient neonates was used as a positive control (19Ikegami T. Suzuki Y. Shimizu T. Isono K. Koseki H. Shirasawa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 296: 729-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Mice were maintained and studied according to protocols approved by the Animal Care Committee of the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology. Western Blot Analysis—Western blot analysis was performed with heart, skeletal muscle (tibialis anterior), brain, liver, and kidney homogenates (5 μg each) as previously described (19Ikegami T. Suzuki Y. Shimizu T. Isono K. Koseki H. Shirasawa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 296: 729-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Antibodies against Mn-SOD (1:10,000; catalog number SOD-111; StressGen, Victoria, Canada), Complex I α9 (1:2000; Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR), succinate dehydrogenase A (SDHA) flavoprotein (1:10,000; Molecular Probes), SDHB iron-sulfur protein (1:200; Molecular Probes), Complex III Rieske iron-sulfur protein (1:2000; Molecular Probes), Complex III Core I (1:10,000; Molecular Probes), cytochrome c oxidase (COX) subunit I (1:500; Molecular Probes), Complex V α subunit (1:2000; Molecular Probes), Complex V β subunit (1:5,000; Molecular Probes), cleaved caspase-3 (1:1000; Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (1:2000; Biogenesis Ltd., Poole, UK), and actin (1:100; Sigma) were used. Generation of an Antibody against Mn-SOD for Immunohistochemistry—An immunogen peptide corresponding to residues Lys25-Ala37 (KHSLPDLPYDYGA) of mouse Mn-SOD with an additional cysteine residue plus amide at the C terminus was synthesized. The synthetic peptide corresponding to the N-terminal region of the mature form of mouse Mn-SOD (21Kong B.W. Kim H. Foster D.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1625: 98-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) was immunized to rabbits as described previously (22Shimizu T. Ikegami T. Ogawara M. Suzuki Y. Takahashi M. Morio H. Shirasawa T. J. Neurosci. Res. 2002; 69: 341-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The specific antibody was affinity-purified using the immunogen peptide immobilized on FMP-activated Cellulofine (Seikagaku Kogyo, Tokyo, Japan). Histological and Histochemical Studies—Organs were dissected, fixed overnight in a 20% formalin neutral buffer solution (Wako, Osaka, Japan), embedded in paraffin, and sectioned on a microtome using standard techniques. To detect the fibrosis or glycogen accumulation in tissues, sections were stained by Azan staining or periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining methods, respectively. For immunohistochemistry, 4-μm deparaffinized transverse sections prepared from heart or tibialis anterior were immunostained with an anti-Mn-SOD antibody (1:1000) using a Vectastain elite ABC kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For enzymatic histochemical staining, tissues were frozen in isopentane in liquid nitrogen and embedded in Tissue Tek O.C.T. compound on dry ice. Sections were cut 8 μm thick and mounted on silane-coated slide glasses. Frozen sections were dried and incubated in 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 84 mm succinate acid, 0.2 mm phenazine methasulfate, 2 mg/ml nitro blue tetrazolium, and 4.5 mm EDTA for SDH (Complex II) activity or in 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 1.0 mg/ml 3, 3′-diaminobenzidine, 24 units/ml catalase (Wako), 1 mg/ml cytochrome c (Wako), and 75 mg/ml sucrose for COX (Complex IV) activity. These reactions were performed in the dark at room temperature for 20 min. The nuclei with DNA fragmentation on 4-μm deparaffinized sections were stained with an ApopTag Plus fluorescein in situ apoptosis detection kit (Serologicals Corp., Norcross, GA). Echocardiography—The mice were anesthetized with 2.5% avertin (8 μl/g) and echocardiography was performed using ultrasonography (SONOS-5500, equipped with 15-MHz linear transducer; Philips Medical Systems) (23Yamaguchi O. Higuchi Y. Hirotani S. Kashiwase K. Nakayama H. Hikoso S. Takeda T. Watanabe T. Asahi M. Taniike M. Matsumura Y. Tsujimoto I. Hongo K. Kusakari Y. Kurihara S. Nishida K. Ichijo H. Hori M. Otsu K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 15883-15888Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The heart was imaged in the two-dimensional parasternal short axis view, and an M-mode echocardiogram of the midventricle was recorded at the level of the papillary muscles. Heart rate, anterior and posterior wall thickness, and end diastolic and end systolic internal dimensions of the left ventricle were obtained from the M-mode image. Transmission Electron Micrographs of Myocardium and Skeletal Muscle—Hearts from 16-week-old mice were fixed by immersion in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m sodium phosphate (pH 7.3) for 48 h at 4 °C and postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide in the same buffer for 2 h at 4 °C, dehydrated in ethanol, immersed in absolute propylene oxide, and embedded in Epon 812 (Structure Probe, West Chester, PA). Regions of interest were localized and characterized with the light microscope on 1-μm sections stained with toluidine blue. Ultrathin sections from selected areas were cut with a diamond knife and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and observed with a JEOL JEM 1200 EXII electron microscope (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) at 60 kV. Measurement of O2⋅¯ and H2O—O2⋅¯ formation was measured using the chemiluminescent probe 2-methyl-6-p-methoxyphenylethynyl-imidazopyazinone (ATTO, Tokyo, Japan) (24Nakai D. Shimizu T. Nojiri H. Uchiyama S. Koike H. Takahashi M. Hirokawa K. Shirasawa T. Aging Cell. 2004; 3: 273-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). H2O2 generation was measured using horseradish peroxidase (1 unit/ml), homovanilic acid (0.1 mm), and substrate (5 mm malate and 0.5 mm glutamate) (25Barja G. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2002; 34: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) or horseradish peroxidase (0.2 unit/ml), Amplex red (Molecular Probes) (1 μm), and substrate (5 mm succinate) (26Morten K.J. Ackrell B.A. Melov S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3354-3359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Fluorescence was determined at 312-nm excitation and 420-nm emission in cases using homovanilic acid or at 544-nm excitation and 590-nm emission in cases using Amplex red with a SPECTRAmax Gemini XS (Molecular Devices, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Fluorescence units were converted by the standard curve of known concentration of H2O2. Results were expressed as pmol of H2O2/min/mg of protein. Lipid Peroxidation—Lipid peroxidation in cytoplasmic and mitochondrial fraction prepared from heart was measured with a colorimetric assay kit for lipid peroxidation (BIOXYTECK MDA-586 Oxis Research, Portland, OR) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Activities of Mitochondrial Respiratory Chain Enzymes and ATP Synthesis—Mitochondria were isolated from heart, tibialis anterior muscle, and liver by homogenization, followed by differential centrifugation (24Nakai D. Shimizu T. Nojiri H. Uchiyama S. Koike H. Takahashi M. Hirokawa K. Shirasawa T. Aging Cell. 2004; 3: 273-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) enzyme activity was normalized for the protein concentration. Succinate-cytochrome c reductase (Complex II + III) activity and NADH-cytochrome c reductase (Complex I + III) activity were measured as described previously (24Nakai D. Shimizu T. Nojiri H. Uchiyama S. Koike H. Takahashi M. Hirokawa K. Shirasawa T. Aging Cell. 2004; 3: 273-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). ATP synthesis was measured in intact heart and liver mitochondria. Incubation buffer (250 mm sucrose, 5 mm KCl, 5 mm KH2PO4, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) was added to test tubes followed by the addition of mitochondria (0.01 mg of protein/ml). The tubes were incubated at 25 °C for 10 min. After that, 0.5 mm ADP, 5 mm malate, and 0.5 mm glutamate as substrates were added to test tubes and incubated at 25 °C for 5 min. Then the test tubes were placed on ice and centrifuged at 10,000 × g, 4 °C, for 10 min. A 190-μl aliquot of the supernatant was added to 10 μl of luciferase and luciferin (Wako), and bioluminescence was assessed on a Lumat LB9507 luminometer (Berthold Technologies, Bad Wildbad, Germany). Results were expressed as nmol of ATP/mg of protein. ATP content was measured with a cell Titer-Glo® luminescent cell viability assay (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNA Preparation, Affymetrix Microarray, and RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from hearts of three 16-week-old mice with an RNeasy Fibrous Tissue Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). For the microarray analysis, the synthesis of cDNA and array hybridization was conducted with Affymetrix MOE430 2.0 array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The raw microarray data files are available on the World Wide Web at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/ (Gene Expression Omnibus accession number GSE2236). For the RT-PCR analysis, cDNAs were synthesized using an avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase first-strand cDNA synthesis kit (Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan). The primers used in PCR were 5′-AGG TTC ATG GAG AGA TAC GC-3′ and 5′-GCA ATA CAC TTC CCA CAC G-3′ for Sdha, 5′-ACC TCG AAT GCA GAC GTA C-3′ and 5′-TTC TGC AAT CGC TTT CCC-3′ for Sdhb, 5′-TCT GCA GAT CCA AGG GGA GAA CC-3′ and 5′-GGT GAG ACT CCA GCA ACT TCT CC-3′ for Ucp3, 5′-TGG CTG GCC ATG TAC AGA GCT-3′ and 5′-TCC AGA GTG CTC TTC TGA GCC-3′ for Abcc9 (ATP-binding cassette, subfamily C, member 9), 5′-GCA AGG AGG CAG GCC ACC AG-3′ and 5′-GTC TTG GCC CGG GTG CCA TA-3′ for Ace (angiotensin-converting enzyme), 5′-TGC AAA AAG AGG TCT CCA AGG T-3′ and 5′-AGG TGT GTC TCC CTG AAG CAG T-3′ for periostin, 5′-GCC CCA GGA CCA AAT AGC AG-3′ and 5′-TCC TGC TCC ATC TCC CGT CT for Itgb1bp3 (integrin β1-binding protein 3), and 5′-GTG GGC CGC TCT AGG CAC AA-3′ and 5′-CTC TTG ATG TCA CGC ACG ATT TC-3′ for β-actin under the following conditions: 1 cycle of 94 °C for 2 min; 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min; followed by 1 cycle of 72 °C for 10 min. Rescue Experiments—Manganese 5,10,15,20-tetrakis (4-benzoic acid) porphyrin (MnTBAP) (Calbiochem) dissolved in PBS at 1 mg/ml was injected intraperitoneally into mutant mice once a day as previously described (27Scortegagna M. Ding K. Oktay Y. Gaur A. Thurmond F. Yan L.J. Marck B.T. Matsumoto A.M. Shelton J.M. Richardson J.A. Bennett M.J. Garcia J.A. Nat. Genet. 2003; 35: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). The injections, the dose of which was 10 μg/g of body weight/day, began from 8 weeks of age for 4-8 weeks. PBS was injected into the littermate mutant mice as control. Analysis of Physical and Cardiac Contractile Activities—Mice were voluntarily exercised using a running wheel apparatus (KI-101; Aptec, Kyoto, Japan) as described previously (28Shirasawa T. Izumizaki M. Suzuki Y. Ishihara A. Shimizu T. Tamaki M. Huang F. Koizumi K. Iwase M. Sakai H. Tsuchida E. Ueshima K. Inoue H. Koseki H. Senda T. Kuriyama T. Homma I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5035-5043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The rotarod task was analyzed using a rotarod apparatus (MK-630; Muromachi Kikai, Tokyo, Japan). The period for which a mouse could remain on a rotating axis (30-mm diameter; rotational speed 20 rpm) without falling was measured. The test was stopped after an arbitrary limit of 300 s, and three sessions of training were required before mice attained a stable performance. Isolated hearts from 12-week-old mice were excised quickly to establish Langendorff perfusion and perfused with modified Krebs-Henseleit solution (containing 116.0 mm NaCl, 25.0 mm NaHCO3, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, and 5.5 mm glucose, pH 7.4) in a retrograde direction at a constant flow rate of 2.0 ml/min without recirculation. The perfusate was warmed to 38 °C and oxygenated with a 95% O2, 5% CO2 gas mixture to elevate the PO2 to over 400 mm Hg. A hook through the apex of the heart was connected to an isometric force transducer for monitoring tension and heart rate. The initial loaded tension was adjusted to the same force in each experiment. The cardiac contractile activity was evaluated with the tension rate product (tension times heart rate). The data were normalized with heart weight. Statistical Analysis—We analyzed data using Student's unpaired t test and considered p values of <0.05 to be statistically significant. Data are expressed as the mean ± S.D. Generation of Heart/Muscle-specific Mn-SOD-deficient Mice—In order to investigate the physiological as well as pathological role of Mn-SOD in the heart and muscle, we generated conditional Mn-SOD knock-out mice using the Cre-loxP system. We used MCK-Cre transgenic mice for the selective expression of Cre protein in muscle tissues (20Bruning J.C. Michael M.D. Winnay J.N. Hayashi T. Horsch D. Accili D. Goodyear L.J. Kahn C.R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 559-569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, cross-breeding of homozygous Mn-SOD flox mice (control) with MCK-Cre transgenic mice gave rise to H/M-Sod2-/-. Genomic DNAs extracted from various tissues were analyzed by PCR for the detection of the deleted fragment from the genomic Mn-SOD gene. A 401-bp DNA fragment corresponding to the deletion allele was specifically amplified by PCR from the heart and skeletal muscle of H/M-Sod2-/- mice, whereas no fragment was amplified in other tissues of H/M-Sod2-/- mice or in any tissues of control mice (Fig. 1B). Western blot analyses further showed a specific loss of Mn-SOD expression in the heart and skeletal muscle of H/M-Sod2-/- mice (Fig. 1C), but no loss was observed in control mice. In an immunohistochemical analysis, specific immunoreactivity for Mn-SOD was detected in the endothelial cells of the heart or muscle but not in the cardiac myocytes or the striated muscle cells of the tibialis anterior (TA) from H/M-Sod2-/- mice. On the other hand, specific immunoreactivity for Mn-SOD was detected in the myocardium and in the striated muscle from the TA of control mice (Fig. 1D). Heart/Muscle-specific Mn-SOD-deficient Mice Developed Dilated Cardiomyopathy Associated with Progressive Physical Disabilities—In the neonatal stage, we were unable to find any differences in the outer appearance or body size between H/M-Sod2-/- and control mice. However, at 8 weeks of age, the H/M-Sod2-/- mice began to exhibit growth retardation. At 16 weeks of age, the H/M-Sod2-/- mice showed a 25% reduction in body weight compared with control mice without distinct muscle atrophy (Fig. 2, A and C). Phenotypically, H/M-Sod2-/- mice developed signs of fatigue at as early as 8 weeks of age, when some of these animals began to die. By 22 weeks of age, all H/M-Sod2-/- mutant mice died, with a median survival rate of 15.4 ± 4.0 weeks (Fig. 2B). When examined macroscopically, all of the hearts of H/M-Sod2-/- mice showed cardiac enlargement at 16 weeks of age without an exception (Fig. 2A). Under normal diet, the H/M-Sod2-/- mice exhibited 51% reduction in food intake compared with control mice (Fig. 2D). In order to evaluate daily physical activities of the H/M-Sod2-/- mutant mice, we placed a running wheel apparatus in their cages. The H/M-Sod2-/- mutant mice did not exhibit any signs of ataxia but hardly ran on the apparatus, whereas control mice ran more than 10 km every day after 4 days of the exercise session (Fig. 2E). When heart weight was standardized to body weight, the hearts of H/M-Sod2-/- mice were found to be 2.1-fold heavier at 2 months of age and 2.7-fold heavier at 4 months of age than those of control mice (Fig. 2F, Table 1).TABLE 1Physiological parameters and analysis of in vivo cardiac size and function by echocardiography2 months4 monthsH/M-Sod2−/− (n = 3)Control (n = 4)H/M-Sod2−/− (n = 3)Control (n = 6)IVSd (mm)0.70 ± 0.060.72 ± 0.040.73 ± 0.10.74 ± 0.02LVIDd (mm)5.28 ± 0.13ap < 0.001 versus control mice.3.17 ± 0.057.49 ± 0.12ap < 0.001 versus control mice.3.55 ± 0.08LVPWd (mm)0.65 ± 0.030.65 ± 0.020.71 ± 0.080.76 ± 0.05IVSs (mm)0.82 ± 0.07bp < 0.01 versus control mice.1.30 ± 0.080.85 ± 0.05bp < 0.01 versus control mice.1.27 ± 0.06LVIDs (mm)4.69 ± 0.10ap < 0.001 versus control mice.1.69 ± 0.036.86 ± 0.10ap < 0.001 versus control mice.2.02 ± 0.09LVPWs (mm)0.91 ± 0.111.00 ± 0.120.91 ± 0.06cp < 0.05 versus control mice.1.35 ± 0.12HR (min)599.00 ± 31.15583.24 ± 17.24528.14 ± 8.58533.87 ± 16.52FS (%)11.23 ± 0.79ap < 0.001 versus control mice.46.40 ± 1.538.30 ± 0.25ap < 0.001 versus control mice.43.17 ± 1.39EF (%)21.06 ± 1.51ap < 0.001 versus control mice.71.37 ± 1.6416.03 ± 0.43ap < 0.001 versus control mice.67.65 ± 1.60Body weight (g)16.10 ± 0.7614.40 ± 0.4519.00 ± 0.422.63 ± 0.50Heart weight (mg)179.00 ± 8.5bp < 0.01 versus control mice.76.50 ± 7.46285.70 ± 17.3bp < 0.01 versus control mice.117.33 ± 7.07Lung weight (mg)109.30 ± 3.1895.50 ± 3.93140.00 ± 8.5135.67 ± 5.57Heart weight/body weight (%)1.10 ± 0.03ap < 0.001 versus control mice.0.53 ± 0.031.42 ± 0.05ap < 0.001 versus control mice.0.52 ± 0.03Lung weight/body weight (%)0.68 ± 0.020.66 ± 0.010.69 ± 0.020.60 ± 0.03a p < 0.001 versus control mice.b p < 0.01 versus control mice.c p < 0.05 versus control mice. Open table in a new tab To determine whether deficiency of Mn-SOD in heart and muscle would affect the cardiac function, cardiac performance was evaluated by means of echocardiography in 2-month-old mice (Fig. 3, Table 1). Compared with control mice, cardiac contractility was significantly depressed in H/M-Sod2-/- mice as assessed by fractional shortening (FS) and ejection fraction (EF) (Fig. 3B, Table 1). The LV enddiastolic and end-systolic diameters were significantly increased in H/M-Sod2-/- mice compared with control mice (Fig. 3B, Table 1). The decreased contractility and LV dilatation were also observed at 4 months compared with control mice. However, diastolic intraventricular septum thickness (IVSd), diastolic LV posterior wall thickness (LVPWd), and systolic LV posterior wall thickness (LVPWs) were not significantly increased in H/M-Sod2-/- mice com"

Mutations of the gene encoding MMP-2, an extracellular matrix-degrading enzyme, are associated with a human genetic disorder characterized by subcutaneous nodules, arthropathy, and focal osteolysis. It is not known how the loss of MMP-2 function results in the pathology. Here, we show that Mmp2-/- mice exhibited opposing bone phenotypes caused by an impaired osteocytic canalicular network. Mmp2-/- mice showed decreased bone mineral density in the limb and trunk bones but increased bone volume in the calvariae. In the long bones, there was moderate disruption of the osteocytic networks and reduced bone density throughout life, whereas osteoblast and osteoclast function was normal. In contrast, aged but not young Mmp2-/- mice had calvarial sclerosis with osteocyte death. Severe disruption of the osteocytic networks preceded osteocyte loss in Mmp2-/- calvariae. Successful transplantation of wild-type periosteum restored the osteocytic canalicular networks in the Mmp2-/- calvariae, suggesting local roles of MMP-2 in determining bone phenotypes. Our results indicate that MMP-2 plays a crucial role in forming and maintaining the osteocytic canalicular network, and we propose that osteocytic network formation is a determinant of bone remodeling and mineralization.

Bone is continuously remodeled to adopt a volume appropriate for the local environment; the amount of bone deposited depends on the balance between bone formation and resorption by bone cells, osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and osteocytes (1Bilezikian J. Raisz L. Rodan G. Principles of Bone Biology. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2002: 3-126Google Scholar). Osteoblasts are bone-forming cells that differentiate from mesenchymal stem cells and secrete extracellular matrix (ECM) 4The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; DMP-1, dentin matrix protein 1; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; NAO, nodulosis, arthropathy, and osteolysis; BMD, bone mineral density; pQCT, peripheral quantitative computed tomography; MAR, mineral apposition rate; BFR/BS, ratio of bone formation rate to bone surface. proteins, which are subsequently mineralized. Osteoclasts are bone-resorbing cells that differentiate from hematopoietic stem cells and degrade bone ECM proteins after demineralization in the extracellular space (Howship's lacunae) adjacent to the ruffled borders. In contrast to osteoblasts and osteoclasts, which act at bone surfaces, osteocytes, cells of osteoblastic lineage, are embedded in bone and are terminally differentiated. Osteocytes extend their dendritic processes into the bone matrix to constitute a well developed canalicular network with other cells. Although osteocytes are the most abundant cell type in bone tissue, their role in bone metabolism is not firmly established. ECM production and degradation by bone cells are critical steps in bone metabolism (1Bilezikian J. Raisz L. Rodan G. Principles of Bone Biology. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2002: 3-126Google Scholar), and disturbed ECM turnover leads to bone disease. Type I collagen is a major ECM component. Secreted type I collagen molecules are processed by propeptidases and cross-linked by lysyl oxidases into mature collagen. Mutations of genes encoding type I collagen cause the bone disease osteogenesis imperfecta (2Byers P.H. Steiner R.D. Annu. Rev. Med. 1992; 43: 269-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Type I collagens are mainly degraded by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which exert their enzymatic activity at a neutral pH in a zinc ion-dependent manner (3Nagase H. Woessner Jr., J.F. J. Biol.

Recent linkage analysis suggests that a loss of function mutation of MMP2 causes a human autosomal recessive disorder with multicentric nodulosis, arthropathy with joint erosion, and osteolysis, termed NAO syndrome (10Martignetti J.A.

The finding that NAO syndrome is caused by a loss of MMP-2 activity raises questions about how an ECM-degrading enzyme affects bone volume (10Martignetti J.A. Aqeel A.A. Sewairi W.A. Boumah C.E.

We previously generated mice devoid of MMP-2 by gene targeting and observed a subtle retardation in their growth rate (15Itoh T. Ikeda T. Gomi H. Nakao S. Suzuki T. Itohara S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22389-22392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). In the present study, we found marked skeletal abnormalities in the Mmp2-/- mice with decreased mineralization of long bones but increased bone deposition with osteocytic death in the calvariae. The data suggest that mild impairment in canalicular formation affects bone mineralization, but complete disruption of the osteocytic networks enhances osteoblastic activity and increases bone formation. We propose that osteocytes, through their canalicular networks, control osteoblast function and possibly modulate secondary mineralization. Animals—The MMP-2-deficient mice (15Itoh T. Ikeda T.

Homozygous mutants were obtained by crossing heterozygotes. The Mmp2-/- mice were maintained in the animal facility of the RIKEN Brain Science Institute, with dry food pellets and water available ad libitum. The Col1a1r/r mice (16Liu X. Wu H. Byrne M.

Investig. 2000; 106: 941-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) were maintained in the animal facility at Massachusetts General Hospital. All of the experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees. Radiographic Measurement—For soft x-ray radiograms, the mice were subjected to X-irradiation at 25 mA for 2 s. For bone mineral density (BMD) measurement, whole bodies and isolated bones were scanned with a Lunar PIXImus2 densitometer (GE Yokogawa Medical Systems, Tokyo, Japan). Peripheral Quantitative Computed Tomography (pQCT) Analysis—For pQCT analyses, isolated bones were subjected to XCT Research SA+ (Stratec Medizintechnik GmbH, Pforzheim, Germany). Femoral bones were scanned in two 0.46-mm-thick slices with a 0.08-mm voxel size. The slice 1.4 mm from the distal growth plate was used for cancellous BMD, and the slice 5.5 mm from the distal growth plate was used for cortical BMD. Calvarial bones were scanned at a 0.46-mm slice thickness and 0.05-mm voxel size. The coronal slice at the middle of parietal bones was used for calvarial BMD. Bone Histomorphometry—Tibial and femoral bones were fixed in 70% ethanol, and the nondecalcified bones were embedded in methylmethacrylate. For cancellous bone, longitudinal sections of tibial bone (3 μm thick) were stained with toluidine blue. Measurements were made at 400× magnification on a minimum of 20 optical fields between 450 and 1650 μm from the epiphyseal growth plate and 150 μm from the lateral cortices of the secondary spongiosa. For cortical bone, cross-sections (25 μm thick) of the femoral midshafts were stained with toluidine blue. The measurements were made at 400× magnification on a minimum of 30 optical fields. Calvarial bones were fixed in 70% ethanol, and the nondecalcified bones were embedded in glycomethacrylate. Coronal sections (3 μm thick) were cut and stained with toluidine blue. The measurements were made at 400× magnification on a minimum of 12 optical fields at 0.3 mm from the calvarial midline to both lateral sides. The mineral apposition rate was calculated by measuring the interval between two calcein-labeled lines following two intraperitoneal injections of calcein (4.0 mg/kg each). The nomenclature, symbols, and units used are those recommended by the Nomenclature Committee of the American Society of Bone and Mineral Research (18Parfitt A.M. Drezner M.K. Glorieux F.H. Kanis J.A. Malluche H. Meunier P.J. Ott S.M. Recker R.R. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1987; 2: 595-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (4920) Google Scholar). Histology—The bones were isolated and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, decalcified in 25% formic acid for 4-14 days at room temperature, and embedded in paraffin. For MMP-2 staining, anti-human MMP-2 monoclonal antibody 42-5D11 (Daiichi, Takaoka, Japan) was used at 10 μg/ml. For dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP-1) and sclerostin (the SOST gene product) staining, anti-rat DMP-1 polyclonal antibody M176 (Takara Bio, Ohtsu, Japan) and anti-mouse SOST polyclonal antibody MAB1589 (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) were used at 2 and 50 μg/ml, respectively, after 0.25% trypsin/EDTA treatment at 37 °C for 15 min. Staining of Bone Canaliculi—Bone canaliculi were stained using the previously described Bodian method with minor modifications (19Kusuzaki K. Kageyama N. Shinjo H. Murata H. Takeshita H. Ashihara T. Hirasawa Y. Acta Orthop. Scand. 1995; 66: 166-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 20Kusuzaki K. Kageyama N. Shinjo H. Takeshita H. Murata H. Hashiguchi S. Ashihara T. Hirasawa Y. Bone. 2000; 27: 655-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Deparaffinized sections were stained with protein-silver solution containing copper balls at 37 °C for 24 h and reduced in 1% hydroquinone and 5% formalin for 30 min. The sections were then treated with 0.5% gold chloride solution for 50 min and 2% oxalic acid solution for 60 min. Finally, they were dehydrated and embedded for microscopic observation. Cell Culture—Bone marrow was flushed from the femora, and the cells were plated at 1 × 106 cells/well. For mineralized nodule formation, the cells were cultured for 25 days in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid and 10 mm β-glycerophosphate. The mineralized nodules were stained with alizarin red. For osteoclast formation, cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10 nm 1, 25 (OH)2 vitamin D3, and 100 nm dexamethasone for 10 days and visualized by tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining. Calvarial primary cells were obtained from the outgrowth cultures of bone fragments of calvariae taken from 55-week-old Mmp2+/+ and Mmp2-/- mice. The cells were cultured in DMEM. After reaching confluence, the cells were reseeded at 3 × 104 cells/well into 96-well plates and cultured in DMEM containing 0.5 or 5% fetal bovine serum. Three days after plating, the cells were subjected to 3-(4,5-dimethylthioazol-2yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay and alkaline phosphatase assay, for measuring proliferation and osteoblastic differentiation, respectively. Transplantation—Calvarial periosteal tissues were stripped from 6-week-old Mmp2+/- and heads of 10-day-old Mmp2-/- mice, and the skins were stitched. Four Mmp2+/- and three Mmp2-/- donor mice and seven Mmp2-/- recipient mice were used. Two Mmp2+/- mice, which were littermates of Mmp2-/- recipient mice, were used as positive controls. The calvarial tissues of the recipient mice were harvested 2 weeks after transplantation and subjected to fixation, decalcification, and paraffin embedding.

Mmp2-/- Mice Have Facial Abnormalities and Other Bone Alterations—Mmp2-/- mice had facial abnormalities such as short snouts, hypertelorism, and dome-shaped heads (Fig. 1A). The skulls of 45-week-old Mmp2-/- mice also differed from those of Mmp2+/+ (wild-type) mice, with deformed parietal bones and sutures (Fig. 1B). The jaws of Mmp2-/- mice were ∼20% smaller than those of Mmp2+/+ mice (data not shown), and Mmp2-/- mice had a smaller body size (Fig. 1C) (15Itoh T. Ikeda T. Gomi H. Nakao S. Suzuki T. Itohara S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22389-22392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Radiographic analyses also revealed osteopenia in Mmp2-/- mice (Fig. 1C). There was medullary widening with cortical thinning of the femoral bones. Spontaneous fractures often occurred in the tibiae in mice 3 months of age and older. Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry revealed reduced the BMD/unit area in several bones of both 7- and 35-week-old Mmp2-/- mice (Fig. 1D;7 weeks, 55.1 ± 0.6 (+/+) versus 52.3 ± 0.7 (-/-) mg/cm2, p < 0.01; 35 weeks, 67.4 ± 0.7 (+/+) versus 62.0 ± 0.6 (-/-) mg/cm2, p < 0.01). Osteopenia and facial abnormalities are features of NAO syndrome (12Al Aqeel A. Al Sewairi W. Edress B. Gorlin R.J. Desnick R.J. Martignetti J.A. Am. J. Med.

Although the skulls of 45- and 60-week-old Mmp2-/- mice had higher BMD (Fig. 1E; 85.3 ± 1.4 (+/+) versus 92.1 ± 1.8 (-/-) mg/cm2, p < 0.01), the skulls of 7-week-old Mmp2-/- mice had reduced BMD (Fig. 1E; 62.1 ± 0.5 (+/+) versus 55.8 ± 1.6 (-/-) mg/cm2, p < 0.01). The calvarial bones of 55-week-old Mmp2-/- mice were thicker than those of Mmp2+/+ mice (see Fig. 5, A and B). Sclerotic changes occurred only in the calvarial bones. Thus, we observed a novel result of the Mmp2-null mutation, increased calvarial BMD. Some patients with NAO do have sclerotic sutures (13Al-Mayouf S.M. Majeed M. Hugosson C. Bahabri S. Am. J. Med. Genet. 2000; 93: 5-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Heterozygous (Mmp2+/-) mice do not have skeletal abnormalities (not shown), consistent with the inheritance pattern in human NAO syndrome. Gender effects were not observed in the knock-out mice, nor are they reported in NAO patients. Arthropathy, characteristic of human NAO syndrome (12Al Aqeel A. Al Sewairi W. Edress B. Gorlin R.J.

The Mmp2-/- mice, however, are more susceptible to antibody-induced arthritis (21Itoh T. Matsuda H. Tanioka M. Kuwabara K. Itohara S. Suzuki R. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 2643-2647Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), suggesting that some additional factors, environmental or genetic, could be involved in the pathogenesis of arthritis in human NAO syndrome. In addition, the focal osteolysis of NAO syndrome was not observed in the Mmp2-/- mice.FIGURE 5Sclerotic changes of calvarial bones of Mmp2-/- mice.

Long bone is composed of two structure types, cancellous and cortical bone (Fig. 2A) (1Bilezikian J. Raisz L. Rodan G. Principles of Bone Biology. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2002: 3-126Google Scholar). There was no significant difference in cancellous bone matrix volume between genotypes (Fig. 2F). The pQCT analyses revealed that the BMD/unit of volume was significantly reduced in both cancellous and cortical bone (Fig. 2, B-E; cancellous bone (D), 235.5 ± 3.8 mg/cm3 (+/+) versus 197.3 ± 3.8 mg/cm3 (-/-), p < 0.001; cortical bone (E), 928.0 ± 6.6 mg/cm3 (+/+) versus 822.2 ± 9.5 mg/cm3 (-/-), p < 0.001). In cortical bone, there were more insufficiently mineralized regions (<690 mg/cm3; Fig. 2, B and C). Histomorphometric analyses revealed that the mineral apposition rate (MAR) was unchanged in Mmp2-/- mice (Fig. 3, A, B, and D). These morphometric data suggested that the timing and rate of matrix mineralization were normal in Mmp2-/- mice. None of the parameters reflecting the in vivo properties of osteoblasts and osteoclasts was significantly different (Fig. 3, A, B, and D). Furthermore, cultures of bone marrow cells obtained from Mmp2-/- mice developed normally mineralized nodules and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive osteoclasts in vitro (Fig. 4A). These in vivo and in vitro observations suggest that osteoblast and osteoclast functions are not appreciably altered in Mmp2-/- mice. Thus, the results suggest that “secondary” mineralization (22Meunier P.J. Boivin G. Bone. 1997; 21: 373-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 23Follet H. Boivin G. Rumelhart C. Meunier P.J. Bone. 2004; 34: 783-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) is decreased in the limb bones of Mmp2-/- mice. Secondary mineralization, a slow and gradual maturation of the bone mineral component, is measured by quantitative microradiography and was not performed here. Decreases in secondary mineralization are usually due to high rates of bone turnover and a shortening of the life span of basic structural units; high rates of bone turnover, however, were not found in Mmp2-/- mice.FIGURE 4Unaltered properties of osteoblastic and osteoclastic cells from Mmp2-/- mice in vitro. A, in vitro bone marrow cell cultures. Osteoblastic nodule formation and osteoclast formation rates were not different between genotypes. (n = 6 for each genotype and each assay). B, in vitro calvarial cell culture. Proliferation and osteoblastic differentiation were measured by 3-(4,5-dimethylthioazol-2yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) assay, respectively. Proliferation and osteoblastic differentiation of cells from Mmp2-/- mice remained unchanged (n = 6 for each genotype).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Bone Formation Is Enhanced in the Calvariae of Mmp2-/- Mice—Calvarial thickness and BMD were normal at 7 weeks of age (Fig. 5, A and B). Histomorphometric analyses of the calvariae demonstrated normal bone formation in Mmp2-/- calvariae. The matrix was fully mineralized in Mmp2-/- calvariae at this age. The thickness and BMD of Mmp2-/- calvaria, however, were significantly increased by 55 weeks of age (Fig. 5, A and B; thickness, 254 ± 7 μm (+/+) versus 376 ± 12 μm (-/-); p < 0.001, BMD, 851.7 ± 4.3 mg/cm3 (+/+) versus 1051.5 ± 3.0 mg/cm3 (-/-), p < 0.0001). Consistent with these findings, osteoblastic activities, represented by MAR and the ratio of bone formation rate to bone surface (BFR/BS), were significantly increased at 55 weeks of age (Fig. 5D), suggesting that the augmented bone formation resulted in the sclerosis of aged Mmp2-/- calvariae. Osteoblastic cells derived from Mmp2-/- calvariae, however, had proliferation and differentiation properties identical to those of cells derived from Mmp2+/+ calvariae in vitro (Fig. 4B). Thus, in vivo specific mechanisms likely induce calvarial osteoblast hyperactivity in aged Mmp2-/- mice. Osteocytic Cell Death Is Increased in the Calvariae of Mmp2-/- Mice, Not in the Long Bones—Further exploration of bone sections revealed that the ratio of empty lacunae increased with age only in Mmp2-/- calvariae (Fig. 6, A and B; 3 weeks, 2.8 ± 0.3% (+/+) versus 2.3 ± 1.0% (-/-), p > 0.05; 11 weeks, 17.1 ± 1.9% (+/+) versus 30.0 ± 3.2% (-/-), p < 0.001; 55 weeks, 20.0 ± 1.8% (+/+) versus 52.9 ± 1.6% (-/-), p < 0.001). A large number of osteocytes in Mmp2-/- calvariae were positive for TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling at 9 weeks of age, suggesting that the empty lacunae resulted from apoptotic cell death (data not shown). In contrast, the ratios of empty lacunae in Mmp2-/- femora were comparable with those in Mmp2+/+ femora at any age examined (Fig. 6, A and B). There were no differences between genotypes in other bones (Fig. 6C). Thus, the calvaria-specific bone phenotype is closely associated with osteocytic cell death and is caused by the loss of the osteocytic canalicular network. MMP-2 Deficiency Affects Development of the Canalicular Network in Both Long Bones and Calvariae—The above data demonstrated alterations in structure and deposition of bone in long bones and calvariae in Mmp2-/- mice, despite the normal intrinsic properties of the osteoblasts and osteoclasts. To assess the MMP-2 sites of action in bone, immunohistochemistry was performed in sections of femora and calvariae. MMP-2 was detected in the vicinity of osteocytes in both bone types (Fig. 7, A and C). One characteristic feature of bone matrix is a well developed cellular network (1Bilezikian J. Raisz L. Rodan G. Principles of Bone Biology. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2002: 3-126Google Scholar) comprised of osteocytes, which have their cell bodies in the lacunae and extensive dendritic processes in the canalicular channels throughout bone. At a higher magnification, MMP-2 was observed in and around the osteocytic lacunae as well as along the canalicular channels in femora and calvaria (Fig. 7, A and C). There were strong MMP-2 signals close to the bone surface, which represented newly formed osteocytic canaliculi (Fig. 7A, inset). The bone surface mature osteoblasts extended their processes after being embedded in the bone matrix and differentiating into mature osteocytes. These findings suggest that MMP-2 contributes to form and/or maintain the osteocytic network. To examine the role of MMP-2 in the osteocytic network, we stained bone sections using the Bodian method to visualize osteocytic canaliculi (19Kusuzaki K. Kageyama N. Shinjo H. Murata H. Takeshita H. Ashihara T. Hirasawa Y. Acta Orthop. Scand. 1995; 66: 166-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 20Kusuzaki K. Kageyama N. Shinjo H. Takeshita H. Murata H. Hashiguchi S. Ashihara T. Hirasawa Y. Bone. 2000; 27: 655-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Bodian staining revealed a significant impairment of the fine, slender structures of the osteoblastic/osteocytic network in Mmp2-/- femora (Fig. 7, E and G; number of connections between pairs of adjacent lacunae per section, 10.9 ± 0.6 (+/+) versus 3.7 ± 0.3 (-/-), p < 0.001; number of processes protruding from a lacuna per section, 25.9 ± 1.0 (+/+) versus 17.1 ± 0.7 (-/-), p < 0.001). This network was disrupted in Mmp2-/- calvariae (Fig. 7, F and G; number of connections, 6.4 ± 0.3 (+/+) versus 0.3 ± 0.2 (-/-), p < 0.001; number of processes, 13.0 ± 0.5 (+/+) versus 8.3 ± 0.6 (-/-), p < 0.001). Thus, Mmp2-/- mice had a moderately disrupted osteocytic canalicular network in the femora and a severely disrupted osteocytic canalicular network in the calvariae. Restored Canalicular Formation by Wild-type Periosteal Transplantation—To determine whether MMP-2 activity is required locally for osteocytic canalicular formation, we transplanted the periosteal tissues of Mmp2+/- or Mmp2-/- mice onto the calvariae of 10-day-old Mmp2-/- mice. Two weeks after the transplantation, we examined osteocytic canalicular networks in the recipient mice. Osteocytic canalicular networks were successfully formed in one of four Mmp2-/- mice transplanted with Mmp2+/- periosteum (Fig. 8A). To avoid nonspecific osteocyte damage in the recipients, we did not irradiate the recipients before transplantation. Thus, the low rate of canalicular formation may be explained in part by immunological rejection of some of the periosteal transplants. The newly formed osteocytic canaliculi were located in areas adjacent to the transplanted periosteum; MMP-2 was also identified in these areas by immunohistochemistry. We did not observe any formation of osteocytic canaliculi in the sections from the recipients transplanted with Mmp2-/- periosteum. These results suggest that MMP-2 acts locally to form osteocytic canaliculi. Differential Localizations of DMP-1 and Sclerostin in Mmp2-/- Long Bones and Calvarial Bones—The results just described indicated differences in osteocyte canalicular networks in the long bones and calvariae of Mmp2-/- mice.

https://openalex.org/W1997100416,"Hyaluronan (HA) is enriched in the pericellular matrices of many malignant human tumors, and manipulations of HA interactions have strong effects on tumor progression in animal models. Increased HA production stimulates ERBB2 activation, leading to increased cell survival activities and several malignant cell properties. On the other hand, inhibition of constitutive HA-tumor cell interactions in malignant cells inhibits these properties. We have now investigated the role of HA in activation of several additional receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), <i>i.e.</i> IGF1R-β, PDGFR-β, EGFR and c-MET, in colon, prostate, and breast carcinoma cells. In each case we show that antagonists of endogenous HA interactions inhibit their tyrosine phosphorylation, <i>i.e.</i> activation. On the other hand, we show that these RTKs are activated in phenotypically normal or relatively benign tumor cells by experimentally increasing HA production. We also investigated the role of HA in constitutive <i>versus</i> ligand-induced activation of RTKs. In HCA7 colon and C4-2 prostate carcinoma cells, ERBB2 is constitutively activated in a ligand-independent manner, whereas IGF1R-β and PDGFR-β require ligand interaction for activation. We show that both constitutive activation of ERBB2 and ligand-mediated activation of IGF1R-β and PDGFR-β are reversed by co-treatment of the cells with a HA antagonist. We conclude that HA serves a general function in RTK activation."
https://openalex.org/W2091742123,"Much is known about β2-adrenergic receptor trafficking and internalization following prolonged agonist stimulation. However, less is known about outward trafficking of the β2-adrenergic receptor to the plasma membrane or the role that trafficking might play in the assembly of receptor signaling complexes, important for targeting, specificity, and rapidity of subsequent signaling events. Here, by using a combination of bioluminescence resonance energy transfer, bimolecular fluorescence complementation, and confocal microscopy, we evaluated the steps in the formation of the core receptor-G protein heterotrimer complex. By using dominant negative Rab and Sar GTPase constructs, we demonstrate that receptor dimers and receptor-Gβγ complexes initially associate in the endoplasmic reticulum, whereas Gα subunits are added to the complex during endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi transit. We also observed that G protein heterotrimers adopt different trafficking itineraries when expressed alone or with stoichiometric co-expression with receptor. Furthermore, deliberate mistargeting of specific components of these complexes leads to diversion of other members from their normal subcellular localization, confirming the role of these early interactions in targeting and formation of specific signaling complexes."

Nearly 200 million people are estimated to have died in the plague epidemics that devastated the ancient world (Perry and Fetherston, 1997Perry R.D. Fetherston J.D. Yersinia pestis–etiologic agent of plague.Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1997; 10: 35-66Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the successful weaponization of plague in the former Soviet Union bioweapons program has made this pathogen a primary biodefense concern (Henderson, 1999Henderson D.A.

Additional medical concerns arise from the evolution of multidrug resistant strains of the plague bacterium that have been reported in several locations from patient isolates (Galimand et al., 1997Galimand M. Guiyoule A. Gerbaud G. Rasoamanana B. Chanteau S. Carniel E. Courvalin P. Multidrug resistance in Yersinia pestis mediated by a transferable plasmid.N. Engl. J.

Microbiol. 1998; 1: 125-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The plague is caused by the bacterial pathogen Yersinia pestis, which, along with the food-borne agents of gastroenteritis, Y. enterocolitica, and Y. pseudotuberculosis, shares the highly conserved Yersinia virulence plasmid, or pYV, which is necessary to cause disease (Cornelis et al., 1998Cornelis G.R. Boland A. Boyd A.P. Geuijen C. Iriarte M. Neyt C. Sory M.P. Stainier I. The virulence plasmid of Yersinia, an antihost genome.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1315-1352Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This plasmid harbors numerous genes, a large number of which are associated with a type III protein secretion system (T3SS) that confers the ability of diverse pathogens to deliver virulence factors into host cells (Galán and Collmer, 1999Galán J.E.

An important virulence factor of Yersinia spp. is the Yersinia protein kinase A, or YpkA (also called YopO in Y. enterocolitica), a substrate of the T3SS, which was first identified through its important contribution to disease progression and a region of sequence homology to eukaryotic serine/threonine kinases (Galyov et al., 1993Galyov E.E.

Interestingly, this effect appears to be only partially associated with the kinase activity, as mutations in the active site attenuate, but do not abolish, cytoskeletal alterations, and large internal deletions in the protein that are C terminal to the kinase domain are unable to cause cytoskeletal disruptions (Dukuzumuremyi et al., 2000Dukuzumuremyi J.M.

A 20 amino acid peptide at the COOH terminus of YpkA was shown by deletion mutagenesis to be critical for YpkA binding to actin and for kinase autophosphorylation in vitro (Juris et al., 2000Juris S.J. Rudolph A.E. Huddler D. Orth K. Dixon J.E. A distinctive role for the Yersinia protein kinase: actin binding, kinase activation, and cytoskeleton disruption.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2000; 97: 9431-9436Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Therefore, like many eukaryotic protein kinases, the Yersinia kinase appears to interact with and be dependent on several regulatory elements in order to achieve full activity (Huse and Kuriyan, 2002Huse M. Kuriyan J. The conformational plasticity of protein kinases.Cell. 2002; 109: 275-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1356) Google Scholar). We have solved the high-resolution crystal structure of the Rho-GTPase binding domain of YpkA with its small GTPase host target Rac1. Analysis of this structure and biochemical data reveals that YpkA mimics host guanidine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDIs) for the Rho family of small GTPases. This interaction with Rac1 is critical for the cytoskeletal disruption induced by YpkA in cell culture and is also crucial for virulence in mice. A C-terminal region of YpkA, residues 434–732 (Figure S1), is highly soluble and binds to Rac1 and RhoA, although, in agreement with previous studies (Barz et al., 2000Barz C. Abahji T.N. Trülzsch K. Heesemann J. The Yersinia Ser/Thr protein kinase YpkA/YopO directly interacts with the small GTPases RhoA and Rac-1.FEBS Lett. 2000; 482: 139-143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, Dukuzumuremyi et al., 2000Dukuzumuremyi J.M.

Chem. 2000; 275: 35281-35290Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar), not to Cdc42 (Figures S2, 3D, and 3E). Although YpkA (434–732) and Rac1 form a dimer in solution (Figure S2), the complex crystallized as a 2:2 packing (YpkA:Rac1) in the asymmetric unit with a noncrystallographic 2-fold axis of symmetry (Figure 1A). Each molecule of YpkA (434–732) therefore makes contacts (“A” and “B”) to two different Rac1 molecules (Figure 1A). Contact A interacts nearly exclusively with the regulatory Switch I and Switch II regions of the GTPase, whereas Contact B interacts with two C-terminal helices adjacent to the RhoGTPase “insertion” (relative to the Ras-family small GTPases), distal to the nucletotide and Switch regions. Four facts argue for Contact A being the biologically relevant interaction: (1) it has nearly twice the buried surface area as Contact B, (2) it contacts the critical Switch I and Switch II regions of Rac1, whereas Contact B does not, (3) mutations of Contact A disrupt YpkA-Rac1 interactions, whereas mutations in Contact B do not (see below), and (4) a heterodimer appears to be the biological unit as judged by biochemical experiments (Figures 3 and S2). The overall structure of YpkA (434–732) reveals an elongated, all-helical molecule consisting of two distinct subdomains connected by a 65 Å long “backbone” or “linker helix” (Figures 1A and 1B). The N-terminal subdomain contains most of the sequence-identified, ACC finger-like repeats that resemble, at the sequence level, elements required in host factors for small GTPase binding, whereas the C-terminal subdomain contains the sequence implicated in actin activation. The overall surface of the molecule is highly charged, containing a large basic patch in the GTPase binding domain and a large acidic patch in the actin-activation domain (Figure S3). Despite apparent sequence similarities, the N-terminal subdomain of YpkA (residues 434–615) does not share the coiled-coil fold of host ACC fingers, but instead it consists of six helices organized into two three-helix bundles packed against each other. Each of the bundles is stabilized by hydrophobic zippering in the core, and extensive hydrophobic packing is observed between the bundles. The previously identified regions harboring sequence similarity with ACC fingers (Dukuzumuremyi et al., 2000Dukuzumuremyi J.M. Rosqvist R. Hallberg B. Åkerström B. Wolf-Watz H. Schesser K.

Biol. 1999; 126: 166-170Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar) are not involved in the YpkA-Rac1 interface. The far C-terminal subdomain of YpkA, containing the polypeptide implicated in actin activation (residues 705–732, corresponding to helix α10), is a novel and elongated fold consisting of four helices clustered into two pairs that only moderately interact with each other. The α10 helix (residues 705–730) encompasses the peptide that had been predicted to play a role in the interaction of YpkA with actin, and past work has shown that the deletion of the region eliminates both the ability of YpkA to bind to actin and kinase activity (Juris et al., 2000Juris S.J. Rudolph A.E. Huddler D. Orth K. Dixon J.E. A distinctive role for the Yersinia protein kinase: actin binding, kinase activation, and cytoskeleton disruption.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2000; 97: 9431-9436Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). This helix forms an integral part of the fold of this subdomain, contributing a large number of nonpolar residues to its hydrophobic core. There are very few conformational changes between YpkA (434–732) crystallized alone and YpkA (434–732) in complex with Rac1 (Figure S3). Most differences are located in the C-terminal subdomain of YpkA and involve a slight overall displacement in the positioning of the α7 and α8 helices, as well as alterations in the conformation and relative disorder of solvent exposed loops. Rac1 is little altered by the binding of YpkA except for in the Switch regions as discussed below. YpkA and Rac1 form an interface burying roughly 1600 Å2 and limited to residues 573–601 of YpkA (spanning the helices α5 and α6) contacting the key regulatory Switch I and Switch II regions of Rac1 (Figures 2A–2E). Switch I and Switch II together create a concave pocket into which the α6 (backbone) helix of YpkA inserts (Figure 2B), which, along with the clustering of the Switch II helix with the α5 and α6 helices, cement the interaction tightly. The Switch I contacts involve a large number of hydrophobic, van der Waals interactions with YpkA, as well as several hydrogen bonds at this surface (e.g., residues Asp38 [Rac1] and Arg596 [YpkA], Glu599 [YpkA] and Tyr32 and The35 of Rac1; Figures 2C and 2E). A striking aspect of this interaction with Switch I is that YpkA contacts the conserved Thr35 residue, which is normally involved in magnesium ion coordination (Dvorsky and Ahmadian, 2004Dvorsky R. Ahmadian M.R. Always look on the bright site of Rho: structural implications for a conserved intermolecular interface.EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 1130-1136Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar), resulting in a stable coordination network between the side chain of YpkA Glu599, Rac1 Tyr32, the hydroxyl group of Thr35, its main chain carbonyl oxygen, the magnesium ion, and the hydroxyl group of Thr17 (Figure 2C). At Switch II, the molecular interface between YpkA and Rac1 is quite extensive, forming the largest portion of the protein-protein interactions (Figures 2A, 2B, 2D, and 2E). Most of the contacting residues between YpkA and Rac1 are involved in hydrophobic, van der Waals interactions forming a nonpolar interface between the α5 and α6 helices of YpkA and the α helix and surrounding loops of Switch II. Residues Leu573, Val577, and Val586 of YpkA, along with Leu67 and Leu70 of Rac1, contribute significantly to this hydrophobic interface, making what resembles a hydrophobic zippering motif between the α5 and α6 helices of YpkA and the helical element of Switch II (Figures 2A, 2B, and 2D). This interface between the molecules also includes YpkA Pro585 contacting Rac1 Pro73 at one end, “pinching” off the zipper, along with Tyr591, Asn595, and Ala598 (YpkA) and Trp56 and Asp63 (Rac1), making several van der Waals contacts between each other and the hydrophobic zippering motif. Additionally, Rac1 Tyr64 makes van der Waals contacts with YpkA Glu599, possibly helping to position it for the hydrogen bonding interactions to Tyr32 and Thr35 in the Switch I region of Rac1 described above. Although the binding surface is primarily hydrophobic in nature, it is also stabilized by three polar interactions. The main chain carbonyl oxygen of Rac1 Asp57 forms a hydrogen bond with the phenol group hydroxyl of YpkA Tyr591, as does the acidic group of Rac1 Asp63 with the amino group of YpkA Lys601. Finally, a salt bridge is formed between Rac1 Arg66 and YpkA Asp574 (Figure 2D). To examine the importance of these contacts to complex stability, we mutated three residues of YpkA at the Contact A interaction surface and tested the purified protein for binding to Rac1 and RhoA. The triple mutant consisted of loss-of-contact mutations to alanine (Tyr591Ala, Asn595Ala, and Glu599Ala). Although these mutations do not destabilize YpkA itself, they completely abolish complex formation with both Rac1 and RhoA (Figure 3), strongly supporting the crystallographic analysis. In contrast, mutations in the second binding site in the crystals (Contact B, Figure 1A) had no effect on complex formation (Figure 3). A comparison of the Yersinia YpkA interaction with Rac1 reveals intriguing similarities to the complexes between host cell GDIs and their target Rho family GTPases. An alignment of the complexes of RhoGDI-1(α)-Rac1 (Grizot et al., 2001Grizot S. Faure J. Fieschi F. Vignais P.V. Dagher M.C. Pebay-Peyroula E. Crystal structure of the Rac1-RhoGDI complex involved in nadph oxidase activation.Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10007-10013Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and RhoGDI-2(LyGDI)-Rac2 (Scheffzek et al., 2000Scheffzek K. Stephan I. Jensen O.N. Illenberger D. Gierschik P. The Rac-RhoGDI complex and the structural basis for the regulation of Rho proteins by RhoGDI.Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 122-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) with YpkA-Rac1 reveals that the Switch I polypeptide adopts a very similar conformation in all of these structures (Figure 4A). In addition, the residues of Switch I that make contacts with the host cell GDIs possess nearly identical conformations in the Rac1 complex with YpkA (Figure 4C). YpkA even appears to mimic a hallmark of the RhoGDI-small GTPase interaction by using an acidic residue to contact Thr35 of the small GTPase to form a highly stable coordination network involving YpkA Glu599, the hydroxyl group of Thr35, the carbonyl oxygen of Thr35 with the magnesium ion, and the hydroxyl oxygen of Thr17 (Grizot et al., 2001Grizot S. Faure J. Fieschi F. Vignais P.V. Dagher M.C. Pebay-Peyroula E.

Biol. 2000; 7: 122-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). This structural stabilization of Switch I in the GDP bound conformation results in an inhibition of nucleotide exchange. YpkA, therefore, possesses the key contacts seen between host RhoGDIs and their target GTPases at Switch I (Figures 4A and 4C). YpkA contacts many of the same residues in Switch II as RhoGDI, although the details of the molecular interactions differ (Figure 4C). For example, the conformation of Switch II in the YpkA Rac1 structure is different from that seen in RhoGDI complexes with small GTPases, where Switch II is found in a conformation nearly identical to the GTP bound forms of the small G proteins. YpkA instead contacts these residues in Switch II in such as manner as to stabilize the region in a conformation similar to the structures of the GTPases bound to GDP. Indeed, both Switch I and Switch II of Rac1 in the YpkA structure are almost identical to the crystal structure of RhoA bound to GDP (Wei et al., 1997Wei Y. Zhang Y. Derewenda U. Liu X. Minor W. Nakamoto R.K. Somlyo A.V. Somlyo A.P. Derewenda Z.S. Crystal structure of RhoA-GDP and its functional implications.Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 699-703Crossref Scopus (153) Google Scholar), indicating that YpkA acts to lock the small GTPase in the GDP bound, or physiologically “off,” conformation. RhoGDIs are so named for their ability to maintain small GTPases in an “inactive” physiological state, specifically through the inhibition of nucleotide exchange in the small GTPases. This inhibition is achieved by stabilizing the coordination of the magnesium ion and preventing both the ion and the bound GDP/GTP from dissociating (Scheffzek et al., 2000Scheffzek K. Stephan I. Jensen O.N. Illenberger D. Gierschik P. The Rac-RhoGDI complex and the structural basis for the regulation of Rho proteins by RhoGDI.Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 122-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). This prevents both intrinsic exchange of the GDP/GTP nucleotide and that catalyzed by guanidine nucleotide exchange factors, or GEFs. Given the similarities at the structural level with host RhoGDIs, we therefore examined whether YpkA could inhibit the intrinsic and catalyzed exchange of nucleotides for Rac1, RhoA, and Cdc42. As shown in Figure 5A, when Rac1, RhoA, or Cdc42 are incubated in the presence of mant-GTP, a fluorescent nucleotide analog, there is an increase of fluorescence signal over time, indicating that increasing amounts of the labeled nucleotide have been bound (Experimental Procedures). The addition of YpkA (434–732) results in a marked decrease in nucleotide exchange for Rac1 and RhoA, but only a modest decrease for Cdc42 (Figure 5A). In contrast, the triple mutant (Contact A mutant) of YpkA that is impaired in Rac1 and RhoA binding was unable to inhibit the exchange of GTP (Figure 5A). Similar results are observed if we challenge the system with a potent GEF, Salmonella SopE (Buchwald et al., 2002Buchwald G. Friebel A. Galán J.E. Hardt W.D. Wittinghofer A. Scheffzek K.

Green fluorescent protein-tagged L101P, L982P, L1553P, Q1591P, and Ins1518fs/ter1519 mutant proteins remained localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, and processing of oligosaccharide was impaired, whereas wild-type and N568D, G1221S, and L1580P mutant ABCA3 proteins trafficked to the LAMP3-positive intracellular vesicle, accompanied by processing of oligosaccharide from high mannose type to complex type. Vanadate-induced nucleotide trapping and ATP-binding analyses showed that ATP hydrolysis activity was dramatically decreased in the N568D, G1221S, and L1580P mutants, accompanied by a moderate decrease in ATP binding in N568D and L1580P mutants but not in the G1221S mutant, compared with the wild-type ABCA3 protein. In addition, mutational analyses of the Gly-1221 residue in the 11th transmembrane segment and the Leu-1580 residue in the cytoplasmic tail, and homology modeling of nucleotide binding domain 2 demonstrate the significance of these residues for ATP hydrolysis and suggest a mechanism for impaired ATP hydrolysis in G1221S and L1580P mutants. Thus, surfactant deficiency because of <i>ABCA3</i> gene mutation may be classified into two categories as follows: abnormal intracellular localization (type I) and normal intracellular localization with decreased ATP binding and/or ATP hydrolysis of the ABCA3 protein (type II). These distinct pathophysiologies may reflect both the severity and effective therapy for surfactant deficiency."

To investigate the importance of the N-glycans of this integrin in detail, sequential site-directed mutagenesis was carried out to remove single or combined putative N-glycosylation sites on theα5 integrin. Removal of the putative N-glycosylation sites on the β-propeller, Thigh, Calf-1, or Calf-2 domains of the α5 subunit resulted in a decrease in molecular weight compared with the wild type, suggesting that all of these domains contain attached N-glycans. Importantly, the absence of N-glycosylation sites (sites 1–5) on the β-propeller resulted in the persistent association of integrin subunit with calnexin in the endoplasmic reticulum, which subsequently blocked heterodimerization and its expression on the cell surface.

Cell. 2002; 110: 673-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6955) Google Scholar). Another important feature of integrin is inside-out signaling, in which intracellular signals received by integrin or other receptors, in turn, activate its extracellular domain and contribute to the assembly of the extracellular matrix (4Hynes R.O.

Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 97-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (5004) Google Scholar, 10Dwek R.A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 1-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 11Saxon E. Bertozzi C.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Among the integrin superfamily, α5β1 is one of the best characterized integrins. It has been reported that the presence of N-glycans on integrinα5β1 is required forαβ heterodimer formation and proper integrin-matrix interactions (12Gu J. Taniguchi N. Glycoconj. J. 2004; 21: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 13Bellis S.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1663: 52-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Indeed, the integrin cannot bind to its substrate or be normally transported to the cell surface in the presence of the glucosylation inhibitor tunicamycin (14Chammas R. Veiga S.S. Line S. Potocnjak P. Brentani R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3349-3355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, treatment of the purified integrin with N-glycosidase F resulted in blocking the inherent association of both subunits and the interaction between integrin and FN, suggesting that N-glycosylation is essential for the integrin to be functional (15Zheng M. Fang H. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12325-12331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Integrin-mediated biological functions such as cell spreading and cell migration can be modulated as a consequence of an aberrant change in the N-glycosylation of integrins, which is often associated with a carcinogenic process (12Gu J. Taniguchi N. Glycoconj. J. 2004; 21: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 13Bellis S.L. Biochim. Biophys.

Several research groups, including our group, recently reported that alterations in the oligosaccharide portion of integrin α5β1, which are modulated by the expression of each glycosyltransferase gene such as N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-V (GnT-V), GnT-III, and α2,6-sialytransferase, regulate cell malignant phenotypes such as α5β1-mediated cell migration and cell spreading (19Guo H.B.

It has also been reported that alterations in the glycosylation state on the integrin affect its binding affinity to FN. In the case of the addition of a bisecting GlcNAc, a product of GnT-III, to the α5 subunit, its binding to FN was reduced substantially (20Isaji T. Gu J. Nishiuchi R. Zhao Y. Takahashi M. Miyoshi E. Honke K. Sekiguchi K. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19747-19754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Conversely, the expression of hyposialylated integrin α5β1 was reported to be induced by phorbol ester-stimulated differentiation in myeloid cells, resulting in an increase FN binding (21Semel A.C. Seales E.C. Singhal A. Eklund E.A. Colley K.J. Bellis S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32830-32836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Alterations of N-glycans on integrins could also regulate their cis interactions with membrane-associated proteins, including the epidermal growth factor receptor, the urokinase-type plasminogen activation receptor, and the tetraspanin family of proteins (22Gu J.

Although the N-glycosylation of integrin α5β1 plays crucial roles in heterodimer formation and its biological functions, it contains 26 potential N-linked glycosylation sites, 14 in the α subunit and 12 in the β subunit. In this study, to determine which of the N-glycosylation sites on the α5 subunit are essential for these functions, we sequentially mutated one or combined asparagine residues in the putative N-glycosylation sites to glutamine residues, and then transfected these mutant genes into α5-deficient Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (CHO-B2). We found that the N-glycosylation on the β-propeller domain of the α5 subunit, in particular sites number 3–5 sites, is essential for its heterodimer formation and its biological functions such as cell spreading and cell migration, as well as the proper folding of the α5 subunit. Antibodies—A hybridoma producing monoclonal antibody (mAb) against the human integrin α5 subunit (BIIG2) and the supernatant of the hybridoma of hamster integrin β1 subunit (7E2) were purchased from Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa (26Damsky C.H. Fitzgerald M.L. Fisher S.J. J. Clin. Investig. 1992; 89: 210-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar, 27Brown P.J. Juliano R.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1988; 177: 303-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The BIIG2 antibody was purified from the hybridoma supernatant with protein G-Sepharose™ 4 Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences). For Western blot analysis, mAb against human integrin α5 subunit (clone1) was obtained from BD Biosciences. The rabbit antibody anti-integrin α5 carboxyl-terminal domain (AB1949) and a non-functional blocking antibody (HA5, MAB1999) were purchased from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). The peroxidase-conjugate goat antibody against mouse IgG was obtained from Promega (Madison, WI.). Alexa Fluor 546 goat anti-mouse IgG and phalloidin Alexa Fluor 546 were obtained from Invitrogen. The goat antibody against the green fluorescent protein (GFP) was obtained from Rockland Immunochemicals, Inc. (Gilbertsville, PA). Integrin α5 Subunit Expression Vector—The cDNA of the human integrin α5 subunit was amplified by PCR from the reverse-transcribed product of human placenta total RNA (OriGene Technologies, Inc., Rockville, MD) to yield the fragment flanked by the NheI and XhoI sites for 5′ and just before the stop codon using a mutagenic PCR primer. This complete cDNA of the integrin α5 subunit was cloned into a cloning vector (pGEMT-Easy; Promega, Madison, WI). The sequence of the full length of cDNA was confirmed using an ABI PRISM 3100 genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems Japan Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Mutations were introduced into the cDNA for α5 using a QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For expression in mammalian cells, these α5 cDNAs were digested by NheI and XhoI and ligated to multiple cloning sites of NheI and SalI (XhoI-compatible cohesive end) of pEGFP-N1 (BD Biosciences) with using the T4 ligase. The GFP-tagged α5 subunit contains a 13-amino acid linker (STVPRARDPPVAT) between the carboxyl-terminal domain of α5 and the GFP tag. The coding regions of all constructs of cDNA of the α5 subunit were sequenced, to confirm the presence of the desired mutations as shown Fig. 1 without any additional mutation. Cell Culture—Integrin α5 subunit-deficient CHO K1 mutant cells (CHO-B2) were a gift from Dr. Rudolf Juliano (School of Medicine, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill) (28Schreiner C.L. Bauer J.S. Danilov Y.N. Hussein S. Sczekan M.M. Juliano R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3157-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). CHO-B2 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). The cDNA of integrin α5-GFP WT and mutants were transfected into CHO-B2 cells with Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were selected in the presence of 1.5 mg/ml G418 disulfate (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan). The antibiotic-resistant and GFP-positive colonies were picked up and used in subsequent studies. Cell Adhesion—Cell spreading assays were performed as described previously with minor modifications (20Isaji T. Gu J. Nishiuchi R. Zhao Y. Takahashi M. Miyoshi E. Honke K. Sekiguchi K. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19747-19754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Briefly, 96-well microtiter plates (Nunc, Wiesbaden, Germany) were coated with a solution of 10 μg/ml human serum FN (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) overnight at 4 °C and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in DMEM for 1 h at 37 °C. The cells were detached with trypsin containing 1 mm EDTA, washed with serum-containing DMEM, and then suspended in serum-free DMEM with 0.1% BSA at 4 × 104 cells/ml. To confirm whether or not the cell spreading on FN was α5β1 integrin-dependent, cells were preincubated with the functional blocking mAb against α5 (BIIG2) or rat control IgG at final concentrations at 10 μg/ml at room temperature for 10 min before plating. After a 20-min incubation, nonadherent cells were removed by washing with PBS, and the attached cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in PBS, and representative fields were then observed by phase contrast microscopy. Cell Migration—Transwell (BD BioCoat™ Control Inserts, 8.0-μm inserts; BD Biosciences) were coated by incubation in 10 μg/ml FN in PBS overnight at 4 °C followed by an incubation with 1% BSA for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were detached with a trypsin containing 1 mm EDTA, washed once with DMEM containing 10% FBS, and then suspended in DMEM containing 1% FBS at 1 × 106 cells/ml. The cell suspension (100 μl) was preincubated with the anti-α5 integrin antibody (BIIG2) or rat control IgG at a final concentration of 10 μg/ml for 10 min, and then added to each upper side of the chamber. After 3 h of incubation at 37 °C, the remaining cells on the upper side of the chamber were carefully scraped off with a cotton swab. Cells that migrated to the lower surface of the membrane were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in PBS, stained with 0.3% crystal violet for 30 min, and then observed under a phase-contrast microscope and counted as migrated cells. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Glass coverslips (Iwaki, Tokyo, Japan) were coated with FN (20 μg/ml) in PBS overnight at 4 °C and then blocked with 1% BSA. The wild type and mutant of CHO-B2 cells were replated on the coverslips by incubation for 2 h in DMEM containing 1% BSA. The cells were then fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 at room temperature for 5 min. The integrin β1 subunit was visualized by incubating cells with the mAb against the hamster integrin β1 subunit (7E2), followed by incubation with Alexa Fluor 546 goat anti-mouse IgG. Actin filaments were stained with Alexa Fluor 546-conjugated phalloidin. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot—Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed in lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% (w/v) Nonidet P-40, Complete™ EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics). The cell lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were collected, and protein concentrations were determined by means of a protein assay Coomassie Brilliant Blue kit (Nacalai Tesque). Equal amounts of protein samples were incubated with 2 μg of each antibody for 1 h and then 15 μl of protein G-Sepharose was added for another 1-h incubation at 4 °C. To avoid antibody (IgG) contamination in the immunocomplexes, because IgG migrated at a rate similar to the integrins under nonreducing conditions on SDS-PAGE, we cross-linked goat antibody with protein G-Sepharose by means of disuccinimidyl substrate (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer. Equal amounts of proteins were subjected to 7.5% SDS-PAGE and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). The membrane was incubated with primary and secondary antibodies for 1 h each, and detection was performed using an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell Surface Biotinylation—Cell surface biotinylation was performed as described previously with minor modifications (20Isaji T. Gu J. Nishiuchi R. Zhao Y. Takahashi M. Miyoshi E. Honke K. Sekiguchi K. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19747-19754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Briefly, semi-confluent cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and then incubated with ice-cold PBS containing 0.2 mg/ml sulfosuccinimidobiotin (Pierce) for 1 h at 4°C. After washing three times with ice-cold PBS, the cells were harvested and lysed in lysis buffer as described above. The resulting cell lysate was immunoprecipitated with the anti-integrin α5 antibody. The immunocomplex was subjected to 7.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The biotinylated proteins were detected with a Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA). Metabolic Labeling—For pulse-chase experiments, cells grown at 90% confluence on 6-well dishes were washed three times with FBS-free medium and then starved for 30 min in DMEM by excluding methionine and cysteine (Sigma). After starvation, the cells were pulse-labeled in 500 μl of DMEM containing 200 μCi of [35S]methionine and cysteine (Amersham Biosciences) for 30 min, and then chased with complete DMEM containing 10% FBS at the indicated times. The cells were lysed, and the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with the goat anti-GFP polyclonal antibody or anti-hamster β1 subunit antibody. The immunoprecipitates were separated on 7.5% SDS-PAGE. After drying the gels, radioactive bands were visualized with a Fuji BAS 2500 Bio-Image Analyzer. Flow Cytometry Analysis—Flow cytometry analysis was performed as described previously with minor modifications (20Isaji T. Gu J. Nishiuchi R. Zhao Y. Takahashi M. Miyoshi E. Honke K. Sekiguchi K. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19747-19754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells in semi-confluent conditions were detached from 10-cm culture dishes using trypsin containing 1 mm EDTA and stained with and without a primary antibody (BIIG2, HA5, or P1D6), followed by incubation with Alexa Fluor 647 goat anti-rat IgG (for BIIG2) or anti-mouse IgG (for HA5 and P1D6). After washing three times with PBS, flow cytometry analyses were performed using a FACSCalibur instrument (BD Biosciences) operated with CELLQuestPro software. Construction of Various Integrin α5 Mutants by the Mutagenesis of Potential N-Glycosylation Sites—Human integrin α5 contains 14 N-glycosylation sites (Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr), Asn-84, Asn-182, Asn-297, Asn-307, Asn-316, Asn-524, Asn-530, Asn-593, Asn-609, Asn-675, Asn-712, Asn-724, Asn-773, and Asn-868, as shown in Fig. 1, which are located in the extracellular segment and are well conserved in the human, mouse, and rat. The potential N-glycosylation mutants were constructed as shown in Fig. 1 and as follows: 14 single mutants (N84Q, N182Q, N297Q, N307Q, N316Q, N524Q, N530Q, N593Q, N609Q, N675Q, N712Q, N724Q, N773Q, and N868Q), combined mutants (N87Q/N182Q/N297Q/N307Q/N316Q and N524Q/N530Q/N593Q/N609/N675Q/N712Q/N724Q/N773Q/N868Q), and the removal of all sites other than indicated sites (N297/N307/N316) as the S3-5 mutant in the presumed β-propeller, Thigh, Calf, and whole domains, respectively. The mutant cDNAs were transfected to CHO-B2 cells, an α5-deficient cell line, and stable cell lines for the expression of α5 integrin were selected with G418. Effects of the Removal of N-Glycosylation Sites on Integrin α5 on FN-mediated Cell Spreading, Migration, and Cytoskeleton Formation—Although it is known that the N-glycosylation of integrin α5β1 is essential for its functions (14Chammas R. Veiga S.S. Line S. Potocnjak P. Brentani R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3349-3355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Zheng M. Fang H. Hakomori S. J. Biol.

Biol. 1984; 101: 212-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), the distinctive roles of N-glycosylation on each domain are not completely understood. To examine the effects of unglycosylation in the β-propeller domain or Thigh and Calf domain of α5, corresponding to Δ1–5 and Δ6–14, respectively, on cell spreading and migration, we transfected these mutated cDNAs into CHO-B2 cells. As expected, the expression of wild type (WT) α5 subunit, but not GFP control, extensively rescued cell adhesion on FN (Fig. 2), supporting that CHO-B2 cells are a useful cell model for studies of integrin α5 functions (28Schreiner C.L. Bauer J.S. Danilov Y.N. Hussein S. Sczekan M.M. Juliano R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3157-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 30Zhang Z. Vuori K. Reed J.C. Ruoslahti E. Proc. Natl.

Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1427-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). The cell spreading on FN was completely inhibited by an anti-α5 functional blocking antibody but not by normal rat IgG (data not shown), indicating that the initial cell spreading on FN is mediated through integrin α5. On the other hand, overexpression of the unglycosylation mutant of β-propeller Δ1–5 did not rescue cell spreading. In contrast, the transfection of the Δ6–14 mutant significantly induced cell attachment and cell spreading on FN-coated dishes, as did the overexpression of the WT. Of particular interest, cells expressing the S3-5 mutant, in which the 3–5 N-glycosylation sites on α5 subunit are present only, showed comparable abilities for cell spreading as cells expressing the WT. In addition, cells expressing the Δ6–9 mutant on the Thigh domain or the Δ10–14 mutant on the Calf-1,2 domains were also able to rescue cell spreading on FN (data not shown). These results strongly suggest that the N-glycosylation on the β-propeller of the α5 subunit is essential for biological function. It is noteworthy that the overexpression of each 14 single unglycosylation mutant efficiently rescued cell spreading (data not shown). Consistent with cell spreading, cell migration on FN was observed in cells expressing WT of the α5 subunit using a Borden chamber assay (Fig. 3). Cell migration was completely blocked by incubation with a functional blocking antibody of integrin α5, but not normal rat IgG, suggesting that the integrin α5 plays a major role in cell migration on FN. Interestingly, cell migration was completely blocked in Δ1–5 transfectants as observed in mock transfectants. On the other hand, cell migration for Δ6–14 as well as the S3-5 transfectants had comparable activities to the WT transfectants. Integrin-mediated cell adhesion on the extracellular matrix usually activates small G proteins such as Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 to promote cytoskeletal formation. In fact, stress fiber formation was clearly observed in cells expressing the WT, Δ6–14, or S3-5 of the α5 subunits but not the Δ1–5 mutant or the mock control (Fig. 4). These findings strongly suggest that N-glycosylation on the β-propeller of integrin α5 is essential for integrin α5-mediated cell spreading, migration, and cytoskeletal formation.FIGURE 4Comparison of actin stress fiber formation among various transfectants spread on FN. Cells were detached and then replated on coverslips that had been pre-coated with 20 μg/ml FN in PBS and blocked with a 1% BSA as described under “Materials and Methods.” After incubation for 2 h, cells were fixed, permeabilized, and then visualized with phalloidin-Alexa 549 (actin) and GFP tag (α5 integrin), respectively. The bar is 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) N-Glycosylation on β-Propeller of α5 Subunit Is Essential for Its Expression on the Cell Surface—To explore the molecular mechanisms associated with the reduced abilities for cell spreading and migration in transfectants expressing the Δ1–5 subunit, we examined the expression levels of each mutant in total cell lysates or on cell surfaces. As shown in Fig. 5A, each mutant expressed comparable levels of α5 subunit, as confirmed by the use of an anti-integrin α5 antibody. It was also clear that each domain of the α5 subunit carries N-glycans, because the band for each mutant migrated faster than that for the WT. Moreover, after treatment with N-glycosidase F, all bands of the mutated or WT α5 subunits shifted to around 90 kDa under reducing conditions (data not shown). On the other hand, the expression levels of α5 subunits on the cell surface were examined by biotinylating the cell surface. Biotin-labeled cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated with an anti-α5 subunit antibody. Surprisingly, the expression level of the Δ1–5 mutant on the cell surface was significantly decreased, compared with those of the WT as well as the Δ6–14 mutant (Fig. 5B). It is important to note that the expression level of the S3-5 mutant was comparable with that of WT, suggesting that N-glycosylation on the β-propeller of the α5 subunit may be essential for its expression on a cell surface. These phenomena were also observed for 293T cells transfected with all of these mutants. N-Glycosylation on β-Propeller Is Required for α/β Heterodimerization—It has been reported that functional integrin α5β1 is required for not only the heterodimerization of α5 and β1 subunits (4Hynes R.O. Cell. 2002; 110: 673-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6955) Google Scholar) but also for the maturation of N-glycans on the integrin (33Akiyama S.K. Yamada S.S. Yamada K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18011-18018Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here we investigated the heterodimeric formation of α5 and β1 subunits by immunoprecipitation and an immunostaining assay. The α subunits expressed in WT, Δ6–14, and the S3-5 transfectants were clearly observed in integrin β1 immunocomplexes. However, the α subunits expressed by Δ1–5 or vector control cells were under the detectable levels in integrin β1 immunocomplexes (Fig. 5C). The β1 subunits expressed in WT, Δ6–14, and S3-5, but not in the Δ1–5 transfectants, were consistently detected in α5 immunocomplexes (Fig. 5D). Surprisingly, the levels of β1 subunits expressed in total cell lysates of the Δ1–5 and GFP cont"

Dyrk1A, a dual specificity tyrosine-regulated kinase (Dyrk) family member, is the mammalian ortholog of the Drosophila minibrain (Mnb) gene, essential for normal postembryonic neurogenesis. The Dyrk1A gene resides in the human chromosome 21q22.2 region, which is associated with DS anomalies, including mental retardation. In this study, we examined whether Dyrk1A interacts with α-synuclein and subsequently affects intracellular α-synuclein inclusion formation in immortalized hippocampal neuronal (H19-7) cells. Dyrk1A selectively binds to α-synuclein in transformed and primary neuronal cells. α-Synuclein overexpression, followed by basic fibroblast growth factor-induced neuronal differentiation, resulted in cell death. We observed that accompanying cell death was increased α-synuclein phosphorylation and intracytoplasmic aggregation. In addition, the transfection of kinase-inactive Dyrk1A or Dyrk1A small interfering RNA blocked α-synuclein phosphorylation and aggregate formation. In vitro kinase assay of anti-Dyrk1A immunocomplexes demonstrated that Dyrk1A could phosphorylate α-synuclein at Ser-87. Furthermore, aggregates formed by phosphorylated α-synuclein have a distinct morphology and are more neurotoxic compared with aggregates composed of unmodified wild type α-synuclein. These findings suggest α-synuclein inclusion formation regulated by Dyrk1A, potentially affecting neuronal cell viability.

In these neurodegenerative disorders (collectively referred to as synucleinopathies), LBs are characterized by fibrillar, cytoplasmic α-synuclein aggregates within selective populations of neurons and glial cells (2Hashimoto M.

Down syndrome (DS) is the most common genetic disorder, with a frequency of 1 in every 700–800 live births, and is caused by an extra copy of all or part of chromosome 21 (5Lejeune J. Turpin R. Gautier M. Bull. Acad. Natl. Med. 1959; 143: 256-265PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to characteristic physical features, DS individuals have congenital heart defects, gastrointestinal malformations, immune and endocrine system defects, a high incidence of leukemia, and early onset of Alzheimer-like dementia. DS individuals also exhibit mild to severe mental retardation (6Korenberg J.R. Chen X.N. Schipper R. Sun Z. Gonsky R. Gerwehr S. Carpenter N. Daumer C. Dignan P. Disteche C. Graham J.M. Hugdins L.

Dual specificity tyrosine-regulated kinase-1A (Dyrk1A), the Mnb kinase human homolog, maps to the DS critical region on chromosome 21. Dyrk1A is thought to be responsible for the DS neurological defects. In DS fetal brains, Dyrk1A expression increases 1.5-fold, and transgenic mice overexpressing Dyrk1A exhibit neurodevelopmental delays, motor abnormalities, and cognitive deficits (11Guimera J.

Constitutive α-synuclein phosphorylation at C-terminal Ser-87 and Ser-129 residues occurs in neuronal and nonneuronal cell lines (13Okochi M. Walter J. Koyama A. Nakajo S. Baba M. Iwatsubo T.

Furthermore, α-synuclein Ser-129 phosphorylation promotes eosinophilic fibril formation in vitro and in SH-SY5Y cells (14Fujiwara H. Hasegawa M. Dohmae N. Kawashima A. Masliah E. Goldberg M.S.

These findings suggest that filamentous protein phosphorylation, including α-synuclein phosphorylation, is important in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders. Interestingly, α-synuclein-positive LBs and neuritic processes frequently occur in DS brains with AD phenotypes (18Lippa C.F. Schmidt M.L. Lee V.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Ann. Neurol. 1999; 45: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). In addition, LB formation frequency in DS patient brains with AD is greater than in sporadic AD cases (19Simard M. van Reekum R. Int. J. Geriatr. Psychiatry. 2001; 16: 311-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). To study the molecular mechanisms leading to LB formation in DS patients, we examined whether Dyrk1A interacts with α-synuclein and affects cytoplasmic inclusion formation in hippocampal neuroprogenitor cells. Our data show that Dyrk1A phosphorylates α-synuclein at the Ser-87 residue. Additionally, Dyrk1A-mediated α-synuclein phosphorylation facilitates its aggregation.

The neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum with penicillin and streptomycin. Rat fetal brain lysates and primary cortical neurons were prepared as described previously (22Yang E.J. Yoon J.H. Chung K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1827-1837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The cells were transfected with Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen), according to the supplier's instructions. To prepare cell lysates, cells were rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and solubilized in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.9, containing 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 mm NaF, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cells were scraped, and supernatants were collected after centrifugation for 10 min at 14,000 × g at 4 °C. Protein concentrations were determined using the detergent-compatible protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Cell Viability—Cell survival quantitation was performed using the tetrazolium salt, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide extraction method, as described previously (23Sung J.Y. Park S.M. Lee C.H. Um J.W. Lee H.J. Kim J. Oh Y.J. Lee S.T. Paik S.R. Chung K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25216-25224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Statistical analyses were completed with the aid of the StatView II program (Abacus Concepts, CA). All data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance and preplanned comparisons with the control were performed by means of Dunnett's T-statistic. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—One microgram of suitable antibodies was incubated with 0.5–1 mg of cell extracts in cell lysis buffer overnight at 4 °C. Fifty microliters of a 1:1 protein A-Sepharose bead suspension was added and incubated for 2 h at 4°C with gentle rotation. Beads were pelleted and washed extensively with cell lysis buffer. Bound proteins were dissociated by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and samples were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore). Membranes were blocked in TBST buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) plus 3% nonfat dry milk for 3 h and then incubated overnight at 4 °C in TBST buffer with 3% nonfat dry milk and the appropriate antibodies. Membranes were washed several times in TBST and then incubated with secondary IgG-coupled horseradish peroxidase antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). After 60 min, the blots were washed several times with TBST and visualized by ECL. Immunocytochemistry—Cells were seeded overnight, at 70% confluence, onto coverslips in 6-well dishes and transfected with the appropriate plasmids the following day for 24 h. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were fixed with neutral buffered 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 1% bovine serum albumin containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 1 h. Cells were incubated at 4 °C for 24 h with the appropriate primary antibody and diluted in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, either rhodamine- or fluorescein isothiocyanate-coupled secondary antibodies were added and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Fixed cells were analyzed by confocal or fluorescence microscopy. Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining—Hematoxylin and eosin staining were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Sigma). We counted cells with eosinophilic inclusions in six different fields, ∼1000 cells/experimental condition. In Vitro Kinase Assay—Confluent cells were harvested in lysis buffer. Soluble cell lysate fraction was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with suitable antibodies. After the addition of protein A-Sepharose beads, the reaction mixture was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C and rinsed with lysis and kinase buffers. Immunocomplex kinase assays were performed by incubating the cell lysates for 2 h at 30 °C with the substrate in the reaction buffer (0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). After reaction termination, the mixtures were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and phosphorylated substrates were visualized by autoradiography. Protein Aggregation Analysis—α-Synuclein aggregation was monitored with both turbidity and thioflavin-T binding fluorescence, as described previously (23Sung J.Y. Park S.M. Lee C.H. Um J.W. Lee H.J.

Purified α-synuclein samples were concentrated to 7 mg/ml using Centricon-3 spin filters (Amicon). After concentration, samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 100,000 × g to remove any aggregates that could have formed during the concentration step. The supernatants were adjusted to a final concentration of 7 mg/ml using Tris-buffered saline, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 0.2 m NaCl. Samples were dispensed into 1.5 ml of Beckman ultracentrifuge microtubes and incubated at 37 °C. At various time points, samples were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 10 min, and supernatants were removed and diluted 10 times with Tris-buffered saline. These dilutions were analyzed by their absorbance at 280 nm. The remaining incubations were vortexed for 30 s to resuspend the pellets. For electron microscopy of α-synuclein aggregates, the samples were prepared as described previously (23Sung J.Y. Park S.M. Lee C.H. Um J.W. Lee H.J. Kim J. Oh Y.J. Lee S.T. Paik S.R. Chung K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25216-25224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Samples were sectioned using an ultramicrotome, double-stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and observed by transmission electron microscopy (Philips CM-10). Construction of Dyrk1A siRNA Duplexes and Transfection—The competitive silencing and noncompetitive control Dyrk1A siRNAs were designed as reported by Sitz et al. (24Sitz J.H. Tigges M. Baumgartel K. Khaspekov L.G. Lutz B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 5821-5834Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and provided by Sigma-Proligo (Boulder, CO). Dyrk1A siRNA duplexes were transfected into cells using the Lipofectamine Plus reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Dyrk1A Binds to and Phosphorylates α-Synuclein in H19-7 Cells—We examined whether the α-synuclein and Dyrk1A interaction occurs in mammalian neuronal cells, such as in immortalized hippocampal H19-7 cells. We previously reported that the endogenous α-synuclein protein levels in H19-7 cells were undetectable (25Sung J.Y. Kim J. Paik S.R. Park J.H. Ahn Y.S. Chung K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27441-27448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 26Kim J. Mol. Cells. 1997; 7: 78-83PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we transiently transfected H19-7 cells with α-synuclein cDNA, immunoprecipitated α-synuclein, and immunoblotted for Dyrk1A. Exogenously expressed α-synuclein binds to endogenous Dyrk1A (Fig. 1A). We confirmed this interaction by reverse co-immunoprecipitation and detecting the HA-tagged Dyrk1A-α-synuclein interaction in the dopaminergic neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell line (Fig. 1, A and B). These data demonstrate that α-synuclein interacts with Dyrk1A in H19-7 and SH-SY5Y cells. Next, we asked if endogenous Dyrk1A interacts with α-synuclein in the mammalian central nervous systems. α-Synuclein and Dyrk1A are highly expressed in rat brain lysates and primary cortical neurons (Fig. 2, A and B). As shown in Fig. 2, α-synuclein selectively associates with Dyrk1A, and we did not observe nonspecific interaction with preimmune IgG or protein A beads (Fig. 2, A and B). Moreover, immunostaining of primary cortical neurons showed that Dyrk1A and α-synuclein co-localize in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2C). These data suggest that the Dyrk1A and α-synuclein interaction is not an artifact observed in transformed cell lines but occurs in the mammalian central nervous system. Dyrk1A Phosphorylates α-Synuclein upon the Stimulation with bFGF in H19-7 Cells—Previously, we showed that basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) addition to H19-7 cells causes Dyrk1A activation, which plays an important role during neuronal differentiation of H19-7 cells (21Yang E.J. Ahn Y.S. Chung K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39819-39824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Based on these findings, we tested whether active Dyrk1A directly phosphorylates α-synuclein. Transient α-synuclein expression in H19-7 cells, followed by bFGF stimulation under the neuronal differentiation conditions, enhanced Ser/Thr phosphorylation within 6 h, reaching a maximum at 1 h (Fig. 3A). Since Dyrk1A acts as a dual specificity protein kinase, which catalyzes the tyrosine-directed autophosphorylation as well as serine/threonine residue phosphorylation in exogenous substrates (27Galceran J. de Graaf K. Tejedor F.J. Becker W. J. Neural. Transm. Suppl. 2003; 67: 139-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), α-synuclein could also be phosphorylated at tyrosine residues. We performed a similar experiment to determine whether α-synuclein was phosphorylated on tyrosine residue(s). As shown in Fig. 3B, we did not detect tyrosine-phosphorylated α-synuclein within 6 h of bFGF treatment, in H19-7 cells. To clarify whether α-synuclein phosphorylation is due to active Dyrk1A, we tested whether a kinase-deficient Dyrk1A mutant or Dyrk1A siRNA duplex affects α-synuclein phosphorylation. As shown in Fig. 3C, α-synuclein phosphorylation was significantly diminished by expressing a kinase-dead Dyrk1A mutant and Dyrk1A siRNA, as compared with control cells. As a negative control, the transient expression of nonsilencing siRNAs did not affect α-synuclein phosphorylation (Fig. 3C). As expected, the Dyrk1A siRNA duplex, but not nonspecific siRNAs, blocked the endogenous Dyrk1A expression in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3C). To verify the specific role of Dyrk1A on α-synuclein phosphorylation, we utilized an in vitro kinase assay. We used immunoprecipitated Dyrk1A, from H19-7 cells, to phosphorylate recombinant α-synuclein (GST-α-synuclein). As shown in Fig. 3D, the serine/threonine phosphorylation(s) of α-synuclein was significantly enhanced upon bFGF stimulation. As a control, GST alone was not phosphorylated by anti-Dyrk1A immunocomplexes (Fig. 3D). Furthermore, anti-Dyrk1A immunocomplexes prepared after α-synuclein transfection with either kinase-inactive Dyrk1A or competitive Dyrk1A siRNAs significantly reduced α-synuclein phosphorylation (Fig. 3E). Transient, noncompetitive Dyrk1A siRNAs had no effect on α-synuclein phosphorylation (Fig. 3E). Taken together, these data suggest that active Dyrk1A selectively phosphorylates α-synuclein at serine/threonine residue(s). Dyrk1A Phosphorylates Ser-87 Residue within α-Synuclein—To identify the specific α-synuclein residues phosphorylated by Dyrk1A, we used recombinant α-synuclein fragments as substrates for an in vitro kinase assay. As shown in Fig. 4A, active Dyrk1A phosphorylated α-synuclein peptides consisting of amino acids 1–140 and 61–95. However, Dyrk1A did not phosphorylate the C-terminal peptide (residues 96–140) or the N-terminal peptide (residues 1–60) (Fig. 4A), suggesting that the critical phosphorylated amino acid(s) resided between amino acids 61 and 95. Sequence analysis identified four possible phosphorylatable serines at positions 9, 42, 87, and 129. Therefore, we hypothesized that Dyrk1A phosphorylated α-synuclein at serine 87. To test this hypothesis, we mutated each serine residue (positions 9, 42, 87, and 129) to an alanine and examined α-synuclein phosphorylation after bFGF stimulation. The α-synuclein mutants S9A and S42A were readily phosphorylated in response to bFGF-induced active Dyrk1A, indicating that these residues were probably not involved in Dyrk1A-mediated phosphorylation (Fig. 4B). However, when cells were transfected with the α-synuclein S87A mutant, bFGF-induced α-synuclein phosphorylation was abolished (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, the α-synuclein S129A also blocked α-synuclein phosphorylation (Fig. 4B), suggesting that active Dyrk1A selectively phosphorylates α-synuclein at the serine 87 residue, whereas neurogenic bFGF appears to activate other protein kinase(s) to modify α-synuclein at the serine 129 residue. This finding was further confirmed by using the antibody against phospho-Ser-129-α-synuclein (PSer-129). Based on our previous finding (13Okochi M. Walter J. Koyama A. Nakajo S. Baba M. Iwatsubo T. Meijer L. Kahle P.J. Haass C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 390-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar), PSer-129 antibody was first verified by in vitro phosphorylation of α-synuclein by casein kinase 1 (Fig. 4C). Then active Dyrk1A immunocomplexes, which were validated through CREB phosphorylation at Ser-133 in vitro (21Yang E.J. Ahn Y.S. Chung K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39819-39824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), was shown not to phosphorylate α-synuclein at Ser-129 (Fig. 4D). The Kinetics and Neurotoxicity Induced by Intact α-Synuclein Inclusions Are Different from the Phosphorylated Forms by Dyrk1A—We monitored protein aggregation of recombinant or phosphorylated wild type α-synuclein samples by measuring the turbidity (Fig. 5A). As monitored by UV absorption at 280 nm, incubating purified α-synuclein at 37 °C led to insoluble aggregate formation. Phosphorylated α-synuclein exhibited more aggressive aggregate formation as compared with unphosphorylated, wild type α-synuclein (Fig. 5A). Measurement of thioflavin-T binding fluorescence confirmed that phosphorylated α-synuclein exhibited enhanced aggregation as compared with unphosphorylated α-synuclein, although the difference was not as large as observed in the turbidity measurements (Fig. 5B). We next asked whether the enhanced aggregation of phosphorylated α-synuclein proteins exhibited greater cytotoxicity. Phosphorylated α-synuclein protein aggregates were more cytotoxic than unphosphorylated α-synuclein aggregates (Fig. 5C). Transmission electron microscopy analysis of the aggregated granular structure formation during the α-synuclein aggregation in the presence of protein phosphorylation was microscopically distinct from those aggregates from unphosphorylated α-synuclein (Fig. 5D). Intact α-synuclein aggregates contained only the fibrillar forms, whereas the inclusions obtained with the Dyrk1A-induced phospho-α-synuclein showed that spherical granular forms are also present, in addition to the fibrillar aggregates (Fig. 5D). The α-Synuclein Phosphorylation via Active Dyrk1A Promotes Intracellular α-Synuclein Inclusion Formation—To validate the consequences of α-synuclein Ser-87 phosphorylation, we tested whether Dyrk1A could influence the insoluble α-synuclein aggregate formation, in H19-7 cells. Previously, we showed that transient α-synuclein expression in H19-7 cells leads to neuronal cell death. This effect is closely associated with the formation of intracytoplasmic α-synuclein-positive inclusions, which have similar composition to LBs found in PD patients (26Kim J. Mol. Cells. 1997; 7: 78-83PubMed Google Scholar). After H19-7 cells were transfected with α-synuclein, the expression pattern ofα-synuclein within the cells was compared in the absence or presence of bFGF. Consistent with our previous finding, the distribution of α-synuclein was uneven and took the form of granular aggregates (Fig. 6A). Stimulation with bFGF enhanced intracytoplasmic α-synuclein inclusion formation (Fig. 6A). Additionally, α-synuclein co-expression with the dominant negative Dyrk1A diminished α-synuclein aggregates, as compared with α-synuclein alone (Fig. 6A). Cells expressing the α-synuclein S87A mutant also exhibited reduced aggregate formation (Fig. 6B). Quantification of intracellular eosinophilic protein aggregates found a 2-fold increase when cells were transfected with α-synuclein plus GFP and stimulated with bFGF (Table 1). However, we did not observe this increase in cells transfected with either α-synuclein S87A or kinase-deficient Dyrk1A in the absence of bFGF stimuli (Table 1).TABLE 1α-Synuclein phosphorylation effects on cell viability and eosinophilic inclusion formation in hippocampal H19-7 cellsTreatmentTransfectionGFP-expressing cells with hematoxylin and eosin-positive inclusionsaNumber of GFP-positive cells containing eosinophilic inclusions was counted in six different fields among approximately 250 cells/experimental condition.

Open table in a new tab Following transient α-synuclein expression, we measured cell viability after 24 h. As shown in Table 1, α-synuclein overexpression significantly decreased the cell viability by ∼42% in H19-7 cells. Consistent with a previous report that H19-7 cells also undergo apoptosis upon differentiation (28Eves E.M. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Wagner A.J. Hay N. Rosner M.R. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 1908-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), bFGF addition resulted in a 25% loss of the total cell population, within 24 h (Table 1). However, co-transfection with wild type α-synuclein plus dominant-negative Dyrk1A diminished the neuronal cell death (Table 1). Furthermore, when cells were transfected with α-synuclein S87A, cytotoxicity was significantly reduced in response to bFGF. As a control, transfection of either kinase-dead Dyrk1A or α-synuclein S87A mutant in the absence of fibroblast growth factor stimulation reduced the toxic effect (Table 1). These data indicate that active Dyrk1A increases intracellular α-synuclein aggregates and potentiates its cytotoxicity in H19-7 cells. Several examples of α-synuclein post-translational modifications have been reported in the human brain, including phosphorylation (14Fujiwara H. Hasegawa M. Dohmae N. Kawashima A. Masliah E.

Margolis R.L. Li X. Troncoso J.C. Lee M.K. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Iwatsubo T. Ross C.A. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 5544-5552Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Supporting this finding, phosphorylated forms of α-synuclein at its Ser-129 and Ser-87 residues are found in LBs (13Okochi M. Walter J. Koyama A. Nakajo S. Baba M. Iwatsubo T. Meijer L. Kahle P.J. Haass C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 390-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Furthermore, α-synuclein post-translational modifications by tyrosine nitration and oxidation can also promote intracytoplasmic inclusion formation (32Hodara R. Norris E.H. Giasson B.I.

Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 378: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). α-Synuclein can be phosphorylated in vitro at several residues, including serines 87 and 129 and three C-terminal tyrosine residues (tyrosines 125, 133, and 136). Several protein kinases were reported to phosphorylate α-synuclein in vitro and/or in vivo. For example, G protein-coupled receptor kinase-2 phosphorylates Ser-129 in vivo and enhances α-synuclein toxicity (16Pronin A.N. Morris A.J. Surguchov A. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26515-26522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Casein kinase 1 and 2 can also phosphorylate Ser-129 of α-synuclein in cultured cells (13Okochi M. Walter J. Koyama A. Nakajo S. Baba M. Iwatsubo T. Meijer L. Kahle P.J. Haass C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 390-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). In addition, the α-synuclein Tyr-125 residue is phosphorylated by c-Src and Fyn (34Ellis C.E. Schwartzberg P.L. Grider T.L. Fink D.W. Nussbaum R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3879-3884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 35Nakamura T. Yamashita H. Nagano Y. Takahashi T. Avraham S. Avraham H. Matsumoto M. Nakamura S. FEBS Lett. 2002; 521: 190-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Although α-synuclein is constitutively phosphorylated at Ser-87 as well as at Ser-129 residues (13Okochi M. Walter J. Koyama A. Nakajo S. Baba M. Iwatsubo T. Meijer L. Kahle P.J. Haass C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 390-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar), the kinase targeting serine 87 residue and its physiological role have not been described. We examined whether α-synuclein is a Dyrk1A phosphorylation target. The current study shows that Dyrk1A can phosphorylate α-synuclein at Ser-87, and this enhances cytoplasmic aggregate formation. In addition to Ser-129, the Ser-87 residue plays an important role modulating cytoplasmic α-synuclein inclusion formation. Dyrk1A catalyzes the tyrosine-directed autophosphorylation and serine/threonine phosphorylation in exogenous substrates (27Galceran J. de Graaf K. Tejedor F.J. Becker W. J. Neural. Transm. Suppl. 2003; 67: 139-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Therefore, we could not exclude the possibility that Dyrk1A can phosphorylate α-synuclein at tyrosine residues. Western blot analysis of anti-α-synuclein immunocomplexes with anti-phosphotyrosine IgGs revealed that the tyrosine residues within the α-synuclein are not probably phosphorylated in response to bFGF-induced active Dyrk1A, in H19-7 cells. Previously, we reported that active Dyrk1A phosphorylates CREB, which subsequently leads to the stimulation of cAMP-response element-mediated gene transcription, during neuronal differentiation (21Yang E.J. Ahn Y.S. Chung K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39819-39824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). These data strongly suggest that Dyrk1A may play an important role during the neurogenic factor-induced differentiation of central nervous system neuronal cells. In addition, our recent findings show that huntingtin-interacting protein-1 phosphorylation by Dyrk1A has an important role in neuronal differentiation and cell death (36Kang J.E. Choi S.A. Park J.B. Chung K.C. J. Neurosci. Res. 2005; 81: 62-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The present study demonstrates that α-synuclein is a Dyrk1A phosphorylation target, and this modification results in enhanced aggregate formation, which potentiates the proapoptotic effects of α-synuclein. Supporting our current findings are other reports that show that Dyrk1A phosphorylates human microtubule-associated tau protein at Thr-212, a residue that is hyperphosphorylated in AD and tauopathies (37Woods Y.L. Cohen P. Becker W. Jakes R. Goedert M. Wang X. Proud C.G. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 609-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Abnormally increased Dyrk1A immunoreactivity is found in AD and DS (38Ferrer I. Barrachina M. Puig B. Martinez de Lagran M. Marti E. Avila J. Dierssen M. Neurobiol. Dis. 2005; 20: 392-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), suggesting a possible involvement of Dyrk1A with neurofibrillary tangle pathology. Through the aggregation assay in vitro, we observed the generation of previously unrecognized positive regulation of α-synuclein aggregation through protein phosphorylation. The aggregation of α-synuclein in the unstimulated quiescent condition can be positively regulated by active Dyrk1A. In addition, electron microscopy shows the aggregates prepared from phosphorylated α-synuclein protein have a globular protofibrillar structure quite distinct from the fibril forming from intact α-synuclein. Caughey and Lansbury (39Caughey B. Lansbury P.T. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 26: 267-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1423) Google Scholar) and Lansbury et al. (40Conway K.A. Rochet J.C. Bieganski R.M. Lansbury P.T. Science. 2001; 294: 1346-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar) demonstrated that in vitro fibril formation by α-synuclein from its soluble monomeric form does not follow a simple one-step transition but is a rather complex process involving one or more discrete intermediates, termed protofibrils. During the process, a protofibril intermediate rather than the fibril itself may be more pathogenic. Additionally, studies have characterized several α-synuclein oligomers, which are much smaller than fibrils and appear early in the fibrillization process as granular forms (39Caughey B. Lansbury P.T. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 26: 267-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1423) Google Scholar, 40Conway K.A. Rochet J.C. Bieganski R.M. Lansbury P.T. Science. 2001; 294: 1346-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar). Consistent with this view, the morphological difference between the two protein aggregations is reflected by their distinct aggregation patterns, kinetics, and neurotoxicity. Further studies to characterize the molecular mechanisms leading to intracellular α-synuclein aggregate formation as well as the important signal transduction pathway(s) will give us insight into the mechanism of LB formation and the pathogenesis of PD and DS.

In earlier reconstitution experiments with bovine rhodopsin it was established that the equilibrium concentration of Meta-II rhodopsin increased with the concentration of DHA hydrocarbon chains in the lipid matrix (5Wiedmann T.S.

It was observed that phosphatidylethanolamines (PE) and the negatively charged phosphatidylserines (PS) increased the amount of Meta-II.

In contrast, the sensitivity of membranes to PE content correlated with an alteration of membrane curvature elasticity (10Botelho A.V. Gibson N.J. Thurmond R.L. Wang Y. Brown M.F.

Furthermore, they observed a preference of rhodopsin to locate in domains rich in di-22:6n3-PC that formed in di-16:0-PC/di-22:6-PC/cholesterol mixtures. Mouritsen proposed a link between hydrophobic thickness of lipid bilayers and activity of membrane proteins (18Mouritsen O.G. Bloom M. Biophys.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6354-6368Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) suggested that Meta-II has a greater hydrophobic thickness than Meta-I, and that the lipid bilayer has to thicken to match the hydrophobic length of Meta-II. They combined hydrophobic mismatch and curvature elasticity into a flexible surface model that links membrane elastic properties to rhodopsin function in a very general way (10Botelho A.V. Gibson N.J. Thurmond R.L. Wang Y. Brown M.F. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6354-6368Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In this project we explored whether the rhodopsin surface should be viewed as homogeneous and the surrounding membrane as a continuum, or if specific interactions with lipids could play a role in rhodopsin activation. Lipids could associate with particular sites on the protein and alter function, in analogy to lipid-like substances that act as ligands. Such specific interactions are likely to depend on the chemical composition of lipid hydrocarbon chains, in particular polyunsaturation, and on lipid headgroups.

Biol. 2004; 343: 1409-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar) show a few structurally well defined lipids that interact with rhodopsin helices. Molecular dynamic simulations reported existence of specific sites on the surface of rhodopsin for specific interaction with polyunsaturated chains, saturated chains, and cholesterol (25Grossfield A. Feller S.E. Pitman M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 4888-4893Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). While those observations are very important, they should be verified by results from a method that explores such interactions in fluid bilayers at physiologically relevant conditions. Recently, we demonstrated the feasibility of investigating lipid-rhodopsin interaction by saturation transfer NMR (ST-NMR) in combination with magic angle spinning (MAS) (26Soubias O. Gawrisch K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 13110-13111Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). A preliminary account of saturation transfer by selective excitation between the protons of rhodopsin and lipids, without application of MAS, was presented earlier by Deese et al. (27Deese A.J. Dratz E.A. Hymel L. Fleischer S. Biophys. J. 1982; 37: 207-216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In ST-NMR, membrane protein resonances are selectively saturated via radiofrequency (rf) pulses. Magnetization is then transferred from the protein to a first layer of lipids surrounding the protein via 1H-1H dipolar contacts allowing identification of the lipid species that are interacting with the protein. In this study, lipid-rhodopsin interactions were investigated by ST-MAS-NMR. We report the results obtained on natural ROS disks and on reconstituted model membranes. After photoactivation of rhodopsin in the spinning rotor, the photointermediates responsible for lipid resonance attenuation were identified through their temperature and pH dependence as well as their lifetimes. Headgroup selective transfer of magnetization was probed via a transfer of proton magnetization to lipid phosphorus nuclei. In addition, rhodopsin was reconstituted into binary mixtures of polyand monounsaturated lipids. The experiments revealed that lipids with polyunsaturated docosahexaenoyl and monounsaturated oleoyl chains interact specifically with different sites on the surface of rhodopsin. Intact disk membranes were isolated from rod outer segments (ROS) of bovine retinas as described elsewhere (28Litman B.J. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 81: 150-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Samples were kept at 4 °C, and all manipulations were performed in the dark or under dim red light. Before conducting the NMR experiments, the native ROS disks were exchanged into the appropriate D20 buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 60 mm KCl, 30 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 50 μm DTPA, 1.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1.5 mg/ml aprotinin, pD of 8.4 or 6.4) by several cycles of centrifugation followed by resuspension. The phospholipids 1-perdeutero-stearoyl-2-docosahexaenoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (18:0d35-22:6n3-PC), 1-perdeutero-stearoyl-2-docosahexaenoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (18:0d35-22:6n3-PE), 1-perdeutero-stearoyl-2-docosahexaenoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoserine (18: 0d35-22:6n3-PS) and 1-perdeutero-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (16:0d31-18:1n9-PC) were synthesized by Avanti Polar Lipids Inc. (Alabaster, AL). Polyunsaturated lipids were stored at –80 °C in sealed, argon-filled ampoules as solution in methylene chloride or chloroform with the antioxidant butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) added at a lipid/BHT molar ratio of 200/1. Sample preparation was carried out in a nitrogen-filled glove box to prevent oxidation. Rhodopsin was purified from bovine retinas using procedures that were developed by Litman (28Litman B.J. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 81: 150-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Rhodopsin fractions in 3 wt. % octylglucoside (OG), which gave a 280/500 nm intensity ratio of 1.9 or better in the uv/vis absorption spectra, were used for reconstitution. To recombine rhodopsin with lipids, the phospholipids in organic solvent were dried in a stream of pure nitrogen gas in a glass round bottom flask. The OG-solubilized rhodopsin was added to the dry lipid to form mixed micelles with an OG/lipid molar ratio of about 10:1 and a phospholipid/rhodopsin molar ratio of 250:1. The micellar solution was then rapidly diluted by injection into PIPES buffer (10 mm PIPES, 100 mm NaCl, 50 μm DTPA, pD 7.4) prepared with D20, which resulted in the formation of proteoliposomes. Care was taken to ensure that the final OG concentration was not higher than 5 mm, which is well below the cmc of OG. The proteoliposome dispersion (typically 0.5 mg lipids/ml) was then extruded through a stack of two porous anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) filters, 13-mm diameter, with a nominal pore diameter of 0.2 μm (Whatman), resulting in entrapment of multilamellar bilayers inside the pores (29Gaede H.C. Luckett K.M. Polozov I.V. Gawrisch K. Langmuir. 2004; 20: 7711-7719Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). All but a single, cylindrical bilayer near the AAO pore surface, as well as residual OG in membranes, were removed by forceful flushing of filters with several milliliters of plain buffer at a rate of 0.2 ml/s (29Gaede H.C. Luckett K.M. Polozov I.V. Gawrisch K. Langmuir. 2004; 20: 7711-7719Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The top filter was discarded, and the second filter cut into small pieces with a blade. The wet pieces were transferred into an 11-μl spherical insert for MAS rotors made of Kel-F (Bruker Biospin Inc., Billerica MA). ST-NMR on ROS Disks—The NMR experiments on ROS disks were conducted on a Bruker DMX500 NMR spectrometer equipped with a wide bore 11.7 T magnet. The 1H spectra were acquired in a triple resonance 1H/13C/2H, 4 mm MAS probehead (Bruker Biospin, Inc.) at a MAS spinning frequency of 10 kHz with a 1H π /2 pulse length of 4 μs. Typically 4 scans with a recycle delay of 10 s were acquired. A Gaussian-shaped pulse of 50 ms length at an rf field strength of 0.12 kHz gave optimal conditions for selective saturation of protein resonances without saturating lipids. A total saturation length of 500 ms (ten 50-ms Gaussian pulses) was used if not stated otherwise. The resonance frequency of rf-presaturation corresponded to a chemical shift of 8.5 ppm in the proton spectrum. When needed, samples in the spinning MAS rotor were illuminated for 1 min with light from a miniature light bulb. Please note that the saturation field strength was much lower and the length of the presaturation pulse substantially longer compared with our previously reported experiments (26Soubias O. Gawrisch K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 13110-13111Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Conditions were changed to address a recent observation that magic angle spinning may result in modulation of the saturation frequency such that weak sidebands, different from multiples of the spinning frequency, may occur. Current experimental conditions completely avoid any saturation of lipid resonances that is not transmitted to the lipid matrix from rhodopsin. The 31P NMR spectra were acquired with a 1H/31P-MAS probehead at 10 kHz MAS with a 31P π /2 pulse length of 9.5 μs, and a sequence delay time of 5 s. A 1H-presaturation of 500 ms at a 1H B1 field strength of 0.12 kHz was applied before a 10-ms 1H-31P cross-polarization that was linearly ramped on the proton channel from 25 to 34 kHz (see Fig. 1). To compensate for the temperature increase from rapid sample spinning and/or from application of rf fields, the temperature of the bearing air was lowered with a chiller. The temperature inside the spinning rotor was calibrated by measurement of the temperature-dependent chemical shift of the water resonance as well as by following known phase transitions of lipids. ST-NMR on Reconstituted Membranes—The experiments were carried out on a Bruker AV800 NMR spectrometer, equipped with a 18.8 T standard bore magnet and a 1H/13C/2H MAS probe at a MAS frequency of 15 kHz and a 1H π /2 pulse length of 2.9 μs. The higher MAS frequency necessitated a slightly higher level of rf field strength (1 kHz) for presaturation. Other conditions were identical to the experiments conducted at 11.7 T. Typically 16 transients were acquired for each experiment. Sample temperature was adjusted via a stream of temperature controlled gas directed into the rf coil compartment of the MAS stator. Bearing and drive air had ambient temperature. The sample temperature was calibrated as described above. 1H ST-MAS NMR on ROS Disks—Rhodopsin interaction with saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbon chains of phospholipids was investigated in bovine ROS disks. According to published results, the disks are composed of phospholipids containing ∼50% polyunsaturated acyl chains (∼65% of them DHA) and ∼40% saturated chains (stearic and palmitic acid) (30Albert A.D. Young J.E. Paw Z. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1368: 52-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Rhodopsin constitutes 90–95% of all membrane proteins in ROS disks (31Papermas D.S. Dreyer W.J. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 2438-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). Fig. 2, A and B show the 1H NMR spectra of ROS disks recorded at a MAS spinning frequency of 10 kHz without (A) and with (B) selective rf saturation of rhodopsin, respectively. The resonance at 2.85 ppm stems from the protons of methylene groups located between the double bonds in polyunsaturated chains (mostly DHA), whereas the resonance at 1.3 ppm is dominated by methylene protons from stearic and palmitic acid with a small contribution from unsaturated fatty acids other than DHA and a minor contribution from methyl groups of rhodopsin. The integral intensity ratio of the 2.85 ppm to 1.3 ppm resonances agrees very well with the reported fatty acid content of ROS. The saturation time, saturation frequency, and saturation power for ST-NMR were optimized in experiments on ROS disks and on recombinant samples with and without rhodopsin. No attenuation of lipid resonances in protein-free membrane samples was observed at presaturation with a B1 field strength of 0.25 kHz or less, applied at a frequency corresponding to a chemical shift of 8.5 ppm or larger for up to 500 ms. But an attenuation of lipid resonances was observed for membranes containing rhodopsin, even at lower B1 field strength. Lipid resonance attenuation at a B1 field of 0.12 kHz increased linearly with increasing presaturation time, up to 500 ms (see Fig. 2C). A saturation time of 500 ms, a B1 field strength of 0.12 kHz at a frequency corresponding to a chemical shift of 8.5 ppm gave optimal conditions for selective saturation of rhodopsin without directly saturating lipid resonances. The rf saturation of rhodopsin in ROS resulted in an attenuation of the 2.85 ppm resonance (predominantly DHA) by a factor of 1.66 ± 0.02, whereas the resonance at 1.3 ppm (predominantly saturated chains) was attenuated by a factor of 1.54 ± 0.02 (Fig. 2). Attenuation is defined as intensity ratio of the resonance recorded without and with presaturation. We also established that both resonances had the same spin-lattice relaxation time of 0.95 ± 0.05 s indicating that differences in spin-lattice relaxation are not responsible for the preferential attenuation of the DHA resonance. 31P ST-MAS NMR on ROS—The bovine ROS disk membranes are composed of 40–50 mol % PC, 30–35 mol % PE, 20–30 mol % phosphatidylethanolamine plasmalogens, and 5–10 mol % PS (32Fliesler S.J. Anderson R.E. Prog. Lipid Res. 1983; 22: 79-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). The 31P MAS NMR spectrum recorded with a hard 31P π /2-pulse and a long delay time between scans of 5 s, to ensure proportionality of signal intensity to the molar ratio of phospholipid species, is shown in Fig. 3A. Magic angle spinning averages the powder pattern from the 31P NMR anisotropy of chemical shift to a rotational centerband and sidebands that are separated from the centerband by multiples of the MAS spinning frequency. In Fig. 3 only the MAS centerband is shown. At 10 kHz spinning frequency, sideband intensities can be safely ignored, and the intensities of PC, PE, and PS centerband resonances reflect composition of the ROS. Resonances were assigned by comparison with spectra of model membranes with known composition (see also Ref. 33Pinheiro T.J. Watts A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2459-2467Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The fit to the experimental spectrum (Fig. 3B) yielded a PE/PC/PS molar ratio of 4.2:4.8:1. Considering that ethanolamine plasmalogens and PE are likely to have the same 31P NMR chemical shift, this molar ratio is in good agreement with expectations. Rhodopsin interaction with specific lipid species was investigated by ST-MAS NMR with 1H-31P cross-polarization (CP). After presaturation of rhodopsin, CP transfer occurs via intramolecular dipolar couplings from the protons of lipid glycerol groups and headgroups to the lipid phosphorus nuclei as well as via intermolecular 1H-31P dipolar couplings between rhodopsin protons and lipid phosphorus. It was previously reported that the methylene protons of g3, and of the α-methylene group of headgroups are the primary contributors to intramolecular dipolar interaction with the 31P nucleus (34Arnold K. Gawrisch K. Volke F. Stud. Biophys. 1979; 75: 189-197Google Scholar, 35Balgavy P. Gawrisch K. Frischleder H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 772: 58-64Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). During the long saturation time of 500 ms, magnetization is partially exchanged by spin-diffusion within the intramolecular proton network of lipids (36Huster D. Arnold K. Gawrisch K. J. Phys. Chem. B. 1999; 103: 243-251Crossref Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Therefore, the attenuation of the phosphorus resonance is likely to reflect interactions of all lipid segments with sites on rhodopsin. Fig. 3C shows the 31P CP-MAS-NMR spectra obtained without (solid line) and with presaturation (dashed line) of rhodopsin protons. As can be seen, both PC and PE resonances are attenuated when rhodopsin protons are presaturated. This indicates that both phospholipids are interacting with rhodopsin. However, the 31P resonance of PE is more attenuated than the resonance of PC (attenuation factors are 1.30 ± 0.02 for PE versus 1.19 ± 0.02 for PC) indicating that magnetization transfer to PE occurs with higher efficiency. Signal intensity of the PS resonance was too low for a measurement of magnetization transfer. Photoillumination of ROS Disks—The effect of photoactivation on interaction of DHA and saturated chains with rhodopsin was assessed by recording the 1H ST-MAS-NMR spectra of ROS disks as a function of time after photoactivation. Rhodopsin was completely bleached 30 min after the start of recordings by illuminating the spinning sample for 1 min with the light of a miniature light bulb inside the MAS stator. Sample heating from the infrared irradiation of the miniature light bulb was negligible as seen by the constancy of chemical shift of the water signal. Spectra were recorded continuously at 1.5-min intervals before (A(t0)) and after photoillumination (A(t)), starting 2 min after exposing the sample to light. Fig. 4 reports the ratio of DHA attenuation A(t)/A(to) recorded over 14 h. Before photoactivation of rhodopsin, DHA attenuation was constant within small limits of experimental error. After bleaching, DHA attenuation A(t)/A(to) increased within minutes to a value of 1.12 and decayed slowly over several hours back to the value of dark-adapted, unbleached ROS disks. The DHA data could be fitted to Equation 1, A(t)A(to)=Amax⋅(1−exp(−t/τ1))⋅exp(t/τ2)(Eq. 1) where Amax is the amplitude of attenuation increase, τ1 the time constant of formation of the state with increased attenuation, and τ2 the time constant of its disappearance. At a pD of 8.4 and a temperature of 30 °C, attenuation increased at τ1 = 12 ± 5 min to a value of ∼12% above the attenuation of dark-adapted rhodopsin and decayed at τ2 = 350 ± 50 min to an attenuation similar to ROS disks before bleaching (Fig. 4A). The experiment was repeated twice on freshly prepared samples with similar results. Efficiency of rhodopsin bleaching in the rotor was confirmed by comparison with experiments on samples that were bleached for 1 min in the beam of a high-intensity green laser pointer before insertion into the MAS NMR probe. After temperature equilibration those samples gave identical results within the limits of experimental error. When the temperature was lowered to 20 °C, the time constant τ1 increased to 45 ± 5 min and τ2 increased to 450 ± 100 min (Fig. 4B). At pD 6.4 and a temperature of 30 °C, DHA attenuation did not change with bleaching (Fig. 4C). Signal attenuation of the resonance from mostly saturated chains at 1.3 ppm increased only by 2.5% after photoactivation, which is barely outside experimental error limits (data not shown). A control experiment on 18:0-22:6n3-PC membranes without rhodopsin, conducted at otherwise identical conditions did not yield any time dependence of DHA signal intensity, confirming that the increased attenuation of the DHA resonance results from photoactivation of rhodopsin and not from drifts of signal amplification or temperature. Upon adsorption of a photon, within a few milliseconds a temperature and pH-dependent equilibrium between Meta-I and Meta-II is established. Here, the increase of DHA attenuation after bleaching of rhodopsin had a rate of minutes. This indicates that dark-adapted rhodopsin, Meta-I and Meta-II rhodopsin intermediates experience similar interaction with DHA acyl chains. The changes must originate either from Meta-III or opsin. The latter was eliminated by following DHA attenuation over 24 h. The state of rhodopsin with highest magnetization transfer rate toward DHA decayed with a characteristic time of hours as it had been reported for the Meta-III-to-opsin conversion (37Ritter E. Zimmermann K. Heck M. Hofmann K.P. Bartl F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48102-48111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The opsin-induced attenuation of DHA was indistinguishable from DHA attenuation by dark-adapted rhodopsin. The conclusion that Meta-III is characterized by a higher magnetization transfer rate to DHA was solidified by repeating the entire time-dependent experiment at a lower temperature (Fig. 4B) and a lower pH (Fig. 4C). At the lower temperature the Meta-III forms at a lower rate, which was confirmed by the lower rate of increase of DHA attenuation. Formation of more Meta-III at the lower temperature is expected as well. At first glance that appears to contradict the somewhat lower magnitude of the attenuation increase at lower temperature. However, attenuation of the DHA resonance of rhodopsin in the dark adapted state is very temperature dependent as well (results not shown). Therefore absolute magnitudes of attenuation, recorded at different temperatures, do not necessarily reflect Meta-III concentration. Finally, at a pD of 6.4, equivalent to a pH of 6.0, no Meta-III should be formed because the Meta-I/Meta-II equilibrium is shifted toward Meta-II. The absence of Meta-III was confirmed by the lack of a change in DHA resonance attenuation after photoactivation. ST-NMR on Reconstituted Rhodopsin—To evaluate specificity of polyunsaturated (DHA) and monounsaturated (OA) lipid-rhodopsin interactions, experiments on reconstituted, rhodopsin-containing membranes composed of binary mixtures of 16:0d31-18:1n9-PC with 18:0d35-22:6n3-PC, or 18:0d35-22: 6n3-PE, or 18:0d35-22:6n3-PS were conducted. Perdeuteration of the saturated palmitic and stearic acid chains eliminated their proton signals. As a consequence, the resonance at 1.3 ppm is only from the monounsaturated oleic acid (OA, 18:1n9), while the resonance at 2.8 ppm is from DHA only. Deuteration also suppressed intermolecular magnetization transfer between lipids. Independent of the molar ratio of poly- to monounsaturated lipids in the lipid matrix, 50% of hydrocarbon chains were always deuterated. Therefore at a random distribution of protonated and deuterated hydrocarbon chains, only one-fourth of all chain-chain interactions involved a pair of protonated chains, lowering the rates of lateral magnetization transfer within the lipid matrix by a factor of four. But even without deuteration, rates of lateral transfer of magnetization by cross-relaxation in the liquid crystalline state of 16:0-18: 1-PC at ambient temperature (38Yau W.M. Gawrisch K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 3971-3972Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar) are several orders of"
https://openalex.org/W2020754261,"Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is a homotrimeric, ring-shaped protein complex that functions as a processivity factor for DNA polymerases. Following genotoxic stress, PCNA is modified at a conserved site by either a single ubiquitin moiety or a polyubiquitin chain. These modifications are required to coordinate DNA damage tolerance processes with ongoing replication. The molecular mechanisms responsible for inducing PCNA ubiquitination are not well understood. Using Xenopus egg extracts, we show that ultraviolet radiation and aphidicolin treatment induce the mono- and diubiquitination of PCNA. PCNA ubiquitination is replication-dependent and coincides with activation of the ataxia telangiectasia mutated and Rad3-related (ATR)-dependent DNA damage checkpoint pathway. However, loss of ATR signaling by depletion of the ATR-interacting protein (ATRIP) or Rad1, a component of the 911 checkpoint clamp, does not impair PCNA ubiquitination. Primed single-stranded DNA generated by uncoupling of mini-chromosome maintenance helicase and DNA polymerase activities has been shown previously to be necessary for ATR activation. Here we show that PCNA ubiquitination also requires uncoupling of helicase and polymerase activities. We further demonstrate that replicating single-stranded DNA, which mimics the structure produced upon uncoupling, is sufficient to induce PCNA monoubiquitination.

Bulky lesions in the DNA cause arrest of replicative polymerases, halting cell cycle progression and activating DNA damage checkpoints. DNA damage tolerance mechanisms allow the cell to continue replication under these conditions and permit repair of the damage at a later time (1Friedberg E.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 943-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar).

A second mechanism of DNA damage tolerance involves error-free strategies of bypass that include post-replication recombinational repair and replication fork regression. How these DNA damage tolerance mechanisms are coordinated with replication at stalled forks is largely unknown. One protein that plays a critical role in linking these processes is proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). PCNA is a homotrimeric ring-shaped protein complex that functions as a processivity factor necessary to maintain ongoing synthesis of DNA. PCNA has critical functions in DNA replication and DNA damage tolerance, and these functions depend on its interaction with other proteins. In addition, post-translational modification of PCNA has emerged as a critical step in regulating PCNA functions (1Friedberg E.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 943-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 2Maga G. Hubscher U. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 3051-3060Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). In response to DNA damage or replication fork stalling, PCNA is modified at a conserved site, Lys-164, by either a single ubiquitin moiety or a polyubiquitin chain, linked via Lys-63 (3Stelter P.

These ubiquitination events promote DNA damage tolerance processes in either an error-prone or error-free manner. Monoubiquitination of PCNA activates TLS by facilitating the recruitment of error-prone TLS polymerases such as polymerase η to PCNA at the replication fork (5Kannouche P.L. Wing J. Lehmann A.R. Mol.

In contrast, polyubiquitination of PCNA is thought to promote the error-free mechanisms of DNA damage tolerance (4Hoege C. Pfander B. Moldovan G.L. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S.

These DNA-damaging agents are also known activators of the ataxia-telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR)-dependent checkpoint pathway (11Shiloh Y. Nat. Rev.

In response to these agents, the ATR kinase, in complex with its cofactor ATR-interacting protein (ATRIP), phosphorylates and activates the effector kinase Chk1. Phosphorylation of numerous substrates by ATR and Chk1 leads to arrest of cell cycle progression and activation of pathways that stabilize stalled replication forks (12Branzei D. Foiani M. Curr.

Walter J.C. Cimprich K.A. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1040-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Upon encounter of a bulky lesion or direct inhibition by aphidicolin, the polymerase is stalled, whereas the helicase continues to unwind DNA (16Byun T.S. Pacek M. Yee M.C. Walter J.C. Cimprich K.A.

Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1007-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The similarity in signals leading to PCNA ubiquitination and ATR activation as well as the role of ATR in maintaining replication fork stability raise the possibility that the ATR pathway might regulate the ubiquitination of PCNA. Here we used the Xenopus egg extract system to study PCNA ubiquitination. Addition of sperm chromatin to low speed supernatants (LSS) of Xenopus egg cytoplasm results in the assembly of pre-replication (pre-RC) complexes and nuclear envelope formation. Initiation of DNA replication then occurs, and DNA is replicated in a semi-conservative fashion (20Arias E.E. Walter J.C. Front. Biosci. 2004; 9: 3029-3045Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Using this cell-free system, we find that UV and aphidicolin treatment induce PCNA mono- and polyubiquitination in Xenopus egg extracts, an event consistent with studies in yeast and mammalian cells. PCNA ubiquitination coincides with activation of the ATR-mediated checkpoint response; however, loss of ATR activity does not impair PCNA monoubiquitination. Instead, we show that PCNA ubiquitination and ATR activation are two parallel events that occur in response to a common ssDNA intermediate generated by functional uncoupling of MCM helicase and DNA polymerase activities.

Immunodepletions of ATRIP and Rad1 were performed as three consecutive 30-min incubations at 4 °C using Affiprep protein-A beads (Bio-Rad) as described (16Byun T.S. Pacek M. Yee M.C. Walter J.C. Cimprich K.A. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1040-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Nuclei and chromatin were isolated from LSS (14Lupardus P.J. Byun T. Yee M.C. Hekmat-Nejad M. Cimprich K.A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2327-2332Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and HSS/NPE (17Pacek M. Walter J.C.

GST Pulldown from LSS—Nuclei were resuspended in 100 μl of PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100. The nuclear lysate was incubated with 10–15 μl of pre-equilibrated GST-agarose and rotated at 4 °C for 30 min.

Following the 75-min replication of treated chromatin in NPE, chromatin was re-isolated by pipeting the sucrose cushion below the reaction. Monoubiquitination of PCNA Is Induced by Genotoxic Stress in a Replication-dependent Manner—Treatment of chromatin with UV or aphidicolin induces activation of the ATR-dependent checkpoint in Xenopus egg extracts, as monitored by phosphorylation of Chk1 at Ser-344 (Fig. 1, A, C, and F) (22Liu Q. Guntuku S. Cui X.S. Matsuoka S. Cortez D. Tamai K. Luo G. Carattini-Rivera S. DeMayo F. Bradley A. Donehower L.A. Elledge S.J.

To determine the effect of these agents on PCNA, we analyzed the chromatin-bound form of PCNA after UV and aphidicolin treatment. Both agents led to the accumulation of a form of PCNA ∼8 kDa larger than PCNA itself (Fig. 1A), an increase consistent with the attachment of a single ubiquitin moiety. To verify that PCNA is monoubiquitinated following genotoxic stress, we added purified GST-ubiquitin to LSS prior to addition of UV-damaged chromatin or aphidicolin and isolated glutathione-bound proteins. Following either treatment, we obtained a protein with a molecular mass corresponding to mono-GST-ubiquitinated PCNA that was recognized by PCNA and GST antibodies (Fig. 1B). We observed similar results using His6-tagged ubiquitin (supplemental Fig. 1A). These observations confirm that PCNA is monoubiquitinated in Xenopus egg extracts following several types of genotoxic stress. Mutation of a conserved lysine (Lys-164) to arginine has been shown to abrogate PCNA ubiquitination in both yeast (3Stelter P. Ulrich H.

Cell. 2004; 14: 491-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). To determine whether the DNA damage-induced monoubiquitination of PCNA also occurs at Lys-164 in Xenopus egg extracts, we added either wild-type His6-tagged Xenopus PCNA (HisxPCNA) or the K164R mutant of HisxPCNA to LSS and then used nickel resin to isolate these proteins from nuclei following UV or aphidicolin treatment. As expected, wild-type HisxPCNA was monoubiquitinated in the presence of aphidicolin or UV-treated chromatin, but the Lys-164 mutant was not (Fig. 1C). To better characterize this post-translational modification, we analyzed PCNA monoubiquitination at varying times in the presence and absence of UV damage. Monoubiquitination was first observed 15–30 min after addition of UV-damaged chromatin to LSS and was coincident with the onset of DNA replication (Fig. 1D). In the absence of DNA damage, only minor amounts of monoubiquitination were noted over the course of the entire experiment. We also analyzed PCNA monoubiquitination over a range of aphidicolin concentrations that affect the extent of replication inhibition (16Byun T.S. Pacek M. Yee M.C. Walter J.C. Cimprich K.A. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1040-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar) and the accumulation of RPA-coated single-stranded DNA (Fig. 1E). We found PCNA to be monoubiquitinated at all concentrations tested. In addition, we observed another form of PCNA with a molecular mass consistent with diubiquitination at higher concentrations of aphidicolin. To confirm that this additional form of PCNA is diubiquitinated PCNA, we isolated PCNA from extracts using p21 peptide resin (25Mattock H. Jares P. Zheleva D. Lane D. Warbrick E. Blow J. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 265: 242-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and probed for ubiquitin at two concentrations of aphidicolin. Both higher mobility forms of PCNA were recognized by an anti-ubiquitin antibody, and longer ubiquitin chains were also detected (supplemental Fig. 1B). Taken together, our data indicate that although a small amount of PCNA monoubiquitination may occur during unperturbed replication, both mono- and diubiquitination are strongly induced by DNA damage. These findings are consistent with observations in yeast (3Stelter P. Ulrich H. Nature. 2003; 425: 188-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar, 4Hoege C. Pfander B. Moldovan G.L.

PCNA Monoubiquitination Occurs Independently of the ATR-mediated Checkpoint Pathway—The similarity in signals leading to PCNA ubiquitination and ATR activation (Fig. 1A, D), as well as the roles of the ATR pathway in maintaining replication fork stability and DNA damage-induced mutagenesis (12Branzei D. Foiani M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 568-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 26Kai M. Wang T.S. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 64-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 27Hirano Y.

Res. 2003; 532: 59-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), raised the possibility that ATR activation and PCNA ubiquitination might be linked. Thus, we tested whether UV and aphidicolin-induced PCNA monoubiquitination, like ATR activation with these agents (14Lupardus P.J. Byun T. Yee M.C. Hekmat-Nejad M. Cimprich K.A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2327-2332Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 15Stokes M.P. Van Hatten R. Lindsay H.D. Michael W.M. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 863-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), is an S-phase specific event. Addition of geminin, which inhibits replication by preventing assembly of the pre-RC (20Arias E.E. Walter J.C. Front. Biosci. 2004; 9: 3029-3045Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), abrogated aphidicolin and UV-induced PCNA monoubiquitination and, as a control, Chk1 phosphorylation (Fig. 1F). This observation indicates that PCNA monoubiquitination in response to UV and aphidicolin is a replication-dependent process in Xenopus egg extracts. We then assessed the effect of blocking the ATR-mediated checkpoint on PCNA monoubiquitination. First, we used caffeine, an inhibitor of both the ATM- and ATR-mediated checkpoint responses (30Sarkaria J.N. Busby E.C. Tibbetts R.S. Roos P. Taya Y. Karnitz L.M. Abraham R.T. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4375-4382PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A, caffeine abrogated aphidicolin-induced Chk1 phosphorylation (total lysate, compare lanes 3 and 4), whereas monoubiquitination of PCNA increased (chromatin fraction, compare lanes 3 and 4). These data suggest that PCNA monoubiquitination is not dependent on ATM or ATR kinase activity. To test more directly the dependence of PCNA monoubiquitination on ATR, we immunodepleted ATRIP, an ATR-binding protein required for ATR signaling, from LSS. Consistent with previous reports (16Byun T.S. Pacek M. Yee M.C. Walter J.C. Cimprich K.A. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1040-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 31Kumagai A. Kim S.M. Dunphy W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49599-49608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), depletion of ATRIP prevented ATR-dependent Chk1 phosphorylation following UV or aphidicolin treatment (Fig. 2B, total lysate). However, as seen with caffeine, PCNA monoubiquitination was not blocked and modestly increased upon depletion of ATRIP (Fig. 2B, chromatin fraction). The Rad9-Hus1-Rad1 (911) checkpoint clamp is another essential component of the ATR-mediated checkpoint pathway that has been suggested to have a role in translesion synthesis (26Kai M. Wang T.S. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 64-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 28Sabbioneda S. Minesinger B.K. Giannattasio M. Plevani P. Muzi-Falconi M. Jinks-Robertson S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 38657-38665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 32Parrilla-Castellar E.R. Arlander S.J. Karnitz L. DNA Repair. 2004; 3: 1009-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 33Paulovich A.G. Armour C.D. Hartwell L.H. Genetics. 1998; 150: 75-93Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because monoubiquitinated PCNA is also involved in translesion synthesis, we asked whether the 911 complex is necessary for PCNA monoubiquitination. Immunodepletion of Rad1 abrogated ATR-dependent Chk1 phosphorylation, as reported previously (34Lupardus P.J. Cimprich K.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 1559-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2C, total lysate, compare lanes 3 and 4). However, aphidicolin-inducible PCNA monoubiquitination was not inhibited by depletion of the 911 checkpoint clamp (Fig. 2C, chromatin fraction, compare lanes 3 and 4), indicating that PCNA monoubiquitination does not require 911 function. The increase in PCNA monoubiquitination observed upon treatment with caffeine or depletion of ATRIP or Rad1 is likely because of the inability to prevent late origin firing in the absence of the ATR-dependent checkpoint and the loading or persistence of PCNA at replication forks (35Machida Y.J. Hamlin J.L. Dutta A. Cell. 2005; 123: 13-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results indicate that monoubiquitination of PCNA induced by UV or aphidicolin can occur in the absence of ATR-ATRIP and 911 function. Moreover, the persistence of PCNA monoubiquitination in the absence of Chk1 phosphorylation suggests that PCNA monoubiquitination is independent of Chk1 phosphorylation. Monoubiquitination of PCNA Requires Cdc45-mediated Uncoupling of DNA Polymerase and MCM Helicase Activities—Rad18, the ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase required for PCNA monoubiquitination, binds ssDNA in vitro (1Friedberg E.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 943-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 9Lehmann A.R. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 873-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 36Bailly V. Lauder S. Prakash S. Prakash L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23360-23365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) and co-localizes with PCNA and polymerase η, an error-prone DNA polymerase involved in translesion synthesis, following UV damage in mammalian cells (8Watanabe K. Tateishi S. Kawasuji M. Tsurimoto T. Inoue H. Yamaizumi M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3886-3896Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that PCNA ubiquitination is induced by the same signal that activates the ATR pathway-primed ssDNA generated at stalled forks through functional dissociation of the MCM2–7 helicase and DNA polymerase activities (16Byun T.S. Pacek M. Yee M.C. Walter J.C. Cimprich K.A. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1040-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 17Pacek M. Walter J.C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3667-3676Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). To test this possibility, we inhibited uncoupling of helicase and polymerase activities by neutralization of Cdc45, an essential MCM helicase cofactor, using a protocol published previously (17Pacek M. Walter J.C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3667-3676Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). For this experiment, chromatin was incubated first in HSS of Xenopus egg extracts to allow for pre-RC formation. After 30 min, NPE was added to initiate replication and elongation by providing high levels of cdk2 and cdc7 kinase activities (20Arias E.E. Walter J.C. Front. Biosci. 2004; 9: 3029-3045Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The sequential addition of HSS and NPE to chromatin allows for analysis of replication in the absence of nuclear formation (21Walter J. Sun L. Newport J. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 519-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Following initiation of replication, GST-p27KIP was added to prevent any subsequent origin firing. Chromatin was isolated before elongation was completed and then mock-treated or incubated with neutralizing antibodies raised against Cdc45. To allow resumption of replication, the treated chromatin was then released into fresh NPE in the presence or absence of aphidicolin, and 75 min later, chromatin was reisolated and PCNA ubiquitination was assessed. As shown in Fig. 3, addition of 30 μm aphidicolin led to a significant increase in PCNA monoubiquitination and the appearance of a small amount of diubiquitinated PCNA (PCNA-Ub2), as compared with mock treatment (lanes 1 and 2). Neutralization of Cdc45 activity by addition of purified Cdc45 antibodies largely abolished PCNA ubiquitination in the presence of aphidicolin (Fig. 3, lane 3). As a control, preincubation of Cdc45-neutralizing antibodies with recombinant HisCdc45 restored aphidicolin-inducible ubiquitination of PCNA (Fig. 3, lane 4), confirming that the observed loss of PCNA ubiquitination is because of neutralization of Cdc45. Consistent with previous results (16Byun T.S. Pacek M. Yee M.C. Walter J.C. Cimprich K.A. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1040-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar), aphidicolin-inducible Chk1 phosphorylation was also blocked by addition of Cdc45-neutralizing antibodies. These results indicate that Cdc45-mediated uncoupling of helicase and polymerase activities is necessary for ubiquitination of PCNA. Replicating Single-stranded DNA Induces Monoubiquitination of PCNA—Upon addition to high speed supernatants (HSS) of Xenopus egg extracts, single-stranded M13 (ssM13) DNA is primed and replicated in a PCNA- and polymerase α-dependent manner (25Mattock H. Jares P. Zheleva D. Lane D. Warbrick E. Blow J. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 265: 242-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 37Mechali M. Harland R.M. Cell. 1982; 30: 93-101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Thus, replication of the ssM13 DNA generates an intermediate that mimics the ssDNA formed ahead of a stalled polymerase during helicase-polymerase uncoupling. To further test the idea that primed ssDNA is the signal that activates PCNA ubiquitination, we asked if this replicating ssDNA was sufficient to induce PCNA ubiquitination in Xenopus egg extracts. As shown in Fig. 4A, addition of ssM13 DNA to HSS containing GST-tagged ubiquitin triggered the formation of mono-GST-ubiquitinated PCNA (Fig. 4A, lane 2). To test the requirement for replication of the ssDNA in PCNA ubiquitination, we also added a dose of aphidicolin sufficient to block all detectable DNA replication (Fig. 4B) (16Byun T.S. Pacek M. Yee M.C. Walter J.C. Cimprich K.A. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1040-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Treatment with aphidicolin led to a substantial decrease in mono-GST-ubiquitinated PCNA (Fig. 4A, compare lanes 2 and 3). These results indicate that replicating ssDNA is sufficient to induce PCNA ubiquitination. Our findings indicate that mono- and diubiquitination of PCNA at lysine 164 are strongly induced by UV or aphidicolin treatment in Xenopus egg extracts. We also show that Cdc45-dependent uncoupling of helicase and polymerase activities is needed for aphidicolin-induced ubiquitination of PCNA, but the ATR-ATRIP and 911 complexes are not. Moreover, replicating ssDNA, which mimics the DNA intermediate formed upon Cdc45-dependent uncoupling, can induce this post-translational modification. These data support a model in which PCNA ubiquitination is initiated by ssDNA that accumulates at stalled replication forks. Recently it was shown that primed ssDNA can induce PCNA ubiquitination in vitro using purified proteins. Although elegant studies, the role of ssDNA in these experiments is difficult to discern because ubiquitination only occurred when PCNA was loaded onto the DNA (38Garg P. Burgers P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 18361-18366Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 39Haracska L. Unk I. Prakash L. Prakash S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 6477-6482Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). It is likely that the requirement for replication of ssDNA in our experiments also reflects the need for PCNA to load onto DNA. Helicase-polymerase uncoupling leads to the accumulation of RPA-coated ssDNA and occurs following treatment with agents that inhibit DNA polymerases (16Byun T.S. Pacek M. Yee M.C. Walter J.C. Cimprich K.A. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1040-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 17Pacek M. Walter J.C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3667-3676Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 18Walter J. Newport J. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 617-627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Thus, our finding that Cdc45-mediated helicase-polymerase uncoupling is required for PCNA ubiquitination provides the first direct evidence that the additional accumulation of ssDNA is necessary for this event. The ability of replicating ssDNA to induce PCNA ubiquitination in cell-free egg extracts is also consistent with this idea and further demonstrates that neither a lesion nor the stalled fork itself is required for this response. We recently reported that activation of ATR following UV and aphidicolin also requires uncoupling of MCM helicase and polymerase activities (16Byun T.S. Pacek M. Yee M.C. Walter J.C. Cimprich K.A. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1040-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar), and we have found that replicating ssDNA can induce ATR activation. 3C. MacDougall, T. Byun, and K. A. Cimprich, unpublished data. In addition, PCNA ubiquitination and ATR-dependent Chk1 phosphorylation occur in response to similar types of stress with similar kinetics (Fig. 1A and D). Together, these observations suggest that PCNA ubiquitination and ATR-mediated checkpoint activation are induced by a common signal. Importantly, however, these events appear to be independent of each other. Loss of the checkpoint mediators ATRIP or Rad1 does not prevent PCNA ubiquitination (Fig. 2, B–C) nor does loss of PCNA prevent ATR-dependent phosphorylation of Chk1 (24Frampton J. Irmisch A. Green C.M. Neiss A. Trickey M. Ulrich H.D. Furuya K. Watts F.Z. Carr A.M. Lehmann A.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 2976-2985Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Although PCNA ubiquitination is not dependent on the homolog of ATR, Rad3, in Schizosaccharomyces pombe (24Frampton J. Irmisch A. Green C.M. Neiss A. Trickey M. Ulrich H.D. Furuya K. Watts F.Z. Carr A.M. Lehmann A.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 2976-2985Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), results in mammalian cells suggest a partial dependence on ATR, Chk1, and RPA (40Bi X. Barkley L.R. Slater D.M. Tateishi S. Yamaizumi M. Ohmori H. Vaziri C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 3527-3540Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). These findings could reflect a difference between yeast, Xenopus, and mammalian cells, although it is also conceivable that in mammalian cells the loss of ATR, which leads to genomic instability and cell death (41Brown E.J. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 615-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 42Brown E.J. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 397-402PubMed Google Scholar, 43Cortez D. Guntuku S. Qin J. Elledge S.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1713-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar), perturbs the cell cycle and DNA replication over the course of this experiment. This could cause an indirect effect on the ubiquitination of PCNA, a replication-dependent event. It is also important to note that our results do not preclude a role for ATR or the 911 complex in regulation of TLS or in error-free repair, as has been suggested previously (26Kai M. Wang T.S. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 64-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 27Hirano Y. Sugimoto K. Curr.

Although these proteins do not appear to be required for PCNA ubiquitination, they may be needed for other aspects of DNA damage tolerance or DNA repair. We hypothesize that primed ssDNA generated upon Cdc45-mediated uncoupling of helicase and polymerase activities acts as a critical signaling intermediate for multiple aspects of the DNA damage response, including those leading to checkpoint activation and DNA damage tolerance. It appears likely that this structure mediates the assembly of protein complexes involved in these processes, with ssDNA recruiting ATR-ATRIP (44Zou L. Elledge S.J. Science. 2003; 300: 1542-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (2059) Google Scholar, 45Costanzo V. Shechter D. Lupardus P.J. Cimprich K.A. Gottesman M. Gautier J. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 203-213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) and possibly the Rad6-Rad18 and Rad5-Mms2-Ubc13 complexes, the latter two of which mediate mono- and diubiquitination of PCNA (1Friedberg E.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 943-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 9Lehmann A.R. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 873-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Primers then serve to recruit the 911 complex (16Byun T.S. Pacek M. Yee M.C. Walter J.C. Cimprich K.A. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1040-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 46You Z. Kong L. Newport J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27088-27093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) to initiate activation of the checkpoint, and the bound PCNA is ubiquitinated to facilitate bypass of lesions at the stalled fork (Fig. 5). Recent studies have shown that the enzyme that deubiquitinates PCNA is regulated following DNA damage by autocleavage (47Huang T.T. Nijman S.M. Mirchandani K.D. Galardy P.J. Cohn M.A. Haas W. Gygi S.P. Ploegh H.L. Bernards R. D'Andrea A.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 339-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this regulation is also independent of the ATR pathway. Thus, it is possible that ssDNA at the replication fork regulates ubiquitination and/or deubiquitination of PCNA. Although our results are consistent with findings in yeast and mammalian cells showing that DNA damage induces mono- and polyubiquitination of PCNA, a recent paper reported that sumoylation and monoubiquitination of PCNA occur during the replication of undamaged DNA in Xenopus egg extracts (7Leach C.A. Michael W.M. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 947-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). These authors also report that monoubiquitination is unaffected by DNA damage, which under their conditions induces diubiquitination. We have also observed this result, but only when high concentrations of sperm chromatin were added to extracts (e.g. 25,000 sperm chromatin/μl) (supplemental Fig. 2). These concentrations of sperm chromatin lead to poor formation of nuclei in egg extracts, and replication is also inefficient under these conditions, because of limiting amounts of proteins required for these processes (48Blow J.J. Laskey R.A. Cell. 1986; 47: 577-587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 49Newport J. Cell. 1987; 48: 205-217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 50Sheehan M.A. Mills A.D. Sleeman A.M. Laskey R.A. Blow J.J. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Similar concentrations of sperm chromatin (2,000–2,500/μl) were used in both studies; thus the reasons for the discrepancy in our results are still not clear. Based on the effect of adding high concentrations of sperm chromatin, one possibility is that differences in the quality of nuclei formation are responsible. However, it is also possible that different basal levels of DNA damage are incurred in the sperm chromatin during some experimental manipulation or that some other difference in the techniques used is responsible. Finally, it is attractive to speculate that the amount of ssDNA generated at stalled replication forks could regulate the biological outcome of the DNA damage response. On this point, we note that the type of PCNA ubiquitination that occurs changes with the dose of aphidicolin and is correlated with the accumulation of RPA on chromatin (Fig. 1E). Monoubiquitination is induced at lower doses of aphidicolin where diubiquitination is undetectable, and at higher doses, diubiquitination is more prominent. We have shown previously that the aphidicolin dose modulates the extent and duration of DNA unwinding (16Byun T.S. Pacek M. Yee M.C. Walter J.C. Cimprich K.A. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1040-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Thus, these observations suggest that the persistence of replication fork stalling and ssDNA accumulation could affect the mechanism by which DNA damage is tolerated, with error-free pathways favored over the potentially error-prone TLS when damage is greater or more persistent.

We suggest that ratchet-mediated engulfment minimizes the utilization of chemical energy during this dramatic cellular reorganization, which occurs during starvation. In contrast to the eukaryotic cytoplasmic membrane, which is routinely internalized during receptor-mediated endocytosis and phagocytosis, the internalization of bacterial cytoplasmic membranes is limited to a handful of lineages that synthesize membrane-bound organelles, such as magnetosomes (Komeili et al., 2006Komeili A. Li Z. Newman D.K. Jensen G.J. Magnetosomes are cell membrane invaginations organized by the actin-like protein MamK.Science. 2006; 311: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, Scheffel et al., 2006Scheffel A.

An acidic protein aligns magnetosomes along a filamentous structure in magnetotactic bacteria.Nature. 2006; 440: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). One dramatic example of endocytosis in bacteria occurs during the starvation-induced sporulation pathway of Bacillus subtilis and its relatives. In these endospore-forming bacteria, sporulation commences with an asymmetrically positioned cell division event that generates two adjacent daughter cells of unequal size: the smaller forespore, which will become the spore, and the larger mother cell, which ultimately lyses to release the spore into the environment (Figure 1A, and reviewed by Errington, 2003Errington J.

Compartmentalization of gene expression during Bacillus subtilis spore formation.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 68: 234-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). The future spore is then internalized by a phagocytosis-like process known as engulfment, during which the mother cell membrane migrates around the forespore, until the leading edges of the engulfing membrane meet and fuse to release the forespore into the mother cell cytoplasm. Following engulfment, the forespore is bounded by two membranes, its own cytoplasmic membrane and an external membrane derived from the engulfing mother cell membrane, while the mother cell (unlike most bacterial cells) now has two separate membrane systems: the mother cell cytoplasmic membrane, which faces the environment, and the outer forespore membrane, which encloses the forespore. Engulfment is critical for sporulation, as it mediates the cellular rearrangements necessary to allow spore assembly to proceed in the mother cell cytoplasm, providing a more controlled environment than the external milieu and perhaps contributing to the extreme durability of the resulting spores. Engulfment also serves as a morphological checkpoint for activation of the late forespore- and mother cell-specific transcription factors σG and σK, respectively (reviewed by Errington, 2003Errington J. Regulation of endospore formation in Bacillus subtilis.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2003; 1: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, Hilbert and Piggot, 2004Hilbert D.W. Piggot P.J.

The forespore-expressed SpoIIQ protein plays a central role in this checkpoint, as it mediates localization of proteins required for activation of late transcription in both cells. The extracellular domain of SpoIIQ directly interacts with that of SpoIIIAH (Figure 1C), a mother cell protein required for σG activity (Blaylock et al., 2004Blaylock B. Jiang X. Rubio A.

SpoIIIAH recruits, perhaps indirectly, two mother cell proteins required for σK activity, SpoIVFA and SpoIVFB (Doan et al., 2005Doan T. Marquis K.A. Rudner D.Z.

Engulfment-regulated proteolysis of SpoIIQ: evidence that dual checkpoints control σK activity.Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 58: 102-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This is likely the main essential role of SpoIIQ, which is dispensable for engulfment under some conditions but essential for late transcription under all conditions (Jiang et al., 2005Jiang X.

A dispensable role for forespore-specific gene expression in engulfment of the forespore during sporulation of Bacillus subtilis.J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2919-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). SpoIIQ shows dynamic localization during engulfment, assembling a focus at the septal midpoint, tracking the engulfing mother cell membrane around the forespore, and assembling foci that appear as helical arcs in three dimensions (Rubio and Pogliano, 2004Rubio A. Pogliano K. Septal localization of forespore membrane proteins during engulfment in Bacillus subtilis.EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1636-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This localization pattern is similar to that of two mother cell proteins SpoIIQ recruits to the septum, SpoIIIAH and SpoIVFB (Blaylock et al., 2004Blaylock B. Jiang X. Rubio A. Moran Jr., C.P. Pogliano K. Zipper-like interaction between proteins in adjacent daughter cells mediates protein localization.Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2916-2928Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, Jiang et al., 2005Jiang X.

Microbiol. 2005; 58: 102-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), suggesting that the foci might serve as sites for intracellular signal transduction during the activation of late transcription. Engulfment shares a superficial similarity to eukaryotic phagocytosis in that the engulfed cell plays a relatively passive role in its fate, since mother cell-specific, but not forespore-specific, gene expression is essential for engulfment (Sun et al., 2000Sun Y.L. Sharp M.D. Pogliano K. A dispensable role for forespore-specific gene expression in engulfment of the forespore during sporulation of Bacillus subtilis.J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2919-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The critical nature of mother cell gene expression is also evidenced by the fact that of the three proteins known to be essential for engulfment, two are expressed only in the mother cell (SpoIID and SpoIIM; Driks and Losick, 1991Driks A. Losick R. Compartmentalized expression of a gene under the control of sporulation transcription factor sigma E in Bacillus subtilis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Losick R. Developmental commitment in a bacterium.Cell. 2005; 121: 401-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). SpoIID, SpoIIM, and SpoIIP (DMP) play a crucial role in the first step of engulfment, septal thinning, during which septal peptidoglycan is degraded (Figure 1). The main peptidoglycan hydrolase required for septal thinning is SpoIID (Abanes-De Mello et al., 2002Abanes-De Mello A. Sun Y.L. Aung S. Pogliano K. A cytoskeleton-like role for the bacterial cell wall during engulfment of the Bacillus subtilis forespore.Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 3253-3264Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), although peptidoglycan hydrolases involved in cell separation during growth can also contribute (Perez et al., 2006Perez A.R. Abanes-De Mello A. Pogliano K. Suppression of engulfment defects in bacillus subtilis by elevated expression of the motility regulon.J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 1159-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Septal thinning is necessary for movement of the engulfing membrane around the forespore. Thus far, no proteins specifically required for membrane migration have been identified, although some mutations in spoIID and spoIIP slow both septal thinning and membrane migration, suggesting that these proteins are required throughout engulfment (Abanes-De Mello et al., 2002Abanes-De Mello A. Sun Y.L. Aung S. Pogliano K. A cytoskeleton-like role for the bacterial cell wall during engulfment of the Bacillus subtilis forespore.Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 3253-3264Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This conclusion is supported by the localization of SpoIID, SpoIIM, and SpoIIP to the leading edge of the engulfing membrane (Abanes-De Mello et al., 2002Abanes-De Mello A. Sun Y.L. Aung S. Pogliano K. A cytoskeleton-like role for the bacterial cell wall during engulfment of the Bacillus subtilis forespore.Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 3253-3264Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The failure to identify additional proteins involved in membrane migration (Abanes-De Mello et al., 2002Abanes-De Mello A. Sun Y.L. Aung S. Pogliano K. A cytoskeleton-like role for the bacterial cell wall during engulfment of the Bacillus subtilis forespore.Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 3253-3264Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, Eichenberger et al., 2003Eichenberger P. Jensen S.T. Conlon E.M. van Ooij C. Silvaggi J. Gonzalez-Pastor J.E. Fujita M. Ben-Yehuda S. Stragier P. Liu J.S. Losick R. The σE regulon and the identification of additional sporulation genes in Bacillus subtilis.J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 945-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) suggests that either DMP proteins are the only dispensable proteins required for membrane migration, or that the requirement for additional proteins is masked either by their requirement at an earlier step in sporulation (such as polar septation) or by the presence of additional proteins that can compensate for their absence. In the absence of evidence for additional engulfment proteins, we previously proposed that the hydrolytic activity of the DMP proteins mediates membrane migration by processively degrading the peptidoglycan adjacent to the forespore, thereby pulling the mother cell membrane around the forespore (Figure 1B; Abanes-De Mello et al., 2002Abanes-De Mello A. Sun Y.L. Aung S. Pogliano K. A cytoskeleton-like role for the bacterial cell wall during engulfment of the Bacillus subtilis forespore.Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 3253-3264Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In this model, the bacterial cell wall provides a stationary pathway along which the hydrolase complex moves. This proposed role for the DMP proteins in membrane movement is similar to the recently described “burnt-bridge” Brownian ratchet, in which the random diffusion of a protein along a linear track (such as peptidoglycan) is converted into biased diffusion if the protein destroys its preferred binding site, so that backward diffusion is inhibited (Antal and Krapivsky, 2005Antal T. Krapivsky P.L. “Burnt-bridge” mechanism of molecular motor motion.Phys. Rev. E Stat. Nonlin. Soft Matter Phys. 2005; (in press.

Published online June 11, 2001)https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.64.011102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When adapted to engulfment, this model suggests that directional movement of the DMP proteins around the forespore is generated with thermal, rather than chemical energy, and that the hydrolytic activity of SpoIID renders this movement unidirectional. We here provide evidence for a DMP-independent mechanism for membrane migration. Specifically, we have made the unexpected observation that when peptidoglycan is enzymatically removed from sporulating B. subtilis cells, about half rapidly complete membrane migration. This process, which we call nascent protoplast engulfment, requires two proteins that are dispensable for engulfment in intact cells, SpoIIQ and SpoIIIAH, but does not require the engulfment proteins DMP, which are essential in intact cells. Our data suggest that SpoIIQ and SpoIIIAH might mediate engulfment by a ratchet-like mechanism. Ratchets are mechanical devices that ensure the unidirectional movement of a toothed wheel by virtue of a stationary pawl that inserts between the teeth to prevent backward rotation (Figure 1D). Several cellular proteins have recently been proposed to have ratchet-like activities that contribute directional movement to processes including translation, transcription, and the translocation of proteins across membranes (Bar-Nahum et al., 2005Bar-Nahum G.

Structures of the bacterial ribosome at 3.5 Å resolution.Science. 2005; 310: 827-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar). While in some of these cases the movement that is rendered unidirectional (i.e., rectified) might be generated by the expenditure of chemical energy, Brownian ratchets instead convert random movement generated by thermal energy into directional movement. They thereby provide an attractive mechanism for engulfment, which occurs during a starvation-induced differentiation pathway and in an extracellular milieu likely devoid of the chemical energy available in the cytoplasm. We also provide evidence that the SpoIIQ/SpoIIIAH (Q-AH) ratchet acts in intact cells, because it is essential for engulfment in mutants with either reduced DMP activity or a lack of the SpoIIB protein necessary for rapid engulfment. We propose that there are multiple protein systems or modules that contribute to engulfment, including the DMP septal thinning module and the Q-AH module. The development of separate modules that contribute to membrane migration during B. subtilis engulfment likely contributes robustness to the system, allowing engulfment to proceed with high fidelity in a changing environment. To test the model that the DMP proteins act as a peptidoglycan-directed motor that drives membrane migration during engulfment (Abanes-De Mello et al., 2002Abanes-De Mello A. Sun Y.L. Aung S. Pogliano K. A cytoskeleton-like role for the bacterial cell wall during engulfment of the Bacillus subtilis forespore.Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 3253-3264Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), we used lysozyme to degrade the peptidoglycan of sporulating cells in an osmotically protected medium. Membranes were stained with FM 4-64 and time lapse fluorescence microscopy was used to determine if protoplasts completed engulfment. When growing bacterial cells are treated with lysozyme, they lose their rod shape and become spherical. When sporulating cells are treated with lysozyme, they also become spherical and the smaller forespore remains attached to the larger mother cell, resulting in a snowman-like structure (Figure 2A). In intact cells, the fluorescent membrane stain FM 4-64 provides a quantitative indicator of septation and engulfment (Pogliano et al., 1999Pogliano J. Osborne N. Sharp M.D. Abanes-De Mello A. Perez A. Sun Y.L. Pogliano K. A vital stain for studying membrane dynamics in bacteria: a novel mechanism controlling septation during Bacillus subtilis sporulation.Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1149-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), with engulfed forespores staining three times as brightly as the cytoplasmic membrane due to the presence of three membrane layers around the forespore (see Figure 1A). After the addition of lysozyme, ∼60% of protoplasts apparently completed engulfment, since the forespore stained about 3-fold more brightly than the mother cell cytoplasmic membrane (Figures 2A, 2F, and 2L). A strain expressing a GFP-tagged membrane protein in the mother cell (PspoIID-SpoIIIJ-GFP) (Rubio et al., 2005Rubio A. Jiang X. Pogliano K. Localization of translocation complex components in Bacillus subtilis: enrichment of the signal recognition particle receptor at early sporulation septa.J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 5000-5002Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) was used to determine if the increased fluorescence intensity around the forespore was an artifact of FM 4-64 staining or a consequence of engulfment. If the increased FM 4-64 staining of some forespores reflects engulfment, then SpoIIIJ-GFP should move around the forespore after lysozyme treatment (Figure 2E). In protoplasts with brightly staining forespore membranes, GFP fluorescence moved around the forespore (Figures 2A and 2C, arrow). In contrast, in protoplasts with forespores that were not brightly stained, GFP fluorescence remained in the mother cell membrane (Figures 2A and 2C, arrowhead). Therefore, the enhanced FM 4-64 staining intensity following lysozyme treatment is a consequence of the advancement of the mother cell membrane around the forespore in an engulfment-like manner. Interestingly, the rate of engulfment during protoplast formation was extremely rapid and appeared limited only by cell wall degradation. While engulfment in intact cells requires ∼45 min (Pogliano et al., 1999Pogliano J. Osborne N. Sharp M.D. Abanes-De Mello A. Perez A. Sun Y.L. Pogliano K.

Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3331-3341Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) from the cell wall during membrane advancement (data not shown) suggests that protoplast engulfment occurs during, rather than after, cell wall removal. This process of nascent protoplast engulfment will hereafter be referred to as protoplast engulfment for brevity. To determine if proteins required for engulfment in intact cells are also required for protoplast engulfment, we examined the ability of a spoIID, spoIIM, and spoIIP triple mutant to complete engulfment after lysozyme treatment. Protoplast engulfment occurred at almost wild-type levels in the triple mutant (Figures 2F, 2G, and 2L; 43% versus 63% in wild-type). Other proteins not required for protoplast engulfment are SpoIIB (not shown), the absence of which causes uneven septal thinning but allows engulfment in intact cells (Margolis et al., 1993Margolis P.S. Driks A. Losick R. Sporulation gene spoIIB from Bacillus subtilis.J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 528-540Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Perez et al., 2000Perez A.R. Abanes-De Mello A. Pogliano K. SpoIIB localizes to active sites of septal biogenesis and spatially regulates septal thinning during engulfment in Bacillus subtilis.J.

Biol. 1991; 221: 1237-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Thus, protoplast engulfment is mediated by a DMP-independent mechanism. In eukaryotes, it has been proposed that zipper-like interactions between the phagocytic cell and the engulfed cell contribute to migration of the phagocytic membrane (Griffin et al., 1975Griffin Jr., F.M.

We therefore tested if two proteins that establish a zipper-like connection between the forespore and the mother cell, SpoIIQ and SpoIIIAH (Blaylock et al., 2004Blaylock B. Jiang X. Rubio A.

Neither protein is essential for engulfment in intact cells, although strains lacking SpoIIQ engulf more slowly than wild-type and are engulfment-defective under some conditions (Londono-Vallejo et al., 1997Londono-Vallejo J.A.

A dispensable role for forespore-specific gene expression in engulfment of the forespore during sporulation of Bacillus subtilis.J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2919-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). SpoIIQ was essential for protoplast engulfment, since spoIIQ protoplasts failed to complete engulfment. In addition, the spoIIQ strain showed a high frequency of forespores that had dissociated from their respective mother cells (hereafter called daughter cell separation), which occurred in 82% of spoIIQ protoplasts versus 12% of wild-type (Figures 2H and 2L). The spoIIIAG-AH double mutant, which lacks SpoIIIAH and another protein encoded by the operon (SpoIIIAG), also showed no protoplast engulfment and high levels of daughter cell separation (Figure 2I and 2L). This phenotype was due to the absence of the SpoIIQ binding protein SpoIIIAH, since a spoIIIAH single mutant was identical to the spoIIIAG-AH double mutant, while a spoIIIAG single mutant was similar to wild-type (see Figure S2 in the Supplemental Data). These results indicate that protoplast engulfment depends on SpoIIQ and SpoIIIAH, two interacting proteins produced in adjacent daughter cells, but not on DMP. The strong interaction between SpoIIQ and SpoIIIAH suggests that they might comprise a ratchet that prevents the backward movement of the engulfing mother cell membrane. In this model, protoplast engulfment could be mediated by a Brownian ratchet, in which the random thermal motion of the engulfing membrane is captured by the successive securing of the forespore to the mother cell via the Q-AH zipper. This model predicts that there should be a threshold level of SpoIIQ protein required for protoplast engulfment (the level necessary to extend around the forespore), below which the mother cell and forespore would remain attached, but no protoplast engulfment would be observed. In contrast, if SpoIIQ were acting as an enzyme during protoplast engulfment, reducing its levels should progressively slow engulfment. The ratchet model also predicts that the forespore protein SpoIIQ assembles a stable scaffold capable of resisting backward movement of the engulfing mother cell membrane. These predictions are tested in the following sections. To test if reduced SpoIIQ levels inhibit protoplast engulfment and stability, mutations were introduced into the spoIIQ ribosome binding site to produce varying amounts of the wild-type protein (see Table S1 in the Supplemental Data). SpoIIQ levels were assessed by immunoblot using SpoIIQ- and FtsZ-specific antibodies (the latter as a loading control; Figure 3). Several SpoIIQ activities s"

This non-enzymatic process occurs via the formation of a succinimide intermediate (cyclic imide) following nucleophilic attack of the Asx side-chain carbonyl group by the amide nitrogen at the C-flanking amino acid (see Fig. 1). Hydrolysis of the succinimide leads to formation of isoaspartyl (isoAsp) and aspartyl products in a typical ratio of 3 to 1. The β-linkage characteristic of the predominant isoaspartyl form introduces a kink into the polypeptide backbone that can disrupt normal protein folding and activity. Isoaspartyl formation is strongly influenced by the amino acid that immediately follows (is C-flanking to) an Asn or Asp residue, by the degree of local polypeptide flexibility, and by environmental stressors such as high pH, heat shock, radiation, and oxidation. The enzyme activity we now call protein l-isoaspartyl methyltransferase (PIMT, EC 2.1.1.77) was first encountered in 1965 by Axelrod and Daly (7Axelrod J. Daly J. Science. 1965; 150: 892-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) as an S-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet)-dependent methanol-forming enzyme activity in pituitary extracts. By 1973 it became apparent that this enzyme was a protein methyltransferase whose immediate products were protein methyl esters that spontaneously hydrolyze over a period of minutes to hours at physiological pH (8Morin A.M. Liss M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1973; 52: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 9Kim S. Arch. Biochem.

A. 1974; 71: 1701-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). For the following 10 years, it was generally assumed that methylation occurred on the side-chain carboxyls of normal aspartyl or glutamyl residues and that methylation was probably serving to regulate protein activity in a manner analogous to protein phosphorylation. It was not until 1984 that this widely distributed methyltransferase was found to have a high degree of specificity for atypical l-isoaspartyl residues (11Aswad D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10714-10721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Murray Jr., E.D. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10722-10732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, it was shown that isoaspartate formation is a common form of protein damage at physiological pH and temperature, fostering the idea that PIMT functions as an important intracellular repair enzyme. As predicted by the repair hypothesis, one finds that isoaspartate levels rise dramatically above their normally low steady-state levels when PIMT activity is reduced in vivo by pharmacological inhibition of cultured cells (13Johnson B.A. Najbauer J.

As illustrated in Fig. 1, the repair mechanism is a three-stage process: 1) enzymatic methylation of the α-carboxyl group of the l-isoaspartyl site, 2) spontaneous formation of a succinimide intermediate, and 3) spontaneous hydrolysis of the succinimide to generate a mixture of 15-30% l-aspartyl and 70-85% l-isoaspartyl forms. Although each cycle through this repair pathway is only 15-30% efficient, recycling of the isoAsp sites through the PIMT reaction results in an overall repair efficiency of 85% or greater. This has been shown in vitro with synthetic isoaspartyl peptides (17Johnson B.A. Murray Jr., E.D. Clarke S. Glass D.B. Aswad D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5622-5629Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18McFadden P.N. Clarke S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1987; 262: 12283-12287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and synapsin I (20Reissner K.J. Paranandi M.V. Luc T.M. Doyle H.A. Mamula M.J. Lowenson J.D. Aswad D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 8389-8398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Moreover, recent studies demonstrating an unusual d/l enantiomer ratio of Asp-25 in histone H2B (an endogenous substrate for PIMT) strongly suggest that repair of isoAsp formation at this site occurs in vivo with an overall efficiency of ∼87% (21Young G.W. Hoofring S.A. Mamula M.J. Doyle H.A. Bunick G.J. Hu Y. Aswad D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26094-26098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The inability of PIMT to restore the normal side-chain amide of deamidated asparagine sites may be of little significance given the much greater importance of having a normal peptide backbone for proper protein folding. Despite considerable progress made over the past 41 years in elucidating the function of “methanol-forming enzyme,” there has been relatively little information regarding the identity of its major endogenous substrates. This situation is attributable to the fact that isoAsp levels are normally held to very low levels by PIMT action, and the fact that the protein methyl ester products of the PIMT reaction are so unstable that they do not survive most commonly used methods of high resolution protein separation. Until now, only four proteins have been found to serve as targets of PIMT action in vivo: calmodulin (20Reissner K.J. Paranandi M.V. Luc T.M. Doyle H.A. Mamula M.J. Lowenson J.D. Aswad D.W. J. Biol.

The discovery of all four of these proteins came not from systematic proteomics but rather from a combination of serendipity and guess work. The recent creation of mice deficient in PIMT activity provides a unique opportunity to carry out an unbiased search for endogenous substrates for this enzyme.

Abnormalities in the immune system of PIMT-KO have also been found; namely increased T-lymphocyte proliferation and increased antibody production (31Doyle H.A. Gee R.J. Mamula M.J. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 2840-2847Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To understand more about the special need for PIMT activity in brain, we embarked on a proteomics approach to obtain a more global picture of the major substrates for PIMT in this organ. Our approach to this problem is founded on the observation that endogenous substrates for PIMT accumulate high levels of isoAsp in the PIMT-KO mouse (15Kim E. Lowenson J.D. MacLaren D.C. Clarke S.

When extracts of the KO mouse brain are 3H-methylated by PIMT in vitro and separated by SDS-PAGE under acidic conditions, it is apparent that a diverse group of proteins are acting as endogenous substrates. Unfortunately, until now, the low chemical stability of the [3H]methyl esters has made it difficult to employ the high resolution separation techniques needed to identify the individual radiolabeled proteins. To circumvent this problem, we separated the unmethylated proteins by two-dimensional-gel electrophoresis, transferred them to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane, and then 3H-methylated them on the membrane with an overlay of recombinant PIMT and [methyl-3H]AdoMet. Autofluorography of the membrane provided information on which Coomassie-stained spots on a parallel two-dimensional gel corresponded to major methyl acceptors. Peptide mass fingerprinting of these spots allowed us to identify 22 proteins that are major endogenous substrates for PIMT. Materials—Bio-Lyte 3/10 and Bio-Lyte 5/8 ampholytes were purchased from Bio-Rad. Immobilon-P PVDF membranes (0.45 μm) were purchased from Millipore.

Sequencing grade modified trypsin was purchased from Promega. Mice—Heterozygous PIMT+/- founder pairs (from which PIMT wild-type, heterozygous, and knock-out mice were bred) were kindly provided by Dr. Edward Kim of the Gladstone Institute of Cardiovascular Disease, San Francisco, CA, in conjunction with the laboratories of Dr. Stephen Young at the same institution, and Dr. Steven Clarke at the University of California, Los Angeles (15Kim E.

The presence of the neo gene and presence/absence of the PIMT gene were detected by PCR of tail DNA using the following primers: PIMT forward, 5′-GCAGCGACGGCAGTAACAGC-3′; PIMT reverse, 5′-ACCCTCTTCCCATCCACATC-3′; neo forward, 5′-GCACGAGGAAGCGGTCAGCCCATTC-3′; and neo reverse, 5′-CGCATCGAGCGAGCACGTACTCGG-3′. Mice were sacrificed at ∼4-6 weeks of age by cervical dislocation, and brains were rapidly removed and frozen at -80 °C. Preparation of Mouse Brain Extract—Approximately 2 g of mouse brain (PIMT-/- or PIMT+/+) tissue was used in each preparation. The tissue sample was cut into small pieces and mixed with 9 volumes of cold homogenization buffer (5 mm K-Hepes, pH 7.6, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% (w/v) sucrose, and 1% mammalian protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma catalog no. P3840)). The suspension was homogenized for 10 strokes (up and down) using a Potter-Elvejhem homogenizer with a rotating Teflon pestle. The homogenate was filtered through two layers of cheesecloth and centrifuged at 800 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was removed and stored at -80 °C. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of Recombinant Rat PIMT—Rat PIMT cDNA was PCR-amplified from a rat liver cDNA pool (Clontech) and subcloned into pET28a (+) between BamH1 and XhoI. The recombinant plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells. Expression of rat PIMT was induced in LB media with the addition of 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside at 37 °C for 3 h. Cells were harvested and stored at -80 °C. The 6×His PIMT was purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography (Qiagen) as recommended by the manufacturer. Eluted proteins were dialyzed at 4 °C overnight against 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. The specific activity of the purified PIMT was ∼14,000 pmol/min/mg protein using bovine γ-globulin as the methyl acceptor (32Aswad D.W. Deight E.A. J.

Methylation of Mouse Brain Extracts by Recombinant PIMT—To label isoaspartyl proteins in mouse brain extracts, methylation reactions were performed in the presence of recombinant rat PIMT with [methyl-3H]AdoMet as the methyl donor. A typical reaction (20 μl) consisted of 100 mm Na-MES (pH 6.2), 40 μg of mouse brain extract, 2.5 μm recombinant PIMT, and 100 μm [methyl-3H]AdoMet. The reaction was initiated by adding AdoMet, incubating at 30 °C for 10 min, and stopped by adding 6 μl of the 4×-concentrated SDS-PAGE sample buffer (pH 6.8) described by Laemmli and Favre (33Laemmli U.K. Favre M. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 80: 575-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (3025) Google Scholar). After heating at 50 °C for 10 min, samples were subjected to electrophoresis in 4-12% NuPAGE gels (Invitrogen) using the MES running buffer at 50 V, 4 °C for 4 h. The gel was stained in the Coomassie blue, destained, impregnated with sodium salicylate (34Chamberlain J.P. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 98: 132-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar), and dried under vacuum. The dried gel was exposed to preflashed (35Laskey R.A. Mills A.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 56: 335-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (3037) Google Scholar) BioMAX XAR film (Kodak) at -80 °C. Two-dimensional PAGE and Electroblotting—Non-equilibrium pH gradient electrophoresis (NEPHGE) was based on the method of O'Farrell (36O'Farrell P.Z. Goodman H.M. O'Farrell P.H. Cell. 1977; 12: 1133-1142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2583) Google Scholar). First dimension gels were polymerized in 13.5 × 0.45-cm glass tubes containing 4% acrylamide/bisacrylamide (29:1), 9.2 m urea, 2% (w/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.4% Bio-Lyte 3/10, 1.6% Bio-Lyte 5/8. ∼160 μg of mouse brain extract was solubilized in NEPHGE sample buffer (9 m urea, 0.8% Bio-Lyte 5/8, and 0.2% Bio-Lyte 3/10). The solubilized samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 14,000 rpm, and the clear supernatant (∼50 μl) was applied to the tube gel, overlaid with 20 μl of NEPHGE sample buffer, and filled with anode solution (10 mm H3PO4). The upper chamber of the electrophoresis apparatus was filled with 10 mm H3PO4 solution, and the lower chamber was filled with degassed cathode solution (20 mm NaOH). Tube gels were run at 500 V for 4 h at room temperature. After electrophoresis, the tube gel was extruded and equilibrated in 12 ml of SDS sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, and 5% 2-mercaptoethanol) for 1 h at room temperature, and stored at -80 °C. For the second dimension, SDS-PAGE slab gels utilized the Tris-glycine buffer system described by Laemmli and Favre (33Laemmli U.K. Favre M. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 80: 575-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (3025) Google Scholar). The separating gel was 8.5%, and stacking gel was 4%. Electrophoresis was carried out at 40 mA per gel in a Bio-Rad PROTEAN II Xi cell at room temperature. After electrophoresis, the gel was equilibrated with transfer buffer (25 mm Tris, 193 mm glycine, pH 8.3, 20% ethanol) for 30 min. Proteins were then transferred onto an Immobilon-P PVDF membrane at 50 V, 4 °C for 4 h. After blotting, the membrane was either stained with Coomassie Blue or used directly for on-membrane methylation. On-blot Methylation and Fluorography—Prior to on-blot methylation, the membrane was incubated with 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in 10 mm Na-MES (pH 6.2) for 30 min and then placed on a glass plate in the hood. Methylation solution (6 ml) consisting of 100 mm Na-MES, pH 6.2, 4 μm recombinant rat PIMT, 4 μm [3H]AdoMet (10,000 dpm/pmol), and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin was warmed to 30 °C and then pipetted onto the membrane surface. After a reaction time of 20 min at room temperature, the membrane was rinsed briefly with water, then washed twice with stop buffer (10 mm Na-MES, pH 6.2, 0.3 m NaCl, 50 μm S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20) for 15 min. Finally the membrane was soaked in water for 5 min and in methanol for 20 s, and then air-dried. The dry membrane was taped to a filter paper backing, sprayed with EN3HANCE™, and exposed to preflashed KODAK BioMAX XAR film at -80 °C. In-gel Digestion—Two-dimensional gels were lightly stained (20 min) with Coomassie Blue. Spots of interest from the two-dimensional gel were excised using a OneTouch manual spot picker (The Gel Company, San Francisco, CA), destained in 50% acetonitrile, reduced with 20 mm dithiothreitol at 45 °C for 30 min, and alkylated with 100 mm iodoacetamide in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate for 30 min at 37 °C in the dark. The processed gel spots were digested with trypsin at 37 °C overnight. The tryptic peptides were extracted twice with 50 μl of extraction solution (50% (v/v) acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water). The combined extracts were concentrated to ∼20 μl and cleaned up with ZipTip (C18, Millipore Inc., Bedford, MA) according to the product instructions. The peptides were eluted with 4 μl of extraction solution from the Zip-Tip for analysis by mass spectrometry. MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry and Database Search—Tryptic digests were analyzed by MALDI-TOF (matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight) mass spectrometry. Analytical samples consisted of 1 part tryptic digest, 1 part peptide calibration mix, and 2 parts matrix (10 mg/ml α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in water). Mass data were acquired in the positive reflector mode on a Voyager-DE STR Biospectrometry workstation (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). To identify proteins, the calibrated de-isotoped peak list for each digest was queried against the UniProt data base using the ProteinPropector MS-FIT program (University of California, San Francisco) at propector.ucsf.com. Western Blots—The PVDF membrane from either a one-dimensional gel or two-dimensional gel was first blocked with 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline containing Tween 20 (0.05%, v/v) for 30 min. The membrane was then incubated first with primary antibody (1:10,000) in 5% nonfat milk for 2 h followed, then with secondary ECL detection antibody (1:10,000) for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was washed 3× in Tris-buffered saline containing Tween 20 (0.05%, v/v) following antibody incubation. The ECL-Plus Western Detection System (Amersham Biosciences) was used to develop and detect the signals. Generation of Anti-mouse CRMP2 Polyclonal Antibody—A synthetic peptide, acetyl-DITEWHKGIQEEGC-NH2 containing mouse CRMP2 140-151 sequence, was designed for antibody generation. Two rabbits were immunized with peptide conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. The polyclonal anti-body was then purified from antisera using a peptide-coupled affinity column. The purified antibodies were dialyzed in phosphate-buffered saline buffer at 4 °C overnight. Peptide synthesis and antibody production were contracted to AnaSpec Inc. (San Jose, CA). Protein Concentration—Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry et al. (37Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. Development of Methodology for Global Separation and Detection of Isoaspartyl Proteins in Brain Extracts of the PIMT-KO Mouse—To achieve a global analysis of proteins that serve as major substrates for PIMT in mammalian brain we considered two strategies, both of which are based on the fact that isoaspartyl proteins accumulate to high levels in the PIMT-KO mouse brain and that such proteins can be selectively labeled by PIMT-catalyzed methylation using [methyl-3H]AdoMet as the methyl donor. The first approach we tested was to pass brain extracts from PIMT-KO mice slowly over a PIMT-agarose column at 4 °C in the presence of unlabeled AdoMet. Because PIMT has a low catalytic turnover number (∼0.4 min-1 at 30 °C) we reasoned that isoaspartyl proteins might form a sufficiently stable ternary complex (isoaspartyl protein·PIMT·AdoMet) to bind a number of isoaspartyl proteins to the column. Elution of the isoaspartyl proteins could then be carried out by addition of the strong competitive inhibitor S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine to displace the AdoMet and weaken the protein-PIMT interaction as predicted by the relevant enzyme kinetics (38Johnson B.A. Aswad D.W. Neurochem. Res. 1993; 18: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Attempts to employ this strategy were unsuccessful; no binding or significant retardation of isoaspartyl proteins on the column was observed. Our second strategy was to separate proteins from the PIMT-KO mouse brain by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, transfer the proteins to PVDF membranes, and then detect the positions of the PIMT substrates by on-blot 3H-methylation followed by fluorographic imaging on x-ray film. Our motivation to try this approach was bolstered by the success of Lee and Bedford (39Lee J. Bedford M.T. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 268-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) who used on-blot 3H-methylation to detect substrates for protein arginine methyltransferases on a commercial membrane-bound array of expressed proteins. We favored post-separation, on-blot 3H-methylation, as opposed to 3H-methylation prior to separation, because we feared significant loss of the labile [3H]methyl esters during the separations. The first dimension of isoelectric focusing or NEPHGE, especially, would expose the more basic proteins to high pH resulting in loss of the 3H label as proposed by O'Connor and Clarke (40O'Connor C.M. Clarke S. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 148: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Our ability to detect PIMT substrates by on-blot methylation was first tested using one-dimensional SDS-PAGE for protein separation. Fig. 2A shows the results of a control experiment in which proteins from PIMT+/+ or PIMT-/- mice were analyzed for isoAsp content by the traditional pre-gel-labeling approach in which 3H-methylated brain extracts are subjected to SDS-PAGE under conditions designed to minimize protein methyl ester hydrolysis. After electrophoresis, the wet gel is then impregnated with scintillant, dried, and exposed to x-ray film to image the 3H-labeled isoaspartyl proteins. This control experiment confirmed that PIMT-deficient mice accumulate h"

However, the mechanism of how the intrinsically linear amyloid fibrils form spherical senile plaques is unknown. With total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy combined with the use of thioflavin T, an amyloid-specific fluorescence dye, we succeeded in observing the formation of the senile plaque-like spherulitic structures with diameters of around 15 μm on the chemically modified quartz surface. Real-time observation at a single fibrillar level revealed that, in the absence of tight contact with the surface, the cooperative and radial growth of amyloid fibrils from the core leads to a huge spherulitic structure. The results suggest the underlying physicochemical mechanism of senile plaque formation, essential for obtaining insight into prevention of Alzheimer disease.

The formation of Aβ amyloid fibrils is considered to be a nucleation-dependent process in which Aβ peptides slowly associate to form a nucleus, which then grows via an extension reaction involving the sequential incorporation of Aβ peptides, producing rigid and straight morphology consisting of several layers of cross-β sheets (6Naiki H. Nakakuki K. Lab. Investig. 1996; 74: 374-383PubMed Google Scholar, 7Harper J.D. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 385-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1403) Google Scholar). This process is influenced by several factors, i.e. peptide concentration, pH, ionic strength, and interactions with other components (8McLaurin J. Yang D.S. Yip C.M. Fraser P.E. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 130: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 9Petkova A.T. Leapman R.D. Guo A. Yau W.M. Mattson M.P. Tycko R. Science. 2005; 307: 262-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar). The interactions with lipid membranes in particular have received attention because the membrane surface might be responsible for both neurotoxicity and senile plaque formation (10Kakio A. Nishimoto S. Yanagisawa K. Kozutsumi Y. Matsuzaki K. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7385-7390Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 11Gellermann G.P. Appel T.R. Tannert A. Radestock A. Hortschansky P.

For several proteins including Aβ, amyloid fibrils prepared on the solid substrates such as mica or quartz produce radial assemblies (13Blackley H.K.L. Sanders G.H.W. Davies M.C. Roberts C.J.

Considering that in several neurodegenerative diseases, radial and spherical aggregates of amyloid fibrils are found in tissue deposits (5Jin L. Claborn K. Kurimoto M. Geday M. Maezawa I. Sohraby F.

Yang F. Cole G. Science. 1996; 274: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (3635) Google Scholar), surface interaction may play dominant roles in the formation of amyloid fibrils and their deposition in vivo (7Harper J.D. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 385-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1403) Google Scholar, 17Manuelidis L. Fritch W. Xi Y.-G. Science. 1997; 277: 94-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Moreover, amyloid deposits are found in a specific tissue region, suggesting that a specific surface chemistry is involved in the fibril formation and deposition processes in general. However, the behavior of amyloid fibrils on solid surfaces is still far from clear. To obtain further insight into the mechanism of senile plaque formation and the effects of surface, direct observations are needed. We previously developed a unique approach to monitoring fibril growth in real time at the single fibril level (18Ban T. Hamada D. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16462-16465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 19Ban T. Hoshino M. Takahashi S. Hamada D. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 344: 757-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), in which TIRFM was combined with the use of thioflavin T, an amyloid-specific fluorescence dye (20Naiki H. Higuchi K. Hosokawa M. Takeda T. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 177: 244-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). With this approach, we focused on the effects of the physicochemical properties of surface on the growth of amyloid fibrils of Aβ. Chemical Modification of Surfaces—Octadecyltriethoxysilane (OTS) was purchased from Shin-Etsu Chemical (Tokyo, Japan). Aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTS) was obtained from Tokyo Kasei Kogyo (Tokyo, Japan). Polystyrenesulfonate (PSS: molecular weight (Mr) 70,000), polyacrylic acid (PAA: Mr 30,000), and polyvinylsulfonate (PVS: Mr unknown) were purchased from Sigma. Polyethyleneimine (PEI: Mr 60,000) was obtained from Nacalai tesque (Kyoto, Japan). 10-(Carbomethoxy) decyldimethylchlorosilane (CMDDS: Mr 292.92) was purchased from Gelest (Morrisville, PA). The surface of quartz slides was modified either by adsorbing polyelectrolytes or by grafting a silane monolayer with a functional terminal group (21Morigaki K. Walde P.G. Langmuir. 2002; 18: 10509-10511Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In both cases, either positively or negatively charged surfaces were generated by the chemical species directly exposed to the solution (the uppermost polyelectrolyte layer or the terminal group of silane). Quartz slides were first cleaned with 0.5% (v/v) Hellmanex (Hellma, Müllheim, Germany)/water and then treated with a solution of NH4OH (28% w/v)/H2O2 (30% w/v)/H2O (0.05:1:5, v/v/v) for 15 min at 65 °C, rinsed extensively with distilled water, and finally dried in a vacuum oven at 110 °C (21Morigaki K. Walde P.G. Langmuir. 2002; 18: 10509-10511Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Hydrophobic substrates were prepared by the silanization of OTS (21Morigaki K. Walde P.G. Langmuir. 2002; 18: 10509-10511Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 22Xia Y. Mrksich M. Kim E. Whitesides G.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 9576-9577Crossref Scopus (300) Google Scholar). For the silanization, quartz slides were incubated in an OTS solution (0.04% w/v in tetrahydrofuran/cyclohexane (1:20, v/v)) and subsequently annealed at 110 °C for 30 min. Positively charged surfaces were prepared by the silanization of APTS (23Jonas U. del Campo A. Kruger C. Glasser G. Boos D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5034-5039Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) or adsorption of PEI by incubating quartz in aqueous solutions of APTS (1% w/v) or PEI (0.1% w/v) (21Morigaki K. Walde P.G. Langmuir. 2002; 18: 10509-10511Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 24Anzai J. Kobayashi Y. Nakamura N. Nishimura M. Hoshi T. Langmuir. 1999; 15: 221-226Crossref Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Negatively charged surfaces were prepared either by layer-by-layer deposition of polyelectrolytes or by using a self-assembled monolayer of silanes (21Morigaki K. Walde P.G. Langmuir. 2002; 18: 10509-10511Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 25Decher G. Science. 1997; 277: 1232-1237Crossref Scopus (9385) Google Scholar). The former type was created by the adsorption of PSS, PAA, or PVS onto positively charged surfaces of PEI or APTS. The other type of negatively charged surface was prepared by silanization of the substrate with CMDDS followed by hydrolysis of the ester terminal group, forming a monolayer of 10-(carboxy)decyldimethylchlorosilane. Water contact angles were determined with a contact angle meter (Kyowa Interface Science, Saitama, Japan) at room temperature. Data were averages of the measurements of at least three spots. Direct Observation of Amyloid Fibrils—The TIRFM system used to observe individual amyloid fibrils was developed based on an inverted microscope (IX70, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) as described (18Ban T. Hamada D. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16462-16465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 19Ban T. Hoshino M. Takahashi S. Hamada D. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 344: 757-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 26Wazawa T. Ueda M. Adv. Biochem. Engin. Biotechonol. 2005; 95: 77-106PubMed Google Scholar). The ThT molecule was excited at 442 nm by a helium-cadmium laser (IK5552R-F, Kimmon, Tokyo, Japan). The fluorescence image was filtered with a bandpass filter (D490/30, Omega Optical, Brattleboro, VT) and visualized using a digital steel camera (DP70, Olympus). Aβ-(1-40) peptides were purchased from the Peptide Institute (Osaka, Japan). The purity was >95% according to the elution pattern of high performance liquid chromatography. Aβ-(1-40) was dissolved in a 0.02% ammonia solution to 500 μm at 4 °C. Aβ-(1-40) amyloid fibrils were prepared by the fibril extension method as described previously (27Hasegawa K. Yamaguchi I. Omata S. Gejyo F. Naiki H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15514-15521Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Seeds were prepared by the fragmentation of amyloid fibrils for 5 min with a TAITEC VP-30S sonicator (Saitama, Japan) equipped with a microtip. The seeds were added at a final concentration of 5 μg/ml to 50 μm monomeric Aβ-(1-40) in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer at pH 7.5 and 100 mm NaCl. After 3 h at 37 °C in the test tube, 100 μm ThT was added at a final concentration of 5 μm. An aliquot (14 μl) of sample solution was deposited on each microscopic slide, and an image of the fibrils was obtained with TIRFM. The formation of Aβ-(1-40) fibrils on various surfaces was also examined. After the mixing of the solutions of seeds, monomeric proteins, and ThT at the same final concentrations as above, the mixture was immediately deposited on the microscopic slide and incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. For the real-time observation of Aβ-(1-40) amyloid fibril growth, the seed fibrils were added at a final concentration of 0.5 μg/ml to 50 μm monomeric Aβ-(1-40) in polymerization buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate buffer at pH 7.5 and 100 mm NaCl). The ThT solution was then added at a final concentration of 5 μm, sample mixtures were deposited on the PEI/PVS surface, and fibrils were observed every 2 min under TIRFM at 37 °C. Laser Scanning Confocal Microscopy and Three-dimensional Reconstruction of Spherulitic Structures—For the confocal image observation, Aβ-(1-40)amyloid fibrils were prepared under the same conditions as used for the TIRFM observation. Confocal images were taken with a laser scanning confocal microscope (Fluoview FV1000, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). ThT was excited by 458 nm light of a multiargon laser. For through-focus imaging, all optical sections were collected with 0.25 μm z axis steps and were clarified through Kalman filtration. The three-dimensional reconstitution of stacked images was performed with Amira 4.0 (Mercury Computer Systems, Chelmsford, MA). Quartz crystal microbalance measurements are provided in Supplemental Fig. 3. Transmission Electron Microscopy—The presence of amyloid fibrils in the spherulitic structures was examined by electron microscopy. After confirming the formation of spherulitic structures under TIRFM, the coverslip was carefully removed from the quartz substrate. An aliquot (5 μl) of distilled water was deposited on the substrate, and then carbon-coated copper grids (400 mesh) were put on the substrate for 3 min so as to transfer the fibrils. Then, the grids were stained with a 2% (w/v) uranyl acetate solution. Electron micrographs were acquired using a transmission microscope (100CX, JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) at 80 kV with magnification ×29,000. Effects of Various Surfaces on the Formation of Aβ Fibrils—We observed the seed-dependent formation of Aβ-(1-40) fibrils on the surface of various chemically modified substrates that were created either by alternative adsorption of polyelectrolytes or with self-assembled monolayers of silanes. The results are compiled in Fig. 1 and Table 1. In the presence of the Aβ-(1-40) seed fibrils, enhanced fibril formation was observed on negatively charged surfaces, including quartz and PEI/PVS. On quartz, intense growth led to remarkably long fibrils as reported previously (Fig. 1A) (19Ban T. Hoshino M. Takahashi S. Hamada D. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Mol.

Real-time observation showed that once growth started, unidirectional growth continued until the depletion of monomers, producing long fibrils of uniform width (Supplemental Fig. 1). Such long fibrils were not observed in solution, indicating that moderate interaction with the surface prevents the lateral association of growing fibrils, thus enabling the persistent growth.TABLE 1Physicochemical properties of the substrates and morphology of the Aβ fibrilsSurface materialsSurface chargeWater contact angleaThe water contact angle is the maximal angle between the surface of the substrate and that of the water droplet: Repulsion between the substrate and water makes the angle larger, thus giving a measure of the hydrophobicity of the substrate.Fibril growth pattern°QuartzNegative0Linear and radialCDDSb10-(carboxy)decyldimethylchlorosilane.Negative10Linear and radialPEI/PVSNegative0SphericalAPTS/PVSNegative6SphericalPEI/PAANegative24SphericalPEI/PSSNegative58SphericalOTSNon-charged105No growthAPTSPositive62No growthPEIPositive35No growtha The water contact angle is the maximal angle between the surface of the substrate and that of the water droplet: Repulsion between the substrate and water makes the angle larger, thus giving a measure of the hydrophobicity of the substrate.b 10-(carboxy)decyldimethylchlorosilane. Open table in a new tab Formation of Aβ Spherulitic Structures—Fibril growth was especially prominent on the surfaces covered with PEI/PVS, highly negatively charged and hydrophilic polyelectrolytes (Fig. 1D). We initially presumed that the growth of fibrils on the PEI/PVS initiated from large clustered seeds attached to the surface. However, the real-time observation revealed striking images of fibril growth, producing huge spherical assemblies with a densely packed radial pattern (Fig. 2A and Supplemental Movie 1). Importantly, no branching of the growing ends was observed as on quartz (see also Figs. 3 and 4, below).FIGURE 3Electron micrographs of the Aβ-(1-40) amyloid fibrils.

The spherulitic structures were prepared on the PEI/PVS surface under the same conditions as used for the real-time observation.

A and B, direct observation of Aβ-(1-40) fibril growth on quartz (A) and in spherulitic assemblies (B) by TIRFM. C, fibril length was plotted against incubation time for various fibrils to obtain the growth rate (D). The fibrils used for the analysis were taken from Supplemental Fig. 1 for fibrils on quartz (open symbols) and from Fig. 2A for spherulitic fibrils (solid symbols). The scale bars in panels A and B represent 10 μm. Although the pause of fibril growth on quartz (e.g. quartz f3) is a real pause, the apparent pause and subsequent rapid growth of fibrils in spherulitic structures (e.g. pvs f2) would be caused by the transient disappearance of the fibrils from evanescent fields.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We also examined the spherical assemblies by a laser scanning confocal microscopy; a three-dimensional reconstruction image (Fig. 2B) and all sectional images (Supplemental Movie 2) indicated that they are built up with ThT-positive amyloid fibrils. It is noted that the confocal microscopy image shown in Fig. 2B gives a close-up view of core regions. To examine the presence of amyloid fibrils in the spherical assemblies, and moreover, their morphology at high resolution, we analyzed the spherical assemblies by transmission electron microscopy. After confirming the spherical assemblies under TIRFM, they were transferred from the PEI/PVS surface to a carbon grid and then analyzed by the electron microscopy with magnification ×29,000. Electron micrographs showed both separated fibrils (Fig. 3A) and clustered fibrils, suggesting a radial growth pattern (Fig. 3B). Expanded images revealed unbranched and twisted fibril morphology with a diameter of 7-14 nm, basically consistent with previous reports (Fig. 3E) (28Goldsbury C.S. Wirtz S. Müller S.A. Sunderji S. Wicki P. Aebi U. Frey P. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 130: 217-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). It is noted that transmission electron microscopy is not useful for reproducing the huge spherultic structures as reported for bovine insulin with a scanning electron microscopy (30Krebs M.R.H. MacPhee C.E. Miller A.F. Dunlop I.E. Dobson C.M. Donald A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 14420-14424Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Moreover, the observed images suggest that the spherultic assemblies were partly broken during the transfer from PEI/PVS substrate to the carbon grids. However, we can fairly conclude that the spherical assemblies are made of typical amyloid fibrils. Similar fibrillar structures were also observed for the fibrils formed on a quartz surface, although their transfer to carbon-coated grids was less efficient (Fig. 3C). On the other hand, fibrils formed in the test tube exhibited more loosely coiled fibrils with a diameter of 15 nm (Fig. 3, D and F), suggesting that both quartz and PEI/PVS surfaces induced a slight morphological change. In particular, such a loosely coiled fibril was rarely observed in the spherical assemblies. In the spherical assemblies, fibril growth continued linearly as on quartz, when length was plotted against time, until the depletion of monomers (Fig. 4). Incidentally, the rates of growth were similar (∼0.3 μm/min) for both types of fibrils (19Ban T. Hoshino M. Takahashi S. Hamada D. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 344: 757-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). This result supports morphological similarity of individual fibrils. Thus, once the fibril growth started, the rate of fibril growth might be less affected by the physicochemical properties of the surface, although the extents of seed clustering and adsorption significantly depend on the surface. Considering that TIRFM illumination has a depth of penetration of ∼150 nm and the depth of focus on the objective lens is about 100 nm, the large clusters of seeds formed at first in solution and were not in contact with the substrate. The hazy areas observed at the initial stages, as indicated in Fig. 2A by arrows, may represent the clustered seeds or aggregated intermediates formed in solution. Since the thickness of the water medium estimated from the fine focus stroke between the quartz slide and the coverslip is about 10 μm, the spherical assemblies observed here are in fact flattened spheres. However, three-dimensional reconstruction image based on confocal microscopy observation suggests that the core region is indeed spherical (Fig. 2B). The surface used for TIRFM observation was located on the upper side of the cell, so the clustered fibrils on the surface are not deposited by gravitational force. As for other substrates, extensive fibril formation was generally observed on the surfaces with negative charges, regardless of whether they were modified by a polyelectrolyte or silane (Fig. 1, A-F). In contrast, fibril growth was largely suppressed on positively charged or hydrophobic surfaces (Fig. 1, G-I). The image obtained with hydrophobic surface suggested that the binding efficiency of seed fibrils are less than that of other surfaces. Thus, the efficiency of seed adsorption may be an important factor determining the fibril growth (see below). To examine the effects of seeding, we studied the spontaneous fibril formation with variously modified surfaces. Although a similar massive growth of fibrils was observed even for spontaneous fibril formation on the negatively charged surfaces, spontaneous fibril formation was also suppressed on the positively charged surfaces (Supplemental Fig. 2). We then confirmed that the observed morphological differences were induced during the fibril growth on the surface; loading of the fibrils preformed in a test tube to various substrates did not induce the morphological changes (Fig. 5). Interaction of Aβ with Various Surfaces—The Aβ-(1-40) sequence is divided into the polar region (1D-28K), with both positive (5R, 13H, 14H, 16K, 28K) and negative (1D, 3E, 7D, 11E, 22E, 23D) charges, and the hydrophobic transmembrane regions (29G-40V) (4Mattson M.P. Nature. 2004; 430: 631-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (2403) Google Scholar). The net charge of Aβ-(1-40) at pH 7 is slightly negative. To address the interaction of Aβ with various surfaces, we used quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring, by which the mass and viscoelastic properties of bound ligands can be estimated (29Richter R.P. Brisson A.R. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 3422-3433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). The results indicated that although Aβ monomers and fibrils bind to a variety of surfaces at pH 7, the binding of seed fibrils to the hydrophobic surface is less than that of others (Supplemental Fig. 3), consistent with the TIRFM observation (Fig. 1G). Importantly, the bound fibrils are more flexible on the negatively charged surface, probably because of the charge repulsion. Formation of Senile Plaque-like Aβ Spherulitic Structures—Most importantly, the assemblies of Aβ-(1-40) fibrils observed in the present study resemble the amyloid core of senile plaques observed in the cerebral cortices of patients suffering from Alzheimer disease (5Jin L. Claborn K. Kurimoto M. Geday M. Maezawa I. Sohraby F. Estrada M. Kaminsky W. Kahr B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 15294-15298Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Similar spherical amyloid deposits are observed in a mouse model of Alzheimer disease (16Hsiao K. Chapman P. Nilsen S. Eckman C. Harigawa Y. Younkin S. Yang F. Cole G. Science. 1996; 274: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (3635) Google Scholar), in patients with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (17Manuelidis L. Fritch W. Xi Y.-G.

Biochem. 1997; 66: 385-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1403) Google Scholar). Furthermore, spherulites were observed in vitro in many systems including natural and synthetic polymers (see Ref. 30Krebs M.R.H. MacPhee C.E. Miller A.F. Dunlop I.E. Dobson C.M. Donald A.M. Proc.

Langmuir. 2004; 20: 924-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), and synthetic peptides (34Fezoui Y. Martley D.M. Walsh D.M. Selkoe D.J. Osterhout J.J. Teplow D.B.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1095-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), indicating that they are a common architectural feature of fibers. We consider that the senile plaque-like spherical objects observed here correspond to spherulites, a higher order spherical assembly of amyloid fibrils ranging in diameter from 10 to 150 μm. In a polarizing light microscope, spherulites exhibit a typical “Maltese-cross” extinction pattern (30Krebs M.R.H. MacPhee C.E. Miller A.F. Dunlop I.E. Dobson C.M. Donald A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 14420-14424Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In the present study, we did not examine the presence of Maltese-cross since we could not isolate the spherical objects to perform the measurements under cross-polarizers. Thus, additional studies are necessary to conclude that the observed amyloid assemblies are indeed spherulites. However, the similarity of the amyloid core of senile plaques and the spherulitic assemblies observed in the present study suggest that senile plaques in patients also develop through the cooperative growth and association of amyloid fibrils as visualized here, together with interactions between Aβ monomers/fibrils and various biological molecules. During concurrent fibril growth from clumped seeds, moderate repulsion between the fibrils may keep the growing ends separated and thus active. At the same time, moderate attraction between growing fibrils is presumably important to maintain the spherical shape. Thus, the formation of senile plaques is likely to be governed both by the physicochemical properties of Aβ amyloid fibrils per se and by the molecular environment in situ. Effects of Surface on the Fibril Formation—Our observations with TIRFM are consistent with various reports studying the effects of surface on fibril formation. In situ atomic force microscopy of the amyloidogenic immunoglobulin light chain variable domain SMA showed that negatively charged SMA formed fibrils on the negatively charged mica surface, whereas fibrils did not form on the positively charged or hydrophobic surfaces (15Zhu M. Souillac P.O. Ionescu-Zanetti C. Carter S.A. Fink A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50914-50922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). It has been reported that the formation of Aβ fibrils was facilitated by the negatively charged acidic phospholipids rather than neutral phospholipids (11Gellermann G.P. Appel T.R. Tannert A. Radestock A. Hortschansky P. Schroeckh V. Leisner C. Lütkepohl T. Shtrasburg S. Röcken C. Pras M. Linke R. Diekmann S. Fändrich M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 6297-6302Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). These reports also proposed that the strong electrostatic attractions tightly trap the seed fibrils on the surface so that the subsequent growth is inhibited. The inhibitory role of hydrophobic surface might be explained in a similar manner. Moreover, the slightly low efficiency of binding of amyloid precursors in the forms of monomers or seed fibrils to the hydrophobic surfaces might contribute to the suppressed fibril formation. Taken together, the effects of surface on the formation of Aβ-(1-40) fibrils can be classified into three types (Fig. 6). First, tight electrostatic attraction between negatively charged Aβ-(1-40) and a positively charged surface is unfavorable for efficient fibril growth (Fig. 6A). Tight hydrophobic interaction is also unfavorable. Tight interactions may mask the growing ends. Flexibility of the growing ends might also be required for fibril growth. Moreover, adsorption to the surface decreases the concentration of active monomers, thus inhibiting the growth. Second, even when the surface charge is moderately negative as in the case of quartz, Aβ-(1-40) with a net negative charge can bind to the surface through local electrostatic attraction and hydrophobic interaction. However, since the interaction is weaker, Aβ-(1-40) seeds expose their growing edge, ensuring efficient fibril growth (Fig. 6B). Weak binding of Aβ-(1-40) fibrils to quartz was evidenced by the transient disappearance of fibrils from evanescent fields monitored by TIRFM (19Ban T. Hoshino M. Takahashi S. Hamada D. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 344: 757-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Third and most interestingly, PEI/PVS with a strongly negative and hydrophilic surface produced a huge spherical object, a spherulitic structure (Fig. 6C). The real-time observation showed that the main body of fibril growth indeed takes place some distance from the surface (beyond the depth of penetration of the evanescent field) (Fig. 2). Thus, although overall observations point to a clear influence of solid surfaces on the formation of spherulitic structures, it remains unknown whether direct interactions with the surface are essential. One possibility is that increasing the local concentration of seed fibrils on the PEI/PVS surface, as revealed by the quartz crystal microbalance measurements, leads to the clustering of seeds. Then, the clustered seeds may detach from the surface, promoting the formation of spherulitic structures in solution. A similar effect has been suggested in the spontaneous formation of spherical aggregates of Aβ termed “β-amyl balls” (35Westlind-Danielsson A. Arnerup G. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14736-14743Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Once fibril growth started from the clustered seeds, the combination of intense growth and the delicate balance of repulsions and attractions enables the massive growth of fibrils in a radial pattern, producing a huge and harmonic object. Finally, we consider that the above models on the basis of the results with Aβ-(1-40) will be applicable to Aβ-(1-42), which is suggested to be the main component of senile amyloid plaques. Conclusion—The surface properties have crucial roles in both promoting and suppressing the fibril growth and interactions. By controlling the surface properties, we reproduced the senile-plaque-like spherulitic assemblies of Aβ-(1-40). The real-time images at the single fibrillar level revealed that a balance of attractive and repulsive interactions coupled with intense growth without branching produces a huge spherical object. On the other hand, on a quartz surface, intense growth led to remarkably long fibrils, implying similarity to the deposition on vascular basement membranes. These observations argue that the physicochemical properties of amyloid fibrils per se play a dominant role for the formation of senile plaques, as well as deposition on vascular basement membranes, giving insights into creating the strategies for preventing Alzheimer disease.

Stressed cells adapt to an insult by restraining growth, and conversely, growing cells keep stress responses at bay. This is evident in many physiological settings, including for example, the effect of stress on the immune or nervous system, but the underlying signaling mechanisms mediating such mutual antagonism are poorly understood. In eukaryotes, a central activator of cell growth is the protein kinase target of rapamycin (TOR) and its namesake signaling network. Calcineurin is a conserved, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase and target of the immunosuppressant FK506 (tacrolimus) that is activated in yeast during stress to promote cell survival. Here we show yeast mutants defective for TOR complex 2 (TORC2) or the essential homologous TORC2 effectors, SLM1 and SLM2, exhibited constitutive activation of calcineurin-dependent transcription and actin depolarization. Conversely, cells defective in calcineurin exhibited SLM1 hyperphosphorylation and enhanced interaction between TORC2 and SLM1. Furthermore, a mutant SLM1 protein (SLM1ΔC14) lacking a sequence related to the consensus calcineurin docking site (PxIxIT) was insensitive to calcineurin, and SLM1ΔC14 slm2 mutant cells were hypersensitive to oxidative stress. Thus, TORC2-SLM signaling negatively regulates calcineurin, and calcineurin negatively regulates TORC2-SLM. These findings provide a molecular basis for the mutual antagonism of growth and stress.

TOR5 is a serine/threonine kinase and a central controller of cell growth. TOR is found in two structurally and functionally distinct, evolutionarily conserved protein complexes, TORC1 and TORC2 (1Loewith R. Jacinto E. Wullschleger S. Lorberg A. Crespo J.L. Bonenfant D.

TORC1 is rapamycin-sensitive and controls several growth-related processes including transcription, translation, ribosome biogenesis, nutrient transport, and autophagy in response to nutrient, energy, and (in metazoans) growth factor signals (3Wullschleger S. Loewith R. Hall M.N. Cell. 2006; 124: 471-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4745) Google Scholar). TORC2 is rapamycin-insensitive and controls polarization of the actin cytoskeleton via a ROM2-RHO-PKC1-MPK1/SLT2 effector pathway (4Schmidt A. Bickle M. Beck T. Hall M.N.

In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, calcineurin promotes cell survival upon environmental stress (6Cyert M.S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2001; 35: 647-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In response to a stress-induced increase in cytoplasmic calcium, calcineurin dephosphorylates and activates several cytoplasmic targets. The calcineurin docking site in target proteins consists of the consensus sequence PxIxIT. The best characterized calcineurin target in yeast is the transcription factor CRZ1/TCN1/HAL8 (7Stathopoulos A.M. Cyert M.S.

Dephosphorylated CRZ1 translocates into the nucleus and activates target genes containing a calcineurin-dependent response element. These genes are involved mainly in ion homeostasis, vesicular transport, and cell wall maintenance. Independent of transcription, calcineurin also mediates stress-induced depolarization of the actin cytoskeleton and a delay in the G2–M transition of the cell cycle (10Mizunuma M. Hirata D. Miyahara K. Tsuchiya E. Miyakawa T. Nature. 1998; 392: 303-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 11Shitamukai A. Hirata D. Sonobe S. Miyakawa T. J. Biol.

Calcineurin is a heterodimer composed of a positive regulatory subunit (CNB1) and in S. cerevisiae, one of the redundant catalytic subunits CNA1 and CNA2. Cells respond to environmental stress by down-regulating energy demanding growth processes and up-regulating survival processes. How do cells counter-regulate growth and stress responses? A functional interaction between calcineurin and TOR has been suggested by a two-hybrid interaction between CNA (CNA1 or CNA2) and the TORC2 phosphorylation substrates SLM1 and SLM2 (12Uetz P. Giot L. Cagney G. Mansfield T.A. Judson R.S. Knight J.R. Lockshon D. Narayan V. Srinivasan M. Pochart P. Qureshi-Emili A. Li Y. Godwin B. Conover D. Kalbfleisch T. Vijayadamodar G. Yang M. Johnston M. Fields S. Rothberg J.M. Nature. 2000; 403: 623-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (3922) Google Scholar). The homologous SLM1 and SLM2 are redundant, essential proteins that control polarization of the actin cytoskeleton by an unknown mechanism (13Audhya A. Loewith R. Parsons A.B. Gao L. Tabuchi M.

Our findings provide a molecular mechanism for the mutual antagonism of growth-promoting and growth-inhibiting signaling pathways. Furthermore, we show that TORC2 controls transcription and has a pivotal role in the negative regulation of calcineurin-dependent stress signaling, in addition to controlling organization of the actin cytoskeleton. Strains, Plasmids, and Media—The S. cerevisiae strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1. All strains are isogenic derivatives of TB50 or JK9-3d. Medium (YPD/YPGal) was prepared as described previously (15Beck T. Hall M.N. Nature. 1999; 402: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar, 16Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2545) Google Scholar). YPD containing 0.2 m CaCl2 was prepared by adding the required volume of a 1 m stock of CaCl2 to 1.25-fold concentrated, autoclaved YPD. FK506 was added to a final concentration of 2 μg/ml from a 1 mg/ml stock in 90% ethanol-10% Tween 20. FK506 treatment was for 30 min. H2O2 was added from a 30% commercial solution (Fluka) to autoclaved YPD agar medium prior to solidification to a final concentration of 5 mm. For TOR2-, AVO3-, and SLM2-depletion experiments, YPGal cultures of logarithmically growing cells, conditionally expressing the corresponding genes from the GAL1 promoter, were inoculated into YPD medium and incubated with aeration for 15 (TOR2 or AVO3 depletion) or 6 h (SLM2 depletion). The long incubation times reflect the amount of time required to deplete the proteins in question (17Wullschleger S. Loewith R. Oppliger W. Hall M.N. J. Biol.

Two independent RNA preparations were used for each strain. Quantity and quality of total RNA were determined by capillary electrophoresis on a RNA6000 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). Synthesis of cDNA, in vitro transcription of biotin-labeled cRNA, microarray hybridization, washing, and staining procedures were carried out according to standard protocols as recommended by the manufacturer (Affymetrix). Data normalization was performed using the Robust Multi-array Analysis algorithm as implemented in GeneSpring 7.2 software. For Northern blot analysis, probe synthesis was performed by PCR using digoxygenin-modified dUTP, and subsequent Northern blot analysis was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (digoxygenin labeling and detection, Roche). Coimmunoprecipitation, TAP Purification, and Immunoblotting—Coimmunoprecipitations and the TAP pulldown assays were performed as described (17Wullschleger S. Loewith R. Oppliger W. Hall M.N. J. Biol.

Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody and ECL reagents were used for immunoblots (Amersham Biosciences). Proteins coprecipitating in TAP pulldowns were excised from a 5–20% gradient gel and identified by mass spectrometry as described (1Loewith R. Jacinto E. Wullschleger S. Lorberg A. Crespo J.L.

The slurry of IgG beads containing SLM1-TAP was washed with CP buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing protease inhibitors. The calcineurin reaction was performed in a total volume of 100 μl in CP buffer containing 500 units of recombinant human calcineurin (Calbiochem) and 2600 units of calmodulin (Sigma) as described (22Heath V.L.

Where indicated, CaCl2 and EGTA were added to a final concentration of 40 and 10 mm, respectively. Phosphatase reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. Phospho-SLM1-TAP and total SLM1-TAP were detected as described above. Microscopy—Florescence microscopy and indirect immunofluorescence imaging on whole fixed cells were performed as described (23Schmelzle T. Beck T. Martin D.E. Hall M.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 338-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). An anti-Myc (9E10) antibody was used to visualize CRZ1-Myc. Control experiments with wild type cells showed that the unspecific signal was negligible in our strain. For actin cytoskeleton or DNA staining, we used a modification of the method described in (1Loewith R. Jacinto E. Wullschleger S. Lorberg A. Crespo J.L. Bonenfant D. Oppliger W. Jenoe P. Hall M.N.

Cells from the indicated YPD cultures were fixed in formaldehyde (3.7%) and stained with tetramethyl rhodamine isothiocyanate-phalloidin (Sigma) to visualize actin or 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole to stain DNA and visualize nuclei. Actin cytoskeleton organization was assessed in several hundred cells as described (19Helliwell S.B. Howald I. Barbet N. Hall M.N. Genetics. 1998; 148: 99-112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TORC2 Negatively Controls Calcineurin-dependent Transcription—TORC2, because of its rapamycin insensitivity, is less well characterized than TORC1. To further investigate TORC2, we performed a genome-wide transcriptome analysis on an S. cerevisiae strain (SH121) containing the thermosensitive tor2–21 (tor2ts) allele (19Helliwell S.B. Howald I. Barbet N. Hall M.N. Genetics. 1998; 148: 99-112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This strain is defective for TORC2 but not for TORC1 (1Loewith R. Jacinto E. Wullschleger S. Lorberg A. Crespo J.L. Bonenfant D. Oppliger W. Jenoe P. Hall M.N. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 457-468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1484) Google Scholar, 17Wullschleger S. Loewith R. Oppliger W. Hall M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30697-30704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). At nonpermissive temperature, ∼90 genes were up-regulated (≥2-fold induction), and no genes were significantly down-regulated in the tor2ts mutant, compared with wild type (Fig. 1). This suggests that TORC2 controls transcription, mainly negatively. Further analysis revealed that ∼50% of the genes inhibited by TORC2 overlapped with a set of genes, the expression of which was dependent on calcineurin and CRZ1 (24Yoshimoto H. Saltsman K. Gasch A.P. Li H.X. Ogawa N. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Cyert M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31079-31088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The overlapping genes include those most dependent on calcineurin and CRZ1 for expression (≥5.5-fold induction upon calcineurin activation). These findings suggest that TORC2 inhibits calcineurin and CRZ1. To determine whether TORC2 indeed inhibits CRZ1, we examined CRZ1-dependent transcription directly in a tor2 mutant and in a mutant defective for the TORC2-specific subunit AVO3. Transcripts corresponding to the CRZ1 target genes CMK2, DIA1, YLR194c, and YOR385w were probed by Northern analysis in strains conditionally expressing TOR2 or AVO3 from the galactose-inducible and glucose-repressible GAL1 promoter. Strains conditionally expressing TOR2 or AVO3 were used, instead of strains containing a thermosensitive tor2 or avo3 allele, to avoid potential complications because of heat stress activation of CRZ1. The CRZ1 target genes were induced upon depletion of TOR2 or AVO3 and in the absence of any other stress (Fig. 2A; data not shown for YOR385w). The CRZ1 dependence of the examined transcripts was determined by deleting CRZ1 in the tor2 and avo3 strains (Fig. 2A). We also observed calcineurin-dependent response element (CDRE)-dependent expression of lacZ upon TOR2 or AVO3 depletion (data not shown). These experiments confirm the results of the transcriptome analysis with the tor2ts mutant and indicate that the expression changes observed with the tor2ts mutant are not necessarily because of heat stress. Thus, TORC2 inhibits CRZ1-dependent transcription under normal growth conditions, i.e. in the absence of stress. Calcineurin dephosphorylates CRZ1 and thereby triggers nuclear localization and activation of CRZ1 (25Stathopoulos-Gerontides A. Guo J.J. Cyert M.S. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 798-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). To investigate whether TORC2 regulates calcineurin, we examined CRZ1 localization in the tor2 and avo3 mutants by indirect immunofluorescence on whole fixed cells (Fig. 2B). In both tor2 and avo3 mutant cells, CRZ1 was exclusively (15–20% of cells) or mainly (45–50% of cells) nuclear, whereas in wild type cells CRZ1 was exclusively or mainly cytoplasmic. Thus, TORC2 inhibits nuclear accumulation of CRZ1. To investigate the calcineurin-dependence of CRZ1 nuclear localization in the tor2 and avo3 mutants, cells were treated with the calcineurin inhibitor FK506. A short treatment (30 min) with FK506 restored cytoplasmic localization of CRZ1 in tor2 and avo3 cells (Fig. 2B). Similar suppression of the CRZ1 localization defect was obtained upon deletion of CNB1 encoding the positive regulatory subunit of calcineurin (data not shown). Thus, CRZ1 nuclear localization in the tor2 and avo3 mutants was calcineurin-dependent. The above findings suggest that TORC2 negatively regulates calcineurin. However, these experiments do not distinguish whether the TORC2 inhibits calcineurin directly or indirectly. TORC2 Inhibits Calcineurin via the SLM Proteins—The observation that the TORC2 substrates SLM1 and SLM2 interact with the catalytic subunit of calcineurin (CNA1 or CNA2), as revealed by a genome-wide two-hybrid study (12Uetz P. Giot L. Cagney G. Mansfield T.A. Judson R.S. Knight J.R. Lockshon D. Narayan V. Srinivasan M. Pochart P. Qureshi-Emili A. Li Y. Godwin B. Conover D. Kalbfleisch T. Vijayadamodar G. Yang M. Johnston M. Fields S. Rothberg J.M. Nature. 2000; 403: 623-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (3922) Google Scholar), suggests that TORC2 inhibits calcineurin via the SLMs. To investigate this possibility, we examined CRZ1-dependent transcription and CRZ1 localization in a slm1 slm2 double mutant (slm1,2). Because the SLMs are essential, strains containing a SLM1 deletion and conditionally expressing SLM2 from the GAL1 promoter were used for these experiments. In a slm1,2 mutant, CRZ1 accumulated in the nucleus in a calcineurin-dependent (FK506 sensitive) manner and activated transcription of target genes (data not shown for YOR385w) even in the absence of stress (Fig. 2, C and D). In addition, inhibition of calcineurin by treatment with FK506 or by deletion of CNB1 suppressed the growth and actin defects of a slm1,2 mutant (Fig. 2, E and F). Thus, calcineurin appears to be constitutively active in a slm1,2 mutant, like in TORC2 mutants (tor2 and avo3) and the cause of lethality of a slm1,2 mutation. These observations suggest that TORC2 negatively regulates calcineurin via the SLMs. Furthermore, the suppression of the slm1,2 actin defect by CNB1 deletion or by FK506 treatment suggests that the SLMs mediate actin polarization via inhibition of calcineurin. Interestingly, inhibition of calcineurin did not suppress the lethality of a tor2 or avo3 mutation (data not shown). Furthermore, multicopy ROM2 or RHO2, strong suppressors of tor2 or avo3 lethality (1Loewith R. Jacinto E. Wullschleger S. Lorberg A. Crespo J.L. Bonenfant D. Oppliger W. Jenoe P. Hall M.N. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 457-468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1484) Google Scholar, 4Schmidt A. Bickle M. Beck T. Hall M.N. Cell. 1997; 88: 531-542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), failed to suppress either the growth defect or the CRZ1 nuclear localization phenotype of the slm1,2 mutant (data not shown) (14Fadri M. Daquinag A. Wang S. Xue T. Kunz J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 1883-1900Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Overexpression of ROM2 or RHO2 also failed to suppress the CRZ1 nuclear localization phenotype of the tor2 mutant (data not shown). These observations suggest that TORC2 signals via SLM-calcineurin and ROM2-RHO-PKC-MPK1/SLT2 separately. Calcineurin Antagonizes TORC2-SLM Signaling—TORC2 positively controls polarization of the actin cytoskeleton. In contrast, activation of calcineurin causes depolarization of the actin cytoskeleton (Fig. 2F and Fig. 3). Furthermore, calcineurin causes depolarization of the actin cytoskeleton independently of CRZ1 (Fig. 3). These observations suggest that calcineurin may antagonize the ability of TORC2 to signal via the SLMs. To address this suggestion, we first investigated whether calcineurin (CNA1) interacts with SLM1 as suggested previously by a genome-wide two-hybrid analysis (12Uetz P. Giot L. Cagney G. Mansfield T.A. Judson R.S. Knight J.R. Lockshon D. Narayan V. Srinivasan M. Pochart P. Qureshi-Emili A. Li Y. Godwin B. Conover D. Kalbfleisch T. Vijayadamodar G. Yang M. Johnston M. Fields S. Rothberg J.M. Nature. 2000; 403: 623-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (3922) Google Scholar). Our efforts to detect, by coimmunoprecipitation, an SLM1-CNA1 interaction in a wild type strain were unsuccessful. As this could be because of CNA1 dephosphorylating and thereby releasing SLM1, we then investigated an SLM1-CNA1 interaction under conditions in which calcineurin was inactive. Inhibition of calcineurin by a cnb1 mutation or by treatment of cells with FK506 indeed resulted in detection of an SLM1-CNA1 interaction (Fig. 4A) (data not shown for FK506). To study further the SLM1-CNA1 interaction, we examined whether SLM1 contained a PxIxIT calcineurin docking site. Although we did not detect a consensus PxIxIT sequence, a related sequence (PNIYIQ) was detected in the C-terminal 14 amino acids of SLM1 (PNIYIQ TPINDFKS). To determine whether this PxIxIT-related sequence is a calcineurin docking site, the C-terminal 14 amino acids of SLM1 were deleted, and the truncated protein (SLM1ΔC14) was assayed by coimmunoprecipitation for interaction with CNA1. SLM1ΔC14 failed to interact with CNA1 even upon inhibition of calcineurin (Fig. 4A), suggesting that the PxIxIT-related sequence in SLM1 was a calcineurin binding site. The SLM1ΔC14 mutant protein was functional other than in its ability to interact with CNA1 because a SLM1ΔC14 slm2 double mutant grew like a wild type strain under standard growth conditions, unlike the slm1 slm2 double mutant (slm1,2), which was nonviable (data not shown). The above findings indicate that calcineurin interacts directly with SLM1. Interestingly, the observation that SLM1ΔC14 is functional despite its inability to interact with calcineurin suggests that SLM1 has a function independent of its direct interaction with calcineurin.FIGURE 4SLM1 is a target of calcineurin. A, CNA1 and SLM1 interact in a calcineurin-sensitive manner. Cells expressing epitope-tagged CNA1 (CNA1-HA) (JM229), SLM1 (SLM1-Myc) (RL146-7d), co-expressing both tagged proteins (JM259 and JM491) or co-expressing epitope-tagged CNA1 with an epitope-tagged version of SLM1 (SLM1ΔC14) lacking the C-terminal 14 amino acids (SLM1ΔC14-Myc) (JM624), were grown to mid-logarithmic phase, harvested, lysed, and cell extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-HA (IP: CNA1). Immunoprecipitates were probed with anti-Myc to detect coimmunoprecipitated SLM1 protein (coIP: SLM1). CNA1 and SLM1 interact only in a cnb1 mutant. B, calcineurin dephosphorylates SLM1 in vivo. SLM1-TAP (RL209), SLM1-TAP cnb1 (JM333), SLM1ΔC14-TAP (JM597), and SLM1ΔC14-TAP cnb1 (JM712) cells were grown to mid-logarithmic phase and either mock-treated or treated with 200 mm CaCl2 for 10 min. Cells were harvested and subjected to protein extraction and TAP purification, SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotting. The immunoblotting was performed with an anti-TAP (protein A) antibody to detect total SLM1-TAP (SLM1) or SLM1ΔC14-TAP (SLM1ΔC14) or with a mixture of commercial antibodies against phosphorylated serine and phosphorylated threonine to detect phospho-SLM1-TAP (SLM1-pS/T) or phospho-SLM1ΔC14-TAP (SLM1ΔC14-pS/T) (see “Experimental Procedures”). C, calcineurin dephosphorylates phospho-SLM1 in vitro. Phospho-SLM1-TAP (SLM1-pS/T) was purified from cnb1 cells (JM333) and treated with recombinant calcineurin (plus calmodulin), CaCl2, and EGTA as indicated and described under “Experimental Procedures.” SLM1-pS/T and total SLM1-TAP (SLM1) were detected as described above.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We detected a physical interaction between SLM1 and the calcineurin catalytic subunit CNA1 but only in the absence of calcineurin activity (see above). The observation that only inactive CNA1 forms a stable complex with SLM1 suggests that calcineurin may dephosphorylate SLM1. To investigate whether calcineurin dephosphorylates SLM1, we examined the phosphorylation status of SLM1 and SLM1ΔC14 in wild type and cnb1 mutant cells, treated and untreated with calcium. Affinity (TAP)-tagged SLM1 and SLM1ΔC14 were purified and then probed with anti-phosphoSer/Thr antibody. SLM1 was hyperphosphorylated in the cnb1 mutant compared with in a wild type strain (Fig. 4B). SLM1ΔC14, consistent with its inability to interact with calcineurin, was hyperphosphorylated under all conditions examined (Fig. 4B). These findings suggest that calcineurin dephosphorylates SLM1 in vivo. Furthermore, recombinant calcineurin (plus calmodulin) dephosphorylated purified phospho-SLM1-TAP in vitro (Fig. 4C). This observation, combined with the previous observation that SLM1 physically interacts with calcineurin, suggests that calcineurin dephosphorylates SLM1 directly. To investigate the functional consequence of SLM1 hyperphosphoryation, we examined the interaction between SLM1 and TORC2 in wild type and cnb1 mutant cells. The TORC2-SLM interaction is weak (13Audhya A. Loewith R. Parsons A.B. Gao L. Tabuchi M. Zhou H. Boone C. Hall M.N. Emr S.D. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3747-3757Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 14Fadri M. Daquinag A. Wang S. Xue T. Kunz J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 1883-1900Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and undetectable in our experimental conditions, as assayed by coimmunoprecipitation of SLM1 with AVO3 or TOR2 (Fig. 5, A and B). Inhibition of calcineurin, upon introduction of a cnb1 mutation or treatment of cells with FK506, significantly enhanced the binding of SLM1 to both AVO3 and TOR2 (Fig. 5, A and B) (data not shown for FK506). Furthermore, the SLM1ΔC14 variant that was unable to bind calcineurin also exhibited enhanced binding to AVO3 and TOR2 (Fig. 5, A and B). Thus, calcineurin both dephosphorylates SLM1 and inhibits the TORC2-SLM1 interaction, suggesting that calcineurin antagonizes TORC2-SLM signaling. To investigate further the physiological significance of SLM1 phosphorylation, we performed a more extensive phenotypic analysis of the SLM1ΔC14 slm2 mutant, which grew like wild type under normal growth conditions. The SLM1ΔC14 slm2 mutant was exposed to various stress conditions, including heat (37 °C), cold (15 °C), osmotic (1.8 m sorbitol or 1 m NaCl), lithium (0.3 m), calcium (0.2 m CaCl2), and oxidative (5 mm H2O2) stress. The SLM1ΔC14 slm2 was hypersensitive specifically to oxidative stress, as evidenced by a growth defect only in the presence of H2O2 (Fig. 5C and data not shown). Thus, phosphorylated SLM1 prevents the cellular response to oxidative stress, suggesting that TORC2-SLM signaling inhibits the response to this stress. In other words, calcineurin inhibits the ability of TORC2-SLM signaling to keep the response to oxidative stress at bay. A crz1 mutation failed to confer hypersensitivity to oxidative stress, indicating that TORC2-SLM2 signaling inhibited the response to oxidative stress independently of CRZ1-dependent transcription. We have presented evidence that TORC2-SLM signaling inhibits calcineurin, and conversely, calcineurin inhibits TORC2-SLM signaling. According to this model (Fig. 6), TORC2 phosphorylated the SLM proteins (13Audhya A. Loewith R. Parsons A.B. Gao L. Tabuchi M. Zhou H. Boone C. Hall M.N. Emr S.D. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3747-3757Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 14Fadri M. Daquinag A. Wang S. Xue T. Kunz J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 1883-1900Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and thereby inhibited calcineurin and calcineurin-mediated events such as actin cytoskeleton depolarization and CRZ1-dependent transcription. Conversely, calcineurin dephosphorylates the SLMs and thereby inhibits TORC2-SLM signaling to the oxidative stress response and possibly other effectors. Thus, TORC2 and calcineurin are mutually antagonistic. The logic of this mutual antagonism may be the need to cope with the conflicting states of growth and stress. TORC2 prevents the calcineurin-activated stress response during favorable conditions, and conversely, calcineurin prevents TOR-mediated growth during stress. The inhibition of calcineurin by TORC2 also allows a cell to resume growth after a stress has been overcome. Finally, another noteworthy aspect of the model (Fig. 6), which is suggested by our finding that a cnb1 mutation suppresses the slm1,2 actin defect, is that the SLMs mediate actin cytoskeleton polarization via inhibition of calcineurin. The observation that the SLM1ΔC14 mutation has no effect on the actin cytoskeleton (data not shown) is further evidence for this notion. Although not shown in our model, the pleckstrin homology domain-containing SLM proteins also respond to the phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase MSS4 (13Audhya A. Loewith R. Parsons A.B. Gao L. Tabuchi M. Zhou H. Boone C. Hall M.N. Emr S.D. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3747-3757Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 14Fadri M. Daquinag A. Wang S. Xue T. Kunz J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 1883-1900Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Is the mutual antagonism of calcineurin and TORC2-SLM direct or indirect? The observations that calcineurin binds the SLMs, and that calcineurin dephosphorylates SLM1 in vivo and in vitro suggest that calcineurin inhibits TORC2-SLM signaling by acting on SLM directly. The mechanism of inhibition in the other direction by which TORC2-SLM inhibits calcineurin is less clear. It seems unlikely that TORC2-SLM inhibits calcineurin directly because SLM1 in the SLM1ΔC14 slm2 mutant is unable to bind calcineurin, and yet this mutant grows normally and is thus still able to inhibit calcineurin. Furthermore, the observation that the SLM1ΔC14 slm2 mutant responds normally to salt stress (i.e. calcineurin activation) suggests that SLM dephosphorylation by calcineurin is not required to activate calcineurin. How might TORC2-SLM inhibit calcineurin indirectly? We were unable to detect a change in the concentration of cytoplasmic calcium in tor2 and avo3 mutants, as assayed with a calcium-specific dye (Fluo-3 AM) (data not shown), suggesting that TORC2-SLM inhibits calcineurin by a mechanism other than the modulation of cytoplasmic calcium. Another possibility is that TORC2-SLM modulates the activity of the calcineurin regulator RCN1 (26Kingsbury T.J. Cunningham K.W. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1595-1604PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, RCN1 transcription is up-regulated in the tor2ts mutant at nonpermissive temperature (Fig. 1). The mechanism by which TORC2-SLM inhibits calcineurin remains to be determined. We present evidence that TORC2 inhibits calcineurin/CRZ1-dependent transcription and the oxidative stress response. Furthermore, TORC2 seems to control these two new readouts independently of the previously characterized RHO-PKC1-MPK1 effector pathway (Fig. 6). Although TORC1 has been known for some time to control several cellular processes via different effector pathways, TORC2 was thought to signal only to the actin cytoskeleton and only via the RHO-PKC-MPK1 pathway. TORC2, like TORC1, now appears to have multiple effectors and targets. The complexity of TORC2 signaling has been underestimated possibly because TORC2 is rapamycin-insensitive, and studies on TOR function have usually relied on rapamycin to inhibit TOR signaling. Interestingly, an important aspect of TORC1 signaling in both yeast and mammalian cells is the inhibition of type 2A and type 2A-related phosphatases (27Jacinto E. Hall M.N. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Our observations suggest that TORC2 also signals via inhibition of a phosphatase, in this case calcineurin. How does TORC2-SLM signaling inhibit the oxidative stress response? Yokoyama et al. (28Yokoyama H. Mizunuma M. Okamoto M. Yamamoto J. Hirata D. Miyakawa T. EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 519-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) have suggested that YAP1, a transcription factor mediating the oxidative stress response, is controlled by calcineurin. Thus, an appealing model is that TORC2-SLM signaling inhibits the oxidative stress response by inhibiting YAP1. In the absence of stress, SLM is phosphorylated and bound to TORC2 and could thereby serve as an adaptor presenting YAP1 to TORC2 for phosphorylation and inhibition. Alternatively, as YAP1 is regulated at the level of nuclear localization, phosphorylated SLM could simply bind and sequester YAP1. In response to stress, calcineurin dephosphorylates SLM and possibly YAP1, leading to activation of YAP1. Interestingly, at least three CRZ1-independent YAP1 target genes (CTT1, ARG4, and LAP4) are up-regulated in the tor2ts mutant at nonpermissive temperature (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/; accession number GSE1814). It is also interesting to note that TOR controls nuclear localization of several stress-related transcription factors, including GLN3, GAT1, MSN2/4, RTG1, RTG3, and as shown here, CRZ1 (15Beck T.

Does mTOR inhibit calcineurin in mammalian cells? mTOR promotes skeletal myotube hypertrophy in response to insulin-like growth factor-1, and this effect is enhanced by the calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporin A (31Rommel C.

Furthermore, mTORC2 mediates actin polymerization in mammalian cells (32Jacinto E. Loewith R. Schmidt A. Lin S. Ruegg M.A. Hall A. Hall M.N. Nat.

J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 9835-9844Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, mTORC2 may inhibit calcineurin also in mammalian cells. mTORC2 signaling, which like TORC2 signaling in yeast is rapamycin-insensitive, probably has a broader role in the control of cell growth than commonly appreciated.

https://openalex.org/W1973171515,"Stat5 and Stat3, two members of the Stat (signal transducer and activator of transcription) family, are known to play critical roles in mammopoiesis/lactogenesis and involution, respectively, in the mammary gland. Phosphotyrosine phosphatase Shp2 has been shown to dephosphorylate and thus inactivate both Stat5 and Stat3 in vitro. Paradoxically, cell culture studies also suggest a positive role of Shp2 in promoting prolactin-stimulated Stat5 activation. We have shown here that selective deletion of Shp2 in mouse mammary glands suppresses Stat5 activity during pregnancy and lactation, resulting in significant impairment of lobulo-alveolar outgrowth and lactation. In contrast, Stat3 activity was slightly up-regulated shortly before/at involution, leading to normal epithelial cell apoptosis/involution in Shp2-deficient mammary gland. Thus, Shp2 acts to promote Stat5 activation by the JAK2·prolactin receptor complex, while negatively modulating Stat3 activity before the onset of involution. This is the first demonstration that Shp2 manipulates Stat5 and Stat3 activities reciprocally in mammary epithelial cells, providing novel insight into the complex mechanisms for regulation of various Stat family members by a cytoplasmic tyrosine phosphatase.

Unlike most other organs, mammary gland develops primarily in postnatal life, when it undergoes mammogenesis, lactogenesis, and involution. A critical feature of the mammary gland is its ability to produce and secret milk to nourish newborns upon successive cycles of lactation and involution with each pregnancy. During each cycle, epithelial tissue in mammary glands undergoes rapid and drastic changes of regeneration and remodeling. These processes are programmed by a complicated set of mammogenic hormones, including estrogen, progesterone and prolactin (1Hennighausen L. Robinson G.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 2Hennighausen L. Robinson G.W. Dev.

Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 426-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In particular, prolactin has been shown to play a crucial role in stimulating the mammary epithelium to fully differentiate and lactate (4Hennighausen L. Robinson G.W. Wagner K.U. Liu W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7567-7569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). However, intracellular signaling mechanisms directing the developmental program in mammary glands are not fully understood. Members of the Stat (signal transducer and activator of transcription) family mediate cellular responses to cytokines and hormones as well as other extracellular stimuli in a variety of cell types (5Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (4912) Google Scholar, 6Ihle J.N. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). In particular, it has been documented that different Stat family members function at distinct stages during mammary gland development (7Chapman R.S. Lourenco P.C. Tonner E. Flint D.J. Selbert S.

Stat5 activity is dramatically increased during pregnancy and lactation but then is rapidly decreased after initiation of involution (8Groner B. Hennighausen L. Breast Cancer Res. 2000; 2: 149-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Consistently, Stat5a knock-out mice exhibit defective lobulo-alveolar outgrowth during pregnancy and fail to lactate after parturition (9Miyoshi K. Shillingford J.M. Smith G.H. Grimm S.L. Wagner K.U. Oka T. Rosen J.M. Robinson G.W. Hennighausen L. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 531-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). By contrast, Stat3 activity is up-regulated at the initiation of involution, and targeted deletion of Stat3 in the mammary gland suppresses epithelial apoptosis, resulting in delayed involution (7Chapman R.S.

Raz R. Levy D. Hennighausen L. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 3641-3650Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Shp2 is a widely expressed protein-tyrosine phosphatase containing two amino-terminal Src homology 2 domains and a single catalytic domain (12Lai L.A. Zhao C. Zhang E.E. Feng G.S. Arino J. Alexander D. Protein Phosphatases. Springer-Verlag, Berlin Heidelberg, Germany2003: 275-299Google Scholar, 13Neel B.G. Gu H. Pao L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 284-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). Shp2 has been shown to negatively regulate Stat family proteins, including Stat1, -3, and -5, in different cell types in vitro apparently through direct dephosphorylation of tyrosine-phosphorylated Stats and/or down-regulation of the upstream JAK family kinase activity (14You M.

Paradoxically, there are also reports suggesting that Shp2 promotes prolactin-stimulated Stat5 activation as well as up-regulation of Stat5 target gene expression in cell culture (19Berchtold S. Volarevic S. Moriggl R. Mercep M. Groner B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 556-567Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Ali S. Chen Z. Lebrun J.J. Vogel W. Kharitonenkov A. Kelly P.A. Ullrich A.

Thus, it remains to be determined how Shp2 regulates prolactin-stimulated Stat5 activity in mammary gland development and function in vivo. To address this issue, we have created a novel mouse model with Shp2 selectively deleted in the mammary gland. This work not only demonstrates unequivocally a positive role for Shp2 in Stat5 activation by prolactin but also unexpectedly reveals reciprocal action of Shp2 on Stat5 and Stat3 proteins in a single cell type in mammals. Generation and Phenotypic Analyses of Mutant Mice—A conditional mutant allele of Shp2 (Shp2flox or Shp2F) was generated in mice using the Cre-loxP system by inserting two loxP sites into introns flanking exon 4, as described previously (16Zhang E.E. Chapeau E. Hagihara K. Feng G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 16064-16069Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Mammary gland-specific Shp2 knock-out mice were generated by crossing Shp2F/F mice with MMTV-Cre transgenic mice (22Andrechek E.R. Hardy W.R. Siegel P.M. Rudnicki M.A. Cardiff R.D. Muller W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3444-3449Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). PCR genotyping strategies for the wild-type (Shp2+), Shp2F, and Shp2- alleles as well as the Cre transgene were described previously (16Zhang E.E. Chapeau E. Hagihara K. Feng G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 16064-16069Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Mice were housed and bred in compliance with the NIH guidelines and the Burnham Institute Animal Research Committee. Mammary gland tissues were surgically removed, frozen for biochemical analysis, or fixed for histological examination. Adult female mice (6 weeks-6 months) were set up for multiple mating. Litter size from the second time of breeding was counted at weaning, as the mother often ate some pups at the first litter. Only pups from litters of six or more were weighed to assess growth rate. Whole Mount and Immunohistochemical Staining—The entire inguinal mammary gland (fourth at right side) was excised and fully spread onto glass slides and then fixed in Carnoy's fixative solution overnight. Tissue preparations were immersed in 70% ethanol for 15 min and changed slowly to distilled water and then stained in carmine alum overnight. Tissue samples were then dehydrated through serial ethanol solutions and cleared in xylene. Finally, the mammary gland was mounted with Permount. For immunohistochemical staining, embedded tissue sections were deparaffinized through serial ethanol solutions and rinsed in distilled water. Sections were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, blocked in 1% goat serum for 30 min, and then incubated at 37 °C for 4 h or 4 °C overnight with primary antibodies at a dilution of 1:600 for Shp2 (C-18, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 1:300 for β-casein (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 1:200 for E-cadherin (BD Transduction Laboratories), 1:200 for NPT2b (Alpha Diagnostic), 1:300 for β-actin (Sigma), and 1:500 for phosphorylated Stat5a/b (Cell Signaling Technology). Antibodies for Stat3 and JAK2 were also purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. For apoptosis assay, embedded tissue sections from involuting two-day mammary glands were deparaffinized and analyzed by TUNEL 4The abbreviations used are: TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling; H&E, hematoxylin and eosin. assay (ApoAlert DNA fragmentation assay, BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Biochemical Analysis—For in vivo stimulation, mice at pregnancy day 18 were injected intraperitoneally with prolactin from the National Hormone and Peptide Program (Torrance, CA) at 5 μg/g of body weight. Injection of saline solution served as a negative control. After 30 min, inguinal mammary glands were collected for immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation assay. For in vitro stimulation, mammary gland from pregnancy day 18 females were removed and chopped into small pieces in phosphate-buffered saline buffer. Tissues were then starved in F-12 medium (Invitrogen) for 30 min and stimulated with prolactin (100 μg/ml). Generation of Mice with Selective Deletion of Shp2 in the Mammary Gland—In previous work, we created a conditional Shp2 knock-out allele (Shp2flox or Shp2F) using the Cre-loxP system (16Zhang E.E. Chapeau E. Hagihara K. Feng G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 16064-16069Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), which allows for selective deletion of Shp2 in a specific cell type or tissue. Mice deficient for Shp2 expression in the mammary gland (Shp2F/F::MMTV-Cre/+ or Shp2M-/-) were generated by breeding Shp2F/F mice with MMTV-Cre transgenic mice (22Andrechek E.R. Hardy W.R. Siegel P.M. Rudnicki M.A. Cardiff R.D. Muller W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3444-3449Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, PCR analysis using three pairs of primers detected the Cre transgene, the Shp2 floxed (Shp2F), and wild-type (Shp2+) alleles in tail genomic DNA. In homozygous mutant (Shp2M-/-) mice, targeted DNA excision at the Shp2F locus was detected in the mammary gland by allele-specific PCR analysis of genomic DNA isolated from various tissues and organs (Fig. 1B). Consistently, immunoblotting analysis demonstrated decreased Shp2 protein levels selectively in the mammary gland but not in other organs, compared with controls (Fig. 1C). Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that Shp2 was highly expressed in luminal epithelial cells in control animals (Shp2F/F), whereas Shp2 expression levels were dramatically decreased in Shp2M-/- mammary glands (Fig. 1D). The decrease in Shp2 expression occurred progressively with mammogenesis and lactogenesis (Fig. 1E), suggesting that the Cre expression driven by the MMTV-LTR promoter is up-regulated by mammogenic hormones during pregnancy and lactation, as reported previously (23Wagner K.U. McAllister K. Ward T. Davis B. Wiseman R. Hennighausen L. Transgenic Res. 2001; 10: 545-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 24Li G. Robinson G.W. Lesche R. Martinez-Diaz H. Jiang Z. Rozengurt N. Wagner K.U. Wu D.C. Lane T.F. Liu X. Hennighausen L. Wu H. Development. 2002; 129: 4159-4170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Shp2 expression levels were appreciably decreased in the mammary gland of Shp2M-/- mice in virgins and in lactation and involution. There were no general developmental defects and health problems observed in Shp2M-/- mice. Impaired Lobulo-alveolar Outgrowth in Shp2-deficient Mammary Gland—Whole mount and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining were performed to analyze the role of Shp2 in mammary development (Fig. 2, A and B). There were no significantly defective structures seen at early stages of mammary gland development in virgin animals. Both control and mutant female mammary glands reached puberty around 4-6 weeks and remained mature but inactive until pregnancy. Mammary glands in Shp2M-/- mice displayed normal branched ductal structures and terminal end buds. During pregnancy, the mammary gland epithelium undergoes rapid morphogenesis. In response to various hormones, terminal end buds fully differentiate to form lobulo-alveolar structures where milk is synthesized and secreted. Compared with control littermates, Shp2M-/- mice exhibited significantly delayed and impaired morphogenesis and remodeling during pregnancy and lactation (Fig. 2C). The lobulo-alveolar structures in Shp2-deficient mammary glands were incompletely developed, resulting in highly decreased numbers of luminal cells during lactation. Whole mount staining further demonstrated that, in mutant females, some undifferentiated end bud-like structures persisted at lactation day 2 (Fig. 2D). Reduced Milk Production—Toward the end of pregnancy, lobule-alveoli differentiated from end buds are fully expanded and predominate throughout the whole gland. Following parturition, this functional architecture becomes highly active and manufactures a large volume of milk. Notably, milk secretion was significantly decreased in Shp2M-/- females during lactation, consistent with impaired mammopoiesis during pregnancy. β- and γ-casein are unique lactic proteins that constitute 80% of the total milk proteins. Paired comparison of casein expression between control and mutant animals was performed for mammary tissue extracts at virgin, pregnancy, lactation, and involution stages. As shown in Fig. 1E, expression levels of β-casein were much lower in mutants than in controls during late pregnancy and lactation. Consistently, comparative analysis of several pairs of control and mutant littermates indicated that the amounts of secreted milk in mutant mice were decreased to variable extents (Fig. 3A). β-casein expression levels in mutants were highly correlated with the extent of structural defects in lobule-alveoli as revealed by H&E staining (Fig. 3B). With the unique morphological changes, the ratio of luminal cells to adipocytes changes dramatically in lactating mammary glands, which correlates well with milk production capacity. As shown in Fig. 3C, consistent with impaired milk secretion and defective morphological architecture, significant reduction in the number of luminal cells was observed in Shp2M-/- mammary glands at lactation day 2 (controls, 136.6 ± 9.64 cells/mm2; mutants, 63.4 ± 12.09; p < 0.01; n = 15-39). Conversely, an increased number of adipocytes was observed in mutant mammary gland tissue compared with controls (mutants, 189.7 ± 10.9; controls, 82.3 ± 5.15). Reduced milk secretion in Shp2-deficient mammary glands was also confirmed by immunohistochemical staining for NaPi-type IIb cotransporter (NPT2b) and a marker of lactation, casein (Fig. 3D). NPT2b is a secretion-associated apical protein produced at high levels during late pregnancy and lactation but undetectable in virgins and at involution (9Miyoshi K. Shillingford J.M. Smith G.H. Grimm S.L. Wagner K.U. Oka T. Rosen J.M. Robinson G.W. Hennighausen L. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 531-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). NPT2b was not expressed in ductal cells, although its expression correlates with epithelial differentiation to a secretory function, which correlates with defective milk secretion. Notably, impaired milk production in lactating Shp2M-/- females decreased the growth rate and viability of their pups (Fig. 3, E and F). Litter size or pup viability from mutant females appeared slightly reduced at both day 0 and weaning day (controls, 98.2 ± 1.02%; mutants, 88.1 ± 3.97%; p = 0.09; n = 12-16). To evaluate growth rate, newborn animals were weighed at postnatal days 2, 6, and 10 and at 4 weeks for 5-8 independent litters, and significant differences were observed during early developmental stages (Fig. 3F). Normal Involution and Epithelial Apoptosis in Shp2M-/- Mice—To determine the effect of Shp2 deletion on involution and epithelial cell apoptosis, pups were removed from their mothers to forcibly terminate lactation at day 10 of lactation (also designated day 0 of involution). Milk accumulated at similar high levels in both control and mutant animals at day 2 of forced involution and then was abruptly reduced at day 4, as assessed by the β-casein levels (Fig. 1E). This result suggests that the Shp2-deficient mammary gland can effectively regress to a resting state through alveolar cell apoptosis. The normal remodeling process in Shp2M-/- mice was also witnessed by whole mount and H&E staining (Fig. 2, A and B). Consistently, there was no significant difference in cell apoptosis rates between control and mutant mammary glands measured by TUNEL assay on days 2 and 4 of involution (Fig. 4). Bidirectional Regulation of Stat5 and Stat3 Activities by Shp2—To dissect the mechanism of Shp2 function in mammary glands, we evaluated the activation status of Stat5 and Stat3, which are strongly implicated in mammopoiesis/lactation and involution, respectively. Phospho-Stat5 levels were low in virgin mammary glands, rose dramatically during lactation, and rapidly declined following involution in control animals (Fig. 5A). Notably, both Stat5 protein contents and phospho-Stat5 levels were significantly lower in Shp2M-/- mice than in control animals during lactation, consistent with impaired lactogenesis illustrated in Fig. 3. When normalized against Stat5 protein levels, phospho-Stat5 signals were decreased during lactation in mutants compared with controls (Fig. 5B). Thus, Shp2 is positively required for Stat5 activation during pregnancy and lactation. In agreement with the literature (25Liu X. Robinson G.W. Hennighausen L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1496-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 26Philp J.A. Burdon T.G. Watson C.J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 396: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), phospho-Stat3 levels were high in the resting mammary gland (virgin), decreased during pregnancy/lactation, and returned to high levels before/at the onset of involution (Fig. 5A). In contrast to the phospho-Stat5 signal change, phospho-Stat3 levels were elevated in Shp2-deficient mammary glands compared with controls in virgin animals and at the late stage of lactation or before the onset of involution. Strikingly, targeted deletion of Shp2 in the mammary gland resulted in opposite effects on Stat5 and Stat3 activities, when examined on lactation day 10. As compared with the control, the phospho-Stat5 signal was decreased, while the phospho-Stat3 level was increased in the mutant (Fig. 5A). We also evaluated the activation status of ERK by monitoring the phospho-ERK1/2 levels. Compared with controls, phospho-ERK levels were modestly decreased in mutants during virgin and involution states, and phospho-ERK signals were undetectable during lactation (Fig. 5A), consistent with observations in other cell types that Shp2 acts to promote signaling through the ERK pathway (12Lai L.A. Zhao C. Zhang E.E. Feng G.S. Arino J. Alexander D. Protein Phosphatases. Springer-Verlag, Berlin Heidelberg, Germany2003: 275-299Google Scholar, 13Neel B.G. Gu H. Pao L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 284-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). Previous experiments have shown that prolactin expression rises during late pregnancy and throughout lactation and falls rapidly during involution and that prolactin promotes maturation of epithelial lumen and stimulates milk secretion by activating the Stat5 pathway (2Hennighausen L. Robinson G.W. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 467-475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). To define a physiological role for Shp2 in prolactin action, late pregnant mice were injected intraperitoneally with prolactin and mammary lysates prepared. Co-immunoprecipitation assay with anti-prolactin receptor (PrlR) and anti-JAK2 antibodies showed that, upon prolactin treatment, the PrlR rapidly recruited JAK2 and Shp2 to form a PrlR·JAK2·Shp2 complex (Fig. 5C). Notably, in Shp2-deficient mammary tissue lysates, prolactin-stimulated association of JAK2 with PrlR was impaired, suggesting a role for Shp2 in promoting assembly of a JAK2·PrlR complex essential for Stat5 activation. Consistently, previous in vitro experiments demonstrated that formation of a trimetric complex is indispensable for transmission of lactogenic signals (20Ali S. Chen Z. Lebrun J.J. Vogel W. Kharitonenkov A. Kelly P.A. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis further, we treated the isolated mammary tissues with prolactin or saline in vitro for 20 min and examined phospho-Stat5 and -Stat3 levels (Fig. 5D). Compared with controls, Shp2-deficient mammary tissue exhibited appreciably lower phospho-Stat5 signals following prolactin stimulation in vitro. Together, our physiological and biochemical data in vivo and in vitro argue strongly that Shp2 is positively required for prolactin-stimulated Stat5 activity in mammopoiesis and lactogenesis. We have demonstrated here a positive role of Shp2 in mammopoiesis and lactogenesis but not in involution through generating a mutant mouse model with targeted deletion of Shp2 in the mammary gland. More importantly, we have shown that Shp2 has opposite roles in modulating the activities of two Stat family members, Stat5 and Stat3, which function at different developmental stages of the mammary gland. Shp2 has a positive role in promoting prolactin-stimulated Stat5 activation during pregnancy/lactation, while acting as a negative regulator of Stat3. Thus, this work reveals that Shp2 acts not only as a negative regulator of signaling pathways mediated by various Stats, as generally accepted but also functions as a positive one in some cases. Notably, the increase in Stat5 expression during mammopoiesis was also down-regulated in Shp2M-/- mice, which could be due to a positive role of Shp2 in inducing Stat5 expression or alternatively could be secondary to the impaired development of the lobulo-alveolar outgrowth and therefore the epithelial tissue mass in the architecture. Defective lactation in Shp2M-/- mice is likely caused by the combined direct effect of Shp2 deletion on Stat5 activation by prolactin and impaired lobulo-alveolar structures. Several groups have shown previously that Shp2 dephosphorylates and therefore negatively regulates Stat1, -2, -3, and -5 activities in vitro (14You M. Yu D.H. Feng G.S. Mol. Cell.

Shp2 (but not its close relative Shp1) directly dephosphorylates tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat5 in vitro (17Chen Y. Wen R. Yang S. Schuman J. Zhang E.E. Yi T. Feng G.S. Wang D. J. Biol.

Shp2-deficient mouse embryonic stem cells displayed defective differentiation and more efficient self-renewal in vitro at least in part due to increased Stat3 activity induced by leukemia inhibitory factor (27Chan R.J.

Development. 2003; 130: 3459-3468Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) have demonstrated a non-redundant role of leukemia inhibitory factor in inducing Stat3 activity essential for epithelial apoptosis during involution in mammary gland. Consistently, we found that, in Shp2-deficient mammary gland, Stat3 activity was up-regulated shortly before the initiation of involution as compared with controls. In contrast, we observed that deletion of Shp2 resulted in down-regulation of prolactin-induced Stat5 activation during mammopoiesis and lactation, which argues for a positive role of Shp2 in modulating Stat5 activity. This observation seems at odds with the dephosphorylation effect of Shp2 on Stat5 observed in vitro by several groups including us (17Chen Y. Wen R. Yang S. Schuman J. Zhang E.E. Yi T. Feng G.S.

However, this in vivo data is consistent with previous experiments showing that Shp2 promotes prolactin-stimulated Stat5 activity in a reporter assay in cell culture (20Ali S. Chen Z. Lebrun J.J.

JAK2 is associated with PrlR and is activated upon prolactin stimulation, which in turn phosphorylates Stat5, leading to its activation and translocation into the nucleus, where Stat5 acts as a transcription activator. Recent in vitro experimental results suggest that Shp2 can dephosphorylate a phosphotyrosyl site (Tyr-1007) on JAK2, thereby preventing JAK2 association with Socs1, a negative regulator of the prolactin response during lactation (30Ali S.

By binding to JAK2 via p-Tyr-1007, Socs1 targets JAK2 to an ubiquitin-dependent degradation pathway, thus regulating protein stability (30Ali S. Nouhi Z. Chughtai N. J. Biol.

Biol. 2002; 22: 3316-3326Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Consistent with a previous in vitro observation, our experiments showed that in Shp2-deficient mammary lysates, the amount of JAK2 associated with PrlR was decreased following prolactin stimulation, leading to impaired Stat5 activation by prolactin. To our knowledge, this is the first physiological data showing a positive role of Shp2 in regulating the activity of a Stat family member. It is important to note that the data shown here does not rule out the possibility that Shp2 subsequently has a negative effect in dephosphorylating Stat5, leading to down-regulation of the active Stat5 signal. It is likely that Shp2 has dual functions in regulating Stat5 activity in the mammary gland, first acting as a positive regulator for the activation of Stat5 by prolactin and then as a negative effector in dephosphorylation/down-regulation of the activated Stat5 pathway. As the positive role of Shp2 precedes its negative effect on Stat5 activity, we observed defective mammopoiesis/lactation in Shp2M-/- mice. A similar positive and then negative effect of CD45 tyrosine phosphatase in regulation of lymphocyte activation has been documented (34Huntington N.D. Tarlinton D.M. Immunol. Lett. 2004; 94: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this work does not rule out the possibility that Shp2 acts primarily as a negative regulator of Stat5 activity in other cell types. In this regard, the cell type-specific or inducible gene deletion of Shp2 in mice will prove to be a powerful experimental approach to elucidating the mechanisms underlying the control of signaling specificity in vivo.

To prevent constitutive SFK activation, the catalytic activity of SFKs in normal mammalian cells is suppressed mainly by two inhibitors called C-terminal Src kinase (CSK) and CSK-homologous kinase (CHK), which inactivate SFKs by phosphorylating a consensus tyrosine near the C terminus of SFKs (YT). The phosphorylated YT intramolecularly binds to the SH2 domain of SFKs. This interaction, known as pYT/SH2 interaction, together with binding between the SH2 kinase linker and the SH3 domain of SFKs (linker/SH3 interaction) stabilizes SFKs in a “closed” inactive conformation. We previously discovered an alternative mechanism CHK employs to inhibit SFKs. This mechanism, referred to as the non-catalytic inhibitory mechanism, involves tight binding of CHK to SFKs; the binding alone is sufficient to inhibit SFKs. Herein, we constructed multiple active conformations of an SFK member, Hck, by systematically disrupting the two inhibitory interactions. We found that CHK employs the non-catalytic mechanism to inactivate these active conformations of Hck. However, CHK does not bind Hck when it adopts the inactive conformation in which both inhibitory interactions are intact. These data indicate that binding of CHK to SFKs via the non-catalytic mechanism is governed by the conformations of SFKs. Although CSK is also an inhibitor of SFKs, it does not inhibit SFKs by a similar non-catalytic mechanism.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5620-5635Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Aberrant regulation of the SFK activity is associated with malignant transformation of healthy cells (see Refs. 3Irby R.B. Yeatman T.J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5636-5642Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar and 4Frame M.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1602: 114-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, for review). In light of the oncogenic potential of SFKs, it is vital that their basal activity is kept low. The major inhibitory mechanism that suppresses SFK activity is contingent upon phosphorylation of a consensus tyrosine in the C-terminal tail of SFKs (YT). Upon YT phosphorylation, SFKs tend to adopt a “closed” inactive conformation in which the catalytically critical residues are not properly aligned for productive substrate phosphorylation. Although YT phosphorylation is generally associated with SFK inhibition, there exist several active conformations of SFKs in which their YT is phosphorylated (5Chong Y.P. Ia K.K. Mulhern T.D. Cheng H.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1754: 210-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In this article, we demonstrate that the CSK-homologous kinase (CHK) is a unique inhibitor capable of inhibiting these and other active conformations of SFKs regardless of their YT phosphorylation status. C-terminal Src kinase (CSK) and CHK are two principal endogenous negative regulators of SFKs that inactivate SFKs by phosphorylating their YT (see Refs. 5Chong Y.P. Ia K.K. Mulhern T.D. Cheng H.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1754: 210-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar and 6Cheng H.C. Chong Y.P. Ia K.K. Tan O. Mulhern T.D. AfCS-Nature Molecule Pages. 2006; 10.1038/mp.a000705.01Google Scholar for review). As revealed by crystal structures of the YT-phosphorylated forms of two SFK members c-Src and Hck, the inactive SFKs adopt a closed conformation stabilized by two major intramolecular inhibitory interactions (7Xu W. Harrison S.C. Eck M.J. Nature. 1997; 385: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar, 8Sicheri F. Moarefi I. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1997; 385: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar): (i) binding of the phosphorylated YT to the SH2 domain (referred to as the pYT/SH2 interaction), and (ii) binding of a polyproline type II helical motif in the SH2-kinase linker to the SH3 domain (referred to as the linker/SH3 interaction). In mammalian cells, activation of SFKs is accomplished by multiple mechanisms that disrupt one or both inhibitory interactions (see Refs. 9Miller W.T. Acc. Chem. Res. 2003; 36: 393-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar and 10Lerner E.C. Trible R.P. Schiavone A.P. Hochrein J.M. Engen J.R. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 40832-40837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar for review). For instance, Hck is activated by the accessory protein Nef of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), which binds to the SH3 domain, and in turn disrupts the linker/SH3 interaction of Hck (11Saksela K. Cheng G. Baltimore D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 484-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). There is evidence documenting that disruption of the linker/SH3 interaction alone is sufficient to induce Hck activation, whereas the pYT/SH2 interaction remains intact (12Lerner E.C. Smithgall T.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 365-369PubMed Google Scholar, 13Porter M. Schindler T. Kuriyan J. Miller W.T. J. Biol.

Other examples of ligands capable of activating SFKs by perturbing the linker/SH3 interaction in vivo are p130Cas (14Pellicena P. Miller W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28190-28196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and the progesterone receptor (15Boonyaratanakornkit V. Scott M.P. Ribon V. Sherman L. Anderson S.M.

In addition, disruption of the pYT/SH2 interaction alone can also activate SFKs (12Lerner E.C. Smithgall T.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 365-369PubMed Google Scholar). The pYEEI phosphopeptide from the polyoma virus middle T antigen is a high affinity SH2 ligand shown to activate Hck by directly displacing the engagement of pYT from the SH2 domain (13Porter M.

Focal adhesion kinase and a p130Cas-related protein Sin are ligands with dual functions, they activate c-Src by simultaneously disrupting the linker/SH3 and pYT/SH2 interactions (18Thomas J.W.

Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1341-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of YT appears to be a prerequisite for SFKs to adopt the closed inactive conformation. However, there exist multiple endogenous activators that simply activate SFKs by perturbing the linker/SH3 and/or pYT/SH2 interactions without affecting the YT phosphorylation status. This suggests that phosphorylation of YT alone is insufficient to restrain SFK activity at the basal level (see Ref. 5Chong Y.P. Ia K.K. Mulhern T.D. Cheng H.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1754: 210-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar for review). Thus, in addition to phosphorylation of YT by CSK and CHK, inhibitors capable of down-regulating SFK activity by YT-independent mechanisms are required (see Ref. 5Chong Y.P. Ia K.K. Mulhern T.D. Cheng H.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1754: 210-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar for review). Previously, we reported that CHK can inactivate SFKs in vitro and in cells by a non-catalytic mechanism that does not involve YT phosphorylation. Instead, this mechanism is mediated through direct binding of CHK to SFKs to form stable protein complexes (20Chong Y.P. Mulhern T.D. Zhu H.J. Fujita D.J. Bjorge J.D. Tantiongco J.P. Sotirellis N. Lio D.S. Scholz G. Cheng H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20752-20766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The binding is independent of YT phosphorylation by CHK and therefore is referred to as non-catalytic binding. This CHK-SFK non-catalytic binding alone is sufficient to suppress the activity and concomitant autophosphorylation of SFKs. To establish the physiological relevance of our findings, we provided evidence in our previous report that in rat brain cells, (i) CHK and c-Src co-localize in specific membrane microdomains and (ii) CHK and c-Src form a stable protein complex. These two pieces of evidence support the notion that co-localization of CHK and c-Src can significantly increase their effective concentrations in specific membrane microdomains and in turn facilitates their binding to form the stable CHK·c-Src complex. Presumably, CHK binding suppresses the activity of c-Src in the complex. There are two important outstanding questions arising from our previous findings. (i) Can CHK employ this non-catalytic mechanism to inhibit all active conformations of SFKs? (ii) Can CHK bind to the inactive conformation of SFKs? In this study, we employed the SFK member Hck as a model and constructed multiple active conformations of Hck by systematically disrupting the linker/SH3 and pYT/SH2 inhibitory interactions. We observed that CHK binds to and inhibits these active conformations of Hck. However, it does not bind to Hck in the inactive conformation of which both inhibitory interactions are intact. These data suggest that the conformation of SFKs plays a crucial role in governing the non-catalytic CHK-SFK binding and inhibition. Because CSK is another endogenous inhibitor of SFKs (see Ref. 21Chong Y.-P. Mulhern T.D. Cheng H.-C. Growth Factors. 2005; 23: 233-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar for review), we also examined whether it possesses the ability to inactivate SFKs by a similar non-catalytic mechanism. Our data indicate that CSK is incapable of inhibiting SFKs by such a mechanism. Therefore, we conclude that the non-catalytic inhibitory mechanism is a unique ability of CHK enabling it to potentially inhibit multiple active conformations of SFKs.

Generation and Purification of YT-phosphorylated Hck and Hck(K267M) (pYT-Hck and pYT-Hck(K267M))—pYT-Hck and pYT-Hck(K267M) were produced by co-expressing Sf9 cells with baculoviruses directing the expression of Hck or Hck(K267M) and CSK. 7The consensus ATP-binding lysine, autophosphorylation site, and the C-terminal regulatory phosphorylation site are referred to as Lys-267, Tyr-388, and Tyr-499, respectively. For the 59-kDa isoform, these residues correspond to Lys-287, Tyr-408, and Tyr-519. The co-expression allows phosphorylation of YT of Hck and its kinase-defective mutant by CSK. It is noteworthy that not all Hck molecules were phosphorylated by CSK. Thus, in addition to the pYT form of Hck proteins, the crude lysates also contained other forms of Hck proteins, including unphosphorylated Hck and pYA-Hck. 8The constructs of wild type Hck and all Hck mutants, except Hck(2PA-YEEI), were derived from the mouse Hck sequence. Purification of pYT-Hck and pYT-Hck(K267M) involved two steps. First, all forms of Hck and Hck(K267M) were purified by sequential chromatography on ion exchange and hydroxylapatite columns as described previously (27Johnson T.M. Williamson N.A. Scholz G. Jaworowski A. Wettenhall R.E. Dunn A.R. Cheng H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33353-33364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Second, the enzyme preparations were subjected to chromatography onto a column containing the pYEEI gel, which selectively bound unphosphorylated Hck proteins and pYA-Hck, but not pYT-Hck and pYT-Hck(K267M). Briefly, the enzyme preparations were applied to a pYEEI gel column (1-ml packed volume, loading density = 0.85 μmol of pYEEI peptide/ml of packed gel) pre-equilibrated with Buffer A (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mg/ml benzamidine, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm Na3VO4, and 50 mm NaF). The unbound fractions, containing solely or predominantly pYT-Hck and pYT-Hck(K267M), were analyzed by anti-pYA and anti-pYT Western blotting and mass spectrometry to assess phosphorylation states of these proteins. Preparation of YT-phosphorylated Lyn(K274M) (pYT-Lyn(K274M))—pYT-Lyn(K274M) was generated by phosphorylating Lyn(K274M) with CSK in vitro. Briefly, recombinant Lyn(K274M) and CSK proteins (5 μg each) were incubated in the presence of Assay Buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, 50 μm Na3VO4) and 50 μm ATP at 30 °C for 1 h. After incubation, the residual unphosphorylated Lyn(K274M) was removed by pYEEI gel affinity chromatography as detailed in the previous section. The final pYT-Lyn(K274M) preparation was analyzed by anti-pYT Western blotting and mass spectrometry. Generation of Constructs Encoding the Individual Domains of CHK—The GST-SH3 domain construct was generated by amplifying residues 1–80 of CHK by PCR, followed by subcloning into the pGEX6P3 vector. Production of the GST-SH2 domain construct was described elsewhere (28Mulhern T.D. To C. Cheng H.C. J. Biomol. NMR. 2002; 24: 363-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). For the construction of the CHK kinase domain, residues 170–467 of full-length CHK were amplified from pBac-PAK-CHK by PCR. The PCR product was subcloned into the pBacPAK9 vector. The resultant plasmid pBac-PAK-CHK kinase domain was used to generate recombinant baculovirus directing the expression of CHK kinase domain. Expression and Purification of GST-SH3 and GST-SH2 Domains, and CHK Kinase Domain—The GST fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli (BL21(DE3) strain). Purification of the GST-SH2 and GST-SH3 domains of CHK was conducted as described previously (28Mulhern T.D. To C. Cheng H.C. J. Biomol. NMR. 2002; 24: 363-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). For the CHK kinase domain, its expression was directed by the recombinant CHK kinase domain baculovirus in Sf9 cells as described previously (20Chong Y.P. Mulhern T.D. Zhu H.J. Fujita D.J. Bjorge J.D. Tantiongco J.P. Sotirellis N. Lio D.S. Scholz G. Cheng H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20752-20766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Briefly, the recombinant protein was purified by sequential chromatography on dimethylaminoethyl and carboxymethyl columns. The protein was further purified by Sephacryl 200 gel filtration column chromatography, followed by Mono S cation-exchange column chromatography. CHK kinase domain in the column fractions was monitored by Western blotting and kinase activity assay as described previously (20Chong Y.P. Mulhern T.D. Zhu H.J. Fujita D.J. Bjorge J.D.

SH2 Domain Accessibility Assay—This assay monitors accessibility of the SH2 domain of recombinant SFKs. The concentrations of enzymes and amount of pYEEI gel used in the assay were adjusted to allow selective binding of the immobilized pYEEI peptide to unphosphorylated and pYA-SFKs, but not pYT-SFKs. Briefly, each protein (3.4–4.2 pmol) was incubated with 5 μl of pYEEI gel (equivalent to 4.3 nmol of the immobilized pYEEI peptide) in a final volume of 30 μl in Buffer A at 4 °C for 30 min. The mixture was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant containing the unbound enzyme was removed and analyzed by Western blotting. The pYEEI gel was washed with 2 × 1.3 ml of Buffer A, 2 × 1.3 ml of Buffer A in 0.5 m NaCl, and 1 × 1.3 ml of Buffer A in 1 m NaCl. Proteins bound to the pYEEI gel were analyzed by Western blotting. Co-immunoprecipitation and Ni-NTA Pulldown Assays—CHK was incubated with SFKs in different conformations at 30 °C for 30 min. To perform the anti-CHK immunoprecipitation (anti-CHK IP), the reaction mixtures were transferred to Protein A-Sepharose beads pre-coated with 4.4 μg of anti-CHK antibody (15 μl bed volume). For the anti-FLAG IP, the reaction mixtures were applied to the anti-FLAG antibody covalently coupled to agarose (Kodak), followed by agitation of the samples at 4 °C for 2 h. After separation from the unbound proteins, the immunoprecipitates were washed with Buffer A in NaCl (0 to 1 m). Proteins in the immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting. To study the effect of disrupting the pYT/SH2 interaction on CHK binding, pYT-Hck, pYT-Hck(K267M), and pYT-Lyn(K274M) were preincubated with 500 μm pYEEI peptide for 1 h at 4 °C prior to co-immunoprecipitation. The pulldown assays were performed under similar conditions using Ni-NTA resins (5 μl bed volume). Demonstration of Stable Complex Formation between CHK and Hck(2PA-YEEI) in Transfected HEK293T Cells—HEK293T cells were transfected with pcDNA3-Hck(2PA-YEEI) or pcDNA3-CHK plasmids, or co-transfected with both plasmids. The crude lysates were prepared as described previously (20Chong Y.P. Mulhern T.D. Zhu H.J. Fujita D.J. Bjorge J.D. Tantiongco J.P. Sotirellis N. Lio D.S. Scholz G. Cheng H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20752-20766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Aliquots of the cell lysate (1 mg of total proteins per sample) were incubated with anti-CHK antibody covalently coupled to Protein A-Sepharose beads (with 2.8 μg of antibody covalently coupled to 8 μl of packed gel) at 4 °C for 2 h with gentle agitation. The immunoprecipitates were washed as described previously (20Chong Y.P. Mulhern T.D. Zhu H.J. Fujita D.J. Bjorge J.D. Tantiongco J.P. Sotirellis N. Lio D.S. Scholz G. Cheng H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20752-20766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Hck(2PA-YEEI) bound to CHK was separated on SDS-PAGE and visualized by Western blotting. Hck Kinase Activity Assays—Hck, Hck(2PA-YEEI), and Hck-(222–503), ranging from 20 to 57 nm, were incubated with the designated amount of CHK or CSK at 4 °C for 20 min. An assay mixture containing 50 μm [γ-32P]ATP, Assay Buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, and 50 μm Na3VO4), and 300 μm cdc2(6–20) peptide was introduced to the reaction mixtures. These were incubated at 30 °C for 10 min to permit incorporation of 32P into the cdc2(6–20) peptide catalyzed by Hck and its active mutants. Whereas the cdc2(6–20) peptide is efficiently phosphorylated by Hck proteins, it is a poor substrate of CHK (20Chong Y.P. Mulhern T.D. Zhu H.J. Fujita D.J. Bjorge J.D. Tantiongco J.P. Sotirellis N. Lio D.S. Scholz G. Cheng H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20752-20766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and CSK (data not shown). To determine the background phosphorylation of cdc2(6–20) peptide by CSK or CHK, control reaction mixtures with only CSK or CHK were included. 32P incorporation into cdc2(6–20) peptide was monitored as previously described (29Glass D.B. Masaracchia R.A. Feramisco J.R. Kemp B.E. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 566-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). To study the ability of CHK to inhibit the pYEEI-activated pYT-Hck, CSK-phosphorylated Hck preparation (1 μm) was activated with pYEEI peptide (500 μm), under identical conditions described for the co-immunoprecipitation assay. The catalytic activity of the pYEEI-activated Hck in the presence of varying CHK concentrations was examined by kinase assay. Assay for the Hck(2PA-YEEI) Activity in Lysate of the Transfected HEK293T Cells—HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with the following plasmids: (i) pcDNA3-Hck(2PA-YEEI) only, (ii) pcDNA3-CHK and pcDNA3-Hck(2PA-YEEI), (iii) pcDNA3-CHK, and (iv) pcDNA3 only, as previously described (20Chong Y.P.

Hck(2PA-YEEI) activity in the crude lysates (0.1–0.2 μg of total proteins) was measured by the kinase assay method as detailed elsewhere (20Chong Y.P. Mulhern T.D. Zhu H.J. Fujita D.J. Bjorge J.D.

The Src optimal peptide (AEEEIYGEFEAKKK), which is a specific and efficient peptide substrate for Hck, was used as substrate of this assay. The peptide phosphorylation reaction was performed at 30 °C for 20 min and the phosphorylated peptide was separated from free [γ-32P]ATP by the phosphocellulose filter paper assay procedure (24Sicilia R.J. Hibbs M.L. Bello P.A. Bjorge J.D. Fujita D.J. Stanley I.J. Dunn A.R. Cheng H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16756-16763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Determination of Phosphorylation Sites in the SFK Preparations by Mass Spectrometry—32P radiolabeled SFKs were generated as above, and ∼5 μg of protein was precipitated by acetone (acetone:protein solution = 10:1 (v/v)) and dried.

https://openalex.org/W2037097058,"Dimerization of the global anaerobic transcription factor FNR is essential for FNR activity. Under aerobic conditions FNR is an inactive monomeric species because it lacks the oxygen labile [4Fe-4S] cluster required for dimerization. In this study, we investigated the protein side chains that inhibit FNR dimerization under aerobic conditions. Substitution of Asp154 within the predicted dimerization helix with residues containing neutral or positively charged side chains increased FNR activity under aerobic conditions, whereas replacement of Asp154 with Glu inhibited FNR activity similar to WT-FNR. Similar results were obtained when making analogous substitutions of Glu150. In vitro analysis of representative FNR mutant proteins indicated that their increased activity under aerobic conditions resulted from an [4Fe-4S] independent mechanism of dimerization. In addition, simultaneous substitution of residues 150 and 154 with Lys restored inhibition of FNR activity under aerobic growth conditions. Collectively, these data indicate that charge repulsion by side chains at positions 150 and 154 is necessary to inhibit dimerization under aerobic conditions. They also suggest that a [4Fe-4S]-dependent conformational change overcomes charge repulsion between subunits under anaerobic conditions. Comparison of the trypsin sensitivity of [4Fe-4S]-FNR and apoFNR indicated that there are no major differences in protease sensitivity between these forms, whereas circular dichroism suggested that small changes in secondary structure occur between the cluster-containing FNR and apoFNR. Thus, the [4Fe-4S]-dependent conformational change necessary to overcome inter-subunit charge repulsion and create a subunit interface more favorable for dimerization must be small.

A major O2 sensor in Escherichia coli is the transcription factor FNR, 2The abbreviations used are: FNR, fumarate nitrate reduction; CD, circular dichroism; WT, wild type; CRP, cAMP receptor protein. 2The abbreviations used are: FNR, fumarate nitrate reduction; CD, circular dichroism; WT, wild type; CRP, cAMP receptor protein. which regulates transcription of genes under anaerobic growth conditions (1Guest J.R.

Kiley P.J. Storz G. Hengee-Aronis R. Bacterial Stress Response. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D.C.2000: 61-78Google Scholar). In the absence of O2, FNR is a ∼60-kDa homodimer, with each subunit containing a [4Fe-4S] cluster (3Lazazzera B.A. Beinert H. Khoroshilova N. Kennedy M.C. Kiley P.J. J. Biol.

A. 1997; 94: 6087-6092Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Dimerization is required for FNR activity, because only the dimeric form binds to specific sequences in the promoter region of target genes to activate or repress transcription (3Lazazzera B.A. Beinert H. Khoroshilova N. Kennedy M.C. Kiley P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2762-2768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Under aerobic conditions, FNR target genes are not regulated because FNR is converted to a monomeric species, which is inactive for site-specific DNA binding and accordingly, transcriptional regulation (4Green J. Bennett B. Jordan P. Ralph E.T. Thomson A.J. Guest J.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 887-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 5Khoroshilova N. Popescu C. Munck E. Beinert H. Kiley P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6087-6092Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The formation of the monomeric species results from the initial O2-dependent degradation of the [4Fe-4S] cluster to a [2Fe-2S] cluster (5Khoroshilova N. Popescu C. Munck E. Beinert H. Kiley P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6087-6092Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 6Popescu C.V. Bates D.M. Beinert H. Munck E. Kiley P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13431-13435Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar); the [2Fe-2S] cluster is then further degraded into clusterless apoFNR (7Sutton V.R. Stubna A. Patschkowski T. Munck E. Beinert H. Kiley P.J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 791-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Because the structure of FNR in any form has not been determined, a key question to address is how the [4Fe-4S] cluster alters the conformation of FNR to achieve regulated dimerization.FNR belongs to the CRP/FNR superfamily of transcription factors, all of which are predicted to have similar tertiary structures but can be distinguished by their specificity for different effector ligands (8Korner H. Sofia H.J. Zumft W.G. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2003; 27: 559-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). The two best structurally characterized members of this family are the E. coli transcription factor CRP, which contains bound cAMP in the active form (9Weber I.T. Steitz T.A. Bubis J. Taylor S.S. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 343-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), and the Rhodospirillum rubrum transcription factor CooA, which contains a CO-bound heme cofactor when active (10Shelver D. Kerby R.L. He Y. Roberts G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11216-11220Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Unlike FNR, both CRP and CooA are dimeric in the absence of their effector molecules (10Shelver D. Kerby R.L. He Y. Roberts G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11216-11220Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 11Brown A.M. Crothers D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7387-7391Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 12Cheng X. Gonzalez M.L. Lee J.C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8130-8139Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The structure of CRP is characterized by a C-terminal helix turn helix DNA binding domain and an N-terminal effector binding domain, which contains an α-helix (known as the C-helix or dimerization helix) that promotes subunit-subunit interactions (Fig. 1) (9Weber I.T. Steitz T.A. Bubis J. Taylor S.S. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 343-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Previous studies of FNR suggest that like the subunit interface of CRP, FNR protomers interact via a coiled-coil of a predicted α-helix and that the interface (positions a and d in a coiled-coil heptad repeat) contains mostly large hydrophobic residues (13Moore L.J. Kiley P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45744-45750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, a notable exception within this interface is the negatively charged Asp residue at position 154. It is likely that this residue plays an inhibitory role in dimerization because a substitution to Ala promotes dimerization under aerobic conditions, yielding a transcriptionally active protein even when the [4Fe-4S] cluster is absent (14Lazazzera B.A. Bates D.M. Kiley P.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1993-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that substitution to a Lys at Glu150, also results in an aerobically active transcription factor (15Bates D.M. Lazazzera B.A. Kiley P.J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3972-3978Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Kiley P.J. Reznikoff W.S. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 16-22Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that both residues play a role in achieving regulated dimerization of FNR by O2. Because the location of the [4Fe-4S] cluster of FNR is predicted to be distant from the dimerization helix (Fig. 1), these data led to the hypothesis that ligation of the [4Fe-4S] cluster is coupled to a long range conformational change that overcomes the inhibitory effects of Asp154 and Glu150 to favor dimerization.In this study we used site-directed mutagenesis followed by in vivo and in vitro studies to examine the connection between the charge of the residues at positions 154 and 150, the transcriptional activity, and extent of dimerization of the aerobic form of FNR. We also used circular dichroism spectroscopy and protease sensitivity assays to investigate the degree of the conformational differences between the [4Fe-4S]-FNR, [2Fe-2S]-FNR, and apoFNR.MATERIALS AND METHODSPlasmid and Strain Construction—Plasmids and strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. Amino acid substitutions of FNR were created via site-directed mutagenesis of pPK821, pPK822 (for mutant proteins also containing the Asp154Ala substitution), or pPK5111 (for mutant proteins also containing the D154K substitution) using oligonucleotide primers (Operon Technologies or Integrated DNA Technologies) as described previously (14Lazazzera B.A. Bates D.M. Kiley P.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1993-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The mutations were recombined onto λfnr-C122S from the relevant pPK821, pPK822, or pPK5111 derivative. Because λfnr-C122S has a FNR– phenotype since the Fe-S ligand, Cys122, has been changed to Ser (15Bates D.M. Lazazzera B.A. Kiley P.J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3972-3978Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it produces only white Lac– plaques when incubated with strain RZ8480 and overlaid in top agar with 100 μg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactoside. λfnr recombinants with the desired mutations were then identified as blue plaques (FNR+ phenotype) as previously described (15Bates D.M. Lazazzera B.A. Kiley P.J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3972-3978Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Individual λfnr recombinants were plaque purified, PCR amplified, and the resulting DNA fragments were sequenced at the University of Wisconsin sequencing facility to verify the incorporation of the desired mutation and the wild type (WT) codon for Cys122. At least 3 monolysogens of each λfnr derivative were isolated from RZ8480 as previously described (17Mousset S. Thomas R. Nature. 1969; 221: 242-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The fnr coding sequences of some pPK821, pPK822, and pPK5111 derivatives were cloned into pET11a using the NdeI and BamHI restriction sites (13Moore L.J. Kiley P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45744-45750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmids were sequenced and used for either β-galactosidase assays or FNR protein overexpression.TABLE 1Strains and plasmids used in this studyStrain or plasmidRelevant genotypeRef.E. coli strainsRZ8480lacZΔ145 ΔfnrΩSpr/Smr narG::MudI173414Lazazzera B.A. Bates D.M.

Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar) with 0.2% glucose and 10 mm potassium nitrate. Aerobic cultures were grown to an optical density at 600 nm of ≤0.3, whereas anaerobic cultures were grown to an optical density of 0.4 to 0.6.Protein Isolation—[4Fe-4S]-FNR (either WT or FNR-L28H) was isolated from cells grown in M9 minimal media supplemented with 0.2% glucose, 0.2% casamino acids, and ferric ammonium citrate (10 μg/ml) to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.4–0.6, induced with 400 μm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 1 h, sparged overnight under argon at 4 °C, and purified anaerobically as described previously (19Sutton V.R. Kiley P.J. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 370: 300-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The presence of the [4Fe-4S] cluster was verified by the characteristic visible absorbance spectrum and analysis of iron (20Kennedy M.C. Kent T.A. Emptage M. Merkle H. Beinert H. Munck E. J. Biol.

The ratio of iron to sulfur was between 1 and 1.2 for all preparations and the amount of the FNR protein that contained the [4Fe-4S] cluster based on S2– content was between 50 and 65%. The [2Fe-2S]-FNR for protease digestion studies was isolated by growing cells overproducing [4Fe-4S]-FNR as described above, aerating the cells to convert FNR to the [2Fe-2S] cluster form and then isolating [2Fe-2S]-FNR as previously described (7Sutton V.R. Stubna A. Patschkowski T. Munck E. Beinert H. Kiley P.J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 791-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The occupancy of [2Fe-2S]-FNR used in protease sensitivity studies was ∼47%.Apoprotein lacking any Fe-S cluster was isolated from PK22 derivatives containing WT-fnr or relevant mutants grown to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.4 to 0.6 in either M9 minimal media with 0.2% glucose or Luria broth with 0.2% glucose. FNR synthesis was induced with 400 μm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 1 h, the cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in a potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) with 100 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The protein was isolated as described previously (14Lazazzera B.A. Bates D.M. Kiley P.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1993-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) except that a PolyCat A column (Nest Group) connected to a Beckman high performance liquid chromatography system was used in place of the Bio-Rex 70 and Q-Sepharose columns. No significant amount of iron or S2– was found in the aerobically isolated protein.Size Exclusion Chromatography—Size exclusion chromatography was performed using an Amersham Biosciences HR-12 Superose column (10 × 300 mm) connected to a Beckman high performance liquid chromatography system that was located in a Coy anaerobic chamber (atmosphere of 5% CO2, 90% N2, and 5% H2). The column was run at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min in 50 mm KPO4 (pH 6.8), 400 mm KCl at 23 °C. Aliquots of FNR or its mutant derivatives (200 μl in 50 mm KPO4 (pH 6.8), 400 mm KCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) were injected onto the column and the absorbance of the eluent was monitored from 200 to 600 nm using a photodiode array detector. The column was calibrated with cytochrome c, bovine serum albumin, and carbonic anhydrase. The chomatograms were analyzed using the Beckman System Gold Nouveau software.Limited Proteolysis—Isolated [4Fe-4S]-FNR, [2Fe-2S]-FNR, [4Fe-4S]-FNR-L28H (22Bates D.M. Popescu C.V. Khoroshilova N.

FNR protein (20 μg) was incubated with trypsin (1 μg; 13 units) in 60 μl of 50 mm KPO4 (pH 6.8), 10% glycerol, 0.4 m NaCl. The reaction was terminated by transferring to SDS loading buffer (62.5 mm Tris (pH 6.8), 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.01% bromphenol blue) and heating at 90 °C for 10 min. All samples were run on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel, stained with Coomassie Blue, and the amount of Coomassie-stained protein was quantified using ImageQuant. The trypsin cleavage sites were identified by mass spectrometry following precipitation of trypsin-treated apo- or [4Fe-4S]-FNR (90% cluster occupancy) protein (200 μl) with 10–15 μl of acetic acid, washing the protein pellet with 80% acetone, and solubilizing the pellet in formic acid. Mass spectra were acquired in the positive ion mode on an Applied Biosystems 32000 Q TRAP LC/MS/MS mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray ionization source. Data acquisition, spectrum deconvolution, and analysis were performed using Analyst QS software.CD Spectroscopy—Circular dichroism spectra were taken over a range of 200 to 300 nm at 1-nm increments and a 3-s acquisition time on an Aviv model 202SF CD spectropolarimeter. An anaerobic spectrum of [4Fe-4S]-FNR (5 μm FNR with 60% occupancy of the [4Fe-4S] cluster in 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 6.8) and 200 mm KCl) was collected in a 1-mm sealed quartz cuvette. The sample was removed from the cuvette, exposed to air for a period of time sufficient to generate [2Fe-2S]-FNR (45 min), and another CD spectrum was recorded. A CD spectrum of apoFNR (5 μm) was also recorded under the same conditions except 1 mm tris-(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (Molecular Probes), a thiol reducing agent that prevents aggregation of apoFNR was added to the solution. A fit of the CD line shape was carried out with the k2D algorithm (23Andrade M.A. Chacon P. Merelo J.J. Moran F. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar).RESULTSAmino Acid Substitutions of Asp154 Show That a Negative Charge Is Important for Proper O2 Regulation of FNR—Previous studies showed that changing Asp154 to Ala resulted in a FNR protein that was active (14Lazazzera B.A. Bates D.M. Kiley P.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1993-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 15Bates D.M. Lazazzera B.A. Kiley P.J. J.

Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 16-22Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and dimerized under aerobic conditions in the absence of a [4Fe-4S] cluster (3Lazazzera B.A. Beinert H. Khoroshilova N. Kennedy M.C. Kiley P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2762-2768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 14Lazazzera B.A. Bates D.M. Kiley P.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1993-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Because, the molecular mechanism by which this substitution allowed dimerization was unknown, we replaced the Asp at position 154 with amino acid side chains of different properties to test which promote FNR activity and dimerization under aerobic conditions. FNR activity was assessed by measuring the level of β-galactosidase activity from strains containing lacZ under control of the FNR-dependent narG promoter (PnarG) and λfnr or its mutant derivatives integrated into the λatt site. When these strains were assayed for activity under aerobic conditions (Fig. 2A), only the FNR mutant with a Glu residue at 154 remained inactive like WT-FNR. In contrast, substitution of the negatively charged side chain with hydrophobic (Leu, Val, Ala, and Gly), polar (Cys and Asn), or basic (Lys) residues at this position yielded FNR proteins that were active under aerobic conditions. Surprisingly, the most active mutant protein under aerobic conditions contained the oppositely charged Lys in place of Asp (FNR-D154K). Western blot analysis showed that the FNR mutant proteins were present at levels similar to that of WT-FNR (data not shown), demonstrating that the change in activity is not due to a change in the protein concentration. Under anaerobic conditions, the mutants showed the same levels of β-galactosidase activity as WT-FNR (Fig. 2B), suggesting that all of the mutant proteins were still responsive to ligation of the [4Fe-4S] cluster.FIGURE 2Effect of substitutions at Asp154 on FNR activity. The activity of FNR mutants containing substitutions at position 154 was determined by the amount of β-galactosidase produced in RZ8480 (narG-lacZ) strains grown under aerobic conditions (A) or anaerobic conditions (B) in glucose minimal media with 10 mm potassium nitrate. The activity is given as a percentage of the activity of the strain containing WT-FNR grown under anaerobic conditions (640 Miller units). The source of FNR is indicated on the x axis. The error bars show the standard deviation measured from assaying at least three independent isolates.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To test if the increased activity of FNR-D154K under aerobic conditions was correlated with an increase in dimerization as was previously observed with FNR-D154A, size exclusion chromatography was performed (13Moore L.J. Kiley P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45744-45750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). As expected from previous studies (3Lazazzera B.A. Beinert H.

FNR-D154K, lacking any Fe-S cluster, was eluted at the same position as FNR-D154A indicating that it is also dimeric under these solution conditions. Thus, these data suggest that the loss of the negative charge at position 154 is sufficient to increase dimerization of FNR under aerobic conditions.FIGURE 3Size exclusion chromatography of aerobically isolated FNR. The elution profile of apoFNR measured at 222 nm from the HR-12 Superose column is shown for WT-FNR protein (A), 10 μm; FNR-D154A (B), 5 μm; FNR-D154K (C), 5 μm; and FNR-E150K/D154K (D) at 5 (solid line), 10 (dashed line), and 20 μm (♦).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)A Negative Charge at Position 150 Is Also Important for Inhibiting the Aerobic Activity of FNR—The finding that only negatively charged residues at position 154 inhibited dimerization under aerobic conditions suggested that repulsion by another negatively charged residue within the dimerization helix of WT-FNR may prevent dimerization. To test this hypothesis, we assayed the activity of a library of Ala substitution mutants of the predicted FNR dimerization interface (Arg140 to Leu159) (13Moore L.J. Kiley P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45744-45750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) under aerobic conditions. The only single Ala substitution along the dimerization helix that results in an active protein under aerobic conditions, in addition to FNR-D154A, is FNR-E150A (Table 2, Fig. 4). In addition, substituting Glu150 with a polar (Gln) residue also increased FNR activity in vivo under aerobic conditions (Fig. 4). As was found with position 154, the replacement of the negatively charged residue (Glu) with a positively charged residue (Lys) resulted in the highest activity of all the Glu150 substitutions (Fig. 4), although, the amount of β-galactosidase activity for all three mutants at position 150 was 2–3-fold less than similar replacements of position 154. Because Glu150 falls on the same face of the dimerization helix as Asp154, it seems likely that these two residues are in close proximity. We also tested whether placing a negative charge on the opposite face of the helix would affect FNR activity. The mutant containing a substitution of Lys152 to Glu had little activity under aerobic conditions like WT-FNR, suggesting that only the presence of negative charges at the predicted helical interface are important for regulating dimerization under aerobic conditions.TABLE 2Activity under aerobic condition of FNR proteins with alanine substitution within the dimerization helixFNR% Aerobic activityaFNR activity under aerobic growth conditions of mutants containing a single Ala substitution of a residue from 140 to 159.% Aerobic activity in presence of D154A mutationbFNR activity under aerobic conditions of the D154A substitution with a second Ala substitution of a residue from 140 to 159.

Early metastatic growth involves both a remodeling of the extracellular matrix surrounding tumors and invasion of tumors across the basement membrane. Up-regulation of extracellular matrix degrading proteases such as urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) and matrix metalloproteinases has been reported to facilitate tumor cell invasion. Autocrine transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling may play an important role in cancer cell invasion and metastasis; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In the present study, we report that autocrine TGF-β supports cancer cell invasion by maintaining uPA levels through protein secretion. Interestingly, treatment of paracrine/exogenous TGF-β at higher concentrations than autocrine TGF-β further enhanced uPA expression and cell invasion. The enhanced uPA expression by exogenous TGF-β is a result of increased uPA mRNA expression due to RNA stabilization. We observed that both autocrine and paracrine TGF-β-mediated regulation of uPA levels was lost upon depletion of Smad4 protein by RNA interference. Thus, through the Smad pathway, autocrine TGF-β maintains uPA expression through facilitated protein secretion, thereby supporting tumor cell invasiveness, whereas exogenous TGF-β further enhances uPA expression through mRNA stabilization leading to even greater invasiveness of the cancer cells.

Malignant tumors are characterized by their ability to metastasize to distant organs. The initial steps of metastasis involve invasive growth of tumors across the basement membrane and migration through the extracellular matrix (ECM). 2The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; TGF-β, transforming growth factor-β;TβRI, -II, transmembrane types I and II; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; DNIIR, dominant-negative type II receptor; uPA, urokinase plasminogen activator; PAI-1, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; m.o.i., multiplicity of infection; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; ANOVA, analysis of variance. 2The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; TGF-β, transforming growth factor-β;TβRI, -II, transmembrane types I and II; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; DNIIR, dominant-negative type II receptor; uPA, urokinase plasminogen activator; PAI-1, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; m.o.i., multiplicity of infection; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; ANOVA, analysis of variance. Because the enzymatic degradation of both the basement membrane and ECM barriers requires a number of ECM-degrading proteases (1Mignatti P. Robbins E. Rifkin D.B. Cell. 1986; 47: 487-498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar, 2Ellenrieder V. Hendler S.F. Ruhland C. Boeck W. Adler G. Gress T.M. Int. J. Cancer. 2001; 93: 204-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and is a critical early event in metastasis, invasiveness may be modulated by the expression of ECM-degrading proteases in tumor cells in response to autonomous and microenvironmental signals. Among the increasing number of ECM-degrading proteases implicated in metastasis, considerable attention has been focused on the family of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and the plasminogen activator system. One of the regulators of these ECM-degrading proteases is transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β). TGF-β is a multifunctional cytokine that regulates cell proliferation, differentiation, plasticity, and migration in a context-dependent manner (reviewed in Refs. 3Zavadil J. Bottinger E.P. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 5764-5774Crossref PubMed Scopus (1357) Google Scholar and 4Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Cell. Biochem. 2005; 96: 447-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). TGF-β transduces signaling through a transmembrane type II receptor (TβRII), a constitutively active serine/threonine kinase receptor (5Lin H.Y. Wang X.F. Ng-Eaton E. Weinberg R.A. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1992; 68: 775-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar). Upon ligand binding, the TβRII recruits and transphosphorylates intracellular TGF-β type I receptor (TβRI), thereby stimulating TβRI serine/threonine kinase activity (6Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Wieser R. Ventura F. Massague J. Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2088) Google Scholar). The TβRI then activates the downstream effectors, Smad2 and Smad3, by phosphorylation. The activated Smad proteins form complexes with the common Smad mediator, Smad4, and then translocate to the nucleus, where the Smad complexes regulate transcription of TGF-β target genes in conjunction with various transcriptional or co-transcriptional regulators. In addition to the Smad pathway, other signaling pathways, including the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2) (7Frey R. Mulder K.

The precise molecular mechanisms of regulation of these pathways for TGF-β signaling and the physiological and pathological roles of TGF-β in normal tissues and cancer have not been completely defined. The importance of autocrine TGF-β in tumor progression and metastatic behavior has been documented previously. For instance, disruption of autocrine TGF-β signaling by a dominant-negative type II receptor (DNIIR) inhibited the invasive and metastatic potential of mammary and colon carcinoma cells (13Oft M. Heider K.-H. Beug H. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1243-1252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This was attributed to prevention of autocrine TGF-β-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, a process believed to promote tumor cell migration and invasion (12Bakin A.V. Tomlinson A.K.

In a different study, overexpression of a soluble TGF-β type III receptor antagonized autocrine TGF-β activity and resulted in inhibition of tumor cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis (14Lei X. Bandyopadhyay A. Le T. Sun L. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 7514-7523Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar).

Princess Takamatsu Symp. 1994; 24: 152-161PubMed Google Scholar). We hypothesized that autocrine TGF-β may function as a tumor promoter by regulating MMP-9 or uPA activity in MDA-MB-231 cells. The present study provides evidence that autocrine TGF-β regulates both cell invasiveness and uPA secretion. Inhibition of uPA activity is sufficient to suppress tumor cell invasion to the same extent as inhibition of autocrine TGF-β signaling, suggesting that autocrine TGF-β stimulation of invasiveness occurs via its regulation of uPA release. The Smad pathway appears to be required for the regulation of uPA release as silencing of Smad4 protein expression suppressed uPA secretion. Interestingly, although autocrine TGF-β regulates uPA production through protein secretion, exogenous TGF-β further increases uPA expression through RNA stabilization also through a Smad4-dependent fashion. Finally, this work demonstrates that a pharmacological kinase inhibitor of TGF-β receptors inhibits both uPA secretion and tumor cell invasiveness, thereby providing evidence for the potential efficacy of targeting TGF-β signaling for therapeutic intervention in cancer and suggests that uPA expression or secretion may be an important mediator of such effects. Cell Cultures and Reagents—MDA-MB-231 cells from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) were maintained in the Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2. TGF-β was purchased from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). The recombinant active human PAI-1 (cat. no. 1092) and human urokinase (cat. no. 124) were from American Diagnostica, Inc. (Greenwich, CT).

Immunoblot Analysis—To harvest protein lysates, cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1 mm sodium fluoride) for 20 min on ice. Lysates were sonicated and then clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Protein contents of lysates were determined by the Bradford Assay (Bio-Rad). Proteins in the lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were blocked in 5% milk PBS-T (0.1% Tween 20 (v/v) in PBS) for 1 h at room temperature and then probed with primary antibodies in 5% milk PBS-T overnight at 4 °C. After several washes with PBS-T, membranes were incubated in PBS-T containing horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature and washed again with PBS-T. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by chemiluminescence reaction using ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences) followed by exposure of the membranes to XAR5 films (Kodak, Rochester, NY). To detect secreted uPA, conditioned media were collected, centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 5 min to remove cell debris, and then subjected to immunoblotting under non-reducing conditions. 2- to 8-h conditioned media were concentrated using Microcon YM-10 centrifugal filter devices from Millipore (Billerica, MA). The volumes of conditioned media loaded on gels were normalized to the protein concentrations of cell lysates. The fibronectin antibody was purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories, Inc. The Smad2 and phospho-Smad2 antibodies were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). The uPA antibody (cat. no. 394) was obtained from American Diagnostica, Inc. The polyadenosine diphosphate ribose polymerase and Rho GDI (guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The actin and FLAG antibodies were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Inc. Transient Transfection and Luciferase Reporter Assay—Cells at 50–70% confluence on 12-well plates were co-transfected with 0.5 μg of a firefly luciferase promoter-reporter construct and 0.01 μg of the Renilla reniformis luciferase reference reporter construct, phRL-TK (Promega, Madison, WI) using Lipofectamine Plus reagents (Invitrogen). Four hours after transfection, cells were cultured back in regular media. Forty-eight hours after transfection, firefly and R. reniformis luciferase activities were measured using the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System kit (Promega) in an Optocomp II Luminometer (MGM Instruments, Inc., Hamden, CT). Normalized firefly luciferase activity was plotted as mean ± S.D. from three independent experiments. The phuPA-Luc reporter containing the nucleotide sequence –2345 to +30 of the human uPA promoter was kindly provided by Dr. Shuji Kojima (29Suzuki Y. Shimada J. Shudo K. Matsumura M. Crippa M.P. Kojima S. Blood. 1999; 93: 4264-4276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The p3TP-Lux reporter was a generous gift from Dr. Joan Massague (30Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Carcamo J. Zentella A. Doody J.

Matrigel Invasion Assay—A modified Boyden chamber assay was performed using Transwells (12-μm pore size, 12 mm in diameter) from Costar (Cambridge, MA) and Matrigel (BD Biosciences). Each Transwell insert was first coated with 100 μl of 2.5 mg/ml Matrigel diluted in serum-free media for 1 h at 37 °C, and then 10 μl of Matrigel was added in the center of the Transwell 2 h before use. Cells were trypsinized, washed with serum-free media twice, re-suspended in 0.2% bovine serum albumin serum-free medium, seeded in Transwell inserts (150,000 cells/insert), and grown in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum media in the lower chamber. After 16 h of incubation, Matrigel and cells remaining inside the inserts were removed with Q-tips, and the cells that had traversed to the reverse side of the inserts were rinsed with PBS, fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature, and stained with 1% crystal violet for 1 h to overnight at room temperature. Cells were counted under a light microscope (at 200× power), and invasive cell numbers were the averages of those from five areas on each insert. Each invasion assay was performed in triplicate and repeated three times. Adenovirus-mediated Overexpression of a Dominant-negative TGF-β Type II Receptor (DNIIR)—To amplify adenoviruses, 293T cells cultured in 5% serum/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at 80% confluence on P100 plates, were infected with adenoviruses in 1 ml of fresh 5% serum medium with rocking. After 3 h, 9 ml of 5% serum medium was added in each plate without removing infection medium. Three days after infection, cells were trypsinized, collected in 1 ml of 5% fetal bovine serum medium, and subjected to three freeze/thaw cycles at –20 °C/37 °C. Adenovirus-containing supernatant was obtained from the cell suspension by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C and stored at –80 °C. The relative values of multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of adenoviral suspension were determined by examining the cytopathic effect in 293T (adenovirus at m.o.i. values of 10–20 causes a total CPE in confluent 293T cells 3 days post infection). To perform adenoviral infection, 70–80% confluent cells were washed with PBS once, incubated with adenovirus-containing medium for 3 h, and then grown in regular serum media. Lysates and conditioned media were harvested 48–72 h post infection. Cell Proliferation Assay—Cells were seeded in 96-well plates (50,000/well), and the relative viable cell numbers were determined by MTT assay using the CellTiter 96 Non-radioactive Cell Proliferation Assay kit (Promega), following the manufacturer's protocol. MTT hydrolysis was determined by measuring the absorbance at 570 nm using a plate reader. Preparation of Plasma Membrane Fractions—Cells were collected into buffer containing 0.15 m NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, 2 mm CaCl2, 100 μg/ml leupeptin, 2.5 mg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (pH 8.0) by scraping and then lysed by freeze/thaw (liquid N2/42 °C) cycles. Nuclei were isolated from the suspension of lysed cells by centrifugation at 500 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, washed three times, and re-suspended in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. The nucleus-free supernatant was spun at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was compose of cytoplasmic fractions, and the pellets were subsequently washed three times with 3 ml of the cell resuspension buffer and dissolved in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer as membrane fractions. MMP Zymography—Serum-free conditioned medium was mixed with 2× sample buffer (0.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 5% SDS, 20% glycerol, and 1% bromphenol blue) and subject to SDS-PAGE using 10% SDS-gelatin (1 mg/ml final concentration) gels under a non-reducing condition. After electrophoresis, gels were soaked in washing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 m NaCl, and 2.5% Triton X-100) for 1 h at room temperature to remove SDS and then in reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 5 mm CaCl2, pH 8.0) overnight at 37 °C. Subsequently, gels were stained in staining buffer (0.15% Coomassie Blue R250 in 10% acetic acid and 30% methanol) and de-stained in the same staining solution without Coomassie Blue R250. Clear bands of pro- and active MMP-9 (92 and 84 kDa, respectively) were observed against the blue background of stained gels. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA isolated with the TRIzol reagent was resolved on formaldehyde-agarose gels, transferred, and immobilized onto Hybond-N nylon membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Blots were blocked in the ULTRAHyb buffer (Ambion, Austin, TX) for 3 h at 65°C and then probed with 32P-labeled antisense Riboprobes (5 × 105 cpm/ml) in the ULTRAHyb buffer overnight at 68 °C. After several washes with low stringency (2× SSC/0.1% SDS) and high stringency (0.1× SSC/0.1% SDS) buffers at 68 °C, images were acquired by autoradiography using a PhosphorImager. To prepare Riboprobes, cDNA plasmids were linearized, purified, and then subject to in vitro transcription using the MAXIscript kit (Ambion) in the presence of 50 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol) for 1 h at 37 °C. Unincorporated nucleotides were removed using Nuc-Away columns (Ambion). Nuclear Run-on Assay—Cell were collected, washed twice with PBS, and then re-suspended in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). Nonidet P-40 was then added to a final concentration of 0.2–0.5%, depending on cell types. After a 5-min incubation on ice, nuclei were pelleted at 500 × g for 5 min, washed once with nuclear freezing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 40% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol), and re-suspended in fresh nuclear freezing buffer. In vitro run-on transcription was performed using 2 × 107 nuclei in 150 μl of reaction buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm of ATP, CTP, or GTP, 150 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol), 80 units of RNasin, and 2.5 mm dithiothreitol) for 30 min at 30 °C. Transcription was terminated by adding 350 μl of deoxyribonuclease I solution (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm CaCl2, and 300 units of RNase-free DNase I) and a 30-min incubation at 37 °C. Next, proteins were digested by adding 50 μl of proteinase K solution (1% SDS, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 300 μg/ml proteinase K) and a 30-min incubation at 50 °C. The 32P-labeled RNAs were phenol/chloroform purified and precipitated in 10% trichloroacetic acid plus 20 μg of yeast tRNA. After centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 1 h, the RNAs were re-suspended in RNase-free H2O, denatured for 10 min at 65 °C, and then chilled on ice. The radiolabeled RNAs were hybridized to cDNAs pre-immobilized on membranes in hybridization buffer (50% formamide, 5× SSC, 5 mm EDTA, 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.1% SDS, and 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA) for 48 h at 42 °C. Next, the membranes were washed several times in 2× SSC (1× SSC = 0.15 m NaCl and 12.5 mm sodium citrate, pH 7) and then in 2× SSC plus 10 μg/ml RNase A for another 30 min or not depending on intensity of background. Signals were acquired and quantified by a PhosphorImager. To immobilize cDNAs to nitrocellulose membranes, 1 μg of linearized plasmid was denatured in 0.2 m NaOH for 30 min at room temperature and then neutralized with 10 volumes of 6× SSC. The DNAs were applied onto nitrocellulose membranes using a slot blot apparatus and immobilized by UV cross-linking. RNA Interference—To perform Smad4 silencing, 50% confluent cells were transfected with 50–200 pm of a pool of four Smad4 or scrambled siRNAs (Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO) using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's guideline. Conditioned media (48–72 h post transfection) and protein lysates (72 h post transfection) were harvested and subjected to immunoblotting for Smad4 and uPA. To determine uPA mRNA stability under a Smad4-silencing condition, cells were first transfected with 100 nm Smad4 siRNA for 6 h and grew in serum media overnight, and then uPA mRNA stability was determined following treatment of TGF-β overnight. Statistical Analysis—p values for multiple comparison tests were derived by an analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a Bonferroni correction. Autocrine TGF-β Signaling Contributes to MDA-MB-231 Cell Invasion—The metastatic MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells secrete active TGF-β (22Martinez-Carpio P.A. Mur C. Rosel P. Navarro M.A. Cell.

A. 2001; 98: 992-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The importance of autocrine TGF-β signaling in regulation of MDA-MB-231 cell invasiveness was assessed by Matrigel invasion assays following abrogation of autocrine TGF-β signaling using the LY364947 compound (27Peng S.B.

Chem. 2006; 49: 2138-2142Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), a kinase inhibitor of TGF-β type I receptor (TβRI) by functioning as a potent ATP competitive inhibitor. The inhibitory effect of LY364947 on TGF-β signaling was first validated by examining Smad2 phosphorylation. Basal levels of Smad2 phosphorylation were undetectable by immunoblotting. However, LY364947 abolished Smad2 phosphorylation induced by exogenous TGF-β without altering total Smad2 protein levels (Fig. 1A). Expression of fibronectin is induced by TGF-β through a Smad-independent pathway (31Hocevar B.A. Brown T.L. Howe P.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1345-1356Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). LY364947 decreased both basal and exogenous TGF-β-induced fibronectin expression (Fig. 1B). In addition, we evaluated the effect of LY364947 on TGF-β-induced promoter activation by reporter assays using p3TP-Lux, a luciferase reporter construct highly responsive to TGF-β (30Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Carcamo J. Zentella A. Doody J. Laiho M. Wang X.F. Massague J. Cell. 1992; 71: 1003-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar) and observed that LY364947 significantly inhibited both basal and exogenous TGF-β-induced promoter activation (Fig. 1C). To investigate whether autocrine TGF-β has a role in regulation of MDA-MB-231 invasiveness, Matrigel invasion assays were performed with or without LY364947 treatment. LY364947 inhibited cell invasion in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1D). These data suggest that autocrine TGF-β plays a role in basal invasive growth of MDA-MB-231 cells. A Dominant-negative TGF-β Type II Receptor Suppresses Autocrine TGF-β Signaling and Cell Invasion—To substantiate the results obtained using the TGF-β receptor kinase inhibitor, we assessed invasiveness of MDA-MB231 cells following suppression of autocrine TGF-β signaling with a dominant-negative TGF-β type II receptor (TβRII). TβRII is the receptor responsible for ligand binding and for activation of TGF-β type I receptor through its kinase activity. TβRII devoid of the kinase domain (DNIIR) acts as a dominant-negative mutant by competing with wild-type receptors for TGF-β ligands (32Chen R.H. Ebner R. Derynck R. Science. 1993; 260: 1335-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Expression of FLAG-tagged dominant-negative DNIIR was achieved using an adenoviral vector and was confirmed by immunoblotting for FLAG (Fig. 2A). DNIIR expression was increased with increasing amounts of adenovirus, whereas no DNIIR was detected in parental or the β-galactosidase adenovirus-infected cells. Expression of DNIIR inhibited TGF-β-stimulated Smad2 activation (Fig. 2B) and decreased both basal and exogenous TGF-β-induced fibronectin expression (Fig. 2C). DNIIR also suppressed basal and exogenous TGF-β-stimulated p3TP-Lux promoter activation (Fig. 2D), demonstrating the inhibitory effects of DNIIR on TGF-β signaling. As expected, DNIIR expression significantly decreased MDA-MB-231 cell invasion (Fig. 2E). This effect is not a result of inhibition of cell proliferation as determined by MTT assay (data not shown). Thus, consistent with the results using the pharmacological inhibitor, inhibition of autocrine TGF-β signaling by the dominant-negative TGF-β type II receptor (DNIIR) down-regulated MDA-MB-231 invasiveness. Disruption of Autocrine TGF-β Signaling Suppresses uPA Secretion—The MDA-MB-231 cells secrete uPA (20Farina A.R. Coppa A. Tiberio A. Tacconelli A. Turco A. Colletta G. Gulino A. Mackay A.R. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 75: 721-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). To address whether autocrine TGF-β can modulate uPA expression, uPA levels were determined after blockade of autocrine TGF-β signaling using LY364947. Immunoblotting for uPA was conducted under non-reducing conditions, which detect both uPA and complexes of uPA and its inhibitor, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) (33Wun T. Reich E. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2057662286,"Two isoforms of the translation initiation factor eIF4G, eIF4GI and eIF4GII, have been described in eukaryotic cells. The exact function of each isoform during the initiation of protein synthesis is still under investigation. We have developed an efficient and reliable method of expressing poliovirus 2Apro, which differentially proteolyzes eIF4GI and eIF4GII in a time- and dose-dependent manner. This system is based on the electroporation of an in vitro transcribed mRNA that contains the encephalomyocarditis virus internal ribosome entry site followed by the sequence of poliovirus 2Apro. In contrast to HeLa cells, expression of this protease in BHK-21 cells induces delayed hydrolysis kinetics of eIF4GI with respect to eIF4GII. Moreover, under these conditions the polyadenylate binding protein is not cleaved. Interestingly, translation of de novo synthesized luciferase mRNA is highly dependent on eIF4GI integrity, whereas ongoing translation is inhibited at the same time as eIF4GII cleavage. Moreover, reinitiation of a preexisting mRNA translation after polysome run-off is dependent on the integrity of eIF4GII. Notably, de novo translation of heat shock protein 70 mRNA depends little on eIF4GI integrity but is more susceptible to eIF4GII hydrolysis. Finally, translation of an mRNA containing encephalomyocarditis virus internal ribosome entry site when the two isoforms of eIF4G are differentially hydrolyzed has been examined.

The initiation of translation is a major target for the regulation of gene expression in eukaryotic cells. A number of initiation factors participate in this process leading to the interaction of the small ribosomal subunit with mRNA. The eukaryotic initiation factor 4F (eIF4F) 3The abbreviations used are: eIF, eukaryotic initiation factor; PV, poliovirus; EMCV, encephalomyocarditis virus; IRES, internal ribosome entry site; Hsp70, heat shock protein 70; PABP, poly(A)-binding protein; Luc, luciferase; VVT7, vaccinia virus T7; RT, reverse transcription; hpe, hours post-electroporation; ActD, actinomycin D. 3The abbreviations used are: eIF, eukaryotic initiation factor; PV, poliovirus; EMCV, encephalomyocarditis virus; IRES, internal ribosome entry site; Hsp70, heat shock protein 70; PABP, poly(A)-binding protein; Luc, luciferase; VVT7, vaccinia virus T7; RT, reverse transcription; hpe, hours post-electroporation; ActD, actinomycin D. plays a central role in the early steps of protein synthesis. eIF4F is composed of three polypeptides: eIF4E, eIF4A, and eIF4G (1Gingras A.C. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 913-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1732) Google Scholar, 2Prevot D. Darlix J.L. Ohlmann T. Biol. Cell. 2003; 95: 141-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). eIF4E is the cap binding subunit. eIF4A is an RNA helicase which together with eIF4B unwinds the secondary structure present at the 5′ end of mRNAs. eIF4G is a scaffolding protein that physically links the cap structure and the poly(A) tail of mRNAs with the small ribosomal subunit by means of its interaction with eIF4E, poly(A)-binding protein (PABP), and eIF3. In addition, eIF4G interacts with other cellular and viral proteins involved in the regulation of translation (2Prevot D. Darlix J.L. Ohlmann T. Biol. Cell. 2003; 95: 141-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). There are two isoforms of eIF4G in mammalian cells known as eIF4GI and eIF4GII that are 46% identical in their primary amino acid sequence. It has been proposed that these two isoforms possess similar biochemical activities and are functionally interchangeable (2Prevot D. Darlix J.L. Ohlmann T. Biol. Cell. 2003; 95: 141-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). eIF4G contains three domains of a similar size: (i) the N-terminal region, which contains the eIF4E and PABP binding sites, which are needed for cap and poly(A) recognition (3Imataka H.

Two eIF4A interaction sites have been found in eIF4G, located in the middle and C-terminal domain, respectively (8Korneeva N.L. Lamphear B.J. Hennigan F.L. Merrick W.C. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2872-2879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Thus, eIF4G is essential for coordinating a number of components of the translation machinery to assemble the initiation complex. Infection of mammalian cells with most cytolytic animal viruses induces a marked inhibition of host transcription and translation. Many viruses have evolved mechanisms that employ viral proteases to manipulate the host translational machinery to maximize the selective translation of viral mRNAs compared with endogenous host transcripts (9Schneider R.J. Mohr I. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 130-136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Although it was found some time ago that picornavirus infection induces a marked shutoff of host protein synthesis, the mechanisms involved are still being investigated. Previous reports revealed that hydrolysis of eIF4GI, which composes most of the total eIF4G (10Kuyumcu-Martinez N.M. Joachims M. Lloyd R.E. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 2062-2074Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 2Prevot D. Darlix J.L. Ohlmann T. Biol. Cell. 2003; 95: 141-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), is not sufficient to fully inhibit host translation (11Bonneau A.M. Sonenberg N. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 986-991Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Irurzun A. Sanchez-Palomino S. Novoa I. Carrasco L. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7453-7460Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Keiper B.D. Rhoads R.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 395-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Proteolysis kinetics of eIF4GII were delayed with respect to cleavage of eIF4GI in poliovirus (PV)- and human rhinovirus-infected cells. In this regard disappearance of intact eIF4GII correlated with the abrogation of host translation in PV- and rhinovirus-infected and apoptotic cells (14Gradi A. Svitkin Y.V. Imataka H. Sonenberg N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11089-11094Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 15Marissen W.E. Gradi A. Sonenberg N. Lloyd R.E.

Virol. 1999; 73: 3467-3472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cleavage of both eIF4GI and eIF4GII strongly blocked the initiation of de novo synthesized mRNAs (17Novoa I. Carrasco L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2445-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In addition, PV and Coxsackievirus 2Apro and 3Cpro are able to cleave PABP during infection (10Kuyumcu-Martinez N.M. Joachims M. Lloyd R.E. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 2062-2074Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been reported that hydrolysis of PABP by 3Cpro in the absence of eIF4G degradation blocks the translation of endogenous mRNAs in HeLa cell extracts (18Kuyumcu-Martinez N.M. Van Eden M.E. Younan P. Lloyd R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1779-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). 3Cpro preferentially hydrolyzed the PABP associated with the translational machinery, although the hydrolysis of PABP did not correlate with the shutoff of cellular translation in PV-infected cells (10Kuyumcu-Martinez N.M. Joachims M. Lloyd R.E. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 2062-2074Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Therefore, the individual contribution of eIF4GI, eIF4GII, and PABP proteolysis to the shutoff of cellular protein synthesis needs further investigation. We describe an effective system based on PV 2Apro that induces the differential cleavage of eIF4GI and eIF4GII without affecting PABP. Hydrolysis of eIF4GI by 2Apro occurs before proteolysis of eIF4GII in HeLa cells, whereas the opposite is true for BHK cells. The effect of differential degradation of each eIF4G isoform in the translation of cellular mRNAs in culture cells has been examined. Cell Cultures—HeLa and BHK-21 (baby hamster kidney) cells were grown at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum and nonessential amino acids. HeLa clone X1/5 cells express luciferase (Luc) in a tetracycline-dependent manner (19Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4214) Google Scholar, 17Novoa I. Carrasco L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2445-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Repression of Luc gene transcription was obtained with 20 ng/ml tetracycline in the culture medium (17Novoa I. Carrasco L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2445-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Plasmids—The plasmids pKs-Luc, pTM1-Luc, pTM1–2C, and pTM1–2A and the plasmids pTM1–2AG60R, pTM1–2AG121E, pTM1–2AD135N, and pTM1–2AV119M, which encodes a PV 2Apro mutant, have been described previously (20Barco A. Feduchi E. Carrasco L. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 2383-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 21Ventoso I. Barco A. Carrasco L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27960-27967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). RNA Transcription—The in vitro transcription was carried out with T7 polymerase (Promega) according to the indications of the manufacturer and the corresponding plasmid as a template. In vitro polyadenylation was performed with poly(A) polymerase (Invitrogen). The mRNA was purified using the chroma spin columns kit (BD Biosciences). The amount of mRNA was analyzed with the NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer. Transfection of HeLa and BHK-21 Cells—HeLa cells were electroporated with in vitro synthesized mRNAs. Subconfluent cells were harvested, washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and resuspended in PBS at a density of about 2.5 × 106 cells/ml. Fifty μl of transcription mixture (Promega) with the amounts of RNA indicated in each figure legend were added to 0.8 ml of cell suspension, and the mixtures were transferred to 4-mm electroporation cuvettes (Bio-Rad). Electroporation was performed at room temperature by one 350-V, 975-microfarad pulse using a Gene Pulser apparatus (Bio-Rad). BHK-21 cells were electroporated as previously described (22Castello A. Sanz M.A. Molina S. Carrasco L. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 355: 942-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Coupled infection/transfection by vaccinia virus T7/pTM1 system has been described previously (23Alvarez E. Menendez-Arias L. Carrasco L. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 12392-12400Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Protein synthesis was analyzed by metabolic labeling with 50 μCi of [35S]Met-[35S]Cys/ml (Promix; Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h followed by SDS-PAGE, fluorography, and autoradiography. The integrity of translation initiation factors was analyzed by Western blotting with anti-eIF4GI antisera raised against peptides derived from the N- and C-terminal regions of human eIF4GI at a 1:1000 dilution, rabbit antisera raised against the N-terminal and C-terminal region of eIF4GII (a gift from N. Sonenberg, McGill University, Montreal, Canada) at a 1:500 dilution, and mouse monoclonal anti-PABP antibody (Abcam) at a 1:250 dilution or anti-eIF4A at a 1:50 dilution (a gift from Dr. H. Trachsel, Institute for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Berne, Switzerland). Heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) was detected using rabbit anti-Hsp70 antisera at a 1:200 dilution (Santa Cruz). Anti-rabbit and anti-mouse immunoglobulin G antibodies coupled to peroxidase (Pierce) were used at a 1:10,000 dilution. Percentage of protein synthesis and percentage of intact eIF4G were determined by densitometric scanning of the corresponding protein band. Analysis of mRNA by Real-time RT-PCR—β-Actin, Luc, and Hsp70 mRNA levels in transfected HeLa cells were determined by real-time quantitative reverse transcription RT-PCR. Total RNA was extracted from 2 × 105 cells at the times indicated in each figure using the RNeasy commercial kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations (22Castello A. Sanz M.A. Molina S. Carrasco L. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 355: 942-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Analysis of the actin mRNA level was performed using the Hs 99999903-m1 assay, whereas the Hsp70 mRNA level was estimated with the Hs00359163-s1 assay. As a control, 18 S rRNA was measured using the Hs 99999901-m1 assay (Applied Biosystems). In the case of Luc mRNA, primers and probe were designed and provided by Applied Biosystems. The amount of the different mRNAs was determined by taking into consideration the 18 S rRNA levels. RT-PCR was carried out in 20 μlof reaction mixture containing 0.9 μm concentrations of each primer and 0.25 μm TaqMan probe. Reverse transcription was performed at 25 °C for 10 min and 37 °C for 2 h. Afterward, PCR amplification was started by incubation at 95 °C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min using the ABI PRISM 7000 (Applied Biosystems). Data analysis was carried out using the SDS-7000 software (Version 1.1). The corresponding figures were plotted with the 95% confidence intervals from three independent experiments as error bars. Measurement of Luc Activity—HeLa X1/5 and HeLa cells electroporated with the in vitro synthesized Luc mRNAs were lysed in a buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100, 25 mm glycylglycine (pH 7.8), and 1 mm dithiothreitol at different post-electroporation times. Luc activity was determined using a Monolight 2010 apparatus (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory) as described previously (23Alvarez E. Menendez-Arias L. Carrasco L. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 12392-12400Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). S.D. determined from three independent experiments are indicated as error bars in each figure. Transfection of HeLa Cells with mRNAs Containing the PV 2A Sequence—We initially constructed a plasmid that encoded for the encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) internal ribosome entry site (IRES) followed by the PV 2Apro sequence (pTM1–2A) (21Ventoso I. Barco A. Carrasco L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27960-27967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In vitro transcription from this plasmid leads to the synthesis of EMC-2A mRNA. Electroporation of 9 μg of this mRNA was sufficient to drastically inhibit translation in HeLa cells accompanied by hydrolysis of eIF4G (Fig. 1, A and B). The cleavage products were similar to those found after transfection of cells with pTM1–2A plasmid and infection with recombinant vaccinia virus T7 but differed from the eIF4G peptides produced by caspase-3 activity in apoptotic cells (data not shown). Notably, PABP remained intact (Fig. 1C), whereas potent hydrolysis was found using this antibody in cells transfected with pTM1–3C, pTM1–2A, or pTM1-HIV-1PR (24Alvarez E. Castello A. Menendez-Arias L. Carrasco L. Biochem. J. 2006; 396: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In this regard, PV 2Apro exhibited low proteolytic activity against PABP (25Joachims M. Van Breugel P.C. Lloyd R.E. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 718-727Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Kuyumcu-Martinez N.M. Joachims M. Lloyd R.E. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 2062-2074Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Two lower polypeptides were found in control as well as in 2Apro-expressing cells. These bands could be endogenous PABP degradation products or proteins that unspecifically immuno-react with the antibody against PABP used (Fig. 1C). Nevertheless, these polypeptides do not disappear in the presence of proteases that specifically hydrolyzed PABP (24Alvarez E. Castello A. Menendez-Arias L. Carrasco L. Biochem. J. 2006; 396: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This method yielded low levels of 2Apro, since this protease was not detected by autoradiography or Western blotting with specific antibodies (data not shown). The IRES region from EMCV confers a high translability to the mRNAs, and so transfection of EMC-2A could compete with cellular mRNAs, leading to the inhibition of host translation. To test this possibility, HeLa cells were transfected with mRNAs that encode for inactive point mutants of PV 2Apro (M2, G60R; M15, G121E) (21Ventoso I. Barco A. Carrasco L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27960-27967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). These mRNAs did not affect the level of host protein synthesis as compared with control cells, and both isoforms of eIF4G remained intact at 8 h post-electroporation (hpe) (Fig. 1, A and B). These data suggest that the inhibition of host mRNA translation and the modifications of eIF4G are, indeed, due to the synthesis of PV 2Apro and not to competition from the transfected mRNAs. Transfection of HeLa X1/5 Cells with EMC-2A; Effect on Translation of Preexisting and de Novo-synthesized mRNAs—Previous observations have shown that eIF4GI is preferentially hydrolyzed as compared with eIF4GII in PV-infected HeLa cells (14Gradi A. Svitkin Y.V. Imataka H. Sonenberg N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11089-11094Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Our aim was to establish conditions under which these two isoforms were differentially cleaved in the absence of PABP hydrolysis in culture cells. We wanted to analyze the effect of differential eIF4GI and eIF4GII hydrolysis on the initiation of translation of de novo synthesized mRNAs as compared with the translation of mRNAs already engaged in the protein synthesis machinery. For this, we used Luc inducible HeLa X1/5 cells (19Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4214) Google Scholar). These cells were electroporated with different amounts of in vitro transcribed EMC-2A mRNA: 1, 2, 4, or 9 μg. As controls, cells were electroporated with transcription buffer or with 9 μg of EMC-2C mRNA. During electroporation, tetracycline was removed from the culture medium to trigger Luc mRNA synthesis. Host protein synthesis, Luc expression, integrity of initiation factors, and mRNA levels were analyzed at 4, 6, and 8 hpe (Fig. 2 and supplemental Fig. 10). The 2Apro expression induced a time- and dose-dependent inhibition of host protein synthesis (Fig. 2A). To ensure that similar amounts of proteins were loaded in each lane of the gel, the level of eIF4A was also estimated (Fig. 2B). eIF4GI and eIF4GII were proteolyzed in a time- and dose-dependent manner. As expected, eIF4GII was cleaved by 2Apro with delayed kinetics as compared with eIF4GI hydrolysis (Fig. 2B and see Fig. 6C) (14Gradi A. Svitkin Y.V. Imataka H. Sonenberg N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11089-11094Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Interestingly, PABP remained intact during this assay (Fig. 2C). Significant hydrolysis of eIF4GI accompanied by partial cleavage of eIF4GII had only a limited effect on host translation of preexisting mRNAs (Fig. 2, A and B, second and eighth lanes). However, extensive inhibition of ongoing protein synthesis was observed when both eIF4G isoforms were hydrolyzed by 2Apro (Fig. 2, A and B). Protein synthesis was not shut off by a reduction in the total amount of preexisting mRNAs since significant differences in the level of actin mRNA were not observed in these cells (supplemental Fig. 10). These findings indicate that a strong abrogation of translation of preexisting mRNAs takes place when 2Apro extensively cleaves both eIF4GI and eIF4GII. Moreover, PABP degradation is not essential for this inhibition to occur.FIGURE 6Translation of Hsp70 mRNA in HeLa cells containing the two isoforms of eIF4G differentially cleaved. HeLa cells were electroporated with 1, 2, 4, or 9 μg of EMC-2A, 9 μg of EMC-2C, or transcription buffer. At 5 hpe, cells were incubated at 42 °C for 3 h. Proteins were labeled from 3 to 4 or from 7 to 8 hpe. A, analysis of protein synthesis by SDS-PAGE, fluorography, and autoradiography. Ac, actin.

C, comparative representation of the level of intact eIF4GI and eIF4GII with the translation of de novo synthesized Luc or Hsp70 mRNAs and actin synthesis. These data were obtained from five independent experiments including the results shown in Figs. 2, A, B, and D, and 5, A and B. hpHS, hours post-heat shock.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Luc mRNA translation was measured to analyze the effect on translation of de novo synthesized mRNAs when eIF4GI and eIF4GII are differentially hydrolyzed. Synthesis of Luc mRNAs was not significantly affected by the expression of PV 2Apro (supplemental Fig. 10) (17Novoa I. Carrasco L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2445-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Notably, 1 μg of EMC-2A mRNA sufficed to abrogate Luc mRNA translation (Fig. 2D). This amount of EMC-2A mRNA induced efficient cleavage of eIF4GI but only partially hydrolyzed eIF4GII (Fig. 2B, second, seventh, and fourteenth lanes). These results suggest that translation of de novo synthesized mRNAs is more affected by eIF4GI proteolysis than mRNAs engaged in the translation machinery. Because the amounts of actin and Luc mRNAs were similar in transfected cells regardless of the EMC-2A dose employed (supplemental Fig. 10), the inhibition of actin or Luc synthesis could not be ascribed to a decrease in the level of these mRNAs. Translation of de novo synthesized Luc mRNA was more dependent on eIF4GI integrity than preexisting actin mRNAs. To determine whether eIF4G is required to translate preexisting Luc mRNA, tetracycline was removed from the culture medium 4 h before electroporation. Thus, Luc mRNA started to be synthesized before transfection of EMC-2A mRNA. Cells were then electroporated with 0.1, 0.5, 1, 3, and 9 μg of EMC-2A, and actinomycin D (ActD), an inhibitor of transcription (26Maeda Y. Nunomura K. Ohtsubo E. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), was immediately added at a final concentration of 0.5 μg/ml. Luciferase activity and eIF4G integrity were measured at 0 and 4 hpe in ActD-treated as well as untreated cells (Fig. 3A). eIF4GI was significantly hydrolyzed at 0.1 μg of EMC-2A mRNA. However, eIF4GII was only proteolyzed in cells electroporated with 9 μg of EMC-2A (Fig. 3B). Transfection of 0.1 μg of EMC-2A was sufficient to fully block Luc synthesis in untreated cells, whereas 9 μg of this mRNA was required to inhibit Luc synthesis in ActD treated cells (Fig. 3A). Therefore, hydrolysis of eIF4GI is sufficient to inhibit Luc synthesis in cells that synthesize Luc mRNA continuously. However, hydrolysis of both isoforms of eIF4G is required to fully block Luc mRNA translation when Luc mRNAs were engaged in the translation machinery. Involvement of eIF4GI and eIF4GII in the Translation of Transfected Luc mRNAs—The next step was to determine the extent of translation of different mRNAs transfected in cells where both isoforms of eIF4G had been differentially cleaved. This was done by co-electroporating HeLa cells with different amounts of EMC-2A and 9 μg of different Luc mRNAs: capped (cap-Luc), capped, and polyadenylated (cap-Luc-poly(A)) (Fig. 4A), uncapped (Luc) or uncapped and polyadenylated (Lucpoly(A)) (supplemental Fig. 11). In this assay PV 2Apro was synthesized at the same time as Luc mRNA was engaged in translation. Moreover, using this Luc mRNA transfection method, we could analyze the Luc activity derived from the translation of this mRNA over time. Interestingly, this mRNA transfection method proved very reliable given that a similar amount of Luc mRNA was detected in cap-Luc transfected cells at 2 hpe regardless of the EMC-2A dose used (Fig. 4B). Luc activity and the integrity of initiation factors were analyzed at 4, 6, and 8 hpe. Total hydrolysis of eIF4GI with partial cleavage of eIF4GII was induced by electroporation of HeLa cells with 1 μg of EMC-2A, whereas total proteolysis of both isoforms of eIF4G was achieved in cells electroporated with 9 μg of this mRNA. Cleavage of PABP did not occur in either case (data not shown). Luc activity increased up to 6 hpe in cells electroporated with cap-Luc in the absence of EMC-2A mRNA. Partial inhibition of Luc activity was detected in cells co-electroporated with 1 μgof EMC-2A, whereas in cells co-electroporated with a higher amount of this mRNA (9 μg), Luc activity was strongly inhibited (Fig. 4C). Expression of cap-Luc-poly(A) was 6-fold higher than that obtained with cap-Luc and 30-fold higher than with Luc-Poly(A) at 6 hpe (Fig. 4, C and D, and supplemental Fig. 11). In the case of cap-Luc-poly(A), Luc activity increased with time, indicating longer-lasting stability than cap-Luc. Cap-Luc-poly(A) mRNA translation was partially affected (about 30–60% inhibition) in cells co-electroporated with 1 μg of EMC-2A. Transfection of 9 μg of this mRNA completely repressed Luc activity (Fig. 4D). As expected, uncapped Luc mRNA was not translated in HeLa cells (supplemental Fig. 11). The extent of translation of uncapped and polyadenylated Luc mRNA observed in control cells was small. The expression of 2Apro from EMC-2A mRNA provoked partial inhibition of Luc activity in a dose-independent manner (supplemental Fig. 11). These findings lend support to the idea that cleavage of eIF4GI partially affects translation of mRNAs present in polysomes and are in agreement with the data on actin synthesis presented in Fig. 2. In contrast, cleavage of both isoforms of eIF4G strongly blocked the translation of these mRNAs (Fig. 4, C and D). Moreover, proteolysis of eIF4GI and eIF4GII in cells containing intact PABP is sufficient to abrogate translation of capped and polyadenylated mRNAs (Fig. 4D). Translation of an IRES-containing mRNA under Conditions of eIF4G Cleavage—The mRNAs of picornavirus are uncapped and polyadenylated. The 5′-untranslated region of these mRNAs allows recruitment of the 40 S ribosomal subunit under conditions in which the eIF4F complex is disrupted by viral protein activity (2Prevot D. Darlix J.L. Ohlmann T. Biol. Cell. 2003; 95: 141-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Translation of picornavirus IRES-containing mRNAs is enhanced by the presence of a poly(A) tail at its 3′ end (27Michel Y.M. Borman A.M. Paulous S. Kean K.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4097-4109Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 28Svitkin Y.V. Imataka H. Khaleghpour K. Kahvejian A. Liebig H.D. Sonenberg N. RNA. 2001; 7: 1743-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). EMCV IRES has been classified as type II on the basis of its primary sequence and secondary structure conservation and its requirements for optimal internal initiation in vitro (29Borman A.M. Bailly J.L. Girard M. Kean K.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3656-3663Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). We, therefore, used the IRES of EMCV to investigate the effect of differential cleavage of eIF4GI and eIF4GII in IRES-driven translation in transfected cells. Thus, two mRNAs were obtained by in vitro transcription from the pTM1-Luc plasmid. One mRNA contained the 5′-untranslated region of EMCV followed by the Luc gene (EMC-Luc), whereas in the other mRNA, the poly(A) tail was added by in vitro polyadenylation (EMC-Luc-poly(A)) (Fig. 5A).

We have used molecular genetic means to remove regions nonessential for catalytic activity from the amino- and the carboxyl-terminal regions as well as characterized the functional regions involved in GlcUA-transferase activity and in GlcNAc-transferase activity. Mutation of either one of the two regions containing aspartate-X-aspartate (DXD) residue-containing motifs resulted in complete or substantial loss of heparosan polymerizing activity. However, certain mutant proteins retained only GlcUA-transferase activity while some constructs possessed only GlcNAc-transferase activity. Therefore, it appears that the PmHS1 polypeptide is composed of two types of glycosyltransferases in a single polypeptide as was found for the Pasteurella multocida Type A PmHAS, the hyaluronan synthase that makes the alternating (-β3-GlcNAc-β1,4-GlcUA-1-) polymer. However, there is low amino acid similarity between the PmHAS and PmHS1 enzymes, and the relative placement of the GlcUA-transferase and GlcNAc-transferase domains within the two polypeptides is reversed. Even though the monosaccharide compositions of hyaluronan and heparosan are identical, such differences in the sequences of the catalysts are expected because the PmHAS employs only inverting sugar transfer mechanisms whereas PmHS1 requires both retaining and inverting mechanisms.

Rec. 1987; 121: 382-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). This microbe produces an extracellular coating of polysaccharide, called a capsule, composed of heparosan (N-acetyl-heparosan or unsulfated, unepimerized heparin) (2DeAngelis P.L. Gunay N.S. Toida T. Mao W.J. Linhardt R.J. Carbohydr. Res. 2002; 337: 1547-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) to enhance infection. It is thought that the capsule confers resistance to nonspecific host immunity and perhaps mediates adhesion to certain host cells. In general, most capsules are antigenic, but glycosaminoglycan polysaccharide capsules are a special case because they closely resemble the host molecules and thus may serve as molecular camouflage (3DeAngelis P.L. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 9R-16RCrossref PubMed Google Scholar).Two heparosan synthase (PmHS) 2The abbreviations used are: PmHS1, Pasteurella heparosan synthase 1; PmHAS, Pasteurella hyaluronan synthase; HA, hyaluronan or hyaluronic acid; GlcUA, glucuronic acid; GlcNAc, N-acetylglucosamine. 2The abbreviations used are: PmHS1, Pasteurella heparosan synthase 1; PmHAS, Pasteurella hyaluronan synthase; HA, hyaluronan or hyaluronic acid; GlcUA, glucuronic acid; GlcNAc, N-acetylglucosamine. enzymes have been identified from P. multocida that catalyze the formation of the repeating disaccharide (-4GlcNAcα1–4GlcUAβ1-) units of the heparosan chain. P. multocida Type D strains encode the 617-residue PmHS1 enzyme in a typical Gram-negative bacterial Type 2 capsule biosynthesis locus (4DeAngelis P.L. White C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7209-7213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Another isozyme, the 651-residue PmHS2, is found in many Type A, D, and F strains (5DeAngelis P.L. White C.L. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 8529-8532Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar); the genes are ∼73% identical. The gene encoding PmHS2 is found in a different region of the chromosome not associated with typical carbohydrate biosynthesis genes and may be expressed during some stage of infection, but its role is not yet known.The dual action PmHS1 and PmHS2 are complex enzymes because the UDP sugar precursors are α-linked and therefore these single polypeptides must employ a retaining mechanism to form the α-linkages as well as an inverting mechanism to form the β-linkages. For inverting glycosyltransferases, SN2 nucleophilic attack results in β-linkages. For retaining glycosyltransferases, theoretically either a sterically directed SNi-like (“internal return”) nucleophilic attack on one face or, perhaps less likely, a SN2 double displacement reaction (with a potential covalent enzyme-substrate intermediate) occurs to form α-linkages (6Negishi M. Dong J. Darden T.A. Pedersen L.G. Pedersen L.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 303: 393-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar).Escherichia coli K5 is another bacterium known to produce heparosan (7Vann W.F. Schmidt M.A. Jann B. Jann K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 116: 359-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), but this microbe employs multiple proteins to produce the chemically identical polymer. The K5 antigen region 2 encodes four proteins designated KfiA to KfiD involved in synthesizing the sugar chain (8Petit C. Rigg G.P. Pazzani C. Smith A. Sieberth V. Stevens M. Boulnois G. Jann K. Roberts I.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 611-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). KfiA was discovered to act as an α4-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (9Hodson N. Griffiths G. Cook N. Pourhossein M. Gottfridson E. Lind T. Lidholt K. Roberts I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27311-27315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) whereas KfiC is the β4-glucuronyltransferase (although initially the latter was erroneously reported to be a dual action enzyme responsible for heparosan polymerization (10Griffiths G. Cook N.J. Gottfridson E. Lind T. Lidholt K. Roberts I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11752-11757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar)). Therefore, in E. coli the formation of the heparosan polymer occurs by the concerted action of KfiA and KfiC proteins. In addition, KfiB, a protein with a potential scaffolding role, also appears to be required (9Hodson N. Griffiths G. Cook N. Pourhossein M. Gottfridson E. Lind T. Lidholt K. Roberts I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27311-27315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). KfiD is a UDP glucose dehydrogenase that catalyzes the formation of UDP-GlcUA, a necessary precursor for the K5 polysaccharide.The PmHS1 enzyme contains sequences that align with both the KfiA and the KfiC proteins. Site-directed mutagenesis studies suggest that the enzymatic activity of KfiA is dependent upon the acidic amino acid motif 79DDD81 that is conserved in certain glycosyltransferases (9Hodson N. Griffiths G. Cook N. Pourhossein M. Gottfridson E. Lind T. Lidholt K. Roberts I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27311-27315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Conservative mutations were made changing certain aspartic acid residues (D) to glutamic acid (E) along with non-conservative mutations substituting aspartic acid with alanine (A). Both conservative and non-conservative mutations abolished N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase activity. Similarly, mutation of any one of several aspartic acid residues in KfiC resulted in total loss of the relevant GlcUA-transferase activity (10Griffiths G. Cook N.J. Gottfridson E. Lind T. Lidholt K. Roberts I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11752-11757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). These data, however, are not definitive because the mutagenized enzymes did not retain any activity, and it is difficult to draw conclusions from any inactive enzyme because of the potential for global misfolding.The P. multocida Type A hyaluronan synthase (PmHAS) is a dual action glycosyltransferase (11DeAngelis P.L. Jing W. Drake R.R. Achyuthan A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8454-8458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) that forms the hyaluronan polymer composed of (-3GlcNAcβ1–4GlcUAβ1-) repeats. Even though the PmHAS is not very similar at the amino acid sequence level to the PmHS1, both enzymes have the ability to use the same UDP sugar precursors. In this report, we characterize PmHS1 and give evidence for two glycosyltransferase sites in one polypeptide chain.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials and PmHS1 Constructs—Reagents were purchased either from Sigma or Fisher (Pittsburgh, PA) unless otherwise noted. Custom oligosaccharides were from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA).Various PmHS1 truncations (missing 45, 77, 118, 141, or 191 residues from the amino terminus or 50 residues from the carboxyl terminus) were made by PCR using the template (4DeAngelis P.L. White C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7209-7213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and suitable primers with new start or stop codons using the pET Blue-1 AccepTor vector system (Novagen, Madison, WI). The PCR parameters using Taq polymerase were: 1 cycle of 95 °C/2 min; 10 cycles of 94 °C/30 s, 52 °C/30 s, 72 °C/2.5 min; 1 cycle of 72 °C/7 min. The amplicon with A base overhangs was then ligated into the AccepTor vector and transformed into E. coli Top 10 cells (Invitrogen). Transformant colonies selected on ampicillin were screened for directionality by PCR and by restriction digest. The plasmid for producing truncated PmHS1 protein was transformed into E. coli Tuner (Novagen), a host with T7 RNA polymerase, for protein production.The pBAD/TOPO ThioFusion vector (Invitrogen) was employed to make various mutant forms of PmHS1. The DNA encoding both the full-length (617-amino acid) PmHS1 and the amino-terminal truncation derivatives missing 45 or 77 amino acids were PCR amplified as above and then fused to the thioredoxin gene for increased protein expression levels and higher stability. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed with the QuikChange method (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and pairs of custom primers with parameters of 1 cycle 95 °C/30 s, 16 cycles 95 °C/30 s, 55 °C/1 min, 68 °C/13 min. A panel of mutants with a variety of substituting residues was created simultaneously by utilizing primers with mixed bases at desired positions. All constructs were verified by automated sequencing of both DNA strands (Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation DNA sequencing facility).Enzyme Preparation—Protein preparation was performed by a cold lysozyme/sonication method using 0.1 mm mercaptoethanol in the sonication steps (12DeAngelis P.L. Weigel P.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9033-9039Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Briefly, the frozen E. coli expression host cell pellets were resuspended in a sucrose buffer, treated with ethylenediamine(tetraacetic acid)/lysozyme to weaken the cell walls, and sonicated. MgCl2 (6 mm) was added, and lysate was DNase/RNase treated. The soluble protein was separated from the membrane portion by ultracentrifugation (200,000 × g, 1 h). The fraction containing soluble protein was collected, and membrane pellets were resuspended. Both fractions were analyzed for the ability to transfer UDP sugar precursors into a heparosan chain.The concentration of total protein was measured by the Bradford assay (Pierce) using a bovine serum albumin standard. The level of PmHS1 polypeptide in any given preparation was assayed by Western blot (rabbit anti-peptide polyclonal antibody against KGDIIFFQDSDDVCHHERIER, residues 173–193 of PmHS1 followed by Protein A-alkaline phosphatase conjugate) (5DeAngelis P.L. White C.L. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 8529-8532Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Basically, a titration of wild-type sequence PmHS1 in a given vector system was employed to normalize the expression levels of the corresponding mutant proteins; the immunoreactivity of the wild-type PmHS1 sequence version was set to 100%.Enzyme Assays—Three types of radiolabeled sugar incorporation assays were employed: (a) dual sugar incorporation for measuring the polymerization of long heparosan chains (Reaction 1), and single sugar addition for measuring either (b) the GlcUA-transferase activity (Reaction 2) or (c) the GlcNAc-transferase activity (Reaction 3). The heparosan polysaccharide acceptor (noted as X in Reactions 1, 2, 3), which greatly stimulates polymerization activity and is essential for single sugar transferase assays (only polymers greater than ∼14 saccharides long remain at the origin of the paper chromatograms), was used in most radiolabeled sugar incorporation activity assays as noted. n UDP−[3H]GlcNAc+n UDP−[14C]GlcUA+X→([3H]GlcNAc−[14C]GlcUA)n−X+2n UDP (Eq. 1) n UDP−[14C]GlcUA+n X→n ([14C]GlcA)−X+n UDP(Eq. 2) n UDP−[3H]GlcNAc+n X→n ([3H]GlcNAc)−X+n UDP(Eq. 3) The 55-kDa heparosan acceptor was obtained by extensive ultrasonication of the Pasteurella Type D polysaccharide (4DeAngelis P.L. White C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7209-7213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar).Polymerization reactions (50 μl) typically contained 1.2 μgof heparosan polysaccharide acceptor, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 0.2 mm UDP-(3H)GlcNAc (0.08–0.1 μCi; PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and 0.2 mm UDP-(14C)-GlcUA (0.08–0.1 μCi; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for times ranging from 30 min to 4 h and then stopped by adding SDS (final concentration 2%). The radioactive polymer was separated from the other reaction precursors by descending paper chromatography (Whatman 3 m developed with 65:35 ethanol/1 m ammonium acetate, pH 5.5). After overnight development, the origin of the paper strip (sugars >∼14 monosaccharides in length) was cut and eluted with water. The incorporation of radiolabeled sugars into the heparosan chain as measured by liquid scintillation counting using BioSafe II scintillation mixture (Research Products International, Chicago, IL). All assays were performed in duplicate, and the averaged data values are presented. All parameters for the single radiolabeled sugar incorporation activity assay are the same as for the polymerization assay above except that only one UDP sugar substrate (i.e. either UDP-GlcNAc or UDP-GlcUA) is added to a particular reaction.The Km values of the dual action enzyme thioredoxin-PmHS1 for both of its substrates, UDP-GlcUA and UDP-Glc-NAc, were analyzed by titrating one UDP sugar donor and maintaining the other radiolabeled UDP sugar at a saturating, constant value. Reactions were similar to the typical polymerization assay, except the mixtures contained 2.2 μg of heparosan polysaccharide acceptor, 1 mm of the constant UDP sugar with 0.08–0.1 μCi of radiolabel, a titration (0–1.5 mm) of the other UDP sugar, and thioredoxin-PmHS1 (120 μg of total protein). The reactions were incubated for 8 min. Less than 5% of the substrates were consumed, and the enzyme concentration was in the linear range. Data were fit to a rectangular hyperbolic curve with SigmaPlot software (Rockware, Golden, CO) as well as analyzed on Hanes-Woolf plots; both methods gave very similar Km values. The Km value was the average of three independent determinations.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONCharacterization Of Native Sequence and Truncated PmHS1—Both the soluble and the membrane-bound portions of the protein preparations from recombinant E. coli containing the overexpressed wild-type sequence PmHS1 were analyzed for polymerizing activity. The highest amount of activity for the full-length recombinant heparosan synthase appeared to be present in the soluble fraction (∼80% soluble activity versus ∼20% membrane-bound activity). This finding may suggest that without the putative polysaccharide transporter machinery (13Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 39-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar) (most E. coli K12-derived laboratory strains are thought to be missing the original capsular biosynthesis locus) the majority of the PmHS1 polypeptide floats free in the cytoplasm or its interaction with the membrane is weak. Therefore, the soluble portion of protein preparations derived from subsequent constructs was tested for the sugar transferase activity.Recombinant versions of PmHS1 truncated to delete amino acid residues from either the amino or the carboxyl terminus of the protein were constructed. The 617-amino acid protein sequence (4DeAngelis P.L. White C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7209-7213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) was first analyzed to avoid the potential disruption of predicted stretches of α helical secondary structures that might globally disrupt the structure and function of the protein (us.expasy.org/, Network Protein Sequence Analysis). Truncations of the amino terminus were designed in which 45, 77, 118, 141, and 191 amino acids were deleted. A truncation was also designed to delete 50 residues of the carboxyl terminus (residues 567 through 617).The truncated mutants missing 45 or 77 residues of the amino terminus were visualized by Western blot to have protein expression levels of ∼20% of the expression levels of the wild-type PmHS1 protein. The PmHS1 truncation mutants missing 118, 141, or 191 amino acids of the amino terminus were analyzed by Western blot and found to have very poor protein expression levels and formed smaller degradation products in addition to the predicted target protein. The carboxylterminal-truncated PmHS1 protein was seen to have many protein degradation products and ∼10% expression of the intact target protein. Further delineation of the required residues at the carboxyl terminus was hindered by the mutant protein instability.The catalytic ability of all mutants was normalized for relative specific activity (moles radiolabeled sugar monosaccharide incorporated into the heparosan chain divided by the amount of specific immunoreactivity relative to the wild-type sequence PmHS1 as assayed by Western blot). Many truncated PmHS1 enzymes had reduced levels of polymerization activity as seen by dual radiolabeled sugar incorporation activity assay (Table 1), but nonetheless authentic heparosan chains were formed in these cases. In summary, at least residues 78–567 appear to be required for heparosan polymerization.TABLE 1Polymerization activity of various truncated PmHS1 proteinsPmHS1 constructGlcNAc-transferase relative specific activityGlcUA-transferase relative specific activity%%Wild-type100100Vector<1<1Δ45 AA N-terminus3550Δ77 AA N-terminus1020Δ118 AA N-terminus<1<1Δ141 AA N-terminus<1<1Δ191 AA N-terminus<1<1Δ50 AA C-terminus420 Open table in a new tab Characterization Of Thioredoxin-PmHS1—The fusion of the thioredoxin protein to the amino terminus of PmHS1 resulted in an enzyme with higher protein expression, stability, and sugar transferase activity than the native sequence protein. The PmHS1 enzyme alone loses enzymatic activity after three to four freeze-thaw cycles and over time in cold storage. In contrast, the thioredoxin-PmHS1 protein retains enzymatic activity when stored at –80 °C for more than 1 year and can withstand multiple (∼20) freeze-thaw cycles.PmHS1 utilizes two UDP sugar substrates for heparosan polymerization. The apparent Km of thioredoxin-PmHS1 for UDP-GlcUA is 90 ± 20 μm whereas the Km for UDP-GlcNAc is 270 ± 30 μm (Fig. 1). The same qualitative difference in Km for the two different UDP sugar substrates is also observed for PmHAS (14Jing W. DeAngelis P.L. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 661-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 15Jing W. DeAngelis P.L. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 883-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The observed maximal velocity (Vmax) was 13 and 6.6 nmol of monosaccharide transfer/min for the GlcUA-transferase and the GlcNAc-transferase, respectively. The molecular mass of the native capsular polysaccharide of P. multocida Type D is ∼250 kDa (2DeAngelis P.L. Gunay N.S. Toida T. Mao W.J. Linhardt R.J. Carbohydr. Res. 2002; 337: 1547-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar); thus, the enzyme is expected to rapidly produce the heparosan chain if sufficient UDP sugars are present.Identification Of Specific Amino Acid Residues Of PmHS1 Involved in Transferase Activity—Site-directed mutations of the heparosan synthase were designed to assess the role of residues potentially involved in transferase activity including (i) the putative DXD motifs (16Breton C. Bettler E. Joziasse D.H. Geremia R.A. Imberty A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 123: 1000-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 17Busch C. Hofmann F. Selzer J. Munro S. Jeckel D. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19566-19572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) and (ii) a conserved QS pair with similarity to other glycosyltransferases. X-ray crystallography of the Bacillus SpsA protein-UDP complex suggests that the DXD motif is involved in binding the metal ion coordinated with the β-phosphate and ribose moiety of the UDP sugar (18Charnock S.J. Davies G.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6380-6385Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), but definitive roles for the other residues are not yet known.The PmHS1 enzyme contains a DXD motif in each of the two distinct regions of the protein corresponding to KfiA and KfiC sequence alignments. As noted previously (4DeAngelis P.L. White C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7209-7213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), an amino-terminal region of PmHS1 is ∼29% identical to a portion of KfiC whereas a carboxyl-terminal region of PmHS1 is ∼27% identical to a portion of KfiA. Therefore, we postulated that mutating only one of the two DXD motifs of the PmHS1 polypeptide would convert a polymerizing dual action enzyme into a single action sugar transferase if the two active sites are relatively independent as in the case of PmHAS, the HA synthase (14Jing W. DeAngelis P.L. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 661-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 15Jing W. DeAngelis P.L. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 883-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar).The mutations for thioredoxin-PmHS1 were designed to change one or two of the aspartates in the DXD motifs into an asparagine; this substitution preserves the overall size and polarity of the side chain but removes the negative charge. These mutants were analyzed both for polymerization activity (dual radiolabeled sugar incorporation assay) and for single sugar transferase activity. All mutants had no detectable or much lower polymerization activity than wild-type PmHS1 (ranging from <1 to ∼3% relative specific activity) but gave a signal in one or the other single radiolabeled sugar incorporation assays (Table 2). Constructs with a mutation of the D445XD447 motif possessed significant GlcUA-transferase activity. On the other hand, constructs with mutation of the D181XD183 possessed GlcNAc-transferase activity. Thus, the DXD sites are important for PmHS1 transferase activity and our hypothesis of an enzyme with two active sites was strengthened. In contrast to PmHAS, the HA synthase, the relative order of the two putative transferase sites within the polypeptide chain is reversed in PmHS1 (Fig. 2).TABLE 2Single sugar addition activity of Thio-PmHS1 DXD mutantsSingle sugar addition assayThio-PmHS1 constructGlcNAc-transferase relative specific activityGlcUA-transferase relative specific activity%%Wild-type100100Vector<1<1D181N30<1D181N,D183N602D445N2540D445N,D447N190 Open table in a new tab FIGURE 2Schematic model of the dual action Pasteurella PmHS1 proteins. A, the regions of synthases that are not essential for catalytic activity are indicated with cross-hatching. Two DXD motifs involved in the two-component transferase (Tase) activities are found in two separate regions of the PmHS1 protein. The region with the QT (residues 118–119) sequence may have a general structural role or be involved in both sugar transfer activities. The approximate extent of the putative GlcUA-transferase and GlcNAc-transferase sites based on sequence alignments with E. coli KfiC and KfiA, respectively, and on our mutation evidence is indicated with arrows. B, the relative order of putative domains within the PmHS1 polypeptide chain is reversed compared with the hyaluronan synthase, PmHAS, and the chondroitin synthase, PmCS (14Jing W. DeAngelis P.L. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 661-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). PmHS2 is predicted to be organized in a similar fashion as PmHS1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Two residues, Gln-118 and Thr-119, of PmHS1 observed to be conserved within multiple glycosyltransferases including the KfiC protein, the GlcUA-transferase in E. coli K5, were mutated using degenerate primers to generate conservative and nonconservative mutations. The thioredoxin-PmHS1 Q118N, T119S mutant maintained protein expression levels similar to the non-mutated fusion protein, but the remainder of the 118,119 mutants were produced at ≤20% of wild type. The double conservative PmHS1 mutant (glutamine 118 changed to asparagine and threonine 119 changed to serine) possesses ∼60–90% of the activity shown by the wild-type pmHS1 (Table 3). The nonconservative mutation of the glutamine to histidine greatly diminishes enzymatic activity, but mutation of the threonine 119 to serine maintains ∼60–80% of the activity shown by wild-type PmHS1. The mutation of threonine 119 to alanine decreases enzymatic activity to approximately one-third of wild-type levels.TABLE 3Single sugar activity of Thio-PmHS1 Gln-18 Thr-119 mutantsSingle sugar addition assayThio-PmHS1 constructGlcNAc-transferase relative specific activityGlcUA-transferase relative specific activity%%Wild-type (Gln-118 Thr-119)100100Vector<1<1Q118H<1<1T119S100100T119A80100Q118N,T119S98100Q118K,T119S<1<1Q118K,T119A<1<1Q118H,T119S<1<1 Open table in a new tab The data for the thioredoxin-PmHS1 Gln-118 and/or Thr-119 mutants suggest the importance of these residues for the catalytic activity of the heparosan synthase, but in these cases, the mutations did not result in a functional single action thioredoxin-PmHS1 mutant. Potentially these residues, especially the Gln-118, are involved in maintaining structure or are groups important for both sugar transfer reactions. Apparently, the two component activities of PmHS1 are more interdependent than in the case of PmHAS. Preliminary attempts to cleave the PmHS1 enzyme into the two component glycosyltransferase activities were not successful.PmHS1 Structural Possibilities—The GAG synthases add the monosaccharides from UDP sugar precursors onto the nascent polymer chain. Four simple possibilities exist for the arrangement of the UDP sugar donor and the acceptor sites (i.e. corresponding to the nascent polysaccharide chain binding site) within any dual action heparosan synthase enzyme (Fig. 3). These models include: (I) two different acceptor sites (i.e. one each for either a GlcNAc- or a GlcUA-terminated chain) and two different donor sites; (II) one acceptor site, two different donor transfer sites; (III) two different acceptor sites and one donor site (i.e. accommodates both UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-GlcUA); or (IV) one acceptor site for both types of acceptor and one donor site for both UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-GlcUA.FIGURE 3Schematic models of dual action glycosyltransferase architectures. Four simple models for an enzyme capable of adding two different monosaccharides to a nascent polysaccharide chain are depicted as Venn diagrams (I–IV). Models I or II, where two donor sites exist, are most likely for PmHS1. PmHAS appears to have a Model I architecture based on previous studies (19Williams K.J. Halkes K.M. Kamerling J.P.

Phosphorylation of tyrosines in FcγRIIA by Src family kinases is thought to be the initiating event in its signaling. However, although the Src family kinase inhibitor PP1 inhibited both ligand-induced phosphorylation of FcγRIIA and phagocytosis in ts20 cells expressing FcγRIIA, it did not inhibit receptor ubiquitylation or endocytosis of soluble ligands. Conversely, genistein and the proteasomal inhibitor MG132 did not inhibit receptor phosphorylation but strongly inhibited both receptor ubiquitylation and endocytosis. A region of the receptor lying within the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif was found to be necessary for both ubiquitylation and endocytosis. Ubiquitylation occurs at the plasma membrane before internalization. Endocytosis of FcγRIIA is dependent on clathrin but independent of the adaptor protein AP-2. These findings point to a novel mechanism for ubiquitylation and endocytosis of this immunoreceptor.

Although it has long been appreciated that polyubiquitylation of cytoplasmic proteins can target them for degradation by the proteasome, several additional roles for ubiquitylation have emerged. These include functions in the nucleus and in regulating the trafficking of membrane proteins (1Schnell J.D. Hicke L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35857-35860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). In particular, ubiquitylation of surface receptors can act as a signal both for their endocytosis and their intracellular sorting for degradation in multivesicular bodies (2Hicke L. Dunn R. Annu.

Immunol. 1997; 15: 203-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar). Upon binding of IgG-containing complexes, FcγRIIA triggers cell activation and mediates internalization of the immune complexes. We previously showed that cross-linking of FcγRIIA induces ubiquitylation of the receptor (5Booth J.W. Kim M.K. Jankowski A. Schreiber A.D. Grinstein S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Furthermore, endocytosis of soluble immune complexes by FcγRIIA depends on the presence of a functional ubiquitin conjugation system, whereas actin-driven phagocytosis of large antibody-coated particles does not (5Booth J.W. Kim M.K. Jankowski A. Schreiber A.D. Grinstein S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). An important question for understanding the regulation of receptor trafficking is how ligand binding leads to ubiquitylation of the receptor and/or associated proteins. FcγRIIA signals for cell activation by virtue of the presence in its cytoplasmic domain of an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) 2The abbreviations used are: ITAM, immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif; SFK, Src family kinase; agIgG, aggregated IgG; siRNA, small interfering RNA; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase. 2The abbreviations used are: ITAM, immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif; SFK, Src family kinase; agIgG, aggregated IgG; siRNA, small interfering RNA; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase. consisting of the consensus sequence YXXLX(7–12)YXXL. Such motifs are present in activating Fc receptors, the signaling subunits of the T cell and B cell receptors, and other immunoreceptors (4Daeron M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 203-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar, 6Cannons J.L. Schwartzberg P.L. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2004; 16: 296-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The earliest step in signaling from ITAM-containing receptors is thought to be phosphorylation of the tyrosine residues in the ITAM by Src family kinases. The phosphorylated ITAM tyrosines then recruit kinases of the Syk/ZAP-70 family and other effectors to initiate downstream responses such as phagocytosis (4Daeron M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 203-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar). Furthermore, as ubiquitylation of surface receptors has come to be recognized as a common mechanism for their regulation, a model has emerged wherein receptor ubiquitylation is triggered by, and secondary to, ligand-induced receptor phosphorylation. This is thought to be the case for several plasma membrane proteins in yeast, including Ste2p and Ste6p (7Hicke L. Zanolari B. Riezman H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 349-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 8Kelm K.B. Huyer G. Huang J.C. Michaelis S. Traffic. 2004; 5: 165-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Similarly, in the case of mammalian receptor tyrosine kinases, the receptors for epidermal growth factor and hepatocyte growth factor (Met) are ubiquitylated through the action of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Cbl after its binding to phosphotyrosines in the activated, autophosphorylated receptors (9Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Ettenberg S.A. Katz M. Tsygankov A.Y. Alroy I. Lavi S. Iwai K. Reiss Y. Ciechanover A. Lipkowitz S. Yarden Y. Mol.

In light of this current understanding of ITAM-mediated signaling and receptor ubiquitylation, we investigated the relationship between Src family kinase-mediated phosphorylation of FcγRIIA and its ubiquitylation. We found that ubiquitylation and endocytosis of FcγRIIA are independent of the canonical Src family kinase-mediated signaling pathway, indicating a distinct route of signaling downstream of Fc receptors and more generally a novel mechanism for triggering ubiquitylation upon receptor engagement.

Cell Culture, DNA Constructs, and Transfection—ts20 cells were grown at 34 °C and 5% CO2 in α-minimal essential medium +10% fetal bovine serum. cDNA for dynamin I K44A was kindly provided by Dr. S. Schmid. cDNA for dynamin II K44A was prepared as described (12Gold E.S. Underhill D.M. Morrissette N.S. Guo J. McNiven M.A. Aderem A. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1849-1856Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). cDNAs for wild-type and mutant forms of FcγRIIA were cloned into pcDNA3.1/Myc-His (Invitrogen) and were expressed with C-terminal Myc-His6 tags. Truncation and mutagenesis of FcγRIIA was performed by PCR. Transfections were performed with FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) or Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Constructs for expression of Myc-tagged ubiquitin and lysine-mutated ubiquitin were kindly provided by Dr. G. Lukacs (Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto). Stable cell lines expressing FcγRIIA and mutant receptors were selected with G418 (0.5 mg/ml). For treatment of cells with inhibitors, cells were pretreated for 2 h (MG132), 1 h (genistein, Me2SO), or 30 min (PP1) by addition of the inhibitor directly to the culture medium at 100 μg/ml (genistein), 30 μm (PP1), or 20 μm (MG132). siRNA—siRNA sequences targeting the μ2 subunit of AP-2 (μ2–2) and the heavy chain of clathrin (chc-2) were as previously described (13Motley A. Bright N.A. Seaman M.N. Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 909-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar) and were synthesized as Option C siRNAs by Dharmacon; control nonspecific siRNA was also from Dharmacon. Cells were transfected with the siRNAs by nucleofection (Amaxa) on day 0 and day 2; after the second transfection, cells were plated on plastic coverslips (Sarstedt) or in wells and were analyzed on day 4. Phagocytosis and Endocytosis Assays—For phagocytosis assays, 3 μm polystyrene beads were opsonized with 50 μg of human IgG/100 μl of 1% bead solution in phosphate-buffered saline. ts20-IIA cells were incubated with beads at 34 °C for 30 min and then washed. Beads remaining outside the cells were labeled with Cy3 anti-human antibody. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and cell nuclei labeled with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Phagocytic index (number of particles taken up per 100 FcγRIIA-expressing cells) was determined by microscopy for at least 300 cells per condition in each experiment. For endocytosis assays, human IgG was aggregated at 62 °C for 20 min at a concentration of 10 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline, followed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min to remove insoluble aggregates. The supernatant was used at 1:40–1:100 dilution to induce endocytosis by incubation with ts20-IIA cells for 30 min at 34 °C. Cells were then washed; in some experiments, aggregated IgG (agIgG) remaining outside the cell was detected by incubating for 10 min on ice with Cy3- or Cy5-labeled anti-human secondary antibodies before cell permeabilization. Cells were then washed, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized with –20 °C methanol, and total agIgG was detected by incubation with Cy3 or Cy5 anti-human antibodies. For experiments in which endocytosis of rhodamine-transferrin was also measured, it was added for the last 10 min of endocytosis at a concentration of 5 μg/ml. Endocytosis of FcγRIIA was also measured by binding receptors with anti-FcγRIIA monoclonal antibody IV.3, cross-linking the IV.3 with goat anti-mouse antibodies to induce endocytosis, and following disappearance of the cross-linking antibody from the cell surface using Cy5 donkey anti-goat antibodies by flow cytometry as previously described (5Booth J.W. Kim M.K. Jankowski A. Schreiber A.D. Grinstein S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Experiments with fluorescently labeled cross-linking antibody confirmed that the disappearance was due to internalization rather than loss into the medium. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—ts20 cells growing in 10-cm plates were lysed by addition of 1 ml of cold radioimmune precipitation buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, 2 mm Na3VO4, 10 μm phenylarsine oxide, 50 mm NaF, 20 mm NEM, 0.1% protease inhibitor mixture in phosphate-buffered saline). Cells were removed by scraping, transferred to Eppendorf tubes, and incubated on ice for 20 min. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g, 4 °C for 10 min. The receptor was immunoprecipitated by addition of 1 μg of anti-Myc antibody (A-14) or IV.3 and 25 μl of protein G beads. The samples were nutated overnight at 4 °C and then washed three times with cold TBS-T (TBS with 0.1% Tween 20). The samples were solubilized in Laemmli's sample buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE. For Western blotting, the samples were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (BioRad), which were then blocked overnight in 3% bovine serum albumin in TBS. The membranes were probed by incubating for 3 h with primary antibody at a 1:1000 dilution in blocking buffer, followed by a 30-min incubation with anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase or streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase when using a biotinylated 4G10 primary antibody. Membranes were washed in TBS-T, developed using Supersignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate, and visualized using CL-Xposure film (Pierce) or a Genius2 Bioimager (Syngene). Quantitation was performed using Genetools software (Syngene) or by scanning films using a GS-800 densitometer with Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). Microscopy and Immunofluorescence—Fixed and mounted cells were viewed using a Zeiss Axiovert 200M microscope with a ×40 oil immersion objective and an ORCA ER camera (Hamamatsu). Green fluorescent protein, rhodamine/Cy3, Cy5, and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole were visualized using standard filter sets. Endocytosis of FcγRIIA Is Independent of Src Family Kinases—We tested the effects on FcγRIIA-mediated internalization processes of inhibition of Src family kinases (SFK) using the specific SFK inhibitor PP1. For these experiments, we used Chinese hamster ts20 cells stably transfected with FcγRIIA (henceforth termed ts20-IIA cells). We have previously shown that expression of FcγRIIA in these cells supports both phagocytosis of antibody-coated particles and endocytosis of soluble immune complexes (5Booth J.W. Kim M.K. Jankowski A. Schreiber A.D. Grinstein S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Endocytosis leads to the delivery of both receptor and ligand to lysosomal compartments (5Booth J.W. Kim M.K. Jankowski A. Schreiber A.D. Grinstein S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This heterologous transfection model has the advantage of allowing the study of cells expressing a single defined FcγR species or mutant versions thereof. As expected, treatment of the ts20-IIA cells with PP1 strongly inhibited both cross-linking-induced phosphorylation of FcγRIIA (Fig. 1D) and phagocytosis of large IgG-opsonized particles (Fig. 1E). These findings are consistent with the standard model of signaling for FcR-mediated phagocytosis, in which SFK-mediated receptor phosphorylation is a crucial initiating step (14Greenberg S. Grinstein S. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2002; 14: 136-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). We then assessed endocytosis of soluble complexes of agIgG mediated by FcγRIIA under the same conditions. Notably, uptake of agIgG into endosomes proceeded unimpaired in the presence of PP1 (Fig. 1, A and B), as did endocytosis of cross-linking antibody in a flow cytometry-based uptake assay (5Booth J.W. Kim M.K. Jankowski A. Schreiber A.D. Grinstein S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1E). These observations imply that SFK activity, although essential for phagocytosis of large particles, is dispensable for endocytosis of small soluble ligands. It was previously reported that FcγRIIA endocytosis is dependent on tyrosine kinase activity, based on its inhibition by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein (15Davis W. Harrison P.T. Hutchinson M.J. Allen J.M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 432-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 16Ghazizadeh S. Fleit H.B. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 30-41PubMed Google Scholar). In light of these earlier observations, we assessed the effect of genistein in our system. Consistent with the previous findings, genistein strongly inhibited endocytosis of agIgG (Fig. 1, C and E). Treatment with genistein, however, did not inhibit phosphorylation of the receptor (Fig. 1D) and, consistent with this, had little if any effect on phagocytosis (Fig. 1E). Thus, PP1 and genistein have opposite effects on endocytosis and phagocytosis, underscoring the mechanistic differences between these two modes of FcR-mediated ligand uptake (5Booth J.W. Kim M.K. Jankowski A. Schreiber A.D. Grinstein S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Ubiquitylation of FcγRIIA Is Independent of Src Family Kinases—Given the previously demonstrated dependence of endocytosis on ubiquitylation, these results imply that ubiquitylation can occur in an SFK-independent manner. To address this, the receptor was immunoprecipitated and its phosphorylation and ubiquitylation examined by immunoblotting. Cross-linking of the receptor upon addition of aggregated IgG led to both tyrosine phosphorylation and ubiquitylation of the receptor (Fig. 2, A and B). It is noteworthy that the major species of ubiquitylated and phosphorylated receptor are distinct entities, based on their difference in molecular weight (Fig. 2, A and B). Although treatment with PP1 inhibited receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, the receptor was still robustly ubiquitylated, indicating that receptor phosphorylation is not required for its ubiquitylation (Fig. 2, A–D). Genistein had opposite effects, corresponding to what was seen for FcγRIIA internalization. Although treatment with genistein did not inhibit phosphorylation of the receptor, it largely abolished ubiquitylation of the receptor (Fig. 2, A–D), correlating with its effect on endocytosis. Ubiquitylation of FcγRIIA Is Blocked upon Inhibition of the Proteasome—The function of ubiquitylation in trafficking of membrane proteins is generally thought to be distinct from its role in targeting cytoplasmic proteins to the proteasome. Nonetheless, we previously showed that endocytosis of FcγRIIA is inhibited by treatment with clasto-lactacystin β-lactone, a specific inhibitor of the proteasome (5Booth J.W. Kim M.K. Jankowski A. Schreiber A.D. Grinstein S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We have observed similar inhibition of endocytosis upon treatment with MG132, another proteasomal inhibitor; notably, maximal inhibition requires more than an hour of pretreatment (data not shown). We had suggested that inhibition by proteasomal inhibitors could be due to an indirect effect on receptor ubiquitylation, e.g. through depletion of free ubiquitin in the cell (5Booth J.W. Kim M.K. Jankowski A. Schreiber A.D. Grinstein S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Consistent with this model, treatment with MG132 largely abolished receptor ubiquitylation, whereas receptor tyrosine phosphorylation was not inhibited (Fig. 2, A–D). This suggests that the ubiquitylated receptor is not itself a substrate for proteasomal degradation, in which case the amount of ubiquitylated receptor would be expected to increase rather than decrease. Degradation of the receptor after agIgG addition is inhibited by MG132 treatment (data not shown), but this is presumably an indirect consequence of the block of internalization preventing delivery of the receptor to lysosomal compartments (5Booth J.W. Kim M.K. Jankowski A. Schreiber A.D. Grinstein S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The molecular weight shift of ubiquitylated FcγRIIA could reflect polyubiquitylation (addition of chains of ubiquitin) and/or multiple monoubiquitylation. To address this, immunoprecipitated FcγRIIA was blotted with antibody FK-1, which only recognizes polyubiquitylated proteins (17Haglund K. Sigismund S. Polo S. Szymkiewicz I. Di Fiore P.P. Dikic I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 461-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar), or with P4G7, which recognizes both monoubiquitylated and polyubiquitylated proteins. Ubiquitylated FcγRIIA was detected upon probing with FK-1 (Fig. 2E), indicating that FcγRIIA ubiquitylation includes polyubiquitylation. Polyubiquitin chains can form through linkages involving different lysines in ubiquitin. Expression of mutant forms of ubiquitin in which either lysine 48 or lysine 63 was mutated to arginine did not affect the pattern of ubiquitylation observed (Fig. 2F), suggesting that if polyubiquitin chains are a significant component of FcγRIIA ubiquitylation they do not occur obligatorily through either Lys-48 or Lys-63 but rather may occur through both or through other lysines. A Region of FcγRIIA within the ITAM Is Required for Endocytosis—The experiments using PP1 indicated that receptor tyrosine phosphorylation is not required for endocytosis. We also sought to test directly whether the tyrosines present in FcγRIIA play any role in this process. There are three tyrosines in the cytoplasmic domain of FcγRIIA; Tyr-282 and Tyr-298 lie within the ITAM and an additional tyrosine lies at residue 275 (Fig. 3A). Mutant versions of FcγRIIA in which these tyrosines were replaced individually or pairwise by phenylalanine were expressed in ts20 cells, and their ability to support phagocytosis and endocytosis was tested. Phagocytosis was observed with both a Y275,298F double mutant (96 ± 31% of the level seen for wild type; n = 3) and a Tyr-282 single mutant (16 ± 0.7% of wild type; n = 3). For endocytosis, the Y275,298F double mutant gave uptake very similar to the wild-type receptor as judged by microscopic analysis of uptake of agIgG (Fig. 3, B and C) or by flow cytometry (Fig. 3E). Moreover, truncation of the receptor in the middle of the ITAM after residue 286 also did not impair endocytosis (Fig. 4C) or affect its dependence on ubiquitylation (data not shown). Tyr-282, however, does appear to play an important role in endocytosis. The Y282F mutant receptor is strongly impaired in its endocytosis upon addition of agIgG (Fig. 3D) or after receptor cross-linking with antibodies (Fig. 3E).FIGURE 4Identification of a region of FcγRIIA important for endocytosis. A–E, ts20 cells expressing FcγRIIA mutants containing the indicated sequences at residues 282–285 were incubated with agIgG for 30 min. The receptors in panels C–E were in addition truncated after residue 286 (trunc). Images are representative of two experiments. F, endocytosis of the same receptors as in panels A–E assessed by flow cytometry and expressed as percent uptake of initial bound cross-linking antibody in 10 min (n = 3, ±S.D.). Asterisks indicate significant inhibition relative to YMTLtrunc (p < 0.05). Expression levels of all receptors were comparable (mean fluorescence intensity of 500 ± 60).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It would seem that SFK-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of FcγRIIA is not necessary for its endocytosis, and yet the presence of Tyr-282 is nonetheless required. We noted that, in addition to being one of the ITAM tyrosines, Tyr-282 lies within a motif of the form YXXΦ, where Φ is a bulky hydrophobic residue. Such motifs often act as targeting signals for endocytosis by virtue of their binding to the clathrin-associated adaptor protein AP-2 (18Bonifacino J.S. Traub L.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 395-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (1620) Google Scholar). To further explore this possibility, additional mutagenesis of residues in the vicinity of Tyr-282 was performed, either in the context of the full-length receptor or of the truncated receptor that still had fully functional endocytosis. Mutation of Leu-285 to alanine also impaired endocytosis (Fig. 4, B and F), whereas mutation of Thr-284 to alanine had no effect (Fig. 4, A and F), consistent with Y282MTL functioning as an AP-2 binding motif. However, Met-283 also appeared to be important for endocytosis, in that mutation of this residue to either Ala or Ser also inhibited endocytosis (Fig. 4, D–F). Endocytosis of FcγRIIA Is Dependent on Clathrin but Independent of AP-2—Given that the identity of the residue in the Tyr+1 position would be unlikely to strongly affect AP-2 binding (18Bonifacino J.S. Traub L.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 395-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (1620) Google Scholar), we directly addressed whether there is a requirement for AP-2 in FcγRIIA endocytosis by using siRNA to down-regulate AP-2 expression. Effective knock down of AP-2 was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 5G). Importantly, as a functional assay we confirmed that the knockdown of AP-2 was sufficient to strongly inhibit endocytosis of transferrin (Fig. 5C). Notably, however, endocytosis of agIgG by FcγRIIA was not inhibited under these conditions (Fig. 5D), indicating that this adaptor is not essential for FcγRIIA uptake. Although AP-2 has been considered the major adaptor for clathrin-mediated endocytosis, clathrin-dependent uptake of several receptors has been reported to occur in the absence of AP-2, and it was speculated that such uptake might occur through alternative interactions such as those mediated by ubiquitylation (13Motley A. Bright N.A. Seaman M.N. Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 909-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). Endocytosis of agIgG by FcγRIIA in ts20 cells was inhibited by potassium depletion and hypertonic shock, commonly used means of disrupting clathrin-mediated endocytosis; conversely, filipin, which can disrupt clathrin-independent endocytosis (19Sigismund S. Woelk T. Puri C. Maspero E. Tacchetti C. Transidico P. Di Fiore P.P. Polo S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 2760-2765Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar), only inhibited FcγRIIA endocytosis when used at levels that also blocked clathrin-mediated transferrin uptake (data not shown). To more specifically address the clathrin-dependence of FcγRIIA endocytosis, we also knocked down clathrin expression using siRNA. The efficiency of knockdown was incomplete, with only some fields and groups of cells showing strong inhibition of transferrin uptake. However, in contrast to the lack of effect of AP-2 knockdown, the cells with inhibited transferrin uptake also showed a block in uptake of agIgG into endosomes (Fig. 5, E and F). This is also consistent with previous studies showing a strong inhibition of FcγRIIA endocytosis by antisense-mediated knockdown of clathrin (20Tse S.M. Furuya W. Gold E. Schreiber A.D. Sandvig K. Inman R.D. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3331-3338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Thus, endocytosis of FcγRIIA appears to be dependent on ubiquitylation and clathrin but independent of AP-2. Ubiquitylation Occurs Early during Endocytosis—Although the apparent dependence of endocytosis on ubiquitylation suggests an early role for the process, it is possible that ubiquitylation might occur after internalization and that its role might instead be to prevent receptor recycling to the plasma membrane from an internalized pool. To address this question, we inhibited progression of endocytosis by expression of dominant negative dynamin. We verified that expression of the dominant negative K44A mutant of dynamin II inhibited transferrin uptake (Fig. 6, A and B), as expected for a clathrin-dependent process. Endocytosis of FcγRIIA is also inhibited by dominant negative dynamin (Fig. 6, A and C). The extent of receptor ubiquitylation upon agIgG addition in dynK44A-transfected cells was examined. Even with less than 50% transfection efficiency, receptor ubiquitylation was found to increase by 33 ± 13% (n = 3) relative to that in untransfected cells (Fig. 6G, lane 3 versus lane 2). The fact that ubiquitylation increased rather than decreased implies that ubiquitylation occurs at an early step, before internalization from the plasma membrane. The Region of FcγRIIA Required for Endocytosis Is Also Necessary for Ubiquitylation—Because the role in endocytosis of the region within the FcγRIIA ITAM does not appear to consist of recruiting AP-2, we assessed whether this region of the receptor instead might be involved in triggering receptor ubiquitylation. Indeed, the mutations that impaired endocytosis also all caused a loss of ubiquitylation (Fig. 6G). This suggests that a loss of ubiquitylation accounts for the impaired endocytosis of these mutants. In this work, evidence is presented that ubiquitylation of FcγRIIA upon receptor clustering occurs in a manner independent of SFK-mediated receptor phosphorylation. This is surprising in several respects. On one hand, SFK-mediated FcR phosphorylation is generally regarded as the earliest event triggered after receptor aggregation, and virtually all responses to FcR cross-linking would be expected to be blocked by inhibition of SFKs. Indeed, we confirmed that the uptake of large particles through phagocytosis by FcγRIIA requires SFK activity. Moreover, in multiple systems in which ubiquitylation has emerged as a signal determining receptor trafficking it is thought that the initiating event that drives receptor ubiquitylation is receptor phosphorylation. This is the case for the mammalian receptor tyrosine kinases such as the receptors for epidermal growth factor and scatter factor (9Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Ettenberg S.A. Katz M. Tsygankov A.Y.

Lamorte L. Naujokas M.A. Band H. Langdon W.Y. Park M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 995-1004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Similarly, endocytosis of multiple proteins in yeast proceeds through a pathway that involves an ordered process of phosphorylation followed by ubiquitylation (7Hicke L. Zanolari B. Riezman H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 349-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 8Kelm K.B. Huyer G. Huang J.C. Michaelis S. Traffic. 2004; 5: 165-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In contrast, our findings indicate that tyrosine phosphorylation of FcγRIIA by SFK, although necessary for signaling for phagocytosis, is not required for ubiquitylation or for endocytosis of soluble immune complexes. Proteasome inhibitors inhibit endocytosis of FcγRIIA (5Booth J.W. Kim M.K. Jankowski A. Schreiber A.D. Grinstein S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We have found that this is likely due to an indirect effect on receptor ubiquitylation. Inhibition of endocytosis by proteasome inhibitors has also been seen for the growth hormone receptor, the leptin receptor OB-Ra, and the gap junction protein connexin-43 (21van Kerkhof P. Govers R.

In these cases also the effect is likely indirect, because in each case receptor ubiquitylation was also impaired (21van Kerkhof P. Govers R. Alves dos Santos C.M. Strous G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1575-1580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 22Belouzard S. Rouille Y.

These results emphasize that it is important to consider possible effects on trafficking events such as endocytosis when interpreting the outcomes of proteasome inhibition. It is not clear what target of genistein accounts for its inhibitory effects on ubiquitylation and endocytosis. Clearly, it is not the SFK that phosphorylate the receptor, as genistein treatment did not inhibit receptor phosphorylation or phagocytosis. A lack of effect of high concentration genistein on SFK-mediated phosphorylation has also been reported in the context of T cell receptor signaling (24Graber M. June C.H. Samelson L.E. Weiss A. Int. Immunol. 1992; 4: 1201-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Although it is possible that there could be a distinct tyrosine kinase involved in ubiquitylation and endocytosis, the effects of genistein were only observed at relatively high concentrations (>30 μg/ml; data not shown), suggesting that a target other than a tyrosine kinase is likely involved. For the epidermal growth factor receptor, it has been reported that the receptor becomes multiply monoubiquitylated upon activation (17Haglund K. Sigismund S. Polo S. Szymkiewicz I. Di Fiore P.P. Dikic I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 461-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar, 25Mosesson Y. Shtiegman K. Katz M. Zwang Y. Vereb G. Szollosi J. Yarden Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21323-21326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), but recent studies using mass spectrometry reveal a large amount of polyubiquitylation (26Huang F. Kirkpatrick D. Jiang X. Gygi S. Sorkin A. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 737-748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). For FcγRIIA, both mono- and polyubiquitylation may contribute to endocytosis. We do not find evidence that polyubiquitin chains are formed obligatorily through either Lys-48 or Lys-63 linkages. Recent findings suggest that multiple, complex chain topologies can occur during polyubiquitylation (27Kirkpatrick D.S. Hathaway N.A. Hanna J. Elsasser S. Rush J. Finley D. King R.W. Gygi S.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 700-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) and furthermore that different topologies can support recruitment of ubiquitin-binding proteins and endocytosis (27Kirkpatrick D.S. Hathaway N.A. Hanna J. Elsasser S. Rush J. Finley D. King R.W. Gygi S.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 700-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 28Barriere H. Nemes C. Lechardeur D. Khan-Mohammad M. Fruh K. Lukacs G.L. Traffic. 2006; 7: 282-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Thus, although the presence of multiple ubiquitins seems to be important for endocytosis (28Barriere H. Nemes C. Lechardeur D. Khan-Mohammad M. Fruh K. Lukacs G.L. Traffic. 2006; 7: 282-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), their exact orientation may be less so. A region lying within the ITAM appears to be required for both ubiquitylation and endocytosis. The simplest interpretation is that this region is involved in recruiting a ubiquitin ligase necessary for progression of endocytosis. The exact relationship between ubiquitylation and endocytosis of plasma membrane proteins has been unclear. Clathrin-independent uptake of an epidermal growth factor receptor-ubiquitin chimeric protein has been reported (19Sigismund S. Woelk T. Puri C. Maspero E. Tacchetti C. Transidico P. Di Fiore P.P. Polo S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 2760-2765Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). However, in the case of FcγRIIA, uptake appears to be dependent on both the ubiquitylation machinery and clathrin, consistent with recent findings of clathrin- and ubiquitin-dependent endocytosis of other proteins (22Belouzard S. Rouille Y. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 932-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 28Barriere H. Nemes C. Lechardeur D. Khan-Mohammad M. Fruh K. Lukacs G.L. Traffic. 2006; 7: 282-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 29Hawryluk M.J. Keyel P.A. Mishra S.K. Watkins S.C. Heuser J.E. Traub L.M. Traffic. 2006; 7: 262-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Notably, the AP-2 adaptor protein appears not to be required for FcγRIIA endocytosis. Because the knockdown of AP-2 is not complete, we cannot exclude that FcγRIIA endocytosis might require interaction with AP-2 but occur with a higher affinity than for the transferrin receptor. However, AP-2-independent uptake is consistent with ubiquitylation itself being sufficient to recruit the endocytic machinery, as has been seen with AP-2-independent endocytosis of model proteins containing ubiquitin as their sole internalization signal (28Barriere H. Nemes C. Lechardeur D. Khan-Mohammad M. Fruh K. Lukacs G.L. Traffic. 2006; 7: 282-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Ubiquitylation can lead to recruitment of several ubiquitin-interacting motif-containing proteins implicated in endocytosis, including epsin and eps15. Because of the low affinity of the ubiquitin-interacting motifs in these proteins, the presence of multiple ubiquitins, either on an individual protein or provided in trans on oligomerized receptors, appears to be necessary to allow for significant binding (28Barriere H. Nemes C. Lechardeur D. Khan-Mohammad M. Fruh K. Lukacs G.L. Traffic. 2006; 7: 282-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 29Hawryluk M.J. Keyel P.A. Mishra S.K. Watkins S.C. Heuser J.E. Traub L.M. Traffic. 2006; 7: 262-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). This suggests one possible means by which receptor clustering could directly lead to an increase in ubiquitylation in a manner independent of SFK-mediated phosphorylation. It is possible that there is some degree of constitutive ubiquitylation of FcγRIIA that is opposed by continuous removal of ubiquitin by deubiquitinating enzymes, so that there is little steady-state ubiquitylation of non-cross-linked receptors. Oligomerization of partially ubiquitylated receptors might allow sufficient binding of ubiquitin-interacting motif-containing proteins to stabilize receptor ubiquitylation by protecting it from deubiquitinating enzymes. This would be analogous to a model proposed for FcϵRI signaling in which receptor phosphorylation upon multimerization occurs through exclusion of phosphatases (30Young R.M. Holowka D. Baird B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20746-20752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In this way, ubiquitylation and the initiation of endocytosis would be highly cooperative processes. We thank Dr. Gergely Lukacs for the kind gift of Myc-tagged ubiquitin constructs."
https://openalex.org/W1979662749,"The bcl-X gene plays a critical role in apoptosis. Six different isoforms generated by tissue-specific promoter usage and alternative splicing were described. Some of them exert opposite effects on cell death. In mammary epithelial cells glucocorticoids induce bcl-X expression and increase the ratio bcl-XL (antiapoptotic)/bcl-XS (apoptotic) by activating P4 promoter, which contains two hormone response elements. Here we show that, on mouse thymocytes and T lymphocyte derivative S49 cells, glucocorticoids inhibited transcription from P4 and decreased the ratio bcl-XL/bcl-XS favoring apoptosis. Upon hormonal treatment, glucocorticoid receptor (GR), steroid receptor coactivator-1, and RNA polymerase II were transiently recruited to P4 promoter, whereas STAT5B was also recruited but remained bound. Concomitant with the release of GR, silencing mediator for retinoic acid receptor and thyroid hormone receptor and histone deacetylase 3 were recruited, histone H3 was deacetylated, and RNA polymerase II left the promoter. Inhibition of STAT5 activity reverted glucocorticoid repression to activation of transcription and was accompanied by stable recruitment of GR and RNA polymerase II to P4."
https://openalex.org/W2007759478,"In vertebrates, the actin-binding proteins tropomyosins are encoded by four distinct genes that are expressed in a complex pattern during development and muscle differentiation. In this study, we have characterized the transcriptional machinery of the α-tropomyosin (α-Tm) gene in muscle cells. Promoter analysis revealed that a 284-bp proximal promoter region of the Xenopus laevis α-Tm gene is sufficient for maximal activity in the three muscle cell types. The transcriptional activity of this promoter in the three muscle cell types depends on both distinct and common cis-regulatory sequences. We have identified a 30-bp conserved sequence unique to all vertebrate α-Tm genes that contains an MCAT site that is critical for expression of the gene in all muscle cell types. This site can bind transcription enhancer factor-1 (TEF-1) present in muscle cells both in vitro and in vivo. In serum-deprived differentiated smooth muscle cells, TEF-1 was redistributed to the nucleus, and this correlated with increased activity of the α-Tm promoter. Overexpression of TEF-1 mRNA in Xenopus embryonic cells led to activation of both the endogenous α-Tm gene and the exogenous 284-bp promoter. Finally, we show that, in transgenic embryos and juveniles, an intact MCAT sequence is required for correct temporal and spatial expression of the 284-bp gene promoter.

Tropomyosins constitute a family of actin filament-binding proteins found in all eukaryotic cells. They are present in both muscle and non-muscle cells. In striated muscle cells, tropomyosins play a central role in contraction by regulating calcium-sensitive interaction of actin and myosin. In non-muscle cells, tropomyosins regulate actin filament organization and dynamics (1Gunning P.W. Schevzov G. Kee A.J. Hardeman E.C. Trends Cell Biol. 2005; 15: 333-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar).

In vertebrates, the diversity is generated in part by the existence of several genes containing alternative promoters. In addition, these genes exhibit alternative splicing variants of the primary RNA transcripts (2Lees-Miller J.P. Helfman D.M. BioEssays. 1991; 13: 429-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Null mutations in mice have shown that tropomyosins are essential both for development and for normal structure and function of muscle cells. Furthermore, several point mutations associated with abnormal protein function have been found in myopathies (3Blanchard E.M. Iizuka K. Christe M. Conner D.A. Geisterfer-Lowrance A. Schoen F.J.

We have previously identified three ortholog tropomyosin genes, viz. α-Tm, β-Tm, and Tm-4 (also called δ-Tm), in the amphibian Xenopus laevis (6Hardy S. Fiszman M.Y. Osborne H.B. Thiébaud P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 431-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 7Hardy S. Thézé N. Lepetit D. Allo M.R. Thiébaud P.

We have shown that each of the Tm genes has a distinct temporal and spatial pattern of expression during early development and differentiation. The amphibian β-Tm gene is structurally related to its mammalian orthologs. This gene contains one promoter and two sets of alternatively spliced exons and can produce both skeletal and smooth muscle isoforms (8Hardy S. Thiébaud P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1131: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 9Gaillard C. Lerivray H. Thézé N. Cooper B. Lepetit D. Mohun T. Thiébaud P. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1999; 43: 175-178PubMed Google Scholar). The amphibian Tm-4 gene is identical to the avian ortholog, with two promoters and two sets of alternatively spliced exons. The distal promoter is used in cardiac muscle cells, whereas the internal one is used to produce the ubiquitously expressed non-muscle Tm isoform (7Hardy S. Thézé N. Lepetit D. Allo M.R. Thiébaud P. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 156: 265-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The X. laevis α-Tm gene is by far the most complex of all. Using RNA expression and genomic DNA analysis, we have shown that, in common with its avian and mammalian orthologs, the frog α-Tm gene contains two promoters (internal and distal) and three sets of alternatively spliced exons. However, we have not found evidence of a brain-specific exon (10Gaillard C. Thézé N. Hardy S. Allo M.R. Ferrasson E. Thiébaud P. Dev. Genes Evol. 1998; 207: 435-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 11Gaillard C. Thézé N. Lerivray H. Hardy S. Lepetit D. Thiébaud P. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 207: 235-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The low molecular mass non-muscle Tm transcripts are found throughout oogenesis and embryogenesis and in adult tissues. In contrast, the muscle α-Tm transcripts exhibit a restricted expression pattern. Transcripts accumulate from the late neurula stage in both the somites and heart and later during development in smooth muscle tissues. Spatiotemporal expression of the gene is regulated through the two promoters. The internal promoter is ubiquitously active, whereas the distal promoter is active only in muscle cells. In the adult frog, the α-Tm gene is expressed in the three muscle cell types, as are its avian and mammalian orthologs. Transcriptional regulation of the α-Tm gene therefore provides a suitable model for the characterization of the cis-regulatory sequences involved in the transcriptional program that operates in all three muscle lineages. Although the transcriptional regulation of several sarcomeric protein-coding genes has been studied in detail, very little is known about sequences that may regulate tropomyosin expression in the different muscle types. In Drosophila, myocyte enhancer factor-2 has been shown to be a positive regulator of expression of the Tm gene (12Lin M.H. Nguyen H.T. Dybala C. Storti R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4623-4628Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), but very few studies have addressed the transcriptional control of Tm genes in vertebrates. It has been shown that chicken β-Tm gene transcription relies on several cis-sequences, including an E box, a CArG box, and a C box (13Toutant M. Gauthier-Rouviere C. Fiszman M.Y. Lemonnier M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1838-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In the rat, α-Tm gene expression seems to be controlled by a 99-bp enhancer that differentially regulates both α-Tm and a transcription unit (called N5), resulting in distinct tissue-specific expression patterns of the two (14Herrera V.L. Ruiz-Opazo N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9555-9562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is now established that multiple independent cis-regulatory regions, or modules, are required to direct the complete developmental pattern of expression of individual muscle-specific genes (15Firulli A.B. Olson E.N. Trends Genet. 1997; 13: 364-369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). For instance, the MyoD family members that govern skeletal muscle differentiation and that constitute the paradigm for cell type-specific transcription factors function by interacting with cofactors (16Tapscott S.J. Development (Camb.). 2005; 132: 2685-2695Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Moreover, like other developmental processes, muscle differentiation relies on a transcriptional circuit that is dependent on combinatorial associations of cell type-specific and widely expressed transcription factors. These associations interpret cell identity, extracellular signals, and positional information within the embryo (17Arnone M.I. Davidson E.H. Development (Camb.). 1997; 124: 1851-1864Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, some factors involved in muscle gene activation are not restricted to muscle cell types. Among them, ubiquitously expressed transcription enhancer factor-1 (TEF-1) has emerged as a transcription factor implicated in the specific activation of several muscle genes (18Larkin S.B. Ordahl C.P. Harvey R.P. Rosenthal N. Heart Development. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1999: 307-329Crossref Google Scholar). Originally described as a factor binding to non-muscle-specific cis-elements of the SV40 enhancer, TEF-1 has also been found to bind to the MCAT (5′-CATTCCT-3′) regulatory sequence (19Farrance I.K. Mar J.H. Ordahl C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17234-17240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Xiao J.H. Davidson I. Matthes H. Garnier J.M. Chambon P. Cell. 1991; 65: 551-568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). There are four TEF-1 genes in vertebrates that are expressed in a complex pattern and that can produce several isoforms (21Azakie A. Larkin S.B. Farrance I.K. Grenningloh G. Ordahl C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8260-8265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 22Jiang S.W. Trujillo M.A. Sakagashira M. Wilke R.A. Eberhardt N.L.

Notably, the MCAT sequence that binds TEF-1 is present in the regulatory regions of several mammalian and avian cardiac and skeletal muscle-specific genes, including those encoding cardiac muscle troponin T and skeletal muscle α-actin, α- and β-myosin heavy chains, and β-acetylcholine receptor (24Azakie A.

The MCAT sequence has also been implicated in regulation of the mammalian smooth muscle α-actin gene in a complex mechanism that involves several single-strand DNA-binding proteins (37Carlini L.E. Getz M.J. Strauch A.R. Kelm Jr., R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8682-8692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 38Swartz E.A. Johnson A.D. Owens G.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C608-C618Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we have examined the molecular mechanisms that regulate the X. laevis α-Tm gene in cardiac, skeletal, and smooth muscle cells. For this analysis, we have used a genomic clone encompassing the 5′-region of the gene (10Gaillard C. Thézé N. Hardy S. Allo M.R. Ferrasson E. Thiébaud P. Dev. Genes Evol. 1998; 207: 435-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We have identified a 284-bp promoter fragment whose activity in the three muscle types is dependent on the presence of multiple cis-regulatory elements. Among them, we found an MCAT sequence that is embedded in a highly conserved 30-bp module unique to all vertebrate α-Tm genes. This MCAT sequence can bind TEF-1 protein in vitro and in vivo in differentiated muscle cells. In smooth muscle cells, TEF-1 can be redistributed to the nucleus when cells are cultured under serum-deprived conditions that maintain them in a differentiated state. We found that overexpression of TEF-1 mRNA in embryonic cells activates both endogenous and exogenous α-Tm genes. In the later case, we have demonstrated that this activation occurs through the MCAT sequence. Finally, mutation of the MCAT sequence leads to deregulation of the activity of the 284-bp transgene in embryonic and juvenile tissues. Taken together, our data suggest that correct regulation of the vertebrate α-Tm gene in all three muscle cell types depends on TEF-1. Cell Culture and Transfections—Rabbit U8A4 smooth muscle cells and rat PAC1 and A7r5 smooth muscle cells were cultured as described previously (39Firulli A.B. Han D. Kelly-Roloff L. Koteliansky V.E.

Briefly, myocytes were dispersed from ventricles of 1-3-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats by digestion with collagenase type II (Sigma) and pancreatin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C during four periods of 20 min. Cell suspensions were then separated on a discontinuous Percoll gradient to obtain primary cell cultures containing >99% myocytes. The myocytes were plated in 10-cm culture dishes (Falcon) at a density of 1.2-2.0 × 104 cells/cm2 in 1:1 DMEM/Medium 199 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% horse serum, 5% FCS, 350 μg/ml glutamine, 30 units/ml ampicillin, and 30 μg/ml streptomycin. NIH-3T3 fibroblasts were maintained in DMEM containing 10% FCS, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin.

A BamHI/BamHI fragment (-1763/+40) was excised from the genomic clone and inserted into the BglII site of the pGL3-Basic vector (Promega Corp.) to generate the pGL1763LUC construct. A SacI/BamHI fragment (-284/+40) was excised from the genomic clone and subcloned into the SacI and BglII sites of the pGL3-Basic vector to generate the pGL284LUC construct. The pGL235LUC, pGL120LUC, and pGL78LUC constructs were generated by PCR from the genomic clone using oligonucleotide primers containing SacI and BglII linkers such that PCR products could be directionally cloned into the pGL3-Basic vector. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using an in vitro site-directed mutagenesis system (Promega Corp.) following the manufacturer's instructions. The primer mutant sequences were as follows (the mutated sequences are underlined): E box-1, 5′-GAGGCTGGAAAAAGTTAGAGTTTGCACTTC-3′; E box-2, 5′-AAATGCAGTTCTAGAGTCGGCAGAAGC-3′; E box-3, 5′-CCTTATATAGTTCTAGACAGTCAAATGGTC-3′; E box-4, 5′-GCTCCCTTCCAGATCTAGACCTGGAAGTTT-3′; A/T-rich region, 5′-AGCCATCCTTAAGGGAAGCCAGCAAGTGG-3′; CArG-like element, 5′-AAGGCAAGGCTCCCAGGTACCTATTGGGTG-3′; MCAT, 5′-TTGGGTGTCCGGAGGTACCTGTGTGCCCC-3′; and GC box, 5′-AATGTGTGTGCTGATCTTCGCTGCCTTC-3′. All plasmids were confirmed by sequencing. DNA Transfections—U8A4, PAC1, A7r5, and NIH-3T3 cells were seeded the day before transient transfection assays into 12-well plates at a density of 25,000 cells/cm2 when cultured in defined medium and at a density of 15,000 cells/cm2 when cultured in medium supplemented with 10% FCS. 400 ng of luciferase reporter gene constructs and 400 ng of β-galactosidase control vector pHook2-LacZ (Invitrogen) were transfected per well using 2.4 μl of TransFast (Promega Corp.) in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen). After 1 h, 1 ml of culture medium was added, and cells were cultured for 48 h before analysis. C2/7 cells were grown in 12-well plates at a density of 5,000 cells/cm2 until reaching 50% confluence and then transfected as described above. Following transfection, cells were induced to differentiate over 48 h before cell extracts were prepared. Cardiomyocytes were seeded into 6-well plates at a density of 20,000 cells/cm2 3 days before transfection. Cells were incubated for 5 h using 4 μl of FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) and 1 μg of plasmid DNA. After being rinsed with DMEM, cells were cultured for 48 h before cell extracts were prepared. For the luciferase assays, cell extracts were prepared using reporter lysis buffer (Promega Corp.) following the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were measured according to the manufacturer's instructions. All luciferase activity values were normalized to β-galactosidase activity values. The figures were obtained from at least two independent experiments, with each construct tested in triplicate. The pGL3-Control (Promega Corp.) and pGL3-Basic vectors were used as controls. Comparative Sequence Analysis—The nucleotide sequences of vertebrate α-Tm gene promoters were analyzed using sequence similarity computer programs (Infobiogen, Evry, France). In Vitro Transcription and Translation—Chicken TEF-1 cDNA was kindly provided by Dr. C. Ordahl and subcloned into the pCS2+ vector (23Stewart A.F. Larkin S.B. Farrance I.K. Mar J.H. Hall D.E. Ordahl C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3147-3150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid and the X. laevis serum response factor (SRF) cDNA cloned into the pSP64T vector (43Mohun T.J. Chambers A.E. Towers N. Taylor M.V. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 933-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) were used for in vitro transcription. Synthetic capped mRNAs were made using the mMESSAGE mMA-CHINE kit (Ambion, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The products were purified on mini-quick RNA columns (Roche Applied Science). 200-400 ng of mRNA were translated in vitro in reticulocyte lysate (Promega Corp.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The integrity and expected molecular masses of the proteins were assessed by resolving radiolabeled reaction products on a 10% polyacrylamide gel. Western Blot Analysis—Total protein concentration in the samples was determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). 10 μg of nuclear proteins or 20 μg of total proteins were separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, followed by transfer onto Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in 5% nonfat dried milk made in 130 mm NaCl and 25 mm Tris (pH 7.5) containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST). After being washed with TBST, the membranes were incubated for 2 h in TBST supplemented with primary antibody. The immunoblots were then washed three times with TBST and incubated for 1 h with a 1:10,000 dilution of a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit Ig antibody in TBST. The blots were washed three times with TBST and developed using the ECL Western blot detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Signals were visualized on x-ray film after exposures of membranes of between 30 s and 5 min. The primary antibodies used were anti-tropomyosin monoclonal antibody TM311 (1:1000 dilution; Sigma) (44Kashiwada K. Nishida W. Hayashi K. Ozawa K. Yamanaka Y. Saga H. Yamashita T. Tohyama M. Shimada S. Sato K. Sobue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15396-15404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), anti-TEF-1 monoclonal antibody (1:1000 dilution; BD Transduction Laboratories), and anti-TEF-1A polyclonal antibody (generously provided by Dr. I. Farrance). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Nuclear extracts were prepared from cells according to established methods (45Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3916) Google Scholar), and protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay. All extracts were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C. 500 pmol of each sense and antisense oligonucleotide were annealed at 95 °C for 5 min in 50 μl of 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and 1 mm EDTA and then cooled to room temperature. 25 pmol of double-stranded oligonucleotides were end-labeled using [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol) in the presence of T4 polynucleotide kinase. Labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides were recovered after purification on a Qiagen column in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8) and 1 mm EDTA. For EMSAs, 5-10 μg of nuclear extracts or 1-2 μl of in vitro translated TEF-1 and SRF were incubated for 20 min in binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 10% glycerol) containing 0.20 μg of poly(dI-dC) and 4 × 104 cpm end-labeled probe. After a 20-min incubation at room temperature, the samples were subjected to electrophoresis on 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels in 0.5× buffer containing 44.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 44.5 mm boric acid, and 1 mm EDTA for 2 h at 150 V. Gels were dried and exposed to films with an intensifying screen at -80 °C for 24-48 h. For supershift analysis, 750 ng of anti-TEF-1 monoclonal antibody were preincubated with nuclear extracts for 10 min before addition of the probe. The nucleotide sequences of the probes and competitor DNA were as follows (only upper strands are shown): MCAT, 5′-GTGTCCGGAGGAATGTGTGTGCCC-3′; MCAT mutant, 5′-GTGTCCGGAGGTACCTGTGTGCCC-3′; CArG-like element, 5′-AAGGCAAGGCTCCCAAAAAAGTATTGGGTGT-3′;c-fos SRE, 5′-CAGGATGTCCATATTAGGACATCTGCGT-3′ (46Hipskind R.A.

Underlined nucleotides correspond to core-binding sites, and boldface nucleotides represent mutated nucleotides. Identification of proteins in gel shift complexes was performed as described (24Azakie A. LaMont L. Fineman J.R. He Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: C1522-C1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 49Farrance I.K. Ordahl C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8266-8274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The mobility shift reactions were scaled up 5-fold in a final volume of 20 μl. After electrophoresis for 3 h, the gel was soaked twice for a total of 3 min in 2% SDS, 62.5 mm Tris, and 25 mm dithiothreitol and dried. The protein·DNA complexes were then identified by a 2-h autoradiography, and the bands of interest were excised and loaded onto a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Immunoblot analysis was carried out as described above with anti-TEF-1 and anti-TEF-1A antibodies. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—ChIP assays were performed on PAC1 smooth muscle cells cultured in 1 or 10% serum and on C2C12 myoblasts and myotubes according to a published protocol (50Metivier R. Penot G. Hubner M.R. Reid G. Brand H. Kos M. Gannon F. Cell. 2003; 115: 751-763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2-5 × 106 cells were used in the assays. The DNA and protein were cross-linked in situ by treatment with 1% (v/v) formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. Following chromatin sonication, the lysates were precipitated overnight using either 5 μg of mouse anti-TEF-1 monoclonal antibody or 5 μg of rabbit anti-TEF-1 polyclonal antibody (AnaSpec, Inc., San Jose CA). Protein A-agarose beads were added to purify immune complexes. Cross-linking was reversed by heating the samples overnight at 65 °C. RNA was degraded with RNase A for 4 h at 65°C, and proteins were degraded by proteinase K treatment for 2 h at 45 °C. The DNA was further purified by phenol extraction and recovered in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8) and 1 mm EDTA. After DNA purification, samples were subjected to PCR with the following primers designed for the α-Tm gene promoter (14Herrera V.L. Ruiz-Opazo N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9555-9562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar): upper primer, 5′-GTCATATCCACCGTCGACTGG-3′; and lower primer, 5′-CGTGCTCCCTGATATGTACTTTCC-3′. The amplified PCR product was 197 bp. For the smooth muscle α-actin gene promoter (51Shimizu R.T. Blank R.S. Jervis R. Lawrenz-Smith S.C. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7631-7643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), the following primers were used: upper primer, 5′-CTCAAGCCCTTAGCTAATGG-3′; and lower primer, 5′-AACTCTCTAATCTGGGTGGC-3′. The amplified PCR product was 246 bp. PCR was performed for 40 cycles, and 10 μl of PCR products were analyzed by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis. Immunofluorescence—Cells grown on coverslips were fixed for 10 min at 4 °C in methanol and then incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with anti-TEF-1A or anti-SRF (catalog no. sc-335 X, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) primary antibody at a 1:400 dilution. Cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody. Nuclear staining was performed with iodide propidium. Negative controls were performed without primary antibody. Immunofluorescence staining was examined using a Nikon microscope. DNA and RNA Injections—Eggs were obtained from X. laevis females, cultured, and microinjected as described previously (52Thézé N. Hardy S. Wilson R. Allo M.R."
https://openalex.org/W2053299308,"The first step of homology-dependent repair of DNA double-strand breaks is the strand-specific processing of DNA ends to generate 3′ single-strand tails. Despite its importance, the molecular mechanism underlying end processing is poorly understood in eukaryotic cells. We have taken a biochemical approach to investigate DNA end processing in nucleoplasmic extracts derived from the unfertilized eggs of Xenopus laevis. We found that double-strand DNA ends are specifically degraded in the 5′ → 3′ direction in this system. The reaction consists of two steps: an ATP-dependent unwinding of double-strand ends and an ATP-independent 5′ → 3′ degradation of single-strand tails. We also found that the Xenopus Werner syndrome protein, a member of the RecQ helicase family, plays an important role in DNA end processing. Mechanistically, Xenopus Werner syndrome protein (xWRN) is required for the unwinding of DNA ends but not for the degradation of single-strand tails. The xWRN-mediated end processing is remarkably similar to the end processing that has been proposed for the Escherichia coli RecQ helicase and RecJ single-strand nuclease, suggesting that this mechanism might be conserved in prokaryotes and eukaryotes.

DNA double-strand break (DSBs) 2The abbreviations used are: DSB, DNA double-strand break; WRN, Werner syndrome protein; xWRN, Xenopus WRN; NHEJ, non-homologous end joining; HR, homologous recombination; SSA, single-strand annealing; MRX, Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2; NPE, nucleoplasmic extract; ss, single-strand; ds, double-strand. is the most deleterious type of DNA damage in cells. Improperly repaired DSBs may lead to chromosome truncations or rearrangements and consequently premature cell death or oncogenic cell transformation (1Vilenchik M.M. Knudson A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12871-12876Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Currently, three major pathways have been identified to repair DSBs: non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), homologous recombination (HR), and single-strand annealing (SSA) (2Baumann P. West S.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 247-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 3Karran P. Curr. Opin. Genet.

HR and SSA share some mechanistic features such as dependence on sequence homology and strand-specific end processing. Moreover, mitotic recombination appears to proceed via synthesis-dependent strand annealing, which is essentially a hybrid mechanism including features of both classical HR and SSA (5Strathern J.N. Klar A.J. Hicks J.B. Abraham J.A. Ivy J.M. Nasmyth K.A. McGill C. Cell. 1982; 31: 183-192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 6Nassif N. Penney J. Pal S. Engels W.R. Gloor G.B.

A. 1996; 93: 5419-5424Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The first step of homology-based repair is the processing of DSBs into 3′ single-stranded tails. In Escherichia coli, the RecBCD helicase/nuclease complex constitutes the major pathway for end processing. In addition, the RecQ helicase and the RecJ ss-DNA nucleases have been proposed to constitute an alternative pathway (8Amundsen S.K. Smith G.R. Cell. 2003; 112: 741-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, however, the mechanism for end processing is poorly understood. Genetic analysis in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has suggested that the Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 (MRX) complex plays an important role in end processing, but exactly what it does in this reaction remains obscure (9Symington L.S. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 630-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). Mre11 is endowed with both an exonuclease and an endonuclease activity (10Trujillo K.M. Yuan S.S. Lee E.Y. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21447-21450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 11Paull T.T. Gellert M. Mol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 35458-35464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). However, the directionality of the Mre11 exonuclease activity is 3′ → 5′, which is opposite of what is expected of an exonuclease that resects DNA in the 5′ → 3 direction. Moreover, a mutation that knocks out the nuclease activity without disrupting MRX complex assembly shows no significant defect in the processing of HO-induced DSBs in mitotic cells, whereas other nuclease-inactivating mutations that block end processing appear to do so indirectly by destabilizing the MRX complex (14Moreau S. Ferguson J.R. Symington L.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 556-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 15Llorente B. Symington L.S. Mol. Cell.

Another candidate nuclease is ExoI, which, when overexpressed, can suppress the mitotic DNA repair defect of mre11, rad50, and xrs2 mutants (17Tran P.T. Erdeniz N. Symington L.S. Liskay R.M. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2004; 3: 1549-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). However, an exoI null mutant has no significant defect in recombinational repair (18Fiorentini P. Huang K.N. Tishkoff D.X. Kolodner R.D. Symington L.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2764-2773Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 19Moreau S. Morgan E.A. Symington L.S. Genetics. 2001; 159: 1423-1433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and only minor defect in DNA end processing (15Llorente B. Symington L.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9682-9694Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). While genetic analysis has provided many fundamental insights into DSB repair, some important mechanistic questions, including DNA end processing, can be addressed more conveniently and rigorously in a biochemical system. One powerful biochemical system is the extracts derived from the interphase eggs of the frog Xenopus laevis. This system can efficiently join various DNA ends via a Ku-dependent NHEJ mechanism (20Thode S. Schafer A. Pfeiffer P. Vielmetter W. Cell. 1990; 60: 921-928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 21Labhart P. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 2585-2593Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). It also contains robust activity for SSA repair of homologous ends, which was demonstrated first in oocytes and later in nucleoplasmic extract (NPE) derived from nuclei reconstituted in Xenopus egg extracts (22Carroll D. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1996; 54: 101-125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Yan H. McCane J. Toczylowski T. Chen C. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 217-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The NPE system has made it possible to use the powerful immunodepletion procedure to analyze the function of various proteins in SSA. One of the major findings from this analysis is that the Xenopus Werner syndrome protein (xWRN) plays an important role in SSA (23Yan H. McCane J. Toczylowski T. Chen C. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 217-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The WRN protein, a member of the RecQ helicase family, has been implicated in various aspects of genome maintenance, such as DNA replication, NHEJ, homology-based DSB repair, and telomere maintenance (24Schellenberg G.D. Miki T. Yu C.E. Nakura J. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. The Genetic Basis of Human Cancer. McGraw-Hill, New York1998: 347-359Google Scholar, 25Lee J.W. Harrigan J. Opresko P.L. Bohr V.A. Mech. Ageing Dev. 2005; 126: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, the exact mechanistic role of WRN in such diverse DNA transactions remains a mystery. To better understand homology-dependent DSB repair and the role of xWRN in it, we have initiated a biochemical analysis of DNA end processing using NPE as the model system. Previously, it has been observed that linear DNA injected into Xenopus oocytes is degraded in a 5′ → 3′ strand-specific manner (26Maryon E. Carroll D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4862-4871Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, the reaction mechanism and the proteins participating in end processing were not pursued. We have found that NPE also contains robust activity for 5′ strand-specific processing of double-strand DNA ends. This reaction is dependent on ATP and can be separated into two steps: the unwinding of DNA ends and the degradation of the 5′ ss-tail. The unwinding step, but not the single-strand DNA degradation step, is dependent on ATP. Moreover, we have found that the xWRN helicase plays an important role in DNA end processing by promoting end unwinding. These results provide the first biochemical evidence that DNA end processing in eukaryotes is a coupled end unwinding/5′ ss-tail degradation reaction and that WRN, a member of RecQ helicase family, acts as the primary helicase for unwinding of ds-DNA ends in NPE. Interestingly, the E. coli RecQ helicase and RecJ ss-DNA exonuclease have been proposed to act in a similar way to process DNA ends, suggesting that a conserved DNA end processing pathway might be present in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Extract Preparation—Crude interphase Xenopus egg extracts and demembranated sperm chromatin were prepared following the published procedures (27Smythe C. Newport J.W. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 35: 449-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). NPEs were prepared from nuclei reconstituted around sperm chromatin in crude extracts according to the protocol described by Walter et al. (28Walter J. Sun L. Newport J. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 519-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). DNA Substrate Preparation—The following five oligonucleotides were used to prepare the various oligonucleotide-based DNA substrates in this study: 24-mer 1, 5′-GGAAACAGCTATGACCATGATTAC-3′; 48-mer, 5′-GTTCCACACAACACCCACCAACACGTAATCATGGTCATAGCTGTTTCC-3′; biotin-48mer, same as 48-mer except that the 5′ G is biotinylated; 24-mer 2, 5′-TAACAGCTATGACCATGATTACGT-3′; 47-mer, 5′ biotin-GACCAACCACACAACACCCACCAACACGTAATCATGGTCATAGCTGTT-3′. To make the 5′-oligonucleotide duplex (5′ accessible), 24-mer 1 and 48-mer were annealed and extended with biotin-dCTP, [32P]dATP, dGTP, and TTP by Klenow (exo–; New England Biolabs). To make the 3′-oligonucleotide duplex (3′ accessible), 24-mer 2 and 47-mer were annealed and extended with [32P]dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and TTP by Klenow. The nuclease-resistant thio 5′-oligonucleotide duplex was prepared with 24-mer 1 and biotin-48-mer and the fill-in reaction was performed in the presence of thio-dGTP, thio-TTP, [32P]dATP, and dCTP. Long linear DNA was made by digesting pUC19 with BamHI and then filling the ends with dGTP, [32P]dATP, and ddTTP. Single-stranded DNA was prepared by denaturing DNA by heat. Coating of biotin-containing oligonucleotides on streptavidin paramagnetic beads (Dynal) was carried out following the manufacturer's instruction. DNA End Processing Assays—A typical end processing assay contains: 4 μl of NPE, 0.8 μl of 10 × ATP mix (20 mm ATP, 200 mm phosphocreatine, and 0.5 mg/ml creative kinase), 1 μl of DNA (∼40 ng/μl for pUC19 or 0.2 ng/μl for oligonucleotide DNA), and 4.8 μl of ELB buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 250 mm sucrose, 2.5 mm Mg2Cl, 50 mm KCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). Reactions with depleted NPE usually contain: 5 μl of depleted NPE, 0.6 μl of 10 × ATP mix, 0.75 μl of DNA, 1 μl of ELB buffer or xWRN protein. The reactions were incubated at room temperature, and samples were taken at the indicated times. For reactions that required separation of beads and supernatants, samples were mixed with 4 volumes of washing buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 1 mm EDTA, 1 m NaCl, and 0.05% Nonidet P-40), and beads were separated by magnet. The supernatants were withdrawn, and the beads were washed once with washing buffer. All samples were finally mixed with equal volume of 2× sample buffer (80 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 0.13% phosphoric acid, 8 mm EDTA, 5% SDS, 0.2% bromphenol blue, and 10% Ficoll). The volume was brought up to 10 μl with 1× sample buffer and then 1 μl of proteinase K (10 mg/ml) was added. After overnight incubation at room temperature, samples were separated on either 1% TAE (Tris, acetic acid, EDTA)/agarose gel, or 8% TAE/polyacrylamide gel, or 12% urea/polyacrylamide gel. Gels were dried and exposed to phosphorimager (Fuji) and x-ray film. Immunodepletion—Immunodepletion of xWRN from NPE has been described previously (23Yan H. McCane J. Toczylowski T. Chen C. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 217-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). For the complementation experiments, xWRN was purified directly from cytosol as previously described (23Yan H. McCane J.

Science. 1995; 269: 1883-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and E. coli RecQ protein was obtained from Dr. Stephen C. Kowalczykowski. The final concentrations of xWRN and RecQ in the complementation reactions were 5 ng/μl(∼30–40% of the estimated endogenous xWRN concentration) and 10 ng/μl (approximately equivalent molar concentration to that of the endogenous xWRN). NPE Can Efficiently Process Double-strand DNA Ends in the 5′ → 3′ Direction—To study ds-DNA end processing and the strand specificity of processing, we prepared two types of oligonuleotide duplexes that carry a biotin moiety at either the 5′ end or the 3′ end. After binding to streptavidin-paramagnetic beads, the biotin end is blocked, leaving only the opposite end accessible to the end processing machinery. For simplicity, these oligonucleotide duplexes will be referred to as: 5′ duplex (biotin at 3′ end; 5′ end accessible; Fig. 1, A and B) and 3′ duplex (biotin at 5′ end; 3′ end accessible; Fig. 1B). In addition, the oligonucleotides were labeled with 32P at either the 3′ end (for 3′ duplex) or immediately inside the 3′ end (for 5′ duplex). We first determined the fate of the 5′ duplex in NPE. The DNA was coated on beads and then incubated in NPE. The beads were isolated at various times, heat-denatured, and separated by urea-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 1A, the labeled DNA recovered from the beads was degraded over time. The reaction was rapid, and the intermediates were most clearly observed at the 3-min time point. The final products were a mixture of nucleotides estimated to be 4–11 nucleotides in size. The incomplete degradation is mostly likely due to the physical hindrance to the nuclease(s) as it approached the beads. The pattern of degradation observed above is consistent with a5′ → 3′ end processing. However, an endonucleolytic reaction might also generate a similar pattern. In addition, because the 3′ end was linked to the beads, any 3′ → 5′ degradation activity would have escaped detection. To distinguish among these possibilities, we next determined the fate of the 3′ duplex in NPE. The beads precoated with either the 5′ duplex (as control) or the 3′ duplex were incubated in NPE for various times. A 3′ → 5′ exonuclease or an endonuclease would immediately release the 32P label from the 3′ duplex into the supernatant. We therefore analyzed the whole reaction instead of just the beads. The samples were directly treated with SDS-containing sample buffer and proteinase K and then separated by native PAGE. (Native PAGE was used because NPE contains materials that interfere with urea PAGE). The condition used here cannot disrupt the interaction between biotin and streptavidin (disruption requires harsh conditions such as boiling in SDS or 65 °C–90 °C incubation in 95% formamide (Dynal)), so the DNA bound to beads cannot enter the gel unless first being denatured by heat. As shown in Fig. 1B, the 3′ duplex was stable, with the 32P label largely retained on the beads even after 30 min of incubation. Upon heat treatment, the labeled DNA was released from the beads but migrated at the position of intact size, suggesting that it was not subject to any significant degradation. The 5′ duplex behaved as expected from Fig. 1A. The 32P label was also largely retained on the beads, but upon heat treatment, the released labeled DNA was mostly of small size (4–11 nucleotides). (The small amount of dAMP generated was later converted to dATP, presumably by adenylate kinase and nucleoside diphosphate kinase in NPE.) Taken together, these results strongly suggest that ds-DNA end processing in NPE is strand specific and proceeds mostly in the 5′ → 3′ direction. End Processing in NPE Is Highly Processive—In yeast, end processing can proceed over an extensive length, reaching 1 kilobases or more (15Llorente B. Symington L.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9682-9694Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 30Sun H. Treco D. Szostak J.W. Cell. 1991; 64: 1155-1161Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 31Shroff R.

In NPE, SSA can occur between two 1.2-kb repeats, suggesting that DNA up to this length could be degraded from the 5′ strand. To directly test the processivity of end processing in NPE, we prepared a 2.6-kb linear DNA (pUC19 linearized by BamHI) as substrate. Such long linear DNA can be rapidly repaired in NPE by NHEJ, a situation that complicates the detection of end processing. To overcome this problem, we filled in the 3′ recessed end (GATC) with dGTP, [32P]dATP, and ddTTP. The resulting DNA cannot be repaired by NHEJ due to the block by ddTTP. When this DNA was incubated in NPE, it was gradually degraded over time as judged by SYBR Gold staining (Fig. 1C, left panel). Notably, the partially degraded intermediates still largely retained the 3′ end 32P label (Fig. 1C, middle panel). For example, as shown in Fig. 1C, right panel, after 7 min, most of the DNA was at least partially degraded based on SYBR Gold staining, yet the total amount of 32P label on these DNA molecules was not significantly reduced. These data suggest that NPE can also process long linear DNA molecules in the 5′ → 3′ direction over a length of up to 2.6 kilobases. Processing of ds-DNA Ends Is Dependent on ATP—To understand the mechanism underlying 5′ → 3′ ds-DNA end processing, we determined whether the reaction depends on ATP, a high energy molecule required for many biochemical reactions. NPE normally contains a significant amount of ATP. This endogenous ATP was removed by treatment with apyrase, an enzyme that is often used to destroy ATP in Xenopus egg extracts (32Newmeyer D.D. Wilson K.L. Kay B.K. Peng H.B. Methods in Cell Biology. Academic Press, New York1991: 607-634Google Scholar). The DNA substrates, 5′-oligonucleotide duplex and linear pUC19 DNA, were then incubated in the ATP-depleted NPE or control NPE. Samples were taken at various times, treated with SDS and proteinase K, and separated by native PAGE (for oligonucleotide duplex) or on an agarose gel (for pUC19). As shown in Fig. 2, in the apyrase-treated NPE (–ATP), both DNA substrates were stable. In contrast, in the control NPE (+ATP), the two DNAs were rapidly degraded into smaller products. These results indicate that ds-DNA end processing in NPE is strictly dependent on ATP. Processing of ds-DNA Ends Is Coupled to DNA Unwinding—One likely mechanistic explanation for the ATP dependence is that ds-DNA end processing might require DNA unwinding, a reaction that depends on ATP hydrolysis for energy. However, the type of DNA substrates used in the above experiments does not permit the detection of DNA unwinding because the unwound DNA is also degraded. To overcome this problem, we made a nuclease-resistant oligonucleotide duplex by using thio-dGTP and thio-TTP in the fill-in reaction of a 24-mer/48-mer partial duplex. Thionucleotides confer resistance to degradation by many nucleases, including the nuclease(s) responsible for end processing in NPE (Fig. S1). The 48-mer carries a biotin moiety at the 5′ end, while the thio strand carries two 32P label near the 3′ end. After binding to streptavidin beads, the thio strand will carry an accessible 5′ end and a 32P label near the 3′ end (and beads). For simplicity, we will refer to this DNA as thio 5′ duplex (Fig. 3A). After incubation in NPE, if there is no unwinding, the thio strand should remain annealed to the complementary biotin-carrying strand and thus bound to the beads. Conversely, if there is unwinding, the thio strand should be released from the beads into the supernatant. The thio 5′ duplex was incubated in NPE for various times, the beads and the supernatants were separated from each other, and the DNA in each fraction was analyzed by native PAGE. As shown in Fig. 3B, the partially degraded, thio-containing DNA was recovered exclusively in the supernatant, whereas the residual DNA on the beads was all of intact size (when analyzed after being released from beads by heat). Importantly, the release of the thio strand was strictly dependent on ATP. As shown in Fig. 3C, when ATP was removed from NPE, the thio strand remained bound to the beads. These results strongly suggest that ds-DNA end processing is tightly coupled to an ATP-dependent DNA unwinding reaction. ss-DNA Ends Are Efficiently Processed in the 5′ → 3′ Direction—If unwinding is an integral step of ds-DNA end processing, one prediction would be that ss-DNA ends are the target for nucleolytic degradation. Moreover, this degradation would have to be mostly 5′ → 3′ to ensure that, of the two tails (5′ and 3′) generated by unwinding, only the 3′ ss-tail remains as the final product. To test this prediction, we denatured the 5′-oligonucleotide duplex and the 3′-oligonucleotide duplex and then coated the biotin-carrying ss-oligonucleotides onto streptavidin magnetic beads. One oligonucleotide had a free 5′ end but a blocked 3′ end (5′ ss-oligo). The other oligonucleotide had a free 3′ end but a blocked 5′ end (3′ ss-oligo). Both ss-oligonucleotides also carried a 32P label at or near the 3′ end. These bead-bound ss-oligonucleotides were then incubated in NPE. Samples were taken at various times, treated with SDS/proteinase K, heated, and separated by native PAGE. As shown in Fig. 4A, the oligonucleotide with the free 5′ end was rapidly degraded. In contrast, the oligonucleotide with the free 3′ end was quite stable, with only a small amount of degradation after extensive incubation. (As will be shown later, long linear ss-pUC19 DNA can also be efficiently degraded in NPE). Notably, 5′ → 3′ ss-DNA end processing, unlike ds-DNA end unwinding, was equally efficient in NPE pre-treated with apyrase (–ATP) or buffer (+ATP) (Fig. 4B). Together, these data indicate that NPE can efficiently degrade ss-DNA ends in an ATP-independent reaction and does so almost exclusively in the 5′ → 3′ direction. They also suggest, when combined with the unwinding data above, that ds-DNA end processing can be dissected into two distinct steps based on ATP dependence. The unwinding step is absolutely dependent on ATP, but once this is complete, ATP is no longer required for the degradation of 5′ ss-DNA tails. xWRN Is Important for ds-DNA End Processing—We next attempted to identify the proteins that participate in ds-DNA end processing. Previously we had shown that the xWRN is important for SSA repair, which is dependent on end processing (23Yan H. McCane J. Toczylowski T. Chen C. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 217-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We therefore determined whether xWRN might be important for ds-DNA end processing. To do this, xWRN was depleted from NPE with affinity-purified antibodies to at least 98% efficiency (for details, see Ref. 23Yan H. McCane J. Toczylowski T. Chen C. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 217-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The linear pUC19 DNA as that used in Fig. 1C was incubated in either xWRN-depleted or mock-depleted NPE. In mock-depleted NPE, pUC19 was efficiently degraded as judged by both total DNA staining and 32P label at the 3′ end (Fig. 5A). (The reaction had a slower kinetics because the depletion procedure reduced the overall potency of NPE due to unavoidable dilution and extensive incubation.) In xWRN-depleted NPE, however, pUC19 was very stable, even after 120 min of incubation. Importantly, this deficiency could be complemented by the addition of the purified xWRN protein to the xWRN-depleted NPE (Fig. 5B). The xWRN protein used in this experiment was purified by multiple steps of chromatography without involving anti-xWRN antibodies (23Yan H. McCane J. Toczylowski T. Chen C. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 217-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 33Yan H. Chen C.Y. Kobayashi R. Newport J. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 375-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). By itself xWRN did not cause any detectable degradation to pUC19 (Fig. 5B), indicating that the protein was free of contaminating nucleases that might have inadvertently degraded DNA in a nonspecific way. In addition, a different helicase, the E. coli RecQ protein (34Harmon F.G. Kowalczykowski S.C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1134-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), was unable to complement the defect (Fig. 5C). Collectively, these data strongly suggest that xWRN is a critical player in the processing of ds-DNA ends. xWRN Acts in End Unwinding but Not in ss-DNA End Degradation—As shown earlier, the processing of ds-DNA ends can be divided into two steps: the unwinding of ends and the degradation of 5′ ss-tails. An important mechanistic question is which step requires xWRN. To evaluate the role of xWRN in ss-DNA degradation, we prepared linear ss-DNA by heat-denaturing the 3′-labeled ds-pUC19 DNA. The denatured ss-DNA was then incubated in xWRN- or mock-depleted NPE and then analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. As shown in Fig. 6A, the ss-pUC19 DNA was rapidly degraded in both reactions as judged by both total DNA staining and 32P signal. (The multiple slower migrating faint bands in the control reaction that contains buffer only are pUC19 ss-DNA molecules with different conformations). This suggests that xWRN does not play any significant role in the degradation of ss-tail DNA. To examine the role of xWRN in DNA unwinding, we incubated the thio 5′ duplex in either xWRN- or mock-depleted NPE. Samples were taken at various times, and the beads and the supernatants were then separated. In mock-depleted NPE, as expected, a significant fraction of the thio strand was released from the beads into the supernatant (Fig. 6B). In xWRN-depleted NPE, however, most of the labeled strand remained bound to the beads and failed to enter the gel. This defect was specific and could be complemented by the addition of the purified xWRN protein to the xWRN-depleted NPE (Fig. 6C). Similar to the result with end processing, RecQ was unable to complement the unwinding defect (Fig. 6D). Together, these results strongly suggest that xWRN participates in ds-DNA end processing by promoting the unwinding of DNA ends with no significant effect on the degradation of the resulting ss-DNA tails. The major observations of this study are: 1) NPE contains robust activity for 5′ → 3′ processing of ds-DNA ends; 2) the reaction can be separated into two steps: the unwinding of DNA ends and the degradation of 5′ ss-DNA tails; 3) the unwinding step is dependent on ATP, but the ss-DNA end processing is not; 4) xWRN is important for ds-DNA end processing; and 5) xWRN acts at the unwinding step but not the ss-DNA degradation step. Importantly, xWRN is also required for SSA (23Yan H. McCane J. Toczylowski T. Chen C. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 217-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This strongly suggests that the 5′ strand-specific processing of DNA ends in NPE is not merely a DNA degradation reaction. Instead, the resulting 3′ strand can be efficiently channeled into a homology-dependent DSB repair pathway. These observations suggest the following mechanism for ds-DNA end processing in NPE (Fig. 7A). The first step is that xWRN unwinds ds-DNA ends into ss-DNA tails in an ATP dependent reaction. Although WRN has limited 3′ → 5′ exonuclease activity, it is of the wrong polarity and inactive on ss-DNA (35Kamath-Loeb A.S. Shen J.C. Loeb L.A. Fry M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34145-34150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 36Huang S. Li B. Gray M.D. Oshima J. Mian I.S. Campisi J. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 114-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar) and as such highly unlikely to be directly responsible for the degradation of the 5′ strand. Instead, our data suggest that an ATP-independent exonuclease degrades specifically the 5′ ss-tail. The lack of a significant 3′ → 5′ ss-DNA exonuclease activity ensures that the 3′ ss-tail remains as the final product. Importantly, blocking end unwinding, by depleting either xWRN or ATP, also blocks end processing. End unwinding is thus an obligatory first step for end processing. The basic architecture of this pathway is remarkably similar to that of the RecQ/RecJ model of E. coli (Fig. 7B). There the RecQ helicase has been proposed to unwind DNA ends and then the RecJ ss-DNA exonuclease degrades the 5′ ss-tail, leaving behind the 3′ ss-tail. In the Xenopus system, xWRN, which is also a member of the RecQ helicase family, appears to play a similar role as that of the E. coli RecQ. The 5′ → 3′ ss-DNA exonuclease in NPE has yet to be identified. Although xWRN has an exonuclease domain at its N terminus, the polarity is 3′ → 5′ instead of 5′ → 3′, and our data also showed that xWRN is not the nuclease. ExoI is a good candidate, but further studies are required to reveal the true identity of the nuclease (18Fiorentini P. Huang K.N. Tishkoff D.X. Kolodner R.D. Symington L.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2764-2773Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Clearly, a RecQ helicase and an 5′ → 3′ ss-exonuclease are only the basic mechanical components for end processing. Other proteins, such as MRX, CDK1, and ATM, could play a regulatory role in end processing (37Ira G. Pellicioli A. Balijja A. Wang X. Fiorani S. Carotenuto W. Liberi G. Bressan D. Wan L. Hollingsworth N.M. Haber J.E. Foiani M. Nature. 2004; 431: 1011-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar, 38Jazayeri A. Falck J. Lukas C. Bartek J. Smith G.C. Lukas J. Jackson S.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar). Can this mechanism be applied to other eukaryotes? The role of WRN in end processing has not been studied so far, but this protein is recruited to DSBs and plays an important role in homology-dependent DSB repair in both human cells and Xenopus egg extracts (23Yan H. McCane J. Toczylowski T. Chen C. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 217-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 39Prince P.R. Emond M.J. Monnat Jr., R.J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 933-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 40Lan L. Nakajima S. Komatsu K. Nussenzweig A. Shimamoto A. Oshima J. Yasui A. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 4153-4162Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Although none of the RecQ helicases in other organisms is essential for homologous recombination and, by inference, for ds-DNA end processing, the coupled end unwinding/ss-DNA degradation might be carried out by multiple combinations of helicases and ss-DNA nucleases. Indeed, the helicases and the nucleases of the two E. coli end processing pathways, RecBCD and RecQ/RecJ, are known to be able to act in various combinations (41Ivancic-Bace I. Peharec P. Moslavac S. Skrobot N. Salaj-Smic E. Brcic-Kostic K. Genetics. 2003; 163: 485-494PubMed Google Scholar). In higher eukaryotes, there are multiple RecQ helicases. Although the E. coli RecQ protein is unable to substitute for xWRN in end processing, this is most likely due to the lack of protein-protein interaction with other components of the end processing machinery. Other RecQ helicases, such as the Bloom syndrome protein, might also be able to unwind DNA from ends. In S. cerevisiae, Sgs1 is known to be functionally redundant with other helicases such as Dna2 (42Budd M.E. Campbell J.L. Mutat. Res. 2000; 459: 173-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In NPE, xWRN appears to be the major RecQ helicase, probably due to the developmentally regulated expression of various RecQ helicases (data not shown). In other organisms, therefore, inactivating a single RecQ helicase might not have a dramatic effect on end processing. However, the basic mechanism of unwinding/ss-DNA degradation is very likely to be operative in these organisms by the combined action of DNA helicases and ss-DNA exonucleases. The finding that xWRN participates in ds-DNA end processing might provide a unified mechanistic explanation for the role of WRN in genome maintenance. Loss of WRN affects many aspects of DNA transactions, including homology-directed DSB repair, replication restart, and telomere maintenance. Strand-specific processing of DSB ends is a prerequisite for not only SSA but also HR, WRN might therefore play a similar role in HR. This might be particularly important for the telomerase-independent maintenance of telomeres, which is apparently achieved by a HR-like mechanism (43Dunham M.A. Neumann A.A. Fasching C.L. Reddel R.R. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). As to replication fork restart in general, the results from this study imply that WRN might be recruited to dissociate the stalled newly synthesized strand for degradation. Indeed, genetic analysis in E. coli has suggested that RecQ and RecJ might act in this way to expand the gap between a fork-stalling lesion and the next Okazaki fragment (44Courcelle J. Hanawalt P.C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1999; 262: 543-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Future studies analyzing the role of WRN in unwinding DNA ends or stalled forks for degradation should help reveal the mechanistic role of this important protein in genome maintenance.

https://openalex.org/W2067736643,"Sheep liver 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase shows a high specificity for NADP, with a much lower affinity for NAD. Discrimination between NADP and NAD suggests that the interactions between the 2′-phosphate and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase contribute most of the binding energy for NADP. There are three active site residues, Asn-32, Arg-33, and Thr-34, that hydrogen-bond to the 2′-phosphate of NADP according to the crystal structure of the E·Nbr8ADP complex. In this study alanine mutagenesis was used to probe the contribution of each of the three residues to binding the cofactor and to catalysis. All mutant enzymes exhibit no significant change in V/Et or K6PG but an increase in KNADP that ranges from 6- to 80-fold. All mutant enzymes also exhibit at least a 7-fold increase in the primary kinetic 13C-isotope effect-1, indicating that the decarboxylation step has become more rate-limiting. Data are consistent with significant roles for Asn-32, Arg-33, and Thr-34 in providing binding energy for NADP, and more importantly, the 2′-phosphate of NADP is required for proper orientation of the cofactor to allow rotation about the N-glycosidic bond as it is reduced in the hydride transfer step."

It is essential to consider at the outset how to maximize the value of such collaborations while avoiding potential pitfalls. Successful advances in biomedical research increasingly require multigroup collaborations and publication of results in multiauthored papers. It is essential to consider at the outset how to maximize the value of such collaborations while avoiding potential pitfalls. It is becoming more and more challenging to generate major research contributions as new layers of complexity are continually added to our understanding of basic biological processes. Input from diverse specialties and emerging technologies is increasingly necessary for promoting new discoveries and for providing definitive tests of hypotheses. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) and some other funding agencies provide substantial support for Program Projects, which subsume the research efforts of multiple participating laboratories. A natural consequence of this trend is that major publications frequently involve many contributors from a variety of different laboratories and institutions; there may be over a dozen authors on the scientific publication, and the list includes participants who do not know each other. In fact, some may not even be cognizant of the research specialties and expertise of each of the other coauthors. If all goes well, the potential outcome of these large enterprises may be phenomenal and science will be advanced. But how can quality control be ensured for such large collaborative research ventures? Who is ultimately responsible for ascertaining that every contributor's work is reliable? In scientific research, as in every other human endeavor, there is always the possibility of individual carelessness or lack of competence, unintentional bias, various degrees of plagiarism, and, although exceedingly rare, even falsification of results (Powell, 2006Powell K. Misconduct mayhem.Nature. 2006; 441: 122-123Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar). The senior author or team leader, who has presumably orchestrated the collaborative enterprise, must ultimately assume overall responsibility for the published product of the research, even though that individual may have no direct control or oversight of the activities in each of the contributing research laboratories, or of each participating group leader or student. This person must determine how the responsibilities will be shared among the different groups and how accountability will be assigned (Shamoo and Resnik, 2003Shamoo A.E. Resnik D.B. Responsible Conduct of Research. Oxford University Press Inc., Oxford2003Google Scholar). In this Commentary, I offer some suggestions that should not only render the collaborative experience more fulfilling for each of the participants but also should help to ensure that the outcome of the work constitutes reliable science. Critical elements in carrying out a collaboration should include a trial period for the collaborating research groups to establish effective interactions in preliminary studies, efforts to establish trust in the competence and reliability of the respective contributors, and ultimately verification of the truth of the results and the validity of the conclusions based upon them. The discussion that follows is not meant to be an exhaustive treatment of the complexities of collaborative research. There are a number of sources of detailed information, including a section on “Collaborative Research” within the website of the NIH's Office of Research Integrity (ORI; http://www.ori.dhhs.gov/education/products/niu_collabresearch/collabresearch/crmain.html) and an ORI publication on Responsible Conduct of Research (Steneck and Zinn, 2003Steneck N.H. Zinn D. ORI Introduction to the Responsible Conduct of Research. Department of Health and Human Services., 2003Google Scholar). There are two fundamentally different approaches to setting up a research collaboration. The collaboration might entail the coalescence of studies already underway in several different laboratories, which are focused upon a common research problem or goal. In that case, the collaboration involves bringing together the different sets of results, usually obtained by complementary approaches (but not necessarily so) and reaching some agreement among participants as to the conclusions to be drawn from the composite study for purposes of a joint publication on the common theme. Alternatively, the project may be initiated in one laboratory and then other individuals or groups are recruited to supply particular input from their own unique specialties. Often this may involve transfer of samples from one laboratory to another for analysis by a specialized procedure, with the results being reported back for incorporation into the fabric of the composite research story. Obviously, the choice of collaborators is an essential first step toward the eventual success of the project. It is important to learn at the outset whether there are any potential conflicts of interest, such as financial interest in commercialization. Other conflicts include those that might compromise an individual's dedication and impartiality, such as participation in competing collaborations, or involvement in personal relationships that could be interpreted as questionable. Issues of intellectual property and data “ownership” must also be raised for discussion at this early stage. Early during the negotiations with potential collaborators, the respective roles in the project should be assigned, including the matter of eventual authorship, and the participants' expectations should be stated. Who is responsible for each part of the project and how will the respective contributions be acknowledged in eventual publications? Not everyone who contributes to a research project should necessarily be granted coauthorship on the resulting papers. Every listed author should have contributed substantially to the project with respect to its conception, the design and/or performance of the experiments, the analysis of the results, and/or the drafting of the manuscript describing the project. All authors (and especially students!) should participate in critical reading and approval of the final manuscript submitted for publication. Each author should understand the research problem and should be able to offer an intelligent discussion of the entire project from the perspective of their own involvement in it. There should never be any “courtesy authors,” who may have been selected because of previous efforts in this research area or who are considered to add credibility or prestige to the publication (or to themselves), or for any other reason. Those who provide services such as statistical advice or administrative support should not be granted authorship but can be thanked in the acknowledgments. However, there are some gray areas, such as furnishing genetically manipulated organisms, a specially constructed plasmid, or other reagents that have required major effort for their preparation. The last name in the author list should normally be the senior person who takes responsibility for the entire collaborative enterprise. If several research group leaders share that responsibility, then a useful convention is to list them all at the end in some agreed-upon order. The person or persons who carried out most of the actual experiments and their design (often students or postdocs) should be listed first. Some journals now detail the specific contributions from each of the authors at the end of the paper—an excellent initiative that should be broadly promoted. Discussions of the entire project should be conducted among the participating groups, and these should occur face-to-face or at least through shared emails or conference phone calls. Decisions need to be made regarding the first set of preliminary experiments. This is not done to immediately test a hypothesis but rather to validate the approaches to be used and to learn their limitations. At this point the participants from the different laboratories should have the opportunity to become acquainted. The questions to be addressed include whether they will be able to work effectively together and whether they have confidence in the integrity of their colleagues. The aggregate of the people in the collaborating groups working in close association should ultimately ensure high standards. It is important to promulgate an attitude of openness with unrestricted challenge and self-criticism in these research discussions to promote the best science. This is especially crucial for the mentoring of students; to the extent that they are drawn into the discussions and encouraged to realize that they are an essential component in the collaborative effort, they will generally mature in a conscientious and responsible manner. When open research discussions are curtailed or short circuited by anyone, that is when one should raise concerns that there may be hidden problems or complications. Again, to the extent that discussions of the research are carried out with the full participation of everyone involved, the development of the project (and the careers of those who participate) will be much more rewarding, and less likely to engender error or misbehavior of any sort. Within the collaboration, the value of individual intuition and insight should not be minimized or ignored. Individuals generate new ideas as grist for committees to elaborate in discussion. Careful evaluation of each set of experimental data must be carried out initially within the respective groups working on the collaborative research problem. This should never be relegated to reviewers of an eventual manuscript. Reviewers will rarely have the time to go through each figure with a fine tooth comb for possible evidence of errors in procedures, misrepresentation of data, or falsification of results. Furthermore, reviewers almost never have access to the primary data, so they would generally be unable to recognize problems such as the misuse of graphics-enhancing software. A particular “sin-of-omission” should be noted, and that is the presentation of only a portion of a chromatograph or electrophoretic analysis rather than the entire picture, thereby eliminating potentially important data from a figure. The group leaders must take the lead in this essential self-criticism exercise, but it is useful if representatives from each group meet in conference to provide another level of scrutiny during critical evaluation of the results. The importance of a particular step in a procedure might be overlooked by a collaborator who is not fully familiar with the entire project. The necessity of this detailed level of internal review cannot be overstated. Also, this becomes an opportune time to fully involve students: to obtain their relatively unbiased input and, in so doing, to contribute to their apprenticeship for future careers in research. Scientists are predominantly motivated by their compulsion to learn the truth. In science, new ideas should be rigorously challenged and experimental results should be questioned as to their validity and statistical significance. Research scientists are continually designing experiments to challenge and perhaps disprove the hypotheses proposed by their competitive colleagues. Manuscripts submitted to journals are subjected to critical review, hopefully by knowledgeable referees, who may question whether the conclusions are justified by the experimental results and the control data presented. Through these processes every hypothesis is eventually verified or overturned, and the happy outcome is that we achieve a better understanding of the physical basis for the world in which we live. This ongoing process of repeating and checking the data from other researchers and other laboratory groups, if done rigorously, would reduce the chance that anyone would ever contribute falsified or manipulated data. There are various safeguards to ensure against errors (honest or otherwise) that could arise at multiple stages of the project, beginning with the experimental design and extending through the collection of data and its presentation in figures for publication. Students and postdocs within a laboratory group should be encouraged to scrutinize the findings and critically evaluate the validity of the data obtained by their coworkers. Each group leader should ensure that this is a normal part of mentoring his/her students. But what if a group leader is in fact the originator of misconduct? Then it behooves anyone who is aware of a potential problem to come forth and discuss his or her concerns openly. There should be no stigma attached to being a “whistle-blower”—if there are problems with any aspect of the research it is far better that these are brought to light at the earliest possible opportunity. How can problems of this sort be avoided or minimized? One obvious approach is to always use “double blind” samples when material is passed to a collaborator for particular analytical procedures. There should be no reason that the collaborator needs to know the identities of the respective coded samples. This simple protocol would also preclude the possibility that even unintentional bias could be introduced into the analysis of “treated” and “control” samples. Indeed, it is important to use blind samples whenever possible, even within an investigator's laboratory, to eliminate unintentional bias. For each procedure, it is also prudent, if possible, to have several people independently carry out the analyses; this might typically involve two postdocs or graduate students, or even the lab director and a student. At the very least, the repetition of an experiment by a student can help to develop confidence in his/her research ability, and if there is a lack of confirmation of the result then this could serve as a didactic challenge to seek the basis for the disagreement. The overall intent must be to ensure that the final product of the research represents the best possible science. Why would anyone want less than that? Finally, I wish to address the serious issue of the negative impact of one coauthor's carelessness or misbehavior upon the ongoing careers of his/her collaborators and students. Such events can be terribly demoralizing to the coauthors and can even impact the broad public view of a particular area of science. Coauthors become “tainted” by the retractions of published papers, and this may impact their future attempts to publish their research and to receive research grant support. Students may become disillusioned and choose alternative careers. These are gloomy predictions, but they are sufficiently severe that the ethical components of scientific research should be considered well in advance of the possible emergence of a problem. The increased dependence of research upon multilab collaborations has highlighted the need for special attention to approaches for ensuring high-quality science with lasting impact. I thank K. Fields, A. Ganesan, D. Kennedy, I. Mellon, R. Simoni, G. Spivak, and J. van Overbeke for helpful discussions."
