https://openalex.org/W1987817703,"During development, changes in individual cell shape drive the overall organization of organs and tissues. Now a study of the dynamics of cell behaviour during fruit fly development reveals a previously unknown ratchet-like mechanism that drives cell shape change. Gastrulation in the Drosophila embryo involves the apical constriction of ventral cells, which induces a ventral furrow and invagination of the mesoderm. This new work shows that the apical constriction of ventral cells is pulsed: repeated constrictions are interrupted by pauses in which the constricted state of the cells in maintained. These pulses are powered by actin–myosin contractions and are dependent on the expression of a transcription factor Snail, whereas the constricted state is stabilized by another transcription factor, Twist. During gastrulation in Drosophila embryo, there is apical constriction of ventral cells, which results in formation of a ventral furrow and invagination of the mesoderm. This study reports a mechanism for this process and shows that apical constriction of ventral cells is pulsed. These pulses are powered by the actin–myosin contractions and are dependent on the expression of a transcription factor, Snail, whereas the constricted state is stabilized by the transcription factor Twist. Apical constriction facilitates epithelial sheet bending and invagination during morphogenesis1,2. Apical constriction is conventionally thought to be driven by the continuous purse-string-like contraction of a circumferential actin and non-muscle myosin-II (myosin) belt underlying adherens junctions3,4,5,6,7. However, it is unclear whether other force-generating mechanisms can drive this process. Here we show, with the use of real-time imaging and quantitative image analysis of Drosophila gastrulation, that the apical constriction of ventral furrow cells is pulsed. Repeated constrictions, which are asynchronous between neighbouring cells, are interrupted by pauses in which the constricted state of the cell apex is maintained. In contrast to the purse-string model, constriction pulses are powered by actin–myosin network contractions that occur at the medial apical cortex and pull discrete adherens junction sites inwards. The transcription factors Twist and Snail differentially regulate pulsed constriction. Expression of snail initiates actin–myosin network contractions, whereas expression of twist stabilizes the constricted state of the cell apex. Our results suggest a new model for apical constriction in which a cortical actin–myosin cytoskeleton functions as a developmentally controlled subcellular ratchet to reduce apical area incrementally."
https://openalex.org/W2102904139,"Recent progress in massively parallel sequencing platforms has enabled genome-wide characterization of DNA-associated proteins using the combination of chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing (ChIP-seq). Although a variety of methods exist for analysis of the established alternative ChIP microarray (ChIP-chip), few approaches have been described for processing ChIP-seq data. To fill this gap, we propose an analysis pipeline specifically designed to detect protein-binding positions with high accuracy. Using previously reported data sets for three transcription factors, we illustrate methods for improving tag alignment and correcting for background signals. We compare the sensitivity and spatial precision of three peak detection algorithms with published methods, demonstrating gains in spatial precision when an asymmetric distribution of tags on positive and negative strands is considered. We also analyze the relationship between the depth of sequencing and characteristics of the detected binding positions, and provide a method for estimating the sequencing depth necessary for a desired coverage of protein binding sites."
https://openalex.org/W2051554315,"2-Arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) and anandamide are endocannabinoids that activate the cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2. Endocannabinoid signaling is terminated by enzymatic hydrolysis, a process that for anandamide is mediated by fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), and for 2-AG is thought to involve monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL). FAAH inhibitors produce a select subset of the behavioral effects observed with CB1 agonists, which suggests a functional segregation of endocannabinoid signaling pathways in vivo. Testing this hypothesis, however, requires specific tools to independently block anandamide and 2-AG metabolism. Here, we report a potent and selective inhibitor of MAGL called JZL184 that, upon administration to mice, raises brain 2-AG by eight-fold without altering anandamide. JZL184-treated mice exhibited a broad array of CB1-dependent behavioral effects, including analgesia, hypothermia and hypomotility. These data indicate that 2-AG endogenously modulates several behavioral processes classically associated with the pharmacology of cannabinoids and point to overlapping and unique functions for 2-AG and anandamide in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2040528706,"Segregating hybrids and stable allopolyploids display morphological vigour, and Arabidopsis allotetraploids are larger than the parents Arabidopsis thaliana and Arabidopsis arenosa-the mechanisms for this are unknown. Circadian clocks mediate metabolic pathways and increase fitness in animals and plants. Here we report that epigenetic modifications of the circadian clock genes CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1 (CCA1) and LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY) and their reciprocal regulators TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION 1 (TOC1) and GIGANTEA (GI) mediate expression changes in downstream genes and pathways. During the day, epigenetic repression of CCA1 and LHY induced the expression of TOC1, GI and downstream genes containing evening elements in chlorophyll and starch metabolic pathways in allotetraploids and F(1) hybrids, which produced more chlorophyll and starch than the parents in the same environment. Mutations in cca1 and cca1 lhy and the daily repression of cca1 by RNA interference (RNAi) in TOC1::cca1(RNAi) transgenic plants increased the expression of downstream genes and increased chlorophyll and starch content, whereas constitutively expressing CCA1 or ectopically expressing TOC1::CCA1 had the opposite effect. The causal effects of CCA1 on output traits suggest that hybrids and allopolyploids gain advantages from the control of circadian-mediated physiological and metabolic pathways, leading to growth vigour and increased biomass."
https://openalex.org/W2077016335,"Chromosome region 1q21.1 contains extensive and complex low-copy repeats, and copy number variants (CNVs) in this region have recently been reported in association with congenital heart defects, developmental delay, schizophrenia and related psychoses. We describe 21 probands with the 1q21.1 microdeletion and 15 probands with the 1q21.1 microduplication. These CNVs were inherited in most of the cases in which parental studies were available. Consistent and statistically significant features of microcephaly and macrocephaly were found in individuals with microdeletion and microduplication, respectively. Notably, a paralog of the HYDIN gene located on 16q22.2 and implicated in autosomal recessive hydrocephalus was inserted into the 1q21.1 region during the evolution of Homo sapiens; we found this locus to be deleted or duplicated in the individuals we studied, making it a probable candidate for the head size abnormalities observed. We propose that recurrent reciprocal microdeletions and microduplications within 1q21.1 represent previously unknown genomic disorders characterized by abnormal head size along with a spectrum of developmental delay, neuropsychiatric abnormalities, dysmorphic features and congenital anomalies. These phenotypes are subject to incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity."

https://openalex.org/W2079705176,"Neurons and cancer cells use glucose extensively, yet the precise advantage of this adaptation remains unclear. These two seemingly disparate cell types also show an increased regulation of the apoptotic pathway, which allows for their long-term survival. Here we show that both neurons and cancer cells strictly inhibit cytochrome c-mediated apoptosis by a mechanism dependent on glucose metabolism. We report that the pro-apoptotic activity of cytochrome c is influenced by its redox state and that increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS) following an apoptotic insult lead to the oxidation and activation of cytochrome c. In healthy neurons and cancer cells, however, cytochrome c is reduced and held inactive by intracellular glutathione (GSH), generated as a result of glucose metabolism by the pentose phosphate pathway. These results uncover a striking similarity in apoptosis regulation between neurons and cancer cells and provide insight into an adaptive advantage offered by the Warburg effect for cancer cell evasion of apoptosis and for long-term neuronal survival."
https://openalex.org/W2122707782,"Neurons in visual cortex are linked by an extensive network of lateral connections. To study the effect of these connections on neural responses, we recorded spikes and local field potentials (LFPs) from multi-electrode arrays that were implanted in monkey and cat primary visual cortex. Spikes at each location generated outward traveling LFP waves. When the visual stimulus was absent or had low contrast, these LFP waves had large amplitudes and traveled over long distances. Their effect was strong: LFP traces at any site could be predicted by the superposition of waves that were evoked by spiking in a approximately 1.5-mm radius. As stimulus contrast increased, both the magnitude and the distance traveled by the waves progressively decreased. We conclude that the relative weight of feedforward and lateral inputs in visual cortex is not fixed, but rather depends on stimulus contrast. Lateral connections dominate at low contrast, when spatial integration of signals is perhaps most beneficial."
https://openalex.org/W2041060287,"Prosopagnosics have impaired face recognition, but make relatively normal responses to face stimuli in core brain regions for face recognition. The authors now report that it is the connectivity among these regions that is being disrupted in the disorder. Using diffusion tensor imaging and tractography, we found that a disruption in structural connectivity in ventral occipito-temporal cortex may be the neurobiological basis for the lifelong impairment in face recognition that is experienced by individuals who suffer from congenital prosopagnosia. Our findings suggest that white-matter fibers in ventral occipito-temporal cortex support the integrated function of a distributed cortical network that subserves normal face processing."
https://openalex.org/W2143855992,"Despite countless catalogues of genomic binding sites for transcription factors, predicting the expression of a gene purely based on its DNA sequence has remained very inaccurate. Gertz et al. present a general thermodynamic model that accurately captures the relationship between a gene promoter sequence, including weak, statistically undetectable regulatory sites, and its expression output. The work implies that chromatin plays a relatively minor role in directing gene expression and will facilitate rational genetic design in biotechnology and synthetic biology. This paper presents a general thermodynamic model that accurately captures the relationship between a gene promoter sequence, including weak, stastically undetectable regulatory sites, and its expression output. The work implies a relatively minor role of chromatin and will facilitate rational genetic design in biotechnology and synthetic biology. Transcription factor binding sites are being discovered at a rapid pace1,2. It is now necessary to turn attention towards understanding how these sites work in combination to influence gene expression. Quantitative models that accurately predict gene expression from promoter sequence3,4,5 will be a crucial part of solving this problem. Here we present such a model, based on the analysis of synthetic promoter libraries in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). Thermodynamic models based only on the equilibrium binding of transcription factors to DNA and to each other captured a large fraction of the variation in expression in every library. Thermodynamic analysis of these libraries uncovered several phenomena in our system, including cooperativity and the effects of weak binding sites. When applied to the S. cerevisiae genome, a model of repression by Mig1 (which was trained on synthetic promoters) predicts a number of Mig1-regulated genes that lack significant Mig1-binding sites in their promoters. The success of the thermodynamic approach suggests that the information encoded by combinations of cis-regulatory sites is interpreted primarily through simple protein–DNA and protein–protein interactions, with complicated biochemical reactions—such as nucleosome modifications—being downstream events. Quantitative analyses of synthetic promoter libraries will be an important tool in unravelling the rules underlying combinatorial cis-regulation."

https://openalex.org/W2085896397,"The classical model of adaptive evolution in an asexual population postulates that each adaptive clone is derived from the one preceding it. However, experimental evidence has suggested more complex dynamics, with theory predicting the fixation probability of a beneficial mutation as dependent on the mutation rate, population size and the mutation's selection coefficient. Clonal interference has been demonstrated in viruses and bacteria but not in a eukaryote, and a detailed molecular characterization is lacking. Here we use three different fluorescent markers to visualize the dynamics of asexually evolving yeast populations. For each adaptive clone within one of our evolving populations, we identified the underlying mutations, monitored their population frequencies and used microarrays to characterize changes in the transcriptome. These results represent the most detailed molecular characterization of experimental evolution to date and provide direct experimental evidence supporting both the clonal interference and the multiple mutation models."

https://openalex.org/W2001284886,"Macroautophagy is a vacuolar lysosomal catabolic pathway that is stimulated during periods of nutrient starvation to preserve cell integrity. Ceramide is a bioactive sphingolipid associated with a large range of cell processes. Here we show that short-chain ceramides (C(2)-ceramide and C(6)-ceramide) and stimulation of the de novo ceramide synthesis by tamoxifen induce the dissociation of the complex formed between the autophagy protein Beclin 1 and the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. This dissociation is required for macroautophagy to be induced either in response to ceramide or to starvation. Three potential phosphorylation sites, Thr(69), Ser(70), and Ser(87), located in the non-structural N-terminal loop of Bcl-2, play major roles in the dissociation of Bcl-2 from Beclin 1. We further show that activation of c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase 1 by ceramide is required both to phosphorylate Bcl-2 and to stimulate macroautophagy. These findings reveal a new aspect of sphingolipid signaling in up-regulating a major cell process involved in cell adaptation to stress."

https://openalex.org/W2012147706,"Activation of GABAA receptors can depolarize specific neuronal compartments, causing excitation. The authors report that hippocampal interneurons hyperpolarize pyramidal cells, irrespective of the location of their synapses, along the entire somato-dendritic axis. Although GABAergic interneurons are the main source of synaptic inhibition in the cortex, activation of GABAA receptors has been shown to depolarize specific neuronal compartments, resulting in excitation. By using a noninvasive approach to monitor the effect of individual interneurons on the pyramidal cell population, we found that rat hippocampal interneurons hyperpolarized pyramidal cells irrespective of the location of their synapses along the somato-dendritic axis."
https://openalex.org/W1987862415,"Michael Elowitz and colleagues demonstrate that dynamic correlations in gene expression noise, as revealed using single-cell time-lapse microscopy showing time lags due to regulation, can be used to characterize active regulatory links in a synthetic and an endogenous network. Gene regulatory interactions are context dependent, active in some cellular states but not in others. Stochastic fluctuations, or 'noise', in gene expression propagate through active, but not inactive, regulatory links1,2. Thus, correlations in gene expression noise could provide a noninvasive means to probe the activity states of regulatory links. However, global, 'extrinsic', noise sources generate correlations even without direct regulatory links. Here we show that single-cell time-lapse microscopy, by revealing time lags due to regulation, can discriminate between active regulatory connections and extrinsic noise. We demonstrate this principle mathematically, using stochastic modeling, and experimentally, using simple synthetic gene circuits. We then use this approach to analyze dynamic noise correlations in the galactose metabolism genes of Escherichia coli. We find that the CRP-GalS-GalE feed-forward loop is inactive in standard conditions but can become active in a GalR mutant. These results show how noise can help analyze the context dependence of regulatory interactions in endogenous gene circuits."

https://openalex.org/W2039150510,"Arsenite [As(III)] is highly toxic to organisms, including plants. Very recently, transporters in rice responsible for As(III) transport have been described (Ma, J. F., Yamaji, N., Mitani, N., Xu, X. Y., Su, Y. H., McGrath, S. P., and Zhao, F. J. (2008) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 105, 9931-9935), but little is known about As(III) tolerance. In this study, three independent As(III)-tolerant mutants were isolated from ethyl methanesulfonate-mutagenized M2 seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana. All three mutants carried independent mutations in Nodulin 26-like intrinsic protein 1;1 (NIP1;1), a homolog of an aquaporin. Two independent transgenic lines carrying T-DNA in NIP1;1 were highly tolerant to As(III), establishing that NIP1;1 is the causal gene of As(III) tolerance. Because an aquaglyceroporin is able to transport As(III), we measured As(III) transport activity. When expressed in Xenopus oocytes, NIP1;1 was capable of transporting As(III). As content in the mutant plants was 30% lower than in wild-type plants. Promoter beta-glucuronidase and real-time PCR analysis showed that NIP1;1 is highly expressed in roots, and GFP-NIP1;1 is localized to the plasma membrane. These data show that NIP1;1 is involved in As(III) uptake into roots and that disruption of NIP1;1 function confers As(III) tolerance to plants. NIP1;2 and NIP5;1, closely related homologs of NIP1;1, were also permeable to As(III). Although the disruption of these genes reduced the As content in plants, As(III) tolerance was not observed in nip1;2 and nip5;1 mutants. This indicates that As(III) tolerance cannot be simply explained by decreased As contents in plants."
https://openalex.org/W2071733232,"In this study, the inhibitor 2 of protein phosphatase 2A (I2PP2A) was identified in vitro and in situ as a ceramide-binding protein, which exhibits stereoisomer specificity and fatty acid chain length preference. Site- directed mutagenesis coupled with structural details of I2PP2A suggested that VIK 207-209 residues localized on helix 7 are important for ceramide binding and single mutation of K209D altered this interaction. Notably, I2PP2A-ceramide binding decreased the association between PP2A and the inhibitor, preventing the inhibition of PP2A activity in vitro. In addition, studies in A549 human lung cancer cells revealed that ceramide mediates c-Myc degradation via its PP2A-dependent dephosphorylation at S62, and treatment with okadaic acid and expression of c-Myc mutants with S62A or S62D conversions resulted in resistance to ceramide-mediated degradation. Importantly, whereas down-regulation of I2PP2A enhanced PP2A-mediated c-Myc degradation in response to ceramide, ectopic expression of wild-type I2PP2A but not of its K209D mutant protected this degradation in A549 cells. Moreover, expression of wild-type I2PP2A prevented the growth-inhibitory effects of ceramide both against A549 cells and xenograft-driven tumors in situ and in vivo compared with that in controls. Thus, these results suggest that direct interaction of I2PP2A with ceramide plays important biological roles via the regulation of PP2A activity and signaling, which in turn control ceramide-mediated degradation of c-Myc and antiproliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2136573376,"Neutrophils generate microbicidal oxidants through activation of a multicomponent enzyme called NADPH oxidase. During activation, the cytosolic NADPH oxidase components (p47(phox), p67(phox), p40(phox), and Rac2) translocate to the membranes, where they associate with flavocytochrome b(558), which is composed of gp91(phox)/NOX2 and p22(phox), to form the active system. During neutrophil stimulation, p47(phox), p67(phox), p40(phox), and p22(phox) are phosphorylated; however, the phosphorylation of gp91(phox)/NOX2 and its potential role have not been defined. In this study, we show that gp91(phox) is phosphorylated in stimulated neutrophils. The gp91(phox) phosphoprotein is absent in neutrophils from chronic granulomatous disease patients deficient in gp91(phox), which confirms that this phosphoprotein is gp91(phox). The protein kinase C inhibitor GF109203X inhibited phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced phosphorylation of gp91(phox), and protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylated the recombinant gp91(phox)- cytosolic carboxy-terminal flavoprotein domain. Two-dimensional tryptic peptide mapping analysis showed that PKC phosphorylated the gp91(phox)-cytosolic tail on the same peptides that were phosphorylated on gp91(phox) in intact cells. In addition, PKC phosphorylation increased diaphorase activity of the gp91(phox) flavoprotein cytosolic domain and its binding to Rac2, p67(phox), and p47(phox). These results demonstrate that gp91(phox) is phosphorylated in human neutrophils by PKC to enhance its catalytic activity and assembly of the complex. Phosphorylation of gp91(phox)/NOX2 is a novel mechanism of NADPH oxidase regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2071246239,"In all organisms, the protein machinery responsible for the replication of DNA, the replisome, is faced with a directionality problem. The antiparallel nature of duplex DNA permits the leading-strand polymerase to advance in a continuous fashion, but forces the lagging-strand polymerase to synthesize in the opposite direction. By extending RNA primers, the lagging-strand polymerase restarts at short intervals and produces Okazaki fragments. At least in prokaryotic systems, this directionality problem is solved by the formation of a loop in the lagging strand of the replication fork to reorient the lagging-strand DNA polymerase so that it advances in parallel with the leading-strand polymerase. The replication loop grows and shrinks during each cycle of Okazaki fragment synthesis. Here we use single-molecule techniques to visualize, in real time, the formation and release of replication loops by individual replisomes of bacteriophage T7 supporting coordinated DNA replication. Analysis of the distributions of loop sizes and lag times between loops reveals that initiation of primer synthesis and the completion of an Okazaki fragment each serve as a trigger for loop release. The presence of two triggers may represent a fail-safe mechanism ensuring the timely reset of the replisome after the synthesis of every Okazaki fragment."
https://openalex.org/W2049172195,"The NF2 gene product, merlin/schwannomin, is a cytoskeleton organizer with unique growth-inhibiting activity in specific cell types. A narrow spectrum of tumors is associated with NF2 deficiency, mainly schwannomas and meningiomas, suggesting cell-specific mechanisms of growth control. We have investigated merlin function in mouse Schwann cells (SCs). We found that merlin regulates contact inhibition of proliferation by limiting the delivery of several growth factor receptors at the plasma membrane of primary SCs. Notably, upon cell-to-cell contact, merlin downregulates the membrane levels of ErbB2 and ErbB3, thus inhibiting the activity of the downstream mitogenic signaling pathways protein kinase B and mitogen-activated protein kinase. Consequently, loss of merlin activity is associated with elevated levels of ErbB receptors in primary SCs. We also observed accumulation of growth factor receptors such as ErbB2 and 3, insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor and platelet-derived growth factor receptor in peripheral nerves of Nf2-mutant mice and in human NF2 schwannomas, suggesting that this mechanism could play an important role in tumorigenesis."

https://openalex.org/W1985568538,"The proteasome controls the turnover of many cellular proteins. Two structural features are typically required for proteins to be degraded: covalently attached ubiquitin polypeptides that allow binding to the proteasome and an unstructured region in the targeted protein that initiates proteolysis. Here, we have tested the degradation of model proteins to further explore how the proteasome selects its substrates. Using purified yeast proteasome and mammalian proteasome in cell lysate, we have demonstrated that the two structural features can act in trans when separated onto different proteins in a multisubunit complex. In such complexes, the location of the unstructured initiation site and its chemical properties determine which subunit is degraded. Thus, our findings reveal the molecular basis of subunit specificity in the degradation of protein complexes. In addition, our data provide a plausible explanation for how adaptor proteins can bind to otherwise stable proteins and target them for degradation."
https://openalex.org/W2063808790,"Membrane recycling and remodeling contribute to multiple cellular functions, including cell fusion events during myogenesis. We have identified a tripartite motif (TRIM72) family member protein named MG53 and defined its role in mediating the dynamic process of membrane fusion and exocytosis in striated muscle. MG53 is a muscle-specific protein that contains a TRIM motif at the amino terminus and a SPRY motif at the carboxyl terminus. Live cell imaging of green fluorescent protein-MG53 fusion construct in cultured myoblasts showed that although MG53 contains no transmembrane segment it is tightly associated with intracellular vesicles and sarcolemmal membrane. RNA interference-mediated knockdown of MG53 expression impeded myoblast differentiation, whereas overexpression of MG53 enhanced vesicle trafficking to and budding from sarcolemmal membrane.

Our data reveal a new function for TRIM family proteins in regulating membrane trafficking and fusion in striated muscles. When myoblasts exit the cell cycle during myogenesis, dramatic changes in membrane organization occur as myoblast fusion allows the formation of multinucleated muscle fibers. In addition to cell fusion events, differentiation of myotubes involves establishment of specialized membrane structures (1Flucher B.E. Phillips J.L. Powell J.A. Andrews S.B. Daniels M.P. Dev.

The transverse tubular invagination of sarcolemmal membrane and the intracellular membrane network known as the sarcoplasmic reticulum are two highly organized membrane architectures in cardiac and skeletal muscle. Establishment of these intricate membrane compartments requires extensive remodeling of the immature myoblast membranes. Dynamic membrane remodeling also contributes to many physiologic processes in mature muscle, including Ca2+ signaling, trafficking of glucose transporter (GLUT4), and other membrane internalization events involving caveolae structures (3Moyers J.S.

Members of this protein family contain signature motifs that include a RING finger, a zinc binding moiety (B-box), and a coiled coil structure (RBCC), which invariably comprise the amino-terminal domain of TRIM family members (9Meroni G. Diez-Roux G. BioEssays.. 2005; 27: 1147-1157Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal sequence of TRIM proteins is variable; in some cases a subfamily of TRIM proteins contains a SPRY domain, a sequence first observed in the ryanodine receptor Ca2+ channel in the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane of excitable cells (10Ponting C. Schultz J. Bork P. Trends Biochem. Sci... 1997; 22: 193-194Google Scholar). Extensive studies have revealed that protein-protein interactions in the cytosol mediate the defined functions of TRIM proteins. For example, the ubiquitin E3 ligase enzymatic activity of several TRIM family members requires the B-box motif (11Vichi A. Payne D.M. Pacheco-Rodriguez G. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Recent studies have also indicated a role for TRIM proteins in defense against events involving membrane penetration, such as protection against infection by various viruses, including human immunodeficiency virus (13Keckesova Z.

Although most of the studies concentrate on the cytosolic action of TRIM, limited reports have investigated the role of TRIM proteins in membrane signaling or recycling. We have previously established an immunoproteomics approach that allows definition of novel components involved in myogenesis, Ca2+ signaling, and maintenance of membrane integrity in striated muscle (16Weisleder N. Takeshima H. Ma J. Cell Calcium.. 2008; 43: 1-8Google Scholar). Using this approach, we have shown that junctophilin is a structural protein that establishes functional communication between sarcoplasmic reticulum and transverse tubule membranes at triad and dyad junctions in striated muscle (17Ito K.

Kurebayashi N. Ogawa Y. Noda T. Iino M. Takeshima H. J. Cell Biol... 1999; 147: 1473-1480Google Scholar, 21Pan Z. Yang D. Nagaraj R.Y. Nosek T.A. Nishi M. Takeshima H. Cheng H. Ma J. Nat. Cell Biol... 2002; 4: 379-383Google Scholar). Screening of this immunoproteomics library led to the recent identification of MG53, a muscle-specific TRIM family protein (22Cai C. Masumiya H. Weisleder N. Matsuda N. Nishi N. Hwang M. Ko J. Lin P. Thornton A. Zhao X. Pan Z. Komazaki S. Brotto M. Takeshima H. Ma J. Nat. Cell Biol... 2009; 11: 56-64Google Scholar). Domain homology analysis revealed that MG53 contains the prototypical RBCC motifs plus a SPRY domain at the carboxyl terminus. Genetic knock-out and functional studies reveal that MG53 nucleates the assembly of the sarcolemmal membrane repair machinery to restore cellular integrity following acute damage to the muscle fiber (22Cai C. Masumiya H. Weisleder N. Matsuda N. Nishi N. Hwang M. Ko J. Lin P. Thornton A. Zhao X. Pan Z. Komazaki S. Brotto M. Takeshima H. Ma J. Nat. Cell Biol... 2009; 11: 56-64Google Scholar). Here we present evidence illustrating that MG53, in contrast to other known TRIM proteins, can localize to intracellular vesicles and the sarcolemmal membrane. A functional interaction between MG53 and caveolin-3, another muscle-specific protein, plays an essential role in regulating the dynamic process of membrane budding and exocytosis in skeletal muscle. Plasmid Construction—The full-length mouse MG53 cDNA and associated truncation mutants were generated by PCR using the primers described in supplemental Table 1. For construction of pCMS-MG53, after digestion by the appropriate restriction enzymes, the PCR-amplified cDNA was inserted into pCMS-EGFP vector (Invitrogen) at NheI/XbaI sites. For construction of GFP-MG53, GFP-TRIM, GFP-SPRY, MG53-GFP, TRIM-GFP, and SPRY-GFP, PCR products were inserted into pEGFP-C1 at the XhoI/XbaI sites or pEGFP-N1 at the XhoI/KpnI sites. Cell Culture—The C2C12 myoblast cell line was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Cells were grown in a humidified environment at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for C2C12 or Ham's F-12 medium for Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. To induce myotube differentiation, C2C12 myoblasts were grown to confluence, and the medium was switched to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2% horse serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. For transient transfections, C2C12 myoblasts or CHO cells were plated at 70% confluence in glass-bottomed dishes. After 24 h, cells were transfected with plasmids described above using GeneJammer reagent (Stratagene). Cells were visualized by live cell confocal imaging at 24-48 h after transfection or at times indicated for individual experiments. In some experiments, C2C12 myoblasts were allowed to differentiate into myotubes for the indicated time before observation. Immunostaining and Electron Microscopy—Immunochemical analyses using mAb5259 were carried out as described previously (23Takeshima H. Shimuta M. Komazaki S. Ohmi K. Nishi M. Iino M. Miyata A. Kangawa K. Biochem. J... 1998; 331: 317-322Google Scholar). For MG53 expression in amphibian embryonic cells, cRNA for rabbit MG53 was prepared using a commercial kit (Megascript, Ambion). Newt embryos (1-8 cell stages) were injected with cRNA (∼70 ng/embryo), incubated for a day, and analyzed using electron microscopy as described previously (24Komazaki S. Nishi M. Kangawa K. Takeshima H. Dev. Dyn... 1999; 215: 87-95Google Scholar). For tracking the endocytosis using cationic ferritin, a solution containing 10 mg/ml cationic ferritin (cationic ferritin-N,N-dimethyl-1,3-propanediamine, Sigma) and 0.15 m NaCl was injected into the blastocoelic cavity of embryos (∼0.6 μl/embryo). Live Cell Imaging—To monitor intracellular trafficking of GFP-MG53, CHO or C2C12 cells were cultured in glass-bottomed dishes (Bioptechs Inc.) and transfected with the plasmids described above. Fluorescence images were captured at 3.18 s/frame using a Bio-Rad 2100 Radiance laser scanning confocal microscope with a 63× 1.3 numerical aperture oil immersion objective. RNA Interference Assay—The target sequence for small hairpin RNA (shRNA) knockdown of MG53 is at position 622-642 (GAG CTG TCA AGC CTG AAC TCT) in the mouse MG53 cDNA. For caveolin-3, the target sequence is at position 363-380 (GAC ATT CAC TGC AAG GAG ATA). Complementary sense and antisense oligonucleotides were synthesized using sequences described in supplemental Table 2. To construct the MG53 shRNA and control plasmids, annealed oligonucleotides were inserted into psiRNA-hH1GFPzeo G2 (InvivoGene) at the Acc65I/HindIII restriction enzyme sites. For caveolin-3 shRNA and control plasmids, annealed oligonucleotides were inserted into pRNAiDsRed vector (BD Biosciences) at the EcoRI/BamHI restriction enzyme sites. Each vector has a fluorescent protein expression cassette (green or red) under control of a separate promoter that acts as a marker of cell transfection. All plasmids were confirmed by direct sequencing with flanking primers, and the down-regulation of MG53 and caveolin-3 protein expression was examined by Western blot analysis. Western Blot and Co-immunoprecipitation—C2C12 or CHO cells were harvested and lysed with ice-cold modified RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) in the presence of a mixture of protease inhibitors (Sigma). 20 μg of total protein were separated on a 4-12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Immunoblot of MG53 was performed with either mAb5259 or polyclonal anti-MG53 antibodies. A standard protocol was used for co-immunoprecipitation studies of MG53 and caveolin-3. In brief, skeletal muscle tissue or C2C12 myotubes were lysed in 0.5 ml of modified RIPA buffer. The whole cell lysate (500 μg) was incubated overnight with 5 μg of polyclonal rabbit anti-MG53 or monoclonal anti-caveolin-3 antibody. As a negative control, 500 μg of whole cell lysate was incubated with 5 μg of normal rabbit or mouse IgG and processed as described above. The immune complexes were collected on protein G-Sepharose beads by incubating for 2 h and washed four times with RIPA buffer. Overexpression of MG53 Produces Filopodia-like Structures in Both Excitable and Non-excitable Cells—To elucidate the cell biological function of MG53, we expressed the MG53 cDNA in C2C12 myogenic cells as well as CHO cells. C2C12 cells at the myoblast stage do not express endogenous MG53 protein; however, differentiated C2C12 myotubes do express MG53. CHO cells are non-excitable epithelial cells that contain no endogenous MG53 protein. As shown in Fig. 1A, transient transfection of MG53 cDNA into C2C12 myoblasts or CHO cells produced the expression of a recombinant protein of 53 kDa that could be recognized by mAb5259. The molecular size of the recombinant protein is identical to the endogenous MG53 present in both rabbit and mouse muscles, thus confirming the identity of the isolated cDNA clone as MG53. Co-transfection of cells with two plasmids containing cDNAs that encode either enhanced GFP or MG53 at a ratio of 10:1 provided a convenient method to identify transfected cells by fluorescence microscopy. With confocal microscopic imaging, we observed dramatic changes in morphology of cells transiently transfected with MG53 (Fig. 1B). Specifically extensions of the cell surface membranes formed distinct filopodia-like structures in both CHO cells and C2C12 myoblasts that transiently overexpress MG53. To further examine the MG53-induced changes in cell morphology, we generated two GFP fusion constructs of MG53, GFP-MG53 and MG53-GFP, with attachment of GFP to the amino terminus or carboxyl terminus of MG53, respectively. Although both fusion proteins can be expressed in CHO cells and C2C12 myoblasts (Fig. 1A), the subcellular distribution and functional effects of GFP-MG53 and MG53-GFP were drastically different. Using confocal microscopy, we found that GFP-MG53 fusion proteins were localized to both intracellular vesicles and cell surface membranes in both CHO and C2C12 cells (Fig. 1C, left panels). This result is consistent with our electron microscopic localization of MG53 in skeletal muscle fibers (22Cai C. Masumiya H. Weisleder N. Matsuda N. Nishi N. Hwang M. Ko J. Lin P. Thornton A. Zhao X. Pan Z. Komazaki S. Brotto M. Takeshima H. Ma J. Nat. Cell Biol... 2009; 11: 56-64Google Scholar) and suggests that MG53 may participate in membrane trafficking events in muscle cells. Interestingly the distribution pattern of MG53-GFP fusion protein was mostly cytosolic in both CHO and C2C12 cells (Fig. 1C, right panels), which is in sharp contrast to the membrane-attached distribution of GFP-MG53. In addition, the extensive filopodia-like membrane extensions induced by overexpression of MG53 or GFP-MG53 was completely absent in cells transfected with MG53-GFP. Because shielding the carboxyl terminus of MG53 by fusion with GFP alters the subcellular distribution of MG53, it is likely that the SPRY motif at the carboxyl-terminal end of MG53 plays a role in anchoring MG53 to the different membrane compartments (see Fig. 7). Live cell fluorescence imaging identified dynamic trafficking of intracellular vesicles and active exocytotic fusion and vesicle budding at the cell surface membrane in cells overexpressing GFP-MG53 (22Cai C. Masumiya H. Weisleder N. Matsuda N. Nishi N. Hwang M. Ko J. Lin P. Thornton A. Zhao X. Pan Z. Komazaki S. Brotto M. Takeshima H. Ma J. Nat. Cell Biol... 2009; 11: 56-64Google Scholar). Close examination revealed the occurrence of vesicle fusion events at the surface membrane (Fig. 1D, left panel). Budding of vesicles containing GFP-MG53 could be clearly identified as well as released extracellular vesicles observed in the vicinity of transfected cells (Fig. 1D, right panel). Typically C2C12 myoblast cells could sustain GFP-MG53 overexpression for 48-72 h and exhibited a consistent pattern of GFP-MG53 vesicle trafficking. Prolonged overexpression of MG53 leads to progressive apoptosis due to disrupted intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis (not shown). Although there is no membrane-spanning segment or lipid modification motif in its primary structure, MG53 appears to be primarily restricted to membrane structures in skeletal muscle based on several observations. First, MG53 was recovered in microsomal membrane vesicles but not in cytosolic fractions during biochemical fractionations of skeletal muscle tissues (not shown). Second, immunohistochemical analysis with mAb5259 showed specific labeling for MG53 in the sarcolemmal and transverse tubule membranes in longitudinal sections of skeletal muscle fibers (Fig. 2A). Moreover transverse sections revealed a localized concentration of MG53 near sarcolemmal membrane with a broader staining pattern than is typically observed for integral membrane proteins of the sarcolemma (Fig. 2B). A role for MG53 in intracellular membrane formation was confirmed in amphibian embryonic cells where injection of MG53 cRNA generated distinct intracellular vesicular structures that can be continuous with the extracellular space. Vesicle formation could be observed by electron microscopy in many cells expressing MG53 (Fig. 2C). On average, vacuoles near the plasma membrane were frequently found in cells expressing MG53 (42.6 ± 2.3%, data from 21 embryos), which is significantly higher than those of control cells (4.7 ± 1.5% from 11 embryos, p < 0.001). These vesicles could make contact with the extracellular space as illustrated by their ability to take up ferritin from the extracellular space (Fig. 2D, arrow). MG53 Contributes to Skeletal Muscle Myogenesis by Regulating Myoblast Differentiation—To directly examine the role of MG53-mediated membrane fusion on the myogenesis of skeletal muscle, we used a specific RNA interference probe to knock down the expression of endogenous MG53 in differentiated C2C12 myotubes. The efficacy of an shRNA probe recognizing the nucleotide sequence 632-652 of the mouse MG53 cDNA in suppressing the expression of MG53 was assayed in CHO cells. For this study, CHO cells were transiently transfected with a 10:1 ratio of plasmids carrying either the shRNA-MG53 cDNA or the MG53 cDNA. As shown in Fig. 3A, a greater than 80% reduction of MG53 expression was observed in cells transfected with shRNA-MG53 as compared with cells transfected with a nonspecific shRNA probe. Acute suppression of MG53 resulted in a marked decrease in C2C12 myotube differentiation (Fig. 3B). As a control, C2C12 myoblasts transfected with a nonspecific shRNA probe exhibited a normal differentiation pattern with numerous multinucleated myotubes present by day 5 following serum withdrawal. Mature myotubes were widely distributed by day 10 of differentiation. In contrast, C2C12 myoblasts transfected with the shRNA-MG53 probe formed significantly fewer myotubes at both day 5 and day 10 after serum deprivation-induced differentiation (Fig. 3C). These results suggest that normal expression of MG53 is necessary for the differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts into myotubes. Functional Interaction between MG53 and Caveolin-3 Regulates Dynamic Membrane Budding Process in Skeletal Muscle—Our findings suggest that overexpression of MG53 can drive active membrane fusion and budding in both muscle and non-muscle cells and that down-regulation of MG53 results in compromised capacity of myotube differentiation. Further understanding of the physiological function of MG53 requires examination of how MG53-mediated membrane recycling contributes to the normal muscle differentiation process and what accessory factors regulate MG53 function in myogenesis. As shown in Fig. 4A, MG53 expression was associated with C2C12 myotube differentiation. The expression of MG53 is absent in myoblast stage and is induced following initiation of differentiation. Interestingly expression of caveolin-3, a muscle-specific caveolin isoform associated with muscle differentiation (25Parton R.G. Way M. Zorzi N. Stang E. J. Cell Biol... 1997; 136: 137-154Google Scholar, 26Galbiati F. Volonte D. Engelman J.A. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 30315-30321Google Scholar), follows the initiation of MG53 expression. The specific role of caveolin-3 in muscle differentiation is evidenced by the continuous presence of caveolin-1, a ubiquitous structural protein associated with caveolae in all cell types, throughout all stages of C2C12 differentiation. Using a co-immunoprecipitation assay, we found that MG53 can physically interact with caveolin-3 (Fig. 4B). It is interesting to note that the distinct filopodia-like structures appearing in C2C12 myoblast overexpressing MG53 disappeared following differentiation of these myoblasts into myotubes (Fig. 4, C and E). Because filopodia-like structures are not observed in either myoblasts that contain no endogenous MG53 or mature muscle fibers that contain endogenous MG53, the action of MG53 may be controlled by repression of MG53 expression in myoblasts and/or by regulatory mechanisms in mature myotubes and adult muscle fibers that may involve accessory proteins. Because caveolin-3 is developmentally regulated and can interact with MG53, we tested whether MG53-induced filopodia-like structure in C2C12 myoblasts or CHO cells could be influenced by the overexpression of caveolin-3. As shown in Fig. 4D, concurrent overexpression of caveolin-3 and MG53 in either C2C12 myoblasts or CHO cells led to remarkable inhibition of the appearance of filopodia-like structures associated with GFP-MG53 overexpression. On average, CHO cells or C2C12 myoblasts transfected with caveolin-3 and GFP-MG53 (in a ratio of 10:1) exhibited 74 ± 5 and 82 ± 6% reduction in the appearance of filopodia-like structures, respectively. These results suggest that caveolin-3 represents one of the molecular regulators of MG53-mediated membrane fusion events. Down-regulation of Caveolin-3 Inhibits Myoblast Differentiation into Myotubes without Affecting Filopodia-like Structures Induced by GFP-MG53 Overexpression—To further investigate the role of caveolin-3 in the subcellular distribution of MG53 and the formation of filopodia-like structures, we constructed a caveolin-3 shRNA plasmid that includes an independent red fluorescence protein expression cassette to provide a marker for shRNA transfected cells. Western blot analysis shown in Fig. 5A revealed that the shRNA-cav3 probe can suppress caveolin-3 expression in CHO cells transiently transfected with the caveolin-3 cDNA without affecting the expression of caveolin-1. Although C2C12 myoblasts transfected with a nonspecific shRNA exhibited a normal differentiation pattern as shown by the abundant red fluorescence-labeled myotubes in Fig. 5B (left panel), acute suppression of caveolin-3 could significantly inhibit the differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts into myotubes (Fig. 5B, right panel). On average, less than 10% of the shRNA-cav3-transfected myoblasts marked by red fluorescence could differentiate into mature myotubes at day 6 after application of differentiation media (Fig. 5C). This result is consistent with previous studies by other investigators, who showed that the expression of caveolin-3 is essential for differentiation of C2C12 myotubes (25Parton R.G. Way M. Zorzi N. Stang E. J. Cell Biol... 1997; 136: 137-154Google Scholar, 26Galbiati F. Volonte D. Engelman J.A. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 30315-30321Google Scholar). Confocal microscopic imaging showed that transfection of shRNA-cav3 into C2C12 myoblasts did not appear to affect the subcellular distribution of GFP-MG53 expressed in these cells (Fig. 5D). In particular, the distinct pattern of vesicular distribution of GFP-MG53 and filopodia-like membrane structures remained unaffected by the transient transfection with either shRNA-cav3 or the nonspecific shRNA. This result is consistent with the lack of expression of caveolin-3 in the myoblast stage of C2C12 cells. The efficacy of the shRNA-cav3 probe to knock down the expression of caveolin-3 in C2C12 myotubes is difficult to assess because of the intrinsic role of caveolin-3 in mediating myotube formation (Fig. 5B). This also complicates analysis of the functional interaction between MG53 and caveolin-3; however, additional chemical means can be used to affect caveolin-3 organization in cell membranes. MG53-mediated Exocytosis Is Enhanced by Extraction of Cell Membrane Cholesterol with Methyl-β-cyclodextrin—Because of the essential nature of caveolin-3 in myotube differentiation, we tested the effect of methyl-β-cyclodextrin (M-βCD) on C2C12 myoblasts overexpressing GFP-MG53 to further assay the functional impact of MG53-caveolin interaction on membrane recycling. M-βCD can extract cholesterol from cell membranes and has been widely used as an agent to disrupt caveolae structures (27Smith R.D. Babiychuk E.B. Noble K. Draeger A. Wray S. Am. J. Physiol... 2005; 288: C982-C988Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6A, myoblasts overexpressing GFP-MG53 exhibited spontaneous fusion of vesicles both intracellularly as well as at the sarcolemmal membrane (see supplemental movie 1). These spontaneous fusion events were slow and occurred in the order of minutes. Following treatment with M-βCD, exocytotic events became greatly enhanced resulting in accelerated membrane fusion and massive budding of membrane vesicles (Fig. 6B). These initial alterations were rapidly induced, and extended incubation with M-βCD resulted in solubilization of GFP-MG53 within the myoblast (Fig. 6C). For visualization of the dynamic changes of membrane fusion events induced by M-βCD treatment, please see supplemental movie 2. These results re-enforce our observation that caveolin-mediated internalization of membrane vesicles likely play a regulatory role in preventing excessive exocytosis generated by MG53 overexpression. TRIM and SPRY Domains of MG53 Contribute Differentially to Membrane Targeting and Trafficking—Our observation shown in Fig. 1C revealed a remarkable polarity of GFP fusion to MG53 in the intracellular distribution of MG53. In particular, fusion of GFP to the carboxyl-terminal end of MG53 altered the ability of MG53 to partition to the vesicular compartment and to target to sarcolemmal membrane. To further test the function of the TRIM and SPRY domains in facilitating the membrane fusion function of MG53, we generated a series of deletion mutants coupled to GFP (Fig. 7A). To analyze the subcellular localization of these mutant constructs of MG53, confocal microscopic imaging was applied to C2C12 myoblasts following transient expression. As shown in Fig. 7B (right panels), GFP-TRIM or TRIM-GFP were predominantly localized to intracellular vesicles without apparent labeling of sarcolemmal membrane. This result suggests that the SPRY domain, which is absent from GFP-TRIM or TRIM-GFP, is necessary for targeting of MG53 to sarcolemmal membrane. The fact that MG53-GFP exhibited a predominantly cytosolic distribution (Fig. 7B, left panel) further supports the role of SPRY in targeting MG53 to the cell surface membrane. Interestingly although GFP-SPRY or SPRY-GFP displayed a predominantly cytosolic pattern of distribution, they are clearly excluded from intracellular vesicles (Fig. 7B, middle panels). The cytosolic distribution pattern coupled with the exclusion of localization at intracellular vesicles of GFP-SPRY and SPRY-GFP likely reflects the role of TRIM. Presumably the TRIM motif can mediate the adherence of MG53 to intracellular vesicles (Fig. 7B, right panels). The SPRY domain is insufficient to target to the sarcolemma by itself; therefore the TRIM domain must be present in tandem with the SPRY domain for proper trafficking of MG53 to sarcolemmal membrane. In addition, our co-immunoprecipitation data show that caveolin-3 interacts with the TRIM motif of MG53 (Fig. 7C). Thus, it is possible that the functional interaction between MG53 and caveolin-3 may underlie some of the cellular factors contributing to the diffuse pattern of GFP-SPRY and SPRY-GFP in C2C12 myoblasts. Overall the regulated distribution of MG53 to the cell surface and intracellular compartments would likely result from coordinated action between the TRIM and SPRY domains. This requirement for both TRIM and SPRY for proper MG53 subcellular localization also has apparent functional significance as none of these deletion mutants display the filopodia-like structures or the robust vesicle budding events observed from overexpression of full-length MG53. Fusion, budding, and internalization of cell surface membranes are active cellular processes involved in a wide variety of physiological functions. Disruption of these membrane-remodeling mechanisms can result in a loss of membrane integrity and defective cell signaling pathways. Although muscle cells are traditionally thought to be terminally differentiated, extensive remodeling of sarcolemmal membrane still takes place under physiological and pathophysiological conditions, including trafficking and internalization of membrane transporters and muscle fiber regeneration following injury or denervation (28Valentine B.A. Cooper B.J. Cummings J.F. de Lahunta A. J. Neurol. Sci... 1990; 97: 1-23Google Scholar, 29Fiori M.G. Salvi F. Plasmati R. Tassinari C.A. Clin. Neuropathol... 1996; 15: 240-247Google Scholar). The molecular machinery that regulates this process during development, disease, and senescence is not well understood. Here we show that a novel TRIM/RBCC family member protein, MG53, is a key component in driving membrane fusion, budding, and exocytosis. MG53 is unique in that it is only observed in striated muscle cells, and in contrast to most other defined TRIM/RBCC members, it is intimately associated with membrane trafficking. The TRIM family of proteins is large and displays diverse cell biological functions (12Kudryashova E. Kudryashov D. Kramerova I. Spencer M.J. J. Mol. Biol... 2005; 354: 413-424Google Scholar, 30Wang Y. Li Y. Qi X. Yuan W. Ai J. Zhu C. Cao L. Yang H. Liu F. Wu X. Liu M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun... 2004; 323: 9-16Google Scholar). Previous studies have linked TRIM protein function to several human diseases, including muscular dystrophy, viral infection, and cancer progression (9Meroni G. Diez-Roux G. BioEssays.. 2005; 27: 1147-1157Google Scholar). Attempts at understanding the cell biological function of TRIM proteins have focused on the role of various protein motifs in mediating intracellular signaling events. For example, the coiled coil motif has been shown to facilitate protein dimerization, a characteristic required for coordinated function of TRIM proteins (31Chakrabarty T. Xiao M. Cooke R. Selvin P.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2002; 99: 6011-6016Google Scholar, 32Ward N.L. Van Slyke P. Dumont D.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun... 2004; 323: 937-946Google Scholar). The RING and B-box motifs contain intrinsic E3 ligase enzymatic activity, which has been shown to regulate protein degradation in many cell types (33Wei X. Yu Z.K. Ramalingam A. Grossman S.R. Yu J.H. Bloch D.B. Maki C.G. J. Biol. Chem... 2003; 278: 29288-29297Google Scholar), particularly in the progression of muscle atrophy (12Kudryashova E. Kudryashov D. Kramerova I. Spencer M.J. J. Mol. Biol... 2005; 354: 413-424Google Scholar). Previous studies have also linked TRIM proteins to neuronal outgrowth and structural plasticity (34van Diepen M.T. Spencer G.E. van Minnen J. Gouwenberg Y. Bouwman J. Smit A.B. van Kesteren R.E. Mol. Cell. Neurosci... 2005; 29: 74-81Google Scholar) as well as synaptic vesicle exocytosis (35Li Y. Chin L.S. Weigel C. Li L. J. Biol. Chem... 2001; 276: 40824-40833Google Scholar). Because a limited number of the TRIM family members contain a carboxyl-terminal SPRY domain, the function of the SPRY domain has only recently been examined (14Javanbakht H. Diaz-Griffero F. Stremlau M. Si Z. Sodroski J. J. Biol. Chem... 2005; 280: 26933-26940Google Scholar, 36Rhodes D.A. de Bono B. Trowsdale J. Immunology.. 2005; 116: 411-417Google Scholar, 37Nakayama E.E. Miyoshi H.

Virol... 2005; 79: 6111-6121Google Scholar). Several studies have suggested that a variable region within the SPRY domain of TRIM5α in rhesus monkeys can mediate immunity to human immunodeficiency virus infection (13Keckesova Z. Ylinen L.M. Towers G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2004; 101: 10780-10785Google Scholar, 14Javanbakht H. Diaz-Griffero F. Stremlau M. Si Z. Sodroski J. J. Biol. Chem... 2005; 280: 26933-26940Google Scholar, 15Sawyer S.L. Wu L.I. Emerman M. Malik H.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2005; 102: 2832-2837Google Scholar, 37Nakayama E.E. Miyoshi H. Nagai Y. Shioda T. J. Virol... 2005; 79: 8870-8877Google Scholar). The MG53 gene identified in our study belongs to this TRIM subfamily containing a SPRY domain. Our studies with MG53 reveal a new cell biological function for the TRIM protein family in striated muscle that involves membrane remodeling and signaling that is dependent on the presence of a SPRY domain in tandem with the TRIM motif. Our previous studies showed that MG53 can function in the repair of sarcolemmal membrane following acute cell injury (22Cai C. Masumiya H. Weisleder N. Matsuda N. Nishi N. Hwang M. Ko J. Lin P. Thornton A. Zhao X. Pan Z. Komazaki S. Brotto M. Takeshima H. Ma J. Nat. Cell Biol... 2009; 11: 56-64Google Scholar). Those finding are consistent with our observation here that MG53 participates in vesicle trafficking in the course of normal cellular physiology. It has been suggested previously that the cell membrane repair process is an emergency response by the cell where cellular components with a certain role in the course of normal cell function are repurposed to act in the resealing of damaged cell membranes (39McNeil P.L. Kirchhausen T. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol... 2005; 6: 499-505Google Scholar). Considering that translocation of intracellular vesicles to injury sites on the cell membrane would be an essential step in repair of the membrane, a role for MG53 in the normal process of intracellular vesicle trafficking seems to be in agreement with another critical function in repairing potentially catastrophic injury to muscle cells. Based on our electron and confocal microscopic results, we found that MG53 is tethered to intracellular vesicles that traffic between different subcellular compartments with the majority of the protein restricted to a space near sarcolemmal membrane. MG53 can drive the active exocytotic process in both excitable and non-excitable cells as evidenced by the appearance of filopodia-like structures in cells overexpressing either MG53 or GFP-MG53. In skeletal muscle, MG53 appears to contribute to myogenesis as RNA interference-mediated suppression of MG53 attenuated myoblast fusion and myotube formation. These findings should provide new insights into our understanding of TRIM protein function. The primary amino acid sequence of MG53 contains no transmembrane domains or lipid modification motifs, suggesting that the localization of MG53 may involve interaction with accessory proteins. Through biochemical studies we found that MG53 can interact with caveolin-3, a muscle-specific protein associated with caveolae. Expression of MG53 precedes the appearance of caveolin-3 during myogenic differentiation of C2C12 cells. Thus, caveolin-3 may represent a regulatory factor that moderates the robust membrane trafficking events generated by the presence of MG53. We show that overexpression of caveolin-3 can down-regulate membrane budding induced by MG53 overexpression and prevent the formation of filopodia-like structures. For maintenance of muscle membrane integrity, a balance of exocytosis and membrane internalization must be well controlled under physiologic conditions. The identified MG53-caveolin interaction has important implications for muscle physiology and pathophysiology. Extensive studies have linked caveolin-3 to muscle differentiation (40Volonte D. Peoples A.J. Galbiati F. Mol. Biol. Cell.. 2003; 14: 4075-4088Google Scholar). Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy is associated with a mutation in caveolin-3 that leads to loss of ∼95% of caveolin-3 expression. A caveolin-3-null mutation in mice produces defects in skeletal muscle membrane trafficking and a concurrent disruption of transverse tubule membrane organization (40Volonte D. Peoples A.J. Galbiati F. Mol. Biol. Cell.. 2003; 14: 4075-4088Google Scholar, 41Galbiati F. Engelman J.A. Volonte D. Zhang X.L. Minetti C. Li M. Hou Jr., H. Kneitz B. Edelmann W. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol.

A... 2004; 101: 12670-12675Google Scholar), phenotypes that are associated with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. Interestingly transgenic overexpression of caveolin-3 has also been shown to result in severe muscular degeneration similar to Duchenne muscular dystrophy (43Galbiati F. Volonte D. Chu J.B. Li M. Fine S.W. Fu M. Bermudez J. Pedemonte M. Weidenheim K.M. Pestell R.G. Minetti C. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2000; 97: 9689-9694Google Scholar). Therefore, caveolin-3 function appears to be essential for myogenesis and maintenance of muscle integrity. Our results suggest that caveolin-3 expression can control MG53 activity. Presumably some aspects of caveolin-3 function may involve its interaction with MG53, so the loss of caveolin-3 in development may lead to aberrant MG53-mediated membrane remodeling. One can envision that targeting MG53-caveolin3 interaction would represent an effective therapy for muscle-related disease involving altered membrane structures. Trafficking of intracellular vesicles containing MG53 to sarcolemmal membrane requires coordinated function of the TRIM and SPRY domains. Our studies show that the SPRY domain is essential for targeting of MG53 to the cell membrane, whereas the TRIM domain mediates interaction with intracellular vesicles in the context of the MG53 molecule. These results not only demonstrate the importance of a coordinated action of TRIM and SPRY to facilitate membrane trafficking properties of MG53, but they also suggest the possibility that other TRIM family proteins carrying a similar SPRY domain may also exhibit membrane-modifying properties. Indeed a previous study by Perez-Caballero et al. (44Perez-Caballero D. Hatziioannou T. Yang A. Cowan S. Bieniasz P.D. J. Virol... 2005; 79: 8969-8978Google Scholar) demonstrated that both TRIM and SPRY domains of TRIM5α are required to provide cellular resistance to retroviral infection, although the membrane trafficking properties of TRIM5α have yet to be examined. It remains to be determined whether TRIM-SPRY intermolecular interactions produce intrinsic membrane targeting ability or whether additional cellular factors beyond caveolin-3 are required. In conclusion, we have shown that MG53 is an active component of membrane fusion, exocytosis, and vesicle budding that play an important role in myogenesis of striated muscle cells. The presence of the TRIM and SPRY motif in MG53 and a functional interaction with caveolin-3 are essential in regulating membrane trafficking and cellular signaling events across sarcolemmal membrane.

https://openalex.org/W2017709939,"Skeletal muscle is one of the main physiological targets of insulin, a hormone that triggers a complex signaling cascade and that enhances the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in different cell types. ROS, currently considered second messengers, produce redox modifications in proteins such as ion channels that induce changes in their functional properties. In myotubes, insulin also enhances calcium release from intracellular stores. In this work, we studied in myotubes whether insulin stimulated ROS production and investigated the mechanisms underlying the insulin-dependent calcium increase: in particular, whether the late phase of the Ca2+ increase induced by insulin required ROS. We found that insulin stimulated ROS production, as detected with the probe 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (CM-H2DCFDA). We used the translocation of p47phox from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane as a marker of the activation of NADPH oxidase. Insulin-stimulated ROS generation was suppressed by the NADPH oxidase inhibitor apocynin and by small interfering RNA against p47phox, a regulatory NADPH oxidase subunit. Additionally, both protein kinase C and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase are presumably involved in insulin-induced ROS generation because bisindolylmaleimide, a nonspecific protein kinase C inhibitor, and LY290042, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, inhibited this increase. Bisindolylmaleimide, LY290042, apocynin, small interfering RNA against p47phox, and two drugs that interfere with inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-mediated Ca2+ release, xestospongin C and U73122, inhibited the intracellular Ca2+ increase produced by insulin. These combined results strongly suggest that insulin induces ROS generation trough NADPH activation and that this ROS increase is required for the intracellular Ca2+ rise mediated by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors.

These combined results strongly suggest that insulin induces ROS generation trough NADPH activation and that this ROS increase is required for the intracellular Ca2+ rise mediated by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors. A transient intracellular Ca2+ increase is a key component of the excitation-coupling mechanism in skeletal muscle cells. Intracellular Ca2+ can also increase in response to stimuli other than membrane potential depolarization, including hormones such as insulin. We have previously reported that in myotubes, the addition of insulin produces a fast intracellular Ca2+ concentration transient, which requires external Ca2+ and is inhibited by the l-type Ca2+ channel blocker nifedipine and by ryanodine (1Espinosa A. Leiva A. Pena M. Muller M. Debandi A. Hidalgo C. Carrasco M.A. Jaimovich E. J. Cell. Physiol.. 2006; 209: 379-388Google Scholar). Other reports show that the Ca2+ increase evoked by insulin in skeletal muscle fibers depends on Ca2+ influx and is related to Glut-4 translocation (2Lanner J.T. Katz A. Tavi P. Sandstrom M.E. Zhang S.J. Wretman C. James S. Fauconnier J. Lannergren J. Bruton J.D. Westerblad H. Diabetes.. 2006; 55: 2077-2083Google Scholar). As steep changes in insulin concentration are unlikely to occur physiologically, we decided to explore changes in intracellular Ca2+ after longer exposure to insulin. We further investigated whether ROS 3The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; PKC, protein kinase C; PKB, protein kinase B; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; DAG, diacylglycerol; IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; IP3R, IP3 receptor; fluo-3AM, fluo-3 acetoxymethyl ester; CM-H2DCFDA, 7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate; DsRed, red fluorescent protein; BTK, Bruton's tyrosine kinase; PH, pleckstrin homology; GFP, green fluorescent protein; ROI, region of interest; DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide; siRNA, small interfering RNA; BIM, bisindolylmaleimide; IRS-1, insulin receptor substrate-1. play a role in this process. It is known that ROS modulate the activity of Ca2+ release channels (3Hidalgo C. Donoso P. Antioxid. Redox Signal.. 2008; 10: 1275-1312Google Scholar), and in particular, the activity of skeletal muscle ryanodine receptors is regulated by NADPH oxidase-dependent redox modifications (4Hidalgo C. Sanchez G. Barrientos G. Aracena-Parks P. J. Biol. Chem.. 2006; 281: 26473-26482Google Scholar). On the other hand, in target tissues, insulin is known to generate ROS, which participate in signaling processes triggered by the hormone (5Goldstein B.J. Mahadev K. Wu X. Zhu L. Motoshima H. Antioxid. Redox Signal.. 2005; 7: 1021-1031Google Scholar). There are many intracellular sources of ROS in mammalian cells, such as mitochondria, xanthine oxidase, and NADPH oxidase (6Kamata H. Hirata H. Cell. Signal.. 1999; 11: 1-14Google Scholar, 7Clempus R.E. Griendling K.K. Cardiovasc. Res.. 2006; 71: 216-225Google Scholar). We have reported the presence of NADPH oxidase subunits in myotubes (1Espinosa A. Leiva A. Pena M. Muller M. Debandi A. Hidalgo C. Carrasco M.A. Jaimovich E. J. Cell. Physiol.. 2006; 209: 379-388Google Scholar) and in adult skeletal muscle transverse tubules (4Hidalgo C. Sanchez G. Barrientos G. Aracena-Parks P. J. Biol. Chem.. 2006; 281: 26473-26482Google Scholar). Recently, the NADPH oxidase has been involved in modifications of tyrosine phosphates that shut down signals evoked by insulin in adipocytes (8Mahadev K. Motoshima H. Wu X. Ruddy J.M. Arnold R.S. Cheng G. Lambeth J.D. Goldstein B.J. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 2004; 24: 1844-1854Google Scholar). The phagocytic NADPH oxidase is composed of five subunits: two catalytic subunits located in the plasma membrane (p22phox and gp91phox) and three cytoplasmic subunits (p40phox, p47phox, and p67phox), plus the small GTP-binding protein rac-1. Upon activation, these subunits translocate to the plasma membrane to form the active enzyme (9Bedard K. Krause K.H. Physiol. Rev.. 2007; 87: 245-313Google Scholar). The regulatory p47phox subunit has an autoinhibitory domain; phosphorylation of p47phox in serine residues causes its translocation to the plasma membrane to form the active enzymatic complex. Activation of p47phox depends on several serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases such as protein kinase C (PKC) (10Bey E.A. Xu B. Bhattacharjee A. Oldfield C.M. Zhao X. Li Q. Subbulakshmi V.

Chem.. 2006; 281: 16128-16138Google Scholar). By inducing phosphorylation of its receptor on tyrosine residues, insulin initiates a well described signal transduction cascade (14Saltiel A.R. Kahn C.R. Nature.. 2001; 414: 799-806Google Scholar), which involves PI3K activation. Insulin can also activate phospholipase C and generate IP3 and diacylglycerol (DAG). These second messengers can induce Ca2+ release and PKC activation, respectively. The main goal of this work was to investigate the possible correlation between the increase in Ca2+ and ROS induced by insulin. We found that both PI3K and PKC are needed to activate NADPH oxidase to produce ROS and that ROS are involved in the delayed Ca2+ increase induced by insulin, which involves IP3 receptor (IP3R) activation by ROS. Reagents—Insulin, fluo-3 acetoxymethyl ester (fluo-3AM), Alexa Fluor 488 and Alexa Fluor 633, and chloromethyl-2,7-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (CM-H2DCFDA) were purchased from Invitrogen. Bordetella pertussis toxin was obtained from Calbiochem. Xestospongin C was a gift from Dr. Jordi Molgò (Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Gifsur-Yvette, France). Antibodies against insulin receptor, p47phox and gp91phox, were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgG were purchased from Pierce. A plasmid encoding DsRed (Clontech) was used as a transfection marker. The plasmids used encode the fusion protein between the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) and the enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) ((PH) BTK-GFP) or the (PHmut) BTK-GFP (punctual mutation R28C of the PH domain). Both plasmids were kindly provided by Dr. Tamas Balla (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). A plasmid that encodes for HyPer protein was acquired from Evrogen Joint Stock Company, Moscow, Russia. Cell Culture—Primary cultured cells were obtained from rat neonatal hind limbs. The muscle tissue was mechanically dispersed and then incubated under mild agitation with 10% (w/v) collagenase for 15 min at 37 °C. The suspension was filtered through a Nytex (Sartorius, Göttingen, Germany) membrane and spun down at low speed, preplating was used to partially eliminate fibroblasts, and finally, cells were plated onto dishes (60 mm) with coverslips at a density of 0.6 × 106/dish. The culture medium used was Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12, 10% bovine serum, 2.5% fetal calf serum, 100 mg/liter penicillin, 50 mg/liter streptomycin, and 2.5 mg/liter amphotericin B. To eliminate remaining fibroblasts, on the third day of culture, 10 μm cytosine arabinoside was added for 24 h. The medium was then replaced with serum-free medium. 6-8-day-old cultures were used. Ca2+ Measurement—Cytoplasmic Ca2+ images were obtained using inverted confocal microscopy (Carl Zeiss Pascal 5 LSM) from single, non-spontaneously contracting myotubes pre-loaded with fluo-3AM. Myotubes were washed with Krebs buffer (10 mm Hepes-Na, pH 7.4, 145 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2.6 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5.6 mm glucose,) and loaded with 5.4 μm fluo-3AM (added from a stock solution in 20% pluronic acid-DMSO) for 30 min at room temperature. Cell-containing coverslips were mounted in a 1-ml capacity plastic chamber and placed in the microscope for fluorescence measurements (band pass 505-530 nm) after excitation with a 488 nm argon laser. Determination of ROS Production—ROS generation was determined in skeletal muscle cells using CM-H2DCFA. Myotubes were cultured on glass coverslips and incubated with 5 μm CM-H2DCFA for 15 min at 37 °C. Cells on coverslips were washed with PBS and placed at the bottom of an incubation chamber, which was transferred to the confocal microscope. CM-H2DCFA fluorescence was detected using excitation/emission wavelengths λexc/λem = 488/505-530 nm. In all measurements a control of the effect of laser excitation alone was performed. Noise in the images was removed by the Image J software (National Institutes of Health). Inmunofluorescence—Cells were placed on coverslips and fixed with methanol at -20 °C for 15 min. The blockade was performed in 1% bovine serum albumin for 60 min, and the primary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4 °C. Cells were washed and incubated with secondary antibody during 2 h at room temperature. Coverslips were mounted in VECTASHIELD (Vector Laboratories, Inc.) for confocal microscopy, and representative images were acquired. Negative controls used only secondary antibodies. Image Capture and Quantification of Fluorescence—Confocal image stacks were captured with a Zeiss LSM-5, Pascal 5 Axiovert 200 microscope, using LSM 5 3.2 image capture, analysis software, and a Plan-Apochromat ×63/1.4 oil differential interference contrast objective. Two-channel fluorescent image stacks (intensity I (x,y,z), voxel size Δx/Δy/Δz = 50/50/300 nm) were recorded in the multitrack mode. Channel-1 (Alexa Fluor 488) was used with excitation/emission wave-lengths λexc/λem = 488/505-530 nm, and channel-2 (Alexa Fluor 633) was used with λexc/λem = 635/>650 nm. We made sure that I (x,y,z) did not saturate and that the image background was slightly above zero by carefully adjusting the laser power, the detector gain, and the detector offset. Image stacks were deconvoluted with Huygens Scripting (Scientific Volume Imaging, Hilversum, Netherlands). All following image processing routines were developed in our laboratory on the basis of IDL (Interactive Data Language, ITT, Boulder, CO). To determine p47phox in the plasma membrane and the cytoplasm of myotubes, segmentations were performed to define different regions of interest (ROIs). First, the cross-section of myotubes was segmented by an intensity threshold in the green fluorescence channel (see Fig. 3D, center). Remaining holes inside the cells and artifacts outside the cells were filled or removed by morphological filters. Second, we used a border detection filter to identify the plasma membrane with a constant thickness of 400 nm (see Fig. 3D, right). The nuclear region was defined manually using the bright field image and excluded from the segmented cells. The fluorescence intensities of the cytoplasm and the plasma membrane were determined in the ROIs and divided by the respective surfaces (I/μm2). For all experiments, the protocols remained constant, and the quality of the segmentation was controlled interactively by overlaying the original fluorescent images with the segmented ROIs. Co-localization Analysis—A reliable segmentation of cellular structures containing p47phox or α-actinin could not be obtained by a simple threshold value in fluorescence intensity because background intensities vary within the cell thickness across the image. We solved this problem by applying gradient filters and selecting threshold values in the gradient histograms, which resulted in a homogeneous definition of p47phox or α-actinin signals (see Fig. 3A). For the quantification of co-localization between p47phox and α-actinin (Fig. 3A, left, ROI1/green regions and ROI2/red regions), we calculated the Manders co-localization coefficients M1 and M2 (15Manders E.M. Verbeek F.J. Aten J.A. J. Microsc. (Oxf.).. 1993; 1993: 375-382Google Scholar). M1 and M2 sum up the contribution of the respective fluorescence intensities in the co-localizing region ICh1/2(ROI1 ∩ ROI2), and we divided the number by the sum of the fluorescence intensities inside of the segmented regions ICh1(ROI1) or ICh2(ROI2). M1 and M2 can be interpreted directly as the amount of co-localizing p47phox/α-actinin labeled structures (Fig. 3A, lower, yellow regions) with respect to the total amount of segmented p47phox/α-actinin signals (Fig. 3A, lower left panel, yellow region plus green/red region). To reveal the significance of the co-localization coefficients, we implemented a defined displacement algorithm (16Sanchez G. Escobar M. Pedrozo Z. Macho P. Domenech R. Hartel S. Hidalgo C. Donoso P. Cardiovasc. Res.. 2008; 77: 380-386Google Scholar). Defined displacement algorithm shifts one fluorescent channel with respect to the second channel in a radial manner and calculates M1 and M2 successively for each displacement. When the radial displacement is larger than the size of the segmented ROIs, the calculated Manders coefficients quantify random scenarios of fluorescent structures inside the cellular borders, which were used to calculate the M1/M2 minima values in Fig. 3B. Data Analysis—All experiments were performed in at least three different cultures, and at least three cells per culture were measured in each case. Results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Significance was evaluated using Student's t test for paired data and one-way analysis of variance followed by Dunnett's post hoc test for multiple column comparison to control column; p < 0.05 was considered significant. Insulin Induced ROS Generation through NADPH Oxidase Stimulation—Cultured myotubes preincubated with CM-H2DCFDA were stimulated with insulin to investigate insulin-induced ROS generation. Fig. 1A shows a representative experiment where images were acquired at different times after the addition of 50 nm insulin. This concentration was chosen because of its clear-cut effects on calcium transient generation (see below). The time dependence of the mean fluorescence increase mediated by the hormone is presented in Fig. 1B. A significant increase in intracellular ROS was evident 5 min after insulin stimulation. Cells incubated with apocynin, a specific inhibitor of p47phox-dependent NADPH oxidase (EC50 = 10 μm (7Clempus R.E. Griendling K.K. Cardiovasc. Res.. 2006; 71: 216-225Google Scholar)) displayed significantly reduced ROS production, and this effect was evident 5 min after insulin addition (Fig. 1B). To ascertain whether H2O2 is one of the ROS involved in this response, we used the HyPer protein, which is a genetically encoded fluorescent sensor for the specific detection of intracellular H2O2 (17Belousov V.V. Fradkov A.F. Lukyanov K.A. Staroverov D.B. Shakhbazov K.S. Terskikh A.V. Lukyanov S. Nat. Meth.. 2006; 3: 281-286Google Scholar). We measured the increase of HyPer fluorescence in myotubes after insulin stimulation. The increase in HyPer fluorescence was homogeneous in the cytoplasm of the myotube (Fig. 1C) and increased steadily in time, reaching a plateau of about 25-fold increase at 300 s; apocynin prevented this increase and even produced a small decrease of the initial endogenous levels of H2O2 (Fig. 1D). Role of the p47phox Subunit in ROS Generated by Insulin—The results obtained with apocynin strongly suggest that a p47phox-dependent NADPH oxidase is involved in ROS generation. To test this hypothesis, we measured insulin-dependent CM-H2DCFDA fluorescence in cells transfected with siRNA against p47phox, using siRNA with a random sequence as control (Fig. 2A). To identify the transfected cells, they were co-transfected with a plasmid encoding DsRed protein. Red-labeled cells, transfected with the random sequence, responded with a fluorescence increase 10 min after insulin stimulation (Fig. 2A). In contrast, red-labeled cells transfected with siRNA against p47phox did not respond to insulin, and the fluorescence signal was similar to that of cells expressing random siRNA in the basal state (Fig. 2, A and B). To evaluate whether p47phox expression was decreased in myotubes transfected with siRNA, we performed an immunofluorescence study against the p47phox subunit. The p47phox subunit was not detected in cells transfected with siRNA p47phox (Fig. 2C). To study the insulin-dependent activation of NADPH oxidase, we determined by immunofluorescence the translocation of p47phox. In basal conditions, p47phox showed a particular distribution in myotubes; the label was present in striations and displayed a significant co-localization with α-actinin, a Z line marker protein (Fig. 3, A and B). In the first minute after insulin addition, some p47phox label already appeared near the membrane (Fig. 3C, arrow). 15 min after stimulation, most of the label appeared in the periphery of myotubes, probably representing the location of the enzyme near the plasma membrane. At 60 min, the distribution of the fluorescence signal showed a pattern similar to the basal condition prior to insulin addition (Fig. 3C). We measured fluorescence intensity in regions of the cytoplasm and near the plasma membrane (Fig. 3D). We defined the region near the plasma membrane with a constant diameter of 400 nm and the region inside the cytoplasm excluding cell nuclei (Fig. 3D, right and center). In the region near the plasma membrane, a significant fluorescence increase was detected after insulin stimulation (Fig. 3E). This membrane location was seen only in stimulated sections, never in basal conditions (Fig. 3C shows different times). Cytoplasmic fluorescence decreases upon stimulation (Fig. 3E) concomitant to the increase in near membrane fluorescence; as both myotubes (basal and stimulated) were measured in identical conditions, these observed differences suggest p47phox translocation to the membrane region. Role of PI3K in ROS Generation—PI3K activation is a key event in insulin-dependent signal transduction, so we studied whether ROS generation depends on PI3K activity. Using a plasmid that encodes a fusion protein between the PH domain of BTK and the enhanced GFP ((PH)-BTK-GFP), we monitored the activation of PI3K as changes in probe fluorescence, considering that when PI3K is activated, it can recruit proteins with the PH domain to membranes. Cells transfected with (PH)-BTK-GFP showed basal fluorescence in nucleus and cytoplasm; 10 s after insulin stimulation, a distinct fluorescence increase appeared near the plasma membrane and in regions that may correspond to transverse tubules. This particular fluorescence increase disappeared after 90 s (Fig. 4A). These results indicate that activation of PI3K is an early event of the signal transduction cascade triggered by insulin that occurs prior to ROS generation. We next measured ROS generation induced by 50 nm insulin 15 min after stimulation in controls or in cells preincubated with different drugs. ROS production was completely prevented by genistein, an inhibitor of insulin receptor (Fig. 4B). LY290042, an inhibitor of the PI3K pathway, also produced a complete inhibition of fluorescence increase with respect to the control stimulated condition (Fig. 4B), suggesting that PI3K is a key player in ROS generation triggered by insulin. Previous reports suggest that PKB can phosphorylate p47phox. To probe the role of PKB in ROS generation, we used a PKB inhibitor, PKBI (Fig. 4C, PKBI). We measured ROS generation 30 min after insulin stimulation and found similar values for ROS production both in the presence of inhibitor and in control conditions (Fig. 4C). Accordingly, we can conclude that insulin-stimulated ROS generation is dependent on PI3K but not on PKB. To evaluate the participation of PI3K in the activation of NADPH oxidase, we studied the insulin-dependent translocation of p47phox to the plasma membrane in the presence of LY290042. As shown above, p47phox is present in the cytoplasm in basal conditions; after 10 min of insulin stimulation in the presence of LY290042, most of the label still remained in striations (Fig. 4C). There was some translocation in the presence of the inhibitor but clearly much less than in the control conditions illustrated in Fig. 3C. Role of PKC in ROS Generation—To study the possible role of PKC in insulin-dependent ROS generation, we preincubated myotubes with BIM, a general inhibitor of PKC. Incubation with BIM inhibited insulin-induced ROS generation (Fig. 5A). In addition, 0.5 μm BIM inhibited the increase in HyPer fluorescence induced by insulin (Fig. 5C) and also prevented the translocation of p47phox to the plasma membrane induced by insulin (Fig. 5B). Insulin Increased the Intracellular Ca2+ Concentration in Cultured Myotubes—We had some evidence for delayed Ca2+ oscillations occurring after the fast Ca2+ transient induced by insulin in myotubes (1Espinosa A. Leiva A. Pena M. Muller M. Debandi A. Hidalgo C. Carrasco M.A. Jaimovich E. J. Cell. Physiol.. 2006; 209: 379-388Google Scholar); these oscillations were seen at insulin concentrations as low as 1-10 nm but were consistently larger (80-fold increase in fluo-3 fluorescence) at 50 nm insulin. Accordingly, in this report, we performed a detailed study of these delayed Ca2+ signals in cultured myotubes using the fluorescence probe fluo-3AM. The insulin-dependent Ca2+ signals studied in this work are independent of the fast Ca2+ transients that require extracellular Ca2+ and functional ryanodine receptors (1Espinosa A. Leiva A. Pena M. Muller M. Debandi A. Hidalgo C. Carrasco M.A. Jaimovich E. J. Cell. Physiol.. 2006; 209: 379-388Google Scholar). Thus, in conditions in which the fast transient is absent (i.e. in the absence of external Ca2+), the delayed signal remained unchanged, whereas inhibitors of the slow Ca2+ signal (see below) did not affect the fast Ca2+ signal (for example, Fig. 6C). We investigated the possible role of NADPH oxidase-generated ROS on the slower Ca2+ signals produced by insulin. To that aim, we measured the effect of both diphenyliodonium (Fig. 6A, DPI) and apocynin on insulin-evoked signals. Preincubation of myotubes with both inhibitors abolished the insulin-dependent intracellular Ca2+ increases (Fig. 6A). On the same line, we studied the role of NADPH oxidase using siRNA against p47phox. Fig. 6B shows a representative response of transfected myotubes in which the Ca2+ increase produced by insulin was reduced significantly in myotubes transfected with siRNA against p47phox. In addition, the PKC inhibitor BIM decreased significantly the insulin-dependent Ca2+ increase, whereas the PI3K inhibitors wortmannin and LY290042 completely prevented this response (Fig. 6C). To test the involvement of IP3 receptors on Ca2+ signals, we preincubated the myotubes with two inhibitors of the IP3 pathway, U73122 and xestospongin C; the insulin-stimulated Ca2+ increase was abolished in both conditions (Fig. 6D). In this work, we provide evidence favoring a role for insulin in ROS generation due to NADPH oxidase activation in skeletal muscle cells. We show, in addition, that enhanced ROS generation forms part of the signaling mechanisms whereby insulin increases intracellular Ca2+ concentration. The fast increase of intracellular ROS produced by insulin was detected using both CM-H2DCFDA as fluorescence probe and a molecular recombinant protein that in vitro displays half-maximal increase in fluorescence at 10 μm H2O2. CM-H2DCFDA is a probe susceptible to oxidation by H2O2 and other ROS and nitric oxide-derived species, but transfection of myotubes with HyPer plasmid provided us with a specific tool to ascertain that 50 nm insulin produced H2O2. An increase in intracellular peroxide concentration was detected with both probes as early as 1 min after insulin addition. In various cell types, the NADPH oxidase has been described as the intracellular source of H2O2 (9Bedard K. Krause K.H. Physiol. Rev.. 2007; 87: 245-313Google Scholar). This enzyme has defensive functions in phagocytic cells, where it catalyzes the one-electron reduction of oxygen to release superoxide anion that rapidly dismutates to H2O2, a microbicide agent. However, in non-phagocytic cells, H2O2 is considered a second messenger due to its capacity to produce reversible post-translational oxidative modification of proteins (18Rhee S.G. Science.. 2006; 312: 1882-1883Google Scholar). We have reported previously that myotubes possess NADPH oxidase activity that is stimulated by membrane depolarization (1Espinosa A. Leiva A. Pena M. Muller M. Debandi A. Hidalgo C. Carrasco M.A. Jaimovich E. J. Cell. Physiol.. 2006; 209: 379-388Google Scholar). Here, we provide evidence indicating that insulin also stimulates a p47phox-dependent NADPH oxidase in skeletal muscle cells, as indicated by our findings that insulin-stimulated ROS generation was inhibited in myotubes preincubated with apocynin or transfected with an siRNA against p47phox. In addition, our current results, showing p47phox translocation from cytoplasmic striations to the plasma membrane from the first minute after stimulation with insulin (Fig. 3C), provide further support for NADPH oxidase activation by insulin. Ca2+ signals mediate a variety of physiological processes in skeletal muscle cells; in particular, muscle depolarization elicits fast Ca2+ signals that initiate muscle contraction and slower signals that regulate gene expression (19Jaimovich E. Espinosa A. Biol. Res.. 2004; 37: 625-633Google Scholar). Insulin-dependent Ca2+ influx has been implicated in glucose uptake in adult muscle fibers (2Lanner J.T. Katz A. Tavi P. Sandstrom M.E. Zhang S.J. Wretman C. James S. Fauconnier J. Lannergren J. Bruton J.D. Westerblad H. Diabetes.. 2006; 55: 2077-2083Google Scholar); in that case, a delayed effect (after 20 min) of insulin that required external Ca2+ was reported. A direct link between NADPH-mediated ROS production and glucose uptake seems unlikely because a recent report showed no inhibition of glucose uptake by apocynin in insulin-stimulated skeletal muscle cell lines and primary cultures (20Hutchinson D.S. Csikasz R.I. Yamamoto D.L. Shabalina I.G. Wikstrom P. Wilcke M. Bengtsson T. Cell. Signal.. 2007; 19: 1610-1620Google Scholar). Insulin has been involved in the regulation of the expression of a number of skeletal muscle genes related to carbohydrate metabolism and protein synthesis (21Rome S. Clement K. Rabasa-Lhoret R. Loizon E. Poitou C. Barsh G.S. Riou J.P. Laville M. Vidal H. J. Biol. Chem.. 2003; 278: 18063-18068Google Scholar). In skeletal muscle cells, Ca2+ release from IP3-dependent intracellular stores mediates the regulation of signaling cascades, leading to expression or repression of both early and late genes (22Powell J.A. Carrasco M.A. Adams D.S. Drouet B. Rios J. Muller M. Estrada M. Jaimovich E. J. Cell Sci.. 2001; 114: 3673-3683Google Scholar, 23Carrasco M.A. Riveros N. Rios J. Muller M. Torres F. Pineda J. Lantadilla S. Jaimovich E. Am. J. Physiol.. 2003; 284: C1438-C1447Google Scholar, 24Juretic N. Urzua U. Munroe D.J. Jaimovich E. Riveros N. J. Cell. Physiol.. 2007; 210: 819-830Google Scholar). IP3 receptors are highly dependent on its regulators and modulators (25Choe C.U. Ehrlich B.E. Science's STKE 2006.2006: re15Google Scholar). A redox sensor protein has been shown to regulate type 1 IP3R (26Mikoshiba K. J. Neurochem.. 2007; 102: 1426-1446Google Scholar), redox-sensitive free thiol groups have been identified in the IP3R molecule (27Joseph S.K. Nakao S.K. Sukumvanich S. Biochem. J.. 2006; 393: 575-582Google Scholar), and direct redox modifications of isolated IP3R channels have been described (28Kaplin A.I. Ferris C.D. Voglmaier S.M. Snyder S.H. J. Biol. Chem.. 1994; 269: 28972-28978Google Scholar). Accordingly, the Ca2+ signals elicited by insulin, which require NADPH oxidase and IP3 receptor activation, may also be involved in regulation of gene expression. Further studies are needed to elucidate this point. We have previously shown that electrical activity stimulates ROS production by NADPH oxidase in skeletal muscle cells and prompts the emergence of Ca2+ signals due to ROS-stimulated ryanodine receptors (1Espinosa A. Leiva A. Pena M. Muller M. Debandi A. Hidalgo C. Carrasco M.A. Jaimovich E. J. Cell. Physiol.. 2006; 209: 379-388Google Scholar). Additionally, NADPH oxidase-generated ROS stimulate ryanodine receptor-mediated Ca2+ release from triad-enriched vesicles isolated from adult skeletal muscle cells (4Hidalgo C. Sanchez G. Barrientos G. Aracena-Parks P. J. Biol. Chem.. 2006; 281: 26473-26482Google Scholar). As electrical activity is a constant feature of functional muscle, insulin and electrical activity may jointly stimulate ROS generation, which by enhancing Ca2+ release mediated by ryanodine or IP3 receptors, as shown in this work, generates Ca2+ signals that regulate muscle contraction or gene expression. In summary, we propose the following mechanism for insulin-dependent ROS production and delayed Ca2+signal generation (Fig. 7). Insulin binding to its receptor promotes phosphorylation of its β subunit in tyrosine residues and recruits IRS-1; PI3K activation resulting from its binding to IRS-1 produces inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, which stimulates phospholipase C γ to produce IP3 and DAG. The increased DAG production at the plasma membrane activates PKCδ, and this enzyme phosphorylates p47phox, allowing this subunit to migrate to the membrane to form the activated NADPH oxidase complex; the resulting ROS modify IP3 receptors and facilitate IP3-induced Ca2+ release, producing the delayed Ca2+ signals induced by insulin (Fig. 7). Although insulin-enhanced Ca2+ release can certainly generate Ca2+ signals of physiological relevance on their own, insulin-derived H2O2 generation can also play an important role in muscle function. In fact, H2O2 as a messenger has been linked to the regulation of various redox-sensitive proteins, among them the ryanodine receptors (3Hidalgo C. Donoso P. Antioxid. Redox Signal.. 2008; 10: 1275-1312Google Scholar, 29Feng W. Liu G. Allen P.D. Pessah I.N. J. Biol. Chem.. 2000; 275: 35902-35907Google Scholar). Our results propose a new aspect of insulin-initiated signal transduction in skeletal muscle cells. We postulate an unexplored relationship between H2O2 production by insulin-stimulated NADPH oxidase and Ca2+ release mediated by IP3 receptors, which may underlie insulin-dependent regulation of gene expression in muscle cells."

The tumor suppressor p53 is thought to preferentially regulate the balance between cell survival and death. The interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF-5), known to be involved in the innate immune response to pathogens, is also a critical regulator of DNA damage-induced apoptosis. Here, we provide direct evidence that IRF-5 promotes apoptosis upon signaling through tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) death receptors (DR). We report that IRF-5 sensitizes tumor cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis and cell death that is further enhanced by type I interferons. Cells deficient of IRF-5 gave a significantly diminished response to these agents. IRF-5 is involved in DR signaling upstream of caspase 8, in part because of an IRF-5-dependent increase in caspase 8 activation. We provide evidence that TRAIL induces a signaling cascade that leads to the phosphorylation and nuclear localization of IRF-5, resulting in transactivation of key DR signaling components. The results presented here identify IRF-5 as a new mediator of DR signaling and provides molecular insight into the mechanism of TRAIL-induced IRF-5 signaling.

The DR Apo2 ligand or tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (Apo2L/TRAIL) is a type II membrane-bound molecule of the TNF family. Members of this family share diverse biological effects: induction of apoptosis and/or promotion of cell survival. Interest in TRAIL has grown tremendously after evidence emerged that it induces apoptosis in malignant while sparing normal cells. TRAIL stimulation is characterized by interaction with death domain-containing receptors following adaptor recruitment and caspase activation. TRAIL triggers apoptosis by binding to receptors DR4 and/or DR5, which engage the cell extrinsic pathway (1Kelley S.K. Ashkenazi A. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol... 2004; 4: 333-339Google Scholar). The receptors then recruit and activate apoptosis-initiating proteases caspase 8 and 10 through the death domain-containing adaptor molecule Fas-associated death domain (FADD), leading to formation of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC). Caspase 8 and 10 activate downstream caspases 3, 6, and 7, which execute the apoptotic demise of the cell. In some cells, TRAIL-induced activation of caspase 3 is further augmented through engagement of the intrinsic pathway. In this case, caspase 8/10 cleaves and activates the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bid, which then interacts with two other family members, Bax and Bak. tBid translocates to the mitochondria leading to the release of cytochrome c and Smac/Diablo to the cytosol. Cytochrome c, together with Apaf-1, activates the initiator protease caspase 9, which contributes to activation of caspases 3, 6, and 7. Regulation of the TRAIL-induced apoptotic signaling pathway is not well understood. Numerous genes and signaling pathways are thought to be involved in its regulation (2Horak P. Pils D. Haller G.

The DR4 promoter has several AP-1-binding sites, and DR5 has two Sp1 sites that can be activated by chemotherapeutic agents (7Yoshida T. Maeda A. Tani N. Sakai T. FEBS Lett... 2001; 507: 381-385Google Scholar). The presence of distinct binding sites in these promoter regions suggests that expression may be differentially regulated. The family of interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) has been implicated as critical transcription factors that sense a variety of environmental stresses (8Sato M. Taniguchi T. Tanaka N. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev... 2001; 12: 133-142Google Scholar). IRFs mediate their biological activity by binding to promoters of target genes. They have been extensively studied for their role in host immune response to pathogens; less is known of their role in cell growth regulation. IRF-1 and -5 possess tumor suppressor activity (9Barnes B.J. Kellum M.J. Pinder K.E. Frisancho J.A. Pitha P.M. Cancer Res... 2003; 63: 6424-6431Google Scholar, 10Mori T. Anazawa Y. Iiizumi M.

Type I and II IFNs are capable of sensitizing tumor cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis (6Shigeno M. Nakao K. Ichikawa T. Suzuki K. Kawakami A. Abiru S. Mitazoe S. Nakagawa Y. Ishikawa H. Hamasaki K.

Although the molecular mechanism(s) of action is not fully understood, data indicate that IRF-1 and -3 may play important roles by regulating TRAIL expression (13Clarke N. Jimenez-Lara A.M. Voltz E. Gronemeyer H. EMBO J.. 2004; 23: 3051-3060Google Scholar, 14Kirshner J.R. Karpova A.Y. Kops M. Howley P.M. J. Virol... 2005; 79: 9320-9324Google Scholar). More recent data suggest a role for IRF-1 in the nuclear colocalization of caspase 8 and FADD (15Stang M.T. Armstrong M.J. Watson G.A. Sung K.Y. Liu Y. Ren B. Yim J.H. Oncogene.. 2007; 44: 6420-6430Google Scholar). Much less is known of IRF-5 apoptotic signaling pathways. Data from our laboratory and others indicate that IRF-5 is critical for the induction of apoptosis in response to DNA damage (9Barnes B.J. Kellum M.J. Pinder K.E. Frisancho J.A. Pitha P.M.

Oncogene.. 2002; 21: 2914-2918Google Scholar); later data revealed that IRF-5 acts on a pathway that is distinct from p53 (9Barnes B.J. Kellum M.J. Pinder K.E. Frisancho J.A. Pitha P.M.

Taniguchi T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2007; 104: 3402-3407Google Scholar). Data from microarray analyses indicate that components of the DR signaling pathway are regulated by IRF-5 (9Barnes B.J. Kellum M.J. Pinder K.E. Frisancho J.A. Pitha P.M. Cancer Res... 2003; 63: 6424-6431Google Scholar, 16Hu G. Mancl M.E. Barnes B.J. Cancer Res... 2005; 65: 7403-7412Google Scholar, 18Barnes B.J. Richards J. Mancl M. Hanash S. Beretta L. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem... 2004; 279: 45194-45207Google Scholar). In the present study, we investigated the contribution of IRF-5 to TRAIL-mediated DR signaling. We demonstrate that IRF-5 overexpression sensitizes tumor cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis; signaling was diminished in cells lacking IRF-5. The involvement of IRF-5 in DR signaling occurs upstream of caspase 8 activation. We also provide evidence that TRAIL induces a signaling cascade that leads to the phosphorylation and activation of IRF-5, resulting in transactivation of DR signaling machinery. The results indicate that IRF-5 is a previously unidentified mediator of DR signaling and provides a mechanistic insight into IRF-5-mediated apoptosis by TRAIL. Cells, Reagents, and Treatments—HCT116 isogenic cell lines and gfp-IRF5 stable expressing cells were described (9Barnes B.J. Kellum M.J. Pinder K.E. Frisancho J.A. Pitha P.M.

The caspase 8 promoter reporter (pC8–1588) was from Dr. Abelardo Lopez-Rivas; the TRAIL promoter (Apo1056) was from Dr. Alex Almasan; the DR5 promoter (pDR5/SacI) was from Dr. Toshiyuki Sakai; the FLIP promoter was from Dr. Wafik El-Diery; and the HA-tagged murine IRF-5 was from Dr. Taniguchi. Human IFNβ was purchased from PBL Biomedical Laboratories (Piscataway, NJ); human TRAIL was from Axxora, LLC (San Diego, CA); and mouse TRAIL was from Biomol International, LP (Plymouth Meeting, PA). The cells were treated with 1000 units/ml of IFNβ at 37 °C for 24 h, 10 ng/ml human recombinant TRAIL unless otherwise indicated for 3 h. The cells were incubated with 2 μm MG132 (Calbiochem) for 16 h. FACS Analysis—Analysis of apoptosis and cell death was carried out as described (9Barnes B.J. Kellum M.J. Pinder K.E. Frisancho J.A. Pitha P.M. Cancer Res... 2003; 63: 6424-6431Google Scholar, 16Hu G. Mancl M.E. Barnes B.J. Cancer Res... 2005; 65: 7403-7412Google Scholar). The cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of TRAIL for 12–24 h unless otherwise stated. Cell viability was determined by propidium iodide (PI; BD Pharmingen, Lexington, KY) staining of trypsin-harvested cells and FACS (Becton Dickinson, Palo Alto, CA). The average percentage of positive cells (means ± S.E.) was calculated from three independent experiments. Apoptosis was quantified by single annexin V fluorescein isothiocyanate-PI or annexin V-phycoerythrin (PE) staining (BD Pharmingen). Caspase 8 Activity—The cells were left untransfected or transfected with IRF-5 siRNA for 24 h and treated with 20 ng/ml TRAIL for 4 h. Caspase 8 activity was determined in cell lysates using the Caspase 8 Colorimetric activity assay kit (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Immunoprecipitations (IP) and Immunoblot (IB) Analysis—Cell lysates for IP and IB analysis were prepared as described (16Hu G. Mancl M.E. Barnes B.J. Cancer Res... 2005; 65: 7403-7412Google Scholar) with the addition of halt phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Pierce). For IP, 300 μg of extracts were incubated with either (1:50) Thr(P) (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), Ser(P) (Zymed Laboratories Inc., Inc.), Tyr(P) (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), IRF-5 antibodies (Abcam, Cambridge, MA), or IgG controls as previously described (16Hu G. Mancl M.E. Barnes B.J. Cancer Res... 2005; 65: 7403-7412Google Scholar). The proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted. For direct IB, 60-mm dishes were transfected with 2 μg of expression vector encoding Myc-IRF5 or empty Myc pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). After 48 h, the cells were harvested, and whole cell lysates were resolved. Antibodies against IRF-5, cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, cleaved caspase 3, caspase 6, caspase 7, caspase 8, caspase 9, FADD, phospho-FADD (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), I-FLICE/FLIP, cytochrome c, tBid (R&D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN), c-Myc, DR5, actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and HA (Roche Applied Science) were used. Immunoreactive protein complexes were visualized with ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were stripped and reprobed using Restore Western blot stripping buffer (Pierce). RNA Interference—IRF-5 gene silencing experiments were performed as described (16Hu G. Mancl M.E. Barnes B.J. Cancer Res... 2005; 65: 7403-7412Google Scholar) with Lipofectamine 2000 or Oligofectamine transfection reagent (Invitrogen). 21 h post-transfection, the cells were treated with TRAIL for an additional 3 h and then harvested. The effect of IRF-5 siRNA, shRNA, empty vector shRNA, or nontargeting control siRNAs (Dharmacon, Inc., Lafayette, CO) was analyzed by IB or microarray. IRF-5 siRNA was previously described (16Hu G. Mancl M.E. Barnes B.J. Cancer Res... 2005; 65: 7403-7412Google Scholar); IRF-5 shRNA was from Ambion (catalog number 16708) and cloned to pRNATin-H1.2 from GenScript Corp. Subcellular Fractionation—The cells were homogenized in isotonic mitochondrial buffer (210 mm sucrose, 70 mm mannitol, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and protease inhibitors and centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min to discard nuclei and unbroken cells. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min to pellet mitochondria-enriched heavy membrane fraction, and the supernatant was centrifuged further at 100,000 × g for 30 min to obtain cytosolic (S-100) fraction. The protein extracts were analyzed by IB. Microarray Analysis—p53–/– cells were treated with 20 ng/ml TRAIL and 1000 units/ml IFNβ for 3 h after transfection of IRF-5 or control nontargeting siRNAs. Total RNA (5 μg) was isolated, and probes were generated as described (9Barnes B.J. Kellum M.J. Pinder K.E. Frisancho J.A. Pitha P.M. Cancer Res... 2003; 63: 6424-6431Google Scholar). Comparison of gene expression was made in treated, transfected cells using the GEArray Q Series human apoptosis gene array (SuperArray Inc., Bethesda, MD) that contains 112 genes involved in apoptosis (16Hu G. Mancl M.E. Barnes B.J. Cancer Res... 2005; 65: 7403-7412Google Scholar). The level of gene expression was determined by statistical analysis using the GEArray Expression Analysis Suite (SuperArray Inc., Bethesda, MD). Three independent experiments were performed. To assess differences in gene expression, we selected genes that had a greater than 2.5-fold change and a p value of 0.001. The p values were calculated by using the two-sample t test on log-transformed data. Subcellular Localization and Extraction—gfp-IRF5-expressing cells were grown on coverslips and treated with TRAIL for the indicated time period. The cells were fixed, mounted, and stained with 4′,6′-diamino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA), and the images were obtained on a Zeiss Axiovision 200 microscope equipped with ApoTome. The normalized nuclear fluorescence intensities (nuclear gfp/4′,6′-diamino-2-phenylindole) were plotted with time. Cytosolic and nuclear extracts were purified and analyzed as described (21Barnes B.J. Moore P.A. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem... 2001; 276: 23382-23390Google Scholar). Dual Luciferase Assay—The cells were transiently transfected in 6-well plates using FuGENE 6. Dual luciferase assays were carried out and normalized to internal pRL and protein as described (22Schoenemeyer A. Barnes B.J. Mancl M.E. Latz E. Goutagny N. Pitha P.M. Fitzgerald K.A. Golenbock D.T. J. Biol. Chem... 2005; 280: 17005-17012Google Scholar). The experiments were repeated at least three times in duplicate. In Vivo ChIP Assay—The ChIP assay was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Upstate, Lake Placid, NY) (23Barnes B.J. Kellum M.J. Field A.E. Pitha P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol... 2002; 22: 5721-5740Google Scholar). The samples were immunoprecipitated with 2 μg of NF-κB p65 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or IRF-5 antibodies for 16 h at 4 °C. RT-PCR was performed using the following promoter primer sets (Invitrogen): DR5 ISRE, 5′-ACACCACCGTTCACCAATCT-3′ and 5′-TGAGGTTCAGAGTCCGCTTT-3′; DR5 NF-κB, 5′-ACCCTTGTGCTCGTTGTC-3′ and 5′-TTCACGCAGCTTACTCGG-3′; TRAIL ISRE1, 5′-ATAGAAGGCAAGGGCAGGAA-3′ and 5′-TGGCAGTGGACTTAGGAACC-3′; TRAIL ISRE2, 5′-CAGATAAGGGGTGCATGGAT-3′ and 5′-CCCCACCCACATCTATTGAA-3′; and Caspase 8 ISRE, 5′-CACAGTGCCAGGAAGTGAGA-3′ and 5′-CCAGCTCAGACACAAGGTGA-3′.2 μl of input DNA or 4 μl of ChIP DNA was used for PCR. Optimal PCR cycling conditions for each promoter was as follows: one cycle at 94 °C (4 min); 35 cycles at 94 °C (1 min), 58.5 °C (1 min), and 72 °C (1 min); and one cycle at 72 °C (5 min). The amplified promoter regions are shown in supplemental Fig. S1. RNA Analysis—RNA extraction and RT-PCR analysis were performed as described (9Barnes B.J. Kellum M.J. Pinder K.E. Frisancho J.A. Pitha P.M. Cancer Res... 2003; 63: 6424-6431Google Scholar, 16Hu G. Mancl M.E. Barnes B.J. Cancer Res... 2005; 65: 7403-7412Google Scholar). Quantitative real time RT-PCR analysis was performed using the 7300 Real Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and Power SYBRGreen (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The cells were transfected with empty vector or FLAG/Myc-tagged IRF-5 for 36 h, and RNA was isolated using the Qiagen RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). The data were normalized by the level of actin expression in each sample. The following oligonucleotide primers were used: actin, 5′-ATAGCACAGCCTGGATAGCAACGTAC-3′ and 5′-CACCTTCTACAATGAGCTGCGTGTG-3′; DR5, 5′-AAGACCCTTGTGCTCGTTGT-3′ and 5′-AGGTGGACACAATCCCTCTG-3′ (24Van Valen F.

Stilgenbauer S. Lichter P. Blood.. 2002; 99: 4554-4561Google Scholar). IRF-5 Sensitizes Tumor Cells to TRAIL—To investigate whether IRF-5 plays a role in DR signaling, we compared the sensitivity of HCT116 isogenic cells expressing ectopic gfp-IRF5 to TRAIL. p53+/+ and p53–/– cells were equally sensitive; overexpression gave a significant increase in the percent of cells undergoing apoptosis (Fig. 1a). Similar findings were made in BJAB, Jurkat, and A549 tumor cell lines generated to overexpress IRF-5 (supplemental Fig. S2). To determine the mechanism of IRF-5-induced sensitivity to TRAIL, we first examined activation of caspase 8. TRAIL-treated cells resulted in significant caspase 8 cleavage (Fig. 1b, first lane). Overexpression of Myc-tagged IRF-5 gave a >2-fold increase in caspase 8 activation, as determined by densitometric analysis and normalization with actin levels (Fig. 1b, second lane). The effect of silencing IRF-5 expression on TRAIL-induced caspase 8 activation was next investigated. Efficient silencing of endogenous IRF-5 was established using either 25 nm targeted siRNAs (siRNA1) or 100 ng of IRF-5 shRNA (Fig. 1c). At these concentrations, IRF-5 siRNA/shRNA was specific for IRF-5 alone; type I IFN levels were unchanged, as well as other IRFs or interferon-stimulated genes, as previously reported (16Hu G. Mancl M.E. Barnes B.J. Cancer Res... 2005; 65: 7403-7412Google Scholar). It is important to note that at higher concentrations of IRF-5 siRNA (100 nm) or shRNA (500 ng), IRF-5 expression was not repressed (Fig. 1c), and interferon-stimulated genes (20 and 54) were up-regulated, indicating induction of the IFN signaling pathway (data not shown). The results in Fig. 1c show >95% knockdown of IRF-5 proteins by siRNA or shRNA. Similar to untransfected cells, treatment of nontargeting siRNA or empty vector shRNA control cells with TRAIL augmented IRF-5 expression and caspase 8 cleavage. Transfection of either IRF-5 siRNA or shRNA decreased endogenous IRF-5 levels as well as inhibited TRAIL-induced caspase 8 cleavage. Because IRF-5 siRNA or shRNA gave similar results, we next examined the effect of IRF-5 siRNA on caspase 8 enzymatic activity. Similar to immunoblot data, silencing of endogenous IRF-5 gave ∼70% decrease in TRAIL-induced caspase 8 activity (Fig. 1d). Silencing of IRF-5 Desensitizes Tumor Cells to TRAIL—To further assess the effect of IRF-5 siRNA on TRAIL-mediated signaling, we measured apoptosis by annexin V-PE staining. p53–/– or stable expressing gfp-IRF5/p53–/– cells were left untransfected or transfected with siRNAs for 24 h and treated with TRAIL. The percent of PE-positive cells was determined by FACS (Fig. 2a). In accordance with data shown in Fig. 1a, gfp-IRF5/p53–/– cells were significantly more sensitive to TRAIL than parental. Knockdown of IRF-5 resulted in a dramatic decrease in TRAIL-induced apoptosis. We next investigated the effect of siRNAs on cell viability by PI staining after treatment with TRAIL or a combination of TRAIL plus IFNβ. We previously reported that IFNβ up-regulates IRF-5 expression and enhances sensitivity of p53+/+ and p53–/– tumor cells to DNA damage-induced apoptosis and cell death (16Hu G. Mancl M.E. Barnes B.J. Cancer Res... 2005; 65: 7403-7412Google Scholar). The percentage of cells undergoing cell death was quantitated by FACS (Fig. 2b). siRNA alone had no effect on cell death. Treatment with TRAIL gave >60% of cells stained positive for PI, whereas treatment with IFNβ augmented the sensitivity (>90%). Treatment of IFNβ alone gave ∼15% cell death (data not shown). Knockdown of IRF-5 substantially decreased cell sensitivity to TRAIL and the combination. These data indicate that IRF-5 is a critical transducer of TRAIL-induced apoptosis and cell death and contributes to the observed combinatorial effects of IFNβ and TRAIL. IRF-5 Mediates Extrinsic and Intrinsic Apoptotic DR Signaling—To gain further insight into the molecular mechanism underlying IRF-5-mediated sensitization to TRAIL, we first examined IRF-5 transcriptional regulation by TRAIL. The results in Fig. 3a show a dose-response increase in IRF-5 transcripts that was independent of p53. Next, we examined expression of DR signaling components by immunoblot. The data indicate that the extrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway is fully engaged in p53–/– cells treated with TRAIL (Fig. 3b, first and fourth lanes). IRF-5 protein levels were also up-regulated by TRAIL. Upon silencing IRF-5, TRAIL-induced cleavage of caspase 3, 7, 8, and 9 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase were significantly reduced, suggesting that IRF-5 is acting upstream of these events (Fig. 3b, first and second lanes). No significant change in caspase 6 cleavage was observed. Analysis of further upstream components, DR5, FADD, and the cellular FLICE-like inhibitory protein (cFLIP), revealed that IRF-5 may be acting on multiple levels leading to the observed sensitization. Knockdown of IRF-5 led to a decrease in FADD and phospho-FADD levels, along with a substantial decrease in DR5 expression. FLIP levels were up-regulated. The effect of IRF-5 siRNA on the translocation of intrinsic mitochondrial cofactors was examined. TRAIL treatment led to the cleavage of Bid to tBid and translocation of tBid to the mitochondria with concomitant release of cytochrome c to the cytosol (Fig. 3c). Knockdown of endogenous IRF-5 decreased tBid translocation and release of cytochrome c. A corresponding decrease in Bak, but not Bax, levels was observed in whole cell lysates (Fig. 3b). tBid translocation and cytochrome c release are triggered in cooperation with Bax or Bak. IRF-5 Mediates TRAIL/IFNβ Cytotoxic Effects—In the past 3 years, new light has been shed on the relationship between apoptosis and IFN signaling pathways. Although some studies have posited that cross-talk is p53-dependent (27Takaoka A. Hayakawa S. Yanai H. Stoiber D. Negishi H. Kikuchi H. Sasaki S. Imai K. Shibue T. Honda K. Taniguchi T. Nature.. 2003; 424: 516-523Google Scholar), many investigators have concluded that other pathways link the type I IFNs to apoptosis. The mediator(s) responsible for cross-talk and the mechanism(s) for integration of these two pathways remains to be determined. Here, we examined IRF-5-dependent gene expression by focused microarray in p53–/– cells treated with the combination TRAIL plus IFNβ. Gene expression was profiled using the Oligo GEArray® human apoptotis microarray (SABiosciences, Frederick, MD) that contains 112 genes involved in apoptosis, including TNF ligands and their receptors, Bcl-2 family members, caspases, death domain genes, death effector family members, and genes involved in the p53 and DNA damage response pathway. A detailed list of the genes analyzed can be found on line. The cells were transfected with nontargeting or IRF-5 siRNAs. Data from three independent experiments was used for subtraction analyses and background normalizations to identify IRF-5 target genes (see “Experimental Procedures”). The pattern of expression was remarkably similar between the three independent analyses with a p value of 0.001. Table 1 summarizes the list of genes in which expression was dramatically reduced by a loss of endogenous IRF-5 signaling. Genes showing a ≥2.5-fold alteration in expression levels included death domain family members (MYD88 and RIPK1), p53 and ATM pathway (GADD45 and CHEK2), CARD family (RIPK2, NOL3, and BCL10), TNF receptor family (TNFRSF14, TNFRSF1A, TNFRSF7, TNFRSF8, and TNFRSF9), the TNF ligand TNFSF8, TRAF family (TRAF2, TRAF3, TRAF6, and TRIP), and caspases (Caspases 3, 7, and 8). Fewer genes gave ≥4.5-fold alteration in gene expression. Most notable was the reduction in TNFRSF10B (DR5) expression in the absence of IRF-5; expression of TNF, Fas, and TRAIL ligands were also dramatically reduced. The data indicate a critical role for IRF-5 signaling in TRAIL- and IFNβ-induced cytotoxic effects.TABLE 1IRF-5 target genes induced by Apo2L/TRAIL and IFNβ≥2.5-fold≥4.5-foldMYD88TNFβ/LTAGADD45CARD4 (NOD1)CHEK2RIPK1RIPK2TANKBCL10TNFNOL3 (Nop30)TNFRSF10B (DR5)TNFRSF14FASTNFRSF1ATNFRSF1BTNFRSF7 (CD27)Caspase 13TNFRSF8 (CD30)TRAILTNFRSF9TNFSF8 (CD30L)TRAF2TRAF3TRAF6TRIPCaspase 3Caspase 7Caspase 8 Open table in a new tab TRAIL Induces IRF-5 Phosphorylation and Nuclear Translocation—TRAIL up-regulates IRF-5 gene transcription and protein levels independent of p53 (Fig. 3).

https://openalex.org/W2085204102,"The transcriptional activity of Runx2 is determined by associations with co-repressors including histone deacetylase 7 (HDAC7). We previously found that bone morphogenic protein 2 (BMP2) induces export of HDAC7 from the nucleus. In this study we demonstrate that BMP2 specifically stimulates redistribution of HDAC7 but not HDAC 4, 5, or 6. HDAC7 subcellular redistribution in mesenchymal cells requires Crm1-mediated nuclear export, is associated with increased HDAC7 serine phosphorylation, and requires conserved serines in the HDAC7 amino terminus. The protein kinase D (PKD) inhibitor Gö6976 blocked both basal and BMP2-directed HDAC7 nuclear export. Protein kinase D1 (PKD1) associated with HDAC7 in a BMP2-enhanced manner, and a constitutively active form of PKD1 stimulated HDAC7 nuclear export. Furthermore, active PKD1 inhibited repression of Runx2-mediated transcription by HDAC7. Suppression of HDAC7 was not sufficient to rescue BMP2 induction of osteoblast marker genes in Gö6976-treated cells, indicating that PKD-dependent factors beyond attenuation of HDAC7-repressive activity are required for osteoblast differentiation. These results establish a novel pathway by which BMP signaling regulates Runx2 activity via PKD-dependent inhibition of HDAC7 transcriptional repression.

These secreted proteins promote bone formation and maintenance by binding to receptor complexes and stimulating multiple intracellular pathways. BMP signaling has been implicated in numerous aspects of skeletal development including lineage specification, growth, and differentiation of osteoblasts and chondrocytes as well as limb and mesodermal patterning. They are used clinically to enhance bone healing in cases of nonunion fractures and spinal fusions (3Gautschi O.P. Frey S.P. Zellweger R. ANZ J. Surg.. 2007; 77: 626-631Google Scholar). Their osteoinductive potential is also strikingly demonstrated in cases of fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, a disease characterized by progressive ectopic formation of bone that is caused by aberrant activation of the BMP signaling pathway, most commonly by activating mutations in the BMP receptor complex (4Shore E.M. Xu M. Feldman G.J. Fenstermacher D.A. Cho T.J. Choi I.H. Connor J.M. Delai P. Glaser D.L. LeMerrer M. Morhart R. Rogers J.G. Smith R. Triffitt J.T. Urtizberea J.A. Zasloff M. Brown M.A. Kaplan F.S.

Best known are the SMADs, a group of transcription factors that are phosphorylated by BMP receptor complexes, translocate to the nucleus, and alter gene transcription, frequently in association with other transcription factors. BMP signaling also activates a number of kinase cascades including mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways (7Gallea S. Lallemand F. Atfi A. Rawadi G. Ramez V. Spinella-Jaegle S. Kawai S. Faucheu C.

HDACs repress transcription by catalyzing the removal of acetyl-groups from histones, leading to an inactive chromatin state and reduced transcription, but they also deacetylate non-histone substrates. Class IIa histone deacetylases, HDACs 4, 5, 7, and 9, are composed of a carboxyl-terminal deacetylase catalytic domain and an amino-terminal domain that mediates diverse protein-protein interactions (13Bertos N.R.

Westendorf J.J. J. Bone Miner. Res.. 2008; 23: 361-372Google Scholar). In this report, we show that the redistribution of HDAC7 by BMP2 is mediated by PKD and that this interaction modulates HDAC7 repression of Runx2 activity.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—C2C12 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 200 mm l-glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. MC3T3-E1 cells were cultured in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 1% nonessential amino acids.Plasmids—Plasmids encoding FLAG-tagged HDAC7 (40Jensen E.D. Schroeder T.M. Bailey J. Gopalakrishnan R. Westendorf J.J. J. Bone Miner. Res.. 2008; 23: 361-372Google Scholar) and hemagglutinin-tagged Runx2 (47Zaidi S.K. Javed A. Choi J.Y. van Wijnen A.J. Stein J.L. Lian J.B. Stein G.S. J. Cell Sci.. 2001; 114: 3093-3102Google Scholar) were previously described. Point mutations at HDAC7 serine residues were generated with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and verified by sequencing. Dr. Yoji Shimizu (University of Minnesota) kindly provided the plasmids encoding GFP-tagged PKD1 constructs (48Medeiros R.B. Dickey D.M. Chung H. Quale A.C. Nagarajan L.R. Billadeau D.D. Shimizu Y. Immunity.. 2005; 23: 213-226Google Scholar).Immunofluorescence—Cells were grown on glass coverslips and transfected with Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). In some experiments, cells were pretreated with nuclear export or protein kinase inhibitors for 30 min before being treated with 300 ng/ml BMP2 for the indicated times in the continued presence of the inhibitors. Nuclear export and protein kinase inhibitors were purchased from Calbiochem and used at the following concentrations: leptomycin B, 100 nm; Gö6976, 5 μm; GF109203X, 5 μm; KN93, 5 μm; H-89, 10 μm; LY294002, 10 μm; U0126, 10 μm, SB203580, 3 μm; SP600125, 20 μm. After treatment, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min, blocked for 30 min in immunofluorescence buffer (3% bovine serum albumin, 20 mm MgCl2, 0.3% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline), and incubated with anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, clone M2) in immunofluorescence buffer. Cells were washed three times with 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline, incubated for 30 min with Alexa-conjugated secondary antibodies at 1:800 (Invitrogen), washed 3 times, and mounted in 90% glycerol, 0.4% N-propylgallate. Images were obtained using an Olympus Fluoview 500 confocal microscope and processed using Adobe Photoshop. For quantitation of nuclear-cytoplasmic distributions, the predominant localization of HDAC7-FLAG was scored in 50–75 cells per slide with the investigator blind to the experimental treatment. In experiments where GFP-tagged PKD1 was co-transfected, HDAC7 localization was only scored in cells that were also positive for GFP fluorescence. Statistical significance of HDAC localization and redistribution in cell populations was determined by the χ2 test.Immunoprecipitations—C2C12 cells were grown in 60-mm dishes and transfected with the indicated expression plasmids using Lipofectamine. 24 h after transfection, whole cell lysates were prepared in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40 supplemented with Complete Protease Inhibitor Tablets (Roche Applied Science) and phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Sigma)). Lysates were sonicated, precleared by centrifugation (12,000 rpm at 4 °C), and immunoprecipitated overnight with anti-FLAG-M2-agarose (Sigma) or with anti-HDAC7 polyclonal antibody (Abcam) and collected by protein A/G-plus-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 30 min. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). Proteins were detected by immunoblotting with antibodies against GFP (B2, Santa Cruz), FLAG (M2, Sigma), phosphoserine (PSR45, Sigma), or HDAC7 (Ab12175, Abcam) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Proteins were visualized using ECL-plus chemiluminescent substrate (GE Healthcare).Reporter Assays—C2C12 cells were transfected using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) in 12-well plates with 200 ng of p6OSE2-luc, 100 ng of pRL-null, 300 ng in pCMV5-HA-Runx2, 450 ng of HDAC7, and 100 ng of PKD1 expression plasmids as indicated. pcDNA3.1 was added to maintain a uniform amount of total DNA per transfection. Luciferase activity was measured 24 h after transfection using the Dual-Luciferase Assay System (Promega). Each transfection was performed in triplicate and normalized to Renilla luciferase activity.Osteoblast Differentiation—C2C12 cells stably expressing a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) against HDAC7 or a negative control shRNA were previously described (40Jensen E.D. Schroeder T.M. Bailey J. Gopalakrishnan R. Westendorf J.J. J. Bone Miner. Res.. 2008; 23: 361-372Google Scholar). HDAC7 protein levels in control and HDAC7-suppressed cells were measured by densitometry of immunoblots using NIH ImageJ software and normalized to α-tubulin. Confluent cultures were grown in duplicate in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 300 ng/ml of BMP2 supplemented with DMSO (vehicle) or 2.5 μm Gö6976 for 3 days. Alkaline phosphatase activity was measured by incubating cell lysates in 0.6 m 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol, 2.4 mm MgCl2, 9.6 mm p-nitrophenylphosphate at 37 °C for 30 min. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 2 n NaOH. The activity was determined as absorbance at 410 nm and normalized to protein content. RNA was harvested using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's directions and analyzed by real-time reverse transcription-PCR. Gene expression was normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and analyzed by the Pfaffl method (49Pfaffl M.W. Nucleic Acids Res.. 2001; 29: e45Google Scholar).RESULTSBMP2 Induces Nuclear Export of HDAC7, but Not HDAC4, -5, or -6 in Osteoblast-lineage Cells—We previously reported that BMP2 induces transient redistribution of overexpressed and endogenous HDAC7 from the nucleus to cytoplasm in C2C12 multipotent progenitor cells (40Jensen E.D. Schroeder T.M. Bailey J. Gopalakrishnan R. Westendorf J.J. J. Bone Miner. Res.. 2008; 23: 361-372Google Scholar); however, the mechanism was not characterized at that time. We began by determining whether this also occurs in MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblasts, which are committed to the osteoblast lineage, whereas C2C12 are multipotent and can be induced to differentiate into the myogenic lineage by low serum (50Blau H.M. Pavlath G.K. Hardeman E.C. Chiu C.P. Silberstein L. Webster S.G. Miller S.C. Webster C. Science.. 1985; 230: 758-766Google Scholar) or into the osteogenic lineage by BMP2 (51Katagiri T. Yamaguchi A. Komaki M. Abe E. Takahashi N. Ikeda T. Rosen V. Wozney J.M. Fujisawa-Sehara A. Suda T. J. Cell Biol.. 1994; 127: 1755-1766Google Scholar). When FLAG-tagged HDAC7 is overexpressed in either cell line, it shows a range of subcellular distributions: primarily nuclear, distributed between nucleus and cytoplasm, and primarily cytoplasmic (Fig. 1A). BMP2 stimulated the redistribution of HDAC7 away from the nucleus and toward the cytoplasm in C2C12 (Fig. 1B) and MC3T3-E1 (Fig. 1C) cells. Thus, although HDAC7 was strictly nuclear in 15–20% of cells in untreated populations, it was exclusively nuclear in just 5% of cells after 40 min in BMP2. This effect was transient, with the maximal effect most commonly observed between 40 and 60 min, followed by a return toward basal conditions by 90 min.Nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling of other HDACs including class IIa HDACs 4 and 5 and HDAC6, a class IIb HDAC, has been reported in response to various stimuli (14Verdin E. Dequiedt F. Kasler H.G. Trends Genet.. 2003; 19: 286-293Google Scholar, 15Yang X.J. Gregoire S. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 2005; 25: 2873-2884Google Scholar, 28Westendorf J.J. Zaidi S.K. Cascino J.E. Kahler R. van Wijnen A.J. Lian J.B. Yoshida M. Stein G.S. Li X. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 2002; 22: 7982-7992Google Scholar). We were therefore interested in whether BMP2 influences the localization of these HDACs. Before BMP2 treatment, HDAC7 was distributed between the nucleus and cytoplasm in both C2C12 and MC3T3-E1 cells (Fig. 1, D–E) as described above. In contrast, HDAC5 was observed solely in the nucleus in 100% of C2C12 cells and 77% of MC3T3-E1 cells. Conversely, HDAC6 was confined to the cytoplasm in 97% of C2C12 and 86% of MC3T3-E1 cells. After BMP2 treatment, HDAC7 was redistributed from the nucleus to cytoplasm, whereas no significant change in the distribution of either HDAC5 or HDAC6 was evident. In unstimulated cells, HDAC4 was divided between nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments. Upon BMP2 treatment of MC3T3-E1 cells, the percentage of cells with HDAC4 in the nucleus only or in both the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments was decreased, whereas the percentage with HDAC4 primarily in the cytoplasm increased from 36 to 66% (Fig. 1E). However, we were unable to demonstrate a clear or consistent effect of BMP upon HDAC4 localization in C2C12 cells (Fig. 1D and data not shown). Because HDAC7 showed the strongest and most reproducible redistribution in response to BMP2, we chose to focus our further investigations on it.To determine whether the altered nuclear-cytoplasmic distribution of HDAC7 induced by BMP2 involved nuclear export, we pretreated C2C12 cells with the nuclear export inhibitor leptomycin B (LMB) for 60 min before BMP2 treatment. Pretreatment with LMB enhanced exclusive nuclear localization of HDAC7 before BMP2 treatment from 17 to 76% of cells (Fig. 1F). LMB also reduced the ability of BMP2 to cause redistribution of HDAC7-FLAG. After 40 min of BMP2 stimulation, HDAC7 was expressed exclusively in the cytoplasm in only 3% of LMB-treated cells as compared with 43% of control cells. The ability of LMB to inhibit HDAC7 redistribution from BMP2 suggests that the altered subcellular distribution involves Crm1-dependent nuclear export. Collectively, these data show that BMP2 regulates nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking of HDAC7 to control its distribution in osseous cells.BMP2 Regulates HDAC7 Subcellular Localization through Kinase Signaling—Phosphorylation of serine residues in the HDAC7 amino terminus by protein kinases, including CaMK (16Kao H.Y.

Biol.. 2006; 26: 1569-1577Google Scholar), regulates its nuclear-cytoplasmic distribution in response to extracellular stimuli. We hypothesized BMP2 regulates HDAC7 localization by a similar mechanism and that inhibition of the kinase(s) that transduces the signal from BMP2 to HDAC7 should block BMP2-responsive export of HDAC7. To test this hypothesis and identify the kinase(s) involved, we pretreated C2C12 cells with various kinase inhibitors (Table 1) for 30 min before stimulation with BMP2. The localization of HDAC7 was examined both at the end of the pretreatment and after 45 min of BMP2 treatment. The distributions of HDAC7 in cells treated with PKD, CaMK, protein kinase C (PKC), or JNK inhibitors were significantly different (p ≤ 0.001) from the distribution in vehicle-treated cells, although the PKD and CaMK inhibitors gave the clearest effect. Thus, in the absence of BMP2 (Fig. 2A), KN93, a CaMK inhibitor, and Gö6976, an inhibitor of PKD and calcium-dependent PKC isoforms, each increased the nuclear localization of HDAC7 as compared with DMSO (vehicle) from 19% to 66 and 67%, respectively. By comparison, a broad inhibitor of PKC isoforms (GF109203X) and inhibitors of p38 (SB203580) or JNK (SP600125) produced weaker shifts (from 19% to 37–41%) in HDAC7 distribution toward the nucleus in the absence of exogenous BMP2. Inhibitors of protein kinase A (H-89), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (LY294002), or MEK (U0126) decreased the number of cells in which HDAC7 was only located in the cytoplasm but did not increase the number of cells where HDAC7 was only in the nucleus. Thus, broader distribution across both compartments was increased. These data indicate that PKD and CaMK are regulators of HDAC7 localization.TABLE 1Kinase inhibitors used in this studyInhibitorSpecificityConcentrationKN93CaM kinase II5 μmGö6976PKD, PKCα, PKCβ5 μmGF109203XPKCα, PKCβ, PKCγ, PKCδ, PKCϵ5 μmH89Protein kinase A10 μmLY294002Phosphoinositide 3-kinase10 μmU0126MEK1, MEK210 μmSB203580p383 μmSP600125JNK20 μm Open table in a new tab FIGURE 2Effects of protein kinase inhibitors on BMP2-induced nuclear export of HDAC7.

Similar to Fig. 1, BMP2 induced export of HDAC7 from the nucleus within 45 min when pretreated with DMSO (vehicle) (Fig. 2B). Although several of the inhibitors produced statistically significant changes in HDAC7 distribution, Gö6976 most effectively inhibited BMP2-stimulated redistribution of HDAC7. Thus, although 48% of control cells (Fig. 2B) showed exclusive cytoplasmic staining of HDAC7 after BMP2 treatment (up from 20% in untreated cells, Fig. 2A), only 12% of cells pretreated with Gö6976 before BMP2 exposure had exclusive cytoplasmic staining of HDAC7. Cells pretreated with Gö6976 were the only population with a greater percentage of cells having HDAC7 exclusively nuclear than exclusively cytoplasmic after BMP2 treatment. In cells pretreated with all the other inhibitors, HDAC7 was located in the cytoplasm of 26–42% of cells. The ability of Gö6976, but not GF109203X, to strongly inhibit BMP2-dependent HDAC7 nuclear export suggests that PKD rather than PKC is the kinase involved in transducing the BMP2 signal to HDAC7. These data indicate that CaMK and PKD are both involved in limiting the amount of HDAC7 in the nucleus in the absence of BMP2 stimulation but that only PKD regulates HDAC7 subcellular distribution in the presence of BMP2.HDAC7 Localization and Activity Is Regulated by PKD and Serine Phosphorylation—BMP2 activates PKD in osteoblast-like cells (9Lemonnier J.

Based on this literature and our initial results with BMP2 and Gö6976, we further investigated the role of PKD in transmitting BMP2 signals to HDAC7.

https://openalex.org/W2023779098,"Inositide-specific phospholipase Cbeta1 (PLCbeta1) signaling in cell proliferation has been investigated thoroughly in the G(1) cell cycle phase. However, little is known about its involvement in G(2)/M progression. We used murine erythroleukemia cells to investigate the role of PLCbeta1 in G(2)/M cell cycle progression and screened a number of candidate intermediate players, particularly mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and protein kinase C (PKC), which can, potentially, transduce serum mitogenic stimulus and induce lamin B1 phosphorylation, leading to G(2)/M progression. We report that PLCbeta1 colocalizes and physically interacts with lamin B1. Studies of the effects of inhibitors and selective si-RNA mediated silencing showed a role of JNK, PKCalpha, PKCbetaI, and the beta1 isoform of PI-PLC in cell accumulation in G(2)/M [as observed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS)]. To shed light on the mechanism, we considered that the final signaling target was lamin B1 phosphorylation. When JNK, PKCalpha, or PLCbeta1 were silenced, lamin B1 exhibited a lower extent of phosphorylation, as compared to control. The salient features to emerge from these studies are a common pathway in which JNK is likely to represent a link between mitogenic stimulus and activation of PLCbeta1, and, foremost, the finding that the PLCbeta1-mediated pathway represents a functional nuclear inositide signaling in the G(2)/M transition."

The LOX gene has also been shown to inhibit the transforming activity of Ras oncogene signaling.

Among the LOX family members, the C-terminal ends encode the enzyme domain and are highly conserved, whereas the N-terminal ends that encode the pro-peptide region have variable sequences. Based on structural and sequence similarities of the pro-peptide regions, the LOX family members can be divided into two subgroups: LOXL2, LOXL3, and LOXL4 as one group whose propeptide regions contain four scavenger receptor cysteine-rich domains, and LOX and LOXL1 as a separate group with much simpler and smaller pro-peptide region containing no cysteine residues (reviewed in Ref. 1Lucero H.A.

The ECM has multiple mechanical and signaling functions. The ECM defines interfaces between tissues, provides a scaffold for cell traction, and a substrate for cell migration and adhesion. It is composed of a complex of proteins such as collagens, fibronectin, and laminin, which can interact and bind various growth factors (16Rosso F. Giordano A. Barbarisi M. Barbarisi A. J. Cell. Physiol. 2004; 199: 174-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Fibronectin is of particular interest because it was recently shown to interact with the C terminus of Pro-LOX (17Fogelgren B.

Little is known about the mechanism of action of LOX-PP. Here, we have asked whether the tumor suppressor activity of LOX-PP attenuates the activation of the integrin signaling pathway in breast cancer cells.

Haptotaxis Cell Migration Assay—Cell migration experiments were performed using 8-μm pore Transwell filters (Costar), which were coated on the underside with 50 μg/ml human fibronectin, 50 μg/ml laminin or 5 μg/ml vitronectin (BD Biosciences), for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), airdried, and stored at 4 °C until use. Cells (1 × 105) were suspended, in triplicate, in DMEM supplemented with 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and layered in the upper chamber. For blocking protein synthesis, cells were pretreated with 50 μg/ml cycloheximide (CHX) (Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 min. The cells were washed twice with PBS, trypsinized, and processed as above. The lower compartment contained 500 μl of DMEM supplemented with 0.5% BSA. After the indicated incubation period, the upper surface of the filter was wiped with a cotton-tipped applicator to remove non-migratory cell. Cells that had migrated through the filter pores and attached to the under surface of the filter were fixed and stained in methanol containing 0.5% crystal violet. The dye was extracted by incubation in 1× PBS, 2% SDS for 10 min. Migration was quantified by determining the A570 nm. Results obtained with EV cells were set to 100% and used as reference. Migration of Pro-LOX, LOX, or LOX-PP cells was expressed as a percentage of the control. To determine the effects of addition of rLOX-PP on migration, cells were pretreated for 24 h with purified rLOX-PP at final concentrations of 0, 0.9, and 4.5 μg/ml corresponding to ∼0, 50, or 250 nm, respectively. Subsequently, 1 × 105 cells were suspended in DMEM supplemented with 0.5% BSA and purified rLOX-PP at a final concentration of 0 (control), 50, 250 nm, and layered, in triplicate, into the upper chamber and incubated at 37 °C for 3–5 h, and processed as above. Control cells were set to 100%. Data were generated from a minimum of three independent experiments. For statistical analyses, a Student’s t test was performed. p values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. Integrin Stimulation—Three percent methylcellulose-DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS was prepared as described (23Assoian R.K. Boardman L.A. Drosinos S. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 177: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Briefly, autoclaved methylcellulose (4000 cP viscosity) (Sigma-Aldrich) was dispersed in hot deionized H2O, supplemented with 0.4% NaHCO3, and cooled to room temperature. This solution was mixed with equal volume of 2× DMEM and solubilized overnight at 4 °C. The methylcellulose-DMEM mix was supplemented with 10% FBS and 2 μg/ml doxycycline (Sigma-Aldrich). NF639 stable infectants were treated with 2 μg/ml doxycycline for 48 h to induce transgene expression. Cells were trypsinized and washed in complete medium. Approximately 1.5 × 106 cells per 25 ml of methylcellulose-DMEM were incubated in the presence of doxycycline at 37 °C for 24 h. Subsequently, suspended cells were recovered and seeded at a density of 1.5 × 106 cells per 100-mm dish coated with fibronectin, laminin, or vitronectin (BD Biosciences) for 1.5 h. For CHX treatment studies, cells recovered from methylcellulose-DMEM suspension culture were incubated in serum-free DMEM with or without 50 μg/ml CHX for 30 min. Following incubation, cells were washed twice and seeded in fibronectin-coated 100-mm dishes for 1.5 h, as above. Adherent cells were washed twice with PBS and cellular proteins were extracted by lysing with RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm sodium vanadate, 10 mm sodium fluoride). Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Cultured cells were washed twice with cold 1× PBS, and lysed in ice-cold RIPA buffer (as above) for 30 min on ice followed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min yielding whole cell extracts (WCE). Expression of the V5-tagged LOX-PP in cell culture medium (MED) was detected by immunoprecipitation as described previously (6Min C. Kirsch K.H. Zhao Y. Jeay S. Palamakumbura A.H. Trackman P.C. Sonenshein G.E. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 1105-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates or WCE (20 μg) were subjected to immunoblotting, as described (24Kirsch K.H. Georgescu M.M. Hanafusa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25673-25679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Preparation of Triton X-100-soluble and -insoluble Protein Extracts—Cells, washed twice with 1× PBS, were incubated with 1 ml of CSK buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris-HC1, pH 6.8, 50 mm NaCl, 300 mm sucrose, 3 mm MgCl2) supplemented with phosphatase and protease inhibitors at 4 °C for 15 min. The lysed cells were collected and centrifuged at 13,600 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. The supernatant was defined as the Triton X-100 soluble fraction. The cell pellet was washed once with 200 μl of CSK buffer and extracted with 1 ml of SDS buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA) and boiled for 10 min. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 13,600 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. The supernatant was defined as the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction. For each sample, a 10-μg protein aliquot of soluble fraction and an equal volume (in reference to the concentration of the soluble fraction) of insoluble fraction were separated by SDS-PAGE on an 8% resolving gel. Phase Contrast Microscopy—Culture plates (24-well) (Greiner Labortechnik) were coated with ECM proteins at the following concentrations: 50 μg/ml fibronectin, 50 μg/ml laminin, or 5 μg/ml vitronectin at room temperature for 1 h. Subsequently, the coated wells were washed twice with 1× PBS and used immediately or stored at 4 °C. NF639 or MDA-MB-231 cells were trypsinized, and washed in complete medium. Cells were resuspended in complete medium and seeded at 1 × 105/well for 1.5 h and 3 h. Cells were inspected by using an inverted Axiovert 200 m microscope (Carl Zeiss), and images taken with a CCD ORCA-ER camera (Hamamatsu) attached to the inverted microscope. Immunofluorescence—NF639 or MDA-MB-231 cells (1 × 105) were plated in 12-well plates with or without rLOX-PP (250 nm) for 24 h. Subsequently, the cells were trypsinized, washed once with complete DMEM and once with serum-free DMEM. Cells (1 × 104) were then plated on fibronectin-coated Lab-Tek II chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International) and cultured in DMEM supplemented with 2.5% FBS and with or without rLOX-PP (250 nm) for 24 h. Cells were fixed with 3% formaldehyde/PBS at room temperature for 30 min and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS at room temperature for 2–5 min. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 50 mm glycine/PBS for 10 min. Cells were stained with PY99 antibodies (1:200) in 0.2% gelatin/PBS or rhodamine-labeled phalloidin (1:1000) at room temperature for 1 h. After four washes, cells were incubated with secondary anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 antibodies (1:1000). Samples were inspected by using an Axiovert 200 m microscope (Carl Zeiss) and images taken with an ORCA-ER camera (Hamamatsu). LOX-PP Attenuates Fibronectin-stimulated Tyrosine Phosphorylation of Cellular Proteins—To elucidate the role of LOX-PP in adhesion-mediated cell signaling, we utilized the recently established Her-2/neu-transformed NF639 breast cancer cell populations expressing Pro-LOX, LOX, or LOX-PP or containing control EV DNA driven by a doxycycline-inducible promoter (6Min C. Kirsch K.H. Zhao Y. Jeay S. Palamakumbura A.H. Trackman P.C. Sonenshein G.E. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 1105-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Induction of recombinant peptide expression following doxycycline treatment was confirmed by Western blot analysis of WCE to detect proteins in the intracellular compartment, and of culture media to detect secreted proteins (Fig. 1A). Expression of LOX is restricted to the intracellular compartment, while Pro-LOX and LOX-PP are secreted as has been described previously (6Min C. Kirsch K.H. Zhao Y. Jeay S. Palamakumbura A.H. Trackman P.C. Sonenshein G.E. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 1105-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 25Seve S. Decitre M. Gleyzal C. Farjanel J. Sergeant A. Ricard-Blum S. Sommer P. Connect. Tissue Res. 2002; 43: 613-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Engagement of fibronectin with its integrin receptors results in rapid and robust activation of non-receptor tyrosine kinases. We first tested whether LOX-PP reduces integrin-mediated induction of tyrosine kinase activity. Cell populations were treated with doxycycline for 48 h, and subsequently incubated in semi-solid methylcellulose containing medium (suspension culture) for an additional 24 h, to de-activate integrin signaling (26Howlett A. Methods in Molecular Biology Vol. 129 Integrin Protocols. 1999; (Humana Press, Totowa, NJ)Google Scholar). Cells were recovered from the methylcellulose containing medium and lysed immediately (SUSP) or plated on fibronectin-coated dishes for 1.5 h before cell lysis (FN), as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Western blot analysis with phosphotyrosine-specific antibodies consistently revealed an increase in appearance of a major phosphorylated protein species of ∼120-kDa molecular mass (indicated with an arrowhead) in all lysates of cells plated on fibronectin compared with those in suspension (Fig. 1B, upper panel). This phosphorylated band may represent several proteins involved in integrin signaling including FAK and p130Cas. Attenuated phosphorylation of this band was seen in NF639 Pro-LOX- and LOX-PP-expressing cells compared with NF639 EV cells. Analysis of a total of three independent experiments revealed Pro-LOX and LOX-PP resulted in an approximate 40% reduction (p < 0.0001 and p < 0.001, respectively) in tyrosine phosphorylation when normalized to the β-actin loading control (Fig. 1B, lower panel), consistent with the hypothesis that the pro-peptide region attenuates integrin signaling. In contrast, tyrosine phosphorylation in NF639 LOX cells was comparable to NF639 EV cells. Notably, inhibition of protein synthesis following addition of 50 μg/ml CHX for 30 min failed to prevent the ability of LOX-PP to inhibit adhesion-mediated induction of phosphotyrosine, suggesting newly synthesized proteins are not required (Fig. 1C). As described above, the ECM is composed of a complex of proteins. Thus we compared fibronectin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of NF639 cells with that of stimulation by laminin and vitronectin. Western blot analysis of WCE with phosphotyrosine-specific antibodies revealed an increase in appearance of the major phosphorylated protein species of ∼120-kDa molecular mass when cells were plated on fibronectin for 1.5 h. In contrast, no or only a weak increase in tyrosine phosphorylation was observed for laminin or vitronectin stimulation, respectively, compared with those in suspension (Fig. 1D, upper panel). These differences correlate with the ability of NF639 cells to spread/adhere on these three adhesive proteins. While cell adhesion/spreading over a period of 1.5 h was superior on fibronectin-coated surfaces, it was less pronounced on vitronectin and completely absent on laminin (Fig. 1D, lower panel). These data suggest that fibronectin plays a major role in integrin activation of NF639 cells. LOX-PP Attenuates Fibronectin-stimulated Activation of FAK—As noted, the phosphorylated band affected by LOX-PP and Pro-LOX may represent one of several proteins involved in integrin signaling, including FAK or p130Cas. FAK, can be phosphorylated at several functional tyrosine sites: Tyr-397, autophosphorylation and c-Src-binding site; Tyr-576, activation tyrosine; Tyr-925, Grb2 binding site. Thus, we addressed whether the decrease in tyrosine phosphorylation mediated by Pro-LOX and LOX-PP is due to reduced activation of FAK. Cells were again induced with doxycycline, suspended in methylcellulose, and then plated on fibronectin as above. Western blot analysis of WCE was performed using antibodies that specifically recognize these phosphorylated tyrosines on FAK. Phosphorylation of FAK on its auto-phosphorylation site Tyr-397 upon adhesion to fibronectin was significantly reduced by Pro-LOX that contains the LOX-PP domain, and by LOX-PP itself (Fig. 2A, upper panel). When the data from this and two duplicate experiments were scanned and normalized to the β-actin loading control, a ∼50% reduction of phosphorylation was seen in cells expressing Pro-LOX and LOX-PP (p < 0.0001 and p < 0.001, respectively) (Fig. 2A, bottom panel). Similarly, integrin engagement to fibronectin induced phosphorylation of the activation tyrosine Tyr-576, and LOX-PP substantially reduced this phosphorylation by ∼25% (Fig. 2B, upper panel). In contrast, LOX expression failed to reduce phosphorylation on either site Tyr-397 or Tyr-576. Furthermore, no change in the phosphorylation status of the Tyr-925 Grb2 binding site was detected upon cell attachment to fibronectin coated plates, i.e. the same degree of phosphorylation was noted in all conditions, and was not altered by stimulation with fibronectin or expression of LOX-PP (Fig. 2B, bottom panel). Thus, these data suggest that LOX-PP interferes with stimulation of FAK signaling by fibronectin, in particular selectively attenuating phosphorylation of two tyrosine residues: Tyr-397 and Tyr-576. LOX-PP Attenuates Fibronectin-stimulated p130Cas Activation—Recruitment and phosphorylation of the tyrosine phosphorylated adapter-type protein p130Cas is a critical step in FAK-mediated migration and invasion. To determine whether LOX-PP expression affects the activation status of p130Cas, extracts of fibronectin-stimulated NF639 control EV cells or of cells expressing Pro-LOX, LOX, or LOX-PP were subjected to Western blot analysis for their effects on levels of phosphorylated, activated p130Cas protein (Fig. 3A, upper panel). Tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas was significantly reduced in fibronectin-stimulated Pro-LOX- and LOX-PP-expressing NF639 cells compared with the control cells, whereas LOX failed to reduce phospho-p130Cas levels (Fig. 3A, lower panel). Phosphorylated p130Cas is localized to the cytoskeleton fraction, in particular to focal adhesions. Therefore, to test whether LOX-PP reduces the translocation of p130Cas to focal adhesions, levels of p130Cas in the Triton X-100 insoluble (I) (cytoskeleton/focal adhesions) versus soluble (S) cell fractions were determined. Most of the p130Cas was present in the Triton X-100-soluble fractions (I/S = 0.22) in the control EV NF639 cells (Fig. 3B). A substantially reduced amount (∼50%) of p130Cas was detected in the cytoskeleton fraction of NF639 LOX-PP cells compared with NF639 EV cells (Fig. 3B, lower panel) and as evident by the calculated ratio of I/S = 0.09 (Fig. 3B, upper panel). In contrast, expression of LOX resulted in an approximate 50% increase in translocation of p130Cas to the cytoskeleton fraction (I/S = 0.32) (Fig. 3B, lower panel). Together these data suggest that LOX-PP modifies the activity and translocation of p130Cas. LOX-PP Inhibits Haptotaxis of Murine and Human Breast Cancer Cells—The FAK-Src-p130Cas signaling pathway is crucial for directed cell migration. To examine the effects of LOX-PP in integrin-stimulated haptotaxis, control EV NF639 cells, and cells expressing Pro-LOX, LOX, or LOX-PP were subjected to Boyden chamber migration assays for 2.5 h, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Induction of Pro-LOX and LOX-PP significantly reduced fibronectin-stimulated migration of NF639 cells (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively) (Fig. 4A). In contrast, the LOX enzyme enhanced the migration of NF639 cells, as reported previously (27Payne S.L. Fogelgren B. Hess A.R. Seftor E.A. Wiley E.L. Fong S.F. Csiszar K. Hendrix M.J. Kirschmann D.A.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1685: 3-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 2Ory D.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1529: 331-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Cells displaying the NPC phenotype show accumulation of low density lipoprotein-derived, unesterified cholesterol in the endosomes and lysosomes. NPC disease is also characterized by the subcellular accumulation of other lipids, such as sphingomyelin, sphingosine, and gangliosides (3Zervas M. Somers K.L. Thrall M.A. Walkley S.U. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1283-1287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Over 95% of cases of NPC disease are caused by mutations in the NPC1 gene (4Carstea E.D. Morris J.A. Coleman K.G. Loftus S.K. Zhang D. Cummings C. Gu J. Rosenfeld M.A. Pavan W.J. Krizman D.B. Nagle J. Polymeropoulos M.H. Sturley S.L. Ioannou Y.A. Higgins M.E. Comly M. Cooney A. Brown A. Kaneski C.R.

NPC1 is a large 1278-amino acid integral membrane protein that shares structural features with several proteins involved in cholesterol homeostasis. It is located primarily in the late endosomes, but it also appears to traffic transiently between other regions of the cell via a network of tubular structures and vesicles (6Liscum L. Sturley S.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1685: 22-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 7Higgins M.E. Davies J.P. Chen F.W. Ioannou Y.A. Mol. Genet. Metab. 1999; 68: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The NPC1 protein clearly plays a role in the intracellular trafficking of cholesterol, particularly in the movement of low density lipoprotein-derived cholesterol from the late endosomal and lysosomal compartments to the plasma membrane and trans-Golgi network (8Mukhejee S. Maxfield F.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1685: 28-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The other 5% of NPC patients carry a mutation in the gene encoding NPC2 (9Vanier M.T. Millat G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1685: 14-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 10Naureckiene S. Sleat D.E. Lackland H. Fensom A. Vanier M.T. Wattiaux R. Jadot M. Lobel P. Science. 2000; 290: 2298-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar), a small 132-amino acid, soluble cholesterol-binding protein found in the lumen of the lysosomes (11Liou H.L. Dixit S.S.

Jin Y.Z. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1438: 377-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Despite the fact that the NPC1 and NPC2 proteins are quite different at the molecular level, the phenotypes displayed by NPC patients carrying mutations in the NPC1 and NPC2 genes are virtually indistinguishable. It seems likely that the two proteins are interacting partners in the intracellular cholesterol trafficking pathway.NPC1 is a member of the resistance-nodulation-cell division (RND) permease superfamily, a ubiquitous group of proteins found in all the major kingdoms (14Tseng T.T. Gratwick K.S. Kollman J. Park D. Nies D.H. Goffeau A. Saier Jr., M.H. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1999; 1: 107-125PubMed Google Scholar). Bacterial RND proteins are generally proton symporters involved in coupled efflux from the cell of substrates such as hydrophobic drugs, fatty acids, detergents, and antibiotics. Eukaryotic RND proteins are largely uncharacterized but fall into two major subclasses as follows: proteins that have an internal duplication, and likely function as transporters, and those that do not, and probably act as sterol-modifying enzymes or sterol sensors. Thus, phylogenetic analysis predicts that the NPC1 protein functions as a proton-coupled transporter, possibly an efflux pump for sterols and/or other amphipathic molecules. A very close mammalian relative of NPC1, a protein known as NPC1L1 (Niemann-Pick C1 Like 1; 51% amino acid similarity to NPC1) (15Davies J.P. Levy B. Ioannou Y.A. Genomics. 2000; 65: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), is expressed at the apical surface of intestinal epithelial cells and plays a major role in absorption of cholesterol in the intestine (16Altmann S.W.

A recent study reported that mutant mice lacking either NPC1 or NPC2 do not show any abnormalities in cholesterol absorption or uptake, indicating that the two proteins do not play a role in these processes in mammals (18Dixit S.S. Sleat D.E. Stock A.M. Lobel P. Biochem. J. 2007; 408: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).Investigation of the topology of NPC1 (19Davies J.P. Ioannou Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24367-24374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) has suggested that it has 13 transmembrane (TM) segments, a cytoplasmic C terminus, a large hydrophilic N-terminal domain located in the lumen of the endosomes, and two additional large luminal loops (see Fig. 1A). The membrane domain of NPC1 contains a cluster of five TM helices known as the sterol-sensing domain (SSD) (4Carstea E.D. Morris J.A. Coleman K.G. Loftus S.K. Zhang D. Cummings C. Gu J. Rosenfeld M.A. Pavan W.J. Krizman D.B. Nagle J. Polymeropoulos M.H. Sturley S.L. Ioannou Y.A. Higgins M.E. Comly M. Cooney A. Brown A. Kaneski C.R. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Dwyer N.K. Neufeld E.B.

Metab. 2000; 71: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), which was also identified in several other mammalian proteins involved in cholesterol homeostasis (21Lange Y. Steck T.L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 435-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), including 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase and the sterol regulatory element-binding protein cleavage-activating protein (SCAP).In recent years, the assumed role of NPC1 as a cholesterol transporter or sensor has been challenged, and other lipophilic molecules, including fatty acids and hydrophobic drugs such as acriflavine and daunorubicin, have been proposed as putative substrates (22Ioannou Y.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 498-505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 23Davies J.P. Chen F.W. Ioannou Y.A.

Ther. 2006; 316: 242-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). A role for NPC1 in sphingolipid recycling has also been suggested (25Malathi K. Higaki K. Tinkelenberg A.H. Balderes D.A. Almanzar-Paramio D. Wilcox L.J. Erdeniz N. Redican F. Padamsee M. Liu Y. Khan S. Alcantara F. Carstea E.D. Morris J.A. Sturley S.L. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 547-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), based on the discovery that NCR1, the yeast ortholog of NPC1, is involved in sphingolipid metabolism. However, NPC1 in intact mammalian cells was shown to be labeled by a photoactive cholesterol analog, which was partially inhibited by a 30-fold excess of unlabeled cholesterol (26Ohgami N. Ko D.C. Thomas M. Scott M.P. Chang C.C. Chang T.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 12473-12478Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Labeling required an intact SSD on the protein but was independent of NPC2, suggesting that NPC1 likely interacts directly with cholesterol, as a substrate and/or allosteric effector. More recently, Infante et al. (27Infante R.E. Abi-Mosleh L. Radhakrishnan A. Dale J.D. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 1052-1063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) reported the isolation from rabbit liver of a 25-hydroxycholesterol-binding protein, which analysis showed to be NPC1. Purified recombinant human NPC1 was found to bind various oxysterols, including 24-, 25-, and 27-OH-cholesterol, with high affinity. When a large N-terminal domain (luminal loop-1, residues 25-264) of NPC1 was expressed as a soluble protein, it could also bind cholesterol and oxysterols with high affinity (28Infante R.E. Radhakrishnan A. Abi-Mosleh L. Kinch L.N. Wang M.L. Grishin N.V. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 1064-1075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Clearly, extensive biochemical characterization of purified NCP1 is needed to characterize its sterol binding and transfer functions, as well as its interactions with putative protein partners, such as NPC2.In this study, we report the purification of human NPC1 from mammalian cells overexpressing the protein, in milligram amounts sufficient for biochemical and fluorescence characterization. Purified NPC1 can be cross-linked to a 3H-labeled photoactive cholesterol analog. Two complementary fluorescence approaches have been used to show a close molecular association between purified NPC1 and various fluorescent sterol derivatives, and to quantitate the binding affinity of the protein for these species. Results show that NPC1 binds various sterols with high affinity, in a deep hydrophobic pocket that is shielded from the aqueous medium.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—CHAPS was purchased from Biosynth (Naperville, IL).

HEPES, acrylamide, KI, and CsCl were from Fisher.Cell Culture—NPC1+ is a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line that stably expresses FLAG-tagged human NPC1 in an endogenous NPC1 knock-out background (30Sugimoto Y. Ninomiya H. Ohsaki Y. Higaki K. Davies J.P. Ioannou Y.A. Ohno K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12391-12396Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 31Higaki K. Ninomiya H. Sugimoto Y.

The tag is inserted following Ile-306 in the first cytoplasmic loop of the protein (19Davies J.P. Ioannou Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24367-24374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in Ham's F-12 medium with 10% bovine calf serum and 20 μg/ml blasticidin (both from Invitrogen). α-Minimum Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) was used for large scale cell culture in roller bottles. NPC1+ cells from 30 roller bottles were harvested with trypsin, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (8.1 mm Na2HPO4, 1.3 mm KH2PO4, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 0.9 mm CaCl2, 0.3 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4), and centrifuged to obtain a 20-ml cell pellet.Purification of FLAG-NPC1—NPC+ cells were disrupted using a Yeda press, and a membrane fraction was isolated by sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation using a procedure described previously (32Liu R. Sharom F.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11865-11873Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). To solubilize the membrane fraction, 50 mg of membrane protein was added to 15 ml of 20 mm CHAPS in HEPES buffer (20 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4) and resuspended with a fine needle (26-gauge 5/8), followed by mixing on a nutator for 1 h at 4 °C. The sample was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected and diluted with an equal volume of HEPES buffer to a final CHAPS concentration of 10 mm. 10 ml of CHAPS-solubilized membrane extract was loaded onto a 5-ml anti-FLAG-agarose column equilibrated with 10 mm CHAPS in HEPES buffer, and the column flow was stopped when protein started to appear in the run-through. The agarose gel was gently stirred in place, and the column was sealed and placed on a Nutator for 2 h at 4 °C. The column was then repacked and washed with 2 mm CHAPS in HEPES buffer until the run-through was free of detectable protein (using the Bradford assay). The column was washed with 15 ml of 0.2 mg/ml FLAG peptide in 2 mm CHAPS/HEPES buffer, and the eluate containing NPC1 was pooled and concentrated to a final volume of ∼2 ml using an Amicon ultracentrifugation concentrator (100,000-kDa cutoff). The FLAG peptide was removed from purified NPC1 by gel filtration on a 10-ml pre-packed column of Bio-Gel P6 (Bio-Rad), washing with 2 mm CHAPS/HEPES buffer. The purified FLAG-NPC1 (∼0.35 mg from 50 mg of membrane protein) was divided into aliquots and stored at -80 °C. Protein was assayed by the method of Bradford (33Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213462) Google Scholar).SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—Proteins were separated in a 10% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel by SDS-PAGE according to Laemmli (34Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206048) Google Scholar) and stained with Coomassie Blue. For Western immunoblotting, samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis and electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane, which was then incubated with either anti-NPC1 polyclonal antibody or anti-FLAG antibody. The bound primary antibody was detected using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) in conjunction with the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (Amersham Biosciences), and visualized using a FluorChem IS-8900 imaging system (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA). Kaleidoscope prestained standards were obtained from Bio-Rad.Photoaffinity Labeling of NPC1 with [3H]Azi-cholesterol—Photoaffinity labeling was carried out by a modification of the method of Loe and Sharom (35Loe D.W. Sharom F.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1190: 72-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Briefly, purified NPC1 (1 μg) was incubated at 22 °C in 20 mm HEPES, 0.10 m NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4, with 7-azi-5α-cholestan-3β-ol[3,5,6-3H] (azicholesterol; 2.5 μm, 60 Ci/mmol; American Radiolabeled Chemicals, St. Louis) for 2 h under subdued light. The sample was then irradiated at 365 nm (Stratagene cross-linker) for 10 min at room temperature at a distance of <1 cm, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE on a 10% polyacrylamide gel. The gel was impregnated with 20% diphenyloxazole in DMSO overnight, washed, dried, and exposed at -80 °C to Kodak X-Omat LS film, followed by autoradiography after a 12-week exposure.FPLC Analysis of Purified NPC1—Gel filtration fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) was carried out on a Superose 6/300 GL column (10 × 300 mm; 24-ml bed volume) connected to an AKTA FPLC system (both from Amersham Biosciences). The column was equilibrated with buffer (10 mm HEPES, 5.4 mm KCl, 130 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) containing various concentrations of CHAPS and FC-13. Purified NPC1 (14 μg in 100 μl) was passed through a 0.45 μm filter, injected onto the column, and eluted at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected and quantitated for protein using the Bradford assay (33Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213462) Google Scholar) followed by SDS-PAGE, and immunodot-blotting with anti-NPC1 antibody. The intensities of the dot-blots were analyzed using a FluorChem IS-8900 imaging system. The molecular mass of the NPC1 peaks was determined by interpolation from a standard curve constructed using thyroglobulin (669 kDa), apoferritin (443 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), transferrin (81 kDa), ovalbumin (45 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), and cytochrome c (12.3 kDa).Fluorescence Measurements—Fluorescence spectra were recorded on a PTI Alphascan-2 spectrofluorimeter (Photon Technology International, London, Ontario, Canada) at 22 °C in a 60-μl quartz microcuvette (Hellma, Germany). For measuring the binding of DHE, CTL, and NBD-cholesterol to purified NPC1, 1 μl of sterol stock (in methanol) was added to 59 μl of NPC1 (40 μg/ml; 0.29 μm; protein molecular mass 139 kDa/mol) to a final concentration of 1 μm. The excitation wavelengths for Trp fluorescence and DHE/CTL/NBD-cholesterol fluorescence were set at 290/325/325/470 nm, respectively. Control scans were performed by adding 1 μl of methanol to 59 μl of NPC1, and 1 μl of DHE/CTL/NBD-cholesterol to 59 μl of buffer. Spectra were corrected using the built-in real time correction function of the fluorimeter. For Trp emission spectra, the control scans of buffer with methanol were subtracted from the scans with NPC1 in the absence and presence of substrates. For enhanced fluorescence emission of fluorescent sterols, the control scans of buffer with 1 μm fluorescent sterol were subtracted from the scans with NPC1 in the presence of 1 μm sterol. The slits were set at 2 nm for excitation and 10 nm for emission for all the fluorescence measurements. A cut-off filter at 305 nm was used for Trp emission scans. All experiments were carried out in duplicate.Determination of Micelle or Aggregate Formation—The concentration at which the detergents and sterols formed micelles or aggregates was determined by measuring light scattering, using a modification of the method of Avdulov et al. (36Avdulov N.A. Chochina S.V. Igbavboa U. Warden C.S. Vassiliev A.V. Wood W.G. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1746-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Serial dilutions of each compound were made in HEPES buffer (20 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4), and micelle/aggregate formation was monitored by using excitation and emission at 460 nm, with 2-nm slits. Light scattering data were plotted against the log of the concentration, and the concentration at which micelles/aggregates formed was estimated as the x-intercept of a linear regression line for those concentrations where a rapid rise in scattering was observed. For detergents, this corresponds to the critical micelle concentration (CMC). For sterols, this may represent the concentration at which aggregates form, rather than a true CMC.Kinetics of Binding of Fluorescent Sterols to NPC1—Cholesteryl-BODIPY (0.5 μm) was added to purified NPC1 (0.29 μm) in 2 mm CHAPS, 0.2 mm FC-13 in HEPES buffer. BODIPY fluorescence intensity was monitored over a period of ∼5 h, with excitation and emission wavelengths of 490 and 515 nm, respectively. As a control, 0.5 μm cholesteryl-BODIPY was added to 2 mm CHAPS, 0.2 mm FC-13 in HEPES buffer to show the interaction with detergent micelles. The kinetics of binding of 2 μm NBD-cholesterol to NPC1 was performed in 2 mm CHAPS/HEPES buffer. NBD fluorescence intensity was measured with excitation and emission wavelengths of 470 and 530 nm, respectively. Binding of 2 μm NBD-cholesterol to 15 mm CHAPS detergent micelles was also measured.Quenching of NPC1 Intrinsic Trp Fluorescence—Binding of fluorescent sterols to NPC1 was measured in 2 mm CHAPS/HEPES buffer by adding 1 μl of increasing concentrations of sterol working solutions in methanol to a series of microcentrifuge tubes containing 59 μl of NPC1 (0.29 μm), followed by incubation at 4 °C for ∼3 h (for DHE and CTL) and 30 min for NBD-cholesterol. Control experiments were performed by adding increasing concentrations of fluorescent sterol to 2 mm CHAPS buffer. The steady-state Trp fluorescence was measured with 290 nm excitation and 330 nm emission. The Trp fluorescence intensity of NPC1 was corrected for light scattering and the inner filter effect (37Parker C.A. Photoluminescence of Solutions. 1968; (pp. , Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam): 220-226Google Scholar, 38Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 2006; (3rd ed., pp. , Springer Science+Business Media, New York): 1-19Google Scholar) using Equation 1, Ficor=(Fi/NPC1−Fi/buffer)×100.5(Aλex+Aλem)(Eq. 1) where Ficor is the corrected Trp fluorescence intensity; Fi/NPC1 and Fi/buffer are the experimentally measured fluorescence intensities for either NPC1 samples or buffer controls, and Aλex and Aλem are the absorbance values of the sample at the excitation and emission wavelengths, respectively. Data were fitted to hyperbolic Equation 2 describing binding to a single site, Ficor=F0−(ΔFmax×[S])Kd+[S](Eq. 2) where Ficor is the corrected Trp fluorescence intensity at any given substrate concentration, and F0 is the initial Trp fluorescence of NPC1 in the absence of sterols. SigmaPlot (Systat Software, Chicago) was used to fit the data, and values for the apparent disassociation constant, Kd, and the maximum quenching, ΔFmax, were extracted.The effects of competing compounds on quenching of Trp fluorescence resulting from NBD-cholesterol binding to NPC1 were determined by preincubating NPC1 samples with 20 μm of competitor at 4 °C for 1 h. Then increasing concentrations of NBD-cholesterol were added, followed by incubation at 4 °C for additional 30 min. For control experiments, buffer was used to substitute for purified NPC1 protein. Fluorescence intensities were corrected using Equation 3, ΔFicor={(Fi/NPC1/S−FNPC1)−(Fi/buffer/S−Fbuffer)}×100.5(Aλex+Aλem)(Eq. 3) where Fi/NPC1/S is Trp fluorescence intensity of NPC1 at any given NBD-cholesterol concentration in the presence of 20 μm competitor; Fi/buffer/S is the scattering intensity of NBD-cholesterol in buffer at any given concentration in the presence of 20 μm competitor; FNPC1 is the background scatter for NPC1 in buffer, and Fbuffer is the background scatter for buffer alone. Increasing concentrations of fluorescent sterols were also added to 2 μm NATA in 2 mm CHAPS/HEPES buffer; DHE, CTL, and NBD-cholesterol did not quench the fluorescence of NATA.Enhancement of Sterol Fluorescence on Binding to NPC1—The experimental procedures were the same as for quenching of NPC1 Trp fluorescence. The steady-state fluorescence of DHE/CTL/NBD-cholesterol was measured with 325/325/470 nm excitation and 375/375/520 nm emission.

Although PKD-Ser916 autophosphorylation is widely used to track cellular PKD activity, this study exposes conditions leading to increased PKD-Ser(P)916 immunoreactivity without an associated increase in PKD activity in cardiomyocytes that heterologously overexpress catalytically inactive PKD1 and in cardiomyocytes treated with Gö6976 (a PKD inhibitor that competes with ATP). In each case, PKD1 is detected as a Ser916-phosphorylated enzyme that lacks kinase activity. In vitro kinase assays reconcile these seemingly discrepant findings by demonstrating that PKD1-Ser916 autophosphorylation can proceed via either an intermolecular reaction or an intramolecular autophosphorylation that requires only very low ATP concentrations that do not support target substrate phosphorylation. Additional studies show that Ser744 and Ser748 are targets for a protein kinase C-independent autocatalytic phosphorylation and that the PKD1-S744A/S748A mutant is a Ser916-phosphorylated enzyme that is not active toward heterologous substrates. In contrast, PKD1-S916A is an active kinase that autophosphorylates at Ser744. However, the S916A substitution leads to a Ser748 phosphorylation defect and a prolonged cellular PKD1 signaling response. Collectively, these results implicate PKD1-Ser744 phosphorylation in the phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-dependent mechanism that increases PKD1 activity toward physiologically relevant substrates. We show that PKD1-Ser916 autophosphorylation does not necessarily correlate with PKD1 activity. Rather, autophosphorylation at Ser916 is required for subsequent autophosphorylation at Ser748. Finally, this study exposes a novel role for Ser916 and/or Ser748 autophosphorylation to terminate the cellular PKD1 signaling response."
https://openalex.org/W2110313675,"The follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR) is a G-protein-coupled receptor with a large hormone-specific extracellular domain (amino acids (aa) 1–366) and a characteristic seven-transmembrane domain (TMD; aa 367–695). The extracellular domain is composed of leucine-rich repeats (LRRs; aa 18–259) connected to TMD by a hinge region (HinR; aa 260–366), whose role in the hormone action is not clearly understood. We generated a novel polyclonal HinR antibody that specifically stimulates cAMP production by HEK 293 cells expressing FSHR in a hormone-independent manner. The monovalent antibody retained the stimulatory potential. The segment of aa 296–331 in HinR was identified as the binding site for the stimulatory antibody. Deletions of this entire segment or any 10 amino acids within this segment from FSHR led to complete loss of antibody response and, surprisingly, response to the hormone as well despite all mutants exhibiting cell surface receptor density and affinity comparable with the wild type receptor. Interestingly, these mutants exhibited higher basal cAMP production. The mutant lacking LRRs with the intact HinR (Δ18–259) showed suppressed basal activity, which increased significantly with deletions extending to aa 331. These data suggest that the segment 296–331 acts as a tethered inverse agonist of the TMD and plays a very critical role in the hormonal activation of FSHR. The mutants lacking LRRs failed to bind FSH, whereas deletions in HinR had no effect on hormone binding, indicating that the LRRs constitute the primary high affinity binding site, whereas HinR may not play a significant role in FSH binding."
https://openalex.org/W2001721435,"Recent studies have revealed that in G protein-coupled receptor signalings switching between G protein- and beta-arrestin (betaArr)-dependent pathways occurs. In the case of opioid receptors, the signal is switched from the initial inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (AC) to an increase in AC activity (AC activation) during prolonged agonist treatment. The mechanism of such AC activation has been suggested to involve the switching of G proteins activated by the receptor, phosphorylation of signaling molecules, or receptor-dependent recruitment of cellular proteins. Using protein kinase inhibitors, dominant negative mutant studies and mouse embryonic fibroblast cells isolated from Src kinase knock-out mice, we demonstrated that mu-opioid receptor (OPRM1)-mediated AC activation requires direct association and activation of Src kinase by lipid raft-located OPRM1. Such Src activation was independent of betaArr as indicated by the ability of OPRM1 to activate Src and AC after prolonged agonist treatment in mouse embryonic fibroblast cells lacking both betaArr-1 and -2. Instead the switching of OPRM1 signals was dependent on the heterotrimeric G protein, specifically Gi2 alpha-subunit. Among the Src kinase substrates, OPRM1 was phosphorylated at Tyr336 within NPXXY motif by Src during AC activation. Mutation of this Tyr residue, together with mutation of Tyr166 within the DRY motif to Phe, resulted in the complete blunting of AC activation. Thus, the recruitment and activation of Src kinase by OPRM1 during chronic agonist treatment, which eventually results in the receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, is the key for switching the opioid receptor signals from its initial AC inhibition to subsequent AC activation."

Four ACs are regulated by physiological concentrations of Ca2+ and thereby provide a critical link between the Ca2+- and cAMP-signaling pathways (3Sunahara R.K. Dessauer C.W. Gilman A.G. Ann. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 461-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar, 5Cooper D.M.F. Mons N. Karpen J.W. Nature. 1995; 374: 421-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar); AC5 and AC6 are directly inhibited by Ca2+, whereas AC1 and AC8 are stimulated by Ca2+ in a calmodulin (CaM)-dependent manner (5Cooper D.M.F. Mons N. Karpen J.W. Nature. 1995; 374: 421-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). AC3 is also regulated by CaM in vitro, although this requires supramicromolar concentration of Ca2+ (6Choi E.J. Xia Z. Storm D.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6492-6498Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), and in vivo AC3 is inhibited by Ca2+ via CaM kinase II (7Wayman G.A. Impey S. Storm D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21480-21486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), unlike AC1 and AC8. AC1 is closely related in sequence to the Ca2+/CaM-stimulable rutabaga AC from Drosophila, which is important in Drosophila learning tasks (8Levin L.R. Han P.L. Hwang P.M. Feinstein P.G. Davis R.L.

AC1 and the other Ca2+/CaM-stimulable mammalian AC, AC8, have also been implicated in learning and memory (11Mons N. Guillou J.L. Jaffard R. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 525-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). As a means of establishing their proposed roles, single and/or double AC1 and AC8 knockout mice have been generated. Mouse models have demonstrated that Ca2+/CaM-stimulable ACs are involved in long-term potentiation and long-term memory (12Ferguson G.D. Storm D.R. Physiology (Bethesda). 2004; 19: 271-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). However, despite the general view that AC1 and AC8 can behave similarly, discrete physiological actions of each isoform are becoming apparent. Recent studies by Zhuo's group demonstrated that AC1 specifically participates in N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptor-induced neuronal excitotoxicity (13Wang H. Gong B. Vadakkan K.I. Toyoda H. Kaang B.K. Zhuo M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 1507-1517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and an increase in GluR1 synthesis induced by blocking AMPA receptors (14Gong B. Wang H. Gu S. Heximer S.P. Zhuo M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2007; 26: 275-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Nicol and colleagues (15Nicol X. Bennis M. Ishikawa Y. Chan G.C.K. Reperant J. Storm D.R. Gaspar P. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2006; 24: 3401-3414Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 16Nicol X. Muzerelle A. Rio J.P. Metin C. Gaspar P. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 862-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) showed a contribution of AC1, but not AC8, in axon terminal refinement in the retina. On the other hand, AC8 specifically was seen to be responsible for retrieval from adaptive presynaptic silencing (17Moulder K.L. Jiang X. Chang C. Taylor A.A. Benz A.M. Conti A.C. Muglia L.J. Mennerick S. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 5159-5168Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and the acquiring of new spatial information (18Zhang M. Moon C. Chan G.C.K. Yang L. Zheng F. Conti A.C. Muglia L. Muglia L.J. Storm D.R. Wang H. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 4736-4744Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). These differences in physiological roles must reflect not only differences in their distributions but also presumably in their regulatory properties. Both enzymes are expressed in brain; AC1 is neuro-specific, whereas the expression of AC8 is more widespread (1Defer N. Best-Belpomme M. Hanoune J. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: F400-F416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Ferguson G.D. Storm D.R. Physiology (Bethesda). 2004; 19: 271-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Within the central nervous system, AC1 is abundant in the hippocampus, the cerebral cortex, and the granule cells of the cerebellum, whereas AC8 has a high expression level in the thalamus and the cerebral cortex (19Nicol X. Muzerelle A. Bachy I. Ravary A. Gaspar P. J. Comp. Neurol. 2005; 486: 281-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Studies of mouse brain revealed that AC1 is distributed pre-synaptically and AC8 post-synaptically (18Zhang M. Moon C. Chan G.C.K. Yang L. Zheng F. Conti A.C. Muglia L. Muglia L.J. Storm D.R. Wang H. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 4736-4744Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 20Conti A.C. Maas Jr., J.W. Muglia L.M. Dave B.A. Vogt S.K. Tran T.T. Rayhel E.J. Muglia L.J. Neuroscience. 2007; 146: 713-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Although physiological differences in the roles of these two enzymes are suggested from the studies outlined above, the regulatory mechanisms that might underlie these differences are not. AC1 is more sensitive to Ca2+ than is AC8 in vitro (21Fagan K.A. Mahey R. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12438-12444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 22Villacres E.C. Wu Z. Hua W. Nielsen M.D. Watters J.J. Yan C. Beavo J. Storm D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14352-14357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), yet details on how these two enzymes are regulated by Ca2+/CaM are sparse. In non-excitable cells, a Ca2+ elevation caused by capacitative Ca2+ entry (CCE), the mode of Ca2+ entry triggered by emptying Ca2+ from internal stores (23Parekh A.B. Putney Jr., J.W. Physiol. Rev. 2005; 85: 757-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1795) Google Scholar), preferentially stimulates AC1 and AC8 (21Fagan K.A. Mahey R. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12438-12444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Although stimulation of AC8 by CCE has been shown to be at least partially dependent on its localization at lipid rafts (24Smith K.E. Gu C. Fagan K.A. Hu B. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6025-6031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), whether AC1 is also targeted to this region of plasma membranes has never been addressed. In addition, CaM regulation of AC1 and AC8 has not been compared in detail, although CaM appears to bind to different domains of the two enzymes. AC8 utilizes two CaM binding domains: a classic amphipathic “1-5-8-14” motif at the N terminus and an IQ-like motif in the C2b domain (25Gu C. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8012-8021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). A recent study indicates that CaM pre-associates with the N terminus of AC8, where it becomes fully saturated upon a Ca2+ rise, and activates the enzyme via a C-terminally mediated relief of auto-inhibitory mechanisms (26Simpson R.E. Ciruela A. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17379-17389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). By contrast, only residues 495–522 of the C1b region of AC1 have been shown to bind CaM in a Ca2+-dependent manner (27Levin L.R. Reed R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7573-7579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 28Vorherr T. Knopfel L. Hofmann F. Mollner S. Pfeuffer T. Carafoli E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6081-6088Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). With the presence of only one CaM binding domain in AC1, a simpler mechanism of CaM regulation might be expected. CaM mediates the regulation of numerous Ca2+-dependent processes in eukaryotic cells (29Hoeflich K.P. Ikura M. Cell. 2002; 108: 739-742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). The protein possesses N- and C-terminal lobes, both of which contain two Ca2+ binding EF hands (EF1 and EF2 in the N lobe, and EF3 and EF4 in the C lobe (30Babu Y.S. Sack J.S. Greenhough T.J. Bugg C.E. Means A.R. Cook W.J. Nature. 1985; 315: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar)). Mutations in the EF hands have been valuable for investigating the interaction of CaM with its targets. Alanine substitutions in the EF12 pair or EF34 pair have generated CaM12 and CaM34 to investigate the independent function of the C and N lobes of CaM, respectively (31Keen J.E. Khawaled R.

Alseikhan B.A. Alvania R.S. Yue D.T. Nature. 2001; 411: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Against the background of the distinct physiological roles carried out by AC1 and AC8, we performed a detailed comparison of the two enzymes expressed in HEK 293 cells. Their sensitivity to Ca2+/CaM was compared both in vitro and in vivo; the possibility that they might be expressed in different domains of the plasma membrane was addressed; and putative lobe-specific CaM regulation was assessed using Ca2+-binding mutants of CaM. Single cell measurements using a FRET-based cAMP sensor were performed to compare the kinetic responses of the enzymes to physiological elevations of [Ca2+]i. The results demonstrate superficial similarities in the regulation of AC1 and AC8 but critical disparities in their mechanism of activation by the lobes of CaM and in the speed and pattern of their responsiveness to [Ca2+]i. These discrete behaviors provide a physiological opportunity for different outcomes to elevation of [Ca2+]i, depending on the AC that is expressed in particular contexts. Materials—FSK and thapsigargin (TG) were purchased from Merck (Nottingham, UK). [2-3H]Adenine, [2,8-3H]cAMP, ECL Western blotting analysis system, Hyperfilm™, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG were obtained from GE Healthcare (Little Chalfont, UK). [α-32P]ATP was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Lipofectamine™ 2000 transfection reagent, fura-2/AM, fura-2 free acid, fura-FF free acid, and pluronic F-127 were from Invitrogen. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG was from Promega (Madison, WI). Polyclonal caveolin antibody was obtained from BD Transduction Laboratories, and monoclonal FLAG antibody was from Stratagene. M13 skeletal muscle myosin light chain kinase peptide (M13) was from Cambridge Bioscience (Cambridge, UK). CaM mutant constructs were a gift from J. H. Caldwell (University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver, CO), and cDNA encoding the Epac1-based fluorescent cAMP sensor (Epac1-camps) was a gift from M. J. Lohse (Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Würzburg, Germany). All other agents were purchased from Sigma unless stated otherwise. Construction of AC1 Expression Vectors—A cDNA fragment encoding the full-length AC1 (bovine) protein was excised from pcDNA3-AC1 using the restriction enzymes HindIII and SalI. The AC1 fragment was then subcloned into the HindIII/SalI-cut pCMV-Tag2A vector (Stratagene) to obtain the expression plasmid pCMV-AC1, which encodes the N-terminally FLAG-tagged AC1 protein. A DNA fragment encoding the N-terminal deletion mutant (Δ1–35) AC1M1 was amplified by PCR using Phusion DNA polymerase (Finnzymes) and pcDNA3-AC1 as template DNA (primers: 5′-CCCAAGCTTCTGCGGGCGTGCGATGAGGAG-3′ and 5′-ACGCGTCGACCTAAGCCTCCTTCCCAGAG-3′). The AC1M1 fragment was cut with HindIII/SalI, and subcloned into the HindIII/SalI-cut pCMV-Tag2B vector (Stratagene). Transfection of the plasmid pCMV-AC1M1 results in the expression of the N-terminally FLAG-tagged AC1M1 protein. To obtain the FLAG-tagged CaM binding mutant of AC1, AC1F503A, site-directed mutagenesis was performed according to the QuikChange protocol (Stratagene) using pCMV-AC1 as DNA template. The following primers were used: 5′-primer, 5′-CAGGTAGCACACGGTCTTGGCCTTCATCCTC-3′; 3′-primer, 5′-CCAAGAGGATGAAGGCCAAGACCGTGTGC-3′. Purification of Rat His6 CaM—Wild-type and mutant rat His6-CaM were produced following cloning of CaM cDNA into the pQE30 vector (Qiagen), and propagation in the XL10 Gold strain of Escherichia coli. His6-CaM was purified using TALON® resin (BD Clontech) immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography. Cell Culture and Transfection of HEK 293 Cells—HEK 293 cells (European Collection of Cell Cultures, Porton Down, UK) were grown in minimum essential medium with Earle's salts, supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 50 μg/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 μg/ml neomycin. The cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. To establish stable cell lines expressing AC8, AC8M1 (AC8Δ1–106), AC1, AC1M1, AC1F503A, or vector (pcDNA3.1; pcD), HEK 293 cells were transfected with 2 μg of cDNA according to the calcium phosphate method described previously (33Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4820) Google Scholar). Two days after transfection, cells were selected by growth in medium containing 800 μg/ml G-418 for 4 days, and subsequently maintained in medium containing 400 μg/ml G-418. For transient transfection with Epac1-camps, pcD or various forms of CaM cDNA, cells stably expressing AC1 or AC8 were plated onto 25-mm poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips or 100-mm dishes at 60% confluence 1 day prior to transfection with 1 μg of cDNA using Lipofectamine™ 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were used 2 days after transfection. Measurement of AC Activity—Determination of adenylyl cyclase activity in vitro was performed as described previously (34Boyajian C.L. Garritsen A. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4995-5003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications. Adenylyl cyclase activity of crude membranes isolated from transfected HEK 293 cells (35Martin A.C. Cooper D.M.F. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 70: 769-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) was measured in the presence of the following components: 12 mm phosphocreatine, 2.5 units of creatine phosphokinase, 0.1 mm cAMP, 1.4 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm ATP, 0.04 mm GTP, 0.5 mm IBMX, 0.5 μCi of [α-32P]ATP, and 10 μm FSK. Wild-type or mutant CaM was included where indicated. Free Ca2+ concentrations were established from a series of CaCl2 solutions buffered with 200 μm EGTA, based on the BAD4 program (36Brooks S.P. Storey K.B. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 201: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) and confirmed by spectrofluorometric measurements with fura-2 and fura-FF as described previously (26Simpson R.E. Ciruela A. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17379-17389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Membranes were washed twice with assay buffer (800 μm EGTA, 0.25% bovine serum albumin, 40 mm Tris, pH 7.4) to remove Ca2+-bound CaM before starting the assay. Where indicated, membranes were incubated with 1 μm M13 for 10 min at 4 °C prior to washing with assay buffer. The reaction mixture (final volume, 100 μl) was incubated at 30 °C for 20 min, and the reactions were terminated with 0.5% (w/v) sodium lauryl sulfate. [3H]cAMP (∼6000 cpm) was added as a recovery marker, and the [32P]cAMP formed was quantitated using a sequential chromatography technique described previously (37Salomon Y. Londos C. Rodbell M. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 58: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (3374) Google Scholar). Data points are presented as mean activities ± S.D. of triplicate determinations. Where indicated, the AC activity of cells transfected with empty vector was subtracted from the data. [Ca2+]i Measurements in Cell Populations—[Ca2+]i was measured in populations of HEK 293 cells as described previously (38Chiono M. Mahey R. Tate G. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1149-1155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were loaded with 2 μm fura-2/AM plus 0.02% pluronic F-127 for 40 min at room temperature, washed twice, and then aliquoted into samples containing 4 × 106 cells. The cells were finally resuspended in 3 ml of nominally Ca2+-free Krebs buffer (120 mm NaCl, 4.75 mm KCl, 1.44 mm MgSO4, 11 mm glucose, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4), and used for [Ca2+]i measurements in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50B spectrofluorometer. Fluorescence emission ratios at 340 nm/380 nm were measured and converted to [Ca2+]i values using the standard formula (39Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Measurement of cAMP Accumulation—cAMP accumulation in intact cells was measured as described previously (40Evans T. Smith M.M. Tanner L.I. Harden T.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1984; 26: 395-404PubMed Google Scholar), with some modifications. Transfected HEK 293 cells were incubated in minimum essential medium with [2-3H]adenine (1.5 μCi/well in 24-well plates) at 37 °C for 90 min to label the ATP pool. Assays were carried out in Krebs buffer supplemented with bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml) at 30 °C and terminated by the addition of ice-cold 5% (w/v final concentration) trichloroacetic acid. Unlabeled cAMP (50 μl, 20 mm), ATP (10 μl, 65 mm), and [α-32P]ATP (∼6000 cpm) were added to monitor recovery of cAMP and ATP. The [3H]ATP and [3H]cAMP contents were quantified using the sequential chromatography technique described above (see “Measurement of Adenylyl Cyclase Activity”). Accumulation of cAMP is expressed as the conversion of [3H]ATP into [3H]cAMP. Results are presented as mean ± S.D. of triplicate determinations. Non-detergent Isolation and Immunoblotting of Raft and Non-raft Membranes—Raft and non-raft membranes were separated by a procedure that exploited their different buoyancies as previously described (41Yamamoto M. Toya Y. Schwencke C. Lisanti M.P. Myers Jr., M.G. Ishikawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26962-26968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), using sonication with sodium bicarbonate (42Crossthwaite A.J. Seebacher T. Masada N. Ciruela A. Dufraux K. Schultz J.E. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6380-6391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Raft and non-raft membranes were resolved using 7.5 and 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, as described previously (42Crossthwaite A.J. Seebacher T. Masada N. Ciruela A. Dufraux K. Schultz J.E. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6380-6391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Anti-FLAG antibody (1:1000) or anti-caveolin polyclonal antibody (1:5000) was used as a primary antibody, and goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:3000) or goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:5000) was used as a secondary antibody, respectively. Membranes were then treated with ECL reagent and exposed to Hyperfilm™. Single Cell Measurement of [Ca2+]i—[Ca2+]i in single cells was measured as described previously (43Willoughby D. Cooper D.M.F. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 828-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were plated onto poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips 1 day before experiments and loaded with 2 μm fura-2/AM plus 0.02% Pluronic F-127 for 40 min at room temperature in HBS buffer (140 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 0.2 mm MgCl2, 11 mm d-glucose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) with 1 mm CaCl2. After loading, cells were washed, further incubated in HBS buffer to de-esterify intracellular AM esters, and then imaged using a CoolSNAP-HQ CCD camera (Photometrics, Tucson, AZ) and monochromator system (Cairn Research, Kent, UK) attached to a Nikon TMD microscope (×40 objective). Emission images (D510/80M) at 340 nm and 380 nm excitation were collected every second with MetaFluor software (Molecular Devices, Downingtown, PA). Data are plotted as 340/380 nm ratio changes (Δ340/380) relative to the fluorescence ratio at 0 min. Single Cell Measurement of cAMP in AC1 and AC8 Expressing Cells Using Epac1-based Fluorescent cAMP Sensor—[cAMP]i in single cells expressing AC1 or AC8 was measured by fluorescent imaging of Epac1-camps as described previously (43Willoughby D. Cooper D.M.F. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 828-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Briefly, images were captured using an Andor Ixon+ camera and an Optosplit (505DC) to separate CFP (470 nm) and YFP (535 nm) emission images (Cairn Research). For dual emission-ratio imaging, cells were excited at 436 nm using a monochromator (Cairn Research) and 51017 filter set (Chroma, Rockingham, VT) attached to a Nikon eclipse TE2000-S microscope (×40 objective). Emission images at 470 nm and 535 nm were collected every 3 s (250-ms integration time). Captured images were background-subtracted and analyzed using Metamorph imaging software (Molecular Devices). Fluorescence resonance energy transfer data are plotted as changes in 470 nm versus 535 nm (ΔCFP/YFP) emission ratio relative to the fluorescence ratio at 0 min, for each individual cell. Curve-fitting and Statistical Analysis—Sigmoidal dose-response curves, linear regressions, and kinetic parameters were obtained using GraphPad Prism Version 4 (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA). Results are shown as mean ± S.D. of at least three individual experiments, or mean ± S.E. The initial rates of increase in [cAMP]i in single cell measurements were determined by obtaining slopes of linear regressions fitted over a 20-s period, starting 30 s after the addition of TG or carbachol (CCh). Statistical significance was assessed by using one-way analysis of variance followed by Newman-Keuls multiple comparisons tests, where p < 0.05 was considered significant. AC1 and AC8 Differ in Their Regulation by Ca2+—To establish a baseline for comparing the regulation of AC1 and AC8 by Ca2+, their responses were first examined in vitro. Prior to each assay, membranes prepared from HEK 293 cells stably expressing AC1 or AC8 were washed in EGTA to remove Ca2+-dependent bound CaM. AC1 and AC8 were stimulated by 10 μm FSK and a range of [Ca2+]free in the absence (control) or presence of exogenous CaM (1 μm). Inclusion of 10 μm FSK enhanced the activities of both enzymes, allowing more sensitive assays, although this did not affect the individual kinetics of regulation by Ca2+/CaM (data not shown). Membranes from HEK 293 cells stably expressing empty vector (pcD) showed Ca2+ inhibition (supplemental Fig. S1) due to the background of the Ca2+-inhibitable AC6 in these cells (44Hellevuo K. Yoshimura M. Kao M. Hoffman P.L. Cooper D.M.F. Tabakoff B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 192: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To eliminate the inhibitory component, endogenous AC activity was subtracted from activities measured in membranes from cells expressing AC1 or AC8 at each Ca2+ concentration (Fig. 1, A and B). AC1 and AC8 were both robustly stimulated by submicromolar concentrations of Ca2+ (Fig. 1, A and B). (Their sensitivities to Ca2+ were unaffected by the background subtraction (data not shown).) A reduced Ca2+ stimulation in AC1 and AC8 was seen in the absence of added CaM, indicating that both enzymes can be regulated by CaM that was not removed by the wash with EGTA. To verify that the observed residual Ca2+ stimulation was due to endogenous CaM, the synthetic peptide M13 was used as a “CaM sponge.” M13 is a 26-residue peptide derived from a CaM binding domain of skeletal muscle myosin light chain kinase (45Ikura M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Zhu G. Klee C.B. Bax A. Science. 1992; 256: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar), which has a very high affinity for CaM (Kd ∼ 0.2 nm (46Findlay W.A.

However, UDP-xylose transport across isolated Golgi membranes has been documented, and we recently succeeded with the cloning of a human UDP-xylose transporter (SLC25B4). Here we provide new evidence for a functional role of UDP-xylose transport by characterization of a new Chinese hamster ovary cell mutant, designated pgsI-208, that lacks UXS activity.

The data presented in this study suggest the bidirectional transport of UDP-xylose across endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi membranes and its role in controlling homeostasis of UDP-glucuronic acid and UDP-xylose production. Xylose is only known to occur in two different mammalian glycans. First, xylose is the starting sugar residue of the common tetrasaccharide, GlcAβ1,3Galβ1,3Galβ1,4Xylβ1-O-Ser, attached to proteoglycan core proteins to initiate the biosynthesis of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) 2The abbreviations used are: GAG, glycosaminoglycan; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; EGF, epidermal growth factor; FGF, fibroblast growth factor; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; UGDH, UDP-glucose dehydrogenase; UXS, UDP-xylose synthase; XylT, xylosyltransferase; AtXylT, A. thaliana β1,2-xylosyltransferase; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; MS, mass spectrometry; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. (1Roden L. Armand G. J. Biol. Chem.. 1966; 241: 65-70Google Scholar). Second, xylose is found in the trisaccharide Xylα1,3Xylα1,3Glcβ1-O-Ser in epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats of proteins, such as blood coagulation factors VII and IX (2Hase S. Kawabata S.

Two variants of O-xylosyltransferases (XylT1 and XylT2) are responsible for the initiation of glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis, which differ in terms of acceptor specificity and tissue distribution (4Ponighaus C.

On Notch, O-glucose occurs on EGF repeats in a similar fashion as O-fucose, which modifications have been shown to influence ligand-mediated Notch signaling (11Bruckner K. Perez L. Clausen H.

Recently, rumi, the gene encoding the Notch O-glucosyltransferase in Drosophila, has been identified, and inactivation of the gene was found to cause a temperature-sensitive Notch phenotype (17Acar M.

Although this finding clearly demonstrated that O-glucosylation is essential for Notch signaling, the importance of xylosylation for Notch functions remains ambiguous. Several different Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines with defects in GAG biosynthesis have been isolated by screening for reduced incorporation of sulfate (18Esko J.D. Stewart T.E. Taylor W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 1985; 82: 3197-3201Google Scholar) and reduced binding of fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2) (19Bai X. Esko J.D. J. Biol.

Mutants that affect overall GAG biosynthesis were shown to have a defect in the assembly of the common core tetrasaccharide. Interestingly, these latter mutants could be separated into clones in which GAG biosynthesis can be restored by the external addition of xylosides as artificial primers and those that cannot (18Esko J.D. Stewart T.E. Taylor W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 1985; 82: 3197-3201Google Scholar). The two mutants belonging to the first group are pgsA-745 and pgsB-761. Although pgs-745 is defective in XylT2 (4Ponighaus C. Ambrosius M. Casanova J.C. Prante C. Kuhn J. Esko J.D. Kleesiek K. Götting C. J. Biol. Chem.. 2007; 282: 5201-5206Google Scholar, 5Voglmeir J.

Stewart T.E. Taylor W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 1985; 82: 3197-3201Google Scholar), pgsB-761 exhibits a defect in galactosyltransferase I (B4GalT7), the enzyme that catalyzes the first step in the elongation of the xylosylated protein (25 (see Fig. 1B). Restoration of GAG biosynthesis in the latter mutant presumably occurs through a second β1-4-galactosyltransferase, able to act on xylosides when provided at high concentration but not on the endogenous protein-linked xylose. Here we describe the isolation of a third CHO cell line (pgsI-208) with the xyloside-correctable phenotype. The mutant is deficient in UDP-xylose synthase (UXS), also known as UDP-glucuronic acid decarboxylase. This enzyme catalyzes the synthesis of UDP-Xyl, the common donor substrate for the different xylosyltransferases, by decarboxylation of UDP-glucuronic acid. Importantly, UXS in the animal cell is localized in the lumen of the ER and/or Golgi (26Hwang H.Y. Horvitz H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2002; 99: 14218-14223Google Scholar, 27Kearns A.E.

Fuhlrott J. Helmus Y. Wild M. Gerardy-Schahn R. Bakker H. J. Biol. Chem.. 2005; 280: 27230-27235Google Scholar). Using this cell variant, experiments were designed that establish the functional significance of UDP-Xyl transport with respect to UDP-glucuronic acid production and xylosylation. Cell Cultures and Plasmids—Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-K1) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (CCL-61; Manassas, VA). Mutant pgsA-745 (XylT-deficient) and pgsB-761 (GalTI-deficient) were characterized previously (18Esko J.D. Stewart T.E. Taylor W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem.. 1987; 262: 12189-12195Google Scholar), and the mutant line described here was named pgsI-208. Cells were grown under an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in α-minimal essential medium containing ribonucleosides and deoxyribonucleosides (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Biochrom AG, Berlin, Germany). A cDNA clone of human UXS1 (Hugo Genome Nomenclature Committee ID: 17729) was amplified from prostate gland Marathonready cDNA (Clontech) using primers with EcoRI- and XbaI-flanking start and replacing stop codon, respectively, and cloned in pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) already containing FLAG (N-terminal) and hemagglutinin (C-terminal) tags. XylT2 cDNA (Hugo Genome Nomenclature Committee ID: 15517) was amplified from a human embryonic kidney cDNA library (Invitrogen) using primers with BglII and XbaI flanking the start and stop codon, respectively, and cloned BamHI-XbaI in pcDNA3 containing an N-terminal FLAG tag. A cytoplasmic form of human UXS1 (cytUXS1) was amplified from the full-length clone by primers amplifying the region coding from amino acid 38 to the C terminus and cloned in pcDNA3-FLAG-hemagglutinin like the full-length construct. Arabidopsis thaliana UXS3 (30Harper A.D. Bar-Peled M. Plant Physiol.. 2002; 130: 2188-2198Google Scholar) (AT5G59290) was amplified by primers covering the complete open reading frame from a cDNA library (31Bakker H. Lommen A. Jordi W. Stiekema W. Bosch D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun.. 1999; 261: 829-832Google Scholar) and cloned into pcDNA3-FLAG-hemagglutinin. Arabidopsis β1,2-xylosyltransferase (AtXylT; AT5G55500) (32Strasser R. Mucha J. Mach L. Altmann F. Wilson I.B. Glössl J. Steinkellner H.

Methods Cell Biol.. 1989; 32: 387-422Google Scholar). Approximately 2 × 105 cells of pgsI-208 were added to individual wells of a 24-well plate along with an equal number of pgsA-745 or pgsB-761 cells. After overnight incubation, the mixed cell monolayers were treated for 1 min with 50% (w/w) polyethylene glycol (Mr = 3350) in F-12 medium. The cells were incubated for 1 day, replated in 100-mm diameter tissue culture dishes to obtain ∼300 colonies/dish, and then overlaid with polyester cloth. The replica-plated colonies were incubated with 35SO4 as described (21Bai X. Wei G. Sinha A. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem.. 1999; 274: 13017-13024Google Scholar). Complementation was assessed by the appearance of colonies that regained the capacity to incorporate 35SO4 into acid-precipitable material, as judged by autoradiography. Complementation by cDNA was carried out by transient transfection using Metafectene (Biontex, Munich, Germany) of pgsI-208 with UXS1 or an empty vector control together with AtXylT. Two days after transfection, cells were fixed in 1.5% glutaraldehyde and stained with polyclonal rabbit anti-horseradish peroxidase (HRP), recognizing xylosylated plant N-glycans (Rockland) followed by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody and developed with Fast-Red substrate (Sigma). Flow Cytometry—Mutant cells were transfected with plasmids expressing UXS1, cytUXS1, or XylT2 using Metafectene. Cells were selected for stable expression by G418 (Calbiochem), and selected colonies were checked for expression by immunofluorescence using anti-FLAG-M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma). For flow cytometry, 5 × 105 cells were released with phosphate-buffered saline, 2 mm EDTA and incubated with RB4Ea12, a vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein-tagged single chain phage display antibody recognizing heparan sulfate (35Jenniskens G.J.

Cytochem.. 2003; 51: 727-739Google Scholar), followed by mouse anti-vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein tag monoclonal antibody (P5D4; Sigma) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-mouse. Cells (104) were analyzed by flow cytometry (FACScan; BD Biosciences). Sequence Analysis of CHO UXS1—Chinese hamster UXS1 cDNA was amplified using primers based on conserved parts of human, mouse, and rat sequences covering the sequence from amino acid 37 to 420 (C terminus); GTATGGTACCTTTGTTAACATGAGGTCTAT and GACTTCTAGAGCTGTGGCGCGTCCGGCCCT and cloned BamHI/XbaI (underlined) in pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) for sequencing. Based on this sequence, CHO-specific primers were used to amplify UXS1 mRNA from pgsI-208 in two parts, CAGGAAAATGGTGAACTAAAGT with CGACTCGTTTGCCCTCG to cover amino acids 44-237 and GTCTGCTCCTGGCCTCCACA with TGGGGATGTACTGGTTATTG to cover amino acids 196-406 from a total of 420 amino acids (numbering based on the human sequence). The fragments were cloned in TopoTA (Invitrogen) for sequencing. The genomic fragment around the identified mutation was amplified using AGGTATATGGATCTGGGTCT and ACCTGACATACTGGAACGC and again cloned in TopoTA. Analyses of Xylosylation of EGF Repeats—A construct encoding EGF repeats 1-5 of the mouse Notch1 extracellular domain in pSecTag (Invitrogen) described previously (37Shao L. Moloney D.J. Haltiwanger R. J. Biol. Chem.. 2003; 278: 7775-7782Google Scholar) was transiently transfected in 107 CHO, pgsA-745, and pgsI-208 cells. After 72 h, the fragments were purified by rotating the medium with Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (30 μl of beads; Qiagen) for 1 h at 4 °C. After extensive washing (five times with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS), the fragments were eluted with 100 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and analyzed for the presence of O-glucose glycans by mass spectrometry as described (17Acar M. Jafar-Nejad H. Takeuchi H. Rajan A. Ibrani D. Rana N.A. Pan H. Haltiwanger R.S. Bellen H.J. Cell.. 2008; 132: 247-258Google Scholar, 38Nita-Lazar A. Haltiwanger R.S. Methods Enzymol.. 2006; 417: 93-111Google Scholar). Briefly, samples were reduced and alkylated, separated by SDS-PAGE, and subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion. The resulting tryptic peptides were then analyzed by liquid chromatography-MS/MS on an Agilent XCT ion trap mass spectrometer. O-Glucose-modified peptides were identified by neutral loss searches as described previously (17Acar M. Jafar-Nejad H. Takeuchi H. Rajan A. Ibrani D. Rana N.A. Pan H. Haltiwanger R.S. Bellen H.J. Cell.. 2008; 132: 247-258Google Scholar, 38Nita-Lazar A. Haltiwanger R.S. Methods Enzymol.. 2006; 417: 93-111Google Scholar). A detailed description of the mass spectral analysis of O-glucose glycans on mouse Notch1 is being published separately. 3A. Nita-Lazar, N. A. Rana, H. Takeuchi, R. Orhue, M. P. Myers, K. B. Luther, and R. S. Haltiwanger, submitted for publication. Nucleotide Sugar Composition—Nucleotide sugars were isolated by formic acid extraction as described for yeast (39Oka T. Jigami Y. FEBS J.. 2006; 273: 2645-2657Google Scholar). About 8 × 107 cells of wild-type and mutant CHO cells were pelleted and resuspended in 5 ml of 1 m formic acid saturated with butanol. After 1 h of shaking at 4 °C, samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 13,000 × g, and the supernatants were lyophilized and dissolved in 200 μl of water. Insoluble material was sedimented, and 50 μl of the supernatants were separated on a Develosil RPAQUEOUS column (250 × 4.6 mm; Nomura Chemical Co., Ltd., Seto, Japan). The column was equilibrated with 20 mm triethylamine acetate buffer (pH 7.0) at a flow rate of 0.7 ml·min-1. UDP-sugars were detected by UV260 nm absorbance. The peaks of UDP-Glc, UDP-GlcA, and UDP-Xyl were collected based on the retention times of the standards. The combined fractions were reloaded on the same column and run under the same conditions. Identities of peaks were confirmed by mass spectrometry as described (39Oka T. Jigami Y. FEBS J.. 2006; 273: 2645-2657Google Scholar). A CHO Cell Mutant Deficient in Xylose Incorporation—A CHO cell clone, designated pgsI-208 according to the nomenclature of previously identified proteoglycan synthesis mutants (21Bai X. Wei G. Sinha A. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem.. 1999; 274: 13017-13024Google Scholar), was selected from a mutagenized population using FGF-2-Saporin, a recombinant chimera consisting of FGF-2 fused to the plant cytotoxin saporin-6 (Selective Genetics, Inc., La Jolla, CA), as described for the isolation of a glucuronyltransferase I mutant (21Bai X. Wei G. Sinha A. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem.. 1999; 274: 13017-13024Google Scholar). Since FGF-2 binds to heparan sulfate, this procedure selects for mutants deficient in heparan sulfate biosynthesis. The addition of naphthol-β-d-xyloside restored the incorporation of 35SO4 in GAGs in pgsI-208 (Table 1) as in the previously isolated mutant pgsA-745, exhibiting a defect in the GAG initiating XylT2 (4Ponighaus C.

Sci. U. S. A.. 1985; 82: 3197-3201Google Scholar). This result indicated that all of the downstream enzymes were present, and mutation in an upstream step involved in xylosylation or production of precursors was anticipated.TABLE 1GAG content of mutant pgsl-208Strain[6-3H]Glucosamine35SO4Without Xylβ-O-NpWith Xylβ-O-Npcpm/μg cell proteincpm/μg cell proteinCHO229142251pgsA-745203763pgsI-2083814185 Open table in a new tab The cell line was then fused pairwise to mutants pgsA-745 and pgsB-761, the two previously isolated mutants in which xyloside restores GAG synthesis (18Esko J.D.

Chem.. 1987; 262: 12189-12195Google Scholar), to test for genetic complementation (34Esko J.D. Methods Cell Biol.. 1989; 32: 387-422Google Scholar). Fusion of pgsI-208 cells with pgsA-745 and pgsB-761 also restored GAG synthesis (not shown), indicating that the defect was different from these strains. To test if UDP-Xyl, the substrate for the xylosyltransferases, was available in the Golgi of pgsI-208 cells, AtXylT was expressed by transient transfection. This approach provides a convenient way to measure UDP-Xyl indirectly, since the epitope formed by this enzyme on N-glycans is absent in mammalian cells and can be readily detected on the cell surface using rabbit anti-HRP, which is reactive to plant type N-glycans containing β-linked xylose (40Faye L. Gomord V. Fitchette-Laine A.C. Chrispeels M.J. Anal. Biochem.. 1993; 209: 104-108Google Scholar). In wild type CHO cells, transient expression of AtXylT resulted in anti-HRP-positive cells, whereas transfection of mutant pgsI-208 cells did not (Fig. 2A). The simultaneous absence of GAG biosynthesis and xylosylation of N-glycans in the mutant strongly suggested that the substrate UDP-Xyl used by all xylosyltransferases in the ER or Golgi lumen was not available. pgsI-208 Exhibits a Defective UDP-xylose Synthase—Current evidence suggests that UDP-xylose is generated inside the ER/Golgi lumen by decarboxylation of UDP-GlcA through the enzyme UXS (26Hwang H.Y. Horvitz H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2002; 99: 14218-14223Google Scholar, 27Kearns A.E. Vertel B.M. Schwartz N.B. J. Biol. Chem.. 1993; 268: 11097-11104Google Scholar, 28Moriarity J.L. Hurt K.J. Resnick A.C. Storm P.B. Laroy W. Schnaar R.L. Snyder S.H. J. Biol. Chem.. 2002; 277: 16968-16975Google Scholar). To test if this enzyme was missing from the mutant, a UXS-expressing plasmid was co-transfected with AtXylT. Xylosylation of N-glycans was restored under these conditions, indicating that the absence of UXS was the cause of the observed phenotypes of these cells (Fig. 2A). No salvage pathway for xylose exists in CHO cells, since feeding cells with up to 10 mm xylose did not result in any detectable incorporation of xylose into N-glycans upon expression of AtXylT (not shown). Reverse transcription-PCR, using two primer pairs covering approximately each half of the coding region of the hamster UXS, showed that mRNA was made. Sequencing of these fragments, however, revealed an exchange of a CAG codon (glutamine 295) for a TAG stop codon. Presumably, truncation of the C-terminal 125 amino acids from the full-length version of the protein (420 amino acids) inactivated the enzyme, suggesting that this point mutation was the cause of the UXS deficiency in the mutant. Sequencing the genomic region confirmed the presence of this mutation but also showed that only one allele was affected. Since only the mutant allele was detected in cDNAs prepared from the mutant, we concluded that the second allele is inactive, a phenomenon not uncommon in CHO cells, which are considered to be partly functionally haploid (41Siminovitch L. Cell.. 1976; 7: 1-11Google Scholar). pgsI-208 Lacks Both Glycosaminoglycans and Xylosylation of O-Glucose-linked Glycans on EGF Repeats of Notch—Since pgsI-208 was selected for resistance to FGF-2-saporin, the absence of heparan sulfate was anticipated. To examine this possibility, pgsI-208 cells were analyzed by flow cytometry using antibody RB4Ea12 against heparan sulfate (35Jenniskens G.J. Oosterhof A. Brandwijk R. Veerkamp J.H. van Kuppevelt T.H. J. Neurosci.. 2000; 20: 4099-4111Google Scholar, 36ten Dam G.B. Hafmans T. Veerkamp J.H. van Kuppevelt T.H. J. Histochem. Cytochem.. 2003; 51: 727-739Google Scholar). Wild-type CHO cells exhibited strong staining by this antibody, whereas pgsI-208 did not and behaved like pgsA-745 cells, defective in XylT2 (Fig. 2). Expression of human UXS1 and XylT2 in pgsI-208 and pgsA-745, respectively, restored antibody binding to a level comparable with wild-type CHO cells (Fig. 2, B and C). To investigate the presence of xylose in O-glucose-linked glycans, a secreted construct containing the first five EGF-like repeats of mouse Notch1 (37Shao L. Moloney D.J. Haltiwanger R. J. Biol. Chem.. 2003; 278: 7775-7782Google Scholar), was expressed in CHO, pgsA-745, and pgsI-208 cells. The C-terminal His tag on this protein allowed its purification from the medium. Tryptic peptides were analyzed for the presence of O-glucose glycans using liquid chromatography-MS/MS (38Nita-Lazar A. Haltiwanger R.S. Methods Enzymol.. 2006; 417: 93-111Google Scholar). We have previously identified a tryptic peptide from EGF 4 bearing an O-glucose trisaccharide when analyzing samples derived from Lec1-CHO cells 3A. Nita-Lazar, N. A. Rana, H. Takeuchi, R. Orhue, M. P. Myers, K. B. Luther, and R. S. Haltiwanger, submitted for publication. (Fig. 3). In both wild-type cells (not shown) and pgsA-745, the same peptide modified with O-glucose trisaccharide was detected (m/z = 1255.1; Fig. 3A). In contrast, analysis of the sample from pgsI-208 revealed the presence of the peptide modified with a single hexose residue (m/z = 1166.7; Fig. 3B). The peptide modified with a single hexose elutes slightly later (53.7 min; Fig. 3B) than that with the trisaccharide (52.9 min; Fig. 3A), consistent with the predicted effects of two fewer sugars on retention time. Searches of the data showed that the trisaccharide form was present in the sample from pgsA-745 but not pgsI-208 (Fig. 3C), whereas the monosaccharide form was found in pgsI-208 but not pgsA-745 (Fig. 3D). These data suggested that the defect in UXS prevents the addition of xyloses to O-glucose on EGF repeats. The UDP-GlcA Content of pgsI-208 Is Dramatically Increased—The enzyme UDP-glucose dehydrogenase (UGDH) (Fig. 1) is known to be inhibited by UDP-Xyl (42Neufeld E.F. Hall C.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun.. 1965; 19: 456-461Google Scholar). In Cryptococcus neoformans, the absence of cytosolic UXS results in an drastic increase of the UDP-GlcA concentration due to lack of feedback inhibition of the dehydrogenase by UDP-Xyl (43Griffith C.L. Klutts J.S. Zhang L. Levery S.B. Doering T.L. J. Biol. Chem.. 2004; 279: 51669-51676Google Scholar). To investigate the consequences of reduced UDP-Xyl production in the mammalian cell line where UXS is localized in the ER/Golgi lumen, the composition of the pool of relevant nucleotide sugars was determined in wild-type, XylT2 (pgsA-745), and UXS (pgsI-208) mutants using formic acid extraction and HPLC analyses (39Oka T. Jigami Y. FEBS J.. 2006; 273: 2645-2657Google Scholar). pgsA-745 and wild-type cells showed the same content of UDP-Glc, UDP-GlcA, and UDP-Xyl (Fig. 4, A and B), indicating that the absence of GAG synthesis had no influence on the ratio of these nucleotide sugars. Conversely, UDP-Xyl was completely absent in pgsI-208, whereas the concentration of UDP-GlcA was dramatically increased to a level about 200 times higher than the level in wild-type cells (Fig. 4). This finding strongly suggested that the luminally produced UDP-Xyl is controlling the cytoplasmically produced UDP-GlcA pool. Xylose Incorporation in Glycans Is Restored by Cytoplasmic Expression of UXS—Previous in vitro experiments have shown that UDP-Xyl can be transported across the Golgi membrane (27Kearns A.E. Vertel B.M. Schwartz N.B. J. Biol. Chem.. 1993; 268: 11097-11104Google Scholar, 44Nuwayhid N. Glaser J.H. Johnson J.C. Conrad H.E. Hauser S.C. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem.. 1986; 261: 12936-12941Google Scholar), and a Golgi-localized UDP-Xyl transporter has been identified (29Ashikov A. Routier F. Fuhlrott J. Helmus Y. Wild M. Gerardy-Schahn R. Bakker H. J. Biol. Chem.. 2005; 280: 27230-27235Google Scholar). The in vivo significance of these findings is not known. To investigate if the transporter can function in vivo, two UXS expressing plasmids, cytoplasmic Arabidopsis UXS3 (30Harper A.D. Bar-Peled M. Plant Physiol.. 2002; 130: 2188-2198Google Scholar) and a human UXS expressed without the putative N-terminal transmembrane domain (cytUXS1), were transiently expressed together with AtXylT in pgsI-208 cells. Cytoplasmic localization of the UXS proteins was confirmed by immunofluorescence (not shown). Cytoplasmic UXS rendered cells positive for rabbit anti-HRP, which recognizes xylosylated N-glycans (Fig. 5A). More quantitative data were provided by stable expression of cytUXS in pgsI-208 and analyses of the cells with the anti-heparan sulfate antibody by flow cytometry (Fig. 5B). GAG biosynthesis was fully restored in these cells, indicating that sufficient UDP-Xyl could be provided to the lumen of the ER/Golgi from UDP-Xyl produced in the cytoplasm. As expected, expression of cytoplasmic UXS decreased UDP-GlcA production, but the extent of inhibition was not as great as when UXS was expressed in the ER/Golgi. As shown in Fig. 5C, UDP-Xyl was detectable, but the UDP-GlcA level was only reduced by a factor of ∼4 compared with pgsI-208 cells. In contrast, recombinant expression of UXS in the compartmental lumen normalized nucleotide sugar levels to that of wild-type cells (Fig. 5D). In this report, we describe a new CHO mutant, named here pgsI-208, defective in UXS, the enzyme generating UDP-Xyl. Lack of UDP-Xyl results in absence of both GAG biosynthesis and the addition of xylose to O-glucose glycans of EGF repeats present in Notch. Since CHO cells make both heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate, both types of GAGs are anticipated to be lacking in this cell line. Notch is the only protein carrying the Xylα1-3Xylα1-3Glcβ-O-Ser trisaccharide tested in the system (3Moloney D.J. Shair L.H. Lu F.M. Xia J. Locke R. Matta K.L. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol. Chem.. 2000; 275: 9604-9611Google Scholar), but presumably other proteins bearing this sequence would be affected as well. The mutant also has the interesting phenotype of deregulated production of UDP-GlcA and led to the discovery that when provided with a cytosolic source of UDP-Xyl, this nucleotide sugar can be imported into Golgi and/or ER. UXS was originally cloned from the pathogenic fungus C. neoformans (45Bar-Peled M. Griffith C.L. Doering T.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2001; 98: 12003-12008Google Scholar) and later from other eukaryotes (28Moriarity J.L. Hurt K.J. Resnick A.C. Storm P.B. Laroy W. Schnaar R.L. Snyder S.H. J. Biol. Chem.. 2002; 277: 16968-16975Google Scholar, 30Harper A.D. Bar-Peled M. Plant Physiol.. 2002; 130: 2188-2198Google Scholar, 46Kobayashi M. Nakagawa H. Suda I. Miyagawa I. Matoh T. Plant Cell Physiol.. 2002; 43: 1259-1265Google Scholar). Mutants in the enzyme have been isolated from C. neoformans (47Moyrand F. Klaproth B. Himmelreich U. Dromer F. Janbon G. Mol. Microbiol.. 2002; 45: 837-849Google Scholar), where it is one of the capsule structure mutant strains (Cas2), and in Caenorhabditis elegans (26Hwang H.Y. Horvitz H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2002; 99: 14218-14223Google Scholar) as one of the squashed vulva (sqv-1) mutants affecting chondroitin and heparan sulfate biosynthesis. In CHO cells, like in C. neoformans (43Griffith C.L. Klutts J.S. Zhang L. Levery S.B. Doering T.L. J. Biol. Chem.. 2004; 279: 51669-51676Google Scholar), inactivation of UXS resulted in an increase of cellular UDP-GlcA. In vitro experiments have shown that UGDH, which generates UDP-GlcA from UDP-Glc, is inhibited by UDP-Xyl (42Neufeld E.F. Hall C.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun.. 1965; 19: 456-461Google Scholar). Inhibition evidently occurs in vivo as well, since the absence of UDP-xylose resulted in a dramatic increase in UDP-GlcA. The accumulation of UDP-GlcA was most likely due to deregulated synthesis as opposed to a lack of consumption of UDP-GlcA. This conclusion is based on the observation that in pgsA-745, which, like pgsI-208, cannot incorporate UDP-GlcA into glycosaminoglycans, the ratio of UDP-Glc, UDP-GlcA, and UDP-Xyl was unchanged compared with wild-type CHO cells. In yeast, a system that does not utilize UDP-GlcA and UDP-Xyl, expression of UGDH can convert more than half of the UDP-Glc pool into UDP-GlcA (39Oka T. Jigami Y. FEBS J.. 2006; 273: 2645-2657Google Scholar). After additional expression of UXS, UDP-GlcA was no longer detectable due to substoichiometric accumulation of UDP-Xyl. In contrast to fungi, where the enzyme is cytoplasmic (43Griffith C.L. Klutts J.S. Zhang L. Levery S.B. Doering T.L. J. Biol. Chem.. 2004; 279: 51669-51676Google Scholar), UXS of mammals (28Moriarity J.L. Hurt K.J. Resnick A.C. Storm P.B. Laroy W. Schnaar R.L. Snyder S.H. J. Biol. Chem.. 2002; 277: 16968-16975Google Scholar) and C. elegans (26Hwang H.Y. Horvitz H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2002; 99: 14218-14223Google Scholar) and two of the three plant enzymes (30Harper A.D. Bar-Peled M. Plant Physiol.. 2002; 130: 2188-2198Google Scholar) are localized in the ER/Golgi lumen. Theoretically, physical separation of UDP-Xyl production from UDP-GlcA production provides a mechanism for cells to avoid inhibition of UGDH by UDP-Xyl. However, our current data do not support this hypothesis, because they clearly show that UDP-GlcA production is regulated by UDP-Xyl in mammalian cells. This conclusion was supported by the fact that cytoplasmically expressed UXS inhibited UDP-GlcA production, but less efficiently than the luminally expressed enzyme. The lower inhibition of cytUXS might be explained by differences in the rate of production of UDP-xylose or by other mechanisms. More data are needed for a conclusive interpretation of this interesting finding. Although, we cannot exclude the possibility that a small portion of UDP-Xyl is produced in the cytoplasm, it seems more likely that UDP-Xyl generated in the Golgi/ER is transported to the cytoplasm to inhibit UGDH. This assumption is supported by observations of Bossuyt and Blanckaert (48Bossuyt X. Blanckaert N. J. Hepatol.. 2001; 34: 210-214Google Scholar) that show that luminal UDP-Xyl stimulates uptake of UDP-GlcA into ER vesicles, possibly by providing an antiport substrate, suggesting the existence of a UDP-GlcA/UDP-Xyl antiporter in the ER membrane. Transport of UDP-Xyl in the other direction, into the ER/Golgi lumen, has also been shown by transport of UDP-Xyl into isolated microsomes (44Nuwayhid N. Glaser J.H. Johnson J.C. Conrad H.E. Hauser S.C. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem.. 1986; 261: 12936-12941Google Scholar) or by incorporation of xylose from UDP-[14C]Xyl in permeabilized cells (27Kearns A.E. Vertel B.M. Schwartz N.B. J. Biol. Chem.. 1993; 268: 11097-11104Google Scholar). Such a function could be provided by SLC35B4, a recently identified UDP-Xyl transporter of the Golgi (29Ashikov A. Routier F. Fuhlrott J. Helmus Y. Wild M. Gerardy-Schahn R. Bakker H. J. Biol. Chem.. 2005; 280: 27230-27235Google Scholar). According to our results, UDP-Xyl is indeed transported into the Golgi/ER network, since cytosolic UXS allowed the formation of GAGs and xylosylation of N-glycans in the mutant. Thus, UDP-Xyl appears to be transported in both directions across the ER/Golgi membrane. The exact localization of all proteins in this pathway is not completely resolved. The proteoglycan xylosyltransferases have been shown to be Golgi-localized (49Schön S. Prante C. Bahr C. Kuhn J. Kleesiek K. Götting C. J. Biol. Chem.. 2006; 281: 14224-14231Google Scholar), but evidence exists for co-translational xylosylation (50Geetha-Habib M. Campbell S.C. Schwartz N.B. J. Biol. Chem.. 1984; 259: 7300-7310Google Scholar). Although evidence has been presented for UXS in the Golgi (28Moriarity J.L. Hurt K.J. Resnick A.C. Storm P.B. Laroy W. Schnaar R.L. Snyder S.H. J. Biol. Chem.. 2002; 277: 16968-16975Google Scholar), our tagged constructs appear only in the ER. 4H. Bakker, T. Oka, A. Ashikov, A. Yadav, M. Berger, N. A. Rana, X. Bai, Y. Jigami, R. S. Haltiwanger, J. D. Esko, and R. Gerardy-Schahn, unpublished results. The ER and Golgi are also not uniform structures, and production and consumption of UDP-Xyl can take place at different subcellular locations. Whether most of the luminally produced UDP-Xyl is directly used in xylosylation reactions or is transported out of the ER or Golgi and back into the Golgi lumen remains unsolved. Methods to decrease the expression of different potential transporters in this process could provide insight into this problem. Although a salvage pathway for the regeneration of xylose is anticipated in plants (51Kotake T. Yamaguchi D. Ohzono H. Hojo S. Kaneko S. Ishida H.K. Tsumuraya Y. J. Biol. Chem.. 2004; 279: 45728-45736Google Scholar), no indication for its occurrence exists in mammalian cells. Feeding of CHO cells with xylose did not restore the mutant phenotype of pgsI-208. Furthermore, auxotrophic mutants dependent on exogenous xylose have not been identified in screening mutagenized cells. No ortholog of the plant enzyme (51Kotake T. Yamaguchi D. Ohzono H. Hojo S. Kaneko S. Ishida H.K. Tsumuraya Y. J. Biol. Chem.. 2004; 279: 45728-45736Google Scholar) that is able to biosynthesize UDP-Xyl from xylose-1-phosphate is found in mammalian genomes. The pathway via UDP-GlcA, catalyzed by UXS, therefore, appears to be the only way to generate UDP-Xyl in CHO cells and probably all mammals. We thank Gerdy ten Dam and T. van Kuppevelt (University of Nijmegen, The Netherlands) for kindly providing antibody RB4Ea12 and Detlef Neumann (Medizinische Hochschule Hannover, Germany) for help with flow cytometry."
https://openalex.org/W2130077303,"Neuropeptide modulation of immune cell function is an important mechanism of neuro-immune intersystem crosstalk. Substance P (SP) is one such key neuropeptide involved. In this study, we investigated the yet unexplored cellular mechanisms of SP-mediated inflammatory responses in macrophages using a mouse macrophage-like cell line RAW 264.7 and isolated peritoneal macrophages. We found that the conventional PKCalpha and novel PKCdelta and epsilon were selectively activated by SP via its primary neurokinin-1 receptor (NK-1R) on the cells. Activation of these PKC isoforms mediated the activation of downstream extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 (ERK1/2) and the transcription factor NF-kappaB, which drove the transcription of inducible chemokines in macrophages. Additionally, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt was also activated by SP/NK-1R in macrophages. Inhibition of PI3K-Akt pathway attenuated ERK1/2 and NF-kappaB activation, suggesting it also played a part in SP-induced cellular inflammatory response. Kinetic analysis indicated that PKC isoforms induced early ERK1/2 activation, while PI3K-Akt contributed to the pathway at later time points. It was further demonstrated that PKC and PI3K-Akt were activated independent of each other. Collectively, our results suggest that SP/NK-1R activates two convergent proinflammatory signaling pathways, PKCs and PI3K-Akt, resulting in ERK1/2 and NF-kappaB activation and chemokine production in mouse macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W2055437256,"Beneficial effects of low glycemic index (GI) diets in rodents have been studied using healthy low-fat diets, while the effects might be different on high-fat diets inducing progression of insulin resistance. We fed C57BL/6J male mice high-fat low/high-GI (LGI/HGI) diets for 13 wk. Glucose and insulin tolerance and serum substrates, including adipokines, were measured longitudinally. The LGI group showed a significantly higher glucose tolerance from wk 2 onwards, which was supported by lower serum insulin and free fatty acids levels at 8 wk, and a tendency for lower leptin levels, while resistin levels remained similar. At 11 wk, when differences in serum resistin started to increase, differences in serum insulin were diminished. Although food intake was similar throughout the study, body weights and epididymal adipose tissue mass became significantly lower in the LGI group at necropsy. Several serum substrates and adipose tissue leptin mRNA levels, as analyzed by Q-PCR, were, again, significantly lower, whereas adiponectin mRNA levels were higher. Taken together, an LGI high-fat diet maintains higher glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity via adipose tissue modulation solely because of a difference in the type of carbohydrate, supporting a nutritional approach in the fight against insulin resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2005207523,"The pro-arrhythmic Long QT syndrome (LQT) is linked to 10 different genes (LQT1–10). Approximately 40% of genotype-positive LQT patients have LQT2, which is characterized by mutations in the human ether-a-go-go related gene (hERG). hERG encodes the voltage-gated K+ channel α-subunits that form the pore of the rapidly activating delayed rectifier K+ current in the heart. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the mechanisms that regulate the intracellular transport or trafficking of hERG, because trafficking is impaired for about 90% of LQT2 missense mutations. Protein trafficking is regulated by small GTPases. To identify the small GTPases that are critical for hERG trafficking, we coexpressed hERG and dominant negative (DN) GTPase mutations in HEK293 cells. The GTPases Sar1 and ARF1 regulate the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) export of proteins in COPII and COPI vesicles, respectively. Expression of DN Sar1 inhibited the Golgi processing of hERG, decreased hERG current (IhERG) by 85% (n ≥ 8 cells per group, *, p < 0.01), and reduced the plasmalemmal staining of hERG. The coexpression of DN ARF1 had relatively small effects on hERG trafficking. Surprisingly, the coexpression of DN Rab11B, which regulates the endosomal recycling, inhibited the Golgi processing of hERG, decreased IhERG by 79% (n ≥ 8 cells per group; *, p < 0.01), and reduced the plasmalemmal staining of hERG. These data suggest that hERG undergoes ER export in COPII vesicles and endosomal recycling prior to being processed in the Golgi. We conclude that hERG trafficking involves a pathway between the ER and endosomal compartments that influences expression in the plasmalemma.

Hundreds of hERG mutations are linked to the congenital pro-arrhythmic Type 2 Long QT syndrome (LQT2) and functional studies suggest that these mutations result in a loss of normal hERG K+ channel (hERG) function (4Zhou Z. Gong Q. Epstein M.L. January C.T. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 21061-21066Google Scholar, 5Delisle B.P. Anson B.D. Rajamani S. January C.T. Circ. Res... 2004; 94: 1418-1428Google Scholar). In LQT2, missense mutations are the dominant abnormality and many LQT2 missense mutations reduce hERG K+ current (IhERG) by decreasing the intracellular transport or trafficking of hERG to the Golgi apparatus (Golgi) and the cell surface membrane (plasmalemma) (6Anderson C.L. Delisle B.P. Anson B.D. Kilby J.A. Will M.L. Tester D.J. Gong Q. Zhou Z. Ackerman M.J. January C.T. Circulation.. 2006; 113: 365-373Google Scholar). Therefore, disruption of hERG K+ channel trafficking appears to be a principal mechanism for disease. Movement of proteins between membrane-bound intracellular compartments is mediated by small transport vesicles, which bud from a donor compartment to fuse with an appropriate acceptor compartment. The trafficking of many transmembrane and secretory proteins between the ER and Golgi compartments is dependent on the small GTPases ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (ARF1) and Sar1, which regulate the formation of coat-associated protein complex I (COPI) and II (COPII) vesicles, respectively (7Barlowe C. d'Enfert C.

Vesicular cargo selection, docking, and fusion to the target membrane are regulated by adaptor proteins, SNARE proteins, and Rab GTPases. To rationally develop novel therapeutic targets that may increase the expression of trafficking-deficient LQT2 mutant channels, the molecular mechanisms that regulate the trafficking of hERG need to be explored. The purpose of this study is to identify transport proteins that regulate the trafficking of wild type (WT) hERG. We used a strategy of testing specific WT GTPases or ones containing dominant negative (DN) mutations to interfere with their function. Human Heart cDNA Library and Cloning—Polymerase chain reaction primers were designed to clone Sar1, ARF1, Rab6A, and Rab6B based on the published cDNA (NCBI accession NM_020150, NM_001024227, and NM_002869). Oligonucleotide primers were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT, Coralville, IA). Polymerase chain reactions contained 5.0 μl of total DNA from the reverse transcription reaction of human heart as template, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm (NH4)2SO4, 2.0 mm MgSO4, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2.0 μm each dATP, dCTP, dGTP, dTTP, 75 pmol of each primer, 5 units of Taq Extender Additive (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), 25 units of TaqDNA Polymerase (Fisher Scientific). PCR reactions were initially denatured at 94 °C for 3 min, they were cycled at 94 °C for 45 s, 55 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 2 min 45 times, followed by 72 °C for 7 min. Amplified cDNA fragments were analyzed by 0.75–1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized by ethidium bromide staining under UV light. Each fragment was purified from the agarose gel using the QIAquick Gel Extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). cDNA fragments were cloned into pcDNA 3.1-V5-polyhistidine vectors using the TOPO TA Cloning method (Invitrogen) as previously described (20Foell J.D.

Cloned RT-PCR fragments were sequenced and analyzed by the University of Wisconsin Biotechnology Center, Madison, WI. Other Rab transcripts were purchased from Origene (Rockville, MD) or GeneCopoeia, Inc. (Germantown, MD). These cDNAs were sequenced and subcloned into the pcDNA 3.1-V5-polyhistidine expression vectors.

The Sar1 and H79G-Sar1 clones were modified to include the polyhistidine tag –ASHHHHHH (WT-Sar1-His and H79G-Sar1-His) at the C terminus of the translated protein. The addition of the polyhistidine tag did not alter the effect of coexpressing Sar1 or H79G-Sar1 (data not shown). The integrity of all the constructs was verified by DNA sequencing (University of Wisconsin-Madison, Biotechnology Center). Cell Lines and Drug Exposure—Expression of hERG and the WT or mutant Sar1, ARF1, Rab6A, Rab6B, Rab11A, or Rab11B constructs was performed by transiently transfecting 1.5 μgof hERG cDNA and 1.5 μg of Sar1, ARF1, Rab6A, Rab6B, Rab11A, or Rab11B cDNA using Superfect (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). For control conditions, cells were transfected with 1.5 μg of hERG cDNA and 1.5 μg of the pcDNA3 vector without cDNA subcloned into the vector (blank vector). The cells were cultured in MEM (with 10% fetal bovine serum) at 37 °C and analyzed 48 h after transfection. In some experiments, cells were also transfected with cDNA encoding Kir2.1 (kindly provided by Dr. Jonathan Makielski, University of Wisconsin-Madison) or vesicular stomatitis virus ts045 G (VSVG) protein fused to GFP (VSVG-GFP, kindly provided by Dr. Jennifer Lippincott-Schwartz from the National Institutes of Health) (28Eckhardt L.L.

Lippincott-Schwartz J. Nature.. 1997; 389: 81-85Google Scholar). For VSVG-GFP experiments 1 μg of hERG, 1 μg of ARF1, or Q71L-ARF1, and 1 μg of VSVG-GFP cDNA were transiently transfected using Superfect. VSVG is a transmembrane glycoprotein that is often used to study protein trafficking. The trafficking of VSVG is temperature-sensitive, so to facilitate the trafficking of VSVG-GFP out of the ER the cells were cultured in MEM at 32 °C for 12 h prior to analyses. Electrophysiology—IhERG or Kir2.1 current (IKir2.1) were measured using the whole-cell patch clamp technique as described previously (30Zhou Z. Gong Q. Ye B. Fan Z. Makielski J.C. Robertson G.A. January C.T. Biophys. J... 1998; 74: 230-241Google Scholar, 31Zhou Z. Gong Q. January C.T. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 31123-31126Google Scholar). The extracellular (bath) solution contained (in mm) 137 NaCl, 4 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2,10 glucose, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.4 with NaOH), and the intracellular pipette solution contained (in mm) 130 KCl, 1 MgCl2,5 EGTA, 5 MgATP, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.2 with KOH). For experiments using hERG expression, the holding potential was –80 mV, and the baseline (zero current) is indicated as a dotted line in the figures. The cells were depolarized to 50 mV for 3 s to maximally activate IhERG, followed by a test-pulse to –120 mV for 3 s to measure the peak tail IhERG. For experiments using Kir2.1 expression, the holding potential was –60 mV, and cells were pulsed from –120 mV to 50 mV for 1 s in 10-mV increments. All voltage clamp experiments were performed at 22–23 °C within 1–2 h after removing the cells from their culture conditions. IhERG and IKir2.1 were normalized to cellular capacitance. The relative IhERG was calculated by dividing IhERG and the corresponding standard error (S.E.) with the mean IhERG in control conditions. The relative IKir2.1 was calculated similarly by using the mean IKir2.1 measured at –120 mV in control conditions. Voltage protocols and data analyses were done using the pCLAMP 8.0 (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA) and Origin (6.0 and 7.5, Microcal, North Hampton, MA) computer software. Western Blot—The Western blot procedure for hERG was previously described (30Zhou Z. Gong Q. Ye B. Fan Z. Makielski J.C. Robertson G.A. January C.T. Biophys. J... 1998; 74: 230-241Google Scholar), and the procedure that was used for Western analyses of polyhistidine-tagged Sar1 proteins was done similarly. Briefly, whole cell lysates of similarly confluent cultures were generated by solubilizing cells in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mm EDTA, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). Equal amounts of protein and Laemmli buffer with a final [DTT] of 100 mm were mixed and heated for 10 min at 60 °C and subjected to 6.5% or 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by electrophoretic transfer onto nitrocellulose membranes. Nitrocellulose membranes were incubated overnight with an anti-hERG antibody directed against the C terminus (31Zhou Z. Gong Q. January C.T. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 31123-31126Google Scholar) or an anti-polyhistidine antibody (Invitrogen). After washing off the anti-hERG or anti-polyhistidine antibodies the membranes were then incubated in anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase-linked antibody (Amersham Biosciences) or anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase-linked antibody (Bio-Rad). The horseradish peroxidase-linked antibodies were detected using the ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Immunocytochemistry and Confocal Imaging—The labeling of hERG for single labeling experiments was performed as described previously (32Delisle B.P. Anderson C.L. Balijepalli R.C. Anson B.D. Kamp T.J. January C.T. J. Biol. Chem... 2003; 278: 35749-35754Google Scholar). For double labeling experiments HEK293 cells were plated in 35-mm Petri dishes containing collagen-coated coverslips. Cells were fixed with 4% buffered paraformaldehyde for 10 min, permeabilized with Triton X-100 (0.1%) for 10 min, and rinsed in 0.75% glycine buffer for 10 min to quench residual background aldehyde signal. Cells were then incubated with 2 ml of blocking solution (10% goat serum, 0.05% NaN3 in PBS) for 1 h to block nonspecific binding sites, and the cells were subsequently incubated with the anti-hERG and anti-polyhistidine (Invitrogen) antibodies in 10% goat serum (Invitrogen) in PBS at room temperature. Excess antibody was washed off with three 10-min long rinses of blocking solution. The cells were then incubated with Highly Cross-absorbed Alexa Fluor 568 Goat Anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) antibody (1:5000; Inc. 2 mg/ml) (Invitrogen) and the Highly Cross absorbed Alexa Fluor 488 Goat Anti-mouse IgG (H+L) antibody (1:500, 2 mg/ml) (Invitrogen) in the blocking solution. The cells were washed for four 10-min-long treatments with blocking solution alone. After the final wash, the coverslips bearing the stained cells were mounted on slides in 50% glycerol in PBS. Imaging was performed with a Bio-Rad MRC 1024 laser scanning confocal microscope equipped with a mixed gas (Ar/Kr) laser operated by 24-bit Lasersharp software. Z-scan sections were taken at 0.5 μm. Data are shown as a single z-scan image or as a series of stacked z-scan images (20–25 sections) to yield three-dimensional images. Live Cell Western Technique—Nontransfected HEK293 cells or cells expressing hERG and WT or mutant small GTPases (H79G-Sar1, Q71L-ARF1, N124I-Rab11A, or N124I-Rab11B) were plated into collagen-coated 24-well tissue culture plates and cultured overnight. For imaging, the cell culture media (MEM with 10% fetal bovine serum) was supplemented for 1 h with a primary hERG antibody (Alomone Labs, Jerusalem, Israel) that recognizes an extracellular epitope in S1-S2 (1:100) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The cells were washed for 10 min three times with cell culture media at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The cells were then cultured for 1 h in the secondary antibody IRDye 680 Goat Anti-Rabbit (1:10000) (Li-cor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Cells were then washed once in PBS for 10 min. The cells were imaged using the Li-cor Odyssey infrared imaging system (Li-cor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE) and the intensity of the 700-nm infrared signal for each well was quantified using the Li-cor Odyssey infrared imaging system software. The mean intensity of the wells that contain untransfected cells was subtracted from the intensity of cells expressing hERG K+ in control or with WT or DN GTPases to correct for any background signal not related to hERG staining. Statistics—Initially an ANOVA was performed on data sets (p < 0.05 was considered significant). In order to identify whether an experimental group(s) differed from control, we performed a Student's t-tests (p < 0.01 was considered significant). Sar1 Regulates the ER Export of hERG—The small GTPase Sar1 regulates the ER export of many transmembrane and secretory proteins in COPII vesicles. We tested the hypothesis that the trafficking of hERG is regulated by Sar1. We coexpressed hERG with WT or the DN Sar1 mutation, H79G, in HEK293 cells. The trafficking of hERG to the Golgi can be detected using Western blot because hERG is a glycoprotein; hERG subunits are synthesized as immature, core-glycosylated 135-kDa proteins in the ER, and undergo glycosylation in the Golgi (Golgi processing), which increases their MW to the mature, complexly glycosylated 155-kDa protein (4Zhou Z. Gong Q. Epstein M.L. January C.T. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 21061-21066Google Scholar, 30Zhou Z. Gong Q. Ye B. Fan Z. Makielski J.C. Robertson G.A. January C.T. Biophys.

The mature subunits are predominately expressed at the plasmalemma, because the 155-kDa protein band visualized on Western blot is degraded by the extracellular application of serine proteases to intact cells (33Rajamani S. Anderson C.L. Valdivia C.R. Eckhardt L.L. Foell J.D. Robertson G.A. Kamp T.J. Makielski J.C. Anson B.D. January C.T. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ Physiol... 2006; 290: H1278-H1288Google Scholar). Fig. 1A shows representative Western blot analysis of lysates from cells transiently expressing hERG in control conditions, with Sar1-His, or with H79G-Sar1-His (n = 4). For control conditions, cells were transfected with 1.5 μg of hERG cDNA and 1.5 μg of the blank vector. Expression of hERG and WT or mutant Sar1, was performed by transiently transfecting 1.5 μg of hERG cDNA and 1.5 μg of Sar1-His or H79G-Sar1-His cDNA. In control lysates and lysates isolated from cells expressing Sar1-His, the immature (135 kDa) and mature (155 kDa) hERG subunit bands are present (top blot). Cells expressing H79G-Sar1-His lack the mature hERG subunit band, suggesting that the expression of H79G-Sar1-His prevents the trafficking of hERG to the Golgi. Fig. 1A also shows the corresponding Sar1-His or H79G-Sar1-His protein bands that were detected using an anti-polyhistidine antibody (bottom blot). We measured the expression of hERG at the plasmalemma using the whole cell patch clamp technique to record IhERG. Cells were pre-pulsed from a holding potential of –80 mV to 50 mV for 3 s to maximally activate hERG and then we applied a test pulse to –120 mV to measure the corresponding inward tail IhERG (32Delisle B.P. Anderson C.L. Balijepalli R.C. Anson B.D. Kamp T.J. January C.T. J. Biol. Chem... 2003; 278: 35749-35754Google Scholar). Fig. 1B shows representative IhERG measurements from cells expressing hERG in control conditions and from cells expressing Sar1-His or H79G-Sar1-His. The graph in Fig. 1C shows the IhERG normalized to the mean peak tail IhERG calculated from control cells (relative IhERG). Expression of H79G-Sar1-His caused an 85% reduction in the peak tail IhERG (n ≥ 8 cells per group; *, p < 0.01). These data demonstrate that H79G-Sar1-His inhibits the functional expression of WT hERG. To further explore the effect that H79G-Sar1-His has on hERG trafficking we used confocal microscopy to image cells transiently expressing hERG and Sar1-His (Fig. 2A) or H79G-Sar1-His (Fig. 2B). The top rows in Fig. 2, A and B show representative Z-scan confocal images through the middle of cells, and the bottom rows in Fig. 2, A and B show the corresponding series of superimposed Z-scan images taken from the top to the bottom of cells at 0.5-μm sections (n > 8 cells per group) to generate a pseudo three-dimensional image. The first column shows cells stained using the anti-hERG antibody (red), the second column shows the same cells stained using the anti-polyhistidine antibody (green) to label the tagged Sar1 proteins, and the third column shows the merged images (yellow demonstrates overlapped staining). Cells expressing hERG plus Sar1-His show hERG staining on the peripheral border of the cells, whereas cells expressing H79G-Sar1-His decreased hERG staining at the cell periphery and increased staining inside the cell. These data suggest that DN Sar1 inhibits the trafficking of hERG, and they are consistent with the hypothesis that the ER export of hERG is dependent on Sar1/COPII vesicular transport. DN ARF1 Has Small Effects on hERG Trafficking—Simplified models of protein trafficking suggest that proteins that undergo ER export are transported to pre-Golgi compartments in COPII vesicles and then are transported to the Golgi in COPI vesicles. The small GTPase ARF1 regulates the trafficking of COPI vesicles and DN ARF1 inhibits the transport of proteins in COPI vesicles. We tested the hypothesis that the trafficking of hERG is dependent on ARF1. Fig. 3A shows representative Western blot analysis (n = 4) of hERG from control cells or from cells cotransfected with DN Q71L-ARF1. Immunoblots of the cell lysates demonstrate the presence of both the immature and mature hERG subunit bands, suggesting that Q71L-ARF1 does not completely disrupt Golgi processing of hERG. Fig. 3B shows representative whole-cell tail IhERG traces recorded from control cells or from cells coexpressing ARF1 or Q71L-ARF1 measured using the same protocol as in Fig. 1. Fig. 3C shows that there was a 40% decrease in the relative IhERG measured from cells expressing Q71L-ARF1 (n = 6–14 cells per group; #, p = 0.05). The results in Fig. 3 show that the effect of coexpressing DN Q71L-ARF1 is relatively small when compared with DN Sar1 (Fig. 1). This may be due to a weak DN effect by Q71L-ARF1. We tested whether Q71L-ARF1 altered the subcellular localization of VSVG protein. Dascher and Balch (23Dascher C. Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem... 1994; 269: 1437-1448Google Scholar) previously demonstrated that coexpression of Q71L-ARF1 causes VSVG to distribute in a perinuclear region. Fig. 4A shows confocal data of a representative cell expressing hERG and VSVG-GFP with ARF1, and Fig. 4B shows a representative cell expressing hERG and VSVG-GFP with Q71L-ARF1. The top rows in Fig. 4, A and B show representative Z-scan images through the middle of the cells, and the corresponding bottom rows in Fig. 4, A and B show the series of superimposed Z-scan images taken from the top to the bottom of cells at 0.5-μm sections. The first column shows anti-hERG staining in red, the second column shows VSVG-GFP fluorescence in green, and the third column shows the merged images of hERG staining and VSVG-GFP fluorescence with overlap shown in yellow. Expression of Q71L-ARF1 caused VSVG-GFP to distribute in a restricted perinuclear region similar to that previously reported (23Dascher C. Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem... 1994; 269: 1437-1448Google Scholar). The intracellular staining of the hERG also appeared to slightly increase, but the relative effect that Q71L-ARF1 had on the subcellular localization of hERG staining was less dramatic than VSVG-GFP. We conclude that hERG trafficking may be weakly regulated by ARF1, and ARF1 differentially regulates the trafficking of hERG and VSVG-GFP proteins. Rab11B Regulates the Trafficking of hERG to the Golgi and Plasmalemma—The results in Figs. 1 and 3 are qualitatively similar to previous findings for the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) Cl– channel (27Yoo J.S. Moyer B.D. Bannykh S. Yoo H.M. Riordan J.R. Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem... 2002; 277: 11401-11409Google Scholar). These data suggested that the Golgi processing of CFTR Cl– channels is more sensitive to DN Sar1 compared with DN ARF1. Yoo et al. found that the Golgi processing of CFTR Cl– channels is inhibited by a DN Rab that regulates endosomal recycling. Their results are surprising because they suggest that CFTR may traffic to endosomes prior to their processing in the Golgi. This contradicts conventional models of membrane protein trafficking, whereby proteins traffic from the ER, to the Pre-Golgi/Golgi, and ultimately the plasmalemma. Because the relatively small effect of DN ARF1 on CFTR Cl– channels and hERG is similar, we speculated that the trafficking of hERG may also depend on Rabs that regulate endosomal trafficking/recycling. Both Rab6 and Rab11 regulate endosomal recycling (34Goud B. Yang C. Roa M. Martinez O. Mayau V. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci... 1994; 710: 192-195Google Scholar, 35Ullrich O. Reinsch S. Urbe S. Zerial M.

Cell.. 1999; 10: 47-61Google Scholar). There are two isoforms of Rab 6 (Rab6A and Rab6B) and two isoforms of Rab11 (Rab11A and Rab11B). The coexpression of WT or the DN mutations Q72L-Rab6A or the Q72L-Rab6B did not alter the Golgi processing of hERG subunits or the functional expression of hERG compared with control (Western blot and IhERG, data not shown). Similarly, expression of hERG with WT Rab11A or Rab11B did not alter the Golgi processing of hERG subunits or the functional expression of hERG compared with control (Western blot and IhERG, data not shown). However, DN Rab11B inhibited hERG trafficking. Fig. 5A shows representative Western blot analysis (n = 4) from cells transiently expressing WT hERG in control conditions, and coexpressing with the DN mutations N124I-Rab11A or N124I-Rab11B. Cells expressing N124I-Rab11B, but not N124I-Rab11A, inhibited formation of the mature hERG subunit band. Fig. 5B shows representative whole-cell IhERG traces from control cells or from cells expressing N124I-Rab11A or N124I-Rab11B. Fig. 5C shows the relative IhERG measured from control cells or cells expressing N124I-Rab11A or N124I-Rab11B. Expression of N124I-Rab11B caused a 79% reduction in the mean peak tail IhERG compared with control cells (n ≥ 6 cells per group; *, p < 0.01). The mean peak tail IhERG measurements for cells expressing N124I-Rab11A were not different from control (p > 0.01). Our results suggest that Rab11B, but not Rab11A, regulates the trafficking of hERG to the Golgi and plasmalemma. We further explored the effect that Rab11B had on the trafficking of hERG by coexpressing a different DN Rab11B mutation, S25N, which was modified to contain GFP at its N terminus (S25N-Rab11B-GFP) (31Zhou Z. Gong Q. January C.T. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 31123-31126Google Scholar). This fusion protein was previously shown to inhibit the recycli"
https://openalex.org/W2142118171,"O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) suppresses mutations and cell death that result from alkylation damage. MGMT expression is lost by epigenetic silencing in a variety of human cancers including nearly half of sporadic colorectal cancers, suggesting that this loss maybe causal. Using mice with a targeted disruption of the Mgmt gene, we tested whether Mgmt protects against azoxymethane (AOM)-induced colonic aberrant crypt foci (ACF), against AOM and dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colorectal adenomas and against spontaneous intestinal adenomas in ApcMin mice. We also examined the genetic interaction of the Mgmt null gene with a DNA mismatch repair null gene, namely Msh6. Both Mgmt and Msh6 independently suppress AOM-induced ACF, and combination of the two mutant alleles had a multiplicative effect. This synergism can be explained entirely by the suppression of alkylation-induced apoptosis when Msh6 is absent. In addition, following AOM+DSS treatment Mgmt protected against adenoma formation to the same degree as it protected against AOM-induced ACF formation. Finally, Mgmt deficiency did not affect spontaneous intestinal adenoma development in ApcMin/+ mice, suggesting that Mgmt suppresses intestinal cancer associated with exogenous alkylating agents, and that endogenous alkylation does not contribute to the rapid tumor development seen in ApcMin/+ mice."
https://openalex.org/W1968773176,"Dendritic cells play a key role in the adaptive immune system by influencing T-cell differentiation. Annexin-1 (Anx-A1) has recently been shown to modulate the adaptive immune response by regulating T-cell activation and differentiation. Here we investigated the role of endogenous Anx-A1 in dendritic cells as major cellular counterpart of T-cell-driven immune response. We found that Anx-A1(-/-) bone marrow-derived dendritic cells show an increased number of CD11c(+) cells expressing high levels of some maturation markers, such as CD40, CD54, and CD80, coupled to a decreased capacity to take up antigen compared to control Anx-A1(+/+) cells. However, analysis of LPS-treated dendritic cells from Anx-A1(-/-) mice demonstrated a diminished up-regulation of maturation markers, a decreased migratory activity in vivo, and an attenuated production of the inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1beta, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and IL-12. This defect was also accompanied by impaired nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB/DNA-binding activity and lack of Anx-A1 signaling, as demonstrated by the reduced activation of extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 and Akt compared to cells from control littermates. As a consequence of this phenotype, Anx-A1(-/-) dendritic cells showed an impaired capacity to stimulate T-cell proliferation and differentiation in mixed leukocyte reaction. Together, these findings suggest that inhibition of Anx-A1 expression or function in dendritic cells might represent a useful way to modulate the adaptive immune response and pathogen-induced T-cell-driven immune diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2041571596,"Patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia arising from mutations of 11β-hydroxylase, the final enzyme in the glucocorticoid biosynthetic pathway, exhibit glucocorticoid deficiency, adrenal hyperplasia driven by unsuppressed hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal activity, and excess mineralocorticoid activity caused by the accumulation of deoxycorticosterone. A mouse model, in which exons 3-7 of Cyp11b1 (the gene encoding 11β-hydroxylase) were replaced with cDNA encoding enhanced cyan fluorescent protein, was generated to investigate the underlying disease mechanisms. Enhanced cyan fluorescent protein was expressed appropriately in the zona fasciculata of the adrenal gland, and targeted knock-out was confirmed by urinary steroid profiles and, immunocytochemically, by the absence of 11β-hydroxylase. The null mice exhibited glucocorticoid deficiency, mineralocorticoid excess, adrenal hyperplasia, mild hypertension, and hypokalemia. They also displayed glucose intolerance. Because rodents do not synthesize adrenal androgens, changes in reproductive function such as genital virilization of females were not anticipated. However, adult homozygote females were infertile, their ovaries showing an absence of corpora lutea and a central proliferation of disorganized steroidogenic tissue. Null females responded normally to superovulation, suggesting that raised systemic progesterone levels also contribute to infertility problems. The model reveals previously unrecognized phenotypic subtleties of congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia arising from mutations of 11β-hydroxylase, the final enzyme in the glucocorticoid biosynthetic pathway, exhibit glucocorticoid deficiency, adrenal hyperplasia driven by unsuppressed hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal activity, and excess mineralocorticoid activity caused by the accumulation of deoxycorticosterone.

Null females responded normally to superovulation, suggesting that raised systemic progesterone levels also contribute to infertility problems. The model reveals previously unrecognized phenotypic subtleties of congenital adrenal hyperplasia. The final steps leading to the production of glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids are undertaken by 11β-hydroxylase and aldosterone synthase, encoded by two closely linked genes, Cyp11b1 and Cyp11b2, respectively, that share 95% sequence homology. In rodents, the common substrate, deoxycorticosterone, is converted into the mineralocorticoid, aldosterone, in the adrenal zona glomerulosa by aldosterone synthase and into corticosterone, the main glucocorticoid, by 11β-hydroxylase in the zona fasiculata. Cortisol rather than corticosterone is the main glucocorticoid in humans because Cyp17 is expressed in the zona fasciculata. Unlike rodents, human adrenals produce significant amounts of the androgen dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). 2The abbreviations used are: DHEA, dehydroepiandrosterone; ECFP, enhanced cyan fluorescent protein; CAH, congenital adrenal hyperplasia; WT, wild type; ACTH, adrenocorticotropic hormone; RT, reverse transcription; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; GnRH, gonadotrophin releasing hormone; ES, embryonic stem; ANOVA, analysis of variance. Patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) have a markedly reduced capacity to produce glucocorticoids. In ∼90% of cases CAH is caused by deficiency of 21-hydroxylase, the penultimate enzyme in the pathways of both aldosterone and cortisol synthesis (1Speiser P.W. White P.C. N. Engl. J. Med.. 2003; 349: 776-788Google Scholar). In 8% of CAH cases, point mutations in or deletion of Cyp11b1 drastically reduce or completely destroy 11β-hydroxylase activity (2Krone N. Riepe F.G. Gotze D.

Clin. Endocrinol.. 2006; 65: 816-825Google Scholar). Adrenal hyperplasia is a consequence of increased ACTH secretion in the absence of normal negative feedback control by glucocorticoids of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis. In 21-hydroxylase-deficient patients, ACTH drives the production of progesterone and 17-hydroxyprogesterone and channels earlier 17-hydroxylated intermediates in the glucocorticoid pathway toward the synthesis of adrenal androgens. CAH due to 11β-hydroxylase deficiency causes increased synthesis of the 11-deoxycorticosteroids deoxycortisol and deoxycorticosterone (a weak mineralocorticoid) as well as increased adrenal androgen production. In all CAH patients, it is the raised adrenal androgen production in early development leading to premature puberty in males and ambiguous external female genitalia in females that is of greatest concern (5Cerame B.I. Newfield R.S. Pascoe L. Curnow K.M. Nimkarn S. Roe T.F. New M.I. Wilson R.C. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab.. 1999; 84: 3129-3134Google Scholar, 6Motaghedi R. Betensky B.P. Slowinska B. Cerame B.

Rodents, which do not synthesize adrenal androgens, allow us to study the equally pernicious effects of glucocorticoid deficiency, progesterone excess, and disturbances of mineralocorticoid hormone synthesis. Studies of mice carrying a severely mutated 21-hydoxylase gene have been useful but are limited by problems of viability because of the lack of both mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid hormones (8Riepe F.G. Tatzel S. Sippell W.G. Pleiss J. Krone N. Endocrinology.. 2005; 146: 2563-2574Google Scholar). In this study we have targeted Cyp11b1 in the expectation that, by preserving mineralocorticoid synthesis, mice will survive. The Cyp11b1 gene was replaced with a fluorescent reporter gene, and the resultant transgenic line was assessed for reduced 11β-hydroxylase activity and pathophysiologies associated with altered steroid hormone activity. We report anomalies in steroid hormone profiles, glucose tolerance, blood pressure, salt handling, and reproductive performance, and we suggest that the Cyp11b1 knock-out mouse represents a good model of CAH. Generation of 11β-Hydroxylase Null Mice—A BAC clone (ASBAC, a gift from Prof. K. Parker), which has a 125-kb insert and spans the entire Cyp11b2-Cyp11b1 locus, with ∼60 kb upstream and 45 kb downstream of the genes was used to produce the construct for subsequent generation of Cyp11b1 null mice. Specific targeting of the Cyp11b1 gene by replacing exons 3-7 with an IRES-ECFP cDNA and neomycin/kanomycin selection cassette, while leaving the Cyp11b2 gene untouched, was achieved through BAC recombineering (9Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Court D.L. Nat. Rev. Genet.. 2001; 2: 769-779Google Scholar, 10Liu P. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Genome Res.. 2003; 13: 476-484Google Scholar). The targeting construct contained an 11β-hydroxylase-specific, PCR-generated, 780-bp 5′ homology arm spanning exons 1-2 of Cyp11b1, and a 644-bp 3′ homology arm spanning exons 8 and 9 respectively. (PCR primers are given in Table 1.) The ex2rev primer was designed to place a STOP codon in all three reading frames. An IRES-ECFP cassette was positioned between the homology arms, placing its expression under the 11β-hydroxylase promoter. The ECFP reporter was directed to cell membranes by the addition of a 20-amino acid farnesylation signal (from H-ras) at the C-terminus, and a 10-amino acid c-Myc epitope (9E10) was placed at the N terminus. For selection of the targeting construct, a floxed Kan-neo cassette, driven by the PGK-em7 promoters (gift from Prof. N. Copeland), was placed downstream of the reporter cassette. All fragments generated by PCR were verified by sequencing. The construct was electroporated into strain DY380; colonies were selected using chloramphenicol plus kanomycin, and correct targeting was confirmed by PCR and Southern blot hybridization (using exon-specific probes).TABLE 1Primer and probe sequences for PCR and RT-PCRPrimers and probesHomology arm primersex1forGACATCAGAGTCGACGACAATGGCTCTCAGGGTGACAACAGex2revCAGACTTAATTAATTACATTCCAAGGGCATGCGGCAAGex8forGACTATCGGCCGTTCCCATAGACAGTCCTCAATGTGAATCTGex9revGATCAGCGGCCGCAGGCCATCCGCACATCCTCTTTCPCR screen primers11BWT forAGAGACCTTGAGGTAGGTGATGACTGC11BKO forTTGGCTGGACGTAAACTCCTCTTCA11B revGAACTGCCCAGTATTGTGACTATGCTACABAC1 forACAGATGCGTAAGGAGAAAATACBAC1 revCGCCCTATAGTGAGTCGTATTACBAC2 forGCACGACAGGTTTCCCGACTBAC2 revTAAATAGCTTGGCGTAATCATGGTCATART-PCR primers and probe11Bex3forATGGACTTTCAGTCCAGTGTGTTC1Bex4revGCCGCTCCCCAAAAAGAA11B34FAM probe6-FAM-TACCATAGAAGCTAGCC-MGB Open table in a new tab ES cells (E14TG2a, derived from mouse strain 129/Sv (11Hooper M. Hardy K. Handyside A. Hunter S. Monk M. Nature.. 1987; 326: 292-295Google Scholar)) were transfected with the Cyp11BKO construct by electroporation using a dual pulse (Easyject Plus Optipulse; pulse 1, 550 V, 25 microfarads, 481 ohms; interpulse delay, 0.00 s; pulse 2, 100 V, 1500 microfarads, 481 ohms). Clones incorporating the BAC DNA were isolated under neomycin selection. Homologous targeting was assessed by Southern blot hybridization (using a cDNA probe), and by using a panel of four PCRs to determine the presence of both the targeted and endogenous Cyp11b1 gene and the loss of flanking BAC vector sequences. (For primers see Table 1.) Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis and karyoptyping was performed in cell spreads to confirm that BAC DNA had integrated homologously. Breeding—Successful knock-out of the Cyp11b1 gene was achieved by homologous recombination in both bacteria (BAC recombineering) and 129/Sv-derived ES cells. Following injection of Cyp11b1 null ES cells into C57BL/6J blastocysts, chimeras capable of germ line transmission were backcrossed to C57BL/6J. All experiments described here were carried out on animals with a 75% C57Bl/6J, 25% 129/Sv genetic background. Because homozygous females were infertile, all homozygous progeny were generated by crossing male homozygotes with female heterozygotes. Phenotyping—All experimental animal studies were undertaken under UK Home Office license, following review by local ethics committee. Mice were maintained in a 12-h light-dark cycle (on at 07.00 h) under controlled conditions of humidity (50 ± 10%) and temperature (21 ± 2 °C) and fed standard mouse chow (SDS Ltd., Whitham, Essex, UK) and water ad libitum unless otherwise stated. Systolic blood pressure was measured by a tail cuff technique (12Evans A.L. Brown W. Kenyon C.J. Maxted K.J. Smith D.C. Med. Biol. Eng. Comput.. 1994; 32: 101-102Google Scholar) on at least three separate occasions. Data shown are the means ± S.E. of the average of the recordings for each animal. Prior to recording these values, mice were fully accustomed to the warming and restraint procedures that this method requires. Metabolic Cage Studies—Animals (minimum n = 5) were habituated to food containing 0.3% NaCl (SDS Ltd.) that was formulated as a gel to prevent food wastage (13Ahn D. Ge Y. Stricklett P.K. Gill P. Taylor D. Hughes A.K. Yanagisawa M. Miller L. Nelson R.D. Kohan D.E. J. Clin. Investig.. 2004; 114: 504-511Google Scholar). Mice were housed singly in metabolic cages (model 3600M021, Techniplas UK Ltd.). After acclimatization to the cages, body weight, food and water intake, and urine and fecal production were monitored daily over 4 consecutive days. Urine was collected and frozen for later analysis of steroid hormones and electrolytes. Steroid Profile Determination—Urine samples were analyzed for corticosterone, aldosterone, deoxycorticosterone, DHEA, and testosterone by in-house ELISAs using previously characterized specific antibodies (14Al-Dujaili E.A. Clin. Chim. Acta.. 2006; 364: 172-179Google Scholar, 15Al-Dujaili E.A. Edwards C.R. Clin. Chim. Acta.. 1981; 116: 277-287Google Scholar, 16Al-Dujaili E.A. Hubbard A.L. van Heyningen V. Edwards C.R.

Acta.. 2006; 364: 172-179Google Scholar). Urinary K+ and Na+ were determined by flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry and flame emission spectrophotometry, respectively, using a SpectrAA-300 spectrophotometer. Blood was collected by cardiac puncture into heparin-coated syringes and analyzed for plasma renin concentration, angiotensinogen, corticosteroids, triglycerides, and insulin as described previously (19Morton N.M. Densmore V. Wamil M. Ramage L. Nichol K. Bunger L. Seckl J.R. Kenyon C.J. Diabetes.. 2005; 54: 3371-3378Google Scholar). Plasma ACTH was measured by radioimmunoassay (MP Biomedicals, New York). Plasma electrolytes were analyzed using ion-selective electrodes (Electrolyte Analyzer, Roche Applied Science). Quantitative Real Time PCR Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from various tissues using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). The RNA was treated with DNA-free (Ambion), quantified by spectrophotometer, and its integrity confirmed on an agarose gel. 3 μg of RNA was reverse-transcribed, using the Superscript II first strand cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen), and the resultant cDNA was amplified by Taqman RT-PCR on the ABI Prism 7000 sequence detection system. Primers and probes were designed to be specific for endogenous Cyp11b1, spanning exons 3 and 4 (see Table 1). Reporter-specific primers and probes were used for RT-PCR of targeted Cyp11b1. Reactions were carried out in triplicate and normalized to 18 S for adrenal samples. Liver function was assessed by pre-optimized RT-PCR assays specific for phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (Pepck), tyrosine aminotransferase (Tat), and angiotensinogen (Agt) and pancreatic function by serum glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1 (Sgk1) assay and insulin (Ins2) assays. Values are reported as the ratio of target/TATA box-binding protein (Tbp) or wbscr1 (Williams Beuren syndrome chromosome region 1) mRNA and expressed in arbitrary units. Histology and Immunohistochemistry—Tissues were fixed in 4% normal buffered formalin, weighed, dehydrated, and embedded in paraffin. 6-Micrometer-thick sections were mounted on slides and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Adrenal sections were stained using anti-11β-hydroxylase (a kind gift of Celso Gomez-Sanchez) or anti-green fluorescent protein (mouse IgG2a monoclonal antibody, JL-8, BD Biosciences) as primary antibody and peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody. Whole heads were fixed in 4% normal buffered formalin, before careful dissection of the brain. Pituitary sections were immunostained using anti-ACTH primary antibody. Tissues of the male and female reproductive tracts were fixed for 5 h in Bouin's solution and then transferred to 70% ethanol. Immunostaining of ovary sections was carried out as described previously (20McNeilly J.R. Saunders P.T. Taggart M. Cranfield M. Cooke H.J. McNeilly A.S. Endocrinology.. 2000; 141: 4284-4294Google Scholar). To assess cell proliferation in ovaries of null mice, bromodeoxyuridine (Sigma; 0.1 mg/0.1 ml saline) was injected intraperitoneally 2 h before sacrifice. Fluorescence Microscopy—Tissues were removed and immediately snap-frozen in OCT embedding medium on dry ice. Frozen 10-μm sections were viewed directly using a confocal fluorescence microscope (Zeiss LSM 510 META). Glucose and Insulin Tolerance Tests—Glucose tolerance in male and female mice was assessed after a 5-h fast, in serial blood samples taken at 0, 30, 60, and 120 min following administration of glucose (2 g/kg body weight, intraperitoneally). Blood glucose was measured using a One-Touch Ultrasmart blood glucose meter (Lifespan Scotland Ltd.). Glucose tolerance tests were repeated in male mice before and after KCl had been administered in drinking water (1%) for 7 days. Insulin tolerance was determined in fasted animals by administering insulin intraperitoneally (1 unit/kg body weight Humulin S; Lilly, Basingstoke, Hampshire, UK) and measuring blood glucose at time intervals as described for the glucose tolerance test. Plasma insulin was measured using a commercial kit (mouse insulin ELISA kit, Crystal Chem Inc., Downers Grove, IL). Sgk and Ins2 mRNA levels were measured by real time RT-PCR in pancreatic tissues collected from male mice (see above). Statistics—Appropriate analyses were performed using Student's t tests and one-way or two-way ANOVA, as described in the text and figure legends, to determine statistical significance. Error bars in figures represent mean ± S.E. Generation of Knock-out Model—The targeting construct (Fig. 1a) was designed such that 11β-hydroxylase was insertionally inactivated by the replacement of exons 3-7 of Cyp11b1 with a gene encoding a fluorescent reporter (ECFP). Reporter expression was placed under the control of the endogenous Cyp11b1 promoter by virtue of the three-frame STOP-IRES motif, and sequence encoding a 20-amino acid farnesylation tail was included to anchor the resultant reporter to cell membranes. The floxed Kan-neo cassette was included for antibiotic selection in both bacterial cells (BAC recombineering) and mammalian cells (ES cell homologous recombination). BAC recombineering was used to specifically target the Cyp11b1 gene in a BAC containing both Cyp11b1 and the highly homologous Cyp11b2 gene, and demonstrated the fidelity of the homologous recombination system in Escherichia coli. The targeted BAC was subsequently introduced into E14TG2a ES cells (derived from the 129/Sv mouse) by electroporation. Correct targeting events were identified using a panel of four PCR screens for the presence of both endogenous and targeted Cyp11b1 and the absence of flanking BAC sequences. The possibility of additional random integration events was discounted by fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis. One chimera from each homologously targeted ES line was found to be capable of germ line transmission, resulting in the generation of two independent knock-out lines (designated LM1B and LM2B). Only experiments on line LM1B are described. Targeting—Fig. 1 summarizes functional data establishing that Cyp11b1 was successfully knocked out. Urinary steroid analysis showed that the main product of 11β-hydroxyase activity was reduced by 9.5- and 18-fold in homozygous males and females, respectively, compared with wild type mice, whereas the substrate, deoxycorticosterone, was dramatically increased by 27- and 44-fold (Fig. 1b). Steroid levels in urine collected from heterozygotes was not significantly different from those in wild type mice, although the ratio of deoxycorticosterone:corticosterone was significantly increased in males. Residual corticosterone in urine of null mice probably reflects the 11β-hydroxylase activity of aldosterone synthase. No Cyp11b1 mRNA was detected by real time RT-PCR in adrenals of homozygous null mice, which instead expressed high levels of reporter mRNA. Immunocytochemistry confirmed that the substitute ECFP transgene and not 11β-hydroxylase was expressed appropriately in the zona fasciculata of homozygote null mice and vice versa for wild type mice (Fig. 1c). As expected, a strong fluorescence signal of the farnesylated ECFP marker was detected in cell membranes of adrenals of null mice (Fig. 1d). The signal was weaker in heterozygotes and absent in wild type mice. Glucocorticoid Deficiency—Adrenal hypertrophy, the hallmark of CAH, was evident in homozygous null mice (Fig. 2a and Table 2). Histological examination indicated that the zona fasciculata is wider because of cell hypertrophy (Fig. 2b), although proliferation tests would be required to exclude simultaneous hyperplasia. A comparison of males and females indicated that female adrenals are generally larger but that adrenal hypertrophy of female null mice is less than males. These sex and genotypic differences in adrenal glands correspond to relative differences in urinary steroid secretion. We have confirmed that male Cyp11b1 null mice do not respond appropriately to restraint/handling stress with an increase in plasma corticosterone levels (Fig. 2c). The cause of CAH in patients is activation of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis because of the lack of negative feedback control. The pituitary glands of null mice appeared hypertrophied, and preliminary immunochemical evidence indicated increased numbers of corticotropes 3J. R. McNeilly, A. S. McNeilly, D. Brownstein, J. J. Mullins, L. J. Mullins, and C. J. Kenyon, unpublished data. reflecting stimulation of the HPA axis. Plasma ACTH values were higher (p < 0.001) in both male and female Cyp11b1 null mice compared with wild type controls (male, WT 468 ± 105, n = 9, cf. null 1639 ± 186 pg/ml, n = 14; female, 583 ± 68, n = 6, cf. 1119 ± 86 pg/ml, n = 6).TABLE 2Tissue weights of WT and null miceSex/genotypeAdrenalHeartLiverBrainKidneyMesenteric adiposeGonadal adiposeSubcutaneous adiposeBrown adiposemg/g bwtmg/g bwtmg/g bwtmg/g bwtmg/g bwtmg/g bwtmg/g bwtmg/g bwtmg/g bwtMale/null0.095 ± 0.017.15 ± 0.2156.0 ± 1.115.1 ± 0.57.51 ± .217.08 ± 0.7715.8 ± 1.911.3 ± 0.84.21 ± 0.33Male/WT0.033 ± 0.0045.90 ± 0.0845.6 ± 2.112.9 ± 0.76.10 ± 0.915.15 ± 2.48024.7 ± 2.715.51 ± 2.306.70 ± 0.48p value male0.0010.0010.0030.030.0010.020.030.020.005Female/null0.289 ± 0.0677.06 ± 0.5249.4 ± 2.7nm6.69 ± 0.466.56 ± 1.2132.8 ± 1.96.56 ± 1.212.58 ± 0.31Female/WT0.132 ± 0.015.90 ± 0.2740.5 ± 2.7nm6.68 ± 0.3314.46 ± 1.7132.2 ± 0.414.46 ± 1.713.39 ± 0.27p value female0.080.110.05nm1.00.0030.80.030.1p value all0.0040.020.02nm0.30.0010.020.020.003 Open table in a new tab Table 2 shows difference in weights of various tissues in proportion to body weight in null and wild type mice. Adipose tissue weights were generally reduced in null mice of both sexes consistent with the idea that glucocorticoids promote fat deposition. Interestingly, thymus weights, which are usually inversely correlated with glucocorticoid activity, were decreased rather than increased in males and were unaffected in females. The observed increase in brain mass is not an artifact caused by the reduced adiposity of null mice because differences were significant even when uncorrected for variations in body weight. Brain growth and development occur in late gestation and early postnatal life, with glucocorticoids signaling the end of cell proliferation. Increased brain mass in adult life could therefore reflect perinatal glucocorticoid deficiency. The kidney, another tissue whose growth is regulated by glucocorticoids, was increased in males but not females. The increased heart mass may reflect changes in blood pressure (see below). No change in angiotensinogen, phosphoenolpyruvate kinase, or tyrosine aminotransferase mRNA levels were observed in null animals by RT-PCR. Glucocorticoids are known to antagonize insulin actions and to inhibit insulin secretion. We therefore expected Cyp11b1 null mice to show increased clearance of plasma glucose following an intraperitoneal injection of glucose and a quicker response to insulin in fasted mice. However, responses to glucose tolerance tests were indistinguishable between null and wild type female mice, whereas male null mice were glucose-intolerant (Fig. 3, left, upper panel). Because the response to insulin injection was similar for both wild type and null animals (Fig. 3, left, lower panel), this indicated an impairment of insulin synthesis or secretion in Cyp11b1 null males. The expression of insulin by pancreatae of male mice was not affected by genotype (Ins2 mRNA, WT 1.26 ± 0.76; null 0.82 ± 0.64; not significant), but plasma insulin levels were reduced in male null mice (3.46 ± 1.7, cf. 1.74 ± 0.3 ng/ml; p < 0.05) with a similar trend in females (3.24 ± 1.51, cf. 1.09 ± 0.42 ng/ml; p = 0.14). These data suggest an inhibitory effect on insulin secretion. As recent studies indicate that serum glucocorticoid kinase (Sgk) mediates an inhibitory control of insulin secretion, via up-regulation of the K+ channel activity (21Ullrich S. Berchtold S. Ranta F. Seebohm G. Henke G. Lupescu A. Mack A.F. Chao C.M. Su J. Nitschke R. Alexander D. Friedrich B. Wulff P. Kuhl D. Lang F. Diabetes.. 2005; 54: 1090-1099Google Scholar, 22Ullrich S. Zhang Y. Avram D. Ranta F. Kuhl D. Haring H.U. Lang F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun.. 2007; 352: 662-667Google Scholar), we compared Sgk mRNA in pancreatic tissues from null and WT mice. Our expectation was that glucocorticoid deficiency would be suppressive, whereas excess mineralocorticoid activity (see below) might be stimulatory. However, no differences were observed (Sgk mRNA, WT 1.31 ± 0.42; null 1.12 ± 0.35). We then considered whether glucose intolerance was because of electrolyte imbalance in null mice caused by excess mineralocorticoid. A repeat glucose tolerance test on a second cohort of null mice confirmed the original observation. The provision of KCl in the drinking fluid for 7 days did improve glucose clearance but was equally effective in null and WT mice (Fig. 3, right). Excess Mineralocorticoid Activity—Deoxycorticosterone, a weak mineralocorticoid, was increased more than 30-fold in null males and females (Fig. 1b). This caused hypokalemia (Table 3) and suppression of the renin angiotensin system. Plasma renin concentration was lower in null male mice compared with controls (629 ± 170, cf. 141 ± 90 nmol of angiotensin 1·ml-1·h-1, p < 0.05) and plasma angiotensinogen was not significantly affected (290 ± 54, cf. 437 ± 42 nmol·ml-1, p < 0.1). Hypokalemia and renin suppression led to a decrease in normal levels of aldosterone (Table 5). Excess mineralocorticoid increased blood pressure, an effect that was more marked in females than males (Table 3). Urinary sodium and potassium excretions were not affected indicating that mice had already escaped from the sodium retaining actions of deoxycorticosterone (Table 4). Fluid turnover was greater in null mice, but this could be related to glucocorticoid deficiency rather than mineralocorticoid excess.TABLE 3Blood pressure and plasma electrolytesSex/genotypeSystolic blood pressurePlasma [Na+]Plasma [K+]Hematocritmm Hgmmmm%Male/null128.7 ± 4.5146.6 ± 3.96.42 ± 0.2947.3 ± 1.2Male/WT115.8 ± 4.7150.0 ± 1.27.36 ± 0.3647.4 ± 0.9p value male0.050.40.090.9Female/null136.9 ± 3.2146.7 ± 2.04.73 ± 0.1840.3 ± 0.4Female/WT113.0 ± 2.2145.0 ± 2.16.34 ± 0.2940.5 ± 1.4p value female0.0010.60.0010.9p value all0.0011.00.0030.8 Open table in a new tab TABLE 5Urinary steroid profilesSex/genotypeAldosteroneProgesteroneDHEATestosteronenmol/g bwtnmol/g bwtnmol/g bwtnmol/g bwtMale/null0.016 ± 0.0032.77 ± 0.7516.7 ± 4.25.21 ± 0.28Male/WT0.042 ± 0.010.77 ± 0.0810.7 ± 2.02.74 ± 0.4p value male0.020.010.30.01Female/null0.57 ± 0.081.27 ± 0.02132.3 ± 28.91.78 ± 0.38Female/WT2.51 ± 0.510.68 ± 0.1573.6 ± 28.00.96 ± 0.3p value female0.0010.010.30.03p value all0.020.010.30.03 Open table in a new tab TABLE 4Fluid balance and urinary electrolytesSex/genotypeFood intakeFluid intakeUrine volumeUrinary sodiumUrinary potassiumUrinary Na/Kg/g bwtml/g bwtml/g bwtμmol/g bwtμmol/g bwtMale/null0.13 ± 0.010.32 ± 0.030.15 ± 0.0211.9 ± 1.089.4 ± 0.91.26 ± 0.06Male/WT0.1 ± 0.010.18 ± 0.010.10 ± 0.018.3 ± 0.68.7 ± 0.90.99 ± 0.04p value male0.070.030.110.150.70.03Female/null0.17 ± 0.010.44 ± 0.040.22 ± 0.0315.5 ± 1.115.8 ± 1.31.02 ± 0.06Female/WT0.18 ± 0.020.31 ± 0.030.12 ± 0.0314.2 ± 0.618.1 ± 3.70.86 ± 0.07p value female0.70.050.050.50.60.13p value all0.90.010.010.130.70.01 Open table in a new tab Increased Androgen Activity—Mice express negligible amounts of adrenal 17-hydroxylase, so it is unclear why urinary testosterone was raised in both male and female null mice; DHEA was not significantly affected (Table 5).

Progesterone Excess—Male and female null mice showed increased urinary progesterone levels (Table 5), which appear to be of no phenotypic consequence in the fertile and viable males but may be responsible for the infertility observed in homozygous null females.

https://openalex.org/W2073781933,"MafA is a transcriptional regulator expressed primarily in pancreatic β cells. It binds to the RIPE3b/C1-binding site within the ins gene promoter, which plays a critical role in regulating ins gene expression in response to glucose. Here, we show that MafA is post-translationally modified by the small ubiquitin-related modifiers SUMO-1 and -2. Mutation of a single site in MafA, Lys32, blocks its sumoylation in β cells. Incubation of β cells in low glucose (2 mm) or exposure to hydrogen peroxide increases sumoylation of endogenous MafA. Forced sumoylation of MafA results in reduced transcriptional activity toward the ins gene promoter and increased suppression of the CHOP-10 gene promoter. Sumoylation of MafA has no apparent effect on either its nuclear localization in β cells or its ubiquitin-dependent degradation. This study suggests that modification of MafA by SUMO modulates gene transcription and thereby β cell function. MafA is a transcriptional regulator expressed primarily in pancreatic β cells.

Insulin is essential for maintaining glucose homeostasis and is synthesized in and secreted from β cells in the islets of Langerhans. Glucose-sensitive cis-regulatory elements on the ins gene promoter are critical in regulating ins gene expression (1German M. Ashcroft S. Docherty K. Edlund H. Edlund T. Goodison S. Imura H.

Several transcription factors have been identified that stimulate ins gene transcription through the A and E boxes of the promoter, including Pdx-1 and Beta2/NeuroD1, both MODY (maturity onset diabetes of the young) genes (2Malecki M.T. Diabetes Res. Clin. Pract.. 2005; 68: S10-S21Google Scholar). MafA also stimulates ins gene transcription by binding to the RIPE3b/C1 glucose-sensitive element, a Maf recognition element (MARE) 3The abbreviations used are: MARE, Maf recognition element; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HA, hemagglutinin.

MafA contains a transactivation domain at its N terminus and a DNA-binding domain at its C terminus and homodimerizes through its basic leucine zipper domain. Within pancreatic islets, mafA expression is limited to β cells and is involved in transcription not only of the ins gene but also of other genes involved in β cell-specific functions (9Aramata S. Han S.I. Kataoka K. Endocr. J... 2007; 54: 659-666Google Scholar). As might be expected for a regulator of ins gene transcription, MafA-deficient mice display glucose intolerance and develop diabetes, although impaired insulin secretion appears to be the primary defect (10Zhang C.

Additionally, islet structure is abnormal in these mice. Together, these findings indicate that MafA is required for the development and maintenance of mature insulin-producing pancreatic β cells. Both transcription and post-translational modifications have been implicated in the regulation of MafA under diverse conditions. Transient exposure of β cells to high glucose has been reported to both increase and decrease MafA mRNA and protein (11Zhao L. Guo M. Matsuoka T.A. Hagman D.K. Parazzoli S.D. Poitout V. Stein R. J.

Cell Metab... 2005; 2: 153-163Google Scholar). FoxA2, Nkx2.2, and Pdx-1 modulate mafA expression through conserved sequences in the distal region of the mafA promoter (16Raum J.C. Gerrish K.

Phosphorylation is thought to be critical for MafA transcriptional activity (17Han S.I. Aramata S. Yasuda K. Kataoka K. Mol. Cell. Biol... 2007; 27: 6593-6605Google Scholar). In vitro kinase assays suggest that MafA may be phosphorylated by ERK2 and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (18Benkhelifa S. Provot S. Nabais E. Eychene A. Calothy G. Felder-Schmittbuhl M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol... 2001; 21: 4441-4452Google Scholar, 19Sii-Felice K. Pouponnot C. Gillet S. Lecoin L. Girault J.A. Eychene A. Felder-Schmittbuhl M.P. FEBS Lett... 2005; 579: 3547-3554Google Scholar). Two groups observed that following phosphorylation of Ser65 of MafA, it is sequentially phosphorylated at Ser61, Thr57, Thr53, and Ser49 by GSK3β (glycogen synthase kinase 3β) (17Han S.I. Aramata S. Yasuda K. Kataoka K. Mol. Cell. Biol... 2007; 27: 6593-6605Google Scholar, 20Rocques N. Abou Z.N. Sii-Felice K. Lecoin L. Felder-Schmittbuhl M.P. Eychene A. Pouponnot C. Mol. Cell.. 2007; 28: 584-597Google Scholar). Phosphorylation at Ser14 has also been reported (18Benkhelifa S. Provot S. Nabais E. Eychene A. Calothy G. Felder-Schmittbuhl M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol... 2001; 21: 4441-4452Google Scholar). MafA phosphorylation may also lead to its ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome (20Rocques N. Abou Z.N. Sii-Felice K. Lecoin L. Felder-Schmittbuhl M.P. Eychene A. Pouponnot C. Mol. Cell.. 2007; 28: 584-597Google Scholar). These findings suggest that multiple covalent modifications of MafA control its function. Covalent post-translational modification with SUMO (small ubiquitin-related modifier) regulates diverse cellular processes, including DNA repair, the cell cycle, gene transcription, and nucleocytoplasmic transport (21Kerscher O. Felberbaum R. Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol... 2006; 22: 159-180Google Scholar, 22Gill G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev... 2005; 15: 536-541Google Scholar). Mammals express four SUMO isoforms. Sumoylation with all isoforms occurs in a stepwise process that involves a cascade of SUMO-specific enzymes, an E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme, an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, and an E3 ligase. SUMO proteases remove SUMO from their targeting proteins. Sumoylation is dynamic, with substrates undergoing rapid conjugation and deconjugation. Only small fractions of the substrates are thought to be subjected to sumoylation at steady state, although the underlying mechanism is still in question. Among the best characterized SUMO substrates are transcription factors, many of which display repressed transcriptional activity upon sumoylation. It has also been proposed that sumoylation of transcription factors contributes to the assembly of promoter complexes and the recruitment of chromatin-modifying enzymes (23Yang X.J. Gregoire S. Mol. Cell.. 2006; 23: 779-786Google Scholar). Several ins gene transcription factors have consensus sumoylation motifs (ΦKXE); these include Pdx-1, C/EBP-β, NFAT, and MafA. Modification of C/EBP-β and NFAT1 by SUMO-1 is important in regulating their transcriptional activity and/or localization (24Eaton E.M. Sealy L. J. Biol. Chem... 2003; 278: 33416-33421Google Scholar, 25Terui Y. Saad N. Jia S. McKeon F. Yuan J. J. Biol. Chem... 2004; 279: 28257-28265Google Scholar). However, little is known about the sumoylation of ins gene transcription factors or the possible biological significance of the modification in β cells. Based on the amino acid sequence, two sumoylation consensus motifs, VK32KE and LK296LE, are present in MafA. Because we are examining mechanisms of glucose-induced changes in transcription in β cells, we tested the idea that SUMO modification of MafA may affect ins gene expression and β cell function. Herein, we provide evidence that MafA is subjected to SUMO-1 or -2 modification in β cells. Hypoglycemia and oxidative stress are potential modulators of MafA sumoylation. Sumoylation regulates MafA transcriptional activity for both ins and CHOP-10 (C/EBP homologous protein 10) gene promoters. These findings demonstrate that MafA is sumoylated in β cells and suggest that sumoylation impacts β cell function. Cell Culture and Harvest—Early passages of the pancreatic β cell lines rat INS-1 and mouse Min6 were kindly provided by Chris Newgard (Duke University) and Gene Webb (University of Chicago), respectively. Cells were maintained as described (26Lawrence M.C. McGlynn K. Park B.H. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem... 2005; 280: 26751-26759Google Scholar, 27Lawrence M.C. McGlynn K. Naziruddin B. Levy M.F. Cobb M.H.

Cells at ∼80% confluence were incubated for 2 h in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate/HEPES buffer containing 2 mm glucose and 0.1% bovine serum albumin (28Khoo S. Cobb M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1997; 94: 5599-5604Google Scholar) before stimulation with 30 mm glucose for Min6 cells and 25 mm glucose for INS-1 cells. After treatment with the reagents indicated in the figure legends, the medium was removed, and cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and harvested in cold lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.2 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 m NaF, 2 mm Na3VO4,10 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 20 μm N-ethylmaleimide). After 15 min on ice, lysates were sedimented for 15 min at 16,000 × g in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C. Supernatants were stored at -80 °C until further analysis. Protein concentrations were measured using the Bio-Rad Bradford reagent. Materials—The Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system and passive lysis buffer were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). The anti-ERK1/2 antibody Y691 was as described (29Boulton T.G. Cobb M.H. Cell Regul.. 1991; 2: 357-371Google Scholar). The following antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA): c-Maf (M-153), SUMO-1, green fluorescent protein (GFP), rabbit IgG, and Myc. The following reagents were purchased from Sigma: hydrogen peroxide, ionomycin, anisomycin, N-acetyl-l-cysteine, catalase, and N-ethylmaleimide. A vector harboring full-length human mafA was kindly provided by Michael German (University of California, San Francisco). MafA(K32R) was provided by Michael Lawrence. The mafA coding sequence was subcloned into pCMV5 with an N-terminal Myc tag. Vector pCS2 containing N-terminal GFP-SUMO-1, SUMO-1-ΔGG, SUMO-2, hemagglutinin (HA)-SENP2 (SUMO-1/sentrin-specific peptidase 2), FLAG-Ubc9, and Ubc9(C93S) (an interfering mutant) were gifts from Hongtao Yu (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center). HA-SUMO-1 in pSFFV was a gift from Kim Orth (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center). Site-directed mutagenesis was performing with the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Complementary oligonucleotides from regions -320 to -300 bp of the CHOP-10 gene and A2E1 and MARE of the insI gene were synthesized (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA) and blunt end-ligated as 3× repeats into the SmaI site of the pGL3-Luc reporter (Promega). All constructs and mutants were confirmed by sequencing. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Aliquots of cell extracts containing 20 μg of protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Proteins were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA) and blocked with 5% nonfat powdered milk in Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 0.15 m NaCl) containing 0.1% Tween 20 for 2 h at room temperature and incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody diluted 1:3000 in Tris-buffered saline for 30 min at room temperature. Proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. In some cases, blots were analyzed by densitometry using a ScanJet 5300C scanner and Multi-Gauge Version 2.3 software. For immunoprecipitation, lysates (0.5–1 mg) were incubated overnight with the indicated antibody and protein A-Sepharose beads at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.1 m NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100. Transfections and Reporter Assays—INS-1, Min6, or HEK293 cells were grown in 6-well plates to 80% confluence and cotransfected with pGL3-MARE, pGL3-CHOP-10 (-320 to -300 bp), or pGL3-A2E1, together with pRL-SV40, and the indicated plasmids using the FuGENE HD reagent (Roche Applied Science). After 48 h, the cells were harvested with passive lysis buffer supplemented with 100 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm Na3VO4, 100 mm NaF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.2 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The lysates were frozen in liquid nitrogen, thawed, and then vortexed for 30 s prior to centrifugation as described above. Promoter activity in the supernatants was assayed with the Dual-Luciferase assay system using a TD-20/20 bioluminometer (Turner Designs), and protein expression was assessed by blotting. Immunofluorescence—Cells were plated onto coverslips in 12-well dishes and transfected with the indicated plasmids. After 48 h, cells were fixed with ice-cold methanol for 1 h at -20 °C, rinsed three times with PBS, and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min at 4 °C. Prior to addition of antibodies, cells were incubated in 0.1% Triton X-100 and 4% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 2 h. Primary antibody in the same solution was incubated overnight with cells at 4 °C. After washing, cells were incubated with secondary antibody (1:5000) and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (1:10,000) for 1 h. Fluorophores were visualized using a DeltaVision RT deconvolution microscope (Applied Precision, Issaquah, WA). Z-stacks were deconvolved and processed with NIH Image J software. Subcellular Fractionation—Min6 cells transfected with the indicated plasmids were washed with PBS and harvested in hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm NaF, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) with other protease inhibitors as described above. After swelling for 15 min on ice, Nonidet P-40 was added to a final concentration of 0.6%, followed by vortexing for 10 s. A cytosolic fraction was obtained by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 5 min. The pellet was resuspended in hypertonic extraction buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm NaF) plus 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and other protease inhibitors as described above and incubated on ice for 30 min with vortexing every 5 min. The nuclear extract was obtained by sedimenting the insoluble material at 16,000 × g for 15 min. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Complementary oligonucleotides containing wild-type MARE (5′-TACAGCTTCAGCCCCTCTCGCCATC) and mutant MARE (5′-TACAGCTGACTACCCTCTCGCCATC) consensus sites of the rat insI gene promoter were synthesized (Integrated DNA Technologies). The oligonucleotides were hybridized and end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. Equal amounts of nuclear extract protein (20 μg) were incubated for 30 min with double-stranded 32P-labeled MARE probe (20,000 cpm) in reaction buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 6% glycerol). As indicated, antibodies were added 2 h before incubation with the labeled probe. The reactions were subjected to electrophoresis on 5% polyacrylamide gels, and bands were detected on film by autoradiography. Statistical Analysis—Results are expressed as means ± S.E. determined from at least three independent experiments. Statistical significance was calculated by analysis of variance as indicated in the figure legends. MafA Is Modified by SUMO-1 in Pancreatic β Cells—Previous studies showed that Maf family members MafG and MafB can be modified by SUMO (30Tillmanns S. Otto C. Jaffray E. Duroure C. Bakri Y.

Mol. Cell. Biol... 2006; 26: 4652-4663Google Scholar). Because there are two sumoylation consensus motifs (VK32KE and LK296LE) in the activation and DNA-binding domains of MafA (Fig. 1A), we investigated whether MafA undergoes sumoylation in pancreatic β cells. In β cells cultured in standard medium, no slowly migrating products, typical of ubiquitin- or SUMO-protein conjugates, were detected by immunoblotting. Because only a relatively small percentage of SUMO substrates are usually found sumoylated in vivo, we transiently expressed epitope-tagged MafA in both Min6 and INS-1 cells. Upon coexpression of Myc-MafA with HA- or GFP-SUMO-1, we observed a Myc-MafA species with an apparent molecular mass increased by the amount expected upon modification by SUMO-1 in β cells (Figs. 1B and 2). Under these conditions, a relatively small amount of MafA was modified. The more slowly migrating band was absent when Myc-MafA was coexpressed with SUMO-1-ΔGG, which lacks the C-terminal diglycine motif and cannot be conjugated to substrates (Fig. 1B). To provide additional evidence that the slowly migrating band is indeed the SUMO-1-modified form of MafA, INS-1 cells were cotransfected with Myc-MafA and GFP-SUMO-1, and MafA was immunoprecipitated with the anti-Maf antibody. Immunoblotting with an antibody to SUMO-1 detected GFP-SUMO-1 linked to MafA in cells transfected with SUMO-1 but not in cells transfected with SUMO-1-ΔGG (Fig. 1C). A comparable profile of MafA sumoylation was observed in HEK293 cells (data not shown). The extent of MafA sumoylation was similar in the presence or absence of overexpression of Ubc9 (ubiquitin-like conjugating enzyme 9), a SUMO-conjugating enzyme (E2) that activates the sumoylation pathway (Fig. 1D). This indicates that Ubc9 is not rate-limiting and suggests that a SUMO E3 ligase would be required to enhance the efficiency of MafA sumoylation. In contrast, coexpression of dominant-negative Ubc9 or the SUMO-specific protease SENP2 reduced detection of sumoylated MafA (Fig. 1D). Thus, SUMO-1 can be covalently coupled to MafA in β cells.FIGURE 2MafA mutants in pancreatic β cells. A–C, immunoblots (IB) with an antibody to Myc of the lysates from INS-1 cells expressing wild-type Myc-MafA, MafA(K32R), MafA(K296R), or MafA(K32R/K296R) and GFP-SUMO-1 or -2 or HA-SUMO-1 as indicated. All experiments were repeated three or more times.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) MafA Is Sumoylated at Lys32—SUMO-1 consists of 101 amino acids and shares ∼50% sequence identity with SUMO-2/3. To test whether MafA can be modified by SUMO-2, we coexpressed Myc-MafA and GFP-SUMO-2 in INS-1 cells. Immunoblotting with an antibody to Myc showed that MafA was modified by SUMO-2, but to a lesser extent than by SUMO-1 (Fig. 2A). To identify the sumoylation sites, we made MafA(K32R), MafA(K296R), and the double mutant by site-directed mutagenesis. Sumoylation of MafA(K32R) and MafA(K32R/K296R) was no longer detected in the presence of overexpressed GFP-SUMO-1 or -2. However, MafA(K296R) was still modified (Fig. 2B). Coexpression with HA-SUMO-1 showed similar results (Fig. 2C). These data are consistent with the conclusion that Lys32 is the major site of sumoylation on MafA in pancreatic β cells. Exposure of Pancreatic β Cells to Low Glucose Increases Sumoylation of Endogenous MafA—To establish the relevance of MafA sumoylation in β cell function, we examined the effect of varying glucose concentrations on endogenous MafA sumoylation. Immunoblotting of immunoprecipitated MafA with anti-SUMO antibodies showed a small amount of endogenous sumoylated MafA in both Min6 and INS-1 cells maintained in standard medium (i.e. in 25 or 11 mm glucose) (Fig. 3A). We confirmed that the 75-kDa MafA species was sumoylated by immunoprecipitating with an anti-SUMO-1 antibody and immunoblotting with an anti-Maf antibody (Fig. 3B). used as a negative control, normal rabbit IgG did not immunoprecipitate these proteins (Fig. 3C). Placing β cells in 2 mm glucose for 2 h enhanced MafA sumoylation. Sumoylation increased further with longer times in low glucose (Fig. 3, A and B). These conditions also dramatically reduced the total amount of MafA, consistent with a previous report (17Han S.I. Aramata S. Yasuda K. Kataoka K. Mol. Cell. Biol... 2007; 27: 6593-6605Google Scholar). Subsequent stimulation of β cells with 30 mm glucose for 15 min following incubation in 2 mm glucose did not decrease the amount of sumoylated MafA (Fig. 3D). These results indicate that varying the glucose concentration can affect the extent of MafA sumoylation in pancreatic β cells. Oxidative Stress Enhances Sumoylation of MafA in Pancreatic β Cells—Protein sumoylation can be induced by heat shock, oxidative stress, electrical stimulation, and ethanol in some systems (32Bossis G. Melchior F. Mol. Cell.. 2006; 21: 349-357Google Scholar, 33Geiss-Friedlander R. Melchior F. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol... 2007; 8: 947-956Google Scholar). To identify factors which can affect MafA sumoylation in pancreatic β cells, we exposed β cells to different stimuli, including KCl, anisomycin, ionomycin, hydrogen peroxide, tumor necrosis factor-α, heat shock, and ethanol. Only hydrogen peroxide stimulated the sumoylation of overexpressed MafA to a measurable extent in both Min6 and INS-1 cells (Fig. 4A and data not shown). To explore this finding further, we tested the effects of different concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (0.1, 0.5, 1, and 2 mm) and different times of exposure (3, 10, and 30 min). As little as 0.1 mm hydrogen peroxide increased MafA sumoylation, with the greatest effect observed after 10 min (Fig. 4B). That the band was the sumoylated form of MafA was confirmed by immunoblotting of anti-SUMO-1 immunoprecipitates with an anti-Maf antibody (Fig. 4C). We exposed β cells to catalase and the antioxidant N-acetyl-l-cysteine after hydrogen peroxide treatment. Both agents modestly reduced the amount of sumoylated MafA (Fig. 4D), consistent with a role for oxidative stress. Placing β cells in fresh culture medium for 30 min after hydrogen peroxide treatment more effectively reduced MafA sumoylation (Fig. 4D). Preventing Sumoylation of MafA Alters Its Transcriptional Activity—To assess the functional consequences of MafA sumoylation, we compared wild-type MafA and MafA(K32R), the mutant lacking the SUMO-1 acceptor site, in transcriptional reporter assays. INS-1 cells were cotransfected with a reporter plasmid containing the rat insI MARE and the MafA constructs. The K32R mutant induced greater reporter activity than an equal amount of wild-type MafA under several conditions, consistent with the idea that sumoylation inhibits MafA activity for the ins gene promoter (Fig. 5, A and B). Further support for this hypothesis came from coexpression with the protease SENP2, which increased reporter activity induced by wild-type MafA, presumably due to reversal of its fractional sumoylation, but had no effect on the activity of MafA(K32R) (Fig. 5B). Min6 cells were transfected with another reporter construct containing the rat insI A2E1 region, which includes MafA- and other transcription factor-binding sites, along with MafA. Increasing amounts of SUMO-1 reduced reporter gene expression (Fig. 5C), also consistent with an inhibitory effect of MafA sumoylation on ins gene transcription. Disruption of the CHOP-10 gene delays β cell death caused by endoplasmic reticulum stress (34Oyadomari S. Koizumi A. Takeda K. Gotoh T. Akira S. Araki E. Mori M. J. Clin. Investig... 2002; 109: 525-532Google Scholar). We showed previously that expression of the CHOP-10 gene is induced in pancreatic β cells maintained in 5.5 mm glucose and repressed by higher concentrations of glucose (27Lawrence M.C. McGlynn K. Naziruddin B. Levy M.F. Cobb M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2007; 104: 11518-11525Google Scholar). This is due in part to MafA, which represses CHOP-10 transcription by binding to a MARE-CEB (CAAT enhancer-binding element) site (-320 to -300 bp) in the promoter. We asked whether overexpression of MafA or MafA(K32R) has an effect on the transcriptional activity for the CHOP-10 promoter in pancreatic β cells. Using luciferase linked to the MARE-CEB site from the CHOP-10 promoter, we found that MafA(K32R) had little or no ability to repress reporter gene expression. In contrast, wild-type MafA caused a small but statistically significant repression (Fig. 5D), suggesting that transcriptional repression of this promoter requires modification, presumably sumoylation, of MafA at Lys32. To explore this observation further, wild-type MafA and MafA(K32R) were expressed along with the MARE-CEB site from the CHOP-10 promoter in HEK293 cells, which express no detectable endogenous MafA. Wild-type MafA was able to repress expression of the reporter, whereas MafA(K32R) did not (Fig. 5E). Furthermore, expression of SENP2 reversed repression induced by wild-type MafA. These results support the conclusion that repression of CHOP-10 requires sumoylated MafA. To examine the effects on interaction with the ins gene promoter, wild-type MafA or MafA(K32R) was overexpressed in INS-1 cells or not, and nuclear extracts were prepared for electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Extracts from cells expressing the mutant, which could not be sumoylated, bound DNA as well as did extracts from cells expressing wild-type MafA (Fig. 6, A and B). Binding could be competed by a 50-fold excess of unlabeled wild-type probe. In supershift assays, the anti-Maf antibody bound to both samples, causing a supershift. Expression of SUMO-1 had no detectable impact on the amount of oligonucleotide-bound complex. MafA Sumoylation Has No Detectable Impact on Its Nuclear Localization or Stability in β Cells—Sumoylation has been shown to alter the subcellular localization of certain proteins. To investigate whether MafA sumoylation grossly alters its subcellular localization in β cells, we expressed wild-type MafA, MafA(K32R), and SUMO-1 in different combinations in Min6 cells, followed by indirect immunofluorescence staining. In agreement with previous studies, endogenous MafA was detected in the nucleus of β cells. Overexpressed SUMO-1 was also localized in the nucleus. Expression of SUMO-1 did not detectably alter the localization of endogenous MafA (data not shown). Similar localization patterns were also observed with both wild-type Myc-MafA and the K32R mutant in the presence or absence of coexpressed SUMO-1. Using wild-type MafA plus SUMO-1, the fraction of tagged MafA that was sumoylated should have been greater; using the mutant, the sumoylated species should have been eliminated. In neither case were differences observed. Immunoblotting of SUMO-MafA in subcellular fractions also revealed no differences in its subcellular distribution profile relative to the form that could not be modified (data not shown). To confirm that MafA is degraded by the proteasome, we treated INS-1 cells with MG132, a proteasome inhibitor. Immunoblotting showed that endogenous MafA protein increased in MG132-treated cells (Fig. 7A). We investigated whether sumoylation might affect ubiquitin-dependent degradation of MafA. Wild-type MafA or the non-sumoylatable K32R or K32R/K296R mutant was expressed in INS-1 cells, and the cells were treated with cycloheximide. Coexpression of SUMO-1 did not greatly affect the half-life of endogenous or overexpressed MafA (Fig. 7, B–G). Wild-type MafA and the double mutant had similar steady-state expression in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor (Fig. 7, F and G). These results suggest that SUMO and ubiquitin modifications of MafA do not compete for the same lysine residue. We show here that endogenous MafA is sumoylated in pancreatic β cells. To identify the functions associated with this modification, we examined the effects of MafA sumoylation on the ins gene and CHOP-10 gene promoters. Reporter activity driven by the MafA-responsive sequence from the ins gene promoter is enhanced by preventing sumoylation of MafA, leading to the idea that sumoylation of MafA inhibits its ability to stimulate transcription. We found previously that MafA binding to the CHOP-10 promoter is associated with inhibition of CHOP-10 expression (27Lawrence M.C. McGlynn K. Naziruddin B. Levy M.F. Cobb M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2007; 104: 11518-11525Google Scholar). Here, we found that blocking sumoylation of MafA prevents transcriptional repression of the CHOP-10 promoter in β cells or in a reconstituted system lacking endogenous MafA, consistent with the conclusion that inhibition of CHOP-10 gene expression by MafA requires its sumoylation. Taken together, these results suggest that sumoylation of MafA regulates important biological activities of this protein that may enhance β cell survival as well as modulate ins gene expression. Previous chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that MafA is bound to the CHOP-10 promoter under conditions in which CHOP-10 promoter activity is repressed (27Lawrence M.C. McGlynn K. Naziruddin B. Levy M.F. Cobb M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2007; 104: 11518-11525Google Scholar). MafA lacking the sumoylation site is not capable of inhibiting CHOP-10 promoter activity in cells lacking endogenous MafA. From these experiments, we conclude that reduced CHOP-10 promoter activity requires binding of sumoylated MafA to the CHOP-10 promoter. Because MafA binds to the promoter under conditions in which it represses transcription and because sumoylated MafA is required for promoter inhibition, it seems most likely that neither altered localization nor degradation plays a substantial role in the functional effects detected on transcription. This hypothesis is supported by the lack of observable changes in these behaviors upon a forced increase in sumoylation. Transcriptional repression is a function commonly associated with sumoylation (22Gill G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev... 2005; 15: 536-541Google Scholar, 33Geiss-Friedlander R. Melchior F. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol... 2007; 8: 947-956Google Scholar, 35Yang S.H. Sharrocks A.D. Mol. Cell.. 2004; 13: 611-617Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms by which SUMO modification represses gene transcription may be several. Sumoylation may recruit corepressors or other chromatin modulators, such as histone deacetylases, to promoters. These modulators may assist in initiating the formation of repressive complexes or in retaining the repressive chromatin state, which could account for the substantial effect of low level sumoylated proteins. Increased sumoylation of MafA is associated with a less robust stimulation of ins promoter activity. For the ins promoter, it is unclear if the decrease in stimulatory activity is due to effects of sumoylated MafA on the promoter complex, such as recruitment of deacetylases, or to lack of sumoylated MafA binding to the promoter. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay experiments suggest that sumoylation does not prevent DNA binding. Further examination of MafA interactions on the ins promoter will be required to define the mechanism underlying its altered function in ins gene transcription. Mutagenesis indicates that a single site, Lys32, is the predominant, if not only, sumoylation site in MafA, consistent with what was recently reported for MafB (30Tillmanns S. Otto C. Jaffray E. Duroure C. Bakri Y. Vanhille L. Sarrazin S. Hay R.T. Sieweke M.H. Mol. Cell. Biol... 2007; 27: 5554-5564Google Scholar). Lys32 is in a region containing several reported phosphorylation sites, but is not immediately juxtaposed to these sites. Previous studies have not unambiguously delineated the effects of these putative phosphorylations on MafA activity; thus, predicting how these modifications may interact is not yet possible. Several studies of the ternary complex factor Elk-1 have revealed interplay between phosphorylation and sumoylation that may well serve as a model for the regulation of MafA function. Phosphorylation enhances Elk-1 transcriptional activity, whereas sumoylation inhibits this function (36Yang S.H. Jaffray E. Hay R.T. Sharrocks A.D. Mol. Cell.. 2003; 12: 63-74Google Scholar). Important questions remaining to be answered concern the mechanisms that determine the extent of MafA sumoylation in β cells and the role of glucose concentration. β cells experience high levels of oxidative stress that are thought to contribute to cell death in response to hyperglycemia (34Oyadomari S. Koizumi A. Takeda K. Gotoh T. Akira S. Araki E. Mori M. J. Clin. Investig... 2002; 109: 525-532Google Scholar, 37Poitout V. Robertson R.P. Endocrinology.. 2002; 143: 339-342Google Scholar). The increase in MafA sumoylation by hydrogen peroxide suggested that exposure to elevated glucose might also increase MafA sumoylation; however, the greatest sumoylation of endogenous MafA was detected in cells in low not high glucose. Ongoing studies focus on defining these mechanisms.

Successive in vitro and in vivo models were used; these included cell line-derived and patient-derived tumors from our PancXenoBank, a live collection of freshly generated pancreatic cancer xenografts. ON 01910.Na showed equivalent activity to gemcitabine against pancreatic cancer cell lines in vitro. The activity of the agent correlated with suppression of phospho-CDC25C and cyclin B1. These markers were optimized for a fine-needle aspirate ex vivo rapid assay. Cyclin B1 mRNA evaluation yielded the most optimal combination of accuracy and reproducibility. Next, nine patient-derived tumors from the PancXenoBank were profiled using the assay developed in cell lines and treated with ON01910.Na for 28 days. Two cases were cataloged as potential responders and seven as resistants. There was a correlation between the ex vivo assay and sensitivity to the tested agent, as the two cases prospectively identified as sensitive met prespecified criteria for response. Of the seven tumors of predictive resistant, only one was found to be sensitive to ON 01910.Na. In addition, there was a good correlation between cyclin B1 downregulation ex vivo and changes in cyclin B1 protein post-treatment. The novel mitotic inhibitor, ON 01910.Na, showed activity in preclinical model of pancreatic cancer. A rapid assay was rationally developed that not only identified cases sensitive to ON 01910.Na, but also anticipated the pharmacodynamic events occurring after in vivo exposure."
https://openalex.org/W2086840833,"We report evidence that adenylate kinase (AK) from Escherichia coli can be activated by the direct binding of a magnesium ion to the enzyme, in addition to ATP-complexed Mg(2+). By systematically varying the concentrations of AMP, ATP, and magnesium in kinetic experiments, we found that the apparent substrate inhibition of AK, formerly attributed to AMP, was suppressed at low magnesium concentrations and enhanced at high magnesium concentrations. This previously unreported magnesium dependence can be accounted for by a modified random bi-bi model in which Mg(2+) can bind to AK directly prior to AMP binding. A new kinetic model is proposed to replace the conventional random bi-bi mechanism with substrate inhibition and is able to describe the kinetic data over a physiologically relevant range of magnesium concentrations. According to this model, the magnesium-activated AK exhibits a 23- +/- 3-fold increase in its forward reaction rate compared with the unactivated form. The findings imply that Mg(2+) could be an important affecter in the energy signaling network in cells."
https://openalex.org/W2035748996,"Integrins are type I heterodimeric cell adhesion molecules that mediate a wide array of biological processes. Integrin bidirectional signaling allows communication between the cell interior with its microenvironment.

Our data are consistent with a GXXXG-type interaction of the αLβ2 TMs. Finally, we observed by FRET analyses that perturbation of the αLβ2 TMs by β2 Thr-686 mutation facilitated αL micro-cluster formation.

The metazoan cell adhesion molecules integrins are a large family of type I membrane proteins form by noncovalent and specific pairing of α and β subunits (1Hynes R.O. Cell.. 2002; 110: 673-687Google Scholar). Integrins have a large ectodomain, two transmembrane domains (TMs), 3The abbreviations used are: TM, transmembrane domain; BSA, bovine serum albumin; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; ICAM, intercellular adhesion molecule; IEGF, integrin epidermal growth factor; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; DTT, dithiothreitol; DPC, dodecylphosphocholine.3The abbreviations used are: TM, transmembrane domain; BSA, bovine serum albumin; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; ICAM, intercellular adhesion molecule; IEGF, integrin epidermal growth factor; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; DTT, dithiothreitol; DPC, dodecylphosphocholine. and short cytoplasmic tails with the exception of the β4 subunit. Devoid of intrinsic enzymatic activities, the integrins trigger intracellular signaling circuits by selective recruitment of cytosolic molecules to their cytoplasmic tails (2Liu S. Calderwood D.A. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Sci... 2000; 113: 3563-3571Google Scholar). The phosphorylations of integrin cytoplasmic tails are also important events in modulating integrin activity and signaling capacity (3Fagerholm S.C. Hilden T.J. Nurmi S.M. Gahmberg C.G. J.

Together, these cytosolic interactions and post-translational modifications are required for integrin bi-directional signaling that allows communication between the interior of the cell with its external microenvironment. The TMs of the integrins provide the connection for signal transmission between their cytoplasmic tails and their ectodomains. Electron cryomicroscopy study of human integrin αIIbβ3 suggests that the integrin TMs interact with each other in the resting or low affinity state (5Adair B.D. Yeager M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2002; 99: 14059-14064Google Scholar). Conceivably, structural changes in the integrin ectodomain elicited by ligand binding or the separation of the integrin cytoplasmic tails by cytosolic molecule such as talin will trigger reorientation or/and separation of the TMs (6Kim M. Carman C.V. Springer T.A. Science.. 2003; 301: 1720-1725Google Scholar), events that are required to relay signal from one end of the integrin molecule to the other. Indeed, in the absence of activation signal impinging on the integrin ectodomain or its cytoplasmic tails, the disruption of the TM interface alone is sufficient to promote αIIbβ3 activation and intermolecular homomeric interactions (7Li R. Mitra N. Gratkowski H. Vilaire G. Litvinov R. Nagasami C. Weisel J.W. Lear J.D. DeGrado W.F. Bennett J.S. Science.. 2003; 300: 795-798Google Scholar, 8Luo B.H. Carman C.V. Takagi J. Springer T.A.

In line with these observations, the introduction of a disulfide bond linking the α and β TMs constrained the movement of the TMs, which blunted both inside-out and outside-in signaling in αIIbβ3 (10Luo B.H. Springer T.A. Takagi J. PLoS Biol... 2004; 2: e153Google Scholar, 11Zhu J. Carman C.V. Kim M. Shimaoka M. Springer T.A. Luo B.H. Blood.. 2007; 110: 2475-2483Google Scholar).To fully characterize integrin bi-directional signaling, the structure of the TMs, and more importantly the orientation of the α and β TMs with respect to each other require investigations. Based on computational studies, it was proposed that a GXXXG-like motif in the α and β TMs, in particular those of αIIbβ3, favors interactions similar to that of the homodimer glycophorin A (GpA) (12Gottschalk K.E.

However, different models for the packing of integrin αIIbβ3 TMs have also been suggested (5Adair B.D. Yeager M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2002; 99: 14059-14064Google Scholar, 10Luo B.H. Springer T.A. Takagi J. PLoS Biol... 2004; 2: e153Google Scholar). These models of TM heterodimers may represent distinct stages of α and β TM rearrangements during integrin activation or affinity change (10Luo B.H. Springer T.A. Takagi J.

Another interesting but debatable concept is the involvement of TM in the process of integrin clustering. Homo-oligomerization of αIIb and β3 TM-cytoplasmic tail fragments in dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) micelles were detected by methods of ultracentrifugation, NMR, and SDS-PAGE (16Li R. Babu C.R. Lear J.D. Wand A.J. Bennett J.S. DeGrado W.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2001; 98: 12462-12467Google Scholar). The same group also reported dimerization of the αIIb TM by TOXCAT assay that measures oligomerization in the inner membrane of Escherichia coli (17Li R. Gorelik R. Nanda V. Law P.B. Lear J.D. DeGrado W.F. Bennett J.S. J. Biol. Chem... 2004; 279: 26666-26673Google Scholar). However, using the GALLEX assay, a LexA DNA binding domain/lacZ reporter system in specific E. coli strains, the integrin β7 TM but not the β1 or β3 TM showed strong propensity to form homo-oligomers comparable to that of the GpA TMs; homo-oligomerization of αIIb was only weakly detected (18Schneider D. Engelman D.M. J. Biol. Chem... 2004; 279: 9840-9846Google Scholar). Recently, NMR spectroscopy analysis of β3 TM peptide embedded in bicelles and micelles also showed monomeric TM segments (19Lau T.L. Partridge A.W. Ginsberg M.H. Ulmer T.S. Biochemistry.. 2008; 47: 4008-4016Google Scholar). In CHO cell system in which full-length αIIbβ3 was investigated, disruption of the αIIbβ3 TM interface by the point mutation G708N in β3 promoted receptor activation, homo-oligomerization, and facilitated αIIbβ3 macro-cluster formation (7Li R. Mitra N. Gratkowski H. Vilaire G. Litvinov R. Nagasami C. Weisel J.W. Lear J.D. DeGrado W.F. Bennett J.S. Science.. 2003; 300: 795-798Google Scholar). In a separate study, the same mutation increased the ligand-binding affinity of αIIbβ3, but failed to form macroclusters (8Luo B.H. Carman C.V. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2005; 102: 3679-3684Google Scholar). What accounts for these different observations is not known.Integrin αLβ2 (LFA-1, CD11aCD18) is being studied extensively because of its primary function in immune homeostasis involving leukocyte adhesion, migration, and proliferation (20Smith A. Stanley P. Jones K. Svensson L. McDowall A. Hogg N. Immunol. Rev... 2007; 218: 135-146Google Scholar, 21Reichardt P. Dornbach B. Gunzer M. Immunol. Rev... 2007; 218: 165-177Google Scholar, 22Kinashi T. Adv. Immunol... 2007; 93: 185-227Google Scholar). Many studies investigate the ectodomain conformation of αLβ2, and the membrane proximal events impinging on its cytoplasmic tails with regard to its functional regulation (23Luo B.H. Carman C.V. Springer T.A. Annu. Rev. Immunol... 2007; 25: 619-647Google Scholar, 24Arnaout M.A. Goodman S.L. Xiong J.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol... 2007; 19: 495-507Google Scholar). Although computational and modeling studies provide a guide to αL and β2 TM interactions that are possible, they remain to be tested in a full-length receptor in a cell-based system (15Lin X. Tan S.M. Law S.K. Torres J. Proteins.. 2006; 65: 274-279Google Scholar). Unlike αIIbβ3, much less is known about the αLβ2 TM interface. Previously, we showed by TM exchange that replacing β2 TM with β4 TM generated an αLβ2 mutant that exhibited wild type activity (25Vararattanavech A. Tang M.L. Li H.Y. Wong C.H. Law S.K. Torres J. Tan S.M. Biochem. J... 2008; 410: 495-502Google Scholar). This was in contrast to αLβ2 mutants with β2 TM replaced by other β TMs, many of these were activated. In this study, we show that the β2 TM residue Thr-686 within the GXXXG-like motif contributes toward the formation of the αLβ2 TM interface. Mutation of Thr-686 induced αLβ2 activation, and promoted αL micro-cluster formation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAntibodies and Reagents—The mAb MHM23 (β2 integrins heterodimer-specific) (26Hildreth J.E.

Hong W. Mol. Biol. Cell.. 2002; 13: 3493-3507Google Scholar) was kindly provided by W. J. Hong (Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, A*STAR, Singapore). The hybridomas of mAb KIM185 (β2-specific and activating; its epitope is in the β2 integrin epidermal growth factor fold 4 and the β-tail domain (29Robinson M.K. Andrew D. Rosen H. Brown D.

Recombinant human intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1/Fc and ICAM-3/Fc were kindly provided by S. K. A. Law (School of Biological Sciences, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore). All general chemicals and reagents were from Sigma-Aldrich unless otherwise indicated.Expression Plasmids—The positions of the integrin amino acids are numbered accordingly to Barclay et al. (35Barclay A.N. Brown M.H. Law S.K. McKnight A.J. Tomlinson M.G. van der Merwe P.A. The Leucocyte Antigen Facts Book.2nd Ed. Academic Press, London, UK1997Google Scholar). Expression plasmids encoding full-length human integrin αL and β2 subunits were described previously (36Al-Shamkhani A. Law S.K. Eur. J. Immunol... 1998; 28: 3291-3300Google Scholar). The integrin TM chimera β24, in which the β2 TM is replaced with the corresponding TM segment from β4, was reported previously (25Vararattanavech A. Tang M.L. Li H.Y. Wong C.H. Law S.K. Torres J. Tan S.M. Biochem. J... 2008; 410: 495-502Google Scholar). All point mutations were generated using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis (SDM) kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with relevant primers. For fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments, the expression plasmids containing αL monomeric CFP (mCFP) and β2 monomeric YFP (mYFP) have been described, and αLmYFP was generated by the same procedure (25Vararattanavech A. Tang M.L. Li H.Y. Wong C.H. Law S.K. Torres J. Tan S.M. Biochem. J... 2008; 410: 495-502Google Scholar). Briefly, mCFP was fused to the C terminus of the αL cytoplasmic tail with a linker that contains the amino acids GPVAT, and the mYFP was fused to the C terminus of the β2 cytoplasmic tail with a linker that contains amino acids GGP-VAT as described (6Kim M. Carman C.V. Springer T.A. Science.. 2003; 301: 1720-1725Google Scholar). All expression plasmids were verified by sequencing (Research Biolabs, Singapore).Cell Culture and Transfection—The 293T and K562 cells were obtained from ATCC. 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (HI-FBS), 100 international units/ml of penicillin and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin (Hyclone, South Logan, UT). K562 cells were cultured in RMPI 1640 containing 10% (v/v) HI-FBS, 100 international units/ml of penicillin and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin. The Polyfect transfection reagent (Qiagen) was used for 293T transient transfection. K562 cells were transiently transfected by the method of electroporation using the Amaxa Nucleofector device, and reagents per the manufacturer's instructions (Amaxa Gmbh, Germany).Flow Cytometry—The surface expression levels of integrins on transfectants were determined by immunostaining cells with mAb IB4 (20 μg/ml) and secondary fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) (1:400), followed by analysis on a FACS Calibur with the software CellQuest (Becton Dickinson Biosciences, Mountain View, CA) essentially as described previously (37Tan S.M. Hyland R.H. Al-Shamkhani A. Douglass W.A. Shaw J.M. Law S.K. J. Immunol... 2000; 165: 2574-2581Google Scholar). Expression index (EI) was calculated by % gated positive × geo-mean fluorescence intensity (37Tan S.M. Hyland R.H. Al-Shamkhani A. Douglass W.A. Shaw J.M. Law S.K. J. Immunol... 2000; 165: 2574-2581Google Scholar).Biotin Labeling of Cell Surface Proteins and Immunoprecipitation—In brief, transfectants were washed twice in PBS and incubated in PBS containing 0.5 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-biotin (Pierce) for 15 min at room temperature. The biotin-labeling reaction was terminated by washing cells in PBS containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 and 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. For the analyses of αLβ2 conformation, cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% (v/v) HI-FBS, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), and 2 μg each of mAb MHM23 or KIM127 at 37 °C for 30 min. 5 mm MgCl2 and 1 mm EGTA were included for the αLβ2 activating condition. Unbound mAb was removed by washing cells twice in medium. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Nonidet-P 40) containing protease inhibitors at 4 °C for 30 min. Immunoprecipitation was performed using rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) coupled to protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (37Tan S.M. Hyland R.H. Al-Shamkhani A. Douglass W.A. Shaw J.M. Law S.K. J. Immunol... 2000; 165: 2574-2581Google Scholar). Bound proteins were resolved on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel under reducing conditions (+DTT), and electroblotted onto Immobilon P membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Biotinylated protein bands were probed with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase and detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) using the ECL-plus kit (Amersham Biosciences).For the analyses of disulfide bond formation between the αL and β2 TMs by the introduction of a cysteine pair, biotin labeling of αLβ2, immunoprecipitation, and protein bands detection were performed as described above with the following changes. The mAb IB4 (2 μg) was used for immunoprecipitation. Proteins were resolved on 7% SDS-PAGE gels under reducing (+DTT) or non-reducing (-DTT) conditions.Cell Adhesion Assays—Adhesion of transfectants to immobilized ICAMs was performed essentially as described (37Tan S.M. Hyland R.H. Al-Shamkhani A. Douglass W.A. Shaw J.M. Law S.K. J. Immunol... 2000; 165: 2574-2581Google Scholar). Polysorb microtiter well (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) was coated with 0.5 μg of goat anti-human IgG Fc-specific (Sigma) in 50 mm bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.2), and nonspecific binding sites blocked with 0.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS. Thereafter, ICAM-Fc (50 ng) in PBS was added to each well and incubated at room temperature for 2 h. Cells were labeled with 2′,7′-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(and-6) carboxyfluorescein (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), and ∼2 × 104 cells in medium containing 5% (v/v) HI-FBS and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) were added to each ICAM-coated well and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. The activating agents mAb KIM185 (10 μg/ml) and/or Mg/EGTA (ME) (5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA) were included in the experiments. Non-adherent cells were removed by washing the wells twice with medium. The fluorescence signal that corresponds to the number of adherent cells was measured with a fluorescent plate reader (FL600) (Bio-Tek Instruments, Winooski, VT). In all cases, the level of adhesion to the ICAMs was determined and expressed as relative adhesion to ligand with respect to that of wild-type αLβ2 in the absence of activation.Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) Analyses—For FRET experiments, K562 transfectants were adhered onto poly-l-lysine coated glass slides by brief spinning. Acceptor photobleaching, FRET (38Karpova T.S. Baumann C.T. He L. Wu X. Grammer A. Lipsky P. Hager G.L. McNally J.G. J. Microsc... 2003; 209: 56-70Google Scholar) was performed on a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY) to detect αL micro-clusters using similar procedures as described previously (25Vararattanavech A. Tang M.L. Li H.Y. Wong C.H. Law S.K. Torres J. Tan S.M. Biochem. J... 2008; 410: 495-502Google Scholar). When αLmCFP oligomerizes with αLmYFP, FRET will be detected. The settings for FRET used were: mCFP, excitation wavelength 458 nm; emission filter BP 470-500 nm; mYFP, excitation wavelength 514 nm; emission filter LP 530 nm. Cells were visualized with an oil immersion 63× objective. The mYFP of an entire cell was photobleached by scanning the entire cell 20 times using the 514 argon laser line that was set at maximum intensity. The mCFP signal of the region of interest (ROI), which is the cell membrane, was acquired before and after the photobleach. The high density of αLβ2 in the center of the cell (Golgi compartment) was excluded from the analyses (6Kim M. Carman C.V. Springer T.A. Science.. 2003; 301: 1720-1725Google Scholar). FRET efficiency (EF) was calculated as a percentage using the equation EF = (I6 - I5) × 100/I6, where In is the mCFP intensity at the nth time point. Bleaching was performed between the 5th and 6th time points. The mean noise computed as NF = (I5 - I4) x 100/I5 in which the mCFP signals at the 4th and 5th time points before the bleaching process was close to zero in all cases.Immunofluorescence Co-localization Analyses—K562 cells transfected with αLmCFP, αLmYFP, and β2 or β2T686F were adhered onto poly-l-lysine slides by brief spinning, and fixed in 3.7% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were washed in HBSS, followed by incubation in HBSS containing 0.3%(v/v) Triton X-100 for 3 min at room temperature. Cells were stained with anti-Golgi matrix protein GM130 mAb (1:50 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed in HBSS followed by staining with Alexa Fluor® 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (1:500 dilution) (Molecular Probes) for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were mounted in Vector shield and examined on a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope for co-localization of integrins with GM130.Models of αLβ2 TMs—The two backbone models for αLβ2 TMs interaction were obtained from a previous conformational search that used the TMs of all integrin types (15Lin X. Tan S.M. Law S.K. Torres J. Proteins.. 2006; 65: 274-279Google Scholar), where only these two models were found to be evolutionarily conserved, and consistent with previous studies (10Luo B.H. Springer T.A. Takagi J. PLoS Biol... 2004; 2: e153Google Scholar, 18Schneider D. Engelman D.M. J. Biol. Chem... 2004; 279: 9840-9846Google Scholar).RESULTSThr-686 of the β2 Subunit Participates in the Interaction of the αLβ2 TMs—We reported previously that the specific pairing of the integrin TMs is required for the proper expression of the receptor, and the maintenance of the β2 integrins in a low affinity state (25Vararattanavech A. Tang M.L. Li H.Y. Wong C.H. Law S.K. Torres J. Tan S.M. Biochem. J... 2008; 410: 495-502Google Scholar). Conceivably, non-permissive TM pairing leads to disrupted TM packing of the α and β subunits. An interesting observation was made with regard to the TM mutant β24 in which the β2 TM was replaced with the β4 TM. Unlike other β2 mutants with TM of β1, β3, β5, or β6 that generated constitutively activated receptors when combined with αL, the αLβ24 mutant showed wild-type ligand binding activity (25Vararattanavech A. Tang M.L. Li H.Y. Wong C.H. Law S.K. Torres J. Tan S.M. Biochem. J... 2008; 410: 495-502Google Scholar). The β2 having its TM replaced by β7 or β8TM were excluded from the analyses because of the aberrant glycosylation of β27 and defective expression of β28. Inspection of the TM sequences of β1, β3, β5, and β6 shows a conserved Val within the GXXXG-like motif of these subunits (Fig. 1A). However, in β2 and β4 the corresponding residues are Thr and Leu, respectively. Previously, we have reported that two backbone models of interaction of α and β integrin TMs are evolutionarily conserved (15Lin X. Tan S.M. Law S.K. Torres J. Proteins.. 2006; 65: 274-279Google Scholar); a GXXXG-type (GpA-like) interaction (model I, cyan) and a model consistent with previous TM cysteine-scanning analyses (model II, green) (Fig. 1B) (10Luo B.H. Springer T.A. Takagi J. PLoS Biol... 2004; 2: e153Google Scholar). The β2 Thr-686 is positioned at the interface of the αL and β2 TMs in both models.We examined whether β2 Thr-686 is a key residue in the interface of the αLβ2 TMs. 293T cells were transiently transfected with either wild-type αLβ2 or αLβ2T686V (Fig. 2A). The expression level of αLβ2T686V was comparable to wild-type αLβ2 as determined by flow cytometry using the mAb IB4 that recognizes β2 integrin heterodimers (Fig. 2B) (33Wright S.D. Rao P.E. Van Voorhis W.C. Craigmyle L.S. Iida K. Talle M.A. Westberg E.F. Goldstein G. Silverstein S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1983; 80: 5699-5703Google Scholar). To test the activity of αLβ2T686V, cell adhesion assays on immobilized αLβ2 ligands ICAM-1 (39Marlin S.D. Springer T.A. Cell.. 1987; 51: 813-819Google Scholar) and ICAM-3 (40de Fougerolles A.R. Springer T.A. J. Exp. Med... 1992; 175: 185-190Google Scholar) were performed. Cells expressing wild-type αLβ2 showed minimal adhesion to ICAM-1, but adhesion was markedly enhanced by the addition of the β2 integrin activating mAb KIM185 (Fig. 2C) (29Robinson M.K. Andrew D. Rosen H. Brown D. Ortlepp S. Stephens P. Butcher E.C. J. Immunol... 1992; 148: 1080-1085Google Scholar). Importantly, cells expressing αLβ2T686V showed significant constitutive adhesion to ICAM-1, albeit at a lower level when compared with that of KIM185 activation. Adhesion was mediated by αLβ2 because it was abrogated in the presence of the mAb IB4 that is also function-blocking (25Vararattanavech A. Tang M.L. Li H.Y. Wong C.H. Law S.K. Torres J. Tan S.M. Biochem. J... 2008; 410: 495-502Google Scholar).FIGURE 2The contribution of β2 Thr-686 to the αLβ2 TM interface. A, illustration of the αL and β2 subunits without (white) or with (gray) TM substituted with β4. The point mutations T686V and L686V are indicated. B, expression levels of αLβ2 and αLβ2T686V on 293T transfectants were assessed by flow cytometry using the β2 integrin heterodimer-specific mAb IB4 (shaded histogram). Irrelevant mAb (open histogram). C and D, adhesion of transfectants to immobilized ICAM-1 or ICAM-3 was performed with or without activating agents. The activating agents are mAb KIM185 and Mg/EGTA (ME). Adhesion specificity was verified using mAb IB4, which is also a function-blocking mAb. The level of adhesion to the ICAMs was determined and expressed as relative adhesion to ligand with respect to that of wild-type αLβ2 in the absence of activation. Data points represent means ± S.D. of triplicates. E, expression levels of αLβ2, αLβ24, αLβ24L686V on 293T transfectants were determined by flow cytometry using mAb IB4 (shaded histogram).

EI, expression index.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The investigation was extended to examine the adhesion profiles of these transfectants to ICAM-3 (Fig. 2D). It was proposed that an intermediate affinity αLβ2 binds ICAM-1 but not ICAM-3, and effective binding to ICAM-3 requires a high affinity αLβ2 (41Tang R.H. Tng E. Law S.K. Tan S.M. J. Biol. Chem... 2005; 280: 29208-29216Google Scholar). Binding studies with isolated recombinant αL inserted (I) domain, and the ICAMs showed that the binding affinity is in the order of ICAM-1>ICAM-2>ICAM-3 (42Shimaoka M. Lu C. Palframan R.T. von Andrian U.H. McCormack A. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2001; 98: 6009-6014Google Scholar). Further, we showed that the conformational changes in αLβ2 that are required to bind ICAM-1 and ICAM-3 are different (43Tang X.Y. Li Y.F. Tan S.M. J. Immunol... 2008; 180: 4793-4804Google Scholar). In our previous studies, the adhesion of αLβ2 expressing cells to ICAM-3 can be induced by a combination of KIM185 and Mg/EGTA (25Vararattanavech A. Tang M.L. Li H.Y. Wong C.H. Law S.K. Torres J. Tan S.M. Biochem. J... 2008; 410: 495-502Google Scholar, 41Tang R.H. Tng E. Law S.K. Tan S.M. J. Biol. Chem... 2005; 280: 29208-29216Google Scholar, 44Cheng M. Foo S.Y. Shi M.L. Tang R.H. Kong L.S.

In line with these observations, transfectant expressing wild-type αLβ2 only adhered significantly to ICAM-3 when both activating KIM185 and Mg/EGTA were included (Fig. 2D). Interestingly, cells expressing αLβ2T686V showed significant adhesion to ICAM-3 in the presence of KIM185 alone, and the level of adhesion was augmented when KIM185 and Mg/EGTA were both included. These data suggest that substitution of Thr-686 with Val in β2 TM promotes an activated αLβ2 with properties of an intermediate affinity receptor.Based on these observations, it may be inferred that Thr-686 of the β2 subunit contributes to t"
