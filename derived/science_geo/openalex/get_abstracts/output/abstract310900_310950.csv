https://openalex.org/W2089932540,"Sex determination in an atherinid fish, the Atlantic silverside (Menidia menidia), is under the control of both genotype and temperature during a specific period of larval development. The sex ratios of the progeny of different females are variable and differ in their responsiveness to temperature. This demonstrates that sex ratio in fishes that normally have separate sexes can be influenced by the environment."
https://openalex.org/W2077094839,"Annual pollen deposition per unit area measured in sediment traps is two to four times greater than deposition measured in surface sediment cores. The difference is due to repeated redeposition of pollen from the sediment surface during seasons of water circulation. This process reduces variations in the percentages of different pollen types in sediment, but causes differences in the total amount of pollen accumulated in various parts of the lake basin."
https://openalex.org/W2008870115,"It is suggested that the raw materials and technology exist for basing a major fraction of the U.S. chemical industry on four fermentation products, used in the proper portions: ethanol, isopropanol, n-butanol, and 2,3-butanediol. The primary route for introduction of these materials is dehydration of the alcohols and diols to olefins, which would cause little disruption of the existing industry downstream from the olefins. The proposed substitution has the advantages that it would provide a smooth transition toward renewable feedstocks, while decreasing dependence on fossil sources of organic material and use of toxic materials. However, to make these materials attractive as feedstocks or intermediates in chemical production, their current prices must be substantially reduced. Even with the optimum mix, their largeseale utilization will only occur at about 20 to 40 percent of their estimated chemical prices."
https://openalex.org/W2079853033,"The formation of diketopiperazines from the dipeptides isoleucylglycine and glycylisoleucine was investigated at 132 degrees C over the pH range approximately 2 to 10. At pH 6.2, approximately 50 percent of the original dipeptides were converted to the diketopiperazines during the heating experiments. Hydrolysis of the diketopiperazines can yield either the original dipetide or an inverted dipeptide product. The isoleucine in the diketopiperazines was the most highly epimerized component in the system. Previous racemization and epimerization studies with dipeptides have not taken into account the formation of diketopiperazines and, as a result, the cortclusions about the mechanism and geochemical implications of amino acid racemization in dipeptides will require revision."
https://openalex.org/W2051064988,"The velocity of compressional waves and electrical resistivity in granite in situ measured in two 3-kilometer boreholes exhibits very little variation with depth, in contrast with the variation predicted from laboratory measurements on dry samples. These observations can be explained either by the absence of small open cracks in the rocks in situ or by the effects of complete saturation with water. The seismic velocities of many granites at shallow depths in the earth's crust may be significantly larger than was previously believed. Other properties are also affected; correction for the effect of cracks on thermal conductivity raises the average heat flow in shield areas by as much as 20 percent."
https://openalex.org/W2094129531,"The values of length of synodic month, obtained from tidally controlled periodical growth patterns in mollusks and stromatolites for several geologic periods, indicate that the deceleration rate of the earth's rotation has not been constant. Two breaks in slope, in the Pennsylvanian and Cretaceous, may be related to changes in distribution of continents, oceans, and adjacent shallow seas."
https://openalex.org/W1999786920,Strong atmospheric acoustic-gravity waves were recorded by sensitive microbarographs and seismographs at large distances from the Mount St. Helens eruption of 18 May 1980. Wave signatures were similar to those of waves from large nuclear explosions. Independent theoretical and empirical analyses indicate that the explosive yield of the eruption was approximately 35 megatons.
https://openalex.org/W2047097609,"Germinal and somatic functions in Tetrahymena are performed separately by the micro- and macronuclei, respectively. Cells with haploid micronuclei were mated with diploids to yield monosomic progeny. These were induced to undergo a form of self-fertilization, generating cells lacking both copies of one or more of the five chromosomes in the micronucleus while still possessing a complete macronuclear genome."

https://openalex.org/W2092350111,"Extensive plant damage from the 18 May 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens was largely restricted to acaulescent andprostrate dicot species in the ashfall area east of the Cascade Range (more than 150 kilometersfrom the vent). Veratrum californicum, a large monocot, displayed widespread stem death through mechanical overloading of the plant's clasping leaves. The ash surface in this area presents new opportunities for both seeds and seed predators."
https://openalex.org/W1991890136,"A crystal deformation twin may be visualized to form and grow the movement of partial dislocations only if the twinning dislocations especially distributed to give an invariant shear. One consequence of this requirement is that, if a critical resolved twinning stress exists in the same sense twinning as for slip, this stress depends on the reciprocal thickness of the twin. This type of model for twinning may be developed through the use of relatively unknown disclinations, in particular, the wedge dislocation."
https://openalex.org/W2090653482,"Sebright cocks develop a female feathering pattern but revert to normal male feathering after castration. Administration of testosterone to castrated cocks causes male comb development and reappearance of female feathering. Dihydrotes-tosterone treatment supports development of a male comb but does not induce female feathering. Since testosterone but not dihydrotestosterone is converted to estradiol in the skin of the Sebright, the female feathering appears to be the result of increased conversion of testosterone to estradiol."

https://openalex.org/W2011366042,Aggregating cells of the cellular slime mold Fonticula alba form a volcano-shaped fruiting structure which at maturity bears its spores apically in a globose mucous mass. Numerous dictyosomes forming in the sorogenic cells are involved in the accumulation and deposition of stalk material.
https://openalex.org/W2066987877,"Analysis of the observations of Neptune indicates a reciprocal mass of Pluto of 1,812,000 (0.18 Earth masses). If the density is the same as that of Earth, the diameter would be 7200 kilometers. If 6400 kilometers is accepted (from other sources) as the upper limit of the diameter, then Pluto must be at least 1.4 times as dense as Earth."

https://openalex.org/W2035459159,"The Reagan Administration wants to shift from efforts to impose direct control over the fuel cycle and nuclear technology to a framework based on cooperation and initiatives for greater political stability. A nuclear-free zone for the Middle East is one area to explore. Congress responded to this announced plan with a counter move to tighten non-proliferation strategies. Reagan's policy will be to restore the US as an aggressive, but reliable nuclear trading partner operating under adequate safeguards. Critics find this approach dangerous and contradictory. The policy is still too general to answer specific questions about bilateral arrangements, generic permits, plutonium recycling, and other matters. (DCK)"
