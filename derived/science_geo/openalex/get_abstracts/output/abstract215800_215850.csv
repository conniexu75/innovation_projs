Van Heyningen reported the occurrence of significant quantities of galactitol in the lens of galactose-fed rats, although only minor amount,s of the hexitol were located in the heart and leg muscle (2). Other tissues which were examined, blood, liver, spleen, lung, and kidney, contained no detectable amounts of galactitol. Recently, however, galactitol was isolated from the urine of two’ male, galactosemia patients (3). By utilizing the convenient and sensitive technique of gas-liquid chromatography (4, 5) for the analysis of the urine and lens of rats fed a 35% galactose-containing diet, we have confirmed the ability of normal rats to convert significant amounts of galactose to galactitol.2 In addition, however, these studies led to the detection of large amounts of free galactitol in brain and kidney tissue. It therefore became of interest to examine organs of galactosemia subjects for possible deposition of galactitol. This report describes the analysis and isolation of galactitol from the brains of two galactosemia patients."

McGinniss et al.2 reported a decrease in ’I‘ antigen strength in the red cells of adults in leukaemia, but had not tested with anti-’i‘. We have examined a case of leukaemia with weakened ’A‘ antigen in which the ’I‘ antigen was also depressed. Here, the ’i‘ antigen was stronger than in average adult cells so that the ’Ii‘ reciprocal relationship was maintained."

On the other hand, benzene produced by the metabolism of ethylene-3H and ethylene-14C contained similar amounts of the total incorporated, 1% and 4%, respectively (2). These results suggest that, in the metabolism of ethylene, a considerable port,ion of the hydrogen is removed by some dehydrogenation process, and this hydrogen proceeds along a pathway different from that followed by the carbon, as is illustrated by the labeling of toluene. Nevertheless, part of the hydrogen and carbon of ethylene is metabolized along the same pathway, as illustrated by the labeling of benzene. This postulate suggests that acetylene may be metabolized more directly to some of the same metabolit.es as ethylene. Further, acetylene is known to produce some of t.he same physiological effects as ethylene, e.g. acetylene induces flowering in pineapple plants (3) and epinasty in plants (4). The concentration of acetylene required for the latter effect is 500 times greater than that with ethylene (4). The present report is concerned with the metabolism of acetylene-% by avocado fruit. Under the same conditions used with labeled ethylene (1, 2), approximately 9 times as much acetylene-r4C as ethylene was metabolized in a 4-hour period. Two-fifths of the metabolized acetylene was found in the respiratory COZ. Approximately three-fourths of the remainder in the fruit was volatile. The benzene and toluene were concentrated and derivatives were made therefrom as in the ethylener4C experiments (2). The benzene isolated from fruit treated with acetylene contained approximately 25 times as much 14C as the benzene from ethylene-treated fruit, whereas the 14C in toluene was the same for the two treatments."
