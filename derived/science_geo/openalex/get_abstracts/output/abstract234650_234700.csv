https://openalex.org/W3003687983,"I SHOULD like to direct attention to the fact that in my article on the velocity of light and of radio waves1 the result announced by Houstoun2 was unfortunately omitted. It had not been published when my article was prepared, but could have been inserted had I noticed it in time. I was able to insert the still more recent value obtained by Bergstrand because it happened to be in the press at the same time as my article and the Editors brought it to my notice."

https://openalex.org/W2051911233,"THE barnacle Chthamalus stellatus Poli is found on the shores of the British Isles west of a line running from Dunnet Head (Caithness) to Swanage in Dorset. It penetrates the Irish Sea northwards as far as Dublin and Anglesea, but is reported as absent from the Isle of Man, as well as from the eastern part of the English Channel and from the North Sea coast1. Its occurrence appeared to be connected, in some unknown way, with Atlantic as opposed to North Sea water1. It is, however, possible to suggest tentatively a simple explanation."

https://openalex.org/W1988579947,"THE process for fixation of the intermediate products of alcoholic fermentation by living cells, discovered by Neuberg with the aid of bisulphite, has limitations on account of the toxicity and low power of the salt. Semicarbazide, dimedone and hydrazine are of no more use than bisulphite. But, by the aid of bisulphite, it has been possible to obtain useful results on some fundamental aspects of certain biological processes."
https://openalex.org/W2002131306,"ON June 28, 1877, the Russian chemist, Kern, claimed1 to have discovered a new element in platinum residues. A solution left after the removal of platinum, iridium and rhodium was concentrated with ammonium chloride and nitrate and gave a dark red precipitate. On ignition, this left a grey spongy mass that fused in the oxyhydrogen flame to a silvery ingot of a new metal which Kern called ‘davyum’ (Da), as he himself says, in honour of the great English chemist. Only 0.27 gm. of davyum was obtained and its density was given as 9.385 at 25° C."
https://openalex.org/W2036526998,"THE configuration of the C/D ring fusion in equilenin has been the subject of a number of communications1–3. We consider that the arguments advanced for a trans ring junction leave much to be desired. Shoppee's1 conclusion that the dehydrogenation of equilin to equilenin under mild conditions proves the steric identity of the C/D union in these two substances can no longer be accepted, since isoequilin, which is now known4,5 to be also trans, gives isoequilenin (which has the opposite C/D configuration to equilenin) under the same conditions6."
https://openalex.org/W2066536650,"THE iodimetric estimation of procaine penicillin presents difficulties because of the interaction of procaine with iodine. Sodium penicillin to which an equivalent weight of procaine hydrochloride has been added gives results which may be from 3 to 5 per cent lower than for the untreated penicillin. Although the ferricyanide method of Hiscox1 is said to be free from the above objection, we could not obtain consistent results with it, a spread of ± 4 per cent being obtained in a series of determinations on a sample of sodium penicillin. The removal of the procaine ion by precipitation followed by iodimetric determination of the penicillin seemed the most promising line of attack, and sodium silicomolybdate and sodium silicotungstate were both found suitable for this purpose, although the latter possesses certain advantages over the former and is obtainable commercially. Both substances give with procaine salts heavy precipitates which are granular in the presence of sodium chloride (3 per cent) and can readily be centrifuged to a compact mass permitting decantation of the supernatant liquid. Precipitation is virtually complete, and neither precipitant has any action upon iodine or penicillin."
https://openalex.org/W156752678,"IN 1940 we described the conversion of equilin, through 7-ketoœstrone, 7-hydroxyœstrone and 7-chloroœstrone, to its Δ6 double bond isomer1. The specific rotation [α]D24 of this compound was then reported by us as +150° (in dioxane). Dr. St. Kaufmann, of Syntex, S.A., has kindly directed our attention to the widely divergent value (−127°) given by an otherwise apparently identical preparation obtained in that Laboratory from Δ4-androstenedione (cf. preceding communication by Rosenkranz et al.). A check determination now carried out on a small reference sample of Δ6-isoequilin still in our possession gave −120°, in fair agreement with the value of Rosenkranz et al. This preparation (m.p. 258–261°, corr.) did not depress the melting point of a specimen of 6-dehydroœstrone obtained from Dr. Kaufmann which in our hands melted at 257–260°; likewise, the melting point of a mixture of the respective 3-benzoates (m.p. 201°, 200°) was not depressed. It is clear, therefore, that the positive rotation figure originally recorded by us was in error, and that the two compounds in question are identical in every respect."

https://openalex.org/W2074962657,"THIS note deals with the micro-fossil investigation of a sample of magnesian sandstone carried on at the instance of Prof. B. Sahni (then on tour in the United States) in 1948. The work was done with the view of checking the results quoted by Ghosh, Sen and Bose1 referring to the recovery of carbonized pieces of wood with uni- to multi-seriate bordered pits from Magnesian Sandstone Sample 6292 collected from the eastern part of the Salt Range."

https://openalex.org/W2001078638,"IT was recently shown1 that the reaction of arylureas and aromatic sulphonyl chlorides in pyridine under restrained conditions does not yield arylsulphonyl arylureas but occurs with simultaneous dehydration, and results in the formation of arylsulphonyl arylcyanamides in good yields. The production of the appropriate substituted melamines was also observed in some cases2. In continuation of this work, the interaction of sulphonyl chlorides and arylthioureas has been examined."

https://openalex.org/W2018187110,"DENSITIES of slow neutrons in extended media may be measured by graphical1 or physical2 integration of the β-activity induced by neutron capture in a detecting element distributed in the medium. The combination of Szilard–Chalmers concentration with physical integration greatly increases the available intensity3. Manganese, as permanganate ion, is an eminently suitable detector4,5. The bulk of the induced activity is found in the manganese dioxide fraction, which is isolated by simple filtration. This activity is a measure of the average neutron density."

https://openalex.org/W2056460319,"ACCORDING to the accepted constitution of the diazonium ion, a nitrogen atom takes the place of three hydrogen atoms in a substituted ammonium ion. It is accordingly conceivable that there may be resonance between the two forms: By labelling one of the nitrogen atoms, we have shown that such resonance does not, in fact, occur."
