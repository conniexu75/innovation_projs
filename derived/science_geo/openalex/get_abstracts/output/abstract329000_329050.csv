https://openalex.org/W2045469782,"A standard, based on the set of ocean water samples used by Epstein and Mayeda to obtain a reference standard for oxygen-18 data, but defined relative to the National Bureau of Standards isotopic reference water sample, is proposed for reporting both deuterium and oxygen-18 variations in natural waters relative to the same water. The range of absolute concentrations of both isotopes in meteoric-waters is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2078471453,"Many herbivorous insects have generalized diets over the species' entire geographical ranges but they function as specialists with restricted diets in local communities. Local feeding specialization can be produced by biochemical, behavioral, ecological, and evolutionary processes. Much evidence is incompatible with the widely held assumptions that diet breadth is a species characteristic and that specialization among herbivorous insects implies greater efficiency and less niche overlap."

X-ray and electron-diffraction examinations prove the existence of diamond in this material. The mechanism proposed for the formation of diamond under these conditions is simple compression in the c-axis direction of the rhombohedral form of graphite."
https://openalex.org/W2027155571,"From chemical analyses of ancient glasses found in Europe, Western Asia, and Africa from roughly the 15th century B.C. until the 12th century A.D., five main compositional categories have become apparent. With the possible exception of lead glasses which are only occasionally encountered in finds from this period, each of the main categories was prevalent over a wide geographic area for a period of at least several centuries. The categories are described in terms of the expected ranges of concentrations of the five elements, magnesium, potassium, manganese, antimony, and lead, which most clearly differentiate the groups."
https://openalex.org/W2020833277,"Alpine plants of Oxyria digyna have higher apparent photosynthesis rates at various carbon dioxide concentrations than arctic, sea-level plants of the same species. The ability to utilize carbon dioxide effectively at low concentrations may be involved in the survival of plants at high elevations."
https://openalex.org/W1990530958,The morphology of complex deposits of Pleistocene sediments covering the upper continental slope between Lindenkohl Canyon and South Toms Canyon results from both depositional and erosional processes. Small slump or slide features were detected primarily on the flanks of canyons or valleys and were observed to occur only within Pleistocene-aged sediments. Eocene to Miocene sediments are exposed over much of the mid- and lower slope in this area.
https://openalex.org/W1976393533,"Dimorphism in Aedes stimulans, a northern floodwater mosquito, may be decreased possibly to obliteration by exposing larvae for most of their lives to abnormally high temperature. Determiners for maleness fail to express themselves when larvae are exposed to a temperature of 29 degrees C throughout their lives. Not only are male characteristics eliminated, but normal female ones such as ovaries, spermathecae, and cerci develop. The resultant adult is structurally a female. Forms showing characteristics of both sexes occur when the number of days of exposure to 29 degrees C is lessened."
https://openalex.org/W2028683423,The rate of deposition of deep-sea deposits collected at the depths of 6215 to 8450 m in the western part of the North Pacific Ocean was estimated by means of the ionium/thorium ratio. The ratio was determined by an alpha-ray spectrometer. Results showed the rate of 0.5 to 0.8 mm/10(3) yr for the upper 10-cm layer below the sea bottom.
https://openalex.org/W2001827564,A method is described for greatly increasing the efficiency of Büchner funnels by utilizing a much larger fraction of the filter paper surface. The method also makes it possible to use Millipore filters efficiently on Büchner funnels.

https://openalex.org/W1964176020,S. Pizzo of the Duke University Medical Center examined 17 women who had developed blood clots after taking oral contraceptives to determine if these women had a low level of plasminogen activator in their blood. Plasminogen activator is a substance which has the ability to break down blood clots. Pizzo and his associates developed a test for assessing the level of plasminogen activator in the blood. The 17 women had only 1/4 as much of the substance in their blood as a group of 29 controls. In another investigation Pizzo measured plasminogen activator levels before and after women participated in a 10 week exercise program. The level of plasminogen activator in the total group was 50% higher at the end of the program than before the program. Among those women who had the lowest levels prior to the program the level increased by 250% by the end of trhe program. Pizza was unwilling on the basis of these preliminary studies to claim that exercise can reduce the risk of blood clots for oral contraceptive users. Other substances such as antihrombin 3 also play a role in blood clotting and further investigations are needed.
