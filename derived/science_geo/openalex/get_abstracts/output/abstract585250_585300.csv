https://openalex.org/W2608920382,"The timing of puberty is a highly polygenic childhood trait that is epidemiologically associated with various adult diseases. Using 1000 Genomes Project-imputed genotype data in up to ∼370,000 women, we identify 389 independent signals (P < 5 × 10-8) for age at menarche, a milestone in female pubertal development. In Icelandic data, these signals explain ∼7.4% of the population variance in age at menarche, corresponding to ∼25% of the estimated heritability. We implicate ∼250 genes via coding variation or associated expression, demonstrating significant enrichment in neural tissues. Rare variants near the imprinted genes MKRN3 and DLK1 were identified, exhibiting large effects when paternally inherited. Mendelian randomization analyses suggest causal inverse associations, independent of body mass index (BMI), between puberty timing and risks for breast and endometrial cancers in women and prostate cancer in men. In aggregate, our findings highlight the complexity of the genetic regulation of puberty timing and support causal links with cancer susceptibility."

https://openalex.org/W2609045225,"Background It remains an enigma whether gestational hypertension (GH) and pre-eclampsia (PE) are distinct entities or different spectrum of the same disease. We aimed to compare the risk factors and outcomes between GH and PE. Method A total of 7,633 pregnant women recruited between 12 and 20 weeks of gestation in the Ottawa and Kingston Birth Cohort from 2002 to 2009 were included in the analysis. Cox proportional hazards model was used to identify and compare the risk factors for GH and PE by treating gestational age at delivery as the survival time. Logistic regression model was used to compare outcome. Subgroup analysis was performed for early- and late-onset PE. Results GH and PE shared most risk factors including overweight and obesity, nulliparity, PE history, type 1 and 2 diabetes, and twin birth. Effect size of PE history (RR = 14.1 for GH vs. RR = 6.4 for PE) and twin birth (RR = 4.8 for GH vs. RR = 10.3 for PE) showed substantial difference. Risk factors modified gestational age at delivery in patients with GH and PE in similar pattern. Subgroup analysis showed that early- and late-onset PE shared some risk factors with different effect sizes, whereas folic acid supplementation showed protective effect for early-onset PE only. PE was strongly associated with several adverse outcomes including cesarean section, placental abruption, small for gestational age, preterm birth, and 5 min Apgar score < 7, whereas GH was associated with increased risk of preterm birth only. Conclusions GH and PE shared common risk factors. Differences in effect sizes of risk factors and outcomes indicate that the conditions may have different pathophysiology and mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2608293934,"People generally show greater preference for members of their own racial group compared to racial out-group members. This type of 'in-group bias' is evident in mimicry behaviors. We tend to automatically mimic the behaviors of in-group members, and this behavior is associated with interpersonal sensitivity and empathy. However, mimicry is reduced when interacting with out-group members. Although race is considered an unchangeable trait, it is possible using embodiment in immersive virtual reality to engender the illusion in people of having a body of a different race. Previous research has used this technique to show that after a short period of embodiment of White people in a Black virtual body their implicit racial bias against Black people diminishes. Here we show that this technique powerfully enhances mimicry. We carried out an experiment with 32 White (Caucasian) female participants. Half were embodied in a White virtual body and the remainder in a Black virtual body. Each interacted in two different sessions with a White and a Black virtual character, in counterbalanced order. The results show that dyads with the same virtual body skin color expressed greater mimicry than those of different color. Importantly, this effect occurred depending on the virtual body's race, not participants' actual racial group. When embodied in a Black virtual body, White participants treat Black as their novel in-group and Whites become their novel out-group. This reversed in-group bias effect was obtained regardless of participants' level of implicit racial bias. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of this surprising psychological phenomenon."
https://openalex.org/W2609497199,"Giacomo Cavalli, Frédéric Bantignies and colleagues report the establishment of stable and isogenic Drosophila lines carrying alternative epialleles, defined by different levels of H3K27me3. They show that environmental changes modulate the expressivity of the epialleles and that epilines can be reset to a naive state, thus indicating that the inheritance of this phenotypic variability is epigenetic. Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance (TEI) describes the transmission of alternative functional states through multiple generations in the presence of the same genomic DNA sequence. Very little is known about the principles and the molecular mechanisms governing this type of inheritance. Here, by transiently enhancing 3D chromatin interactions, we established stable and isogenic Drosophila epilines that carry alternative epialleles, as defined by differential levels of Polycomb-dependent trimethylation of histone H3 Lys27 (forming H3K27me3). After being established, epialleles can be dominantly transmitted to naive flies and can induce paramutation. Importantly, epilines can be reset to a naive state by disruption of chromatin interactions. Finally, we found that environmental changes modulate the expressivity of the epialleles, and we extended our paradigm to naturally occurring phenotypes. Our work sheds light on how nuclear organization and Polycomb group (PcG) proteins contribute to epigenetically inheritable phenotypic variability."
https://openalex.org/W2607960337,"The identity of the RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) that govern cancer stem cells remains poorly characterized. The MSI2 RBP is a central regulator of translation of cancer stem cell programs. Through proteomic analysis of the MSI2-interacting RBP network and functional shRNA screening, we identified 24 genes required for in vivo leukemia. Syncrip was the most differentially required gene between normal and myeloid leukemia cells. SYNCRIP depletion increased apoptosis and differentiation while delaying leukemogenesis. Gene expression profiling of SYNCRIP-depleted cells demonstrated a loss of the MLL and HOXA9 leukemia stem cell program. SYNCRIP and MSI2 interact indirectly though shared mRNA targets. SYNCRIP maintains HOXA9 translation, and MSI2 or HOXA9 overexpression rescued the effects of SYNCRIP depletion. Altogether, our data identify SYNCRIP as a new RBP that controls the myeloid leukemia stem cell program. We propose that targeting these RBP complexes might provide a novel therapeutic strategy in leukemia."
https://openalex.org/W2609629951,"The awn is a long needle-like structure formed at the tip of the lemma in the florets of some grass species. It plays a role in seed dispersal and protection against animals, and can contribute to the photosynthetic activity of spikes. Three main dominant inhibitors of awn development (Hd, B1 and B2) are known in hexaploid wheat, but the causal genes have not been cloned yet and a genetic association with awn length diversity has been found only for the B1 allele. To analyze the prevalence of these three awning inhibitors, we attempted to predict the genotypes of 189 hexaploid wheat varieties collected worldwide using markers tightly linked to these loci. Using recombinant inbred lines derived from two common wheat cultivars, Chinese Spring and Mironovskaya 808, both with short awns, and a high-density linkage map, we performed quantitative trait locus analysis to identify tightly linked markers. Because this linkage map was constructed with abundant array-based markers, we converted the linked markers to PCR-based markers and determined the genotypes of 189 hexaploids. A significant genotype-phenotype correlation was observed at the Hd and B1 regions. We also found that interaction among these three awning inhibitors is involved in development of a membranous outgrowth at the base of awn resembling the Hooded mutants of barley. For the hooded awn phenotype, presence of the Hd dominant allele was essential but not sufficient, so B2 and other factors appear to act epistatically to produce the ectopic tissue. On the other hand, the dominant B1 allele acted as a suppressor of the hooded phenotype. These three awning inhibitors largely contribute to the genetic variation in awn length and shape of common wheat."
https://openalex.org/W2609170929,"A high-content screening platform that measures the immunological potential of small-molecule and biologic drugs by computationally determining changes in the physical interactions among peripheral mononuclear leukocytes revealed known immunomodulators and also approved drugs as regulators of unexpected targets, including MST1R. Small-molecule drugs may complement antibody-based therapies in an immune-oncology setting, yet systematic methods for the identification and characterization of the immunomodulatory properties of these entities are lacking. We surveyed the immumomodulatory potential of 1,402 small chemical molecules, as defined by their ability to alter the cell-cell interactions among peripheral mononuclear leukocytes ex vivo, using automated microscopy and population-wide single-cell image analysis. Unexpectedly, ∼10% of the agents tested affected these cell-cell interactions differentially. The results accurately recapitulated known immunomodulatory drug classes and revealed several clinically approved drugs that unexpectedly harbor the ability to modulate the immune system, which could potentially contribute to their physiological mechanism of action. For instance, the kinase inhibitor crizotinib promoted T cell interactions with monocytes, as well as with cancer cells, through inhibition of the receptor tyrosine kinase MSTR1 and subsequent upregulation of the expression of major histocompatibility complex molecules. The approach offers an attractive platform for the personalized identification and characterization of immunomodulatory therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W2608563203,"Firemaster® 550 (FM550) is a chemical mixture currently used as an additive flame retardant in commercial products, and is comprised of 2-ethylhexyl-2,3,4,5-tertrabromobenzoate (TBB), bis(2-ethylhexyl) tetrabromophthalate (TBPH), triphenyl phosphate (TPP), and isopropylated triphenyl phosphate (IPTP). Animal and in vitro studies suggest that FM550, TPP and IPTP may have adipogenic effects and may exert these effects through PPARγ activation. Using murine 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, we investigated the detailed expression of transcription factors and adipogenic markers in response to FM550 and its components. Further we investigated the mechanism of action of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) on downstream targets of the receptor by focussing on the mature adipocyte marker, adipocyte protein 2 (aP2). In addition, we set to elucidate the components responsible for the adipogenic effects seen in the FM550 mixture. We show that FM550 and its components TPP, IPTP, and TBPH, but not TBB induced lipid accumulation in a dose-dependent manner. Interestingly, despite displaying enhanced lipid accumulation, TBPH did not alter the mRNA or protein expression of terminal differentiation markers. In contrast, FM550, TPP, and IPTP treatment enhanced lipid accumulation, and mRNA and protein expression of terminal differentiation markers. To further delineate the mechanisms of action of FM550 and its components we focussed on aP2 promoter activity. For this purpose we used the enhancer region of the mouse aP2 promoter using a 584-bp reporter construct containing an active PPRE located 5.4 kb away from the transcription start site of aP2. Exposure to FM550, IPTP, and TPP significantly increased PPARγ mediated aP2 enhancer activity. Furthermore, we show that TPP- and IPTP-dependent upregulation of aP2 was significantly inhibited by the selective PPARγ antagonist GW9662. In addition, chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments showed that IPTP and TPP treatment led to the recruitment of PPARγ to the regulatory region of aP2."
https://openalex.org/W2609207702,"Objective To assess the relationship between socioeconomic status (SES) and complications of type 2 diabetes among young adults in Japan. Design A cross-sectional study. Setting Outpatient wards of 96 member hospitals and clinics of the Japan Federation of Democratic Medical Institutions. Participants A total of 782 outpatients with type 2 diabetes (525 males, 257 females), aged 20–40 years as of March 31, 2012. After excluding 110 participants whose retinopathy diagnosis was in question, 672 participants were analyzed. Measurements We examined the relations between SES (educational level, income, type of public healthcare insurance, and employment status) and diabetes complications (retinopathy and nephropathy) using a multivariate logistic regression analysis. Results The prevalence of type 2 diabetic retinopathy was 23.2%, while that of nephropathy was 8.9%. The odds of having retinopathy were higher among junior high school graduates (OR 1.91, 95% CI 1.09–3.34), patients receiving public assistance (OR 2.19, 95% CI 1.20–3.95), and patients with irregular (OR 1.72, 95% CI 1.03–2.86) or no employment (OR 2.23, 95% CI 1.36–3.68), compared to those with a higher SES, even after covariate adjustment (e.g., age, gender, body mass index). Similarly, the odds of having nephropathy were higher among patients with middle (OR 3.61, 95% CI 1.69–8.27) or low income levels (OR 2.53, 95% CI 1.11–6.07), even after covariate adjustment. Conclusions Low SES was associated with a greater likelihood of type 2 diabetes complications in young adults. These findings suggest the necessity of health policies that mitigate socioeconomic disparity and thereby reduce the prevalence of diabetic complications."
https://openalex.org/W2609764113,"Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is one of the most aggressive breast cancers without effective targeted therapies. Numerous studies have implied that KLF5 plays an important roles in TNBC. How is KLF5 regulated by microRNAs has not been well studied. Here, we demonstrated that miR-217 down-regulates the expression of KLF5 and KLF5's downstream target gene FGF-BP and Cyclin D1 in TNBC cell lines HCC1806 and HCC1937. Consequently, miR-217 suppresses TNBC cell growth, migration, and invasion. MiR-217 suppresses TNBC, at least partially, through down-regulating the KLF5 expression. These results suggest that the miR-217-KLF5 axis might serve as a potential target for treatment of TNBC."
https://openalex.org/W2609666628,"Uromodulin is the most abundant urinary protein in physiological conditions. It is exclusively produced by renal epithelial cells lining the thick ascending limb of Henle's loop (TAL) and it plays key roles in kidney function and disease. Mutations in UMOD, the gene encoding uromodulin, cause autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease uromodulin-related (ADTKD-UMOD), characterised by hyperuricemia, gout and progressive loss of renal function. While the primary effect of UMOD mutations, retention in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), is well established, its downstream effects are still largely unknown. To gain insight into ADTKD-UMOD pathogenesis, we performed transcriptional profiling and biochemical characterisation of cellular models (immortalised mouse TAL cells) of robust expression of wild type or mutant GFP-tagged uromodulin. In this model mutant uromodulin accumulation in the ER does not impact on cell viability and proliferation. Transcriptional profiling identified 109 genes that are differentially expressed in mutant cells relative to wild type ones. Up-regulated genes include several ER resident chaperones and protein disulphide isomerases. Consistently, pathway enrichment analysis indicates that mutant uromodulin expression affects ER function and protein homeostasis. Interestingly, mutant uromodulin expression induces the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR), and specifically the IRE1 branch, as shown by an increased splicing of XBP1. Consistent with UPR induction, we show increased interaction of mutant uromodulin with ER chaperones Bip, calnexin and PDI. Using metabolic labelling, we also demonstrate that while autophagy plays no role, mutant protein is partially degraded by the proteasome through ER-associated degradation. Our work demonstrates that ER stress could play a central role in ADTKD-UMOD pathogenesis. This sets the bases for future work to develop novel therapeutic strategies through modulation of ER homeostasis and associated protein degradation pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2609022924,"The calcium-dependent protein kinase (CDPK) is a ser/thr protein kinase that plays vital roles in plant growth, development, and responses to multiple stresses. Despite an important member of the stress responsive gene family, little is known about the evolutionary history and expression patterns of CDPK genes in melon. Herein, a total of 18 CDPK genes and 7 CDPK-related protein kinases (CRK) genes were identified in the melon genome via bioinformatic analysis, which were unevenly distributed across eleven chromosomes with an apparent exception for chromosome 3. Comparative syntenic analysis between Cucumis melo L. and Arabidopsis thaliana revealed that 13 CmCDPKs and 19 AtCPKs existed in 20 corresponding syntenic blocks. In addition, based on gene structure and phylogenetic analyses, all CmCDPKs were divided into four groups (CDPK I-IV) and CmCRKs clustered into one group (CRK I). Interestingly, group CDPK IV was clearly distinct from the other three CDPK groups, but clustered with CRK I on the phylogenetic tree, implying their origination from a common ancestor. Furthermore, CmCDPKand CmCRK genes were differentially expressed in response to various stimuli, such as biotic stress (Podosphaera xanthii), abiotic stress (salt and cold), and hormone (abscisic acid) treatment. To our knowledge, this is the first report on CDPK and CRK gene families in melon, which provides a basic foundation for functional characterizations of CmCDPK and CmCRK genes in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2607915959,"Patients with rheumatoid arthritis are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease. The prerequisites for reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease are adequate levels of knowledge and being aware of the risk. In this study, the levels of knowledge about cardiovascular disease among patients with rheumatoid arthritis and the perception were evaluated in relation to their actual 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease. This cross-sectional study of 200 patients with rheumatoid arthritis was conducted in a university-affiliated hospital in South Korea. The patients’ actual risk of cardiovascular disease was estimated using the Framingham Risk Score. The most common risk factor was physical inactivity, with 77% of the patients not engaging in regular exercise. The patients lacked knowledge about the effects of physical inactivity and anti-inflammatory medication on the development of cardiovascular disease. Misperceptions about the risk of cardiovascular disease were common, i.e., 19.5% of the patients underestimated their risk and 41% overestimated. Hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and smoking were the most prevalent among the patients who underestimated their risk, and these same patients had the lowest level of knowledge about cardiovascular disease. This study demonstrated the rheumatoid arthritis patients’ lack of knowledge about the effects of physical inactivity and anti-inflammatory medications on the development of cardiovascular disease, and their misperception of cardiovascular risk was common. As a preventive measure, educational programs about cardiovascular disease should be tailored specifically for patients with rheumatoid arthritis, and behavioral interventions, including routine exercise, should be made available at the time of diagnosis."
https://openalex.org/W2608557267,"Background Some probiotic strains have the potential to assist in relieving the symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease. The impact of daily ingestion of a soy-based product fermented by Enterococcus faecium CRL 183 and Lactobacillus helveticus 416 with the addition of Bifidobacterium longum ATCC 15707 on chemically induced colitis has been investigated thereof within a period of 30 days. Methods Colitis was induced by dextran sulfate sodium. The animals were randomly assigned into five groups: Group C: negative control; Group CL: positive control; Group CLF: DSS with the fermented product; Group CLP: DSS with the non-fermented product (placebo); Group CLS: DSS with sulfasalazine. The following parameters were monitored: disease activity index, fecal microbial analyses, gastrointestinal survival of probiotic microorganisms and short-chain fatty acids concentration in the feces. At the end of the protocol the animals’ colons were removed so as to conduct a macroscopical and histopathological analysis, cytokines and nitrite quantification. Results Animals belonging to the CLF group showed fewer symptoms of colitis during the induction period and a lower degree of inflammation and ulceration in their colon compared to the CL, CLS and CLP groups (p<0.05). The colon of the animals in groups CL and CLS presented severe crypt damage, which was absent in CLF and CLP groups. A significant increase in the population of Lactobacillus spp. and Bifidobacterium spp. at the end of the protocol was verified only in the CLF animals (p<0.05). This group also showed an increase in short-chain fatty acids (propionate and acetate). Furthermore, the intestinal survival of E. faecium CRL 183 and B. longum ATCC 15707 in the CLF group has been confirmed by biochemical and molecular analyzes. Conclusions The obtained results suggest that a regular intake of the probiotic product, and placebo to a lesser extent, can reduce the severity of DSS-induced colitis on rats."
https://openalex.org/W2608898995,"Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) is the commonest gestational liver disease. The risk of adverse fetal outcome has been associated with the severity of maternal hypercholanemia after diagnosis.To investigate whether there is a relationship between the severity and timing of onset of hypercholanemia and the risk of meconium-stained amniotic fluid (MSAF) and adverse neonatal events.The study included 382 pregnancies complicated by ICP managed at a referral hospital in Buenos Aires (Argentina) between June 2009 and December 2013. The patients were classified into three groups according to the severity of hypercholanemia at diagnosis; mild (10-19.9 μmol/L), moderate (20-39.9 μmol/L) and severe (≥40 μmol/L). Their clinical characteristics and pregnancy outcomes were investigated in a prospective observational study.Higher risk of MSAF was observed when ICP appeared early in gestation or when hypercholanemia was more severe. Taking both parameters into account an MSAF risk factor (MRF) was defined. Based on a model of positive/negative predictive values, a cut-off point of MRF = 3 was selected, which prioritized sensitivity versus specificity. In ICP patients with MRF>3, the probability of MSAF was enhanced 4-fold. An increase in the frequency of MSAF was also associated with higher serum levels at diagnosis of alanine transaminase, alkaline phosphatase and direct bilirubin.The risk of MSAF is associated not only with the magnitude of hypercholanemia at diagnosis but also with the early gestational onset of raised maternal serum bile acids."
https://openalex.org/W2608203018,"Background The clinical syndrome of disseminated nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) infection in patients who were previously healthy is now well recognized to be associated with an acquired autoantibody to Interferon gamma (Anti IFN- γ autoantibody). However, the risk factors of this syndrome remain unknown. Method We performed an unmatched case control study among patients with NTM diseases who were diagnosed and treated at Siriraj Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand. Anti-IFN autoantibody was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. Cases were patients with NTM diseases and detectable anti IFN- γ autoantibody. Controls were randomly selected from those with undetectable anti IFN- γ autoantibody. Data from both groups including demographic data, clinical presentation, laboratory results, other risk factors and HLA genotypes were collected. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify independent risk factors for this syndrome. Results 70 cases (mean age 50 ± 11 years) and 70 controls (mean age 58 ± 18 years) were enrolled into the study. Mycobacterial abscessus was the most common NTM pathogen found in both groups (72.9% in cases and 41.4% in controls respectively). However, disseminated NTM disease was significantly more common in cases (92.9%) than in the controls (14.3%, p<0.001). Binary logistic regression analysis showed that previous OIs (adjusted OR14.87, 95% CI 2.36–93.86), birthplace outside Central region (adjusted OR 19.19, 95% CI 3.86–95.35), lack of comorbidities lead to immunosuppression, such as HIV infection or diabetes mellitus (adjusted OR 23.68, 95% CI 4.01–139.94), and presence of HLA DRB1*15/16 (adjusted OR 153.28, 95% CI 16.87–139.88) were independent factors associated with this syndrome. Conclusion Patients with NTM disease associated with anti IFN- γ autoantibody are almost always previously healthy and HIV negative. Most of these patients presented with disseminated NTM disease with generalized lymphadenitis and often with reactive skin lesions. Factors associated with detectable anti IFN- γ autoantibody are HLA-DRB1 and DQB1 alleles, and history of previous OIs in patients without comorbidity that leads to immunosuppression. Further studies are needed to better understand these associations and to improve the treatment outcome."
https://openalex.org/W2609340873,"RNA aptamers are oligonucleotides that bind with high specificity and affinity to target ligands. In the absence of bound ligand, secondary structures of RNA aptamers are generally stable, but single-stranded and loop regions, including ligand binding sites, lack defined structures and exist as ensembles of conformations. For example, the well-characterized theophylline-binding aptamer forms a highly stable binding site when bound to theophylline, but the binding site is unstable and disordered when theophylline is absent. Experimental methods have not revealed at atomic resolution the conformations that the theophylline aptamer explores in its unbound state. Consequently, in the present study we applied 21 microseconds of molecular dynamics simulations to structurally characterize the ensemble of conformations that the aptamer adopts in the absence of theophylline. Moreover, we apply Markov state modeling to predict the kinetics of transitions between unbound conformational states. Our simulation results agree with experimental observations that the theophylline binding site is found in many distinct binding-incompetent states and show that these states lack a binding pocket that can accommodate theophylline. The binding-incompetent states interconvert with binding-competent states through structural rearrangement of the binding site on the nanosecond to microsecond timescale. Moreover, we have simulated the complete theophylline binding pathway. Our binding simulations supplement prior experimental observations of slow theophylline binding kinetics by showing that the binding site must undergo a large conformational rearrangement after the aptamer and theophylline form an initial complex, most notably, a major rearrangement of the C27 base from a buried to solvent-exposed orientation. Theophylline appears to bind by a combination of conformational selection and induced fit mechanisms. Finally, our modeling indicates that when Mg2+ ions are present the population of binding-competent aptamer states increases more than twofold. This population change, rather than direct interactions between Mg2+ and theophylline, accounts for altered theophylline binding kinetics."

This study aimed to investigate the therapeutic effects of the prebiotic isomalto-oligosaccharides (IMO) on visceral hypersensitivity (VHS) in rats and to explore potential mechanism.Water avoidance stress (WAS) was used to induce VHS in rats. The score for the abdominal withdrawal reflex (AWR) was determined while colorectal distension and compared between VHS group and control group in order to validate VHS preparation. Rats with VHS were then divided into an IMO-treated group (intragastric 5% IMO, 2 mL/d, 14 days) and a water-control group (intragastric water). After treatment, AWR score and intestinal transit rate (ITR) were determined, stool culture was performed, the ultrastructure of the ileum epithelium was observed with scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and serum cytokines were measured.WAS significantly increased AWR score responding to colorectal distension, and lowered the pain threshold. IMO treatment improved VHS with a reduction in AWR score on graded colorectal distension and an increase in pain threshold. SEM showed damages on the ileal epithelial ultrastructure in VHS rats, which was attenuated by IMO treatment. ITR, fecal microbiota and serum cytokine levels were comparable among control group, water-control group, and IMO-treated rats.In this randomized placebo-controlled study, the results showed that IMO ameliorated WAS-induced visceral hyperalgesia in rats, this effect may be attributed to the repair of damages on intestinal epithelial ultrastructure."

In the whole sample, the mean Audit-C score was 1.6 for men and 1.1 for women; only 5.5% of men and 7.1% of women had a hazardous alcohol consumption with an Audit-C score of respectively ≥4 and ≥3. Multivariate regression modeling revealed that regular alcohol use was more likely in individuals who were men, were younger, had a lower body-mass index, were active smokers, were habitual coffee drinkers, and who were resident physicians or medical students rather than healthcare-professions students. This finding identifies a need to assess alcohol use in medical-profession workers in order to identify risky behavior early on and to carry out rapidly effective preventive and curative interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2609783498,"Given the social importance of intracranial aneurysm as a major cause of a lethal subarachnoid hemorrhage, clarification of mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of this disease is essential for improving poor prognosis once after rupture. Previous histopathological analyses of human aneurysm walls have revealed the presence of T cells in lesions suggesting involvement of this type of cell in the pathogenesis. However, it remains unclear whether T cell actively participates in intracranial aneurysm progression. To examine whether T cell is involved in aneurysm progression, intracranial aneurysm model of rat was used. In this model, aneurysm is induced by increase in hemodynamic force loaded on bifurcation site of intracranial arteries where aneurysms are developed. Deficiency in T cells and pharmacological inhibition of T cell function were applied to this model. CD3-positive T cells were present in human aneurysm walls, whose number was significantly larger compared with that in control arterial walls. Deficiency in T cells in rats and pharmacological inhibition of T cell function by oral administration of Cyclosporine A both failed to affect intracranial aneurysm progression, degenerative changes of arterial walls and macrophage infiltration in lesions. Although T cells are detectable in intracranial aneurysm walls, their function is dispensable for macrophage-mediated inflammation and degenerative changes in arterial walls, which presumably leads to intracranial aneurysm progression."

The dynamic electrical properties of FBHZ in different solvent media are reported. Its molecular properties are closely related to supramolecular features; accordingly, we analysed all its crystal structure properties via intermolecular interactions in the solid state, using X-ray crystallography data and Hirshfeld surface (HS), including thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and hot-stage microscopy (HSM), where the results reveal crystal stability in respect to temperature variation."
https://openalex.org/W2607541742,"Type 1 diabetes and thyroid disease are T cell-dependent autoimmune endocrinopathies. The standard substitutive administration of the deficient hormones does not halt the autoimmune process; therefore, development of immunotherapies aiming to preserve the residual hormonal cells, is of crucial importance. PTPN22 C1858T mutation encoding for the R620W lymphoid tyrosine phosphatase variant, plays a potential pathophysiological role in autoimmunity. The PTPN22 encoded protein Lyp is a negative regulator of T cell antigen receptor signaling; R620W variant, leading to a gain of function with paradoxical reduced T cell activation, may represent a valid therapeutic target. We aimed to develop novel wild type PTPN22 short interfering RNA duplexes (siRNA) and optimize their delivery into Jurkat T cells and PBMC by using liposomal carriers. Conformational stability, size and polydispersion of siRNA in lipoplexes was measured by CD spectroscopy and DLS. Lipoplexes internalization and toxicity evaluation was assessed by confocal microscopy and flow cytometry analysis. Their effect on Lyp expression was evaluated by means of Western Blot and confocal microscopy. Functional assays through engagement of TCR signaling were established to evaluate biological consequences of down-modulation. Both Jurkat T cells and PBMC were efficiently transfected by stable custom lipoplexes. Jurkat T cell morphology and proliferation was not affected. Lipoplexes incorporation was visualized in CD3+ but also in CD3- peripheral blood immunotypes without signs of toxicity, damage or apoptosis. Efficacy in affecting Lyp protein expression was demonstrated in both transfected Jurkat T cells and PBMC. Moreover, impairment of Lyp inhibitory activity was revealed by increase of IL-2 secretion in culture supernatants of PBMC following anti-CD3/CD28 T cell receptor-driven stimulation.

Cell adhesion to fibronectin is mediated by αvβ3 and α5β1 integrins through an RGD motif present in this ECM protein, thus making these receptors key targets for cell migration studies. Here we investigated the effect of an RGD disintegrin, DisBa-01, on the migration of human fibroblasts (BJ) and oral squamous cancer cells (OSCC, SCC25) on a fibronectin-rich environment. Time-lapse images were acquired on fibronectin-coated glass-bottomed dishes. Migration speed and directionality analysis indicated that OSCC cells, but not fibroblasts, showed significant decrease in both parameters in the presence of DisBa-01 (1μM and 2μM). Integrin expression levels of the α5, αv and β3 subunits were similar in both cell lines, while β1 subunit is present in lower levels on the cancer cells. Next, we examined whether the effects of DisBa-01 were related to changes in adhesion properties by using paxillin immunostaining and total internal reflection fluorescence TIRF microscopy. OSCCs in the presence of DisBa-01 showed increased adhesion sizes and number of maturing adhesion. The same parameters were analyzed usingβ3-GFP overexpressing cells and showed that β3 overexpression restored cell migration velocity and the number of maturing adhesion that were altered by DisBa-01. Surface plasmon resonance analysis showed that DisBa-01 has 100x higher affinity for αvβ3 integrin than forα5β1 integrin. In conclusion, our results suggest that the αvβ3 integrin is the main receptor involved in cell directionality and its blockage may be an interesting alternative against metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2607762545,"The bacterial community composition in water and sediment samples during the decomposition of Microcystis biomass were analyzed using the 454 pyrosequencing technique. We found dramatic shifts in the bacterial community composition of water and sediments after the addition of Microcystis biomass. Among all the detected phyla, only Firmicutes was found to be dominant in both water and sediment samples. The genus Clostridium sensu stricto was the absolutely dominant group in Firmicutes and showed drastic variations with incubation time during the decomposition process. Peak values in relative abundance of Clostridium sensu stricto appeared in the first few days for water and sediment samples. Environmental factors such as pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in water samples showed drastic variations during the decomposing process, which might be the prominent forces driving the variation of bacterial communities. The abundant genus, Clostridium sensu stricto, were thought to be well adapted to higher DOC and turbidity and lower pH and DO conditions. Compared with the sediment samples, the decomposition of Microcystis biomass had greater influence on the bacterial community composition in water and Clostridium sensu stricto might play important roles in the process of Microcystis biomass decomposition."

Sepsis is a syndrome of systemic manifestations induced by infection of any organisms; including bacterial, fungal and viral agents. Here, we investigated the diagnosis, management and outcomes of dengue patients presenting with sepsis in a prospective study of community-acquired sepsis in Thailand.From June to December 2015, 874 adult patients (age≥18 years) with suspected or documented community-acquired infection, with ≥3 diagnostic criteria for sepsis according to the Surviving Sepsis Campaign 2012, and within 24 hours of admission were evaluated. Serum was stored and later tested for dengue PCR assays.A total of 126 patients had dengue PCR assays positive (2 DENV-1, 12 DENV-2, 24 DENV-3 and 88 DENV-4), and 5 of them (4%) died. We found that attending physicians suspected dengue infection on admission in 84 patients (67%), and recorded dengue infection as the final diagnosis in 96 patients (76%). Four of five fatal cases were diagnosed and treated as septic shock not due to dengue. In multivariable analysis, there was a trend showing that age≥60 years, hypoxemia and misdiagnosis of dengue by attending physicians were associated with 28-day mortality.A number of adult patients who died of dengue are misdiagnosed as severe sepsis and septic shock. Diagnosis of dengue based on clinical features alone is difficult. Rapid diagnostic tests for dengue may need to be routinely used in adult patients presenting with sepsis and septic shock in tropical countries. This approach could improve diagnosis and management of those patients."

https://openalex.org/W2610036708,"Auditioning is at the very center of educational and professional life in music and is associated with significant psychophysical demands. Knowledge of how these demands affect cardiovascular responses to psychosocial pressure is essential for developing strategies to both manage stress and understand optimal performance states. To this end, we recorded the electrocardiograms (ECGs) of 16 musicians (11 violinists and 5 flutists) before and during performances in both low- and high-stress conditions: with no audience and in front of an audition panel, respectively. The analysis consisted of the detection of R-peaks in the ECGs to extract heart rate variability (HRV) from the notoriously noisy real-world ECGs. Our data analysis approach spanned both standard (temporal and spectral) and advanced (structural complexity) techniques. The complexity science approaches-namely, multiscale sample entropy and multiscale fuzzy entropy-indicated a statistically significant decrease in structural complexity in HRV from the low- to the high-stress condition and an increase in structural complexity from the pre-performance to performance period, thus confirming the complexity loss theory and a loss in degrees of freedom due to stress. Results from the spectral analyses also suggest that the stress responses in the female participants were more parasympathetically driven than those of the male participants. In conclusion, our findings suggest that interventions to manage stress are best targeted at the sensitive pre-performance period, before an audition begins."
https://openalex.org/W2609564262,"To assess whether cerebellar volumes changes could represent a sensitive outcome measure in primary-progressive MS.Changes in cerebellar volumes over one-year follow-up, estimated in 26 primary-progressive MS patients and 20 controls with Freesurfer longitudinal pipeline, were assessed using Wilcoxon test and tested for their correlation with disability worsening by a logistic regression. Clinical worsening was defined as EDSS score increase or change of >20% for 25-foot walk test or 9-hole peg test scores at follow-up. Sample sizes for given treatment effects and power were calculated. The findings were validated in an independent cohort of 20 primary-progressive MS patients.Significant changes were detected in brain T1 lesion volume (p<0.01), cerebellar T2 and T1 lesion volume (p<0.01 and p<0.05), cerebellar volume, cerebellar cortex volume, and cerebellar WM volume (p<0.001). Only cerebellar volume and cerebellar cortex volume percentage change were significantly reduced in clinically progressed patients when compared to patients who did not progress (p<0.01; respectively AUC of 0.91 and 0.96). Cerebellar volume percentage changes were consistent in the exploration and validation cohorts (cerebellar volume -1.90±1.11% vs -1.47±2.30%; cerebellar cortex volume -1.68±1.41% vs -1.56±2.23%). Based on our results the numbers of patients required to detect a 30% effect are 81 per arm for cerebellar volume and 162 per arm for cerebellar cortex volume (90% power, type 1 error alpha = 0.05).Our results suggest a role for cerebellar cortex volume and cerebellar volume as potential short-term imaging metrics to monitor treatment effect in primary-progressive MS clinical trials."
https://openalex.org/W2608461297,"Heme has been characterized as potent trigger of inflammation. In hemostasis, although heme has been shown to both induce and inhibit different compartments of hemostasis, its net effect on the hemostatic balance, and the biological relevance of these effects remain to be determined. Herein we evaluated the effect of heme on hemostasis using a global assay able to generate clinically relevant data in several other complex hemostatic diseases. Citrated whole blood samples from healthy participants were stimulated by heme or vehicle and incubated for 4h at 37°C. Rotational thromboelastometry was immediately performed. The participation of tissue factor in coagulation activation was evaluated using inhibitory antibody. Heme was able of inducing ex vivo coagulation activation in whole blood, affecting predominantly parameters associated with the initial phases of clot formation. This activation effect was at least partially dependent on hematopoietic tissue factor, since the effects of heme were partially abrogated by the inhibition of human tissue factor. In conclusion, using a global hemostasis assay, our study confirmed that heme is able to activate coagulation in whole blood, in a tissue factor-dependent way. These findings could explain the disturbance in hemostatic balance observed in conditions associated with the release of heme such as sickle cell disease."
https://openalex.org/W2610099256,"Knowledge on insecticide resistance in Anopheles species is a basic requirement to guide malaria vector control programs. In Lao PDR, vector control relies on insecticide residual spraying (IRS) and impregnated bed-nets (ITNs) with the use of pyrethroids. Here, the susceptibility of Anopheles species, including several malaria vectors (An. maculatus and An. minimus), to various insecticides was investigated in ten provinces of Lao PDR through a north-south transect. Bioassays were performed on field caught female mosquitoes using the standard WHO susceptibility tests with DDT (4%), deltamethrin (0.05%) and permethrin (0.75%). In addition, the DIIS6 region of the para-type sodium channel gene was amplified and sequenced to identify knockdown resistance mutations (kdr). Resistance to DDT and permethrin was detected in suspected malaria vectors, such as An. nivipes and An. philippinensis in Lao PDR. Resistance to the formerly used DDT was found in a population of An. maculatus s.l. from Luang Prabang province. No resistance to pyrethroids was found in primary vectors, indicating that these insecticides are still adequate for malaria vector control. However, high resistance levels to pyrethroids was found in-vector species and reduced susceptibility to permethrin in An. minimus and An. maculatus was reported in specific localities which raises concerns for pyrethroid-based control in the future. No kdr mutation was found in any of the resistant populations tested hence suggesting a probable role detoxification enzymes in resistance. This study highlights the necessity to continue the monitoring of insecticide susceptibility to early detect potential occurrence and/or migration of insecticide resistance in malaria vectors in Lao PDR."
https://openalex.org/W2608677323,"Anterior-posterior (AP) body segmentation of the fruit fly (Drosophila) is first seen in the 7-stripe spatial expression patterns of the pair-rule genes, which regulate downstream genes determining specific segment identities. Regulation of pair-rule expression has been extensively studied for the even-skipped (eve) gene. Recent live imaging, of a reporter for the 2nd eve stripe, has demonstrated the stochastic nature of this process, with ‘bursts’ in the number of RNA transcripts being made over time. We developed a stochastic model of the spatial and temporal expression of eve stripe 2 (binding by transcriptional activators (Bicoid and Hunchback proteins) and repressors (Giant and Krüppel proteins), transcriptional initiation and termination; with all rate parameters constrained by features of the experimental data) in order to analyze the noisy experimental time series and test hypotheses for how eve transcription is regulated. These include whether eve transcription is simply OFF or ON, with a single ON rate, or whether it proceeds by a more complex mechanism, with multiple ON rates. We find that both mechanisms can produce long (multi-minute) RNA bursts, but that the short-time (minute-to-minute) statistics of the data is indicative of eve being transcribed with at least two distinct ON rates, consistent with data on the joint activation of eve by Bicoid and Hunchback. We also predict distinct statistical signatures for cases in which eve is repressed (e.g. along the edges of the stripe) vs. cases in which activation is reduced (e.g. by mutagenesis of transcription factor binding sites). Fundamental developmental processes such as gene transcription are intrinsically noisy; our approach presents a new way to quantify and analyze time series data during developmental patterning in order to understand regulatory mechanisms and how they propagate noise and impact embryonic robustness."
https://openalex.org/W2609791484,"Cicadas form intimate symbioses with bacteria to obtain nutrients that are scarce in the xylem fluid they feed on. The obligate symbionts in cicadas are purportedly confined to specialized bacteriomes, but knowledge of bacterial communities associated with cicadas is limited. Bacterial communities in the bacteriomes and organs of reproductive, digestive and excretory systems of two cicada species (Platypleura kaempferi and Meimuna mongolica) were investigated using different methods, and the bacterial diversity and distribution patterns of dominant bacteria in different tissues were compared. Within each species, the bacterial communities of testes are significantly different from those of bacteriomes and ovaries. The dominant endosymbiont Candidatus Sulcia muelleri is found not only in the bacteriomes and reproductive organs, but also in the “filter chamber + conical segment” of both species. The transmission mode of this endosymbiont in the alimentary canal and its effect on physiological processes merits further study. A novel bacterium of Rhizobiales, showing ~80% similarity to Candidatus Hodgkinia cicadicola, is dominant in the bacteriomes and ovaries of P. kaempferi. Given that the genome of H. cicadicola exhibits rapid sequence evolution, it is possible that this novel bacterium is a related endosymbiont with beneficial trophic functions similar to that of H. cicadicola in some other cicadas. Failure to detect H. cicadicola in M. mongolica suggests that it has been subsequently replaced by another bacterium, a yeast or gut microbiota which compensates for the loss of H. cicadicola. The distribution of this novel Rhizobiales species in other cicadas and its identification require further investigation to help establish the definition of the bacterial genus Candidatus Hodgkinia and to provide more information on sequence divergence of related endosymbionts of cicadas. Our results highlight the complex bacterial communities of cicadas, and are informative for further studies of the interactions and co-evolution of insect-microbial symbioses in Cicadoidea."
https://openalex.org/W2608164626,"Carbonic anhydrases are a family of enzymes that catalyze the reversible condensation of water and carbon dioxide to carbonic acid, which spontaneously dissociates to bicarbonate. Carbonic anhydrase III (Car3) is nutritionally regulated at both the mRNA and protein level. It is highly enriched in tissues that synthesize and/or store fat: liver, white adipose tissue, brown adipose tissue, and skeletal muscle. Previous characterization of Car3 knockout mice focused on mice fed standard diets, not high-fat diets that significantly alter the tissues that highly express Car3. We observed lower protein levels of Car3 in high-fat diet fed mice treated with niclosamide, a drug published to improve fatty liver symptoms in mice. However, it is unknown if Car3 is simply a biomarker reflecting lipid accumulation or whether it has a functional role in regulating lipid metabolism. We focused our in vitro studies toward metabolic pathways that require bicarbonate. To further determine the role of Car3 in metabolism, we measured de novo fatty acid synthesis with in vitro radiolabeled experiments and examined metabolic biomarkers in Car3 knockout and wild type mice fed high-fat diet. Specifically, we analyzed body weight, body composition, metabolic rate, insulin resistance, serum and tissue triglycerides. Our results indicate that Car3 is not required for de novo lipogenesis, and Car3 knockout mice fed high-fat diet do not have significant differences in responses to various diets to wild type mice."

Among 140 strains tested, sixteen recorded potent antibacterial properties and were further screened against eleven bacterial pathogens. A strain identified as Streptomyces nogalater and designated as NIIST A30 exhibited maximum inhibition against all the test pathogens. Among the eight fermentation media tested, inorganic salts starch broth recorded the best for antibacterial production. The ethyl acetate crude extract exhibited antioxidant properties with IC50 value of 30 μg/mL and had no cytotoxicity towards L6, H9c2 and RAW 264.7 cell lines up to a concentration of 50 μg/mL. Maximum metabolite production was achieved in pH 7.0 at 35°C after 7 days incubation. The significant media components for maximum metabolite production were optimized through response surface methodology employing Plackett-Burman and Box-Behnken designs. The composition of the final optimized medium was soluble starch, 14.97g; (NH4)2SO4, 2.89g; K2HPO4, 2.07g; MgSO4.7H2O, 1g; NaCl, 1g, CaCO3, 2g; FeSO4.7H2O, 1mg; MnCl2.7H2O, 1mg; and ZnSO4.7H2O, 1mg per litre of distilled water. The optimization resulted an antibacterial activity of 28±1.5mm against S. epidermidis which was in close accordance with the predicted value of 30 mm. It is also evident from the result that an increase of 86.66% antibacterial production was recorded in optimized media. The chosen method was economical, efficient and useful for future antibacterial drug discovery from a broad spectrum metabolite producer like Streptomyces nogalater NIIST A30."

Demonstrating placental transmission of viable RSV in human samples is a major paradigm shift in respiratory routes considered likely for RSV transmission.Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) was used to identify RSV present in cord blood mononucleocytes (CBM). CBMs testing positive for RSV were treated with phytohemagglutinin (PHA), PHA and nitric oxide (NO) or PHA, NO and palivizumab, and co-cultured with HeLa cell monolayers. Subsequent immuno-staining for RSV was used to visualize infective viral plaques.RSV was detected in 26 of 45 samples (57.7%) by ddPCR. CBM's collected in winter were more likely to test positive for RSV (17/21 samples, risk = 80%, OR = 7.08; 95% CI 1.80-27.80; p = 0.005) compared to non-winter months (9/24 samples, 37.5%). RSV plaques were observed in non-treated and treated co-cultured HeLa monolayers.Demonstrating active RSV in CBMs suggests in utero transmission of infective virus to the fetus without causing overt disease. This is likely to have an important impact on immune development as well as future virus-host interactions, thereby warranting further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2609916011,"The chaperone trigger factor (TF) binds to the ribosome exit tunnel and helps cotranslational folding of nascent chains (NC) in bacterial cells and chloroplasts. In this study, we aim to investigate the functional dynamics of fully-atomistic apo TF and its complex with 50S. As TF accomodates a high percentage of charged residues on its surface, the effect of ionic strength on TF dynamics is assessed here by performing five independent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations (total of 1.3 micro-second duration) at 29 mM and 150 mM ionic strengths. At both concentrations, TF exhibits high inter- and intra-domain flexibility related to its binding (BD), core (CD), and head (HD) domains. Even though large oscillations in gyration radius exist during each run, we do not detect the so-called ‘fully collapsed’ state with both HD and BD collapsed upon the core. In fact, the extended conformers with relatively open HD and BD are highly populated at the physiological concentration of 150 mM. More importantly, extended TF snapshots stand out in terms of favorable docking onto the 50S subunit. Elastic network modeling (ENM) indicates significant changes in TF’s functional dynamics and domain decomposition depending on its conformation and positioning on the 50S. The most dominant slow motions are the lateral sweeping and vertical opening/closing of HD relative to 50S. Finally, our ENM-based efficient technique -ClustENM- is used to sample atomistic conformers starting with an extended TF-50S complex. Specifically, BD and CD motions are restricted near the tunnel exit, while HD is highly mobile. The atomistic conformers generated without an NC are in agreement with the cryo-EM maps available for TF-ribosome-NC complex."
https://openalex.org/W2608292542,"Background Monthly injections of palivizumab during the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) season in at-risk infants reduces RSV-associated hospitalizations. However, the additive effect of naturally acquired immunity remains unclear. The objective of this study was to assess total neutralizing serum antibodies (NAb) against RSV in at-risk infants who had received an abbreviated course of palivizumab prophylaxis. Methods Serum samples were collected from infants enrolled in the RSV Immunoprophylaxis Program in British Columbia, Canada over 2 consecutive RSV seasons (2013 to 2015). Infants in this program had received an abbreviated course of palivizumab in accordance with the provincial guidelines. Data were compared to adults and infants less than 12 months of age who did not receive palivizumab. Anti-RSV NAb titers were measured using an RSV microneutralization assay. Findings Infants who received palivizumab had anti-RSV NAb titers at the end of the RSV season that persisted beyond what is expected from the pharmacokinetics of palivizumab alone. Moreover, 54% of the control infants who did not receive palivizumab and all tested adults had protective anti-RSV NAb titers. Conclusions Based on our observations, we hypothesize that naturally acquired NAb provide additive protection, which may significantly reduce the need for additional doses of palivizumab in infants at risk of severe RSV infections."

While the mode of transmission is unknown, many studies associate Buruli ulcer with different types of water exposure. We present results from the largest study to date to test for M. ulcerans in aquatic sites and identify environmental attributes associated with its presence. Environmental samples from 98 aquatic sites in the Greater Accra, Ashanti, and Volta regions of Ghana were tested for the presence of M. ulcerans DNA by polymerase chain reaction. The proportion of aquatic sites positive for M. ulcerans varied by region: Ashanti 66% (N = 39), Greater Accra 34% (N = 29), and Volta 0% (N = 30). We explored the spatial distribution of M. ulcerans positive and negative water bodies and found no significant clusters. We also determined both highly localized water attributes and broad scale remotely sensed land cover and terrain environmental characteristics associated with M. ulcerans presence through logistic regression. Our results concur with published results regarding conditions suitable for M. ulcerans growth and associations with Buruli ulcer disease burden with regards to water characteristics and disturbed environments, but differ from others with regards to spatial associations and topographic effects such as elevation and wetness. While our results suggest M. ulcerans is an environmental organism existing in a specific ecological niche, they also reveal variation in the elements defining this niche across the sites considered. In addition, despite the causal association between Buruli ulcer and M. ulcerans, we observed no significant statistical association between case reports of Buruli ulcer and presence of M. ulcerans in nearby waterbodies."
https://openalex.org/W2609112093,"The CreBC two-component system (TCS) is a conserved regulatory system found in Escherichia coli, Aeromonas spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. In this study, we determined how CreBC TCS regulates secreted protease activities and swimming motility using creB, creC, and creBC in-frame deletion mutants (KJΔCreB, KJΔCreC, and KJΔBC) of S. maltophilia KJ. Compared to wild-type KJ, KJΔCreB had a comparable secreted protease activity; however, the secreted protease activities were obviously reduced in KJΔCreC and KJΔBC, suggesting that CreC works together with another unidentified response regulator (not CreB) to regulate secreted protease activity. Single gene inactivation of creB or creC resulted in mutants with an enhanced swimming motility, and this phenotype was exacerbated in a double mutant KJΔBC. To elucidate the underlying mechanism responsible for the ΔcreBC-mediated swimming enhancement, flagella morphology observation, RNA-seq based transcriptome assay, qRT-PCR, and membrane integrity and potential assessment were performed. Flagella morphological observation ruled out the possibility that swimming enhancement was due to altered flagella morphology. CreBC inactivation upregulated the expression of creD and flagella-associated genes encoding the basal body- and motor-associated proteins. Furthermore, KJΔBC had an increased membrane susceptibility to Triton X-100 and CreD upregulation in KJΔBC partially alleviated the compromise of membrane integrity. The impact of creBC TCS on bacterial membrane potential was assessed by carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazine (CCCP50) concentration at which 50% of bacterial swimming is inhibited. CCCP50 of wild-type KJ increased when creBC was deleted, indicating an association between the higher membrane potential of KJΔBC cells and enhanced motility. Upregulation of the basal body- and motor-associated genes of flagella in KJΔBC cells may explain the increased membrane potential. Collectively, inactivation of creBC increased swimming motility through membrane potential increase and creD upregulation in S. maltophilia. The increased membrane potential may supply more energy for flagella propelling and CreD upregulation supports membrane stability, providing a strong membrane for flagellum function."

The system is compact and portable, and thus suitable for deployment in the operating room without disturbing the surgical flow. For system performance, parameters including near infrared fluorescence detection limit, contrast transfer functions and topography depth resolution were characterized. The developed system was tested in chicken tissues ex vivo with simulated tumors for intraoperative imaging. We subsequently conducted in vivo multimodal imaging of sentinel lymph nodes in mice using FITS and PET/CT. The PET/CT/optical multimodal images were co-registered and conveniently presented to users to guide surgeries. Our results show that the developed system can facilitate multimodal intraoperative imaging."

https://openalex.org/W2607908162,"Different concentrations of parathyroid hormone [1-34] (PTH [1-34]) can have totally opposite effects on osteoblasts. Intermittent stimulation with PTH can significantly increase bone mineral density in vitro, mainly through the protein kinase A (PKA) signaling pathway, which phosphorylates runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2). The ClC-3 chloride channel, an important anion channel, can also promote osteogenesis via the Runx2 pathway based on recent studies. The purpose of our study, therefore, is to research whether the ClC-3 chloride channel has an effect on PTH osteodifferentiation in MC3T3-E1 cells.A cell counting kit (CCK-8) and real-time PCR were used to investigate the impact of different PTH stimulation modes on MC3T3-E1 cell proliferation and osteogenesis-related gene expression, respectively. We found that the minimum inhibitory concentration of PTH was 10-9 M, and the expression of alkaline phosphatase (Alpl) and Runx2 were at the highest levels when treated with 10-9 M PTH. Next, we used real-time PCR and immunofluorescence technique to detect changes in ClC-3 in MC3T3-E1 cells under PTH treatment. The results showed higher expression of the ClC-3 chloride channel at 10-9 M intermittent PTH administration than in the other groups. Finally, we used the ClC-3 siRNA technique to examine the role of the ClC-3 chloride channel in the effect of PTH on the osteogenesis of osteoblasts, and we found an obvious decrease in the expression of bone sialoprotein (Ibsp), osteocalcin (Bglap), osterix (Sp7), Alpl and Runx2, the formation of mineralization nodules as well.From the above data, we conclude that the expression of ClC-3 chloride channels in osteoblasts helps them respond to PTH stimulation, which mediates osteogenic differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2608837255,"Background We report patient outcomes after antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation in a network of HIV facilities in Haiti, including temporal trends and differences across clinics, during the expansion of HIV services in the country. Methods We assessed outcomes at 12 months after ART initiation (baseline) using routinely collected data on adults (≥15 years) in 11 HIV facilities from July 2007-December 2013. Outcomes include death (ascertained from medical records), lost to follow-up (LTF) defined as no visit > 365 days from ART initiation, and retention defined as being alive and attending care ≥ 365 days from ART initiation. Outcomes were compared across calendar year of ART initiation and across facilities. Risk factors for death and LTF were assessed using Cox proportional hazards and competing risk regression models. Results Cumulatively, 9,718 adults initiated ART with median age 37 years (IQR 30–46). Median CD4 count was 254 cells/uL (IQR 139–350). Twelve months after ART initiation, 4.4% (95% CI 4.0–4.8) of patients died, 21.7% (95% CI 20.9–22.6) were LTF, and 73.9% (95% CI 73.0–74.8) were retained in care. Twelve-month mortality decreased from 13.8% among adults who started ART in 2007 to 4.4% in 2013 (p<0.001). Twelve-month LTF after ART start was 29.2% in 2007, 18.7% in 2008, and increased to 30.1% in 2013 (p<0.001). Overall, twelve-month retention after ART start did not change over time but varied widely across facilities from 61.1% to 86.5%. Conclusion Expansion of HIV services across Haiti has been successful with increasing numbers of patients initiating ART and decreasing twelve-month mortality rates. However, overall retention has not improved, despite differences across facilities, suggesting additional strategies to improve engagement in care are needed."
https://openalex.org/W2607738766,"In honeybees, age-associated structural modifications can be observed in the mushroom bodies. Prominent examples are the synaptic complexes (microglomeruli, MG) in the mushroom body calyces, which were shown to alter their size and density with age. It is not known whether the amount of intracellular synaptic proteins in the MG is altered as well. The presynaptic protein Bruchpilot (BRP) is localized at active zones and is involved in regulating the probability of neurotransmitter release in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. Here, we explored the localization of the honeybee BRP (Apis mellifera BRP, AmBRP) in the bee brain and examined age-related changes in the AmBRP abundance in the central bee brain and in microglomeruli of the mushroom body calyces. We report predominant AmBRP localization near the membrane of presynaptic boutons within the mushroom body MG. The relative amount of AmBRP was increased in the central brain of two-week old bees whereas the amount of Synapsin, another presynaptic protein involved in the regulation of neurotransmitter release, shows an increase during the first two weeks followed by a decrease. In addition, we demonstrate an age-associated modulation of AmBRP located near the membrane of presynaptic boutons within MG located in mushroom body calyces where sensory input is conveyed to mushroom body intrinsic neurons. We discuss that the observed age-associated AmBRP modulation might be related to maturation processes or to homeostatic mechanisms that might help to maintain synaptic functionality in old animals."
https://openalex.org/W2609002387,"Coronary artery calcium scores (CACS) from lung cancer screening computed tomography (LCSCT) or myocardial perfusion attenuation correction computed tomography (ACCT) are not routinely performed or reported. CACS from LCSCT and ACCT have not been directly compared in the same patient population. We identified 66 patients who underwent both LCSCT (non-gated) and ECG-gated cardiac CT (CCT) within a 2-year span. Of this population, 40 subjects had also undergone ACCT. Using the Agatston method, CACS for 264 individual vessels from the LCSCT population and for 160 vessels from ACCT population were calculated and evaluated for agreement with ECG-gated CCT as the gold standard. Secondary analysis included a comparison of individual vessel contribution to variations in agreement and a comparison of total CACS from CCT, LCSCT, and ACCT for respective MACE prediction. CACS from LCSCT demonstrated a strong Pearson correlation, r = 0.9017 (0.876-0.9223), with good agreement when compared to CACS from CCT. CACS from ACCT demonstrated a significantly (P < 0.00001) weaker correlation, r = 0.5593 (0.4401-0.6592). On an individual vessel basis, CACS from all major vessels (LM, LAD, LCX, and RCA) contributed to the weaker correlation. For total vessel CACS, LCSCT demonstrated comparable area under the curve (AUC) for the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (LCSCT AUC = 0.8133 and CCT AUC = 0.8302, P = 0.691) for prediction of MACE. Although ACCT demonstrated a similar AUC (ACCT AUC = 0.7969, P = 0.662) for MACE prediction the cutoff value for elevated risk was extremely low. In conclusion, LCSCT outperformed ACCT at calcium scoring by providing better agreement and comparable risk assessment to CCT despite the absence of ECG-gating. It is therefore reasonable to use LCSCT images to derive and report Agatston-based CACS for cardiovascular risk assessment, whereas the use of ACCT images to report Agatston-based CACS is not currently practical."
https://openalex.org/W2609152777,"In hepatitis C virus (HCV) polyprotein sequence, core protein terminates with E1 envelope signal peptide. Cleavage by signal peptidase (SP) separates E1 from the complete form of core protein, anchored in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane by the signal peptide. Subsequent cleavage of the signal peptide by signal-peptide peptidase (SPP) releases the mature form of core protein, which preferentially relocates to lipid droplets. Both of these cleavages are required for the HCV infectious cycle, supporting the idea that HCV assembly begins at the surface of lipid droplets, yet SPP-catalyzed cleavage is dispensable for initiation of budding in the ER. Here we have addressed at what step(s) of the HCV infectious cycle SP-catalyzed cleavage at the core-E1 junction is required. Taking advantage of the sole system that has allowed visualization of HCV budding events in the ER lumen of mammalian cells, we showed that, unexpectedly, mutations abolishing this cleavage did not prevent but instead tended to promote the initiation of viral budding. Moreover, even though no viral particles were released from Huh-7 cells transfected with a full-length HCV genome bearing these mutations, intracellular viral particles containing core protein protected by a membrane envelope were formed. These were visualized by electron microscopy as capsid-containing particles with a diameter of about 70 nm and 40 nm before and after delipidation, respectively, comparable to intracellular wild-type particle precursors except that they were non-infectious. Thus, our results show that SP-catalyzed cleavage is dispensable for HCV budding per se, but is required for the viral particles to acquire their infectivity and secretion. These data support the idea that HCV assembly occurs in concert with budding at the ER membrane. Furthermore, capsid-containing particles did not accumulate in the absence of SP-catalyzed cleavage, suggesting the quality of newly formed viral particles is controlled before secretion."
https://openalex.org/W2609254791,"Chrysanthemum crassum is a decaploid species of Chrysanthemum with high stress tolerance that allows survival under salinity stress while maintaining a relatively ideal growth rate. We previously recorded morphological changes after salt treatment, such as the expansion of leaf cells. To explore the underlying salinity tolerance mechanisms, we used an Illumina platform and obtained three sequencing libraries from samples collected after 0 h, 12 h and 24 h of salt treatment. Following de novo assembly, 154,944 transcripts were generated, and 97,833 (63.14%) transcripts were annotated, including 55 Gene Ontology (GO) terms and 128 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways. The expression profile of C. crassum was globally altered after salt treatment. We selected functional genes and pathways that may contribute to salinity tolerance and identified some factors involved in the salinity tolerance strategies of C. crassum, such as signal transduction, transcription factors and plant hormone regulation, enhancement of energy metabolism, functional proteins and osmolyte synthesis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging, photosystem protection and recovery, and cell wall protein modifications. Forty-six genes were selected for quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction detection, and their expression patterns were shown to be consistent with the changes in their transcript abundance determined by RNA sequencing."
https://openalex.org/W2610109884,"Scientists have unprecedented access to a wide variety of high-quality datasets. These datasets, which are often independently curated, commonly use unstructured spreadsheets to store their data. Standardized annotations are essential to perform synthesis studies across investigators, but are often not used in practice. Therefore, accurately combining records in spreadsheets from differing studies requires tedious and error-prone human curation. These efforts result in a significant time and cost barrier to synthesis research. We propose an information retrieval inspired algorithm, Synthesize, that merges unstructured data automatically based on both column labels and values. Application of the Synthesize algorithm to cancer and ecological datasets had high accuracy (on the order of 85-100%). We further implement Synthesize in an open source web application, Synthesizer (https://github.com/lisagandy/synthesizer). The software accepts input as spreadsheets in comma separated value (CSV) format, visualizes the merged data, and outputs the results as a new spreadsheet. Synthesizer includes an easy to use graphical user interface, which enables the user to finish combining data and obtain perfect accuracy. Future work will allow detection of units to automatically merge continuous data and application of the algorithm to other data formats, including databases."
