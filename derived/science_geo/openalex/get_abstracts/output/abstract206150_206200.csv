Kates' studies (2) led him to suggest n-propanol or isopropanol for lipid extraction (isopropanol was his later choice (6, 7)). Attempting to meet the requirements discussed above, we developed a new and relatively simple method of extraction employing n-propanol (9), or chloroformmethanol (2:1). The latter proved to be a more useful solvent. The method will be described in detail below, with results of an examination of Drosophila lipids."

https://openalex.org/W1992107304,Chronic avoidance-learning stress was found to depress the immune reaction responsible for skin homograft rejection to a modest but significant degree. This effect was observed in a genetically uniform as well as a heterogeneous line of mice.

https://openalex.org/W2081093126,THE syndrome of acute intestinal lesions due to ionizing radiation leading to an early death of the animals has been described by many workers1–5. The present work is concerned with the increase of the capillary permeability in the intestinal tract of rats after irradiation and the suppression of this phenomenon by the action of drugs affecting the esterase systems.

https://openalex.org/W2044132438,"ADRENALECTOMY enhances, and adrenal cortical hormone depresses, the incorporation of carbon-14 from amino-acids, and from amino-acid precursors, into the protein of isolated rat diaphragm1,2. These changes are, at least in part, the result of a direct effect on protein biosynthesis1,3. Whether corticosteroids also effect protein synthesis indirectly by influencing amino-acid transport and accumulation is not known. The possibility was tested by measuring the penetration and accumulation of [1-14C-]-aminoisobutyric acid4, a non-utilizable amino-acid analogue, and of the utilizable amino-acids [U-14C] L-phenylalanine and [U-14C] L-lysine, by ‘intact’ diaphragms5 isolated from normal, adrenalectomized, and cortisone-treated rats."

https://openalex.org/W2082695608,"ORTON1 suggested that protandrous animals might be self-fertilizing and that this would be advantageous for the spread of a species. He concluded that Crepidula fornicata was self-fertilizing because he found an isolated female guarding veliger larvae. I have kept single Crepidula in aquaria and they have laid fertilized spawn two to three months later. Chipperfield2 found no unfertilized eggs but he examined only unbroken chains from a densely populated area. Wilczynski3 has recently said that the typical chains are feeding communities, not breeding associations and that copulation is effected with additional or visiting males. In Calyptraea chinensis (L.) males and females begin to associate seven months before spawn is laid4. Females probably store foreign sperms for long periods. Evidence for self-fertilization in Crepidula is therefore still lacking."

Usually, the fibre has been regarded as a ‘contractile skeleton’ ; on this basis its response to a chemical agent has commonly been interpreted as a direct response of the contractile elements, rather than an effect mediated or influenced by other still functional components of the muscle cell."

https://openalex.org/W2033963557,IT was observed that crystalline ribonuclease selectively prevented demonstration of nerve axoplasm by a simple silver method reported elsewhere1. The tissue was treated with 0.01 per cent cystalline ribonuclease in distilled water at 60° C. for 1 hour. Ribonuclease was also observed to prevent axon staining as well as to alter the staining capacity of the Nissl substance and nucleoli of the spinal cord when the Bodian and toluidine blue methods were used.
