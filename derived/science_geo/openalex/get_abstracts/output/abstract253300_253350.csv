https://openalex.org/W2151535044,"Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P, 1) regulates vascular barrier and lymphoid development, as well as lymphocyte egress from lymphoid organs, by activating high-affinity S1P1 receptors. We used reversible chemical probes (i) to gain mechanistic insights into S1P systems organization not accessible through genetic manipulations and (ii) to investigate their potential for therapeutic modulation. Vascular (but not airway) administration of the preferred R enantiomer of an in vivo-active chiral S1P1 receptor antagonist induced loss of capillary integrity in mouse skin and lung. In contrast, the antagonist did not affect the number of constitutive blood lymphocytes. Instead, alteration of lymphocyte trafficking and phenotype required supraphysiological elevation of S1P1 tone and was reversed by the antagonist. In vivo two-photon imaging of lymph nodes confirmed requirements for obligate agonism, and the data were consistent with the presence of a stromal barrier mechanism for gating lymphocyte egress. Thus, chemical modulation reveals differences in S1P-S1P1 'set points' among tissues and highlights both mechanistic advantages (lymphocyte sequestration) and risks (pulmonary edema) of therapeutic intervention."

Several proteins controlling insulin exocytosis have been identified, but the factors determining the expression of the components of the secretory machinery of beta-cells remain largely unknown. MicroRNAs are newly discovered small non-coding RNAs acting as repressors of gene expression. We found that overexpression of mir-9 in insulin-secreting cells causes a reduction in exocytosis elicited by glucose or potassium. We show that mir-9 acts by diminishing the expression of the transcription factor Onecut-2 and, in turn, by increasing the level of Granuphilin/Slp4, a Rab GTPase effector associated with beta-cell secretory granules that exerts a negative control on insulin release. Indeed, electrophoretic mobility shift assays, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and transfection experiments demonstrated that Onecut-2 is able to bind to the granuphilin promoter and to repress its transcriptional activity. Moreover, we show that silencing of Onecut-2 by RNA interference increases Granuphilin expression and mimics the effect of mir-9 on stimulus-induced exocytosis. Our data provide evidence that in insulin-producing cells adequate levels of mir-9 are mandatory for maintaining appropriate Granuphilin levels and optimal secretory capacity."

In the mother's absence, odor-shock conditioning produces amygdala activation and learned odor avoidance. With maternal presence, this same conditioning yields an odor preference without amygdala activation. Maternal presence acts through modulation of pup corticosterone and corticosterone's regulation of amygdala activity. Over-riding maternal suppression of corticosterone through intra-amygdala corticosterone infusions permits fear conditioning and amygdala activation."

https://openalex.org/W2125774668,"CHIP (C terminus of Hsc-70 interacting protein) is an E3 ligase that links the protein folding machinery with the ubiquitin-proteasome system and has been implicated in disorders characterized by protein misfolding and aggregation. Here we investigate the role of CHIP in protecting from ataxin-1-induced neurodegeneration. Ataxin-1 is a polyglutamine protein whose expansion causes spinocerebellar ataxia type-1 (SCA1) and triggers the formation of nuclear inclusions (NIs). We find that CHIP and ataxin-1 proteins directly interact and co-localize in NIs both in cell culture and SCA1 postmortem neurons. CHIP promotes ubiquitination of expanded ataxin-1 both in vitro and in cell culture. The Hsp70 chaperone increases CHIP-mediated ubiquitination of ataxin-1 in vitro, and the tetratricopeptide repeat domain, which mediates CHIP interactions with chaperones, is required for ataxin-1 ubitiquination in cell culture. Interestingly, CHIP also interacts with and ubiquitinates unexpanded ataxin-1. Overexpression of CHIP in a Drosophila model of SCA1 decreases the protein steady-state levels of both expanded and unexpanded ataxin-1 and suppresses their toxicity. Finally we investigate the ability of CHIP to protect against toxicity caused by expanded polyglutamine tracts in different protein contexts. We find that CHIP is not effective in suppressing the toxicity caused by a bare 127Q tract with only a short hemagglutinin tag, but it is very efficient in suppressing toxicity caused by a 128Q tract in the context of an N-terminal huntingtin backbone. These data underscore the importance of the protein framework for modulating the effects of polyglutamine-induced neurodegeneration."

https://openalex.org/W1996148311,"Insulin receptor (IR) and insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-IR) are both from the same subgroup of receptor tyrosine kinases that exist as covalently bound receptor dimers at the cell surface. For both IR and IGF-IR, the most described forms are homodimer receptors. However, hybrid receptors consisting of one-half IR and one-half IGF-IR are also present at the cell surface. Two splice variants of IR are expressed that enable formation of two isoforms of the IGF-IR/IR hybrid receptor. In this study, these two splice variants of hybrid receptors were studied with respect to binding affinities of insulin, insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), and insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II). Unlike previously published data, in which semipurified receptors have been studied, we found that the two hybrid receptor splice variants had similar binding characteristics with respect to insulin, IGF-I, and IGF-II binding. We studied both semipurified and purified hybrid receptors. In all cases we found that IGF-I had at least 50-fold higher affinity than insulin, irrespective of the splice variant. The binding characteristics of insulin and IGF-I to both splice variants of the hybrid receptors were similar to classical homodimer IGF-IR."

This degradation, which results from sterol-induced binding of reductase to ER membrane proteins called Insigs, contributes to the complex, multivalent feedback regulation of the enzyme. Degradation of HMG-CoA reductase is also stimulated by various forms of vitamin E, a generic term for α-, β-, δ-, and γ-tocopherols and tocotrienols, which are primarily recognized for their potent antioxidant activity. Here, we show that δ-tocotrienol stimulates ubiquitination and degradation of reductase and blocks processing of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs), another sterol-mediated action of Insigs. The γ-tocotrienol analog is more selective in enhancing reductase ubiquitination and degradation than blocking SREBP processing. Other forms of vitamin E neither accelerate reductase degradation nor block SREBP processing. In vitro assays indicate that γ- and δ-tocotrienol trigger reductase ubiquitination directly and do not require further metabolism for activity. Taken together, these results provide a biochemical mechanism for the hypocholesterolemic effects of vitamin E that have been observed in animals and humans.

Brown M.S. Nature. 1990; 343: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (4549) Google Scholar). HMG-CoA reductase, a resident glycoprotein of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), consists of two contiguous domains (2Liscum L. Finer-Moore J. Stroud R.M. Luskey K.L. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 522-530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar): a hydrophobic N-terminal domain consisting of eight membrane-spanning segments that anchors the protein to ER membranes (3Roitelman J. Olender E.H. Bar-Nun S. Dunn Jr., W.A. Simoni R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 959-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar); and a large C-terminal domain located in the cytosol contains the enzyme catalytic activity (4Gil G. Faust J.R. Chin D.J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1985; 41: 249-258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The reductase is one of the most highly regulated enzymes in biology, as evidenced by its tight control through a multivalent regulatory system mediated by mevalonate-derived products (5Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Lipid Res. 1980; 21: 505-517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Part of this regulatory system involves sterol-regulated ubiquitination (6Ravid T. Doolman R. Avner R. Harats D. Roitelman J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35840-35847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), which is mediated by the reductase membrane domain and leads to ER-associated degradation of the enzyme (7Sever N. Yang T. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 25-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Degradation of reductase requires the action of at least one of two ER membrane proteins called Insig-1 and Insig-2 (7Sever N. Yang T. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Mol.

Cell. 2006; 124: 35-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar). The central event in this process is sterol-stimulated binding of the reductase membrane domain to Insigs, which in turn are bound to a ubiquitin ligase called gp78 (12Song B.L. Sever N. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 829-840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). The membrane-anchored gp78 mediates ubiquitination of reductase, an obligate reaction for accelerated degradation of the enzyme (13Sever N. Song B.L. Yabe D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. DeBose-Boyd R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52479-52490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Nonsterol, mevalonate-derived products cannot stimulate ubiquitination or degradation of reductase in sterol-deprived cells but do augment degradation of the enzyme in cells replete with sterols (14Nakanishi M. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8929-8937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Roitelman J. Simoni R.D. J. Biol.

Metabolic evidence indicates that the nonsterol component of reductase degradation can be derived from the 20-carbon isoprenoid geranylgeraniol (GGOH), but not the 15-carbon isoprenoid farnesol (13Sever N. Song B.L. Yabe D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. DeBose-Boyd R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52479-52490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). It is presently unclear whether the nonsterol potentiator of reductase degradation is GGOH itself or the pyrophosphate derivative, geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, which may become attached to a specific protein that mediates the effect. Insigs also play a prominent role in the sterol-dependent retention of SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP) in the ER. SCAP, like reductase, contains a hydrophobic N-terminal domain with eight membrane-spanning regions and a large C-terminal domain located in the cytosol (17Nohturfft A. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17243-17250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 18Yang T. Espenshade P.J. Wright M.E. Yabe D. Gong Y. Aebersold R. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S.

A. 2002; 99: 12753-12758Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). SCAP is a sterol-responsive escort protein that associates with SREBPs and facilitates their translocation to the Golgi for sequential proteolytic processing. Proteolysis releases the N-terminal fragments of SREBPs into the cytosol, from which they enter the nucleus to enhance transcription of genes encoding cholesterol biosynthetic enzymes (including reductase) and the low density lipoprotein (LDL)-receptor, which mediates extracellular uptake of cholesterol-rich LDL particles (20Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3004) Google Scholar). Sterols stimulate binding of Insigs to the sterol-sensing domain of SCAP, a stretch of ∼170 amino acids containing five transmembrane domains that resemble the Insig binding site in reductase (18Yang T. Espenshade P.J. Wright M.E. Yabe D. Gong Y. Aebersold R. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 2002; 110: 489-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar, 21Hua X. Nohturfft A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1996; 87: 415-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Insig binding does not trigger rapid degradation of SCAP, but rather leads to retention of SCAP in the ER, thereby preventing delivery of bound SREBPs to the Golgi for proteolytic activation (22DeBose-Boyd R.A. Brown M.S. Li W.P. Nohturfft A. Goldstein J.L. Espenshade P.J. Cell. 1999; 99: 703-712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 23Nohturfft A. Yabe D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Espenshade P.J. Cell. 2000; 102: 315-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). In the absence of proteolytic activation of SREBPs, rates of cholesterol synthesis and uptake are decreased. Three classes of sterols are believed to control Insig-mediated reactions (ER retention of SCAP·SREBP and accelerated degradation of reductase): cholesterol, methylated sterols, and oxysterols (11Goldstein J.L. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Brown M.S. Cell. 2006; 124: 35-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar). Cholesterol, the bulk end-product of mevalonate metabolism, directly binds to the membrane domain of SCAP, inducing a conformational change in the protein that triggers Insig binding, thereby preventing escape of SCAP·SREBP complexes from the ER (24Brown A.J. Sun L. Feramisco J.D. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 237-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 25Radhakrishnan A. Sun L.P. Kwon H.J. Brown M.S.

J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52772-52780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Lanosterol, the first sterol intermediate in cholesterol synthesis, has no effect on the ER to Golgi transport of SCAP·SREBP, but this methylated sterol potently stimulates Insig-dependent ubiquitination and degradation of reductase (27Song B.L. Javitt N.B. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Cell Metabolism. 2005; 1: 179-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Oxysterols, derived from the conversion of either endogenous or LDL-derived cholesterol, have dual actions in that they stimulate the acceleration of reductase degradation and promote ER retention of SCAP·SREBP. Thus, selective recognition of sterol ligands by reductase and SCAP may contribute to the ability of Insigs to mediate regulation of both proteins through distinct mechanisms. Vitamin E is a generic term for eight naturally occurring forms of lipophilic compounds called tocopherols and tocotrienols. Tocopherols and tocotrienols share a polar chromanol ring that is linked to an isoprenoid-derived hydrocarbon side chain (Fig. 1A). Tocopherols carry a saturated phytyl group that is derived from homogentisic acid and phytyl pyrophosphate, whereas tocotrienols are thought to arise from the condensation of homogentisic acid and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (28Sen C.K. Khanna S. Roy S. Life Sci. 2006; 78: 2088-2098Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Tocopherols and tocotrienols can be subdivided into four isomers (α, β, γ, and δ) with regards to the numbers and position of methyl groups on their chromanol ring (Fig. 1A). Vitamin E is an essential component of the human diet, and various forms of the vitamin are synthesized exclusively by photosynthetic organisms. For example, tocopherols are generally present in common vegetable oils such as soybean, canola, wheat germ, and sunflower, whereas tocotrienols are concentrated (>70%) in cereal grains (i.e. oat, barley, rye, and rice brans), with the richest source found in palm fruits (29Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar). The nutritive value of tocopherols and tocotrienols in food products emanates from their well-known antioxidant capacity, which helps to prevent oxidative damage to polyunsaturated fatty acids (30Brigelius-Flohe R.E.G. Traber M.G. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1145-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1256) Google Scholar). Tocotrienols, but not tocopherols, have been linked to additional beneficial therapeutic properties that include antithrombotic and neuroprotective activities and the ability to inhibit proliferation of breast cancer cells and lower serum cholesterol when administered in the diet of chickens, swine, rats, and hypercholesterolemic humans (31Qureshi A.A.

Early studies revealed an association between the hypocholesterolemic activity of tocotrienol-rich extracts and decreased levels of hepatic HMG-CoA reductase activity (35Qureshi A.A. Burger W.C. Peterson D.M. Elson C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10544-10550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent structure-activity studies revealed that δ- and γ-tocotrienols were the most potent suppressors of reductase in primary rat hepatocytes and cultured HepG2 cells (39Pearce B.C. Parker R.A. Deason M.E. Qureshi A.A. Wright J.J. J. Med. Chem. 1992; 35: 3595-3606Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 40Pearce B.C. Parker R.A. Deason M.E. Dischino D.D. Gillespie E. Qureshi A.A. Volk K. Wright J.J. J. Med. Chem. 1994; 37: 526-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Importantly, these studies offered evidence for tocotrienols as direct, post-transcriptional suppressors that presumably mimic nonsterol isoprenoids in accelerating reductase degradation (41Parker R.A. Pearce B.C. Clark R.W. Gordon D.A. Wright J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11230-11238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the current study, we report the unexpected finding that δ- and γ-tocotrienols mimic sterols, rather than nonsterol isoprenoids, in promoting Insig-dependent ubiquitination/degradation of reductase. Furthermore, δ-tocotrienol, but not the γ-form, also effectively blocks cleavage of SREBPs. Other forms of vitamin E, which include all of the tocopherols and α-tocotrienol, have no measurable effect on reductase degradation or SREBP processing. In vitro ubiquitination assays indicate that γ- and δ-tocotrienols are directly recognized by the sterol-sensing system that mediates formation of the reductase-Insig complex and thereby initiates accelerated degradation of reductase. Considered together, these results provide a plausible mechanism for the hypocholesterolemic activity of tocotrienols that has been observed in animals and humans. Materials—We obtained MG-132, α-, β-, δ-, γ-tocopherols and tocotrienols from Calbiochem; horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-mouse, and anti-rabbit IgG from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories; FLAG-ubiquitin from Sigma; and ubiquitin-aldehyde and ubiquitin-activating enzyme from Boston Biochem (Cambridge, MA).

RNA Interference—Duplexes of small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting human Insig-1, human Insig-2, and an irrelevant control gene vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G), were synthesized by Dharmacon Research (Lafayette, CO). The sequences of the siRNAs and the procedure for transfection have been described (13Sever N. Song B.L. Yabe D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. DeBose-Boyd R.A. J. Biol.

Ubiquitination of HMG-CoA Reductase in Permeabilized Cells and Isolated Membranes—The conditions of incubations prior to harvesting of cells are described in the figure legends. SV-589 cells were harvested into the medium by scraping and collected by centrifugation, after which pooled cell pellets from triplicate dishes were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and either permeabilized with 0.025% (w/v) digitonin (46Song B.L. DeBose-Boyd R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28798-28806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) or subjected to cell fractionation for the isolation of membrane fractions as described above. Permeabilized cells and isolated membrane fractions were resuspended in 300 μl and 150 μl, respectively, of permeabilization buffer (25 mm Hepes-KOH at pH 7.3, 115 mm potassium acetate, 5 mm sodium acetate, 2.5 mm magnesium chloride, 0.5 mm sodium EGTA) containing protease inhibitors (20 μm leupeptin, 10 μm MG-132, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin), an ATP-regenerating system (2 mm Hepes-KOH at pH 7.3, 1 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm sodium ATP, 30 mm creatine phosphate, and 0.05 mg/ml creatine kinase), 0.1 mg/ml FLAG-ubiquitin, and 0.01 mg/ml ubiquitin-aldehyde. Reactions were supplemented with either 3 mg/ml rat liver cytosol or 5 μg/ml purified ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1) to facilitate activation of FLAG-ubiquitin (27Song B.L. Javitt N.B. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Cell Metabolism. 2005; 1: 179-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). 25-Hydroxycholesterol, α-, β-, δ-, or γ-tocopherol and tocotrienol were added to reactions in a final concentration of 1% (v/v) ethanol. Reactions were carried out at 37 °C for 30 min and terminated by centrifugation at 4,000 rpm (permeabilized cells) or 2 × 105 g (isolated membranes) at 4 °C. The resulting pellets were lysed, clarified, and subjected to immunoprecipitation with polyclonal anti-HMG-CoA reductase and immunoblotted as described above. Fig. 1B shows the results of an experiment that compare the effects of various tocopherols and tocotrienols on the degradation of reductase and the processing of SREBP-2 in SV589 cells (43Yamamoto T. Davis C.G. Brown M.S. Schneider W.J. Casey M.L. Goldstein J.L. Russell D.W. Cell. 1984; 39: 27-38Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar). The cells were first depleted of sterols by incubation for 16 h in medium containing lipoprotein-deficient serum, the reductase inhibitor compactin (47Brown M.S. Faust J.R. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 1121-1128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a low level of mevalonate (50 μm). The sterol-depleted cells were then treated for an additional 5 h with 2.5 μm 25-hydroxycholesterol or different concentrations of α-, γ-, or δ-tocopherol and tocotrienol plus 10 mm mevalonate, which allows for production of nonsterol isoprenoids that enhance reductase degradation (13Sever N.

Following treatments, cells were harvested, subjected to fractionation, and aliquots of the resulting membrane and nuclear extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Immunoblot analysis was subsequently carried out with antibodies against reductase (top panel) and SREBP-2 (bottom panel). As expected, 25-hydroxycholesterol accelerated degradation of reductase, as indicated by the disappearance of the reductase protein, and blocked SREBP-2 processing, as demonstrated by the disappearance of nuclear SREBP-2 (top and bottom panels, compare lanes a and b). In contrast, none of the tocopherols accelerated reductase degradation or blocked SREBP-2 processing (top and bottom panels, lanes c–h); similar results were obtained with α-tocotrienol (lanes i–j) and the β-forms of tocopherol and tocotrienol. 4R. A. DeBose-Boyd and B.-L. Song, unpublished observations. Both γ- and δ-tocotrienols accelerated reductase degradation at 10 μm (top panel, lanes l and n), but only δ-tocotrienol completely blocked SREBP-2 processing (bottom panel, lane n). To determine whether δ- and γ-tocotrienols fulfill the sterol or nonsterol requirement for reductase degradation, sterol-depleted cells were treated with these molecules individually or in combination with 10 mm mevalonate (Fig. 2A). When added to cells individually, 25-hydroxycholesterol, γ-tocotrienol, and δ-tocotrienol increased reductase degradation (lanes b–d, f, and g, respectively), whereas 10 mm mevalonate alone had no effect (lane h). Degradation of reductase was further accelerated when 10 mm mevalonate was added together with 25-hydroxycholesterol or δ- and γ-tocotrienols (compare lanes b–d, f, and g with i–k, m, and n). In contrast, α-tocotrienol had no measurable effect on reductase degradation, regardless of the absence or presence of 10 mm mevalonate (lanes e and l). The ubiquitination state of reductase was determined in sterol-deprived cells treated with 25-hydroxycholesterol or the various forms of tocopherols and tocotrienols in the presence of MG-132, which blocks proteasomal degradation of ubiquitinated proteins (Fig. 2B). Following treatments, detergent lysates were prepared and subjected to immunoprecipitation with polyclonal antibodies against reductase. The resulting immunoprecipitates were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-ubiquitin (top panel) and anti-reductase (bottom panel). In the presence of 25-hydroxycholesterol, γ-, or δ-tocotrienol, reductase became ubiquitinated as indicated by the high molecular weight smears of reactivity in the anti-ubiquitin immunoblot (top panel, lanes 2, 7, and 8). In contrast, ubiquitination of reductase was not stimulated by α-, γ-, and δ-tocopherols or α-tocotrienol to an appreciable extent (top panel, lane 3–6). The Insig requirement for tocotrienol-stimulated degradation and ubiquitination of reductase is demonstrated in the RNA interference (RNAi) experiments of Fig. 3. SV-589 cells were transfected with duplexes of small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting the control gene vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein or the combination of Insig-1 and Insig-2 and depleted of sterols for 16 h. For degradation experiments, cells were subjected to treatments with 25-hydroxycholesterol, α-, γ-, or δ-tocotrienol in the presence of 10 mm mevalonate (Fig. 3A). The combination of 25-hydroxycholesterol and 10 mm mevalonate led to complete degradation of reductase within 5 h in the control-transfected cells (top panel, lane 2). Similarly, γ- or δ-tocotrienol plus 10 mm mevalonate caused reductase to become fully degraded after 5 h (lanes 4 and 5). When siRNAs targeting Insig-1 and Insig-2 were introduced into the cells, the degradation of reductase mediated by 25-hydroxycholesterol or γ- and δ-tocotrienols were abolished (lanes 7, 9, and 10). Expression of a control protein, the transferrin receptor, did not change under any of the experimental conditions (bottom panel, lanes 1–10). Similar results were obtained for reductase ubiquitination (Fig. 3B). In these experiments, sterol-deprived siRNA-transfected cells were treated with MG-132 plus 25-hydroxycholesterol or tocotrienols for 1 h prior to lysate preparation, which was followed by reductase immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis. As expected, 25-hydroxycholesterol or γ- and δ-tocotrienols stim"

In addition to SPP, a family of SPP-like proteins (SPPLs) of unknown function has been identified. We demonstrate that SPPL2b utilizes multiple intramembrane cleavages to liberate the intracellular domain of tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) into the cytosol and the carboxy-terminal counterpart into the extracellular space. These findings suggest common principles for regulated intramembrane proteolysis by GxGD aspartyl proteases."
https://openalex.org/W2028359994,"Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is a promising candidate for cancer therapy because of its relative tumor selectivity. However, many cancers including pancreatic cancer remain resistant towards TRAIL. To develop TRAIL for cancer therapy of pancreatic carcinoma, it will therefore be pivotal to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of TRAIL resistance. Here, we identify X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) as a regulator of TRAIL sensitivity in pancreatic carcinoma cells. Full activation of effector caspases, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and cytochrome c release following TRAIL treatment were markedly impaired in pancreatic carcinoma cell lines, which poorly responded to TRAIL (PaTuII, PancTu1, ASPC1, DanG), compared to TRAIL-sensitive Colo357 pancreatic carcinoma cells. Stable downregulation of XIAP by RNA interference significantly reduced survival and enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis in pancreatic carcinoma cells. Also, downregulation of XIAP significantly increased CD95-induced cell death. Importantly, knockdown of XIAP strongly inhibited clonogenicity of pancreatic cancer cells treated with TRAIL indicating that XIAP promotes clonogenic survival of pancreatic carcinoma cells. Thus, our findings for the first time indicate that targeting XIAP represents a promising strategy to enhance the antitumor activity of TRAIL in pancreatic cancer, which has important clinical implications."
https://openalex.org/W2125775877,"Independently, superoxide (O2-) and nitric oxide (NO) are biologically important signaling molecules. When co-generated, these radicals react rapidly to form powerful oxidizing and nitrating intermediates. Although this reaction was once thought to be solely cytotoxic, herein we demonstrate using MCF7, macrophage, and endothelial cells that when nanomolar levels of NO and O2- were produced concomitantly, the effective NO concentration was established by the relative fluxes of these two radicals. Differential regulation of sGC, pERK, HIF-1α, and p53 were used as biological dosimeters for NO concentration. Introduction of intracellular- or extracellular-generated O2- during NO generation resulted in a concomitant increase in oxidative intermediates with a decrease in steady-state NO concentrations and a proportional reduction in the levels of sGC, ERK, HIF-1α, and p53 regulation. NO responses were restored by addition of SOD. The intermediates formed from the reactions of NO with O2- were non-toxic, did not form 3-nitrotyrosine, nor did they elicit any signal transduction responses. H2O2 in bolus or generated from the dismutation of O2- by SOD, was cytotoxic at high concentrations and activated p53 independent of NO. This effect was completely inhibited by catalase, suppressed by NO, and exacerbated by intracellular catalase inhibition. We conclude that the reaction of O2- with NO is an important regulatory mechanism, which modulates signaling pathways by limiting steady-state levels of NO and preventing H2O2 formation from O2-.

For example, HIF-1α, which is normally limited by proteasome degradation, is stabilized in the presence of NO (1Zhou J. Brune B. Toxicology. 2005; 208: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This leads to translocation to the nucleus, where it activates the transcription of various hypoxia survival genes (2Hirota K. Semenza G.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 338: 610-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Similarly, p53 becomes phosphorylated in response to various cellular stresses, including NO metabolites and reactive oxygen species (ROS). p53 phosphorylation can result in cell cycle arrest, which in some cases leads to apoptosis (3Sengupta S. Harris C.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 44-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Activation of HIF-1α or p53 therefore has opposing outcomes with respect to cell survival. We have shown previously how distinct threshold NO concentrations are necessary to elicit post-translational regulation of both p53 and HIF-1α. High levels of NO (≥300 nm) cause p53 phosphorylation, whereas intermediate levels (50–300 nm) induce HIF-1α accumulation (1Zhou J. Brune B. Toxicology. 2005; 208: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 4Thomas D.D. Espey M.G. Ridnour L.A. Hofseth L.J. Mancardi D. Harris C.C. Wink D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It has been proposed that one of the primary reactions of NO in vivo is its reaction with superoxide (O2-) (6Beckman J.S. Beckman T.W. Chen J. Marshall P.A. Freeman B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1620-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (6731) Google Scholar). This diffusion-controlled reaction between NO and O2- produces a variety of reactive intermediates that can nitrate, nitrosate, and oxidize many biologically important targets (7Brune B. Antioxid.

Nitrotyrosine formed from this reaction has been associated with functional aberrations in macromolecules. These mechanisms may be important in the etiology of many disease states leading to tissue injury and cell death. In contrast, a number of studies show that NO is a powerful antioxidant having the ability to abate ROS-mediated oxidative stress (11Wink D.A. Miranda K.M. Espey M.G. Pluta R.M. Hewett S.J. Colton C. Vitek M. Feelisch M. Grisham M.B. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2001; 3: 203-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The numerous and diametrically opposing outcomes attributed to the reaction of NO with O2- have led to much controversy concerning the role of these radicals in physiology and pathophysiology (12Pfeiffer S.

Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18515-18517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar). Therefore, cells and tissues with high relative concentrations of this enzyme limit the reaction of O2- with NO. This potentially increases local NO concentrations. Reports have shown that in the presence of O2-, NO-mediated post-translational regulation is abolished and that this can be reversed by the presence of SOD (17Houston M. Estevez A. Chumley P.

In cancer biology, the actions of nitric oxide have been shown to have both positive and detrimental effects. Reactive nitrogen oxide species have been implicated in both the initiation and promotion of carcinogenesis, yet these same chemical species have been linked to tumor growth suppression (18Hussain S.P. Hofseth L.J. Harris C.C. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 276-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (1429) Google Scholar). Nitric oxide can have beneficial as well as deleterious effects on tumor growth (19Pervin S.

Tzeng E.E. Geller D.A. Billiar T.R. Harris C.C. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1371-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Recent studies have indicated that these contradictory outcomes are linked to different susceptibilities in genotoxicity, cell death, angiogenesis, and metastasis as well as the p53 status of the tumor. Clinically it has been noted that tumors expressing elevated iNOS and nitrotyrosine indicate a poor prognosis (21Ekmekcioglu S. Ellerhorst J. Smid C.M. Prieto V.G. Munsell M. Buzaid A.C. Grimm E.A. Clin. Cancer Res. 2000; 6: 4768-4775PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, studies using a iNOS transfection xenograft nude mouse model demonstrated an inhibition of tumor growth in a NO concentration-dependent manner (22Le X. Wei D. Huang S. Lancaster Jr., J.R. Xie K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 8758-8763Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Tumor cells transfected with iNOS also resulted in decreased tumorigenesis, which was dependent on both the level of iNOS and the p53 status of the tumors (20Ambs S. Merriam W.G. Ogunfusika M.O.

Med. 1995; 181: 1333-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Other studies have demonstrated NOS expression was significantly higher in both primary tumors and lymph nodes than in normal gastric mucosa (25Feng C.W. Wang L.D. Jiao L.H. Liu B. Zheng S. Xie X.J. BMC Cancer. 2002; 2: 8Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 26Wang L. Shi G.G. Yao J.C. Gong W. Wei D. Wu T.T. Ajani J.A. Huang S. Xie K. Gastric Cancer. 2005; 8: 18-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These and other examples illustrate the dichotomous nature of NO in tumor biology. We and others (4Thomas D.D. Espey M.G. Ridnour L.A. Hofseth L.J. Mancardi D. Harris C.C. Wink D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 8894-8899Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 27Wang C. Trudel L.J. Wogan G.N. Deen W.M. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2003; 16: 1004-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) have shown that part of these discrepancies could be explained by different concentration dependence of specific signaling targets of NO. Higher NO concentrations activate p53 (>300 nm), while pro-growth mechanisms such as pERK, HIF-1α, and cGC, are activated at lower nanomolar levels (1Zhou J. Brune B. Toxicology. 2005; 208: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 4Thomas D.D. Espey M.G. Ridnour L.A. Hofseth L.J. Mancardi D. Harris C.C. Wink D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Med. 2004; 8: 423-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Similarly, in endothelial cells, low NO fluxes (≤1 nm) lead to increased proliferation and a down-regulation of the anti-angiogenic and tumor suppressor thrombospondin TSP-1 but higher doses induce MKP1 and phosphorylation of p53 (5Ridnour L.A. Isenberg J.S. Espey M.G. Thomas D.D. Roberts D.D. Wink D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13147-13152Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Based on these differences in sensitivities of specific signal transduction responses to NO, it follows that any situation resulting in changes in the steady-state NO concentration, such as its reaction with O2-, would have important implications toward cellular behavior. Although the simple concentration-dependent effects of NO are not the only explanation, the interaction of NO with ROS may provide important clues as to mechanisms of specific in vivo pathways. Here we have examined the effects of NO-mediated signaling in relation to superoxide and hydrogen peroxide. We demonstrate that the primary consequence of O2- generation concomitant with NO production is not the toxicity associated with the formation of higher nitrogen oxides, but rather the resultant phenotypic cellular changes that occur because of limiting the bioavailability of NO and H2O2. Materials—SOD (bovine erythrocytes), aminotriazole (ATZ), cytochrome c, catalase (CAT), hypoxanthine (HX), myoglobin (horse heart), 2,2′-azinobis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS), diethylenetriamienepentaacetic acid (DTPA), nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT), and dimethylformamide (DMF) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. 2,3-Dimethoxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (DMNQ) from Calbiochem. H2O2 was from Fisher Scientific. Other reagents were as follows: xanthine oxidase (XO; Roche Applied Science, Nutley, NJ), dihydrorhodamine 123 (DHR; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Sper/NO (spermine nonoate) was a generous gift from Drs. J. Saavedra and J. A. Hrabie, NCI-FCRDC, Frederick, MD. The stock (prepared in 10 mm NaOH) concentration was determined immediately prior to use by measuring the absorbance at 250 nm (ϵ = 8,000 m–1 cm–1). The NO/O2- Reaction—Superoxide was generated by XO-catalyzed degradation of HX (500 μm) in serum-free media. The rate of O2- production was determined by the rate of reduction of cytochrome c (550 nm, ϵ = 21,000 m–1 cm–1), as previously described. Under these conditions production of urate from xanthine was determined spectrophotometrically (305 nm; ϵ = 8030 m–1 cm–1) to be negligible. The calculated rate of NO release from 100 μm Sper/NO based on the decomposition rate (pH 7.4, 37 °C, t½ = 42 min) is 3.0 μm/min. The actual rate of 2.7 μm NO/min was verified by measuring oxymyoglobin oxidation (582 nm, ϵ = 9,200 m–1 cm–1) in HX/serum-free media and by the decomposition of Sper/NO (250 nm (ϵ = 8,000 m–1 cm–1). Measurement of steady-state concentrations of NO produced from Sper/NO during cell culture treatments was accomplished using a Seivers (Boulder, CO) NO gas analyzer. Aliquots of media (100 μl) from Sper/NO-treated cells were immediately injected into the reaction chamber containing 0.5 mm NaOH to stop NO donor decomposition and under anaerobic conditions (purged with helium) to eliminate NO autooxidation. Steady-state molar NO concentrations were calculated from the absolute amounts of NO detected. SOD Activity Assay—SOD activity was measured by the method of Spitz and Oberley (30Spitz D.R. Oberley L.W. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 8-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). This assay is based upon the reduction of NBT to blue formazan by O2-. One unit of SOD activity was defined as the amount required to yield 50% of sample maximum inhibition of NBT reduction by O2-. The activity of the SOD we used was 178.6 units/μg indicating >90% functional SOD. H2O2 was measured by ferrous iron oxidation in the presence of xylenol orange as previously described (31Nourooz-Zadeh J. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 300: 58-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Oxidation Assay—The strong oxidants generated from the NO/O2- reaction were measured by formation of the fluorescent compound rhodamine (RH) via two-electron oxidation of DHR (32Kooy N.W. Royall J.A. Ischiropoulos H. Beckman J.S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1994; 16: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). Immediately prior to use, stock solutions of 50 mmDHR (10 mg) were prepared in DMF (0.6 ml) and diluted 1000-fold into cell culture plates. After various concentrations of XO and or Sper/NO were added to the cultures, the reactions were allowed to proceed for 2 h at 37 °C (5% CO2 95%, air incubator). Fluorescence was measured at 570 nm following excitation at 500 nm. Measurements were made in the 6-well plates for total oxidation, or the media was removed and measured separately for extracellular oxidation, and PBS was replaced onto the cells (washed ×3) and measured to determine intracellular oxidation. Cell Culture—MCF7 human breast carcinoma cells (ATCC) were grown to 85% confluency in 6-well culture plates with RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT). Prior to treatments, the cells were incubated in 2 ml of serum-free RPMI 1640 medium overnight. All treatments were conducted under these culture conditions. Co-culture experiments: ANA-1 murine macrophages were activated with interferon-γ (10 ng/ml) for 16 h followed by LPS (10 ng/ml) for 4 h to induce iNOS expression. The cells were trypsinized, counted, and seeded on top of MCF-7 cells at various densities in serum-free media supplemented with either l-arginine (1 mm) or aminoguanidine (5 mm). ANA-1 cells are HIF-1α and p53-null and therefore do not interfere with the measurement of these proteins in MCF7 cells. ANA-1 cells only loosely adhers to the culture flask and/or MCF-7 cells during the treatment period and are easily removed by gentle washing of the MCF7 cells with PBS at the termination of the experiment. Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVECs, Cambrex, East Rutherford, NJ) were cultured in EGM media supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, epidermal growth factor, bovine brain extract, cortisone, gentamycin, penicillin, and streptomycin and maintained at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and room air. Prior to treatment, cells were trypsinized and plated at a density of 1 × 106 cells per 100-mm tissue culture dish and grown for 72 h. The cells were then washed with PBS and incubated in phenol red-free EGM media containing 5% fetal bovine serum, bovine brain extract, heparin, and penicillin. Western Blot—Protein cell extracts were made by washing cells in cold PBS, scraping plates, centrifuging, and resuspending in lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, and protease inhibitor mixture; Calbiochem, San Diego, CA). Following 30 min of incubation on ice, the samples were centrifuged at 14,000 × g, and the supernatant protein concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce). Protein samples of equal amounts were subjected to PAGE on 10% Tris-glycine acrylamide gels (Novex-Invitrogen). Following transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride Immunolon P membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA), samples were probed with rabbit polyclonal or mouse monoclonal antibodies (HIF-1α (Transduction Laboratories), ERK, p53 P-Ser-15, (Cell Signaling), HPRT (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Bands were visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:2,000–10,000; Sigma) and chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). HPRT protein-loading controls were run for each gel. Gels images were scanned using an AGFA DuoScan hiD scanner (Wilmington, MA) or Alpha Innotech Imaging system, and relevant bands were cropped to size using Photoshop 7.0 with no further manipulation. Densitometry was measured using AlphaEase® FC Stand Alone Software. Figures are representative of n ≥ 3 individual experiments. Clonogenic Assay—Cell survival/proliferation was measured by clonogenic assay with plating efficiency ranging between 85 and 95% as previously described (33Mitchell J.B. DeGraff W. Kaufman D. Krishna M.C. Samuni A. Finkelstein E. Ahn M.S. Hahn S.M. Gamson J. Russo A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 289: 62-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Briefly, stock cultures of each cell type were plated (7 × 106 cells/100-cm2 dish) and incubated for 24 h prior to treatment. After treatments, cells were washed, trypsinized, counted, and plated in triplicate for macroscopic colony formation. Following a 10–14-day incubation period, colonies were fixed, stained, and counted. Colonies containing >50 cells were scored. cGMP Measurement—cGMP was measured using the enzyme immunoassay (EIA) Biotrak system (Amersham Biosciences). Cells were grown in 96-well plates, serum-starved overnight and subjected to various treatment conditions. The cells were washed, lysed, and the supernatant transferred to the EIA plate for cGMP measurement. Threshold NO Concentrations Regulate HIF-1α and p53—It has been demonstrated that NO causes p53 serine 15 phosphorylation and HIF-1α accumulation in a concentration-dependent manner (1Zhou J. Brune B. Toxicology. 2005; 208: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 4Thomas D.D. Espey M.G. Ridnour L.A. Hofseth L.J. Mancardi D. Harris C.C. Wink D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 8894-8899Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 28Metzen E. Zhou J. Jelkmann W. Fandrey J. Brune B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3470-3481Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). When increasing concentrations of the NO donor Sper/NO (25–100 μm) were added to MCF7 cells, both p53 P-Ser-15 and HIF-1α increased (Fig. 1.) These changes were compared with the mean steady-state NO concentrations measured in the media of the Sper/NO-treated cells (Fig. 1). The concentration of NO necessary for HIF-1α stabilization and p53 P-Ser-15 correlated to the steady-state NO concentrations as previously reported (4Thomas D.D. Espey M.G. Ridnour L.A. Hofseth L.J. Mancardi D. Harris C.C. Wink D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 8894-8899Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). HIF-1α and p53 Regulation by Other Radical/Oxidant Species—Because p53 P-Ser-15, HIF-1α, and ERK are regulated by distinct threshold concentrations of NO in MCF7 cells (4Thomas D.D. Espey M.G. Ridnour L.A. Hofseth L.J. Mancardi D. Harris C.C. Wink D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 8894-8899Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), we evaluated the effect of extracellular O2- and H2O2. Fig. 2 shows the effect of various RNOS (NO, O2-, H2O2, ONOO–) on HIF-1α and p53 P-Ser-15 regulation in MCF7 cells. Treatment with the NO donor Sper/NO (100 μm, 2 h) showed both HIF-1α and p53 P-Ser-15 were stabilized as previously described (lane 2). However, in the presence of HX/XO, there was a decrease in NO-mediated HIF-1α accumulation but p53 P-Ser-15 was maintained (compare lane 6 and lane 2). These results suggest that ROS differentially modulate the effects of NO on these two proteins. To determine the direct effects of ROS on p53 and HIF-1α signaling, MCF7 cells were treated only with XO plus HX. p53 phosphorylation (P-Ser-15) was detected whereas HIF-1α was not (lane 3). Under these same conditions, with the addition of SOD, which converts O2- to H2O2, the results did not change, and only p53 P-Ser-15 was detected (lane 4). However, in the presence of catalase, which converts H2O2 to H2O and O2, neither HIF-1α nor p53 P-Ser-15 were detected (lane 5). These findings suggest that H2O2 but not O2- induces p53 P-Ser-15 stabilization but not HIF-1α. Quantifying the Effect of H2O2 on p53 Phosphorylation in MCF7 Cells—Fig. 3A demonstrates the effect of increasing concentrations of bolus H2O2 on the activation of HIF-1α, p53 P-Ser-15, and pERK. Only p53 P-Ser-15 was detected after 2 and 4 h (not shown) at H2O2 concentrations ≥50 μm. This is consistent with the findings that only H2O2 from HX/XO mediates phosphorylation of p53. When repeated additions of 25 μm H2O2 were added every 30 min, p53 P-Ser-15 was detectable after 3 h in cells exposed to 2 or more additions of H2O2 (≥50 μm accumulative H2O2) (data not shown). This indicated that the duration of exposure to H2O2 is equally as important as its concentration. To better define the temporal dependence of H2O2-mediated p53 phosphorylation, cells were treated with H2O2 for different time intervals. The cells in Fig. 3B were treated with 100 μm H2O2. The media was then removed at the indicated time points and replaced with fresh media. All cells were incubated and harvested 8 h after treatment. These data indicate that ≤15 min of H2O2 exposure was required to elicit phosphorylation of p53, after which they are committed, and p53 P-Ser-15 was detected for >8 h. Phosphorylation of p53 Ser-15 occurred in as little as 15 min after H2O2 exposure (Fig. 3C). Thus, H2O2 initiates a sustained signal cascade that manifests itself rapidly after treatment. H2O2 Metabolism and p53 Signaling in MCF7 Cells—We previously reported that the duration of exposure time to NO is critical in the activation of p53 P-Ser-15 (4Thomas D.D. Espey M.G. Ridnour L.A. Hofseth L.J. Mancardi D. Harris C.C. Wink D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 8894-8899Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). It was important to determine if this was true for H2O2. To estimate the exposure time for cells upon bolus addition of H2O2 we first determined the rate of H2O2 metabolism by MCF7 cells in culture. MCF7 cells were exposed to bolus addition of H2O2 and the loss of H2O2 was quantified. Fig. 4, A and B demonstrates that when 100 μm bolus of H2O2 was added to MCF7 cells in culture, it was metabolized in a first-order manner with a rate of kobs ≈ –0.0649 min–1, –1.73 × 10–7 min–1 cell–1. Fig. 4C shows that this rate was proportional to the two-dimensional density of the MCF7 cell monolayer. When aminotriazole, a catalase inhibitor, was added, the rate of H2O2 metabolism decreased (Fig. 4C) similar to what has been reported previously for other cell types (34Watanabe N. Forman H.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 411: 145-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Unlike NO, it appears that cell membranes pose important limiting barriers for the partitioning and diffusion of H2O2 (35Branco M.R. Marinho H.S. Cyrne L. Antunes F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6501-6506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 36Makino N. Sasaki K. Hashida K. Sakakura Y. Biochim. Biophys.

A. 2001; 98: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). To test this, MCF7 cells were harvested and placed in suspension at various concentrations to increase their density. Fig. 3D demonstrates that even in the presence of 1 × 107 MCF7 cells/ml, p53 P-Ser-15 was detected after 2 h in the presence of 100 μm H2O2. The half-life of NO at this cell density is calculated to be <0.5 s (37Thomas D.D. Liu X. Kantrow S.P. Lancaster Jr., J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar), far too short to exert an effect on p53 phosphorylation. This demonstrates that the rate of H2O2 metabolism is slow relative to the rate of NO metabolism and therefore the exposure time of cellular targets to H2O2 is greater than that for NO. It has been shown previously that H2O2 is primarily metabolized in cells by catalase and glutathione peroxidase (34Watanabe N. Forman H.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 411: 145-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Pharmacologic catalase inhibition should therefore further extend the half-life (exposure time) of H2O2 and increase its biological effects (Fig. 4C). When MCF7 cells were incubated for 3 h with increasing H2O2 concentrations, a dose-dependent increase in p53 P-Ser-15 was observed (Figs. 3 and 5). In the presence of aminotriazole, a potent catalase inhibitor, the minimum dose of H2O2 necessary to induce p53 phosphorylation was decreased and the response at higher concentrations was markedly more robust (Fig. 5). Because both NO and H2O2 independently induce p53 phosphorylation, we expected the result to be additive when both molecules were present simultaneously. Remarkably, concurrent NO and H2O2 exposure demonstrated the opposite effect on p53 phosphorylation (Fig. 5). When increasing concentrations of H2O2 were incubated with NO (Sper/NO 50 μm) the response of p53 was suppressed in MCF7 cells. NO did not affect the rate of H2O2 metabolism (data not shown). These surprising results indicate that NO and H2O2 antagonize each other's activity to induce p53 phosphorylation. Oxidants Formed from the Reaction of NO with O2-—The chemistry of NO and O2- dictates that the oxidants formed from this reaction are at a maximal yield when the fluxes of both radicals are equal. When the flux of either radical is varied with respect to the"
https://openalex.org/W2036018178,"Kruppel-like factor 8 (KLF8) is a member of the family of KLF transcription factors. Several KLF members have been shown to play a role in oncogenesis. We have previously demonstrated that KLF8 mediates cell cycle progression downstream of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) by upregulating cyclin D1. FAK plays a critical role in transformation and tumorigenesis and is aberrantly upregulated in many types of human cancer. Little is known about the function of KLF8 in these regards. Here we provide evidence suggesting a novel role of KLF8 in oncogenic transformation. We show that KLF8 expression is elevated in several types of human cancer cells and primary tumor tissues. Induced expression of ectopic KLF8 causes serum-independent growth and morphological transformation in NIH3T3 cells and enhances anchorage-independent growth of v-Src-transformed cells. In contrast, expression of a dominant-negative mutant of KLF8 dramatically suppresses the transformed phenotypes induced by v-Src. In addition, the KLF8-enhanced transformation in the v-Src cells was prevented by ablating cyclin D1 expression. Overall, these results indicate that KLF8 is required for v-Src-induced transformation and may play a role in tumor progression of human cancer."

All efforts to identify a protein or glycolipid receptor have failed, and the fact that liposomes composed solely of phosphatidylcholine are efficiently permeabilized adds to the enigma. A novel concept is advanced here to explain the puzzle. We propose that low affinity binding moieties can assume the role of high affinity binding sites due to their spatial arrangement in the membrane. Evidence is presented that phosphocholine head groups of sphingomyelin, clustered in sphingomyelin-cholesterol microdomains, serve this function for α-toxin. Clustering is required so that oligomerization, which is prerequisite for stable attachment of the toxin to the membrane, can efficiently occur. Outside these clusters, binding to phosphocholine is too transient for toxin monomers to find each other. The principle of membrane targeting in the absence of any genuine, high affinity receptor may also underlie the assembly of other lipid-inserted oligomers including cytotoxic peptides, protein toxins, and immune effector molecules.

The principle of membrane targeting in the absence of any genuine, high affinity receptor may also underlie the assembly of other lipid-inserted oligomers including cytotoxic peptides, protein toxins, and immune effector molecules. Staphylococcal α-toxin, archetype of a pore-forming cytolysin, is secreted as a water-soluble, 34-kDa monomer that binds to target membranes and then oligomerizes to form membrane-inserted heptameric channels (1Bayley H. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 56: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 2Bhakdi S. Tranum-Jensen J. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55: 733-751Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of the monomer can be deduced from the recently solved structure of the related staphylococcal LukF leukocidin (3Olson R. Nariya H. Yokota K. Kamio Y. Gouaux E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 134-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), and the structure of the heptamer is also known (4Song L. Hobaugh M.R. Shustak C. Cheley S. Bayley H. Gouaux J.E.

Membrane-bound monomers interact with each other to form homotypic oligomeric prepores that initially lack permeabilizing activity. Early prepores are stable in non-denaturing detergents but unstable in SDS. Cooperative conformational changes transform the early to the late prepore, which resists dissociation in SDS at 25 °C. The transmembrane channel is formed when the pore-forming amino acid sequence finally inserts into the bilayer to create an amphipathic membrane-spanning β-barrel (8Valeva A. Palmer M. Hilgert K.

One major unresolved question relates to the molecular nature of the physiologically relevant binding site on target cells. This issue is surrounded by paradoxes. Mammalian cells differ widely in their susceptibility to permeabilization by α-toxin, classic extremes being represented by rabbit and human erythrocytes. The former are lysed by nanomolar concentrations of the toxin, whereas lysis of human erythrocytes first occurs at 200-fold higher concentrations. Binding studies have revealed the existence of high affinity, saturable interaction sites on rabbit cells that are absent on human erythrocytes. However, both cell types additionally have low affinity binding sites, which are responsible for lysis of the “resistant” human cells at high toxin concentrations (12Hildebrand A. Pohl M. Bhakdi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17195-17200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All efforts to identify a classic receptor on susceptible target cells have failed. The issue is further confounded by the fact that liposomes and lipid bilayers composed solely of phosphatidylcholine are highly susceptible to permeabilization by α-toxin (13Ikigai H. Nakae T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2156-2160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, a protein or glycolipid receptor is not required for the toxin to bind to membranes and form channels in the first place. Watanabe et al. (14Watanabe M. Tomita T. Yasuda T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 898: 257-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) have considered that phosphatidylcholine might be the ligand for α-toxin. This suggestion derived from the observation that phosphocholine could inhibit toxin-dependent permeabilization of liposomes, albeit only at very high concentrations of ≥20 mm. According to the crystal structure of leukocidin, members of this toxin family indeed possess a putative binding site for phosphocholine (3Olson R. Nariya H. Yokota K. Kamio Y. Gouaux E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 134-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Thus, we are faced with another paradox that a molecule destined to interact with α-toxin apparently does so with an affinity that is so low as to render a biological relevance improbable. Here, a concept is advanced that provides an explanation for the past findings. It is proposed that, by clustering, low affinity binding moieties can assume the role of high affinity “receptors” because they render rapid toxin oligomerization possible. In the absence of clustering, binding of toxin monomers will be too transient to support oligomerization at low concentrations of toxin. Phosphocholine head groups fulfill this function in the case ofα-toxin, and their clustering on susceptible cells occurs through the association of sphingomyelin with cholesterol. Sphingomyelin-cholesterol-rich microdomains represent operational units in which clusters of proteins and lipids coordinately exert their functions (15Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2551) Google Scholar, 16Harder T. Simons K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 534-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar, 17Simons K. Ikonen E.

Interaction with clustered low affinity binding sites may underlie the physiological action of other oligomerizing toxins and effector molecules of the immune system.

There are no appreciable differences in the contents of other major phospholipids or cholesterol in these cells (19Hanada K. Hara T. Fukasawa M. Yamaji A. Umeda M. Nishijima M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33787-33794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 20Hanada K. Nishijima M. Kiso M. Hasegawa A. Fujita S. Ogawa T. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol.

For culture in different media, the mutant and revertant cells were seeded into a 100-mm Petri dish containing 5 ml of normal culture medium and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. Then cell monolayers were cultured in Nutridoma medium with 10% FCS to normalize their sphingomylin content or in Nutridoma BO-medium or in Nutridoma-medium for 3 days at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Lysis Inhibition by Phosphocholine—α-Toxin was preincubated in a microtiter plate with increasing concentrations of phosphocholine in a total volume of 100 μl of HBSS for 30 min, 22 °C. One-hundred microliters of a rabbit erythrocyte suspension (5 × 108/ml) were then added to each well. After 1 h, 22 °C, the plates were centrifuged, and hemolysis was quantified by measurement of hemoglobin absorption at 412 nm. Cholesterol Depletion—Cholesterol extraction from rabbit erythrocytes was performed using phosphatidylcholine liposomes (22Frenkel E.J. Kuypers F.A. Op den Kamp J.A. Roelofsen B. Ott P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 855: 293-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 23Giraud F. M'Zali H. Chailley B. Mazet F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 778: 191-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Rabbit erythrocytes (4 × 108 cells/ml) were incubated with 1 mm phosphatidylcholine liposomes at 37 °C. After 3 h, the cells were sedimented and washed five times with HBSS. Cholesterol extraction from nucleated cells was achieved using methyl-β-cyclodextrin (Sigma). THP-1 cells (4 × 106 cells/ml) were incubated with 10 mm methyl-β-cyclodextrin in DMEM for 30 min, 37 °C, and washed three times with DMEM. Half of the cells were used for binding or spectrofluorometric studies; the other half were washed in HBSS, and a cholesterol determination (Roche Diagnostics) was performed. Labeling of Phosphocholine—Fibroblasts were cultured in the presence of [3H]choline chloride (1 μCi per culture dish) in DMEM with 1% FCS at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 3 h. Cells were washed three times with DMEM and treated with 0.1 unit/ml Bacillus cereus-sphingomyelinase (Sigma) or 0.1 unit/ml B. cereus-phospholipase C (Calbiochem, Bad Soden, Germany) or with 10 mm methyl-β-cyclodextrin in DMEM. Cell-associated radioactivity and radioactivity in cell supernatants were determined after 30 min, 37 °C. Determination of Sphingomyelin and Phosphatidylcholine—Cells were seeded, incubated in the normal culture medium for 1 day, and after washing with serum-free medium were cultured in Nutridoma medium with 10% FCS or in Nutridoma BO-medium or sphingomyelin-free Nutridoma medium for 3 days at 37 °C. The cells were prelabeled with [3H]choline (1 μCi/ml, overnight; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). At the end of the incubation, cells were washed and harvested by scraping, lipids were extracted with chloroform/methanol (ratio 2:1) (24Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and unlabeled sphingomyelin and phosphatidylcholine were added as internal standards. Phospholipids were separated by thin-layer chromatography on silica 60 gel plates (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) using chloroform/methanol/acetic acid (65/25/10 v/v) as solvent and stained by iodine vapor, and the spots corresponding to sphingomyelin and phosphatidylcholine were scraped off and counted for radioactivity in a liquid scintillation counter. Liposome Preparation—Lipid films containing 1 mg of total lipid in different molar ratios were dried down from chloroform/methanol (2,1 v/v) under nitrogen and then rehydrated in 1 ml of HBSS, pH 7.5. Liposomes containing sphingomyelin were rehydrated at 45 °C, while the others were rehydrated at room temperature. Liposomes were rapidly frozen (–70 °C acetone bath) and thawed (45 °C water bath) six times. After freeze-thawing, liposomes were passed through a 0.1-μm polycarbonate filter (Nuclepore, Clifton NJ) 10 times, using a Miniextruder (Avanit Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL). The sphingomyelin liposomes were extruded at 45 °C, and the others were extruded at room temperature. Quantitation of α-Toxin Binding—Binding studies using erythrocytes were performed with the radioiodinated α-toxin as described (12Hildebrand A. Pohl M. Bhakdi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17195-17200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fluorescein-labeled G130C α-toxin was used in binding studies with nucleated cells and liposomes. THP-1 cells or CHO cells were incubated with 30 nm fluorescein-labeled G130C α-toxin for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing, cells were resuspended in 1 ml of HBSS, and bound toxin was quantified by spectrofluorometry. Fluorescence emission spectra were recorded in a Spex Fluoromax fluorometer (wavelength, excitation: 488 nm, emission: 500–550 nm, scanning interval: 1 nm). The spectra of appropriate blanks (buffer or cell suspension) were recorded and subtracted from the sample spectra. In the liposome experiments, membrane-bound and free toxin were separated by flotation. Fluorescein-labeled α-toxin was incubated with the liposomes for 2 h, 25 °C, and sucrose was added to 25% (w/v). 3-ml samples were applied to the bottom of centrifuge tubes and were overlayered with 1 ml of 20% sucrose, 1 ml of 15% sucrose, and 0.2 ml of HBSS. The liposomes were floated to the top of the gradient by centrifugation overnight in an SW50.1 swing-out rotor (150,000 × g, 4 °C), and the lipid-associated fluorescence was analyzed by spectrofluorometry and SDS-PAGE. In the kinetic experiments, liposomes with 40% cholesterol, either 10% PC or 10% SM, and supplemented with 25% of PE and phosphatidylserine (PS) each were mixed with pyrene-labeled toxin (mutant S3C) in a stopped-flow apparatus (SF-61-DX2, HiTech, Salisbury, UK). The excitation wavelength was set to 335 nm. Emitted light was collected employing a filter cutting wavelengths below 455 nm. Experiments were performed at 20 °C in HBSS buffer. Labeling of the toxin was performed as described (25Valeva A. Pongs J. Bhakdi S. Palmer M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1325: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Non-denaturing PAGE—The native gel electrophoresis system described previously was used (26Zitzer A. Harris J.R. Kemminer S.E. Zitzer O. Bhakdi S. Muething J. Palmer M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1509: 264-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), with the exception that electrophoresis buffer contained 25 mm rather than 2.5 mm deoxycholate. In these experiments, a 1% suspension of rabbit erythrocyte ghosts was incubated with 30 nm of biotinylated G130C α-toxin. After 1-, 5-, or 10-min incubation on ice, membranes were pelleted, washed with ice-cold buffer, and solubilized at 4 °C with 5% (v/v) Triton X-100. Unsolubilized material was removed by centrifugation, and supernatants were subjected to non-denaturing PAGE and SDS-PAGE. Gels were subsequently blotted, and α-toxin bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence using streptavidin-peroxidase (BM chemiluminescence blotting substrate, Roche Diagnostics). Cholesterol Depletion Selectively Destroys the High Affinity Binding Site for α-Toxin on Rabbit Erythrocytes—Rabbit erythrocytes were suspended in buffer containing 15 mm dextran 4 to prevent hemolysis and depleted of cholesterol by incubation with liposomes (22Frenkel E.J. Kuypers F.A. Op den Kamp J.A. Roelofsen B. Ott P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 855: 293-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 23Giraud F. M'Zali H. Chailley B. Mazet F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 778: 191-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This method was employed because rapid depletion with methyl-β-cyclodextrin led to high cellular fragility and spontaneous hemolysis. In contrast, use of liposomes led to slow depletion that could be terminated before the cells became too fragile. Cells containing 18 ± 5% of their original cholesterol content could thus be recovered and used in the binding experiments. These were performed as originally described (12Hildebrand A. Pohl M. Bhakdi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17195-17200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were incubated with radiolabeled α-toxin tracer in the absence or presence of increasing amounts of unlabeled toxin. As seen in Fig. 1, binding of the tracer occurred to native rabbit erythrocytes, and binding was competed away by unlabeled toxin at ∼10–8 m. These data duplicated the published results (12Hildebrand A. Pohl M. Bhakdi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17195-17200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and revealed the presence of saturable, high affinity binding sites on the cells. When the concentration of unlabeled toxin was increased above 10–7 m, binding of the radioactive tracer recurred. This again was as previously described (12Hildebrand A. Pohl M. Bhakdi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17195-17200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and demonstrated the presence of a second population of non-saturable binding sites. When cholesterol-depleted rabbit erythrocytes were employed, a completely different mode of toxin binding was observed that duplicated the results previously obtained with human erythrocytes. Then, no binding of the toxin tracer was observed in the absence or presence of low concentrations of unlabeled toxin. This revealed that the saturable, high affinity binding sites had been lost. When the concentration of unlabeled toxin was increased above 10–7 m, binding of the tracer again occurred, indicating retainment of the low affinity, saturable binding sites. Thus, in effect, rabbit erythrocytes could be transformed to the resistant human phenotype (12Hildebrand A. Pohl M. Bhakdi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17195-17200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) through depletion of membrane cholesterol. High Affinity Interaction of α-Toxin with THP-1 Cells Is Abrogated Both by Cholesterol Extraction and by Sphingomyelinase Treatment—In the experiment of Fig. 2, THP-1 cells were either depleted of cholesterol by incubation with methyl-β-cyclodextrin (27Ilangumaran S. Hoessli D.C. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 28Yancey P.G. Rodrigueza W.V. Kilsdonk E.P. Stoudt G.W. Johnson W.J. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16026-16034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar), or they were treated with sphingomyelinase or with phospholipase C from B. cereus. Sphingomyelinase, but not B. cereus phospholipase C, cleaves sphingomyelin in biological membranes (29Titball R.W. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 347-366Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). α-Toxin was applied at 30 nm so that binding would occur only via high affinity interaction. As shown in Fig. 2, treatment with methyl-β-cyclodextrin or with sphingomyelinase led to marked reduction in α-toxin binding, whereas binding was not affected by treatment with phospholipase C. To ascertain that sphingomyelinase and methyl-β-cyclodextrin exerted distinct effects, fibroblasts were pulsed with [3H]choline to label the phosphocholine head groups. As shown in Table 1, sphingomyelinase, but not methyl-β-cyclodextrin, provoked loss of the marker to the cell supernatants. Cholesterol determinations confirmed that sphingomyelinase treatment did not lead to reduction of cellular cholesterol. When phospholipase C was applied, it was found that this enzyme, which cleaves phosphatidylcholine but not sphingomyelin (29Titball R.W. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 347-366Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), did not remove appreciable amounts of phosphocholine from the intact cells (Table 1). This concurred with early work showing that phosphatidylcholine headgroups are not readily accessible to B. cereus phospholipase C in biological membranes (29Titball R.W. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 347-366Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).TABLE 1Distribution of [3H]choline after treatment of labeled cells with sphingomyelinase, methyl-β-cyclodextrin, and phospholipase CTreatmentNo treatmentSphingomyelinase, 0.1 unit/mlCyclodextrin, 10 mmPhospholipase C, 0.1 unit/mlCells62,35551,79861,79660,182Supernatant6,70917,2397,1267,082 Open table in a new tab Reduction of toxin binding was mirrored by abrogation of cytotoxicity, both cholesterol-depleted and sphingomyelinase-treated cells withstood incubation with 30 nm α-toxin without loss of ATP for 2 h. However, when toxin doses were raised to >200 nm, membrane permeabilization occurred in all cells (data not shown). Millimolar Concentrations of Phosphocholine Compete for Binding of α-Toxin to Rabbit Erythrocytes—The lysis inhibition experiments reported by Watanabe et al. (14Watanabe M. Tomita T. Yasuda T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 898: 257-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) employed lecithin liposomes as targets, but analogous experiments using susceptible cells have not been performed. In the experiment of Fig. 3, hemolytic titration of α-toxin was performed in the presence of increasing concentrations of phosphocholine. It was found that phosphocholine inhibited binding of α-toxin to the high affinity binding sites, with 50% lysis inhibition being observed at ∼0.6 mm of the ligand. Reduced Binding of α-Toxin to Sphingomyelin-deficient Cells—To directly test whether phosphocholine head groups of sphingomyelin might indeed participate in binding α-toxin, experiments were conducted in CHO mutant cells (LY-B) and revertant cells (LY-B/cLCB1). The results of sphingomyelin determinations in these cells are shown in Table 2. The sphingomyelin content was normal in both cells following incubation in FCS. Sphingomyelin content was reduced by ∼70% when either cell line was cultured in sphingomyelin-free medium. In contrast, culture in Nutridoma BO medium led to normalization of sphingomyelin content in the revertant cells, whereas the content in the mutant LY-B cells remained low.TABLE 2Sphingomyelin/phosphatidylcholine content of Ly-B and Ly-B/cLCB1 cellsCells and medium, phosphatidylcholineSphingomyelinPhosphatidylcholine%Ly-B/10% FCS100.0100.0Ly-B/sphingomyelin-free23.696.2Ly-B/BO29.092.4Ly-B/cLCB1/10% FCS93.5103.1Ly-B/cLCB1/sphingomyelin-free33.0104.1LY-B/cLBC1/BO91.098.3 Open table in a new tab Fig. 4 shows the respective toxin binding data. Equivalent amounts of toxin became bound to revertant (R) or mutant (M) cells following culture in FCS (A). After selective replenishment of sphingomyelin in the revertant cells (B), these bound normal amounts of α-toxin, whereas binding to the mutant cells was approximately halved. In the absence of sphingomyelin replenishment, both cells displayed reduced toxin binding capacity (C). Sphingomyelin and Cholesterol Together Generate the Binding Site for α-Toxin in Liposomes—Fluorescein-labeled α-toxin was applied at 30 nm to liposomes containing an equimolar mix of PE and PS with varying supplements. As shown in Fig. 5A, addition of either 40 mol % cholesterol or 20 mol % sphingomyelin led to no appreciable toxin binding. However, binding occurred when both cholesterol and sphingomyelin were present. When the latter liposomes were treated with sphingomyelinase, the binding site disappeared. The essential role of phosphocholine became further apparent from the lack of toxin binding to liposomes supplemented with cholesterol and 20% ceramide. These findings indicated that the phosphocholine head groups of sphingomyelin most likely represented the toxin binding sites but that they needed to be clustered through aggregation with cholesterol to fulfill their function. To corroborate this contention, PS/PE liposomes containing 40 mol % cholesterol were supplemented with 5 mol % phosphatidylcholine or 5 mol % sphingomyelin. As shown in Fig. 5B, only liposomes containing cholesterol + sphingomyelin bound α-toxin; phosphatidylcholine was not effective. However, when the phosphatidylcholine concentration was raised to 40 mol %, binding activity appeared (Fig. 5B). This binding was found to no longer depend on the presence of cholesterol. We concluded that at the latter concentration, the phosphocholine head groups are densely enough distributed on the membrane to support toxin oligomerization independent of cholesterol. Evidence That α-Toxin Molecules Bind in Clusters on the Membrane—The collective results pointed to the possibility that α-toxin might be binding primarily to clustered phosphocholine head groups, and this might allow the toxin monomers to immediately oligomerize at the binding sites. To test this, rabbit erythrocyte membranes were exposed to 30 nm α-toxin on ice for 1, 5, or 10 min, washed, and solubilized in Triton X-100. Native PAGE was performed in deoxycholate to differentiate monomers from the detergent-st"
https://openalex.org/W1965458421,"The regulation of cell function by fibroblast growth factors (FGF) occurs through a dual receptor system consisting of a receptor-tyrosine kinase, FGFR and the glycosaminoglycan heparan sulfate (HS). Mutations of some potential N-glycosylation sites in human fgfr lead to phenotypes characteristic of receptor overactivation. To establish how N-glycosylation may affect FGFR function, soluble- and membrane-bound recombinant receptors corresponding to the extracellular ligand binding domain of FGFR1-IIIc were produced in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells. Both forms of FGFR1-IIIc were observed to be heavily N-glycosylated and migrated on SDS-PAGE as a series of multiple bands between 50 and 75 kDa, whereas the deglycosylated receptors migrated at 32 kDa, corresponding to the expected molecular weight of the polypeptides. Optical biosensor and quartz crystal microbalance-dissipation binding assays show that the removal of the N-glycans from FGFR1-IIIc caused an increase in the binding of the receptor to FGF-2 and to heparin-derived oligosaccharides, a proxy for cellular HS. This effect is mediated by N-glycosylation reducing the association rate constant of the receptor for FGF-2 and heparin oligosaccharides. N-Glycans were analyzed by mass spectrometry, which demonstrates a predominance of bi- and tri-antennary core-fucosylated complex type structures carrying one, two, and/or three sialic acids.

In humans and rodents there are 22 genes encoding more than 30 different FGF proteins and the fgfr 1-4 genes encode over 48 major isoforms of the cognate receptor tyrosine kinase (FGFR) (1Ornitz D.M.

The interaction of FGFs with HS is required for the stimulation of cell proliferation, which is initiated by the formation of a complex of FGF ligand, HS co-receptor and FGFR (9Delehedde M. Seve M.

Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2005; 16: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1503) Google Scholar). Not surprisingly for a family of key regulatory ligands, the activation of FGF signaling is subjected to multiple regulatory inputs, some of which operate at the level of the assembly of the receptor-ligand complex, whereas others operate inside the cell, on the active receptor complex. Regulatory inputs that operate extracellularly include partial selectivity in the choice of ligand by certain receptor isoforms. FGF-7 is the most specific FGF ligand, because it only interacts with the IIIb isoform of FGFR2; other FGFs show varying degrees of promiscuity in terms of their FGFR preference (12Ornitz D.M. Xu J.

Hum. Mutat. 1996; 8: 386-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The latter observations suggest that N-glycosylation of FGFR may constitute a fourth regulatory input. To ascertain whether N-glycans on FGFR may regulate aspects of the assembly of the FGF ligand-receptor complex, the extracellular ligand binding domain of FGFR1-IIIc was expressed in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells. We observed that it was heavily N-glycosylated and that multiple glycoforms of the receptor protein existed. The N-glycans were found to inhibit the interaction between FGFR1 and its FGF-2 ligand and HS co-receptor. The results suggest that N-glycosylation of FGFR1 represents an important additional pathway for the regulation of activity of the FGF receptor. Materials—Restriction enzymes and Vent polymerase were from New England Biolabs (Wilbury Way Hitchin, Herts, UK). Lipofectamine and Ni-NTA-agarose resin were from Invitrogen. CHO cells were the generous gift of Dr. D. Moss, University of Liverpool and were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Nutrient Mixture F-12 Ham (DMEM/F-12 Ham) supplemented with 5% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). Recombinant human FGF-2 was produced as described (25Ke Y. Wilkinson M.C. Fernig D.G. Smith J.A. Rudland P.S. Barraclough R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1131: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Heparin-derived dodecasaccharides were prepared from partial heparinase I digests of pig mucosal heparin and were obtained from Iduron (Manchester, UK). Bis[sulfosuccinimidyl] suberate, BS3, was from Perbio (Chester, UK). N-(3-Dimethylaminopropyl)-N′-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride, EDC, was from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland). Thrombin, streptavidin, 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid, ethanolamine, hydrazine monohydrate and antibody to His6 were from Sigma. Strep-Tactinhorseradish peroxidase and Strep-Tactin-Sepharose resin were from IBA (Goettingen, Germany). Factor Xa was purchased from Roche Diagnostics (Lewes, East Sussex, UK) and N-glycanase (peptide N-glycosidase F) from Prozyme (Ely, UK). Plasmid Constructions—Two recombinant forms of the extracellular ligand binding domain of rat FGFR1-IIIc (26Yan G.C. Wang F. Fukabori Y. Sussman D. Hou J.Z. Mckeehan W.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 183: 423-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) (amino acids 120-368 comprising the acid box and immunoglobulin loops D2 and D3) were produced. A soluble form of the receptor possessed a poly-histidine tail (His6) sequence followed by a thrombin cleavage site at the N terminus and a Factor Xa cleavage site followed by a Strep-Tag II sequence (27Schmidt T.G. Koepke J. Frank R. Skerra A. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 255: 753-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) at the C terminus and is termed FGFR1-ST (Fig. 1A). A membrane-bound form of the receptor possessed the same N-terminal His6 sequence and thrombin cleavage site, but after the Factor Xa cleavage site a GPI anchor attachment sequence replaced the Strep-Tag II sequence. This form of the receptor is termed FGFR1-GPI (Fig. 1A). Constructs encoding these two proteins were obtained using as a template pcDNA-h-fgfr1-gpi (gift from Dr. M. Seve, University of Liverpool) which corresponds to the rat fgfr1-IIIc sequence (amino acids 120-368) flanked by secretion signal and polyhistidine (His6) sequences in 5′ and a sequence encoding a GPI attachment sequence in 3′ (28Lodge A.P. Howard M.R. McNamee C.J. Moss D.J. Brain. Res. Mol. Brain. Res. 2000; 82: 84-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). By performing two-step polymerase chain reactions (PCR) (29Horton R.M. Pease L.R. McPherson M.J. Directed Mutagenesis, A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1991Google Scholar) using sets of appropriate primers, sequences encoding cleavage sites for thrombin and for Factor Xa, as well as Strep-Tag II were introduced (Fig. 1B). Expression and Purification of FGFR1-ST and FGFR1-GPI Proteins—pcDNA-ht-fgfr1-xgpi and pcDNA-ht-fgfr1-xst constructs were linearized by digestion with BglII and transfected into CHO cells using Lipofectamine. Transfectants were selected by resistance to G418. For the soluble FGFR1-ST protein, clones expressing around 1 μg of receptor protein/ml culture medium were identified after plating into 96-well plates and Western blotting of culture medium with anti-His6. For the membrane-bound FGFR1-GPI, FACS using a Coulter Epics Altra flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton CA) was used to isolate a population of cells expressing the highest levels of receptor protein by labeling the cells with anti-His6 antibody and a second FITC-conjugated antibody. The population of cells identified and sorted by FACS were then plated into 96-well plates and clones expressing the highest levels of FGFR1-GPI were identified by Western blotting of cell extracts. The highest levels of expression of receptor protein for all clones was obtained by growing the cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Nutrient Mixture F-12 Ham supplemented with 0.5% (v/v) fetal calf serum for 72 h. In some experiments cells were cultured in the presence of 3 μg/ml tunicamycin for 24-48 h and recombinant proteins analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot. For FGFR1-ST protein expression, cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Nutrient Mixture F-12 Ham supplemented with 0.5% (v/v) fetal calf serum in a rotor cell 12 prototype (Powell Brothers Ltd., Ormskirk, Lancs, UK). Medium was collected every 5 days. After flow dialysis of the culture medium, FGFR1-ST was purified by nickel chelation and Strep-Tactin-Sepharose chromatography. Vivaspin filtration unit (cut-off 30 kDa, Vivascience) was then used to concentrate and exchange the purified FGFR1-ST into PBS (phosphate-buffered saline, 140 mm NaCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4, pH 7.2). Concentration of receptor protein was determined by measurement of the absorbance at 280 nm. Removal of N-glycans of purified protein was performed by N-glycanase digestion in PBS buffer following the manufacturer's recommendations. To ensure equal amounts of protein were used in all experiments, a single aliquot of receptor protein was divided into two, one was treated with N-glycanase and the other mock-treated. Optical Biosensor Binding Assays—FGF-2 was immobilized on aminosilane surfaces using bissulfosuccinimidyl suberate (BS3 as the cross linker following the manufacturer's recommendations (NeoSensors, Sedgefield, UK). No more than 300 arc s FGF-2 was immobilized on the surface (1 arc s = 1/3600°, 600 arc s = 1 ng protein/mm2). Heparin-derived dodecasaccharides were biotinylated at their reducing ends and immobilized on streptavidin surfaces, as described (22Delehedde M. Lyon M. Gallagher J.T. Rudland P.S. Fernig D.G.

A single binding assay consisted of adding the soluble binding partner or ligate in 1-3 μl PBST to a cuvette containing 22-24 μl or 37-39 μl PBST. The association reaction was followed until binding was at least 90% of the calculated equilibrium value, usually between 150 s and 230 s. The cuvette was then washed three times with 50 μl of PBST to initiate the dissociation of bound FGFR1-ST. The FGF-2 and oligosaccharide-derivatized surfaces were regenerated by washing twice with 50 μl of 2 m NaCl in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (10 mm Na2HPO4/NaH2P04, pH 7.2), PBST and 20 mm HCl, which removed 98-100% of bound FGFR1-ST. Binding parameters were calculated using the non-linear curve fitting program FASTFit (NeoSensors). Each binding assay yielded four binding parameters, which are the slope of initial rate of association, the on-rate constant (kon) and the extent of binding, all calculated from the association phase, and the off-rate constant (koff, equivalent to the dissociation rate constant, kd), calculated from the dissociation phase (13Ostrovsky O.

Data Analysis—The determination of binding kinetics in optical biosensors can be prone to artifactual second phase binding sites, due either to rates of diffusion of soluble ligate approaching or exceeding the rate of association, or to steric hindrance at the binding surface (33Fernig D.G. Iozzo R.V. Proteoglycan Protocols. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2001Google Scholar). Binding assays were designed to avoid such artifacts (13Ostrovsky O. Berman B. Gallagher J. Mulloy B. Fernig D.G.

Thus, limiting amounts of ligand were immobilized on the sensor surface, whereas the slope of initial rate, kon and the extent of binding were only determined at low concentrations of ligate, and koff was measured at higher concentrations of ligate, to avoid steric hindrance and rebinding artifacts. A single site model fitted the data at least as well as more complex models, was covered by at least 90% of the data, and, therefore, was used to calculate all binding parameters. The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) was calculated both from the ratio of the kd and ka and from the extent of binding, to provide an estimate of the self-consistency of the results. Quartz Crystal Microbalance-Dissipation (QCM-D)—A self-assembled monolayer was formed on a QCM-D (Q-Sense AB, Västra Frölunda, Sweden) gold crystal by overnight incubation in 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid (0.1 m in ethanol). The surface was then washed with ethanol, water (MilliQ) and then finally with PBS. All subsequent reactions were carried out in PBS. A hydrazide surface was formed by activating the terminal carboxylic acids with a wash of 300 μl of 0.25 m EDC followed by incubation in 300 μl of 0.2 m hydrazine monohydrate and 0.25 m EDC for 1 h. The surface was then washed vigorously with PBS. To immobilize a heparin-derived tetradecasaccharide, the hydrazide surface was incubated overnight in 300 μlof5 μg/ml heparin-derived tetradecasaccharide, a kind gift of Dr A. K. Powell, University of Liverpool. FGF-2 was immobilized on the hydrazide surface by cross-linking with BS3: 3 injections of 300 μl, 0.1 m BS3 over 10 min, followed by two injections of 300 μl, 37 μg/ml FGF-2. After the latter injection, the surface was incubated for 50 min before any unreacted BS3 was blocked with ethanolamine, 0.1 m, 300 μl, for 10 min. In a binding experiment, 300 μl of the deglycosylated or glycosylated FGFR1-ST (48.5 nm) was introduced into the cell and left to incubate for 10 min at 20 °C. The surface was then washed with PBS. The amount of FGFR1-ST bound was determined by comparing the frequency response before and after the addition of the receptor. This frequency change was converted into a mass change by using the Sauerbrey equation (34Sauerbrey G. Zeitschrift Fur Physik. 1959; 155: 206-222Crossref Scopus (9197) Google Scholar), with a conversion co-efficient of 17.7 ng cm-2 Hz-1. The surface was regenerated by washing with 0.5 m NaCl and 0.1 m HCl. Pull-down Experiments—In heparin pull-down experiments, 2 μg of glycosylated and deglycosylated FGFR1-ST in 0.5 ml of PBS was incubated overnight at 4 °C with 5 μl of heparin-agarose (Bio-Rad). Beads were collected by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 3 min and washed twice with PBS by centrifugation. Protein in the supernatant was concentrated by freeze-drying. Supernatants and final pellets were adjusted in volume and proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by silver nitrate staining. Analysis of the N-Glycans on FGFR1-ST—FGFR1-ST protein (50 μg) was reduced for 1 h at 37°C in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.5) containing a 4-fold excess of dithiothreitol and carboxymethylated with a 2-fold molar excess of iodoacetic acid for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. Following dialysis at 4 °C for 72 h against 4 × 4.5 liters of cold 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.5, and lyophilization, FGFR1-ST was digested with trypsin (Thr1246, Sigma) at a 12:1 ratio (w/w) in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8.5) for 18 h at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding a few drops of acetic acid to the solution. The sample was lyophilized prior to its dissolution in 150 μl (5% (v/v)) of acetic acid and purified using a SepPak cartridge C18 (Waters Corp), as described (35Sutton-Smith M. Dell A. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. Academic Press, San Diego2005Google Scholar). The purified glycopeptides were then digested with PNGase-F (Roche Applied Science, 1365177) in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8.5) containing 4.5 units of enzyme at 37 °C over 18 h. The sample was lyophilized, and the released N-glycans were purified using a SepPak cartridge C18 (Waters Corp) (35Sutton-Smith M. Dell A. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. Academic Press, San Diego2005Google Scholar). Permethylation and sample clean-up were performed using the sodium hydroxide protocol, as described previously (35Sutton-Smith M. Dell A. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. Academic Press, San Diego2005Google Scholar). MALDI-TOF data were acquired using a Perseptive Biosystems Voyager DE-STR™ mass spectrometer in the reflector mode with delayed extraction. MS/MS data were acquired using a 4800 MALDI TOF/TOF (Applied Biosystems) mass spectrometer. The collision energy was set to 1 kV, and air was used as collision gas. Samples were dissolved in 10 μl of methanol and mixed at a 1:1 ratio (v/v) with 2,5-dihydrobenzoic acid as matrix. In Silico Glycosylation of the FGF Receptor—In silico glycosylation of the FGF receptor using GlyProt (36Bohne-Lang A. von der Lieth C.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 214-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) employed two different models of the structures of immunoglobin loops D2 and D3 of FGFRs as input: the symmetric “two end” model of the FGFR1-IIIc·FGF-2·heparin hexasaccharide crystal structure (PDB ID: 1FQ9) and the asymmetric model of FGFR2-IIIc·FGF-1·heparin decasaccharide crystal structure (PDB ID: 1E0O). N-glycans were incorporated that correspond to structures identified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. For a given model, the same glycan structure was used for all six potential N-glycosylation sites of the FGFR1-ST. PyMOL viewer software was used to visualized the model three-dimensional structures (DeLano, W. L. (2002) The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System). N-Glycosylation of Recombinant FGFR1 Proteins—Culture medium from CHO cells transfected with FGFR1-ST contained polypeptides immunoreactive to anti-His6 that migrated at an apparent molecular size of 50-70 kDa. When the same cells were cultured in the presence of tunicamycin (3 μg/ml), an inhibitor of N-glycosylation, a single immunoreactive band of 32 kDa was observed (Fig. 2A). Because the calculated molecular mass of FGFR1-ST is 31.5 kDa, this result suggested that the FGFR1-ST secreted by the transfected cells was heavily N-glycosylated. To determine if N-glycosylation was intrinsic to the protein or the consequence of it being secreted rather than membrane-bound, CHO cells were also transfected with FGFR1-GPI. In this case cell-associated immunoreactivity migrated as a series of bands between 45 and 75 kDa. When cultured in the presence of tunicamycin, cells expressed an immunoreactive product that migrated as a single band of 32 kDa, the expected size of FGFR1-GPI (Fig. 2A). FGFR1-ST was purified from CHO cell culture medium by nickel chelation and Strep-Tactin-Sepharose chromatography. After a subsequent separation by SDS-PAGE a series of bands between 50 and 75 kDa were revealed using silver staining. Preincubation of this material with N-glycanase, an enzyme which removes N-glycans, resulted in a single silver-stained band of 32 kDa (Fig. 2B). Thus, the multiple bands observed after separation of the FGFR1-ST reflect the existence of multiple glycoforms of the protein, which is pure as judged by silver staining. In cells treated with tunicamycin, an inhibitor of N-glycosylation, FGFR1-ST, and FGFR1-GPI still traversed the secretory pathway, because immunoreactive deglycosylated FGFR1-ST and FGFR1-GPI were detected in the culture medium and cells, respectively (Fig. 2A). The level of immunoreactive FGFR1-ST secreted into the culture medium is reduced in the presence of tunicamycin. This may reflect, at least in part, the inhibition of cell proliferation by tunicamycin and the fact that equivalent amounts of culture medium rather than cells are compared. When equal amount"

They are suspected to play a role in tooth pain transmission as sensor cells because of their close relationship with nerve, but this role has never been evidenced. We demonstrate here that human odontoblasts in vitro produce voltage-gated tetrodotoxin-sensitive Na+ currents in response to depolarization under voltage clamp conditions and are able to generate action potentials. Odontoblasts express neuronal isoforms of α2 and β2 subunits of sodium channels. Co-cultures of odontoblasts with trigeminal neurons indicate a clustering of α2 and β2 sodium channel subunits and, at the sites of cell-cell contact, a co-localization of odontoblasts β2 subunits with peripherin. In vivo, sodium channels are expressed in odontoblasts. AnkyrinG and β2 co-localize, suggesting a link for signal transduction between axons and odontoblasts. Evidence for excitable properties of odontoblasts and clustering of key molecules at the site of odontoblast-nerve contact strongly suggest that odontoblasts may operate as sensor cells that initiate tooth pain transmission.

The mechanisms underlying dentin sensitivity still remain unclear because of the structural complexity of this tissue including odontoblasts, nerve endings, and the liquid content of surrounding dentinal tubules. Odontoblasts constitute a layer of cells responsible for dentin formation. Each cell has an extension running into the dentinal tubule and bathed in the dentinal fluid. Sensory unmyelinated nerve fibers belonging to the trigeminal ganglion enter the inner dentin and coil around the monopolar processes of odontoblasts (1Byers M.R. Int. Rev. Neurobiol. 1984; 25: 39-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 2Ibuki T. Kido M.A. Kiyoshima T. Terada Y. Tanaka T. J. Dent. Res. 1996; 75: 1963-1970Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). A hydrodynamic concept, based on the spatial situation of odontoblasts, nerve endings, and fluid movements in dentinal tubules, postulated that nociceptive responses may result from an increase in intradentinal pressure, which in turn might activate nerve endings. However, nerve terminals do not reach the most sensitive zone of the dentin (dentino-enamel junction), and intradentinal axons could not be directly excited by stimuli producing pain when applied to the teeth (1Byers M.R. Int. Rev. Neurobiol. 1984; 25: 39-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 3Hildebrand C. Fried K. Tuisku F. Johansson C.S. Progr. Neurobiol. 1995; 45: 165-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Thus emerged the hypothesis that odontoblasts may initiate tooth pain sensation. Several lines of evidence support this assumption. Recently, we have shown that reelin, a large extracellular matrix glycoprotein elaborated by odontoblasts, could promote adhesion between nerves and cells (4Maurin J.C. Couble M.C. Didier-Bazes M. Brisson C. Magloire H. Bleicher F. Matrix Biol. 2004; 23: 277-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This close association suggested that odontoblasts and nerve endings may directly interact, although no synaptic structures or any junction could be detected between them (1Byers M.R. Int. Rev. Neurobiol. 1984; 25: 39-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 2Ibuki T. Kido M.A. Kiyoshima T. Terada Y. Tanaka T. J. Dent.

Along this line, two kinds of mechanosensitive K+ channels (KCa and TREK-1) have been identified in human odontoblasts (5Allard B. Couble M.L. Magloire H. Bleicher F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25556-25561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 6Magloire H. Lesage F. Couble M.L. Lazdunski M. Bleicher F. J. Dent. Res. 2003; 82: 542-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This finding indicated that odontoblasts might be able to convert pain-evoking fluid displacement within dentinal tubules into electrical signals, strengthening their possible role as tooth sensor cells. The view that odontoblasts could detect and transduce painful stimuli into electric signals questioned the possibility that these cells display excitable properties and possess voltage-gated sodium channels. These later have indeed been detected in non-excitable mineralizing cells (7Black J.A. Waxman S.G. Dev. Neurosci. 1996; 18: 139-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) like osteoblasts where sodium channel Nav1.2 mRNA and protein were identified (8Black J.A. Westenbroek R. Catterall W.A. Waxman S.G. Mol. Brain Res. 1995; 34: 89-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In teeth, voltage-gated Na+ channels have been previously evidenced in vitro on dental pulp cell by electrophysiological investigation (9Davidson R.M. Arch. Oral Biol. 1994; 39: 613-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, the identity of the cultured cells under study and the expression of odontoblast key genes were not established, thus casting doubt about the cell type displaying voltage-gated sodium channel activity. To overcome these difficulties, we recently set up a unique cell culture system allowing the differentiation of human dental pulp cells into odontoblasts at the morphological, molecular, and functional levels (5Allard B.

In the present study, we took advantage of this cell model to apply the patch clamp technique and determine whether a voltage-gated Na+ channel is functional in the odontoblast plasma membrane. In parallel, we investigated the molecular isoforms of sodium channel subunits and their spatial distribution in relation with key molecular components at sites of close contact between odontoblasts and nerves in odontoblasts co-cultivated with trigeminal ganglions and in human dental pulp in vivo. Cell Culture—Dental pulps cells were obtained from sound human third molar germs that were extracted for orthodontics reasons. Informed consent was obtained from the patients in accordance with French legal requirements (article 672-1, public health code). Explants were grown in Eagle's basal medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with ascorbic acid, antibiotics, fetal calf serum, and 10 mm sodium β-glycerophosphate as described previously (10Couble M.L. Farges J.C. Bleicher F. Perrat-Mabillon B. Boudeulle M. Magloire H. Calcif. Tissue Int. 2000; 66: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). After 2-3 weeks of culture, the cells differentiated into odontoblasts exhibiting typical features at the morphological (eccentric position of the nucleus, cellular extension, junctional complexes, intracellular organelles) and functional (type I collagen, dentin sialophosphoprotein, enamelysin, osteoadherin) level. Co-culture Assays—Trigeminal ganglion explants from 1-day-old Sprague-Dawley rat pups were co-cultured with human odontoblasts as recently described (4Maurin J.C. Couble M.C. Didier-Bazes M. Brisson C. Magloire H. Bleicher F. Matrix Biol. 2004; 23: 277-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) except that the cultures were performed without embedding in collagen gel. After 3 days, they were routinely prepared for double immunodetection of α2/β2 subunits and peripherin/β2 and analyzed with a scanning laser confocal microscope Zeiss LSM 510 (Carl Zeiss, Le Pecq, France) using ×40/1.3 oil immersion objective. Figures were processed using Adobe PhotoShop 6.0 (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA). RNA Extraction and RT-PCR—Total RNAs were extracted from the cultured cells using the Qiagen RNeasy kit and protocol (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). Purified RNA (3 μg) was reverse-transcribed using random hexamers as primers and converted into cDNA by means of the StrataScript™ RT 3The abbreviations used are: RT, reverse transcription; TTX, tetrodotoxin. kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). PCR amplification was then realized from a 10th of the RT mixture in 50 μl containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 200 μm dNTPs, 2 units of TaqDNA polymerase, and 30 pmol of each sodium channel (SCN) degenerated primers. These primers were designed to hybridize to human SCN1A, SCN2A, and SCN3A genes. The forward primer was 5′-GTTGTGAATGCHCTTDTWGGAG-3′, and the reverse primer was 5′-CTTGAAGCAGAGANAGATANCC-3′. An amplification was also realized with SCN2B primers (forward primer, 5′-CAAATCACCCTCTCCCGTAGCC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-CGTTTCTCAGCATCACCGACAC-3′ corresponding to bp positions 123-144 and 500-521, respectively, of the human sequence (GenBank™ AF049498). The amplification was carried out for 35 cycles (1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 50 °C (SCN1A, -2A, -3A) or 60°C (SCN2B), and 1 min at 72 °C followed by 10 min at 72 °C). Finally, PCR amplification was also realized with primers designed to hybridize to human cardiac SCN5A gene (forward primer, 5′-CATCGGAGAGCCCCTGGAGGAC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GACTCGGAAGGTGCGTAAGGCTGA-3′. corresponding to bp positions 419-441 and 840-864, respectively, of the human sequence NM198056). The amplification was carried out for 30 cycles at 60 °C). Restriction Enzyme Analysis—Four independent PCR amplifications were performed and then desalted and concentrated 5-fold by filtration through a microconcentrator (Amicon Inc., Beverly, MA). An aliquot of 8 μl was incubated in a 10-μl final volume for 2 h at adequate temperature with enzyme as described by manufacturer's instructions. For SCN2B restriction analysis, a single PCR reaction was 5-fold concentrated, and an aliquot of 5 μl was digested in a 10-μl final volume. The digests (5 μl) along with an untreated sample and DNA marker were size-fractionated by electrophoresis in a non-denaturating 6% polyacrylamide gel (mini-gel apparatus, Bio-Rad) using a constant 40 V field. Gel was stained for 30 min in Vistra Green and imaged on a FluorImager (Amersham Biosciences, Orsay, France). In Situ Hybridization—The material consisted of culture samples and sound non-erupted human third molars prepared as described previously in Refs. 10Couble M.L. Farges J.C. Bleicher F.

Matrix Biol. 1999; 18: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar. For detection of the SCN2A and SCN2B transcripts, in situ hybridization was performed using an antisense single-stranded DNA probe (12Bleicher F. Couble M.L. Farges J.C. Couble P. Magloire H. Matrix Biol. 1999; 18: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) with a specific activity of about 2.5 × 106 cpm/pmol. Sense primers were used for the synthesis of the control probes. The images were processed using Adobe PhotoShop 6.0 (Adobe Systems). Finally, pulp tissue from tooth germs was routinely processed (Masson's trichrome staining) for light microscopic observation. Immunochemistry—Cryostat sections of pulps were reacted for double staining with anti-α2/anti-β2 subunits (mouse monoclonal antibodies at 10 μg/ml, Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY; rabbit polyclonal antibodies at 10 μg/ml; Alomone Labs, Jerusalem, Israel); anti-β2 subunits/anti-peripherin (mouse monoclonal Mab 1527, chemicon, Temecula, CA); anti-β2 subunits/anti-ankyrinG (mouse monoclonal antibodies at 10 μg/ml, Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Franscisco, CA), and anti-ankyrinG/anti-β-tubulin (H-235, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Subsequently, the slices were rinsed and then incubated (45 min at room temperature) with Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for α2 subunits, ankyrinG, and peripherin and with Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes) for β2 subunits and β-tubulin. They were then washed, mounted in phosphate-buffered saline-glycerol, and observed under scanning laser confocal microscopy using ×40/1.3 or ×63/1.4 oil immersion objective. Peripherin, α2 subunits, and ankyrinG were assigned a red color; β2 subunits and β-tubulin a green color with the laser scanning software. Co-localization consequently resulted in a yellow color. Negative controls were carried out by omitting the primary antibodies or by incubating with normal mouse or rabbit IgG. Figures were processed using Adobe PhotoShop 6.0 (Adobe Systems). Electrophysiology—Membrane currents and potentials were recorded in the whole cell configuration on cultured odontoblasts using a patch clamp amplifier (model RK 400; Bio-Logic, Claix, France). Data acquisition and generation of command voltage pulses were done using the pClamp9 software (Axon Instruments Inc.) driving an A/D, D/A converter (Digidata 1322A, Axon Instruments Inc.). Cell capacitance, used to calculate the density of currents (A/F), was determined by integration of a control current trace obtained with a 10-mV depolarizing pulse from -90 mV. Leak currents were subtracted from all recordings using a 10-mV depolarizing pulse from the holding potential supposing a linear evolution of leak current with depolarization. Individual curves of the voltage dependence of the Na+ current density were fitted with Equation 1. I(V)=Gmax(V-Vrev)/{1+exp[(V0.5-V)/k]}(Eq. 1) where I(V) is the density of the current measured, V is the test pulse, Gmax is the maximum conductance, Vrev is the apparent reversal potential, V0.5 is the half-activation voltage, and k is a steepness factor. Individual curves of the voltage dependence of the steady-state inactivation of the Na+ current were fitted with the Equation 2. I/Imax=1/{1+exp[(V-V0.5)/k]}(Eq. 2) where Imax is the maximal current, V is the conditioning pulse, V0.5 is the half-maximal inactivation voltage, and k is a steepness factor. All experiments were carried out at room temperature (20-24 °C). Solutions and Chemicals—Pipettes were filled with (in mm): 120 potassium aspartate, 5 KCl, 5 MgCl2, 10 glucose, 3 K2ATP, 5 Na2-CP, 0.4 Na3-GTP, 5 EGTA, 10 Hepes, pH 7.2. The bath solution corresponded to a Tyrode solution containing (in mm): 140 NaCl or 140 choline chloride, 5 KCl, 2.5 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2,10 Hepes, pH 7.2. Tetrodotoxin (TTX) (Sigma) was diluted to the required concentration in the bath solution. Voltages were corrected for liquid junction potentials calculated to be 10 mV with the solutions used. Dye Microinjection in Odontoblasts in Co-culture—For intracellular staining of odontoblasts co-cultivated with trigeminal ganglions, micropipettes filled with an internal solution containing Lucifer yellow CH (100 μm, Sigma) were sealed on odontoblasts, and the patch membrane was ruptured to allow the dye to diffuse into the cell. Cells were imaged using a ×20 objective on an inverted microscope (Olympus IMT2) equipped for epifluorescence. Images were captured every 2 min after dye injection with a Coolsnapfx charge-coupled device camera (Roper Scientific, Evry, France). Injected cells were chosen as a function of their apparent close vicinity with the thin nerve fibers from trigeminal ganglions. Statistics—Non-linear least-squares fits were performed using a Marquadt-Levenberg algorithm routine included in MicroCal Origin. Data values are presented as means ± S.E. Characterization of Voltage-gated Sodium Channels and Voltage Responses in Cultured Odontoblasts—Cultured odontoblasts were depolarized by steps of 50-ms duration from a holding potential of -90 mV. All the odontoblasts tested (n = 13) displayed a voltage-gated inward current that rapidly inactivated (Fig. 1A). The average time to peak of this inward current was 2.9 ± 0.4 ms at 0 mV. Fig. 1B presents the mean current-voltage relationships established for the peak current. The threshold of activation was around -40 mV, and currents peaked at 0 mV and reversed at + 55 ± 3.6 mV. For each cell, the current-voltage relationship was fitted using Equation 1 (see “Experimental Procedures”). Mean values for Gmax, Vrev, V0.5, and k were 336 ± 52 S/F, +55 ± 3.6 mV, -13 ± 1.9 mV, and 4.1 ± 0.4 mV, respectively. The voltage dependence of the inactivation process was then investigated using a steady-state inactivation protocol. A 50-ms test pulse was delivered to 0 mV, a membrane potential at which the current was maximal, and was preceded by a 50-ms depolarizing prepulse of increasing amplitude. Fig. 1C shows that for predepolarizations up to -40 mV, the current that was activated during the test pulse remained unaltered. For higher depolarizations, the inward current during the test depolarization progressively decreased and then completely vanished for a predepolarization to 0 mV. For each cell, the inactivation curve was fitted using Equation 2 (see “Experimental Procedures”). The corresponding mean inactivation curve indicated mean values for V0.5 and k of -26 ± 1.5 and 8.6 ± 0.6 mV, respectively. Voltage dependence, kinetic properties, and reversal potential of the inward current strongly suggested that this current corresponds to a voltagegated Na+ current. Indeed, in all odontoblasts tested, we found that TTX completely and reversibly abolished the inward current elicited by a depolarizing pulse to 0 mV (Fig. 2A). Adding increasing concentrations of TTX from 10 to 1000 nm in a cumulative manner indicated a half-maximal inhibition of the current with 45 nm. Additionally, in two cells, the substitution of choline for Na+ led to an almost complete and a reversible abolition of the inward current (Fig. 2C). Taken together, these data demonstrate that odontoblasts express a functional voltage-gated TTX-sensitive Na+ channel.FIGURE 2Effect of TTX and removal of Na+ on inward currents and voltage responses in odontoblasts. In A-C, currents were obtained in response to a voltage pulse to 0 mV from a holding potential of -90 mV. In B, left panel, increasing concentrations of TTX were added in the external. Each trace corresponds to five superimposed current traces obtained at a given TTX concentration indicated next to each current trace. The right panel shows the corresponding relationship between the relative current amplitude and the TTX concentration fitted by a Hill equation (relative current = 1/(1+(x/k)n) with k = 45 nm and n = 1.1). In D, under current clamp conditions, the internal potential was held around -80 mV by passing a constant negative current. In the left panel, voltage responses were obtained in response to injection of depolarizing currents of 0.5-ms duration in 1-pA increments from a starting value of +15 pA. The right panel shows two consecutive spikes evoked by injection of two current pulses of 0.5-ms duration given to +20 pA and separated by a 60-ms interval. In E, spikes were evoked by injection of current pulses of 0.5-ms duration given to +20 pA (left panel) and +12 pA (right panel). The stars indicate the voltage responses evoked after the addition of 2 μm TTX (left panel) and after substitution of 140 mm choline for 140 mm Na+ (right panel) in the external solution. The middle panel illustrates the voltage responses of the left panel on an expanded scale.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Given the high density of the voltage-gated Na+ inward current together with the low density of outward current that developed in response to depolarization, we speculated that odontoblasts might be able to produce regenerative voltage responses. We then investigated the electrical excitability of odontoblasts by performing current clamp experiments. Depolarizing currents of increasing amplitude and 0.5-ms duration were injected into the cells from a membrane potential held around -80 mV by applying constant negative current. In all three cells tested with this protocol, infraliminar stimulations induced electrotonic response, whereas a spike bringing the membrane potential around +45 mV developed in response to current injection higher than 18 pA (Fig. 2D, left panel). Fig. 2C, right panel, shows that train of action potentials could even be elicited in response to supraliminar repetitive stimulation of the cells at a frequency up to 18 Hz without any decrease in spike amplitude. Finally, as expected, spikes were totally inhibited by the addition of TTX in the bath or substitution of choline for Na+ in the external solution, confirming that the spike resulted from the activation of the voltage-gated TTX-sensitive Na+ current (Fig. 2E). Brain Sodium Channel Subunits in Cultured Odontoblasts— The presence of functional voltage-gated Na+ channel in cultured odontoblasts prompted us to look for what kind of sodium channel subunits transcripts are expressed by odontoblasts. Degenerate homology-PCR was used to co-amplify SCN1A, SCN2A, and SCN3A genes. For this purpose, these sequences (SCN1A: S71446, SCN2A: M94055, SCN3A: AF035685, in GenBank™) were aligned using the MultAlin program (13Corpret F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 10881-10890Crossref PubMed Scopus (4347) Google Scholar). Two degenerate primers were designed to amplify a 277-bp fragment for SCN1A and SCN2A and a 268-bp fragment for SCN3A. RT-PCR realized on cultured odontoblast RNA amplified a single PCR product of about 277 bp. The gel did not allow us to discriminate between the 277 and 268 bp fragments. This product was submitted to four sets of digestion by restriction enzymes having specificity for each subtype. Fig. 3 shows that SCN1A, SCN2A, and SCN3A were expressed. For SCN2A and SCN3A, restriction produced two fragments of the expected size (Table 1). Digestion of the PCR product by TaqI gave rise to a fragment of 155 bp. The two other expected fragments (64 and 58 bp) were not detectable. A band of 399 bp was amplified from these RNA using the SCN2B primers. Restriction of the product gave rise to two fragments of 255 and 144 bp. In contrast, SCN5A coding for Nav1.5 (found in cardiac tissue) was not expressed in odontoblasts (data not shown). All these data confirm that the PCR products accurately represent the co-expression of the β2 subunit and the three isoforms SCN1A, SCN2A, and SCN3A (corresponding to Nav1.1, Nav1.2, and Nav1.3 α subunits, respectively, in another nomenclature) found in the central nervous system.TABLE 1Expected restriction endonuclease fragment sizes The 277-bp product expected for Na+ channels Nav1.1, 1.2, 1.3, or 1.7, was analyzed by cleavage with TaqI ((T/C)GA), AsnI (A(T/T)AAT), BspLU11 ((A/C)ATGT). The 399 bp product for β2 subunit was analyzed by cleavage with MaeIII (/GTNAC). The sizes of the expected fragments for each subunit (–) indicate that the restriction enzyme would not be expected to cut the product from the indicated subunit.Sodium channel subunitsSizeTaqIAsnIBspLU11MaeIIIbpSCN1A155–––64–58SCN2A–152–125––SCN3A––143–125–SCN2B–––255–144 Open table in a new tab In Situ Hybridization of SCN2A and SCN2B Transcripts— SCN2A and SCN2B transcripts were detected in cultured odontoblasts (Fig. 4, a and b). Experiments conducted in vivo on human dental pulp tissue clearly demonstrated that the highest density of transcripts was detected in odontoblasts as opposed to pulp cells (Fig. 4, c and d). Hybridization with sense SCN2A (data not shown) and SCN2B probes showed negligible signal in odontoblasts (Fig. 4f). On Fig. 4e, the location and spatial organization of odontoblast layer is clearly evidenced at the periphery of the pulp tissue. Co-culture Assays—Odontoblasts are known to be closely associated with nerves. To mimic the in vivo situation and to explore how Na+ channel subunits localize when nerves make contacts with odontoblasts, odontoblasts were co-cultivated with rat trigeminal ganglions. Analysis by confocal microscopy clearly showed a co-localization (yellow patches) of α2 and β2 subunits in the odontoblast cell membrane, whereas α2 subunits were often densely expressed at the apical pole of the cells (Fig. 5, a-c). When a single neurite ran close to the odontoblast cell membrane, α2 and β2 subunits clustered in the contact area (Fig. 5, d-f). Staining with antibodies raised against peripherin, a component of trigeminal axons (14Brody B.A. Ley C.A. Parysek L.M. J. Neurosci. 1989; 9: 2391-2401Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), clearly identified the nerves from the trigeminal ganglion, and the double labeling with β2 subunits showed a dot-like co-localization where a close contact was evidenced between odontoblasts and neurites (Fig. 5, g-i). To explore the possibility that electric signals may propagate from odontoblasts to nerve cells via gap junctions, we injected Lucifer yellow into odontoblasts, a reported freely diffusible dye tracer through gap junctions (15Ushiyama J. Cell Tissue Res. 1989; 258: 611-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Microinjection was preferentially performed in odontoblasts making apparent close contact with nerves. Fig. 5j shows an intense fluorescence in a microinjected cell that spread after 30 min to adjacent odontoblast (Fig. 5k). However, in the 10 cells tested, the dye failed to migrate to axons located in the close vicinity of the injected cell. Immunohistochemistry in Odontoblasts in Vivo—Double staining of α2 and β2 subunits in odontoblasts demonstrated a strong fluorescence for the two subunits at the apical pole of the cells (Fig. 6, a and b). In addition, α2 subunits labeling clearly underlined the membranes of the basal pole of the odontoblasts (Fig. 6b). Confocal analysis showed co-localizations of α2 and β2 subunits on the cell membrane and at the apical pole corresponding to the terminal web connecting odontoblasts in this region (Fig. 6c). In mature odontoblasts, β2 subunits decorated as dots profiled the cell membrane and labeled thin axons (Fig. 6d). Peripherin immunoreactivity revealed nerves running to the odontoblast layer (Fig. 6e). Confocal microscopy clearly showed co-localizations of peripherin positive nerves with β2 at the apical pole of the cells without co-localization of β2 and peripherin in the nerve fibers (Fig. 6f). β2 subunits were also shown to co-localize with ankyrinG (an intracellular anchoring protein directly linked to β2 subunit intracellular domains) (Fig. 6g) at the apical pole of the odontoblast layer and along the cell bodies only as cell processes did not show any ankyrin immunoreactivity (Fig. 6, h and i). Finally, β-tubulin, a major brain component of microtubules suspected to bind ankyrinG (16Kobayashi N. Mundel P. Cell Tissue Res. 1998; 291: 163-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), was mainly associated with the odontoblast cell membrane (Fig. 6j) and co-localized with ankyrinG particularly at the base of the cell processes (Fig. 6, k and l). On in vitro and in vivo control experiments, negligible staining could be detected (data not shown). Intracellular staining was observed in some experiments (Fig. 6g); it might correspond to β2 subunits in the progress of synthesis related to the secretory stage of odontoblasts. In this study, we present evidence that voltage-gated TTX-sensitive sodium channels are functional in cultured odontoblasts originating from human dental pulp. In response to depolarization, odontoblasts exhibited a fast sodium current that inactivated rapidly. This sodium current displayed biophysical characteristics comparable with those classically reported for the voltage-gated sodium current in axons (17Armstrong C.M. Bezanilla F. Rojas E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1973; 62: 375-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 18Oxford G.S. Wu C.H. Narahashi T. J. Gen. Physiol. 1978; 71: 227-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Although less sensitive to TTX than voltage-gated Na+ channels present in nervous cells, Na+ currents in odontoblasts were found to be as sensitive as cloned brain channels expressed in host systems (19Noda M. Suzuki H. Numa S. Stuhmer W.A. FEBS Lett. 1989; 259: 213-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). In agreement with our electrophysiological data, PCR experiments and in situ hybridization performed in cultured odontoblasts demonstrated expression of the transcripts of four genes (SCN1A, SCN2A, SCN3A, and SCN2B) encoding, respectively, the pore-forming α subunit isoforms Nav1.1, Nav1.2, and Nav1.3 and β2 subunits of voltage-gated Na+ channels broadly expressed in neurons of the centra"
https://openalex.org/W2029663467,"Our previous studies have revealed that the signaling protein BCL10 plays a major role in adaptive immunity by mediating NF-κB activation in the LPS/TLR4 pathway. In this study, we show that IRAK-1 acts as the essential upstream adaptor that recruits BCL10 to the TLR4 signaling complex and mediates signaling to NF-κB through the BCL10-MALT1-TRAF6-TAK1 cascade. Following dissociation from IRAK-1, BCL10 is translocated into the cytosol along with TRAF6 and TAK1, in a process bridged by a direct BCL10-Pellino2 interaction. RNA interference against MALT1 markedly reduced the level of NF-κB activation stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in macrophages, which suggests that MALT1 plays a major role in the LPS/TLR4 pathway. MALT1 interacted with BCL10 and TRAF6 to facilitate TRAF6 self-ubiquitination in the cytosol, which was strictly dependent on the dissociation of BCL10 from IRAK-1. We show that BCL10 oligomerization is a prerequisite for BCL10 function in LPS signaling to NF-κB and that IRAK-1 dimerization is an important event in this process.

In vitro experiments using purified MALT1, TRAF6, TGF-β-activated kinase (TAK1), and ubiquitination enzymes, which include Ubc13/Uev1A, allowed reconstitution of the pathway from BCL10 to IKK activation. As reported previously, BCL10 and MALT1 form oligomers that bind to TRAF6, induce TRAF6 oligomerization, and activate the ligase activity of TRAF6 to promote self-ubiquitination and polyubiquitination of NEMO. This cascade model is predicted to be responsible for TCR signaling and NF-κB activation in T lymphocytes (8Sun L. Deng L. Ea C.K. Xia Z.P. Chen Z.J. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 289-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar).Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play essential roles in innate immune recognition in mammalian species. Upon engagement of their respective ligands, TLRs stimulate the transcription of effector genes through activation of common transcription factors, which include nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), activating protein 1, and activating transcription factor. Of these transcription factors, NF-κB plays a central role in many biological processes of both the innate and adaptive immunity systems. Stimuli that activate NF-κB include mitogens for antigen receptors, proinflammatory cytokines, and the bacterial product lipopolysaccharide (LPS). LPS elicits a multitude of effects on the immune system and is a ligand recognized by TLR4 (9Barton G.M. Medzhitov R. Science. 2003; 300: 1524-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar, 10Akira S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38105-38108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). LPS ligation to TLR4 results in signaling activation via downstream signaling factors, which include the adaptor MyD88, IL-1RI-associated protein kinases (IRAKs), TRAF6, and TAK1. Upon LPS stimulation, IRAK-1, a serine-threonine kinase, is phosphorylated within receptor complexes that include Tollip, MyD88, and TRAF6. Phosphorylation of IRAK-1 presumably triggers IRAK-1 to dissociate from the receptor complexes and translocate along with TRAF6 to the membrane-bound preassociated TAK1-TAB1-TAB2 complex. IRAK-1 is required for IL-1-induced phosphorylation of TAK1, TAB1, and TAB2 in the membrane-bound complexes (11Qian Y. Commane M. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Matsumoto K. Li X. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41661-41667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 12Jiang Z. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Qian Y. Matsumoto K. Li X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7158-7167Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated IRAK-1 is eventually ubiquitinated and degraded. TAK1-TAB1-TAB2-TRAF6 then dissociates from phosphorylated IRAK-1 and translocates to the cytosol, in which phosphorylated TAK1 is activated (12Jiang Z. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Qian Y. Matsumoto K. Li X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7158-7167Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), in a process that is at least partially dependent on TRAF6 oligomerization and self-ubiquitination (8Sun L. Deng L. Ea C.K. Xia Z.P. Chen Z.J. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 289-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar, 13Wang C. Deng L. Hong M. Akkaraju G.R. Inoue J.I. Chen Z.J. Nature. 2001; 412: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1612) Google Scholar).Similar to most TRAF proteins, TRAF6 is composed of a highly conserved C-terminal TRAF domain and a more variable N-terminal domain that contains a RING finger and several zinc fingers (14Cao Z. Xiong J. Takeuchi M. Kurama T. Goeddel D.V. Nature. 1996; 383: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar, 15Ye H. Arron J.R. Lamothek B. Cirilli M. Kobayashi T. Shevdeq N.K. Segal D.

C-terminal TRAF domains mediate homotypic and heterotypic TRAF oligomerization, as well as receptor docking. TRAF6 has been shown to act as a RING finger-dependent ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase ubiquitin ligase and to ubiquitinate itself through Lys-63-Ub conjugation in conjunction with Ubc13 and Uev1A. The NF-κB-inducing activity of TRAF6 depends on its ubiquitin ligase and self-ubiquitination activities. Self-ubiquitinated TRAF6 polyubiquitinates NEMO and activates TAK1, which in turn phosphorylates IKK-β and leads to IKK activation. In these processes, homotypic TRAF6 oligomerization is a prerequisite for TRAF6 ubiquitin ligase activation and self-ubiquitination (8Sun L. Deng L. Ea C.K. Xia Z.P. Chen Z.J. Mol.

In a mouse macrophage cell line treated with LPS, BCL10 was recruited to the TLR4 signaling complexes. RNAi against BCL10 rendered these mouse macrophages unable to activate NF-κB fully in response to LPS stimulation. Pellino2, which is a signaling protein that is involved in innate immunity, has been identified as a direct BCL10-binding adaptor downstream of BCL10 (16Liu Y. Dong W. Chen L. Xiang R. Xiao H. De G. Wang Z. Qi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37436-37444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). On the other hand, a recent study using BCL10 knock-out mice found that LPS signaling to NF-κB in MZ and follicular B cells was severely reduced. These BCL10-deficent mice were very susceptible to challenge with the bacterial pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae, in that they failed to clear the bacteria from the bloodstream and did not survive the infection (17Xue L. Morris S.W. Orihuela C. Tuomanen E. Cui X. Wen R. Wang D. Nat. Immun. 2003; 4: 857-865Crossref Scopus (157) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that BCL10 is also an important component in LPS signaling to NF-κB and in innate resistance to bacterial infections (18Fischer K.D. Tedford K. Wirth T.

Recombinant IRAK-1, IRAK-1b and IRAK-1 (T66E) were expressed in the Sf-9 cells using the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system (Invitrogen).Cell Culturing, Stable Transfection, and Treatment—The murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 (American Type Culture Collection) was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) that was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma). Approximately 6 × 105 cells/well were seeded into 6-well plates and transfected 24 h later with 10 μg of each vector using Lipofectin 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The transformants were cultured in the presence of 0.8 mg/ml G418 (Sigma) until the clones appeared. Every isolated clone was picked and seeded in 96-well plates individually. All the RAW lines stably transfected are clonal. In all experiments, the cells were stimulated with 100 ng/ml LPS or 20 ng/ml recombinant human TNF-α (final concentrations).NF-κB Assay—Cells were transfected with 900 ng of the pNF-κB luciferase reporter (Stratagene) and 100 ng of the pRL-TK Renilla reporter (Promega) in combination with the indicated expression plasmids. Cells were harvested after the indicated periods of time, and the firefly luciferase levels were determined using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega).

Ligation was carried out by mixing 10 μl of pSUPER vector and 1 μl of annealed insert in a ligation reaction, which was incubated at 16 °C for 8 h. The ligation reaction was then incubated at 70 °C for 10 min and subjected to BglII digestion in a 100-μl volume for 3–4 h at 37 °C. The bacteria were transformed with insert-ligated pSU-PER vectors. Plasmid DNA isolated from the bacteria was digested with EcoRI and HindIII. Positive clones were about 350 bp in size.All the RAW lines are clonal, including RAWdeI, RAWdeMa, and RAWdeMb. Briefly, 10 μg of the pSUPER vector or recombinant pSUPER vectors with ligated inserts were stably transfected into ∼6 × 105 RAW 264.7 cells. The transformants were cultured in the presence of 0.8 mg/ml G418 (Sigma) until the clones appeared. Every isolated clone was picked and seeded in a 96-well plate individually.Immunoblotting and Immunoprecipitation—Cells were lysed with MPER protein extraction reagent (Pierce), and equal amounts of the samples were loaded for SDS-PAGE. Immunoblotting was carried out on nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences), and the samples were detected using an ECL reagent (Pierce). Immunoprecipitation was carried out using an MPER immunoprecipitation kit (Pierce).T7Select Biopanning—The pre-made T7Select lung cDNA library (catalog number 70646-3, Novagen) and the liver tumor cDNA library (catalog number 70647-3, Novagen) were screened with the T7Select biopanning kit (Novagen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The bait was bacterially expressed human BCL10 (pET28 vector; Novagen), which was purified by affinity chromatography. After 4 rounds of selection, 10 randomly selected clones were picked from each library, sequenced, and searched for homology to known sequences using the BLAST program.Glycerol Gradient Ultracentrifugation—Purified wild-type IRAK-1 and IRAK-1 mutants (5 μg) expressed from the Bac-to-Bac system were incubated with 5 μg of BCL10, and the mixtures were applied to a 10–50% glycerol gradient in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 150 mm NaCl. After centrifugation at 250,000 × g for 3 h in a TLS-55 rotor (Beckman Coulter) at 4 °C, the 200-μl fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting with antibody against GST or BCL10.In Vitro Transcription-Translation—Coupled in vitro transcription-translation reactions with IRAK-1 and mutants thereof were performed with TnT-T7 system (Promega).GST Resin Pulldown Assay—Twenty microliters of glutathione-Sepharose beads coated with GST fusion proteins were mixed with equal amounts of in vitro translated IRAK-1 or bacterially expressed BCL10 and rocked at 4 °C for 1 h in modified GBT buffer (10% glycerol, 50 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5), 175 mm KCl, 7.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100) that contained 1% bovine serum albumin. The beads were collected by low speed centrifugation and washed extensively in modified GBT buffer. Bound proteins were eluted in sample buffer and analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE and Western blotting.RESULTSIRAK-1 Interacts with BCL10 in Response to LPS Stimulation—In a previous study, we observed that BCL10 is recruited into TLR4 signaling complexes in response to LPS stimulation, which raised the question as to how BCL10 is recruited to the receptor. To identify the molecule(s) that act as the adaptor for BCL10 recruitment to the TLR4 signaling complexes, we screened for BCL10-associated proteins using the T7Select phage display system (Novagen). A peptide identical to the coding sequence of human interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-1 (residues 502–642) was found to interact with BCL10 (Fig. 1). This interesting finding encouraged us to examine the potential in vivo association between BCL10 and IRAK-1. Extracts of RAW 264.7 cells treated with or without LPS were immunoprecipitated with anti-IRAK-1 antibody, followed by Western blot analyses with the anti-BCL10 antibody. BCL10 interacted with IRAK-1 only in the presence of LPS stimulation. These results clearly indicate that BCL10 interacts with IRAK-1 in an LPS signal-dependent manner in vivo, and suggest that IRAK-1 links BCL10 to TLR4 complexes following LPS stimulation (Fig. 2).FIGURE 2LPS stimulation-dependent interaction of IRAK-1 and BCL10 in RAW 264.7 cells.

https://openalex.org/W1981548483,"The Saccharomyces cerevisiae RDH54-encoded product, a member of the Swi2/Snf2 protein family, is needed for mitotic and meiotic interhomologue recombination and DNA repair. Previous biochemical studies employing Rdh54 purified from yeast cells have shown DNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis and DNA supercoiling by this protein, indicative of a DNA translocase function. Importantly, Rdh54 physically interacts with the Rad51 recombinase and promotes D-loop formation by the latter. Unfortunately, the low yield of Rdh54 from the yeast expression system has greatly hampered the progress on defining the functional interactions of this Swi2/Snf2-like factor with Rad51. Here we describe an E. coli expression system and purification scheme that together provide milligram quantities of nearly homogeneous Rdh54. Using this material, we demonstrate that Rdh54-mediated DNA supercoiling leads to transient DNA strand opening. Furthermore, at the expense of ATP hydrolysis, Rdh54 removes Rad51 from DNA. We furnish evidence that the Rad51 binding domain resides within the N terminus of Rdh54. Accordingly, N-terminal truncation mutants of Rdh54 that fail to bind Rad51 are also impaired for functional interactions with the latter. Interestingly, the rdh54 K352R mutation that ablates ATPase activity engenders a DNA repair defect even more severe than that seen in the rdh54Δ mutant. These results provide molecular information concerning the role of Rdh54 in homologous recombination and DNA repair, and they also demonstrate the functional significance of Rdh54·Rad51 complex formation. The Rdh54 expression and purification procedures described here should facilitate the functional dissection of this DNA recombination/repair factor.

Here we describe an E. coli expression system and purification scheme that together provide milligram quantities of nearly homogeneous Rdh54. Using this material, we demonstrate that Rdh54-mediated DNA supercoiling leads to transient DNA strand opening. Furthermore, at the expense of ATP hydrolysis, Rdh54 removes Rad51 from DNA. We furnish evidence that the Rad51 binding domain resides within the N terminus of Rdh54. Accordingly, N-terminal truncation mutants of Rdh54 that fail to bind Rad51 are also impaired for functional interactions with the latter. Interestingly, the rdh54 K352R mutation that ablates ATPase activity engenders a DNA repair defect even more severe than that seen in the rdh54Δ mutant. These results provide molecular information concerning the role of Rdh54 in homologous recombination and DNA repair, and they also demonstrate the functional significance of Rdh54·Rad51 complex formation. The Rdh54 expression and purification procedures described here should facilitate the functional dissection of this DNA recombination/repair factor. Homologous recombination (HR) 3The abbreviations used are: HR, homologous recombination; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid; ds, double-stranded.3The abbreviations used are: HR, homologous recombination; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid; ds, double-stranded. helps eliminate deleterious lesions, including DNA strand breaks and interstrand cross-links, from chromosomes. Furthermore, by linking homologous chromosomes through crossover formation, HR helps ensure the proper segregation of the chromosomes in the first meiotic division. Interestingly, HR can also provide a means of elongating shortened telomeres in the absence of telomerase. Because of its involvement in various aspects of chromosome maintenance, mutants of HR typically accumulate chromosome aberrations and exhibit a mutator phenotype. In fact, in higher eukaryotes, deletion of HR genes often engenders cell inviability, believed to reflect the requirement of HR for cells to successfully complete DNA replication during the S phase (1Krogh B.O. Symington L.S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2004; 38: 233-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). That HR is critical for genome stability is underscored by the realization that the cancer-prone diseases Fanconi anemia and Bloom's syndrome exhibit either HR deficiency or HR deregulation, respectively (2Howlett N.G.

The linkage of HR impairment or deregulation to the cancer phenotype emphasizes the importance of delineating the mechanistic underpinnings of the HR machinery.The genetic requirement of HR was initially defined in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Studies in this model eukaryote have identified the RAD52 epistasis group of genes as being needed for mitotic and meiotic recombination and DSB repair by HR (8Symington L.S. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 630-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar). The structure and function of the RAD52 group genes are remarkably conserved among eukaryotes, from yeast to humans (1Krogh B.O. Symington L.S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2004; 38: 233-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar).Two RAD52 group genes, RAD54 and RDH54, encode proteins that belong to the Swi2/Snf2 protein family. As deduced from genetic studies conducted by several research groups, RAD54 serves a more prominent role than RDH54 in mitotic DSB repair, intrachromosomal recombination, and sister chromatid-based recombination, whereas RDH54 is more relevant than RAD54 in interhomologue recombination in both mitotic and meiotic cells (1Krogh B.O. Symington L.S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2004; 38: 233-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar, 9Klein H.L. Genetics. 1997; 147: 1533-1543Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Shinohara M.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2648-2658Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Consistent with their Swi2/Snf2 likeness, both Rad54 and Rdh54 proteins possess a DNA-dependent ATPase activity (12Petukhova G. Stratton S. Sung P. Nature. 1998; 393: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 13Petukhova G. Sung P. Klein H. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2206-2215Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Employing biochemical means and scanning force microscopy, evidence has been presented that Rad54 and Rdh54 use the free energy from ATP hydrolysis to translocate on dsDNA, generating unconstrained negative and positive supercoils in the DNA (13Petukhova G. Sung P. Klein H. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2206-2215Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 14Van Komen S. Petukhova G. Sigurdsson S. Stratton S. Sung P. Mol.

Importantly, the DNA translocase and supercoiling functions appear to be a generally conserved property of Swi2/Snf2 protein family members (16Havas K. Flaus A. Phelan M. Kingston R. Wade P.A.

Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2206-2215Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) have shown an interaction of Rad54 and Rdh54 with the Rad51 protein, which is structurally related to the Escherichia coli RecA protein (21Shinohara M. Gasior S.L. Bishop D.K. Shinohara A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10814-10819Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Like RecA, Rad51 possesses an ATP-dependent recombinase activity that can pair and exchange DNA strands between homologous DNA molecules (22Sung P. Science. 1994; 265: 1241-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Rdh54 was found to interact with Dmc1, the meiosis-specific RecA/Rad51-like recombinase enzyme (23Bishop D.K. Park D. Xu L. Kleckner N. Cell. 1992; 69: 439-456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar, 24Sehorn M.G. Sigurdsson S. Bussen W. Unger V.M. Sung P.

Ewing D.J. Conrad M.N. Dominguez A.M. Barstead R. Jiang H. Kodadek T. Genetics. 1997; 147: 533-544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The meiotic prominence of Rdh54 (1Krogh B.O. Symington L.S. Annu.

Shinagawa H. Ogawa H. Shinohara A. Genetics. 1997; 147: 1545-1556Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) could very well be because of its physical and functional interactions with not only Rad51 but with Dmc1 as well.To understand the molecular function and mechanistic role of the RDH54 gene in HR and DSB repair reactions, it is necessary to purify its encoded protein and characterize the protein on its own and in conjunction with the Rad51 and Dmc1 recombinases. To facilitate the detailed dissection of Rdh54 biochemical properties and its functional interactions with Rad51, we have devised an E. coli protein expression system and a purification protocol that together provide milligram quantities of highly purified Rdh54 and mutant variants of this HR factor. Here we report our biochemical studies that show DNA strand opening by Rdh54 with a dependence on ATP hydrolysis. By expressing, purifying, and characterizing several N-terminally truncated forms of Rdh54, we have been able to ascertain the functional significance of the Rdh54·Rad51 complex. Furthermore, we show that at the expense of ATP hydrolysis, Rdh54 efficiently removes Rad51 from duplex DNA. The ability of Rdh54 to remove Rad51 from DNA is less dependent on the N-terminal Rad51 binding domain than is its D-loop promoting activity. Interestingly, the rdh54 K352R mutation that ablates ATPase activity engenders a DNA repair defect even more severe than that seen in the rdh54Δ mutant. The biochemical and genetic studies described herein contribute help clarify the role that Rdh54 fulfills in HR, and the protein expression/purification and biochemical systems devised here should facilitate the ongoing functional dissection of Rdh54.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids—DNA fragments encoding full-length and N-terminally truncated variants of Rdh54 were prepared by the PCR reaction and cloned into the NcoI and XhoI site of the pET32a vector (Novagen) to add thioredoxin and His6 tags to the N terminus of these proteins. The DNA template for the PCR reaction is pRdh54.1 (13Petukhova G. Sung P. Klein H. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2206-2215Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The forward PCR primers are: 5′-CTATAGGGAGAGCCACCATGGCGGTAATAAGCGTTAAACCTCG-3′ for both full-length Rdh54 and the Rdh54 1-133 polypeptide; 5′-CTATAGGGAGAGCCACCATGGCACAGATACCGAAATATGAG-3′ for the rdh54 Δ34 mutant; 5′-CTATAGGGAGAGCCACCATGGAAAACACTAGATATTTTACTATC-3′ for the Δ102 mutant; 5′-CTATAGGGAGAGCCACCATGGCCAGTAGCGATAAGTTATGC-3′ for the Δ133 mutant. The reverse primers are: 5′-GATCCGCTCGAGTTATCATTGTTCTCTGAGAC-3′ for full-length Rdh54 and the Δ34, Δ102, and Δ133 variants; 5′-GATCCGCTCGAGTTATCATTTTAAGGTAGCGTAGC-3′ for the Rdh54-(1-133) polypeptide. For generating the rdh54 K352R expression plasmid, the Rdh54 expression plasmid was subject to in vitro mutagenesis using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) to alter lysine 352 to arginine (K352R). The primers used for the mutagenesis procedure are: 5′-CCTTTTGGCTGATGATATGGGTTTAGGTCGGACACTAATGAGTATAACTTTGATTTGGACATTAATTAG-3′ and 5′-CTAATTAATGTCCAAATCAAAGTTATACTCATTAGTGTCCGACCTAAACCCATATCATCAGCCAAAAGG-3′. All the protein expression constructs were sequenced to verify that no unwanted mutation had been introduced during the subcloning steps.Yeast Strains—All the yeast strains used in the genetic experiments were derived from W303 and have the genotype leu2-3, 112 his3-11,15 ade2-1 ura3-1 trp1-1 can1-100 RAD5.Homologous Recombination Assays—Recombination rates were determined according to the median method of Lea and Coulson (26Lea D.E. Coulson A. J. Genet. 1948; 49: 264-284Crossref Scopus (1076) Google Scholar) as described previously (27Aguilera A. Klein H.L. Genetics. 1988; 119: 779-790Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fresh zygotes of each indicated genotype were streaked onto solid YPD medium and nine colonies were used for each fluctuation test for rate determinations. Three zygotes were used for each diploid genotype.DNA Substrates—All the oligonucleotides were obtained from Oligos Etc., Inc. To prepare the DNA substrate for the DNA mobility shift assay, the 80-mer oligonucleotide 1, 5′-TTATATCCTTTACTTTGAATTCTATGTTTAACCTTTTACTTATTTTGTATTAGCCGGATCCTTATTTCAATTATGTTCAT-3′ was 5′ end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega) and [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences). Following the removal of the free nucleotide with a spin 30 column (Bio-Rad), the radiolabeled oligonucleotide was annealed to its exact complement by heating the reaction mixture at 85 °C for 3 min and slow cooling to 23 °C. The resulting duplex was purified from a 10% polyacrylamide gel by overnight diffusion at 4 °C into TE (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA). For the D-loop assay, the 90-mer oligonucleotide D1 (14Van Komen S. Petukhova G. Sigurdsson S. Stratton S. Sung P. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 563-572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), being complementary to pBluescript SK DNA from positions 1932 to 2022, was 5′ end-labeled and then purified using the MERmaid Spin Kit (Bio101). For the DNA topology modification and DNA strand opening reactions, ϕX174 replicative form I DNA (Invitrogen) was relaxed by treatment with calf thymus topoisomerase I (Invitrogen), as described previously (28Petukhova G. Van Komen S. Vergano S. Klein H. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29453-29462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar).The 600-bp biotinylated dsDNA used in the experiments in Figs. 5 and 11 was prepared by PCR amplification of pBluescript SK DNA using the 5′-biotinylated primer 1 (5′-AAATCAATCTAAAGTATATATGAG-3′) and non-biotinylated primer 2 (5′-TGAGTACTCACCAGTCACAG-3′). The amplified DNA was deproteinized by phenol-chloroform extraction, ethanol-precipitated, and dissolved in TE. To immobilize the biotinylated dsDNA on streptavidin magnetic beads (Roche Applied Science), 30 μg of the DNA was mixed with 400 μl of beads in 800 μl of buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA) for 4 h at 25 °C. The beads were washed twice with 800 μl of buffer A containing 1 m NaCl and stored in 400 μl of buffer A at 4 °C. The beads contained 50 ng of the biotinylated DNA per μl of suspended volume. The linear pBluescript SK dsDNA, used as the Rad51 trap in Figs. 5 and 11, was prepared by digestion of replicative form I DNA with the restriction enzyme EcoRV.FIGURE 1Recombination rates in the wild-type strain and rdh54 mutants. Rates of recombination between the leu2-RI and leu2-BSTEII alleles, which are ablations of the EcoRI and BstEII sites within the LEU2 gene, were determined. Strains used were HKY666-1A and HKY679-2C for RDH54 (WT), HKY666-3A and HKY679-7D for rdh54Δ, and HKY866-1D, and HKY865-4B for rdh54K352R.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 11Role of the Rdh54 N-terminal Rad51 binding domain in Rad51 removal from DNA. A, to examine Rad51 removal from DNA, Rad51-nucleoprotein filaments assembled on magnetic bead-bound dsDNA were incubated with the rdh54 Δ34, Δ102, and Δ133 truncation mutants (120 or 240 nm) and the dsDNA trap. Analysis was by either SDS-PAGE (I) or agarose gel electrophoresis (II). The control reaction in lane 1 contained Rad51 only. See Fig. 5 legend for experimental details. Symbols: CK, creatine kinase in the ATP-regenerating system used; dsDNA, the non-biotinylated dsDNA used as Rad51 trap.

The culture was shifted to 16 °C and induced with 0.1 mm IPTG(isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside) for 16 h. Cells from 60 liters of culture were harvested by centrifugation and stored at -80 °C. All the subsequent steps were carried out at 4 °C. For protein purification, cells (150 g) were resuspended in 300 ml of buffer B (20 mm KH2PO4 pH 7.4, 150 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.01% Igepal (a nonionic detergent purchased from Sigma), 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and the following protease inhibitors: aprotinin, chymostatin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A at 3 μg/ml each, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and lysed in the French Press. The crude lysate was clarified by ultracentrifugation (60 min at 100,000 × g), and the supernatant was applied onto a Q-Sepharose column (2.5 × 24 cm; 40 ml total). The Q column flow was applied onto a SP-Sepharose column (2.5 × 24 cm; 40 ml total). Following a wash with 80 ml of buffer B, the SP-Sepharose column was developed with a 400-ml gradient of 0-325 mm KCl in buffer B. Rdh54 peak fractions were identified by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining, pooled, and incubated with 2 ml Ni2+-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) for 2 h at 4°C. The matrix was poured into a column with an internal diameter of 1.0 cm and then washed with 24 ml of buffer B containing 500 mm KCl, 12 ml each of buffer B containing 10 and 20 mm imidazole, and then with 10 ml of buffer B containing 200 mm imidazole. The 200 mm imidazole eluate was further fractionated in a 0.5-ml Mono S column (Amersham Biosciences), using a 15-ml gradient of 0-325 mm KCl in buffer B. Rdh54-containing fractions were pooled and concentrated to 5 mg/ml in a Centricon-30 microconcentrator (Amicon). The overall yield of highly purified Rdh54 was ∼2 mg. The concentrated Rdh54 protein was divided into small aliquots and stored at -80 °C. The truncated Rdh54 variants (Δ34, Δ102, and Δ133) were purified using the same procedure as full-length Rdh54. The Rdh54-(1-133) fragment was purified using the combination of Ni2+-NTA-agarose and Mono S column steps. The concentration of the Rdh54 and rdh54 protein preparations was determined by densitometric scanning of SDS-polyacrylamide gels that contained multiple loadings of proteins against known amounts of bovine serum albumin run in the same gels.Other Protein Reagents—Rad51 and rad51 K191R was purified to near homogeneity from a yeast strain tailored to overexpress this protein, as described previously (29Sung P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1111-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 30Sung P. Stratton S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27983-27986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). E. coli topoisomerase I was purified to near homogeneity from the E. coli strain JM 101 containing plasmid pJW312-sal with the topA gene under the control of the Lac promoter, as described (31Lynn R.M. Wang J.C. Proteins. 1989; 6: 231-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar).Pulldown Assay—For affinity pulldown through the His6 tag on Rdh54 or the truncated variants, Rad51 (4 μg) was incubated with His6-Rdh54, His6-Rdh54Δ34, His6-Rdh54Δ102, His6-Rdh54Δ133, or the His6-Rdh54-(1-133) fragment (4.8 μg each) in 30 μl buffer C (20 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4, 75 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.01% Igepal, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) for 30 min on ice. These were incubated with 8 μl of Ni2+-NTA agarose beads for 30 min on ice with gentle mixing every 30 s. The beads were pelleted by centrifugation, and the supernatant was removed. After washing twice with 30 μl of buffer C containing 10 mm imidazole, the beads were treated with 20 μl of 2% SDS to elute bound proteins. The supernatant (8 μl), wash (12 μl), and SDS eluate (8 μl) were subjected to SDS-PAGE to determine their protein contents.ATPase Assay—The indicated amounts of Rdh54 and truncated variants were incubated at 37 °C in 10 μl of buffer D (35 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 3 mm MgCl2, and 50 mm KCl) containing 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 25 Ci/mol of [γ-32P]ATP at the final concentration of 1 mm, and pBluescript II SK DNA (23 μm base pairs). To examine the effect of Rad51 on Rdh54-mediated ATP hydrolysis, the indicated amount of Rad51 was mixed with pBluescript II SK DNA in buffer D at 37 °C for 3 min prior to the addition of Rdh54 or its truncated variants. Aliquots (2 μl) of the reactions were removed at the indicated times and mixed with an equal volume of 500 mm EDTA to halt the reaction. The level of ATP hydrolysis was determined by thin layer chromatography in polyethyleneimine cellulose sheets (J. T. Baker) with phosphorimaging analysis in a Personal FX phosphorimager using the Quantity One software (Bio-Rad), as described previously (12Petukhova G. Stratton S. Sung P. Nature. 1998; 393: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar).DNA Mobility Shift Assay—The 32P-labeled 80-mer dsDNA (30 nm) was incubated for 5 min at 37 °C with the indicated amounts of Rdh54 and truncated variants in 10 μl of buffer D with or without 2 mm ATP and an ATP-regenerating system consisting of 20 mm creatine phosphate and 30 μg/ml creatine kinase. The reaction mixtures were run in 10% polyacrylamide gels in TAE buffer (40 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EDTA). The gels were dried onto a sheet of DEAE paper to prevent the loss of the radiolabeled DNA and then subjected to phosphorimaging analysis.DNA Topology Modification Reaction—The indicated amounts of Rdh54 and truncated variants were incubated for 5 min at 23 °C with topologically relaxedϕX174 DNA (10μm base pairs) in 9.5μl of buffer D with 2 mm ATP and an ATP-regenerating system, followed by the addition of 100 ng of E. coli topoisomerase I. Reaction mixtures (10 μl, final volume) were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C, deproteinized with SDS (0.5%) and proteinase K (0.5 mg/ml) for 3 min at 37 °C, and then analyzed in 0.9% agarose gels run in TAE buffer. The DNA species were stained with ethidium bromide. To examine the effect of Rad51 on the DNA supercoiling reaction, Rdh54 (or one of the rdh54 truncation mutants) was incubated with the indicated amounts of Rad51 in buffer D for 10 min at 23 °C prior to the addition of the DNA substrate and incubation with topoisomerase.P1 Assay to Monitor DNA Strand Separation—The indicated amounts of Rdh54 and truncated variants were incubated for 2 min at 23 °C with topologically relaxed ϕX174 DNA (18.5 μm base pairs) in 10 μl buffer D with 2 mm ATP and an ATP-regenerating system, followed by the addition of 0.4 unit of P1 nuclease (Sigma). The reaction mixtures (10 μl, final volume) were incubated for 10 min at 30 °C and then deproteinized with SDS (0.5%) and proteinase K (0.5 mg/ml) for 3 min at 37 °C. The DNA species were resolved in 0.9% agarose gels containing 10 μm ethidium bromide in TAE buffer. To examine the effect of Rad51 on the DNA strand opening reaction, Rdh54 (or one of the rdh54 truncation mutants) was incubated with the indicated amounts of Rad51 in buffer D for 10 min at 23 °C prior to the addition of the DNA substrate and incubation with P1 nuclease.D-loop Assay—The 32P-labeled 90-mer oligonucleotide substrate (2.4 μm nucleotides) was incubated for 5 min at 37 °C with Rad51 (0.8 μm) in 10.5 μl buffer E (35 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm ATP, and an ATP-regenerating system). The indicated amounts of Rdh54 and truncated variants were then added in 1 μl, followed by a 1-min incubation at 23 °C. The D-loop reaction was initiated by adding pBluescript replicative form I DNA (35 μm base pairs) in 1 μl. The reaction mixtures were incubated for 5 min at 37 °C, deproteinized, and processed for electrophoresis in 0.9% agarose gels in TAE buffer, as above. The gels were dried onto a sheet of DEAE paper to prevent the loss of DNA and the radiolabeled D-loop was visualized and quantified in the phosphorimager.Assay to Monitor Rad51 Removal from DNA—To assemble Rad51-dsDNA nucleoprotein filament, Rad51 (3.7 μm) was incubated for 5 min at 37 °C with magnetic beads containing biotinylated dsDNA (15 μm base pairs) in 18 μl of buffer E. After the incorporation of the indicated amounts of Rdh54 or truncated variants in 1 μl and a 3-min incubation at 37°, the reactions were completed by adding linear pBluescript SK dsDNA (75 μm base pairs) in 1 μl. Following a 10-min incubation at 37 °C, the beads were captured with the Magnetic Particle Separator (Roche Applied Science), and the supernatants were set aside. Bound proteins were eluted from the beads with 10 μl of 2% SDS. The various supernatants and SDS eluates (8 μl each) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining to determine their content of proteins and also by agarose gel electrophoresis in TAE buffer followed by ethidium bromide staining to reveal the pBluescript dsDNA trap.RESULTSRdh54 ATPase Activity Is Required for Biological Function— Rdh54 possesses an ATPase function that is activated by DNA (13Petukhova G. Sung P. Klein H. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2206-2215Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Our published work (13Petukhova G. Sung P. Klein H. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2206-2215Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and the biochemical studies documented below are consistent with the idea that the Rdh54 ATPase activity is needed for biological efficacy. To obtain genetic evidence to support this premise, we replaced the chromosomal RDH54 gene with the rdh54 K352R allele, whose encoded protein is devoid of ATPase activity (13Petukhova G. Sung P. Klein H. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2206-2215Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) (see below). RDH54 is specifically needed for interhomologue recombination (9Klein H.L.

Recombination rate determinations of spontaneous mitotic interhomologue recombination between leu2 alleles showed that, like the rdh54Δ mutant, the rdh54K352R mutant is recombination deficient (Fig. 1). We next examined haploid and diploid rdh54K352R strains for their sensitivity to methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), which induces DNA damage that is repaired by HR. As shown in Fig. 2A, rdh54K352R strains are sensitive to MMS, in fact even more so t"
https://openalex.org/W2160760745,"The major photoproduct in UV-irradiated Bacillus spore DNA is a unique thymine dimer called spore photoproduct (SP, 5-thyminyl-5,6-dihydrothymine). The enzyme spore photoproduct lyase (SP lyase) has been found to catalyze the repair of SP dimers to thymine monomers in a reaction that requires S-adenosylmethionine. We present here the first detailed characterization of catalytically active SP lyase, which has been anaerobically purified from overexpressing Escherichia coli. Anaerobically purified SP lyase is monomeric and is red-brown in color. The purified enzyme contains ∼3.1 iron and 3.0 acid-labile S2– per protein and has a UV-visible spectrum characteristic of iron-sulfur proteins (410 nm (11.9 mm–1 cm–1) and 450 nm (10.5 mm–1 cm–1)). The X-band EPR spectrum of the purified enzyme shows a nearly isotropic signal (g = 2.02) characteristic of a [3Fe-4S]1+ cluster; reduction of SP lyase with dithionite results in the appearance of a new EPR signal (g = 2.03, 1.93, and 1.89) with temperature dependence and g values consistent with its assignment to a [4Fe-4S]1+ cluster. The reduced purified enzyme is active in SP repair, with a specific activity of 0.33 μmol/min/mg. Only a catalytic amount of S-adenosylmethionine is required for DNA repair, and no irreversible cleavage of S-adenosylmethionine into methionine and 5′-deoxyadenosine is observed during the reaction. Label transfer from [5′-3H]S-adenosylmethionine to repaired thymine is observed, providing evidence to support a mechanism in which a 5′-deoxyadenosyl radical intermediate directly abstracts a hydrogen from SP C-6 to generate a substrate radical, and subsequent to radical-mediated β-scission, a product thymine radical abstracts a hydrogen from 5′-deoxyadenosine to regenerate the 5′-deoxyadenosyl radical. Together, our results support a mechanism in which S-adenosylmethionine acts as a catalytic cofactor, not a substrate, in the DNA repair reaction.

Together, our results support a mechanism in which S-adenosylmethionine acts as a catalytic cofactor, not a substrate, in the DNA repair reaction. The unusual resistance of bacterial spores to UV light and ionizing radiation has been of long-standing interest. In 1965, Donnellan and Setlow (1Donnellan Jr., J.E. Setlow R.B. Science. 1965; 149: 308-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) showed that UV-irradiated bacterial spores did not contain the thymine dimers typically found in other irradiated cells but instead contained another type of thymine photoproduct. This dimer was later determined to be spore photoproduct (SP, 3The abbreviations used are: SP, spore photoproduct; AdoMet, S-adenosylmethionine; IPTG, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; SP lyase, spore photoproduct lyase. 5-thyminyl-5,6-dihydrothymine; see Fig. 1), a thymine dimer that appears to be unique to Bacillus subtilis and other spore-forming microorganisms (2Varghese A.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1970; 38: 484-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The generation of these unique thymine dimers upon UV irradiation is thought to result from the binding of small, acid-soluble proteins to the spore DNA (3Setlow P. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1988; 42: 319-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 4Setlow B. Sun D. Setlow P. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2312-2322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Setlow P. Mol.

During dormancy spores are unable to repair this damage to their DNA from UV exposure. Early in the germination cycle, however, two distinct mechanisms of DNA repair are active, presumably giving rise to the high level of UV resistance of bacterial spores. One of these mechanisms is the nucleotide excision repair pathway that detects and removes lesions from the DNA (including SP and cyclobutane-type pyrimidine dimers) in a manner similar to that characterized in Escherichia coli (8Freidberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995: 191-225Google Scholar, 9Yasbin R.E. Cheo D. Bol D. Sonenshein A.L. Hoch J.A. Losick R. Bacillus Subtilis and Other Gram-positive Organisms. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1993: 529-537Google Scholar). The second repair mechanism involves the specific reversal of SP to two thymines catalyzed by the enzyme SP lyase in B. subtilis (10Munakata N. Rupert C.S. J. Bacteriol. 1972; 111: 192-198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Munakata N. Rupert C.S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1974; 130: 239-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Pyrimidine dimers such as the spore photoproduct of Bacillus are a major component of UV-induced DNA damage. These dimers can block replication and transcription or can result in mutations if transcription does proceed past the region of the pyrimidine dimer. Repair of these dimers, therefore, is critical in order to avoid mutations. The only well characterized means of pyrimidine dimer repair is photoreactivation, which is catalyzed by the enzyme DNA photolyase (12Sancar A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 13Sancar A. Chem. Rev. 2003; 103: 2203-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar). The photolyase family of enzymes are activated by visible light and contain a flavin (FAD) and either folate or deazaflavin. It has been shown that DNA photolyases cleave cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers to their monomers through a reaction mechanism that involves a radical dimer species (12Sancar A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 13Sancar A. Chem. Rev. 2003; 103: 2203-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar). Photoreactivation has been shown to be absent in many species, including B. subtilis, suggesting that an alternative means of pyrimidine dimer repair might be found (14Fajardo-Cavazos P. Salazar C. Nicholson W.L. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1735-1744Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Donnellan Jr., J.E. Stafford R.S. Biophys.

SP lyase is the first identified nonphotoactivable pyrimidine dimer reversal enzyme, and thus it is of significant interest to probe the detailed mechanism of thymine dimer repair by this enzyme. SP lyase shares some sequence homology in its C-terminal region with members of the DNA photolyase/(6-4) photolyase/blue light photoreceptor protein family (14Fajardo-Cavazos P. Salazar C. Nicholson W.L. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1735-1744Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Todo T. Ryo H. Yamamoto K. Toh H. Inui T. Ayaki H. Nomura T. Ikenaga M.

Rev. 2000; 64: 548-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (1488) Google Scholar); structural studies of DNA photolyase reveal a helix-turn-helix DNA-binding site in this region. The N-terminal region of SP lyase includes a three cysteine motif, CX3CX2C, characteristic of the radical AdoMet superfamily (14Fajardo-Cavazos P. Salazar C. Nicholson W.L. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1735-1744Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Nicholson W.L. Chooback L. Fajardo-Cavazos P. Mol. Gen.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1097-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). This superfamily uses a site-differentiated [4Fe-4S] cluster and S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) to initiate diverse radical reactions, including the activation of glycyl radical enzymes and the biosynthesis of cofactors (21Cheek J. Broderick J.B. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2001; 6: 209-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 22Fontecave M. Mulliez E. Ollagnier-de-Choudens S. Curr. Opin. Chem.

Elsevier Ltd., Oxford, UK2004: 739-757Google Scholar). AdoMet coordinates an iron of the [4Fe-4S] cluster in radical AdoMet enzymes through the amino and carboxylate groups of AdoMet, as first demonstrated through spectroscopic studies of pyruvate formate-lyase-activating enzyme and subsequently observed in crystal structures of four other members of the superfamily (biotin synthase, HemN, MoaA, and lysine 2,3-aminomutase) (26Walsby C.J.

A. 2005; 102: 13819-13824Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Thus it appears that a site-differentiated cluster is conserved throughout the radical AdoMet superfamily because of an essential role for the unique iron of the cluster as a structural element, coordinating and anchoring AdoMet for subsequent radical chemistry (28Walsby C.J. Ortillo D. Broderick W.E. Broderick J.B. Hoffman B.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 11270-11271Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 29Walsby C. Ortillo D. Yang J. Nnyepi M. Broderick W.E. Hoffman B.M. Broderick J.B. Inorg. Chem. 2005; 44: 727-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The presence of the radical AdoMet motif in SP lyase suggested that it also would contain an iron-sulfur cluster and utilize AdoMet in catalysis (34Rebeil R. Sun Y. Chooback L. Pedraza-Reyes M. Kinsland C. Begley T.P. Nicholson W.L. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4879-4885Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In support of this hypothesis, Nicholson and co-workers (34Rebeil R. Sun Y. Chooback L. Pedraza-Reyes M. Kinsland C. Begley T.P. Nicholson W.L. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4879-4885Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that SP lyase purified from overexpressing E. coli contained iron and acid-labile sulfide and had a visible chromophore that decreased upon addition of dithionite. Although the SP lyase purified from E. coli showed no SP repair activity, SP lyase purified from overexpressing B. subtilis did catalyze AdoMet-dependent SP repair (34Rebeil R. Sun Y. Chooback L. Pedraza-Reyes M. Kinsland C. Begley T.P. Nicholson W.L. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4879-4885Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The active B. subtilis enzyme, however, was isolated in small quantities insufficient for iron and sulfur or spectroscopic analysis (34Rebeil R. Sun Y. Chooback L. Pedraza-Reyes M. Kinsland C. Begley T.P. Nicholson W.L. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4879-4885Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recent work provided evidence that SP lyase is a dimer in the [4Fe-4S] form, possibly with a cluster-bridged dimer architecture, and that SP lyase converts AdoMet to methionine and 5′-deoxyadenosine (35Rebeil R. Nicholson W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9038-9043Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). SP lyase, like many of the radical AdoMet enzymes, has been difficult to isolate and characterize in its catalytically active state due to problems with both cluster lability and protein instability; this is reflected in the fact that previous studies of SP lyase have been done on catalytically inactive protein, protein with a low cluster content, and/or protein that required artificial reconstitution of the iron-sulfur cluster. Our interest in understanding the properties of the iron-sulfur cluster in the native enzyme, as well as the detailed mechanism of catalysis, have led us to pursue the isolation of catalytically active enzyme containing an intact iron-sulfur cluster. We report here the first detailed characterization of catalytically active SP lyase isolated from overexpressing E. coli under strictly anaerobic conditions. Materials—B. subtilis strain KI1152 chromosomal DNA was a generous gift from Prof. Lee Kroos (Michigan State University) (36Ireton K. Grossman A.D. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3185-3195Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). B. subtilis strain 168 was obtained from the ATCC (ATCC 23857D). E. coli NovaBlue and Tuner(DE3)pLysS strains and the pET-14b expression vector were obtained from Novagen, and plasmid pUC18 was from Stratagene. The Co-Sepharose™ high performance resin was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Some bacterial cultures were grown in a defined MOPS medium (MM medium) that has been previously described (37Krebs C. Henshaw T.F. Cheek J. Huynh B.-H. Broderick J.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 12497-12506Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 38Garboczi D.N. Hullihen J.H. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15694-15698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). S-Adenosylmethionine was synthesized from methionine and ATP using AdoMet synthetase and subsequently purified by cation exchange chromatography as described previously (26Walsby C.J. Hong W. Broderick W.E. Cheek J. Ortillo D. Broderick J.B. Hoffman B.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 3143-3151Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). All other chemicals were obtained commercially and used as received. Subcloning, Growth, and Expression of SP Lyase—Amplification of the splB gene was accomplished with the synthetic oligonucleotide primers 5′-GAGCGCGCGCCATATGCAGAACCCATTTGT-3′ (containing an NdeI site) and 5′-GCGCGCGCGGATCCGGAATCGGAAAATGGCTGAT-3′ (containing a BamHI site), which were synthesized by the Michigan State Macromolecular Structure, Sequencing, and Synthesis Facility. The coding sequence was amplified using standard PCR techniques with B. subtilis chromosomal DNA (strain KI1152) as the template. The NdeI/BamHI-digested PCR product was cloned into the same sites in pET-14b, in-frame with an N-terminal hexahistidine tag. The resulting construct (pET-14b/spl17) was transformed into NovaBlue E. coli for isolation and purification of the plasmid DNA. pET14b/spl17 was then transformed into Tuner(DE3)pLysS E. coli for protein overexpression. The fidelity of the PCR product was verified by dideoxynucleotide sequencing. A single colony of the resulting overexpression strain was used to inoculate 50 ml of a defined MOPS medium (MM) containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin (37Krebs C. Henshaw T.F. Cheek J. Huynh B.-H. Broderick J.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 12497-12506Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This culture was grown to saturation at 37 °C and used to inoculate a 10-liter flask of MM/ampicillin. The 10-liter culture was grown at 37 °C in a New Brunswick Scientific fermentor (250 rpm, 5 p.s.i. O2). When the culture reached an A600 = 0.6, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was added to 1 mm final concentration, and the medium was supplemented with 750 mg of Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2. The culture was grown for an additional 2 h, and then was cooled to 25 °C and placed under nitrogen (5 p.s.i.). The culture was further cooled to 4 °C and left under nitrogen for 12 h. The cells were then harvested by centrifugation and stored under nitrogen at –80 °C until used for purification. Purification of SP Lyase—SP lyase was purified from E. coli Tuner(DE3)pLysS transformed with pET14b-SPL17, prepared as described above. All steps in the purification were performed in a single day under strictly anaerobic conditions in a Coy anaerobic chamber (Coy Laboratories, Grass Lake, MI) at 4 °C except where noted. Solutions and buffers used in the purification were thoroughly degassed by sparging with nitrogen or by repeated pump/purge cycles on a Schlenk line prior to bringing them into the Coy chamber. The pelleted cells (13–19 g) were brought into the anaerobic chamber and resuspended in 20–30 ml of pH 8.0 lysis buffer containing 20 mm sodium phosphate, 500 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 5% glycerol, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 mm imidazole, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg of lysozyme/g of cells, and 0.2 mg of DNase I and RNase A. This suspension was agitated for 1 h and then centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The resulting crude extract was loaded directly onto a Co-Sepharose™ High Performance affinity column (0.7 × 2.5 cm, 1 ml) that had been previously equilibrated with buffer A (20 mm sodium phosphate, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 5% glycerol, pH 8.0). The column was washed with 15 ml of buffer A, and then a 25-ml step gradient (5-ml steps at 10, 20, 50, 70, and 100% buffer B) from buffer A to buffer B (20 mm sodium phosphate, 500 mm NaCl, 500 mm imidazole, 5% glycerol, pH 8.0) was run to elute the adsorbed proteins. SP lyase eluted as a sharp brownish band at 50% buffer B. The fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and those judged to be ≥95% pure were pooled and concentrated at 4 °C using an Amicon concentrator equipped with a YM-10 membrane. The protein was placed in o-ring sealed tubes, flash-frozen, and stored at –80 °C. Protein, Iron, and Sulfide Assays—Routine determinations of protein concentrations were done by the method of Bradford (39Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217315) Google Scholar), using a kit sold by Bio-Rad and bovine serum albumin as a standard. Iron assays were performed using the methods of Fish (40Fish W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 54: 357-364Google Scholar) or Beinert (41Beinert H. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 54: 435-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Sulfide assays were carried out as described previously by Broderick et al. (42Broderick J.B. Henshaw T.F. Cheek J. Wojtuszewski K. Trojan M.R. McGhan R. Smith S.R. Kopf A. Kibbey M. Broderick W.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 269: 451-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) using a modification of the method developed by Beinert (43Beinert H. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 131: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Size Exclusion Chromatography—Purified SP lyase (25 μl, 350 μm) was loaded onto a pre-equilibrated Superose 12 column (1.0 × 30 cm; Amersham Biosciences) in 20 mm sodium phosphate, 500 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, pH 8.0. All work was carried out in an anaerobic Coy chamber at 4 °C with buffers degassed before use. A Bio-Rad gel filtration standard was used for molecular weight standardization. SP lyase elution was monitored at both 280 and 426 nm. Subcloning and Growth of sspC—Amplification of the sspC gene from B. subtilis was accomplished using the synthetic oligonucleotides, 5′-ATGGCTCAACAAAGTAGATCAAGATC-3′ and 5′-TTAATGAAATTGACCGCCCATGTTTT-3′ which were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies. The coding sequence was amplified using standard PCR techniques with B. subtilis chromosomal DNA (strain 168) as template. The blunt end PCR product was cloned into pETBlue1 using the pETBlue1 Perfectly Blunt cloning kit from Novagen. The resulting construct (pETBlue1/sspC) was transformed into NovaBlue Singles™ E. coli for isolation and purification of the plasmid DNA. pETBlue1/sspC was then transformed into Tuner(DE3)pLacI E. coli for protein overexpression. The fidelity of the PCR product was verified by dideoxynucleotide sequencing. A single colony of the resulting Tuner(DE3)pLacI/pET-Blue1/sspC overexpression strain was used to inoculate 50 ml of LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 34 μg/ml chloroamphenicol. This culture was grown to saturation at 37 °C and used to inoculate 6 × 2.8-liter Bellco flasks containing 750 ml of LB/ampicillin/chloroamphenicol medium. The flasks were grown at 37 °C with shaking (250 rpm) until the culture reached an A600 of 1.0, at which time IPTG was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm. The cultures were grown an additional 2 h and centrifuged to harvest the cells, which were stored at –80 °C. Purification of SspC—Harvested cells were lyophilized overnight and then crushed with a mortar and pestle until finely ground. A cold 50-ml solution of 30 mm HCl, 3% acetic acid was added to the dry cells; the suspension was stirred occasionally for 30 min at 4 °C. The mixture was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was saved. The pellet was resuspended in the above acetic acid/HCl solution and stirred and centrifuged as described above. The resulting supernatant was combined with the first and dialyzed against Milli-Q H2O (4 liters, 1 h) and then against 1% acetic acid (4 liters, 3 h, three times) followed by lyophilization. The residue was dissolved in 8 m urea, 10 mm Tris maleate, pH 5.5, and loaded onto a CM-cellulose column (15 × 113 mm). The column was washed with buffer A (10 mm Tris maleate, pH 5.5), and a linear gradient to 40% buffer B (1 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris maleate, pH 5.5) was run over a course of 600 ml at 2 ml/min with fractions collected every 8 ml. SDS-PAGE was used to check for purity, and fractions containing >95% SspC were pooled and lyophilized. The protein was redissolved in 4 ml of Milli-Q H2O, dialyzed against 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, and stored at –80 °C. Preparation of SP-containing DNA—Labeling of pUC18 DNA was carried out as follows. NovaBlue E. coli (Novagen) carrying pUC18 was grown overnight at 37 °C in 50 ml of 2× YT medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin, 0.45 mm deoxyadenosine, and 10 μm [methyl-3H]thymidine (0.74 MBq/ml) (Amersham Biosciences). Labeled DNA was extracted from the overnight culture using a Promega Wizard mini-prep kit. The specific activity of the purified DNA was typically 1.5 × 107 cpm/μmol. To form a complex between the [3H]DNA and the SspC, the two were mixed in a 5:1 SspC:DNA ratio in 70 μl of 25 mm Tris acetate, 125 mm NaCl, pH 7.0, and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h in a custom-made quartz vacuum hydrolysis tube. This complex was irradiated with 30 kJ/m2 UV light at 254 nm in order to form spore photoproduct on the [3H]DNA. To quantify the SP formed, the resulting irradiated DNA was hydrolyzed by the addition of 500 μl of trifluoroacetic acid, sealed under vacuum, and heated at 165 °C for 3 h. The hydrolyzed DNA was lyophilized and redissolved in 100 μl of Milli-Q H2O. The amount of spore photoproduct was quantified by running the irradiated hydrolyzed [3H]DNA on a Waters Spherisorb S5P 4.0 × 250-mm analytical column, run at a flow rate of 1.8 ml/min in degassed Milli-Q H2O for 25 min with fractions collected every 0.5 or 1 min (1Donnellan Jr., J.E.

Liquid scintillation counting was performed on each fraction using a Wallac 1414-001 or a Beckman LS 6500 liquid scintillation counter. Labeled thymine elutes at ∼3 min, and the spore photoproduct elutes at 10–11 min. The percentage of thymine in the spore photoproduct form was determined by dividing the counts/min in the SP peak by the total counts/min of the sample. Assay of SP Lyase Activity—SP lyase activity was determined using a modified version of the assay developed by Nicholson and co-workers (34Rebeil R. Sun Y. Chooback L. Pedraza-Reyes M. Kinsland C.

All solutions except DNA and protein solutions were prepared anaerobically in an Mbraun glove box just prior to use. Protein and DNA solutions were made anaerobic by repeated vacuum-purge cycles prior to bringing them into the glove box. Assays with and without SP lyase (1 μm) were set up in parallel in custom-made vacuum hydrolysis tubes in the glove box. Reaction mixtures (150–200 μl total volume) contained 0.2 nmol of SP lyase, 2 mm AdoMet, 25,000–50,000 cpm of 3H-pUC18 DNA (3H at the thymine methyl and containing 200–435 nmol SP), 4 mm dithiothreitol, 3 mm dithionite, and 30 mm KCl, all in 25 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.0. Identical experiments were set up in which the mixture was supplemented with 0.2 mm ferrous ammonium sulfate or in which holo-SP lyase was replaced with apo-SP lyase. All reaction mixtures were incubated under anaerobic conditions at 37 °C for 15 min to 24 h and terminated with the addition of 0.5 ml of trifluoroacetic acid. Hydrolysis tubes containing the quenched reactions were sealed under vacuum and heated to 165 °C for 2 h. The trifluoroacetic acid was evaporated, and the dried residue was resuspended in 100 μl of Milli-Q H2O. A portion of the solution (15 μl) was loaded onto a Waters Spherisorb S5P 4.0 × 250 mm analytical column and run at a flow rate of 1.8 ml/min in degassed Milli-Q H2O for 25 min with fractions collected every 0.5 or 1 min (1Donnellan Jr., J.E.

Samples were divided in half, and one part was used as above to test for repair activity. The other half was ultracentrifuged through a YM-10 filter to remove protein and DNA; a 15-μl aliquot of the resulting filtrate was loaded onto the C18 column and run with the above step gradient. Control samples were prepared without SP lyase to determine AdoMet stability over time and without AdoMet to check for background signals.

https://openalex.org/W2019533704,"Mast cells have critical effector functions in various immune reactions. In allergic inflammation, mast cells interact with tissue-infiltrating eosinophils, forming a regulatory unit in the late and chronic phases of the allergic process. However, the pathways and molecules within this unit are still largely undefined. Here, we show that human mast cells and eosinophils express DNAX accessory molecule 1 (DNAM-1, CD226) and its ligand Nectin-2 (CD112). CD226 synergizes with FcϵRI on mast cells, and its engagement augments degranulation through a pathway involving Fyn, linker of activation of T-cells, phospholipase C γ2, and CD18. This pathway is subject to negative interference by inhibitory receptors and is completely inhibited by linking IgE with IRp60 (CD300a) using a bispecific antibody. Moreover, blocking CD112 expressed on eosinophils using neutralizing antibodies normalized the hyperactivity resulting from IgE-dependent activation of mast cells co-cultured with eosinophils. Our findings demonstrate a novel interface between these two effector cells, implicating relevance for in vivo allergic states. Moreover, costimulatory responses might be a critical component in allergic reactions and may therefore become novel targets for anti-allergic therapy.

Our findings demonstrate a novel interface between these two effector cells, implicating relevance for in vivo allergic states. Moreover, costimulatory responses might be a critical component in allergic reactions and may therefore become novel targets for anti-allergic therapy. During the past decade, mast cells have been recognized as critical immune effector cells. Solid evidence indicates their involvement in various settings extending far beyond their traditionally associated context of type I hypersensitivity reactions, such as innate immunity (1Malaviya R. Ikeda T. Ross E. Abraham S.N. Nature. 1996; 381: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar), autoimmunity (2Secor V.H. Secor W.E. Gutekunst C.A. Brown M.A. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 813-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar), atherosclerosis (3Lappalainen H. Laine P. Pentikainen M.O. Sajantila A. Kovanen P.T. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 1880-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and more. Yet many aspects of their effector functions, even in the classical context of allergic reactions, are still unknown.Until recently, mast cell involvement in the allergic process was confined to its early/acute phase, of which FcϵRI-dependent activation forms the central trigger (4Galli S.J. Kalesnikoff J. Grimbaldeston M.A. Piliponsky A.M. Williams C.M. Tsai M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 23: 749-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar). The late/chronic phase, characterized by tissue inflammation and remodeling, was attributed solely to infiltrating leukocytes, notably to the eosinophils. However, several lines of evidence indicate that mast cells participate in modulation of the late/chronic phase mainly by their interactions with eosinophils and T lymphocytes. For example, mast cells induce T lymphocyte proliferation and enhance their activity through OX40/OX40L engagement (5Kashiwakura J. Yokoi H. Saito H. Okayama Y. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 5247-5257Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar).

Mekori Y.A. Bhattacharyya S.P. Bianchine P.J. Metcalfe D.D. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 4026-4033PubMed Google Scholar). FcϵRI-dependent activation of mast cells was shown to be enhanced by several receptors, including c-Kit (7Hundley T.R. Gilfillan A.M. Tkaczyk C. Andrade M.V. Metcalfe D.D. Beaven M.A. Blood. 2004; 104: 2410-2417Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), 4-1BB (8Nishimoto H. Lee S.W. Hong H. Potter K.G. Maeda-Yamamoto M. Kinoshita T. Kawakami Y. Mittler R.S.

Chem. 2004; 279: 48443-48448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Mast cell activity is also enhanced by multiple soluble factors as well. Moreover, it is likely to assume that positive signals, especially if operating via separate routes, will stack and synergize with each other.Although mast cell-eosinophil interactions were shown to enhance cytotoxic functions in helminthic infections, the data regarding mast cell-eosinophil cross-talk in allergic settings are very scarce. Early observations have demonstrated that eosinophil major basic protein and eosinophil cationic protein activate mast cells and basophils to degranulate (11Zheutlin L.M. Ackerman S.J. Gleich G.J. Thomas L.L. J. Immunol. 1984; 133: 2180-2185PubMed Google Scholar, 12O'Donnell M.C. Ackerman S.J. Gleich G.J. Thomas L.L. J. Exp. Med. 1983; 157: 1981-1991Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Eosinophils produce stem cell factor, potentially contributing to mast cell survival and activity (13Hartman M. Piliponsky A.M. Temkin V. Levi-Schaffer F. Blood. 2001; 97: 1086-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). On the other hand, mast cells produce IL-3, IL-5, and GM-CSF, important cytokines regulating eosinophil recruitment, survival, and activity (14Oskeritzian C. Milon G. Braquet P. Mencia-Huerta J.M. David B. Cell. Immunol. 1996; 167: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Mast cell tryptase evokes eosinophil degranulation through the protease-activated receptor PAR2 (15Temkin V. Kantor B. Weg V. Hartman M. Levi-Schaffer F. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 2662-2669Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). However, it is likely that information transfer between cells is mediated more by direct cell-cell interactions, being more efficient, accurate, and liable than paracrine communication systems.In this study, we demonstrate that human mast cells express DNAX accessory molecule 1 (DNAM-1, CD226) and its ligands Nectin-2 (CD112) and the poliovirus receptor PVR (CD155). We show that CD226 augments FcϵRI-mediated activation of mast cells by enhancing a signaling pathway dependent in part on Fyn, LAT, and PLCγ2 but not on Syk. Moreover, this pathway involves association of CD226 with integrins, and preferentially to CD18. We also demonstrate that this pathway is prone to inhibition by inhibitory receptors. Finally, we show that in the presence of eosinophils, mast cell FcϵRI-mediated activation is augmented and that this effect is mediated at least partially by a CD226/CD112 interaction. In conclusion, these findings demonstrate a novel interface between mast cells and eosinophils and suggest that CD226 and CD112 participate in modulation of the allergic response.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAntibodies and Reagents—All the cell culture media, reagents, and buffers were purchased from Biological Industries, Beit Haemek, Israel.

All other reagents were from Sigma, unless otherwise stated, and were of best chemical grade available. FcR blocking reagent 2.4G2 was purchased from BD Biosciences.Cell Culture—Human cord blood-derived mast cells were obtained and cultured as described (16Bachelet I. Munitz A. Moretta A. Moretta L. Levi-Schaffer F. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 7989-7995Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Briefly, mononuclear progenitors were isolated from cord blood by Ficoll gradient and cultured in α-MEM/10% fetal calf serum in the presence of stem cell factor, IL-6, and prostaglandin E2 for at least 7-8 weeks, with weekly refreshment of the culture medium. At weeks 7-8, mature mast cells were identified using toluidine blue and tryptase staining by FACS. Cells were used upon reaching >95% pure cultures.Eosinophils were purified from peripheral blood of untreated mildly atopic individuals (blood eosinophil levels >5%) as described (18Munitz A. Bachelet I. Eliashar R. Moretta A. Moretta L. Levi-Schaffer F. Blood. 2006; 107: 1996-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Briefly, eosinophils were isolated by a serial procedure of dextran sedimentation, Ficoll gradient, and magnetic cell sorting using anti-CD3/anti-CD16 beads and brought to >98% purity in RPMI 1640/10% fetal calf serum, assessed by Kimura's staining.HMC-1 cell line (a kind gift from Dr. J. Butterfield, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN) is maintained routinely in our laboratory and was cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium/10% fetal calf serum with refreshment of the medium upon reaching a cell density of 5 × 106cells/ml. Cord blood and peripheral blood were obtained upon signed consent of the donors, and the entire experimental plan was reviewed and approved by the Hadassah Hospital Helsinki Committee for Human Experimentation.Activation System and Mediator Assays—For mediator assays, cells were activated in Immunolon-2HB 96-well plates (ThermoLabsystems, MA). The plates were coated with sheep anti-mouse F(ab′)2 (25 μg/ml) followed by anti-CD226 (clone F5), anti-CD112, anti-CD155, or isotype control (10 μg/ml, 2 h at 37 °C). Mast cells were sensitized with human myeloma IgE (5 μg/ml, 2 h at 37 °C) 5 days prior to activation. On activation, cell were washed with Tyrode's buffer (137 mm NaCl, 12 mm NaHCO3, 5.5 mm l-glucose, 2 mm KCl, 0.3 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 0.9 mm MgCl2), added to the plate on ice simultaneously with mouse anti-human IgE antibody (5 μg/ml), and the plate was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Activation was stopped by removing supernatants from cells by centrifugation and freezing of both fractions for analysis. Tryptase was analyzed by a chromogenic assay as described (16Bachelet I. Munitz A. Moretta A. Moretta L. Levi-Schaffer F. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 7989-7995Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). IL-4 was analyzed by a commercial Duoset enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Diaclone, Besançon, France). Prostaglandin D2 was analyzed by a commercial enzymatic immunoassay kit (Cayman, Ann Arbor, MI).For intracellular flow cytometry, antibody incubations (specific and sheep anti-mouse antibody) and activation were performed with cells in suspension (30 min on ice for each antibody incubation). Cells were fixed at the stated time points (see below). For calcium mobilization, antibody incubations (specific and sheep anti-mouse antibody) were performed with cells in suspension (30 min on ice for each incubation), and cells were loaded with Calcium Green-1AM prior to activation (see below).Flow Cytometry—For surface cytometry, cells were washed once with cold HBA buffer (0.1% w/v bovine serum albumin, 0.05% w/v NaN3 in Hanks' solution), and both primary and secondary antibody incubations were performed in HBA buffer (30 min on ice with two washes after each incubation). For intracellular cytometry, cells were fixed (2% v/v formaldehyde in Hanks' solution, 10 min on ice) at the stated time points (see Results), permeabilized and blocked (5% w/v bovine serum albumin, 1% v/v human serum, 0.1% w/v saponin, 10 mm HEPES, 0.05% w/v NaN3 in Hanks' solution, 15 min on ice), and transferred to incubation buffer (0.1% w/v bovine serum albumin, 0.1% w/v saponin, 10 mm HEPES, 0.05% w/v NaN3 in Hanks' solution). Primary and secondary antibody incubations were performed in incubation buffer (30 min on ice with two washes after each incubation). Data were acquired in a BD Biosciences FACScalibur and analyzed using a CellQuest software on a Mac-based work station.Intracellular Ca2+ Mobilization—After antibody incubations, cells were loaded with Calcium Green-1AM (5 μm, 45 min, 37 °C) in α-MEM (2% v/v fetal calf serum), washed, and resuspended in 300 μl of Tyrode's gelatin buffer (Tyrode's buffer containing 0.1% w/v gelatin) prewarmed to 37 °C. The cells were allowed to flow freely in the cytometer for 30 s. At this time, mouse anti-human IgE antibody (5 μg/ml) was added. Changes in the FL-1 geo mean were recorded for a total of 3 min.Western Blot and Immunoprecipitation—After antibody incubations and activation, cells (106/group) were lysed using M-PER lysis buffer (Pierce) supplemented with protease inhibitor mix (Sigma). Cell lysates were run on SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and blotted versus specific proteins (see Results). Immunoprecipitations were performed with a commercial kit (Sieze™ Classic Mammalian Kit, Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions, using 7 × 106 cells/group. The antibodies used to precipitate CD226 were clone F22, which do not interfere with CD226 binding by clone F5 antibodies (see above). In some cases, cells were treated with 4 mm Na3VO4 (Sigma) for 10 min before lysis. Blotted membranes were developed using ECL Plus (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Inhibition Assay—The bispecific antibody linking CD300a to IgE (IE1H) was generated as described elsewhere (19Bachelet I. Munitz A. Levi-Schaffer F. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2006; 117: 1314-1320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). IE1H was used to treat mast cells activated with IgE and anti-CD226 as described above.Mast Cell-Eosinophil Co-culture—Freshly isolated eosinophils were blocked with 10% v/v human serum in RPMI 1640 (10 min on ice) followed by 2.4G2 Fc receptor blocking reagent (10 min on ice), incubated with anti-CD226, anti-CD112, anti-CD155, or isotype control (10 μg/ml, 10 min on ice), and washed. Other groups were further treated with GM-CSF (50 ng/ml, 20 min at 37 °C) and washed extensively. Eosinophils were then added to mast cells that were treated as described above (activation system) to the plate simultaneously with anti-human IgE antibody. Activation was terminated, and mediators were analyzed as described above.Statistical Analysis—Mediators were measured in triplicates and in at least three different sets of experiments or donor batches. Data are always the mean ± S.D. and were analyzed by analysis of variance followed by paired Student's t test assuming equal variances.RESULTSCD226 (DNAM-1), CD112 (Nectin-2), and CD155 (PVR) have been shown to mediate and modulate lymphocyte costimulation and effector functions such as tumor cell lysis (20Shibuya A. Campbell D. Hannum C. Yssel H. Franz-Bacon K. McClanahan T. Kitamura T. Nicholl J. Sutherland G.R. Lanier L.L. Phillips J.H.

Nakauchi H. Miyoshi H. Shibuya A. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 1829-1839Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Moreover, a recent study reported that these receptors are expressed on dendritic cells, thus having important consequences on dendritic cell-lymphocyte interactions (22Pende D. Castriconi R. Romagnani P. Spaggiari G.M. Marcenaro S. Dondero A. Lazzeri E. Lasagni L. Martini S. Rivera P. Capobianco A. Moretta L. Moretta A. Bottino C. Blood. 2006; 107: 2030-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar).We hypothesized that these molecules may modulate mast cell effector functions in allergic inflammation as well, with a strong emphasis on the manner by which these molecules can mediate information flow between mast cells and eosinophils. We were first set, therefore, to investigate whether CD226, CD112, and CD155 are expressed on mast cells and eosinophils. For this, human mast cells and eosinophils were screened using monoclonal antibodies recognizing CD226, CD112, and CD155. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that mast cells expressed high levels of CD226 and CD112 and negligible levels of CD155. Eosinophils expressed only high levels of CD112 and low levels of CD226 and CD155. We next examined the expression of these receptors on HMC-1 cells in comparison with their expression on primary mast cells. HMC-1 expressed high levels of all three receptors, including CD155, as opposed to the pattern observed on mast cells or eosinophils (Fig. 1).Once expression of these receptors on mast cells was established, we wished to discern whether they are capable of modulating signal transduction and activation in these cells. For this purpose, mast cells were activated by FcϵRI-IgE cross-linking, simultaneously with antibody-mediated engagement of CD226, CD112, and CD155. We have also activated cells with combinatorial linking (CD226+CD112, CD226+CD155, and CD112+CD155).Upon engagement of CD226, a substantial increase in FcϵRI-induced release of tryptase and IL-4 (Fig. 2A and data not shown, respectively) and in eicosanoid synthesis (Fig. 2B) was observed. This phenomenon was not shared by CD112 and CD155 or by the isotype control antibodies. Furthermore, the combinatorially linked cells displayed augmented degranulation only when CD226 was engaged.FIGURE 2Engagement of CD226 augments FcϵRI-induced mast cell activation. IgE-sensitized mast cells were activated by anti-IgE antibody, simultaneously with cross-linking of CD226, CD112, CD155, CD226+CD112, CD226+CD155, or CD112+CD155. A, tryptase levels were measured by a chromogenic assay. B, prostaglandin D2 was measured by enzymatic immunoassay. This figure is representative of four experiments.

Immunol. 2005; 17: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, it is still not known whether this mechanism is common regarding all the receptors that collaborate with CD226. Furthermore, mechanisms of mast cell costimulation have been reported that involve integrins, tumor necrosis factor superfamily receptors, chemokine receptors, and others. Thus, no particular hypothesis directed this stage of the study, and we adopted a screening approach of several signaling molecules critical within the mast cell activation cascade.We have examined the phosphorylation states of syk, LAT, ERK (p44/42 MAPK), PLCγ1, and PLCγ2 in FcϵRI-activated/CD226-engaged mast cells. At t = 15 min, CD226 augmented the phosphorylation of LAT and PLCγ2 but not of PLCγ1 (Fig. 3A). ERK phosphorylation was increased in CD226-engaged cells at t = 30 min. Syk phosphorylation levels remained unchanged in all experimental groups.FIGURE 3Engagement of CD226 induces a distinct signaling pathway. A, IgE-sensitized mast cells were activated by anti-IgE antibody following cross-linking with CD226 or isotype control. Cells were fixed, and phosphorylated signaling molecules were stained using specific antibodies and evaluated by intracellular FACS analysis. This figure is representative of three experiments. B, IgE-sensitized, CD226-engaged mast cells were loaded with Calcium Green-1AM and activated by anti-IgE antibody during flow cytometry at FL-1 versus time.

AU, arbitrary units.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Degranulation is ultimately induced by a cytosolic calcium influx. We have therefore examined the effect of CD226 on the mobilization of intracellular calcium. We found that CD226 induced a significantly increased calcium influx with an immediate onset (Fig. 3B).As a substrate of protein kinase activity, CD226 has been shown to possess a serine residue mediating its recruitment into lipid rafts and a tyrosine residue mediating its costimulatory activity (24Shirakawa J. Shibuya K. Shibuya A. Int. Immunol. 2005; 17: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Our next aim was therefore to investigate whether CD226 on mast cells undergoes the same changes as a part of its signaling mechanism. We have immunoprecipitated CD226 from FcϵRI-activated/CD226-engaged mast cells and used Western blot to detect phosphorylated serine. Indeed, as shown (Fig. 4), CD226 is serine-phosphorylated upon its engagement.FIGURE 4Engagement of CD226 induces serine phosphorylation. IgE-sensitized, CD226-engaged mast cells were activated by anti-IgE antibody, CD226 was immunoprecipitated (IP), and Western blot analysis was performed using anti-phosphoserine (p-Ser) antibodies. This figure is representative of three experiments. IB, immunoblot.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To identify the signaling events induced by CD226 in activated mast cells, we have screened for proteins with increased tyrosine phosphorylation level that occur upon CD226 engagement. Immunoprecipitation versus CD226 and Western blot analysis showed that in FcϵRI-activated/CD226-engaged cells, tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins that bind to CD226 include the following species (in kDa): ∼150, ∼125, ∼65, ∼55, and ∼45 (Fig. 5A). The p65 species correlate with CD226 itself since Syk signaling was not increased following CD226 engagement. On the other hand, LAT phosphorylation was shown to be augmented by CD226, and therefore, it is most likely to correlate to the p45 species.FIGURE 5CD226 associates with Fyn and CD18. IgE-sensitized, CD226-engaged mast cells were activated by anti-IgE antibody, CD226 was immunoprecipitated (IP) at 5 and 15 min, and Western blot analysis was performed using anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (pY)(A). IB, immunoblot. Western blot analysis was performed on the precipitated CD226 using anti-Fyn antibodies (B) and anti-CD18 (C). Immunoprecipitation of CD29 and CD18 or with isotype control (IgG) was performed after treatment of mast cells with Na3VO4, and Western blot analysis was performed using anti-CD226 antibodies (D). This figure is representative of three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Based on reports concerning the mechanism of CD226 activity in other cells, we hypothesized that the p55 and p125/p150 species correlate to Fyn and β integrins, respectively, both of which have been shown to associate physically with CD226 in lymphocytes. To test this hypothesis, we first blotted immunoprecipitated CD226 versus Fyn and found that Fyn is physically associated with CD226 already upon FcϵRI-induced activation, but this association is substantially increased upon CD226 engagement (Fig. 5B).Second, we have blotted CD226 versus CD29 and CD18 and observed that CD226 was strongly associated with CD18, but not with CD29, upon its engagement, although a lesser extent of association was also evident upon FcϵRI-induced activation (Fig. 5C). To discern whether this is due to inability of CD29 to bind to CD226 in mast cells, we have precipitated CD29 and CD18 from Na3VO4-treated cells and blotted them versus CD226. Indeed, CD226 associated preferentially to CD18, although a weak CD29 association was also observed (Fig. 5D).We next aimed at determining the susceptibility of CD226 costimulatory signaling to inhibition by immune inhibitory receptors. To test this, we have treated cells with a bispecific antibody linking CD300a to IgE, which was shown to inhibit mast cell degranulation (19Bachelet I. Munitz A. Levi-Schaffer F. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2006; 117: 1314-1320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) at varying concentrations prior to FcϵRI-activation. The augmented activation resulting from CD226 engagement was significantly reduced at 1 μg/ml bispecific antibody and was completely blocked at 10 μg/ml (Fig. 6A). The FcϵRI/CD226-induced cytosolic calcium influx followed this exact inhibitory pattern at 1 μg/ml (data not shown) and 10 μg/ml (Fig. 6B).FIGURE 6CD226-induced costimulation is blocked by linking IgE and CD300a. IgE-sensitized mast cells were activated by anti-IgE antibody following cross-linking with CD226 or isotype control. A bispecific antibody fragment linking IgE with CD300a (IE1H) or isotype (Iso) F(ab′)2 was added with the anti-IgE antibody at the indicated concentrations. Tryptase levels were measured using a chromogenic assay (A). Mast cells were activated during flow cytometry at FL-1 versus time, simultaneously with IE1H or isotype (Iso) F(ab′)2, after loading with Calcium Green-1AM (B).

For this, we have co-cultured mast cells with freshly isolated eosinophils after neutralization of CD226, CD112, and CD155 only on the eosinophils and induced FcϵRI activation. Moreover, some of the eosinophils were primed with GM-CSF prior to co-culture.We found that neutralization of CD112 on eosinophils, but not of CD226 or CD155, normalized activation level to that observed without co-culture (Fig. 7). The isotype control did not elicit any significant effects. Preincubation with GM-CSF did not significant"

https://openalex.org/W1981139762,"The overwhelming majority of DNA photoproducts in UV-irradiated spores is a unique thymine dimer called spore photoproduct (SP, 5-thymine-5,6-dihydrothymine). This lesion is repaired by the spore photoproduct lyase (SP lyase) enzyme that directly reverts SP to two unmodified thymines. The SP lyase is an S-adenosylmethionine-dependent iron-sulfur protein that belongs to the radical S-adenosylmethionine superfamily. In this study, by using a well characterized preparation of the SP lyase enzyme from Bacillus subtilis, we show that SP in the form of a dinucleoside monophosphate (spore photoproduct of thymidilyl-(3′–5′)-thymidine) is efficiently repaired, allowing a kinetic characterization of the enzyme. The preparation of this new substrate is described, and its identity is confirmed by mass spectrometry and comparison with authentic spore photoproduct. The fact that the spore photoproduct of thymidilyl-(3′–5′)-thymidine dimer is repaired by SP lyase may indicate that the SP lesion does not absolutely need to be contained within a single- or double-stranded DNA for recognition and repaired by the SP lyase enzyme.

The DNA of all organisms is subject to modifications upon exposure to a wide variety of chemical and physical agents. Among them, solar ultraviolet radiation is known to induce dimerization reactions between adjacent pyrimidines (1Lindahl T. Nature. 1993; 362: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (4224) Google Scholar). In the vast majority of living systems, the resulting photoproducts are cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) 5The abbreviations used are: CPD, cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer; AdoMet, S-adenosylmethionine; [Fe-S], iron-sulfur cluster; DTT, dithiothreitol; TpT, thymidilyl-(3′–5′)-thymidine; SPTpT, spore photoproduct of TpT; SP lyase, spore photoproduct lyase; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometry; DPA, dipicolinic acid.5The abbreviations used are: CPD, cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer; AdoMet, S-adenosylmethionine; [Fe-S], iron-sulfur cluster; DTT, dithiothreitol; TpT, thymidilyl-(3′–5′)-thymidine; SPTpT, spore photoproduct of TpT; SP lyase, spore photoproduct lyase; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometry; DPA, dipicolinic acid. and pyrimidine (6-4) pyrimidone photoproducts (Scheme 1A) that can be generated at any of the four bipyrimidine doublets (TT, CT, TC and CC), although the yields of the lesions depend on the bases involved (2Ravanat J.L. Douki T. Cadet J. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B. Biol. 2001; 63: 88-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). These lesions induce mutations and can be lethal because of blocking of the replication machinery. The photochemistry in bacterial spores is quite different. Indeed, in this dormant form produced by some bacteria such as Bacillus subtilis, the only photoproduct produced upon exposure to UV light corresponds to two thymines linked by the methyl group of one of the bases (3Varghese A.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1970; 38: 484-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 4Donnellan Jr., J.E. Setlow R.B. Science. 1965; 149: 308-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The formation of this specific lesion, 5-thyminyl-5,6-dihydrothymine (spore photoproduct, SP) (Scheme 1A), is explained by specific features of the spores, including DNA conformation (A form), dehydration, the presence of dipicolinic acid in the core, and binding of small acid-soluble proteins to DNA (5Setlow B. Setlow P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 421-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 6Nicholson W.L. Setlow B. Setlow P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8288-8292Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 7Douki T. Setlow B. Setlow P. Photochem. Photobiol. 2005; 81: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 8Douki T. Setlow B. Setlow P. Photochem. Photobiol. Sci. 2005; 4: 591-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The formation of SP as the unique DNA lesion in irradiated spores is proposed to account for their extreme resistance to UV radiation. Indeed, spores express a specific repair enzyme, the spore photoproduct lyase (SP lyase) that directly reverts SP to two unmodified thymines upon germination (9Setlow P. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1995; 49: 29-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 10Slieman T.A. Rebeil R. Nicholson W.L. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6412-6417Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), much more efficiently than dimeric photoproducts are removed from other cell types by the classical nucleotide excision repair pathway. The specific photochemistry of DNA in spores combined with the action of SP lyase appears to be a major evolutionary advantage for spore-forming bacteria in resistance to UV radiation. In their N-terminal half, all SP lyase enzymes contain a strictly conserved amino acid sequence containing three cysteines CXXXCXXC that have been shown to be essential for activity by site-directed mutagenesis (11Fajardo-Cavazos P. Rebeil R. Nicholson W.L. Curr. Microbiol. 2005; 51: 331-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). These cysteines have therefore been proposed to provide protein ligands for a catalytically essential [4Fe-4S]+2/+1 cluster (11Fajardo-Cavazos P. Rebeil R. Nicholson W.L. Curr. Microbiol. 2005; 51: 331-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This CXXXCXXC sequence is indeed the signature for a superfamily of [4Fe-4S] iron-sulfur enzymes, named “radical SAM” (12Sofia H.J. Chen G. Hetzler B.G. Reyes-Spindola J.F. Miller N.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1097-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar), involved in a variety of biosynthetic pathways and metabolic reactions that proceed via radical mechanisms (13Fontecave M. Mulliez E. Ollagnier-de-Choudens S. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2001; 5: 506-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 14Cheek J. Broderick J.B. J. Biol. Inorg.

Spectroscopic and biochemical studies from Nicholson and co-workers (16Rebeil R. Nicholson W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9038-9043Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and Broderick and co-workers (17Cheek J. Broderick J.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 2860-2861Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) have shown the following: (i) the protein carries a single iron-sulfur cluster (16Rebeil R. Nicholson W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9038-9043Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar); (ii) the reaction is absolutely dependent on S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) (16Rebeil R. Nicholson W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9038-9043Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 17Cheek J. Broderick J.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 2860-2861Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar); and (iii) the repair mechanism is likely to involve a 5′-deoxyadenosyl radical (Ado·) generated through reductive cleavage of AdoMet (16Rebeil R. Nicholson W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9038-9043Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 17Cheek J. Broderick J.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 2860-2861Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Labeling experiments indicate that the reaction is initiated by direct C-6 hydrogen atom abstraction by Ado·, with the resulting substrate radical undergoing scission to re-generate the two initial thymines (Scheme 2) (17Cheek J. Broderick J.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 2860-2861Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The SP lyase enzyme demonstrates a novel aspect of the diversity of DNA repair mechanisms in living organisms. In particular, it is remarkable that in the case of this enzyme, DNA repair is achieved through nucleotide radical intermediates, generally considered as precursors of DNA damage. To better understand the chemistry of this unique enzyme, we undertook this study. The first issues we address concern the substrate specificity of SP lyase. The following still are not known: (i) whether a dinucleotide SP lesion is a substrate; (ii) whether the phosphodiester bridge between the two nucleosides of the lesion is important; and (iii) whether the enzyme is stereoselective. To be able to answer these issues, it is absolutely required that well defined compounds rather than UV-irradiated plasmid DNA are used as substrates. Here we report an original preparation of the SP lesion in the form of a dinucleoside monophosphate (SPTpT) (Scheme 1B). Using a well characterized preparation of recombinant SP lyase from B. subtilis, we show that SPTpT is recognized and efficiently repaired by the enzyme (Scheme 1B). This new substrate provides a convenient assay for further enzymatic studies. Combined with a previous study addressing the question of the stereoselectivity of the enzyme (18Friedel M.G. Berteau O. Pieck J.C. Atta M. Ollagnier-de-Choudens S. Fontecave M. Carell T. Chem. Commun. (Camb.). 2006; 4: 445-447Crossref Google Scholar), this work provides new insights into the chemistry of SP lyase. Materials—The following strains were used in this study. Escherichia coli DH5α was used for routine DNA manipulations. E. coli Tuner (DE3) (Stratagene) was used for SP lyase overexpression. Enzymes, oligonucleotides, and culture media were purchased from Invitrogen. T4 DNA ligase was from Promega. Bacterial alkaline phosphatase and plasmid DNA purification kit, Flexiprep™, were from Amersham Biosciences. DNA fragments were extracted from agarose gel and purified with High Pure PCR product purification kit (Roche Applied Science), and DNA sequencing was performed by Genome Express (Grenoble, France). TpT was prepared as described previously (19Beaucage S.L. Iyer R.P. Tetrahedron. 1992; 48: 2223-2311Crossref Scopus (633) Google Scholar). Cloning and Construction of SP Lyase-overexpressing Plasmids—The SplB gene, encoding SP lyase, was amplified by a PCR-based method using B. subtilis genomic DNA as a template. The following primers were used: 5′-tgtggccatATGcagaacccatttgttccg-3′ (NdeI site underlined and ATG codon in uppercase) hybridized to the noncoding strand at the 5′ terminus of the gene and 5′-tttataaaaaagcttgctgttgatcacaac-3′ (HindIII site underlined) hybridized to the coding strand. PCR was run on a Stratagene RoboCycler Gradient 40 machine. The PCR product was digested with NdeI and HindIII and then ligated with T4 DNA ligase into the pT7-7 plasmid, which had been digested previously with the same restriction enzymes. The cloned gene was entirely sequenced to ensure that no error was introduced during the PCR. The plasmid was then named pT7-SPL. The hexahistidine linker sequence was introduced into pT7-SPL as described previously (20Rebeil R. Sun Y. Chooback L. Pedraza-Reyes M. Kinsland C. Begley T.P. Nicholson W.L. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4879-4885Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The new plasmid was named pT7-SPL6H. Protein Expression—E. coli Tuner (DE3) were transformed by pT7-SPL6H and then grown overnight at 37 °C in LB medium (100 ml) supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml). The overnight culture was used to inoculate fresh LB medium (10 liters) supplemented with the same antibiotic, and bacterial growth was allowed to proceed at 37 °C until A600 reached 0.9. To reduce formation of inclusion bodies, protein expression was performed at 18 °C and induced by adding 500 μm of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells were collected after 18 h of culture by centrifugation at 4000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min and resuspended in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm KCl). The cells were disrupted by sonication and centrifuged at 220,000 × g at 4 °C for 1 h and 30 min. The solution obtained was then loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-Sepharose-superflow column that had been equilibrated previously with buffer A. The column was washed extensively with the same buffer. Nonspecifically adsorbed proteins were eluted by a wash step with buffer A containing 30 mm imidazole, and then the SP lyase was eluted with buffer A containing 0.5 m imidazole. Fractions containing SP lyase were immediately concentrated in an Amicon cell fitted with a YM30 (Spectrapor) membrane, and 3 mm DTT was added before freezing. Aggregation State Analysis—Fast protein liquid chromatography gel filtration with an analytical Superdex-75 (Amersham Biosciences) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, equilibrated with 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7, containing 200 mm KCl, was used for size determination and was performed under strict anaerobic conditions. A gel filtration calibration kit (calibration protein II; Roche Applied Science) was used as molecular weight standards. Iron and Sulfide Binding to SP Lyase—The following procedure was carried out anaerobically in a glove box (Jacomex B553 (NMT)). ApoSP lyase (100 μm monomer) was treated with 5 mm DTT and incubated overnight with a 5-fold molar excess of both Na2S (Fluka) and (NH4)2Fe(SO4)2 (Aldrich) at 6 °C. The protein was desalted on Sephadex G-25 (80 ml, same buffer), and the colored fractions were concentrated on Nanosep 10 (Amicon). Production of SPTpT Substrates—The spore photoproduct of the dinucleoside monophosphate thymidylyl-(3′–5′)-thymidine was prepared in two different ways. It was first obtained by hydrolysis of UVC-irradiated DNA, as described previously (21Douki T. Cadet J. Photochem. Photobiol. Sci. 2003; 2: 433-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Briefly, dry films of calf thymus DNA (Sigma) were prepared by freeze-drying an aqueous solution and subsequently exposing them to the UVC light emitted by a germicidal lamp. Irradiated DNA was then resuspended in water and digested by sequential incubation with nuclease P1 and phosphodiesterase II, pH 5, and alkaline phosphatase and phosphodiesterase I, pH 8. Normal bases were released as nucleosides, whereas bipyrimidine photoproducts were found as modified dinucleoside monophosphates. SPTpT was purified by HPLC. The concentration of the final solution was determined after acidic hydrolysis of an aliquot and comparison of the intensity of the HPLC signal of the released thymine spore photoproduct with that of an authentic standard. SPTpT was also prepared by exposure of dry films of TpT and dipicolinic acid (DPA) to UVC radiations (Scheme 1B). For this purpose, 300 ml of 1 mm TpT solution containing 10 mm DPA under its sodium form (pH 7) was prepared. The solution was divided in six equal fractions that were poured in six 15-cm diameter Petri dishes and freeze-dried overnight. The dry films were then exposed for 1 h to UVC light. The dry residues were made soluble in 30 ml of water. The freeze-drying/irradiation/solubilization cycle was repeated six times. After the last irradiation, the whole dry residue was made soluble in 10 ml of water. SPTpT was isolated by reverse phase HPLC in the gradient mode by using triethyl ammonium acetate, pH 6.5, and acetonitrile as solvents. Identity and purity of the collected photoproduct were inferred from the comparison of its HPLC-MS/MS features with those of authentic SPTpT isolated from DNA. In addition, an aliquot fraction (100 μl) of the purified SPTpT was mixed with pure formic acid. The resulting solution was heated at 120 °C for 2 h and then dried under vacuum. The residue was made soluble in 100 μl of water and characterized by HPLC-MS/MS. Irradiation conditions were optimized by irradiating 1 × 1-cm dry films prepared from 1 ml of solutions containing 0.3 mm TpT and increasing concentration of either the Ca2+ or the Na+ salt of DPA. SP Lyase Activity—Typically, the reaction mixture contained wild-type SP lyase (1 μm), SPTpT substrate (10 μm), AdoMet (1 mm), and DTT (2 mm) in a final volume of 50 μl of 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, containing 200 mm KCl. In addition, either dithionite (3 mm) or the physiological reducing system (Fldx/Fldx red/NADPH, 4:1:1 μm) was added as a reductant. The reactions were carried out under anaerobic conditions at 37 °C for various periods of time. At each time point (0, 10, 30, 60, 120, and 240 min) 5 μl of the solution was transferred to an Eppendorf tub, and the reaction stopped by flash-freezing in liquid nitrogen. Each sample was then diluted in 45 μl of 2 mm triethyl ammonium acetate and analyzed by HPLC coupled to mass spectrometry for their TpT and SPTpT content. When irradiated calf thymus DNA was used as a substrate, 10 μm enzyme was incubated with AdoMet (1 mm), dithionite (2 mm), DTT (2 mm) in a final volume of 50 μl of 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, containing 200 mm KCl. HPLC-Mass Spectrometry Analysis—Conversion of the spore photoproduct (SPTpT) into the unmodified dinucleoside monophosphate (TpT) in SP lyase-treated samples was quantified by HPLC coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). Samples (20 μl from the initial 50 μl) were injected onto an Uptisphere ODB (particle size 3 μm, 150 × 2 mm inner diameter) octadecylsilyl silica gel column (Interchim, Montluçon, France) connected to a series 1100 Agilent chromatographic system. A gradient of acetonitrile (maximum proportion 10%) in 2 mm aqueous triethylammonium acetate was used at a flow rate of 200 μl/min. The eluent was mixed with methanol (100 μl/min) at the outlet of the HPLC column, and the mixture was directed on-line toward the inlet of an API 3000 triple quadrupolar mass spectrometer (SCIEX/Applied Biosystems, Toronto, Canada). The mass spectrometer was used in the multiple reaction monitoring mode. Under these conditions, the ions produced in the electrospray source were filtered in the first quadrupole to select only ions of mass-to-charge ratio of 545 ([M – H]–). The ions were then directed toward a second quadrupole used as a collision cell. Specific fragments, corresponding to the major peaks of the fragmentation spectrum of the compounds of interest, were quantified after selection in a third quadrupole. The monitored transitions were 545 to 251 (loss of the two 2-deoxyribose units and the phosphate group) for SP and 545 to 419 (loss of a thymine moiety) for TpT. A third transition, 545 to 195 (release of phosphorylated 2′-deoxyribose), was also used and gave a signal for both compounds. HPLC-MS/MS was also used to quantify the level of cyclobutane dimers and (6-4) photoproducts within the DNA (22Douki T. Cadet J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2495-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). For HPLC-MS identification purposes, the molecular mass of the compounds was first determined with the mass spectrometer recording full mass spectra in the 200–600 mass range. In a second step, the pseudo-molecular ion (545 for SPTpT and 251 for its hydrolysis product) was fragmented. Fragmentation spectra were recorded in the 200–600 and 30–260 mass range, respectively. Protein Analysis—Protein concentration (by monomer) was determined by the method of Bradford (23Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211946) Google Scholar). Protein-bound iron (24Fish W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 158: 357-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar) and labile sulfide (25Beinert H. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 131: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar) were determined according to standard procedures. Light Absorption Spectroscopy—UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded with a Cary 1 Bio (Varian) spectrophotometer. EPR—Reconstituted SP lyase (250 μm, 3.9 iron/protein) was reduced with 3 mm dithionite under anaerobic conditions for 20 min and frozen inside the glove box. X-band EPR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Instruments ESP 300D spectrometer equipped with an Oxford Instruments ESR 900 flow cryostat (4.2–300 K). Spectra were quantified under nonsaturating conditions by double integration against a 1 mm Cu-EDTA standard. Mössbauer Spectroscopy—For Mössbauer measurements, reconstituted SP lyase (6.23 mg) was prepared as described above in a total volume of 2.6 ml. After cluster reconstitution (3.9 iron/protein), the mixture was desalted on a NAP-25 column (Amersham Biosciences) and concentrated by ultrafiltration using a Nanosep 30 membrane (Amicon) to a final volume of 400 μl. The protein solution was transferred into a Mössbauer cup and frozen in liquid nitrogen. 57Fe-Mössbauer spectra were recorded at zero magnetic field on a spectrometer operating in constant acceleration mode using an Oxford cryostat that allowed temperatures from 1.5 to 300 K and a 57Co source in rhodium. Isomer shifts are reported relative to metallic iron at room temperature. Characterization of the SP Lyase Enzyme—The enzyme was an N-terminal His-tagged protein purified from extracts of an E. coli strain overexpressing the splB gene from B. subtilis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Analysis by denaturing gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) showed that SP lyase was obtained as nearly pure protein with an apparent molecular mass of 41 kDa, as expected from the amino acid sequence (data not shown). The as-isolated pure protein, which lacked the light absorption bands in the visible spectrum characteristic for [Fe-S] clusters and did not contain measurable amounts of iron and sulfur, had a marked propensity to precipitate that was partly prevented by using buffers containing large concentrations of salt (200 mm KCl). Addition of DTT and glycerol also helped in this matter. Nevertheless, even under these conditions, only 30% of the SP lyase remained soluble after 48 h at 4 °C. We prepared the holo-form of the enzyme by reconstituting the [Fe-S] cluster by treatment of the as-isolated apoform with iron and sulfide salts under anaerobic conditions in accordance with procedures described previously (26Tamarit J. Mulliez E. Meier C. Trautwein A. Fontecave M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31291-31296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). After reconstitution, the enzyme was found to contain ∼3.5–3.9 iron and sulfur atoms per protein monomer. In the holo-form, and under anaerobic conditions, the protein no longer precipitated and could resist several cycles of freezing-thawing without precipitation, loss of the cluster, or inactivation. Size exclusion chromatography analysis of the reconstituted enzyme under anaerobic conditions showed that SP lyase exists predominantly as a dimer in solution, as shown previously (16Rebeil R. Nicholson W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9038-9043Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The light absorption spectrum of the reconstituted protein, shown in Fig. 1A, is very different from that reported previously (20Rebeil R. Sun Y. Chooback L. Pedraza-Reyes M. Kinsland C. Begley T.P. Nicholson W.L. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4879-4885Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is most similar to spectra of other [Fe-S] proteins of the radical SAM enzyme superfamily (ribonucleotide reductase, MiaB, and HemN) (26Tamarit J. Mulliez E. Meier C. Trautwein A. Fontecave M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31291-31296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 27Pierrel F. Hernandez H.L. Johnson M.K.

It is thus consistent with the presence of a large proportion of polypeptides carrying a [4Fe-4S] cluster in solution. If [2Fe-2S] clusters are present, the UV-visible spectrum indicates that they account for a minor proportion of total iron. Exposure of the protein to air resulted in a rapid degradation of the cluster, as measured by the decrease of the absorption band at 420 nm (data not shown). This explained why the as-isolated protein was in the apo-form. During anaerobic reduction of the reconstituted protein with an excess of sodium dithionite, the solution bleached with a concomitant decrease of the absorption band at 420 nm. The resulting reduced solution displayed an axial EPR spectrum with g values of 2.03 and 1.93 (Fig. 1B). The temperature dependence and microwave power saturation properties of the EPR signals were characteristic for the S = 1/2 ground state of a [4Fe-4S]+1 cluster (data not shown). Integration of the signal indicated that only 10% of total iron present in the sample was in the form of a reduced [4Fe-4S]+1 cluster. This likely results from incomplete reduction of the cluster because of a low redox potential, as generally observed in the radical SAM family of enzymes, and may also be related to partial degradation of the protein under reducing conditions. The following provides the first characterization of the SP lyase iron centers by Mössbauer spectroscopy, using a protein sample that had been anaerobically reconstituted with 57Fe and sulfide. This study was carried out because we are aware of examples for which Mössbauer spectroscopy contradicted UV-visible spectroscopy regarding the nature and diversity of protein-bound clusters. The Mössbauer spectra, obtained at 78 and 4.2 K, are displayed in Fig. 2. At both temperatures, quadrupole doublets were observed. Inspection of the spectra indicates that the protein sample was not homogeneous and contained at least four different species labeled A–D, respectively. In Fig. 2 the solid lines are simulations obtained with four different doublets using the parameters and relative amounts listed in Table 1. Because the left line of the four quadruple doublets coalesces at approximately +0 mm/s, the determination of the hyperfine parameters of these species suffers from a rather large degree of uncertainty. Moreover, there is a significant overlap between doublets A and B, and therefore their relative area ratios cannot be determined accurately. For C and D, the determination of the area is more reliable because the high energy absorption peaks are well resolved. The 4.2 and 78 K spectra are almost identical except for an apparent small decrease of the area attributed to doublet B. The ratios quoted in Table 1 are derived from the spectrum at 4.2 K.TABLE 1Parameters and relative amounts of Mössbauer doublets obtained by simulationsSiteδΔEQAreamm/s%A0.44 (4)1.06 (12)40 (5)B0.33 (5)0.66 (10)27 (5)C0.70 (10)1.98 (20)12 (2)D1.26 (10)2.88 (20)21 (2) Open table in a new tab Doublet D is attributed to octahedral Fe2+ (S = 2) impurities accounting for ∼20% of total iron. Doublet C can also be assigned to ferrous iron (about 10% of total iron), but whether it belongs to an [Fe-S] complex cannot be established. The hyperfine parameters of the major doublet A (Table 1) are consistent with a [4Fe-4S]2+ (S = 0) cluster, accounting for 40% of total iron, and are comparable with parameters reported for clusters of other radical SAM enzymes (29Krebs C.

As is often the case with such enzymes, [2Fe-2S]2+ (S = 0) clusters are also present in the SP lyase preparations. The parameters of doublet B are consistent with such a cluster, and they are in the range of those obtained for [2Fe-2S]2+ clusters found in ribonucleotide reductase-activating enzyme and in biotin synthase (31Mulliez E.

Furthermore, we exclude the presence of [3Fe-4S]+ clusters in SP lyase preparations on the basis of the absence of characteristic S = 1/2 signals in the EPR spectrum (data not shown). As a conclusion the Mössbauer spectra from preparations from anaerobically reconstituted SP lyase indicate a large degree of inhomogeneity regarding the nature of the [Fe-S] clusters, despite a well defined UV-visible spectrum. Apart from the presence of high spin ferrous impurities, the results are consistent with the presence of [2Fe-2S]2+ and ["

Previous studies demonstrated a specialized homotetrameric structure with two pairs of catalytic domains, one at each end of a dumbbell-shaped molecule. This suggests that they perform their spindle roles by cross-linking and sliding antiparallel spindle microtubules. However, the exact kinesin-5 sequence elements that are important for formation of the tetrameric complexes have not yet been identified. In addition, it has not been demonstrated that the homotetrameric form of these proteins is essential for their biological functions. Thus, we investigated a series of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Cin8p truncations and internal deletions, in order to identify structural elements in the Cin8p sequence that are required for Cin8p functionality, spindle localization, and multimerization. We found that all variants of Cin8p that are functional in vivo form tetrameric complexes. The first coiled-coil domain in the stalk of Cin8p, a feature that is shared by all kinesin-5 homologues, is required for its dimerization, and sequences in the last part of the stalk, specifically those likely involved in coiled-coil formation, are required for Cin8p tetramerization. We also found that dimeric forms of Cin8p that are nonfunctional in vivo can nonetheless bind to microtubules. These findings suggest that binding of microtubules is not sufficient for the functionality of Cin8p and that microtubule cross-linking by the tetrameric complex is essential for Cin8p mitotic functions.

Mitotic chromosome segregation is the mechanism by which duplicated genomic information is transmitted to daughter cells during cell division. This essential process is mediated by the mitotic spindle, a highly dynamic, microtubule-based structure that undergoes a distinct set of morphological changes. Many of these changes are achieved by the action of molecular motors from the kinesin-5 (BimC) family, which use ATP hydrolysis to unidirectionally move along microtubules. Members of the kinesin-5 family are conserved in the amino acid sequence of the motor (force-producing) domain and apparently perform similar roles in many different cell types (1Hagan I. Yanagida M.

Kinesin-5 motors are required for bipolar spindle assembly, and elimination of their function blocks this essential early mitotic step in fungal, insect, and mammalian cells (8Barton N.R. Goldstein L.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1735-1742Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 9Hildebrandt E.R. Hoyt M.A. Biochim. Biophys.

The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae expresses two kinesin-5 motors that overlap in function, Cin8p and Kip1p. Although neither is individually essential, one of the pair is required for viability (2Hoyt M.A. He L. Loo K.K. Saunders W.S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 109-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 3Roof D.M. Meluh P.B. Rose M.D. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 95-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 12Saunders W.S. Hoyt M.A. Cell. 1992; 70: 451-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Loss of KIP1 function causes less severe phenotypes than loss of CIN8, suggesting that Cin8p is more important for successful yeast spindle function (2Hoyt M.A. He L. Loo K.K. Saunders W.S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 109-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Aside from their essential role in spindle assembly, Cin8p and Kip1p are also required for the maintenance of spindle bipolarity following assembly and are responsible for producing most of the spindle-elongating force during anaphase (2Hoyt M.A. He L. Loo K.K. Saunders W.S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 109-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 13Saunders W.S. Koshland D. Eshel D. Gibbons I.R. Hoyt M.A. J.

Kinesin-5 motor proteins are unique molecular motors in that they function as homotetramers, with pairs of catalytic motor domains located on opposite sides of the active motor complex (15Kashina A.S.

Chem. 1999; 274: 28779-28786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). It is thought that this special architecture enables the kinesin-5 motors to cross-link and slide antiparallel microtubules originating from opposite spindle poles (8Barton N.R. Goldstein L.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1735-1742Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 10Kashina A.S. Rogers G.C. Scholey J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1357: 257-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Similar to other members of the kinesin superfamily, the N-terminal catalytic domain of kinesin-5 motors is responsible for their motor activity, i.e. binding and moving along microtubules. The stalk and the tail regions are believed to contain structural elements that are responsible for multimerization of the kinesin-5 protein complex. Although it has been demonstrated that truncated forms of kinesin-5 polypeptides that contain the catalytic domain and parts of the stalk form dimers (17Lockhart A. Cross R.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2365-2373Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), the precise structural elements in the stalk and tail that are essential for their dimerization and tetramerization have not as yet been identified. In addition, although it has been recently demonstrated that the tetrameric kinesin-5 HsEg5 can slide antiparallel microtubules in vitro (18Kapitein L.C. Peterman E.J. Kwok B.H. Kim J.H. Kapoor T.M. Schmidt C.F. Nature. 2005; 435: 114-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar), it is not clear whether formation of this homotetrameric complex structure is essential for kinesin-5 intracellular functions. In this study we investigated the in vivo and in vitro properties of a series of Cin8p truncations and internal deletions, in order to identify structural elements in the Cin8p sequence that are required for Cin8p functionality, spindle localization, and multimerization. Microscopy, gel electrophoresis, and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (19Hildebrandt E.R. Hoyt M.A. Mol. Biol.

Hydroxyurea (Sigma) was added to 0.1 m in pH 5.8 liquid synthetic media. S. cerevisiae strains are listed in Table 1. All strains were derivatives of S288C with the exception of the strain BS334, which was used for overexpression of Cin8p from the PGAL1 promoter.

Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). CIN8 truncation and deletion alleles were constructed by either restriction enzyme cleavage and religation or oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis using either the USE mutagenesis method (23Nicolas G. Pedroni S. Fournier C. Gautero H. Lecomte M.C. BioTechniques. 1997; 22: 430-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) or megaprimer mutagenesis (24Sarkar G. Sommer S.S. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 404-407PubMed Google Scholar). Specific details about construction of mutants are available as a supplemental Table. The cin8-1031, -1013, -955, -871, and -ΔN-70 alleles were described previously (19Hildebrandt E.R. Hoyt M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3402-3416Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Mutants were subcloned into the base set of CIN8 plasmids as follows (see also Table 1): pMA1260 and pEH113 were used for in vivo function and dominance studies; pTK138 and pEH172 were used for immunolocalization studies; pTK103 and pTK49 were used for co-immunoprecipitation and hydrodynamic studies. Co-immunoprecipitations—All immunoprecipitations were performed using strain MAY2063 carrying two centromeric plasmids, one encoding an N-terminal 6Myc-tagged Cin8p variant (variants of pTK103) and the other encoding full-length Cin8p with a C-terminal 3HA 3The abbreviations used are: HA, hemagglutinin; 5-FOA, 5-fluoro-orotic acid; NLS, nuclear localization sequence; BSA, bovine serum albumin. tag (pTK167). The “no tag” control strain carried pMA1260 and pTK167. For examining the Δmotor mutant, cells co-expressed full-length 6myc-Cin8p (pTK103) and Δmotor-Cin8p-3HA (pEH73). Each immunoprecipitation used 35 ml of a 100 Klett (mid-log phase) culture grown in synthetic selective media. Extracts were prepared by liquid nitrogen grinding as described for the hydrodynamic studies (see below) except the buffer contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaF, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 μg/ml each antipain, aprotinin, and leupeptin. A small portion of each extract was set aside to check expression levels of the Cin8p mutants. Extracts were diluted 3.5-fold and then clarified by three 10-min microcentrifuge spins at 4 °C. Monoclonal anti-Myc antibody, 9E10 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), was added to 1 μg/ml and incubated for 4 h at 4°C. Protein G-Sepharose beads (Sigma) in buffer containing 0.2 mg/ml BSA were added to a final concentration of 10% v/v and incubation was continued for 1 h. Beads were washed four times in buffer with BSA, resuspended in protein sample buffer, and boiled for analysis by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Hydrodynamic Analysis—To determine the size of Cin8p complexes in crude extracts, a combination of gel filtration and sucrose density gradient centrifugation was used. Cultures were grown in 100 ml of appropriate synthetic media to mid-log phase (100 Klett units). Cells were harvested, resuspended in a small volume of 25% glycerol, and frozen at –80 °C until use. To prepare extracts, cells were washed in TNED buffer (50 mm triethanolamine-NaOH, pH 7.75, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol) supplemented with protease inhibitors (0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine HCl, and 0.5 μg/ml each pepstatin A, antipain, leupeptin, and aprotinin) and resuspended in 0.25 ml of the same buffer. This mixture was frozen dropwise in liquid nitrogen. Cells were disrupted by grinding for 200 strokes under liquid nitrogen using a pre-chilled mortar and pestle. 0.2 ml of additional buffer was added. Cell debris was removed by two 10-min spins in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C followed by 30 min at room temperature in a Beckman Airfuge at 130,000 × g. As a final clarification step, extracts were filtered through 0.2-μm spin filters (U. S. Biologicals). Gel filtration was performed by applying 0.2 ml of clarified extract to a Superose 6 (Amersham Biosciences) column pre-equilibrated with TNED buffer. 0.5-ml fractions were collected and then supplemented with 10 μg of BSA as a control for protein recovery following precipitation with methanol/chloroform (4:1). Protein pellets were resuspended in 1× Sample buffer, and the fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The Stokes radius of Cin8p was determined using the plot of the Stokes radius of standard proteins (chicken muscle myosin, 19.45 nm; thyroglobulin, 8.5 nm; apoferritin, 6.35 nm; β-amylase, 5.4 nm; catalase, 5.22 nm; alcohol dehydrogenase, 4.58 nm; BSA, 3.55 nm; and carbonic anhydrase, 2.01 nm) versus square root (–logKav) and (Kd)1/3 as described previously (25Siegel L.M. Monty K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 112: 346-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1547) Google Scholar). The two methods were then averaged to arrive at an RS value for Cin8p. Briefly, Kav = (Ve – Vo)/(Vt – Vo) and Kd = (Ve – Vo)/(Vm – Vo). Ve is the elution volume of the sample, and Vt is the theoretical total volume of the column plus its tubing. Plasmid DNA and acetone were used to determine the void volume (Vo) and total measured volume (Vm), respectively, of the Superose 6 column. For sucrose gradients and determination of the sedimentation coefficient, extracts were prepared in the same manner as for gel filtration. 0.5 ml of the clarified extract was applied to an 11-ml 5–25% sucrose gradient in TNED buffer. Other ranges of sucrose concentration were also tested in some cases. The gradient was centrifuged in an SW41 rotor at 39,000 rpm for 30 h. Fractions were collected from the bottom of the gradient and concentrated as described above. The sedimentation coefficient of Cin8p was determined by plotting the elution volume versus the sedimentation coefficient of standard proteins (carbonic anhydrase, 3.13 S; BSA 4.43 S; alcohol dehydrogenase 5.5 S; β-amylase 8.9 S, catalase 11.3 S; and apoferritin 17.6 S). The molecular weight of Cin8p complexes was calculated from the Stokes radius (a) and sedimentation coefficient (s) using the formula M = 6π ηNas/(1 – νρ). The constants used were viscosity (η) = 1.002 g m–1 s–1; density of medium (ρ) = 0.9982 g cm–3; partial specific volume of protein (ν) = 0.736 cm3 g–1; and Avogadros number (N). The frictional ratio was calculated using the formula f/f0 = a/(3νM/4π N)1/3. The axial ratio was determined by assuming a prolate ellipsoid shape as described previously (26Cantor C.R. Schimmel P.R. Biophysical Chemistry. W. H. Freeman & Co., San Francisco1980: 539-590Google Scholar). To determine the stoichoimetry of the variants for which an S-value was not measured, we used the plot of RS versus stoichiometric molecular weight (see supplemental figure) for Cin8p forms where the S-value was measured (see Table 3). These data show that there is a linear relationship between RS and Mr for Cin8p tetramers, trimers, dimers, and monomers. The RS value of the remaining Cin8p forms was used to extrapolate a Mr from the graph, and from this a stoichiometry was calculated.TABLE 3Summary of hydrodynamic properties of Cin8p variantsProteinin Vivo functionRSaRS indicates Stokes radius.

Open table in a new tab Functional Analysis of Cin8p—Cin8p consists of an N-terminal motor domain (amino acids 74–513), followed by a 411-amino acid stalk (amino acids 534–945) and a 92-amino acid tail (amino acids 946–1038) at the C terminus (Fig. 1). The stalk contains four regions of heptad repeat sequences predicted by the method of Lupas et al. (27Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3483) Google Scholar) to form α-helical coiled-coil. Other prediction methods revealed similar regions of potential coiled coils, including the C-terminal portion of the stalk for which the method of Wolf et al. (28Wolf E. Kim P.S. Berger B. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1179-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar) indicates a high probability of multimeric coiled coils (not shown). The C-terminal tail harbors a 29-amino acid destruction signal sequence required for APCCdh1-mediated degradation, and an NLS, which contributes to optimal nuclear localization (19Hildebrandt E.R. Hoyt M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3402-3416Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). To assess the importance of the different domains for Cin8p function, we constructed a series of truncated and internally deleted variants. We first assessed the ability of these mutants to function as the sole source of kinesin-5 activity and thus support cell viability. cin8Δ is synthetically lethal with both kip1Δ and dyn1Δ (encodes the heavy chain of dynein) (2Hoyt M.A. He L. Loo K.K. Saunders W.S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 109-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 13Saunders W.S. Koshland D. Eshel D. Gibbons I.R. Hoyt M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 617-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Therefore, we transformed low copy centromeric plasmids carrying CIN8 alleles into two strains, cin8Δ kip1Δ and cin8Δ dyn1Δ. These normally inviable genotypes are supported by a plasmid-borne copy of KIP1 (cin8Δ kip1Δ) or CIN8 (cin8Δ dyn1Δ) that also carried the URA3 gene. These strains can only survive on 5-fluoroorotic acid (5FOA)-containing media if they are transformed with an active CIN8 allele. The cin8 mutants were assayed for their ability to permit loss of the KIP1-URA3 (or CIN8-URA3) plasmid and thus grow on 5FOA. Several truncated forms in which much of the 92-amino acid tail region was removed were still functional (truncated after amino acid 1031, 990, 972, and 969) in both genetic backgrounds (Fig. 2A). Truncated form 1013 that lacks the NLS but has the degradation signal intact supported growth in cin8Δ kip1Δ but not in cin8Δ dyn1Δ. Shorter truncated forms (990, 972, and 969) in which all or part of the destruction signal was removed restored functionality in cin8Δ dyn1Δ. This is probably because greater amounts of the stable mutants are available to get into the nucleus. Truncated form 955, which ends just after coil 4, was not functional as were even shorter C-terminal truncations. Therefore, Cin8p does not require its C-terminal regulatory sequences for biological function. Internal deletions in the tail and stalk revealed that all four predicted coiled-coil regions were essential for function (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, removal of the predicted noncoiled region between coils 1 and 2 (Δ668–745) did not destroy functionality in cin8Δ kip1Δ cells but significantly reduced growth of cin8Δ dyn1Δ cells. On the other hand, the noncoiled region between coils 3 and 4 (842–885) was essential in both backgrounds. In the N-terminal portion of the protein, the highly conserved motor domain and neck regions were essential for function (Δmotor and Δneck). Regions that are not conserved among kinesin-5 family members such as the N-terminal 73 amino acids and a 100 amino acid insertion in the center of the motor domain (2Hoyt M.A. He L. Loo K.K. Saunders W.S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 109-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) were not essential (ΔN-70 and Δmotor-insert, respectively). We tested the nonfunctional alleles of Cin8p for dominant negative effects using a kip1Δ strain. If a mutant form of Cin8p interferes with the endogenous Cin8p activity, it would create a situation that mimics the deleterious cin8Δ kip1Δ genotype. We found three alleles (CIN8–871, Δ872–885, and Δ842–885) that exhibited a strong dominant negative effect at 37 °C (Fig. 2A) and a weaker effect at 26 °C (not shown). Thus, a region including amino acids 872–885 is necessary to prevent this dominant negative effect. Four other mutants (955, 885, 842, and Δcoil4) exhibited weak dominant negative effects when expressed at high copy (data not shown). Immunoblot analysis of tagged versions of the Cin8p mutants revealed that dominant negative effects were not because of differences in expression levels (Fig. 4 and data not shown). Negative growth defects were not observed when these truncated alleles were transformed into cin8Δ KIP1 strains, suggesting that the negative effect depends upon an interaction with the endogenous copy of Cin8p. In support, the cin8-Δcoil1,871 double mutant, missing the region critical for Cin8p-Cin8p interactions (see below) was not dominant negative (Fig. 2B, Δcoil 1,871). The dominant negative effect was also abolished by motor domain mutants combined in cis with the CIN8–871 mutation (e.g. G171E,871; F467A,871, and R394A,H396A,871). These results suggest that the dominant negative alleles interact with endogenous Cin8p and cause aberrant outcomes in a manner that is dependent upon the activity of the catalytic motor domain. Cin8p Spindle Localization Depends upon the C-terminal Tail and Stalk Coil 1—N-terminal 6Myc epitope-tagged versions of select Cin8p mutants were examined for their ability to localize to the mitotic spindle in a cin8Δ genetic background. To enhance the immunofluorescence signal, constructs were expressed from high copy 2-μm plasmids. 6myc-Cin8p could be detected on nuclear spindle microtubules (Fig. 3) as was observed previously for Cin8p tagged with HA at its C terminus (2Hoyt M.A. He L. Loo K.K. Saunders W.S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 109-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Truncating into the C terminus (1031, 990, and 972), and removing the previously identified nuclear localization sequence (C-terminal seven amino acids) led to diffuse cytoplasmic staining with occasional spindle staining (19Hildebrandt E.R. Hoyt M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3402-3416Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) (Table 2).TABLE 2Localization of Cin8p mutants in cin8Δ strainCin8p form6myc-Cin8p6myc-SV40-NLS-Cin8p1038 (wild type)SpindleSpindle1031aData are from Ref. 19.Spindle and cytoplasmbCin8p stainin"
https://openalex.org/W2128921887,"NF-κB-mediated transcriptional activation is controlled at several levels including interaction with coregulatory proteins. To identify new proteins capable of modulating NF-κB-mediated activation, a cytoplasmic two-hybrid screen was performed using the p65 C-terminal transactivation domain as bait and identified the product of the DEK proto-oncogene. DEK is a ubiquitous nuclear protein that has been implicated in several types of cancer and autoimmune diseases. DEK appears to function in several nuclear processes including transcriptional repression and modulation of chromatin structure. Our data indicate that DEK functions as a transcriptional corepressor to repress NF-κB activity. DEK expression blocked p65-mediated activation of an NF-κB-dependent reporter gene and also inhibited TNFα-induced activation of the reporter gene. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays showed that DEK associates with the promoters of the NF-κB-regulated cIAP2 and IL-8 genes in untreated cells and dissociates from these promoters upon NF-κB binding in response to TNFα treatment. Moreover, the expression levels of an NF-κB-dependent reporter gene as well as the NF-κB-regulated Mcp-1 and IκBα genes is increased in DEK–/– cells compared with wild-type cells. ChIP assays on these promoters show enhanced and prolonged binding of p65 and increased recruitment of the P/CAF coactivator. Overall, these data provide further evidence that DEK functions to negatively regulate transcription.

Overall, these data provide further evidence that DEK functions to negatively regulate transcription. NF-κB plays an important role in many cellular processes by regulating the expression of genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses, cell adhesion, cell cycle regulation, angiogenesis, and apoptosis (1Ghosh S. Immunol. Res. 1999; 19: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 2Hayden M.S. Ghosh S. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2195-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (3380) Google Scholar). In mammals the NF-κB family includes five members: RelA (referred to as p65 from here on), c-Rel, and RelB as well as p105 and p100, which are processed into the p50 and p52 subunits, respectively (2Hayden M.S. Ghosh S. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2195-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (3380) Google Scholar, 3Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3300) Google Scholar). Each subunit includes a Rel homology domain (RHD) containing the DNA binding and protein dimerization domains as well as the nuclear localization sequence. In addition, p65, c-Rel, and RelB contain an acidic transactivation domain (TAD) 3The abbreviations used are: TAD, transactivation domain; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay; IL, interleukin; CBP, CREB-binding protein; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; HAT, histone acetyltransferase; HDAC, histone deacetylase; aa, amino acid(s); IFN, interferon; Stat, signal transducer and activator of transcription; AR, androgen receptor; TNF, tumor necrosis factor. at the C terminus. The most well studied and predominant form of NF-κB consists of a heterodimer composed of the p50 and p65 subunits (4Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar). In unstimulated cells most NF-κB resides in the cytoplasm bound by a member of the IκB family of inhibitory proteins (2Hayden M.S. Ghosh S. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2195-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (3380) Google Scholar, 3Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3300) Google Scholar). Upon stimulation, IκB is phosphorylated by the IκB kinase (IKK) complex, which targets IκB for polyubiquination and degradation by the 26 S proteasome, allowing NF-κB to translocate to the nucleus to activate transcription of its target genes (2Hayden M.S. Ghosh S. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2195-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (3380) Google Scholar, 3Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3300) Google Scholar). Upon entry into the nucleus, NF-κB binds to the promoters of its target genes to induce high levels of transcription of these genes. Activation of transcription requires interaction with coactivator proteins, such as those that possess histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity (3Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3300) Google Scholar). HAT enzymes function to facilitate alteration of chromatin structure that allows recruitment of the basal transcription factors and RNA polymerase II to the promoter to initiate transcription. NF-κB interacts with several different HAT enzymes including the CREB-binding protein (CBP) and its homolog, p300 (5Gerritsen M.E. Williams A.J. Neish A.S. Moore S. Shi Y. Collins T. Proc. Natl.

These HDAC proteins function to negatively regulate NF-κB transcriptional activity by deacetylating the N-terminal tails of the core histones as well as by deacetylating the p50 and p65 subunits of NF-κB.

This indicates that negative regulation of NF-κB activity through interaction with transcriptional corepressor proteins plays an important role in the overall control of NF-κB activity. DEK is a 375-amino acid nuclear protein that is ubiquitously expressed in most mammalian cells (17Sitwala K.V. Mor-Vaknin N. Markovitz D.M. Anticancer Res. 2003; 23: 2155-2158PubMed Google Scholar, 18Waldmann T. Scholten I. Kappes F. Hu H.G. Knippers R. Gene (Amst.). 2004; 343: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and was initially identified as a fusion protein with the nucleoporin CAN in a minority of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients (19Fornerod M.

Expression of the dek gene is increased in multiple tumor cell types including bladder cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, glioblastoma, melanoma, and various forms of leukemia (17Sitwala K.V.

Very little is known about the actual function of DEK, however several studies have implicated DEK in transcriptional regulation, regulation of HIV-2 replication (22Fu G.K. Grosveld G. Markovitz D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1811-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), mRNA splicing (23McGarvey T. Rosonina E. McCracken S. Li Q. Arnaout R. Mientjes E. Nickerson J.A. Awrey D. Greenblatt J. Grosveld G. Blencowe B.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 309-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), and chromatin remodeling (24Alexiadis V. Waldmann T. Andersen J. Mann M. Knippers R. Gruss C. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1308-1312PubMed Google Scholar). Much of the recent research on DEK has focused on its role in mediating changes in DNA structure. However, DEK can exist in a complex with the HDAC2 and Daxx transcriptional corepressor proteins (25Hollenbach A.D. McPherson C.J. Mientjes E.J. Iyengar R. Grosveld G. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3319-3330Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicating a role for DEK in regulating transcription. In addition, DEK also can interact with the AP-2α transcription factor to enhance its ability to activate transcription (26Campillos M. Garcia M.A. Valdivieso F. Vazquez J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 1571-1575Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Previously DEK was shown to interact with the pets (peri-ets) site within the HIV-2 promoter and that expression from this promoter is enhanced by disassociation of DEK (22Fu G.K. Grosveld G. Markovitz D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1811-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 27Faulkner N.E. Hilfinger J.M. Markovitz D.M. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25804-25812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). DEK was recently shown to be acetylated by the P/CAF transcriptional coactivator protein within its N terminus resulting in a decreased affinity for DNA and accumulation in interchromatin granule clusters (IGCs) (28Cleary J. Sitwala K.V. Khodadoust M.S. Kwok R.P. Mor-Vaknin N. Cebrat M. Cole P.A. Markovitz D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31760-31767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Based on these results, it was proposed that coactivator-mediated acetylation of DEK displaces DEK from promoters to allow transcriptional activation (28Cleary J. Sitwala K.V. Khodadoust M.S.

We identified DEK as a p65-interacting protein through a cytoplasmic yeast two-hybrid screen utilizing the C-terminal TAD (aa 313–551) of the p65 subunit as the bait protein. Based on this, we sought to determine the potential role of DEK in regulating NF-κB-mediated gene expression. Our data confirm that DEK interacts with the p65 subunit of NF-κB and can repress NF-κB-dependent gene expression in a concentration-dependent manner in transient transfection reporter gene assays. ChIP analysis demonstrates that DEK associates with the NF-κB-regulated IL-8 and cIAP2 promoters in uninduced cells and dissociates in response to TNFα stimulation. In addition, quantitative real time PCR (QRT-PCR) shows that basal expression of the NF-κB-regulated Mcp-1 and IκBα genes is increased in fibroblasts isolated from dek–/– mice relative to cells from wild-type mice. Taken together, these data indicate that DEK can function as a transcriptional corepressor protein to negatively regulate NF-κB-dependent gene expression.

Recombinant human tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) (BIOSOURCE, Camarillo, CA) was used at a final concentration of 10 ng/ml. Transient Transfection/Reporter Gene Assays—Transient transfection/reporter gene assays were performed in 24-well plates with Fugene 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, lysed with M-PER cell lysis buffer (Pierce) and assayed for luciferase activity using a LMax luminometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). All experiments were performed a minimum of three times in triplicate. Data were normalized to total protein assayed. Coimmunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—For coimmunoprecipitations, the cells were lysed in cell lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 85 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40 with protease inhibitors) for 10 min on ice and the intact nuclei/membrane fraction was pelleted by centrifugation at 3,300 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was discarded and the nuclei lysed in nuclear lysis/IP buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 1.0% Triton X-100; 0.5% Nonidet P-40; 10 mm EDTA with protease inhibitors) for 10 min on ice. The soluble nuclear extract was recovered by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 15 min and protein concentration determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. Immunoprecipitations were performed using equal amounts of nuclear extracts with the indicated antibodies and protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnolgy). The immunoprecipitated complexes were washed four times with 500 μl of nuclear lysis/IP buffer and resuspended in 15 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The samples were boiled for 3 min and the proteins separated on a SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore). Membranes were blocked in 1× TBST with 5% milk and probed with the indicated antibodies. Proteins were visualized using either anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase or anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase (Promega) and PicoWest chemiluminescent reagent (Pierce) followed by exposure to film. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assays—ChIP analysis was performed essentially as described (36Mayo M.W. Denlinger C.E. Broad R.M. Yeung F. Reilly E.T. Shi Y. Jones D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18980-18989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Cellular proteins and DNA were cross-linked by adding formaldehyde to the growth medium to a final concentration of 0.1%. Cells were harvested in cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in cell lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 85 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40 with protease inhibitors) on ice for 10 min. Nuclei were recovered by centrifugation at 3,300 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Nuclei were lysed in nuclear lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS with protease inhibitors). Lysates were sonicated using a Sonic Dismembranator, Model 500 (Fisher Scientific) and precleared with protein A-agarose or protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and rabbit or mouse IgG (Sigma). Lysates were then rocked overnight at 4 °C with the immunoprecipitation antibody. Protein A-agarose or protein A/G-agarose were added and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with rocking. Complexes were washed one time in low salt buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl), one time in high salt buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl), and one time in LiCl buffer (0.25 m LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 1mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0) followed by two washes in TE buffer (20 mm Tris and 2 mm EDTA). Washed complexes were eluted with freshly prepared elution buffer (1% SDS and 100 mm NaHCO3) and the Na+ concentration was adjusted to 200 mm by adding NaCl followed by incubation at 65 °C overnight to reverse cross-links. DNA was purified utilizing a PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and one-tenth of the eluate was used to amplify the indicated promoter regions. The primers used for PCR were: IL-8: forward, 5′-GGGCCATCAGTTGCAAATC-3′ and reverse, 5′-TTCCTTCCGGTGGTTTCTTC-3′; cIAP2: forward, 5′-GTGTGTGTGGTTATTACCGC-3′ and reverse, 5′-AGCAAGGACAAGCCCAGTCT-3′; GAPDH: forward, 5′-AGCGCAGGCCTCAAGACCTT-3′ and reverse, 5′-AAGAAGATGCGGCTGACTGT-3′; Mouse IκBα: forward, 5′-CGCTAAGAGGAACAGCCTAG-3′ and reverse, 5′-CAGCTGGCTGAAACATGGC-3′; mouse MCP-1: forward, 5′-CACCCCATTACATCTCTTCCCC-3′ and reverse, 5′-TGTTTCCCTCTCACTTCACTCTGTC-3′. Amplified DNA was visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis using SYBR Gold (Invitrogen/Molecular Probes). Images were captured using a Kodak EAS290 Digital Camera and images were inverted using the software program provided by the manufacturer (Kodak). Isolation of Total Cellular RNA and Real-time PCR—Total cellular RNA was prepared using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) as recommended by the manufacturer. cDNA was generated from 2 μg of total RNA by reverse transcription with AMV reverse transcriptase (Promega) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Two microliters of cDNA was used as the template in a total reaction volume of 25 μl containing final concentrations of 1× iQ SYBR Green Super mix (Bio-Rad) and 600 nm of each forward and reverse primer. Primer sequences were: human cIAP2: forward, 5′-ATG CTT TTG CTG TGA TGG TG-3′ and reverse, 5′-TGA ACT TGA CGG ATG AAC TCC-3′; human IL-8: forward, 5′-CTC TCT TGG CAG CCT TCC T-3′ and reverse, 5′-AAT TTC TGT GTT GGC GCA GT-3′; human β-actin: forward, 5′-AGC ACT GTG TTG GCG TAC AG-3′ and reverse, 5′-GGA CTT CGA GCA AGA GAT GG-3′; mouse IκBα: forward, 5′-CTGCAGGCCACCAACTACAA-3′ and reverse, 5′-CAGCACCCAAAGTCACCAAGT-3′; mouse Mcp-1: forward, 5′-CCACTCACCTGCTGCTACTCAT-3′ and reverse, 5′-TGGTGATCCTCTTGTAGCTCTCC-3′; mouse β-actin: forward, 5′-AGGTGTGCACCTTTTATTGGTCTCAA-3′ and reverse, 5′-TGTATGAAGGTTTGGTCTCCCT-3′. Expression levels were normalized to β-actin and expressed as relative expression. Data were read and collected on the Bio-Rad iCycler. DEK Interacts with the p65 Subunit of NF-κB—A cytoplasmic yeast two-hybrid screen initially identified DEK as a potential protein that can interact with the C-terminal TAD of p65. To confirm the interaction between DEK and p65 HEK293T cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids and immunoprecipitations were performed (from equal amounts of nuclear extracts) with FLAG antibody. As shown in Fig. 1A, lane 1, p65 coimmunoprecipitated with FLAG-DEK from nuclear extracts of cells transfected with both DEK and p65. In addition, a weak but reproducible interaction was observed between the FLAG-DEK and endogenous p65 (Fig. 1A, lane 3). This weak interaction is likely caused by the low basal level of nuclear p65 in uninduced cells and may indicate that DEK inhibits the ability of this nuclear p65 to activate transcription. No nonspecific interactions were observed from control transfected cells (Fig. 1A, lanes 2 and 4), indicating the specificity of the DEK-p65 interaction. The lower panels (Fig. 1A) show the input extracts used for the immunoprecipitation, probed for both p65 (middle panel) and DEK (lower panel). Overall these results suggest that an interaction between p65 and DEK occurs in the nuclei of intact cells. Endogenous DEK and p65 Interact in a TNFα-inducible Manner—To further confirm this interaction, coimmunoprecipitations were performed to demonstrate an interaction between endogenous DEK and endogenous p65. Nuclear extracts from cells that were treated with TNFα for 20 or 120 min (or no TNF) were immunoprecipitated with DEK antibody and the immunoprecipitates analyzed by immunoblotting. In untreated cells, a low level of nuclear p65 coprecipitated with DEK (Fig. 1B, lane 1). In contrast, there was a strong interaction between p65 and DEK detected after a 20-min TNFα treatment (Fig. 1B, lane 2). At the 120-min TNFα treatment, a reduced amount of p65 coprecipitated with DEK despite a similar level of nuclear p65 to the 20 min treatment, (Fig. 1B, lane 3). This decrease is possibly caused by the association of p65 with transcriptional coactivators or with IκBα, both of which may displace DEK. Taken together, the data in Fig. 1 show that DEK and p65 interact and confirm our two-hybrid results. DEK Represses p65-mediated Transcriptional Activation in a Concentration-dependent Manner—To determine the effect of DEK on p65-mediated transcriptional activation, HeLa and HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with an NF-κB-dependent reporter gene plasmid (κB-luc), a p65 expression plasmid (CMV-p65), and increasing concentrations of the DEK expression plasmid (CMV-F-DEK). Cells were harvested 48 h after the transfection and extracts assayed for luciferase activity. In HeLa cells (Fig. 2A, left panel), expression of p65 alone activated transcription of the reporter gene almost 60-fold over the control (Fig. 2A, lane 2 versus lane 1). Cotransfection of 10 ng of the DEK expression plasmid resulted in an almost 50% reduction in p65-mediated activation of reporter gene expression (Fig. 2A, lane 3 versus lane 2). Further increases in the amount of the DEK expression plasmid resulted in a concentration-dependent decrease in p65-mediated transcriptional activation. Cotransfection of 25 ng of the DEK plasmid caused a 70% reduction (Fig. 2A, lane 4 versus lane 2), whereas cotransfection of 50 ng of the DEK plasmid resulted in about 90% reduction in reporter gene activity (lane 5 versus lane 2). Expression of DEK in the absence of p65 (lanes 7 and 8) had no detectable effect on expression of the reporter gene, indicating that DEK directly targets p65. These results suggest that DEK can function as a transcriptional corepressor to inhibit the ability of p65 to activate transcription. Repressive Effect of DEK Is Not Cell Type-specific—Similar experiments were also performed in HEK293T cells to show that the ability of DEK to repress p65-mediated transcription is not cell type-specific. HEK293T cells (Fig. 2A, right panel) were transfected as indicated and assayed for reporter gene activity 48-h post-transfection. Similar to the effects observed in HeLa cells, coexpression of DEK with p65 in HEK293T cells caused a concentration-dependent decrease in p65-mediated activation of reporter gene expression (Fig. 2A, right panel, compare lanes 3–5 with lane 2). These results further demonstrate that DEK is able to repress p65-mediated transcriptional activation and that the effect is not cell type-specific. DEK Represses the Ability of Other Transcription Factors to Activate Transcription—To determine if the ability of DEK to repress transcription is specific to p65 or if DEK is also able to repress the activity of other transcription factors, transient transfection reporter gene assays were performed using reporter genes driven by the androgen receptor (PSA-luc), p53 (p53-luc), and Stat5B (IRF-luc),. These results show that DEK also is able to repress AR-driven PSA-luc reporter gene expression and p53-driven expression of the p53-dependent reporter gene in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2, B and C). In addition, DEK was also able to modestly repress Stat5B-mediated expression of the IRF-luc reporter gene but only at the highest concentration of transfected plasmid (Fig. 2D, lane 5). These data indicate that similar to other transcriptional corepressors, the repressive effect mediated by DEK is more general and not specific to repression of p65-mediated transcription. DEK Represses TNFα-induced NF-κB-dependent Transcriptional Activity—We next wanted to determine whether DEK could repress the ability of endogenous TNFα-induced NF-κB to activate expression of the κB-luc reporter gene. HeLa cells were transfected with the κB-luc reporter gene plasmid and either the vector control p"
https://openalex.org/W2050502393,"The p53 family proteins are transcription factors and have both common and distinct functions. p53 is a classic tumor suppressor, whereas p63 and p73 have fundamental functions in development. To gain an insight into the functional diversities among the p53 family, target genes specifically regulated by p63 and p73 were examined. Here, we found that the GLX2 gene, which encodes glyoxalase II enzyme, is up-regulated by p63 and p73. Accordingly, a specific responsive element was found in intron 1 of the GLX2 gene, which can be activated and bound by p63 and p73. We also found that, upon overexpression, the cytosolic, but not the mitochondrial, GLX2 inhibits the apoptotic response of a cell to methylglyoxal, a by-product of glycolysis. Likewise, we showed that cells deficient in GLX2 are hypersensitive to methylglyoxal-induced apoptosis. Interestingly, a deficiency in GLX2 also enhances the susceptibility of a cell to DNA damage-induced apoptosis in a p53-dependent manner. These observations reveal a novel link between the p53 family and the glyoxalase system. Given that methylglyoxal is frequently generated under both physiological and pathological conditions, we postulate that GLX2 serves as a pro-survival factor of the p53 family and plays a critical role in the normal development and in the pathogenesis of various human diseases, including cancer, diabetes, and neurodegenerative diseases.

Nozell S. Chen X. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 822-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The other two p53 family members, p63 and p73, share considerable structural homology with p53 and can also bind to p53-responsive elements (p53-REs) 2The abbreviations used are: RE, responsive element; GLX1, -2, glyoxalases I and II; MG, methylglyoxal; SLG, S-d-lactoylglutathione; AGE, advanced glycation end product; HA, hemagglutinin; siRNA, small interference RNA; nt, nucleotide(s); ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase.2The abbreviations used are: RE, responsive element; GLX1, -2, glyoxalases I and II; MG, methylglyoxal; SLG, S-d-lactoylglutathione; AGE, advanced glycation end product; HA, hemagglutinin; siRNA, small interference RNA; nt, nucleotide(s); ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. to transactivate some p53 target genes, such as p21, MDM2, FDXR, and POLH (2el-Deiry W.S.

Thus, p63 and p73 appear to have overlapping functions with p53 (1Harms K. Nozell S. Chen X. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 822-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). However, unlike p53 as a classic tumor suppressor, p63 and p73 are rarely mutated in cancer and their roles in tumor suppression remain controversial (6Melino G. De Laurenzi V. Vousden K.H. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 605-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mice deficient in either p63 or p73 exhibit profound developmental defects without increased susceptibility to spontaneous tumor formation (7Mills A.A. Zheng B. Wang X.J. Vogel H. Roop D.R. Bradley A. Nature. 1999; 398: 708-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (1687) Google Scholar, 8Yang A. Walker N. Bronson R. Kaghad M. Oosterwegel M. Bonnin J. Vagner C. Bonnet H. Dikkes P. Sharpe A. McKeon F. Caput D. Nature. 2000; 404: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar). The diverse physiological functions of p63 and p73 suggest that a distinct set of transcriptional targets are regulated by p63 and p73.Glyoxalase II (GLX2), also known as hydroxyacylglutathione hydrolase, together with glyoxalase I (GLX1), constitutes the glyoxalase system (9Thornalley P.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 1343-1348Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The major function of the system is to detoxify α-ketoaldehydes, especially the potent and cytotoxic methylglyoxal (MG) (10Thornalley P.J. Gen. Pharmacol. 1996; 27: 565-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). MG, a by-product of glycolysis, is produced through nonenzymatic phosphate elimination from the glycolytic intermediates, dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. MG is converted to S-d-lactoylglutathione (SLG) by GLX1 with reduced glutathione as a cofactor, and SLG in turn is hydrolyzed to d-lactate along with regeneration of reduced glutathione by GLX2. GLX1, which uses MG as the preferred substrate, is found selectively overexpressed in leukemia cells, and GLX1 inhibitor is shown to be a potential anti-cancer agent (11Sakamoto H. Mashima T. Kizaki A. Dan S. Hashimoto Y. Naito M. Tsuruo T. Blood. 2000; 95: 3214-3218Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of GLX1 is capable of inhibiting the formation of hyperglycemia-induced advanced glycation end products (AGEs) in bovine endothelial cells, indicating that GLX1 has a protective role in diabetic microangiopathy (12Shinohara M. Thornalley P.J. Giardino I. Beisswenger P. Thorpe S.R. Onorato J. Brownlee M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1142-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Recent studies revealed that GLX1 has additional roles in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease and anxiety (13Chen F. Wollmer M.A. Hoerndli F. Munch G. Kuhla B. Rogaev E.I. Tsolaki M. Papassotiropoulos A. Gotz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7687-7692Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 14Hovatta I. Tennant R.S. Helton R. Marr R.A. Singer O. Redwine J.M. Ellison J.A. Schadt E.E. Verma I.M. Lockhart D.J. Barlow C. Nature. 2005; 438: 662-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). All these studies indicate that the glyoxalase system plays an important role in the pathogenesis of various human diseases. However, very little is known about GLX2, including its role in the glyoxalase system and its physiological significance in the stress response.In this study, we showed that GLX2 is a novel target of p63 and p73. We also showed that the cytosolic, but not the mitochondrial, GLX2 protects cells from MG-induced cell death, whereas a deficiency in GLX2 promotes MG-induced cell death. Furthermore, we showed that GLX2 knockdown sensitizes cells to DNA damage-induced apoptosis in a p53-dependent manner, implying that GLX2 has a novel function in the DNA damage response. Taken together, our data reveal a novel link between the p53 family and the glyoxalase system, which plays an important role in the normal development and in the pathogenesis of various human diseases, such as cancer, diabetes and Alzheimer disease.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids—The cDNAs encoding both the cytosolic and mitochondrial GLX2 were generated by reverse transcription-PCR using total RNAs purified from MCF7 cells. The primers used to generate the cytosolic GLX2 were forward primer cGLX2-F (5′-AAGCTTGCCACCATGAAGGTAGAGGTGCTGCCTGCCCTG-3′) and reverse primer GLX2-R (5′-CTCGAGTCAGTCCCGGGGCATCTTGAACTGGTCCTT-3′). The primers used to generate the mitochondrial GLX2 were forward primer mGLX2-F (5′-AAGCTTGCCACCATGGTGGTGGGCCGAGGGCTGCTCGGC-3′) and reverse primer GLX2-R. For inducible expression of GLX2 tagged with hemagglutinin (HA) epitope at the N or C termini, cDNA was cloned into a pcDNA4 tetracycline-inducible expression vector. The cDNA encoding the N-terminally HA-tagged cytosolic GLX2 was amplified with forward primer GLX2-5HA-F (5′-AAGCTTGCCACCATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCTAAGGTAGAGGTGCTGCTGCCCTGACC-3′) and reverse primer GLX2-R. The cDNA encoding the C-terminally HA-tagged cytosolic GLX2 was amplified with forward primer cGLX2-F and reverse primer GLX2-3HA-R (5′-CTCGAGTCAAGCGTAATCTGGAACATCGTATGGGTAGTCCCGGGGCATCTTGAACTGGTCCTT-3′). The cDNA encoding the C-terminally HA-tagged mitochondrial GLX2 was amplified with forward primer mGLX2-F and reverse primer GLX2-3HA-R. All GLX2 cDNA constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing.To generate a construct that expresses a small interfering RNA (siRNA) against GLX2 under the control of the tetracycline-regulated H1 promoter, two oligonucleotides targeting the region of +955 to +975 in the GLX2 transcript (NM_005326) were annealed and cloned into pBabe-H1 at the HindIII and BglII sites, and the resulting construct was designated pBabe-H1-siGLX2. pBabe-H1 is a polymerase III promoter-driven vector with a tetracycline operon sequence inserted before the transcription start site (15van de Wetering M. Oving I. Muncan V. Pon Fong M.T. Brantjes H. van Leenen D. Holstege F.C. Brummelkamp T.R. Agami R. Clevers H. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 609-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). The sequence for sense oligonucleotide (targeting region shown in bold) was 5′-GATCCCCAAGGGACTGCGGATGAGATGTTTCAAGAGAACATCTCATCCGCAGTCCCTTTTTTTGGAAA-3′, and that for antisense oligonucleotide was 5′-AGCTTTTCCAAAAAAAGGGACTGCGGATGAGATGTTCTCTTGAAACATCTCATCCGCAGTCCCTTGGG-3′. The construct that expresses siRNA against p53 was used as described previously (16Liu G. Xia T. Chen X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17557-17565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar).For generation of a luciferase reporter under the control of a potential p53-response element in the GLX2 gene, a 709-bp DNA fragment from intron 1 (nt +3419 to +4127) was amplified from the genomic DNA purified from MCF7 cells with forward primer GAin1 +3419F (5′-AGATCTGCAGGGGGTAGAATGTCGCCAT-3′) and reverse primer GAin1 +4127R (5′-AAGCTTGCAGACACAGAGCACAACTCAGCG-3′). The fragment was confirmed by sequencing and then cloned into a promoterless luciferase reporter vector pGL2 (Promega). The resulting plasmid was designated as pGL2-GLX2(+3419/+4127). Other luciferase reporters were also generated by PCR using pGL2-GLX2(+3419/+4127) as a template. The primers used to generate pGL2-GLX2(+3850/+4127) were forward primer GAin1 +3850F (5′-AGATCTAGCCTGGGCGACAGAGCGAGAC-3′) and reverse primer GAin1 +4127R. The primers used to generate pGL2-GLX2(+3954/+4127) were forward primer GAin1 +3954F (5′-AGATCTAGTCCTCCCATCTCAGTCTCTTA-3′) and reverse primer GAin1 +4127R. The primers used to generate pGL2-GLX2(Δ+3879/+3935) were forward primer GAin1(Δ+3879/+3935)F (5′-TCTAGACTCCTGCCCTCAAGCAGTCCTCCCATC-3′) and reverse primer GAin1(Δ+3879/+3935)R (5′-TCTAGACGGAGTCTCGCTCTGTCGCCCAGGC-3′). The primers used to generate pGL2-GLX2(+3901/+4127) were forward primer GAin1 +3901F (5′-AGATCTAGACAAGGTCTTGCTATGTTGCCCA-3′) and reverse primer GAin1 +4127R. The primers used to generate pGL2-GLX2(+3901/+4127)M2 were forward primer GAin1 +3901M2F (point mutations shown in bold) (5′-AGATCTAGATAAGGTCTTGCTATGTTGCCCAGGATGGTCTCAAACTCCTG-3′) and reverse primer GAin1 +4127R. The primers used to generate pGL2-GLX-2(+3901/+4127)M4 are forward primer GAin1 +3901M4F (5′-AGATCTAGATAATGTCTTGCTATGTTGCCCAGGATGA- TCTCAAACTCCTG-3′) and reverse primer GAin1 +4127R.Cell Culture—MCF7 cell lines, which inducibly express various isoforms of the p53 family proteins, were cultured as described previously (17Helton E.S. Zhu J. Chen X. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2533-2542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 18Nozell S. Wu Y. McNaughton K. Liu G. Willis A. Paik J.C. Chen X. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 4333-4347Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). RKO-GLX2 cell lines, which inducibly express GLX2 under the control of the tetracycline-inducible promoter, were generated as described previously (19Dohn M. Nozell S. Willis A. Chen X. Methods Mol. Biol. 2003; 223: 221-235PubMed Google Scholar). To generate inducible GLX2 knockdown cell lines, pBabe-H1-siGLX2 was transfected into RKO or MCF7 cells in which a tetracycline repressor was expressed by pcDNA6 (5Liu G. Chen X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 1398-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). GLX2 knockdown cell lines were selected with puromycin and confirmed by Western blot analysis. To generate cell lines in which p53 is stably knocked down and GLX2 is inducibly knocked down, pBabe-H1-siGLX2 and pBabe-U6-sip53 were cotransfected into RKO cells and then selected with puromycin; p53 and GLX2 double knockdown RKO cell lines were confirmed by Western blot analysis.Affymetrix GeneChip Assay and Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNAs were isolated from MCF7 cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). U133 plus GeneChip was purchased from Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA), which contains oligonucleotides representing 37,000 unique human transcripts. GeneChip analysis was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Northern blot analysis and preparation of p21 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase probes were as described previously (20Chen X. Bargonetti J. Prives C. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4257-4263PubMed Google Scholar). The GLX2 probe was prepared from an expressed sequence tag clone (GenBank™ BC000840).Luciferase Assay—The dual luciferase assay was performed in triplicate according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Madison, WI). Briefly, 0.25 μg of a luciferase reporter, 0.25 μg of pcDNA3 or pcDNA3 that expresses a p53 family protein, and 5 ng of Renilla luciferase assay vector pRL-CMV (Promega) were cotransfected into H1299 cells. The -fold increase in relative luciferase activity is a product of the luciferase activity induced by a p53 family protein divided by that induced by an empty pcDNA3 vector. The pGL2-p21A luciferase reporter under the control of the two p53-responsive elements in the p21 promoter was used as a positive control (21Nozell S. Chen X. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1285-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—ChIP assay was performed as previously described (22Harms K.L. Chen X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 2014-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). After induction (+) or no induction (-) of p63γ or p73β for 24 h, chromatins in MCF7 cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, and then sonicated to generate 500- to 1000-bp DNA fragments and immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody for p63γ or anti-HA antibody for p73β. After reverse cross-linking and phenol-chloroform extraction, the bound DNA fragments were purified by using a Qiagen column. PCR was performed to visualize the enriched DNA fragments. Primers designed to amplify the region from nt +3779 to +3969 in the GLX2 intron 1 were forward primer (5′-CTGAGACAGGAGAACGGCGTGAACC-3′) and reverse primer (5′-CTGAGATGGGAGGACTGCTTGAGGG-3′). Primers designed to amplify the region from nt -2312 to -2131 in the p21 promoter were forward primer (5′-CAGGCTGTGGCTCTGATTGG-3′) and reverse primer (5′-TTCAGAGTAACAGGCTAAGG-3′).Colony Formation Assay—RKO cells seeded at 300 per well and MCF7 cells seeded at 500 per well in a 6-well plate were incubated in the absence or presence of tetracycline (1.0 μg/ml) for 72 h, then treated with various concentrations of MG for 1 h followed by repetitive wash with phosphate-buffered saline to remove MG. The cells were maintained in fresh medium for next 12-14 days and then stained with crystal violet.Western Blot Analysis—Chicken anti-GLX2 polyclonal IgY antibody was purchased from GenWay Biotech (San Diego, CA). Mouse anti-PARP monoclonal antibody was purchased from BD Pharmingen. Antibodies against p53, p21, HA, and Myc epitopes and actin were described previously (23Zhu J. Zhou W. Jiang J. Chen X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13030-13036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Whole cell extracts were prepared by lysing cells with 2× SDS sample buffer. Proteins were separated on 7-10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with the indicated antibodies followed by ECL detection.DNA Histogram Analysis—Cells were seeded at 2 × 105 per 6-cm plate with or without tetracycline for 72 h, and then treated with MG or a DNA damage agent for various times. Both floating dead cells in the medium and live cells on the plate were collected and fixed with 1 ml of 100% ethanol for at least 30 min. The fixed cells were centrifuged and re-suspended in 0.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline solution containing 50 μg/ml each of RNase A and propidium iodide (Sigma). The stained cells were analyzed in a fluorescence-activated cell sorter within 4 h. The percentages of cells in the sub-G1,G1,S, and G2-M phases were determined using the CellQuest program (BD Biosciences).Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells grown on slides were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 45 min at room temperature and treated with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 5 min, blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h, and stained with anti-HA to detect HA-tagged GLX2 or with chicken anti-GLX2 to detect endogenous GLX2 at room temperature for 1 h. Slides were washed and then incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies against mouse or chicken immunoglobulin G (Jackson ImmunoResearch and Molecular Probes), followed by treatment with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma) to stain nuclei. For MitoTracker (Molecular Probes) staining, cells were incubated in 50 nm MitoTracker for 30 min and then washed with prewarmed growth medium followed by paraformaldehyde fixation.RESULTSIdentification of GLX2 as a Target Gene of p63 and p73—To identify novel target genes regulated by the p53 family, an Affymetrix GeneChip assay was performed. Total RNAs were isolated from MCF7 cells that were uninduced and induced to express p63γ by withdrawal of tetracycline from the culture medium and used to prepare probes for the Affymetrix U133+ GeneChip. We found that GLX2 was highly induced in cells expressing p63γ. To confirm and extend the microarray result, we performed Northern blot analysis and found that GLX2 was highly induced by p63γ and p73β and little if any by p63α, ΔNp63α, ΔNp63γ, and ΔNp73β (Fig. 1A). The level of p21 was examined as a positive control and found to be induced by p63γ and p73β. The level of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was determined as a loading control. We also found that GLX2 was only slightly induced by p53 but not significantly by DNA damage in cells that carry endogenous wild-type p53 (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, consistent with the increase in the mRNA level, Western blot analysis showed that GLX2 protein was significantly induced by p63γ and p73β but little if any by p63α, ΔNp63α, ΔNp63γ, ΔNp73β, wild-type p53, and mutant p53 in MCF7 cells (Fig. 1, C and D). These results suggest that both GLX2 mRNA and protein are preferentially up-regulated by p63γ and p73β but little if any by p53.As members of the p53 family, p63 and p73 are capable of transactivating a promoter that contains a p53-responsive element (p53-RE), RRRC(A/T)(A/T)GYYY, in which R represents purine, whereas Y represents pyrimidine (24el-Deiry W.S. Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1736) Google Scholar). Thus, we searched for and found a potential p53-RE in the first intron (from nt +3901 to +3934) of the GLX2 gene (Fig. 2A). The localization of p53-RE in the intron of a target gene is not unusual, because several well established p53-REs are found in the introns of p53 targets, such as PML and PUMA (25de Stanchina E. Querido E. Narita M. Davuluri R.V. Pandolfi P.P. Ferbeyre G. Lowe S.W. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 523-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 26Nakano K. Vousden K.H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 683-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1854) Google Scholar). To determine whether this potential p53-RE is functional, we cloned the intron fragment as well as several mutant fragments in front of a luciferase reporter (Fig. 2A). We showed that the fragment from nt +3419 to +4127 was highly responsive to p63γ and p73β (Fig. 2, B and C). Similarly, the fragment from nt +3850 to +4127 was also responsive (Fig. 2, B and C). However, the fragment from nt +3954 to +4127 and the internal deletion mutant, Δ+3879/+3935, were only weakly responsive (Fig. 2, B and C), suggesting that the potential p53-RE from nt +3901 to +3934 is necessary. Next, point mutations at the sites predicted to be critical for p53 binding were made in the potential p53-RE. Two nucleotide substitutions, C3904T and C3928A, were made for GLX2-(+3910/+4127)M2, whereas four nucleotide substitutions, C3904T, G3907T, C3928A, and G3931A, were made for GLX2-(+3910/+4127)M4 (Fig. 2A). We found that, like the deletion of the potential p53-RE, mutations also made the p53-RE less responsive to p63 and p73 (Fig. 2, D and E). These data imply that the p53-RE from nt +3901 to +3934 is responsible for p63γ and p73β induction of the GLX2 gene.FIGURE 2GLX2 is a direct target of p63 and p73. A, schematic presentation of the GLX2 genomic locus containing intron 1 and the pGL2 luciferase reporter constructs. A potential p53-responsive element is located between nt +3901 and +3934 in intron 1 of the GLX2 gene. The reporter constructs, +3901/+4127 M2 and +3901/+4127 M4, carry two and four nucleotide substitutions at the critical nucleotides (in bold) in the potential p53-responsive element, respectively. B and C, the potential p53-responsive element in intron 1 is responsive to p63γ and p73β. The luciferase assay was carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures.” D and E, mutations at the critical nucleotides abrogate the potential p53-responsive element in intron 1. F, schematic presentation of the GLX2 intron 1 and p21 promoter with the location of the p53-responsive element and PCR primers used for ChIP assay. G and H, p63γ and p73β bind directly to the p53-responsive element in the GLX2 intron 1 and p21 promoter in vivo.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine whether p63γ and p73β directly bind to the p53-RE in the GLX2 gene in vivo, we performed ChIP assays. The Myc-tagged p63γ-DNA complexes were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody, whereas anti-HA was used as a control. The HA-tagged p73β-DNA complexes were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody, whereas anti-Myc was used as a control. To visualize the enriched DNA fragments, PCR was performed to amplify the region spanning the p53-RE in the GLX2 gene along with the p53-RE1 within the p21 promoter as a positive control with primers shown in Fig. 2F.We found that the captured fragment containing the p53-RE in the GLX2 gene was highly enriched upon inducible expression of p63γ or p73β (Fig. 2, G and H, GLX2 panels). No DNA fragment was enriched by the control antibody (Fig. 2, G and H). As a positive control, the fragment containing the p53-RE1 in the p21 gene was also enriched upon inducible expression of p63γ or p73β (Fig. 2, G and H, p21 panels). Taken together, these data indicate that GLX2 is a direct transcriptional target of p63 and p73.Subcellular Localization of GLX2 Protein—In yeast and higher plants, the cytosolic and mitochondrial isoforms of GLX2 are encoded by two separate genes, whereas in human both isoforms are encoded by the single GLX2 gene (27Cordell P.A. Futers T.S. Grant P.J. Pease R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28653-28661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3A, the human GLX2 gene encodes two isoforms of the protein through alternate translational start sites: the mitochondrial GLX2 translated from the first ATG codon located in exon 1 and the cytosolic GLX2 from the second ATG codon, an internal ribosome entry site in exon 2. To characterize the function of both isoforms, we generated multiple RKO cell lines that inducibly express GLX2 under the control of the tetracycline-inducible promoter. The cytosolic GLX2 was tagged with an HA epitope at either the N or C termini. The mitochondrial GLX2 was tagged with HA only at the C terminus, because an N-terminal HA might interfere with the mitochondrial targeting signal located at the N terminus. One representative clone from each cell line, that is, RKO-GLX2-5HA-3, which inducibly expresses the N-terminally HA-tagged cytosolic GLX2, RKO-GLX2-3HA-16, which inducibly expresses the C-terminally HA-tagged cytosolic GLX2, and RKO-mGLX2-3HA-4, which inducibly expresses the C-terminally HA-tagged mitochondrial GLX2, are shown in Fig. 3B. Next, the intracellular localizations of these GLX2 isoforms were determined by immunofluorescence microscopy. We found that endogenous GLX2 detected by anti-GLX2 was localized primarily in cytosol with some mitochondrial distribution (Fig. 3C, top panel). The HA-tagged cytosolic GLX2 was localized primarily in cytosol (Fig. 3C, second and third panels). However, the C-terminally HA-tagged mitochondrial GLX2 was found to be localized exclusively in mitochondria as it colocalized well with the Mito-Tracker Red (Fig. 3C, fourth panel). Interestingly, the N-terminally HA-tagged GLX2 was localized in cytosol (Fig. 3C, bottom panel), suggesting that the N-terminal HA tag masked the mitochondrial localization signal.FIGURE 3Subcellular localization of GLX2. A, schematic presentation of the human GLX2 genomic locus with exons and two translational start sites. The mitochondrial GLX2 is translated from the first ATG codon in exon 1. The cytosolic GLX2 is translated from the second ATG codon, an internal ribosomal entry site in exon 2. B, generation of RKO cell lines that inducibly express GLX2. Western blots were prepared using extracts from RKO cells that were uninduced (-) or induced (+) to express the N-terminally HA-tagged cytosolic GLX2 (GLX2-5HA), the C-terminally HA-tagged cytosolic GLX2 (GLX2-3HA), or the C-terminally HA-tagged mitochondrial GLX2 (mGLX2-3HA) for 24 h. The blots were analyzed with anti-GLX2 and anti-actin antibodies, respectively. C, subcellular localization of endogenous GLX2 (first panel), the N-terminally HA-tagged cytosolic GLX2 (second panel), the C-terminally HA-tagged cytosolic GLX2 (third panel), the C-terminally HA-tagged mitochondrial GLX2(fourthpanel), and the N-terminally HA-tagged mitochondrial GLX2(bottom panel)in RKO cells. Endogenous GLX2 was detected by anti-GLX2 antibody (GenWay Biotech, San Diego, CA), and HA-tagged GLX2 was detected by anti-HA antibody. Immunofluorescence microscopy was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” GLX2 is stained as green, nuclei as blue (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole), and mitochondria as red (MitoTracker).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The Cytosolic GLX2 Protects Cells from MG-induced Cell Death—MG is the preferred substrate of GLX1, and the product of GLX1 enzymatic reaction, SLG, is the substrate for GLX2. Currently, it is not clear whether GLX2 may impact on the detoxification process of MG, and even less is known about which isoform is active in the MG detoxification pathway. Thus, we performed a colony formation assay to determine the effect of GLX2 on MG-induced growth inhibition (Fig. 4A). For cells without MG treatment, GLX2 overexpression had little effect on cell proliferation (Fig. 4A, control panel). Following MG treatment, most cells died as only a few colonies formed (Fig. 4A, bottom panel, no GLX2 expression). Upon induction of GLX2, the number of colonies was substantially higher than the group without GLX2 expression, regardless of GLX2 that was tagged with HA at its N or C termini (Fig. 4A, bottom panel and first and second columns). In contrast, there was no difference in colony formation between control cells and cells induced to express the mitochondrial GLX2 (Fig. 4A, bottom panel and third column). These data indicate that the cytosolic but not mitochondrial GLX2 confers cell resistance to MG-induced growth inhibition.FIGURE 4Overexpression of the cytosolic GLX2 inhibits MG-induced cell death.

https://openalex.org/W2059775619,"To characterize the mechanisms underlying apoptosis induced by viral infection, transcriptional activation of genes encoding members of the 'BH3-only' family of proteins was analysed during the course of virus infection. Among these genes, only NOXA is transcriptionally activated by vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), sendai virus (SV), measles virus, herpes simplex virus, or dsRNA and required for efficient apoptosis of cells. Transcriptional activation of NOXA by VSV or SV is independent of p53, but requires the presence of interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1), IRF-3 and cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB). Binding to and transactivation of the NOXA promoter by each of these transcription factors is governed by post-translational modification involving different pathways for each factor. Thus, SV infection activates IRF-3 and CREB by phosphorylation triggered by Toll like receptor 3 signalling, and a pathway involving calcium-independent phopholipase A2, respectively. In addition transactivation induced by IRF-1 during viral infection correlates with a 10 kDa increase in its molecular weight, suggesting a covalent linkage with a previously unknown regulatory polypeptide."
https://openalex.org/W2064300963,"Ubiquitin (Ub)-fold proteins are rapidly emerging as an important class of eukaryotic modifiers, which often exert their influence by post-translational addition to other intracellular proteins. Despite assuming a common β-grasp three-dimensional structure, their functions are highly diverse because of distinct surface features and targets and include tagging proteins for selective breakdown, nuclear import, autophagic recycling, vesicular trafficking, polarized morphogenesis, and the stress response. Here we describe a novel family of Membrane-anchored Ub-fold (MUB) proteins that are present in animals, filamentous fungi, and plants. Extending from the C terminus of the Ub-fold is typically a cysteine-containing C<i>AAX</i> (where <i>A</i> indicates aliphatic amino acid) sequence that can direct the attachment of either a 15-carbon farnesyl or a 20-carbon geranylgeranyl moiety <i>in vitro</i>. Modified forms of several MUBs were detected in transgenic <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, suggesting that these MUBs are prenylated <i>in vivo</i>. Both cell fractionation and confocal microscopic analyses of <i>Arabidopsis</i> plants expressing GFP-MUB fusions showed that the modified forms are membrane-anchored with a significant enrichment on the plasma membrane. This plasma membrane location was blocked <i>in vivo</i> in prenyltransferase mutants and by mevinolin, which inhibits the synthesis of prenyl groups. In addition to the five MUBs with C<i>AAX</i> boxes, <i>Arabidopsis</i> has one MUB variant with a cysteine-rich C terminus distinct from the C<i>AAX</i> box that is also membrane-anchored, possibly through the attachment of a long chain acyl group. Although the physiological role(s) of MUBs remain unknown, the discovery of these prenylated forms further expands the diversity and potential functions of Ub-fold proteins in eukaryotic biology."

https://openalex.org/W2005825424,"In Erwinia chrysanthemi production of pectic enzymes is controlled by a complex network involving several regulators. Among them is ExpR, the quorum-sensing regulatory protein. ExpR is a member of the LuxR family of transcriptional regulators, the activity of which is modulated by the binding of diffusible N-acylhomoserine lactone pheromones to the N-terminal receptor site of the proteins. Previous in vitro DNA-ExpR binding studies suggested that ExpR might activate pectic enzyme production and repress its cognate gene expression. This report presents genetic evidence that ExpR represses its own gene expression in the absence of pheromone and that the addition of pheromone promotes concentration-dependent de-repression. In vitro experiments show that (i) ExpR binds target DNA in the absence of pheromone and that the pheromone dissociates ExpR-DNA complexes, (ii) ExpR binds target DNA in a non-cooperative fashion, and (iii) two molecules of pheromone are bound per molecule of ExpR dimer. In the absence of N-(3-oxo-hexanoyl)-homoserine lactone, ExpR prevents RNA polymerase access to the expR promoter, thereby directly repressing transcription initiation. The presence of pheromone renders the expR promoter accessible to RNA polymerase and results in the de-repression of transcription initiation. Overall we have established that there is a direct modulation of the repressive activity of a LuxR family regulator by a pheromone. Furthermore, site-directed mutagenesis experiments strongly suggest that the ExpR residues Leu-19, Tyr-31, and Ser-125 are involved in the transduction of conformational changes induced by ligand binding, and this provides new insights into the structure-function relationship of this bacterial regulator family.

Many proteobacteria appear to use chemical signals to regulate various physiological processes, including virulence, secondary metabolism, and bioluminescence, in response to fluctuations in cell population density (1Fuqua C.

Quorum sensing requires the release of diffusible signal molecules, mainly N-acyl homoserine lactones (acyl-HSLs), 3The abbreviations used are: acyl-HSL, N-acyl homoserine lactone; OHHL, N-(3-oxo-hexanoyl)-homoserine lactone; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; EDC, l-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide; RNAP, RNA polymerase. produced by proteins that resemble LuxI. When the signal molecules reach a certain threshold level, they are detected by regulators that resemble LuxR. Although a few LuxR-type proteins act as repressors, most characterized members of this family are transcriptional activators, including LuxR (3Fuqua C. Greenberg E.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 685-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar, 4Pappas K.M. Weingart C.L. Winans S.C. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 755-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In pathogenic bacteria, it is assumed that quorum sensing is used as a strategy to mount a sustained attack on the host only when their numbers are high enough to ensure that they have a reasonable chance of success. The enterobacteria Erwinia chrysanthemi and other soft-rot Erwinia species can infect a wide range of economically important crops causing soft-rot diseases. Plant tissue maceration by the soft rot Erwinia spp. is because of the disintegration of the plant cell wall by extracellular enzymes, among which pectinases play a predominant role (5Barras F. Van Gijsegem F. Chatterjee A.K. Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 1994; 32: 201-234Crossref Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 6Hugouvieux-Cotte-Pattat N. Condemine G. Nasser W. Reverchon S. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1996; 50: 213-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). In E. chrysanthemi, the production of pectic enzymes is modulated by a complex network involving several regulatory proteins (7Surgey N. Robert-Baudouy J. Condemine G. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1593-1599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Nasser W. Robert-Baudouy J. Reverchon S. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 1071-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 9Nomura K.

Microbiol. 2002; 43: 733-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 11Reverchon S. Bouillant M.L. Salmond G. Nasser W. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1407-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Among them is the ExpR protein, a member of the LuxR family of transcriptional regulators. The expR gene is transcribed convergently to expI, which is responsible for the synthesis of N-(3-oxo-hexanoyl)-homoserine lactone (OHHL) and N-hexanoyl-homoserine lactone (12Nasser W. Bouillant M.L. Salmond G. Reverchon S. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1391-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Of these two pheromones, OHHL is the most abundant and was, thus, postulated to be the most physiologically important quorum sensing signal (12Nasser W. Bouillant M.L. Salmond G. Reverchon S. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1391-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Disruption of the signal synthase gene, expI, results in a decrease of some pectinase gene expression. Although no clear phenotype was associated with a mutation in expR, in vitro gel shift and DNase I footprinting experiments have revealed that ExpR binds specifically to the promoter region of the genes encoding the main pectinases and that the addition of OHHL modified the ExpR-DNA band-shift profiles. These results suggest an involvement of ExpR in the regulation of the virulence gene expression dependent on the OHHL concentration (12Nasser W. Bouillant M.L. Salmond G. Reverchon S. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1391-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). ExpR also specifically interacts with the regulatory region of expI and with that of its own gene. Of all the genes on which it binds, ExpR displays the greatest affinity for the expR regulatory region, which encompasses a well conserved lux box-like sequence. Moreover, the position of the binding site on the expR promoter corresponds with repressor activity (11Reverchon S. Bouillant M.L. Salmond G. Nasser W. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1407-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 12Nasser W. Bouillant M.L. Salmond G. Reverchon S. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1391-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), whereas the position of the binding site of the regulator on the pectinase and expI genes is in accordance with an activator function. LuxR members belong to the large UhpA/FixJ/LuxR family of transcriptional regulators in which the activity of C-terminal, DNA binding domains is modulated through modifications of their N-terminal domains. The events that trigger the regulatory switch at the receiver domain take many forms, including covalent modification (e.g. phosphorylation of NarL and FixJ) or binding of a signaling molecule (e.g. OHHL to LuxR) (13Pao G.M. Tam R. Lipschitz L.S. Saier Jr., M.H. Res. Microbiol. 1994; 145: 356-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 14Ducros V.M. Lewis R.J. Verma C.S. Dodson E.J. Leonard G. Turkenburg J.P. Murshudov G.N. Wilkinson A.J. Brannigan J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 759-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). These signaling events usually lead to multimerization of the regulator essentially mediated by the N-terminal domain. Extensive studies, mainly conducted on LuxR from V. fischeri and TraR from Agrobacterium tumefaciens, CarR from Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora, and on LasR and RhlR from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, have resulted in the accumulation of a large set of data on the structure-function relationship of the activators of the LuxR protein family (4Pappas K.M. Weingart C.L. Winans S.C. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 755-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 15White C.E. Winans S.C. Mol.

Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 4912-4919Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In the case of LuxR, TraR, LasR, and RhlR, autoinducer was shown to be required for multimerization and for activation of target gene expression. TraR was recently crystallized as a complex with its cognate autoinducer and its DNA binding site (20Vannini A. Volpari C. Gargioli C. Muraglia E. Cortese R. De Francesco R. Neddermann P. Marco S.D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4393-4401Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 21Zhang R.G. Pappas T. Brace J.L. Miller P.C. Oulmassov T. Molyneaux J.M. Anderson J.C. Bashkin J.K. Winans S.C. Joachimiak A. Nature. 2002; 417: 971-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). These crystal structures are the first obtained for a quorum-sensing regulator, and they revealed TraR as a dimer with the N-terminal part of each monomer binding to its pheromone and the C-terminal domain of each monomer binding to DNA. Although the N-terminal domains are sufficient for dimer formation, the C-terminal parts also have a dimerization interface although it is less extensive. CarR can exist as a stable preformed dimer able to specifically interact with its DNA binding site in the absence of pheromone. Pheromone binding causes the dimers to form higher order multimers, and this results in activation of target gene expression (22Welch M. Todd D.E. Whitehead N.A. McGowan S.J. Bycroft B.W. Salmond G.P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 631-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Thus, the structural modifications induced by ligand binding on the activators of the LuxR family appear to be varied. Finally, site-directed mutagenesis experiments led to the identification of residues involved in ligand binding and in dimerization in the regulators LuxR, TraR, LasR, and RhlR as well as in the interaction with RNA polymerase for TraR and LuxR (15White C.E. Winans S.C. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 55: 1473-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 23Stevens A.M. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Greenberg E.P. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4704-4707Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Finney A.H. Blick R.J. Murakami K. Ishihama A. Stevens A.M. J.

It is, however, important to note that the precise mechanism used by most of the activators of the LuxR family to regulate target gene expression still needs to be elucidated. Indeed, except for LuxR and for TraR (26Urbanowski M.L. Lostroh C.P. Greenberg E.P. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 631-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 27Zhu J. Winans S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4832-4837Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), no direct evidence of the effect of the activators on RNA polymerase activity has been shown. Among the repressor members of the LuxR family, apart from the studies mentioned above performed with the E. chrysanthemi ExpR protein, only EsaR from Pantoea stewartii ssp. Stewartii has been biochemically characterized. EsaR exists as a dimer and binds the target promoter in the absence of its ligand, whereas the presence of the ligand alters the binding characteristics of EsaR and results in a de-repression of target gene expression (28Minogue T.D. Wehland-von Trebra M. Bernhard F. von Bodman S.B. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 1625-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). However, as for most of the quorum sensing activators, no direct evidence of EsaR action on the RNAP activity was found. The present study focuses on a well conserved lux box-like sequence, the expR box associated with the expR gene, to provide a fuller understanding of the nature of the molecular mechanism used by ExpR to direct the control of gene expression in E. chrysanthemi. We used in vivo gene fusion quantification and in vitro experiments, including DNase I and potassium permanganate footprinting as well as transcription, to explore whether ExpR is a direct repressor of quorum-sensing. Moreover, we characterized the influence of selected amino acid substitutions on the transcriptional activity of ExpR. Based on this, we propose a model for the initiation of structural modifications induced by the ligand binding in the N-terminal domain. Bacterial Strains, Media, and Chemicals—Bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1. Escherichia coli cells were grown at 30 or 37 °C in LB medium (29Miller J.H. Experiment in Molecular Genetics.

Synthetic preparation of OHHL was provided by the Laboratoire de Chimie Organique (Institut National des Sciences Appliquées de Lyon, France) and was produced as previously described (30Reverchon S.

The resulting 800-bp NdeI-EcoRI restriction fragment PCR product was cloned into the pET20b(+) vector (Novagen) to generate pSC3008. In the resulting plasmid pSC3008, the expR gene was placed under the control of the T7 RNA promoter.TABLE 2OligonucleotidesExpRdeb5′-GGAATCCATATGTCTATATCATTCTCTAACG-3′ExpRfin5′-GGAATTCTTACGACCTTGCCTTTGCTGGTCC-3′ExpRLeu19Ala5′-CAATAGCACAATACAATCATATGCTAACAGAAAG TATTTGATCATGAAC-3′ExpRTyr31Ala5′-GTTGTTAAAAAGCTATGGCGACCCCAAGGCCGCC TATTTGATCATGAAC-3′ExpRTyr31Trp5′-GAAAGTTAAAAAGCTATGGGGATCCCAAGTGGGC CTATTTGATCATGAAC-3′ExpRSer125Ala5′-GGGTAACAACCTGGCCGCGCTAGCTTTTATGATT GAAGAGCAC-3′ExpRSer125Thr5′-GGGTAACAACCTGGCCGCGTTAACTTTTATGATT GAAGAGCAC-3′RRexpR(EcoRI)5′-GGAATTCCATTCATCCACCGTCGCTG-3′RRexpR(BamHI)5′-CGGGATCCGATAACGTTAGAGATTGATATAG-3′uidAdeb5′-CTGGTCAACCTTTAATCTG-3′bla3B45′CAGGAAGGCAAAATGCCGC-3′ Open table in a new tab The 366-bp EcoRI-BamHI PCR fragment of the expR regulatory region (RRexpR) was amplified with the oligonucleotides RRexpR(EcoRI) and RRexpR(BamHI) (Table 2), digested by the enzymes EcoRI and BamHI and then inserted into the low copy number plasmid pFZY1 (31Koop A.H. Hartley M.E. Bourgeois S. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 52: 245-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) digested by the same enzymes. The resulting plasmid pSC2908 contains the RRexpR::lacZ reporter fusion. Plasmid pSC2912, which contains the expR coding sequence under the control of the l-(+)-arabinose-inducible PBAD promoter, was constructed as follows: The XbaI-HindIII expR coding sequence fragment from pSC3008 was cloned into pBAD33 that contains the PBAD promoter of the araBAD (arabinose) operon and the gene encoding the regulator of this promoter, araC (32Guzman L.M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3978) Google Scholar). Then, the 2.1-kilobase ClaI-HindIII araC-PBAD-expR fragment of the resulting plasmid was cloned into the low copy number plasmid pWSK29 (33Wang R.F. Kushner S.R. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 100: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar). The 2.1-kilobase ApaI-PstI araC-PBAD-expR fragment of the resulting plasmid was further cloned into the kanamycin resistant low copy number plasmid pWSK129 (33Wang R.F. Kushner S.R. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 100: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar). Plasmids pSC3207, pSC3209, pSC3211, pSC3216, and pSC3239 containing, respectively, expR-L19A, expR-Y31A, expR-Y31W, expR-S125A, and expR- S125T genes were generated in the same way. Site-directed Mutagenesis—The single mutations L19A, Y31A, Y31W, S125A, and S125T were introduced into ExpR by site-directed mutagenesis with the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) to create the plasmids pSC3119, pSC3120, pSC3121, pSC3124, and pSC3125, respectively. The primers ExpRLeu19Ala and ExpRLeu19Alarev, ExpRTyr31Ala and ExpRTyr31Alarev, ExpRTyr31Trp and ExpRTyr31Trprev, ExpRSer125Ala and ExpRSer125Alarev, and ExpRSer125Thr and ExpRSer125Thrrev were used to generate L19A, Y31A, Y31W, S125A and S125T, respectively. Plasmid pSC3008 was used as the template for the PCR. Sequences of oligonucleotides are given in Table 2 (mutated codons are in bold). The five amino acid substitutions L19A, Y31A, Y31W, S125A, and S125T led to the creation of a new restriction site NdeI, StyI, BamHI, NheI, and HpaI, respectively. These restriction sites were used to select the plasmids containing the mutations, which were further confirmed by DNA sequencing (Genome Express, Grenoble, France). β-Galactosidase Determinations—β-Galactosidase activity was measured on toluene-treated cell extracts by following the degradation of o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactoside in o-nitrophenol that absorbs at 420 nm (29Miller J.H. Experiment in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York1972: 431-435Google Scholar). Specific activity is expressed as nmol of products liberated min-1 mg-1 (dry weight bacteria). Repetition of the experiments is indicated. Overexpression and Purification of the ExpR Protein—Overproduction of the native ExpR and its derivative mutants was carried out in E. coli BL21(DE3)/pLysS (34Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6006) Google Scholar). Purification of the ExpR protein was achieved from cells grown at 25 °C in LB medium containing ampicillin and chloramphenicol to maintain both pSC3008 and pLysS. When the optical density at 600 nm reached 0.6, isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 200 μm to induce T7 RNA polymerase synthesis. Then the cells were grown for an additional 2 h at 25 °C. The overproduced proteins were purified as described previously (12Nasser W. Bouillant M.L. Salmond G. Reverchon S. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1391-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In Vitro DNA-Protein Interaction—The E. chrysanthemi expR regulatory region (RRexpR) was recovered from plasmid pSR2211 (11Reverchon S. Bouillant M.L. Salmond G. Nasser W. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1407-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) by XbaI-HincII double digestion. The RRexpR DNA fragment obtained was further end labeled by filling up the XbaI extremity in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) and the klenow fragment of DNA polymerase. The labeled DNA fragment was purified after electrophoresis on agarose gel using the Qiagen gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). 10,000 (0.0075 pmol) to 100,000 cpm (0.075 pmol) of the labeled probes were used for band-shift assays, as described previously (12Nasser W. Bouillant M.L. Salmond G. Reverchon S. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1391-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), and apparent dissociation constants (Kd) were determined, also as described earlier (8Nasser W. Robert-Baudouy J. Reverchon S. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 1071-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The signals obtained were detected by autoradiography on Amersham Biosciences Mp film and quantified using Image-Master TotalLab version 2.01 software (Amersham Biosciences). DNase I footprinting experiments were conducted as previously described except that Nonidet P-40 (Roche Applied Science) was added to a final concentration of 0.1% (v/v) in the binding buffer (12Nasser W. Bouillant M.L. Salmond G. Reverchon S. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1391-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Potassium Permanganate Reactivity Assay—The reactions for the potassium permanganate (KMnO4) reactivity assay were performed with supercoiled template. The expR regulatory region from pSR2681 (750 ng) and the proteins, as indicated, were incubated in 100 μl of a buffer containing 4 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 12 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.2 mm EDTA, 150 mm KCl, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 (Roche Applied Science). After incubation at 30 °C for 15 min, 0.1 volume of 100 mm KMnO4 solution was added for 15 s to the reaction mixtures containing DNA and proteins. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 0.1 volume of 14 m β-mercaptoethanol, 40 μg of glycogen (Roche Applied Science), and sodium acetate to 0.3 m, precipitated with 3 volumes of ice-cold ethanol, and washed twice with 70% ethanol. The reaction products were solubilized in water and divided into equal parts. Both parts were used as a template for five cycles of amplification by Taq polymerase with the 5′ radiolabeled uidAdeb primer or bla3B4 primer (Table 2) to reveal the modified bases at the expR and bla promoters, respectively. The amplification products were analyzed on a 6% sequencing gel. The signals obtained were detected using Cyclone phosphor screen (Packard Instrument Co.). The amount of the expR transcript produced was quantified and normalized to that of bla (for each template, the signal obtained at the expR promoter was divided by that obtained at the bla promoter). σ70RNA polymerase was from Amersham Biosciences, and the protein molarity was determined based on the concentration of the batches (μg/μl). In Vitro Transcription—Supercoiled plasmid pSR2681 containing the XbaI-SalI fragment of the expR regulatory region of pSR2211 was used for in vitro transcription and primer extension reactions according to Lazarus and Travers (35Lazarus L.R. Travers A.A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2483-2494Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The mRNA obtained after in vitro transcription was divided into equal parts and used for primer extension by reverse transcriptase (Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase, RNase H minus, Invitrogen) with radioactively end-labeled primers uidAdeb for expR mRNA and bla3B4 for the bla transcript (Table 2). The extension with primers uidAdeb and bla3B4 yields 140- and 100-bp fragments, respectively. The amount of the expR transcript produced was quantified and normalized to that of bla. Chemical Cross-linking—Chemical cross-linking was performed in 30-μl reaction mixtures containing 20 mm MES, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDC (Calbiochem), 200 μm OHHL or an equivalent volume of water and purified ExpR (as a control) or clear cell lysates of ExpR wild-type or mutant forms ExpR-L19A (L19A), ExpR-Y31A (Y31A), ExpR-Y31W (Y31W) ExpR-S125A (S125A), and ExpR-S125T (S125T) (1 μm dimer). After a 1-h incubation at 25 °C, the reactions were stopped in an adequate volume of Laemmli sample buffer. The samples were further heated at 95 °C for 5 min, and then 20 μl were subjected to electrophoresis on a 12% polyacrylamide gel. Western blots of the separated proteins were incubated with a polyclonal anti-ExpR antibody as the primary antibody and an antirabbit peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Sigma) as the secondary antibody. ExpR Regulatory Activity Is Modulated in Vivo by the OHHL Pheromone—In a previous paper we showed that in the presence of the quorum-sensing pheromone OHHL the purified E. chrysanthemi ExpR protein specifically interacts in vitro with the regulatory region of various genes, including the pelA-D, expI, and expR genes. By contrast, in the absence of the pheromone, only a specific interaction with expR was observed in DNase I footprinting experiments (11Reverchon S. Bouillant M.L. Salmond G. Nasser W. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1407-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 12Nasser W. Bouillant M.L. Salmond G. Reverchon S. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1391-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). This last observation was correlated with the fact that ExpR displays the strongest affinity for its cognate gene. Because one of the main objectives of this study is to elucidate the modulation of ExpR activity by OHHL, we retained the expR gene as a model target DNA. Binding of ExpR on its cognate gene results in the protection of a 36-bp region that includes the 18-bp predicted expR box. Because the protected region overlaps the expR promoters, it was suggested that ExpR negatively regulates its own gene transcription (11Reverchon S. Bouillant M.L. Salmond G. Nasser W. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1407-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). However, this assertion had not been supported by experimental results. To begin to investigate the control mechanism of ExpR on the expR gene, we constructed a low copy number plasmid-based reporter system. In this system the regulatory region of expR (RRexpR) was inserted into the plasmid pFZY1 (31Koop A.H. Hartley M.E. Bourgeois S. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 52: 245-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) upstream of the coding region of lacZ to generate an RRexpR::lacZ transcriptional fusion in the resulting plasmid pSC2908. In addition, the expR coding sequence was cloned in a second compatible low copy number plasmid, pWSK129, under the control of the l-(+)-arabinose-inducible-PBAD promoter to generate plasmid pSC2912. The AraC protein directing the PBAD promoter regulation by arabinose is also encoded on pSC2912. The l-(+)-arabinose-inducible production of ExpR by pSC2912 was assessed by Western blot analysis, which revealed a high level synthesis of the protein only in the presence of the inducer (Fig. 1A).

https://openalex.org/W2036742255,"Bone degradation by osteoclasts depends upon active transport of hydrogen ions to solubilize bone mineral. This transport is supported by the parallel actions of a proton ATPase and a chloride channel located in the osteoclast ruffled membrane. We have previously identified a novel chloride channel, p62, which appears to be the avian counterpart to CLIC-5b and is expressed coincident with the appearance of acid secretion as avian osteoclasts differentiate in culture. In this article, we show that suppression of CLIC-5b in differentiating avian osteoclasts results in decreased acidification by vesicles derived from these cells and decreased ability of the cells to resorb bone. Acidification is rescued by the presence of valinomycin, consistent with a selective loss of chloride channel but not proton pump activity. Osteoclast bone resorption is known to be dependent on the expression of the tyrosine kinase, c-Src. We show that CLIC-5b from osteoclasts has affinity for both Src SH2 and SH3 domains. We find that suppression of expression of Src in developing osteoclasts results in decreased vesicular acidification, which is rescued by valinomycin, consistent with the loss of chloride conductance in the proton pump-containing vesicles. Suppression of c-Src causes no change in the steady state level of CLIC-5b expression, but does result in failure of proton pump and CLIC-5b to colocalize in cultured osteoclast precursors. We conclude that suppression of c-Src interferes with osteoclast bone resorption by disrupting functional co-localization of proton pump and CLIC-5b.

Skeleton integrity requires that osteoclast-mediated bone resorption be intact and regulated (1Blair H.C. Zaidi M. Schlesinger P.H. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 329-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Osteoclasts can remodel bone because these multinucleated cells secret sufficient acid into the resorption compartment to solubilize bone mineral (2Teitelbaum S.L.

The resorption compartment is delineated by a circumferential tightly adherent sealing zone (6Väänänen H.K. Zhao H. Mulari M. Halleen J.M. J. Cell Science. 2000; 113: 377-381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The osteoclast plasma membrane enclosed within the sealing zone differentiates into a highly specialized structure, the ruffled border. Across this membrane the cell actively transports HCl, which dissolves bone mineral and activates acid hydrolases required for bone resorption (7Baron R. Neff L. Louvard D. Courtnoy P.

Chloride ions follow passively through a parallel chloride conductance, short circuiting the electrogenic pump and allowing the massive HCl secretion necessary during bone resorption (10Blair H.C.

Schlesinger P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 171: 920-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This protein is antigenically related to bovine CLIC-5b, a chloride channel of bovine kidney microsomal membranes (14Edwards J. Tulk B. Schlesinger P. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 163: 119-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Expression of avian p62 in differentiating avian osteoclasts is coincident with the appearance of outwardly rectifying chloride conductance, valinomycin-independent acidification, and the ability of cells to resorb bone (15Schlesinger P. Blair H. Teitelbaum S. Edwards J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18636-18643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), all consistent with the hypothesis that p62 is the ruffled border chloride channel.Recently, a second protein, ClC-7, has been demonstrated to be important in bone resorption and proposed as being responsible for the ruffled border chloride conductance (16Kornak U. Kasper D. Bosl M. Kaiser E. Schweizer M. Schulz A. Friedrich W. Delling G. Jentsch T.J. Cell. 2001; 104: 205-215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). ClC-7 is a member of the ClC family of proteins, several members of which are well known to function as plasma membrane chloride channels in a variety of cell types (17Jentsch T.J. Stein V. Weinreich F. Zdebik A.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 503-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). The ClC channels are completely unrelated to the p64/CLIC family of proteins. Osteoclasts of animals in which ClC-7 was suppressed were abnormally elongated, had rudimentary ruffled borders and failed to resorb bone. Taken together, these data strongly support the identification of ClC-7 as a necessary component of the ruffled border acidification mechanism.Osteopetrosis results when osteoclasts are underperforming. Defects in osteoclast differentiation yield animals with dramatic dysfunction in the metabolism of bone including osteopetrosis (18Kong Y.Y. Yoshida H. Sarosi I. Tan H.L. Timms E. Capparelli C. Morony S. Santos A. Van G. Itie A. Khoo W. Wakeham A. Dunstan C.R. Lacey D.L. Mak T.W. Boyle W.J. Penninger J.M. Nature. 1999; 397: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (2834) Google Scholar, 19Yoshida H.

Many (∼50%) of the patients with malignant osteopetrosis have a defective proton pump (20Sobacchi C. Frattini A. Orchard P. Porras O. Tezcan I. Andolina M. Babul-Hirji R. Baric I. Canham N. Chitayat D. Dupuis-Girod S. Ellis I. Etzioni A. Fasth A. Fisher A. Gerritsen B. Gulino V. Horwitz E. Klamroth V. Lanino E. Mirolo M. Musio A. Matthijs G. Nonomaya S. Notarangelo L.D. Ochs H.D.

A mild form of osteopetrosis has been associated with mutations in the chloride channel ClC-7 (16Kornak U. Kasper D. Bosl M. Kaiser E. Schweizer M. Schulz A. Friedrich W. Delling G. Jentsch T.J. Cell. 2001; 104: 205-215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). Studies on CD14 cells differentiated from patients with osteopetrosis indicated that biallelic mutations in ClC-7 produced acidic resorption compartments but were impaired in the removal of organic matrix (21Blair H.C. Borysenko C.W. Villa A. Schlesinger P.H. Kalla S.E. Yaroslavskiy B.B. Garcia-Palacios V. Oakley J.I. Orchard P.J. J. Bone Min. Res. 2004; 19: 1329-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The ability of these cells to acidify the resorption compartment suggests that ClC-7 may play a role other than serving as the shunt chloride channel necessary for robust acidification.In addition to the proton pump and putative channel proteins, c-Src, the non-receptor-tyrosine kinase, is a key regulator of bone resorption (22Roodman D. Exp. Hematol. 1999; 27: 1229-1241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). c-Src is highly expressed in osteoclasts (23Horne W. Neff L. Chatterjee D. Lomri A. Levy J. Baron R. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1003-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) and concentrated at the ruffled border (24Tanaka S. Takahashi N. Udagawa N. Saski T. Fukui Y. Kurokawa T. Suda T. FEBS Lett. 1992; 313: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). c-Src negative transgenic mice develop osteopetrosis from decreased bone resorption (25Soriano P. Montgomery C. Geske R. Bradley A. Cell. 1991; 64: 693-702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1792) Google Scholar). Microscopically, osteoclasts from these mice were described to be elongated and have rudimentary or absent ruffled borders (26Boyce B. Yoneda T. Lowe C. Soriano P. Mundy G. J. Clin. Investig. 1992; 90: 1622-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Therefore it appears that c-Src and its downstream signaling pathways support bone resorption by mature osteoclasts by allowing full development of the ruffled border (27Tanaka S. Amling M. Neff L. Peyman A. Uhlmann E. Levy J. Baron R. Nature. 1996; 383: 528-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 28Yoneda T. Lowe C. Lee C. Gutierrez G. Niewolna M. Williams P. Izbicka E. Uehara Y.

Chem. 1996; 271: 3141-3147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). A direct role for Src in support of osteoclast acid transport has not been determined, but it is clearly required to develop a functional ruffled border (2Teitelbaum S.L. Science. 2000; 289: 1504-1508Crossref PubMed Scopus (3004) Google Scholar, 30Nakamura I. Rodan G.A. Duong L.T. J. Electron Microsc. 2003; 52: 527-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar).One mechanism by which c-Src could support the development of functional osteoclasts would be the targeting of proton pump, chloride channel, or both to the ruffled border (3Schlesinger P. Mattsson J. Blair H. Miner. Electrolyte Metab. 1994; : 31-39PubMed Google Scholar, 10Blair H.C. Teitelbaum S.L. Tan H.L. Koziol C.M. Schlesinger P.H. Am. J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 18636-18643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). p64, the bovine kidney homolog of osteoclast p62, has been shown to be regulated by the Src homolog, Fyn (31Edwards J.C. Kapadia S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31826-31832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). When co-expressed with Fyn, p64 becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated and the tyrosine-phosphorylated p64 is a ligand for the SH2 domain of Fyn. Furthermore, co-expression of p64 with Fyn results in increased p64-associated chloride channel activity. These observations led us to speculate that, like p64, the osteoclast chloride channel might be a ligand for c-Src and that c-Src actions in osteoclasts could be mediated, at least in part, by that interaction.In this report, we separately disrupt expression of CLIC-5b and c-Src by avian osteoclasts differentiating in culture (15Schlesinger P. Blair H. Teitelbaum S. Edwards J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18636-18643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). We present evidence that the avian ruffle border chloride channel, p62, is the avian form of CLIC-5b. We observe that suppression of CLIC-5b expression with antisense oligonucleotides reduces osteoclast bone resorption and decreases acidification in vesicles prepared from cultured osteoclasts. Based on the response to valinomycin, we conclude that the reduced acidification results from a decrease in chloride channel activity. These observations support our proposal that CLIC-5b is a ruffled border chloride channel and further confirm the importance of ruffled border chloride conductance in acidification and bone resorption. We investigate the binding of CLIC-5b to Src and demonstrate that the native protein is a ligand for both the SH2 and SH3 domains of Src. Finally, we investigate the effects of antisense suppression of c-Src on acid transport by isolated vesicles. Our data indicate that c-Src may be necessary for the functional expression of active chloride channel in proton pump containing membrane domains of differentiating osteoclasts.MATERIALS AND METHODSCulture of Osteoclasts and the Preparation of Membrane Vesicles—Osteoclasts and bone marrow cells were isolated from the long bones of calcium-deprived laying hens (Gallus domesticus), cultured and membranes prepared as described (10Blair H.C.

Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1164-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Membrane pellets were stored at –80 °C until analyzed.Assay of Vesicle Acidification—Acidification of membrane vesicles was as previously described (10Blair H.C. Teitelbaum S.L. Tan H.L. Koziol C.M. Schlesinger P.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C1315-C1324Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Schlesinger P. Blair H. Teitelbaum S. Edwards J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18636-18643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In brief, membrane vesicles formed in 140 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.0) were diluted into the same buffer containing 3.3 μm acridine orange, 2.5 mm ATP, and other reagents as indicated. The reaction was started by adding 10 mm MgCl2 to the reaction mixture at 37 °C, and fluorescence was followed in an SPF500 spectrofluorometer (excitation 460 nm and emission 520 nm). At the end of each experiment 20 mm NH4Cl was added to determine the extent of intravesicular acidification. Protein concentration was determined using the BCA protein assay method (Pierce) and used to normalize results from different preparations. When studied in this manner the stimulated acidification of the reconstituted ruffled border membrane vesicles has an exponential time course. Therefore the quenching time course for each experiment was fitted to a single exponential using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm and Origin software. This analysis generated time constants for dequenching, t, and the size of the ATP-dependent exponential component of the total dequenching, F520time=0-F520time=∞. These values were employed to compare the effects of antisense suppression of CLIC-5b or Src on reconstituted vesicle acidification.Isolation of p64-related Sequences from Chicken—A commercially available chicken genomic library (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was screened at low stringency with a probe for the C-terminal portion of bovine p64, yielding a number of individual isolates. Restriction fragments hybridizing to the p64 probe were subcloned into plasmid vectors, random sequences generated and searched for homology with p64. One fragment corresponding to the C-terminal portion of p64 (15Schlesinger P. Blair H. Teitelbaum S. Edwards J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18636-18643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and a second corresponding to the middle of the p64 coding region were found. Oligonucleotides from those genomic sequences were used to generate cDNA from chicken osteoclast mRNA by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Northern blots of RNA from cultured differentiating osteoclasts was carried out as previously described (15Schlesinger P. Blair H. Teitelbaum S. Edwards J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18636-18643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), using the cloned PCR product as a probe. Several antisense oligonucleotides were selected from the sequence and assessed for ability to suppress expression of p62 in cultured cells. The most effective of these, 5′-CATCTGTCTTGACTTCTCC, was used in the following experiments. Phosphorothioate oligonucleotides containing this and matched complementary sense sequence was purchased from Midland Scientific (Midland, Texas).Antisense Treatment of Osteoclasts—Marrow cells from calcium-deprived hens were isolated as described and cultured in the presence of devitalized bone particles (15Schlesinger P.

Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1164-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). After 24 h in culture, cells were exposed to phosphorothioate oligonucleotide using streptolysin-O permeabilization (33Chellaiah M. Fitzgerald C. Alvarez U. Hruska K. J. Biol.

Cells were washed in permeabilization buffer at 37 °C (137 mm NaCl, 100 mm PIPES at pH 7.4, 5.6 mm glucose, 2.7 mm KCl, 2.7 mm EGTA, 0.1% bovine serum albumin) and then exposed to 50 μm oligonucleotide in the same buffer supplemented with 1 mm ATP, 5 mm dithiothreitol and 0.5 units/ml streptolysin-O at 37 °C for 15 min. The cells were returned to growth medium for 2 h, washed an additional time with growth medium and returned to culture. The cells were harvested for analysis from 20 to 100 h after exposure to oligonucleotide. Avian c-Src expression was suppressed using antisense oligonucleotides as previously described (33Chellaiah M. Fitzgerald C. Alvarez U. Hruska K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11908-11916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar).Bone Pitting Analysis—Marrow cells were plated directly onto ivory disks and exposed to oligonucleotide after 24 h exactly as described above. Forty-eight hours later the disks were stained using a toluidine blue-based two-stage procedure yielding the number of attached osteoclasts as well as the number of pits (35Dempster D. Murrills R.

Endocrinology. 1987; 120: 602-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar).Immunohistochemistry—Marrow cells were cultured onto thin microscope cover slips and exposed to oligonucleotide as described above. At 72 h in culture, the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 10 min, rinsed with PBS and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS for 1 min. The cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C in 1:1000 dilution of AP656 (rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against an 18-amino acid peptide from CLIC-5b (15Schlesinger P. Blair H. Teitelbaum S. Edwards J. J. Biol.

Ross F. Kopito R. Gluck S. Calcified Tissue Internat. 1996; 58: 332-336PubMed Google Scholar)), washed and incubated overnight with species-specific fluorescent secondary antibodies. Cover slips were mounted in Prolong antifade medium. Samples were viewed on a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope and z-stacks of cells were taken at 0.3-micron steps. These stacks were used to construct three-dimensional images that were analyzed using NOEsys, Research Systems, Inc. and final figures produced with Photoshop.Western Blotting—For detection of CLIC-5b, membrane preparations were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and probed with the AP656 antibody raised against a 18-amino acid peptide from CLIC-5b (15Schlesinger P. Blair H. Teitelbaum S. Edwards J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18636-18643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). For detection of Src, whole cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted, and probed with antibody raised against an avian Src (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) using Supersignal detection reagents (Pierce).Immobilized Src Homology Domain Binding Studies—Regions encoding chicken Src SH2 domain (amino acids 145–240) and SH3 domain (amino acids 86–140) were generated by RT-PCR from chicken osteoclast RNA using standard methods, and inserted into plasmid pGEX-KG. This resulted in plasmids encoding glutathione S-transferase (GST) fused to the N terminus of either Src SH2 or SH3 domains as reported previously for Fyn SH2/SH3 (38Richard S. Yu D. Blumer K.J. Hausladen D. Olszowy M.W. Connelly P.A. Shaw A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 186-197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fusion proteins were purified from bacteria and 1 mg of each was immobilized on 1 ml of Affi-Gel-15 beads (Bio-Rad). Membrane fractions from mature osteoclasts were solubilized in 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1.4% n-octyl glucoside and insoluble debris removed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. For phosphatase treatment, 5 units of alkaline phosphatase (Promega) were added per mg of solubilized protein and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Solubilized protein, 350 μg, was incubated with 20 μl of 50% suspension of Affi-Gel-15 beads bearing either GST (control beads), GST-SH2 fusion protein, or GST-SH3 fusion protein for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times with solubilization buffer, suspended in Laemmli loading buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE and probed for CLIC-5b with affinity-purified antibody 656 as described previously (15Schlesinger P. Blair H. Teitelbaum S. Edwards J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18636-18643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar).Immunoprecipitation and in Vitro Kinase Assay—1 ml of crude 656 antiserum or of preimmune serum was immobilized on 2 ml of resin using the carbolink system (Pierce). Nonspecific binding sites were blocked by incubation with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h. Membrane fractions from freshly isolated mature osteoclasts were solubilized in 200 mm sucrose, 10% glycerol, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1.4% n-octyl glucoside, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate. Insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation and protein concentration determined. Overnight 300 μg of solubilized protein were incubated with 20 μlof 50% suspension of immune or preimmune beads at 4 °C with gentle mixing. Beads were washed with three changes of solubilization buffer followed by three changes of 200 mm LiCl, 200 mm Tris (pH 8), and finally one change of 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm Na3VO4. The washed beads were then suspended in 10 μl of the same buffer and 1 μl of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mm, 20 mCi/ml) was added for a 20-min incubation at room temperature. Fifteen microliters of 2× Laemmli loading buffer was added, the samples separated by SDS-PAGE and 32P-labeled proteins detected by autoradiography. As a positive control, 1 μl of purified human Src (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) was added to an identical reaction mixture without the antibody beads.RESULTSProton Pump and Chloride Permeability in HCl Transport by Osteoclast Membrane Vesicles—Proton transport into membrane vesicles prepared from osteoclasts is electrogenic and therefore a compensating short circuit current is required for significant acidification (10Blair H.C.

Xie X.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24979-24982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In these vesicles, endogenous sodium and potassium permeabilities are absent but chloride in the extravesicular medium permits robust acidification (10Blair H.C. Teitelbaum S.L. Tan H.L. Koziol C.M. Schlesinger P.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C1315-C1324Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Blair H. Schlesinger P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 171: 920-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The chloride requirement can be overcome by introducing potassium permeability with valinomycin, a potassium ionophore. In the presence of equal intra- and extravesicular potassium concentration, valinomycin will clamp vesicle membrane potential at zero, thus permitting acidification of the vesicle interior to proceed at the maximum rate supported by the proton pump. We have previously shown that an imbalance of chloride permeability and proton transport by osteoclast membrane vesicles can be revealed by the effect of valinomycin on acidification (15Schlesinger P. Blair H. Teitelbaum S. Edwards J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18636-18643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). If the chloride permeability of these vesicles is adequate to prevent generation of a membrane potential by the proton pump, valinomycin will have no additional effect on acidification. Conversely, if chloride permeability is limiting, valinomycin will collapse the membrane potential resulting from pump activity and thus enhance acidification.To study membrane potential-limited acidification in osteoclast vesicles we apply valinomycin and determine whether the rate or extent of acidification is increased. The kinetics of vesicle acidification was determined using an acridine orange technique as previously described (10Blair H.C. Teitelbaum S.L. Tan H.L. Koziol C.M. Schlesinger P.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C1315-C1324Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Mattsson J.P. Schlesinger P.H. Keeling D.J. Teitelbaum S.L. Stone D.K. Xie X.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24979-24982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this assay, acidification of intravesicular space leads to accumulation of acridine orange inside the vesicles and quenching of fluorescence (39Clerc S. Barenholz Y. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 259: 104-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Under these conditions acidification is an exponential approach to the steady state resulting from a balance of v-H+-ATPase activity and vesicle proton leak (40Grabe M. Oster G. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 329-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). In the presence of extravesicular chloride, vesicles acidify rapidly, as detected by quenching of acridine orange fluorescence, Fig. 1. Addition of valinomycin in the presence of chloride had minimal effect, indicating that these vesicles have sufficient shunt permeability to allow maximal acidification by the amount of proton pump present (10Blair H.C. Teitelbaum S.L. Tan H.L. Koziol C.M. Schlesinger P.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C1315-C1324Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Schlesinger P. Blair H. Teitelbaum S. Edwards J. J. Biol.

Substitution for chloride with the impermeant anion, sulfate, or addition of the anion channel inhibitor, DNDS, reduced acidification. In either case electrogenic H+ transport by the pump generates a membrane potential, which increases prot"
https://openalex.org/W1965647044,"In the normal breast, ERBB4 regulates epithelial differentiation and functions as a nuclear chaperone for signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 5A, thereby stimulating milk-gene expression. In addition, ERBB4 functions as a proapoptotic protein, suppressing the growth of malignant cells. We hypothesize that these ERBB4 activities can be marshaled to suppress the growth of breast tumors. To this end, we have created an ERBB4 allele harboring an activating transmembrane mutation (ERBB4-CA) by substituting isoleucine 658 for glutamic acid. This base substitution forms a valine-glutamic acid-glycine activation domain first identified in oncogenic ERBB2/HER2/Neu. Ectopic expression of ERBB4-CA in HEK293T cells resulted in a fivefold increase in receptor tyrosine phosphorylation. Functionally, ERBB4-CA exhibited higher levels of nuclear translocation than wild-type ERBB4, leading to significantly enhanced ERBB4-induced STAT5A simulation of the beta-casein promoter. Activated ERBB4 has been demonstrated to induce cell killing of breast tumor cells. Significantly, ERBB4-CA potentiated the proapoptotic function of ERBB4 in each breast, prostate and ovarian cancer cell line tested. Untransformed cell lines were resistant to both ERBB4 and ERBB4-CA-mediated apoptosis underscoring the potential utility of active ERBB4 signaling for the therapeutic intervention of human cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2007404669,"Escherichia coli quinol-fumarate reductase operates with both natural quinones, ubiquinone (UQ) and menaquinone (MQ), at a single quinone binding site. We have utilized a combination of mutagenesis, kinetic, EPR, and Fourier transform infrared methods to study the role of two residues, Lys-B228 and Glu-C29, at the quinol-fumarate reductase quinone binding site in reactions with MQ and UQ. The data demonstrate that Lys-B228 provides a strong hydrogen bond to MQ and is essential for reactions with both quinone types. Substitution of Glu-C29 with Leu and Phe caused a dramatic decrease in enzymatic reactions with MQ in agreement with previous studies, however, the succinate-UQ reductase reaction remains unaffected. Elimination of a negative charge in Glu-C29 mutant enzymes resulted in significantly increased stabilization of both UQ·¯. and MQ·¯ semiquinones. The data presented here suggest similar hydrogen bonding of the C1 carbonyl of both MQ and UQ, whereas there is different hydrogen bonding for their C4 carbonyls. The differences are shown by a single point mutation of Glu-C29, which transforms the enzyme from one that is predominantly a menaquinol-fumarate reductase to one that is essentially only functional as a succinate-ubiquinone reductase. These findings represent an example of how enzymes that are designed to accommodate either UQ or MQ at a single Q binding site may nevertheless develop sufficient plasticity at the binding pocket to react differently with MQ and UQ. Escherichia coli quinol-fumarate reductase operates with both natural quinones, ubiquinone (UQ) and menaquinone (MQ), at a single quinone binding site.

Facultative anaerobic bacteria and lower eukaryotes adapt their metabolism in response to environmental changes. An important aspect of this adaptability is that many can synthesize both ubiquinone (UQ) 4The abbreviations used are: UQ, ubiquinone; MQ, menaquinone; DNP-19, 2-[1-[(p-chlorophenyl)ethyl]-4,6-dinitrophenol]; DNP-17, 2-(methylhexyl)-4-6-dinitrophenol; FTIR, Fourier-transform infrared; HQNO, 2-n-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide; MQH2, menaquinol; UQH2, ubiquinol; UQ1,UQ2, ubiquinone with one or two isoprenoid side-chain units, respectively; QFR, menaquinol-fumarate reductase; SQ, semiquinone; SQR, succinate-ubiquinone reductase; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; bis-Tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol.4The abbreviations used are: UQ, ubiquinone; MQ, menaquinone; DNP-19, 2-[1-[(p-chlorophenyl)ethyl]-4,6-dinitrophenol]; DNP-17, 2-(methylhexyl)-4-6-dinitrophenol; FTIR, Fourier-transform infrared; HQNO, 2-n-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide; MQH2, menaquinol; UQH2, ubiquinol; UQ1,UQ2, ubiquinone with one or two isoprenoid side-chain units, respectively; QFR, menaquinol-fumarate reductase; SQ, semiquinone; SQR, succinate-ubiquinone reductase; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; bis-Tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol. and menaquinone (MQ). Quinone biosynthesis and relative concentration is regulated by growth conditions and oxygen supply with UQ and MQ being the primary quinone under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, respectively (1Collins M.D. Jones D. Microbiol. Rev. 1981; 45: 316-335Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Membrane-bound bacterial enzymes that utilize quinones as substrates can often catalyze redox reactions with both UQ and MQ. Membrane-bound quinol-fumarate reductase (QFR) in Escherichia coli is an example of an enzyme that can readily use both types of quinones and shows high menaquinol-fumarate and succinate-quinone reductase activities (2Maklashina E. Cecchini G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 369: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). QFR serves as a terminal reductase in the anaerobic bacterial respiratory chain by catalyzing the menaquinol-fumarate reductase reaction (3Gest H. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1980; 7: 73-77Crossref Google Scholar). When genetically manipulated to allow its expression under aerobic conditions, QFR efficiently replaces succinate-ubiquinone reductase (SQR) in aerobic metabolism and cell growth by catalyzing ubiquinone reduction from succinate (4Guest J.R. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1981; 122: 171-179PubMed Google Scholar).Membrane-bound QFR from E. coli is a four subunit complex, and its x-ray structure has been solved (5Cecchini G. Annu. Rev.

The FrdA and FrdB subunits comprise the soluble component that contains a dicarboxylate substrate binding site, a covalently bound FAD, and three linearly arranged iron-sulfur centers (5Cecchini G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 77-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 6Lancaster C.R.D. Simon J. Biochim. Biophys.

Acta. 2002; 1553: 140-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The membrane-spanning hydrophobic subunits FrdC and FrdD are necessary to anchor the soluble the FrdAB domain to the membrane and were found to harbor two menaquinone binding sites (8Iverson T.M. Luna-Chavez C. Cecchini G. Rees D.C. Science. 1999; 284: 1961-1966Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). One of these, the QP-site, is positioned proximal to the [3Fe-4S] cluster of the FrdB subunit and comprises a relatively polar binding pocket. The other menaquinone molecule was found at the QD site that is positioned 27 Å from QP toward the periplasmic side of the membrane. X-ray crystallographic studies have shown that the Q-site inhibitor HQNO (2-n-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide), an analogue of MQ, and DNP-19 (2-[1-[(p-chlorophenyl)ethyl]-4,6-dinitrophenol]), an analogue of UQ (Fig. 1) bind exclusively at the QP-site (9Iverson T.M. Luna-Chavez C. Croal L.R. Cecchini G. Rees D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16124-16130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This is in agreement with kinetic data that suggest a single exchangeable Q-site where quinone redox reactions occur (2Maklashina E. Cecchini G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 369: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Although both inhibitors bind at the QP-site, the binding of DNP-19 is shifted with respect to HQNO or MQ (Fig. 2). The C1 carbonyl of MQ, the N-oxide group of HQNO, and the hydroxyl group of DNP-19, are all positioned within hydrogen bonding distance to Lys-B228 Nζ, Trp-D14 Nϵ, and the side-chain carbonyl of Gln-B225. The opposite side of the quinoid ring or inhibitor molecule near the C4 carbonyl of MQ is positioned differently. The hydroxyl group of HQNO is hydrogen-bonded to the side chains of Glu-C29 and Arg-C28, whereas oxygen from the NO2 group of DNP is shifted >2 Å toward the entry into the QP pocket and positioned 4 Å away from the side chain of Glu-C29, within close proximity to Arg-D81 and Arg-C28. Based on the structure of the QP-site it was suggested that Lys-B228 and Glu-C29 could be the primary proton acceptors from MQH2 (8Iverson T.M. Luna-Chavez C. Cecchini G. Rees D.C. Science. 1999; 284: 1961-1966Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar).FIGURE 2Comparison of the QP binding site in E. coli QFR occupied with HQNO (PDB 1KF6) and DNP-19 (PDB 1KFY).

HQNO is a close analogue of the MQ semiquinone and binds to QFR with a Kd in the low nanomolar range (15Rothery R.A. Seime A.M. Spiers A.M. Maklashina E. Schröder I. Gunsalus R.P. Cecchini G. Weiner J.H. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 313-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). By contrast, DNP-19 demonstrates a two orders of magnitude lower affinity (16Yankovskaya V. Sablin S.O. Ramsay R.R.

Chem. 1996; 271: 21020-21024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and is the only benzoquinone analogue whose position at the QP-site has been confirmed by crystallographic studies (9Iverson T.M. Luna-Chavez C. Croal L.R. Cecchini G. Rees D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16124-16130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The NO2 group at the C4 carbonyl position and a phenyl substitution at the C2 position in the DNP-19 molecule may restrict the inhibitor from deeper intercalation into the Qp pocket compared with UQ. Because the QFR structure with UQ is not available, it cannot be excluded that ubiquinone may occupy a position similar to MQ where the C4 carbonyl of UQ would be hydrogen-bonded to the side chain of Glu-C29. It has been shown that mutation of Glu-C29 to a leucine results in enzyme that demonstrates increased stability of the MQ radical at the Qp-site (17Hagerhall C. Magnitsky S. Sled V.D. Schröder I. Gunsalus R.P. Cecchini G. Ohnishi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26157-26164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and shows very low menaquinol-fumarate reductase activity indicating that Glu-C29 is a primary proton acceptor from menaquinol. The FrdC Glu-29 → Leu mutant of QFR is unable to support anaerobic respiratory growth on fumarate (18Westenberg D.J. Gunsalus R.P. Ackrell B.A.C. Sices H. Cecchini G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 815-822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, this mutant is still able to support aerobic respiratory growth on succinate and retains high succinate-ubiquinone reductase activity. Thus, although Glu-C29 is critical for menaquinol oxidation, it does not appear to be essential for ubiquinone reduction.In this work we have investigated the mechanism of quinone redox reactions at the QP active site of E. coli QFR. In addition to Glu-C29 variant enzymes, mutations of Lys-B228 were constructed and studied by kinetic methods, electrochemically induced FTIR, and EPR spectroscopy. The data show that even a conservative substitution of Lys-B228 by Arg results in dramatic effects on both MQ oxidation and UQ reduction. The FrdC E29L and E29F variant enzymes are significantly impaired in their reactions with MQ in both succinateoxidase and fumarate-reductase directions while retaining full activity as a succinate-UQ reductase. The results are in agreement with crystallographic data and suggest different hydrogen bonding for MQ and UQ at the Qp binding site of QFR that result in differences in the mechanism of redox reactions with MQ and UQ. The differences are shown by a single point mutation of Glu-C29, which transforms the enzyme from one that is predominantly a menaquinol-fumarate reductase to one that is essentially only functional as a succinate-ubiquinone reductase.MATERIALS AND METHODSBacterial Strains and Plasmids—The E. coli strain DW35 (ΔfrdABCD, sdhC::kan), and plasmid pH3 (frdA+B+C+D+), which are used for expression of wild-type and mutant forms of QFR, have been previously described (18Westenberg D.J. Gunsalus R.P. Ackrell B.A.C. Sices H. Cecchini G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 815-822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The menaquinone- and ubiquinone-deficient strains used were JCB4111 and JCB4211, respectively. These are derivatives of JCB4011 (ΔlacU169 araD139 rpsL gyrA non ΔnarZ::ΩΔnapAB) bearing ΔmenBC and ΔubiCA deletions, respectively (19Brondijk T.H.C. Fiegen D. Richardson D.J. Cole J.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 245-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar).Mutagenesis—Plasmid pH3 was used as the template for mutagenesis. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed utilizing the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit, from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Primers for mutagenesis were obtained from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). Nucleotide changes to construct the mutants are underlined. To construct the FrdB K228L mutant, primer 5′-GCCATTCAGCAGGGCTTAGTAGAAAGTTCGAAAG-3′, and its reverse compliment were designed. The FrdB K228R mutant was constructed using the primer 5′-GCCATTCAGCAGGGCCGAGTAGAAAGTTCGAAAG-3′ and its reverse compliment. The 993-bp Mlul-SalI fragment containing the FrdB K228 mutations was cloned into pH3 for the expression of the four subunit mutant construct. All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing using the UCSF Biomolecular core facility. Mutant plasmids were subsequently transformed into E. coli DW35 for expression of mutant enzyme.Growth Conditions and Enzyme Purification—DW35 cells harboring the appropriate plasmid were grown under microaerophilic conditions in Terrific Broth medium as previously described (20Maklashina E. Rothery R.A. Weiner J.H. Cecchini G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18968-18976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Isolation of membrane fractions enriched with wild-type and mutant QFR enzymes was performed as previously described (15Rothery R.A. Seime A.M. Spiers A.M. Maklashina E. Schröder I. Gunsalus R.P. Cecchini G. Weiner J.H. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 313-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To purify the QFR proteins, the membranes were extracted with 2% w/v Triton X-100, and chromatography on DEAE-Fast Flow was performed in 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 0.05% Thesit (Anapoe C12E9 (polyoxyethylene 9)-dodecyl ether), Anatrace Inc., Maumee, OH). The resin was washed with the same buffer containing 0.1 m NaCl, and QFR proteins were eluted with the same buffer containing 0.2 m NaCl. QFR containing fractions were concentrated and applied to a Sephacryl S-300 size-exclusion column (Amersham Biosciences) in 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0), 0.05% Thesit. The enzyme was concentrated to ∼0.5 mm for use in the electrochemical cell.Growth of Menaquinone and Ubiquinone-deficient Strains—JCB4111 (ΔmenBC) harboring FrdC E29L variant was grown microaerobically on Terrific Broth as described above. However, JCB4211 (ΔubiCA) does not grow aerobically and was therefore grown anaerobically for 24 h on glucose-peptonefumarate medium (21Condon C. Weiner J.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1988; 2: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Membranes were prepared as described above.Measurement of Enzyme Activity—Activation of QFR enzymes to remove inhibitory oxaloacetate was performed as described previously (2Maklashina E. Cecchini G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 369: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The standard assay medium contained 30 mm bis-Tris-propane, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.006% Thesit, and 3 mm potassium cyanide at 30 °C. To achieve anaerobic conditions 10 mm glucose, glucose oxidase, and catalase were added to the assay medium when needed. Succinate-oxidase reactions of the QFR enzymes with 0.5 mm potassium ferricyanide (ϵ420 = 1 mm-1 cm-1) was performed aerobically as previously described in the presence of 20 mm succinate (2Maklashina E. Cecchini G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 369: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Succinate-UQ1 reductase activity was determined in the presence of 20 mm succinate and varied concentrations of UQ1. The reaction was followed by decrease of the absorbance at 278 nm (ϵ278 = 12 mm-1 cm-1). The succinate-MQ1 reductase reaction was performed anaerobically with 40 μm acetylated horse heart cytochrome c (ϵ550 = 21 mm-1 cm-1). Fumarate reduction by QFR enzymes with MQ1 was determined in a reaction coupled to NAD(P)H-quinone reductase in oxygen-free media as previously described (2Maklashina E. Cecchini G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 369: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). MQ1 and UQ1 were kindly provided by Eisai Co. Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan).

Open table in a new tab FTIR Difference Spectroscopy—FTIR difference spectra as a function of the applied potential were obtained in the 2500 to 1000 cm-1 range using a modified Bruker IFS 25. In all experiments, the protein solution was first equilibrated at the initial potential of the electrode, and single beam spectra in the IR range were recorded. Then, a potential step toward the final potential was applied, and the single beam spectrum of this state was again recorded after equilibration. Subsequently, difference spectra, as presented in this work, were calculated from the two single-beam spectra with the initial single-beam spectrum taken as the reference. No smoothing or deconvolution procedures were applied. The equilibration at the applied potential generally took less than 5 min in the potential range from -0.45 to 0.05 V for the protein concentration, type, and concentration of the mediators and electrode modification described above. Equilibration times have been determined with UV-visible difference spectra on the same sample (data not shown), and the full reaction in the FTIR was monitored by double difference spectra until no changes were detected. Typically, 128 interferograms at 4 cm-1 resolution were co-added for each single-beam IR spectrum and Fourier-transformed using triangular apodization. 5 to 10 difference spectra were usually averaged. The noise level in the difference spectra was estimated to be ∼30-50 × 10-6 absorbance units in the spectral range under consideration, except for the region of the strongly absorbing water bending and protein amide I modes at ∼1650 cm-1 where the noise was slightly higher.Sample Preparation—The isolated QFR proteins were in 50 mm potassium phosphate, 0.05% Thesit. The ultra-thin-layer spectroelectrochemical cell for the UV-visible and IR detection and the potentiostat was used as previously described (22Moss D. Nabedryk E. Breton J. Mäntele W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 187: 565-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Sufficient transmission in the range from 1800 cm-1 to 1000 cm-1 was achieved with the path length of 6-8 μm. The gold grid working electrode was chemically modified by usinga2mm cysteamine solution as described elsewhere (23Hellwig P. Behr J. Ostermeier C. Richter O.M. Pfitzner U. Odenwald A. Ludwig B. Michel H. Mäntele W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7390-7399Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). To accelerate the redox reaction, 16 different mediators were added, including those listed in a previous study (24Hellwig P. Scheide D. Bungert S. Mäntele W. Friedrich T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10884-10891Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) except for n-methylphenazonium methosulfate and n-ethylphenazonium sulfate. The final concentration of each mediator was adjusted to 45 μm. At this concentration and at an optical path length below 10 μm, control experiments with protein-free samples revealed no contributions from the mediators in the UV-visible and IR spectral ranges, except for the P-O stretching modes of the phosphate buffer between 1200 and 1000 cm-1. The stock solutions of MQ1 (100 mm) and UQ2 (64 mm) in Me2SO were diluted 10 times with methanol and used to achieve final concentration of 0.8 mm in 10 μl of 0.5 mm enzyme solution. After 20-min incubation at room temperature the mixture of mediators was added to the protein sample. Potentials quoted with the data refer to the Ag/AgCl/3 m KCl reference electrode (i.e. +208 mV for the standard hydrogen electrode, at pH 7).Potentiometric Titrations and EPR Spectroscopy—To obtain data as representative as possible of the in vivo enzymes, all EPR data reported herein were obtained from preparations of cytoplasmic membranes. Potentiometric titrations were carried out at 25 °C in a buffer containing 100 mm Tricine/KOH (pH 8.0), 5 mm EDTA, and 1 mm malonate at 25 °C as previously described (25Rothery R.A. Weiner J.H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3247-3257Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The following redox mediators were used at a concentration of 25 μm: 2,6-dichlorindophenol, 1,2-naphthoquinone, toluylene blue, phenazine methosulfate, thionine, methylene blue, resorufin, indigotrisulfonate, indigocarmine, anthraquinone-2-sulfonic acid, and neutral red. EPR spectra were recorded using a Bruker ESP300E spectrometer equipped with a Bruker liquid nitrogen evaporating cryostat (an ER4111 VT variable temperature unit). Spectra were recorded at a temperature of -123 °C using a microwave power of 20 milliwatts at 9.438 GHz, and a modulation amplitude of 2 Gpp at 100 KHz. Five scans were accumulated for each sample.Potentiometric titration data were analyzed by plotting the intensity of the g = 2.00 peak-trough versus Eh and fitting the resultant bell-shaped titration curve to two midpoint redox potential (Em) values (26Hastings S.F. Kaysser T.M. Jiang F. Salerno J.C. Gennis R.B. Ingledew W.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Em values were representatives of two to three independent titrations with a standard deviation of ∼±10 mV.Analytical Methods—FAD content was determined as previously described (20Maklashina E. Rothery R.A. Weiner J.H. Cecchini G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18968-18976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was measured by the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as a standard in the presence of 1% (w/v) SDS. Fluorescence quench titrations to measure quinone binding were determined as described before (15Rothery R.A. Seime A.M. Spiers A.M. Maklashina E. Schröder I. Gunsalus R.P. Cecchini G. Weiner J.H. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 313-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar).RESULTSKinetic Characteristics of the Mutants—The FrdC E29L and FrdC E29F mutant proteins had been studied previously, however, focused on reactions with endogenous menaquinone within isolated membranes (17Hagerhall C. Magnitsky S. Sled V.D. Schröder I. Gunsalus R.P. Cecchini G. Ohnishi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26157-26164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 18Westenberg D.J. Gunsalus R.P. Ackrell B.A.C. Sices H. Cecchini G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 815-822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Table 1 demonstrates the kinetic properties of purified Glu-C29 mutant enzymes in reactions with both natural quinone analogues, MQ1 and UQ1.As seen in Table 1, substitution of Glu-C29 by Leu or Phe resulted in enzymes that are similar in their kinetic behavior and demonstrate severely impaired reactions with menaquinone. The dehydrogenase activities remained unaffected by the substitution at the Glu-C29 position in the variant enzymes as evidenced by the high ferricyanide reductase activity. However, both MQ1H2-fumarate reductase and succinate-MQ1 reductase activities were affected with retention of only ∼1-3% of the wild-type activity in agreement with previous observations (17Hagerhall C. Magnitsky S. Sled V.D. Schröder I. Gunsalus R.P. Cecchini G. Ohnishi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26157-26164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). It was surprising, however, that both mutants were as active as wild-type QFR in the succinate-UQ1 reductase reaction. The kinetic parameters of the succinate-UQ1 reductase reaction catalyzed by the mutants are essentially the same as for the wild-type QFR parameters (Table 1). Both variants also show increased sensitivity to HQNO and DNP-17. In agreement with the increased affinity to UQ1 in both mutants, the decrease of Ki for HQNO and DNP-17 for oxidized (succinate-UQ1 reductase) and reduced (MQ1-fumarate reductase) in the FrdC E29L and E29F variants was observed (Table 1). The overall kinetic behavior of the mutants is in agreement with structural arrangement of the QP-site with MQ, HQNO, and DNP-19 (Fig. 2); where Glu-C29 serves as direct proton donor/acceptor to the C4 carbonyl of menaquinone, however, the data suggests it may not be required for protonation of ubiquinone.The menaquinol-fumarate reductase reaction catalyzed by QFR is coupled with proton exchange between protein and quinol/quinone at the Qp-site. It can be expected that quinol-oxidation and quinone-reduction should be pH-dependent. The pH-profile of the MQ1-fumarate reductase reaction catalyzed by E. coli QFR shown in Fig. 3 shows an increase in activity with an apparent pKa of 6.3 that is attributed to the QP-site. Activity decreases above pH 8.0 with a lowered rate of the fumarate reduction. The pH profile of the MQ1-fumarate reductase reaction catalyzed by the FrdC E29L mutant, however, demonstrates a significant increase of pKa of over two pH units indicating that the wild-type pKa value of 6.3 is likely attributable to Glu-C29.FIGURE 3pH dependence of the MQ1H2:fumarate reductase reaction catalyzed by isolated wild-type QFR (closed circle) and FrdC E29L (open circle) enzymes. Activity was determined as described under “Materials and Methods.” Maximum activities correspond to 230 s-1 and 26 s-1 for wil"

Here, we have used a spin down assay to estimate the affinities for the binding of TF to ribosome nascent chain complexes (RNCs) with peptides of varying lengths and sequences. An in vitro system for protein synthesis assembled from purified Escherichia coli components was used to produce RNCs stalled on truncated mRNAs. The affinity of TF to RNCs exposing RNA polymerase sequences increased with the length of the nascent peptides. TF bound to RNA polymerase RNCs with significantly higher affinity than to inner membrane protein leader peptidase and bacterioopsin RNCs. The latter two RNCs are substrates for signal recognition particle, suggesting complementary affinities of TF and signal recognition particle to nascent peptides targeted for cytoplasm and membrane.

The importance of correct protein folding in living cells is reflected in the many chaperone systems that have evolved throughout the three kingdoms. In Escherichia coli the main cytosolic protein-folding chaperones belong to the DnaJ/DnaK and the GroEL/ES systems. It has been suggested that SecB also possesses general chaperone activity in addition to its role as a post-translational targeting factor (1Ullers R.S. Luirink J. Harms N. Schwager F. Georgopoulos C. Genevaux P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7583-7588Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and that the RNA of the large ribosomal subunit may function as a universal trans-acting chaperone (2Pal S. Chandra S. Chowdhury S. Sarkar D. Ghosh A.N. Gupta C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32771-32777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, there is also an apparent need for universal co-translational folding of nascent peptide chains on the ribosome. In prokaryotes, this chaperone function is carried out by Trigger Factor (TF) 2The abbreviations used are: TF, trigger factor; SRP, signal recognition particle; RNC, ribosome nascent chain complex; RpoB, RNA polymerase; Lep, leader peptidase; Bop, bacterioopsin; IMP, inner membrane protein.2The abbreviations used are: TF, trigger factor; SRP, signal recognition particle; RNC, ribosome nascent chain complex; RpoB, RNA polymerase; Lep, leader peptidase; Bop, bacterioopsin; IMP, inner membrane protein., and although TF lacks non-bacterial homologues, there exist ribosome-bound chaperones also in eukaryotes, which seem to carry out the same function as TF (3Rauch T.

Bairstow S. Craig E.A. Science. 2005; 308: 1032-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). TF is a 48-kDa protein with both chaperone function and peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans-isomerase (PPIase) activity. Removal of the PPIase activity of TF seems not to affect its chaperone activity (5Kramer G. Patzelt H. Rauch T. Kurz T.A. Vorderwulbecke S. Bukau B. Deuerling E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14165-14170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Although TF is present in ∼2-fold excess over ribosomes in the cytoplasm of E. coli, deletion of its gene has little effect on bacterial growth. However, simultaneous deletion of the genes for TF and DnaK leads to growth impairment and extensive protein aggregation (6Deuerling E. Schulze-Specking A. Tomoyasu T. Mogk A. Bukau B.

EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), suggesting overlapping substrate pools of TF and DnaK (7Deuerling E. Patzelt H. Vorderwulbecke S. Rauch T. Kramer G. Schaffitzel E. Mogk A. Schulze-Specking A. Langen H. Bukau B. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 1317-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In a study of TF binding to the members of a 13-mer peptide library, it was shown that TF binds most peptide chains, that binding does not depend on the proline content of the peptides, and that TF preferentially binds to peptides enriched in aromatic and basic amino acid residues (9Patzelt H. Rudiger S. Brehmer D. Kramer G. Vorderwulbecke S. Schaffitzel E. Waitz A. Hesterkamp T. Dong L. Schneider-Mergener J. Bukau B. Deuerling E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14244-14249Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain of TF binds to a site on the surface of the 50S ribosomal subunit localized to ribosomal proteins L23/L29, close to the opening of the peptide exit tunnel (10Kramer G. Rauch T. Rist W. Vorderwulbecke S. Patzelt H. Schulze-Specking A. Ban N. Deuerling E. Bukau B. Nature. 2002; 419: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), where TF shares binding vicinity with signal recognition particle (SRP) (11Gu S.Q. Peske F. Wieden H.J. Rodnina M.V. Wintermeyer W. RNA. 2003; 9: 566-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). L23 can be cross-linked to nascent peptides (12Ullers R.S. Houben E.N. Raine A. ten Hagen-Jongman C.M. Ehrenberg M. Brunner J. Oudega B. Harms N. Luirink J. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 679-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 13Eisner G. Koch H.G. Beck K. Brunner J. Muller M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), suggesting that both TF and SRP are strategically positioned for efficient interactions with growing amino acid chains protruding from the peptide exit tunnel. Docking of the crystal structure of TF to the 50S subunit suggests that TF forms a “folding cave,” in which an extensive surface is available for interaction with the nascent polypeptide (14Ferbitz L. Maier T. Patzelt H. Bukau B. Deuerling E. Ban N. Nature. 2004; 431: 590-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). TF binds to non-translating ribosomes and unfolded proteins with similar affinity (∼1 μm) but with slow kinetics in the former and rapid kinetics in the latter case (15Maier R. Scholz C. Schmid F.X. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 1181-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 16Maier R. Eckert B. Scholz C. Lilie H. Schmid F.X. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 585-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). How the length and sequence of nascent peptide chains affect the affinity of TF to its natural RNC substrate are important questions that, however, have remained unanswered. Here we have taken advantage of a ribosome spin down assay (17Raine A. Ivanova N. Wikberg J.E. Ehrenberg M. Biochimie (Paris). 2004; 86: 495-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and used [35S]-labeled TF to estimate dissociation equilibrium constants (KD) for the binding of TF to RNCs with nascent chains of varying length and sequence. An E. coli system for protein synthesis with components of high purity was used with truncated mRNAs to stall ribosomes with nascent peptide chains of RNA polymerase (RpoB), Leader Peptidase (Lep), and Bacterioopsin (Bop). We observed increasing TF affinity to RpoB RNCs with increasing nascent peptide chain lengths; there was, for instance, a 20-fold smaller KD value for the binding of TF to an RNC with a 133-amino acid-long peptide nascent chain from RpoB than to a naked ribosome. The affinity of TF to RNCs displayed great amino acid sequence variation in that the KD values for TF binding to Lep and Bop RNCs were several times higher than those of TF binding to RpoB RNCs of similar nascent peptide lengths. From the present observations and recent structural data on TF binding to the ribosome (14Ferbitz L. Maier T. Patzelt H. Bukau B. Deuerling E. Ban N. Nature. 2004; 431: 590-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), we suggest a model where the growing nascent chain interacts with multiple sites in the peptide binding cavity of TF. RpoB, Bop, and Lep Constructs—To produce RpoB mRNAs, the DNA sequences coding for the N-terminal 60, 80, 103, and 133 amino acid residues were amplified from the plasmid pC4MetRpoB156 by PCR. To produce Lep and Bop mRNAs, the Lep100 DNA sequence for the N-terminal 98 amino acids of Lep was amplified from the pC4MetLep98 plasmid and the DNA sequences for Bop81, Bop98, and Bop136 were amplified from the pC4MetBop plasmid. The corresponding mRNAs were subsequently obtained from these DNA templates by T7 in vitro transcription. In Vitro Protein Synthesis and Preparation of [35S]-TF—E. coli 70S ribosomes (>70% active in tetra peptide formation) were purified from MRE600 cells by zonal centrifugation (18Rodnina M.V. Wintermeyer W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1945-1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Initiation factors (IFs) and fMet-tRNAfMet were prepared as described (19Antoun A. Pavlov M.Y. Tenson T. Ehrenberg M.M. Biol. Proced. Online. 2004; 6: 35-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Elongation factors (EFs), tRNA bulk, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases were purified as described (20Ehrenberg M. Bilgin N. Kurland C.G. Spedding G. Ribosomes and Protein Synthesis: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1990: 101-129Google Scholar). Pyruvate kinase and myokinase were from Sigma. In vitro translation of mRNA was performed in polymix buffer (20Ehrenberg M. Bilgin N. Kurland C.G. Spedding G. Ribosomes and Protein Synthesis: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1990: 101-129Google Scholar). Initiation mixtures to obtain mRNA-programmed ribosomes with fMet-tRNAfMet contained (final concentrations stated): ribosomes 1.5 μm; initiation factors IF1, IF2, and IF3 1.5 μm each; mRNA 3 μm; fMet-tRNAfMet 3 μm; GTP 1 mm; phosphoenolpyruvate 2 mm. Factor mixes containing elongation factors, tRNAs, and aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases were prepared separately as follows (final concentrations stated): amino acids 1 mm each, ATP 2 mm, phosphoenolpyruvate 2 mm; GTP 1 mm; EF-Tu 30 μm; EF-G 2 μm; EF-Ts 3 μm, bulk tRNA 100 μm; all aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases 0.15 units/μl each (1 unit is the amount of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase that aminoacylates 1 pmol cognate tRNA/second at standard conditions); 0.1 μg/μl myokinase; 0.25 μg/μl pyruvate kinase. The initiation and factor mixes were preincubated for 15 min at 37 °C before mixing, and then the in vitro translation reactions were incubated for another 30 min. Ribosomes from a small aliquot of each master reaction containing [14C]glycine were purified on an S-300 gel filtration column, after which the ribosome and [14C]glycine concentrations were determined to estimate the fraction of ribosomes carrying a nascent chain. His-tagged TF was expressed in E. coli in the presence of [35S]methionine and was purified essentially as described before (17Raine A. Ivanova N. Wikberg J.E. Ehrenberg M. Biochimie (Paris). 2004; 86: 495-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The total concentration of TF was measured by the Bradford procedure. Equilibrium Binding Experiments—Directly after in vitro mRNA translation, 200 μl of ribosome nascent chain complexes (50–150 nm final concentration) were incubated with varying concentrations of [35S]-TF in polymix. After 20 min of incubation at 4 °C, the samples were spun down during 15 min at 225,000 × g in a microultracentrifuge (Sorvall) at the same temperature. The supernatants were rapidly removed, the pellets dissolved, and the radioactivity counted in a liquid scintillation counter (Beckmann LS6500). The background radioactivity was determined by parallel ultracentrifugation of various concentrations of TF in ribosome lacking translation mixes. The amount of spun down material was calculated from the radioactive-specific activity of [35S]-TF. Analysis of Equilibrium Binding Data—The equilibrium relations for the TF binding reactions are given as shown in Equation 1 by the expressiony=Rib·f·(x-y)K1+x-y+Rib·(1-f)·(x-y)K2+x-y(Eq. 1) where, y is the concentration of TF in complex with ribosomes, x is the total concentration of TF, Rib is the total concentration of ribosomes, f is the fraction of ribosomes carrying a nascent chain, and K1 and K2 are the equilibrium binding constants for TF binding to RNCs and non-translating ribosomes, respectively. Because the concentration of TF in complex with ribosomes (y) is much smaller than K2 + x in these experiments the equation simplifies as shown in Equation 2.y=Rib·f·(x-y)K1+x-y+Rib·(1-f)·(x-y)K2+x(Eq. 2) MAPLE 7 software (Maple Waterloo Inc.) was used to solve the equation, and the data from at least three independent titrations were fitted simultaneously to the solution using the ORIGIN 7 software (OriginLab Corp.). The curve was fitted to the parameters Rib and K1 while the f values were set at their experimental estimates for each RNC complex and K2 was set at 1000 nm, a value that was determined by titrating TF to non-translating ribosomes and in previous studies (17Raine A. Ivanova N. Wikberg J.E. Ehrenberg M. Biochimie (Paris). 2004; 86: 495-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). A cell-free system for protein synthesis with E. coli components was used to produce ribosomes that were stalled on trun-cated mRNAs (21Lovmar M. Tenson T. Ehrenberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53506-53515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and displayed nascent RpoB and, for comparison, inner membrane Lep or Bop peptide chains of varying lengths (Fig. 1A). The present choice of nascent RpoB peptides as the main target for TF was motivated by the previous identification of RpoB as one of the aggregation-prone proteins in a TF/DnaK double deletion strain (7Deuerling E. Patzelt H. Vorderwulbecke S. Rauch T. Kramer G. Schaffitzel E. Mogk A. Schulze-Specking A. Langen H. Bukau B. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 1317-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The truncated mRNAs, encoding N-terminal polypeptides of RpoB, Bop, or Lep (Fig. 1A), were translated, and the stalled ribosome complex was in each case targeted by [35S]-TF in a spin down assay (17Raine A. Ivanova N. Wikberg J.E. Ehrenberg M. Biochimie (Paris). 2004; 86: 495-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) to estimate the dissociation equilibrium constant (KD). In this type of assay, TF in complex with a ribosome is rapidly pelleted in the microultracentrifuge, whereas free TF remains in the supernatant. As long as the pellet does not “leak” TF, the binding of TF to the ribosome is monitored under authentic equilibrium conditions (17Raine A. Ivanova N. Wikberg J.E. Ehrenberg M. Biochimie (Paris). 2004; 86: 495-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The fraction of ribosomes active in nascent chain synthesis was in each case estimated in a parallel experiment in which the truncated mRNA was translated in the presence of [14C]glycine. The ribosomal complexes were subsequently separated from the other components of the system by gel filtration, and the active ribosome fraction was obtained from the specific activity of [14C]glycine and the OD estimated total ribosome concentration. In general, between 50 and 60% of the ribosomes carried a long nascent chain, and because TF also has affinity for naked ribosomes, a two-site binding model (see “Experimental Procedures”) was used to estimate the KD values. The homogeneity of those nascent chains that contained internal methionines was checked by in vitro translation in the presence of [35S]methionine and subsequent SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1B). The Affinity of TF to Ribosomes with Nascent RpoB Chains of Varying Length—We have estimated the affinity of TF to ribosomes displaying N-terminal nascent RpoB peptides consisting of 60, 80, 103, or 133 amino acids. ∼35 amino acids reside in the peptide exit tunnel of the ribosome, implying that in these cases ∼25, 45, 68, or 98 amino acid residues, respectively, were displayed on the outer surface of the 50S subunit, where they could interact with TF (Fig. 1A). The KD value for the binding of TF to non-translating (naked) ribosomes had previously been estimated as ∼1 μm (16Maier R. Eckert B. Scholz C. Lilie H. Schmid F.X. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 585-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 17Raine A. Ivanova N. Wikberg J.E. Ehrenberg M. Biochimie (Paris). 2004; 86: 495-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We found that increasing RpoB nascent chain length correlated with increasing affinity (decreasing KD value) of TF to the ribosome (Table 1). Accordingly, we estimated the KD values for TF binding to naked ribosomes, to RNCs with RpoB60, RpoB80, RpoB103, and RpoB133 as 1100, 690, 141, 71, and 53 nm, respectively (Fig. 2 and Table 1). To further visualize the TF binding, we ran an SDS gel showing the pelleted [35S]-TF in titration series with RpoB103 and naked 70S ribosomes (Fig. 2B).TABLE 1The KD values for TF binding to RpoB, Bop, and Lep RNCsRNCNascent chainKD%nmRpoB6060690 ± 77RpoB8060141 ± 13RpoB1006071 ± 7RpoB1335053 ± 9Bop8150670 ± 194Bop9850316 ± 66Bop13650422 ± 86Lep10060311 ± 11370S1100 ± 300 Open table in a new tab In control experiments, where puromycin was added to RpoB103 RNCs to release the nascent chains, KD increased to a value close to that observed for TF binding to naked ribosomes (Fig. 1C). This shows that the high affinity binding of TF to the RNCs related specifically to their nascent peptide chains. The Affinity of TF to Ribosomes with Lep and Bop Nascent Chains—Lep is an E. coli inner membrane protein (IMP) that is targeted to the membrane by SRP. Bop is an IMP from Halobacter halobium, also recognized by the E. coli SRP (22Raine A. Ullers R. Pavlov M. Luirink J. Wikberg J.E. Ehrenberg M. Biochimie (Paris). 2003; 85: 659-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Cross-linking experiments suggest binding interactions between TF and nascent IMPs, but whether TF has different affinity to those nascent chains that are recognized by SRP has remained unknown. To clarify this issue, we estimated the KD values for TF binding to ribosomes carrying ∼100-amino acid residue-long N-terminal peptides of Lep and Bop as 311 and 316 nm, respectively (Fig. 3 and Table 1). We found, in addition, that ribosomes carrying 81 and 136-amino acid residue-long nascent chains of Bop bound to TF with KD values of 670 and 422 nm, respectively (Fig. 3 and Table 1). Thus, for Bop the affinity increases ∼2-fold with an increase in nascent chain length from 81 to 98. These results imply that TF binds between 4.5 and 7 times more weakly to RNCs displaying nascent Lep and Bop than nascent RpoB chains of similar lengths (Fig. 4 and Table 1). From these results, we hypothesize that RNCs with nascent chains targeted by SRP have lower affinity to TF than RNCs with cytoplasm-targeted peptide chains. Comparison of those amino acid residues of RpoB, Bop, and Lep (Fig. 5A) that have emerged from the peptide exit tunnel and therefore are potentially available for TF interactions shows a slightly larger number of aromatic or basic residues in all the RpoB RNCs. Surprisingly, the number of negatively charged amino acids, suggested to disfavor TF binding (9Patzelt H. Rudiger S. Brehmer D. Kramer G. Vorderwulbecke S. Schaffitzel E. Waitz A. Hesterkamp T. Dong L. Schneider-Mergener J. Bukau B. Deuerling E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14244-14249Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), is actually larger in the RpoB than in the Bop and Lep RNCs. Furthermore, the nascent transmembrane domains of Lep and Bop are highly hydrophobic (see boxed regions in Fig. 5A), suggesting strong binding interaction with the hydrophobic surface of TF, in apparent contrast to what we actually observed. Thus, the amino acid sequences of the nascent RpoB, Bop, and Lep RNCs did not reveal why TF had comparatively high affinity to the RpoB RNCs, which could mean that structural differences between the nascent chains may account for the observed affinity differences.FIGURE 5A, comparison of the 100 N-terminal amino acid residues of RpoB, Lep, and Bop. RpoB has a slightly higher content of basic and aromatic residues but at the same time higher content of acidic residues than the Lep and Bop constructs used in this study. The Lep and Bop constructs are generally more hydrophobic than the RpoB nascent chains. The boxed regions represent predicted transmembrane regions in Lep and Bop. B, schematic picture of TF interacting with the 50S subunit and nascent polypeptides. TF arches over the peptide exit and a short nascent chain, like the N-terminal part of the 60-amino acid construct of RpoB used in this study, may be inside the folding cave of TF but does not induce a strong interaction. A longer nascent chain may make multiple contacts with the large hydrophobic surface of TF, which may be the reason for the observed increase in affinity. Nascent Lep and Bop exhibit low affinity for TF, possibly due to structural properties that disfavor TF interactions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We have observed that the affinity of TF to RpoB nascent chain ribosome complexes increases strongly with increasing RpoB peptide length (Table 1). This result is likely to be relevant for the function of TF, because successful folding of the RpoB protein in a Δtig strain depleted of DnaK/DnaJ is compromised (7Deuerling E. Patzelt H. Vorderwulbecke S. Rauch T. Kramer G. Schaffitzel E. Mogk A. Schulze-Specking A. Langen H. Bukau B. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 1317-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). We estimated equilibrium dissociation constants (KD values) for the binding of TF to RNCs with RpoB chains containing 60, 80, 103, and 133 amino acid residues. For comparison, we also estimated the KD values for TF binding to RNCs with membrane protein Bop sequences of lengths of 81, 98, and 136 amino acids as well as to an RNC with a membrane protein Lep sequence of 100 amino acids. Although cross-links have been observed between TF and nascent peptides as short as 57 amino acids (23Valent Q.A. Kendall D.A. High S. Kusters R. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5494-5505Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), TF bound to the RNC with the RpoB60 chain with an affinity only slightly higher than that found for TF binding to the naked ribosome. As the nascent chain became longer, the KD value decreased monotonically to a value of 53 nm for the RpoB133 chain. These results are in line with qualitative data showing that, although TF binding to naked ribosomes or free peptide chains is low, complexes formed between TF and RNCs are resistant to high salt treatment (24Hesterkamp T. Deuerling E. Bukau B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21865-21871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 25Hesterkamp T. Hauser S. Lutcke H. Bukau B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4437-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Our data are also in line with a proposal, based on the crystal structure of TF from E. coli (14Ferbitz L. Maier T. Patzelt H. Bukau B. Deuerling E. Ban N. Nature. 2004; 431: 590-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 26Ludlam A.V. Moore B.A. Xu Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13436-13441Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), that the binding cavity of TF has a large surface that can simultaneously interact with several stretches of a long nascent peptide (Fig. 5B). It is interesting in this context that a study involving nascent pOmpA chains only showed cross-linking between TF and peptide chains longer than 89 amino acids and increasing cross-linking efficiency with increasing nascent chain length (13Eisner G. Koch H.G. Beck K. Brunner J. Muller M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Our data on TF binding to RpoB agree less well with a model in which TF interacts with only one short peptide stretch at the time, although it cannot be definitely excluded that an increasing nascent chain length could somehow make a putative single site on TF successively more available for nascent chain binding. A structural corollary to these results regarding TF function comes from the crystal conformation of TF in combination with ribosome docking experiments (14Ferbitz L. Maier T. Patzelt H. Bukau B. Deuerling E. Ban N. Nature. 2004; 431: 590-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). These suggest that TF from its attachment point on ribosomal protein L23 bends over the nascent peptide exit tunnel, thereby creating a large hydrophobic surface that protects the nascent chain from other hydrophobic interactions. These structural data are in complete accordance with our biochemical data showing that the affinity of TF to nascent chains increases with their length all the way up to 133 amino acids (Table 1). In the present experiments the RNCs were stalled on trun-cated mRNAs and TF was added post-translationally, in contrast to the situation in the living cell where there may be no significant stalling and TF is present at all times. However, we believe that the substrate specificity revealed by our KD estimates (Table 1) may be functionally relevant and hence contribute significantly to clarification of the mechanism of action of TF. Both SRP and TF are in contact with ribosomal protein L23 as they interact with nascent peptides, and an important question is whether the two factors have complementary specificity for membrane- and cytoplasm-targeted sequences. Here we have found that the nascent membrane proteins Bop and Lep, both substrates for SRP, have considerably lower affinity to TF than nascent RpoB chains of similar lengths. From this finding we hypothesize that nascent chain substrates for SRP bind poorly to TF and vice versa. That is, in addition to the high affinity of SRP to nascent IMPs (27Flanagan J.J. Chen J.C. Miao Y. Shao Y. Lin J. Bock P.E. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18628-18637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), these chains also have low affinity to TF, which may further reduce target competition between SRP and TF. At the same time, TF is positioned close to the exit tunnel with significant affinity even to naked ribosomes, which readily explains the observed cross-links between TF and nascent IMPs (12Ullers R.S. Houben E.N. Raine A. ten Hagen-Jongman C.M. Ehrenberg M. Brunner J. Oudega B. Harms N. Luirink J. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 679-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Our preliminary search for differences in amino acid composition between the RpoB, Bop, and Lep nascent chains did not render any obvious explanation for why TF has lower affinity to Bop and Lep than to RpoB nascent chains. Accordingly, the observed affinity differences may originate in structural elements of the nascent chains rather than in their amino acid composition. This would be in line with the suggestion that nascent signal sequences bind to SRP in α-helical conformation as induced already in the exit tunnel (28Woolhead C.A. McCormick P.J. Johnson A.E. Cell. 2004; 116: 725-736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), whereas TF may, to speculate further, prefer extended peptide sequences. Future systematic studies of TF binding to different types of RNCs will be required to decide whether, in general, SRP and TF have complementary affinities to nascent peptides targeted for membrane and cytoplasm.

Ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) 3The abbreviations used are: RNR, ribonucleotide reductase; DTT, dithiothreitol. is an essential constituent of all living cells and organisms. It catalyzes the production of deoxyribonucleotides for DNA synthesis from their corresponding ribonucleotides and thereby controls a key step for cell growth and proliferation. In recent years it has also been recognized that RNR plays a key role in the transition from an RNA world to a DNA world. Surprisingly, there are at least three major classes of RNRs in contemporary organisms, differing primarily in cofactor requirements and quaternary structures (1Stubbe J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 731-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 2Poole A.M. Logan D.T. Sjöberg B.-M. J. Mol. Evol. 2002; 55: 180-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 3Torrents E.

Biochem. 2006; 75: 681-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). Yet a common theme among all three classes is a radical-based reaction mechanism. Recent structural studies have shown that the catalytic core regions of the three RNR classes are essentially identical (5Uhlin U. Eklund H. Nature. 1994; 370: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 6Logan D.T. Andersson J. Sjöberg B.-M. Nordlund P.

Biol. 2003; 330: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), strongly suggesting that all RNR classes have a common evolutionary origin. One signature of all RNRs is an elaborate allosteric regulation controlling the substrate specificities of the enzymes. The net result of the allosteric regulation is a balanced production of the four different deoxyribonucleotide products. Carefully equilibrated concentrations of the four dNTPs are required by all cells to avoid errors during DNA replication and repair (9Kunz B.A. Kohalmi S.E. Kunkel T.A. Mathews C.K. McIntosh E.M. Reidy J.A. Mutat. Res. 1994; 318: 1-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Binding sites for the allosteric effectors, which are ATP and several dNTPs, have been resolved in a number of RNR crystal structures (10Eriksson M. Uhlin U. Ramaswamy S. Ekberg M. Regnström K. Sjöberg B.-M. Eklund H. Structure (Lond.). 1997; 5: 1077-1092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 11Larsson K.M. Andersson J. Sjöberg B.-M. Nordlund P. Logan D.T.

Biol. 2004; 11: 1142-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and are comparatively close to the active site regions. Specific side chain and backbone movements may explain the general molecular basis for the allosteric regulation of substrate specificity. Another allosteric fine tuning of RNRs concerns the overall activity of ribonucleotide reduction, and the presence of this type of control differs between the different RNR classes and also within the classes. The overall activity control was first localized to the N-terminal region of the Escherichia coli R1 (or NrdA) component and forms a separate globular domain consisting of four α-helices and three β-strands (10Eriksson M. Uhlin U. Ramaswamy S. Ekberg M. Regnström K. Sjöberg B.-M. Eklund H. Structure (Lond.). 1997; 5: 1077-1092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). This domain binds ATP as a positive allosteric effector and dATP as a negative effector. Recently similar domains were found in several different proteins, and the motif was termed ATP-cone (13Aravind L. Wolf Y.I. Koonin E.V. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2000; 2: 191-194PubMed Google Scholar). Most of the conserved residues of the ATP-cone are involved in stabilizing the secondary structure elements, indicating that all sequences adopt the same structure and presumably bind ATP. The presence or absence of an ATP-cone in the N-terminal region of RNR is one basis for dividing the class I RNRs into subclasses Ia (with the ATP-cone) and Ib (lacking the ATP-cone). Many class II RNRs lack the ATP-cone, whereas most class III RNRs include an ATP-cone. In addition, groups of organisms have RNRs that diverge from this general presence or absence of ATP-cone, e.g. the Herpesviridae carry an ATP-cone that has lost its capacity to bind nucleotides. Among the eubacterial species there are a few examples of organisms that carry more than one ATP-cone. The most striking example is that all known Chlamydiaceae have an N-terminal triplication of their ATP-cone (14Roshick C. Iliffe-Lee E.R. McClarty G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38111-38119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and some proteobacteria have a duplication of the ATP-cone. One example of an ATP-cone duplication is found in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a γ-proteobacterium that encodes three different classes of RNR, Ia, II, and III (15Jordan A. Torrents E. Sala I. Hellman U. Gibert I. Reichard P. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3974-3980Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown earlier that all three RNR classes in P. aeruginosa are expressed, albeit at different growth conditions, and are enzymatically functional (15Jordan A. Torrents E. Sala I. Hellman U. Gibert I. Reichard P. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3974-3980Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Torrents E. Poplawski A. Sjöberg B.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16571-16578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). All class Ia RNRs consist of two different components, NrdA and NrdB. The active site region where the substrates bind is found in the NrdA component, whereas the NrdB component harbors a stable tyrosyl radical that is needed to initiate the radical-based catalysis. The aim of this work was to understand why a duplication of the allosteric activity site is present in P. aeruginosa NrdA (see Fig. 1A) and to study its possible role in the allosteric and biochemical properties of the pure enzyme system. Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, and Materials—E. coli DH5α (Clontech) was used for cloning and propagation of plasmids. E. coli Rosetta (DE3) (Novagen) was used for protein overexpression. Wild type P. aeruginosa PAO1 strain (ATCC15692/CECT4122) obtained from the Spanish National Collection of Type Cultures was used for genomic DNA purification. All strains were grown at 37 °C in LB medium. Plasmid vectors used were pGEM-T Easy (Promega) for cloning of PCR-amplified fragments and pET22b (Novagen) for protein overexpression. Oligonucleotide primers were from Invitrogen. Restriction endonucleases and other enzymes were from Fermentas. General DNA and Protein Techniques—Molecular cloning techniques were by standard procedures (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Genomic DNA of P. aeruginosa PAO1 was isolated using the DNeasy tissue kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Construction of Overproduction Strains—All constructs were cloned into the overexpression plasmid pET22b. The entire wild type nrdA gene was amplified from genomic DNA by PCR using the following primers: forward OP-NrdA1up, 5′-ACATATGCATACCGACACCACACG-3′, and reverse OP-NrdAlw, 5′-TAAGCTTGCCCGGCCGCGACACGGAC-3′. The primers were designed to generate an NdeI and HindIII restriction site (underlined), respectively, at the start and end of the resulting amplified fragment. The 2937-bp PCR product was cloned in the pGEM-T Easy vector. After digestion with NdeI and HindIII, the nrdA fragment was ligated into pET22b generating plasmid pETS141. The following primers (underlining shows the NdeI restriction site) were used for PCR amplification of the different nrdA fragments and the nrdB gene: for nrdAΔ147, forward OP-NrdA2up, 5′-ACATATGCGCATCACCCGCGCCG-3′, and reverse OP-NrdAlw; for nrdAΔ182, forward OP-NrdA3up, 5′-ACATATGATCGAGCGCGAGACCC-3′, and reverse OP-NrdAlw; and for nrdB, forward OP-NrdBup, 5′-GAGCCATATGCTGAGCTGGGACG-3′, and reverse OP-NrdBlw, 5′-AGGATCCTAAATCGAGCATCTCAATCC-3′ (this underlining shows a BamHI restriction site). All amplified fragments were cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector as described previously. The NdeI-HindIII-digested DNA fragments nrdAΔ147 (2499 bp) and nrdAΔ182 (2385 bp) were cloned into the pET22b generating pETS142 and pETS143, respectively. The NdeI-BamHI-digested nrdB DNA fragment (1268 bp) was cloned into pET22b generating plasmid pETS144. All four pETS clones were sequenced in both directions to assure the lack of mutations during the PCR amplification and cloning steps. Overproduction and Purification—The E. coli Rosetta (DE3) cells containing any of the pETS141, pETS142, pETS143, and pETS144 were grown in LB medium (Difco) with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 17 μg/ml chloramphenicol. The cultures were grown with vigorous shaking (250 rpm) at 30 °C. When cells reached an A550 of ≈0.5 expression of the cloned gene was induced by the addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.5 mm. After 4 h of induction the cells were harvested by centrifugation, and cell pellets were frozen on dry ice and stored at –80 °C. All the protein purification steps were carried out at 4 °C. All RNR proteins used in this study were purified using the same procedure. Frozen cells were disintegrated by X-press (Biox AB); homogenized; extracted with 4 volumes (v/w) of buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 30 mm KCl, 10 mm DTT, and Complete protease mixture inhibitor (Roche Applied Science); and centrifuged for 1 h at 40,000 × g. Nucleic acids were precipitated by addition of streptomycin sulfate to a final concentration of 1% and removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was precipitated by slow addition of ammonium sulfate to 45% final saturation. After centrifugation the precipitate was dissolved in 5 ml of buffer A (0.75 m ammonium sulfate, 5 mm DTT). Around 200 mg of total protein was applied to a HiLoad™ 16/10 Phenyl Sepharose™ High Performance column (GE Healthcare) on a BioLogic DuoFlow System fast protein liquid chromatography instrument (Bio-Rad) previously equilibrated with 10 volumes of buffer A. The different RNR components (wild type NrdA and NrdB and truncated NrdA proteins) were eluted with a linear gradient of ammonium sulfate (0.75–0 m, 1 ml/min) in buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm DTT). After SDS-PAGE fractions with the highest purity were concentrated using Centricon filters (Millipore). NrdB protein was further purified by ion exchange chromatography. Pooled fractions were diluted to 5 mg/ml protein concentration and loaded on a HiLoad 16/10 Q-Sepharose High Performance column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with buffer B plus 30 mm KCl. NrdB protein was eluted with a linear gradient of KCl (30 to 300 mm, 3 ml/min) in buffer B. Fractions containing the NrdB protein were pooled, concentrated using Centricon 30 (Millipore), and step-by-step the buffer was exchanged to buffer B. NrdAΔ182 protein was purified as described for the NrdB protein followed by gel filtration chromatography. Pooled fractions from the ion exchange purification were loaded at 0.5 ml/min on a 24-ml Superdex™-75 column equilibrated and eluted with buffer B plus 200 mm KCl. Each fraction was analyzed by Phastgel electrophoresis (GE Healthcare), and fractions with the highest purity were pooled, concentrated using Centriprep-50 (Millipore), and finally freed from KCl by washing with buffer B. Iron Reconstitution of P. aeruginosa NrdB for Enzymatic Assays—NrdB protein was reconstituted at 25 °C by reaction with anaerobic ferrous iron ascorbate solution under aerobic conditions as described previously (18Atkin C.L. Thelander L. Reichard P. Lang G. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 7464-7472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with a molar ratio of three irons/NrdB polypeptide. After 5 min the reaction mixture was desalted on a NAP-10 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with buffer B and concentrated with Centricon 30 (Millipore). Gel Filtration in the Presence of Effector Nucleotides—A 2-ml column of Superdex-200 (GE Healthcare) was used to estimate the molecular mass of the NrdA, NrdAΔ147, and NrdB proteins alone or in combination. Proteins at 1.25, 2.5, and 5 mg/ml were chromatographed at 0.1 ml/min in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm DTT, 100 mm NaCl, and 5 mm ATP. The column had been standardized with thyroglobulin (669 kDa), apoferritin (443 kDa), β-amylase (200 kDa), and alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), all supplied from Sigma. To estimate the relative proportions of NrdA versus NrdB components in the holoenzyme complexes, eluted protein peaks were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by densitometric analyses. Enzymatic Assay and Other Analytical Techniques—Standard conditions for the enzyme assay included the use of 0.7 mm [3H]CDP (10,775 cpm/pmol), 5 mm ATP, 30 mm DTT, 30 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 30 nmol of NrdA, and 60 nmol of NrdB in a final volume of 50 μl. Incubation was at 25 °C for 20 min, and the amount of dCDP formed was determined by the standard method as described previously (19Thelander L. Sjöberg B.-M. Eriksson S. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 51: 227-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). One unit of enzyme corresponds to 1 nmol of product formed/min, and the specific activity is expressed as units/mg of total protein. KL, KD, and Vmax values were obtained by direct curve fitting as described before (20Climent I. Sjöberg B.-M. Huang C.Y.

UV-Visible Absorption Spectroscopy and Formation and Decay of Radical-Diiron Site—Stopped flow spectroscopy was applied to study formation of the radical-diiron site. Kinetic traces were registered every 5th nm in the region 440–350 nm using a DX 18MV BioSequential stopped flow ASVD spectrometer (Applied Photophysics) and a split time base of 2/20 s. Equal volumes of 80 μm apoNrdB polypeptide (aerobic) and 80 μm Fe2+ (anaerobic) were mixed at 25 °C, and 55 μl of each reactant were used per shot. Scanning spectra were registered on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Lambda2 spectrometer at 25 °C. Typically 20 μm NrdB polypeptide in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, was used. For reconstitution 1–6 μl of 5 mm Fe2+ in 0.1 m HCl was added to 500 μlof protein solution giving 0.5–3 Fe2+/NrdB polypeptide. Spectra were registered before addition of Fe2+, and the formation and decay of absorption bands were observed between 300 and 500 nm in cycles of 90 s with a scanning rate of 240 nm/min. The tyrosyl radical concentration at different time points was determined by subtracting an “end point” spectrum at approximately 30 min after iron addition from the spectrum immediately after iron addition, giving a tyrosyl radical absorption at 413 nm (supplemental Fig. S1) that was quantified using the extinction coefficient 3.25 mm–1 cm–1 (23Petersson L. Gräslund A. Ehrenberg A. Sjöberg B.-M. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 6706-6712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For experiments measuring iron content during radical decay 1.2 ml of apoNrdB was reconstituted with 1.5 iron/polypeptide because a higher iron-to-protein ratio gave less well resolved spectra. After one, two, five, nine, and 15 scans (i.e. after 70, 190, 560, 1040, and 1500 s) 110 μl was withdrawn, mixed with 2 μl of 15 mm EDTA, desalted on a NAP-5 column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, and used for analyses of iron and protein concentrations. The registered spectra (Fig. 3, inset) were used to calculate the tyrosyl radical after subtraction as described above. EPR Spectroscopy—EPR spectra were registered on an ESP 300 X-band spectrometer (Bruker) equipped with a liquid nitrogen flow system for temperatures ≥90 K. Radical concentrations were determined using a Bacillus anthracis NrdF sample and an E. coli NrdB sample with known tyrosyl radical concentrations as secondary standards. The error limits for radical quantitations are ≤±10%. Nucleotide Binding Assay—Nucleotide binding was performed according to the method of direct partition through ultrafiltration (24Ormö M. Sjöberg B.-M. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 189: 138-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The experiments were carried out at 25 °C using a range of 0.5–100 μm NrdA and NrdAΔ147 polypeptide and 0.5–100 μm dATP/ATP. Atypical Class Ia RNR in P. aeruginosa—The nrdA and nrdB genes code for the class Ia RNR that is active only during aerobic conditions (15Jordan A. Torrents E. Sala I. Hellman U. Gibert I. Reichard P. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3974-3980Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Torrents E. Poplawski A. Sjöberg B.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16571-16578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The nrdA gene (2892 bp) encodes a protein of 963 amino acid residues with an expected molecular mass of 107 kDa. The nrdB gene (1248 bp) encodes a protein of 415 amino acid residues with an expected molecular mass of 47 kDa. Whereas the NrdB protein overall is similar to other NrdB proteins, the NrdA protein revealed interesting differences compared with other well known class Ia RNRs. The deduced amino acid sequence of P. aeruginosa NrdA is 202 residues longer than the 761-residue E. coli class Ia prototype. Alignment of these two proteins shows that most of the extra amino acids (around 155 residues) are located at the N terminus of the protein (Fig. 1A). The remaining 47 residues are found in the C-terminal part of the protein. All the essential cysteine residues known to be involved in catalysis and enzyme turnover and other residues that are functionally important in class I proteins are present in the deduced P. aeruginosa NrdA protein (data not shown). Comparison of the NrdA against the Pfam data base (25Finn R.D. Mistry J. Schuster-Bockler B. Griffiths-Jones S. Hollich V. Lassmann T. Moxon S. Marshall M. Khanna A. Durbin R. Eddy S.R. Sonnhammer E.L. Bateman A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: D247-D251Crossref PubMed Scopus (1844) Google Scholar) revealed high similarity to the RNR central core (residues 293–910, Pfam02867; E value, 5 × e–187) and to an ATP-cone domain (residues 32–132 (denoted ATP-c1), Pfam03477; E value, 3 × e–28) described previously as the allosteric site regulating the overall enzyme activity of the enzyme (10Eriksson M.

With a lower similarity (E value, 5 × e–3) we found another ATP-cone structure between the two structures previously identified (residues 151–250, denoted ATP-c2). The amino acid sequence of the N-terminal region of P. aeruginosa NrdA (Fig. 1B) implies a duplication of the residues for a putative activity site domain. As shown in Fig. 1B, several residues responsible for the nucleotide binding (10Eriksson M. Uhlin U. Ramaswamy S. Ekberg M. Regnström K. Sjöberg B.-M. Eklund H. Structure (Lond.). 1997; 5: 1077-1092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) are present in both putative allosteric domains (ATP-c1 and ATP-c2). To study whether both domains can bind nucleotides and regulate the overall activity of the enzyme two different constructions were made (Fig. 1A), and their biochemical and allosteric properties were studied. Purification of Wild Type P. aeruginosa Proteins and Trun-cated NrdA Proteins—The full-length P. aeruginosa nrdA gene product and two engineered variants of truncated nrdA, designated NrdAΔ147 and NrdAΔ182, were overproduced in E. coli. The P. aeruginosa NrdAΔ147 protein (816 residues) lacks the first activity site (ATP-c1). The NrdAΔ182 (781 residues) lacks the first and part of the second activity site domain (ATP-c2) and corresponds in size and protein sequence to the class Ib NrdE proteins (Fig. 1A). The P. aeruginosa nrdB gene was also expressed in E. coli. Different purification steps were carried out for each protein (see “Experimental Procedures”) yielding ∼8.5 mg of pure protein/liter of culture for the NrdA wild type, 17.6 mg/liter for the NrdAΔ147, and 22.5 mg/liter for the NrdB purification. After several purification steps for the NrdAΔ182 protein we obtained only a partially purified fraction (around 60% purity) with a yield of 2.5 mg/liter of culture. SDS-PAGE of the purified proteins gave only one band for NrdA wild type, NrdAΔ147, and NrdB with apparent polypeptide sizes similar to the theoretical molecular masses of the cloned genes (107, 91, and 47 kDa, respectively; Fig. 2). One of the two prominent bands in the NrdAΔ182 preparation also corresponds to its theoretical molecular mass (88 kDa; Fig. 2, lane 3). Western blot analysis using polyclonal antibodies against the wild type P. aeruginosa NrdA protein confirmed that only the 88-kDa band is an NrdA protein product (data not shown). General Biochemical Properties of the Purified NrdA Proteins—None of the purified proteins had any RNR activity on their own (data not shown). Combinations of either NrdA wild type or NrdAΔ147 proteins with reconstituted NrdB protein (see below and Table 1) exhibited specific class Ia RNR enzyme activity. Using ATP as positive allosteric effector and DTT as an artificial electron donor for this system we obtained a specific activity of 88 units/mg for the NrdA wild type and 96 units/mg for the NrdAΔ147. The preferred substrate for this system is nucleoside diphosphates with a Km for CDP of 27 ± 8 μm for both NrdA wild type and NrdAΔ147. A calculated half-maximal activity was obtained at 7.9 mm DTT for the NrdA wild type protein and at 3.6 mm for NrdAΔ147.TABLE 1Radical content and specific activity of P. aeruginosa NrdB as a function of added iron during reconstitutionIron added per NrdBaThe NrdB concentration was 20 μm monomer.Radical contentEnzyme activitybAssays were performed with 30 nmol of NrdA and 60 nmol of NrdB; detection limit, 3-4 milliunits (mU).mol/molμmmU0cNrdB apoprotein contains 0.12 ± 0.02 mol of iron/mol of NrdB polypeptide.0≤26bAssays were performed with 30 nmol of NrdA and 60 nmol of NrdB; detection limit, 3-4 milliunits (mU).0.52.118514.22801.55.235025.52802.55.737435.34033 (after ≈90 min, plus desalting)dSample treated as for normal assay conditions; overestimation of the radical content because line shape is slightly distorted.<<0.8335a The NrdB concentration was 20 μm monomer.b Assays were performed with 30 nmol of NrdA and 60 nmol of NrdB; detection limit, 3-4 milliunits (mU).c NrdB apoprotein contains 0.12 ± 0.02 mol of iron/mol of NrdB polypeptide.d Sample treated as for normal assay conditions; overestimation of the radical content because line shape is slightly distorted. Open table in a new tab No activity was detected when NrdAΔ182 was assayed together with the reconstituted NrdB protein. Competition assays of the wild type NrdA protein with different amounts of NrdAΔ182 showed no inhibition of the wild type protein activity (data not shown) suggesting that the NrdAΔ182 protein cannot bind to the NrdB protein. Because of the lack of enzymatic activity with the NrdAΔ182 protein no further experiments were carried out with this protein. The Tyrosyl Radical in P. aeruginosa NrdB Protein Forms and Decays Rapidly—The purified NrdB protein contained no tyrosyl radical and no diiron site as determined from EPR, light absorption, and iron analysis. Reconstitution of purified NrdB apoprotein with Fe2+/O2 gave a spectrum with characteristic diiron-oxo charge transfer bands at 325 and 370 nm and a prominent tyrosyl radical band at 413 nm (Fig. 3, inset, top spectrum). Stopped flow experiments showed that the major fraction of the radical and the diiron site formed w"

This raises the question of whether analogous active-site side chains play equivalent roles in the bypass polymerases and their classical DNA polymerase counterparts. In Klenow fragment, an A-family DNA polymerase, the steric gate side chain (Glu710) not only prevents ribonucleotide incorporation but also plays an important role in discrimination against purine-pyrimidine mispairs. In this work we show that the steric gate (Phe12) of the Y-family polymerase Dbh plays a very minor role in fidelity, despite its analogous role in sugar selection. Using ribonucleotide discrimination to report on the positioning of a mispaired dNTP, we found that the pyrimidine of a Pu-dPyTP nascent mispair occupies a similar position to that of a correctly paired dNTP in the Dbh active site, whereas in Klenow fragment the mispaired dNTP sits higher in the active site pocket. If purine-pyrimidine mispairs adopt the expected wobble geometry, the difference between the two polymerases can be attributed to the binding of the templating base, with the looser binding site of Dbh permitting a variety of template conformations with only minimal adjustment at the incoming dNTP. In Klenow fragment the templating base is more rigidly held, so that changes in base pair geometry would affect the dNTP position, allowing the Glu710 side chain to serve as a sensor of nascent mispairs.

(DinB homologue) is a Y-family DNA polymerase from the thermophilic archaebacterium Sulfolobus acidocaldarius. Y-family polymerases comprise a diverse group of low fidelity enzymes that are specialized for a mode of DNA synthesis that involves bypass of DNA damage or helix distortions (1Ohmori H.

The global subdomain arrangements of Y-family polymerases are similar to the “right-hand” structures previously described for high fidelity polymerases but, compared with high fidelity polymerases, bypass polymerases have a more open active site with fewer contacts to the DNA and nucleotide substrates. Moreover, the Y-family polymerase structures do not show evidence for a conformational transition of the fingers subdomain analogous to the fingers-closing motion that allows higher fidelity polymerases to envelop the nascent base pair in an extremely snug binding pocket (11Li Y.

The more open active site of the Y-family polymerases is thought to facilitate lesion bypass at the expense of compromising polymerase fidelity (18Goodman M.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 17-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). Despite the difference in active site tightness between bypass and high fidelity polymerases, we have shown that Dbh discriminates against ribonucleotides with a stringency similar to that seen in A- and B-family DNA polymerases and reverse transcriptases (19DeLucia A.M. Grindley N.D.F. Joyce C.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 4129-4137Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In all cases, selection of the appropriate (deoxyribose) sugar is mediated by the so-called “steric gate” side chain, located on the floor of the binding pocket, which makes an unfavorable interaction with the 2′-OH group of an incoming rNTP (19DeLucia A.M.

The steric gate residue is an invariant glutamate (Glu710 in Klenow fragment) in A-family polymerases, an invariant tyrosine in B-family polymerases, and it is conserved as Phe or Tyr in the Y-family and reverse transcriptases. Previous work established that Glu710 of Klenow fragment not only functions in sugar selection but also plays an important role in fidelity by providing discrimination against purine-pyrimidine mismatches (20Astatke M. Ng K. Grindley N.D.F. Joyce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3402-3407Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 26Minnick D.T. Liu L. Grindley N.D.F. Kunkel T.A. Joyce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1194-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The E710A mutant of Klenow fragment is a strong mutator for errors in which an incoming pyrimidine nucleotide is mispaired opposite a template purine (Pu-dPyTP mispairs). Kinetic studies with wild-type and E710A Klenow fragment led to a model for the binding of purine-pyrimidine mismatches at the active site, in which Glu710 plays an important role in excluding mismatches from the nascent base pair binding pocket (26Minnick D.T. Liu L. Grindley N.D.F. Kunkel T.A. Joyce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1194-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In the current study, we explore how the active site of a bypass polymerase (Dbh) compares with that of a high fidelity DNA polymerase (Klenow fragment) by investigating whether the steric gate side chain (Phe12) of Dbh plays a role in purinepyrimidine mismatch fidelity analogous to that of Klenow fragment Glu710. Because dNTP/rNTP discrimination reports the position of the incoming nucleotide relative to the steric gate side chain (19DeLucia A.M. Grindley N.D.F. Joyce C.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 4129-4137Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), we have used this as a diagnostic for the geometry of nascent mispairs bound to Dbh and Klenow fragment. Our findings suggest there are significant differences in the way these two DNA polymerases accommodate nascent mispairs. Materials—DNA oligonucleotides were synthesized by the Keck Biotechnology Resource Laboratory at Yale Medical School. Duplex DNA substrates for kinetic experiments, 5′-labeled on the primer strand, were prepared by annealing appropriate template and primer strands. Ultrapure dNTPs and rNTPs were purchased from Amersham Biosciences, except for rTTP, which was from TriLink Biotechnologies. Purification of Dbh (wild-type and F12A) and 3′-5′ exonuclease-deficient Klenow fragment (D424A) proteins followed our standard procedures (19DeLucia A.M. Grindley N.D.F. Joyce C.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 4129-4137Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 27Joyce C.M. Derbyshire V. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 3-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Klenow fragment derivatives relevant to this work all carry the D424A mutation but are described here simply by the genotype of their polymerase domain. Kinetic Measurements—All kinetic measurements were carried out under single turnover conditions, using a rapid quench-flow instrument (KinTek Corp., model RQF-3) for reactions that were too fast to stop by manual quenching. For Klenow fragment, reactions were carried out at 22 °C as described previously (26Minnick D.T. Liu L. Grindley N.D.F. Kunkel T.A. Joyce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1194-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). For Dbh, measurements were made at 37 °C, based on our published methods (2Potapova O. Grindley N.D.F. Joyce C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28157-28166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 19DeLucia A.M. Grindley N.D.F. Joyce C.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 4129-4137Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Reactions were initiated by mixing equal volumes of a dNTP or rNTP solution with a preincubated Dbh-DNA solution. In each reaction extra MgCl2 (equimolar with the dNTP or rNTP) was provided in addition to the 10 mm MgCl2 already present in the Dbh reaction buffer. All reaction products were analyzed as described previously (2Potapova O. Grindley N.D.F. Joyce C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28157-28166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Misinsertion Kinetics for Wild-type and F12A Dbh—To investigate whether the steric gate residue (Phe12) of Dbh plays a role in polymerase fidelity that is analogous to that of the steric gate residue (Glu710) in Klenow fragment, we measured the discrimination against T-dGTP and G-dTTP misinsertions by wild-type and F12A Dbh (Table 1). The rate of incorporation (kobs) of the correct and incorrect nucleotide was measured at a series of nucleotide concentrations under single-turnover conditions at 37 °C. From plots of the first-order rate constant (kobs) as a function of nucleotide concentration, we determined the maximum rate of nucleotide incorporation (kpol) and nucleotide binding affinity (Kd) for the Dbh-DNA complex (Fig. 1). Selection against formation of T-dGTP or G-dTTP mispairs was calculated by dividing the efficiency (kpol/Kd) for correct nucleotide addition by the efficiency for incorrect nucleotide addition.TABLE 1Pre-steady-state insertion kinetics for wild-type and F12A Dbh The DNA substrate was as follows, 5′-TGGGTAACGCCAGGGTTTTCTCAGT 3′-ACCCATTGCGGTCCCAAAAGAGTCAXTGCTGCA where X was the templating base appropriate for each determination.

For both mismatches, the differences in dNTP binding between the correct and incorrect nucleotide were small (3-7-fold) compared with the changes in rate of nucleotide addition (300-540-fold), showing that transition state interactions are the main source of selectivity against these mispairs. Mutation of the steric gate residue, Phe12, to alanine had very little effect on the level of discrimination against either the T-dGTP or G-dTTP mismatch. In each case, the decrease in incorporation efficiency due to the F12A mutation was similar in magnitude for the correct base pair and the corresponding mispair, resulting in no overall change in fidelity. For both the template-T and template-G substrate, the F12A mutation caused a modest decrease (3-5-fold) in binding affinity for the correct dNTP but did not affect binding of the incorrect nucleotide. The F12A mutation also caused a moderate decrease (3-20-fold) in the rate of dNTP addition. The rate decrease was larger for misincorporation than for correct nucleotide addition; when combined with the opposing effect of F12A on nucleotide binding, this accounts for the negligible effect of this mutation on fidelity. Use of rNTP Discrimination to Report on Positioning of Wobble Mispairs—We used the level of discrimination against rNTP incorporation to report on the positioning of nascent mispairs at the polymerase active sites of Dbh and Klenow fragment. The selectivity for dNTPs over rNTPs depends on the positioning of the 2′-OH on the sugar of the incoming nucleotide relative to the steric gate side chain. If an incoming incorrect nucleotide occupies a similar position to that of the corresponding correct nucleotide, then both incorporation reactions should show similar selectivity for the nucleotide sugar. An increase in dNTP/rNTP selectivity in a misinsertion reaction would imply that the incorrect incoming nucleotide is closer to the steric gate side chain than a correctly paired nucleotide; the opposite conclusion would be inferred from a decrease in selectivity. We assessed the dNTP/rNTP selectivity of wild-type Dbh by comparing the rates of polymerase-catalyzed incorporation at a single concentration of 10 mm nucleotide (Table 2). We adopted this approach, rather than determining individual kpol and Kd values, because our previous studies (2Potapova O. Grindley N.D.F. Joyce C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28157-28166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 19DeLucia A.M. Grindley N.D.F. Joyce C.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 4129-4137Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and this work (Table 1) indicated that changes in the reaction substrates primarily affect the rate of nucleotide addition and have little influence on the rather weak nucleotide binding affinity of Dbh. The rate constants are reported as kobs, not kpol, values because the nucleotide binding of Dbh is not saturated at 10 mm (see Fig. 1). Comparison of the rate constants at 10 and 2 mm nucleotide, for each reaction, supported our expectation that there would be no dramatic changes in nucleotide binding affinity in this series of experiments. For the majority of the reactions, the rate at 2 mm nucleotide was about 40% of that at 10 mm, consistent with a Kd of around 6 mm. For correct dNTP incorporation by wild-type Dbh, the rate at 2 mm was 60 to 70% of that at 10 mm, indicating a Kd of 1-2 mm.TABLE 2rNTP discrimination in correct and wobble base pairs by wild-type Dbh The DNA substrate was as follows, 5′-TGGGTAACGCCAGGGTTTTCTCAGT 3′-ACCCATTGCGGTCCCAAAAGAGTCAXTGCTGCA where X was the templating base, as appropriate.

Grindley N.D.F. Joyce C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28157-28166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). (Table 2). For an incoming pyrimidine mispaired opposite a template purine, the rNTP discrimination was slightly lower than for the corresponding correct base pair. When the incoming nucleotide was a purine, rNTP discrimination was essentially the same regardless of whether or not the nucleotide was correctly paired with the templating base. As expected, the absence of the steric gate side chain, in the F12A Dbh mutant, resulted in very little discrimination against rNTPs (less than 10-fold) in all reactions tested (data not shown). Klenow fragment, with a more constrained nucleotide binding pocket than Dbh, normally binds a correct nucleotide with ∼100-fold higher affinity than does Dbh. Therefore the consequences of mispair geometry (reported by rNTP discrimination) at the active site of Klenow fragment may be seen both at the level of nucleotide binding and nucleotide incorporation rate. We compared the single-turnover kinetics for rGTP and rUTP incorporation in correct and wobble mispairs by Klenow fragment at a series of nucleotide concentrations so as to determine kpol and Kd (Table 3). As with Dbh, selection against rNTP addition in a base pair with an incorrect incoming purine (T-d/rGTP) was very similar to dGTP/rGTP discrimination in a correct base pair. However, with the opposite arrangement, an incoming pyrimidine mispaired with a template purine, ribonucleotide discrimination was substantially reduced, with the discrimination between dTTP and rUTP ∼300-fold lower when mispaired with G than when correctly paired with A. The decrease in dTTP/rUTP discrimination was entirely due to changes in ground-state interactions. Because discrimination by Klenow fragment against rUTP has been observed to be particularly high (Table 3 and Ref. 20Astatke M. Ng K. Grindley N.D.F. Joyce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3402-3407Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), we repeated the measurements with rTTP. The results were very similar to those obtained with rUTP, ruling out any unusual effects due to the thymine 5-methyl group.TABLE 3rNTP discrimination in correct and wobble base pairs by Klenow fragmentCorrect d/rNTP discriminationIncorrect d/rNTP discriminationSubstratesKd (μm)kpol (s–1)kpol/Kd (m–1 s–1)SelectivityaCalculated as (kpol/Kd)deoxy/(kpol/Kd)riboKd (μm)kpol (s–1)kpol/Kd (m–1 s–1)SelectivityaCalculated as (kpol/Kd)deoxy/(kpol/Kd)riboA-dT/rUTPbThe DNA substrate was as follows, 5′–TGGGTAACGCCAGGGTTTTCTCAGT 3′–ACCCATTGCGGTCCCAAAAGAGTCAXTGCTGCA where X was A or G, as appropriateG-dT/rUTPbThe DNA substrate was as follows, 5′–TGGGTAACGCCAGGGTTTTCTCAGT 3′–ACCCATTGCGGTCCCAAAAGAGTCAXTGCTGCA where X was A or G, as appropriatedTTPcSingle determination for dNTP parameters except for T-dGTP incorporation data which are from ref. 26.

Grindley N.D.F. Joyce C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28157-28166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Relative to wild-type Klenow fragment, mismatch discrimination by wild-type Dbh is 25-fold less for G-dTTP and 5-fold less for T-dGTP misinsertions (Table 1 and Ref. 26Minnick D.T. Liu L. Grindley N.D.F. Kunkel T.A. Joyce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1194-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Like Klenow fragment, Dbh shows greater discrimination against G-dTTP mispairs than T-dGTP mispairs (26Minnick D.T. Liu L. Grindley N.D.F. Kunkel T.A. Joyce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1194-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). For both mispairs in this study, discrimination by Dbh derives largely from differences in reaction rate, consistent with other kinetic studies of Y-family polymerases (4Fiala K.A. Suo Z. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2106-2115Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 28Washington M.T. Prakash L. Prakash S.

Chem. 2005; 280: 40552-40558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that the steric gate residue, Phe12, of Dbh plays very little role in purine-pyrimidine mismatch fidelity, in contrast to the steric gate residue, Glu710, of Klenow fragment. The E710A Klenow fragment is a mutator for Pu-dPyTP mismatches, and the ∼100-fold loss in selectivity responsible for this phenotype results from the complete loss of discrimination in dNTP binding and ∼10-fold lower selectivity in kpol, relative to wild-type Klenow fragment (26Minnick D.T. Liu L. Grindley N.D.F. Kunkel T.A. Joyce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1194-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). With the opposite mismatch, Py-dPuTP, E710A shows substantial changes in the individual kpol and Kd values compared with wild-type Klenow fragment. Nevertheless, E710A is not a mutator for Py-dPuTP errors because the kpol and Kd changes are in opposite directions, reflecting tighter binding of the mispaired purine but a severely compromised catalytic rate. In contrast to E710A Klenow fragment, the F12A mutation in Dbh results in similar decreases in overall activity, regardless of whether the incoming nucleotide is correct or mismatched (Table 1). The only observation that hints at a role for Phe12 in mismatch recognition is a slight trend in the Kd(dNTP) values for both mismatches tested. Binding of the correctly paired dNTP by wild-type Dbh is tighter (by 3-7-fold) than binding by the F12A mutant or binding by either protein of an incoming mismatched dNTP, perhaps indicating a weak interaction that is compromised either in the absence of Phe12 or in a mismatched nascent base pair. The ribonucleotide discrimination data, which report on the position of the incoming nucleotide, provide a plausible explanation for the different roles of the steric gate side chain in Klenow fragment and Dbh (Tables 2 and 3). In Dbh the dNTP/rNTP discrimination is similar regardless of whether or not the incoming nucleotide is correctly paired with the template base. This indicates that the position of the sugar of an incoming dNTP relative to Phe12 is approximately the same in either situation and therefore that the Phe12 side chain would not be an effective sensor of nascent mispairs. Conversely, the ribonucleotide data for Klenow fragment imply that an incoming dTTP is further from the steric gate side chain when mispaired opposite G than when correctly paired opposite A. The favorable interaction of the nucleotide with Glu710 is therefore less in the mispair and Glu710 serves as a discriminator against Pu-dPyTP errors. This discrimination is lost in the E710A mutant, accounting for its mutator phenotype. Two possible reasons underlying the different properties of steric gate mutants of Klenow fragment and Dbh, one structural and the other mechanistic, are examined below. Active Site Structure—The structural explanation assumes that the misincorporation pathway proceeds via a ternary complex that resembles the ternary complexes seen with correctly paired incoming dNTPs, with appropriate adjustments to accommodate the mispair. In Klenow fragment, the ribonucleotide discrimination data imply that an incoming dTTP sits higher in the active site binding pocket when mispaired with G than when correctly paired with A. This is consistent with the structural model proposed in our earlier study of the E710A mutant (26Minnick D.T. Liu L. Grindley N.D.F. Kunkel T.A. Joyce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1194-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), in which we hypothesized that nascent Pu-Py mispairs would adopt the wobble geometry seen in the structures of Pu-Py mismatches in duplex DNA (30Hunter W.N. Brown T. Kneale G. Anand N.N. Rabinovich D. Kennard O. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9962-9970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Hunter W.N. Brown T. Anand N.N. Kennard O. Nature. 1986; 320: 552-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Compared with Watson-Crick base pairs, the wobble mismatches are more asymmetric, with the pyrimidine partner displaced toward the major groove and the purine partner displaced toward the minor groove (Fig. 2A). Thus, the predicted location of a mispaired dPyTP would be further from the floor of the binding pocket, compared with a correctly paired dNTP (Fig. 2B), entirely consistent with the reduced dNTP/rNTP discrimination seen for an incoming mispaired pyrimidine (Table 3). It is harder to predict the position of the opposite nascent mispair, Py-dPuTP. Steric clashes with side chains on the floor of the binding pocket would probably prevent an incorrectly paired incoming purine from being located closer to the minor groove. The likely outcome is that the nucleotide would take up approximately the same position as in a correct base pair, with compensatory changes elsewhere, perhaps on the template side of the binding pocket. Note that the kinetic data for the E710A mutant imply that in the absence of Glu710, a mispaired dGTP can indeed be displaced toward the minor groove, resulting in tighter binding but compromised catalysis (26Minnick D.T. Liu L. Grindley N.D.F. Kunkel T.A. Joyce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1194-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Different constraints in the binding pocket for the nascent base pair could account for the difference in behavior of Dbh and Klenow fragment toward Pu-dPyTP mispairs. Assuming that a nascent Pu-dPyTP mismatch adopts a wobble conformation, this could be accommodated in an active site optimized for Watson-Crick geometry either by a relative displacement of the templating base toward the floor of the binding pocket or by displacement of the incoming nucleotide away from the floor of the binding pocket or by some combination of the two. We suggest that the snugly fitting A-family binding pocket of Klenow fragment discourages alternative positioning of the templating base and consequently the altered geometry is accommodated primarily on the dNTP side of the binding site (Fig. 2B), with the kinetic and fidelity consequences we have described here and in our previous work (26Minnick D.T. Liu L. Grindley N.D.F. Kunkel T.A. Joyce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1194-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Conversely, Dbh may have more potential for alternative binding geometries on the template site of the binding pocket and may be less tolerant than Klenow fragment of changes in position of the incoming dNTP. Indeed, it has recently been suggested that assembly of a catalytically competent arrangement of functional groups and divalent metal ions in the Y-family polymerase active site may be conditional on binding of the incoming nucleotide in the correct geometry, and this may provide an important specificity mechanism (32Vaisman A. Ling H. Woodgate R. Yang W. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2957-2967Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Greater flexibility in the geometry of binding the templating base is inherent to the biological function of Y-family polymerases since their role in lesion bypass requires them to accommodate modified or damaged bases in the templating position. The Y-family polymerases do not have a large side chain in the position equivalent to the invariant tyrosine of A-family DNA polymerases (Tyr671 of Klentaq, and Tyr766 of Klenow fragment), which, in the ternary complex, not only forms the floor of the binding pocket on the template side (Fig. 2B) but also contributes to the rigidity of the entire binding pocket with a hydrogen bond from the tyrosine hydroxyl to the steric gate carboxylate (13Doublié S. Tabor S. Long A. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Nature. 1998; 391: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar). The ternary complex of Dpo4, a close homologue of Dbh, has a much smaller side chain (Val32) in an analogous position on the minor groove side of the templating base (Fig. 2C). Moreover, this part of the binding pocket resembles a narrow ledge more than a floor; in contrast to the situation in Klenow fragment, it does not extend to the surface of the primer terminal base pair to form a continuous contact surface for the nascent base pair. It therefore seems reasonable that some repacking of the small side chains that make up the Dpo4 or Dbh binding pocket could take place in order to accommodate a variety of template base positions. As illustrated in Fig. 2C, this would be required in a Pu-dPyTP wobble mispair if the incoming pyrimidine occupied a position identical to that in a correct base pair. Alternatively, the adjustments to accommodate wobble geometry could be shared between template and dNTP sides of the binding site, as appears to be the case in a comparison of T-dATP and T-dGTP base pairs bound to Dpo4 (32Vaisman A. Ling H. Woodgate R. Yang W. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2957-2967Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In summary, we suggest that the flexibility on the template side of the Dbh active site allows for a consistent location of the incoming dNTP regardless of whether or not it is correctly paired with its templating partner. Contact of the dNTP sugar with the Phe12 steric gate side chain is maintained in all circumstances with the result that Dbh shows stringent discrimination against ribonucleotides but does not use the steric gate side chain as a discriminator against nascent mispairs. Reaction Pathway—The alternative mechanistic explanation takes account of the possibility of distinct reaction pathways for polymerase addition depending on whether the incoming dNTP is correct or incorrect (33Joyce C.M. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 14317-14324Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). In Dbh, the conformation of the active site binding pocket does not change significantly on binding substrates, suggesting that a nascent mispair may be accommodated, with minor adjustments, as described in the previous section. By contrast, in an A-family DNA polymerase such as Klenow fragment, part of the fingers subdomain moves so as to form the closed complex in response to the binding of a correctly matched dNTP (11Li Y. Korolev S. Waksman G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7514-7525Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar, 12Li Y. Waksman G.

A. 2003; 100: 3895-3900Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). It is this movement that forms the snug binding pocket for the nascent base pair and brings the dNTP sugar close to the steric gate side chain, Glu710 of Klenow fragment. If the fingers-closing transition were absent or altered in the misincorporation pathway, mispairs would interact to a lesser extent with Glu710, accounting for the changes in ribonucleotide discrimination and for the ability of Glu710 to serve as a discriminator against mispairs. Assessment of the plausibility of this mechanistic explanation will require a fuller understanding of the differences, if any, between the pathways for correct and incorrect dNTP addition, although it is worth noting that fluorescence experiments suggest that significant differences may exist (34Rothwell P.J.

Presynaptic filaments formed in the presence of UvsY undergo assembly/collapse that is tightly coupled to the ATP hydrolytic cycle and to stringent competition for ssDNA binding sites between Gp32 and various nucleotide-liganded forms of UvsX. The data directly support the Gp32 displacement model of UvsY-mediated presynaptic filament assembly, and demonstrate that the transient induction of high affinity UvsX-ssDNA interactions by ATP are essential, although not sufficient, for Gp32 displacement. The underlying dynamics of protein-ssDNA interactions within presynaptic filaments suggests that rearrangements of UvsX, UvsY, and Gp32 proteins on ssDNA may be coupled to central processes in T4 recombination metabolism.

The data directly support the Gp32 displacement model of UvsY-mediated presynaptic filament assembly, and demonstrate that the transient induction of high affinity UvsX-ssDNA interactions by ATP are essential, although not sufficient, for Gp32 displacement. The underlying dynamics of protein-ssDNA interactions within presynaptic filaments suggests that rearrangements of UvsX, UvsY, and Gp32 proteins on ssDNA may be coupled to central processes in T4 recombination metabolism. DNA strand exchange reactions catalyzed by recombinases of the highly conserved RecA family are central to the processes of homologous recombination and DNA double strand break repair. RecA recombinases are enzymatically activated by assembling into presynaptic filaments on single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) 3The abbreviations used are: ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; SSB, single-stranded DNA binding protein; Gp32, bacteriophage T4 gene 32 protein; 6-IAF, 6-iodoacetamidofluorescein; Gp32F, T4 gene 32 protein labeled with 6-iodoacetamidofluorescein; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate).3The abbreviations used are: ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; SSB, single-stranded DNA binding protein; Gp32, bacteriophage T4 gene 32 protein; 6-IAF, 6-iodoacetamidofluorescein; Gp32F, T4 gene 32 protein labeled with 6-iodoacetamidofluorescein; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate).

Timely and efficient presynaptic filament assembly is promoted by ssDNA-binding proteins (SSBs) and by recombination mediator proteins, which are functionally conserved among diverse species (2Beernink H.T.

A general model of presynaptic filament assembly has emerged in which SSB sequesters and removes secondary structure from ssDNA, after which a recombination mediator protein mediates loading of recombinase and concomitant displacement of SSB from ssDNA (1Bianco P.R.

UvsX, the RecA ortholog of T4 phage, exhibits both ssDNA-dependent ATPase and DNA strand exchange activities. UvsY, the prototype recombination mediator protein, stimulates enzymatic activities of UvsX by promoting assembly onto ssDNA of the latter protein. Gp32, the prototype SSB, has been characterized extensively (12Chase J.W. Williams K.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 103-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 13Karpel R.L. Revzin A.

Nature. 1995; 376: 362-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The primary structure of Gp32 (301 residues, 34 kDa) contains three distinct regions including the N-terminal “basic” (B-) domain (residues 1-22), the ssDNA-binding “core” domain (residues 22-253), and the C-terminal “acidic” (A-) domain (residues 254-301) (15Williams K.R.

Nature. 1995; 376: 362-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). This domain contains an oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide binding-fold, and its structure is stabilized by a Zn2+ atom coordinated to residues His-64, Cys-77, Cys-87, and Cys-90. Molecular studies reveal that the B-domain is the specific region responsible for Gp32 homotypic associations and for the cooperativity of Gp32-ssDNA interactions (16Giedroc D.P. Khan R. Barnhart K.

Equilibrium and kinetic parameters of Gp32-ssDNA interactions, including binding site size n, intrinsic binding constant K, and cooperativity parameter ω, have been determined for a variety of polynucleotide lattices (22Kowalczykowski S.C. Saenger W. Landolt-Bornstein: Numerical Data and Functional Relationships in Science and Technology. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1990: 244-263Google Scholar). Gp32-ssDNA interactions are characterized by high cooperativity, with ω generally ≥1000 for all single-stranded lattices examined. Binding is sequence-nonspecific, but the observed affinity (Kω) varies with lattice composition according to the general hierarchy of: poly(dT) > ssDNA (random sequence) > ssRNA >> double-stranded DNA (22Kowalczykowski S.C.

During presynaptic filament formation, Gp32 denatures ssDNA secondary structure and provides an optimum lattice conformation for assembly of UvsX-ssDNA filaments. The net effect of Gp32 on UvsX-ssDNA filament formation is inhibitory, however, because the high affinity of Gp32-ssDNA interactions allows Gp32 to effectively compete with UvsX for binding sites on the ssDNA (25Ando R.A. Morrical S.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 785-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Proper assembly of presynaptic filaments therefore requires the mediator function of UvsY protein in addition to UvsX and Gp32 (2Beernink H.T. Morrical S.W. Trends Biochem.

UvsX exhibits a strict requirement for UvsY in strand exchange assays performed at salt concentrations approximating physiological ionic strength (11Harris L.D. Griffith J.D. J. Mol.

In the current model of T4 presynaptic filament assembly, UvsY weakens Gp32-ssDNA interactions and strengthens UvsX-ssDNA interactions, allowing UvsX filaments to nucleate onto pre-existing Gp32-ssDNA complexes, and ultimately to displace Gp32 from the lattice (27Bleuit J.S.

Morrical S.M. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 5493-5502Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). After transiently participating in presynapsis, Gp32 further stimulates DNA strand exchange by binding to the displaced single strand generated during UvsX-catalyzed D-loop formation (24Kodadek T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20966-20969Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The ultimate disruption of Gp32-ssDNA interactions during presynaptic filament assembly has been inferred from protein cross-linking and other data (31Jiang H. Salinas F. Kodadek T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 231: 600-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), but has never been observed directly. Understanding the dynamics of Gp32 during recombination and other DNA transactions requires a probe to selectively report on Gp32-ssDNA interactions in the presence of other DNA-binding proteins. Here we describe such a probe in the form of a covalent conjugate between Gp32 and 6-iodoacetamidofluorescein (Gp32F) (60Morrical, S., and Qian, N., (January 13, 2003) U. S. Provisional Patent Application number 60/440,059Google Scholar, 61Morrical, S., and Qian, N., (January 12, 2004) International Patent Application number PCT/US2004/000665Google Scholar). Changes in the fluorescence signal of Gp32F allow for the detection and quantification of Gp32-ssDNA interactions in real time and in the presence of other proteins. Monitoring Gp32F fluorescence allows direct measurements of Gp32 displacement from the ssDNA during UvsX-ssDNA filament formation, and demonstrates the salt, nucleotide binding, and UvsY dependence of Gp32 displacement, in confirmation of the current model of T4 presynapsis. Results indicate that presynaptic filaments formed in the presence of Gp32 undergo assembly and collapse that is tightly linked to the ATP hydrolytic cycle, suggesting that in addition to the stabilizing effects of UvsY, ATP binding by UvsX is necessary for maximum occupancy of the ssDNA lattice by UvsX in the presence of Gp32. Competition for ssDNA binding sites between Gp32 and various nucleotide-liganded forms of UvsX may create opportunities for dynamic instability in presynaptic filaments, which could play important roles in T4 recombination metabolism.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChemicals and Buffers—All chemicals were analytical grade. 6-Iodoacetamidofluorescein (6-IAF) was purchased from Molecular Probes. Other chemicals and biochemicals were purchased from Sigma, unless specifically noted. Aqueous buffers and solutions were made with de-ionized, glass-distilled water. Storage buffers for Gp32, UvsX, and UvsY proteins were as previously described (25Ando R.A. Morrical S.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 785-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 32Sweezy M.A. Morrical S.W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 936-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 34Sweezy M.A. Morrical S.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 927-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Buffer A contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.1, 150 mm NaCl, and 10% (w/v) glycerol. Buffer B contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm MgCl2, and the indicated concentration of NaCl. TE buffer contained 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, and 1 mm EDTA.Proteins and Nucleic Acids—Recombinant T4 Gp32, UvsX, wild-type UvsY, and two UvsY mutant proteins (UvsYK58A and UvsYK58A,R60A) were purified and stored as previously described (27Bleuit J.S.

All proteins were determined to be >98% pure based on SDS-polyacrylamide gels stained with Coomassie Blue. Furthermore, all protein stock solutions were tested and judged to be nuclease-free by previously published criteria (37Morrical S.W. Hempstead K. Morrical M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33069-33081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Extinction coefficients for Gp32, UvsX, and UvsY sp. at 280 nm were 41,306, 69,760, and 19,180 m-1 cm-1, respectively (38Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5023) Google Scholar). Circular single-stranded DNA was extracted from purified bacteriophage M13mp18 particles as described (39Miller H. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 145-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 40Yamamoto K.R. Alberts B.M. Benzinger R. Lawhorne L. Treiber G. Virology. 1970; 40: 734-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar), and stored at -20 °C in TE buffer. The concentrations of ssDNA stock solutions were determined by the absorbance at 260 nm, using a conversion factor of 33 μg/ml/A260, and are expressed in units of micromoles of nucleotide residues per liter.Labeling of Gp32 with 6-IAF—All steps were carried out in the dark and at 4 °C. 2 mg of Gp32 protein were dialyzed overnight against 1 liter of Buffer A. Meanwhile a 10 mm stock of 6-IAF in Me2SO was prepared. A 3-fold molar excess of 6-IAF was added to the dialyzed Gp32 via drop by drop additions with gentle mixing. The solution was incubated overnight, after which 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol was added to consume excess 6-IAF. After 1 h of further incubation, the mixture was dialyzed overnight against 3 × 1 liters of Gp32 storage buffer. SDS-PAGE of the resulting fluorescein-Gp32 conjugate (Gp32F) revealed a single yellow band under visible light prior to Coomassie Blue staining, which upon staining appeared to run at approximately the same molecular weight as unmodified Gp32. The labeling stoichiometry of Gp32F was calculated from the absorbance at 492 and 280 nm, respectively, according to manufacturer's instructions.ATPase Assays—The ssDNA-dependent ATPase activity of UvsX protein in the presence and absence of Gp32 and Gp32F proteins was measured by a modification of the coupled spectrophotometric assay described (37Morrical S.W. Hempstead K. Morrical M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33069-33081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All reactions contained 20 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.4, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 90 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm ATP, 6 units/ml pyruvate kinase, 6 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase, 2.3 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.23 mm NADH, 4.5 μm M13mp18 ssDNA, 0.5 μm UvsX, and 0-1.4 μm of either Gp32 or Gp32F. Reactions at 37 °C were started by the addition of UvsX protein to a preincubated mixture of the other components. Reaction velocities were calculated from the change in absorbance at 380 nm using the linear portions of time courses.ATP concentrations present at different times during fluorescence time course experiments were determined using the ATP determination kit from Molecular Probes. Ten-microliter aliquots were removed from reaction mixtures in fluorescence cuvettes at different times and immediately quenched with 10 mm EDTA. Quenched samples then were boiled for 5 min before analysis. Luminescence was read on a FLX-800 Plate Reader (Sunnyvale, CA) in 96-well assay microplates. Values were calculated based on an ATP standard curve. All ATP concentrations were determined in triplicate. The generation of ADP versus AMP products was estimated based on experimentally measured ATP concentrations and by assuming a 2:1 ratio of ADP:AMP produced by UvsX protein (6Formosa T. Alberts B.M.

Morrical, unpublished results.Fluorescence Measurements—All fluorescence data were collected on a Quantamaster QM-4 fluorometer (Photon Technology International, South Brunswick, NJ). This fluorometer was equipped with a 75-watt xenon arc lamp as an excitation source, and excitation/emission monochrometers to measure steady-state fluorescence. All data were collected in the steadystate mode and corrected for effects of dilution, solution change, photobleaching, inner filter effects, and intrinsic protein fluorescence as described (25Ando R.A. Morrical S.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 785-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 34Sweezy M.A. Morrical S.W. J. Mol.

The slit widths for excitation and emission were 1 and 5 nm, respectively. The excitation wavelength was 460 nm. A long pass cutoff glass filter at 495 nm was used for all of the emission data collection. Data represent the averages of three independent multiwavelength scans (fluorescence emission spectra) or three independent readings at a fixed emission wavelength of 519 nm (fluorescence titrations and time courses), respectively. Sample volumes were generally 0.6-1.0 ml. Photobleaching was minimized by keeping shutters closed although not acquiring data, and was negligible in all experiments.Determination of Gp32F ssDNA-binding Parameters—Forward, reverse, and salt-back titrations were performed as described (43Kowalczykowski S.C. Paul L.S. Lonberg N. Newport J.W. McSwiggen J.A. von Hippel P.H. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1226-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), in Buffer B (with NaCl concentration as indicated) at 25 °C. The binding site size, n, of Gp32F on ssDNA was calculated from the end point of reverse titrations of Gp32F with ssDNA, monitored by the increase in Gp32F fluorescence, under tight binding conditions (Buffer B + 50 mm NaCl). Intrinsic affinity (K) and cooperativity (ω) parameters for Gp32F-ssDNA interactions were derived from forward titrations of 3.5 μm ssDNA with Gp32F under weak binding conditions (Buffer B + 260 to 340 mm NaCl). Binding was monitored by the increase in Gp32F fluorescence at 519 nm. Control titrations lacking M13mp18 ssDNA were conducted at each NaCl concentration, and were subtracted from their corresponding experimental data sets. Binding data in terms of fractional saturation of the ssDNA lattice (θ) with Gp32F ligand were derived from corrected fluorescence data. The observed affinity Kω was determined at each salt concentration from the midpoint of the titration according to Equation 1,I/Kω=Ltotal,0.5-N/2n(Eq. 1) where N is the molar concentration of ssDNA in nucleotides, n is the binding site size, and Ltotal,0.5 is the total protein concentration at the titration midpoint. For each titration curve a statistical value of Kω was determined by curve fitting to a sigmoidal function using DynaFit (BioKin, Ltd.). Holding Kω constant, the data then were compared by inspection to theoretical isotherms derived from the equations of McGhee and von Hippel (44McGhee J.D. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 86: 469-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (2709) Google Scholar, 45McGhee J.D. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 103 (Correction (1976)): 679Google Scholar), while selecting different pairs of ω and K values to best describe the lower half of the binding data (43Kowalczykowski S.C. Paul L.S. Lonberg N. Newport J.W. McSwiggen J.A. von Hippel P.H. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1226-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Due to the highly cooperative nature of Gp32F-ssDNA interactions and the interdependence of ω and K, the “optimal” ω is best given as a range of values that can adequately describe the data. Therefore the error in the corresponding K results from assuming ω values at the high, middle, and low ends of the range. The resulting K values were corrected for magnesium ion effects using Equations 3 and 4 of Record et al. (47Record Jr., M.T. deHaseth P.L. Lohman T.M. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 4791-4796Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), assuming Ψ = 0.71, where Ψ is the fraction of counterions thermodynamically bound to ssDNA, and assuming m′= 3, where m′ is the number of charge interactions formed between Gp32 and ssDNA (22Kowalczykowski S.C.

Control titrations lacking ssDNA or UvsY contained a volume of TE or UvsY storage buffer, respectively, equal to the volume of the missing component.Time Resolved ssDNA Binding Competition Assays—The competition between Gp32F and UvsX proteins for a limiting number of ssDNA binding sites was measured as a function of time by adding M13mp18 ssDNA (3.5 μm) to a solution containing both proteins (0.5 μm Gp32F, 0.875 μm UvsX) and monitoring subsequent changes in fluorescein fluorescence. The ssDNA concentration used is stoichiometric with respect to Gp32F alone (binding site size, n = 7 nucleotide residues) or to UvsX alone (n = 4) but cannot saturate both proteins simultaneously (22Kowalczykowski S.C.

To compare the effects of different nucleotides on Gp32F/UvsX competition, some reaction mixtures contained 1 mm AMP, 1 mm ADP, 1 mm ATPγS, or 1 mm ATP (with or without ATP regenerating system consisting of 2.3 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, and 6 units/ml pyruvate kinase). To study UvsY effects, some reactions contained variable amounts of wild-type UvsY protein (0-0.875 μm), or UvsYK58A (0.875 μm) or UvsYK58A,R60A (0.875 μm) mutant proteins. UvsY proteins, when present, were preincubated along with Gp32F and UvsX in a buffer/nucleotide mixture prior to the addition of ssDNA. In all reactions, a baseline fluorescence signal was obtained by collecting a 100-s time course (λex = 460 nm, λem = 519 nm) prior to ssDNA addition. ssDNA was added with rapid mixing, signal was re-acquired, and a 300-700-s time course (depending on experiment) was collected. For reaction series containing variable protein components, solvent composition was kept constant by adding appropriate amounts of protein storage buffers.RESULTSLabeling of Gp32 with Fluorescein—Results demonstrate that Gp32 can be site-specifically labeled with fluorescein, and that the resulting conjugate (Gp32F) inhibits UvsX protein activity to a similar degree as unmodified Gp32.

https://openalex.org/W2013121856,"A subset of papillary renal cell carcinomas (RCC) is characterized by the expression of a TFE3 fusion protein, where the fusion partner can be any of the several proteins identified so far such as PSF (PTB associated splicing factor), NonO, PRCC, CLTC and ASPL. These proteins result from chromosomal translocations involving the TFE3 gene located on the X chromosome. Our present study documents the central role of PSF-TFE3 in oncogenic transformation. We show that the inhibition of PSF-TFE3 expression through siRNA or shRNA leads to impaired growth, proliferation, invasion potential and long-term survival of UOK-145 papillary renal carcinoma-derived cells, which endogenously express PSF-TFE3. The oncogenic potential of PSF-TFE3 became evident by stable expression of PSF-TFE3 in NIH-3T3 mouse fibroblast cells, which leads to the acquisition of anchorage-independent growth as revealed by soft agar assay. In addition, the expression of PSF-TFE3 in normal renal proximal tubular epithelial cells from where such tumors originate leads to dedifferentiation and loss of some key functional proteins, which may reflect an initial step in the multistep process of tumor development. This suggests that the expression of PSF-TFE3 in renal epithelial cells plays an important role in the initiation and maintenance of oncogenic phenotype in papillary RCC."

https://openalex.org/W2010979064,"ERM is a member of the ETS transcription factor family. High levels of the corresponding mRNA are detected in a variety of human breast cancer cell lines, as well as in aggressive human breast tumors. As ERM protein is almost undetectable in these cells, high degradation of this transcription factor has been postulated. Here we have investigated whether ERM degradation might depend on the proteasome pathway. We show that endogenous and ectopically expressed ERM protein is short-lived protein and undergoes proteasome-dependent degradation. Deletion mutagenesis studies indicate that the 61 C-terminal amino acids of ERM are critical for its proteolysis and serve as a degradation signal. Although ERM conjugates with ubiquitin, this post-translational modification does not depend on the C-terminal domain. We have used an Ets-responsive ICAM-1 reporter plasmid to show that the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway can affect transcriptional function of ERM. Thus, ERM is subject to degradation via the 26S proteasome pathway, and this pathway probably plays an important role in regulating ERM transcriptional activity."
https://openalex.org/W2063859245,"The yeast transcriptional activator Zap1 contains two uncommon structural motifs designated zinc finger pair domains. The hallmark of this domain is the packing of two zinc finger motifs in one globular unit. One finger pair domain in Zap1 contains the AD2 transactivation domain. Zn(II) binding to this domain (ZF1/2) is kinetically labile yielding a zinc-regulated transactivator. The second finger pair domain (ZF3/4) lies within the DNA-binding domain, and it stably binds Zn(II). The goal of this study was to map the determinant conferring lability in Zn(II) binding by using finger pair chimeras. Whereas ZF2 contains the transactivation function, zinc regulation is dependent on the presence of ZF1. ZF3 can functionally replace ZF1, and a ZF3/2 finger pair retains limited zinc regulation. Replacement of ZF3 by ZF1 creating a ZF1/4 chimera was found to stably bind Zn(II), suggesting that the presence of a stable motif (ZF4) can impart binding stability on a labile motif (ZF1). Zn(II) binding in finger pair domains is dependent on the presence of both motifs. Mutations in one finger motif markedly attenuate Zn(II) binding to the second motif. Kinetic lability in Zn(II) binding was mapped to the α-helix of ZF2. A ZF1/ZFβ2α4 chimera resembles ZF3/4 in Zn(II) binding stability in incubation studies with the Zn(II) chelators. The present results demonstrate that zinc regulation of AD activity of ZF2 is dependent on determinants in ZF1 as well as the α-helix segment of ZF2. The yeast transcriptional activator Zap1 contains two uncommon structural motifs designated zinc finger pair domains.

The present results demonstrate that zinc regulation of AD activity of ZF2 is dependent on determinants in ZF1 as well as the α-helix segment of ZF2. Zinc is an essential nutrient, so cells must maintain a quota of zinc ions for normal physiology. The zinc quota for yeast (level of total zinc required for optimal growth) is ∼107 zinc atoms/cell (1MacDiarmid C.W. Gaither L.A. Eide D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2845-2855Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Zinc homeostasis in yeast cells is controlled by transcriptional regulation of transporters involved in zinc uptake across the plasma membrane and the intracellular storage/detoxification of zinc in the vacuole. In addition, post-transcriptional regulation of the high affinity Zrt1 plasma membrane transporter is important in limiting overaccumulation of zinc in yeast cells. Zinc-regulated gene expression is mediated by the Zap1 transcription factor. Zap1 plays a central role in zinc homeostasis by controlling the expression of nearly 40 genes. Zap1 is active in zinc-limited cells and is inactive in zinc-replete cells. Zap1 is an 880-amino acid protein with seven Cys2His2 (C2H2) 4The abbreviations used are: C2H2, Cys2His2; ZRE, zinc-responsive element; DBD, DNA-binding domain; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; GBD, Gal4 DNA-binding domain; 1,10-OP, 1,10-phenanthroline; PAR, 4-(2)-(pyridylazo)resorcinol; AD, activation domain. zinc finger motifs (2Zhao H. Eide D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5044-5052Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The DNA-binding domain was mapped to the C-terminal segment and consists of five C2H2 zinc fingers (designated ZF3–ZF7) (3Bird A. Evans-Galea M.V. Blankman E. Zhao H. Luo H. Winge D.R. Eide D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16160-16166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This domain confers specific binding to an 11-base pair DNA element designated the zinc-responsive element (ZRE) (4Zhao H. Butler E. Rodgers J. Spizzo T. Duesterhoeft S. Eide D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28713-28720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). ZREs are found in one or more copies in the promoters of Zap1 target genes (5Lyons T.J. Gasch A.P. Gaither L.A. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Eide D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7957-7962Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). All five zinc fingers in the DNA-binding domain are required for ZRE interaction (3Bird A. Evans-Galea M.V. Blankman E. Zhao H. Luo H. Winge D.R. Eide D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16160-16166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Because Zap1 is transcriptionally active only under zinc-deficient growth conditions, the DNA-binding zinc fingers must stably bind Zn(II) ions. Zap1 also contains two transcriptional activation domains, AD1 and AD2, which are zinc sensory domains and mediate zinc regulation of Zap1 activity (6Bird A.J. Zhao H. Luo H. Jensen L.T. Srinivasan C. Evans-Galea M. Winge D.R. Eide D.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3704-3713Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Transactivation activity of AD1 was mapped to residues 332–402, but zinc regulation required residues 182–502 (7Herbig A. Bird A.J. Swierczek S. McCall K. Mooney M. Wu C.-Y. Winge D.R. Eide D.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 834-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Although the domain has been shown to bind Zn(II), the regulatory Zn(II)-binding sites controlling AD1 have not been mapped to date. AD2 maps to residues 552–705 and contains two C2H2 zinc finger-like motifs designated ZF1 and ZF2 (8Bird A.J. McCall K. Kramer M. Blankman E. Winge D.R. Eide D.J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5137-5146Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). These two motifs are required for zinc regulation of transactivation but not DNA binding. Transactivation activity was shown to largely reside in ZF2, but zinc regulation requires both ZF1 and ZF2 (8Bird A.J. McCall K. Kramer M. Blankman E. Winge D.R. Eide D.J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5137-5146Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). AD2 appears to be a direct zinc sensor because mutational analyses of AD2 showed that substitutions of histidyl residues predicted to disrupt zinc binding to either ZF1 and/or ZF2 rendered AD2 constitutively active. Zinc regulation of AD2 appears to arise from the kinetic lability of Zn(II) binding to ZF1 and ZF2 (8Bird A.J. McCall K. Kramer M. Blankman E. Winge D.R. Eide D.J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5137-5146Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The classical zinc finger motif was first characterized in transcription factor IIIA and is now known to be one of the most abundant structural motifs in biology. The classical zinc finger motif consists of a compact globular domain with the backbone folded into an α-helix packed against a β-hairpin (9Elrod-Erickson M. Benson T.E. Pabo C.O. Structure. 1998; 6: 451-464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The fold is held together by a small hydrophobic core formed near the turn connecting β and α elements and the Zn(II) ion coordinated by two cysteines from the sheet region and the histidines from the α-helix. The zinc finger motifs in AD2 are distinct from classical zinc finger motifs that exist as tandem arrays of largely independently folded moieties (10Schwabe J.W.R. Klug A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 345-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The AD2 zinc finger motifs resemble a pair of zinc finger motifs first seen in the Gli tumor suppressor (11Pavletich N.P. Pabo C.O. Science. 1993; 261: 1701-1710Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). The DNA-binding domain of Gli contains five zinc finger motifs, but two motifs, ZF1 and ZF2, form a single globular unit with a hydrophobic interface (11Pavletich N.P. Pabo C.O. Science. 1993; 261: 1701-1710Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). Each of the two individual finger motifs contains a Trp residue in the β-hairpin that contributes to the hydrophobic interaction between the two finger motifs. Thus, the finger pair motif is distinguished from a classical zinc finger by existing as a single globular domain in contrast to the largely independently folded fingers in classical zinc finger structures. The importance of the Trp residue in a finger pair domain was demonstrated in the Gli-like factor in Aspergillus nidulans, PacC (12Fernandez-Martinez J. Brown C.V. Diez E. Tilburn J. Arst H.N. Penalva M.A. Espeso E.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 334: 667-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). PacC contains a candidate finger pair domain in a three-finger DNA-binding protein. Its function as a transcriptional repressor of acid-expressed gene was impaired when the conserved Trp residue in the β-hairpin in each finger motif was replaced. The zinc finger motifs in AD2 appear to adopt the finger pair domain because they contain the Trp residues and other appropriately spaced hydrophobic residues to form the finger-finger hydrophobic interface. Mutation of the Trp residue in either finger motif renders AD2 constitutively active (8Bird A.J. McCall K. Kramer M. Blankman E. Winge D.R. Eide D.J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5137-5146Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Two of the five zinc finger motifs in the Zap1 DNA-binding domain also appear to form a zinc finger pair domain. ZF3 and ZF4 have the same hydrophobic residues that define the finger pair domain in contrast to the classical zinc finger motifs. We demonstrated that whereas a polypeptide consisting of ZF1 and ZF2 bound two Zn(II) ions in a labile manner, a polypeptide consisting of ZF3 and ZF4 stably bound two Zn(II) ions (8Bird A.J. McCall K. Kramer M. Blankman E. Winge D.R. Eide D.J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5137-5146Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Zn(II) binding affinities were similar for the two proteins, but they differed markedly in their reactivity with competing chelators. To address what structural feature of the ZF1/2 finger pair imparts lability in Zn(II) binding relative to the ZF3/4 finger pair, we constructed chimeric finger pair domains and evaluated in vivo functional and in vitro Zn(II) binding properties. We demonstrate that Zn(II) binding to a finger pair domain is dependent on having two binding sites. We demonstrate that substitution of a stable zinc finger motif in place of a labile motif imparts Zn(II) binding stability to the other motif. Furthermore, the α-helix in ZF2 appears to be a major determinant of the observed kinetic lability in the ZF1/2 finger pair. Strains and Culture Conditions—The yeast strains used in this study were BY4741 gal4::KanMX (Mata his3Δ1; leu2Δ0; met15Δ0; ura3Δ0; gal4::KanMX) and BY4741 zap1::KanMX (Mata his3Δ1; leu2Δ0; met15Δ0; ura3Δ0; zap1::KanMX). The cells were routinely grown in synthetic defined medium supplemented with 2% glucose and the appropriate auxotrophic requirements. Low zinc medium was made as described previously (8Bird A.J. McCall K. Kramer M. Blankman E. Winge D.R. Eide D.J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5137-5146Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Plasmid Construction—The Gal4 DBD fusion vector (PGZ11; Fig. 2 construct 1, or Fig. 3, construct 1) is a derivative of pRS316 containing the coding sequence of the first 147 codons of GAL4 under the control of the PGK1 promoter and ZRC1 terminator. A unique BamHI site was introduced 3′ of the GAL4 DBD encoding sequence. PCR was used to amplify the appropriate coding regions of ZAP1 (as indicated in the figures) from Candida albicans genomic DNA, from the Ashbya gossypii genomic clone pAG18762 that was generously provided by Dr. Peter Philippsen, or from Saccharomyces cerevisiae genomic DNA. The products were cloned into the BamHI site of PGZ11 using homologous recombination. Primers were designed to allow an in-frame fusion of segments of ZAP1 to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain. Chimera zinc finger pairs were generated using two-step overlapping PCR. The previously reported plasmids pGBD-Zap1-ZF1 and pGBD-Zap1-ZF1/2 (8Bird A.J. McCall K. Kramer M. Blankman E. Winge D.R. Eide D.J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5137-5146Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) were used as templates in PCRs to generate constructs 3 and 4 (see Fig. 3), respectively. The construct VP16-Zap1 is a derivative of the plasmid YCpZRC1. Homologous recombination was used to replace the ZRC1 promoter and open reading frame with the PGK1 promoter inclusive of the translational start codon and coding region for the VP16 activation domain (PGK1-VP16). Primers were designed to introduce XhoI and XbaI sites 3′ of the VP16 activation domain-coding region. The coding region for Zap1 amino acids 701–881 was amplified by PCR using primers containing XhoI (5′ primer) and XbaI (3′ primer) sites. The PCR product was digested with XhoI and XbaI and then subcloned into the corresponding sites of the vector PGK1-VP16. Primers were designed to generate an in-frame fusion of the VP16 activation domain to the Zap1 DNA-binding domain. To replace the VP16 activation domain with Zap1 AD2, a portion of the VP16 AD was released from VP16-Zap1 by a SacI/XhoI digest. PCR was used to amplify the Gal4 DBD-Zap1 AD2 coding regions from constructs 2, 10, and 11 (see Fig. 3). Homologous recombination was used to introduce each of the PCR products into SacI/XhoI-digested VP16-Zap1. Primers were designed to delete the remaining VP16 AD coding region and to generate an in-frame fusion with the Zap1 DBD. The ZF1/2 and ZF3/4 constructs used in the in vitro studies were described previously (8Bird A.J. McCall K. Kramer M. Blankman E. Winge D.R. Eide D.J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5137-5146Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The remaining ZAP1 zinc finger pair fusions were generated using PCR with the appropriate plasmid from Fig. 3 as a template or by using overlapping PCR. The Gli zinc finger pair construct was generated by amplifying the coding region for residues 232–299 from the template GLIK12 (13Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 634-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar), which was generously provided by Dr. B. Vogelstein. Primers for these reactions contained EcoRI and NcoI site at their 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. All of the products were inserted into EcoRI/NcoI-digested pET32a vector (Novagen).FIGURE 3Regulation of chimera Zap1 zinc finger pairs in vivo. The indicated plasmids and reporter pGAL1-lacZ were introduced into the strain BY4741Δgal4. The end points of the amino acids residues that were fused to the GBD are listed. The zinc fingers are shaded in gray. A slash through the zinc finger indicates introduced mutations (listed at the left) that disrupt zinc binding. A, cell growth conditions and β-galactosidase assays were as described for Fig. 2. B, β-galactosidase assays were performed on BY4741Δgal4 cells containing the reporter pGAL1-lacZ and construct 2, 3, or 8 following growth in low zinc medium supplemented with the indicated amount of zinc (μm). C, immunoblot analysis (upper panel) and S1 nuclease analysis (lower panel) were used to examine protein accumulation and mRNA expression in cells expressing the constructs described in A. The culture conditions were as for Fig. 2. Pgk1 and CMD1 were used as loading controls for the immunoblot and S1 nuclease analysis, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) β-Galactosidase Assays—The cells were grown for 15–20 h to exponential phase in the indicated media. β-Galactosidase activity was measured as described previously (14Guarente L. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar), and the activity units were calculated as follows: (ΔA420 × 1000)/(min × ml of culture × absorbance of the culture a 600 nm). The reporter used was pGAL1-lacZ. S1 Nuclease Assays and Western Analysis—RNA was extracted from cells grown to the exponential phase using the hot acid phenol method. S1 analysis was performed as described previously (15Dohrmann P.R. Voth W.P. Stillman D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1746-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Crude protein extracts were generated from cells grown to exponential phase using trichloroacetic acid precipitation. The proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE before transfer to nitrocellulose. The blots were incubated with primary monoclonal anti-Gal4 DBD antibodies (Clontech) and anti-Pgk1 antibodies (Molecular Probes) and with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Pierce ECL reagents were utilized for enhanced chemiluminescence detection. Analysis of Metal Binding by Zinc Finger Peptides—Zap1 truncates were expressed in BL21(DE3) pLysS cells grown at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.5. Expression was induced with 0.6 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h at 30°C in the presence of 0.5 mm ZnCl2. The cells were harvested and pellets were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline + 10% glycerol. 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added before sonication and centrifugation at 45,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C. The column was equilibrated with lysis buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole) before the lysate was applied to Ni-NTA Superflow (Qiagen) columns. The column was washed with 5 column volumes of wash buffer (lysis buffer with 20 mm imidazole) and eluted with 450 mm imidazole in lysis buffer. The protein fractions were washed with phosphate-buffered saline buffer and concentrated by ultrafiltration. The His tag was removed by passing over a Ni-NTA columns after incubating with thrombin (∼0.01 unit/mg of protein for 16 h at 4 °C). Following the concentration, the proteins were >99% homogeneous as determined by SDS gel electrophoresis. The Zn(II) binding stoichiometry was determined by quantifying Zn(II) by atomic absorption on a PerkinElmer AAnalyst and quantifying protein by amino acid analysis on Beckman 6300 analyzer after acid hydrolysis in 5.7 n HCl, 0.1% phenol overnight in vacuo. The protein samples (50 μm) were dialyzed in 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm 1,10-phenanthroline using mini dialysis units (molecular weight cutoff 3,500) at 4 °C for 1–3 days. Kinetic measurements of Zn2+ release from zinc finger peptides were measured spectrophotometrically using 0.04 mm PAR and 4 μm proteins in 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4. The absorbance change at 500 nm was monitored. (PAR)2 Zn2+ complex concentrations were estimated from the absorbance at 500 nm using an extinction coefficient of 6.6 × 104 m–1 cm–1. 113Cd NMR Spectroscopy—Cd(II) samples were prepared with initial reduction of apo-protein samples in 5 mm dithiothreitol for 2 h at room temperature. The pH was adjusted to 2.0 for the sample to dissociate the bound Zn2+ ions. The samples were desalted on a PD-10 Column (Sephadex G-25M; Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 0.01 m HCl. The protein was concentrated using YM-3,000 Centricon (Millipore Corp.). The apo-protein concentration was estimated by determining the concentration of reactive thiols with the 2,2′-dithiodipyridine (Sigma) (16Grassetti D.R. Murray J.F. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 1967; 119: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). Cd(II) was added to apo-proteins to final stoichiometries of 2.1 and 0.7 molar eq of 113CdCl2(113CdCl2 95.32%; Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc.). 113CdNMR spectra were recorded on a Varian XL 500 spectrometer. The 113Cd chemical shifts are reported to the external standard 1 m 113Cd(ClO4)2 as 0.0 ppm. Mass Spectrometry—Zap1 ZF3/ZF4 peptide interactions with zinc ions were analyzed by electrospray mass spectrometry using a Quattro II spectrometer. Typically, the diluted apopeptide and metal ions in dilute acid neutralized to pH 7.2 with ammonium acetate, and the samples were incubated for 5 min at 25 °C. Alignments of S. cerevisiae Zap1 with orthologs from other fungi reveal that both the regulatory zinc finger pair (ZF1/2) and the zinc finger pair located within the DNA-binding domain (ZF3/4) are conserved (Fig. 1). Residues that coordinate Zn(II) and contribute to the hydrophobic interface in the Gli zinc finger pair are highly conserved in ZF1/2 and ZF3/4. With those exceptions very little sequence conservation exists among the ZF1/2 zinc pairs domains. To test whether alternative ZF1/2 pairs from other fungi are regulated by the cellular zinc status, sequences corresponding to the S. cerevisiae AD2 from A. gossypii and C. albicans were fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (GBD) and tested for zinc-regulated transactivation activity in S. cerevisiae by monitoring expression of a GAL1-lacZ reporter gene. Zinc inhibition of lacZ expression was evident with the A. gossypii and C. albicans AD2 orthologs (Fig. 2). Transactivation activity of AD2 resides predominantly in ZF2 (Fig. 3A, constructs 5 and 6). Mutations that disrupt Zn(II) binding to ZF1 and/or ZF2 render AD2 constitutively active in lacZ expression (Fig. 3A, constructs 3 and 4). To map the determinant conferring zinc regulation, we constructed a series of chimeric zinc finger pair domains in which finger motifs of the ZF3/4 pair were swapped in the ZF1/2 finger pair yielding ZF3/2 and ZF1/4 chimeric finger pair domains. These chimeras were tested with in vivo and in vitro assays. AD activity was assessed in vivo using fusions to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain. Expression of a GAL1-lacZ reporter in zinc-limited and replete cells was used to monitor transactivation activity of these fusions. Because AD2 activity maps to ZF2, the ZF1/4 chimera could not be assessed for in vivo AD activity (Fig. 3A, construct 9). The ZF3/2 chimera fused to the Gal4 DBD yielded high lacZ expression in zinc-deficient medium (Fig. 3A, construct 8). Transformants tested in zinc-replete medium showed attenuation of lacZ expression consistent with zinc regulation of AD activity within the ZF3/2 chimeric pair (Fig. 3A, construct 8). A more detailed comparison of the ZF3/2 and ZF1/2 GBD fusions over a range of zinc levels revealed that the activity of the ZF1/2 finger pair was more attenuated at higher cellular zinc levels (Fig. 3B). Thus, the chimeric ZF3/2 construct was not fully inhibited in zinc-replete cells. Immunoblot analysis of cells expressing the various zinc finger pair constructs revealed a surprising effect on protein accumulation of AD2 constructs that exhibited high transactivation activity in zinc-deficient cells (Fig. 3C). Gal4 fusions with ZF1/2 showed lower protein levels under conditions of maximal AD activity. Two constitutively active ZF1/2 constructs with Zn(II)-binding mutations were difficult to observe by immunoblot analysis. Zinc-deficient attenuation in protein levels was also observed in GBD fusions with either ZF2 or ZF1 and also with the inactive ZF3/4 finger pair. The observed diminution in protein levels in zinc-deficient cells arose from protein instability, because transcript levels of the fusion genes were not affected to any major extent by the cellular zinc status (Fig. 3C). Similar trends in protein instability were observed when the fusions were placed under the control of the ADH1 promoter and terminator regions (data not shown). The observed regulation of the ZF3/2 chimera suggested that key elements of zinc regulation reside in ZF2. In an attempt to map this determinant more precisely, we constructed two additional chimeras in which the β-hairpin and α-helix segments of ZF2 were replaced by corresponding segments from ZF4 creating chimera ZF1/ZFβ2α4(construct 10) and ZF1/ZFβ4α2(construct 11) shown schematically in Fig. 3A. GBD fusions with these chimeras were tested in vivo for GAL1-lacZ expression. Weak transactivation activity was observed in the ZF1/ZFβ4α2 chimera, and zinc regulation was observed (Fig. 3A). In contrast, no transactivation activity was observed in the ZF1/ZFβ2α4 chimera. Because no chimeric protein was detected in cell lysates (Fig. 3C), it is unclear whether the lack of GAL1-lacZ expression is due to insufficient protein or lack of transactivation domain function. The chimeric finger pairs tested in vivo were purified from Escherichia coli expressing the recombinant genes. The peptides were purified by Ni-NTA chromatography followed by cleavage and removal of the His6 purification tag (Fig. 4A). The purified ZF1/4 and ZF3/2 finger pair chimeric peptides were found to have two Zn(II) ions bound after removal of the purification tag. The zinc-peptide complexes were incubated with one of three metal ion chelators to assess relative binding avidities. Incubations with the chromogenic chelator, PAR (Zn(II) stability constant = 1017.1 m) were performed (Fig. 4B). We showed previously that Zn(II) binding to ZF3/4, but not to ZF1/2, was stable in the presence of PAR. ZF1/2-associated Zn(II) was largely depleted within a 1-h incubation with PAR, whereas ZF3/4-associated Zn(II) was predominantly retained. Replacement of the ZF2 motif with ZF4 yielding a ZF1/4 chimera pair resembled ZF3/4 in stability of Zn(II) binding (Fig. 4B). The ZF3/2 chimera pair, which exhibited limited zinc regulation in vivo, showed an intermediate response in PAR reactivity. The finger pair molecules were subjected to extended dialysis in buffer in the presence or absence of the Zn(II) chelator, 1,10-phenanthroline (1/10-OP) (stability constants = 1012.2 and 1017.1 m for the Zn(phen)2 and Zn(phen)3 complexes, respectively) (National Insitute of Standards and Technology Data base 46; critical stability constants) or EDTA (stability constant = 1016.2 for 1:1 complex). The amount of zinc retained by these peptides after overnight dialysis was determined (Fig. 4, C and D). Zn(II) was retained by each peptide sample upon dialysis in buffer, but the addition 1 mm EDTA resulted in the diminution in bound Zn(II) for the ZF1/2 and ZF3/2 pairs, whereas ZF3/4 and ZF1/4 retained their bound Zn(II). Dialysis in the presence of 1/10-OP resulted in significant zinc depletion in all constructs, but depletion in the ZF1/2 and ZF3/2 finger pairs was more pronounced. The ZF1/ZFβ2α4 and ZF1/ZFβ4α2 chimera finger pair domains were likewise purified from E. coli (Fig. 5A). Only ZF1/ZFβ2α4 was purified with 2 molar eq of bound Zn(II). The ZF1/ZFβ4α2 finger pair was isolated with only 0.5 molar eq Zinc and was not studied further. Dialysis of the Zn-ZF1/ZFβ2α4 peptide complex with 1/10-OP and EDTA revealed a surprising resistance to Zn(II) depletion similar to the ZF3/4 finger pair and the Gli finger pair domain (Fig. 5, B and C). Thus, the inclusion of the ZF4 α-helix abolished the kinetic lability of the ZF1/2 finger pair domain. A reciprocal construct was made in which the α-helix of ZF2 was inserted in the ZF3/4 finger pair domain, creating ZF3/ZFβ4α2. The inclusion of the α-helix of ZF2 destabilized Zn(II) binding in competition experiments with both 1/10-OP and EDTA (Fig. 5, B and C). The ZF1/ZFβ2α4 and ZF1/ZFβ4α2 chimeras were tested in vivo in the context of a minimal Zap1 consisting of the AD2 fused to the DBD (Fig. 6). zap1Δ cells transformed with either a VP16-Zap1 DBD fusion (construct 2) or the minimal AD2 ZAP1 (construct 3) were able to propagate in severely Zn-deficient medium. In contrast, zap1Δ cells harboring ZF1/ZFβ2α4 and ZF1/ZFβ4α2 Zap1 variants grew less well under severe zinc deficiency. This is suggestive that these variants were only partially active. Both mutant variants accumulated in zap1Δ cells to a greater extent than the active wild-type minimal Zap1 (Fig. 6B). Although both mutant variants partially complemented the zap1Δ strain, neither was sufficiently active to induce expression of a ZRE-lacZ or GAL1/lacZ reporter fusion even using the highly sensitive 4-methylumbelliferyl β-d-galactopyranoside substrate (data not shown). We cannot be certain whether the low AD activity arises from more stable Zn(II) binding or compromised AD activity in the chimera. Low AD activity appears to be the case with the ZF1/ZFβ4α2 variant in Fig. 3. The ZF1/2 finger pair domain has a longer linker compared with ZF3/4 or the Gli finger pair domain (Fig. 1). To assess whether the linker contributed to Zn(II) binding lability, we engineered a ZF1/2 pair linked by the ZF3/4 linker peptide (ZF1/2(3/4 link)). Dialysis of linker variant ZF1/2 finger pair with 1/10-OP and EDTA revealed a Zn(II) exchange profile similar to that of the wild-type ZF1/2 domain (Fig. 5, B and C). The effect of mutations in one finger was assessed in both ZF1/2 and ZF3/4 finger pair peptides. Double mutations in which the two histidyl ligands in ZF2 and ZF4 were substituted with glutamines (i.e. C2H2 → C2Q2) were engineered. The resulting mutant finger pairs contained only one wild-type site. Mutant genes were expressed in E. coli, and the proteins were purified (Fig. 4A). Whereas each mutant construct contained a single Zn(II) ion after Ni-NTA chromatography, the subsequent gel filtration step resulted in depletion of the bound Zn(II) ions. Thus, stable Zn(II) binding requires metallation of both sites in a finger pair domain. To corroborate these results, the Zn(II) ions in the ZF3/4 finger pair peptide were replaced with 113Cd(II) ions, and the resulting Cd2-peptide complex was evaluated by 113Cd NMR spectroscopy. Two resonances at 580 and 589 ppm were observed (Fig. 7A). The observed chemical shifts are consistent with the known S2N2 coordination of zinc finger motifs. Integration of the two signals revealed a 1:1 population of the two similar Cd(II) sites. The ZF3/4 finger pair peptide was next reconstituted with a single Cd(II), and the Cd1-ZF3/4 peptide was subjected to NMR analysis. The sample as purified contained 0.7 molar eq Cd(II) but showed two 113Cd resonances with chemical shifts of 581 and 589 ppm. Integration of the two signals showed a 1.0:0.6 ratio (Fig. 7B). The enrichment of one of the 113Cd signals suggests that a limited preference exists in one zinc finger motif for 113Cd binding. In an attempt to identify which finger motif showed the preferential Cd(II) binding, a ZF3/4 mutant peptide containing a C2Q2 site in ZF4 was purified, and 1 molar eq 113Cd(II) was added. Cd(II) was not retained in this peptide, consistent with the lack of Zn(II) binding in the mutant peptides. The absence of Cd(II) binding to the mutant ZF3/4 peptide suggests that the two signals observed in the Cd1·ZF3/4 peptide complex arises from limited cooperativity in Cd(II) binding. To address binding cooperativity in the ZF3/4 finger pair, the purified peptide was reconstituted with varying amounts of Zn(II), and the samples were subjected to electrospray mass spectrometry to identify noncovalent zinc·peptide complexes. Samples reconstituted with 0.4, 0.8, and 1.2 mol equiv Zn(II) showed the appearance of Zn1·ZF3/4 and Zn2·ZF3/4 complexes (Fig. 8). The abundance of the Zn2·ZF3/4 species was not significantly different from theoretical predictions of random binding events. Assuming the electrospray ionization process did not introduce artifactual distribution of species, the clear interpretation was that Zn(II) binding was largely noncooperative in the ZF3/4 finger pair peptide. The zinc finger pair domain is found in many eukaryotic genomes. The yeast genome contains three such finger pair domains. Two of these domains reside in Zap1, and the third domain is found in Rim101. The two finger pair domains in Zap1 each bind 2 molar eq Zn(II) and with similar binding affinities (8Bird A.J. McCall K. Kramer M. Blankman E. Winge D.R. Eide D.J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5137-5146Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). However, the two finger pair domains exhibit differential Zn(II) binding properties. The finger pair domain containing the AD2 transactivation segment, ZF1/2, exhibits kinetic lability in Zn(II) binding, unlike the finger pair domain from the Zap1 DBD, ZF3/4, or Gli. The hallmark of this novel domain is the packing of two zinc finger motifs together into one globular unit. The domain is stabilized by a hydrophobic interface between the two motifs. As such, one prediction is that polypeptide folding and Zn(II) binding would occur in a cooperative manner. A second prediction is that Zn(II) binding to a single finger motif of a paired domain would be highly destabilized in the absence of Zn(II) binding to the second finger. We show here that Zn(II) bind weakly to the single finger motifs of the ZF3/4 finger pair domain. A peptide containing the ZF3/4 finger pair with a C2H2 → C2Q2 substitution in ZF4 failed to retain bound Zn(II) in ZF3 during buffer dialysis. Likewise, a peptide containing the ZF1/2 finger pair with a C2H2 → C2Q2 substitution in ZF2 failed to retain bound Zn(II) in ZF1 during buffer dialysis. Limited binding cooperativity was observed in Cd(II) but not Zn(II) binding. The dependence of having two finger motifs together to form a stable finger pair domain suggests that interactions between the two motifs contribute to the binding energy of the zinc-folded conformer. During the review process of this manuscript, a report appeared on the structure of the Zap1 ZF1/2 finger pair domain (17Wang Z. Feng L.S. Matskevich V. Venkataraman K. Parasuraam P. Laity J.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 357: 1167-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The domain consists of two interacting fingers stabilized by a highly cooperative hydrophobic interface. The observed instability of individual fingers is consistent with the results of our study. The division of zinc finger pair domains into two classes of Zn(II) binding lability motivated our efforts to map the determinant conferring lability in Zn(II) binding. Inspection of the sequences of the two peptides revealed little sequence conservation. Therefore, finger pair chimeras between ZF1/2 and ZF3/4 were engineered to map the lability determinants. Replacement of the labile ZF2 within ZF1/2 by the stable ZF4 motif, creating a ZF1/4 chimera, resulted in a domain that exhibited stable Zn(II) ion binding. Thus, one important new observation is that a stable zinc finger motif can impart stability to a labile motif, thereby reducing reactivity with Zn(II) chelators. A ZF3/2 chimera constructed by replacing ZF1 by ZF3 with the interfinger linker being from ZF2 showed an intermediate reactivity with PAR, EDTA, and 1,10-OP. The PAR reactivity predicted that, as with the ZF1/4 chimera, the presence of a stable finger motif in conjunction with a labile motif leads to diminished reactivity with chelators. However, the diminished PAR reactivity of the ZF3/2 chimera was not equivalent to the observed stability of the ZF3/4 or ZF1/4 finger pair domains. Zinc metalloregulation of AD activity of the ZF3/2 chimera in vivo was also intermediate. Whereas both ZF1/2 and ZF3/2 exhibited similar AD activity when tested with the Gal4 DBD in zinc-deficient cells, the inhibition of activity of the ZF3/2 chimera in zinc-replete cells was incomplete relative to ZF1/2. The inability to the ZF3/2 to be fully inhibited in zinc-replete cells may arise from compromised cooperativity of packing the two nonnative finger motifs together in a single globular domain. Defects in forming a stable globular domain would impart partial constitutive AD activity. The higher transcriptional activity of the ZF3/2 finger pair relative to the ZF1/2 pair under zinc-replete conditions suggests that ZF3/2 binds zinc less stably relative to ZF1/2. In contrast, the in vitro chelator competition data suggest that Zn(II) binding to the ZF3/2 pair is more stable than the ZF1/2 pair predicting a more zinc-repressed state. The apparent discrepancy may simply be due to subtle differences in the thermodynamics rather than kinetics of Zn(II) binding. In addition, the in vivo regulation may be more complex than merely Zn(II) binding kinetics. For example, a post-translational modification that is absent in the ZF3/2 finger pair may be required to maintain the ZF1/2 finger pair in a fully repressed state. It is noteworthy that a number of the GBD-AD2 fusion proteins fail to accumulate to high levels in vivo (Fig. 3C, constructs 3 and 4). The active form of a number of transcription factors is subject to ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis (18Muratani M. Kung C. Shokat K.M. Tansey W.P. Cell. 2005; 120: 887-899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). As a consequence, their stability decreases when they are active. Our current studies are investigating whether AD2 is modified post-translationally. Two lines of evidence links the kinetic lability in Zn(II) binding to the α-helix of ZF2. First, the ZF1/ZFβ2α4 chimera resembles ZF3/4 in Zn(II) binding stability in in vitro incubation studies with the 1/10-OP and EDTA chelators. This result predicts that the ZF1/ZFβ2α4 chimera would render the finger pair in the zinc-bound state in vivo. The GAL4 minimal Zap1 construct containing the ZF1/ZFβ2α4 chimera was attenuated in AD activity, yet we cannot be certain this arises from stable Zn(II) binding or loss of AD activity by removing the α2 helix in ZF2. Second, substitution of the α2 helix in ZF2 in place of the helix in ZF4 creating a ZF3/ZFβ4α2 chimera imparted in vitro Zn(II) binding lability (Fig. 5). Zinc regulation of AD activity of ZF2, therefore, appears dependent on the α-helix segment of ZF2 as well as determinants in ZF1. The linker in ZF1/ZF2 does not appear to be a component of Zn(II) binding lability. Replacement of ZF1 with ZF3 yields an inferior sensory domain, but AD activity is largely retained. Thus, AD activity is not totally dependent on ZF1 in the finger pair domain. The zinc sensory function of the ZF1/2 domain is novel. With the conservation of this domain seen in multiple eukaryotic genomes, one challenge is to determine whether other finger pair domains exist that are zinc sensory. Zinc finger pair domains found in animal genomes tend to be in one of three contexts. Finger pair domains are seen in putative DNA-binding domains in which the finger pair domain is adjacent to a series of classical zinc finger motifs as in Gli and Zap1. An alternative arrangement is the presence of a finger pair domain adjacent to one classical zinc finger. The third context is the presence of paired finger domains isolated from any classical zinc fingers. Proteins in any of these three categories may conceivably be sensory to the cellular zinc status. The identification of other zinc sensory domains in mammalian genomes may provide insight into other cellular functions that may be modulated by the cellular zinc status. The ideal scenario is to use computational approaches to identify candidates, but this obvious approach is complicated by the present lack of predictive features of zinc sensory finger pair domains. Future studies may help define the structural determinants conferring lability on zinc finger pairs. For example, purification of recombinant finger pair domain peptides and testing by chelator reactivity may provide the most revealing information. These studies are in progress.

https://openalex.org/W1999247993,"The angiotensin II type 1A receptor (AT<sub>1A</sub>R) plays an important role in cardiovascular function and as such represents a primary target for therapeutic intervention. The AT<sub>1A</sub>R is coupled via G<sub>q</sub> to the activation of phospholipase C, the hydrolysis of phosphoinositides, release of calcium from intracellular stores, and the activation of protein kinase C (PKC). We show here that PKCβI and PKCβII exhibit different membrane translocation patterns in response to AT<sub>1A</sub>R agonist activation. Whereas PKCβII translocation to the membrane is transient, PKCβI displays additional translocation responses: persistent membrane localization and oscillations between the membrane and cytosol following agonist removal. The initial translocation of PKCβI requires the release of calcium from intracellular stores and the activation of phospholipase C, but persistent membrane localization is dependent upon extracellular calcium influx. The mutation of any of the three PKC phosphorylation consensus sites (Ser-331, Ser-338, and Ser-348) localized within the AT<sub>1A</sub>R C-tail significantly increases the probability that persistent increases in diacylglycerol levels and PKCβI translocation responses will be observed. The persistent increase in AT<sub>1A</sub>R-mediated diacylglycerol formation is mediated by the activation of phospholipase D. Although the persistent PKCβI membrane translocation response is absolutely dependent upon the PKC activity-dependent recruitment of an extracellular calcium current, it does not require the activation of phospholipase D. Taken together, we show that the patterning of AT<sub>1A</sub>R second messenger response patterns is regulated by heterologous desensitization and PKC isoform substrate specificity."

https://openalex.org/W2087940972,"The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of the hepatitis C virus and the bovine viral diarrhea virus(BVDV)is able to initiate RNA synthesis denovo in the absence of a primer. Previous crystallographic data have pointed to the existence of a GTP-specific binding site (G-site) that is located in the vicinity of the active site of the BVDV enzyme. Here we have studied the functional role of the G-site and present evidence to show that specific GTP binding affects the positioning of the template during de novo initiation. Following the formation of the first phosphodiester bond, the polymerase translocates relative to the newly synthesized dinucleotide, which brings the 5'-end of the primer into the G-site, releasing the previously bound GTP. At this stage, the 3'-end of the template can remain opposite to the 5'-end of the primer or be repositioned to its original location before RNA synthesis proceeds. We show that the template can freely move between the two locations, and both complexes can isomerize to equilibrium. These data suggest that the bound GTP can stabilize the interaction between the 3'-end of the template and the priming nucleotide, preventing the template to overshoot and extend beyond the active site during de novo initiation. The hepatitis C virus enzyme utilizes a dinucleotide primer exclusively from the blunt end; the existence of a functionally equivalent G-site is therefore uncertain. For the BVDV polymerase we showed that de novo initiation is severely compromised by the T320A mutant that likely affects hydrogen bonding between the G-site and the guanine base. Dinucleotide-primed reactions are not influenced by this mutation, which supports the notion that the G-site is located in close proximity but not at the active site of the enzyme."

The RNR enzymes isolated so far have been grouped into three main classes (I, II, and III).

R1 is a homodimer (α2) with a molecular mass of 2 × 90 kDa, whereas R2, also a homodimer (β2), has a molecular mass of 2 × 45 kDa. The three-dimensional structures of proteins R1 and R2 are known for Escherichia coli and for a number of other species, whereas only one study concerns the structure of the active R1/R2 holoenzyme complex (9Uppsten M. Färnegårdh M. Domkin V. Uhlin U. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 359: 365-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The activity of RNR is the first dedicated step in DNA synthesis. At the protein level the activity is determined by 1) R1/R2 interactions, 2) formation and maintenance in protein R2 of a tyrosyl radical neighboring a diiron carboxylate site, which contains two high spin ferric ions antiferromagnetically coupled by one μ-oxo bridge and one μ-carboxylate bridge, and 3) positive and negative nucleotide allosteric effectors acting in protein R1. The overall enzyme activity is controlled by the limiting levels of protein R2 that are undetectable in the G1 phase and increase in the S phase (10Chang C.H. Cheng Y.C.

In vitro, the tyrosyl radical is formed by loss of an electron and a proton in a reconstitution reaction between apoprotein R2, ferrous iron, and molecular oxygen. The R1 protein binds the substrate and allosteric effectors, whereas R2 contains the radical harboring tyrosyl residue, Tyr177, in mouse R2. During catalysis it is proposed that the oxidation equivalent stored in the tyrosyl side chain in R2 is transferred through an ∼35-Å-long pathway to a cysteine residue at the active site, Cys429, in the R1 protein (12Andersson K.K.

Nature. 1994; 370: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 23Nordlund P. Eklund H. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 123-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 25Kolberg M. Strand K.R. Graff P. Andersson K.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1699: 1-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). However, so far no specific residue(s) directly involved in the transfer of the proton has been identified. In the amino acid sequence of protein R2 the arginine residue, Arg265, is conserved in all R2 sequences known so far. In fact, it seems to be part of the fingerprint that characterizes R2 proteins. It has also been hypothesized that it participates in the PCET pathway based on the crystal structures of E. coli R2 and Salmonella typhimurium R2F proteins (3Eklund H. Uhlin U. Färnegårdh M.

A. 2003; 100: 3209-3214Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). However, so far no data have been provided to support these hypotheses. Upon examination of several crystal structures including a high resolution E. coli R2 and three mouse crystal structures, Arg265 was found to be consistently close to two crucial residues in the PCET pathway, Asp266 and Trp103 (Fig. 1 and Refs. 28Högbom M.

In fact, in all presently solved crystal structures of R2 protein from six different organisms the arginine residue is connected to the PCET pathway residues either by a direct hydrogen bond to the Asp266 or in most cases via a water molecule that is located between Asp266 and Trp103. The position of Arg265, the fact that it is highly conserved and that it has been found to be coordinated to a water molecule residing in the vicinity of Asp266 and Trp103, suggest that it may play a role in the PCET transfer process. Taking into consideration the biochemical characteristics of arginine, this residue could most likely be involved in the proton transfer part of the PCET pathway rather than in electron transfer part. It has also been suggested to be involved in R1 binding (3Eklund H. Uhlin U. Färnegårdh M. Logan D.T. Nordlund P. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2001; 77: 177-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 23Nordlund P. Eklund H. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 123-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Arginine residues have been implicated in various systems as key members in proton-dependent transfer mechanisms. An arginine residue has been identified as the proton donor in the reduction of fumarate. In fact, in the Shewanella fumarate reductase enzyme it has been shown that arginine is capable of working as a Lewis base stabilizing the build-up of negative charge upon hydride transfer from FAD to fumarate and as a proton donor to the substrate (32Mowat C.

In the rabbit renal cortical proximal tubule protein (PepT1) Arg282 has been found to be necessary for the proton coupling in the peptide-gated cation channel (34Meredith D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15795-15798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Moreover, studies in the bacteriorhodopsin light-driven proton pump suggest that an arginine residue may act as a proton release group and stabilize the active site (35Tanimoto T. Shibata M.

Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 12809-12818Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). An arginine residue has also been known to modulate the proton flux in the E. coli enzyme lactose permease (40Matzke E.A. Stephenson L.J. Brooker R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19095-19100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These examples establish the ability of arginine residues to act or modulate enzymatic proton transfers in biological systems. We have investigated the enzymatic activity in mouse RNR containing either native protein R2 or selected point mutants designed to probe the role of Arg265 as a proton mediator. Point mutations include replacement of Arg265 either by alanine, glutamate, glutamine, or tyrosine. In addition we have studied the formation of the tyrosyl radical in the reconstitution as well as the kinetics of radical formation in the mutants. Results indicate the Arg265 is crucial to catalysis but is not directly involved in tyrosyl radical formation. Expression and Purification of R2 Proteins—Site-directed mutagenesis was achieved using the QuikChange® II site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. The mouse proteins were overexpressed in logarithmically growing Rosetta 2(DE3)pLysS bacteria containing pETR2 plasmids encoding native mouse R2 protein or the mutant mouse R2 proteins Arg to Ala (R265A), Arg to Glu (R265E), Arg to Gln (R265Q), or Arg to Tyr (R265Y). For expression of native and R2 mutants, an overnight culture of Rosetta 2(DE3)pLysS inoculated with native or mutant R2 was diluted 200 times in 4.8 liters of Luria-Bertani medium containing 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol and 100 μg/ml carbenicillin. The bacteria were grown at 37 °C until they reached an A595 of 0.6 and then induced with 400 μm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and grown for an additional 3 h before harvesting. The native and mutant proteins were purified as previously described in Mann et al. (41Mann G.J. Gräslund A. Ochiai E.I. Ingemarson R. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1939-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) with a small modification. Grinding with aluminum oxide was omitted due to the presence of pLys in the vector. This preparation resulted in iron-containing R2 protein. To obtain R2 apoprotein, the same procedure was employed except that 0.2 mm EDTA was added 20 min before induction, and all purification buffers contained 0.2 mm EDTA. Preparation of the Anaerobic Fe2+ Solution—Buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl was thoroughly degassed in a septum-sealed 250-ml bulb for several hours by flushing oxygen-free argon and evacuation. A second bulb containing Mohr's salt crystals, (NH4)2Fe(SO4)2, was sealed and evacuated using the same procedure. A plastic syringe was made anaerobic by repeated washing with oxygen-free argon gas. Then the appropriate volume of degassed buffer was used to prepare the desired iron concentration by transferring the buffer into the bulb containing Mohr's salt. Reconstitution Reaction of Apoprotein R2 with Fe2+ and Oxygen—Reconstitution of the iron site in the R2 proteins were carried out by mixing oxygen saturated apoprotein R2 with anaerobic Fe2+ solution. Rapid freeze quench was performed with a System 1000 apparatus from Update Instruments to obtain reaction times from 20 ms to 1 s. The EPR tubes were submerged in isopentane at a temperature of –110 °C. Anaerobic iron solution and apoprotein were rapidly mixed and then quenched by spraying them onto the EPR tube. The crystals were tightly packed into the tube using a packing rod made from Teflon. Isopentane from the EPR tube was completely removed by placing the tubes under vacuum for 15 min. For reaction times above 1 s, slow-freeze quench was achieved by hand mixing. A gas-tight Hamilton syringe washed several times with anaerobic Fe2+ was used to reconstitute the aerobic apoprotein previously placed in an EPR tube. Reactions were quenched by immersion of the EPR tubes into cold isopentane at –110 °C. To assess the reconstitution efficiency after EPR measurements, the protein was passed through a NAP™ 5 column to remove excess iron. The total iron content was determined using an iron/TIBC (ferrozine) reagent set from Eagle Diagnostics. Ribonucleotide Reductase Activity Assay—The ability of native and mutant R2 proteins to catalyze the reduction of [3H]CDP in the presence of R1 protein was determined as described earlier (42Engström Y. Eriksson S. Thelander L. Åkerman M. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2941-2948Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). One unit is defined as the amount of protein that, in excess of R1 protein, catalyzes the formation of 1 nmol of dCDP/min at 37 °C. The following reagents were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C in a total volume of 50 μl: 0.5 mm [3H]CDP, 3 mm ATP, 10 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 100 mm KCl, 6.4 mm MgCl2, 0.02 mm FeCl3, and 40 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.5. Surface Plasmon Resonance Analysis of R1-R2 Complex Formation—All surface plasmon resonance measurements were performed using Biacore 3000 equipped with research grade CM5 sensor chips. The R2 proteins were immobilized using the amino-coupling chemistry method as described earlier (11Rova U. Goodtzova K. Ingemarson R. Behravan G. Gräslund A. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4267-4275Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). After activation of the dextran layer, 30 ml of R2 proteins at concentrations of 40 μm were injected at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. The R2 proteins were allowed to interact with R1 protein at different concentrations previously equilibrated with HBS-EP buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.005% surfactant P20) plus 2 mm DTT. Five different R1 concentrations were used to determine kinetics for the R1-R2 interactions. Increasing concentrations of pure R1 in the HBS-EP buffer containing 2 mm DTT and 0.125 mm dTTP were used to obtain kinetic data. A constant flow of 5 μl/min of the same running buffer was used as eluent during the subunit interaction. The surface was regenerated between each protein R1 with 10 μl of 0.5 m KCl in HBS-EP buffer. Data were collected and analyzed using the Bioeval 3.2 program to obtain relative unit values of bound R1 protein for each injection. Electron Paramagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy—X-band EPR spectra were measured on a Bruker ESP 300 spectrometer as described earlier (43Rova U. Adrait A. Pötsch S. Gräslund A. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23746-23751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). All spectra were recorded at 20 K. Modeling of the Arg Site in Mouse R2—To model the accessibility of the surface of the protein, the NACESS program was used (44Lee B. Richards F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 55: 379-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (5345) Google Scholar). Insight II was also used to measure distances and minimize the structures containing the different amino acid replacements. Activity of Apo and Reactivated R2 Proteins—Because Arg265 is a highly conserved residue, we were interested in studying the enzymatic activity as well as tyrosyl radical formation in several selected point mutants. The amino acids chosen to replace Arg265 were chosen either to be small and hydrophobic (Ala), negatively charged (Glu), polar and non-hydrogen bonding (Gln), or aromatic (Tyr). The catalytic activities of the R2 point mutants were studied and compared with native R2 protein. The specific activities found for the native and mutant R2 proteins in the mouse RNR enzyme reaction at pH 7.5 are summarized in Table 1. All proteins were assayed directly after preparation and as described in Mann et al. (41Mann G.J. Gräslund A. Ochiai E.I. Ingemarson R. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1939-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Proteins R2 or R1 alone were used as controls. Each assay was repeated at least three times, and the reported values are the average with an approximate uncertainty of ±5% as can be observed in Table 1. The R265Q mutant showed insignificant activity, similar to those reported for R2 protein alone in the absence of R1, which were employed as controls. Therefore, we considered it to be inactive. A similar case was observed with the R265Y mutant, for which an activity of about 4% was detected. For the R265A mutant, an activity of ∼10% when compared with the native protein was observed.TABLE 1Ribonucleotide reductase activity of native and mutant R2 proteins at pH 7.5ProteinSpecific activitynmol/mg/minaSpecific activity is the average of at least three assays.Native R2165 ± 5R265A17 ± 2R265E66 ± 8R265Q<1.7R265Y7 ± 2a Specific activity is the average of at least three assays. Open table in a new tab A different result was obtained for the R265E mutant protein. R265E was found to have ∼40% of the activity compared with the native R2. This is a significant activity, which indicates that this mutant is capable of catalysis. Formation of the Stable Tyrosyl Radical in Native and Mutant R2 Proteins—The tyrosyl radical is formed in vitro in a reaction between apoprotein R2, ferrous iron, and molecular oxygen. The formation of a tyrosyl radical was studied by EPR spectroscopy. The extent of tyrosyl formation was determined for the mutants. As can be seen in Fig. 2, R265E and R265Q mutants were both capable of forming stable Tyr· in similar amounts (difference of 10%) as the native R2 protein after reactivation with iron and oxygen. A similar result was found for the R265A and R265Y proteins (data not shown). The tyrosyl radical EPR spectra did not show any qualitative differences between the mutants and the native R2. Rate of Stable Tyrosyl Radical Formation—Previous studies showed that mutations to the hydrogen-bonded PCET pathway (e.g. D266A or W103Y) resulted in kinetic differences in tyrosyl radical formation (11Rova U. Goodtzova K. Ingemarson R. Behravan G. Gräslund A. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4267-4275Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 13Nordlund P. Sjöberg B.M. Eklund H. Nature. 1990; 345: 593-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar). These mutants were also catalytically inactive (11Rova U. Goodtzova K. Ingemarson R. Behravan G. Gräslund A. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4267-4275Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The present study shows that the Arg265 mutants had substantially less enzymatic activity than the native enzyme, with the exception of the R265E mutant. These differences could be due to mechanistic or kinetic differences in the formation of the stable Tyr·. To assess the rate of formation of the Tyr·, we recorded the time courses of the reconstitution reaction at room temperature with a ratio [Fe(II)]/[polypeptide of R2] of 3 using apo forms of either native mouse R2 or mutant R265E proteins. The apo forms of protein R2 were obtained by adding 0.2 mm EDTA before induction and purifying them in the presence of 0.2 mm EDTA. Before reconstitution, native apoR2 had an average iron content of 1–2% and less than 5% of Tyr (Table 2). After reconstitution, 68% of Tyr· formation was observed with a kform of 2.15 s–1. Both quantitatively and kinetically these values are well in accordance with previous studies (45Schmidt P.P. Rova U. Katterle B. Thelander L. Gräslund A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21463-21472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 46Yun D. Krebs C. Gupta G.P. Iwig D.F. Huynh B.H. Bollinger M.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 981-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Formation of stable Tyr· was also assessed for the R265E mutant in the same manner as above. The kform of the R265E mutant R2 was 3.11 s–1 (Table 2). The amount of Tyr· per polypeptide after reconstitution was 63%. These results show that R265E and native R2 have virtually the same quantitative and kinetic characteristics regarding Tyr· formation. It should be noted that attempts to reconstitute and increase radical concentrations in iron containing R2 proteins grown in LB media also resulted in increased radical concentrations. However, the extent of radical formation was less in those proteins, and the kinetics were slower.TABLE 2Iron content and rate of stable tyrosyl radical formation in native and R265E R2 proteinsNative R2aApo forms of the proteins were produced in LB medium when 0.2 mm EDTA was added to the medium at the time of induction by isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopy-ranoside, as described under “Experimental Procedures.”R265EIron/polypeptide before reconstitution0.030.03Tyr•/polypeptide before reconstitution<0.05<0.04Tyr•/polypeptide after reconstitution0.680.63Rate (kform)2.15 s-13.11 s-1a Apo forms of the proteins were produced in LB medium when 0.2 mm EDTA was added to the medium at the time of induction by isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopy-ranoside, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab R1-R2 Interaction Studies by Surface Plasmon Resonance—The role of Arg265 in the interaction between R2 and R1 was studied by immobilizing the native and mutant R2 proteins and allowing them to interact with the increasing concentrations of R1 protein containing DTT and the allosteric effector dTTP. Previous studies have shown that dTTP increases the affinity between the R1 and R2 proteins (47Ingemarson R. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8603-8609Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Sensorgrams showed an increase in bound R1 with increasing concentrations or R1 protein consistent with previous studies (data not shown). The kinetic parameters for R1-R2 binding are summarized in Table 3. As can be observed, no significant differences were observed between the native R2 protein and the mutants R265E and R265Q. The KD values varied from 0.43 μm–1 in native R2 to 1.09 μm–1 in the R265Q mutant. We conclude that the point mutations keep their overall structure integrity and have only minor effects on R1 binding.TABLE 3Surface plasmon resonance R1-R2 interaction parameters in the presence of 0.125 mm dTTP effectorProteinkassoc.kdissoc.KDaKD was calculated as a ratio of kdissoc/kassoc.m-1 s-1s-1μmNative1.20 × 104 ± 0.210.52 × 10-2 ± 0.150.43 ± 0.20R265E1.71 × 1041.15 × 10-20.67R265Q2.07 × 1042.27 × 10-21.09a KD was calculated as a ratio of kdissoc/kassoc.

The guanidino group from Arg265 lies ∼5.32 Å away from the carboxylic group of Asp266 and at an equivalent distance to Trp103. This distance is bridged by a highly conserved water molecule that is located ∼3 Å from the guanidino group of Arg265 and ∼2.6 Å from the carboxylate group of Asp266. The presence of this water molecule located between the Asp266, Trp103, and Arg265 residues shortens the distance between the three residues. The positive charge of Arg265 can, therefore, serve as a modulator to the negative charge of"
