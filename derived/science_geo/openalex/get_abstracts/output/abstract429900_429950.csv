https://openalex.org/W2080392221,"The tumor suppressor gene p53 has been implicated in the regulation of epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) and tumor metastasis by regulating microRNA (miRNA) expression. Here, we report that mutant p53 exerts oncogenic functions and promotes EMT in endometrial cancer (EC) by directly binding to the promoter of miR-130b (a negative regulator of ZEB1) and inhibiting its transcription. We transduced p53 mutants into p53-null EC cells, profiled the miRNA expression by miRNA microarray and identified miR-130b as a potential target of mutant p53. Ectopic expression of p53 mutants repressed the expression of miR-130b and triggered ZEB1-dependent EMT and cancer cell invasion. Loss of an endogenous p53 mutation increased the expression of miR-130b, which resulted in reduced ZEB1 expression and attenuation of the EMT phenotype. Furthermore, re-expression of miR-130b suppressed mutant p53-induced EMT and ZEB1 expression. Importantly, the expression of miR-130 was significantly reduced in EC tissues, and patients with higher expression levels of miR-130b survived longer. These data provide a novel understanding of the roles of p53 gain-of-function mutations in accelerating tumor progression and metastasis through modulation of the miR-130b–ZEB1 axis."
https://openalex.org/W1970944737,"Human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a highly malignant cancer associated with major morbidity and mortality. In this study, we determined that human HNSCC-derived HSC-3 cells contain a subpopulation of cancer stem cells (CSCs) characterized by high levels of CD44v3 and aldehyde dehydrogenase-1 (ALDH1) expression. These tumor cells also express several stem cell markers (the transcription factors Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog) and display the hallmark CSC properties of self-renewal/clonal formation and the ability to generate heterogeneous cell populations. Importantly, hyaluronan (HA) stimulates the CD44v3 (an HA receptor) interaction with Oct4-Sox2-Nanog leading to both a complex formation and the nuclear translocation of three CSC transcription factors. Further analysis reveals that microRNA-302 (miR-302) is controlled by an upstream promoter containing Oct4-Sox2-Nanog-binding sites, whereas chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays demonstrate that stimulation of miR-302 expression by HA-CD44 is Oct4-Sox2-Nanog-dependent in HNSCC-specific CSCs. This process results in suppression of several epigenetic regulators (AOF1/AOF2 and DNMT1) and the up-regulation of several survival proteins (cIAP-1, cIAP-2, and XIAP) leading to self-renewal, clonal formation, and cisplatin resistance. These CSCs were transfected with a specific anti-miR-302 inhibitor to silence miR-302 expression and block its target functions. Our results demonstrate that the anti-miR-302 inhibitor not only enhances the expression of AOF1/AOF2 and DNMT1 but also abrogates the production of cIAP-1, cIAP-2, and XIAP and HA-CD44v3-mediated cancer stem cell functions. Taken together, these findings strongly support the contention that the HA-induced CD44v3 interaction with Oct4-Sox2-Nanog signaling plays a pivotal role in miR-302 production leading to AOF1/AOF2/DNMT1 down-regulation and survival of protein activation. All of these events are critically important for the acquisition of cancer stem cell properties, including self-renewal, clonal formation, and chemotherapy resistance in HA-CD44v3-activated head and neck cancer.

The 3-year survival rate for patients with advanced-stage HNSCC and treatment with standard therapy is only 30–50% (1Parkin D.M. Bray F. Ferlay J. Pisani P.

Nearly 40–60% of HNSCC patients subsequently develop recurrences or distant metastases (1Parkin D.M. Bray F. Ferlay J. Pisani P. Global cancer statistics, 2002.CA Cancer J.

Cisplatin is one of the most common chemotherapies used to treat head and neck cancer today. The ability of this drug to induce tumor cell death is often counteracted by the presence of anti-apoptotic regulators leading to chemoresistance (3Nakamura M. Nakatani K. Uzawa K. Ono K. Uesugi H.

Several lines of evidence point toward the IAP family (e.g. cIAP-1, cIAP-2, and XIAP) playing a role in oncogenesis via their effective suppression of apoptosis (7Hunter A.M. The inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs) as cancer targets.Apoptosis. 2007; 12: 1543-1568Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). The mode of action of IAPs in suppressing apoptosis appears to be through direct inhibition of caspases and pro-caspases (primarily caspase 3 and 7) (7Hunter A.M. The inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs) as cancer targets.Apoptosis. 2007; 12: 1543-1568Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). IAPs also support chemoresistance directly by preventing tumor cell death induced by anticancer agents (8Gyrd-Hansen M. Meier P. IAPs. From caspase inhibitors to modulators of NF-κB, inflammation, and cancer.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2010; 10: 561-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Although certain anti-apoptotic proteins (e.g. Bcl-xL) have been shown to participate in anti-apoptosis and chemoresistance in HA-CD44-activated tumor cells (9Bourguignon L.Y. Xia W. Wong G. Hyaluronan-mediated CD44 interaction with p300 and SIRT1 regulates β-catenin signaling and NFκB-specific transcription activity leading to MDR1 and Bcl-xL gene expression and chemoresistance in breast tumor cells.J.

Accumulating evidence has indicated that most tumors contain a small population of cells that persistently initiate tumor growth and promote tumor progression. These “tumor-initiating cells” are also called “cancer stem cells” (CSCs) because they share several hallmarks of normal stem cells (10Dalerba P. Cho R.W. Clarke M.F. Cancer stem cells. Models and concepts.Annu. Rev. Med. 2007; 58: 267-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar, 11Schulenburg A. Ulrich-Pur H. Thurnher D. Erovic B. Florian S. Sperr W.R. Kalhs P. Marian B. Wrba F. Zielinski C.C. Valent P. Neoplastic stem cells. A novel therapeutic target in clinical oncology.Cancer. 2006; 107: 2512-2520Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). For example, CSCs undergo self-renewal, maintain quiescence, display multipotentiality, and express survival protein/anti-apoptosis proteins (10Dalerba P. Cho R.W. Clarke M.F. Cancer stem cells. Models and concepts.Annu. Rev. Med. 2007; 58: 267-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar, 11Schulenburg A. Ulrich-Pur H. Thurnher D. Erovic B. Florian S. Sperr W.R. Kalhs P. Marian B. Wrba F. Zielinski C.C. Valent P. Neoplastic stem cells. A novel therapeutic target in clinical oncology.Cancer. 2006; 107: 2512-2520Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Another well known property of CSCs is their ability to expand stem cell population by undergoing cell proliferation/survival and/or clone formation and differentiation (10Dalerba P. Cho R.W. Clarke M.F. Cancer stem cells. Models and concepts.Annu. Rev. Med. 2007; 58: 267-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar, 11Schulenburg A. Ulrich-Pur H. Thurnher D. Erovic B. Florian S. Sperr W.R. Kalhs P. Marian B. Wrba F. Zielinski C.C. Valent P. Neoplastic stem cells. A novel therapeutic target in clinical oncology.Cancer. 2006; 107: 2512-2520Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). CSCs also display chemotherapy resistance, thereby causing a relapse of the cancers (12Al-Hajj M. Cancer stem cells and oncology therapeutics.Curr. Opin. Oncol. 2007; 19: 61-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). A number of studies have identified specific molecules expressed in hyaluronans that correlate with both stem cell properties and tumor cell behaviors. Among such molecules is CD44, which is a multifunctional transmembrane glycoprotein expressed in many cells and tissues, including HNSCC cells and various carcinoma tissues (13Prince M.E. Sivanandan R. Kaczorowski A. Wolf G.T. Kaplan M.J. Dalerba P. Weissman I.L. Clarke M.F. Ailles L.E. Identification of a subpopulation of cells with cancer stem cell properties in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 973-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (1789) Google Scholar). CD44 is commonly expressed in various isoforms generated by alternative mRNA splicing of variant exons inserted into an extracellular membrane-proximal site (14Screaton G.R. Bell M.V. Jackson D.G. Cornelis F.B. Gerth U. Bell J.I. Genomic structure of DNA encoding the lymphocyte homing receptor CD44 reveals at least 12 alternatively spliced exons.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 12160-12164Crossref PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar). CD44 is expressed in both normal and CSCs and has been suggested to be an important stem cell marker (13Prince M.E. Sivanandan R. Kaczorowski A. Wolf G.T. Kaplan M.J. Dalerba P. Weissman I.L. Clarke M.F. Ailles L.E. Identification of a subpopulation of cells with cancer stem cell properties in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 973-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (1789) Google Scholar, 15Mack B. Gires O. CD44s and CD44v6 expression in head and neck epithelia.PLoS One. 2008; 3: e3360Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). HNSCC tumors appear to contain a subpopulation of CSCs characterized by a high level of CD44 expression (13Prince M.E. Sivanandan R. Kaczorowski A. Wolf G.T. Kaplan M.J. Dalerba P. Weissman I.L. Clarke M.F. Ailles L.E. Identification of a subpopulation of cells with cancer stem cell properties in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 973-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (1789) Google Scholar). Purified CSCs overexpressing CD44 are capable of generating phenotypically distinct cells resulting in heterogeneous tumors in immunodeficient mice (13Prince M.E. Sivanandan R. Kaczorowski A. Wolf G.T. Kaplan M.J. Dalerba P. Weissman I.L. Clarke M.F. Ailles L.E. Identification of a subpopulation of cells with cancer stem cell properties in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 973-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (1789) Google Scholar). These findings clearly indicate that CSCs overexpressing CD44 display the hallmark stem cell properties of self-renewal and the ability to generate heterogeneous cell populations. In fact, CD44 is considered to be one of the important cell surface markers for both normal stem cells and CSCs (13Prince M.E. Sivanandan R. Kaczorowski A. Wolf G.T. Kaplan M.J. Dalerba P. Weissman I.L. Clarke M.F. Ailles L.E. Identification of a subpopulation of cells with cancer stem cell properties in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

CD44s and CD44v6 expression in head and neck epithelia.PLoS One. 2008; 3: e3360Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Most importantly, the expression of certain CD44 variant isoforms (in particular, CD44v3) is closely associated with head and neck cancer progression (16Wang S.J. Wong G. de Heer A.M. Xia W. Bourguignon L.Y. CD44 variant isoforms in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma progression.Laryngoscope. 2009; 119: 1518-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 17Franzmann E.J. Weed D.T. Civantos F.J. Goodwin W.J. Bourguignon L.Y. A novel CD44 v3 isoform is involved in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma progression.Otolaryngol.

Association of CD44 V3-containing isoforms with tumor cell growth, migration, matrix metalloproteinase expression, and lymph node metastasis in head and neck cancer.Head Neck. 2007; 29: 550-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The question of whether CD44v3 is expressed in CSCs of HNSCC remains unanswered. Hyaluronan (HA) is a major component in the extracellular matrix of most mammalian tissues. HA is a nonsulfated, unbranched glycosaminoglycan consisting of repeating disaccharide units, d-glucuronic acid, and N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (19Laurent T.C. Fraser J.R. Hyaluronan.FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2397-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (2072) Google Scholar, 20Lee J.Y. Spicer A.P. Hyaluronan. A multifunctional, megadalton, stealth molecule.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 581-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). It is synthesized by specific HA synthases (20Lee J.Y. Spicer A.P. Hyaluronan. A multifunctional, megadalton, stealth molecule.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 581-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 21Toole B.P. Hyaluronan in morphogenesis.Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 12: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar) and digested into various smaller sized molecules by various hyaluronidases (22Stern R. Jedrzejas M.J. Hyaluronidases. Their genomics, structures, and mechanisms of action.Chem. Rev. 2006; 106: 818-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). HA is enriched in many types of tumors (23Knudson W. Biswas C. Li X.Q.

The role of hyaluronic acid in hemopoietic stem cell biology.Regen. Med. 2006; 1: 437-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 26Astachov L. Vago R. Aviv M. Nevo Z. Hyaluronan and mesenchymal stem cells. From germ layer to cartilage and bone.Front. Biosci. 2011; 16: 261-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The unique HA-enriched microenvironment appears to be involved in both self-renewal and differentiation of normal human stem cells (25Haylock D.N. Nilsson S.K. The role of hyaluronic acid in hemopoietic stem cell biology.Regen. Med. 2006; 1: 437-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 26Astachov L. Vago R. Aviv M. Nevo Z. Hyaluronan and mesenchymal stem cells. From germ layer to cartilage and bone.Front. Biosci. 2011; 16: 261-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). All CD44 isoforms contain an HA-binding site in their extracellular domain and thereby serve as a major cell surface receptor for HA (27Underhill C. CD44. The hyaluronan receptor.J. Cell Sci. 1992; 103: 293-298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The fact that both CD44 and HA are overexpressed at tumor attachment sites and that HA binding to CD44 stimulates a variety of tumor cell-specific functions and tumor progression (5Wang S.J.

The stem cell marker, Nanog, is an important transcription factor involved in the self-renewal and maintenance of pluripotency in the inner cell mass of mammalian embryos and embryonic stem (ES) cells (30Chambers I.

Nanog signaling is regulated by interactions among various pluripotent stem cell regulators (e.g. Rex1, Sox2, and Oct3/4) that together control the expression of a set of target genes required for ES cell pluripotency (32Kuroda T.

Recently, several tumor cell types have been shown to express various embryonic stem cell markers, including Nanog (6Bourguignon L.Y. Earle C. Wong G. Spevak C.C. Krueger K.

The Nanog family of proteins has also been found to act as growth-promoting regulators in various different tumor cells (37Zhang J. Wang X. Li M. Han J. Chen B. Wang B. Dai J. NANOGP8 is a retrogene expressed in cancers.FEBS J. 2006; 273: 1723-1730Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our recent work indicates that HA binding to epithelial tumor cells promotes Nanog protein association with CD44, followed by Nanog activation and the expression of pluripotent stem cell regulators (35Bourguignon L.Y.

Whether Nanog participates in HNSCC-specific CSC signaling and functions remains to be determined.

SOX proteins, including SOX2, bind to specific DNA sequences (C(T/A)TTG(T/A)(T/A)) by means of their high mobility group domains as transcription factors in regulating their target gene expression (38Kamachi Y. Uchikawa M. Kondoh H. Pairing SOX off. With partners in the regulation of embryonic development.Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 182-187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Because SOX2 by itself lacks strong affinity for DNA binding, it relies on forming a complex with other transcription factors (38Kamachi Y. Uchikawa M. Kondoh H. Pairing SOX off. With partners in the regulation of embryonic development.Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 182-187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Recently, a number of studies have linked SOX2 overexpression with human cancers (41Dong C. Wilhelm D. Koopman P. Sox genes and cancer.Genome Res. 2004; 105: 442-447Google Scholar). However, information regarding the role of SOX2 in cancer development is very limited. Oct4 (encoded by POU5f, also known as Oct3 or Oct3/4) belongs to the POU transcription factor family, in which the members regulate their target gene expression by binding to an octameric sequence motif containing the AGTCAAAT consensus sequence (42Pesce M. Schöler H.R. Oct-4. Gatekeeper in the beginnings of mammalian development.Stem Cells. 2001; 19: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar, 62Herr W. Cleary M.A The POU domain. Versatility in transcriptional regulation by a flexible two-in-one DNA-binding domain.Gene Dev. 1995; 9: 1679-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). The Oct4 protein contains three functional domains, including POU (pit-Oct-Unc), DNA binding domain, an N-terminal transactivation domain, and a C-terminal cell type-specific transactivation domain (42Pesce M. Schöler H.R. Oct-4. Gatekeeper in the beginnings of mammalian development.Stem Cells. 2001; 19: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar, 62Herr W. Cleary M.A The POU domain. Versatility in transcriptional regulation by a flexible two-in-one DNA-binding domain.Gene Dev. 1995; 9: 1679-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Oct4 was first identified as a stem cell-specific and germ line-specific transcription factor in mice (43Nichols J. Zevnik B. Anastassiadis K. Niwa H. Klewe-Nebenius D. Chambers I. Schöler H. Smith A. Formation of pluripotent stem cells in the mammalian embryo depends on the POU transcription factor Oct4.Cell. 1998; 95: 379-391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2683) Google Scholar). In humans, Oct4 is the product of the OTF3 gene and has been shown to maintain “stemness” in pluripotent stem cells (44Wang X. Dai J. Concise review. Isoforms of OCT4 contribute to the confusing diversity in stem cell biology.Stem Cells. 2010; 28: 885-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Functionally, Oct4 is essential for early embryonic development and functions as a master regulator of the initiation and maintenance of pluripotent cells during embryonic development. It also interacts with other embryonic regulators, such as Nanog and Sox2, to oversee a vast regulatory network that maintains pluripotency and inhibits differentiation (45Kashyap V. Rezende N.C. Scotland K.B. Shaffer S.M. Persson J.L. Gudas L.J. Mongan N.P. Regulation of stem cell pluripotency and differentiation involves a mutual regulatory circuit of the NANOG, OCT4, and SOX2 pluripotency transcription factors with polycomb repressive complexes and stem cell microRNAs.Stem Cells Dev. 2009; 18: 1093-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 61Boyer L.A.

https://openalex.org/W1999214561,"Assessment of heterogeneity is essential in systematic reviews and meta-analyses of clinical trials. The most commonly used heterogeneity measure, I(2), provides an estimate of the proportion of variability in a meta-analysis that is explained by differences between the included trials rather than by sampling error. Recent studies have raised concerns about the reliability of I(2) estimates, due to their dependence on the precision of included trials and time-dependent biases. Authors have also advocated use of 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to express the uncertainty associated with I(2) estimates. However, no previous studies have explored how many trials and events are required to ensure stable and reliable I(2) estimates, or how 95% CIs perform as evidence accumulates.To assess the stability and reliability of I(2) estimates and their 95% CIs, in relation to the cumulative number of trials and events in meta-analysis, we looked at 16 large Cochrane meta-analyses--each including a sufficient number of trials and events to reliably estimate I(2)--and monitored the I(2) estimates and their 95% CIs for each year of publication. In 10 of the 16 meta-analyses, the I(2) estimates fluctuated more than 40% over time. The median number of events and trials required before the cumulative I(2) estimates stayed within +/-20% of the final I(2) estimate was 467 and 11. No major fluctuations were observed after 500 events and 14 trials. The 95% confidence intervals provided good coverage over time.I(2) estimates need to be interpreted with caution when the meta-analysis only includes a limited number of events or trials. Confidence intervals for I(2) estimates provide good coverage as evidence accumulates, and are thus valuable for reflecting the uncertainty associated with estimating I(2)."

However, the molecular mechanisms behind the activation of this γδ T cell population remains unclear. Evidence pointing to a role for the CD277/butyrophilin-3 (BTN3A) molecules in this response led us to investigate the structures of these molecules and their modifications upon binding to an agonist antibody (20.1) that mimics phosphoisoprenoid-mediated Vγ9Vδ2 activation and an antagonist antibody (103.2) that inhibits this reactivity. We find that the three BTN3A isoforms: BTN3A1, BTN3A2, and BTN3A3, have high structural homology to the B7 superfamily of proteins and exist as V-shaped homodimers in solution, associating through the membrane proximal C-type Ig domain. The 20.1 and 103.2 antibodies bind to separate epitopes on the BTN3A Ig-V domain with high affinity but likely with different valencies based on their binding orientation.

In addition, some γδ T cells can directly kill target cells through induction of apoptosis and/or cytolysis. Most γδ T cells in mice and humans reside in the epithelial tissues; however, there is a smaller percentage that circulates in the blood (1Bonneville M. O'Brien R.L.

This γδ T cell population responds to small phosphate-based antigens (phosphoisoprenoids (PiPs)) that derive from microbes (such as hydroxymethyl but-2-enyl pyrophosphate) or are endogenous intermediates of the mevalonate pathway (such as isoprenylpyrophosphate) that accumulate in virally infected and transformed cells (3Bonneville M.

B7 and related molecules contain two immunoglobulin-like domains: an N-terminal Ig-V-like and a C-terminal Ig-C-like domain. These proteins have important functions in immune regulation, acting as co-stimulatory molecules (B7-1 and B7-2) for T cell activation and potent inhibitory molecules (PD-L1) to down-regulate T cell responses (14Greenwald R.J.

A second antibody, 103.2, has been characterized that inhibits this effect. Three BTN3A genes have been characterized in humans, BTN3A1, BTN3A2, and BTN3A3, which are members of a large family of butyrophilin genes located in the telomeric end of the major histocompatibility complex class I region (20Ruddy D.A.

Therefore, to understand the molecular basis for the role of BTN3A in Vγ9Vδ2 reactivity, we have determined the three-dimensional structures of the extracellular domains of the three BTN3A isoforms and studied their binding by single-chain versions (scFvs) of the 20.1 and 103.2 antibodies. Along these lines, we co-crystallized BTN3A1 with 20.1 scFv and 103.2 scFv and determined their complex structures to 3.15 and 3.50 Å, respectively. Our biophysical studies of antibody interaction with BTN3A and their corresponding structures provide insight into the structures and conformations of these proteins that serve to modulate Vγ9Vδ2 T cell activation. The extracellular domains of BTN3A1, 2, and 3 were subcloned into the baculovirus transfer vector pAcGP67A (BD Biosciences) with a C-terminal His6 tag and expressed in High Five insect cells with the baculovirus expression system (BestBac linearized baculovirus DNA; Expression Systems). The proteins were purified with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin and eluted with buffer containing 200 mm imidazole. The proteins were further purified by gel filtration via a Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with HBS (HEPES-buffered saline: 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% azide). Carbohydrate residues added by N-linked glycosylation were removed by endoglycosidase F followed by purification over anion exchange column (GE Healthcare). Peak fractions were pooled and concentrated to 10 mg/ml. Crystallization conditions for the three proteins were as follows: 1) BTN3A1: 0.1 m citric acid, pH 4, 1.6 m ammonium sulfate; 2) BTN3A2: 1 m lithium sulfate, 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 5.6, 0.5 m ammonium sulfate; 3) BTN3A3: 0.1 m citric acid, pH 4, 0.8 m ammonium sulfate, 0.15 m sodium fluoride. Total RNA for the agonist and antagonist antibodies were provided by Dr. Daniel Olive (INSERM). A RT-PCR was performed on RNA according to the manufacturer's protocol (SuperScript One-Step RT-PCR with Platinum Taq; Invitrogen), using degenerate primers described by Wang et al. (38Wang Z.

The proteins were further purified by gel filtration via a Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with HBS. The BTN3A1 protein and scFv antibodies were expressed and purified as described above except that the BTN3A1 protein was treated overnight with carboxypeptidase A after nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid purification. The two proteins were mixed in a 1:1 ratio, and the complex was purified by over a Superdex 200 gel filtration column equilibrated in HBS buffer. For crystallization, the protein complex was concentrated to 10 mg/ml. The BTN3A1-20.1 complex crystallized in the following conditions: 0.15 m KF, 14% PEG 3350. BTN3A1-103.2 complex crystals were optimized in 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 m NaCl, 15% PEG 8000. X-ray data sets were measured on a MAR300 CCD at Beamline 23 ID-D for the BTN3A1 protein and BTN3A1-103.2 complex, Beamline 21 ID-G for the BTN3A2 and 3 proteins, and Beamline 23 ID-B for the BTN3A1-20.1 complex at the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory. The crystals were cryoprotected with 20% glycerol before cooling to 100 K. The data sets were collected with 1° oscillations at a 1.033 × 10−10 m wavelength for the BTN3A1 protein. The BTN3A2 and BTN3A3 structures were collected as BTN3A1 but at a wavelength of 0.99857 × 10−10 m. HKL2000 was used to index, integrate, and scale the data (30Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

The stereochemistry of the model was improved via a backbone optimization procedure incorporating a torsional statistical potential contingent on amino acid type, its secondary structure, as well as the identity of its two neighbors (35DeBartolo J. Colubri A. Jha A.K. Fitzgerald J.E. Freed K.F. Sosnick T.R. Mimicking the folding pathway to improve homology-free protein structure prediction.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The refined BTN3A1 protein was used as search model for the other two BTN3A proteins, as well as the complex structures, and refinement was performed as described above. The variable domains from a IgG2a mouse antibody (Protein Data Bank code 1IGT) were used as a search model for the 20.1 single chain. The 103.2 single chain search model was built using the heavy chain variable domain from a mouse monoclonal antibody (Protein Data Bank code 3DIF) and the light chain variable domain of different structure (Protein Data Bank code 1XGP). The 103.2-BTN3A1 complex data set suffered from severe anisotropy; therefore, the structure factors were processed using the UCLA MBI-Diffraction Anisotropy Server (37Sugita M. Moody D.B. Jackman R.M. Grant E.P. Rosat J.P. Behar S.M. Peters P.J. Porcelli S.A. Brenner M.B. CD1. A new paradigm for antigen presentation and T cell activation.Clin. Immunol. Immunopathol. 1998; 87: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), which significantly improved the density map. All of the structural figures were generated with the program PyMOL (DeLano Scientific). Ramachandran statistics (% preferred region, allowed region, and outliers) for the final models were: BTN3A1: 97.6, 2.4, and 0; BTN3A2: 99, 1, and 0; BTN3A3: 98.1, 1.9, and 0; BTN3A1-20.1 complex: 94.1, 5.9, and 0; and BTN3A1-103.2 complex: 93.7, 6.2, and 0.1. For molecular weight analysis, size exclusion chromatography of the BTN3A proteins alone and in complex with the agonist and the antagonist was performed on a Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with HBS. The system was connected to a 18 angle DAWN-Heleos multiangle laser light scattering detector equipped with a K5 flow cell and a 658-nm laser diode and to an Optilab rEX refractometer operating with a 685-nm laser diode at 25 °C (Wyatt Technology, Santa Barbara, CA). The data were collected at scattering angles θ ranging from 22.5 to 147°. Astra software version 5.3.4 was used to analyze the data and determine the molecular weight of the proteins. All of the surface plasmon resonance was measured at 25 °C on a BiacoreTM 3000 with a nitrilotriacetic acid chip (BiacoreTM). HBS-P buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, and 0.005% (v/v) surfactant Tween 20) was used for all measurements. Approximately 179, 125, and 160 response units of histidine-tagged BTN3A1, 2, and 3 proteins, respectively, were immobilized. Sensograms were fit locally with BiacoreTM 3000 analysis software (BIAevaluation, version 4.1) using 1:1 Langmuir binding with drifting base line. A C-terminal cysteine was engineered into the BTN3A1 and 103.2 single chain constructs. Proteins were expressed and purified as described previously. Of note, ∼90% of the BTN3A1 C-terminal cysteine appeared as a disulfide-linked homodimer when run on nonreducing SDS-PAGE gel. To reduce the disulfide bond, the samples were concentrated to 30 μm in HBS, 0.2 mm DTT was added, and the samples were incubated for 30 min at room temperature. 300 μm dyes, either Atto532 maleimide (68499; Sigma-Aldrich), Cy5 maleimide (PA25031; GE Healthcare), or a 1:1 combination of both dyes, were added to each sample and then incubated for 2 h at room temperature. The samples were then diluted from 100 μl to 400 μl in HBS and dialyzed in a 20-kDa molecular mass cutoff cassette (66005; Thermo Scientific) against 1 liter of HBS for 16 h to remove free dye. The samples were diluted to 400 nm in PBS for spectral measurements. Fluorescence measurements were made on a Fluorolog-3 instrument with the excitation wavelength set to 520 nm. Emission spectra were collected from 665 to 750 nm. Excitation and emission slits were set to 2 and 10 nm, respectively. Background measurements were conducted with singly labeled components. Equal molar amounts of the acceptor-labeled BTN3A1 and donor-labeled 103.2 were mixed for the intermolecular FRET measurements. The 20.1 single chain was added to a 10-fold molar excess for each experiment. FRET efficiency was calculated from measurements of the enhancement of acceptor fluorescence as described previously (28Clegg R.M. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer and nucleic acids.Methods Enzymol. 1992; 211: 353-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). In short, FRET efficiency was calculated as the ratio of acceptor signal after excitation of the donor at 520 nm to direct excitation of acceptor at 650 nm after background subtraction from 665 to 750 nm. The estimated Förster radius (R0) was calculated as R0 = (8.79 × 10−5 × κ2 × n−4 × QD × J(λ))(1/6) where the orientation factor κ2 is assumed to be two-thirds, the index of refraction n assumed to be 1.4, the quantum yield of the donor (QD) reported by the manufacturer was 0.9, and the spectral overlap J(λ) was determined in units of nm4/(Mcm). Purified mouse anti-CD277 mAbs and Fab (clones 20.1 and 103.2) were generated, produced, and purified as described (15Compte E. Pontarotti P. Collette Y. Lopez M. Olive D. Frontline. Characterization of BT3 molecules belonging to the B7 family expressed on immune cells.Eur. J. Immunol. 2004; 34: 2089-2099Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The following monoclonal antibodies were from BD Biosciences: phycoerythrin-cyanin 5.1-labeled anti-CD107a (H4A3), phycoerythrin-labeled anti-IFN-γ (B27). Monensin A was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Live/dead cell marker and Alexa 647-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG were from Invitrogen. Recombinant human IL-2 (rhIL-2) was from Chiron Therapeutics. Human Vγ9Vδ2 (polyclonal line GUI) and CD8pos αβ (clone 13, HCV-1/HLA-A2) T cells were maintained in complete RPMI 1640 medium with 10% FCS, 2 mm l-glutamine, 10 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 IU/ml penicillin, supplemented with 300 IU/ml recombinant human IL-2. Human Vγ9Vδ2 T cells were activated with anti-CD277 (20.1) mAb, scFv, or Fab at the indicated concentrations. Cytolytic activity of γδ T cells was analyzed by measuring CD107a surface mobilization by flow cytometry. In this assay, T cells were activated at 37 °C in complete RPMI 1640 medium containing 10 μm monensin and a fluorochrome-labeled CD107a specific antibody. After 4 h, T cells were harvested and stained with fluorochrome-labeled TCR-specific antibodies and a viability marker (live/dead cell marker, 0.3 μm). Intracellular staining of IFN-γ was performed within the same samples. T cells stained for cell surface markers and viability were next fixed at room temperature for 20 min with 2% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized for 20 min with BD PhosFlow Perm/Wash buffer (BD Biosciences), and incubated for 30 min with fluorochrome-conjugated specific antibodies. The data were collected on FACSCantoII (BD Biosciences). For blocking experiments, human Vγ9Vδ2 T cells were activated by grading doses of bromohydrin pyrophosphate/phosphostim, kindly provided by Innate Pharma, in the presence of 103.2 anti-CD277 mAb or scFv, at 10 μg/ml. The extracellular domains of the three BTN3A isoforms were expressed recombinantly in insect cells for use in crystallization trials. Each isoform readily crystallized in related conditions producing large diamond-shaped plates that diffracted well. Data sets were collected for each isoform, and their structures were determined to 1.9, 2.4, and 2.4 Å resolution for BTN3A1, BTN3A2, and BTN3A3, respectively. The crystallographic and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. One molecule was present in the asymmetric unit for each of the BTN3A isoforms. The general domain structure of BTN3A is shown in Fig. 1 (left panel). BTN3A molecules have two Ig-like domains: an N-terminal Ig-V like domain and a C-terminal Ig-C type domain, similar to other B7 family members. The closest structural homologue, as assessed through the DALI server was programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) (21% amino acid identity and 3.4 Å2 root mean square deviation (RMSD)). However, the Ig-V like domain of BTN3A had higher structural homology (1.0Å RMSD) and amino acid identity (45%) than the single Ig domain containing protein, myelin-oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (27Clements C.S.

The purpose of this work is to investigate the contribution of specific risk factors to social inequalities in cause-specific mortality using a large multi-country cohort of Europeans.A total of 3,456,689 person/years follow-up of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) was analysed. Educational level of subjects coming from 9 European countries was recorded as proxy for socio-economic status (SES). Cox proportional hazard model's with a step-wise inclusion of explanatory variables were used to explore the association between SES and mortality; a Relative Index of Inequality (RII) was calculated as measure of relative inequality.Total mortality among men with the highest education level is reduced by 43% compared to men with the lowest (HR 0.57, 95% C.I. 0.52-0.61); among women by 29% (HR 0.71, 95% C.I. 0.64-0.78). The risk reduction was attenuated by 7% in men and 3% in women by the introduction of smoking and to a lesser extent (2% in men and 3% in women) by introducing body mass index and additional explanatory variables (alcohol consumption, leisure physical activity, fruit and vegetable intake) (3% in men and 5% in women). Social inequalities were highly statistically significant for all causes of death examined in men. In women, social inequalities were less strong, but statistically significant for all causes of death except for cancer-related mortality and injuries.In this European study, substantial social inequalities in mortality among European men and women which cannot be fully explained away by accounting for known common risk factors for chronic diseases are reported."
https://openalex.org/W2011191325,"The purpose of this study was to define the roles of miR-181a in determining sensitivity of cervical cancer to radiation therapy, to explore the underlying mechanism and to evaluate the potential of miR-181a as a biomarker for predicting radio-sensitivity. Tumor specimens from 18 patients with a histological diagnosis of squamous cervical carcinoma (stage IIIB) were used in the micro-RNA profiling and comparison. These patients never received any chemotherapy before radiation therapy. Human cervical cancer cell lines, SiHa and Me180, were used in vitro (cell culture) and in vivo (animal) studies. Transfection of tumor cells with the mimic or inhibitor of miR-181a, and reporter gene assay, were performed to investigate the role of miR-181a in determining radio-sensitivity and the target gene. Higher expression of miR-181a was observed in human cervical cancer specimens and cell lines that were insensitive to radiation therapy, as compared with sensitive cancer specimens and the cell lines. We also found that miR-181a negatively regulated the expression of PRKCD, a pro-apoptotic protein kinase, via targeting its 3'-untranslated region (UTR), thereby inhibiting irradiation-induced apoptosis and decreasing G2/M block. The role of miR-181a in conferring cellular resistance to radiation treatment was validated both in cell culture models and in mouse tumor xenograft models. The effect of miR-181a on radio-resistance was mediated through targeting the 3'-UTR of PRKCD gene. Thus, the expression level of miR-181a in cervical cancer may serve as a biomarker for sensitivity to radiation therapy, and targeting miR-181a may represent a new approach to sensitizing cervical cancer to radiation treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2072983646,"Recent research in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has aroused interest in anterior cingulate cortex and in the neurometabolite glutamate. We report two studies of pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pACC) in pediatric ASD. First, we acquired in vivo single-voxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS) in 8 children with ASD and 10 typically developing controls who were well matched for age, but with fewer males and higher IQ. In the ASD group in midline pACC, we found mean 17.7% elevation of glutamate + glutamine (Glx) (p<0.05) and 21.2% (p<0.001) decrement in creatine + phosphocreatine (Cr). We then performed a larger (26 subjects with ASD, 16 controls) follow-up study in samples now matched for age, gender, and IQ using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (1H MRSI). Higher spatial resolution enabled bilateral pACC acquisition. Significant effects were restricted to right pACC where Glx (9.5%, p<0.05), Cr (6.7%, p<0.05), and N-acetyl-aspartate + N-acetyl-aspartyl-glutamate (10.2%, p<0.01) in the ASD sample were elevated above control. These two independent studies suggest hyperglutamatergia and other neurometabolic abnormalities in pACC in ASD, with possible right-lateralization. The hyperglutamatergic state may reflect an imbalance of excitation over inhibition in the brain as proposed in recent neurodevelopmental models of ASD."
https://openalex.org/W1979821483,"ErbB2/Neu oncogene is overexpressed in 25% of invasive/metastatic breast cancers. We have found that deletion of heat shock factor Hsf1 in mice overexpressing ErbB2/Neu significantly reduces mammary tumorigenesis and metastasis. Hsf1+/−ErbB2/Neu+ tumors exhibit reduced cellular proliferative and invasive properties associated with reduced activated ERK1/2 and reduced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Hsf1+/+Neu+ mammary epithelial cells exposed to TGFβ show high levels of ERK1/2 activity and EMT; this is associated with reduced expression of E-cadherin and increased expression of Slug and vimentin, a mesenchymal marker. In contrast, Hsf1−/−Neu+ or Hsf1+/+Neu+ cells do not exhibit activated ERK1/2 and show reduced EMT in the presence of TGFβ. The ineffective activation of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK1/2 signaling pathway in cells with reduced levels of HSF1 is due to the low levels of HSP90 in complex with RAF1 that are required for RAF1 stability and maturation. These results indicate a powerful inhibitory effect conferred by HSF1 downstream target genes in the inhibition of ErbB2-induced breast cancers in the absence of the Hsf1 gene.

Heat shock proteins in breast cancer progression. A suitable case for treatment?.Int. J. Hyperthermia. 2010; 26: 681-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Hsf1 has also been found to interact with metastasis-associated protein 1 (MTA1), leading to changes in gene expression (25Khaleque M.A. Bharti A. Gong J. Gray P.J. Sachdev V. Ciocca D.R. Stati A. Fanelli M. Calderwood S.K. Heat shock factor 1 represses estrogen-dependent transcription through association with MTA1.Oncogene. 2008; 27: 1886-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Expression levels of Hsf1 target genes such as HSP90, HSP70, and HSP27 are increased in mammary tumors, leading to a decrease in cellular apoptosis (24Calderwood S.K. Heat shock proteins in breast cancer progression. A suitable case for treatment?.Int. J. Hyperthermia. 2010; 26: 681-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Overexpression of ErbB2/Neu has been shown to activate Hsf1 and up-regulate expression of lactate dehydrogenase-A, which leads to an increase in glycolysis. The study shows that glycolysis promoted by ErbB2/Neu occurs, at least in part, through HSF1 (26Zhao Y.H. Zhou M. Liu H. Ding Y. Khong H.T. Yu D. Fodstad O. Tan M. Up-regulation of lactate dehydrogenase A by ErbB2 through heat shock factor 1 promotes breast cancer cell glycolysis and growth.Oncogene. 2009; 28: 3689-3701Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). HSF1 therefore plays a complex role in tumorigenesis and may impact the process of tumorigenesis through multiple pathways depending on the tumor origin. To extend our observation regarding the impact of HSF1 on tumorigenesis in vivo, we have crossed Hsf1−/− mice with MMTV-Her2/Neu+ transgenic mice that constitutively express the wild-type form of Her2/Neu in luminal epithelial cells (27Guy C.T. Webster M.A. Schaller M. Parsons T.J. Cardiff R.D. Muller W.J. Expression of the neu protooncogene in the mammary epithelium of transgenic mice induces metastatic disease.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 10578-10582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that Hsf1−/− mice exhibit resistance to mammary tumorigenesis, and Hsf1+/−-Her2/Neu+ mice exhibit significant resistance to lung metastasis. Tumor and metastasis inhibitory effects exerted by complete or partial deletion of the Hsf1 gene appear to be by interference with the activation of ERK1/2 in the mammary tumor tissue and primary mammary epithelial cells, which leads to inhibition of tumor cell proliferation, reduced EMT, and cellular migration. Generation of Hsf1−/− mice has previously been reported (13Zhang Y. Huang L. Zhang J. Moskophidis D. Mivechi N.F. Targeted disruption of hsf1 leads to lack of thermotolerance and defines tissue-specific regulation for stress-inducible Hsp molecular chaperones.J. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 86: 376-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). MMTV-Her2/Neu (FVB/N TG (MMTVNeu) 202 MUL/JM) (27Guy C.T. Webster M.A. Schaller M. Parsons T.J. Cardiff R.D. Muller W.J. Expression of the neu protooncogene in the mammary epithelium of transgenic mice induces metastatic disease.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 10578-10582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar) mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. Hsf1−/− mice exhibit embryonic lethality in a pure genetic background. Therefore, the background of MMTV-Neu+, Hsf1+/−-MMTV-Neu+ and Hsf1−/−-MMTV-Neu+ mice was F2 C57BL/6–129/SV-Pasteur/FVB. Cohorts of virgin females of all genotypes were observed for development of mammary gland tumors. All animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Use and Care Committee. Wild-type, Hsf1+/−, and Hsf1−/− mice expressing MMTV-Neu were palpated weekly. The date of visible appearance of the tumor was recorded, and mice were euthanized when tumors reached a size of 1–2 cm3. Tumors were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for histological analysis and frozen in OCT for immunohistochemical analysis or were snap-frozen for Western blot analyses. Tumor-free survival was estimated using Kaplan-Meier method. Statistical analysis was performed using the log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test. Significant differences were considered at p < 0.05. shRNAs targeting sequence 1, GTGGACTCCAACCTGGATA, and sequence 2, gatcccGCTCATTCAGTTCCTGATCTTCAAGAGAGATCAGGAACTGAATGAGCttttttggaag, of Hsf1 mRNA were synthesized and subcloned into the retroviral vector pLTHR (pLTHR-shRNA-Hsf1). Ha-RasVal-12 was in the retroviral vector pWZL. For retroviral infection, plasmids were transfected into the packaging cell line, and after 48 h, the supernatant was mixed with 1 μg/ml Polybrene for infection of the appropriate cell line. The virus-infected cells were drug-selected and pooled for analyses. Cells infected with empty vector were used for negative control. For the primary mouse breast epithelial cell culture, mammary glands were dissected from 2-month-old virgin females and digested in DMEM containing 10% FCS plus 1 mg/ml collagenase D overnight. Cells were resuspended in the medium containing 10% FBS, 10 ng/ml EGF, and 5 μg/ml bovine insulin. Cells were allowed to attach to the tissue culture dish three times to eliminate the contaminating fibroblasts. The epithelial cells in the supernatant were quantitated and seeded in culture dishes for analyses. MCF10A mammary epithelial cells were maintained in DMEM/F-12 media containing 5% horse serum, 10 ng/ml EGF, 5 μg/ml insulin, and 50 μg/ml hydrocortisone. To induce EMT, cells were treated with 5 ng/ml of human TGFβ1 (14-8348-62, eBioscience). Numbers four and nine mammary glands were extracted from virgin females and flattened and stretched out on a glass slide. The slides were air-dried for 5 min and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Tissues were transferred to 100% acetone (three times for 1 h) to defat. Tissues were then transferred to 100% and then 90% EtOH (1 h each). Glands were stained in hematoxylin (3 h), rinsed and incubated in 50% EtOH (acidified with 25 ml HCl), and then transferred into 70, 95, and then 100% EtOH (1 h each) and xylene (twice for 1 h). Glands were stored in xylene. For in situ labeling of mammary epithelial cells, 8-week-old mice were injected with 100 μg/g body weight BrdU three times within a period of 24 h. Mammary glands were fixed, processed, sectioned, and analyzed for number of cells labeled with BrdU. For cultured cells, coverslips containing cells were labeled for 2 h with 10 mm BrdU, and following immunostaining, the number of BrdU-positive cells was quantified. Cell migration was performed as described previously (28Bian D. Mahanivong C. Yu J. Frisch S.M. Pan Z.K. Ye R.D. Huang S. The G12/13-RhoA signaling pathway contributes to efficient lysophosphatidic acid-stimulated cell migration.Oncogene. 2006; 25: 2234-2244Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Briefly, the surface under the transwell (8 μm pore size; Costar) was coated with 10 μg/ml collagen I for 16 h at 4 ºC. Mammary epithelial cells cultured from 2-month-old mice were dispersed using trypsin and then resuspended in serum-free medium at a density of 2 × 105 cells/ml. One hundred microliters of cell suspension was added to the upper chamber of the transwell. Cells were allowed to migrate for 48 h in presence or absence of 5 ng/ml TGFβ1. After this time, cells remaining in the upper chamber were removed, and the cells on the undersurface of the transwells were fixed and stained with crystal violet. The number of cells that had migrated to the undersurface was quantified using a phase-contrast microscope. Immunoblotting experiments were performed according to standard protocols (29Hu Y. Mivechi N.F. Association and regulation of heat shock transcription factor 4b with both extracellular signal-regulated kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase and dual-specificity tyrosine phosphatase DUSP26.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 3282-3294Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in lysis buffer, and 30 μg of protein from each sample was resolved by SDS-PAGE and processed for immunoblotting analyses. The following antibodies were used: β-actin, SMA, BrdU (Sigma); vimentin, β-catenin, p-Smad 3, p-Raf, Raf, p-MEK, MEK, p-AKT/T308, p-ERK1/2, ERK1/2, HSF1, Slug, Smad 3 (Cell Signaling); αSMA and keratin 18, ErbB2 (Abcam); Myc tag, p23 (StressGen); E-cadherin, CD31 (BD Biosciences); AKT, p-AKT S473, Ha-Ras, CDC37, Hop (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); N-cadherin (Invitrogen); HSP90a (StressMarq); Ki67 (NeoMarkers). For histology, tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin, and tissue sections were stained with H&E and analyzed using the Elston and Ellis technique (30Elston C.W. Ellis I.O. Pathological prognostic factors in breast cancer. I. The value of histological grade in breast cancer. Experience from a large study with long term follow-up.Histopathology. 1991; 19: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (4785) Google Scholar) for the histological grading system. Tumors were analyzed according to tube formation, nuclear pleomorphism, and number of mitotic cells (30Elston C.W. Ellis I.O. Pathological prognostic factors in breast cancer. I. The value of histological grade in breast cancer. Experience from a large study with long term follow-up.Histopathology. 1991; 19: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (4785) Google Scholar). Analyses were performed to estimate whether tumors were well, moderately, or poorly differentiated. For immunocytochemistry, cells were cultured on glass coverslips, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized (0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS), and blocked (5% milk in PBS) for 30 min at 25 ºC. Fixed cells were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 ºC, rinsed, and incubated for 1 h with fluorescent-conjugated secondary antibody (Molecular Probes). Cells were further rinsed and mounted with Vectashield containing DAPI (Vector Laboratories) and analyzed using a confocal or Zeiss fluorescence microscope. For immunohistochemistry, 7-μm tissue sections were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated in a series of alcohol/water mixtures. Antigen retrieval was performed by placing tissue sections in 10 mm sodium citrate, pH 6.0, and steamed for 30 min. After rinsing in PBS, tissue sections were blocked (3% BSA in PBS for 2 h at 4 ºC) and then incubated in primary antibody (in 3% BSA in PBS plus 1% Tween 20) overnight at 4 ºC. Antibody/antigen was detected using Cy3 fluorescent-conjugated anti-mouse (or rabbit) IgG secondary antibody. Nuclei were stained with DAPI, and sections were processed, mounted, and analyzed as above (31Eroglu B. Moskophidis D. Mivechi N.F.

Neurosci. 2007; 27: 7974-7986Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed with at least 3–40 mice. Data are presented as means ± S.D. Statistical significance between experimental groups was assessed using Student's t test and p < 0.05 was considered significant. To determine the function of Hsf1 in mammary tumorigenesis, we selected the MMTV-Her2/Neu+ transgenic mouse model crossed with Hsf1−/− mice (27Guy C.T. Webster M.A. Schaller M. Parsons T.J. Cardiff R.D. Muller W.J. Expression of the neu protooncogene in the mammary epithelium of transgenic mice induces metastatic disease.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 10578-10582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar). In this model, Her2/Neu expression in mammary epithelial cells induces mammary tumors and lung metastasis in high percentages of mice. For Her2/Neu+ mice (thereafter named Neu+), a cohort of virgin female mice expressing Neu in the presence or absence of the Hsf1 gene was palpated weekly to detect the presence of breast tumors. In contrast to Hsf1−/− Neu+ mice where development of mammary tumors was rare (7%), high percentages of Hsf1+/+Neu+ mice developed tumors (74%) (Fig. 1A). At 499 days post-observation, 22% of the Hsf1+/+Neu+ mice developed tumors, whereas none of the Hsf1+/−Neu+ mice did. At 599 days, 14% of the Hsf1+/+Neu+ mice and 16% of Hsf1+/−Neu+ mice developed tumors. These data suggest a period of delay in the onset of tumorigenesis in the absence of one copy of the Hsf1 gene. There were, however, no significant overall differences between these two groups in terms of tumor-free survival. During the period of observation, only one Hsf1−/−Neu+ mouse developed a small mammary tumor and that occurred at 707 days. Representative H&E staining of the mammary tumors of Hsf1+/+Neu+ and Hsf1+/−Neu+ mice are presented in Fig. 1B. Histological examination of the tumors was performed using criteria defined by Elston and Ellis (30Elston C.W. Ellis I.O. Pathological prognostic factors in breast cancer. I. The value of histological grade in breast cancer. Experience from a large study with long term follow-up.Histopathology. 1991; 19: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (4785) Google Scholar). Using histological criteria, the tumors that developed in Hsf1+/+Neu+ and Hsf1+/−Neu+ mice were approximately comparable. However, significant differences between Hsf1+/+Neu+ and Hsf1+/−Neu+ tumors are noted below. As mentioned before, tumors arising in Neu+ mice metastasize to the lungs with about 70% frequency (27Guy C.T. Webster M.A. Schaller M. Parsons T.J. Cardiff R.D. Muller W.J. Expression of the neu protooncogene in the mammary epithelium of transgenic mice induces metastatic disease.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 10578-10582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar). To determine whether there were differences in metastasis ability between tumors that developed in Hsf1+/+Neu+ or Hsf1+/−Neu+ mice, lungs were collected from tumor-bearing mice and examined for the presence of tumor nodules. Histological analyses indicate that 26% of Hsf1+/+Neu+ mice exhibited lung metastasis, in contrast to 0% of the Hsf1+/−Neu+ mice (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, there were significant differences in multiple parameters in the tumors that developed in Hsf1+/−Neu+ mice compared with Hsf1+/+Neu+ mice. For example, tumors in the Hsf1+/−Neu+ mice exhibited a 40% reduction in Ki-67 immunostaining compared with tumors in the Hsf1+/+Neu+ mice, indicating a lower proliferating capacity of tumor cells in this genetic background (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, Hsf1+/−Neu+ tumors exhibited a significant increase in TUNEL-positive cells indicating cells were undergoing apoptosis (Fig. 1D). The tumors arising in Hsf1−/−Neu+ and Hsf1+/−Neu+ mice also exhibited a significant reduction in vascularization compared with tumors arising in Hsf1+/+Neu+ mice. This was confirmed by CD31 immunostaining (Fig. 1E). ErbB2 expression in cells activates the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK1/2 and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways, leading to cell growth and inhibition of apoptosis (33Baselga J. Swain S.M. Novel anticancer targets. Revisiting ERBB2 and discovering ERBB3.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2009; 9: 463-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar). To detect expression of p-ERK1/2 and p-AKT in Hsf1+/+Neu+ and Hsf1+/−Neu+ tumors, immunoblotting was performed (Fig. 2A). The results show lower levels of p-ERK1/2, p-AKT Ser-473, and Thr-308 in Hsf1+/−Neu+ tumors compared with tumors in Hsf1+/+Neu+ mice. ERK1/2 activity has been implicated in clonal outgrowth and translocation and proliferation of ErbB2-positive cells, suggesting its relevance in the initial steps in ErbB2-mediated tumorigenesis (10Leung C.T. Brugge J.S. Outgrowth of single oncogene-expressing cells from suppressive epithelial environments.Nature. 2012; 482: 410-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). To determine differences in p-ERK1/2 expression between Hsf1+/+Neu+ and Hsf1+/−Neu+ tumors, immunohistochemical (IHC) staining was performed using antibody to detect p-ERK1/2. The data presented in Fig. 2B indicate a significant increase in the number of tumor cells expressing p-ERK1/2 in Hsf1+/+Neu+ compared with Hsf1+/−Neu+ tumors. Similar studies using antibody to p-AKT Ser-473 indicated that the expression of p-AKT in tumors was approximately comparable between the genotypes (data not shown). Activation of ERK1/2 through ErbB2 and RAS has been shown to induce EMT, which plays an important role during development and in tumorigenesis, resulting in tumor cell spreading and increased cellular migration and invasiveness to the surrounding tissue (11Thiery J.P. Epithelial-mesenchymal transitions in development and pathologies.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 740-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (1435) Google Scholar, 34Thiery J.P. Acloque H. Huang R.Y. Nieto M.A. Epithelial-mesenchymal transitions in development and disease.Cell. 2009; 139: 871-890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7556) Google Scholar). As we observed significantly less p-ERK1/2 and a lower number of tumors that metastasized to the lungs in Hsf1+/−Neu+ compared with Hsf1+/+Neu+ tumors, we examined the expression of epithelial and mesenchymal markers in tumors that evolved in Hsf1+/+Neu+ and Hsf1+/−Neu+ mice. IHC staining of epithelial and mesenchymal markers showed lower expression of E-cadherin in Hsf1+/+Neu+ tumors,"

Here we show that Gal-3 accumulates at cell-cell junctions with N-cadherin and the raft marker ganglioside GM1 and contributes to the destabilization of cell-cell junctions. Although the sequestration of EGFR and focal adhesion proteins in the galectin lattice decreases their mobility in the plasma membrane (9Lajoie P. Partridge E.A. Guay G. Goetz J.G. Pawling J.

The galectin lattice also enhances dynamics of GM1 ganglioside binding cholera toxin B subunit (Ctb), but not the unglycosylated raft protein flotillin-2, at cell-cell junctions independently of p120. However, although disruption of the galectin lattice results in accumulation of many proteins in detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs) or rafts, it does not impact on the raft association of cadherins and catenins. Lattice regulation of N-cadherin and Ctb mobility is specific to cell-cell junctions, and our data suggest that the galectin lattice independently regulates the dynamics of N-cadherin and GM1. Gal-3 regulation of the dynamics of N-cadherin and raft components at cell-cell junctions may play a complementary role to p120-catenin in the regulation of junctional stability and thereby tumor cell migration.

Cells were plated 24 h before transfection of DNA, siRNA, or both at the same time at a ratio of 1:2 DNA:RNA using Lipofectamine 2000 in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen). Experiments were performed 48 h after transfection. Where indicated, culture medium was supplemented with 20 mm lactose, 20 mm sucrose, or 1 mm swainsonine for 48 h. Cells were pretreated for 48 h with 20 mm sucrose or lactose or transfected with control or Gal-3-targeted siRNA before the medium was switched to a complete medium containing only 50 μm calcium or before the addition of 1.5 mm EGTA. After 8 min for the low calcium conditions or 30 min for the EGTA treatment, cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde at 37 °C and then permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100. After blocking in 1% BSA, cells were incubated with the primary and secondary antibodies for 1 h. Images for all conditions were acquired using equivalent settings on an Olympus FV1000 confocal microscope. Using the ImageJ image analysis software, the same threshold was applied to all N-cadherin images and, separately, to all β-catenin images based on junctional labeling in control cells. The resulting images were merged, and the Pearson's coefficient was calculated for each field. Statistical analyses were performed on GraphPad Prism 4 using an unpaired Student's t test (two-tailed with a confidence interval of 95%). Cells were plated in 8-well 15μ-Slide ibidi chambers (ibidi GmbH, Munich, Germany) 24 h before transfection. After transfection, the cells were treated, or not with 20 mm lactose or sucrose or with 1 mm swainsonine for 48 h before the experiment. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments were performed at 37 °C for N-cadherin-GFP and AAA-YFP and at 30 °C for FITC-coupled Ctb (9Lajoie P. Partridge E.A. Guay G. Goetz J.G.

Regions of interest, at cell-cell junctions or not, were photobleached and recovery measured over time on an FV100 confocal microscope as described previously (9Lajoie P. Partridge E.A. Guay G.

Cross-linking was performed by incubating confluent cells in 100-mm plates at 4 °C with 2 μg/ml GST-Gal-3 for 20 min before switching the medium to PBS containing 2 mm calcium and 0.1 mg/ml 3,3′-dithiobis[sulfosuccinimidylpropionate] (DTSSP, Pierce) for 1 h. After quenching, proteins were extracted in a lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Lysates were incubated with protein A-coupled Sepharose beads preincubated with 1 μg of mouse anti-N-cadherin (BD Biosciences) or 0.4 μl of rabbit anti-β-catenin (Sigma). After 2 h at 4 °C on rotator, the beads were washed in lysis buffer and suspended in loading buffer containing 25 mm DTT. 2% of the lysate used for immunoprecipitation (input) was loaded in parallel to the pulldown. Western blots were probed with HRP-coupled antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch) and revealed by chemiluminescence or probed with IRDye 700- or 800-conjugated antibodies (Rockland Immunochemicals) and revealed with the Odyssey imaging system (LI-COR Biosciences). Triplex SILAC was conducted as described previously (31Zheng Y.Z. Foster L.J. Biochemical and proteomic approaches for the study of membrane microdomains.J. Proteomics. 2009; 72: 12-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Before labeling, all Mgat5 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS (v/v), 1% l-glutamine (v/v), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (v/v) at 5% CO2 and 37 °C and then transferred to SILAC medium with dialyzed FBS and lysine and arginine isotopologs. To achieve complete labeling, cell populations were amplified 200-fold in the labeling media. Here we refer to the different labels as 0/0 for the normal isotopic abundance Lys and Arg, 4/6 for [2H4]Lys and [13C6]Arg, and 8/10 for [13C615N2]Lys and [13C615N4]Arg. To obtain enough material for effective proteomic analysis, five 15-cm plates of labeled Mgat5 cells were used for each of the 0/0, 4/6, and 8/10 conditions for lactose/sucrose treatment and subsequent detergent-resistant membrane extraction. In the lactose/sucrose treatment experiment, 35% confluent 0/0 and 4/6 Mgat5+/+ cells were treated by adding 20 mm lactose or sucrose, respectively, directly to the growth medium for 48 h with 8/10 cells as the control. DRMs were extracted from SILAC cells as described previously (31Zheng Y.Z. Foster L.J. Biochemical and proteomic approaches for the study of membrane microdomains.J.

Very briefly, cells were solubilized in lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 25 mm 2-(N-morpholino) ethanesulfonic acid, pH 6.5, protease inhibitor mixture). Relative protein concentrations of cell lysates were determined using the Coomassie Plus kit (Pierce), and equal masses of protein from each SILAC condition were mixed together. From this step, lysates were combined as one sample and subjected to sucrose density gradient analysis by first mixing with an equal volume of 90% sucrose (in 25 mm MES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 6.5 (MES-buffered saline)) and then layering with 35 and 5% sucrose. These gradients were then centrifuged for 18 h at 166,000 relative centrifugal force. The white, light-scattering band appearing between 35 and 5% sucrose after centrifugation correspond to DRMs, and this was then diluted out ∼3-fold with MES-buffered saline, and membranes were further pelleted by centrifugation at 166,000 relative centrifugal force for 2 h. All steps were carried out at 4 °C. All analyses involved solution digestions in 1% sodium deoxycholate (50 mm Tris, pH 8) with protein pellets solubilized directly in sodium deoxycholate and then subjected to trypsin digestion. Protein solutions were reduced (1 μg of DTT/50 μg of protein), alkylated (5 μg of iodoacetamide/50 μg of protein), and digested (1 μg of trypsin/50 μg of protein) as described. For each sample, 5 μg (measured by the BCA method) of digested peptides were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) on an LTQ Orbitrap XL (Thermo Fisher, Bremen, Germany). The LTQ Orbitrap XL was on-line-coupled to Agilent 1100 series nanoflow HPLC instruments using a nanospray ionization source (Proxeon Biosystems) holding columns packed into 15-cm-long, 75-μm-inner diameter fused silica emitters (8-μm-diameter opening, pulled on a P-2000 laser puller from Sutter Instruments) using 3-μm-diameter ReproSil Pur C18 beads. Buffer A consisted of 0.5% acetic acid, and buffer B consisted of 0.5% acetic acid and 80% acetonitrile. Gradients were run from 6% B to 30% B over 60 min and then from 30% B to 80% B in the next 10 min, held at 80% B for 5 min, and then dropped to 6% B for another 15 min to recondition the column. The LTQ Orbitrap XL was set to acquire a full range scan at 60,000 resolution from 350 to 1500 mass-to-charge units in the Orbitrap and to simultaneously fragment the top five peptide ions in each cycle in the LTQ. In all experiments, digested peptides were also further fractionated by strong cation exchange chromatography (SCX) into five fractions using 0, 20, 50, 100, and 500 mm of NH4CH3COO and analyzed as above on an LTQ Orbitrap XL. Protein identification and quantification were done using Proteome Discover (v.1.2, Thermo Fisher) and Mascot (v2.3, Matrix Science) to search against the International Protein Index (IPI) Mouse (v3.69, 110,771 sequences; common serum contaminants and human keratins were added, and all reversed sequences were concatenated) database with the following criteria: electrospray ionization-ion trap fragmentation characteristics, tryptic specificity with up to one missed cleavage; ±10 ppm and ±0.6-Da accuracy for MS and MS/MS measurements, respectively; cysteine carbamidomethylation as a fixed modification; and N-terminal protein acetylation, methionine oxidation, and deamidation (Asn-Gln), triplex ([2H4]Lys, [13C6]Arg, [13C615N2]Lys and [13C615N4]Arg) SILAC modifications. Peptide false discovery rate was set at 1%. Quantitation was done using a mass precision of 2 ppm (three times the mass precision is used to create extracted ion chromatograms). After extracting each ion chromatogram, Proteome Discoverer runs several filters to check for, among other things, interfering peaks and the expected isotope pattern, and peptides that do not meet all the criteria are not used in calculating the final ratio for each protein. We consider proteins identified if at least two peptides were observed. Analytical variability of SILAC data in the types of experiments performed here is typically <20% on average, and biological variability was addressed in these experiments by performing three independent replicates of each experiment. Using cell lines derived from epithelial mammary tumors from Mgat5+/+ and Mgat5−/− transgenic mice on a polyoma middle T (PyMT) background, we have previously shown that Mgat5 and the galectin lattice regulate EGFR signaling and focal adhesion dynamics (8Granovsky M.

https://openalex.org/W2000295626,"Background Obesity is associated with low-grade chronic inflammation attributed to dysregulated production, release of cytokines and adipokines and to dysregulated glucose-insulin homeostasis and dyslipidemia. Nutritional interventions such as dieting are often accompanied by repeated bouts of weight loss and regain, a phenomenon known as weight cycling (WC). Methods In this work we studied the effects of WC on the feed efficiency, blood lipids, carbohydrate metabolism, adiposity and inflammatory markers in C57BL/6 male mice that WC two or three consecutive times by alternation of a high-fat (HF) diet with standard chow (SC). Results The body mass (BM) grew up in each cycle of HF feeding, and decreased after each cycle of SC feeding. The alterations observed in the animals feeding HF diet in the oral glucose tolerance test, in blood lipids, and in serum and adipose tissue expression of adipokines were not recuperated after WC. Moreover, the longer the HF feeding was (two, four and six months), more severe the adiposity was. After three consecutive WC, less marked was the BM reduction during SC feeding, while more severe was the BM increase during HF feeding. Conclusion In conclusion, the results of the present study showed that both the HF diet and WC are relevant to BM evolution and fat pad remodeling in mice, with repercussion in blood lipids, homeostasis of glucose-insulin and adipokine levels. The simple reduction of the BM during a WC is not able to recover the high levels of adipokines in the serum and adipose tissue as well as the pro-inflammatory cytokines enhanced during a cycle of HF diet. These findings are significant because a milieu with altered adipokines in association with WC potentially aggravates the chronic inflammation attributed to dysregulated production and release of adipokines in mice."
https://openalex.org/W2025951391,"WEE1 kinase has been described as a major gate keeper at the G2 cell cycle checkpoint and to be involved in tumour progression in different malignant tumours. Here we analysed the expression levels of WEE1 in a series of melanoma patient samples and melanoma cell lines using immunoblotting, quantitative real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry. WEE1 expression was significantly downregulated in patient samples of metastatic origin as compared with primary melanomas and in melanoma cell lines of high aggressiveness as compared with cell lines of low aggressiveness. Moreover, there was an inverse correlation between the expression of WEE1 and WEE1-targeting microRNA miR-195. Further analyses showed that transfection of melanoma cell lines with miR-195 indeed reduced WEE1 mRNA and protein expression in these cells. Reporter gene analysis confirmed direct targeting of the WEE1 3′ untranslated region (3′UTR) by miR-195. Overexpression of miR-195 in SK-Mel-28 melanoma cells was accompanied by WEE1 reduction and significantly reduced stress-induced G2-M cell cycle arrest, which could be restored by stable overexpression of WEE1. Moreover, miR-195 overexpression and WEE1 knockdown, respectively, increased melanoma cell proliferation. miR-195 overexpression also enhanced migration and invasiveness of melanoma cells. Taken together, the present study shows that WEE1 expression in malignant melanoma is directly regulated by miR-195. miR-195-mediated downregulation of WEE1 in metastatic lesions may help to overcome cell cycle arrest under stress conditions in the local tissue microenvironment to allow unrestricted growth of tumour cells."
https://openalex.org/W1987110430,"Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is an arbovirus that is classified as a select agent, an emerging infectious virus, and an agricultural pathogen. Understanding RVFV-host interactions is imperative to the design of novel therapeutics. Here, we report that an infection by the MP-12 strain of RVFV induces phosphorylation of the p65 component of the NFκB cascade. We demonstrate that phosphorylation of p65 (serine 536) involves phosphorylation of IκBα and occurs through the classical NFκB cascade. A unique, low molecular weight complex of the IKK-β subunit can be observed in MP-12-infected cells, which we have labeled IKK-β2. The IKK-β2 complex retains kinase activity and phosphorylates an IκBα substrate. Inhibition of the IKK complex using inhibitors impairs viral replication, thus alluding to the requirement of an active IKK complex to the viral life cycle. Curcumin strongly down-regulates levels of extracellular infectious virus. Our data demonstrated that curcumin binds to and inhibits kinase activity of the IKK-β2 complex in infected cells. Curcumin partially exerts its inhibitory influence on RVFV replication by interfering with IKK-β2-mediated phosphorylation of the viral protein NSs and by altering the cell cycle of treated cells. Curcumin also demonstrated efficacy against ZH501, the fully virulent version of RVFV. Curcumin treatment down-regulated viral replication in the liver of infected animals. Our data point to the possibility that RVFV infection may result in the generation of novel versions of host components (such as IKK-β2) that, by virtue of altered protein interaction and function, qualify as unique therapeutic targets."

For the heritability estimates in Generation R, regression models as proposed by Galton were used. In the Twin Register we used genetic structural equation modelling. Parental height and weight were measured and fetal growth characteristics (femur length and estimated fetal weight) were measured by ultrasounds in 2(nd) and 3(rd) trimester (Generation R only). Height and weight were assessed at multiple time-points from birth to 36 months in both studies.Heritability estimates for length increased from 2(nd) to 3(rd) trimester from 13% to 28%. At birth, heritability estimates for length in singletons and twins were both 26% and 27%, respectively, and at 36 months, the estimates for height were 63% and 72%, respectively. Heritability estimates for fetal weight increased from 2(nd) to 3(rd) trimester from 17% to 27%. For birth weight, heritability estimates were 26% in singletons and 29% in twins. At 36 months, the estimate for twins was 71% and higher than for singletons (42%).Heritability estimates for height and weight increase from second trimester to infancy. This increase in heritability is observed in singletons and twins. Longer follow-up studies are needed to examine how the heritability develops in later childhood and puberty."
https://openalex.org/W1999301835,"Water-pipe (WP) smoking has significantly increased in the last decade worldwide. Compelling evidence suggests that the toxicants in WP smoke are similar to that of cigarette smoke. The WP smoking in a single session could have acute harmful health effects even worse than cigarette smoking. However, there is no evidence as such on long term WP smoking and its impact on chronic health conditions particularly cardiovascular and metabolic conditions. Therefore, we conducted this study to investigate the relationship between WP smoking and metabolic syndrome (MetS). This was a cross-sectional study carried out in Punjab province of Pakistan using the baseline data of a population-based study – Urban Rural Chronic Diseases Study (URCDS). Information was collected by trained nurses regarding the socio-demographic profile, lifestyle factors including WP smoking, current and past illnesses. A blood sample was obtained for measurement of complete blood count, lipid profile and fasting glucose level. MetS was ascertained by using the International Diabetic Federation’s criteria. We carried out multiple logistic regressions to investigate the association between WP smoking and MetS. Final sample included 2,032 individuals – of those 325 (16.0%) were current WP smokers. Age adjusted-prevalence of MetS was significantly higher among current WP smokers (33.1%) compared with non-smokers (14.8%). Water-pipe smokers were three times more likely to have MetS (OR 3.21, 95% CI 2.38–4.33) compared with non-smokers after adjustment for age, sex and social class. WP smokers were significantly more likely to have hypertriglyceridemia (OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.25–2.10), hyperglycaemia (OR 1.82, 95% CI 1.37–2.41), Hypertension (OR 1.95, 95% CI 1.51–2.51) and abdominal obesity (OR 1.93, 95% CI 1.52–2.45). However, there were no significant differences in HDL level between WP smokers and non-smokers. This study suggests that WP smoking has a significant positive (harmful) relationship with MetS and its components."
https://openalex.org/W2052857550,"The strong and consistent relationship between irradiation at a young age and subsequent thyroid cancer provides an excellent model for studying radiation carcinogenesis in humans. We thus evaluated differential gene expression in thyroid tissue in relation to iodine-131 (I-131) doses received from the Chernobyl accident. Sixty three of 104 papillary thyroid cancers diagnosed between 1998 and 2008 in the Ukrainian-American cohort with individual I-131 thyroid dose estimates had paired RNA specimens from fresh frozen tumor (T) and normal (N) tissue provided by the Chernobyl Tissue Bank and satisfied quality control criteria. We first hybridized 32 randomly allocated RNA specimen pairs (T/N) on 64 whole genome microarrays (Agilent, 4×44 K). Associations of differential gene expression (log2(T/N)) with dose were assessed using Kruskall-Wallis and trend tests in linear mixed regression models. While none of the genes withstood correction for the false discovery rate, we selected 75 genes with a priori evidence or P kruskall/P trend <0.0005 for validation by qRT-PCR on the remaining 31 RNA specimen pairs (T/N). The qRT-PCR data were analyzed using linear mixed regression models that included radiation dose as a categorical or ordinal variable. Eleven of 75 qRT-PCR assayed genes (ACVR2A, AJAP1, CA12, CDK12, FAM38A, GALNT7, LMO3, MTA1, SLC19A1, SLC43A3, ZNF493) were confirmed to have a statistically significant differential dose-expression relationship. Our study is among the first to provide direct human data on long term differential gene expression in relation to individual I-131 doses and to identify a set of genes potentially important in radiation carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2142769627,"Clostridium perfringens alpha-toxin is the major virulence factor in the pathogenesis of gas gangrene. Alpha-toxin is a 43-kDa protein with two structural domains; the N-domain contains the catalytic site and coordinates the divalent metal ions, and the C-domain is a membrane-binding site. The role of the exposed loop region (72-93 residues) in the N-domain, however, has been unclear. Here we show that this loop contains a ganglioside binding motif (H … SXWY … G) that is the same motif seen in botulinum neurotoxin and directly binds to a specific conformation of the ganglioside Neu5Acα2-3(Galβ1-3GalNAcβ1-4)Galβ1-4Glcβ1Cer (GM1a) through a carbohydrate moiety. Confocal microscopy analysis using fluorescently labeled BODIPY-GM1a revealed that the toxin colocalized with GM1a and induced clustering of GM1a on the cell membranes. Alpha-toxin was only slightly toxic in β1,4-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase knock-out mice, which lack the a-series gangliosides that contain GM1a, but was highly toxic in α2,8-sialyltransferase knock-out mice, which lack both b-series and c-series gangliosides, similar to the control mice. Moreover, experiments with site-directed mutants indicated that Trp-84 and Tyr-85 in the exposed alpha-toxin loop play an important role in the interaction with GM1a and subsequent activation of TrkA. These results suggest that binding of alpha-toxin to GM1a facilitates the activation of the TrkA receptor and induces a signal transduction cascade that promotes the release of chemokines. Therefore, we conclude that GM1a is the primary cellular receptor for alpha-toxin, which can be a potential target for drug developed against this pathogen."
https://openalex.org/W2047146198,"Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome proteins (WASP) are a family of proteins that all catalyze actin filament branching with the Arp2/3 complex in a variety of actin-based motile processes. The constitutively active C-terminal domain, called VCA, harbors one or more WASP homology 2 (WH2) domains that bind G-actin, whereas the CA extension binds the Arp2/3 complex. The VCA·actin·Arp2/3 entity associates with a mother filament to form a branched junction from which a daughter filament is initiated. The number and function of WH2-bound actin(s) in the branching process are not known, and the stoichiometry of the VCA·actin·Arp2/3 complex is debated. We have expressed the tandem WH2 repeats of N-WASP, either alone (V) or associated with the C (VC) and CA (VCA) extensions. We analyzed the structure of actin in complex with V, VC, and VCA using protein crystallography and hydrodynamic and spectrofluorimetric methods. The partial crystal structure of the VC·actin 1:1 complex shows two actins in the asymmetric unit with extensive actin-actin contacts. In solution, each of the two WH2 domains in V, VC, and VCA binds G-actin in 1:2 complexes that participate in barbed end assembly. V, VC, and VCA enhance barbed end depolymerization like profilin but neither nucleate nor sever filaments, in contrast with other WH2 repeats. VCA binds the Arp2/3 complex in a 1:1 complex even in the presence of a large excess of VCA. VCA·Arp2/3 binds one actin in a latrunculin A-sensitive fashion, in a 1:1:1 complex, indicating that binding of the second actin to VCA is weakened in the ternary complex."
https://openalex.org/W1974071512,"Due to its ability to form biofilms on medical devices, Staphylococcus epidermidis has emerged as a major pathogen of nosocomial infections. In this study, we investigated the role of the two-component signal transduction system ArlRS in regulating S. epidermidis biofilm formation. An ArlRS-deficient mutant, WW06, was constructed using S. epidermidis strain 1457 as a parental strain. Although the growth curve of WW06 was similar to that of SE1457, the mutant strain was unable to form biofilms in vitro. In a rabbit subcutaneous infection model, sterile disks made of polymeric materials were implanted subcutaneously followed with inoculation of WW06 or SE1457. The viable bacteria cells of WW06 recovered from biofilms on the embedded disks were much lower than that of SE1457. Complementation of arlRS genes expression from plasmid in WW06 restored biofilm-forming phenotype both in vivo and in vitro. WW06 maintained the ability to undergo initial attachment. Transcription levels of several genes involved in biofilm formation, including icaADBC, sigB, and sarA, were decreased in WW06, compared to SE1457; and icaR expression was increased in WW06, detected by real-time reverse-transcription PCR. The biofilm-forming phenotype was restored by overexpressing icaADBC in WW06 but not by overexpressing sigB, indicating that ArlRS regulates biofilm formation through the regulation of icaADBC. Gel shift assay showed that ArlR can bind to the promoter region of the ica operon. In conclusion, ArlRS regulates S. epidermidis biofilm formation in an ica-dependent manner, distinct from its role in S. aureus."
https://openalex.org/W2085325354,"Neutrophils are deprived of proliferative capacity and have a tightly controlled lifespan to avoid their persistence at the site of injury. We have recently described that the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), a nuclear factor involved in DNA replication and repair of proliferating cells, is a key regulator of neutrophil survival. In neutrophils, PCNA was localized exclusively in the cytoplasm due to its nuclear-to-cytoplasmic relocalization during granulocytic differentiation. We showed here that leptomycin B, an inhibitor of the chromosome region maintenance 1 (CRM1) exportin, inhibited PCNA relocalization during granulocytic differentiation of HL-60 and NB4 promyelocytic cell lines and of human CD34(+) primary cells. Using enhanced green fluorescent protein fusion constructs, we have demonstrated that PCNA relocalization involved a nuclear export signal (NES) located from Ile-11 to Ile-23 in the PCNA sequence. However, this NES, located at the inner face of the PCNA trimer, was not functional in wild-type PCNA, but instead, was fully active and leptomycin B-sensitive in the monomeric PCNAY114A mutant. To test whether a defect in PCNA cytoplasmic relocalization would affect its antiapoptotic activity in mature neutrophils, a chimeric PCNA fused with the SV40 nuclear localization sequence (NLS) was generated to preclude its cytoplasmic localization. As expected, neutrophil-differentiated PLB985 cells expressing ectopic SV40NLS-PCNA had an increased nuclear PCNA as compared with cells expressing wild-type PCNA. Accordingly, the nuclear PCNA mutant did not show any antiapoptotic activity as compared with wild-type PCNA. Nuclear-to-cytoplasmic relocalization that occurred during myeloid differentiation is essential for PCNA antiapoptotic activity in mature neutrophils and is dependent on the newly identified monomerization-dependent PCNA NES."
https://openalex.org/W2078463097,"Introduction Our previous study has demonstrated Cyclosporin A (CsA) promotes the proliferation of human trophoblast cells. Therefore, we further investigate the intracellular signaling pathway involved in the CsA-induced proliferation of human trophoblast cells. Methods Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed to evaluate the regulation of CsA on CXCL12 secretion in human trophoblast cells. Immunofluorescence analysis and western blotting analysis were used to investigate the role of CXCL12/CXCR4 axis in the CsA-induced epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) phosphorylation in human trophoblast cells. 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdU) cell proliferation assay was performed to analyze the involvement of EGFR and its downstream extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) signaling pathway in the CsA-induced proliferation of human trophoblast cells. Results Low concentration of CsA promoted the secretion of CXCL12, and recombinant human CXCL12 promoted the phosphorylation of EGFR in primary human trophoblast cells and choriocarcinoma cell line JEG-3. The inhibition of CXCL12 or CXCR4 by either neutralizing antibodies or small interfering RNA (siRNA) could completely block the CsA-induced EGFR phosphorylation. The CsA-induced proliferation of human trophoblast cells was effectively abrogated by the EGFR inhibitor AG1478 as well as the ERK inhibitor U0126, but not by the PI3K/PKB inhibitor LY294002. CsA promoted the activation of ERK in JEG-3 cells, which was markedly abrogated in the presence of CXCL12 siRNA, or CXCR4 siRNA, or AG1478. Conclusions CsA may promote EGFR activation via CXCL12/CXCR4 axis, and EGFR downstream ERK signaling pathway may be involved in the CsA-induced proliferation of human trophoblast cells."
https://openalex.org/W2008909722,"The lucrative and highly migratory Atlantic bluefin tuna, Thunnus thynnus (Linnaeus 1758; Scombridae), used to be distributed widely throughout the north Atlantic Ocean, Mediterranean Sea and Black Sea. Its migrations have supported sustainable fisheries and impacted local cultures since antiquity, but its biogeographic range has contracted since the 1950s. Most recently, the species disappeared from the Black Sea in the late 1980s and has not yet recovered. Reasons for the Black Sea disappearance, and the species-wide range contraction, are unclear. However bluefin tuna formerly foraged and possibly spawned in the Black Sea. Loss of a locally-reproducing population would represent a decline in population richness, and an increase in species vulnerability to perturbations such as exploitation and environmental change. Here we identify the main genetic and phenotypic adaptations that the population must have (had) in order to reproduce successfully in the specific hydrographic (estuarine) conditions of the Black Sea. By comparing hydrographic conditions in spawning areas of the three species of bluefin tunas, and applying a mechanistic model of egg buoyancy and sinking rate, we show that reproduction in the Black Sea must have required specific adaptations of egg buoyancy, fertilisation and development for reproductive success. Such adaptations by local populations of marine fish species spawning in estuarine areas are common as is evident from a meta-analysis of egg buoyancy data from 16 species of fish. We conclude that these adaptations would have been necessary for successful local reproduction by bluefin tuna in the Black Sea, and that a locally-adapted reproducing population may have disappeared. Recovery of bluefin tuna in the Black Sea, either for spawning or foraging, will occur fastest if any remaining locally adapted individuals are allowed to survive, and by conservation and recovery of depleted Mediterranean populations which could through time re-establish local Black Sea spawning and foraging."
https://openalex.org/W2012031425,"The family Tymoviridae comprises three plant virus genera, including Tymovirus, Marafivirus, and Maculavirus, which are found in most parts of the world and cause severe agricultural losses. We describe a putatively novel member of the family Tymoviridae, which is isolated from mosquitoes (Culex spp.), referred to as CuTLV.The CuTLV was isolated by cell culture, which replicates and causes cytopathic effects in Aedes albopictus C6/36 cells, but not in mammalian BHK-21 or Vero cells. The complete 6471 nucleotide sequence of CuTLV was determined. The genome of CuTLV is predicted to contain three open reading frames (ORFs). The largest ORF1 is 5307 nucleotides (nt) in length and encodes a putative polypeptide of 1769 amino acids (aa), which contains the conserved motifs for the methyltransferase (MTR), Tymovirus endopeptidase (PRO), helicase (HEL), and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of the replication-associated proteins (RPs) of positive-stranded RNA viruses. In contrast, the ORF1 sequence does not contain the so-called ""tymobox"" or ""marafibox"", the conserved subgenomic RNA promoter present in all tymoviruses or marafiviruses, respectively. ORF2 and ORF3 putatively encode a 248-aa coat protein (CP) and a proline-rich 149-aa polypeptide. The whole genomic nucleotide identity of CuTLV with other members of family Tymoviridae ranged from 46.2% (ChiYMV) to 52.4% (GFkV). Phylogenetic analysis based on the putative RP and CP genes of CuTLV demonstrated that the virus is most closely related to viruses in the genus Maculavirus.The CuTLV is a novel virus related to members of the family Tymoviridae, with molecular characters that are distinct from those of tymoviruses, marafiviruses, and other maculaviruses or macula-like viruses. This is the first report of the isolation of a Tymoviridae-like virus from mosquitoes. Further investigations are required to clarify the origin, replication strategy, and the public health or agricultural importance of the CuTLV."
https://openalex.org/W2080987327,"Methyltransferases are an important group of enzymes with diverse roles that include epigenetic gene regulation. The universal donor of methyl groups for methyltransferases is S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet), which in most cells is synthesized using methyl groups carried by a derivative of folic acid. Another mechanism for AdoMet synthesis uses betaine as the methyl donor via the enzyme betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT, EC 2.1.1.5), but it has been considered to be significant only in liver. Here, we show that mouse preimplantation embryos contain endogenous betaine; Bhmt mRNA is first expressed at the morula stage; BHMT is abundant at the blastocyst stage but not other preimplantation stages, and BHMT activity is similarly detectable in blastocyst homogenates but not those of two-cell or morula stage embryos. Knockdown of BHMT protein levels and reduction of enzyme activity using Bhmt-specific antisense morpholinos or a selective BHMT inhibitor resulted in decreased development of embryos to the blastocyst stage in vitro and a reduction in inner cell mass cell number in blastocysts. The detrimental effects of BHMT knockdown were fully rescued by the immediate methyl-carrying product of BHMT, methionine. A physiological role for betaine and BHMT in blastocyst viability was further indicated by increased fetal resorption following embryo transfer of BHMT knockdown blastocysts versus control. Thus, mouse blastocysts are unusual in being able to generate AdoMet not only by the ubiquitous folate-dependent mechanism but also from betaine metabolized by BHMT, likely a significant pool of methyl groups in blastocysts."
https://openalex.org/W2036022777,"IL-10 is associated with tumor malignancy via immune escape. We hypothesized that IL-10 haplotypes categorized by IL-10 promoter polymorphisms at -1082A>G, -819C>T, and -592C>A might influence IL-10 expression and give rise to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with poor outcomes and relapse. We collected adjacent normal tissues from 385 NSCLC patients to determine IL-10 haplotypes by direct sequencing and polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). Of the 385 tumors, 241 were available to evaluate IL-10 mRNA expression levels by real-time RT-PCR. The influence of IL-10 haplotypes on overall survival (OS) and relapse free survival (RFS) were determined by Kaplan-Meier and multivariate Cox regression analysis. The results showed that IL-10 mRNA levels were significantly higher in tumors with the non-ATA haplotype than with the ATA haplotype (P = 0.004). Patients with the non-ATA haplotype had shorter OS and RFS periods than did patients with the ATA haplotype. This may be associated with the observation that the number of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes was decreased in the tumors with higher levels of IL-10. Consistently, T cells from the peripheral blood of the patients with non-ATA haplotype were more susceptible to apoptosis and less cytotoxic to tumor cells, compared to those from the patients with ATA haplotype. The results suggest that IL-10 can promote tumor malignancy via promoting T cell apoptosis and tumor cell survival, and IL-10 haplotype evaluated by PCR-RFLP or direct sequencing may be used to predict survival and relapse in resected NSCLC, helping clinicians to make appropriate decisions on treatment of the patients."
https://openalex.org/W2076819569,"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is the initial step of the atopic march: the progression from AD to allergic rhinitis and asthma. There is a close association between skin barrier abnormalities and the development of AD and the atopic march. One of cardinal features of AD is that the lesional skin of the majority of AD patients is chronically colonized with Staphylococcus aureus with half isolates producing superantigen enterotoxin B (SEB). Although diverse roles of SEB in the pathogenesis and severity of AD have been recognized, whether SEB contributes to the dermal inflammation that drives lung inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) has not been examined. Here we show a novel role of S. aureus superantigen SEB in augmenting allergen ovalbumin (Ova) induced atopic march through an IL-17A dependent mechanism. When mice epicutaneously (EC) sensitized with allergen Ova, addition of topical SEB led to not only augmented systemic Th2 responses but also a markedly exaggerated systemic Th17/IL-17 immune environment. The ability of SEB in enhancing Th17/IL-17 was mediated through stimulating lymphocytes in spleen and draining lymph nodes to promote IL-6 production. Epicutaneous sensitization of mice with a combination of Ova and SEB significantly enhanced Ova-induced AHR and granulocytic lung inflammation than Ova allergen alone. When IL-17A was deleted genetically, the effects of SEB on augmenting lung inflammation and AHR were markedly diminished. These findings suggest that chronic heavy colonization of enterotoxin producing S. aureus in the skin of patients with atopic dermatitis may have an important role in the development of atopic march via an IL-17A dependent mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2139258238,"Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells can be obtained through in vitro differentiation of both embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). We have previously identified 87 signature genes relevant to RPE cell differentiation and function through transcriptome analysis of both human ESC- and iPSC-derived RPE as well as normal fetal RPE. Here, we profile miRNA expression through small RNA-seq in human ESCs and their RPE derivatives. Much like conclusions drawn from our previous transcriptome analysis, we find that the overall miRNA landscape in RPE is distinct from ESCs and other differentiated somatic tissues. We also profile miRNA expression during intermediate stages of RPE differentiation and identified unique subsets of miRNAs that are gradually up- or down-regulated, suggesting that dynamic regulation of these miRNAs is associated with the RPE differentiation process. Indeed, the down-regulation of a subset of miRNAs during RPE differentiation is associated with up-regulation of RPE-specific genes, such as RPE65, which is exclusively expressed in RPE. We conclude that miRNA signatures can be used to classify different degrees of in vitro differentiation of RPE from human pluripotent stem cells. We suggest that RPE-specific miRNAs likely contribute to the functional maturation of RPE in vitro, similar to the regulation of RPE-specific mRNA expression."

Patients received lapatinib and capecitabine treatment following trastuzumab failure according to the Lapatinib Expanded Access Program. The association between the protein expression levels and clinical outcomes was analyzed.A total of 52 patients were evaluable.

Longer time-to-progression (TTP) was observed in patients with high H2T [p = 0.018, median 5.2 months in high (>14.95) vs. 1.8 in low (<14.95)] and high H3T [p = 0.017, median 5.0 months in high (>0.605) vs. 2.2 in low (<0.605)]. Patients having both high H2T and high H3T had significantly longer TTP [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 0.38 (95% CI 0.20-0.73), p = 0.004] and overall survival [adjusted HR 0.46 (95% CI 0.24-0.89), p = 0.020]. No significant association between p95 and response or survival was observed.These data suggest a correlation between high HER2 and high HER3 expression and treatment outcome, while no significant difference was observed between clinical outcome and p95 expression level in this cohort of HER2-positive, trastuzumab-refractory metastatic breast cancer patients treated with lapatinib and capecitabine."
https://openalex.org/W2137296005,"Populus euphratica is a dominant tree in riparian ecosystems in arid areas of northwest China, but it fails to regenerate in these systems. This study evaluates causes for the failure of sexual and asexual regeneration of this species in the wild. P. euphratica disperses as many as 85743 seeds/m(2) during summer, and the seeds germinate to 92.0% in distilled water and to 60.8% on silt. However, very few seeds (3.6%) can germinate on unflooded soil. The seed-rain season is prolonged by temporal variability in seed dispersal among individuals, which ensures that seedling emergence can occur during favorable conditions (i.e., floods and rainfall). As a result of water shortage and river channeling due to water usage and altered river flows, there are no safe sites on river banks for seed germination, which has led to the failure of P. euphratica to regenerate from seed. Root suckers of P. euphratica were present in 86% of the forest gaps investigated. However, extensive grazing has destroyed many of them and thus has reduced this form of regeneration. This research suggests that human activities are resulting in the failure of P. euphratica to regenerate. Changes in land management such as reduced use of concrete canals in Populus forests and/or reduced sheep grazing in these areas may promote their regeneration."

The changes in glycosidic torsional linkage and the receptor conformations may alter the binding specificity of HAs to the sialylglycans.

The analysis of the glycosidic torsional angles and the pair interaction energy between the receptor and the interacting residues of the binding site reveal that N23G has two binding modes for H1 and H5 and a single binding mode for H3 and H9. For N26G, H1 and H3 has two binding modes, and H5 and H9 has a single binding mode. The direct and water-mediated hydrogen bonding interactions between the receptors and HAs play dominant roles in the structural stabilization of the complexes.

Sialic acids are significant sugar molecules typically found at the outermost ends of N-glycans, O-glycans, or glycosphingolipids. They exist in diversified forms that arise from the modifications of 5th position in neuraminic acid and additional substitutions at the hydroxyl group on the 4th, 7th, 8th, and 9th carbon, and the other diversified forms are generated by the linkages from the 2nd carbon to the penultimate sugar. The most common linkages are Neu5Acα(2–3)Gal (N23G) and Neu5Acα(2–6)Gal (N26G). These structural diversities of sialic acid can govern the recognition by a variety of sialic acid-binding lectins such as influenza virus hemagglutinin. The receptor specificity of influenza viruses is defined in terms of their recognition of sialic acid species (Neu5Ac, Neu5Gc, Neu4,5Ac2, etc.), and the type of glycosidic linkage between sialic acid and the penultimate galactose (31Brossmer R.

MD simulations of 10-ns duration was carried out for the complexes H1-N23G, H1-N26G, H3-N23G, H3-N26G, H5-N23G, H5-N26G, H9-N23G, and H9-N26G. The trajectories are collected over every picosecond, and a total of 10,000 structures are collected for each simulation. To get insights on the atomistic level interactions between the receptor sugar residue and HA protein, graphical software VMD (54Humphrey W. Dalke A. Schulten K. VMD. Visual molecular dynamics.J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (38802) Google Scholar) is used along with the FORTRAN programs developed in-house. The interaction energy between the interacting amino acid residues and the receptor sugar residue is computed by NAMD (55Phillips J.C. Braun R. Wang W. Gumbart J. Tajkhorshid E. Villa E. Chipot C. Skeel R.D. Kalé L. Schulten K. Scalable molecular dynamics with NAMD.J. Comput. Chem. 2005; 26: 1781-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (13191) Google Scholar). The binding free energy between the protein and the receptor is calculated using MM-PBSA module of AmberTools. MOLSCRIPT (56Kraulis P.J. MOLSCRIPT. A program to produce both detailed and schematic plots of protein structures.J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar) is used to render the molecular interactions. The results of 10-ns MD simulations carried out for eight protein-carbohydrate complexes, namely H1-N23G, H1-N26G, H3-N23G, H3-N26G, H5-N23G, H5-N26G, H9-N23G, and H9-N26G, were analyzed using VMD and in-house developed FORTRAN programs. Information about conformational flexibility of the receptors (N23G and N26G), atomistic level interaction between functional groups of receptor (carboxylate, acetyl, glycerol side chain, hydroxyl, and hydroxymethyl), and the binding site residues were obtained to gain insights on the binding affinity of the receptors with different hemagglutinins of influenza A virus. The possible conformations of sialyldisaccharides were deduced from the glycosidic torsional map, and the associated interaction energies of the HA-sialyldisaccharide complexes were calculated. The interaction patterns were proposed based on rigorous analysis of the MD simulation trajectories and superimposed trajectories of various frames having similar conformation for sialyldisaccharides. The relative binding free energies of the sialyldisaccharides-protein complexes were calculated using MM-PBSA module of AmberTools. The binding free energy of the water molecule, which is involved in water mediation, was calculated using NAMD. The conformations of the receptors N23G and N26G at the binding site of hemagglutinin were dictated by glycosidic conformational torsional angles denoted as Φ and Ψ. In addition to the glycosidic torsional angles, N26G possesses an exocyclic torsional angle (ω). The energy of the complexes of each hemagglutinin with N23G and N26G can be compared with each other because the number of atoms in each simulation of similar hemagglutinin was the same. The conformational flexibilities of the receptors N23G and N26G were examined in terms of acetamido group conformation (χn = C5-N5-C10-C11), glycerol side chain conformation (χ1 = C5-C6-C7-C8; χ2 = C6-C7-C8-C9; and χ3 = C7-C8-C9-O9) of sialic acid, and the hydroxymethyl group conformation (χ4 = C4-C5-C6-O6) of galactose. The 10-ns MD simulations on the complexes indicated that in all the HA-N23G complexes χn preferred the trans conformation; χ1 preferred trans for the complexes H1-N23G, H5-N23G, and H9-N23G. For H3-N23G complex, χ1 preferred trans and g−. χ2 preferred g+ for H1-N23G, H5-N23G, and H9-N23G complexes and trans for H3-N23G complex. The terminal hydroxyl group conformation χ3 preferred trans conformation for H1-N23G and H3-N23G complexes, whereas both trans and g+ conformations are preferred for H5-N23G and H9-N23G complexes. χ4 of galactose preferred g+ in all the complexes. In HA-N26G complexes, χn and χ1 preferred trans conformation in all the complexes. χ2 preferred trans conformation for H1-N26G and H3-N26G and both trans and g+ conformations for H5-N26G and H9-N26G complexes. In all the complexes χ3 preferred trans and g+ conformations. The overall structural flexibility of the HA-sialyldisaccharide complexes was measured in terms of root mean square deviation of backbone, and the root mean square deviation trajectories are given as supplemental Fig. S1. The conformational features of the receptor N23G and N26G in the binding site of H1 hemagglutinin were computed, and the conformer distributions based on glycosidic torsions are given in Fig. 2, A and B, respectively. It is evident from Fig. 2A that N23G exists in three different conformational regions inside the binding pocket of H1, and the glycosidic torsional values (ΦN23G-H1 and ΨN23G-H1) of these regions are AN23G-H1 (−150 and −30°), BN23G-H1 (−100 and −50°), and CN23G-H1 (−70 and 0°) with respective population propensities of 37, 35, and 16%. The three regions are denoted as BM1, BM2, and BM3, respectively. When N23G exists in binding mode 1 (BM1), the carboxylate group formed hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl of Thr-133, backbone amide group of Ala-134, and side chain nitrogen of Gln-223. Also, the carboxylate group formed a water-mediated hydrogen bond with side chain hydroxyl of Ser-142. O4 hydroxyl of sialic acid interacted with Arg-130 through water mediation. Amide group of sialic acid was hydrogen-bonded with the backbone carbonyl of Val-132. O7 hydroxyl of sialic acid bonded with the hydroxyl group of Tyr-91. The glycerol side chain hydroxyl oxygens O8 and O9 formed either a direct or water-mediated hydrogen bond with the side chain oxygen of Asp-187. The hydroxymethyl group of galactose residue made a hydrogen bond with the backbone amide group of Ala-224. In BM1, a total of 10 hydrogen bonds (six direct and four water-mediated) are involved in the structural stabilization of the receptor at the binding site of H1 (Fig. 3A), and the interactions are given in Table 1. In binding mode 2 (BM2), the following interactions were observed between the receptor and protein. The interactions between the binding site residues and the carboxylate group, O8 and O9 hydroxyl oxygens of glycerol side chain, were similar to those of BM1. However, the hydroxymethyl group of galactose made a hydrogen bond with the backbone oxygen of Gly-222 instead of Ala-224. A total of nine hydrogen bonds (five direct and four water-mediated) are involved in the structural stabilization of H1-N23G in BM2 (Fig. 3B). At the CN23G-H1 region (BM3), the interaction between binding site residues and sialic acid was similar as was that of BM2. However, the second residue galactose did not make any hydrogen bonds with the binding site residues. Interaction energy between the receptor and the binding site residues of H1 (Tyr-91, Arg-130, Val-132, Thr-133, Ala-134, His-180, Asp-187, Gln-223, Ala-224, and Gly-225) was calculated using NAMD and plotted with respect to time as shown in Fig. 4A. It is evident from Fig. 4A that interaction energy falls into three distinct regions, and this substantiates the above binding modes. In the interaction energy plot, the energy was minimum for 0–3500 ps and corresponded to BM1. The second dominant region was mainly observed between 5000 and 7500 ps, and it corresponded to BM2. The interaction energy graph clearly confirmed that although H1 can accommodate N23G in three distinct modes, BM1 was the best binding mode for H1.FIGURE 3Interactions between H1 and receptor H1-N23G at BM1 (A), H1-N23G at BM2 (B), H1-N26G at BM1 (C), and H1-N26G at BM2 (D).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)TABLE 1Interactions between receptors (N23G and N26G) and the active site residues of H1, H3, H5, and H9 hemagglutininsReceptorBinding modesReceptor atomProtein atoms in H1Binding free energy due to water mediationProtein atoms in H3Binding free energy of due to water mediationProtein atoms in H5Binding free energy due to water mediationProtein atoms in H9Binding free energy due to water mediationkcal/molkcal/molkcal/molkcal/molN23GBinding mode1 (BM1)O1Thr-133 OG1−Ser-128 OG−Ser-132 OG−Ser-130 OG−Ala-134 N−Ser-129 N−Ser-133 N−Ser-131 NGln-223 NE2−Ser-129 OG−Ser-133 OG−Ser-131 OGWAT-Ser-142 OG−3.3 ± 0.3Asn-137 ND2−WAT-Ser-141 OG−3.4 ± 0.3Gln-218 NE2−O4WAT-Arg-130 O−3.2 ± 0.4−−WAT-Ser-129 O−3.1 ± 0.7WAT-Thr-129 O−3.1 ± 0.5N5Val-132 O−Gly-127 O−Val-131 O−Thr-129 O−O7Tyr-91 OH−−−WAT-Glu-186 OE2−3.5 ± 0.5−−O8WAT-Asp-187 OD1−3.4"
https://openalex.org/W2068672156,"Background We propose a new play activity intervention program for mothers and children. Our interdisciplinary program integrates four fields of child-related sciences: neuroscience, preschool pedagogy, developmental psychology, and child and maternal psychiatry. To determine the effect of this intervention on child and mother psychosocial problems related to parenting stress and on the children's cognitive abilities, we performed a cluster randomized controlled trial. Methodology/Principal Findings Participants were 238 pairs of mothers and typically developing preschool children (ages 4–6 years old) from Wakakusa kindergarten in Japan. The pairs were asked to play at home for about 10 min a day, 5 days a week for 3 months. Participants were randomly assigned to the intervention or control group by class unit. The Parenting Stress Index (PSI) (for mothers), the Goodenough Draw-a-Man intelligence test (DAM), and the new S-S intelligence test (NS-SIT) (for children) were administered prior to and 3 months after the intervention period. Pre–post changes in test scores were compared between the groups using a linear mixed-effects model analysis. The primary outcomes were the Total score on the child domain of the PSI (for child psychosocial problems related to parenting stress), Total score on the parent domain of the PSI (for maternal psychosocial problems related to parenting stress), and the score on the DAM (for child cognitive abilities). The results of the PSI suggested that the program may reduce parenting stress. The results of the cognitive tests suggested that the program may improve the children's fluid intelligence, working memory, and processing speed. Conclusions/Significance Our intervention program may ameliorate the children's psychosocial problems related to parenting stress and increase their cognitive abilities.

https://openalex.org/W2069241055,"Metabolic processes result in the release and exchange of H and O atoms from organic material as well as some inorganic salts and gases. These fluxes of H and O atoms into intracellular water result in an isotopic gradient that can be measured experimentally. Using isotope ratio mass spectroscopy, we revealed that slightly over 50% of the H and O atoms in the intracellular water of exponentially-growing cultured Rat-1 fibroblasts were isotopically distinct from growth medium water. We then employed infrared spectromicroscopy to detect in real time the flux of H atoms in these same cells. Importantly, both of these techniques indicate that the H and O fluxes are dependent on metabolic processes; cells that are in lag phase or are quiescent exhibit a much smaller flux. In addition, water extracted from the muscle tissue of rats contained a population of H and O atoms that were isotopically distinct from body water, consistent with the results obtained using the cultured Rat-1 fibroblasts. Together these data demonstrate that metabolic processes produce fluxes of H and O atoms into intracellular water, and that these fluxes can be detected and measured in both cultured mammalian cells and in mammalian tissue."
https://openalex.org/W1966610822,"Our previous studies have suggested that chilling sensitivity of coral oocytes may relate to their relatively high lipid intracellular content and lipid composition. The distribution of lipids during the oocyte development was determined here for the first time in two gorgonian species (Junceella juncea and Junceella fragilis). The main lipid classes in the two gorgonian oocytes were total lipid, wax ester, triacylglycerol, total fatty acid, phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine. The results indicated that early stage oocytes of J. juncea and J. fragilis were found to have increased lipid content than late stage oocytes. The content of wax ester was significantly higher in the early stage oocytes of two gorgonian corals (51.0±2.5 and 41.7±2.9 µg/mm3/oocyte) than those of late stage oocytes (24.0±1.4 and 30.4±1.2 µg/mm3/oocyte, respectively). A substantial amount of phosphatidylethanolamine and total fatty acid was detected at each stage of oocyte development in two gorgonian ranges from 107 to 42 µg/mm3/oocyte and 106 to 48 µg/mm3/oocyte, whilst low levels of phosphatidylcholine were found in two gorgonian oocytes. The levels of total lipid in the late stage oocytes of J. juncea were significantly higher than those of J. fragilis. The observed differences may partially be related to different habitat preferences as higher lipid levels in J. juncea, a deeper-water coral species exposed to lower temperature seawater, might relate to adjustments of cell membranes in order to increase membrane fluidity."
https://openalex.org/W2045557625,"3D domain swapping is an oligomerization process in which structural elements get exchanged between subunits. This mechanism grasped interest of many researchers due to its association with neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease, spongiform encephalopathy etc. Despite the biomedical relevance, very little is known about understanding this mechanism. The quest for ruling principles behind this curious phenomenon that could enable early prediction provided an impetus for our bioinformatics studies.A novel method, HIDE, has been developed to find non-domain-swapped homologues and to identify hinge from domain-swapped oligomers. Non-domain-swapped homologues were identified from the protein structural databank for majority of the domain-swapped entries and hinge boundaries could be recognised automatically by means of successive superposition techniques. Different sequence and structural features in domain-swapped proteins and related proteins have also been analysed.The HIDE algorithm was able to identify hinge region in 83% cases. Sequence and structural analyses of hinge and interfaces reveal amino acid preferences and specific conformations of residues at hinge regions, while comparing the domain-swapped and non-domain-swapped states. Interactions differ significantly between regular dimeric interfaces and interface formed at the site of domain-swapped examples. Such preferences of residues, conformations and interactions could be of predictive value."
https://openalex.org/W2084722877,"The acid-sensitive neuronal potassium leak channel, KCNK3, is vital for setting the resting membrane potential and is the primary target for volatile anesthetics. Recent reports demonstrate that KCNK3 activity is down-regulated by PKC; however, the mechanisms responsible for PKC-induced KCNK3 down-regulation are undefined. Here, we report that endocytic trafficking dynamically regulates KCNK3 activity. Phorbol esters and Group I metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) activation acutely decreased both native and recombinant KCNK3 currents with concomitant KCNK3 surface losses in cerebellar granule neurons and cell lines. PKC-mediated KCNK3 internalization required the presence of both 14-3-3β and a novel potassium channel endocytic motif, because depleting either 14-3-3β protein levels or ablating the endocytic motif completely abrogated PKC-regulated KCNK3 trafficking. These results demonstrate that neuronal potassium leak channels are not static membrane residents but are subject to 14-3-3β-dependent regulated trafficking, providing a straightforward mechanism to modulate neuronal excitability and synaptic plasticity by Group I mGluRs.

Taken together, KCNK3 plays a major role in a number of physiological functions throughout the CNS and periphery, and mechanisms that alter KCNK3 function and availability are likely to have a significant systemic impact. Multiple regulatory proteins control KCNK3 maturation and surface expression. In vitro studies demonstrate C-terminal KNCK3 phosphorylation by PKA correlated to enhanced KCNK3 surface expression, presumably by increased forward trafficking from the ER 2The abbreviations used are: ERendoplasmic reticulumPMAphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetateREK/AAAR335A/E336A/K337ATEAtriethylammoniumTTXtetrodotoxinDHPG(S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycineTftransferrinTfRTf receptorDATdopamine transporterBIMbisindolylmaleimide.

However, the mechanisms mediating KCNK3 regulation are completely unknown. In the current study, we show that PKC-regulated endocytic trafficking acutely modulates KCNK3. KCNK3 C-terminal residues are critical for KCNK3 endocytosis and define a novel K+ channel endocytic signal. Moreover, we demonstrate that 14-3-3β is absolutely required for KCNK3 internalization, a role heretofore not described for a 14-3-3 protein. These results demonstrate that KCNK3 is not static in the plasma membrane but is dynamically trafficked, enabling potassium leak channels to acutely modulate neuronal excitability and potentially contribute to synaptic plasticity. Rat KCNK3 cDNA was the generous gift of Dr. Joseph Cotton (Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA) and was subcloned into pcDNA 3.1(+). HA-KCNK3 was the generous gift of Dr. Douglas Bayliss (University of Virginia), and human 14-3-3β-GFP-C1 cDNA was the gift of Dr. Mitsuo Ikebe (University of Massachusetts Medical School). KCNK3 point mutants were generated using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), and mutant cDNA regions were subcloned back into the wild type KCNK3 plasmids at XcmI/XbaI sites. All mutations were confirmed by dideoxynucleotide cycle sequencing (GeneWiz, South Plainfield, NJ). shRNA constructs were purchased from Origene (Rockville, MD). HEK 293T cells were cultured at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in high glucose DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin. For transfections, HEK cells were seeded in 6-well cultureware 1 day prior to transfection, were transiently transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen), and were assayed 48 h post-transfection. For wide field microscopy, cells were replated onto poly-d-lysine-coated glass coverslips 24 h post-transfection. For knockdown experiments, KCNK3 cDNA and shRNA plasmids were co-transfected into HEK cells and assayed 48 or 72 h post-transfection. P6 Sprague-Dawley rat pups were sacrificed, and their cerebella were surgically removed, minced, and incubated in 0.05% trypsin for 10 min under carbogen at 37 °C. Following trypsinization, tissue was washed three times in CTPM (α-minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with B27, 10 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 250 kilounits/ml DNase I, 25 mm KCl, 6 mg/ml glucose) and was dissociated by triturating progressively through 21–26-gauge needle holes in flame-sealed P1000 pipette tips. Cells were collected by centrifugation (1000 × g, 5 min), resuspended in CTPM, and plated on 25 μg/ml poly-d-lysine-coated glass coverslips (4 × 104 cells/well) or in 12-well cultureware (7.5 × 105 cells/well) for electrophysiological and biochemical assays, respectively. Cells were grown at 37 °C at 5% CO2 for 5 h, and the medium was changed to Neurobasal medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with B27, 10 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 2 mm glutamine, and 25 mm KCl. Neurons were assayed at 4–13 days in vitro. Cells were transiently transfected with recombinant cDNA clones of KCNK3 or KCNK9 channel (0.2 μg), green fluorescent protein (pEGFP-C1; 0.25 μg), and empty plasmid (pcDNA3.1(-), 0.55 μg) using 4 μl of Lipofectamine and 6 μl of PLUSTM reagent (Invitrogen). For shRNA experiments, 2 μg of DNA (1 μg of shRNA, 0.2 μg of channel, 0.8 μg of pcDNA3.1) and 4 μl of Lipofectamine were used. After terminating the transfections (4 h), cells were reseeded onto 8-mm round coverglasses (Warner Instruments) and incubated for an additional 24–48 h. K+ currents were recorded at room temperature (24 ± 2 °C) from voltage-clamped cells. The recording chamber was continuously perfused with extracellular (bath) solution that contained 160 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 8 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5 with NaOH). Patch electrode tip resistance was 1–3 megaohms when filled with intracellular (electrode) solution that contained 126 mm KCl, 20 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm ATP-Na2, 0.3 mm GTP-Na3, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5 with KOH). Transfected (pEGFP-expressing) cells were identified using a GFP filter set of the Axiovert 40 CFL inverted light microscope (Zeiss). Currents were assayed for native-like function using a “family” of traces protocol, in which a cell held at −80 mV was stepped for 50 ms every 15 s to potentials between −120 and +45 mV in 15-mV increments, followed by a 20-ms command to −120 mV. The effect of PKC activation on the current was studied using phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, Tocris Bioscience), which was dissolved in ethanol and diluted in bath solution to 1 μm (0.006% final ethanol concentration). Current amplitude versus time was monitored by holding cells at −80 mV and recording the current during a 50-ms test depolarization (40 mV) every 30 s. Leak current from 5–14-day in vitro CGNs were recorded at room temperature (22–24 °C) using the whole-cell configuration of an Axopatch 200B patch clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Electrodes were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries (Drummond Scientific Co., Broomall, PA) and fire-polished to a tip diameter of ∼1 μm. The total pipette access resistance ranged from 2.0 to 2.5 megaohms. Cells were held at −20 mV to inactive voltage-activated Ca2+, Na+, and K+ channels. Currents were elicited every 10 s by stepping from −20 mV to various test potentials for 50 ms using the CED Signal software suite, version 2.15 (Cambridge Electronic Design, Cambridge, UK). Currents were filtered at 5 kHz using the amplifier's four-pole, low pass Bessel filter, digitized at 20 kHz with a micro1401 interface (CED), and stored on a personal computer. Electrodes were filled with internal solution containing 140 mm KCl, 4 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 4 mm ATP, 0.4 mm GTP, pH 7.5. Cells were patched in calcium Tyrode's solution containing 145 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES with the pH adjusted to 7.5. After rupturing the cell membrane, the bath solution was exchanged by a gravity-fed perfusion system. The external solution contained 140 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm TEA, 0.0005 mm tetrodotoxin (TTX), pH 7.5. TEA and TTX were included in the bath solution to inhibit KCa current and any residual Nav current, respectively. To activate PKC, PMA (1 μm) or (S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG) (1 μm) was added to the bath after 2 min of measuring stable currents. Leak current amplitudes were measured at −20 mV and plotted over time in the presence of agonist for at least 15 min. At this potential, many voltage-gated ion channels in neurons are inactivated, and thus the current is highly enriched in leak channel current. Moreover at −20 mV, the current-voltage relationship is in the linear range, where any changes in current amplitude will be most obvious. Only cells that had a control leak current reversal potential more negative than −40 mV were used in the analyses. Significance of the action of PMA or DHPG was determined using a two-tailed paired t test. Cells were treated as described, and surface proteins were covalently labeled with sulfosuccinimidyl 2-(biotinamido)-ethyl-1,3-dithiopropionate as described previously (35Loder M.K. Melikian H.E.

Cells were lysed in 3.2 mm dodecyl maltoside, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm PMSF for 20 min at 4 °C, and protein concentrations were determined using the BCA protein assay (Pierce). Biotinylated proteins were isolated by batch streptavidin chromatography (overnight, 4 °C), and bound proteins were eluted in 30 μl of 3× Laemmli SDS-PAGE sample buffer with 10% SDS for 15 min at room temperature. Surface proteins and one-half of the total cellular lysate were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose, and KCNK3 was detected by immunoblotting using rat anti-HA antibody (clone 3F10, Roche Applied Science). Immunoreactive bands were detected using a VersaDoc CCD camera system, and non-saturating bands were quantified using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). Cells were transfected in 6-well dishes and, 24 h post-transfection, were trypsinized and replated on poly-d-lysine-coated plates. 48 h post-transfection, cells were treated as indicated, rinsed in PBS, and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde prepared in PBS for 10 min at 25 °C. For Tac surface labeling, cells were incubated with mouse anti-IL2aR antibodies (Millipore) (1:2000) for 2 h at 4 °C prior to fixation and permeabilization. For transferrin (Tf) co-localization experiments, cells were loaded with 20 ng/μl Tf-Alexa594 during drug treatments. Cells were blocked and permeabilized in blocking solution (PBS, 1% IgG/protease-free BSA, 5% goat serum, 0.2% Triton X-100) for 30 min at room temperature, followed by incubation with the indicated primary antibodies for 45 min at 25 °C. Cells were washed with PBS and incubated with Alexa594- or Alexa488-conjugated secondary antibodies (as indicated; Invitrogen) for 45 min at 25 °C. Cells were washed with PBS, dried, and mounted on glass slides with ProLong Gold mounting medium (Molecular Probes). Immunoreactive cells were visualized as described previously (36Holton K.L. Loder M.K. Melikian H.E. Nonclassical, distinct endocytic signals dictate constitutive and PKC-regulated neurotransmitter transporter internalization.Nat.

All images shown are single 0.4-μm planes through the center of each cell. For quantification, the plasma membrane was defined independent of KCNK3 staining by masking the Tac signal in the Alexa488 channel. KCNK3 surface signal intensities in the Alexa594 channel were then measured within the mask, and total KCNK3 cell signal intensities were measured by filling in the mask within the cell. Data are the average of four cells/condition/experiment, quantified over three independent experiments. Previous studies reported PKC-dependent losses in KCNK3 currents in heterologous expression systems (31Lopes C.M. Gallagher P.G. Buck M.E. Butler M.H. Goldstein S.A.

Given that the KCNK3 C terminus encodes SREKLQYSIP, a sequence homologous to the dopamine transporter (DAT) PKC-regulated endocytic signal, FREKLAYAIA, we hypothesized that KCNK3 may undergo PKC-mediated endocytic trafficking as a means to acutely regulate KCNK3 function. To test this possibility, we first asked whether PKC-mediated KCNK3 down-regulation occurred in neurons, by measuring whole cell leak current in CGNs, in which KCNK3 is endogenously expressed (10Talley E.M. Solorzano G. Lei Q. Kim D. Bayliss D.A. Cns distribution of members of the two-pore domain (KCNK) potassium channel family.J.

Upon blocking Nav+ currents with TTX and Kca currents with TEA, we detected acid-sensitive (Fig. 1A) and Zn2+-sensitive (Fig. 1B) components of the leak current, indicating native KCNK3 and KCNK9 expression, respectively, as observed previously in CGNs (15Kang D. Han J. Talley E.M. Bayliss D.A. Kim D. Functional expression of TASK-1/TASK-3 heteromers in cerebellar granule cells.J. Physiol. 2004; 554: 64-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The individual traces shown in Fig. 1C illustrate the decrease in leak current amplitude of CGNs following 15 min of treatment with 1 μm PMA. The average decrease in current amplitude over time can be observed and contrasted with currents recorded in the presence of vehicle, which remained stable over 15 min (Fig. 1E). Consequently, after 15 min of PMA, 63 ± 10% (Fig. 1, C–E) of the leak current remained, and this decrease in amplitude was significantly different from that in vehicle-treated cells (99 ± 13%) as shown in the summary bar graph in Fig. 1D (p < 0.05; two-way Student's t test for two means; n = 8–9/group). Because CGNs express both KCNK3 and KCNK9 subunits, we next determined whether the PKC-mediated inhibition of the acid-sensitive leak current in neurons was specific for one of the KCNK subunits. Native acid-sensitive leak currents are generated by homo- and heterodimers composed of KCNK3 and its homolog, KCNK9 (14Berg A.P. Talley E.M. Manger J.P. Bayliss D.A. Motoneurons express heteromeric TWIK-related acid-sensitive K+ (TASK) channels containing TASK-1 (KCNK3) and TASK-3 (KCNK9) subunits.J.

Functional expression of TASK-1/TASK-3 heteromers in cerebellar granule cells.J. Physiol. 2004; 554: 64-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). KCNK9 is 82% identical to KCNK3; however, their C termini are highly divergent, and KCNK9 does not encode a SREKLQYSIP endocytic motif. Transient expression of KCNK3 in HEK293T cells resulted in robust, acid-sensitive currents in the whole-cell patch clamp configuration (data not shown). Treatment with 1 μm PMA decreased KCNK3 currents to 64.1 ± 3.4% of base-line levels by 15 min (Fig. 2A), which was significantly lower than currents measured in vehicle-treated cells (101.6 ± 5.2% base line; p < 0.001; Student's t test; n = 3–5). In contrast, PMA had no effect on KCNK9 currents (vehicle = 84.8 ± 7.8% base line; PMA = 82.9 ± 3.6% base line; p = 0.89; Student's t test; n = 3) (Fig. 2B). These results suggested that the PMA-induced losses in acid-sensitive leak current in CGNs were specific for channels containing the KCNK3 subunit. PKC-mediated losses in KCNK3 currents could be due to changes in channel conductance, open probability, or surface number due to acute endocytic trafficking, as opposed to forward trafficking from the ER as described previously (27O'Kelly I.

However, the time course of KCNK3 down-regulation in response to PKC activation occurred over minutes, consistent with an endocytic trafficking event. Therefore, we used surface biotinylation to ask whether PKC-mediated KCNK3 functional losses were due to KCNK3 protein losses at the cell surface.

In Ugandan and Kenyan trials, a sexually transmissible agent was not identified in 50–60% of GUD specimens by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. We sought to better define the etiology of GUD in men participating in the Kenyan trial and examine how MMC affects GUD etiology. Methods We defined GUD of unknown etiology as negative for HSV (type 1 and type 2), T. pallidum, and H. ducreyi by PCR, and negative for HSV-2 and T. pallidum by serology. We identified bacterial microbiota in a subset of 59 GUD specimens using multitag pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene, and compared results by unknown vs. STI-associated etiology. Statistical analysis employed Bray-Curtis similarity measure of bacterial community by etiology, hierarchical clustering and logistic regression. Results In 59 GUD specimens from 59 men, 23 (39%) had unknown etiology. Bacterial diversity was greater in GUD of unknown than STI etiology (p = 0.01). Fusobacteria (Fusobacterium spp. and Sneathia spp.) were more commonly detected in men with GUD of unknown etiology [adjusted OR = 5.67; 95% CI: 1.63–19.8] as were Oxobacter spp. and Anaerovorax spp. [adjusted OR = 3.12; 95% CI: 0.83–11.7]. Sequences from these four anaerobic bacterial taxa were more often detected in uncircumcised men than circumcised men (p<0.05). Conclusions Anaerobic bacteria are more common in genital ulcers of uncircumcised men. The specific anaerobic bacteria associated with GUD of unknown etiology have cytotoxic properties that can exacerbate epithelial disruptions leading to ulcer-like appearance. MMC may reduce GUD through a reduction in these anaerobic bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2045013522,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS), by-products of aerobic respiration, promote genetic instability and contribute to the malignant transformation of cells. Among the genes related to ROS metabolism, Bach1 is a repressor of the oxidative stress response, and a negative regulator of ROS-induced cellular senescence directed by p53 in higher eukaryotes. While ROS are intimately involved in carcinogenesis, it is not clear whether Bach1 is involved in this process. We found that senescent Bach1-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) underwent spontaneous immortalization the same as did the wild-type cells. When transduced with constitutively active Ras (H-Ras(V12)), the proliferation and colony formation of these cells in vitro were markedly reduced. When transplanted into athymic nude mice, the growth and vascularization of tumors derived from Bach1-deficient cells were also decreased. Gene expression profiling of the MEFs revealed a new H-Ras(V12) signature, which was distinct from the previously reported signatures in epithelial tumors, and was partly dependent on Bach1. The Bach1-deficient cells showed diminished phosphorylation of MEK and ERK1/2 in response to H-Ras(V12), which was consistent with the alterations in the gene expression profile, including phosphatase genes. Finally, Bach1-deficient mice were less susceptible to 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxidide (4-NQO)-induced tongue carcinoma than wild-type mice. Our data provide evidence for a critical role of Bach1 in cell transformation and tumor growth induced by activated H-Ras(V12)."
https://openalex.org/W2095434789,"Stable maintenance of low-copy-number plasmids requires partition (par) systems that consist of a nucleotide hydrolase, a DNA-binding protein, and a cis-acting DNA-binding site. The FtsZ/tubulin-like GTPase TubZ was identified as a partitioning factor of the virulence plasmids pBtoxis and pXO1 in Bacillus thuringiensis and Bacillus anthracis, respectively. TubZ exhibits high GTPase activity and assembles into polymers both in vivo and in vitro, and its ""treadmilling"" movement is required for plasmid stability in the cell. To investigate the molecular mechanism of pXO1 plasmid segregation by TubZ filaments, we determined the crystal structures of Bacillus cereus TubZ in apo-, GDP-, and guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate (GTPγS)-bound forms at resolutions of 2.1, 1.9, and 3.3 Å, respectively. Interestingly, the slowly hydrolyzable GTP analog GTPγS was hydrolyzed to GDP in the crystal. In the post-GTP hydrolysis state, GDP-bound B. cereus TubZ forms a dimer by the head-to-tail association of individual subunits in the asymmetric unit, which is similar to the protofilament formation of FtsZ and B. thuringiensis TubZ. However, the M loop interacts with the nucleotide-binding site of the adjacent subunit and stabilizes the filament structure in a different manner, which indicates that the molecular assembly of the TubZ-related par systems is not stringently conserved. Furthermore, we show that the C-terminal tail of TubZ is required for association with the DNA-binding protein TubR. Using a combination of crystallography, site-directed mutagenesis, and biochemical analysis, our results provide the structural basis of the TubZ polymer that may drive DNA segregation."

In France, this vaccination is free but administered on a voluntary basis. We investigated the factors influencing HCW influenza vaccination. Methods In June–July 2010, HCW from wards of five French hospitals completed a cross-sectional survey. A multifaceted campaign aimed at improving vaccination coverage in this hospital group was conducted before and during the 2009 pandemic. Using an anonymous self-administered questionnaire, we assessed the relationships between seasonal (SIV) and pandemic (PIV) influenza vaccinations, and sociodemographic and professional characteristics, previous and current vaccination statuses, and 33 statements investigating 10 sociocognitive domains. The sociocognitive domains describing HCWs' SIV and PIV profiles were analyzed using the classification-and-regression–tree method. Results Of the HCWs responding to our survey, 1480 were paramedical and 401 were medical with 2009 vaccination rates of 30% and 58% for SIV and 21% and 71% for PIV, respectively (p<0.0001 for both SIV and PIV vaccinations). Older age, prior SIV, working in emergency departments or intensive care units, being a medical HCW and the hospital they worked in were associated with both vaccinations; while work shift was associated only with PIV. Sociocognitive domains associated with both vaccinations were self-perception of benefits and health motivation for all HCW. For medical HCW, being a role model was an additional domain associated with SIV and PIV. Conclusions Both vaccination rates remained low. Vaccination mainly depended on self-determined factors and for medical HCW, being a role model."
https://openalex.org/W2057205002,"Beyond the physiological and behavioural, differences in appendage morphology between the workers and queens of Apis mellifera are pre-eminent. The hind legs of workers, which are highly specialized pollinators, deserve special attention. The hind tibia of worker has an expanded bristle-free region used for carrying pollen and propolis, the corbicula. In queens this structure is absent. Although the morphological differences are well characterized, the genetic inputs driving the development of this alternative morphology remain unknown. Leg phenotype determination takes place between the fourth and fifth larval instar and herein we show that the morphogenesis is completed at brown-eyed pupa. Using results from the hybridization of whole genome-based oligonucleotide arrays with RNA samples from hind leg imaginal discs of pre-pupal honeybees of both castes we present a list of 200 differentially expressed genes. Notably, there are castes preferentially expressed cuticular protein genes and members of the P450 family. We also provide results of qPCR analyses determining the developmental transcription profiles of eight selected genes, including abdominal-A, distal-less and ultrabithorax (Ubx), whose roles in leg development have been previously demonstrated in other insect models. Ubx expression in workers hind leg is approximately 25 times higher than in queens. Finally, immunohistochemistry assays show that Ubx localization during hind leg development resembles the bristles localization in the tibia/basitarsus of the adult legs in both castes. Our data strongly indicate that the development of the hind legs diphenism characteristic of this corbiculate species is driven by a set of caste-preferentially expressed genes, such as those encoding cuticular protein genes, P450 and Hox proteins, in response to the naturally different diets offered to honeybees during the larval period."
https://openalex.org/W1989249133,"Ca(V)β subunits are formed by a Src homology 3 domain and a guanylate kinase-like (GK) domain connected through a variable HOOK domain. Complete deletion of the Src homology 3 domain (75 residues) as well as deletion of the HOOK domain (47 residues) did not alter plasma membrane density of Ca(V)2.3 nor its typical activation gating. In contrast, six-residue deletions in the GK domain disrupted cell surface trafficking and functional expression of Ca(V)2.3. Mutations of residues known to carry nanomolar affinity binding in the GK domain of Ca(V)β (P175A, P179A, M195A, M196A, K198A, S295A, R302G, R307A, E339G, N340G, and A345G) did not significantly alter cell surface targeting or gating modulation of Ca(V)2.3. Nonetheless, mutations of a quartet of leucine residues (either single or multiple mutants) in the α3, α6, β10, and α9 regions of the GK domain were found to significantly impair cell surface density of Ca(V)2.3 channels. Furthermore, the normalized protein density of Ca(V)2.3 was nearly abolished with the quadruple Ca(V)β3 Leu mutant L200G/L303G/L337G/L342G. Altogether, our observations suggest that the four leucine residues in Ca(V)β3 form a hydrophobic pocket surrounding key residues in the α-interacting domain of Ca(V)2.3. This interaction appears to play an essential role in conferring Ca(V)β-induced modulation of the protein density of Ca(V)α1 subunits in Ca(V)2 channels."
https://openalex.org/W2046764649,"We have applied hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, in conjunction with differential scanning calorimetry and protein stability analysis, to examine solution dynamics of the integrin α1 I domain induced by the binding of divalent cations, full-length type IV collagen, or a function-blocking monoclonal antibody. These studies revealed features of integrin activation and α1I-ligand complexes that were not detected by static crystallographic data. Mg(2+) and Mn(2+) stabilized α1I but differed in their effects on exchange rates in the αC helix. Ca(2+) impacted α1I conformational dynamics without altering its gross thermal stability. Interaction with collagen affected the exchange rates in just one of three metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) loops, suggesting that MIDAS loop 2 plays a primary role in mediating ligand binding. Collagen also induced changes consistent with increased unfolding in both the αC and allosteric C-terminal helices of α1I. The antibody AQC2, which binds to α1I in a ligand-mimetic manner, also reduced exchange in MIDAS loop 2 and increased exchange in αC, but it did not impact the C-terminal region. This is the first study to directly demonstrate the conformational changes induced upon binding of an integrin I domain to a full-length collagen ligand, and it demonstrates the utility of the deuterium exchange mass spectrometry method to study the solution dynamics of integrin/ligand and integrin/metal ion interactions. Based on the ligand and metal ion binding data, we propose a model for collagen-binding integrin activation that explains the differing abilities of Mg(2+), Mn(2+), and Ca(2+) to activate I domain-containing integrins."
https://openalex.org/W2120584764,"Background The NCI-60 is a panel of 60 diverse human cancer cell lines used by the U.S. National Cancer Institute to screen compounds for anticancer activity. We recently clustered genes based on correlation of expression profiles across the NCI-60. Many of the resulting clusters were characterized by cancer-associated biological functions. The set of curated glioblastoma (GBM) gene expression data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) initiative has recently become available. Thus, we are now able to determine which of the processes are robustly shared by both the immortalized cell lines and clinical cancers. Results Our central observation is that some sets of highly correlated genes in the NCI-60 expression data are also highly correlated in the GBM expression data. Furthermore, a “double fishing” strategy identified many sets of genes that show Pearson correlation ≥0.60 in both the NCI-60 and the GBM data sets relative to a given “bait” gene. The number of such gene sets far exceeds the number expected by chance. Conclusion Many of the gene-gene correlations found in the NCI-60 do not reflect just the conditions of cell lines in culture; rather, they reflect processes and gene networks that also function in vivo. A number of gene network correlations co-occur in the NCI-60 and GBM data sets, but there are others that occur only in NCI-60 or only in GBM. In sum, this analysis provides an additional perspective on both the utility and the limitations of the NCI-60 in furthering our understanding of cancers in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2071566313,"A new viewpoint on electoral involvement is proposed from the study of the statistics of the proportions of abstentionists, blank and null, and votes according to list of choices, in a large number of national elections in different countries. Considering 11 countries without compulsory voting (Austria, Canada, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Mexico, Poland, Romania, Spain, and Switzerland), a stylized fact emerges for the most populated cities when one computes the entropy associated to the three ratios, which we call the entropy of civic involvement of the electorate. The distribution of this entropy (over all elections and countries) appears to be sharply peaked near a common value. This almost common value is typically shared since the 1970s by electorates of the most populated municipalities, and this despite the wide disparities between voting systems and types of elections. Performing different statistical analyses, we notably show that this stylized fact reveals particular correlations between the blank/null votes and abstentionists ratios. We suggest that the existence of this hidden regularity, which we propose to coin as a ‘weak law on recent electoral behavior among urban voters’, reveals an emerging collective behavioral norm characteristic of urban citizen voting behavior in modern democracies. Analyzing exceptions to the rule provides insights into the conditions under which this normative behavior can be expected to occur."
https://openalex.org/W2027881575,"Cellular contacts between HIV-1-infected donor cells and uninfected primary CD4(+) T lymphocytes lead to virus transfer into endosomes. Recent evidence suggests that HIV particles may fuse with endosomal membranes to initiate a productive infection. To explore the role of endocytosis in the entry and replication of HIV, we evaluated the infectivity of transferred HIV particles in a cell-to-cell culture model of virus transmission. Endocytosed virus led to productive infection of cells, except when cells were cultured in the presence of the anti-gp120 mAb IgGb12, an agent that blocks virus attachment to CD4, suggesting that endocytosed virus was recycled to the outer cell surface. Confocal microscopy confirmed the colocalization of internalized virus antigen and the endosomal marker dynamin. Additionally, virus transfer, fusion, or productive infection was not blocked by dynasore, dynamin-dependent endosome-scission inhibitor, at subtoxic concentrations, suggesting that the early capture of virus into intracellular compartments did not depend on endosomal maturation. Our results suggest that endocytosis is not a mechanism of infection of primary CD4 T cells, but may serve as a reservoir capable of inducing trans-infection of cells after the release of HIV particles to the extracellular environment."
https://openalex.org/W1965203041,"Neuroblastoma is the most common extracranial solid tumor of childhood. It accounts for 15% of pediatric cancer deaths. Chemotherapy is the mainstay of treatment in children with advanced neuroblastoma. Noscapine, a nontoxic natural compound, can trigger apoptosis in many cancer types. We now show that p53 is dispensable for Noscapine-induced cell death in neuroblastoma cell lines, proapoptotic response to this promising chemopreventive agent is mediated by suppression of survivin protein expression. The Noscapine treatment increased levels of total and Ser15-phosphorylated p53 protein in SK-SY5Y cells, but the proapoptotic response to this agent was maintained even after knockdown of the p53 protein level. Exposure of SK-SY5Y and LA1-5S cells to Noscapine resulted in a marked decrease in protein and mRNA level of survivin as early as 12 hours after treatment. Ectopic expression of survivin conferred statistically significant protection against Noscapine-mediated cytoplasmic histone-associated apoptotic DNA fragmentation. Also, the Noscapine-induced apoptosis was modestly but statistically significantly augmented by RNA interference of survivin in both cell lines. Furthermore, Noscapine-induced apoptotic cell death was associated with activation of caspase-3 and cleavage of PARP. In conclusion, the present study provides novel insight into the molecular circuitry of Noscapine-induced apoptosis to indicate suppression of survivin expression as a critical mediator of this process."

Our objective was to confirm the association between the APOC3 genotype and plasma lipid levels in an HIV-1-infected pediatric cohort exposed to HAART. A total of 130 HIV-1-infected children/adolescents that attended a reference center in Argentina were selected for an 8-year longitudinal study with retrospective data collection. Longitudinal measurements of plasma triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL-C and LDL-C were analyzed under linear or generalized linear mixed models. The contribution of the APOC3 genotype at sites -482, -455 and 3238 to plasma lipid levels prediction was tested after adjusting for potential confounders. Four major APOC3 haplotypes were observed for sites -482/-455/3238, with estimated frequencies of 0.60 (C/T/C), 0.14 (T/C/C), 0.11 (C/C/C), and 0.11 (T/C/G). The APOC3 genotype showed a significant effect only for the prediction of total cholesterol levels (p<0.0001). However, the magnitude of the differences observed was dependent on the drug combination (p = 0.0007) and the drug exposure duration at the time of the plasma lipid measurement (p = 0.0002). A lower risk of hypercholesterolemia was predicted for double and triple heterozygous individuals, mainly at the first few months after the initiation of Ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor-based regimens. We report for the first time a significant contribution of the genotype to total cholesterol levels in a pediatric cohort under HAART. The genetic determination of APOC3 might have an impact on a large portion of HIV-1-infected children at the time of choosing the treatment regimens or on the counter-measures against the adverse effects of drugs."
