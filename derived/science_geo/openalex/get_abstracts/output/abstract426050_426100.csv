https://openalex.org/W2128769815,"Studies of the human microbiome have revealed that even healthy individuals differ remarkably in the microbes that occupy habitats such as the gut, skin and vagina. Much of this diversity remains unexplained, although diet, environment, host genetics and early microbial exposure have all been implicated. Accordingly, to characterize the ecology of human-associated microbial communities, the Human Microbiome Project has analysed the largest cohort and set of distinct, clinically relevant body habitats so far. We found the diversity and abundance of each habitat’s signature microbes to vary widely even among healthy subjects, with strong niche specialization both within and among individuals. The project encountered an estimated 81–99% of the genera, enzyme families and community configurations occupied by the healthy Western microbiome. Metagenomic carriage of metabolic pathways was stable among individuals despite variation in community structure, and ethnic/racial background proved to be one of the strongest associations of both pathways and microbes with clinical metadata. These results thus delineate the range of structural and functional configurations normal in the microbial communities of a healthy population, enabling future characterization of the epidemiology, ecology and translational applications of the human microbiome."
https://openalex.org/W2131415145,"A variety of microbial communities and their genes (the microbiome) exist throughout the human body, with fundamental roles in human health and disease. The National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded Human Microbiome Project Consortium has established a population-scale framework to develop metagenomic protocols, resulting in a broad range of quality-controlled resources and data including standardized methods for creating, processing and interpreting distinct types of high-throughput metagenomic data available to the scientific community. Here we present resources from a population of 242 healthy adults sampled at 15 or 18 body sites up to three times, which have generated 5,177 microbial taxonomic profiles from 16S ribosomal RNA genes and over 3.5 terabases of metagenomic sequence so far. In parallel, approximately 800 reference strains isolated from the human body have been sequenced. Collectively, these data represent the largest resource describing the abundance and variety of the human microbiome, while providing a framework for current and future studies."
https://openalex.org/W1974522038,"Initiating Mitochondrial Repair The mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt) mediates the up-regulation of nuclear encoded mitochondrial chaperone genes in response to mitochondrial dysfunction. How mitochondrial dysfunction is communicated to the nucleus is unclear, but requires the transcription factor, ATFS-1. Nargund et al. (p. 587 , published online 14 June) found that the key point of regulation in UPRmt signaling is mitochondrial protein import efficiency of ATFS-1. In addition to a nuclear localization sequence (NLS), ATFS-1 has a mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS) that is necessary for UPRmt repression. ATFS-1 is normally imported efficiently into mitochondria and degraded by the Lon protease. However, in the presence of stress, some ATFS-1 fails to be imported into mitochondria and is trafficked to the nucleus. The juxtaposition of a C-terminal NLS to an N-terminal MTS in a transcriptional activator thus couples unfolded protein load in the mitochondrial matrix to a rectifying transcriptional response in the nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W2138693996,"Salicylic acid (SA) is a plant immune signal produced after pathogen challenge to induce systemic acquired resistance. It is the only major plant hormone for which the receptor has not been firmly identified. Systemic acquired resistance in Arabidopsis requires the transcription cofactor nonexpresser of PR genes 1 (NPR1), the degradation of which acts as a molecular switch. Here we show that the NPR1 paralogues NPR3 and NPR4 are SA receptors that bind SA with different affinities. NPR3 and NPR4 function as adaptors of the Cullin 3 ubiquitin E3 ligase to mediate NPR1 degradation in an SA-regulated manner. Accordingly, the Arabidopsis npr3 npr4 double mutant accumulates higher levels of NPR1, and is insensitive to induction of systemic acquired resistance. Moreover, this mutant is defective in pathogen effector-triggered programmed cell death and immunity. Our study reveals the mechanism of SA perception in determining cell death and survival in response to pathogen challenge. Plant resistance to pathogen challenge is thought to be mediated through salicylic acid (SA) signalling; here NPR3 and NPR4, paralogues of the transcription cofactor NPR1, are identified as receptors of SA. Salicylic acid is the only major plant hormone for which a receptor has not been firmly identified. It is produced in plants in response to pathogen challenge, and induces systemic acquired resistance against secondary infection. This process requires the transcription cofactor NPR1, which indicated that NPR1 might be a salicylic acid receptor, but NPR1 alone does not bind to the hormone. Here, Xinnian Dong and colleagues identify the NPR1 paralogues NPR3 and NPR4 as salicylic acid receptors with different binding affinities. The authors propose a model for the regulation of NPR1 by NPR3 and NPR4 in response to different levels of salicylic acid."
https://openalex.org/W2066218351,"Dynamic Responses Expression of the tumor suppressor p53 is activated in response to cell stress. The dynamics of p53 activation can vary, depending on the stressor, resulting in either pulsatile or constant p53 levels; however, the functional consequence of these different dynamics is unclear. Purvis et al. (p. 1440 ) developed a method to control p53 dynamics in human cells. Pulsing p53 selectively activated genes involved in cell cycle arrest and DNA repair, allowing recovery from DNA damage. In contrast, sustained p53 promoted induction of terminal genes leading to cellular senescence. Thus, protein dynamics can affect cell fate decisions."

https://openalex.org/W2049661893,Reading the Leaves Excess inputs of nutrients—a type of pollution known as eutrophication—threatens biodiversity and water quality in rivers and streams. Woodward et al. (p. 1438 ; see the Perspective by Palmer and Febria ) studied how one key ecosystem process—leaf-litter decomposition—responds to eutrophication across a large nutrient pollution gradient in 100 European streams. Leaf breakdown was stimulated by low to moderate nutrient concentrations but was inhibited at high rates of nutrient loading.

In principle, valence rules suggest that the boron analog of an alkyne, with a B-B triple bond, ought to be accessible by appending a two-electron donor to each B atom. Braunschweig et al. (p. 1420 ; see the Perspective by Frenking and Holzmann ) now present the synthesis, isolation, and crystallization of a solid, triple-bonded diboryne, with N-heterocyclic carbenes as the terminal substituents, which contains the expected linear bonding geometry."

https://openalex.org/W2015423672,"Secondary Endogenous Small and Interfering In many eukaryotes, Piwi proteins bind small noncoding Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) that function to silence transposons in the germ line and protect the germ line from transposable element–driven recombination and mutation. Bagijn et al. (p. 574 , published online 14 June; see the Perspective by Xiol and Pillai ) show that in the nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans , a messenger RNA (mRNA) that contains a piRNA target sequence gives rise to a second, downstream class of small RNAs known as secondary endogenous small interfering RNAs, or endo siRNAs. These endo siRNAs map to the vicinity of the piRNA complementary sequence in the mRNA target and depend on both Piwi and on factors involved in the related RNA interference pathway for their genesis, but not on the Piwi slicer activity. Mapping the endo siRNAs reveals that piRNAs can target imperfectly matched targets and that piRNAs target a subset of both transposons and endogenous genes for silencing."
https://openalex.org/W2006041837,"Nearshore waters of the California Current System (California CS) already have a low carbonate saturation state, making them particularly susceptible to ocean acidification. We used eddy-resolving model simulations to study the potential development of ocean acidification in this system up to the year 2050 under the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios A2 and B1 scenarios. In both scenarios, the saturation state of aragonite Ω(arag) is projected to drop rapidly, with much of the nearshore region developing summer-long undersaturation in the top 60 meters within the next 30 years. By 2050, waters with Ω(arag) above 1.5 will have largely disappeared, and more than half of the waters will be undersaturated year-round. Habitats along the sea floor will become exposed to year-round undersaturation within the next 20 to 30 years. These projected events have potentially major implications for the rich and diverse ecosystem that characterizes the California CS."
https://openalex.org/W2089227855,"Pathogenic bacteria using a type III secretion system (T3SS) to manipulate host cells cause many different infections including Shigella dysentery, typhoid fever, enterohaemorrhagic colitis and bubonic plague. An essential part of the T3SS is a hollow needle-like protein filament through which effector proteins are injected into eukaryotic host cells. Currently, the three-dimensional structure of the needle is unknown because it is not amenable to X-ray crystallography and solution NMR, as a result of its inherent non-crystallinity and insolubility. Cryo-electron microscopy combined with crystal or solution NMR subunit structures has recently provided a powerful hybrid approach for studying supramolecular assemblies, resulting in low-resolution and medium-resolution models. However, such approaches cannot deliver atomic details, especially of the crucial subunit-subunit interfaces, because of the limited cryo-electron microscopic resolution obtained in these studies. Here we report an alternative approach combining recombinant wild-type needle production, solid-state NMR, electron microscopy and Rosetta modelling to reveal the supramolecular interfaces and ultimately the complete atomic structure of the Salmonella typhimurium T3SS needle. We show that the 80-residue subunits form a right-handed helical assembly with roughly 11 subunits per two turns, similar to that of the flagellar filament of S. typhimurium. In contrast to established models of the needle in which the amino terminus of the protein subunit was assumed to be α-helical and positioned inside the needle, our model reveals an extended amino-terminal domain that is positioned on the surface of the needle, while the highly conserved carboxy terminus points towards the lumen."
https://openalex.org/W1888266266,"An in vivo transposon screen in a pancreatic cancer model identifies frequent inactivation of Usp9x; deletion of Usp9x cooperates with KrasG12D to accelerate rapidly pancreatic tumorigenesis in mice, validating their genetic interaction. An insertional-mutagenesis screen for genes that cooperate with oncogenic KrasG12D in a mouse model of pancreatic cancer has identified the disruption of Usp9x in more than half of the almost 200 distinct tumours analysed. This is surprising, because previous work had indicated that the deubiquitinase USP9X promoted tumour-cell survival. Functional studies show that loss of Usp9x protects pancreatic cancer cells against apoptosis through an effect on multiple oncogenic signalling pathways. In human pancreatic cancers, Usp9x expression is often lost and this correlates with more advanced disease. Approaches that can trigger re-expression of Usp9x may therefore be useful in the treatment of pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) remains a lethal malignancy despite much progress concerning its molecular characterization. PDA tumours harbour four signature somatic mutations1,2,3,4 in addition to numerous lower frequency genetic events of uncertain significance5. Here we use Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon-mediated insertional mutagenesis6,7 in a mouse model of pancreatic ductal preneoplasia8 to identify genes that cooperate with oncogenic KrasG12D to accelerate tumorigenesis and promote progression. Our screen revealed new candidate genes for PDA and confirmed the importance of many genes and pathways previously implicated in human PDA. The most commonly mutated gene was the X-linked deubiquitinase Usp9x, which was inactivated in over 50% of the tumours. Although previous work had attributed a pro-survival role to USP9X in human neoplasia9, we found instead that loss of Usp9x enhances transformation and protects pancreatic cancer cells from anoikis. Clinically, low USP9X protein and messenger RNA expression in PDA correlates with poor survival after surgery, and USP9X levels are inversely associated with metastatic burden in advanced disease. Furthermore, chromatin modulation with trichostatin A or 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine elevates USP9X expression in human PDA cell lines, indicating a clinical approach for certain patients. The conditional deletion of Usp9x cooperated with KrasG12D to accelerate pancreatic tumorigenesis in mice, validating their genetic interaction. We propose that USP9X is a major tumour suppressor gene with prognostic and therapeutic relevance in PDA."

Background: Switching from the acute early initiation to late adaptation response after TLR4 stimulation depends on SirT1. Results: Switching from glucose to fatty acid oxidation between initiation and adaptation responses requires SirT6 and SirT1. Conclusion: Bioenergy integrates metabolism and acute inflammation. Significance: Understanding bioenergy shifts during inflammation may enable development of new therapies. Acute systemic inflammation associated with sepsis involves a sequential shift between the early initiating and later adaptation and immunosuppressive phenotypes (1.Munford R.S. Pugin J. The crucial role of systemic in the innate (non-adaptive) host defense.J. Endotoxin. Res. 2001; 7: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The early response is brief, severe, and often lethal, but the late phase can persist for weeks with sustained morbidity and mortality from immunosuppression and multiorgan failure (reviewed in Ref. 2.McCall C.E. El Gazzar M. Liu T. Vachharajani V. Yoza B. Epigenetics, bioenergetics, and microRNA coordinate gene-specific reprogramming during acute systemic inflammation.J. Leukoc. Biol. 2011; 90: 439-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Cellular bioenergy and metabolism play important roles in regulating acute inflammation and immunity. Early innate and adaptive immune responses require a high energy state supported by glucose-dependent production of ATP and activation of NADPH oxidase to kill microorganisms by reactive oxygen species (3.Schumer W. Metabolic aspects of shock.Surg. Annu. 1974; 6: 1-16PubMed Google Scholar). During this early stage of sepsis, precipitous decreases in ATP production by mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation occur (4.Bolaños J.P. Almeida A. Moncada S. Glycolysis. A bioenergetic or a survival pathway?.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2010; 35: 145-149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), and glycolysis provides the primary source of ATP (4.Bolaños J.P. Almeida A. Moncada S. Glycolysis.

Care Med. 2010; 182: 745-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). In contrast, the later stage of acute inflammation is a low-energy response (6.Singer M. Cellular dysfunction in sepsis.Clin. Chest Med. 2008; 29: 655-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) that heals and eventually restores homeostasis. However, it also represses innate and adaptive immunity (7.Hotchkiss R.S. Coopersmith C.M. McDunn J.E. Ferguson T.A. The sepsis seesaw. Tilting toward immunosuppression.Nat. Med. 2009; 15: 496-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar), as recently documented in human spleen and lung from deceased sepsis patients (8.Boomer J.S. To K. Chang K.C. Takasu O.

Immunosuppression in patients who die of sepsis and multiple organ failure.JAMA. 2011; 306: 2594-2605Crossref PubMed Scopus (1125) Google Scholar). A caution from this important study is that postmortem changes in the viable cells studied might change phenotype. Emerging data support that interactions between inflammation and metabolism play critical roles in chronic inflammatory diseases like obesity with diabetes and atherosclerosis (9.Chawla A. Nguyen K.D. Goh Y.P. Macrophage-mediated inflammation in metabolic disease.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2011; 11: 738-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar, 10.Odegaard J.I. Ricardo-Gonzalez R.R.

Macrophages, inflammation, and insulin resistance.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2010; 72: 219-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (1977) Google Scholar). These chronic inflammatory and metabolic responses are heterogeneous and involve cells of both innate and adaptive immunity. Less is known about how metabolism influences acute inflammation, which progresses through sequential stages. We recently reported that NAD+ informs deacetylase sirtuin 1 (SirT1) 3The abbreviations used are: SirT1deacetylase sirtuin 1TLRToll-like receptorCLPcecal ligation and puncturePDHKpyruvate dehydrogenase kinasePDHApyruvate dehydrogenase EA1PFKphospho-fructose kinaseCPTcarnitine palmitoyl transferasePGCperoxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivatorNamptnicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferaseHIFhypoxia-inducible factor. to direct a sequential epigenetic switch between early and late TLR4 responses in a THP-1 promonocyte sepsis cell model and in human sepsis blood leukocytes (12.Liu T.F.

In this study, we used the same THP-1 sepsis model of TLR4 responses, as well as human and murine sepsis leukocytes to show that NAD+-dependent sensing by SirT1 and SirT6 integrates sequential reprogramming of metabolic and acute inflammatory responses. deacetylase sirtuin 1 Toll-like receptor cecal ligation and puncture pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase pyruvate dehydrogenase EA1 phospho-fructose kinase carnitine palmitoyl transferase peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase hypoxia-inducible factor. Blood was drawn from healthy controls and sepsis subjects according to the Institutional Review Board protocol approved by Wake Forest University School of Medicine. Patients fit the diagnosis of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome with septic shock and were receiving vasopressors (13.Levy M.M. Fink M.P. Marshall J.C. Abraham E. Angus D. Cook D. Cohen J. Opal S.M. Vincent J.L. Ramsay G. 2001 SCCM/ESICM/ACCP/ATS/SIS International Sepsis Definitions Conference.Crit. Care Med. 2003; 31: 1250-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (4655) Google Scholar). Blood leukocytes were isolated as described (12.Liu T.F. Yoza B.K. El Gazzar M. Vachharajani V.T. McCall C.E. NAD+-dependent SIRT1 deacetylase participates in epigenetic reprogramming during endotoxin tolerance.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 9856-9864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The blood leukocytes were 95% viable and subjected to cell culture under the indicated conditions. We used mixed blood leukocytes because both neutrophils and mononuclear cells form silent heterochromatin during the late stage of sepsis that exhibits immunosuppression. The sublethal animal sepsis model was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Wake Forest University School of Medicine, and studies were performed according to the National Institutes of Health guidelines. C57BL/6, 6- to 8-week-old mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME), and the cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) procedure was performed under anesthetization as detailed previously (14.Vachharajani V. Cunningham C. Yoza B. Carson Jr., J. Vachharajani T.J. McCall C. Adiponectin Deficiency exaggerates sepsis-induced microvascular dysfunction in the mouse brain.Obesity. 2012; 20: 498-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In sham mice, all procedures were identical to the CLP mice except for the cecal ligation and puncture. The LD50 of septic mice is 77 h after CLP. Splenocytes from septic mice contain a mixture myeloid-derived suppressor cells that are hyporesponsive to LPS stimulation ex vivo by 18 h after CLP (unpublished observations) 4T. F. Liu, V. T. Vachharajani, B. K. Yoza, and C. E. McCall, unpublished observations.. Thus, the spleen cell phenotype in mice mimics the circulating mixed leukocyte phenotype observed in human sepsis. However, there are two potential limitations from using mixtures of blood or spleen cells obtained from normal or sepsis participants. One is the presence of mixed cell types (neutrophils, monocyte/macrophages, and T or B lymphocytes). The second is that the state of cell differentiation (e.g. immaturity) may differ. A possible advantage of impure populations is the cross-talk that may occur during inflammation (e.g. paracrine effects). THP-1 cells were obtained from the ATCC and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT) in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells were stimulated with 1 μg/ml of Gram-negative bacteria LPS for indicated times to generate different inflammatory phases. This ultrapure LPS product extracted from Escherichia coli serotype 0111:B4 (Sigma) only acts via TLR4 (15.Imler J.L. Hoffmann J.A. Toll signaling. The TIReless quest for specificity.Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 105-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 16.Yumoto H. Chou H.H. Takahashi Y. Davey M. Gibson 3rd, F.C. Genco C.A.

Immun. 2005; 73: 8050-8059Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We have confirmed TLR4-dependent responsivity of LPS in murine macrophages not expressing TLR4 or TLR2 (unpublished observations 5E. Lorenz and C. E. McCall, unpublished observations.). In this model of sepsis responses, the early inflammatory response is assessed at 4–8 h after TLR4 stimulation. The later adaptation stage is present by 24–48 h after TLR4 stimulation and mimics LPS responsivity of sepsis blood leukocytes. In some experiments, cells were pretreated 24 h with 10 nm FK866 (Cayman Chemical) (to deplete cellular NAD+), 10 mm 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG), 1 μm echinomycin (HIF-1α inhibitor), or 10 nm Etomoxir (carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 inhibitor). The same quantity of viable cells as determined by trypan blue exclusion is used for each following experimental treatment after LPS, inhibitors, or electronic transfection. Uptake of glucose and fatty acid were measured by radiolabel (17.Wu X. Motoshima H. Mahadev K. Stalker T.J. Scalia R. Goldstein B.J.

One million cells in 100 μl were starved in triplicate in polypropylene vials for 30 min at 37 °C in glucose-free or serum-free Hanks' buffer. The assay was initiated by the addition of another 100 μl of hot buffer containing 1 μCi of D-[6-14C]glucose (PerkinElmer LifeSciences) and 2.5 μm cold glucose or 1 μCi of 1-[14C]palmitic acid in 0.2% BSA-Hanks' buffer. Glucose transport reaction was terminated after 5 min by washing cells three times in ice-cold PBS containing cytochalasin B (Sigma). Fatty acid uptake was stopped by washing cells with ice-cold PBS containing 0.1% BSA and 200 mm phloretin (Sigma). Cell pellets were solubilized in 0.5 m NaOH, and extracts were neutralized by glacial acetic acid. Cell-associated radioactivity was determined by scintillation β counter. Central wells containing 1 million nutrients-starved cells in triplicates were placed into scintillation tube. After addition of 1 μCi of D-[6-14C]glucose and 2.5 μm cold glucose or 1 μCi of 1-[14C]palmitic acid in 0.2% BSA-Hank's buffer to cells, the scintillation tubes were sealed by a rubber stopper. Cells were incubated at 37 °C in a water bath with rotation. After 1 h of incubation, 200 μl of 2 N HCl was injected into the central well to terminate metabolic reactions, and 500 μl of Hyamine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was injected into the scintillation tube. After overnight shaking at room temperature, the central well was removed and 14CO2 generated by the oxidation of D-[6-14C]glucose or 1-[14C]palmitic acid was detected using β counter. One μCi of D-[6-14C]glucose alone or 1-[14C]palmitic acid alone in same amount of buffer was set for background counts. Glycolysis was measured by the conversion of D-[5-3H(N)]glucose to tritiated water (19.Sambandam N. Lopaschuk G.D. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) control of fatty acid and glucose metabolism in the ischemic heart.Prog. Lipid Res. 2003; 42: 238-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Cells in central wells in glucose-free RPMI (Invitrogen) in triplicates were incubated with 1 μCi of D-[5-3H(N)]glucose (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at 37 °C for 1 h in scintillation tubes containing 1 ml of H2O. The reaction was stopped by adding HCl (1 N final), and the scintillation tube was sealed. [3H]2O generated by enolase activity from D-[5-3H(N)]glucose was vaporized overnight in a 50 °C oven and cooled down overnight at 4 °C. After removal of the central wells, [3H]2O was counted for detection of the glycolytic rate. 1 μCi of D-[5-3H(N)]glucose alone in triplicates was set for background control. 1 μCi of [3H]2O (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) alone in triplicates was set for detection the efficiency of this water vapor exchange. Levels of human TNF-α, IL-10, and RelB mRNA were measured by quantitative real-time RT-PCR using gene-specific TaqMan primer/probe sets in an ABI prism 7000 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). GAPDH mRNA was the internal loading control. For knockdown, 60 pmol of a pool of three target-specific siRNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were electronically transfected into responsive THP-1 cells for 24 h using Amaxa nucleofector kit V and an Amaxa nucleofector II device (Lonza, Inc.) and with 1 μg/ml LPS before harvest. A pool of scrambled siRNAs was transfected as a negative control. Equal amounts (50 μg) of cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Blots were blocked with 5% milk-TBS-Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature and probed overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies against Glut1 (Abcam), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDHK1) (Enzo Life Sciences), pyruvate dehydrogenase E1α1 (PDHA1) (Invitrogen), p-PDHA1-Ser-232 (Calbiochem), phospho-fructose kinase 1 (pFK1) and pFK2 (Novus Biologicals), lactate dehydrogenase (Fitzgerald), CD36 (Thermo Scientific), carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 (CPT-1), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1-α and β (PGC-1α and PGC-1β) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and SirT1 and SirT6 (Cell Signaling Technology). β-actin was used as a loading control and was probed with mouse anti-human β-actin monoclonal antibody (Sigma). Protein complexes were detected by incubation for 1 h at room temperature with secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Sigma) diluted at 1:5000 in blocking buffer and then detected by Enhanced Chemiluminescence Plus (GE Healthcare). Aliquots of 1 million cells were pelleted at 600 × g and resuspended in 80 μl of PBS with 1% BSA. Different cell aliquots were incubated with 10 μl of carboxyfluorescein-conjugated mouse IgG1 anti-human Glut1 antibody (Sigma), FITC-conjugated mouse IgG1anti-human CD36 antibody or isotype control antibody (Stem Cell Technologies), respectively. After incubation for 1 h on ice, cells were washed with PBS/BSA and resuspended in 1 ml of PBS/BSA. A volume of 250 μl of 3.7% formaldehyde was added to each tube, and the cells were assayed on an EPICS-XL flow cytometer (Coulter, Hialeah, FL) with filters set for FITC fluorescence detection. Gates were based on the basis of isotype control antibody staining so that there were <2% positive cells with isotype control antibodies. Ten thousand cells were evaluated for FITC positivity. Data were analyzed using FlowJo software. For Glut1 staining, cells were incubated with 1 μg/ml of mouse anti-human Glut1 monoclonal antibody (R&D Systems) for 1 h, washed, and incubated for another 1 h on ice with rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG1 (1–1000 diluted in blocking buffer, Sigma). CD36 were stained with FITC-anti-human CD36 monoclonal antibody (1:10 diluted in blocking buffer, Stemcell Technologies) for 1 h. After two more washes with PBS, 1000 cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde-PBS, cytospun onto slides, mounted (Victor Labs, Burlingame, CA), and analyzed using an LSM 510 microscope (Zeiss) with the LSM 510 image browser software. Intracellular glycogen was stained with the periodic acid Schiff procedure. Cells were cytospinned onto slides and fixed with Carnoy's fixative buffer containing 60% alcohol, 30% chloroform, and 10% glacial acetic acid. After washing with deionized water, slides were stained with 0.5% (w/v) of periodic acid solution (Sigma) for 10 min followed by Schiff reagent (Sigma) for 5 min. Slides were then counterstained with hematoxylin and examined using a Zeiss Axiocam charge-coupled device camera. Total cellular NADt (NAD+ + NADH) extraction and evaluation were performed using a colorimetric NAD+/NADH assay kit (BioVision) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. NADt extractions were filtered by passing samples through a 10 Kd molecular weight cutoff filter to exclude the possible NADH consuming enzymes. For cellular NADH detection, NAD+ was decomposed before reaction by heating NADt samples for 30 min at 60 °C. Fifty microliters of NADt, NADH samples, or NADH standard were mixed for 10 min with 100 μl of working reagent in duplicate in a 96-well plate. 10 μl of NADH developer reagent was added to each well and incubated for another 1 h. The optical density was read at 450 nm. Cellular NADt and NADH levels of unknown samples were calculated from the standard curve and analyzed by Prism software (GraphPad Prism, version 4.0, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) and were normalized against protein levels. NAD+ levels were obtained by subtraction of the NADH level from NADt. The ratio of NAD+/NADH was calculated as (NADt-NADH)/NADH. Human and mouse plasma were prepared by centrifugation of blood samples to remove cell components. Plasma pyruvate levels were measured using EnzyChromTM pyruvate assay kit (Bioassy Systems) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Briefly, plasma was diluted 2-fold in PBS. 10 μl of samples or pyruvate standards were transferred into 96-well plates in duplicates. 90 μl of working solution was added into each well and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The optical density at 570 nm was read, and the concentration of plasma pyruvate was calculated from a standard curve. Differences of metabolic changes between two related conditions were analyzed by Student unpaired “t” test, and the temporal changes in NAD+, NADH and NAD+/NADH ration following TLR stimulation were analyzed by ANOVA using GraphPad Prism version 4 (San Diego, CA). p values of less than 0.05 were considered significant. We have, over 20 years, found that TLR4-activated THP-1 human monocytic cells simulate sequential innate inflammatory responses of human sepsis blood leukocytes on the basis of gene-specific formation of silenced heterochromatin at acute proinflammatory genes and the presence of RelB-specific generation of adaptation and LPS tolerance during late acute inflammatory responses (20.LaRue K.E. McCall C.E. A labile transcriptional repressor modulates endotoxin tolerance.J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2269-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Here, we further substantiate the temporal sequence of accentuated to repressed expression of proinflammatory TNF-α to immunorepressive IL-10 following TLR4 stimulation of THP-1 cells (Fig. 1A). To determine whether cellular metabolism varies with sequential TLR4 responses, we examined glucose and fatty acid metabolism. We used D-[6-14C]glucose to follow glucose uptake and glucose oxidation, D-[5-3H (N)]glucose for glycolysis analysis, and 1-[14C]palmitic acid for analysis of fatty acid uptake and oxidation. To validate the radiolabeling metabolic assays, we found that 500-fold excess of cold D-glucose or palmitate blocks uptakes of D-[6-14C]glucose and 1-[14C]palmitate up to 96% and 92%, respectively (not shown). We found that glucose uptake increased for 8 h (early acute inflammation phase) and decreased by 24 h (adaptation phase) (Fig. 1B). In contrast, glucose oxidation deceased rapidly and remained low at 24 h (Fig. 1C). We confirmed that increased glucose flux and decreased glucose oxidation during early TLR4 responses reflected enhanced glycolysis (Fig. 1D). Next, we showed that fatty acid uptake was relatively unchanged during the early TLR4 response but significantly increased by 24 h (Fig. 1E). This increase paralleled elevated fatty acid oxidation during the adaptation stage (Fig. 1F). Thus, increased glycolysis dominates early TLR4 responses and fatty acid flux and oxidation dominate late responses in THP-1 cells. Distinct signaling events control glucose and fatty acid metabolism (21.Vats D. Mukundan L. Odegaard J.I. Zhang L. Smith K.L. Morel C.R. Wagner R.A. Greaves D.R. Murray P.J. Chawla A. Oxidative metabolism and PGC-1β attenuate macrophage-mediated inflammation.Cell Metab. 2006; 4: 13-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). We further observed that the Warburg-like glycolytic profile during early acute TLR4 responses is supported by 1) the increased expression of glucose transporter Glut1 and its cell surface translocation, 2) deactivation of mitochondrial PDHA1, and 3) increased expression of glycolytic enzymes pFK1 and pFK2 and accumulation of cellular pyruvate and lactate (Figs. 2, B–G). We also observed that glycogenolysis supports glycolysis during late inflammatory response when Glut1 expression is diminished (data not shown). Increased fatty acid oxidation was associated with increased expression of CD36, a member of the class B scavenger receptor/transporter with a high affinity for long chain fatty acids, and CPT-1, the rate-limiting enzyme for long chain fatty acid mitochondrial transporter and fatty acid oxidation (Fig. 2, H–J). The TLR4-induced expression of CD36 and CPT-1 shown by Western blot analysis was further confirmed by densitometry analysis (Fig. 2H, right panel). We reported previously that Nampt-dependent accumulation of cellular NAD+ coordinates epigenetic reprogramming when TLR4 responses switch from early to late phenotypes (Fig. 3A) (12.Liu T.F. Yoza B.K. El Gazzar M. Vachharajani V.T. McCall C.E. NAD+-dependent SIRT1 deacetylase participates in epigenetic reprogramming during endotoxin tolerance.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 9856-9864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Following early TLR4 activation, cellular NAD+ levels were decreased and then steadily accumulated. Mirroring the high energy requirement, TLR4 also increased NADH levels that later decreased (Fig. 3B). The dynamic changes in cellular NAD+ and NADH levels following TLR response are statistically significant (p = 0.0016 and p = 0.0002, respectively). NAD+/NADH ratios increased (p = 0.0004, Fig. 3C). We then tested whether NAD+-dependent events also regulate the metabolic switch during the sequential TLR4 inflammatory response. To do this, we depleted NAD+ by overnight pretreatment of cells with Nampt-specific inhibitor FK866 followed by TLR4 stimulation for 24 h. FK866 pretreatment decreased the basal rate of glucose oxidation and could not further diminish it without NAD+ after TLR4 activation (Fig. 3D). The reduction of basal glucose oxidation after FK866 treatment could have resulted from the decreased PDHA1 expression. However, inhibition of Nampt activity almost totally blocked late-state TLR4-induced increases in fatty acid oxidation, although the basal rate of fatty acid β oxidation was not altered (Fig. 3E). These observations parallel the early to late epigenetic switching response (12.Liu T.F. Yoza B.K. El Gazzar M. Vachharajani V.T. McCall C.E. NAD+-dependent SIRT1 deacetylase participates in epigenetic reprogramming during endotoxin tolerance.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 9856-9864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The NAD+-dependent metabolic switch is further supported by the increased expression of PDHK1 and the phosphorylation of PDHA1 at PDHK1-specific site PDHA1-Ser-232, the inactive form of PDHA1, and decreased expression of PDHA1 and CPT-1 proteins in the presence of FK866 (Fig. 3F). We then reasoned that NAD+ sensors SirT6 and SirT1 might differentially coordinate the metabolic switching between early and late acute inflammatory responses because SirT6 regulates glycolysis and SirT1 regulates fatty acid oxidation (22.Zhong L. Mostoslavsky R. SIRT6. A master epigenetic gatekeeper of glucose metabolism.Transcription. 2010; 1: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We first examined levels of SirT1 and SirT6 protein and confirmed our previous observation that SirT1 increases after TLR4 stimulation (12.Liu T.F. Yoza B.K. El Gazzar M. Vachharajani V.T. McCall C.E. NAD+-dependent SIRT1 deacetylase participates in epigenetic reprogramming during endotoxin tolerance.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 9856-9864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In contrast, SirT6 was constitutively expressed, decreased after early TLR4 stimulation, and moderately increased during the late adaptation phase (Fig. 4A). We then assessed effects of SirT1 or SirT6 depletion on glucose and fatty acid metabolism. To do this, THP-1 cells were transfected with either control or test siRNAs for 24 h and analyzed 24 h after TLR4 stimulation. Immunoblot analysis showed that SirT6 knockdown caused 90% reduction of SirT6 protein without changing SirT1 levels. In contrast, SirT1 knockdown depleted both itself and SirT6, confirming reports that SirT1 regulates SirT6 (23.Kim H.S. Xiao C. Wang R.H. Lahusen T. Xu X. Vassilopoulos A. Vazquez-Ortiz G. Jeong W.I. Park O. Ki S.H. Gao B. Deng C.X. Hepatic-specific disruption of SIRT6 in mice results in fatty liver formation due to enhanced glycolysis and triglyceride synthesis.Cell Metab. 2010; 12: 224-236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4H). SirT6 depletion significantly increased glucose uptake and glycolysis and further decreased glucose oxidation (Fig. 4, B–D) but did not alter fatty acid uptake or oxidation (Fig. 4, E and F). In contrast, SirT1 knockdown significantly decreased fatty acid uptake and fatty acid oxidation without changing glucose uptake, glycolysis, or glucose oxidation after TLR4 stimulation. Thus, both glucose and fatty acid metabolic changes during the acute TLR4 inflammatory responses depend on NAD+ for sirtuin activation, but SirT6 predominantly opposes the glucose metabolic switch, and SirT1 primarily supports the fatty acid switch. The differentially regulated inflammatory metabolic switch by SirT1 and SirT6 was further supported by immunoflourescence examination of cell surface transporters Glut1 and CD36. Glut1 transporter levels increased in early TLR4 responses and diminished by the 24 h late stage. In contrast, CD36 expression significantly increased by 24 h (Fig. 4G, upper panel). SirT1 knockdown partially blocked the decrease in Glut1 expression but completely attenuated increased CD36 expression (Fig. 4G, center panel). In contrast, SirT6 knockdown limited Glut1 decreases observed at 24 h without affecting CD36 (Fig. 4G, bottom panel). Immunoblot analysis of Glut1 and CD36 expression confirmed the immunoflourescence observations after gene-specific knockdowns (Fig. 4H). HIF-1α is a master regulator of genes controlling glycolysis (24.Weidemann A. Johnson R.S. Biology of HIF-1α.Cell Death. Differ. 2008; 15: 621-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar) and PGC-1 of genes controlling fatty acid oxidation and mitochondrial biogenesis (25.Gleyzer N. Scarpulla R.C.

SirT6 represses the function of HIF-1α by epigenetically silencing chromatin at HIF-1α target gene promoters, thereby balancing glucose metabolism (26.Zhong L. D'Urso A. Toiber D. Sebastian C.

An early map of the HDF at a wavelength of 850 microns that is sensitive to dust emission powered by star formation revealed the brightest source in the field, dubbed HDF850.1. For more than a decade, this source remained elusive and, despite significant efforts, no counterpart at shorter wavelengths, and thus no redshift, size or mass, could be identified. Here we report, using a millimeter wave molecular line scan, an unambiguous redshift determination for HDF850.1 of z=5.183. This places HDF850.1 in a galaxy overdensity at z~5.2 in the HDF, corresponding to a cosmic age of only 1.1 Gyr after the Big Bang. This redshift is significantly higher than earlier estimates and higher than most of the >100 sub-millimeter bright galaxies identified to date. The source has a star formation rate of 850 M_sun/yr and is spatially resolved on scales of 5 kpc, with an implied dynamical mass of ~1.3x10^11 M_sun, a significant fraction of which is present in the form of molecular gas. Despite our accurate redshift and position, a counterpart arising from starlight remains elusive."

Generally, it has been assumed that this relationship is largely driven by the soil community and the quality of the unconsumed plant-matter that makes up the majority of detritus in most ecosystems. However, Hawlena et al. (p. 1434 ) found that grasshoppers exposed to the threat of spider predation have an altered carbon to nitrogen ratio. When these grasshopper carcasses were subsequently integrated into the plant litter, they significantly slowed the decomposition rate, although there was no impact on the rate of decomposition of the grasshoppers themselves. Thus, the mere presence of predators, and the stress they impose, can have cascading trophic impacts and even influence the process of decomposition."
https://openalex.org/W2128848735,"In solids containing elements with f orbitals, the interaction between f-electron spins and those of itinerant electrons leads to the development of low-energy fermionic excitations with a heavy effective mass. These excitations are fundamental to the appearance of unconventional superconductivity and non-Fermi-liquid behaviour observed in actinide- and lanthanide-based compounds. Here we use spectroscopic mapping with the scanning tunnelling microscope to detect the emergence of heavy excitations with lowering of temperature in a prototypical family of cerium-based heavy-fermion compounds. We demonstrate the sensitivity of the tunnelling process to the composite nature of these heavy quasiparticles, which arises from quantum entanglement of itinerant conduction and f electrons. Scattering and interference of the composite quasiparticles is used to resolve their energy-momentum structure and to extract their mass enhancement, which develops with decreasing temperature. The lifetime of the emergent heavy quasiparticles reveals signatures of enhanced scattering and their spectral lineshape shows evidence of energy-temperature scaling. These findings demonstrate that proximity to a quantum critical point results in critical damping of the emergent heavy excitation of our Kondo lattice system."

Their biogenesis is unusual because each peptide is an 18-residue chimera formed by the head-to-tail splicing of nonapeptides derived from two separate precursors. θ-Defensins have multiple arginines and a ladder-like tridisulfide array spanning their two antiparallel β-strands. Human θ-defensin genes contain a premature stop codon that prevents effective translation of the needed precursors; consequently, these peptides are not present in human leukocytes. Synthetic θ-defensins with sequences that correspond to those encoded within the human pseudogenes are called retrocyclins. Retrocyclin-1 inhibits the cellular entry of HIV-1, HSV, and influenza A virus. The rhesus θ-defensin RTD-1 protects mice from an experimental severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection, and retrocyclin-1 protects mice from infection by Bacillus anthracis spores. The small size, unique structure, and multiple host defense activities of θ-defensins make them intriguing potential therapeutic agents."

This occurs through the stress-induced synthesis and release of cyclic adenosine monophosphate by phagocytosed parasites.

https://openalex.org/W2010208325,"In Bengalese finches, a basal ganglia circuit, the anterior forebrain pathway, can covertly acquire the ability to adaptively modify song without contributing to song production during practice or training. Basal ganglia circuits play an important yet unresolved part in the learning of skills on the basis of trial and error — for example, when we learn to speak, and when birds learn and then modify complex song patterns. Previous work has demonstrated how a particular basal ganglia circuit, the anterior forebrain pathway (AFP), contributes to song learning in birds. Here, Charlesworth et al. find that temporarily blocking the output of this circuit prevents behavioural improvement in song production during training. Unexpectedly, removing the block on AFP output after extensive training immediately produced fully trained song output, with the birds making an abrupt transition from naive song production. Thus, these motor basal ganglia circuits seem to monitor the successful motor commands of other brain regions and then direct those regions to implement the learned behaviour without having contributed to song production during practice or training. We learn complex skills such as speech and dance through a gradual process of trial and error. Cortical-basal ganglia circuits have an important yet unresolved function in this trial-and-error skill learning1; influential ‘actor–critic’ models propose that basal ganglia circuits generate a variety of behaviours during training and learn to implement the successful behaviours in their repertoire2,3. Here we show that the anterior forebrain pathway (AFP), a cortical-basal ganglia circuit4, contributes to skill learning even when it does not contribute to such ‘exploratory’ variation in behavioural performance during training. Blocking the output of the AFP while training Bengalese finches to modify their songs prevented the gradual improvement that normally occurs in this complex skill during training. However, unblocking the output of the AFP after training caused an immediate transition from naive performance to excellent performance, indicating that the AFP covertly gained the ability to implement learned skill performance without contributing to skill practice. In contrast, inactivating the output nucleus of the AFP during training completely prevented learning, indicating that learning requires activity within the AFP during training. Our results suggest a revised model of skill learning: basal ganglia circuits can monitor the consequences of behavioural variation produced by other brain regions and then direct those brain regions to implement more successful behaviours. The ability of the AFP to identify successful performances generated by other brain regions indicates that basal ganglia circuits receive a detailed efference copy of premotor activity in those regions. The capacity of the AFP to implement successful performances that were initially produced by other brain regions indicates precise functional connections between basal ganglia circuits and the motor regions that directly control performance."

We found that during in vitro gamma oscillations, ectopic action potentials are generated at high frequency in the distal axon of pyramidal cells (PCs) but do not invade the soma. At the same time, axo-axonic cells (AACs) discharged at a high rate and tonically inhibited the axon initial segment, which can be instrumental in preventing ectopic action potential back-propagation. We found that activation of a single AAC substantially lowered soma invasion by antidromic action potential in postsynaptic PCs. In contrast, activation of soma-inhibiting basket cells had no significant impact. These results demonstrate that AACs can separate axonal from somatic activity and maintain the functional polarization of cortical PCs during network oscillations."
https://openalex.org/W2139315452,"Aging and adiposity are associated with chronic low-grade inflammation, which underlies the development of obesity-associated complications, including type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The mechanisms underlying adipose inflammation may include macrophage infiltration and activation, which, in turn, affect insulin sensitivity of adipocytes. There is a growing appreciation that specific lipid mediators (including lipoxins, resolvins, and protectins) can promote the resolution of inflammation. Here, we investigated the effect of lipoxin A4 (LXA4), the predominant endogenously generated lipoxin, on adipose tissue inflammation. Using adipose tissue explants from perigonadal depots of aging female C57BL/6J mice (Animalia, Chordata, Mus musculus) as a model of age-associated adipose inflammation, we report that LXA4 (1 nM) attenuates adipose inflammation, decreasing IL-6 and increasing IL-10 expression (P<0.05). The altered cytokine milieu correlated with increased GLUT-4 and IRS-1 expression, suggesting improved insulin sensitivity. Further investigations revealed the ability of LXA4 to rescue macrophage-induced desensitization to insulin-stimulated signaling and glucose uptake in cultured adipocytes, using vehicle-stimulated cells as controls. This was associated with preservation of Akt activation and reduced secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α. We therefore propose that LXA4 may represent a potentially useful and novel therapeutic strategy to subvert adipose inflammation and insulin resistance, key components of T2DM.—Börgeson, E., McGillicuddy, F.

https://openalex.org/W2033515821,"The Salmonella virulence gene mgtC is regulated by the levels of ATP through an ATP-sensing leader messenger RNA. Bacterial pathogens produce their virulence determinants only when and where — in the specific tissues — they need them to promote infection. Pathogens typically accomplish this by sensing specific host signals through specialized regulatory systems. The virulence factor MgtC is important for survival of the Salmonella enterica pathogen when the bacterial cells are inside host macrophages. Here, Eun-Jin Lee and Eduardo Groisman show that regulation of the mgtC gene is dependent on ATP through an ATP-sensing leader messenger RNA. Thus, whereas sensing is usually carried out by proteins, in this instance ATP is sensed by the portion of an RNA molecule that precedes the region specifying the regulated virulence protein. The facultative intracellular pathogen Salmonella enterica resides within a membrane-bound compartment inside macrophages1. This compartment must be acidified for Salmonella to survive within macrophages2, possibly because acidic pH promotes expression of Salmonella virulence proteins3,4. We reasoned that Salmonella might sense its surroundings have turned acidic not only upon protonation of the extracytoplasmic domain of a protein sensor5 but also by an increase in cytosolic ATP levels, because conditions that enhance the proton gradient across the bacterial inner membrane stimulate ATP synthesis6,7. Here we report that an increase in cytosolic ATP promotes transcription of the coding region for the virulence gene mgtC, which is the most highly induced horizontally acquired gene when Salmonella is inside macrophages8. This transcript is induced both upon media acidification and by physiological conditions that increase ATP levels independently of acidification. ATP is sensed by the coupling/uncoupling of transcription of the unusually long mgtC leader messenger RNA and translation of a short open reading frame located in this region. A mutation in the mgtC leader messenger RNA that eliminates the response to ATP hinders mgtC expression inside macrophages and attenuates Salmonella virulence in mice. Our results define a singular example of an ATP-sensing leader messenger RNA. Moreover, they indicate that pathogens can interpret extracellular cues by the impact they have on cellular metabolites."

Yet, it is still unclear whether infection by symbionts is determined by environmental factors affecting the early or imago stage of the host. Here, we identified and localized the symbiont Candidatus Cardinium hertigii (Bacteroidetes) in sympatric Culicoides biting midge species, examined its abundance, and studied its association with environmental factors. The prevalence of adult infection differed, with 50.7% from C. imicola, 31.4% from C. oxystoma, and 0% from C. schultzei gp., although phylogenetic analyses showed that Cardinium in these species is almost identical. In addition, prevalence of infection differed between climate regions, with lowest prevalence in the arid region and highest prevalence in the Mediterranean region. Multivariate linear regression analysis of Cardinium prevalence together with climatic and satellite imagery data-derived environmental variables revealed that infection prevalence is significantly associated with land surface temperature and explained up to 89.7% of infection prevalence variability.

https://openalex.org/W2054109770,"Regulated nucleocytoplasmic transport of proteins is central to cellular function and dysfunction during processes such as viral infection. Active protein trafficking into and out of the nucleus is dependent on the presence within cargo proteins of intrinsic specific modular signals for nuclear import (nuclear localization signals, NLSs) and export (nuclear export signals, NESs). Rabies virus (RabV) phospho (P) protein, which is largely responsible for antagonising the host anti-viral response, is expressed as five isoforms (P1-P5). The subcellular trafficking of these isoforms is thought to depend on a balance between the activities of a dominant N-terminal NES (N-NES) and a distinct C-terminal NLS (C-NLS). Specifically, the N-NES-containing isoforms P1 and P2 are cytoplasmic, whereas the shorter P3-P5 isoforms, which lack the N-NES, are believed to be nuclear through the activity of the C-NLS. Here, we show for the first time that RabV P contains an additional strong NLS in the N-terminal region (N-NLS), which, intriguingly, overlaps with the N-NES. This arrangement represents a novel nuclear trafficking module where the N-NLS is inactive in P1 but becomes activated in P3, concomitant with truncation of the N-NES, to become the principal targeting signal conferring nuclear accumulation. Understanding this unique switch arrangement of overlapping, co-regulated NES/NLS sequences is vital to delineating the critical role of RabV P protein in viral infection."

Holo- and apo-forms differ for the conformation of the two loops L1 and L2, which provide the axial ligands of the iron through His(32) and Tyr(75), respectively. In the apo-form, loop L1 protrudes toward the solvent far away from loop L2; in the holoprotein, closing of the loops on the heme occurs upon establishment of the two axial coordination bonds. We have established that the two variants obtained via single point mutations of either axial ligand (namely H32A and Y75A) are both in the closed conformation. The presence of the heme and one out of two axial ligands is sufficient to establish a link between L1 and L2, thanks to the presence of coordinating solvent molecules. The latter are stabilized in the iron coordination environment by H-bond interactions with surrounding protein residues. The presence of such a water molecule in both variants is revealed here through a set of different spectroscopic techniques. Previous studies had shown that heme release and uptake processes occur via intermediate states characterized by a Tyr(75)-iron-bound form with open conformation of loop L1.

This study investigated the involvement of the MT-associated protein stathmin in the mediation of agonist-induced permeability in EC cultures and vascular leak in vivo. Thrombin treatment of human pulmonary ECs induced rapid dephosphorylation and activation of stathmin. Inhibition of stathmin activity by small interfering RNA-based knockdown or cAMP-mediated phosphorylation abrogated thrombin-induced F-actin remodeling and Rho-dependent EC hyperpermeability, while expression of a phosphorylation-deficient stathmin mutant exacerbated thrombininduced EC barrier disruption. Stathmin suppression preserved the MT network against thrombin-induced MT disassembly and release of Rho-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor, GEF-H1. The protective effects of stathmin knockdown were observed in vivo in the mouse 2-hit model of ventilator-induced lung injury and were linked to MT stabilization and down-regulation of Rho signaling in the lung. These results demonstrate the mechanism of stathmin-dependent control of MT dynamics, Rho signaling, and permeability and suggest novel potential pharmacological interventions in the prevention of increased vascular leak via modulation of stathmin activity.—Tian, X., Tian, Y., Sarich, N., Wu, T., Birukova, A.

https://openalex.org/W2139216570,"Black-pearl (Blp) is a highly conserved, essential inner-mitochondrial membrane protein. The yeast Blp homologue, Magmas/Pam16, is required for mitochondrial protein transport, growth, and survival. Our purpose was to determine the role of Drosophila Blp in mitochondrial function, cell survival, and proliferation. To this end, we performed mitotic recombination in Drosophila melanogaster, RNAi-mediated knockdown, MitoTracker staining, measurement of reactive oxygen species (ROS), flow cytometry, electron transport chain complex assays, and hemocyte isolation from Drosophila larvae. Proliferation-defective, Blp-deficient Drosophila Schneider cells exhibited mitochondrial membrane depolarization, a 60% decrease in ATP levels, increased amounts of ROS (3.5-fold), cell cycle arrest, and activation of autophagy that were associated with a selective 65% reduction of cytochrome c oxidase activity. N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) rescued Blp-RNAi-treated cells from cell cycle arrest, indicating that increased production of ROS is the primary cause of the proliferation and survival defects in Blp-depleted cells. blp hypomorph larvae had a 35% decreased number of plasmatocytes with a 45% reduced active mitochondrial staining and their viability was increased 2-fold by administration of NAC, which blocked melanotic lesions. Loss of Blp decreases cytochrome c oxidase activity and uncouples oxidative phosphorylation, causing ROS production, which selectively affects mitochondria-rich plasmatocyte survival and function, leading to melanotic lesions in Blp-deficient flies.—Roy, S., Short, M.

https://openalex.org/W1989833729,"Preserving and controlling the quantum information content of spins is a central challenge of spintronics. In solids, the relativistic spin-orbit interaction (SOI) leads to a finite spin lifetime. Here, we show that spin information is preserved by the hidden conserved ""twisted spin"" and survives elastic disorder scatterings. This twisted spin is an adiabatic invariant with respect to a slow change in the SOI. We predict an echo phenomenon, spin-orbit echo, which indicates the recovery of the spin moment when the SOI is tuned off adiabatically, even after spin relaxation has occurred; this is confirmed by numerical simulations. A concrete experiment in two-dimensional semiconductor quantum wells with Rashba-Dresselhaus SOI is proposed to verify our prediction."
https://openalex.org/W2118249740,"We have previously shown that estrogen receptor β (ERβ)-mediated up-regulation of quinone reductase (QR) is involved in the protection against estrogen-induced mammary tumorigenesis. Our present study provides evidence that the ERβ agonist, 2,3-bis-(4-hydroxy-phenyl)-propionitrile (DPN), and the selective estrogen receptor modulator tamoxifen (Tam), inhibit estrogen-induced DNA damage and mammary tumorigenesis in the aromatase transgenic (Arom) mouse model. We also show that either DPN or Tam treatment increases QR levels and results in a decrease in ductal hyperplasia, proliferation, oxidative DNA damage (ODD), and an increase in apoptosis. To corroborate the role of QR, we provide additional evidence in triple transgenic MMTV/QR/Arom mice, wherein the QR expression is induced in the mammary glands via doxycycline, causing a decrease in ductal hyperplasia and ODD. Overall, we provide evidence that up-regulation of QR through induction by Tam or DPN can inhibit estrogen-induced ODD and mammary cell tumorigenesis, representing a novel mechanism of prevention against breast cancer. Thus, our data have important clinical implications in the management of breast cancer; our findings bring forth potentially new therapeutic strategies involving ERβ agonists."
https://openalex.org/W2126954365,"Twenty years after the Earth summit, we continue to face tremendous challenges to ecological, human, and national security. Development is the frontline defense, but traditional approaches are no longer sufficient. Development interventions have been dominated by a handful of bilateral and multilateral institutions that defined the problems and implemented a narrow set of solutions. Although there have been tremendous successes, this has not been enough to reverse the continued degradation of our environment or to overcome entrenched problems. To turn grand challenges into grander opportunities, we must harness the entire planet's creativity to contribute novel solutions.

The USAID and its partners have crowd-sourced the world to apply science, technology, and innovation against seemingly intractable barriers to solving the Grand Challenges for Development (GCDs) and to catalyze global action to achieve scale, sustainability, and impact. Between 25 and 50% of the proposed solutions to the first two GCDs (Saving Lives at Birth and All Children Reading) have come from developing countries. A new partnership between USAID and the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF), Partnerships for Enhanced Engagement in Research, generated 488 proposals from 63 of the 79 eligible countries with a USAID presence to partner developing-country scientists with NSF-funded American scientists on shared global development problems. These programs, and others like Open-Source Drug Discovery, recognize that developing countries are sources of solutions and ideas as much as developed countries. Constraints of low-resource settings allow for creation of efficacious world-class products that can cost less and have a smaller environmental impact.

Democratization of science and technology, increases in global connectivity, and greater availability of data will facilitate a movement from a handful of traditional global development agencies toward 7 billion development agents. Cell phones, for example, have been tools of transformation that moved societies beyond traditional infrastructure barriers, serving as platforms for services and learning, providing remote diagnostics for medical treatment, identifying centers of corruption, and serving as distributed sensors of communities and their ecosystems. Our planet's future, driven largely by developing countries, will depend on whether we can work collaboratively to leapfrog 200 years of industrialization and to harness the power of science and technology to create a new revolution based on knowledge.

https://openalex.org/W2062398572,"Scientific and technological advances, combined with an internationally coordinated effort to help the diffusion of those technologies to poor countries, have had important impacts on the quality of life for millions of poor people. For example, antibiotics and vaccinations have dramatically increased life expectancy. New seeds have promoted a “green revolution,” making several Asian countries self-sufficient for their food needs. Some current development challenges undoubtedly would benefit from new technologies. The world still needs vaccines for malaria and HIV, as well as crops better suited to Africa.

The contribution of science to development and poverty alleviation, however, should not be limited to facilitating the development of new products. For there are numerous technologies that are known to be effective but have not been widely adopted, from bed nets to chlorine to iron pills. And others have yet to prove their effectiveness in the real world, despite their promise in the lab, such as cheap laptop computers in schools. The missing part is often recognizing human behaviors that are barriers to adoption or correct use and designing appropriate policies to address them. A recent experiment on improved cookstoves, for example, showed that the stoves were not properly used or maintained. This was sufficient to override the encouraging effects of stoves on health that were found in more controlled conditions.

In the last 15 years, social scientists have adopted the method of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), one of the key tools of scientific practice, to evaluate development policy. RCTs allow researchers and policy-makers to rigorously evaluate the impact of an intervention. Once very rare in social science, they are now widely used: Hundreds of RCTs are currently being run to evaluate the impact of policies ranging from police reform to the health impacts of fortified foods. Beyond the obvious value of finding out what works and what does not, RCTs can also shed light on the reasons for individuals' behavior, by incorporating insights from economics, psychology, and sociology into the design and analysis of experiments. This makes for good science; these experiments make it possible to test scientific hypotheses with a degree of rigor that was not available before. It is also essential to the design of policies that take our human nature into account. This is the new frontier for the collaboration between science and development policy.

https://openalex.org/W2105638812,"“The Urban Challenge” was a chapter in the 1987 Brundtland report, Our Common Future . The issues remain depressingly familiar for Rio+20. Urbanization has continued around the world, sometimes diminishing rather than enhancing social and environmental capital. Urban populations then 2 billion are estimated to have reached 3.5 billion. But three unforeseen new factors have changed the world's urban landscape since the 1980s: globalization of transportation, information technology, and clean energy. Globalization could only have taken place with adaption of cities (and their ports) on a scale without precedence. Driving that change have been leaps in logistics and transport technology. Modern cities have become inseparable from the means with which they link to each other. The scale of production and consumption in modern cities is awesome, not least for the problems created in waste and pollution. At the heart of these issues is continued availability of clean energy that is affordable for all and less dependent on fossil fuel. The race is on to reconfigure urban processes and land-use patterns to extract the most from waste streams of matter and energy and to minimize the resource overhead of transport.

Finding optimal solutions for the complexity of the growing modern city is beyond the reach of conventional pencil-and-paper city master planning. Cities are turning to increasingly sophisticated software decision-support tools both to minimize internal transportation needs and to optimize the locational opportunity to recover high-grade waste energy and material flows to lower-grade uses. At the moment, even the powerful optimizers used in process industries are hard pressed to tackle the formidable “integer programming” problem presented by the myriad of possible networks of resource flows of a modern city.

Nevertheless, the prospect is a possible halving of primary resource use, and it will have to be achieved. One study of global data for cities sounds the warning; as urban population grows, major innovation cycles have had to be generated at a continually accelerating rate to sustain growth and so avoid stagnation or collapse. The urban citizen is running with no time to take breath.
