https://openalex.org/W1679618228,"Nearly all experiments on the incorporation of labeled amino acids into tissue proteins in vitro have been done on tissues whose cell structure has been partially or completely disintegrated, e.g. tissue slices, segments, or homogenates. Since cell destruction reduces or abolishes the uptake of labeled amino acids (1), it seemed worth while to carry out studies on intact cells in vitro. Bone marrow cells were found to be suitable for this purpose. The labeled amino acids used were glycine-1-C14, L-leucine-1-C14, L-lysine-1-C14, and L-lysine-6-C14."
https://openalex.org/W1574535864,"We have reported the incorporation of labeled amino acids into the proteins of rabbit bone marrow cells in vitro (1), a study that was undertaken to compare the process in intact cells as compared with tissue slices and homogenates. Bone marrow cells are a mixture in different stages of maturity. The uptake of labeled amino acids by rat diaphragm was studied because it is an adult tissue with predominantly one type of cell and it can be removed from the animal with little damage. This preparation has been found useful in studies of carbohydrate metabolism of muscle in vitro (2)."

https://openalex.org/W2022161764,"THE isolation1 of stable optical forms of the tris 2 : 2′ dipyridyl osmium II ion, Os(dipy)3++, and of the tris 2 : 2′ dipyridyl osmium III ion2, Os(dipy)3+++, permits a unique demonstration of the dynamic electronic equilibrium between the oxidized and reduced forms of an ion. It is evident that when the dextro form of the osmium II complex ion is mixed with an equivalent amount of the lævo form of the osmium III complex ion, the optical activity of both ions should vanish if such an equilibrium exists."

https://openalex.org/W2021947984,"CRYSTALS of pure dimethyltriacetylene1, H3CC≡CC≡CC≡CCH3, sealed in a Lindemann glass tube, are sufficiently stable at room temperature for detailed X-ray analysis. The crystal structure has the space-group R3̄m with one molecule in the rhombohedral unit cell. The centro-symmetrical molecule lies with its eight carbon atatoms extended along the triad axis, and four parameters suffice to define their positions completely. These parameters have been determined by a Fourier synthesis of the (h0h̄ l) structure factors; the atomic centres were located by the differential method with application of termination-of-series corrections2. The standard deviation of the bond-lengths is at present estimated to be 0.015 A., and it is hoped that further work now in progress may increase the accuracy of the analysis. The bond-lengths obtained are compared with those from related molecules in the accompanying table."

https://openalex.org/W2078865829,"As part of a survey of the chemical constituents of the Australian flora, we have examined the alkaloids of Strychnos psilosperma F. Muell. Leaves collected at Dalmar, near Rockhampton, contained approximately 1 per cent total alkaloid from which a new alkaloid, now named ‘strychnospermine’, was readily isolated. It formed colourless needles of melting point 209°, had [α]D + 58° (c = 2.07 per cent in chloroform), and analyses of it, its bromo-derivative (m.p. 245°), its hydrochloride (m.p. 330–332° with decomp.) and its picrate (m.p. 254° with decomp.) indicated the formula C21H28O3N2. Tests for a methylene-dioxy group were negative, but one methoxyl and one methylimino group were present. When a small crystal of potassium dichromate was added to its solution in cold concentrated sulphuric acid, an intense permanganate colour was immediately produced. Treatment of the alkaloid with methyl iodide at room temperature readily gave a methiodide (m.p. 335° with decomp.), showing the presence of a tertiary nitrogen atom. Strychnospermine could not be hydrogenated in acetic acid solution in the presence of palladium charcoal. Hydrolysis with acid or alkali yielded deacetyl-strychnospermine (m.p. 222°), which was smoothly reconverted to the parent alkaloid by acetic anhydride. The deacetyl derivative gave with nitrous acid a pale yellow crystalline nitroso compound (m.p. c. 195° with decomp.). The remaining oxygen atom is inert and is presumably in an ether linkage."

The lines were photographed with a Steinheil GH three-prism spectrograph specially fitted for Raman work (collimator, f = 195 mm.; camera, f = 255 mm.). The lines were excited by the mercury line 4358 A. by means of a Heræus No. S700 lamp."
