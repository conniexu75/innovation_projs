https://openalex.org/W2895374072,"Background The results from cross sectional and longitudinal studies show that periodontitis is closely associated with cognitive impairment (CI) and Alzhemer’s Disease (AD). Further, studies using animal model of periodontitis and human post-mortem brain tissues from subjects with AD strongly suggest that a gram-negative periodontal pathogen, Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) and/or its product gingipain is/are translocated to the brain. However, neuropathology resulting from Pg oral application is not known. In this work, we tested the hypothesis that repeated exposure of wild type C57BL/6 mice to orally administered Pg results in neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration, microgliosis, astrogliosis and formation of intra- and extracellular amyloid plaque and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) which are pathognomonic signs of AD. Methods Experimental chronic periodontitis was induced in ten wild type 8-week old C57BL/6 WT mice by repeated oral application (MWF/week) of Pg/gingipain for 22 weeks (experimental group). Another 10 wild type 8-week old C57BL/6 mice received vehicle alone (control group) MWF per week for 22 weeks. Brain tissues were collected and the presence of Pg/gingipain was determined by immunofluorescence (IF) microscopy, confocal microscopy, and quantitative PCR (qPCR). The hippocampi were examined for the signs of neuropathology related to AD: TNFα, IL1β, and IL6 expression (neuroinflammation), NeuN and Fluoro Jade C staining (neurodegeneration) and amyloid beta1-42 (Aβ42) production and phosphorylation of tau protein at Ser396 were assessed by IF and confocal microscopy. Further, gene expression of amyloid precursor protein (APP), beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein10 (ADAM10) for α-secretase and presenilin1 (PSEN1) for ɣ-secretase, and NeuN (rbFox3) were determined by RT-qPCR. Microgliosis and astrogliosis were also determined by IF microscopy. Results Pg/gingipain was detected in the hippocampi of mice in the experimental group by immunohistochemistry, confocal microscopy, and qPCR confirming the translocation of orally applied Pg to the brain. Pg/gingipain was localized intra-nuclearly and peri-nuclearly in microglia (Iba1+), astrocytes (GFAP+), neurons (NeuN+) and was evident extracellularly. Significantly greater levels of expression of IL6, TNFα and IL1β were evident in experimental as compared to control group (p<0.01, p<0.00001, p<0.00001 respectively). In addition, microgliosis and astrogliosis were evident in the experimental but not in control group (p <0.01, p<0.0001 respectively). Neurodegeneration was evident in the experimental group based on a fewer number of intact neuronal cells assessed by NeuN positivity and rbFOX3 gene expression, and there was a greater number of degenerating neurons in the hippocampi of experimental mice assessed by Fluoro Jade C positivity. APP and BACE1 gene expression were increased in experimental group compared with control group (p<0.05, p<0.001 respectively). PSEN1 gene expression was higher in experimental than control group but the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.07). ADAM10 gene expression was significantly decreased in experimental group compared with control group (p<0.01). Extracellular Aβ42 was detected in the parenchyma in the experimental but not in the control group (p< 0.00001). Finally, phospho-Tau (Ser396) protein was detected and NFTs were evident in experimental but not in the control group (p<0.00001). Conclusions This study is the first to show neurodegeneration and the formation of extracellular Aβ42 in young adult WT mice after repeated oral application of Pg. The neuropathological features observed in this study strongly suggest that low grade chronic periodontal pathogen infection can result in the development of neuropathology that is consistent with that of AD."
https://openalex.org/W2895431565,"Research suggests that poverty is a key driver of intimate partner violence (IPV), however detailed analysis suggests that this relationship is not clear, either for women's experience or men's perpetration of IPV. We explored associations between poverty and IPV using cross-sectional data from the Stepping Stones and Creating Futures cluster randomized control trial, in urban informal settlements in Durban, South Africa, with young (18-30) people. Using logistic regression and structural equation modelling we assess associations between poverty and women's experience and men's perpetration of physical and/or sexual IPV in the past 12 months. 680 women and 677 men were recruited into the study between September 2015 and September 2016. The analyses highlight how specific forms or measures of poverty intersecting with gender identities shape IPV. For men we found indicators of economic provision were associated with IPV perpetration, while for women food-insecurity was key to IPV experience. We also found similarities between women and men. First, food-insecurity and childhood traumas shaped pathways to substance misuse and poor mental health that increased IPV. Second, there was a resilience pathway in both models, whereby those with more education had increased gender equitable attitudes and fewer controlling behaviours, which reduced IPV. Interventions to reduce IPV need to work to reduce household food insecurity, but these need to be combined with gender transformative interventions. Interventions should also focus on reducing the impact of mental health and substance misuse. Finally, working to increase educational attainment is a long-term critical intervention to reduce IPV.NCT03022370. Registered 13 January 2017, retrospectively registered."
https://openalex.org/W2894671827,"Traumatic events increase the risk of depression, but there is also evidence that adversity can lead to posttraumatic growth, including increased compassion and prosocial behavior. To date there is no empirical research pinpointing childhood trauma to an increase in trait empathy in adulthood. Although somewhat counter-intuitive, this might be predicted if trauma not only increases fear of future threat but also renders the individual more sensitive to suffering in others. We explored this possible link using multiple studies, self-report measures, and non-clinical samples. Results across samples and measures showed that, on average, adults who reported experiencing a traumatic event in childhood had elevated empathy levels compared to adults who did not experience a traumatic event. Further, the severity of the trauma correlated positively with various components of empathy. These findings suggest that the experience of a childhood trauma increases a person's ability to take the perspective of another and to understand their mental and emotional states, and that this impact is long-standing. Future research needs to test if this is seen on performance measures, and how these findings extend to clinical populations."
https://openalex.org/W2894726618,"Primary and secondary metabolites exuded by plant roots have mainly been studied under laboratory conditions, while knowledge of root exudate patterns of plants growing in natural communities is very limited. Focusing on ten common European grassland plant species, we asked to which degree exuded metabolite compositions are specific to species or growth forms (forbs and grasses), depend on environments and local neighbourhoods, and reflect traditional plant functional traits. Root exudates were collected under field conditions and analysed using a non-targeted gas chromatography coupled mass spectrometry (GC-MS) approach. In total, we annotated 153 compounds of which 36 were identified by structure and name as metabolites mainly derived from the primary metabolism. Here we show by using variance partitioning, that the composition of exuded polar metabolites was mostly explained by plot identity, followed by plant species identity while plant species composition of the local neighbourhood played no role. Total and root dry biomass explained the largest proportion of variance in exudate composition, with additional variance explained by traditional plant traits. Although the exudate composition was quite similar between the two growth forms, we found some metabolites that occurred only in one of the two growth forms. Our study demonstrated the feasibility of measuring polar exudates under non-sterile field conditions by mass spectrometry, which opens new avenues of research for functional plant ecology."
https://openalex.org/W2894957089,"Attack by herbivores is a major biotic stress limiting the soybean crop production. Plant defenses against caterpillars include the production of secondary metabolites such as flavonoids, which constitute a diverse group of plant secondary metabolites. Thus, a more discriminate metabolic profiling between genotypes are important for a more comprehensive and reliable characterization of soybean resistance. Therefore, in this study a non-targeted LC/MS-based for analysis of flavonoid profiles of soybean genotypes contrasting to the resistance to A. gemmatalis was applied. Clustering analysis revealed profiles highly distinct between the susceptible UFV 105 AP and the resistant IAC 17 genotypes. This comparative approach enables to identify directly from leaf extract some new compounds related to resistance, some of which were present in higher abundance specifically in the IAC 17 genotype: four Quercetin conjugates, Rutin (Quercetin 3-O-Rutinoside), Quercetin-3,7-O- di-glucoside, Quercetin-3-O-rhamnosylglycoside-7-O-glucoside and Quercetin-3-O-rhamnopyranosyl-glucopyranoside-rhamnopyranoside; two Genistein conjugates, Genistein-7-O-diglucoside-dimalonylated and Genistein-7-O-6-O-malonylglucoside; and one Daidzein conjugate, Daidzein-7-O-Glucoside-malonate. The most abundant flavonoid glycoconjugates in soybean leaves belongs to Quercetin and Kaempferol classes. However, only one from the identified compounds was classified as a Kaempferol. The Kaempferol-3-O-L-rhamnopyranosyl-glucopyranoside showed high abundance in the resistant genotype IAC 17. The metabolic profiles generated by LC/MS allowed the reconstruction of the flavonoid biosynthetic pathways, which revealed a constitutive character for herbivory resistance in the resistant genotype IAC-17 and a metabolic regulation for the rechanneling of Quercetin, Kaempferol and Genistein conjugates in soybean. Highest relative abundances were detected for glyconjugates, such as Rutin, Quercetin 3-O-rhamnosylglycoside-7-O-glucoside and Quercitin-3-O-rhamnopyranosyl-glucopyranoside-rhamnopyranoside in the leaves of the resistant genotype."
https://openalex.org/W2895156856,"Objective We conducted a cross-sectional survey in France in a cohort over 55 years of age to characterize the impact of psychological dimensions on quality-of-life (QoL). Methods The predictors of QoL in relation with aging were studied using an adapted quality-of-life model, based on emotional, cognitive and physical symptoms, functional status, and general health perception. Adding psychological dimensions such as self-esteem, psychological distress, perceptions of ageing and coping, was hypothesized to improve the QoL model. Responses were analyzed using structural equation modeling and path analysis. Results The study involved 258 participants, mean age 66.9±7.9 years. Psychological distress and positive perception of aging exhibited the strongest direct impact on QoL (p<0.0001). Psychological distress also appeared to be mediator on QoL for perceived health status, self-esteem and negative perception of aging. Coping centred on emotion exhibited direct impact on self-esteem and so, indirect impact on QoL (p = 0.0002). Perception of personal financial situation (p = 0.0007) and coping centred on social support (p = 0.02) appeared as direct mediators influencing QoL. Conclusions Psychological dimensions are predictors of QOL and have to be taken into account to maximize the resources with a view to successful aging. Further interventions targeting successful aging should focus on positive perception aging."
https://openalex.org/W2895677790,"Rheumatoid arthritis and periodontitis are chronic inflammatory diseases which has been closely associated due to the nature of immune-inflammatory imbalance response. Resveratrol is a naturall product with biological proprieties that may promote immunomodulatory effects on host response. This study investigated resveratrol continuous administration effect on experimental periodontitis and arthritis progression in rats. Thirty-five rats were assigned to the following groups: 1—experimental arthritis + experimental periodontitis + placebo (RA+EP +PL) (n = 12); 2 –RA+EP+ ibuprofen (RA+PE+IB) (n = 11); 3—RA+EP+ resveratrol (RA+PE+RSV) (n = 11). After euthanasia, the specimens were processed for morphometric analysis of bone loss, and the gingival tissue surrounding the first molar was collected for quantification of inflammatory markers using a Luminex/MAGpix assay and anti-citrullinated protein antibody (ACCPA) levels were measured by ELISA assay. Serum level of rheumatoid factor (RF) was measured by ELISA assay. Paw edema was analyzed using a plethysmometer. Higher bone loss was observed in PL group, when compared to IB and RSV groups. RSV group presented higher IL-4 concentration than PL and IB groups. Resveratrol reduced RF serum levels and both IB and RSV decreased ACCPA gingival levels. Besides, paw swelling level was significantly lower in IB and RSV groups in the 21th day and only in RSV group in the 28th day. Histological analyzes showed smooth articular surface and higher width of the subchondral cortical in RSV group. Resveratrol showed modulatory effect and seems to reduce the inflammatory signs of arthritis and articular damage throughout the time."
https://openalex.org/W2894653369,"Arboviruses are a major public health problem worldwide and are predominantly present in intertropical areas. Chikungunya, dengue and zika viruses have been implicated in recent epidemics in Asia, America and Africa. In Cameroon, data on these viruses are fragmentary. The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency of detection of these three viruses in febrile patients in Douala, Cameroon. A cross-sectional and descriptive study was conducted from March to April 2017 at the New-Bell District Hospital in Douala. Blood samples were collected from febrile patients and tested for malaria infections using Rapid Diagnostic test. Plasma harvested was later analyzed for the presence of chikungunya, dengue and zika viruses by a Trioplex real-time RT-PCR at Centre Pasteur of Cameroon. A total of 114 participants were included, of which 63.2% were females, reflecting a sex ratio (female/male) of 1.7. The median age was 26 years, range [0.25–81]. Eight (7%) of the 114 participants were infected with Dengue virus (DENV) among which 5 were identified as serotype 1. No cases of infection by either Zika virus or Chikungunya virus were detected. Three cases of dengue-malaria co-infection (13%) were recorded. No association was found between socio-demographic factors and dengue infection. The phylogenetic analysis of the partial envelope E gene showed that all the five DENV serotype 1 samples belonged to subtype V, similarly to strains from West African countries, particularly those from Nigeria, Senegal and Côte d’Ivoire. This study showed the circulation of DENV serotype 1 in febrile patients and raises the alarm for the establishment of a sustained surveillance system to detect cases and prevent potential outbreaks in Cameroon. The existence of dengue-malaria co-infections suggests that surveillance of arboviruses should not be limited to febrile, non-malarial cases."
https://openalex.org/W2894746672,"Objectives To investigate childhood obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) and its role in daytime sleepiness among school-age children. Methods A questionnaire survey was conducted with 25,211 children aged 6–15 (mean, 10.39) years attending 148 elementary and 71 middle schools in 10 prefectures across Japan and their parents. Questions concerned 4 sleep habit items (bedtime, sleep onset latency, wake time after sleep onset, wake-up time) and 4 sleep disorder items (loud snoring, snorts/gasps, breathing pauses, seems very sleepy in the daytime). Total sleep time (TST) was calculated with sleep habits. Severe possible OSAS (p-OSAS) was defined as having loud snoring, snorts and gasps, or breathing pauses “frequently” (≥ 5 times per week), and mild p-OSAS was rated as having any of these “sometimes” (2–4 times per week). Severe daytime sleepiness was defined as seeming very sleepy “frequently” and mild daytime sleepiness as seeming very sleepy “sometimes”. Results Mean prevalence of mild to severe p-OSAS and severe p-OSAS in children across all grade levels was 9.5% and 1.6%, respectively. p-OSAS was particularly prevalent in children at lower elementary levels, decreasing with advancing grade levels. Prevalence of mild and severe daytime sleepiness was 6.1% and 0.9%, respectively, among all children (7.0%). Prevalence of daytime sleepiness increased with advancing grade levels, particularly in middle-school level. Average TST was 8.4 ± 2.2 h in both elementary and middle-school levels, and decreased as grades advanced, particularly in middle-school levels. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that middle-school level, TST < 8 h, and p-OSAS were independent factors for daytime sleepiness. Strong correlations were found between severe daytime sleepiness and severe p-OSAS or TST < 6 h, and between daytime sleepiness and loud snoring or breathing pauses. Conclusion p-OSAS may be an independent factor influencing daytime sleepiness in school-age children. Loud snoring and breathing pauses could be clinical markers for children with severe daytime sleepiness."
https://openalex.org/W2895764260,"The innate immune system is important for the efficacy of vaccines, but excessive innate immune responses can cause adverse reactions after vaccination. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are enriched in the blood and can deliver functional RNAs, such as microRNAs (miRNAs), to recipient cells, thereby mediating intercellular communication. However, the role of EVs in controlling the innate immune responses to vaccines has not been fully elucidated. Here, we found that miR-451a is abundant in human serum EVs and that its presence in blood-circulating EVs affects the innate immune responses of macrophages and dendritic cells to inactivated whole-virus vaccines (WV) against influenza. miR-451a in human serum EVs was stable for a week in healthy subjects, and its levels gradually fluctuated over several months. miR-451a within serum EVs was internalized into serum-cultured macrophages and dendritic cells and reduced endogenous 14-3-3ζ protein levels and decreased the expression of type I IFN and interleukin 6 in response to WV stimulation. miR-451a levels in blood-circulating EVs were positively correlated with intracellular miR-451a levels in mouse splenic CD11c+ cells and inversely correlated with the innate immune response to inactivated WV in vivo. These findings suggest that miR-451a in circulating EVs is internalized into recipient cells in vivo and that this internalization results in an attenuation of the innate immune response to WV. Moreover, a microarray analysis identified several other miRNAs that affect the macrophage response to inactivated WV. Our results reveal that miRNAs in circulating EVs significantly modify the responses of macrophages and dendritic cells to inactivated WV.

https://openalex.org/W2895104681,"Collagen is the main structural element of connective tissues, and its favorable properties make it an ideal biomaterial for regenerative medicine. In dental medicine, collagen barrier membranes fabricated from naturally occurring tissues are used for guided bone regeneration. Since the morphological characteristics of collagen membranes play a crucial role in their mechanical properties and affect the cellular behavior at the defect site, in-depth knowledge of the structure is key. As a base for the development of novel collagen membranes, an extensive morphological analysis of four porcine membranes, including centrum tendineum, pericardium, plica venae cavae and small intestinal submucosa, was performed. Native membranes were analyzed in terms of their thickness. Second harmonic generation and two-photon excitation microscopy of the native membranes showed the 3D architecture of the collagen and elastic fibers, as well as a volumetric index of these two membrane components. The surface morphology, fiber arrangement, collagen fibril diameter and D-periodicity of decellularized membranes were investigated by scanning electron microscopy. All the membrane types showed significant differences in thickness. In general, undulating collagen fibers were arranged in stacked layers, which were parallel to the membrane surface. Multiphoton microscopy revealed a conspicuous superficial elastic fiber network, while the elastin content in deeper layers varied. The elastin/collagen volumetric index was very similar in the investigated membranes and indicated that the collagen content was clearly higher than the elastin content. The surface of both the pericardium and plica venae cavae and the cranial surface of the centrum tendineum revealed a smooth, tightly arranged and crumpled morphology. On the caudal face of the centrum tendineum, a compact collagen arrangement was interrupted by clusters of circular discontinuities. In contrast, both surfaces of the small intestinal submucosa were fibrous, fuzzy and irregular. All the membranes consisted of largely uniform fibrils displaying the characteristic D-banding. This study reveals similarities and relevant differences among the investigated porcine membranes, suggesting that each membrane represents a unique biomaterial suitable for specific applications."
https://openalex.org/W2895132838,"Hypertension causes vascular complications, such as stroke, cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The relationship between endothelial dysfunction and progression of kidney disease is well known. However, the relationship between the eNOS-NO pathway and chronic inflammation, which is a common pathway for the progression of kidney disease, remains unexplored. We performed in vivo experiments to determine the role of the eNOS-NO pathway by using eNOS-deficient mice in a hypertensive kidney disease model. All mice were unilateral nephrectomized (Nx). One week after Nx, the mice were randomly divided into two groups: the aldosterone infusion groups and the vehicle groups. All mice also received a 1% NaCl solution instead of drinking water. The aldosterone infusion groups were treated with hydralazine to correct blood pressure differences. After four weeks of drug administration, all mice were euthanized, and blood and kidney tissue samples were collected. In the results, NLRP3 inflammasome activation was elevated in the kidneys of the eNOS-deficient mice, and tubulointerstitial fibrosis was accelerated. Suppression of inflammasome activation by knocking out ASC prevented tubulointerstitial injury in the eNOS knockout mice, indicating that the eNOS-NO pathway is involved in the development of kidney dysfunction through acceleration of NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages. We revealed that endothelial function, particularly the eNOS-NO pathway, attenuates the progression of renal tubulointerstitial injury via suppression of inflammasome activation. Clinically, patients who develop vascular endothelial dysfunction have lifestyle diseases, such as hypertension or diabetes, and are known to be at risk for CKD. Our study suggests that the eNOS-NO pathway could be a therapeutic target for the treatment of chronic kidney disease associated with endothelial dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W2895082412,"Malaria is a major infectious disease that still affects nearly half of the world’s population. Information on spatial distribution of malaria vector species is needed to improve malaria control efforts. In this study we used Maximum Entropy Model (MaxEnt) to estimate the potential distribution of Anopheles gambiae sensu lato and its siblings: Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto, and Anopheles arabiensis in Nigeria. Species occurrence data collected during the period 1900–2010 was used together with 19 bioclimatic, landuse and terrain variables. Results show that these species are currently widespread across all ecological zones. Temperature fluctuation from mean diurnal temperature range, extreme temperature and precipitation conditions, high humidity in dry season from precipitation during warm months, and land use and land cover dynamics have the greatest influence on the current seasonal distribution of the Anopheles species. MaxEnt performed statistically significantly better than random with AUC approximately 0.7 for estimation of the Anopheles species environmental suitability, distribution and variable importance. This model result can contribute to surveillance efforts and control strategies for malaria eradication."

Various antioxidants reduce oxidative stress, but these agents have little efficacy due to poor blood–brain barrier (BBB) permeability.

Mini-GAGR, a 0.7-kDa cleavage product of low-acyl gellan gum, increased the levels and activities of Nrf2-dependent antioxidant enzymes, decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) under oxidative stress in mouse cortical neurons, and robustly protected mitochondria from oxidative insults. Moreover, mini-GAGR increased the nuclear localization and transcriptional activity of Nrf2 similarly to known Nrf2 activators. Mechanistically, mini-GAGR increased the dissociation of Nrf2 from its inhibitor, Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1), and induced phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of Nrf2 in a protein kinase C (PKC)- and fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR1)-dependent manner.

https://openalex.org/W2978532343,"This study applied the non-parametric four-stage data envelopment analysis method (Four-Stage DEA) to measure the relative efficiencies of Chinese public hospitals from 2010 to 2016, and to determine how efficiencies were affected by eight factors. A sample of public hospitals (n = 84) was selected from Chongqing, China, including general hospitals and traditional Chinese medicine hospitals graded level 2 or above. The Four-Stage-DEA method was chosen since it enables the control of the impact of environment factors on efficiency evaluation results. Data on the number of staff, government financial subsidies, the number of beds and fixed assets were used as input whereas the number of out-patients and emergency department patients and visits, the number of discharged patients, medical and health service income and hospital bed utilization rate were chosen as study outputs. As relevant environmental variables, we selected GDP per capita, permanent population, population density, number of hospitals and number of available sickbeds in local medical institutions. The relative efficiencies (i.e. technical, pure technical, scale) of sample hospitals were also calculated to analyze the change between the first stage and fourth stage every year. The study found that Four-Stage-DEA can effectively filter the impact of environmental factors on evaluation results, which sets it apart from other models commonly used in existing studies."
https://openalex.org/W2894668894,"This study investigates possible variation in post-mortem histories during the Neolithic period in southwestern Sweden based on microscopic studies of human bone. Numerous megalithic graves were built in this region and good preservation conditions have left a rich skeletal record. After more than a hundred years of research, it is still a controversy whether or not these skeletal assemblages were the result of primary burials, or ossuaries where skeletonized remains were deposited. In this study we apply histological analysis to obtain insights into post-mortem histories and taphonomic processes affecting the human remains, potentially including funerary rituals. This type of analysis records the condition and traces of degradation found in skeletal material at a microscopic level. Human skeletal material from four different megalithic tombs in the Falbygden area has been sampled and analysed by thin-section light microscopy, and by scanning electron microscopy. The results of the study provide evidence of variation and changes in burial conditions for skeletal remains from the different graves, also for remains from the same grave. Extent of bioerosion varied, from extensive to moderate/arrested, to none. Bone samples from the same graves also differed in the type of staining and mineral inclusions, showing that the non-bioeroded samples relatively early post-mortem must have experienced an anoxic environment, and later a change to an aerated environment. This could be taken as an indication of primary burial somewhere else, but more likely reflect a special micro-environment occurring temporarily in some graves and parts of graves after the tombs were filled with soil and sealed by roof slabs. The study illustrates the usefulness of bone histological analysis in the reconstruction of post-mortem histories, revealing variations not discernible at macro-level that may aid in the interpretations of funerary rituals. However, the results also highlight the issues of equifinality. Based on current data and knowledge, several scenarios are possible. Further histotaphonomic work is advisable, including archaeological remains from megalithic tombs, and bones from taphonomic experiments."
https://openalex.org/W2894842027,"Background Hypertension is a globally recognized threat to social and economic development with premature morbidity and mortality. In middle and low-income countries hypertension appears to be increasing. However, sufficient data on this silent-killer is not available in Ethiopia. Therefore, this study examined the magnitude and risk factors for hypertension among public servants in Tigray, Ethiopia. Methods We used a cross-sectional survey from May-June 2016 among 1525 public servants in Tigray region. Field workers collected data using a pre-tested, standardized questionnaire. A multivariate logistic regression analysis conducted to identify risk factors for hypertension. Statistical significance was declared using a p-value&lt;0.05 and 95% of confidence interval (CI) for an adjusted odds ratio (AOR). Results The overall prevalence of hypertension was 16% (95% CI: 13.10–21.9) and the proportion of awareness (96.7%), treatment (31.3%) and control of hypertension (40.1%) among employees. Being male [AOR = 2.06, 95%CI:1.49, 2.84], ages groups of 30–49 years [AOR = 2.21, 95%CI:1.25, 3.89] and &gt;50years [AOR = 3.61, 95% CI:1.93, 6.69], Body Mass Index(BMI); underweight [AOR = 0.40, 95% CI; 0.20, 0.78], overweight [AOR = 1.70, 95%CI; 1.22, 2.33] and obesity [AOR = 3.20, 95% CI; 1.78, 5.78] were determinants for hypertension. Conclusion The prevalence of hypertension is relatively high in Mekelle city compared with previous reports. This study revealed that male sex, age-group, and BMI were evidenced as risk factors for hypertension. Policy makers need to consider sector wise integrating prevention and control of hypertension. Skilled based information, education and communication strategies should be designed and implemented to avoid unhealthy lifestyles, investing in workforces to eliminate the modifiable risk factors for non-communicable diseases and promote healthy practices."
https://openalex.org/W2895315179,"The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) provides a genetic characterization of more than ten thousand tumors, enabling the discovery of novel driver mutations, molecular subtypes, and enticing drug targets across many histologies. Here we investigated why some mutations are common in particular cancer types but absent in others. As an example, we observed that the gene CCDC168 has no mutations in the stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) cohort despite its common presence in other tumor types. Surprisingly, we found that the lack of called mutations was due to a systematic insufficiency in the number of sequencing reads in the STAD and other cohorts, as opposed to differential driver biology. Using strict filtering criteria, we found similar behavior in four other genes across TCGA cohorts, with each gene exhibiting systematic sequencing depth issues affecting the ability to call mutations. We identified the culprit as the choice of exome capture kit, as kit choice was highly associated with the set of genes that have insufficient reads to call a mutation. Overall, we found that thousands of samples across all cohorts are subject to some capture kit problems. For example, for the 6353 samples using the Broad Institute’s Custom capture kit there are undercalling biases for at least 4833 genes. False negative mutation calls at these genes may obscure biological similarities between tumor types and other important cancer driver effects in TCGA datasets."
https://openalex.org/W2895305804,"Background Clinical practice guidelines contain recommendations for physicians to determine the most appropriate care for patients. These guidelines systematically combine scientific evidence and clinical judgment, culminating in recommendations intended to optimize patient care. The recommendations in CPGs are supported by evidence which varies in quality. We aim to survey the clinical practice guidelines created by the American College of Gastroenterology, report the level of evidence supporting their recommendations, and identify areas where evidence can be improved with additional research. Methods We extracted 1328 recommendations from 39 clinical practice guidelines published by the American College of Gastroenterology. Several of the clinical practice guidelines used the differing classifications of evidence for their recommendations. To standardize our results, we devised a uniform system for evidence. Results A total of 39 clinical practice guidelines were surveyed in our study. Together they account for 1328 recommendations. 693 (52.2%) of the recommendations were based on low evidence, indicating poor evidence or expert opinion. Among individual guidelines, 13/39 (33.3%) had no recommendations based on high evidence. Conclusion Very few recommendations made by the American College of Gastroenterology are supported by high levels of evidence. More than half of all recommendations made by the American College of Gastroenterology are based on low-quality evidence or expert opinion."
https://openalex.org/W2895647282,"Fragility fractures are a well-known complication following oncologic radiotherapy, and it is suspected that radiation-induced embrittlement of bone within the treatment field may contribute to fracture risk. To explore this phenomenon, a mouse model (BALB/cJ) of fractionated, limited field, bilateral hindlimb irradiation (4x5 Gy) was used. The effects of radiation on femoral (cortical) bone fracture toughness, morphology, and biochemistry-including advanced glycation end products (AGEs)-were quantified and compared to Sham group samples prior to irradiation and at 0, 4, 8, and 12 weeks post-irradiation. Additionally, alterations to bone fracture toughness mediated directly by radiation (independent of cellular mechanisms) were determined using devitalized mouse cadaver femurs. Finally, the contribution of AGEs to reduced fracture toughness was examined by artificially ribosylating mouse femurs ex vivo. These data demonstrate that in vivo irradiation results in an immediate (-42% at 0 weeks, p < 0.001) and sustained (-28% at 12 weeks, p < 0.001) decrease in fracture toughness with small changes in morphology (-5% in cortical area at 12 weeks), and minimal changes in bone composition (tissue mineral density, mineral:matrix ratio, and AGE content). Irradiation of devitalized femurs also reduced fracture toughness (-29%, p < 0.001), but to a lesser extent than was seen in vivo. While artificial ribosylation decreased fracture toughness with time, the extent of glycation needed to induce this effect exceeded the AGE accumulation that occurred in vivo. Overall, hindlimb irradiation induced a substantial and sustained decrease in bone fracture toughness. Approximately half of this decrease in fracture toughness is due to direct radiation damage, independent of cellular remodeling. Collagen glycation in vivo was not substantially altered, suggesting other matrix changes may contribute to post-radiotherapy bone embrittlement."
https://openalex.org/W2895658729,"Naturally occurring entomopathogenic fungi such as Conidiobolus coronatus are important regulatory factors of insect populations. GC-MS analysis of fungal cell-free filtrates showed that C. coronatus synthesizes two β- carboline alkaloids: harman and norharman. Significantly higher levels of both alkaloids are produced by C. coronatus in minimal postincubation medium than in rich medium. The beta-carboline alkaloids may have an effect on the nervous system of insects and their behavior. Harman and norharman were applied to Galleria mellonella larvae (a parasite of honeybees) either topically or mixed with food. Larvae received alkaloids in three concentrations: 750, 1000 or 1250 ppm. The effect on the survival and further development of larvae was examined. Both harman and norharman delayed pupation and adult eclosion, and inhibit total monoamine oxidase activity. In addition, they increased the serotonin concentration and decreased the monoamine oxidase A level in the heads of the moths. It is likely that the alkaloids were metabolized by the insects, as their effect wore off 24 hours after topical application. This is the first study to show that C. coronatus produces alkaloids. Its aim was to identify the actions of β-carboline alkaloids on insect development and serotonin-regulating enzymes. Knowledge of the potential role of harman and norharman in the process of fungal infection might lead to the development of more effective and environmentally-friendly means of controlling insect pests."
https://openalex.org/W2895692674,"Ovarian cancer is a heterogeneous disease. Data regarding familial risks for specific proband, age at diagnosis and histology are limited. Such data can assist genetic counseling and help elucidate etiologic differences among various histologic types of ovarian malignancies. By using the Swedish Family-Cancer Database, we calculated relative risks (RRs) for detailed family histories using a two-way comparison, which implied e.g. estimation of RRs for overall ovarian cancer when family history was histology-specific ovarian cancer, and conversely, RRs for histology-specific ovarian cancer when family history was overall ovarian cancer. In families of only mother, only sisters or both mother and sisters diagnosed with ovarian cancer, cancer risks for ovary were 2.40, 2.59 and 10.40, respectively; and were higher for cases diagnosed before the age of 50 years. All histological types showed a familial risk in two-way analyses, except mucinous and sex cord-stromal tumors. RRs for concordant histology were found for serous (2.47), endometrioid (3.59) and mucinous ovarian cancers (6.91). Concordant familial risks were highest for mucinous cancer; for others, some discordant associations, such as endometrioid-undifferentiated (9.27) and serous-undifferentiated (4.80), showed the highest RRs. Familial risks are high for early-onset patients and for those with multiple affected relatives. Sharing of different histological types of ovarian cancer is likely an indication of the complexity of the underlying mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2895701161,"Introduction Exposure to hypoxic conditions is reported to impair cognitive performance. Further, moderate physical exercise improves cognitive function, but little is known about the influence of exercise on cognitive function in hypoxia. Therefore, the current study aimed to examine the influence of hypoxia (HYP) and prolonged exercise (EX) on attentional performance. Methods A total of 80 participants (female: n = 29; male: n = 51) were assigned to four groups: HYP + EX (n = 15), HYP (n = 25), EX (n = 21) and normoxia (NOR) (n = 21). The Frankfurt Attention Inventory—2 (FAIR-2) was performed at four testing points (day 1, 14, 16 and 18) to assess attentional performance. All groups completed a pretest (D1) and a follow-up test (D18). In HYP + EX conditions, the cognitive task was performed in a hypoxic state after prolonged exercise (D14: 3950 m, D16: 5739 m) during a mountain climb on Mt. Kilimanjaro. Participants in HYP were tested under intermittent hypoxia at rest in a hypoxic chamber (D14: 3500 m, D16: 5800 m), and those in EX were tested under normoxia after prolonged exercise during a 7-day backcountry ski hiking tour. NOR was a control group, and participants completed all tests under normoxia and at rest. Results Hypoxia impaired the attentional functions performance value (PV) and continuity value (CV) for the HYP + EX (p = 0.000) and HYP (L: p = 0.025; K: p = 0.043) groups at 5739 m and 5800 m, respectively, but not the function quality value (QV). In contrast, the EX group did not exhibit changes in attentional function. Conclusion The current results suggest that attentional performance is impaired during extreme normobaric and hypobaric hypoxic exposure. We further conclude that greater cognitive impairment under hypobaric hypoxia during a mountain climb compared with normobaric hypoxia at rest is not caused by prolonged exercise, but may be influenced by other factors (e.g. low temperatures, dehydration, or sleep deprivation) that remain to be verified."
https://openalex.org/W2895047333,"Wind and temperature data are important parameters in aircraft performance studies. The lack of accurate measurements of these parameters forces researchers to rely on numerical weather prediction models, which are often filtered for a larger area with decreased local accuracy. Aircraft, however, also transmit information related to weather conditions, in response to interrogation by air traffic controller surveillance radars. Although not intended for this purpose, aircraft surveillance data contains information that can be used for weather models. This paper presents a method that can be used to reconstruct a weather field from surveillance data that can be received with a simple 1090 MHz receiver. Throughout the paper, we answer two main research questions: how to accurately infer wind and temperature from aircraft surveillance data, and how to reconstruct a real-time weather grid efficiently. We consider aircraft as moving sensors that measure wind and temperature conditions indirectly at different locations and flight levels. To address the first question, aircraft barometric altitude, ground velocity, and airspeed are decoded from down-linked surveillance data. Then, temperature and wind observations are computed based on aeronautical speed conversion equations. To address the second question, we propose a novel Meteo-Particle (MP) model for constructing the wind and temperature fields. Short-term local prediction is also possible by employing a predictor layer. Using an unseen observation test dataset, we are able to validate that the mean absolute errors of inferred wind and temperature using MP model are 67% and 26% less than using the interpolated model based on GFS reanalysis data."
https://openalex.org/W2894766171,"Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) worsens the prognosis and outcomes of chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, while the haemoglobin level is unreliable for early detection of IDA, reticulocyte haemoglobin content (CHr) and hypochromic red cells (%HYPO) are early markers of IDA.This was a cross sectional study of black adult participants (n = 258) with CKD and apparently healthy members of staff and patients' relatives (n = 141) at the Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Academic Hospital, South Africa, between 1 June 2016 and 31 December 2016. Serum iron, serum ferritin and transferrin were measured using standard laboratory methods, while the haematology analyser was employed to measure CHr and %HYPO. The validity of CHr and %HYPO as markers of IDA were evaluated. Multivariable binary logistic regression was conducted to determine predictors of the relationship between IDA, CHr and %HYPO. The area under the receiver operator characteristics (ROC) curve (AUC) of the final models were utilised to evaluate the discriminatory value of CHr and %HYPO respectively.About one-quarter (26.1%) of the participants had IDA which was more than three times more frequent among CKD patients, compared to controls (35.3% vs 9.2%); 32.3% (95%CI: 27.90%- 37.10%) of the study population had iron deficiency without anaemia and the prevalence of iron deficiency without anaemia was lower in CKD patients compared to controls (29.5% vs 37.6%). The mean age of CKD patients was higher than in controls (52.7 ±14.3 vs 40.4 ±12.6 years, P-value<0.001). The sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing IDA among CKD participants was 62.6% and 80.2% respectively for CHr (at a cut-off value of <28pg) and 63.3% and 79.8% respectively for %HYPO. CKD participants with CHr levels >28pg were 82% less likely to be diagnosed as having IDA as compared to those with CHr levels ≤ 28pg) (adj odds ratio = 0.18, 95% CI: 0.09-0.37). The AUC of CHr (0.81, 95% CI: 0.76-0.87) was higher than the AUC of %HYPO (0.76, 95%CI: 0.70-0.82).The diagnostic usefulness of CHr and the screening performance of %HYPO in predicting IDA among CKD patients are high. Their lower cost compared to conventional markers of ID recommend their use in clinical practice. Further cost effectiveness studies of these parameters are warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2917222032,"Ethiopia’s average life expectancy has improved by more than 18 years from 1990 to 2015. This initiated interest to study the gain in life expectancy with respect to age structure and cause of death. Applying a life expectancy decomposition technique on secondary data obtained from the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation, the study found that the burden of disease in Ethiopia has declined from 626.18 in 1990 to 225.69 in 2015 per 1000 population measured in age-standardized rate of life years lost. The major causes of burden in 1990; namely lower respiratory tract infections, neonatal disorders, diarrheal diseases and neglected tropical diseases at rates of 89.2, 63.2, 61.2, and 42.2 age-standardized years of life lost per 1000 population respectively; have shown a fast decline in 2015. Deaths from neglected tropical disease showed 94.95% reduction, contributing to 5.71(27.30%) years gain in life expectancy followed by lower respiratory tract infection and diarrheal disease contributing about 4.65 years (22.23%) and 1.48 years (7.10%) respectively. On the other hand, about 3.3 (15.73%) years and 6.4 (30.71%) years of increase in life expectancy are achieved through improved longevity in infants and children aged 1–4 years respectively. In conclusion, the study found that reductions in under-five child mortality and decline in burden of major communicable diseases could explain the major gain in life expectancy. However, findings also revealed that the prevalence of non-communicable diseases and injuries are on the rise calling for the need to be addressed by the public health system."
https://openalex.org/W2894621797,"Neuroscience investigations are most often focused on the prediction of future perception or decisions based on prior brain states or stimulus presentations. However, the brain can also process information retroactively, such that later stimuli impact conscious percepts of the stimuli that have already occurred (called “postdiction”). Postdictive effects have thus far been mostly unimodal (such as apparent motion), and the models for postdiction have accordingly been limited to early sensory regions of one modality. We have discovered two related multimodal illusions in which audition instigates postdictive changes in visual perception. In the first illusion (called the “Illusory Audiovisual Rabbit”), the location of an illusory flash is influenced by an auditory beep-flash pair that follows the perceived illusory flash. In the second illusion (called the “Invisible Audiovisual Rabbit”), a beep-flash pair following a real flash suppresses the perception of the earlier flash. Thus, we showed experimentally that these two effects are influenced significantly by postdiction. The audiovisual rabbit illusions indicate that postdiction can bridge the senses, uncovering a relatively-neglected yet critical type of neural processing underlying perceptual awareness. Furthermore, these two new illusions broaden the Double Flash Illusion, in which a single real flash is doubled by two sounds. Whereas the double flash indicated that audition can create an illusory flash, these rabbit illusions expand audition’s influence on vision to the suppression of a real flash and the relocation of an illusory flash. These new additions to auditory-visual interactions indicate a spatio-temporally fine-tuned coupling of the senses to generate perception."
https://openalex.org/W2894677813,"African American women in the state of Arkansas have high breast cancer mortality rates. Breast cancer risk assessment tools developed for African American underestimate breast cancer risk. Combining African American breast cancer associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) into breast cancer risk algorithms may improve individualized estimates of a woman’s risk of developing breast cancer and enable improved recommendation of screening and chemoprevention for women at high risk. The goal of this study was to confirm with an independent dataset consisting of Arkansas women of color, whether a genetic risk score derived from common breast cancer susceptibility SNPs can be combined with a clinical risk estimate provided by the Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool (BCRAT) to produce a more accurate individualized breast cancer risk estimate. A population-based cohort of African American women representative of Arkansas consisted of 319 cases and 559 controls for this study. Five-year and lifetime risks from the BCRAT were measured and combined with a risk score based on 75 independent susceptibility SNPs in African American women. We used the odds ratio (OR) per adjusted standard deviation to evaluate the improvement in risk estimates produced by combining the polygenic risk score (PRS) with 5-year and lifetime risk scores estimated using BCRAT. For 5-year risk OR per standard deviation increased from 1.84 to 2.08 with the addition of the polygenic risk score and from 1.79 to 2.07 for the lifetime risk score. Reclassification analysis indicated that 13% of cases had their 5-year risk increased above the 1.66% guideline threshold (NRI = 0.020 (95% CI -0.040, 0.080)) and 6.3% of cases had their lifetime risk increased above the 20% guideline threshold by the addition of the polygenic risk score (NRI = 0.034 (95% CI 0.000, 0.070)). Our data confirmed that discriminatory accuracy of BCRAT is improved for African American women in Arkansas with the inclusion of specific SNP breast cancer risk alleles."
https://openalex.org/W2895044267,"Skulls of 1,901 Eastern Atlantic harbor seals (Phoca vitulina vitulina) were systematically studied for externally visible dental anomalies and lesions. The sample comprised 927 males and 974 female individuals, with age at death ranging between 1 week and 25 years. Most of the skulls originated from animals collected in 1988, when the population suffered from a mass mortality event caused by the phocine distemper virus (PDV). Mean age (± SD) of females (6.7 ± 6.4 years) was higher (p = 0.002) than that of males (5.9 ± 5.2 years). In 264 individuals, one or more teeth were missing either congenitally (n = 26 animals, 1.4%) or due to intravital loss (n = 238 animals, 12.5%). One male exhibited congenital absence of all teeth (anodontia). As this animal had been reported to be almost hairless, the condition was tentatively diagnosed as a case of hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia. Males were more frequently (p = 0.002) affected by intravital tooth loss (15.0%) than females (10.2%). Supernumerary teeth were found in 3.4% of the skulls, with females (4.7%) showing hyperodontia more frequently (p < 0.001) than males (1.9%). Fifty-nine individuals (3.1%; 28 males, 31 females, p = 0.84) exhibited abnormal tooth morphology. Tooth fractures were noted in 40 seals (2.1%), with males being more frequently affected than females (p = 0.017). Periapical lesions were diagnosed in 143 skulls, with a tendency (p = 0.05) for males (8.7%) to be more frequently affected than females (6.4%). Enamel hypoplasia was not observed in the study sample. Analyzing the occurrence of dental anomalies and lesions in wild mammals can substantially contribute to an assessment of population health and thereby broaden the basis for effective species conservation and informed management decisions."
https://openalex.org/W2895065665,"Systemic inflammation is potentially associated with ocular diseases such as late age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Using the serum concentration of high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) as surrogate of systemic inflammation, we examined potential associations between the serum hs-CRP concentration and the presence and degree of eye diseases.The population-based Beijing Eye Study included 3468 Chinese individuals. The study participants underwent a standardized interview and a detailed ophthalmic examination. The serum concentration of hs-CRP was determined.Out of 3468 participants, 2452 (70.7%) individuals (mean age:63.4±9.4 year; range:50-91 years) had hs-CRP measurements (mean:1.96±4.07mg/L). In multivariate analysis, higher serum concentration of hs-CRP was significantly (regression coefficient r: 0.21) associated with a higher level of diabetic retinopathy (P = 0.007; standardized regression coefficient beta:0.06; non-standardized regression coefficient B:1.35; 95% confidence interval (CI):0.37,2.22) and polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (P = 0.002;beta:0.06;B:6.22;95%CI:2.24,10.2) after adjusting for higher serum concentration of high-density lipoproteins (P<0.001;beta:-0.12;B:-1.31;95%CI:-1.77,-0.85), higher body mass index (P = 0.01;beta:0.06;B:0.06;95%CI:0.01, 0.11), lower level of education (P = 0.04;beta:-0.06;B:-0.22;95%CI:-0.42,-0.02), lower cognitive function score (P = 0.01;beta:-0.07;B:-0.08;95%CI:-0.13,-0.02). If the presences of other ocular diseases were added to the model, the presence of glaucoma (P = 0.99), open-angle glaucoma (P = 0.80), angle-closure glaucoma (P = 0.67), pseudoexfoliation (P = 0.18), nuclear cataract (P = 0.30), cortical cataract (P = 0.15), subcapsular cataract (P = 0.59), retinal vein occlusions (P = 0.33), central serous choroidopathy (P = 0.44), early stage of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) (P = 0.46), intermediate stage of AMD (P = 0.20) and late stage of AMD (P = 0.91) including geographic atrophy (P = 0.60) or neovascular AMD (P = 0.68) were not significantly associated with the serum concentration of hs-CRP.In Chinese aged 50+ years, higher serum concentration of hs-CRP was significantly associated with a higher level of diabetic retinopathy and higher frequency of polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy. Other major ocular disorders, namely glaucoma including open-angle glaucoma and angle-closure glaucoma, pseudoexfoliation, nuclear, cortical or subcapsular cataract, retinal vein occlusions, central serous choroidopathy, early, intermediate or late stage of AMD including geographic atrophy, were not significantly associated with hs-CRP serum concentrations. It suggests that these diseases, in contrast to diabetic retinopathy and polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy, were not associated with a major systemic inflammatory component."

Whole-genome studies have revealed that H3K27me3 occupies critical developmental genes in both human and mouse embryonic stem cells, and often coexists with the active mark H3K4me3, forming a poised state at regulatory regions of differentiation genes (25Voigt P. Tee W.W. Reinberg D. A double take on bivalent promoters.Genes Dev. 2013; 27 (23788621): 1318-133810.1101/gad.219626.113Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar, 26Martin C. Zhang Y.

Chromatin accessibility depends on the overall effects of those histone modifications upon differentiation of signal stimulation (22Kimura H. Histone modifications for human epigenome analysis.J. Hum. Genet. 2013; 58 (23739122): 439-44510.1038/jhg.2013.66Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Although open chromatin signals have been reported to be associated with ME, endoderm, and mesoderm differentiation (27Loh K.M. Chen A. Koh P.W. Deng T.Z. Sinha R. Tsai J.M. Barkal A.A. Shen K.Y. Jain R. Morganti R.M. Shyh-Chang N. Fernhoff N.B. George B.M. Wernig G.

Our previous work demonstrated that during ME specification, Activin decreases H3K27me3 levels via the Smad2-mediated reduction of the EZH2 protein, the methyltransferase subunit of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) (11Wang L. Xu X. Cao Y. Li Z. Cheng H. Zhu G. Duan F. Na J. Han J.J. Chen Y.G.

To test whether decreased H3K27me3 would result in elevated chromatin accessibility in the early stage of Activin and Wnt-induced ME differentiation, we applied the assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with a high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) approach to assess accessible chromatin. We found that, although Activin stimulation could not alter global open chromatin, the decreased H3K27me3 modification at the transcription start site (TSS) regions elevates chromatin accessibility and thus facilitates the recruitment of β-catenin. Then Smad2 and β-catenin, together with other factors such as FOXH1, activate gene expression to ensure ME specification. From the Activin and Wnt-co-regulated genes, we further found that hyaluronan synthase 2 (HAS2) and aldehyde dehydrogenase 3 family member A2 (ALDH3A2), which are regulated by Smad2–β-catenin–FOXH1, are critical for ME differentiation. We have previously demonstrated that Activin A and Wnt3a could efficiently induce ME differentiation of human ESCs, and Activin A reduced H3K27me3 levels in the early stage of ME commitment (11Wang L. Xu X. Cao Y. Li Z. Cheng H. Zhu G. Duan F. Na J. Han J.J. Chen Y.G.

As H3K27me3 has been shown to associate with chromatin accessibility (24Wu J. Huang B. Chen H. Yin Q. Liu Y. Xiang Y. Zhang B. Liu B. Wang Q. Xia W. Li W. Li Y. Ma J. Peng X.

To this end, we performed ATAC-seq with human H1 ESCs upon treatment of 25 ng/ml of Activin A, 25 ng/ml of Wnt3a, or both (AW) for 6 h, but found no significant global open region changes at the early stage of mesendoderm differentiation (Fig. 1A). After analyzing the distribution of those open signals, we found a large percentage of open peaks were enriched around TSS regions (Fig. 1B). In addition, comparing gene expression profiles from the published RNA-seq data (11Wang L. Xu X. Cao Y. Li Z. Cheng H. Zhu G. Duan F. Na J. Han J.J. Chen Y.G.

By analyzing the published ChIP-sequencing (ChIP-seq) data of Smad2, H3K27me3, H3K4me3 (GSE81617) (11Wang L. Xu X. Cao Y. Li Z. Cheng H. Zhu G. Duan F. Na J. Han J.J. Chen Y.G.

ChIP-PCR analysis supported that Smad2 and β-catenin bound on the regulatory regions of T, EOMES, and FGF8 after AW treatment (Fig. 1E). Interestingly, the open regions coincided with the AW-induced H3K27me3 decrease and RNA polymerase II binding in these ME genes. Moreover, Wnt-induced β-catenin binding was well-overlapped with these regions, consistent with the cooperation of Smad2 and β-catenin to activate transcription of mesendoderm genes. Smad2 and β-catenin co-occupied the regulatory regions of the pluripotency genes OCT4 and SALL4, but they were not detected in the regulatory regions of the ectoderm gene SOX1 and the trophoblast gene CGA (Fig. 1, F and G). Next we explored the relationship of histone modifications and chromatin opening during ME specification at the genome-wide level. As shown in Fig. 2A, there was a close overlap between decreased H3K27me3 modification and open chromatin signals at about ±2.5k of TSS after AW treatment, whereas the H3K4me3 level showed little change. It has been shown that EZH2 plays a critical role in maintaining H3K27me3 levels during ME differentiation (11Wang L. Xu X. Cao Y. Li Z. Cheng H. Zhu G. Duan F. Na J. Han J.J. Chen Y.G.

To further confirm the role of Activin/Smad signaling in modulating H3K27me3 levels, we knocked down Smad2 in H1 cells (Fig. 2B), and found that Smad2 depletion did not change the expression of the pluripotency genes OCT4 and NANOG (Fig. 2C). In agreement with our early report (11Wang L. Xu X. Cao Y. Li Z. Cheng H. Zhu G. Duan F. Na J. Han J.J. Chen Y.G. Activin/Smad2-induced histone H3 Lys-27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) reduction is crucial to initiate mesendoderm differentiation of human embryonic stem cells.J. Biol.

Furthermore, Activin-induced EZH2 ubiquitination was decreased by Smurf2 knockdown (Fig. 2E), and the proteasome inhibitor MG132 attenuated AW-induced EZH2 degradation (Fig. 2F). In line with it, the proteasome inhibitors MG132 and bortezomib, but not the lysosome inhibitor bafilomycin A, blocked Activin-induced EZH2 degradation (Fig. 2G). These data together suggest that Activin/Smad2 signaling promotes EZH2 degradation through the proteasome pathway, reduces H3K27me3 modification, and thus alters the balance of H3K27me3-H3K4me3 in the open chromatin regions. As Smad2 has weak DNA binding ability and Smad2 cooperates with Smad4 to regulate transcription (14Massagué J. Seoane J. Wotton D.

Biol. 2016; 8 (27449814)a02207910.1101/cshperspect.a022079Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), we wondered whether the Smad2-mediated H3K27me3 decrease depends on Smad4. Transient depletion of Smad4 did not affect pluripotency gene expression but greatly impaired AW-induced ME differentiation (Fig. 3, A and B). Although knockdown of Smad4 dramatically reduced enrichment of Smad2 on ME genes (Fig. 3C), it had no impact on the Activin/Smad2-induced decrease of H3K27me3 and EZH2 (Fig. 3D). Together these data indicate that Smad4 is dispensable for Smad2-mediated H3K27me3 and EZH2 decrease, but is critical for Smad2 to bind to ME marker genes and contributes to ME differentiation. To explore the possible recruitment of transcription factors to the open chromatin regions, we picked up the top 200 enriched binding motifs of transcription factors in the open chromatin regions upon AW treatment and focused on those involved in lineage determination. Among them, the binding motifs of the mesenderm- or endoderm-related factors (ME: EOMES and T; endoderm: SOX17, FOXA2, and FOXH1) were strongly enriched (Fig. 4A), whereas the ectoderm (PAX6, SOX1, OLIG1) or trophoblast markers (GATA3, CDX2) were not (data not shown). EOMES and T not only serve as ME markers, but also are the critical regulators for ME fate determination (30Lolas M. Valenzuela P.D. Tjian R. Liu Z. Charting Brachyury-mediated developmental pathways during early mouse embryogenesis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

As enrichment of the binding motifs for Smad2/Smad3 and T cell factor 4 (TCF4) was also observed, we asked whether knockdown of Smad2 would influence β-catenin binding to the ME gene promoters. As shown in Fig. 4B, the AW-induced occupancy of β-catenin was abolished in Smad2 knockdown cells. As Smad2 mediates the transcription state by promoting EZH2 degradation and reducing H3K27me3 levels, we tested whether the EZH2 inhibitor DZNep could mimic the function of Activin/Smad2 to enhance β-catenin binding to ME gene promoters. Treatment using 25 ng/ml of Wnt3a for 6 h slightly increased β-catenin enrichment on the ME genes T, EOMES, and FGF8, but pretreatment of DZNep for 2 h apparently enhanced Wnt3a-induced β-catenin binding (Fig. 4C). These data indicate that Activin/Smad2-altered histone modification is required for β-catenin recruitment to ME genes. Furthermore, knockdown of either Smad2 or β-catenin greatly impaired expression of ME markers (Fig. 4D), indicating that cooperation of Smad2 and β-catenin is critical for AW-induced ME differentiation. The binding motif of FOXH1 was also enriched by Activin treatment (Fig. 4B). It has been shown that FOXH1 interacts with Smad2 and is required for Activin responses during early embryonic patterning (32Zhou S. Zawel L. Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B.

Consistently, FOXH1 knockdown dampened ME differentiation (Fig. 4E). By analyzing the FOXH1 ChIP-seq data (GSE29422) (37Kim S.W. Yoon S.J. Chuong E. Oyolu C. Wills A.E. Gupta R. Baker J.

Although FOXH1 interacted only with Smad2 but not with TCF4 or β-catenin upon AW treatment (Fig. 4F), depletion of either Smad2 or β-catenin affected FOXH1 binding on ME genes (Fig. 4G), suggesting that both Smad2 and β-catenin are important for FOXH1 recruitment. To identify the downstream mediators, we picked up 33 genes from our previous RNA-seq data that were significantly up-regulated by Activin and Wnt along mesendoderm differentiation (Fig. 5A, Table S2) (11Wang L.

To confirm the importance of Activin and Wnt signaling in the expression of HAS2 and ALDH3A2, we examined their expression in Smad2 or β-catenin-knockdown H1 cells. The expression of HAS2 and ALDH3A2 was induced by AW treatment, but apparently attenuated in the knockdown cells (Fig. 5D). Depletion of FOXH1 had a similar effect. Interestingly, FOXH1 knockdown also significantly impaired the recruitment of Smad2 and β-catenin to the HAS2 and ALDH3A2 genes (Fig. 5E). Taken together, our results indicate that Smad2, β-catenin, and FOXH1 cooperatively regulate the expression of HAS2 and ALDH3A2. To explore the function of HAS2 and ALDH3A2 in ME specification, we generated knockdown H1 cells (Fig. 5F). As shown in Fig. 5G, knockdown of HAS2 strongly attenuated the AW-induced expression of ME markers. ALDH3A2 also had a similar effect albeit to a lesser extent. Aldehyde dehydrogenases are critical in fatty acid metabolism, especially retinoic acid (RA) product"
https://openalex.org/W2894807127,"Telomeres, the specialized dynamic structures at chromosome ends, regularly shrink with every replication. Thus, they function as an internal molecular clock counting down the number of cell divisions. However, most cancer cells escape this limitation by activating telomerase, which can maintain telomere length. Previous studies showed that the benzylisoquinoline alkaloid chelidonine stimulates multiple modes of cell death and strongly down-regulates telomerase. It is still unknown if down-regulation of telomerase by chelidonine boosts substantial telomere shortening. The breast cancer cell line MCF7 was sequentially treated with very low concentrations of chelidonine over several cell passages. Telomere length and telomerase activity were measured by a monochrome multiplex quantitative PCR and a q-TRAP assay, respectively. Changes in population size and doubling time correlated well with telomerase inhibition and telomere shortening. MCF7 cell growth was arrested completely after three sequential treatments with 0.1 μM chelidonine, each ending after 48 h, while telomere length was reduced to almost 10% of the untreated control. However, treatment with 0.01 μM chelidonine did not have any apparent consequence. In addition to dose and time dependent telomerase inhibition, chelidonine changed the splicing pattern of hTERT towards non-enzyme coding isoforms of the transcript. In conclusion, telomere length and telomere stability are strongly affected by chelidonine in addition to microtubule formation."
https://openalex.org/W2895197396,"Bodies are important social cues for animals. Body recognition in humans is deteriorated by inversion. This inversion effect suggests the configural processing of bodies, which is different from the processing used for other objects. However, it is not known if this type of body processing exists in non-human primates. We tested seven chimpanzees using upright and inverted chimpanzee body stimuli and other stimuli in matching-to-sample tasks to examine the body inversion effect and the body parts that invoke it. Our results reflected the body inversion effect for intact chimpanzee bodies, bodies with complete body contours, and bodies with clear faces but not for the objects and other conditions that did not present complete body contours and clear faces. The results show that chimpanzees share configural body processing with humans and that bodies are special to them compared with other objects. The results also revealed the functions of faces and body contours in configural processing by chimpanzees."
https://openalex.org/W2895541191,"Background Tuberculosis (TB) patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection have worse TB treatment outcomes compared to patients with TB alone. The distribution of unfavourable treatment outcomes differs by socio-demographic and clinical characteristics, allowing for early identification of patients at risk. Objective To develop a statistical model that can provide individual probabilities of unfavourable outcomes based on demographic and clinical characteristics of TB-HIV co-infected patients. Methodology We used data from all TB patients with known HIV-positive test results (aged ≥15 years) registered for first-line anti-TB treatment (ATT) in 2015 under the Revised National TB Control Programme (RNTCP) in Delhi, India. We included variables on demographics and pre-treatment clinical characteristics routinely recorded and reported to RNTCP and the National AIDS Control Organization. Binomial logistic regression was used to develop a statistical model to estimate probabilities of unfavourable TB treatment outcomes (i.e., death, loss to follow-up, treatment failure, transfer out of program, and a switch to drug-resistant regimen). Results Of 55,260 TB patients registered for ATT in 2015 in Delhi, 928 (2%) had known HIV-positive test results. Of these, 816 (88%) had drug-sensitive TB and were ≥15 years. Among 816 TB-HIV patients included, 157 (19%) had unfavourable TB treatment outcomes. We developed a model for predicting unfavourable outcomes using age, sex, disease classification (pulmonary versus extra-pulmonary), TB treatment category (new or previously treated case), sputum smear grade, known HIV status at TB diagnosis, antiretroviral treatment at TB diagnosis, and CD4 cell count at ATT initiation. The chi-square p-value for model calibration assessed using the Hosmer-Lemeshow test was 0.15. The model discrimination, measured as the area under the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve, was 0.78. Conclusion The model had good internal validity, but should be validated with an independent cohort of TB-HIV co-infected patients to assess its performance before clinical or programmatic use."
https://openalex.org/W2894423688,"The Meaning Maintenance Model posits that individuals seek to resolve uncertainty by searching for patterns in the environment, yet little is known about how this is accomplished. Four studies investigated whether uncertainty has an effect on people's cognitive functioning. In particular, we investigated whether meaning threats lead to increased working memory capacity. In each study, we exposed participants to either an uncertain stimulus used to threaten meaning in past studies, or a control stimulus. Participants then completed a working memory measure, where they either had to recall lists of words (Studies 1, 2), or strings of digits (Studies 3, 4). We used both a frequentist approach and Bayesian analysis to evaluate our findings. Across the four studies, we find a small but consistent effect, where participants in the meaning threat condition show improved performance on the working memory tasks. Overall, our findings were consistent with the hypothesis that working memory capacity increases when people experience a meaning threat, which may help to explain improved pattern recognition. Additionally, our results highlight the value of using a Bayesian analytic approach, particularly when studying phenomena with high variance."
https://openalex.org/W2895315763,"RNA viruses replicate with a template-copying fidelity, which lies close to an extinction threshold. Increases of mutation rate by nucleotide analogues can drive viruses towards extinction. This transition is the basis of an antiviral strategy termed lethal mutagenesis. We have introduced a new diversity index, the rare haplotype load (RHL), to describe NS5B (polymerase) mutant spectra of hepatitis C virus (HCV) populations passaged in absence or presence of the mutagenic agents favipiravir or ribavirin. The increase in RHL is more prominent in mutant spectra whose expansions were due to nucleotide analogues than to multiple passages in absence of mutagens. Statistical tests for paired mutagenized versus non-mutagenized samples with 14 diversity indices show that RHL provides consistently the highest standardized effect of mutagenic treatment difference for ribavirin and favipiravir. The results indicate that the enrichment of viral quasispecies in very low frequency minority genomes can serve as a robust marker for lethal mutagenesis. The diagnostic value of RHL from deep sequencing data is relevant to experimental studies on enhanced mutagenesis of viruses, and to pharmacological evaluations of inhibitors suspected to have a mutagenic activity."

We used the growth standards of the World Health Organization (WHO) to calculate Z-scores for height and body mass index (BMI), and used the cut-offs recommended by WHO to define wasting, stunting, overweight, and obesity for each child. From 2004 to 2013, the prevalence of overweight increased from 3.70% to 7.27% and of obesity increased from 1.04% to 2.08%. Meanwhile, the prevalence of wasting decreased from 0.91% to 0.72% and of stunting decreased from 9.29% to 5.22%. These trends suggest there was still a double burden of nutritional status there. The nutritional interventions focusing on pre-school children should be comprehensively elaborated in lower-middle-income areas such as Luoding."

More convenient diagnostic methods are needed.Cardiac autonomic neuropathy risk score evaluated by SUDOSCAN has a fine diagnostic efficacy detecting cardiac autonomic neuropathy.This is a cross-sectional study among patients with diabetes mellitus. Subjects undertook SUDOSCAN tests and cardiac autonomic reflex tests, including heart rate variability due to Valsalva maneuver, heart rate response due to deep breathing and heart rate response due to standing up. Presenting 2 abnormal results was defined as cardiac autonomic neuropathy.Subjects with cardiac autonomic neuropathy has significantly higher cardiac autonomic neuropathy risk score (32.88±1.60 vs 27.64±1.24,P = 0.010). Cardiac autonomic neuropathy risk score was correlated significantly with the heart rate response due to deep breathing(P = 0.004). Multiple regression analysis including significant variables showed an independent association of cardiac autonomic neuropathy risk score and heart rate response due to deep breathing (P = 0.031) and age (P = 0.000). In receiver operating characteristic curve analysis evaluating the relationship between cardiac autonomic neuropathy risk score and cardiac autonomic neuropathy, The cut-off value was 20.5, with the sensitivity of 90.48%, the specificity of 29.5%, and the positive predictive value of 46.9%. In two-step diagnostic methods, Setting 20.5 as the cut-off value of cardiac autonomic neuropathy risk score and abnormal heart rate response due to standing up as the second diagnostic step's positive result, and setting 16.5 as the cut-off value of cardiac autonomic neuropathy risk score and abnormal heart rate response due to deep breathing as the second diagnostic step's positive result, both achieved good diagnostic efficacy.Cardiac autonomic neuropathy risk score evaluated by SUDOSCAN is a good screening test for cardiac autonomic neuropathy. The two-step diagnostic methods could be considered as surrogate diagnostic methods."
https://openalex.org/W2895052523,"Cardiac electrophysiological computational models are often developed from previously published models. The new models may incorporate additional features to adapt the model to a different species or may upgrade a specific ionic formulation based on newly available experimental data. A relevant challenge in the development of a new model is the estimation of certain ionic current conductances that cannot be reliably identified from experiments. A common strategy to estimate those conductances is by means of constrained non-linear least-squares optimization. In this work, a novel methodology is proposed for estimation of ionic current conductances of cardiac electrophysiological models by using a response surface approximation-based constrained optimization with trust region management. Polynomial response surfaces of a number of electrophysiological markers were built using statistical sampling methods. These markers included action potential duration (APD), triangulation, diastolic and systolic intracellular calcium concentration, and time constants of APD rate adaptation. The proposed methodology was applied to update the Carro et al. human ventricular action potential model after incorporation of intracellular potassium ([K+]i) dynamics. While the Carro et al. model was well suited for investigation of arrhythmogenesis, it did not allow simulation of [K+]i changes. With the methodology proposed in this study, the updated Carro et al. human ventricular model could be used to simulate [K+]i changes in response to varying extracellular potassium ([K+]o) levels. Additionally, it rendered values of evaluated electrophysiological markers within physiologically plausible ranges. The optimal values of ionic current conductances in the updated model were found in a notably shorter time than with previously proposed methodologies. As a conclusion, the response surface optimization-based approach proposed in this study allows estimating ionic current conductances of cardiac electrophysiological computational models while guaranteeing replication of key electrophysiological features and with an important reduction in computational cost with respect to previously published approaches. The updated Carro et al. model developed in this study is thus suitable for the investigation of arrhythmic risk-related conditions, including those involving large changes in potassium concentration."
https://openalex.org/W2895222534,"The present study was designed to investigate the influence of two distinct small-sided game (SSG) regimes on physiological, perceptual, and technical parameters in male elite lacrosse players.Data were collected in twelve elite male Austrian lacrosse players (25.8 ± 5.5 years; 80.1 ± 7.7 kg; 178.5 ± 6.2 cm). Players' were assigned to an intermittent (SSG-I) or a continuous (SSG-C) SSG regime, respectively. Regimes were equated for total practice time, but not active playing time. SSG data from eight sessions of 3 vs. 3 self-regulated match-play were collected along a 4-week pre-season period. Players' YoYo-Level 1 (YYL1) performance before and after the training intervention was recorded. Further, heart-rate (HR), rating of perceived exertion (RPE), physical activity enjoyment scale (PACES), and technical actions during and after SSG sessions were analyzed.Both SSG regimes showed improvement with medium to very large effect sizes (ES) in YYL1 total distance covered pre- to post-intervention (SSG-C mean-difference ± SD: 840 ± 299 m; p = 0.003; d = 1.08; CI = 0.60 to 1.56 and SSG-I: 607 ± 274 m; p = 0.003; d = 1.25; CI = 0.66 to 1.85 respectively). Higher %HRmax values with very large ES (92 ± 0.6%; p = 0.002; d = 5.33; CI = 2.78 to 7.88) and time spent in HR zone 4 (1248.0 ± 122.7 s; p = 0.000; d = 3.43; CI = 2.31 to 4.55) were observed for SSG-C. No differences between regimes were found for any of the assessed technical actions, global RPE, and PACES scores.Both SSG regimes investigated in this study were effective in improving YYL1 performance. Further, findings indicate that the regime does not influence players' subjective feelings and technical actions in SSG play. However, SSG-I in lacrosse specific training could have additional benefits such as lower signs of fatigue. Further, breaks can be used to give technical and tactical inputs by coaches."
https://openalex.org/W2895317690,"Studies on the behavioural function of sounds are very rare within heterospecific interactions. John Dory (Zeus faber) is a solitary, predatory fish that produces sound when captured, but has not been documented to vocalize under natural conditions (i.e. in the wild). The present study provides the first in-situ recordings of John Dory vocalisations and correlates them to behavioural response of snapper (Pagrus auratus) a common species found through New Zealand. Vocalisations or 'barks', ranged between 200-600 Hz, with a peak frequency of 312 ± 10 Hz and averaged 139 ± 4 milliseconds in length. Baited underwater video (BUV) equipped with hydrophones determined that under natural conditions a John Dory vocalization induced an escape response in snapper present, causing them to exit the area opposite to the position of the John Dory. We speculate that the John Dory vocalisation may be used for territorial display towards both conspecifics and heterospecifics, asserting dominance in the area or heightening predatory status."
https://openalex.org/W2895294823,"The ability of aquatic insects to colonize Earth's most remote freshwater habitats, such as those of islands and deserts, is limited to select taxa. Among black flies, the premiere colonization specialist is Simulium ruficorne Macquart, the only species known from both the Afrotropical and Palearctic regions. We investigated the cytogenetics of S. ruficorne to gain insight into its wide geographic distribution and ability to colonize oceanic islands and deserts. On the basis of larval polytene chromosomes from 14 locations, we documented 17 novel and previously known chromosomal rearrangements and established five cytoforms (A1, A2, B, C, and D), of which probably four (A1/A2, B, C, and D) are distinct species and two (A1 and A2) represent sex-chromosome polymorphism involving a heteroband in the long arm of chromosome III. The chromosome restructuring phenomena associated with the five cytoforms are consistent with the trend in the Simuliidae that one and the same rearrangement can assume different functions in the various descendants of a common ancestor in which the rearrangement was polymorphic. The most widely distributed cytoforms are A1 and A2, which are found in North Africa, the Canary Islands, and Majorca. Simulium ruficorne, the only known black fly in the Hoggar Mountains of the central Sahara Desert, represents a cohesive population of cytoform A1 little differentiated from other North African populations of A1 and A2. Cytoform B inhabits the West African mainland, cytoform C is on Tenerife, and cytoform D is on Cape Verde. We suggest that dispersal and colonization specialists, such as S. ruficorne, are multivoltine inhabitants of temporary streams, and must relocate as their habitats deteriorate. Simulium ruficorne, therefore, should have adaptations that contribute to successful dispersal and colonization, perhaps largely physiological in nature, such as tolerance of high temperatures and droughts."
https://openalex.org/W2895607736,"The vascular endothelium is considered as a key cell compartment for the response to ionizing radiation of normal tissues and tumors, and as a promising target to improve the differential effect of radiotherapy in the future. Following radiation exposure, the global endothelial cell response covers a wide range of gene, miRNA, protein and metabolite expression modifications. Changes occur at the transcriptional, translational and post-translational levels and impact cell phenotype as well as the microenvironment by the production and secretion of soluble factors such as reactive oxygen species, chemokines, cytokines and growth factors. These radiation-induced dynamic modifications of molecular networks may control the endothelial cell phenotype and govern recruitment of immune cells, stressing the importance of clearly understanding the mechanisms which underlie these temporal processes. A wide variety of time series data is commonly used in bioinformatics studies, including gene expression, protein concentrations and metabolomics data. The use of clustering of these data is still an unclear problem. Here, we introduce kernels between Gaussian processes modeling time series, and subsequently introduce a spectral clustering algorithm. We apply the methods to the study of human primary endothelial cells (HUVECs) exposed to a radiotherapy dose fraction (2 Gy). Time windows of differential expressions of 301 genes involved in key cellular processes such as angiogenesis, inflammation, apoptosis, immune response and protein kinase were determined from 12 hours to 3 weeks post-irradiation. Then, 43 temporal clusters corresponding to profiles of similar expressions, including 49 genes out of 301 initially measured, were generated according to the proposed method. Forty-seven transcription factors (TFs) responsible for the expression of clusters of genes were predicted from sequence regulatory elements using the MotifMap system. Their temporal profiles of occurrences were established and clustered. Dynamic network interactions and molecular pathways of TFs and differential genes were finally explored, revealing key node genes and putative important cellular processes involved in tissue infiltration by immune cells following exposure to a radiotherapy dose fraction."
https://openalex.org/W2895309425,"Understanding the molecular pathways regulating cardiogenesis is crucial for the early diagnosis of heart diseases and improvement of cardiovascular disease. During normal mammalian cardiac development, collagen and calcium-binding EGF domain-1 (Ccbe1) is expressed in the first and second heart field progenitors as well as in the proepicardium, but its role in early cardiac commitment remains unknown. Here we demonstrate that during mouse embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation Ccbe1 is upregulated upon emergence of Isl1- and Nkx2.5- positive cardiac progenitors. Ccbe1 is markedly enriched in Isl1-positive cardiac progenitors isolated from ESCs differentiating in vitro or embryonic hearts developing in vivo. Disruption of Ccbe1 activity by shRNA knockdown or blockade with a neutralizing antibody results in impaired differentiation of embryonic stem cells along the cardiac mesoderm lineage resulting in a decreased expression of mature cardiomyocyte markers. In addition, knockdown of Ccbe1 leads to smaller embryoid bodies. Collectively, our results show that CCBE1 is essential for the commitment of cardiac mesoderm and consequently, for the formation of cardiac myocytes in differentiating mouse ESCs."
https://openalex.org/W2895467536,"Autophagy and phagocytosis are cellular immune mechanisms for internalization and elimination of intracellular and extracellular pathogens. Some pathogens have evolved the ability to inhibit or manipulate these processes, raising the prospect of adaptive reciprocal co-evolution by the host. We performed population genetic analyses on phagocytosis and autophagy genes in Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans to test for molecular evolutionary signatures of immune adaptation. We found that phagocytosis and autophagy genes as a whole exhibited an elevated level of haplotype homozygosity in both species. In addition, we detected signatures of recent selection, notably in the Atg14 and Ykt6 genes in D. melanogaster and a pattern of elevated sequence divergence in the genderblind (gb) gene on the D. simulans lineage. These results suggest that the evolution of the host cellular immune system as a whole may be shaped by a dynamic conflict between Drosophila and its pathogens even without pervasive evidence of strong adaptive evolution at the individual gene level."

We also developed an Excel tool for simulation and assessed the aggregated-level indicators by the 2016 World Bank income groups.Using mostly 2016 data or 2014-15 data if 2016 one are not available, we updated five indicators relevant to the treaty implementation, which are the gap between current and desirable policy implementation, cigarette affordability, the costs of implementing best- buy tobacco control policies, the number of smoking-attributable deaths, and the simulated tax revenue resulting from a $1 tax increase. We also aggregated indicators and simulation results by the World Bank income groups, encompassing the five indicators and the reduction in smoking and in attributable deaths due to a hypothetical 1I$ tax increase. Finally, the policy implementation cost was compared with tax revenue and revenue increases.As of 2016, smoking remains one of the leading causes of premature deaths worldwide while the implementation of best-buy tobacco control policies was below the recommended levels. Meanwhile, there was room to further increase cigarette taxes and prices, as cigarettes remained affordable in many countries. The total costs of implementing best-buy policies in the next 15 years merely account for 8.3% of the 2016 excise tax revenue, indicating that a small proportion of annual tax revenue could fund the implementation of tobacco control policies recommended by the WHO FCTC.Increasing taxes could have a multiplier impact on curbing tobacco use through aiding the implementation of the WHO FCTC."
https://openalex.org/W2895390011,"Stride-to-stride fluctuations of joint kinematics during walking reflect a highly structured organization that is characteristic of healthy gait. The organization of stride-to-stride fluctuations is disturbed in lower-limb prosthesis users, yet the factors contributing to this difference are unclear. One potential contributor to the changes in stride-to-stride fluctuations is the altered push-off mechanics experienced by passive prosthesis users. The purpose of our study was to determine if changes in push-off mechanics affect stride-to-stride fluctuations in transtibial amputees. Twenty-two unilateral transtibial amputees were enrolled in the 6-week cross-over study, where High and Low Activity (based on the Medicare Functional Classification System) prostheses were worn for three weeks each. Data collection took place at the end of the third week. Participants walked on a treadmill in a motion capture laboratory to quantify stride-to-stride fluctuations of the lower extremity joint angle trajectories using the largest Lyapunov Exponent, and over floor-embedded force platforms to enable calculating push-off work from the prosthesis and the sound limb. Push-off work was 140% greater in the High Activity prosthesis compared to the Low Activity prosthesis (p < 0.001), however no significant change was observed in stride-to-stride fluctuations of the ankle between the two prosthesis types (p = 0.576). There was no significant correlation between changes in prosthesis push-off work and the largest Lyapunov exponent. Though differences in push-off work were observed between the two prosthesis types, stride-to-stride fluctuations remained similar, indicating that prosthesis propulsion mechanics may not be a strong determinant of stride-to-stride fluctuations in unpowered transtibial prosthesis users."
https://openalex.org/W2895194902,"The global trade system can be viewed as a dynamic ecosystem in which exporters struggle for resources: the markets in which they export. We can think that the aim of an exporter is to gain the entirety of a market share (say, car imports from the United States). This is similar to the objective of an organism in its attempt to monopolize a given subset of resources in an ecosystem. In this paper, we adopt a multilayer network approach to describe this struggle. We use longitudinal, multiplex data on trade relations, spanning several decades. We connect two countries with a directed link if the source country's appearance in a market correlates with the target country's disappearing, where a market is defined as a country-product combination in a given decade. Each market is a layer in the network. We show that, by analyzing the countries' network roles in each layer, we are able to classify them as out-competing, transitioning or displaced. This classification is a meaningful one: when testing the future export patterns of these countries, we show that out-competing countries have distinctly stronger growth rates than the other two classes."

Materials and methods Human BRAF V600E-positive melanoma xenograft (A375)-bearing Balb/c nude mice (n = 10) were imaged before (day 0) and after (day 7) a BRAF/MEK inhibitor combination therapy (encorafenib, 1.3 mg/kg/d; binimetinib, 0.6 mg/kg/d, n = 5) or placebo (n = 5), respectively. Optoacoustic imaging was performed on a preclinical system unenhanced and 5 h after i. v. injection of an αvβ3-integrin-targeted fluorescent probe. The αvβ3-integrin-specific tumor signal was derived by spectral unmixing. For morphology-based tumor response assessments, T2w MRI data sets were acquired on a clinical 3 Tesla scanner. The imaging results were validated by multiparametric immunohistochemistry (ß3 –integrin expression, CD31 –microvascular density, Ki-67 –proliferation). Results The αvβ3-integrin-specific tumor signal was significantly reduced under therapy, showing a unidirectional decline in all animals (from 7.98±2.22 to 1.67±1.30; p = 0.043). No significant signal change was observed in the control group (from 6.60±6.51 to 3.67±1.93; p = 0.500). Immunohistochemistry revealed a significantly lower integrin expression (ß3: 0.20±0.02 vs. 0.39±0.05; p = 0.008) and microvascular density (CD31: 119±15 vs. 292±49; p = 0.008) in the therapy group. Tumor volumes increased with no significant intergroup difference (therapy: +107±42 mm3; control +112±44mm3, p = 0.841). In vivo blocking studies with αvβ3-integrin antagonist cilengitide confirmed the target specificity of the fluorescent probe. Conclusions αvβ3-integrin-targeted optoacoustic imaging allowed for the early non-invasive monitoring of a BRAF/MEK inhibitor combination therapy in a murine model of human melanoma, adding molecular information on tumor receptor status to morphology-based tumor response criteria."
