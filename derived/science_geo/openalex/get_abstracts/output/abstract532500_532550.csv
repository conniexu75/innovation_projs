https://openalex.org/W1500925570,"Exosomes are lipid-bilayer-enclosed extracellular vesicles that contain proteins and nucleic acids. They are secreted by all cells and circulate in the blood. Specific detection and isolation of cancer-cell-derived exosomes in the circulation is currently lacking. Using mass spectrometry analyses, we identify a cell surface proteoglycan, glypican-1 (GPC1), specifically enriched on cancer-cell-derived exosomes. GPC1(+) circulating exosomes (crExos) were monitored and isolated using flow cytometry from the serum of patients and mice with cancer. GPC1(+) crExos were detected in the serum of patients with pancreatic cancer with absolute specificity and sensitivity, distinguishing healthy subjects and patients with a benign pancreatic disease from patients with early- and late-stage pancreatic cancer. Levels of GPC1(+) crExos correlate with tumour burden and the survival of pre- and post-surgical patients. GPC1(+) crExos from patients and from mice with spontaneous pancreatic tumours carry specific KRAS mutations, and reliably detect pancreatic intraepithelial lesions in mice despite negative signals by magnetic resonance imaging. GPC1(+) crExos may serve as a potential non-invasive diagnostic and screening tool to detect early stages of pancreatic cancer to facilitate possible curative surgical therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1823908009,"In response to DNA damage, tissue homoeostasis is ensured by protein networks promoting DNA repair, cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. DNA damage response signalling pathways coordinate these processes, partly by propagating gene-expression-modulating signals. DNA damage influences not only the abundance of messenger RNAs, but also their coding information through alternative splicing. Here we show that transcription-blocking DNA lesions promote chromatin displacement of late-stage spliceosomes and initiate a positive feedback loop centred on the signalling kinase ATM. We propose that initial spliceosome displacement and subsequent R-loop formation is triggered by pausing of RNA polymerase at DNA lesions. In turn, R-loops activate ATM, which signals to impede spliceosome organization further and augment ultraviolet-irradiation-triggered alternative splicing at the genome-wide level. Our findings define R-loop-dependent ATM activation by transcription-blocking lesions as an important event in the DNA damage response of non-replicating cells, and highlight a key role for spliceosome displacement in this process."
https://openalex.org/W1876329184,"U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP is a 1.5-megadalton pre-assembled spliceosomal complex comprising U5 small nuclear RNA (snRNA), extensively base-paired U4/U6 snRNAs and more than 30 proteins, including the key components Prp8, Brr2 and Snu114. The tri-snRNP combines with a precursor messenger RNA substrate bound to U1 and U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs), and transforms into a catalytically active spliceosome after extensive compositional and conformational changes triggered by unwinding of the U4 and U6 (U4/U6) snRNAs. Here we use cryo-electron microscopy single-particle reconstruction of Saccharomyces cerevisiae tri-snRNP at 5.9 Å resolution to reveal the essentially complete organization of its RNA and protein components. The single-stranded region of U4 snRNA between its 3' stem-loop and the U4/U6 snRNA stem I is loaded into the Brr2 helicase active site ready for unwinding. Snu114 and the amino-terminal domain of Prp8 position U5 snRNA to insert its loop I, which aligns the exons for splicing, into the Prp8 active site cavity. The structure provides crucial insights into the activation process and the active site of the spliceosome."

Etienne Simon-Loriere and colleagues provide new information about the evolution of the Ebola virus responsible for the epidemic in West Africa. They have obtained the sequences of 85 new Ebola virus genomes collected from patients infected from July to November 2014 in Guinea. They find evidence for sustained transmission of three co-circulating lineages, each defined by multiple mutations. An epidemic of Ebola virus disease of unprecedented scale has been ongoing for more than a year in West Africa. As of 29 April 2015, there have been 26,277 reported total cases (of which 14,895 have been laboratory confirmed) resulting in 10,899 deaths1. The source of the outbreak was traced to the prefecture of Guéckédou in the forested region of southeastern Guinea2,3. The virus later spread to the capital, Conakry, and to the neighbouring countries of Sierra Leone, Liberia, Nigeria, Senegal and Mali1. In March 2014, when the first cases were detected in Conakry, the Institut Pasteur of Dakar, Senegal, deployed a mobile laboratory in Donka hospital to provide diagnostic services to the greater Conakry urban area and other regions of Guinea. Through this process we sampled 85 Ebola viruses (EBOV) from patients infected from July to November 2014, and report their full genome sequences here. Phylogenetic analysis reveals the sustained transmission of three distinct viral lineages co-circulating in Guinea, including the urban setting of Conakry and its surroundings. One lineage is unique to Guinea and closely related to the earliest sampled viruses of the epidemic. A second lineage contains viruses probably reintroduced from neighbouring Sierra Leone on multiple occasions, while a third lineage later spread from Guinea to Mali. Each lineage is defined by multiple mutations, including non-synonymous changes in the virion protein 35 (VP35), glycoprotein (GP) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L) proteins. The viral GP is characterized by a glycosylation site modification and mutations in the mucin-like domain that could modify the outer shape of the virion. These data illustrate the ongoing ability of EBOV to develop lineage-specific and potentially phenotypically important variation."
https://openalex.org/W2126745010,"Air pollutants (AP) play a role in subclinical inflammation, and are associated with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is inflammatory and precedes cardiovascular morbidity and type 2 diabetes. Thus, a positive association between AP and MetS may be hypothesized. We explored this association, (taking into account, pathway-specific MetS definitions), and its potential modifiers in Swiss adults. We studied 3769 participants of the Swiss Cohort Study on Air Pollution and Lung and Heart Diseases in Adults, reporting at least four-hour fasting time before venepuncture. AP exposures were 10-year mean residential PM10 (particulate matter <10μm in diameter) and NO2 (nitrogen dioxide). Outcomes included MetS defined by World Health Organization (MetS-W), International Diabetes Federation (MetS-I) and Adult Treatment Panel-III (MetS-A) using four- and eight-hour fasting time limits. We also explored associations with individual components of MetS. We applied mixed logistic regression models to explore these associations. The prevalence of MetS-W, MetS-I and MetS-A were 10%, 22% and 18% respectively. Odds of MetS-W, MetS-I and MetS-A increased by 72% (51-102%), 31% (11-54%) and 18% (4-34%) per 10μg/m3 increase in 10-year mean PM10. We observed weaker associations with NO2. Associations were stronger among physically-active, ever-smokers and non-diabetic participants especially with PM10 (p<0.05). Associations remained robust across various sensitivity analyses including ten imputations of missing observations and exclusion of diabetes cases. The observed associations between AP exposure and MetS were sensitive to MetS definitions. Regarding the MetS components, we observed strongest associations with impaired fasting glycemia, and positive but weaker associations with hypertension and waist-circumference-based obesity. Cardio-metabolic effects of AP may be majorly driven by impairment of glucose homeostasis, and to a less-strong extent, visceral adiposity. Well-designed prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings."
https://openalex.org/W1917479940,"Bignoniaceae is a Pantropical plant family that is especially abundant in the Neotropics. Members of the Bignoniaceae are diverse in many ecosystems and represent key components of the Tropical flora. Despite the ecological importance of the Bignoniaceae and all the efforts to reconstruct the phylogeny of this group, whole chloroplast genome information has not yet been reported for any members of the family. Here, we report the complete chloroplast genome sequence of Tanaecium tetragonolobum (Jacq.) L.G. Lohmann, which was reconstructed using de novo and referenced-based assembly of single-end reads generated by shotgun sequencing of total genomic DNA in an Illumina platform. The gene order and organization of the chloroplast genome of T. tetragonolobum exhibits the general structure of flowering plants, and is similar to other Lamiales chloroplast genomes. The chloroplast genome of T. tetragonolobum is a circular molecule of 153,776 base pairs (bp) with a quadripartite structure containing two single copy regions, a large single copy region (LSC, 84,612 bp) and a small single copy region (SSC, 17,586 bp) separated by inverted repeat regions (IRs, 25,789 bp). In addition, the chloroplast genome of T. tetragonolobum has 38.3% GC content and includes 121 genes, of which 86 are protein-coding, 31 are transfer RNA, and four are ribosomal RNA. The chloroplast genome of T. tetragonolobum presents a total of 47 tandem repeats and 347 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) with mononucleotides being the most common and di-, tri-, tetra-, and hexanucleotides occurring with less frequency. The results obtained here were compared to other chloroplast genomes of Lamiales available to date, providing new insight into the evolution of chloroplast genomes within Lamiales. Overall, the evolutionary rates of genes in Lamiales are lineage-, locus-, and region-specific, indicating that the evolutionary pattern of nucleotide substitution in chloroplast genomes of flowering plants is complex. The discovery of tandem repeats within T. tetragonolobum and the presence of divergent regions between chloroplast genomes of Lamiales provides the basis for the development of markers at various taxonomic levels. The newly developed markers have the potential to greatly improve the resolution of molecular phylogenies."
https://openalex.org/W2102575773,"14-3-3 proteins act as adapters that exert their function by interacting with their various protein partners. 14-3-3 proteins have been implicated in a variety of human diseases including neurodegenerative diseases. 14-3-3 proteins have recently been reported to be abundant in the neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) observed inside the neurons of brains affected by Alzheimer's disease (AD). These NFTs are mainly constituted of phosphorylated Tau protein, a microtubule-associated protein known to bind 14-3-3. Despite this indication of 14-3-3 protein involvement in the AD pathogenesis, the role of 14-3-3 in the Tauopathy remains to be clarified. In the present study, we shed light on the role of 14-3-3 proteins in the molecular pathways leading to Tauopathies. Overexpression of the 14-3-3σ isoform resulted in a disruption of the tubulin cytoskeleton and prevented neuritic outgrowth in neurons. NMR studies validated the phosphorylated residues pSer214 and pSer324 in Tau as the 2 primary sites for 14-3-3 binding, with the crystal structure of 14-3-3σ in complex with Tau-pSer214 and Tau-pSer324 revealing the molecular details of the interaction. These data suggest a rationale for a possible pharmacologic intervention of the Tau/14-3-3 interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1907112997,"Sexual arousal is a motivational state that moves humans toward situations that inherently pose a risk of disease transmission. Disgust is an emotion that adaptively moves humans away from such situations. Incongruent is the fact that sexual activity is elementary to human fitness yet involves strong disgust elicitors. Using an experimental paradigm, we investigated how these two states interact. Women (final N=76) were assigned to one of four conditions: rate disgust stimuli then watch a pornographic clip; watch a pornographic clip then rate disgust stimuli; rate fear stimuli then watch a pornographic clip; or watch a pornographic clip then rate fear stimuli. Women’s genital sexual arousal was measured with vaginal photoplethysmography and their disgust and fear reactions were measured via self-report. We did not find that baseline disgust propensity predicted sexual arousal in women who were exposed to neutral stimuli before erotic content. In the Erotic-before-Disgust condition we did not find that sexual arousal straightforwardly predicted decreased image disgust ratings. However, we did find some evidence that sexual arousal increased self-reported disgust in women with high trait disgust and sexual arousal decreased self-reported disgust in women with low trait disgust. Women who were exposed to disgusting images before erotic content showed significantly less sexual arousal than women in the control condition or women exposed to fear-inducing images before erotic content. In the Disgust-before-Erotic condition the degree of self-reported disgust was negatively correlated with genital sexual arousal. Hence, in the conflict between the ultimate goals of reproduction and disease avoidance, cues of the presence of pathogens significantly reduce the motivation to engage in mating behaviors that, by their nature, entail a risk of pathogen transmission."
https://openalex.org/W1538304276,"The molecularly defined clade Ecdysozoa comprises the panarthropods (Euarthropoda, Onychophora and Tardigrada) and the cycloneuralian worms (Nematoda, Nematomorpha, Priapulida, Loricifera and Kinorhyncha). These disparate phyla are united by their means of moulting, but otherwise share few morphological characters--none of which has a meaningful fossilization potential. As such, the early evolutionary history of the group as a whole is largely uncharted. Here we redescribe the 508-million-year-old stem-group onychophoran Hallucigenia sparsa from the mid-Cambrian Burgess Shale. We document an elongate head with a pair of simple eyes, a terminal buccal chamber containing a radial array of sclerotized elements, and a differentiated foregut that is lined with acicular teeth. The radial elements and pharyngeal teeth resemble the sclerotized circumoral elements and pharyngeal teeth expressed in tardigrades, stem-group euarthropods and cycloneuralian worms. Phylogenetic results indicate that equivalent structures characterized the ancestral panarthropod and, seemingly, the ancestral ecdysozoan, demonstrating the deep homology of panarthropod and cycloneuralian mouthparts, and providing an anatomical synapomorphy for the ecdysozoan supergroup."
https://openalex.org/W1429277116,"Photochemical transformation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) has been studied for more than two decades. Usually, laboratory or ""in-situ"" experiments are used to determine photodegradation variables. A common problem with these experiments is that the photodegradation experiments are done at higher than ambient temperature. Five laboratory experiments were done to determine the effect of temperature on photochemical degradation of DOM. Experimental results showed strong dependence of photodegradation on temperature. Mathematical modeling of processes revealed that two different pathways engaged in photochemical transformation of DOM to dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) strongly depend on temperature. Direct oxidation of DOM to DIC dominated at low temperatures while conversion of DOM to intermediate particulate organic carbon (POC) prior to oxidation to DIC dominated at high temperatures. It is necessary to consider this strong dependence when the results of laboratory experiments are interpreted in regard to natural processes. Photodegradation experiments done at higher than ambient temperature will necessitate correction of rate constants."
https://openalex.org/W2110635672,"Predictable seasonal change in photoperiod triggers a sequential change in the daily activity-rest pattern, adaptive for migration in several bird species. The night-migratory black-headed bunting (Emberiza melanocephala) is day active under short photoperiods (8 h light:16 h dark, short day sensitive). Under long photoperiods (16 h light:8 h dark), the buntings are initially day active (long day premigratory) but subsequently become intensely night active (long day migratory) and after few weeks again return to a day active pattern (long day refractory). However, it is unclear how the daily expression of circadian genes changes during photoperiod-induced seasonal life-history states (LHSs). We measured period 2 (Per2), cryptochrome 1 (Cry1), brain and muscle arnt-like protein 1 (Bmal1), and circadian locomotor output cycles kaput (Clock) mRNA expressions in various neural and peripheral tissues of buntings in different LHSs and discovered differences of ∼2 to 6 h in the phase and 2- to 4-fold in amplitude of circadian oscillations of Per2, Cry1, and Bmal1 between photoperiod-induced LHSs. Phase relationship in mRNA oscillations was altered between oscillator components in the circadian pacemaker system (retina, pineal, hypothalamus) as well as in the peripheral (liver, muscle) tissues. These results show for the first time altered waveforms of clock gene expressions in all tissues in parallel with behavioral shifts and suggest the involvement of circadian system in photoperiod induction of seasonal LHSs in a migratory species."
https://openalex.org/W1840715785,"It is important to predict the incipient fault in transformer oil accurately so that the maintenance of transformer oil can be performed correctly, reducing the cost of maintenance and minimise the error. Dissolved gas analysis (DGA) has been widely used to predict the incipient fault in power transformers. However, sometimes the existing DGA methods yield inaccurate prediction of the incipient fault in transformer oil because each method is only suitable for certain conditions. Many previous works have reported on the use of intelligence methods to predict the transformer faults. However, it is believed that the accuracy of the previously proposed methods can still be improved. Since artificial neural network (ANN) and particle swarm optimisation (PSO) techniques have never been used in the previously reported work, this work proposes a combination of ANN and various PSO techniques to predict the transformer incipient fault. The advantages of PSO are simplicity and easy implementation. The effectiveness of various PSO techniques in combination with ANN is validated by comparison with the results from the actual fault diagnosis, an existing diagnosis method and ANN alone. Comparison of the results from the proposed methods with the previously reported work was also performed to show the improvement of the proposed methods. It was found that the proposed ANN-Evolutionary PSO method yields the highest percentage of correct identification for transformer fault type than the existing diagnosis method and previously reported works."
https://openalex.org/W1493190930,"aim of this study was to identify outcomes in pain relief and quality of life in patients with a solitary painful osseous metastasis treated by radiotherapy, cryoablation or the combination using a propensity score matching study design.175 patients with painful bone metastases were included in the study. Twenty-five of them underwent a radiation course (20 Gy in five daily fractions) 15 days after the cryoablation. These subjects were retrospectively matched by propensity analysis with a group of subjects treated by radiotherapy (125 subjects) and with a group treated byCryoablation (25 subjects). The pain relief in terms of complete response, rate of subjects requiring analgesics after treatments and the changes in self-rated quality of life were measured. Informed consent was obtained from the subject and the study was approved by the local Ethical Committee.An higher proportion of subjects treated by cryoablation (32%) or cryoablation followed by RT (72%;) experienced a complete response compared with patients treated by radiotherapy alone (11.2%). After Bonferroni correction strategy, the addition of radiotherapy to cryoablation significantly improved the rate of complete response compared with cryoablation alone (p = 0.011) and this paralleled with an improved self-rated quality of life. Seventeen subjects (13.6%) of patients in the radiotherapy group, 9 (36%) in the cryoablation group, and 19 (76)% in the cryoablation- radiotherapy group did not require narcotic medications.The addition of radiotherapy to cryoablation favorably impacts on perceived pain, with a favorable toxicity profile. However, our data should be interpreted with caution and could serve as a framework around which to design future trials."
https://openalex.org/W1599954051,"Generalized osteoporosis is common in patients with inflammatory diseases, possibly because of circulating inflammatory factors that affect osteoblast and osteoclast formation and activity. Serum levels of the inflammatory factors CXCL8 and CCL20 are elevated in rheumatoid arthritis, but whether these factors affect bone metabolism is unknown. We hypothesized that CXCL8 and CCL20 decrease osteoblast proliferation and differentiation, and enhance osteoblast-mediated osteoclast formation and activity. Human primary osteoblasts were cultured with or without CXCL8 (2-200 pg/ml) or CCL20 (5-500 pg/ml) for 14 days. Osteoblast proliferation and gene expression of matrix proteins and cytokines were analyzed. Osteoclast precursors were cultured with CXCL8 (200 pg/ml) and CCL20 (500 pg/ml), or with conditioned medium (CM) from CXCL8 and CCL20-treated osteoblasts with or without IL-6 inhibitor. After 3 weeks osteoclast formation and activity were determined. CXCL8 (200 pg/ml) and CCL20 (500 pg/ml) enhanced mRNA expression of KI67 (2.5-2.7-fold), ALP (1.6-1.7-fold), and IL-6 protein production (1.3-1.6-fold) by osteoblasts. CXCL8-CM enhanced the number of osteoclasts with 3-5 nuclei (1.7-fold), and with >5 nuclei (3-fold). CCL20-CM enhanced the number of osteoclasts with 3-5 nuclei (1.3-fold), and with >5 nuclei (2.8-fold). IL-6 inhibition reduced the stimulatory effect of CXCL8-CM and CCL20-CM on formation of osteoclasts. In conclusion, CXCL8 and CCL20 did not decrease osteoblast proliferation or gene expression of matrix proteins. CXCL8 and CCL20 did not directly affect osteoclastogenesis. However, CXCL8 and CCL20 enhanced osteoblast-mediated osteoclastogenesis, partly via IL-6 production, suggesting that CXCL8 and CCL20 may contribute to osteoporosis in rheumatoid arthritis by affecting bone cell communication."

https://openalex.org/W1962157876,"Smooth muscle cells (SMCs) are a key component of healthy and tissue engineered vessels and play a crucial role in vascular development and the pathogenic events of vascular remodeling i.e. restenosis. However, the cell source from which they can be isolated is limited. Embryonic stem (ES) cells that have the remarkable capability to differentiate into vascular SMCs in response to specific stimuli provide a useful model for studying SMC differentiation. Previous studies suggested that dickkopf homolog 3 (DKK3) has a role in human partially induced pluripotent stem cell to SMC differentiation. Here, we demonstrate that the expression of DKK3 is essential for the expression of SMC markers and myocardin at both the mRNA and protein levels during mouse ES cell differentiation into SMCs (ESC-SMC differentiation). Overexpression of DKK3 leads to further up-regulation of the aforementioned markers. Further investigation indicates that DKK3 added as a cytokine activates activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), leading to the increased binding of ATF6 on the myocardin promoter and increased its expression. In addition, inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) promotes the expression of ATF6 and leads to further increase of myocardin transcription. Our findings offer a novel mechanism by which DKK3 regulates ESC-SMC differentiation by activating ATF6 and promoting myocardin expression."

Notably, p38 MAPK activation has been implicated in PPARγ signaling. Here, rosiglitazone (RGZ) activation of GPR40 and p38 MAPK was found to boost PPARγ-induced gene transcription in human endothelium. Inhibition or knockdown of p38 MAPK or expression of a dominant negative (DN) p38 MAPK mutant blunted RGZ-induced PPARγ DNA binding and reporter activity in EA.hy926 human endothelial cells. GPR40 inhibition or knockdown, or expression of a DN-Gαq mutant likewise blocked activation of both p38 MAPK and PPARγ reporters. Importantly, RGZ induction of PPARγ target genes in primary human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (PAECs) was suppressed by knockdown of either p38 MAPK or GPR40. GPR40/PPARγ signal transduction was dependent on p38 MAPK activation and induction of PPARγ co-activator-1 (PGC1α).

https://openalex.org/W2220187734,"Skull structure is intimately associated with feeding ability in vertebrates, both in terms of specific performance measures and general ecological characteristics. This study quantitatively assessed variation in the shape of the cranium and mandible in varanoid lizards, and its relationship to structural performance (von Mises strain) and interspecific differences in feeding ecology. Geometric morphometric and linear morphometric analyses were used to evaluate morphological differences, and finite element analysis was used to quantify variation in structural performance (strain during simulated biting, shaking and pulling). This data was then integrated with ecological classes compiled from relevant scientific literature on each species in order to establish structure-function relationships. Finite element modelling results showed that variation in cranial morphology resulted in large differences in the magnitudes and locations of strain in biting, shaking and pulling load cases. Gracile species such as Varanus salvadorii displayed high strain levels during shaking, especially in the areas between the orbits. All models exhibit less strain during pull back loading compared to shake loading, even though a larger force was applied (pull =30N, shake = 20N). Relationships were identified between the morphology, performance, and ecology. Species that did not feed on hard prey clustered in the gracile region of cranial morphospace and exhibited significantly higher levels of strain during biting (P = 0.0106). Species that fed on large prey clustered in the elongate area of mandible morphospace. This relationship differs from those that have been identified in other taxonomic groups such as crocodiles and mammals. This difference may be due to a combination of the open 'space-frame' structure of the varanoid lizard skull, and the 'pull back' behaviour that some species use for processing large prey."
https://openalex.org/W830839854,"Background Several groups of stem cryptodires became adapted to coastal marine environments as early as the Late Jurassic, 40 million years before the Pan-Chelonioidea. The Plesiochelyidae are a major component of this first radiation of crown-group turtles into marine habitats. They are abundant in many European localities, but their systematics is still greatly confused. Only three species are represented by cranial material: Plesiochelys etalloni, Plesiochelys planiceps, and Portlandemys mcdowelli. Methodology/Principal Findings In the present study, we describe a cranium and a mandible from the Kimmeridgian of Porrentruy (Switzerland), which we refer to a new species, Portlandemys gracilis n. sp. This new taxon differs from Portlandemys mcdowelli in several aspects of the cranium and mandible, notably in being generally more gracile, but the two species share a narrow skull, a more acute angle between the labial ridges on the mandible, and a unique configuration of the anterodorsal part of the basicranium. The cranial anatomy of plesiochelyid turtles is discussed in details based primarily on these new specimens and new cranial material of Plesiochelys etalloni from Solothurn, Switzerland. Conclusions/Significance Several characters (e.g., the contribution of the parietal to the foramen nervi trigemini, the configuration of the dorsum sellae and sella turcica, the presence of an infolding ridge on the posterior surface of the quadrate) appear as potential candidates to help elucidate plesiochelyid relationships. Some of these characters are included in a previously published phylogenetic dataset and help to stabilize the relationships of plesiochelyid turtles and closely related taxa. For the first time, our results suggest that plesiochelyids, 'Thalassemys' moseri, and Solnhofia parsonsi (representing the Eurysternidae) form a clade at the base of Eucryptodira."
https://openalex.org/W1949892035,"Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is a member of the human Herpesvirus family that causes varicella (chicken pox) and zoster (shingles). VZV latently infects sensory ganglia and is also responsible for encephalomyelitis. Myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), a member of the sialic acid (SA)-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin family, is mainly expressed in neural tissues. VZV glycoprotein B (gB) associates with MAG and mediates membrane fusion during VZV entry into host cells. The SA requirements of MAG when associating with its ligands vary depending on the specific ligand, but it is unclear whether the SAs on gB are involved in the association with MAG. In this study, we found that SAs on gB are essential for the association with MAG as well as for membrane fusion during VZV infection. MAG with a point mutation in the SA-binding site did not bind to gB and did not mediate cell-cell fusion or VZV entry. Cell-cell fusion and VZV entry mediated by the gB-MAG interaction were blocked by sialidase treatment. N-glycosylation or O-glycosylation inhibitors also inhibited the fusion and entry mediated by gB-MAG interaction. Furthermore, gB with mutations in N-glycosylation sites, i.e. asparagine residues 557 and 686, did not associate with MAG, and the cell-cell fusion efficiency was low. Fusion between the viral envelope and cellular membrane is essential for host cell entry by herpesviruses. Therefore, these results suggest that SAs on gB play important roles in MAG-mediated VZV infection."
https://openalex.org/W1922299293,"To conserve a declining species we first need to diagnose the causes of decline. This is one of the most challenging tasks faced by conservation practitioners. In this study, we used temporally explicit species distribution models (SDMs) to test whether shifting weather can explain the recent decline of a marsupial carnivore, the eastern quoll (Dasyurus viverrinus). We developed an SDM using weather variables matched to occurrence records of the eastern quoll over the last 60 years, and used the model to reconstruct variation through time in the distribution of climatically suitable range for the species. The weather model produced a meaningful prediction of the known distribution of the species. Abundance of quolls, indexed by transect counts, was positively related to the modelled area of suitable habitat between 1990 and 2004. In particular, a sharp decline in abundance from 2001 to 2003 coincided with a sustained period of unsuitable weather over much of the species' distribution. Since 2004, abundance has not recovered despite a return to suitable weather conditions, and abundance and area of suitable habitat have been uncorrelated. We suggest that fluctuations in weather account for the species' recent decline, but other unrelated factors have suppressed recovery."
https://openalex.org/W1565471019,"Background The naked mole-rat (NMR) is a long-lived and cancer resistant species. Identification of potential anti-cancer and age related mechanisms is of great interest and makes this species eminent to investigate anti-cancer strategies and understand aging mechanisms. Since it is known that the NMR expresses higher liver mRNA-levels of alpha 2-macroglobulin than mice, nothing is known about its structure, functionality or expression level in the NMR compared to the human A2M. Results Here we show a comprehensive analysis of NMR- and human plasma-A2M, showing a different prediction in glycosylation of NMR-A2M, which results in a higher molecular weight compared to human A2M. Additionally, we found a higher concentration of A2M (8.3±0.44 mg/mL vs. and 4.4±0.20 mg/mL) and a lower total plasma protein content (38.7±1.79 mg/mL vs. 61.7±3.20 mg/mL) in NMR compared to human. NMR-A2M can be transformed by methylamine and trypsin resulting in a conformational change similar to human A2M. NMR-A2M is detectable by a polyclonal antibody against human A2M. Determination of tryptic and anti-tryptic activity of NMR and human plasma revealed a higher anti-tryptic activity of the NMR plasma. On the other hand, less proteolytic activity was found in NMR plasma compared to human plasma. Conclusion We found transformed NMR-A2M binding to its specific receptor LRP1. We could demonstrate lower protein expression of LRP1 in the NMR liver tissue compared to human but higher expression of A2M. This was accompanied by a higher EpCAM protein expression as central adhesion molecule in cancer progression. NMR-plasma was capable to increase the adhesion in human fibroblast in vitro most probably by increasing CD29 protein expression. This is the first report, demonstrating similarities as well as distinct differences between A2M in NMR and human plasma. This might be directly linked to the intriguing phenotype of the NMR and suggests that A2M might probably play an important role in anti-cancer and the anti-aging mechanisms in the NMR."
https://openalex.org/W2336583320,"Sustainable forest management is based on functional relationships between management actions, landscape conditions, and forest values. Changes in management practices make it fundamentally more difficult to study these relationships because the impacts of current practices are difficult to disentangle from the persistent influences of past practices. Within the Atlantic Northern Forest of Maine, U.S.A., forest policy and management practices changed abruptly in the early 1990s. During the 1970s-1980s, a severe insect outbreak stimulated salvage clearcutting of large contiguous tracts of spruce-fir forest. Following clearcut regulation in 1991, management practices shifted abruptly to near complete dependence on partial harvesting. Using a time series of Landsat satellite imagery (1973-2010) we assessed cumulative landscape change caused by these very different management regimes. We modeled predominant temporal patterns of harvesting and segmented a large study area into groups of landscape units with similar harvest histories. Time series of landscape composition and configuration metrics averaged within groups revealed differences in landscape dynamics caused by differences in management history. In some groups (24% of landscape units), salvage caused rapid loss and subdivision of intact mature forest. Persistent landscape change was created by large salvage clearcuts (often averaging > 100 ha) and conversion of spruce-fir to deciduous and mixed forest. In groups that were little affected by salvage (56% of landscape units), contemporary partial harvesting caused loss and subdivision of intact mature forest at even greater rates. Patch shape complexity and edge density reached high levels even where cumulative harvest area was relatively low. Contemporary practices introduced more numerous and much smaller patches of stand-replacing disturbance (typically averaging <15 ha) and a correspondingly large amount of edge. Management regimes impacted different areas to different degrees, producing different trajectories of landscape change that should be recognized when studying the impact of policy and management practices on forest ecology."
https://openalex.org/W2203067890,"Procedural models are widely used in computer graphics for generating realistic, natural-looking textures. However, these mathematical models are not perceptually meaningful, whereas the users, such as artists and designers, would prefer to make descriptions using intuitive and perceptual characteristics like ""repetitive,"" ""directional,"" ""structured,"" and so on. To make up for this gap, we investigated the perceptual dimensions of textures generated by a collection of procedural models. Two psychophysical experiments were conducted: free-grouping and rating. We applied Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to discover the perceptual features used by the observers in grouping similar textures. The results suggested that existing dimensions in literature cannot accommodate random textures. We therefore utilized isometric feature mapping (Isomap) to establish a three-dimensional perceptual texture space which better explains the features used by humans in texture similarity judgment. Finally, we proposed computational models to map perceptual features to the perceptual texture space, which can suggest a procedural model to produce textures according to user-defined perceptual scales."
https://openalex.org/W2140485174,"Arrestins have been shown to regulate numerous G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in studies employing receptor/arrestin overexpression in artificial cell systems. Which arrestin isoforms regulate which GPCRs in primary cell types is poorly understood. We sought to determine the effect of β-arrestin-1 or β-arrestin-2 inhibition or gene ablation on signaling and function of multiple GPCRs endogenously expressed in airway smooth muscle (ASM). In vitro [second messenger (calcium, cAMP generation)], ex vivo (ASM tension generation in suspended airway), and in vivo (invasive airway resistance) analyses were performed on human ASM cells and murine airways/whole animal subject to β-arrestin-1 or -2 knockdown or knockout (KO). In both human and murine model systems, knockdown or KO of β-arrestin-2 relative to control missense small interfering RNA or wild-type mice selectively increased (40-60%) β2-adrenoceptor signaling and function. β-arrestin-1 knockdown or KO had no effect on signaling and function of β2-adrenoceptor or numerous procontractile GPCRs, but selectively inhibited M3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor signaling (∼50%) and function (∼25% ex vivo, >50% in vivo) without affecting EC50 values. Arrestin subtypes differentially regulate ASM GPCRs and β-arrestin-1 inhibition represents a novel approach to managing bronchospasm in obstructive lung diseases."

Method Eight single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs10045431, rs11167764, rs3212227, rs6556412, rs6556416, rs6871626, rs6887695 and rs7709212) in the IL-12B gene were genotyped by iMLDR Assay technology in 400 patients [96% (384/400) HLA-B27(+)] and 395 geographically and ethnically matched healthy controls in mainland Han Chinese population. The correlation between IL-12B genetic polymorphisms and AS activity index (BASDAI, BASFI) were tested. Results The significant difference was found in genotype distribution between AS and healthy controls (χ2 = 6.942, P-value = 0.031) of the SNP rs6871626. Furthermore, significant evidence was also detected under the recessive model for minor allele A. The AA genotype carrier had 1.830 fold risk compared with C allele carrier (with CC and AC genotypes) [OR (95% CI) = 1.830 (1.131-2.961), P-value = 0.014]. Nevertheless, the difference was no longer significant after Bonferroni correction. Subset analysis on cases with HLA-B27(+) did find the same results. Three genotypic groups (AA, CC and CA) in rs6871626 site was highly associated with the BASDAI and BASFI (P-value = 0.012 and P-value = 0.023, respectively), after adjustment for effect of age, sex, and disease duration, the P-value was 0.031 and 0.041, respectively. The AA genotype of rs6871626 was also significantly correlated with an increased BASDAI and BASFI compared to the AC and CC genotypes in AS patients. Conclusion Our findings suggest that rs6871626 may be associated AS susceptibility and with disease activity (BASDAI, BASFI) in mainland Han Chinese population."
https://openalex.org/W1557697745,"To identify, evaluate and synthesise evidence on the effect of kinesiotape applied to the lateral aspect of the ankle, through a systematic review of quantitative studies.A search for quantitative studies was undertaken using key terms of ""kinesiotape"" and ""ankle"" in seven electronic databases, using the maximum date ranges. Databases included: the Cochrane Library, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Medline, Physiotherapy Evidence Database, Scopus, SPORTDiscus and Web of Science.Database hits were evaluated against explicit inclusion criteria. From 107 database hits, 8 quantitative studies were included.Two independent reviewers appraised the methodological rigour of the studies using the McMaster Critical Review Form for Quantitative Studies. Data were extracted on participant characteristics, kinesiotape parameters, comparison interventions, outcome measures and findings.Most studies (n=7) had good to very good methodological rigour. Meta-analysis was not possible due to heterogeneity in participants, interventions and outcome measures. No adverse events were reported. Kinesiotape may produce different effects in healthy and injured ankles. In healthy ankles, kinesiotape may increase postural control, whereas in injured ankles it may improve proprioception, plantarflexor endurance and the performance of activities. These trends were identified from a small body of evidence including 276 participants.It is recommended that kinesiotape may be used in clinical practice to prevent lateral ankle injuries (through its effects on postural control) and manage lateral ankle injuries due to its positive effects on proprioception, muscle endurance and activity performance. It appears that kinesiotape may not provide sufficient mechanical support to improve postural control in unstable ankles. Adverse events associated with kinseiotape are unlikely."
https://openalex.org/W1928842000,"Central Africa's tropical forests are among the world's largest carbon reserves. Historically, they have experienced low rates of deforestation. Pressures to clear land are increasing due to development of infrastructure and livelihoods, foreign investment in agriculture, and shifting land use management, particularly in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The DRC contains the greatest area of intact African forests. These store approximately 22 billion tons of carbon in aboveground live biomass, yet only 10% are protected. Can the status quo of passive protection - forest management that is low or nonexistent - ensure the preservation of this forest and its carbon? We have developed the SimCongo model to simulate changes in land cover and land use based on theorized policy scenarios from 2010 to 2050. Three scenarios were examined: the first (Historical Trends) assumes passive forest protection; the next (Conservation) posits active protection of forests and activation of the national REDD+ action plan, and the last (Agricultural Development) assumes increased agricultural activities in forested land with concomitant increased deforestation. SimCongo is a cellular automata model based on Bayesian statistical methods tailored for the DRC, built with the Dinamica-EGO platform. The model is parameterized and validated with deforestation observations from the past and runs the scenarios from 2010 through 2050 with a yearly time step. We estimate the Historical Trends trajectory will result in average emissions of 139 million t CO2 year-1 by the 2040s, a 15% increase over current emissions. The Conservation scenario would result in 58% less clearing than Historical Trends and would conserve carbon-dense forest and woodland savanna areas. The Agricultural Development scenario leads to emissions of 212 million t CO2 year-1 by the 2040s. These scenarios are heuristic examples of policy's influence on forest conservation and carbon storage. Our results suggest that 1) passive protection of the DRC's forest and woodland savanna is insufficient to reduce deforestation; and 2): enactment of a REDD+ plan or similar conservation measure is needed to actively protect Congo forests, their unique ecology, and their important role in the global carbon cycle."

https://openalex.org/W2192152675,"To further our understanding of the association between self-reported childhood learning disabilities (LDs) and atypical dementia phenotypes (Atypical Dementia), including logopenic primary progressive aphasia (L-PPA), Posterior Cortical Atrophy (PCA), and Dysexecutive-type Alzheimer's Disease (AD).This retrospective case series analysis of 678 comprehensive neuropsychological assessments compared rates of self-reported LD between dementia patients diagnosed with Typical AD and those diagnosed with Atypical Dementia. 105 cases with neuroimaging or CSF data available and at least one neurology follow-up were identified as having been diagnosed by the neuropsychologist with any form of neurodegenerative dementia. These cases were subject to a consensus diagnostic process among three dementia experts using validated clinical criteria for AD and PPA. LD was considered Probable if two or more statements consistent with prior LD were documented within the Social & Developmental History of the initial neuropsychological evaluation.85 subjects (Typical AD n=68, Atypical AD n=17) were included in the final analysis. In logistic regression models adjusted for age, gender, handedness, education and symptom duration, patients with Probable LD, compared to patients without Probable LD, were significantly more likely to be diagnosed with Atypical Dementia vs. Typical AD (OR 13.1, 95% CI 1.3-128.4). All three of the L-PPA cases reporting a childhood LD endorsed childhood difficulty with language. By contrast, both PCA cases reporting Probable childhood LD endorsed difficulty with attention and/or math.In people who develop dementia, childhood LD may predispose to atypical phenotypes. Future studies are required to confirm whether atypical neurodevelopment predisposes to regional-specific neuropathology in AD and other dementias."

https://openalex.org/W2127924511,"Background Insulin-like growth factor binding protein (IGFBP)-5 levels are increased in systemic sclerosis (SSc) skin and lung. We previously reported that IGFBP-5 is a pro-fibrotic factor that induces extracellular matrix (ECM) production and deposition. Since IGFBP-5 contains a nuclear localization signal (NLS) that facilitates its nuclear translocation, we sought to examine the role of nuclear translocation on the fibrotic activity of IGFBP-5 and identify IGFBP-5 binding partners relevant for its nuclear compartmentalization. Methods We generated functional wild type IGFBP-5 and IGFBP-5 with a mutated NLS or a mutated IGF binding site. Abrogation of nuclear translocation in the NLS mutant was confirmed using immunofluorescence and immunoblotting of nuclear and cytoplasmic cellular extracts. Abrogation of IGF binding was confirmed using western ligand blot. The fibrotic activity of wild type and mutant IGFBP-5 was examined in vitro in primary human fibroblasts and ex vivo in human skin. We identified IGFBP-5 binding partners using immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry. We examined the effect of nucleolin on IGFBP-5 localization and function via sequence-specific silencing in primary human fibroblasts. Results Our results show that IGFBP-5-induced ECM production in vitro in primary human fibroblasts is independent of its nuclear translocation. The NLS-mutant also induced fibrosis ex vivo in human skin, thus confirming and extending the in vitro findings. Similar findings were obtained with the IGF-binding mutant. Nucleolin, a nucleolar protein that can serve as a nuclear receptor, was identified as an IGFBP-5 binding partner. Silencing nucleolin reduced IGFBP-5 translocation to the nucleus but did not block the ability of IGFBP-5 to induce ECM production and a fibrotic phenotype. Conclusions IGFBP-5 transport to the nucleus requires an intact NLS and nucleolin. However, nuclear translocation is not necessary for IGFBP-5 fibrotic activity; neither is IGF binding. Our data provide further insights into the role of cellular compartmentalization in IGFBP-5-induced fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W2147918848,"Alpha-2-macroglobulin is an abundant secreted protein that is of particular interest because of its diverse ligand binding profile and multifunctional nature, which includes roles as a protease inhibitor and as a molecular chaperone. The activities of alpha-2-macroglobulin are typically dependent on whether its conformation is native or transformed (i.e. adopts a more compact conformation after interactions with proteases or small nucleophiles), and are also influenced by dissociation of the native alpha-2-macroglobulin tetramer into stable dimers. Alpha-2-macroglobulin is predominately present as the native tetramer in vivo; once purified from human blood plasma, however, alpha-2-macroglobulin can undergo a number of conformational changes during storage, including transformation, aggregation or dissociation. We demonstrate that, particularly in the presence of sodium chloride or amine containing compounds, freezing and/or lyophilization of alpha-2-macroglobulin induces conformational changes with functional consequences. These conformational changes in alpha-2-macroglobulin are not always detected by standard native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, but can be measured using bisANS fluorescence assays. Increased surface hydrophobicity of alpha-2-macroglobulin, as assessed by bisANS fluorescence measurements, is accompanied by (i) reduced trypsin binding activity, (ii) increased chaperone activity, and (iii) increased binding to the surfaces of SH-SY5Y neurons, in part, via lipoprotein receptors. We show that sucrose (but not glycine) effectively protects native alpha-2-macroglobulin from denaturation during freezing and/or lyophilization, thereby providing a reproducible method for the handling and long-term storage of this protein."
https://openalex.org/W1509012337,"Among the properties that are common to complex systems, the presence of critical thresholds in the dynamics of the system is one of the most important. Recently, there has been interest in the universalities that occur in the behavior of systems near critical points. These universal properties make it possible to estimate how far a system is from a critical threshold. Several early-warning signals have been reported in time series representing systems near catastrophic shifts. The proper understanding of these early-warnings may allow the prediction and perhaps control of these dramatic shifts in a wide variety of systems. In this paper we analyze this universal behavior for a system that is a paradigm of phase transitions, the Ising model. We study the behavior of the early-warning signals and the way the temporal correlations of the system increase when the system is near the critical point."

Method Osteopathic education providers of full-time education located in Europe were enrolled, and their final year students were contacted to complete a survey. Measures used were: Dundee Ready Educational Environment Measure (DREEM), the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) and a demographic questionnaire. Scores were compared across institutions using one-way ANOVA and generalised linear model. Results Nine European osteopathic education institutions participated in the study (4 located in Italy, 2 in the UK, 1 in France, 1 in Belgium and 1 in the Netherlands) and 243 (77%) of their final-year students completed the survey. The DREEM total score mean was 121.4 (SEM: 1.66) whilst the AAMC was 17.58 (SEM:0.35). A generalised linear model found a significant association between not-regulated countries and total score as well as subscales DREEM scores (p<0.001). Learning environment and preparedness to practice were significantly positively correlated (r=0.76; p<0.01). Discussion A perceived higher level of preparedness and satisfaction was found amongst students from osteopathic institutions located in countries without regulation compared to those located in countries where osteopathy is regulated; however, all institutions obtained a ‘more positive than negative’ result. Moreover, in general, cohorts with fewer than 20 students scored significantly higher compared to larger student cohorts. Finally, an overall positive correlation between students’ preparedness and satisfaction were found across all institutions recruited."

Most prior studies concentrated on the relationship between tropical cyclones and injuries and mortality. This study aimed to explore the impacts of different grades of tropical cyclones on infectious diarrhea incidence in Guangdong province, from 2005 to 2011.Mann-Whitney U test was firstly used to examine if infectious diarrhea were sensitive to tropical cyclone. Then unidirectional 1:1 case-crossover design was performed to quantitatively evaluate the relationship between daily number of infectious diarrhea and tropical cyclone from 2005 to 2011 in Guangdong, China. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to eliminate multicollinearity. Multivariate logistic regression model was used to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) and the 95% confidence intervals (CI).There were no significant relationships between tropical cyclone and bacillary dysentery, amebic dysentery, typhoid, and paratyphoid cases. Infectious diarrhea other than cholera, dysentery, typhoid and paratyphoid significantly increased after tropical cyclones. The strongest effect were shown on lag 1 day (HRs = 1.95, 95%CI = 1.22, 3.12) and no lagged effect was detected for tropical depression, tropical storm, severe tropical storm and typhoon, with the largest HRs (95%CI) of 2.16 (95%CI = 1.69, 2.76), 2.43 (95%CI = 1.65, 3.58) and 2.21 (95%CI = 1.65, 2.69), respectively. Among children below 5 years old, the impacts of all grades of tropical cyclones were strongest at lag 0 day. And HRs were 2.67 (95%CI = 1.10, 6.48), 2.49 (95%CI = 1.80, 3.44), 4.89 (95%CI = 2.37, 7.37) and 3.18 (95%CI = 2.10, 4.81), respectively.All grades of tropical cyclones could increase risk of other infectious diarrhea.

UCP overexpression in plants has been correlated with oxidative stress tolerance, improved photosynthetic efficiency and increased mitochondrial biogenesis. This study reports the main transcriptomic responses associated with the overexpression of an UCP (AtUCP1) in tobacco seedlings. Compared to wild-type (WT), AtUCP1 transgenic seedlings showed unaltered ATP levels and higher accumulation of serine. By using RNA-sequencing, a total of 816 differentially expressed genes between the investigated overexpressor lines and the untransformed WT control were identified. Among them, 239 were up-regulated and 577 were down-regulated. As a general response to AtUCP1 overexpression, noticeable changes in the expression of genes involved in energy metabolism and redox homeostasis were detected. A substantial set of differentially expressed genes code for products targeted to the chloroplast and mainly involved in photosynthesis. The overall results demonstrate that the alterations in mitochondrial function provoked by AtUCP1 overexpression require important transcriptomic adjustments to maintain cell homeostasis. Moreover, the occurrence of an important cross-talk between chloroplast and mitochondria, which culminates in the transcriptional regulation of several genes involved in different pathways, was evidenced."

Wistar female rats subjected to severe food restriction since fetal stage and controls were transferred to a moderately high-fat diet (cafeteria) provided at 70 days of life to 6.5 months. Another group of undernourished rats were rehabilitated with chow. The energy intake of undernourished animals transferred to cafeteria formula exceeded that of the controls under this regime and was probably driven by hypothalamic disorders in insulin and leptin signal transduction.

Adverse environmental factors during growth stages can affect vulnerable immature tissues, leading to increased morbidity later in life. Nourishment has a major influence on development. Early diet imbalances such as overnutrition and undernutrition are common worldwide, and their consequences are a major public health concern, given that they are associated with an increased risk of various diseases in adulthood, as shown by data from epidemiological, clinical, and experimental studies (1Koletzko B.

Other historic famines have lead authors to similar conclusions (4de Rooij S.R. Roseboom T.J. Painter R.C. Famines in the last 100 years: implications for diabetes.Curr. Diab. Rep. 2014; 14: 536Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Statistical data suggest a high obesity risk among population groups with the highest rates of past poverty, which usually have experienced previous undernutrition (5Drewnowski A. Specter S.E. Poverty and obesity: the role of energy density and energy costs.Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 2004; 79: 6-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1759) Google Scholar). A correlation between low birth weight and an increased risk of obesity has also been documented among children subjected to poor nutrition who were subsequently integrated into feeding programs or transitioned into affluent conditions (6Misra A. Khurana L. Obesity and the metabolic syndrome in developing countries.J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2008; 93: S9-S30Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar). However, it is an issue still open because some authors have found no association between low birth weight and obesity (7Yu Z.B. Han S.P. Zhu G.Z. Zhu C. Wang X.J. Cao X.G. Guo X.R. Birth weight and subsequent risk of obesity: a systematic review and meta-analysis.Obes. Rev. 2011; 12: 525-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar).

A large number of people, who were poorly nourished as children, are now experiencing a shift toward a Western pattern diet, which is hypercaloric. To investigate whether the harmful effects of these diets are aggravated by a pre-condition of early undernutrition, animal models have been used, generally rodents; however, most experimental studies have used highly fat-enriched formulas, which are obesogenic even without prior undernutrition (12Buettner R. Schölmerich J. Bollheimer L.C. High-fat diets: modeling the metabolic disorders of human obesity in rodents.Obesity. 2007; 15: 798-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). On the other hand, human undernutrition is frequently not limited to the early stages of development but becomes a lasting condition (13Bergeron G. Castleman T. Program responses to acute and chronic malnutrition: divergences and convergences.Adv. Nutr. 2012; 3: 242-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, the metabolic risks associated with long-term undernutrition have not been extensively investigated. We developed a rat model of early, severe, and permanent food restriction and studied the impact on glucose homeostasis in females (14Lizarraga-Mollinedo E. Fernández-Millán E. Martín Jde. T. Martínez-Honduvilla C. Escrivá F. Alvarez C. Early undernutrition induces glucagon resistance and insulin hypersensitivity in the liver of suckling rats.Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol.

Effects of chronic undernutrition on glucose uptake and glucose transporter proteins in rat heart.Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 4295-4303Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The undernourished animals were exposed for 6.5 months to standard chow or to a cafeteria diet containing ∼25% calories from fats, a formula that is less rich in lipids than those usually labeled as high-fat diets. The control group was given a cafeteria diet during the same period. We evaluated the effects of these diets on adiposity distribution, ectopic triglycerides, serum insulin and leptin, hypothalamic responses to these hormones, and whole insulin sensitivity. The aim was to investigate whether precocity and severity of lasting undernutrition facilitates obesity and/or some associated metabolic alterations. Our main results show that undernutrition established a state of hyperphagia with the moderately high-lipid diet, probably driven by hypothalamic insulin and leptin resistance. This diet was slightly obesigenic for the control rats but not for those undernourished, despite the fact that their gain in body fat was proportionally higher than that of the controls. Perhaps, the protection against obesity is associated with a striking increase of UCP-1 observed in visceral and subcutaneous white adipose tissue, indicating a browning of these fat pads. However, these rats had higher triglyceride deposits in the liver and muscle, showing signs of steatosis. Also, the cafeteria formula increased tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) content in visceral fat in the undernourished rats. Finally, both the control and undernourished rats developed insulin resistance when they were subjected to any of the ad libitum diets. Our results favor the view that severe early undernutrition leads to harmful metabolic alterations, although not inducing obesity. All studies were conducted under an approved protocol (BFU 2011-25420) according to the principles and procedures outlined in the Committee for Animal Experimentation of UCM (Madrid, Spain). Wistar rats were bred in our laboratory with controlled conditions of temperature and lighting (light cycle from 0700 to 1900). Females were caged with males, and mating was confirmed by the presence of spermatozoa in vaginal smears. From the 14th day of pregnancy and during suckling, rats were subjected to a pattern of severe undernutrition previously described in detail (16Escrivá F. Rodríguez C. Cacho J. Alvarez C. Portha B. Pascual-Leone A.M. Glucose utilization and insulin action in adult rats submitted to prolonged food restriction.Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: E1-E7PubMed Google Scholar). Control rats were bred in parallel. From weaning to 70 days of life, females of each litter were selected and housed in pairs. Control rats (C) 2The abbreviations used are: CcontrolUundernourishedC70Dcontrol 70 daysU70Dundernourished 70 daysC9mcontrol 9 months given chowC-Caf9mcontrol 9 months given cafeteria dietU9mundernourished 9 months kept on the standard chow restricted to 35%U-Std9mundernourished 9 months switched to lab chowU-Caf9mundernourished 9 months transferred to cafeteria formulaPOMCpro-opiomelanocortinNPYneuropeptide YBMIbody mass indexLBMlean body massGPx-1glutathione peroxidase-1GRsglutathione reductase. were fed a standard rat chow ad libitum. Their food intake was calculated daily by weighing the remaining chow. Undernourished rats (U) were provided every day with 35% of the amount of chow eaten by controls. These groups were studied at 70 days (C70d and U70d). From that age up to 9 months, five groups were established as follows: C was randomly segregated into two groups: C9m, given the chow, and C-Caf9m, transferred to cafeteria diet, both ad libitum. Another three groups were formed from U animals: U9m kept on the standard chow restricted to 35%, U-Std9m switched to lab chow, and U-Caf9m, transferred to cafeteria formula, both supplied ad libitum. Spillage was negligible. All animals had free access to water. 16-h fasting rats were killed by decapitation and trunk blood was collected. Plasma and serum were stored at −80 °C until analyzed. Similarly, adult rats were decapitated and blood was harvested from the trunk. The skull was opened, the brain was removed, and the hypothalami was rapidly dissected and frozen in liquid nitrogen. For immunohistochemical studies the brains were processed differently, as indicated below. On the other hand, pieces of liver, skeletal muscle (quadriceps), and visceral adipose tissue were also collected and placed in liquid nitrogen. All tissue samples were stored at −80 °C until use. control undernourished control 70 days undernourished 70 days control 9 months given chow control 9 months given cafeteria diet undernourished 9 months kept on the standard chow restricted to 35% undernourished 9 months switched to lab chow undernourished 9 months transferred to cafeteria formula pro-opiomelanocortin neuropeptide Y body mass index lean body mass glutathione peroxidase-1 glutathione reductase. Commercial A04 pelleted chow from SAFE (Scientific Animal Food and Engineering, PANLAB, Spain) contains by dry weight: 16% protein, 50% carbohydrate (starch and sucrose), 3% lipid, 4% cellulose, 5% vitamin and mineral mixture, and 12% water, with a caloric density of 2.9 Kcal/g. Cafeteria diet was manually prepared by adding a series of complementary ingredients to the commercial chow. Specifically: 330 g of full-cream milk, 150 g of full-cream milk powder, 100 g of cupcakes, and 90 g of sugar were mixed with 330 g of triturated standard chow, obtaining a homogenate used to prepare pellets, in the same size as the commercial chow, which were stored at 2–4 °C. In terms of macronutrients, this diet corresponded to: 15% protein, 45% starch, 25% sucrose, and 13% lipids, by dry weights. The caloric density was 4.6 Kcal/g, calculated from the caloric equivalences of macronutrients. Serum leptin was measured using a conventional sandwich ELISA (Millipore Corporation). Plasma insulin was determined by RIA, using rat insulin as standard (Linco Research, MO). Serum glucose was analyzed by a glucose oxidase method (BioSystems Reagents and Instruments, Barcelona, Spain). Serum triglycerides and cholesterol were determined colorimetrically by diagnostic kits (BioSystems). Hepatic and muscle lipids were extracted using a method previously described (17Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. A rapid method of total lipid extraction and purification.Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42807) Google Scholar). After purification, the lipids were resuspended in isopropyl alcohol and cholesterol and triglycerides were analyzed as indicated above. Uric acid was assessed in hepatic homogenates by an uricase/peroxidase method (BioSystems). Intracerebroventricular leptin and insulin administrations were performed as previously described (18Fernández-Galaz C. Fernández-Agulló T. Pérez C. Peralta S. Arribas C. Andrés A. Carrascosa J.M. Ros M. Long-term food restriction prevents aging-associated central leptin resistance in Wistar rats.Diabetologia. 2002; 45: 997-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Briefly, rats were anesthetized with i.p. sodium pentobarbital and placed in a stereotaxic frame (David Koppf, Tujunga, CA). An opening in the skull was made with a dental drill. Then rats were injected with leptin (25 mg/kg body weight) (A. F. Parlow National Hormone and Peptide Program, Torrance, CA), insulin (10 IU/kg body weight) (Actrapid, Novo, Copenhagen), or an equal volume of vehicle saline. Fifteen minutes after injections, rats were euthanized by decapitation. The hypothalamus was dissected and frozen in liquid nitrogen. These studies were performed in rats anesthetized with pentobarbital, as detailed previously (19Escriva F. Agote M. Rubio E. Molero J.C. Pascual-Leone A.M. Andres A. Satrustegui J. Carrascosa J.M. In vivo insulin-dependent glucose uptake of specific tissues is decreased during aging of mature Wistar rats.Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Insulin (Actrapid, Novo, Copenhagen) was infused through a saphenous vein at a constant rate (5 IU/h/Kg). 30% glucose was infused through the other saphenous vein at a variable rate. After 30 min of starting the clamp, plasma glucose, and insulin remained constant without further adjusting the infusion rate. At this steady state, the overall glucose utilization reaches a constant value, which was monitored for an additional 30 min. Glucose disposal was determined from the rate of infusion normalized to body weight (mg of glucose/min/kg). Lysates containing 500 μg of proteins were immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C in the presence of 2 μg of anti-insulin receptor β subunit, followed by the addition of protein A-agarose (Roche Diagnostics). After mixing for 2 h the pellets were collected by centrifugation (1000 × g, 20 s) and the supernatants were discarded. Then the pellets were washed and used in Western blot analysis with antiphosphotyrosine. The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 6.5–10% polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were electrotransferred to polyvinylidine difluoride filters (PVDF), then blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk or 3% bovine serum albumin (for antiphosphotyrosine antibody) and incubated with primary antibody. Protein bands were visualized using ECL Western blotting detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). The following antibodies were purchased: anti-IRS-1, anti-IRS-2, anti-PTP1B, anti-JAK2, and anti-phospho-JAK2 (Chemicon/Millipore, Temecula, CA); anti-insulin receptor β subunit and antiphosphotyrosine (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY); anti-phospho-GSK3 α/β, anti-Akt, anti-phospho-Akt, anti-STAT3, anti-phospho STAT3, and anti-SOCS3 (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA); anti-GSK3 α/β, anti-POMC, anti-ObRb, anti-phospho-ObRb, anti-TNF-α, and antiphosphoinsulin receptor (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); and anti-β-actin (Sigma). β-Actin was used as loading control. Total RNA was isolated using the TRIzol Reagent Kit (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions and reverse transcribed by a High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit (Applied Biosystems). For quantitative PCR analysis, mRNA expressions were determined using TaqMan gene expression assays (Applied Biosystems), for Rps18s (Rn01428913_gH), pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) (Rn00595020_m1), neuropeptide Y (NPY) (Rn01410145_m1), glutathione peroxidase-1 (Rn00577994_g1), glutathione reductase (Rn01482159_m1), MCP-1 (Rn0058055_m1), and UCP-1 (Rn00562126_m1). The ΔΔCt method was used to calculate the relative expression levels of mRNA between experimental conditions and control groups using Rps18s as the internal control (20Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Analysis of relative gene expression data using real-time quantitative PCR and the 2 (−[Delta][Delta] CT) method.Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (124206) Google Scholar). Body fat was measured using a Bruker BioSpin (BioSpec: 47/40, Ettlingen, Germany) at Research Assisting Centre of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (UCM, Madrid). Rats were anesthetized using isoflurane for the duration of the study. All images were acquired as longitudinal slices individually assessed using Image J Launcher 1.46r software. This analysis provides a direct measure of the total volume of adipose pads in every animal. From magnetic resonance images, it is possible to differentiate well between visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissues. Fat masses were calculated assuming density as 0.9 g/ml and equal tissue-hydration degree in all subjects and in the two fat depots (21Thomas E.L. Bell J.D. Influence of undersampling on magnetic resonance imaging measurements of intra-abdominal adipose tissue.Int. J. Obes. Relat. Metab. Disord. 2003; 27: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The body mass index (BMI) was calculated from body weight and the body length (nose-to-anus length) using the formula: BMI = body weight (Kg)/lenght2 (m2). Lean body mass (LBM) was estimated by subtracting the fat from body weight. All data are reported as mean ± S.E. The difference between two mean values is assessed with t test. For multiple comparisons, significance was evaluated by analysis of variance, followed by the protected least significance test. To evaluate to what extent early undernutrition induced overfeeding when food was available ad libitum, we measured the mean cumulative weekly calorie intakes during the period from 2.5 to 9 months of life, results are shown in Fig. 1a. We found no major differences between control groups, regardless of the type of diet. As expected, calorie intakes of undernourished rats increased when they were switched to standard chow but remained below control values. In contrast, calorie intakes of these restricted animals were greatly above all other groups after its transfer to cafeteria diet. To determine whether ad libitum diets were able to achieve the recovery of restricted rats we evaluated several anthropometric parameters. As shown in Table 1, undernourished 70-day-old rats weighed nearly 50% less than controls and their length was reduced by 20%. Both parameters remained under control values in the permanently restricted rats at 9 months of age. Rats fed with cafeteria diet weighed more than their matched lab chow animals. The percent of weight gained after exposure to this diet was much higher in the restricted rats than in controls: 138% (U-Caf9m) and 44% (C-Caf9m). The percentage of weight gained by U-Std9m rats was 113%, also much higher than that of controls (C9m, 29%). Between 70 days and 9 months body length was enhanced by 20% in control rats, regardless of the type of diet. During this period, the length increased by 30% in the permanently food-restricted rats (U9m), by 40% in those refed with the lab chow (U-Std9m), and by 48% in those transferred to cafeteria diet (U-Caf9m), whose final length was equivalent to controls. Abdominal and thoracic diameters of 9-month-old control rats on the cafeteria diet were about 10% higher than those of rats on chow. No significant differences in these parameters were observed between U9m and U-Std9m animals. However, the cafeteria diet induced a 26% increase in the abdominal diameter of restricted rats, thus matching the control value. There were no differences in the BMI between the two groups of 70-day-old animals. This parameter remained unchanged until 9 months in the controls fed the standard chow and increased in those transferred to the cafeteria diet. BMI underwent with age a nearly 25% drop in undernourished rats, which did not happen if they were transferred to lab chow or cafeteria formula. The LBM increased between 70 days and 9 months in control rats: 32% under chow and 46% under the cafeteria diet. It was lower in undernourished but increased by 50% over this period, despite maintaining food restriction. Importantly, the LBM increase markedly in U rats transferred to ad libitum regimes: 140 and 123% with cafeteria diet and lab chow, respectively. This parameter was normalized in both cases.TABLE 1Anthropometric characteristics and serum profiles of different groups of rats70 days9 months70 days9 monthsC70dC9mC-Caf9mU70dU9mU-Std9mU-Caf9mBody weight (g)188 ± 2a243 ± 5b271 ± 5c97 ± 4d143 ± 4e207 ± 6f231 ± 7bLength nose-anus (cm)19.6 ± 0.2a23.5 ± 0.3b23.6 ± 0.2b15.7 ± 0.2c20.6 ± 0.2d21.9 ± 0.4e23.2 ± 0.2bAbdominal diameter (cm)70.4 ± 1.6a70.8 ± 2.9a80.0 ± 1.7b38.0 ± 1.0c56.9 ± 1.4d53 ± 0.4e71.9 ± 1.8aToracic diameter (mm)35.8 ± 1.3a34.3 ± 0.7a37.3 ± 0.3b19.4 ± 0.7c33.2 ± 0.6a36.5 ± 0.4a35.3 ± 0.5aBMI (kg/m2)4.5 ± 0.1a4.4 ± 0.1a4.9 ± 0.1b4.7 ± 0.2a3.4 ± 0.2c4.5 ± 0.1a4.3 ± 0.1aLBM (g)161 ± 3a212 ± 4b235 ± 6c87 ± 4d131 ± 6e194 ± 5b210 ± 7bSerum glucose (mg/100 of ml)80 ± 3a89 ± 6a95 ± 3a81 ± 3a81 ± 8a93 ± 8a81 ± 3aSerum insulin (ng/ml)2.0 ± 0.3a2.8 ± 0.6a2.0 ± 0.6a0.5 ± 0.1b2.2 ± 0.4a0.8 ± 0.1b,c0.9 ± 0.1cSerum triglycerides (mg/100 of ml)45 ± 4a50 ± 4a53 ± 2a30 ± 2b34 ± 4b33 ± 2b59 ± 2cSerum cholesterol (mg/100 of ml)62 ± 2a63 ± 3a62 ± 3a71 ± 3b56 ± 5a72 ± 6b,c78 ± 2c Open table in a new tab We wanted to know if undernutrition following overfeeding entailed changes in the levels of some blood metabolites and hormones. There were no significant differences in glycemia of different groups (Table 1). Serum levels of triglycerides and cholesterol were unaffected, or less affected, by age or type of diet in control rats (Table 1). Triglycerides were decreased and cholesterol increased in 70-day-old restricted rats, compared with controls. At 9 months, cholesterol was increased in those animals that, after undernutrition, were transferred to chow or cafeteria diet. Concerning triglycerides, they were markedly increased in undernourished animals rehabilitated with the cafeteria formula. Serum insulin was markedly reduced in 70-day-old restricted rats but increased at 9 months to reach the values of age-matched controls. At that UCaf9m and UStd9m had higher insulinemia than U70d animals, although lower than U9m and all control groups (Table 1). Serum leptin was analyzed at different stages during suckling (Fig. 1b). At 1 day of life we found similar levels in control and restricted pups. It was followed by an equivalent rise at 5 days. Leptin continued to increase transiently in controls, reaching a peak at 10 days, contrasting with the profile of the restricted pups at 10 and 14 days, when leptinemia was extremely low as compared with controls. At weaning there were similar low levels in both populations. It is still a matter of discussion whether overfeeding after early growth retardation increases the risk of obesity. To provide information regarding this issue in a condition of severe retardation, we evaluated by NMR the amount of white adipose tissue. The whole body fat mass was about 3-fold lower in 70-day-old undernourished rats than in controls: 5.9 ± 0.5 versus 17.0 ± 2.0 g (p < 0.001), due to marked reductions in both visceral and subcutaneous fat depots (Fig. 2a). When rats were maintained until 9 months on standard chow provided either limitedly (U9m) or ad libitum (C9m, U-Std9m), the total fat mass increased. It was the same in control animals subjected to cafeteria diet (C-Caf9m) but they accumulated more fat mass. Two remarkable results were the following: (a) undernourished rats transferred to a high-lipid diet experienced the largest relative increase considering the previous content: 3.5- versus 2.3-fold in controls and (b) total fat measured in rats rehabilitated with lab chow was similar to that present in the permanently restricted animals. With the cafeteria formula, the increment in specific visceral fat was much higher in relative terms in undernourished than in control rats: 6- (U-Caf9m) versus 2-fold (C-Caf9m). In undernourished rats rehabilitated with the standard chow (U-Std9m) the increase in this parameter was ∼4-fold, also higher than in controls (Fig. 2a). Regarding subcutaneous fat, we found an increase between 70 days and 9 months in control rats, higher in the group under the cafeteria formula. An age-related increase of this fat pad was also found in the restricted group, but more pronounced (Fig. 2a). Fat accumulated per unit of LBM remained unchanged with age in control rats, but increased by 50% under the cafeteria diet (C-Caf9m). This ratio was lower in 70-day-old food-restricted rats but increased with age despite maintaining restriction. This parameter did not increase when these animals were transferred to lab chow ad libitum but was notably increased (by 64%) when they were rehabilitated with cafeteria formula (Fig. 2b). The amounts of each specific adipose depot relative to total fat content are shown in Fig. 2b. These proportions experienced no significant changes in the control groups. At 70 days and, especially, 9 months the proportions of visceral fat were lower in restricted rats than in controls, but they underwent marked increases after rehabilitation, irrespective of the type of diet. Conversely, the subcutaneous fat relative to total fat was significantly elevated in undernourished animals of both ages and decreased to control values with nutritional rehabilitations. The increase of triglycerides within cells of non-adipose tissues induces a lo"
https://openalex.org/W2187670248,"This study tests the hypothesis that high levels of high-frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV) predisposes individuals to affiliate with new groups. Resting cardiac physiological recordings were taken before and after experimental sessions to measure trait high-frequency heart rate variability as an index of dispositional autonomic influence on heart rate. Following an experimental manipulation of priming of caring-related words, participants engaged in a minimal group paradigm, in which they imagined being a member of one of two arbitrary groups, allocated money to members of the two groups, and rated their affiliation with the groups. High levels of HF-HRV were associated with ingroup favouritism while allocating money, an effect largely attributable to a positive relationship between HF-HRV and allocation of money to the ingroup, and less due to a negative relationship between HF-HRV and money allocation to the outgroup. HF-HRV was also associated with increased self-reported affiliation feelings for the ingroup but was unrelated to feelings towards the outgroup. These effects remained substantial even after controlling for age, gender, BMI, mood, caffeine consumption, time of day of data collection, smoking and alcohol behaviour, and respiration rate. Further, the effects were observed regardless of whether participants were primed with caring-related words or not. This study is the first to bridge a long history of research on ingroup favouritism to the relatively recent body of research on cardiac vagal tone by uncovering a positive association between HF-HRV and affiliation with a novel group."
https://openalex.org/W2340947570,"Eggshell mechanical property traits such as eggshell breaking strength (ESS), eggshell thickness (EST) and eggshell weight (ESW) are most common and important indexes to evaluate eggshell quality in poultry industry. Uterine ion transporters involve in eggshell formation and might be associated with eggshell mechanical property traits. In this study, 99 SNPs in 15 ion transport genes were selected to genotype 976 pedigreed hens of Rhode Island Red. ESS, EST and ESW were measured for each bird at 55 weeks of age. The association study showed that 14 SNPs in 8 genes were significantly related (p < 0.05) with at least one trait, and their contributions to phenotypic variance ranged from 0.23% to 4.14%. Both ATP2A3 and SLC4A5 had a significant effect on all the three traits. Strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) was detected among SNPs in four genes: ATP2A3, ITPR1, SLC8A3, SCNN1a. The significant effects of those diplotypes on eggshell mechanical property traits were found, and their contributions to phenotypic variance ranged from 0.50% to 0.70%. It was concluded that the identified SNPs and diplotypes in this study were potential markers influencing the eggshell mechanical properties, which could contribute to the genetic improvement of eggshell quality."
https://openalex.org/W808924717,"Transforming growth factor β1 (TGF- β1) is a cytokine that participates in a broad range of cellular regulatory processes and is associated with various diseases including aortic aneurysm. Increased TGF- β1 levels are associated with Marfan syndrome (MFS) caused by FBN1 mutations and subsequent defects in signaling system. We studied TGF- β1 levels in 62 patients with sporadic, non syndromic, dilatative pathology of ascending aorta (DPAA) and in reference group subjects (n = 212). An initial screening of 212 reference individuals identified TGF- β1 gender discrepancies and age-dependent cytokine increase in women. Patients with DPAA had increased levels of TGF- β1 in comparison to reference group subjects (median 7.7 ng/ml, range 2.1-25.3, and median 6.2 ng/ml, range 1.0-33.1, respectively). There is a significant association between TGF-β1 concentration and DPAA (OR 1.084, CI 1.027-1.144, p = 0.004) but the mechanisms of cause and effect have not been established yet. Slightly increased TGF-β1 concentrations in patients with sporadic DPAA in comparison to the reference subjects show a potential use of TGF-β1 as a biomarker for the disease. However, cytokine dependence on age, gender, and other unknown factors among individuals with no cardiovascular complains reduces its specificity for DPAA. We would also like to raise awareness regarding the choice of methods when measuring TGF-β1 levels with an emphasis on preanalytical phase and the choice of sample."

In this paper, we discussed the applicability of magnetic microparticles-assisted time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay (MMPs-TRFIA) for sensitive determination of potential analytes. Hepatitis B e antigen, antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen and free triiodothyronine were used as biomarker models to explore the reliability of the method. By coupling with bioprobes, MMPs were used as immunoassay carriers to capture target molecules. Under optimal condition, assay performance, including accuracy, precision and specificity, was outstanding and demonstrated satisfactory. To further evaluate the performance of the MMPs-TRFIA in patients, a total of 728 serum samples from hospital were analyzed for three biomarkers in parallel with the proposed method and chemiluminescence immunoassay kit commercially available. Fairly good agreements are obtained between the two methods via data analysis. Not only that but the reliability of MMPs-TRFIA has also been illustrated by three different reaction models. It is confirmed that the novel method modified with MMPs has been established and showed great potential applications in both biological detection and clinical diagnosis, including big molecule protein and low molecular weight haptens."

https://openalex.org/W760502550,"While Pneumocystis pneumonia (PcP) still impacts the AIDS patients, it has a growing importance in immunosuppressed HIV-negative patients. To determine the anti-Pneumocystis therapeutic efficacy of new compounds, animal and in vitro models have been developed. Indeed, well-designed mouse or rat experimental models of pneumocystosis can be used to describe the in vivo anti-Pneumocystis activity of new drugs. In vitro models, which enable the screening of a large panel of new molecules, have been developed using axenic cultures or co-culture with feeder cells; but no universally accepted standard method is currently available to evaluate anti-Pneumocystis molecules in vitro. Thus, we chose to explore the use of the SYTO-13 dye, as a new indicator of Pneumocystis viability. In the present work, we established the experimental conditions to define the in vitro pharmacodynamic parameters (EC50, Emax) of marketed compounds (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, pentamidine, atovaquone) in order to specifically measure the intrinsic activity of these anti-P. carinii molecules using the SYTO-13 dye for the first time. Co-labelling the fungal organisms with anti-P. carinii specific antibodies enabled the measurement of viability of Pneumocystis organisms while excluding host debris from the analysis. Moreover, contrary to microscopic observation, large numbers of fungal cells can be analyzed by flow cytometry, thus increasing statistical significance and avoiding misreading during fastidious quantitation of stained organisms. In conclusion, the SYTO-13 dye allowed us to show a reproducible dose/effect relationship for the tested anti-Pneumocystis drugs."
