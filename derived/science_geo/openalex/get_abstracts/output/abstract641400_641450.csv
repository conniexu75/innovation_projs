With no vaccine or effective treatment, infections often require large-scale culling of pigs. Wang et al. apply cutting-edge cryo–electron microscopy techniques to determine the structure of this very large DNA virus. An 8.8-angstrom-resolution reconstruction shows the five layers of the virus, and the fourth capsid layer could be reconstructed at 4.8-angstrom resolution. The structure reveals epitopes in the major capsid protein that distinguish ASFV from other nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses and shows how the minor capsid proteins stabilize the capsid.

https://openalex.org/W2980594093,"This study validates automated emotion and action unit (AU) coding applying FaceReader 7 to a dataset of standardized facial expressions of six basic emotions (Standardized and Motivated Facial Expressions of Emotion). Percentages of correctly and falsely classified expressions are reported. The validity of coding AUs is provided by correlations between the automated analysis and manual Facial Action Coding System (FACS) scoring for 20 AUs. On average 80% of the emotional facial expressions are correctly classified. The overall validity of coding AUs is moderate with the highest validity indicators for AUs 1, 5, 9, 17 and 27. These results are compared to the performance of FaceReader 6 in previous research, with our results yielding comparable validity coefficients. Practical implications and limitations of the automated method are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2981304003,"We present histological and molecular analyses of the developing human cerebellum from 30 days after conception to 9 months after birth. Differences in developmental patterns between humans and mice include spatiotemporal expansion of both ventricular and rhombic lip primary progenitor zones to include subventricular zones containing basal progenitors. The human rhombic lip persists longer through cerebellar development than in the mouse and undergoes morphological changes to form a progenitor pool in the posterior lobule, which is not seen in other organisms, not even in the nonhuman primate the macaque. Disruptions in human rhombic lip development are associated with posterior cerebellar vermis hypoplasia and Dandy-Walker malformation. The presence of these species-specific neural progenitor populations refines our insight into human cerebellar developmental disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2980522727,"The production of banana—one of the highly consumed fruits—is highly affected due to loss of certain number of banana plants in an early phase of vegetation. This affects the ability of farmers to forecast and estimate the production of banana. In this paper, we propose a deep learning (DL) based method to precisely detect and count banana plants on a farm exclusive of other plants, using high resolution RGB aerial images collected from Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). An attempt to detect the plants on the normal RGB images resulted less than 78.8% recall for our sample images of a commercial banana farm in Thailand. To improve this result, we use three image processing methods—Linear Contrast Stretch, Synthetic Color Transform and Triangular Greenness Index—to enhance the vegetative properties of orthomosaic, generating multiple variants of orthomosaic. Then we separately train a parameter-optimized Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on manually interpreted banana plant samples seen on each image variants, to produce multiple results of detection on our region of interest. 96.4%, 85.1% and 75.8% of plants were correctly detected on three of our dataset collected from multiple altitude of 40, 50 and 60 meters, of same farm. Further discussion on results obtained from combination of multiple altitude variants are also discussed later in the research, in an attempt to find better altitude combination for data collection from UAV for the detection of banana plants. The results showed that merging the detection results of 40 and 50 meter dataset could detect the plants missed by each other, increasing recall upto 99%."
https://openalex.org/W2919457122,"Neurodegenerative diseases appear to progress by spreading via brain connections. Here we evaluated this transneuronal degeneration hypothesis by attempting to predict future atrophy in a longitudinal cohort of patients with behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) and semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (svPPA). We determined patient-specific ""epicenters"" at baseline, located each patient's epicenters in the healthy functional connectome, and derived two region-wise graph theoretical metrics to predict future atrophy: (1) shortest path length to the epicenter and (2) nodal hazard, the cumulative atrophy of a region's first-degree neighbors. Using these predictors and baseline atrophy, we could accurately predict longitudinal atrophy in most patients. The regions most vulnerable to subsequent atrophy were functionally connected to the epicenter and had intermediate levels of baseline atrophy. These findings provide novel, longitudinal evidence that neurodegeneration progresses along connectional pathways and, further developed, could lead to network-based clinical tools for prognostication and disease monitoring."
https://openalex.org/W2980834605,"The soluble interleukin 2 receptor (sIL-2R) has been proposed as a marker of disease activity in patients with sarcoidosis. However, no studies have evaluated whether serum sIL-2R measurement is of use in establishing the diagnosis of sarcoidosis in patients who are suspected of sarcoidosis among other diseases.A cohort study was conducted, consisting of new patients who visited the immunology outpatient clinic and whose serum sIL-2R levels were available before a definitive diagnosis was established between February 2011 and February 2016. All patients underwent standard diagnostic testing for sarcoidosis (e.g. laboratory tests, radiographic and/or nuclear imaging and/or affected site biopsy). This resulted either in the diagnosis of sarcoidosis or the exclusion of sarcoidosis with the diagnosis of another disease. Results of sIL-2R and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) levels, radiographic and nuclear imaging and histology results were collected and definitive diagnoses were recorded. Sensitivity, specificity, the concordance statistic from the receiver operating characteristic curve and Youden's Index were calculated to assess the performance of sIL-2R in the diagnosis of sarcoidosis and were compared to ACE, currently one of the most used diagnostic biomarkers in the diagnosis of sarcoidosis.In total 983 patients were screened for inclusion, of which 189 patients met the inclusion criteria. A total of 101 patients were diagnosed with sarcoidosis after diagnostic workup, of whom 79 were biopsy-proven. In 88 patients a diagnosis other than sarcoidosis was made. The sensitivity and specificity of serum soluble interleukin 2 receptor levels to detect sarcoidosis were 88% and 85%. The sensitivity and specificity of ACE were 62% and 76%. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed that sIL-2R receptor is superior to ACE (p<0.0001).Serum sIL-2R is a sensitive biomarker and superior to ACE in establishing the diagnosis of sarcoidosis and can be used to rule out sarcoidosis in patients suspected of sarcoidosis."
https://openalex.org/W2980989014,"Background To investigate the ongoing controversy on the effect of BMI (body mass index) on EOP (early onset preeclampsia) vs LOP (late onset), especially focusing on diabetes and maternal booking/pre-pregnancy BMI as possible independent variables. Methods 18 year-observational cohort study (2001–2018). The study population consisted of all consecutive births delivered at the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Hospitalier Sud Reunion’s maternity (ap. 4,300 birth per year, only level 3 maternity in the south of Reunion Island, sole allowed to follow and deliver all preeclampsia cases of the area). History of pregnancies, deliveries and neonatal outcomes have been collected in standardized fashion into an epidemiological perinatal data base. Results Chronic hypertension and, history of preeclampsia in multigravidas, were the strongest risk factors for EOP. Primiparity, age over 35 years and BMI ≥ 35 kg/m² were rather associated with LOP. In a multivariate analysis with EOP or LOP as outcome variables compared with controls (normotensive), maternal age and pre-pregnancy BMI were independent risk factors for both EOP and LOP (p < 0.001). However, analyzing by increment of 5 (years of age, kg/m² for BMI) rising maternal ages and incidence of preeclampsia were strictly parallel for EOP and LOP, while increment of BMI was only associated with LOP. Controlling for maternal ages and booking/pre-pregnancy BMI, diabetes was not an independent risk factor neither for EOP or LOP. Conclusions Metabolic factors, other than diabetes, associated with pre-pregnancy maternal corpulence are specifically associated with LOP. This may be a direction for future researches on the maternal preeclamptic syndrome. This may explain the discrepancy we are facing nowadays where high-income countries report 90% of their preeclampsia being LOP, while it is only 60–70% in medium-low income countries."
https://openalex.org/W2980589501,"The Ligurian Sea is one of the most studied Mediterranean basins. Since the beginning of the last century, many research expeditions have characterized its benthic and pelagic fauna through scuba diving and trawl surveys. However, a large knowledge gap exists about the composition of benthic communities extending into the so-called mesophotic or twilight depth range, currently under intense pressure from commercial and recreational fishing. A series of visual surveys, carried out by means of remotely operated vehicles between 2012 and 2018, were conducted along the Ligurian deep continental shelf and shelf break, between 30 and 210 m depth, in order to characterize the main benthic biocoenoses dwelling at this depth range and to determine the most relevant environmental factors that explain their spatial distribution. Deep circalittoral communities of the Ligurian Sea were represented by a mixture of species belonging to the deepest extension of shallow-water habitats and deep circalittoral ones. Twelve major biocoenoses were identified, each one characterized by specific preferences in depth range, substrate type and seabed slope. Those biocoenoses included gorgonian and hydrozoan forests, dense keratose sponge grounds, Dendrophyllia cornigera gardens, bryozoan beds and soft-bottom meadows of sabellid polychaetes and soft-corals. Other less common aggregations included six forests of black corals and two populations of Paramuricea macrospina. A georeferenced database has been created in order to provide information to managers and stakeholders about the location of the identified communities and high-diversity areas, aiming to facilitate sustainable long-term conservation of the Ligurian benthic ecosystem."

These enzymes have diverse specificity, cleaving the chain with endo- or exotype activity and with differential selectivity for the sequence of M or G at the cleavage site. Dp0100 is a 201-kDa multimodular, broad-specificity endotype alginate lyase from the marine thermophile Defluviitalea phaphyphila, which uses brown algae as a carbon source, converting it to ethanol, and bioinformatics analysis suggested that its catalytic domain represents a new polysaccharide lyase family, PL39. The structure of the Dp0100 catalytic domain, determined at 2.07 Å resolution, revealed that it comprises three regions strongly resembling those of the exotype lyase families PL15 and PL17. The conservation of key catalytic histidine and tyrosine residues belonging to the latter suggests these enzymes share mechanistic similarities. A complex of Dp0100 with a pentasaccharide, M5, showed that the oligosaccharide is located in subsites −2, −1, +1, +2, and +3 in a long, deep canyon open at both ends, explaining the endotype activity of this lyase. This contrasted with the hindered binding sites of the exotype enzymes, which are blocked such that only one sugar moiety can be accommodated at the −1 position in the catalytic site. The biochemical and structural analyses of Dp0100, the first for this new class of endotype alginate lyases, have furthered our understanding of the structure–function and evolutionary relationships within this important class of enzymes.

https://openalex.org/W2980833485,"Objectives Alcohol use disorders (AUD) is well known to aggregate in families and is associated with socioeconomic status (SES). The objective was to study the effect of education, income and neighborhood SES in adulthood on AUD, and to explore whether the potential associations were confounded by shared familial factors, by using a co-relative control design. Methods Data on AUD was drawn from the Swedish inpatient and outpatient care registers; prescription drug register; and crime data. Through national population registers we collected information on income, education and neighborhood SES at age 25, 30, 35 and 40 years in all individuals born in Sweden between 1950 and 1980. Each sex-specific stratum consisted of approximately 750,000–1,200,000 individuals, who were followed for AUD for a mean follow-up time ranging between 10 and 15 years until the end of 2013. Cox proportional hazards models were used to investigate the risk of AUD as a function of income, education and neighborhood SES in the general population and in pairs of first cousins and full siblings within the same sex, who differed in their exposure to the SES measure. Results Higher educational level, higher income and higher neighborhood SES were all associated with a reduced risk for AUD for both males and females in all ages. The potentially protective effect remained but was attenuated when comparing pairs of first cousins and full siblings. Conclusions High educational level and income in adulthood, as well as high neighborhood socioeconomic status, may represent protective factors against alcohol use disorders, even when shared familial factors, e.g. childhood socioeconomic status and genetic factors, have been taken into account."
https://openalex.org/W2980863204,"The cytotoxic effects of melittin, a bee-venom peptide, have been widely studied towards cancer cells. Typically, these studies have examined the effect of melittin over extended-time courses (6–24 hours), meaning that immediate cellular interactions have been overlooked. In this work, we demonstrate the rapid effects of melittin on both gastric and colorectal cancer, specifically AGS, COLO205 and HCT-15 cell lines, over a period of 15 minutes. Melittin exhibited a dose dependent effect at 4 hours of treatment, with complete cellular death occurring at the highest dose of 20 μg/mL. Interestingly, when observed at shorter time points, melittin induced cellular changes within seconds; membrane damage was observed as swelling, breakage or blebbing. High-resolution imaging revealed treated cells to be compromised, showing clear change in cellular morphology. After 1 minute of melittin treatment, membrane changes were observed, and intracellular material could be seen expelled from the cells. Overall, these results enhance our understanding of the fast acting anti-cancer effects of melittin."
https://openalex.org/W2980851427,"The main control strategy for Ascaris lumbricoides is mass drug administration (especially with benzimidazoles), which can select strains of parasites resistant to treatment. Mutations in the beta-tubulin isotype-1 gene at codons 167, 198 and 200 have been linked to benzimidazole resistance in several nematodes. The mutation in codon 200 is the most frequent in different species of parasites, as previously observed in Necator americanus and Trichuris trichiura; however, this mutation has never been found in populations of A. lumbricoides. This study aimed to screen for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the beta-tubulin isotype-1 gene at codon 200 in A. lumbricoides. We developed a technique based on an amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS-PCR) for the analysis of 854 single A. lumbricoides eggs collected from 68 human stool samples from seven Brazilian states. We detected the mutation in codon 200 at a frequency of 0.5% (4/854). This is the first report of this mutation in A. lumbricoides. Although the observed frequency is low, its presence indicates that these parasite populations have the potential to develop high levels of resistance in the future. The methodology proposed here provides a powerful tool to screen for the emergence of anthelmintic resistance mutations in parasitic nematode populations."
https://openalex.org/W2981223353,"Engineering T-cells to express receptors specific for antigens present on tumour tissue is proving a highly effective treatment for some leukaemias. However, extending this to solid tumours requires antigens that can be safely and effectively targeted. TEM8, a marker overexpressed on the vasculature of some solid tumours, has been proposed as one such target. A recent report stated that T-cells engineered to express a TEM8-specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR), when injected into mouse models of triple negative breast cancer, are both safe and effective in controlling tumour growth. Here we report contrasting data with a panel of TEM8-specific CAR-T-cells including one generated from the same antibody used in the other study. We found that the CAR-T-cells demonstrated clear TEM8-specific cytotoxic and cytokine release responses in vitro, but when injected into healthy C57BL6 and NSG mice they rapidly and selectively disappeared from the circulation and in most cases caused rapid toxicity. Infusing CAR-T-cells into a TEM8-knockout mouse indicated that selective loss of cells from the circulation was due to targeting of TEM8 in healthy tissues. Histological analysis of mice treated with a TEM8-specific CAR revealed evidence of inflammation in the lung and spleen with large collections of infiltrating neutrophils. Therefore our data raise concerns over potential on-target off-tumour toxicity with CARs targeting TEM8 and these should be considered carefully before embarking upon clinical trials with such agents."

The overlapping pattern of geniculocortical inputs with M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor-rich patches in layer 1 (L1) suggests a non-random architecture. Here, we found that L1 inputs from the lateral posterior thalamus (LP) avoid patches and target interpatches. Channelrhodopsin-2-assisted mapping of excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in L2/3 shows that the relative excitation of parvalbumin-expressing interneurons (PVs) and pyramidal neurons (PNs) by dLGN, LP, and cortical feedback is distinct and depends on whether the neurons reside in clusters aligned with patches or interpatches. Paired recordings from PVs and PNs show that unitary inhibitory postsynaptic currents (uIPSCs) are larger in interpatches than in patches. The spatial clustering of inhibition is matched by dense clustering of PV terminals in interpatches. The results show that the excitation/inhibition balance across V1 is organized into patch and interpatch subnetworks, which receive distinct long-range inputs and are specialized for the processing of distinct spatiotemporal features.

The modernist’s maxim that form follows function manifests itself in neuroscience as functional architecture. The mesoscale description of the spatial relationship between neuronal responses, layers, columns, and areas has driven much of what is known about the matrix of the cortical network (Hubel and Wiesel, 1962Hubel D.H.

The concepts that emerged from these studies include the representation of space in topographic maps, the complexification of receptive fields, functionally distinct columns, hierarchical processing along specialized streams, the exponential distance rule, and the counterstream connectivity between areas in which feedforward inputs convey prediction errors to improve internal models of the world (Felleman and Van Essen, 1991Felleman D.J.

Although the functional architecture implies that the spatiotemporal tuning of neurons is determined by connectivity and physical layout, the networks of modular processing have been difficult to define (da Costa and Martin, 2013da Costa N.M. Martin K.A.C. Sparse reconstruction of brain circuits: or, how to survive without a microscopic connectome.Neuroimage. 2013; 80: 27-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The challenge has been greatest in rodents because of the view that cortex lacks columnar organization (Ohki et al., 2005Ohki K. Chung S. Ch’ng Y.H. Kara P. Reid R.C.

However, recent studies in mouse primary visual cortex (V1) have found that subcortically and intracortically projecting PNs are clustered and are aligned to microcolumns with distinct tuning preferences (Kondo et al., 2016Kondo S.

Previously, we found an interdigitating pattern of M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor-expressing (M2+) patches and M2− interpatches in L1 of mouse V1, which aligns with distinct cell clusters in L2/3 tuned for high spatial frequency (SF) and high temporal frequency (TF), respectively (Ji et al., 2015Ji W.

This finding provides structural evidence for functionally discrete modules and raises the question whether the excitation (E)/inhibition (I) balance in patches and interpatches is spatially organized. That inhibition is not a uniform blanket across V1 (Karnani et al., 2014Karnani M.M. Agetsuma M. Yuste R. A blanket of inhibition: functional inferences from dense inhibitory connectivity.Curr. Opin.

Whether the inhibitory network is tied to the clustered patch/interpatch system in V1 and provides distinct subnetworks for processing visual information remains unknown. To determine whether inhibition across V1 is modular, we measured the strength of synaptic long-range input to L2/3 PNs and PVs in patches and interpatches by using subcellular channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2)-assisted circuit mapping (sCRACM) (Mao et al., 2011Mao T.

Mao T. Sternson S.M. Svoboda K. The subcellular organization of neocortical excitatory connections.Nature. 2009; 457: 1142-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). We recorded from pairs of PVs and PNs and analyzed unitary excitatory (uEPSCs) and inhibitory (uIPSCs) postsynaptic currents in patches and interpatches. The results show that V1 contains two different circuit motifs in which patches and interpatches have distinct thalamocortical and interareal inputs to PNs and PVs and that PVs in interpatches provide stronger inhibition to PNs than in patches. The modular organization of inhibition is consistent with the notion that neurons in interpatches are more sensitive to rapidly changing visual inputs (Ji et al., 2015Ji W. Gămănuţ R. Bista P. D’Souza R.D.D. Wang Q. Burkhalter A. Modularity in the organization of mouse primary visual cortex.Neuron. 2015; 87: 632-643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We have shown that inputs from the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) to L1 of V1 are clustered and overlap with the patchy pattern of M2 immunostaining (Ji et al., 2015Ji W. Gămănuţ R.

Here, we show in flatmounted cortex of Chrm2tdT mice that dLGN→V1 axons labeled by anterograde tracing with AAV2/1.hSyn.EGFP preferentially terminate in M2+ patches of L1 and avoid M2− interpatches (Figures 1A–1C). For quantitative analysis, we made contour maps (Sincich and Horton, 2005Sincich L.C. Horton J.C. Input to V2 thin stripes arises from V1 cytochrome oxidase patches.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 10087-10093Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) of the distribution of fluorescence that demarcates patches (top 33% quantile) and interpatches (bottom 33% quantile) and compared M2 expression with dLGN→V1 intensity in regions of interest (ROIs) at the center of the projection (Figures S1A and S1B). Random shuffling of pixel values in each ROI showed a greater than chance overlap of M2+ and dLGN projections (Figure S1C). We normalized the values in interpatches to the mean intensity in patches across 5 mice and plotted the counts in different bins. We found that the intensity in patches was 2.1 ± 0.024-fold (p = 8 × 10−18; Kolmogorov-Smirnov test [KS]) higher than in interpatches (Figure 1D). Patches and interpatches in L1 were 60–80 μm wide, and centroids were 120–140 μm apart. dLGN projections to L3 to L4 (Figure 4A) and 5/6 appeared uniform. Inputs to L1 from the lateral posterior thalamic nucleus (LP) exhibited a different pattern, showing on average (n = 4 mice) 1.4 ± 0.14-fold (p = 1.33 ± 10−4; KS) stronger projections to M2− interpatches (Figures 1E–1H). Simultaneous tracing of dLGN→V1 and LP→V1 inputs with AAV2/1hSyn.tdT and AAV2/1.hSyn.EGFP, respectively, confirmed the interdigitating pattern of projections (patch/interpatch ratio = 0.5; Figures S1D–S1F), showing denser LP input to interpatches (n = 4 mice; p = 7.95 × 10−4; KS; Figures 1I–1L). We next compared feedback projections to L1 of V1 from the higher ventral stream lateromedial area (LM) with inputs from the dLGN. Double viral tracings from the dLGN and LM showed that inputs from both sources overlapped in presumptive M2+ patches of L1 (Figure 2A). On average (n = 4 mice), LM inputs to patches were 1.7 ± 0.05-fold denser than to interpatches (p = 1.45 × 10−4; KS; Figure 2B). We have shown previously that V1 inputs from the dorsal stream anterolateral area (AL) terminate in M2+ patches of L1 (Ji et al., 2015Ji W. Gămănuţ R. Bista P. D’Souza R.D.D. Wang Q. Burkhalter A. Modularity in the organization of mouse primary visual cortex.Neuron. 2015; 87: 632-643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), raising the question whether M2+ patches are the preferred targets of cortical feedback. To address this, we traced the connections from the posteromedial area (PM), another member of the dorsal stream (Wang et al., 2012Wang Q. Sporns O. Burkhalter A. Network analysis of corticocortical connections reveals ventral and dorsal processing streams in mouse visual cortex.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 4386-4399Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), to V1. PM→V1 projections showed a preference for M2− interpatches (n = 3 mice; Figures S1G–S1I) and differed from simultaneously labeled AL→V1 inputs, which on average (n = 4 mice) preferred M2+ patches (Figures 2C–2I). Direct comparison of patterns in L1 showed that PM→V1 inputs to interpatches are largely excluded from patches targeted by AL→V1 inputs (Figure 2J; n = 4 mice), demonstrating that feedback projections by the two dorsal stream areas terminate at distinct sites. Classic studies suggest that the cholinergic innervation of cortex is diffuse and that spatial selectivity arises from clustering of receptors and axons (Muñoz and Rudy, 2014Muñoz W. Rudy B. Spatiotemporal specificity in cholinergic control of neocortical function.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2014; 26: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). But whether cholinergic fibers are spatially mapped is unknown. To address the question, we stained tangential sections through V1 with antibodies against M2 and choline acetyl transferase (ChAT). We found that ChAT-labeled axons in L1 were clustered and on average (n = 2 mice) significantly (p = 0.009) denser in M2+ patches (Figures S2A–S2D). Motivated by the report of Maruoka et al., 2017Maruoka H. Nakagawa N. Tsuruno S. Sakai S. Yoneda T. Hosoya T. Lattice system of functionally distinct cell types in the neocortex.Science. 2017; 358: 610-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar that L5 neurons in V1 of 6-day-old (P6) mice form 20-μm-wide microcolumns, we have looked for clustered M2 expression in postnatal development. Our results in tangential sections through V1 of P4 Chrm2tdT mice show that M2 expression in L1 is patchy (10–30 μm wide; 52–79 μm center to center; Figure S3A). In L2/3, patches were smaller and contained 0.8- to 1.5-μm-wide rings, presumably representing membranes of cross-sectioned dendrites (Figure S3B). At postnatal day 10 (P10), the L1 patches were larger (30–60 μm wide) and more widely spaced (80–100 μm center to center; Figure S3C), a difference that may be accounted for by the 1.7-fold increase in brain size (Agrawal et al., 1968Agrawal H.C. Davis J.M. Himwich W.A. Developmental changes in mouse brain: weight, water content and free amino acids.J. Neurochem. 1968; 15: 917-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that L2/3 neurons in M2− interpatches of V1 are more often tuned to the direction of visual motion and respond to higher speeds and TFs than neurons in M2+ patches (Ji et al., 2015Ji W. Gămănuţ R. Bista P. D’Souza R.D.D. Wang Q. Burkhalter A. Modularity in the organization of mouse primary visual cortex.Neuron. 2015; 87: 632-643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This non-uniform distribution of selectivities suggested that the two cell clusters differentially process spatiotemporal information. Feedforward inhibition (FFI) mediated by excitation of PVs (D’Souza et al., 2016D’Souza R.D. Meier A.M. Bista P. Wang Q. Burkhalter A. Recruitment of inhibition and excitation across mouse visual cortex depends on the hierarchy of interconnecting areas.eLife. 2016; 5: e193332Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and their inhibitory output is known to shape the temporal sensitivity of PNs in auditory cortex (Li et al., 2014Li L.-Y. Ji X.-Y. Liang F. Li Y.-T. Xiao Z. Tao H.W. Zhang L.I. A feedforward inhibitory circuit mediates lateral refinement of sensory representation in upper layer 2/3 of mouse primary auditory cortex.J. Neurosci. 2014; 34: 13670-13683Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We therefore characterized the precipitating events of FFI by comparing the strength of excitatory inputs to patches and interpatches from thalamocortical and intracortical pathways to L2/3 neurons in V1. We used sCRACM in slices of PVtdT mice in which inputs to V1 were anterogradely labeled with ChR2(H134R).EYFP. To select for inputs to distal dendrites of L2/3 neurons in L1 to L2 and preserve their 3D organization, we obtained tangential slices of V1. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were performed from pairs of PNs and PVs (≤40 μm apart) aligned with densely ChR2-EYFP-expressing patches or sparsely labeled interpatches, visualized by viral tracing from the dLGN. Locations of the recorded neurons were determined by intracellular filling with Alexa Fluor 594 hydrazide (Figure 3A). Immunostaining of re-sectioned slices for M2 revealed that dLGN→V1 inputs overlapped with M2+ patches (Figures S4A–S4C). Input strength was measured by EPSCs elicited by laser stimulation of ChR2-expressing terminals. Laser stimulation was delivered in an 8 × 8 grid with 75-μm spacing centered on the cell body. sCRACM in the same slice of dLGN inputs to neighboring PVs and PNs showed stronger synaptic activation in patches than interpatches. Direct comparison of cell pairs in patches and interpatches showed that EPSCs from PVs were larger than from PNs (Figures 3B–3E). The average EPSC recorded from PVs (323.6 ± 130 pA) in patches was 2.3-fold larger (p < 0.001; n = 17 pairs; Wilcoxson signed-rank test [Wt]) than from PNs (140.6 ± 81.6 pA; Figure 3G). A similar 2.3-fold difference (p < 0.001; n = 17 pairs) was found in interpatches between the overall more weakly responsive PVs (147.7 ± 91.2 pA) and PNs (62.9 ± 31.1 pA). Heatmaps of EPSCs in patches and interpatches show that responses were maximal near the cell body and decreased distally (Figures 3B and 3D). The responsive area was smaller for PNs than PVs (p < 0.001; Wt) but similar in patches and interpatches (Figure 3F). dLGN inputs to PVs evoked higher current densities (p < 0.01; Wt; Figure 3F) and exhibited faster rise times of EPSCs than inputs to PNs in both patches (PV: 11.6 ± 0.1 ms; PN: 14 ± 0.3 ms) and interpatches (PV: 11.7 ± 0.1 ms; PN: 14.8 ± 0.3 ms; p < 0.05; Wt). These results indicate that the strength of activation by dLGN inputs to L1 to L2 is cell type and module specific. To examine whether the shape of the apical dendritic tree of PNs and PVs contributes to this specificity, we measured branch lengths outside a 100-μm-diameter circle centered on the soma. For PNs in patches with a total dendritic length of 234 ± 21 μm (n = 6), 82.5% of branches were in patches and 17.5% in interpatches (p < 0.01; t test). PVs in patches with a total arbor of 157 ± 34 μm (n = 6) showed 91.8% of branches in patches and 8.2% in interpatches (p < 0.001). PNs in interpatches with a total arbor of 235 ± 19 μm (n = 5) showed 81% of branches in interpatches and 10% in patches (p < 0.05). PVs in interpatches with a total arbor of 164.7 ± 23 μm (n = 7) showed 83.3% of branches in interpatches and 16.7% in patches (p < 0.05). An issue with tangential slices is that they may not always remove inputs to basal dendrites in L2/3 and therefore confound measurements of the strength of L1 input to patches and interpatches. To sort out inputs to apical and basal dendrites, we obtained coronal slices in which dLGN→V1 inputs were labeled with ChR2.EYFP. Projections to L1 were denser in patches than interpatches, and inputs to the bottom of L2/3 were uniform (Figure 4A). sCRACM was performed by laser stimulation in an 8 × 10 (mediolateral × dorsoventral) 75-μm grid aligned to the pial surface. Recordings from L2/3 PNs showed that EPSCs in L1 normalized to the total EPSCs were larger (p = 8.5 × 10−4; t test) in patches than in interpatches (Figures 4A and 4B). Comparison of the proportion of L1 and L2/3 EPSCs of total EPSCs showed that, in patches, inputs to L1 and L2/3 were similar (Figure 4C). In contrast, in interpatches, the proportion of L1 inputs was lower (p = 0.0025; paired t test) than in L2/3 (Figure 4C), demonstrating, in support of structural evidence, that inputs to apical dendrites are clustered whereas those to basal dendrites are uniform. Although recordings from single cells were readily obtained, measurements from two pairs in the same slice were challenging, because one member of a pair in a patch and neighboring interpatch was often buried in the slice where patchy dLGN→V1 inputs were difficult to resolve. We therefore recorded from L2/3 PN/PV patch and interpatch pairs in separate slices. The results showed that EPSCs from PVs were larger compared to PNs and the PV/PN ratios in patches and interpatches were similar (Figures 4D–4F). The range of responses was comparable in patches and interpatches, easing the concern of across-slice comparisons. The results indicate that, in coronal slices in which dLGN→V1 inputs to L1–L5 are preserved, module specificity of geniculocortical input is revealed by the proportion of L1 to the total strength of input (Figure 4C). The results suggest that tangential slicing truncates basal dendrites of L2/3 cells and selects for dLGN→V1 input to L1. We used sCRACM in coronal slices to examine responses of LP→V1 inputs to L2/3 cells. Patches and interpatches were identified by tdT-expressing dLGN→V1 projections. Recordings in the same slice showed that EPSCs from PNs were larger (p < 0.04; Wt) in interpatches than in patches (Figure 4G). This pattern is consistent with the increased innervation density of L1 inputs to interpatches and the lack of inputs to L3 to L4, whose presence in coronal slices obscures the module specificity of dLGN→V1 input to L2/3 cells (Figures 4D–4F). Next, we compared responses to LP→V1 L1 inputs from PNs and PVs in patches and interpatches. Responses from both cell types were matched, with median EPSCPN/EPSCPV ratios in patches and interpatches similar to unity and not significantly different from one another (Figures 4H–4J). This differed from the strong preference for PVs found after stimulation of dLGN→V1 inputs in both tangential and coronal slices (Figures 3G and 4D–4F) and suggests that dLGN→V1 and LP→V1 inputs to L1 feed distinct subnetworks in patches and interpatches in which PNs and PVs are excited at different strengths (Figure 4K). Input from LM→V1 to L1 terminated in periodic clusters, which overlapped with dLGN→V1 projections (Figure 2A). Laser stimulation of ChR2-expressing LM→V1 terminals in tangential slices showed that EPSCs from PNs and PVs in patches were larger (p < 0.001; Wt) than in interpatches (Figures 5A, 5B, 5D, and 5G ), indicating that input strength is correlated with the density of connections to patches in L1 (Figure 2B). Within patches, EPSCs from PVs (529.5 ± 305.9 pA; n = 23) and PNs (598.9 ± 433.2 pA; n = 23) were similar (p = 0.38; Wt; Figures 5C and 5G). A similar balance was observed in the matching current densities and the spatial extent of activation of PNs and PVs in patches (Figure 5F). In contrast, in interpatches, EPSCs from PVs (244 ± 186.4 pA; n = 23) were 1.9-fold larger (p < 0.001; Wt) than from PNs (130.1 ± 145.9 pA; n = 23; Figures 5E and 5G). Although, in interpatches, current densities from PVs and PNs were similar, inputs to PVs covered a larger area, which resulted in the more effective activation of PVs (Figures 5E and 5F). Together, the comparison of thalamocortical and intracortical inputs to L1 shows that each pathway preferentially targets specific modules and, within these modules, differentially excites PNs and PVs. The clustering in the cell-specific strength of activation by inputs to L1 raised the question whether inhibition is non-uniformly distributed across the sheet of V1. To determine whether GABAergic neurons are clustered, we used VGAT-EYFP mice. As proxy for M2 patches, we traced the dLGN→V1 connections with AAV2/1hSyn.tdT and cut tangential sections though V1. We found that VGAT expression in L1 to L2 was less conspicuously clustered than the dLGN→V1 projections (Figures S5A–S5E). Normalization of the fluorescence intensity in interpatches to the mean of patches, however, showed that, on average (n = 2 mice), labeling in interpatches was brighter (p < 0.035; KS; Figure S5F). Previous reports have shown that PV- and SOM-expressing GABAergic neurons in L2/3 of mouse V1 are clustered and radially aligned in L5 with subcortically projecting PNs (Ebina et al., 2014Ebina T. Sohya K. Imayoshi I. Yin S.-T. Kimura R. Yanagawa Y. Kameda H. Hioki H. Kaneko T.

Nakagawa N. Tsuruno S. Sakai S. Yoneda T. Hosoya T. Lattice system of functionally distinct cell types in the neocortex.Science. 2017; 358: 610-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To test spatial clustering, we cut tangential sections through V1 of PVtdT mice and found a striking patchiness (120 μm center-to-center spacing) of labeled fibers in L1 (Figure S5G). To determine whether M2 and PVs are spatially registered, we stained tangential sections through V1 with an antibody against M2. We found that, in the outer half of L1 (L1A; Figure 6M), clusters of PVtdT+ dendrites overlapped with M2+ patches (Figures 6A–6C). In contrast, in L1B and the top of L2/3, the PVtdT clusters switched registration and overlapped with M2− interpatches. PVtdT clusters in L1B contained dendrites and axons to which cell bodies and pericellular boutons of basket cells (BCs) were added in L2 (Figures 6D–6I and 6M). The complementary mapping schemes were confirmed by shifting alignments of PVtdT intensities with M2+ patches in L1A (p = 1.44 × 10−15; KS) to M2− interpatches in L1B to L2 (p = 7.04 × 10−7; KS; Figures 6J and 6K). We further found that the PV cell density in the top 160 μm of L2/3 was 37% higher in interpatches (204/mm2) than in patches (128/mm2). A similar module-selective mapping was found in biocytin-filled PVs in patches (n = 3) and interpatches (n = 5) whose axons were largely confined to 100-μm-wide clusters within the home module (Figure 6L). Does the shifting alignment of PVtdT and M2 expression across L1 reflect a cell-type-specific depth profile similar to prefrontal cortex (Miyamae et al., 2017Miyamae T. Chen K. Lewis D.A. Gonzalez-Burgos G. Distinct physiological maturation of parvalbumin-positive neuron subtypes in mouse prefrontal cortex.J. Neurosci. 2017; 37: 4883-4902Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), where dendrites of chandelier cells (ChCs) project to L1A and BCs to L1B (Figure 6M)? Previous studies have shown that the distribution of L2/3 ChCs is non-random and projections to ankyrin G immunolabeled axon initial segments (AISs) are spatially clustered (Blázquez-Llorca et al., 2015Blázquez-Llorca L. Woodruff A. Inan M. Anderson S.A. Yuste R. DeFelipe J. Merchán-Pérez A. Spatial distribution of neurons innervated by chandelier cells.Brain Struct.

Thus, we compared the density of PVtdT+ putative contacts with AIS. Counts were made on radially oriented, tapered AISs of presumptive PNs in 75-μm-wide “columns” aligned with M2+ patches and M2− interpatches (Figures S6A–S6D). We found that the length density of boutons was 52% higher (p < 0.01; paired t test) in patches than interpatches, which supports that ChCs are clustered and that the connections preferentially innervate PNs in patches (Figures 6M and S6E). To find out whether clustering of inhibitory neurons in interpatches results in irregular cell densities within L2/3, we determined the density of ankyrin G expressing, vertical AIS and treated them as proxies of PNs. We found that th"

However, guidelines with evidence-based safe gambling practices (SGPs) that prevent gambling-related harm are lacking. This study aimed to: 1) identify a parsimonious set of evidence-based SGPs that best predict non-harmful gambling amongst gamblers who are otherwise most susceptible to experiencing gambling harm; 2) examine how widely are they used; and 3) assess whether their use differs by gambler characteristics. A sample of 1,174 regular gamblers in Alberta Canada completed an online survey measuring uptake of 43 potential SGPs, gambling harms and numerous risk factors for harmful gambling. Elastic net regression identified a sub-sample of 577 gamblers most susceptible to gambling harm and therefore most likely to benefit from the uptake of SGPs. A second elastic net predicted gambling harm scores in the sub-sample, using the SGPs as candidate predictors. Nine SGPs best predicted non-harmful gambling amongst this sub-sample. The behaviour most strongly associated with increased harm was using credit to gamble. The behaviour most strongly associated with reduced harm was 'If I'm not having fun gambling, I stop'. These SGPs form the basis of evidence-based safe gambling guidelines which can be: 1) promoted to consumers, 2) form the basis of self-assessment tests, 3) used to measure safe gambling at a population level, and 4) inform supportive changes to policy and practice. The guidelines advise gamblers to: stop if they are not having fun, keep a household budget, keep a dedicated gambling budget, have a fixed amount they can spend, engage in other leisure activities, avoid gambling when upset or depressed, not use credit for gambling, avoid gambling to make money, and not think that strategies can help you win. These guidelines are a promising initiative to help reduce gambling-related harm."

This descriptive, cross-sectional study examines the associations between sleep quality, inappropriate medication use and frailty. The study was conducted among 151 residents of 11 aged care homes in three states in Malaysia; convenience sampling was used. Subjective sleep quality was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and Groningen Frailty Indicator (GFI) was used to assess frailty. Medication appropriateness was assessed using Drug burden Index (DBI), Potentially Inappropriate Medications (PIMs) and Potentially Inappropriate Prescriptions (PIPs). Most of the subjects (approximately 95%) reported poor sleep quality, as measured by a cut-off of global PSQI score of ≥ 5. With a second cut-off at 10, just over half (56%) reported moderately poor sleep quality followed by 39% who had very poor sleep quality. Most (90%) denied taking medication to improve their sleep during the previous month. There was no statistically significant association between medication inappropriateness (PIMs, PIPs, DBI) and global PSQI score. However, the average number of PIM was associated significantly with sleep efficiency (a measure of the actual 'sleep to total time spent in bed) (p = 0.037). The average number of PIP was associated with subjective sleep quality (p = 0.045) and the use of sleep medications (p = 0.001), and inversely associated with sleep disturbance (0.049). Furthermore, frailty correlated significantly with poor overall sleep quality (p = 0.032). Findings support the need for medication review to identify and reduce PIMs and optimise prescriptions to improve sleep quality and hence, related health outcomes among residents of aged care homes."
https://openalex.org/W2980743900,"The human hippocampus comprises a number of interconnected histologically and functionally distinct subfields, which may be differentially influenced by cerebral pathology. Automated techniques are now available that estimate hippocampal subfield volumes using in vivo structural MRI data. To date, research investigating the influence of cerebral β-amyloid deposition-one of the earliest hypothesised changes in the pathophysiological continuum of Alzheimer's disease-on hippocampal subfield volumes in cognitively normal older individuals, has been limited.Using cross-sectional data from 408 cognitively normal individuals born in mainland Britain (age range at time of assessment = 69.2-71.9 years) who underwent cognitive assessment, 18F-Florbetapir PET and structural MRI on the same 3 Tesla PET/MR unit (spatial resolution 1.1 x 1.1 x 1.1. mm), we investigated the influences of β-amyloid status, age at scan, and global white matter hyperintensity volume on: CA1, CA2/3, CA4, dentate gyrus, presubiculum and subiculum volumes, adjusting for sex and total intracranial volume.Compared to β-amyloid negative participants (n = 334), β-amyloid positive participants (n = 74) had lower volume of the presubiculum (3.4% smaller, p = 0.012). Despite an age range at scanning of just 2.7 years, older age at time of scanning was associated with lower CA1 (p = 0.007), CA4 (p = 0.004), dentate gyrus (p = 0.002), and subiculum (p = 0.035) volumes. There was no evidence that white matter hyperintensity volume was associated with any subfield volumes.These data provide evidence of differential associations in cognitively normal older adults between hippocampal subfield volumes and β-amyloid deposition and, increasing age at time of scan. The relatively selective effect of lower presubiculum volume in the β-amyloid positive group potentially suggest that the presubiculum may be an area of early and relatively specific volume loss in the pathophysiological continuum of Alzheimer's disease. Future work using higher resolution imaging will be key to exploring these findings further."
https://openalex.org/W2981245588,"This paper presents an experimental study on the applicability of microbial induced carbonate precipitation (MICP) to treat municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) fly ash with high alkalinity and heavy metal toxicity. The experiments were carried out on fly ashes A and B produced from incineration processes of mechanical grate furnace and circulating fluidized bed, respectively. The results showed that both types of fly ashes contained high CaO content, which could supply sufficient endogenous Ca for MICP treatment. Moreover, S. pasteurii can survive from high alkalinity and heavy metal toxicity of fly ash solution. Further, the unconfined compressive strength (UCS) of MICP treated fly ashes A and B reached 0.385MPa and 0.709 MPa, respectively. The MICP treatment also resulted in a reduction in the leaching toxicity of heavy metals, especially for Cu, Pb and Hg. MICP had a higher solidification and stabilization effect on fly ash B, which has finer particle size and higher Ca content. These findings shone a light on the possibility of using MICP technique as a suitable and efficient tool to treat the MSWI fly ash."
https://openalex.org/W2980948055,"The process by which fibroblasts are directly reprogrammed into cardiomyocytes involves two stages; initiation and maturation. Initiation represents the initial expression of factors that induce fibroblasts to transdifferentiate into cardiomyocytes. Following initiation, the cell undergoes a period of maturation before becoming a mature cardiomyocyte. We wanted to understand the role of cardiac development transcription factors in the maturation process. We directly reprogram fibroblasts into cardiomyocytes by a combination of miRNAs (miR combo). The ability of miR combo to induce cardiomyocyte-specific genes in fibroblasts was lost following the knockdown of the cardiac transcription factors Gata4, Mef2C, Tbx5 and Hand2 (GMTH). To further clarify the role of GMTH in miR combo reprogramming we utilized a modified CRISPR-Cas9 approach to activate endogenous GMTH genes. Importantly, both miR combo and the modified CRISPR-Cas9 approach induced comparable levels of GMTH expression. While miR combo was able to reprogram fibroblasts into cardiomyocyte-like cells, the modified CRISPR-Cas9 approach could not. Indeed, we found that cardiomyocyte maturation only occurred with very high levels of GMT expression. Taken together, our data indicates that while endogenous cardiac transcription factors are insufficient to reprogram fibroblasts into mature cardiomyocytes, endogenous cardiac transcription factors are necessary for expression of maturation genes."
https://openalex.org/W2981008404,"Background Control of vascular risk factors is essential for secondary stroke prevention. However, adherence to secondary prevention medications is often suboptimal, and may be affected by cognitive impairment. Few studies to date have examined associations between cognitive impairment and medication adherence post-stroke, and none have considered whether adherence to secondary prevention medications might affect subsequent cognitive function. The aim of this study was to explore prospective associations between cognitive impairment and medication non-adherence post-stroke. Methods A five-year follow-up of 108 stroke survivors from the Action on Secondary Prevention Interventions and Rehabilitation in Stroke (ASPIRE-S) prospective observational cohort study. Cognitive function was assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment at 6 months, and a neuropsychological test battery at 5 years. Adherence to antihypertensive, antithrombotic and lipid-lowering medications was assessed using prescription refill data. Results The prevalence of cognitive impairment at five years was 35.6%. The prevalence of non-adherence ranged from 15.1% for lipid-lowering agents to 30.2% for antithrombotics. There were no statistically significant associations between medication non-adherence in the first year post-stroke and cognitive impairment at 5 years, nor between cognitive impairment at 6 months and non-adherence at 5 years. Stroke survivors with cognitive impairment were significantly more likely to report receiving help with taking medications [OR (95% CI): 4.84 (1.17, 20.07)]. Conclusions This is the first study to explore the potential impact of non-adherence to secondary prevention medications on cognitive impairment in stroke survivors. Findings highlight the role of family members and caregivers in assisting stroke survivors with medication administration, particularly in the context of deficits in cognitive function. Involving family members and caregivers may be a legitimate and cost-effective strategy to improve medication adherence in stroke survivors."
https://openalex.org/W2981247270,"GSK3532795 (formerly BMS955176) is a second-generation maturation inhibitor (MI) that progressed through a Phase 2b study for treatment of HIV-1 infection. Resistance development to GSK3532795 was evaluated through in vitro methods and was correlated with information obtained in a Phase 2a proof-of-concept study in HIV-1 infected participants. Both low and high concentrations of GSK3532795 were used for selections in vitro, and reduced susceptibility to GSK3532795 mapped specifically to amino acids near the capsid/ spacer peptide 1 (SP1) junction, the cleavage of which is blocked by MIs. Two key substitutions, A364V or V362I, were selected, the latter requiring secondary substitutions to reduce susceptibility to GSK3532795. Three main types of secondary substitutions were observed, none of which reduced GSK3532795 susceptibility in isolation. The first type was in the capsid C-terminal domain and downstream SP1 region (including (Gag numbering) R286K, A326T, T332S/N, I333V and V370A/M). The second, was an R41G substitution in viral protease that occurred with V362I. The third was seen in the capsid N-terminal domain, within the cyclophilin A binding domain (V218A/M, H219Q and G221E). H219Q increased viral replication capacity and reduced susceptibility of poorly growing viruses. In the Phase 2a study, a subset of these substitutions was also observed at baseline and some were selected following GSK35323795 treatment in HIV-1-infected participants."
https://openalex.org/W2981277841,"Steroid hormones and their respective nuclear receptors are essential mediators in numerous physiologic and pathophysiologic processes, ranging from regulation of metabolism, immune function, and reproductive processes to the development of hormone-dependent cancers such as those of the breast and prostate. Because steroids must enter cells before activating nuclear receptors, understanding the mechanisms by which cellular uptake occurs is critical, yet a clear understanding of these mechanisms has been elusive. It is generally assumed that diffusion-driven uptake is similar across various steroids whereas an elevated cellular concentration is thought to reflect active uptake, but these assumptions have not been directly tested. Here we show that intact cells rapidly accumulate free steroids to markedly elevated concentrations. This effect varies widely depending on steroid structure; more lipophilic steroids reach more elevated concentrations. Strong preferences exist for 3β-OH, Δ5-steroids vs. 3-keto, Δ4-structural features and for progestogens vs. androgens. Surprisingly, steroid-structure-specific preferences do not require cell viability, implying a passive mechanism, and occur across cells derived from multiple tissue types. Physiologic relevance is suggested by structure-specific preferences in human prostate tissue compared with serum. On the other hand, the presence of serum proteins in vitro blocks much, but not all, of the passive accumulation, while still permitting a substantial amount of active accumulation for certain steroids. Our findings suggest that both passive and active uptake mechanisms make important contributions to the cellular steroid uptake process. The role of passive, lipophilicity-driven accumulation has previously been largely unappreciated, and its existence provides important context to studies on steroid transport and action both in vitro and in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2980558700,"Human semen contains trillions of extracellular vesicles (SEV) similar in size to sexually transmitted viruses and loaded with potentially bioactive miRNAs, proteins and lipids. SEV were shown to inhibit HIV and Zika virus infectivity, but whether SEV are able also to affect subsequent immune responses is unknown. We found that SEV efficiently bound to and entered antigen-presenting cells (APC) and thus we set out to further dissect the impact of SEV on APC function and the impact on downstream T cell responses. In an APC–T cell co-culture system, SEV exposure to APC alone markedly reduced antigen-specific cytokine production, degranulation and cytotoxicity by antigen-specific memory CD8+ T cells. In contrast, inhibition of CD4+ T cell responses required both APC and T cell exposure to SEV. Surprisingly, SEV did not alter MHC or co-stimulatory receptor expression on APCs, but caused APCs to upregulate indoleamine 2,3 deoxygenase, an enzyme known to indirectly inhibit T cells. Thus, SEV reduce the ability of APCs to activate T cells. We propose here that these immune-inhibitory properties of SEV may be intended to prevent immune responses against semen-derived antigens, but can be hi-jacked by genitally acquired viral infections to compromise adaptive cellular immunity."

We assessed changes in real-life practice for HCC over a long time period.The Korean Liver Cancer Association and the Korean Central Cancer Registry jointly established the nationwide cohorts of newly diagnosed HCC patients between 2003 and 2005 and between 2008 and 2014. According to sorafenib reimbursement in the Republic of Korea (January 2011), patients were divided into early (E-Cohort: 2003~2010) and late (L-Cohort: 2011~2014) cohorts.L-Cohort (n = 4776) comprised patients with older age (60.8 vs. 58.3 years), higher proportions of patients with well-preserved liver function (75.6% vs. 68.2%) and non-viral etiologies (28.6% vs. 19.4%), and lower proportion of patients with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer [BCLC] 0~A stage (46.2% vs. 53.9%) than E-Cohort (n = 8203) (all p<0.05). Proportions of patients undergoing curative treatments were higher in L-Cohort than in E-Cohort (55.0% vs. 35.1%, 23.2 vs. 11.3%, and 17.3% vs. 9.6% in BCLC 0A, B, and C stages, respectively; all p<0.05). Accordingly, compared with that in E-Cohort, overall survival in L-Cohort significantly improved in patients with BCLC 0~A, B, and C stages (all p<0.05). As first-line treatment, 62.4% underwent locoregional treatments (LRTs), whereas only 9.7% received sorafenib, among BCLC stage C patients in L-Cohort.For the past 12 years, curative treatments became more widely available to BCLC 0~A, B, and C stage patients, generally improving prognosis. Despite sorafenib reimbursement, LRTs remain the mainstay of first-line treatment for BCLC C stage patients."
https://openalex.org/W2981246159,"Citrus tatter leaf virus (CTLV) threatens citrus production worldwide because it induces bud-union crease on the commercially important Citrange (Poncirus trifoliata × Citrus sinensis) rootstocks. However, little is known about its genomic diversity and how such diversity may influence virus detection. In this study, full-length genome sequences of 12 CTLV isolates from different geographical areas, intercepted and maintained for the past 60 years at the Citrus Clonal Protection Program (CCPP), University of California, Riverside, were characterized using next generation sequencing. Genome structure and sequence for all CTLV isolates were similar to Apple stem grooving virus (ASGV), the type species of Capillovirus genus of the Betaflexiviridae family. Phylogenetic analysis highlighted CTLV’s point of origin in Asia, the virus spillover to different plant species and the bottleneck event of its introduction in the United States of America (USA). A reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay was designed at the most conserved genome area between the coat protein and the 3’-untranslated region (UTR), as identified by the full genome analysis. The assay was validated with different parameters (e.g. specificity, sensitivity, transferability and robustness) using multiple CTLV isolates from various citrus growing regions and it was compared with other published assays. This study proposes that in the era of powerful affordable sequencing platforms the presented approach of systematic full-genome sequence analysis of multiple virus isolates, and not only a small genome area of a small number of isolates, becomes a guideline for the design and validation of molecular virus detection assays, especially for use in high value germplasm programs."
https://openalex.org/W2980506400,"Fog computing is a promising technology that leverages the resources to provide services for requests of IoT (Internet of Things) devices at the cloud edge. The high dynamic and heterogeneous nature of devices at the cloud edge causes failures to be a popular event and therefore fault tolerance became indispensable. Most early scheduling and fault-tolerant methods did not highly consider time-sensitive requests. This increases the possibility of latencies for serving these requests which causes unfavorable impacts. This paper proposes a fault-tolerant scheduling method (FTSM) for allocating services' requests to the most sufficient devices in fog-cloud IoT-based environments. The main purpose of the proposed method is to reduce the latency and overheads of services and to increase the reliability and capacity of the cloud. The method depends on categorizing devices that can issue requests into three classes according to the type of service required. These classes are time-sensitive, time-tolerant and core. Each time-sensitive request is directly mapped to one or more edge devices using a pre-prepared executive list of devices. Each time-tolerant request may be assigned to one or more devices at the cloud edge or the cloud core. Core requests are assigned to resources at the cloud core. In order to achieve fault tolerance, the proposed method selects the most suitable fault-tolerant technique from replication, checkpointing and resubmission techniques for each request while most existing methods consider only one technique. The effectiveness of the proposed method is assessed using average service time, throughput, operation costs, success rate and capacity percentage as performance indicators."
https://openalex.org/W2980620716,"A comparative analysis of blood samples (depleted of albumin and IgG) obtained from lung cancer patients before chemotherapy versus after a second cycle of chemotherapy was performed using two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE). The control group consisted of eight patients with non-cancerous lung diseases, and the experimental group consisted of four adenocarcinoma (ADC) and four squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) patients. Analyses of gels revealed significant changes in proteins and/or their proteoforms between control patients and lung cancer patients, both before and after a second cycle of chemotherapy. Most of these proteins were related to inflammation, including acute phase proteins (APPs) such as forms of haptoglobin and transferrin, complement component C3, and clusterin. The variable expression of APPs can potentially be used for profiling lung cancer. The greatest changes observed after chemotherapy were in transferrin and serotransferrin, which likely reflect disturbances in iron turnover after chemotherapy-induced anaemia. Significant changes in plasma proteins between ADC and SCC patients were also revealed, suggesting use of plasma vitronectin as a potential marker of SCC."
https://openalex.org/W2981023038,"Visuomotor adaptation has been thought to occur implicitly, although recent findings suggest that it involves both explicit and implicit processes. Here, we investigated generalization between an explicit condition, in which subjects reached toward imaginary targets under a veridical visuomotor condition, and an implicit condition, in which subjects reached toward visual targets under a 30-degree counterclockwise rotation condition. In experiment 1, two groups of healthy young adults first experienced either the explicit or the implicit condition, then the other condition. The third group experienced the explicit, then the implicit condition with an instruction that the same cognitive strategy could be used in both conditions. Results showed that initial explicit learning did not facilitate subsequent implicit learning, or vice versa, in the first two groups. Subjects in the third group performed better at the beginning of the implicit condition, but still had to adapt to the rotation gradually. In experiment 2, three additional subject groups were tested. One group experienced the explicit, then an implicit condition in which the rotation direction was opposite (30-degree clockwise rotation). Generalization between the conditions was still minimal in that group. Two other groups experienced either the explicit or implicit condition, then performed reaching movements without visual feedback. Those who experienced the explicit condition did not demonstrate aftereffects, while those who experienced the implicit condition did. Collectively, these findings suggest that visuomotor adaptation primarily involves implicit processes, and that explicit processes can add up in a complementary fashion as individuals become increasingly aware of the perturbation."
https://openalex.org/W2981198193,"Acute viral wheeze in children is a major cause of hospitalisation and a major risk factor for the development of asthma. However, the role of the respiratory tract microbiome in the development of acute wheeze is unclear. To investigate whether severe wheezing episodes in children are associated with bacterial dysbiosis in the respiratory tract, oropharyngeal swabs were collected from 109 children with acute wheezing attending the only tertiary paediatric hospital in Perth, Australia. The bacterial community from these samples was explored using next generation sequencing and compared to samples from 75 non-wheezing controls. No significant difference in bacterial diversity was observed between samples from those with wheeze and healthy controls. Within the wheezing group, attendance at kindergarten or preschool was however, associated with increased bacterial diversity. Rhinovirus (RV) infection did not have a significant effect on bacterial community composition. A significant difference in bacterial richness was observed between children with RV-A and RV-C infection, however this is likely due to the differences in age group between the patient cohorts. The bacterial community within the oropharynx was found to be diverse and heterogeneous. Age and attendance at day care or kindergarten were important factors in driving bacterial diversity. However, wheeze and viral infection were not found to significantly relate to the bacterial community. Bacterial airway microbiome is highly variable in early life and its role in wheeze remains less clear than viral influences."
https://openalex.org/W2980702214,"The CRISPR/Cas9 system enables targeted genome modifications across a range of eukaryotes. Although we have reported that transient introduction of all-in-one vectors that express both Cas9 and sgRNAs can efficiently induce multiple gene knockouts in Dictyostelium discoideum, concerns remain about off-target effects and false-positive amplification during mutation detection via PCR. To minimise these effects, we modified the system to permit gene deletions of greater than 1 kb via use of paired sgRNAs and Cas9 nickase. An all-in-one vector expressing the Cas9 nickase and sgRNAs was transiently introduced into D. discoideum, and the resulting mutants showed long deletions with a relatively high efficiency of 10-30%. By further improving the vector, a new dual sgRNA expression vector was also constructed to allow simultaneous insertion of two sgRNAs via one-step cloning. By applying this system, precise point mutations and genomic deletions were generated in the target locus via simultaneous introduction of the vector and a single-stranded oligonucleotide template without integrating a drug resistance cassette. These systems enable simple and straightforward genome editing that requires high specificity, and they can serve as an alternative to the conventional homologous recombination-based gene disruption method in D. discoideum."
https://openalex.org/W2970754926,"Rationale Shorter leukocyte telomere length (LTL) is associated with reduced health-related quality of life and increased risk for acute exacerbations (AEs) and mortality in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Increased physical activity and exercise capacity are associated with reduced risk for AEs and death. However, the relationships between LTL and physical activity, exercise capacity, and AEs in COPD are unknown. Methods Data from 3 COPD cohorts were examined: Cohort 1 (n = 112, physical activity intervention trial), Cohorts 2 and 3 (n = 182 and 294, respectively, separate observational studies). Subjects completed a 6-minute walk test (6MWT) and provided blood for LTL assessment using real-time PCR. Physical activity was measured as average daily step count using an accelerometer or pedometer. Number of self-reported AEs was available for 1) the year prior to enrollment (Cohorts 1 and 3) and 2) prospectively after enrollment (all cohorts). Multivariate models examined associations between LTL and average daily step count, 6MWT distance, and AEs. Results A significant association between longer LTL and increased 6MWT distance was observed in the three combined cohorts (β = 3x10-5, p = 0.045). No association between LTL and average daily step count was observed. Shorter LTL was associated with an increased number of AEs in the year prior to enrollment (Cohorts 1 and 3 combined, β = -1.93, p = 0.04) and with prospective AEs (Cohort 3, β = -1.3388, p = 0.0003). Conclusions Among COPD patients, increased LTL is associated with higher exercise capacity, but not physical activity. Shorter LTL was associated with AEs in a subgroup of cohorts."
https://openalex.org/W2980322604,"Background Research in health communication frequently views it as an information dissemination strategy, thus neglecting the intricacies involved in communicating a sensitive topic such as menstruation. The social patterning in menstrual communication, a taboo in India, and its consequent health-effects on adolescents are under-studied. Methods We studied the social determinants of menstrual communication influencing menstrual- health through semi-structured interviews of 21 boys and girls each, 12 key-respondent interviews, followed by a cross-sectional survey of 1421 adolescents from Nashik district, India. We thematically analysed the qualitative data and fit multivariable logistic regression to model risk ratios. Findings We found social disparities in adolescents’ experiences of communication taboo regarding menstruation. While boys curbed their curiosity about the topic, girls too faced resistance to their experience-sharing and treatment-seeking for menstrual illnesses. The inequality in menstruation-related communication was evident as more boys than girls faced avoidance to their questions [IRR at 95%CI: 2.75 (2.04, 3.71)]], and fewer tribal than rural girls were communicated severe taboos (OR at 95% CI: 0.18 (0.09, 0.36))]. Girls who had been communicated severe (versus no/mild) taboos reported greater stress about menstrual staining (IRR at 95% CI: 1.31 (1.10, 1.57)], emphasizing the health consequences of such communication inequalities. Conclusions Our study highlights the need to address gender and setting-specific communication experiences of adolescents in India, a patriarchal society. The inequality in communication needs attention as it creates unequal patterns in Indian adolescents’ menstrual health and experiences, which may manifest as inequities in reproductive health-related outcomes even in their adult-lives."
https://openalex.org/W2980558910,"The western flower thrips Frankliniella occidentalis (Thysanoptera: Thripidae) is a major insect pest on a wide range of crops throughout the world. There are several unexplained aspects of the mating behaviour, particularly in relation to male-male competition and mate choice. The objectives of the study were to test whether males can detect the mating status of females and whether males avoid mating with previously mated females. Experiments involved either 'experienced' adults taken from a laboratory culture, which had been exposed to high densities of thrips, or virgin adults reared individually. Experienced males mated readily with virgin females, but avoided mating with experienced females. Virgin males showed much less discrimination between females. Avoidance of mating with experienced females is likely to be widespread because it occurred in populations from both the United Kingdom and Kenya. Experienced males also mated with dead virgin females, but avoided mating with dead experienced females, which ruled out the possibility that behavioural differences between the females were responsible. To test whether males could detect whether or not females had mated, virgin females of the same age from the same cohort were either mated once or not mated. Experienced males mated with the dead females that were virgin and avoided mating with the dead females that differed only in that they had mated once shortly before. This showed that males recognise whether or not a female has mated and avoid mating with previously mated females. This avoidance by males suggests that mated females are not usually subjected to high levels of male harassment. The most likely explanation of the avoidance is that males produce an antiaphrodisiac pheromone that is applied to females during mating."
https://openalex.org/W2980595151,"Triatomines are the vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent of Chagas disease. Although Triatoma and Rhodnius are the most-studied vector genera, other triatomines, such as Panstrongylus, also transmit T. cruzi, creating new epidemiological scenarios. Panstrongylus has at least 13 reported species but there is limited information about its intraspecific genetic variation and patterns of diversification. Here, we begin to fill this gap by studying populations of P. geniculatus from Colombia and Venezuela and including other epidemiologically important species from the region. We examined the pattern of diversification of P. geniculatus in Colombia using mitochondrial and nuclear ribosomal data. Genetic diversity and differentiation were calculated within and among populations of P. geniculatus. Moreover, we constructed maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference phylogenies and haplotype networks using P. geniculatus and other species from the genus (P. megistus, P. lignarius, P. lutzi, P. tupynambai, P. chinai, P. rufotuberculatus and P. howardi). Using a coalescence framework, we also dated the P. geniculatus lineages. The total evidence tree showed that P. geniculatus is a monophyletic species, with four clades that are concordant with its geographic distribution and are partly explained by the Andes orogeny. However, other factors, including anthropogenic and eco-epidemiological effects must be investigated to explain the existence of recent geographic P. geniculatus lineages. The epidemiological dynamics in structured vector populations, such as those found here, warrant further investigation. Extending our knowledge of P. geniculatus is necessary for the accurate development of effective strategies for the control of Chagas disease vectors."
https://openalex.org/W2981170008,"Background The risk of obesity is determined by complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors. Little research to date has investigated the interaction between gene and food intake. The aim of the current study is to explore the potential effect of fat mass and obesity-associated protein gene (FTO) rs9939609 and rs9930506 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) on the pattern of food intake in the Emirati population. Methods Adult healthy Emirati subjects with Body mass index (BMI) of 16–40 kg/m2 were included in the study. Genotyping for FTO rs9939609(A>T) and rs9930506(A>G) was performed using DNA from saliva samples. Subjects were categorized according to the WHO classification by calculating the BMI to compare different classes. Dietary intake was assessed by a sixty-one-item FFQ that estimated food and beverage intakes over the past year. The daily energy, macronutrient, and micronutrient consumption were computed. Results We included 169 subjects in the final analysis (mean age 30.49± 9.1years, 57.4% females). The mean BMI of the study population was 26.19 kg/m2. Both SNPs were in Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium. The rs9939609 AA genotype was significantly associated with higher BMI (p = 0.004); the effect was significant in females (p = 0.028), but not in males (p = 0.184). Carbohydrate intake was significantly higher in AA subjects with a trend of lower fat intake compared to other genotypes. The odds ratio for the AA was 3.78 in the fourth quartile and 2.67 for the A/T in the second quartile of total carbohydrate intake, considering the first quartile as a reference (95% CI = 1.017–14.1 and 1.03–6.88, respectively). Fat intake was significantly lower in the FTO rs9930506 GG subjects. The presence of FTO rs9930506 GG genotype decreased the fat intake in subjects with FTO rs9939609 AA (p = 0.037). Conclusions The results of this study highlight the interaction of the FTO risk alleles on the food intake in Emirati subjects. The FTO rs9939609 AA subjects had higher carbohydrate and lower fat intake. The latter was accentuated in presence of rs9930506 GG genotype."

The aim of this study is to summarize the main characteristics of the measles resurgence that occurred in Serbia in 2014-2015. The national surveillance data on measles was analysed in relation to the clinical, epidemiological and laboratory data. Between November 2014 and December 2015 a measles resurgence with 420 cases was observed in Serbia. Measles virus was initially introduced by and spread among citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina with temporary residence in Serbia, before spreading to the resident population. Of the 223 patients with available medical records, 173 (77.6%) were unvaccinated. The overall measles incidence during the outbreak was 5.8/100.000. The highest age-specific incidence rate was recorded in children aged ≤4 years (25.9/100.000), but most cases (67.9%) were ≥20 years old. Hospitalization rate was high (32.9%) and included two cases of encephalitis associated with measles. In total, 42 health-care workers and 22 related cases including hospitalized patients (n = 13) contracted measles. The overall percentage of laboratory confirmed cases was 81.7% (n = 343/420). All measles virus sequences except one (D9) belonged to genotype D8, suggesting interruption of transmission after the previous outbreak in 2010-2011 caused by genotype D4 viruses. The growing number of adult patients as compared to previous epidemics, suggests an urgent need for supplementary immunization activities targeting susceptible health care workers, unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated adults as well as people without vaccination records. The comprehensive investigation of the 2014/2015 measles resurgence will contribute to decisions about appropriate countermeasures to stop the future measles resurgences in Serbia."
https://openalex.org/W2981055696,"Background During recent 20 years, enterovirus 71 (EV71) has emerged as a major concern among children, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. To understand current EV71 serostatus, to find risk factors associated with EV71 infection and to establish future EV71 vaccine policy, we performed a seroepidemiology study in Taiwan in 2017. Methods After informed consent was obtained, we enrolled preschool children, 6–15-year-old students, 16–50-year-old people. They received a questionnaire and a blood sample was collected to measure the EV71 neutralization antibody. Results Altogether, 920 subjects were enrolled with a male-to-female ratio of 1.03. The EV71 seropositive rate was 10% (8/82) in infants, 4% (6/153) in 1-year-old children, 8% (7/83) in 2-year-old children, 8% (13/156) in 3–5-year-old children, 31% (38/122) in 6–11-year-old primary school students, 45% (54/121) in 12–15-year-old high school students and 75% (152/203) in 16-50-year-old people. Risk factors associated with EV71 seropositivity in preschool children were female gender, having siblings, more siblings, and contact with herpangina or hand-foot-and-mouth disease. The risk factor with EV71 seropositivity in 16–50-year-old people was having children in their families in addition to older age (p<0.001). Compared with the rates in 1997, 1999 and 2007, the rates in children were significantly lower in 2017. Conclusion EV71 seropositive rates were very low, at 4% to 10%, in preschool children and not high, at 31%, in primary school students. Preschool children are highly susceptible and need EV71 vaccine most."

This protein has a major role in different inflammatory disease and various types of cancers. In current study we aimed to evaluate the structural and thermodynamic changes of the subunits and the complex in presence of sodium and calcium ions using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Therefore, the residue interaction network (RIN) was visualized in Cytoscape program. In next step, to measure the binding free energy, the potential of mean force (PMF) method was performed. Finally, the molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MMPBSA) method was applied as an effective tool to calculate the molecular model affinities. The MD simulation results of the subunits represented their structural changes in presence of Ca2+. Moreover, the RIN and Hydrogen bond analysis demonstrated that cluster interactions between Calprotectin subunits in presence of Ca2+ were greater in comparison with Na+. Our findings indicated that the binding free energy of the subunits in presence of Ca2+ was significantly greater than Na+. The results revealed that Ca2+ has the ability to induce structural changes in subunits in comparison with Na+ which lead to create stronger interactions between. Hence, studying the physical characteristics of the human proteins could be considered as a powerful tool in theranostics and drug design purposes."
https://openalex.org/W2981058654,"Introduction Cotrimoxazole (Sulfamethoxazole-Trimethoprim, SXT) has interesting characteristics for the treatment of bone and joint infection (BJI): a broad spectrum of activity with adequate bone diffusion and oral and intravenous formulations. However, its efficacy and safety in BJIs are poorly documented and its use remains limited. Methods We conducted a retrospective study in 2 reference centers for BJIs from 2013 to 2018 among patients treated with SXT for a BJI. Data were collected from patient’s medical charts. Outcomes and adverse events were evaluated at day (D)7, D45 and D90. Results We analyzed 51 patients with a mean age of 60 ± 20 (SD) years of which 76% presented with an orthopedic device infection (ODI). Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) were involved in 47% of BJIs (n = 24). Moreover, they were often polymicrobial infections (41%). Doses of SXT ranged from 800/160mg bid (61%; n = 31) to 800/160mg tid (39%; n = 20). Median SXT treatment duration was 45 days (IQR 40–45). SXT was part of a dual therapy in 84% of patients (n = 43), associated mainly with fluoroquinolones (n = 17) or rifampicin (n = 14). Outcome was favorable at D7 in 98% (n = 50), at D45 in 88.2% (n = 45) and at D90 in 78.4% (n = 40). The second agent combined with SXT was not an independent factor of favorable outcome (p = 0.97). Adverse events were reported in 8% (n = 4) of patients, with a median of 21 days (IQR 20–30) from SXT initiation and led to discontinuation (n = 3). Conclusion SXT appears to be effective for treatment of BJIs as a salvage therapy, even in GNB or polymicrobial infection, including ODI. Further data are needed to confirm SXT efficacy as an alternative oral regimen in BJIs."
https://openalex.org/W2980674509,"On January 2014 approximately 10,000 gallons of crude 4-Methylcyclohexanemethanol (MCHM) and propylene glycol phenol ether (PPH) were accidentally released into the Elk River, West Virginia, contaminating the tap water of around 300,000 residents. Crude MCHM is an industrial chemical used as flotation reagent to clean coal. At the time of the spill, MCHM's toxicological data were limited, an issue that has been addressed by different studies focused on understanding the immediate and long-term effects of MCHM on human health and the environment. Using S. cerevisiae as a model organism we study the effect of acute exposure to crude MCHM on metabolism. Yeasts were treated with MCHM 550 ppm in YPD for 30 minutes. Polar and lipid metabolites were extracted from cells by a chloroform-methanol-water mixture. The extracts were then analyzed by direct injection ESI-MS and by GC-MS. The metabolomics analysis was complemented with flux balance analysis simulations done with genome-scale metabolic network models (GSMNM) of MCHM treated vs non-treated control. We integrated the effect of MCHM on yeast gene expression from RNA-Seq data within these GSMNM. A total of 215 and 73 metabolites were identified by the ESI-MS and GC-MS procedures, respectively. From these 26 and 23 relevant metabolites were selected from ESI-MS and GC-MS respectively, for 49 unique compounds. MCHM induced amino acid accumulation, via its effects on amino acid metabolism, as well as a potential impairment of ribosome biogenesis. MCHM affects phospholipid biosynthesis, with a potential impact on the biophysical properties of yeast cellular membranes. The FBA simulations were able to reproduce the deleterious effect of MCHM on cellular growth and suggest that the effect of MCHM on ubiquinol:ferricytochrome c reductase reaction, caused by the under-expression of CYT1 gene, could be the driven force behind the observed effect on yeast metabolism and growth."
https://openalex.org/W2981055117,"Introduction Preterm infants make up the majority of the 9 million babies born in Africa and South Asia requiring supplemental feedings as they transition to exclusive breastfeeding. The World Health Organization recommends the use of a cup to feed newborns with breastfeeding difficulties in low-resource settings. We set out to evaluate the Nifty cup, a new feeding cup designed specifically for infants with breastfeeding difficulties. Materials and methods We conducted a randomized clinical trial in Ghana. We hypothesized infants would prefer the Nifty cup and that it would have less spillage as compared to a medicine cup. We enrolled mothers and preterm infants with breastfeeding difficulties indicated to cup feed at Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital. Each mother-infant pair used the Nifty cup and a standard medicine cup; and two feeding assessments with each cup were conducted. We employed an intent-to-treat analysis comparing cup preference using a Wilcoxon signed rank test and spillage using generalized estimating equations. Results We enrolled 200 mothers and 237 infants. Many infants were very low birth weight (62%), less than two weeks old (62%), and multiple birth (29%). In response to separate questions about each cup, more mothers reported liking the Nifty cup a lot as compared to the medicine cup (85% versus 57%, p<0.001). When asked to choose between the two cups, more than 75% preferred the Nifty cup (p < 0.001). There was slightly less spillage with the Nifty cup (8.9%) versus the medicine cup (9.3%), which was not statistically significant (p = 0.35). Mothers reported greater confidence and ease of using the Nifty cup and greater use one-month post-discharge compared to the medicine cup (p-values <0.001). Nearly all mothers were breastfeeding and cup feeding their infants at study initiation and at one-month post-discharge. Discussion This is the first randomized clinical trial of cup feeding in sub-Saharan Africa. Mothers prefer the Nifty cup to a medicine cup for supplemental feeds to their preterm infant. The Nifty cup was used with greater ease and confidence. The Nifty cup can offer an improved feeding experience for the mother-infant pair."
https://openalex.org/W2980343282,"Population variation in disease and other phenotype are partly attributed to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the human genome. Due to selection pressure, two individuals from the same ancestral population have more genetic similarity compared to individuals from further geographic regions. Here, we elucidated the genomic population differentiation pattern, by interrogating >22,000,000 SNPs. Majority of population-differentiated (pd) SNPs (~95%), including the potentially functional (pf) (~84%) subset reside in non-genic regions, compared to the proportion of all SNPs (58%) found in non-genic regions. This suggests that differences between populations are more likely due to differences in gene regulation rather than protein function. Actin Cytoskeleton, Axonal Guidance and Protein Kinase A signaling pathways are enriched with genes carrying at least three pdSNPs (enriched pdGenes), while Antigen Presentation, Hepatic Fibrosis and Huntington Disease Signalling pathways are over-represented by enriched pf-pdGenes. An inverse correlation between chromosome size and the proportion of pd-/pf-pdSNPs was observed. Smaller chromosomes have relatively more of such SNPs including genes carrying these SNPs. Genes associated with common diseases and enriched with these pd-/pfpdSNPs are localized to 11 different chromosomes, with immune-related disease pd/pf-pdGenes mainly residing in chromosome 6 while neurological disease pd/pf-pdGenes residing in smaller chromosomes including chromosome 21/22. The associated diseases were reported to show population differences in incidence, severity and/or etiology. In summary, this study highlights the non-sporadic nature of population differentiation footprint in the human genome, which can potentially lead to the identification of genomic regions that play roles in the manifestation of phenotypic differences, including in disease predisposition and drug response."
https://openalex.org/W2980872852,"Chronic pain can pose a serious challenge in everyday life for many individuals globally, especially in developing countries, but studies explicitly exploring risk factors of chronic pain beyond demographic characteristics using survey data have been scarce. To address this problem, this study analyzed World Health Organization data on chronic pain in Ukraine to explore demographic, psychological, and treatment perception-related risk factors to chronic pain. We replicated previous reports of older age, female sex, married status, inadequate financial resources, and comorbidity of other physical conditions as significant demographic risk factors for chronic pain diagnosis but not necessarily for severe pain. We also found evidence for psychological risk factors and treatment perceptions as significant predictors for chronic pain diagnosis and its severity. These results provide a first step in examining beyond demographic risk factors for chronic pain diagnosis and severity and, instead, assessing potential psychological risk factors."
https://openalex.org/W2980947222,"Purpose Analyze associations between patients’ characteristics and treatment factors with 30-day unplanned readmissions in hospitalized otolaryngology patients in the German Diagnosis Related Group (D-DRG) system. Methods A retrospective cohort study was performed on 15.271 otolaryngology admissions of 12.859 patients in 2015 in Thuringia, Germany. The medical records of the 1173 cases (7.6%) with readmission within 30-days were analyzed in detail. Results The 30-day readmission was planned in 747 cases (4.9%) and was unplanned in 422 cases (2.8%). The median interval between primary and next inpatient treatment was 11 days. The principal diagnosis was the same as during the primary index treatment in 72% of the cases. The most frequent reasons for readmission were: Need for non-surgical therapy (31.2%), need for further surgery (26.3%), post-surgical complaints (16.9%), and recurrence of primary complaints (10.7%). The multivariate analysis revealed that discharge due to patient’s request against medical advice was a strong independent factor with high risk for unplanned readmission (Odds Ratio [OR] = 9.62]; confidence interval [CI] = 2.69–34.48). Surgery at index admission (OR = 3.33; CI = 1.86–5.96) was the second important independent risk factor for unplanned readmission. Unplanned readmission had more frequently a non-surgical treatment at readmission than a surgical treatment (OR = 3.92; CI = 2.24–6.84) and needed more frequently further diagnostics (OR = 2.34; CI = 1.34–4.11). The following index International Classification of Diseases (ICD) categories had the highest risk for unplanned readmission: Injury, poisoning and certain other consequences of external causes, ICD: S00-T98 (OR = 66.67; CI = 15.87–333.33), symptoms, signs, abnormal findings, ill-defined causes, not otherwise classified, ICD: R00-R99 (OR = 62.5; CI = 11.76–333.33), blood forming organ diseases, ICD: D50-D90 (OR = 21.276; CI = 3.508–125), and eye/ ear diseases, ICD: H00-H95 (OR = 12.66; CI = 4.29–37.03). Conclusions The causes of unplanned 30-day readmission in German otolaryngology inpatients are multifactorial. Specific patient and treatment characteristics were identified to be targeted with health care interventions to decrease unplanned readmissions."
https://openalex.org/W2981238665,"Studies of voice recognition in biology suggest that long exposure may not satisfactorily represent the voice acquisition process. The current study proposes that humans can acquire a newly familiar voice from brief exposure to spontaneous speech, given a personally engaging context. Studies have shown that arousing and emotionally engaging experiences are more likely to be recorded and consolidated in memory. Yet it remains undemonstrated whether this advantage holds for voices. The present study examined the role of emotionally expressive context in the acquisition of voices following a single, 1-minute exposure by comparing recognition of voices experienced in engaging and neutral contexts at two retention intervals. Listeners were exposed to a series of emotionally nuanced and neutral videotaped narratives produced by performers, and tested on the recognition of excerpted voice samples, by indicating whether they had heard the voice before, immediately and after a one-week delay. Excerpts were voices from exposed videotaped narratives, but utilized verbal material taken from a second (nonexposed) narrative provided by the same performer. Overall, participants were consistently able to distinguish between voices that were exposed during the video session and voices that were not exposed. Voices experienced in emotional, engaging contexts were significantly better recognized than those in neutral ones both immediately and after a one-week delay. Our findings provide the first evidence that new voices can be acquired rapidly from one-time exposure and that nuanced context facilitates initially inducting new voices into a repertory of personally familiar voices in long-term memory. The results converge with neurological evidence to suggest that cerebral processes differ for familiar and unfamiliar voices."
https://openalex.org/W2981257761,"Reports have indicated the effect of myopic blur on postural stability. The objective of this study was to investigate the minimum refractive error to significantly affect postural stability through a various levels of hyperopia and myopia induced by ophthalmic lenses. Forty subjects with a mean age of 22.95 ± 2.21 years were enrolled. In all subjects, the subjective refraction with MPMVA (Maximum to Plus Maximum Visual Acuity) was performed to correct refractive error. To induce hyperopia and myopia, spherical lenses of ±1.0, ±2.0, ±3.0, ±4.0, ±5.0 and ±6.0 D were used on top of the trial frame with corrected condition as MPMVA (eyes-open with MPMVA). Under each induced-refractive error condition, general stability (ST) and sway power (SP) in frequencies by each subsystem were measured with Tetrax posturography with firm plates at patient's upright position, after performed the measurements under the conditions of eyes-open with MPMVA and eyes-closed. ST at eyes-closed was significantly greater than that at eyes-open with MPMVA (p < 0.001). ST was increased significantly for induced hyperopia of -1.0 D (p < 0.001) with decimal visual acuity of 1.07 ± 0.17 and for induced myopia of +3.0 D (p = 0.011) with decimal visual acuity of 0.16 ± 0.09, as compared to that at eyes-open with MPMVA. No significant difference was observed between induced hyperopia of -6.0 D and those at eyes-closed only. SP was increased significantly at low medium-frequencies of the peripheral vestibular signals in induced hyperopia, moreover, hyperopia induced at -6.0 D lenses was significantly different compared to that at eyes-open with MPMVA. Uncorrected low hyperopia in young subjects may lead to postural instability, although they can obtain clear vision. The corrected state of ametropia, especially hyperopia, is a more important factor of appropriate visual input in stable postural adjustment than visual acuity."
https://openalex.org/W2980789606,"Objective The Japanese government has developed and promoted a national nutrient-based dietary guideline for preventing lifestyle-related chronic disease. However, its impact in a real-life setting has never been evaluated. We performed a critical appraisal of the guideline by examining the association between adherence to the guideline and lifestyle-related outcome indicators. Methods This is a retrospective observational cross-sectional study using nationally representative data on health and nutrition characteristics from the 2016 National Health and Nutrition Survey of Japan. We considered 3,861 participants aged ≥20 years, with evidence of low health risks of diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and obesity. Five health outcome indicators (hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and body mass index), were employed. A summary score was developed to reflect adherence to the recommended intake of seven nutrients defined by the guideline, including proteins, fat, saturated fatty acid, carbohydrate, dietary fiber, sodium, and potassium. Multivariate quartile regression approaches were employed to examine the association between the adherence score and the health outcome indicators, adjusting for the covariates. Results Overall, the proportion of those who adhered to the guideline (adherence rate) for all seven nutrients was only 0.3%. There was considerable variation in the adherence rate between the different nutrients, from 24.2% to 61.8%. After adjustment for covariates, in most health outcome indicators, regardless of age category and quartile, there was no clear association between the guideline adherence score and indicators. Conclusions There is plenty of scope for improving the guideline. Nutrient impact on health may not necessarily depend on the amount of each nutrient in the diet. The significance and contribution of synergies between nutrients and complex interactions within foods to health outcomes need to be explored in future guideline updates."
https://openalex.org/W2981306268,"Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes metabolize arachidonic acid to vasoactive eicosanoids such as epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) and 20-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE), whilst soluble epoxide hydrolase, encoded by the EPHX2 gene, is in charge of EETs degradation. We aimed to analyze the influence of common, functional polymorphisms in four genes of the donor on the renal biopsy scores independently assigned by pathologists. Additionally, we examined whether this score or the presence of these SNPs were independent risk factors of clinical outcomes in the first year after grafting. A cohort of 119 recipients and their corresponding 85 deceased donors were included in the study. Donors were genotyped for the CYP4F2 V433M, CYP2C8*3, CYP2J2*7, EPHX2 3'UTR A>G, EPHX2 K55R and EPHX2 R287Q polymorphisms. The association of the donors' SNPs with the biopsy scores and clinical outcomes was retrospectively evaluated by multivariate regression analysis. The CYP2C8*3 polymorphism in the donor was significantly associated with higher scores assigned to pretransplant biopsies [OR = 3.35 (1.03-10.93), p = 0.045]. In turn, higher scores were related to an increased risk of acute rejection [OR = 5.28 (1.32-21.13), p = 0.019] and worse glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (45.68±16.05 vs. 53.04±16.93 ml/min in patients whose grafts had lower scores, p = 0.010) one year after transplant. Patients whose donors carried the CYP4F2 433M variant showed lower eGFR values (48.96±16.89 vs. 55.94±18.62 ml/min in non-carriers, p = 0.038) and higher risk of acute rejection [OR = 6.18 (1.03-37.21), p = 0.047]. The CYP2J2*7 SNP in the donor was associated with elevated risk of delayed graft function [OR = 25.68 (1.52-43.53), p = 0.025]. Our results taken together suggest that donor genetic variability may be used as a predictor of tissue damage in the graft as well as to predict clinical outcomes and graft function in the recipient."
https://openalex.org/W2980734962,"The importance of accounting for social and behavioural processes when studying public health emergencies has been well-recognised. For infectious disease outbreaks in particular, several methods of incorporating individual behaviour have been put forward, but very few are based on established psychological frameworks. In this paper, we develop a decision framework based on the COM-B model of behaviour change to investigate the impact of individual decision-making on public health outcomes. We demonstrate the application of our decision framework in a proof-of-concept case study based on the 2009 A(H1N1) influenza pandemic in the UK. The National Pandemic Flu Service (NPFS) was set up in England during the pandemic as a means to provide antiviral (AV) treatment to clinically ill patients with influenza-like illness, via telephone calls or internet screening, thereby averting the need to see a doctor. The evaluated patients based on a clinical algorithm and authorised AV drugs for collection via community collection points. We applied our behavioural framework to evaluate the influence of human behaviour on AV collection rates, and subsequently to identify interventions that could help improve AV collection rates. Our model was validated against empirically collected pandemic data from 2009 in the UK. We also performed a sensitivity analysis to identify potentially effective interventions by varying model parameters. Using our behavioural framework in a proof-of-concept case study, we found that interventions geared towards increasing people’s ‘Capability’ and ‘Opportunity’ are likely to result in increased AV collection, potentially resulting in fewer influenza-related hospitalisations and deaths. We note that important behavioural data from public health emergencies are largely scarce. Insights obtained from models such as ours can, not only be very useful in designing healthcare interventions, but also inform future data collection."
https://openalex.org/W2980997854,"There is variability as to how archaea catalyze the final step of de novo purine biosynthesis to form inosine 5’-monophosphate (IMP) from 5-formamidoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (FAICAR). Although non-archaea almost uniformly use the bifunctional PurH protein, which has an N-terminal IMP cyclohydrolase (PurH2) fused to a C-terminal folate-dependent aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR) formyltransferase (PurH1) domain, a survey of the genomes of archaea reveals use of PurH2 (with or without fusion to PurH1), the “euryarchaeal signature protein” PurO, or an unidentified crenarchaeal IMP cyclohydrolase. In this report, we present the cloning and functional characterization of two representatives of the known IMP cyclohydrolase families. The locus TK0430 in Thermococcus kodakarensis encodes a PurO-type IMP cyclohydrolase with demonstrated activity despite its position in a cluster of apparently redundant biosynthetic genes, the first functional characterization of a PurO from a non-methanogen. Kinetic characterization reveals a Km for FAICAR of 1.56 ± 0.39 μM and a kcat of 0.48 ± 0.04 s-1. The locus AF1811 from Archaeoglobus fulgidus encodes a PurH2-type IMP cyclohydrolase. This Archaeoglobus fulgidus PurH2 has a Km of 7.8 ± 1.8 μM and kcat of 1.32 ± 0.14 s-1, representing the first characterization of an archaeal PurH2 and the first characterization of PurH2 that naturally occurs unfused to an AICAR formyltransferase domain. Each of these two characterized IMP cyclohydrolases converts FAICAR to IMP in vitro, and each cloned gene allows the growth on purine-deficient media of an E. coli purine auxotroph lacking the purH2 gene."
