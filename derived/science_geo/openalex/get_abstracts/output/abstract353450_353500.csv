https://openalex.org/W2123708888,"Pre-existing neutralizing antibody provides the first line of defence against pathogens in general. For influenza virus, annual vaccinations are given to maintain protective levels of antibody against the currently circulating strains. Here we report that after booster vaccination there was a rapid and robust influenza-specific IgG+ antibody-secreting plasma cell (ASC) response that peaked at approximately day 7 and accounted for up to 6% of peripheral blood B cells. These ASCs could be distinguished from influenza-specific IgG+ memory B cells that peaked 14-21 days after vaccination and averaged 1% of all B cells. Importantly, as much as 80% of ASCs purified at the peak of the response were influenza specific. This ASC response was characterized by a highly restricted B-cell receptor (BCR) repertoire that in some donors was dominated by only a few B-cell clones. This pauci-clonal response, however, showed extensive intraclonal diversification from accumulated somatic mutations. We used the immunoglobulin variable regions isolated from sorted single ASCs to produce over 50 human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that bound to the three influenza vaccine strains with high affinity. This strategy demonstrates that we can generate multiple high-affinity mAbs from humans within a month after vaccination. The panel of influenza-virus-specific human mAbs allowed us to address the issue of original antigenic sin (OAS): the phenomenon where the induced antibody shows higher affinity to a previously encountered influenza virus strain compared with the virus strain present in the vaccine. However, we found that most of the influenza-virus-specific mAbs showed the highest affinity for the current vaccine strain. Thus, OAS does not seem to be a common occurrence in normal, healthy adults receiving influenza vaccination."
https://openalex.org/W2023096418,"Numerous post-translational modifications of histones have been described in organisms ranging from yeast to humans. Growing evidence for dynamic regulation of these modifications, position- and modification-specific protein interactions, and biochemical crosstalk between modifications has strengthened the 'histone code' hypothesis, in which histone modifications are integral to choreographing the expression of the genome. One such modification, ubiquitylation of histone H2B (uH2B) on lysine 120 (K120) in humans, and lysine 123 in yeast, has been correlated with enhanced methylation of lysine 79 (K79) of histone H3 (refs 5-8), by K79-specific methyltransferase Dot1 (KMT4). However, the specific function of uH2B in this crosstalk pathway is not understood. Here we demonstrate, using chemically ubiquitylated H2B, a direct stimulation of hDot1L-mediated intranucleosomal methylation of H3 K79. Two traceless orthogonal expressed protein ligation (EPL) reactions were used to ubiquitylate H2B site-specifically. This strategy, using a photolytic ligation auxiliary and a desulphurization reaction, should be generally applicable to the chemical ubiquitylation of other proteins. Reconstitution of our uH2B into chemically defined nucleosomes, followed by biochemical analysis, revealed that uH2B directly activates methylation of H3 K79 by hDot1L. This effect is mediated through the catalytic domain of hDot1L, most likely through allosteric mechanisms. Furthermore, asymmetric incorporation of uH2B into dinucleosomes showed that the enhancement of methylation was limited to nucleosomes bearing uH2B. This work demonstrates a direct biochemical crosstalk between two modifications on separate histone proteins within a nucleosome."

https://openalex.org/W2085874330,"Head and neck cancer is the fifth most common malignancy and accounts for 3% of all new cancer cases each year. Despite relatively high survival rates, the quality of life of these patients is severely compromised because of radiation-induced impairment of salivary gland function and consequential xerostomia (dry mouth syndrome). In this study, a clinically applicable method for the restoration of radiation-impaired salivary gland function using salivary gland stem cell transplantation was developed. Salivary gland cells were isolated from murine submandibular glands and cultured in vitro as salispheres, which contained cells expressing the stem cell markers Sca-1, c-Kit and Musashi-1. In vitro, the cells differentiated into salivary gland duct cells and mucin and amylase producing acinar cells. Stem cell enrichment was performed by flow cytrometric selection using c-Kit as a marker. In vitro, the cells differentiated into amylase producing acinar cells. In vivo, intra-glandular transplantation of a small number of c-Kit+ cells resulted in long-term restoration of salivary gland morphology and function. Moreover, donor-derived stem cells could be isolated from primary recipients, cultured as secondary spheres and after re-transplantation ameliorate radiation damage. Our approach is the first proof for the potential use of stem cell transplantation to functionally rescue salivary gland deficiency."
https://openalex.org/W1996857104,"The function of pancreatic β-cells is the synthesis and release of insulin, the main hormone involved in blood glucose homeostasis. Estrogen receptors, ERα and ERβ, are important molecules involved in glucose metabolism, yet their role in pancreatic β-cell physiology is still greatly unknown. In this report we show that both ERα and ERβ are present in pancreatic β-cells. Long term exposure to physiological concentrations of 17β-estradiol (E2) increased β-cell insulin content, insulin gene expression and insulin release, yet pancreatic β-cell mass was unaltered. The up-regulation of pancreatic β-cell insulin content was imitated by environmentally relevant doses of the widespread endocrine disruptor Bisphenol-A (BPA). The use of ERα and ERβ agonists as well as ERαKO and ERβKO mice suggests that the estrogen receptor involved is ERα. The up-regulation of pancreatic insulin content by ERα activation involves ERK1/2. These data may be important to explain the actions of E2 and environmental estrogens in endocrine pancreatic function and blood glucose homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2073743133,"Innate immunity represents an important system with a variety of vital processes at the core of many diseases. In recent years, the central role of the Nod-like receptor (NLR) protein family became increasingly appreciated in innate immune responses. NLRs are classified as part of the signal transduction ATPases with numerous domains (STAND) clade within the AAA+ ATPase family. They typically feature an N-terminal effector domain, a central nucleotide-binding domain (NACHT) and a C-terminal ligand-binding region that is composed of several leucine-rich repeats (LRRs). NLRs are believed to initiate or regulate host defense pathways through formation of signaling platforms that subsequently trigger the activation of inflammatory caspases and NF-kB. Despite their fundamental role in orchestrating key pathways in innate immunity, their mode of action in molecular terms remains largely unknown. Here we present the first comprehensive sequence and structure modeling analysis of NLR proteins, revealing that NLRs possess a domain architecture similar to the apoptotic initiator protein Apaf-1. Apaf-1 performs its cellular function by the formation of a heptameric platform, dubbed apoptosome, ultimately triggering the controlled demise of the affected cell. The mechanism of apoptosome formation by Apaf-1 potentially offers insight into the activation mechanisms of NLR proteins. Multiple sequence alignment analysis and homology modeling revealed Apaf-1-like structural features in most members of the NLR family, suggesting a similar biochemical behaviour in catalytic activity and oligomerization. Evolutionary tree comparisons substantiate the conservation of characteristic functional regions within the NLR family and are in good agreement with domain distributions found in distinct NLRs. Importantly, the analysis of LRR domains reveals surprisingly low conservation levels among putative ligand-binding motifs. The same is true for the effector domains exhibiting distinct interfaces ensuring specific interactions with downstream target proteins. All together these factors suggest specific biological functions for individual NLRs."
https://openalex.org/W2030789263,"Half a century ago, the apical ectodermal ridge (AER) at the distal tip of the tetrapod limb bud was shown to produce signals necessary for development along the proximal-distal (P-D) axis, but how these signals influence limb patterning is still much debated. Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) gene family members are key AER-derived signals, with Fgf4, Fgf8, Fgf9 and Fgf17 expressed specifically in the mouse AER. Here we demonstrate that mouse limbs lacking Fgf4, Fgf9 and Fgf17 have normal skeletal pattern, indicating that Fgf8 is sufficient among AER-FGFs to sustain normal limb formation. Inactivation of Fgf8 alone causes a mild skeletal phenotype; however, when we also removed different combinations of the other AER-FGF genes, we obtained unexpected skeletal phenotypes of increasing severity, reflecting the contribution that each FGF can make to the total AER-FGF signal. Analysis of the compound mutant limb buds revealed that, in addition to sustaining cell survival, AER-FGFs regulate P-D-patterning gene expression during early limb bud development, providing genetic evidence that AER-FGFs function to specify a distal domain and challenging the long-standing hypothesis that AER-FGF signalling is permissive rather than instructive for limb patterning. We discuss how a two-signal model for P-D patterning can be integrated with the concept of early specification to explain the genetic data presented here."

https://openalex.org/W2083076780,"Polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases are a class of dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disorders caused by the expansion of a CAG repeat encoding glutamine within the coding region of the respective genes. PolyQ has traditionally been thought to cause neurodegeneration due to protein toxicity. In contrast, pathogenesis in other repeat diseases, such as myotonic dystrophy and fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome, is thought to result from the expression of toxic RNA repeats. Here they provide evidence that pathogenesis caused by ataxin-3, which contains CAG repeats, also involves an RNA-mediated component.

Polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases are a class of dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disorders caused by the expansion of a CAG repeat encoding glutamine within the coding region of the respective genes1. The molecular and cellular pathways underlying polyQ-induced neurodegeneration are the focus of much research, and it is widely considered that toxic activities of the protein, resulting from the abnormally long polyQ tract, cause pathogenesis2,3. Here we provide evidence for a pathogenic role of the CAG repeat RNA in polyQ toxicity using Drosophila. In a Drosophila screen for modifiers of polyQ degeneration induced by the spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) protein ataxin-3, we isolated an upregulation allele of muscleblind (mbl), a gene implicated in the RNA toxicity of CUG expansion diseases4,5,6. Further analysis indicated that there may be a toxic role of the RNA in polyQ-induced degeneration. We tested the role of the RNA by altering the CAG repeat sequence to an interrupted CAACAG repeat within the polyQ-encoding region; this dramatically mitigated toxicity. In addition, expression of an untranslated CAG repeat of pathogenic length conferred neuronal degeneration. These studies reveal a role for the RNA in polyQ toxicity, highlighting common components in RNA-based and polyQ-protein-based trinucleotide repeat expansion diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2034527511,"Cytoplasmic polyhedrosis virus (CPV) is unique within the Reoviridae family in having a turreted single-layer capsid contained within polyhedrin inclusion bodies, yet being fully capable of cell entry and endogenous RNA transcription. Biochemical data have shown that the amino-terminal 79 residues of the CPV turret protein (TP) is sufficient to bring CPV or engineered proteins into the polyhedrin matrix for micro-encapsulation. Here we report the three-dimensional structure of CPV at 3.88 A resolution using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy. Our map clearly shows the turns and deep grooves of alpha-helices, the strand separation in beta-sheets, and densities for loops and many bulky side chains; thus permitting atomic model-building effort from cryo-electron microscopy maps. We observed a helix-to-beta-hairpin conformational change between the two conformational states of the capsid shell protein in the region directly interacting with genomic RNA. We have also discovered a messenger RNA release hole coupled with the mRNA capping machinery unique to CPV. Furthermore, we have identified the polyhedrin-binding domain, a structure that has potential in nanobiotechnology applications."

https://openalex.org/W2117498902,"Aliphatic glucosinolates are compounds which occur in high concentrations in Arabidopsis thaliana and other Brassicaceae species. They are important for the resistance of the plant to pest insects. Previously, the biosynthesis of these compounds was shown to be regulated by transcription factors MYB28 and MYB29. We now show that MYB28 and MYB29 are partially redundant, but in the absence of both, the synthesis of all aliphatic glucosinolates is blocked. Untargeted and targeted biochemical analyses of leaf metabolites showed that differences between single and double knock-out mutants and wild type plants were restricted to glucosinolates. Biosynthesis of long-chain aliphatic glucosinolates was blocked by the myb28 mutation, while short-chain aliphatic glucosinolates were reduced by about 50% in both the myb28 and the myb29 single mutants. Most remarkably, all aliphatic glucosinolates were completely absent in the double mutant. Expression of glucosinolate biosynthetic genes was slightly but significantly reduced by the single myb mutations, while the double mutation resulted in a drastic decrease in expression of these genes. Since the myb28myb29 double mutant is the first Arabidopsis genotype without any aliphatic glucosinolates, we used it to establish the relevance of aliphatic glucosinolate biosynthesis to herbivory by larvae of the lepidopteran insect Mamestra brassicae. Plant damage correlated inversely to the levels of aliphatic glucosinolates observed in those plants: Larval weight gain was 2.6 fold higher on the double myb28myb29 mutant completely lacking aliphatic glucosinolates and 1.8 higher on the single mutants with intermediate levels of aliphatic glucosinolates compared to wild type plants."

https://openalex.org/W2060468671,"Echolocating bats have successfully exploited a broad range of habitats and prey. Much research has demonstrated how time-frequency structure of echolocation calls of different species is adapted to acoustic constraints of habitats and foraging behaviors. However, the intensity of bat calls has been largely neglected although intensity is a key factor determining echolocation range and interactions with other bats and prey. Differences in detection range, in turn, are thought to constitute a mechanism promoting resource partitioning among bats, which might be particularly important for the species-rich bat assemblages in the tropics. Here we present data on emitted intensities for 11 species from 5 families of insectivorous bats from Panamá hunting in open or background cluttered space or over water. We recorded all bats in their natural habitat in the field using a multi-microphone array coupled with photographic methods to assess the bats' position in space to estimate emitted call intensities. All species emitted intense search signals. Output intensity was reduced when closing in on background by 4-7 dB per halving of distance. Source levels of open space and edge space foragers (Emballonuridae, Mormoopidae, Molossidae, and Vespertilionidae) ranged between 122-134 dB SPL. The two Noctilionidae species hunting over water emitted the loudest signals recorded so far for any bat with average source levels of ca. 137 dB SPL and maximum levels above 140 dB SPL. In spite of this ten-fold variation in emitted intensity, estimates indicated, surprisingly, that detection distances for prey varied far less; bats emitting the highest intensities also emitted the highest frequencies, which are severely attenuated in air. Thus, our results suggest that bats within a local assemblage compensate for frequency dependent attenuation by adjusting the emitted intensity to achieve comparable detection distances for prey across species. We conclude that for bats with similar hunting habits, prey detection range represents a unifying constraint on the emitted intensity largely independent of call shape, body size, and close phylogenetic relationships."

IRSp53-induced filopodia formation can be reconstituted in N-WASP KO fibroblasts by full-length N-WASP, by N-WASPΔWA (a mutant unable to activate the Arp2/3 complex), and by N-WASPH208D (a mutant unable to bind Cdc42). IRSp53 failed to induce filopodia in mammalian enabled (Mena)/VASP KO cells, and N-WASP failed to induce filopodia when IRSp53 was knocked down with RNA interference. The IRSp53 I-BAR domain alone induces dynamic membrane protrusions that lack actin and are smaller than normal filopodia (“partial-filopodia”) in both wild-type N-WASP and N-WASP KO cells. We propose that IRSp53 generates filopodia by coupling membrane protrusion through its I-BAR domain with actin dynamics through SH3 domain binding partners, including N-WASP and Mena. The Cdc42 effector IRSp53 is a strong inducer of filopodia formation and consists of an Src homology domain 3 (SH3), a potential WW-binding motif, a partial-Cdc42/Rac interacting binding region motif, and an Inverse-Bin-Amphiphysins-Rvs (I-BAR) domain.We show that IRSp53 interacts directly with neuronal Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASP) via its SH3 domain and furthermore that N-WASP is required for filopodia formation as IRSp53 failed to induce filopodia formation in N-WASP knock-out (KO) fibroblasts.

We propose that IRSp53 generates filopodia by coupling membrane protrusion through its I-BAR domain with actin dynamics through SH3 domain binding partners, including N-WASP and Mena. Filopodia and lamellipodia are ubiquitous and dynamic actin-based structures at the leading edge of cells that play important roles in processes such as cell invasion, cell migration, phagocytosis, and axonal guidance. Thus, understanding how the formation of filopodia and lamellipodia is regulated will give us insight into the fundamental aspects of cell biology and what goes wrong in disease states such as cancer. Work over the last few years has revealed many of the important players involved in cell signaling events that regulate actin dynamics associated with filopodia and lamellipodia formation (1Higgs H.N. Pollard T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 649-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Rho GTPases (e.g. Cdc42, Rac1, and RhoA) are intimately involved in communication between cell surface receptors and proteins that control actin dynamics (2Jaffe A.B. Hall A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 247-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (2377) Google Scholar). Cdc42 is a major regulator of filopodia formation in mammalian cells. The isolation and identification of Cdc42 effectors have opened up the possibility of defining the molecular mechanisms responsible for the regulation and formation of filopodia. To date the Cdc42 effectors N-WASP, 2The abbreviations used are: N-WASP, neuronal Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein; BAR, Bin-Amphiphysin-Rsv domain; CRIB, Cdc42/Rac interacting binding region; I-BAR, inverse-Bin-Amphiphysin-Rsv domain; IMD, IRSp53-MIM homology domain; Mena, mammalian enabled; SH3, Src homology domain 3; GFP, green fluorescent protein; KO, knock-out; WT, wild type; RNAi, RNA interference; oligo, oligonucleotides; ROI, region of interest; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; GST, glutathione S-transferase; FCS, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy; DIC, differential interference contrast; mRFP, monomer red fluorescent protein; KD, knockdown. IRSp53, PAK, and MRCK have been implicated in filopodia formation. In this study we focus on the role of Cdc42 effector IRSp53 and the mechanism by which it induces filopodia formation. The WASP/N-WASP (Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein and neuronal-Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein) and WAVE1-3 (Wasp family verproline-homologue) family protein complexes are major downstream targets for Rho GTPase (3Stradal T.E.

WASP and WAVE proteins are activators of actin nucleation in vitro and adaptor proteins composed of a number of distinct domains as follows: WH1 (WASP Homology 1) and WH2 (WASP Homology 2), a basic stretch binding phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate, and the WA domain (W (verprolin and cofilin) and Acidic region). The latter domain is involved in binding to the Arp2/3 complex (Actin-related proteins 2 and 3). Rac1 interacts directly with one of the proteins present in the WAVE complex, p140 Sra-1, although the function of this interaction is unclear (4Eden S. Rohatgi R. Podtelejnikov A.V. Mann M.

Sobue K. FEBS Lett. 2003; 554: 30-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). IRSp53 has recently been shown to bind the Rac1 exchange factor Tiam1 at a site near the partial-CRIB domain (26Connolly B.A. Rice J. Feig L.A. Buchsbaum R.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 4602-4614Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). IRSp53 has five splice variants, and two of them contain a functional actin monomer binding WH2 domain at the C terminus (27Miyahara A. Okamura-Oho Y. Miyashita T. Hoshika A. Yamada M. J. Hum. Genet. 2003; 48: 410-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 28Okamura-Oho Y. Miyashita T. Yamada M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The SH3 domain of IRSp53 can bind N-WASP directly, and IRSp53 fails to induce filopodia in N-WASP KO fibroblasts (30Lommel S. Benesch S. Rottner K. Franz T. Wehland J. Kuhn R. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 850-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) but does induce lamellipodia formation and membrane ruffling in these cells. In N-WASP reconstitution experiments of N-WASP KO fibroblasts, IRSp53 regains its ability to induce filopodia formation. Intriguingly, the WA domain or the Cdc42-binding site of N-WASP is not required to allow IRSp53 to induce filopodia formation, but the WA domain may play a role in filopodia turnover. IRSp53 also fails to induce filopodia in Mena/VASP KO cells, and N-WASP failed to induce filopodia when IRSp53 was knocked down with RNAi. The I-BAR domain alone induces dynamic membrane protrusions that lack actin and are smaller than normal filopodia (“partial-filopodia”) in both N-WASP WT and N-WASP KO cells. We propose that IRSp53 generates filopodia by coupling membrane protrusion through its I-BAR domain with actin dynamics through proteins, including N-WASP and Mena via its SH3 domain. N1E115 neuroblastoma cells were grown as described in Ref. 11Govind S. Kozma R. Monfries C. Lim L. Ahmed S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 579-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar. The N-WASPflox/flox control fibroblast (WT) and N-WASPdel/del (KO) were derived from N-WASPflox/flox mice prepared on E14 cells and immortalized with retroviruses, resulting in the expression of a temperature-sensitive simian virus 40 large T-antigen. N-WASPdel/del KO cell lines were then selected after transient expression of Cre, with the resulting lineage been comparable with their respective parental precursor lines (see Lommel et al. (30Lommel S. Benesch S. Rottner K. Franz T. Wehland J. Kuhn R. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 850-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) for details of these cells). Mena WT (GMH3.0) and KO (MDV7) cells were cultured as described previously (31Geese M. Loureiro J. Bear J. Wehland J. Gertler F.B. Sechi A.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2383-2396Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected as described in Ref. 11Govind S. Kozma R. Monfries C. Lim L. Ahmed S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 579-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar. CHO-1 cells were obtained from the ATCC (Manassas, VA) and grown in 75-cm2 tissue culture flasks up to 90% confluency in the complete growth media, 1× F-12 Nutrient mixture (Kaighn's modification) media containing 10% fetal bovine serum-qualified and 1% antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin). Transient transfection was performed using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). Cells were plated out at approximately ∼105 cells per glass-bottom dish and grown overnight at 32 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium low with supplements. cDNA of required constructs were prepared at 50 ng/μl in double distilled H2O and centrifuged at 16,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. 6 μl of DNA mix was loaded into a microinjection needle, and cells were injected at a constant pressure of 20 p.s.i. for 100-ms duration. Microinjection was performed on a custom microinjection setup and Olympus microscope (IMT-10). Between 100 and 150 cells were injected per dish, and cells were left to express protein for 1-6 h before they were imaged or fixed and stained. For DIC/fluorescence time-lapse analysis, cells were incubated on a heated stage at 37 °C and imaged with a monochromator on a Zeiss Axiovert 200 microscope enclosed in an incubator with CoolSNAP CCD camera. Generally, images were taken over a period of 10 min at 10-s intervals. The supplemental movies were compiled using the Metamorph software. The IRSp53 oligos and the negative control oligo were obtained from Invitrogen. The oligos were transfected using HiPerfect (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer's protocol. The oligos were transfected at a final concentration of 5 nm. Cells were harvested 27 and 48 h after transfection and lysed for Western blots to determine the level of IRSp53 knockdown. Oligo sequences were as follows: 5′ AUG GUA AGC AGC AGA GUU CUU GGC C 3′,5′ AUU GCU AUU GGC CAU CUG UUG CAU C 3′, and 5′ AUU CAU GAC AGG UAC AUU CUC CUG A 3′. pGEX-GST, pGEX-Cdc42Q61L, and pGEX-IRSp53 proteins (SH3 domain, residues 400-469; ΔSH3, residues 1-295; I-BAR, residues 1-250) were prepared using standard procedures (11Govind S. Kozma R. Monfries C. Lim L. Ahmed S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 579-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). N-WASP and GFP were in vitro transcribed and translated using the TnT T7-coupled reticulocyte lysate systems (Promega, L4610) with pXJ40-N-WASP-HA as the template for N-WASP and pXJ40-GFP as the template for GFP following the manufacturer's protocol. For mRFP-IRSp53, IRSp53 was subcloned from HA-IRSp53 in pXJ40 into mRFP-pXJ40 vector between the BamHI and NotI site. For mRFP-N-WASP, N-WASP was subcloned from HA-N-WASP in pXJ40 into mRFP-pXJ40 vector between the HindIII and NotI site. The 4K mutants were generated using a site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) as per the manufacturer's protocol. The mutants are as follows: (i) IRSp53-4K, (ii) GFP-I-BAR-4K, and (iii) GST-I-BAR-4K. Proteins associated with the SH3 domain of IRSp53 were isolated by affinity purification from lysates of adult rat brain with the GST fusion protein of the SH3 domain of IRSp53 immobilized on Sepharose beads. The protein complex was eluted and resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and detected by colloidal Coomassie Blue (Pierce). Protein bands detected by colloidal Coomassie Blue were excised and subjected to in-gel reduction, S-alkylation, and trypsin hydrolysis. Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis of the peptides was performed on a Finnigan LCQ Deca ion trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Finnigan) fitted with a nanospray source (MDS Proteomics). Chromatographic separation was conducted using a Famos autosampler and an Ultimate gradient system (LC Packings) over Zorbax SB-C18 reverse phase resin (Agilent) packed into 75 μm inner diameter PicoFrit columns (New Objective). Protein identifications were made using the search engines Mascot (Matrix Sciences) and Sonar (ProteoMetrics). 44 peptides were obtained for N-WASP, with 60% coverage of the protein. Yeast two-hybrid analysis was done by mating AH109 and Y187 strains carrying the appropriate plasmids as described in the Clontech manuals. FRET was measured by acceptor photobleaching method (32Herrick-Davis K. Weaver B.A. Grinde E. Mazurkiewicz J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27109-27116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) by making necessary settings in a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope with a C-Apochromat 63 × 1-2-water objective. The fusion proteins of GFP/mRFP were excited using 488 and 561 nm laser line as excitation source, by selecting 405/488/561 dichroic mirror and 490,565 secondary dichroic mirrors for GFP and mRFP emission, respectively. The emission was monitored by selecting GFP (BP 505-550) and Red (LP 575) emission filters to record the fluorescence intensity. ROI was selected and photobleached using 70% of 561 nm laser power by selecting 50 iterations. The increase in GFP fluorescence intensity followed by mRFP bleaching was measured as FRET. FRET efficiency (%FE) was calculated using the change in background subtracted fluorescence intensity as 100 × ((post-bleach intensity) - (pre-bleach intensity)/(post-bleach intensity)). To verify that the change in intensity was not due to artifacts, we obtained the Pearson product moment correlation coefficient r, a dimensionless index that ranges from -1.0 to 1.0 inclusive and reflects the extent of a linear relationship between the two fluorescence intensity data of GFP and mRFP while bleaching. In our case we expect -1.0 as the perfect fitting of the linear relation because during acceptor bleaching donor intensity increases while acceptor intensity decreases. However we selected the range of -0.7 to -1.0 as the best range of index (see supplemental Fig. S1 for details). The GFP/mRFP pair has been used previously to measure FRET (33Peter M. Ameer-Beg S.M.

Morphological phenotypes were quantitated using the following definitions. Filopodia—Protrusions that contain actin are dynamic, with a width of ∼0.6 -1.2 μm and an average length between 6 and 15 μm. The number of filopodia per cell was determined. Lamellipodia/Membrane Ruffling—Lamellipodia/membrane Ruffling are areas of cell flattening/wavy membrane thickening. Each cell was divided into eight sectors, and each sector was assessed for the presence of lamellipodia or membrane ruffling. Each sector contributes a maximum of 12.5% morphological activity. The eight sector values for each cell were then combined to give % lamellipodia/membrane ruffle per cell. Neurite-like Processes—In CHO-1 cells, N-WASP (WT) fibroblasts, and Mena WT fibroblasts, we observed that IRSp53 induced the formation of cell extensions that resemble neurites. Neurite-like processes are defined as cell extensions greater than two cell body lengths. This definition in no way attributes any functional value to these structures and is purely a reflection of morphological similarity to neurites. Filopodia lifetimes were determined by following individual filopodia from appearance from the cell membrane to disappearance. Filopodia assembly is defined as the time taken from appearance to maximum length. Filopodia disassembly is defined as the time taken from maximum length to disappearance. For each experiment ∼6-12 cells were evaluated for filopodia, neurites/neurite-like structures, and lamellipodia/membrane ruffles. At least three independent experiments were carried out for any one set of conditions giving an n value of ∼36. Values presented in bar charts and tables represent mean ± S.D. F-actin bundling was monitored by a sedimentation assay and by visualization of F-actin bundles with fluorescence microscopy as described (14Millard T.H. Bompard G. Heung M.Y. Dafforn T.R. Scott D.J.

For FCS analyses, the fluorescence intensity fluctuations arise from single molecules that are diffusing in and out of a defined confocal volume. Details of the instrumentation and method can be found in Ref. 34Hwang L.C. Wohland T. Chem. Phys. Chem. 2004; 5: 549-551Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar. Filopodia are a ubiquitous but diverse group of cell structures making them difficult to define (35Jacinto, A., and Wolpert, L. (2001) Curr. Biol. 11, R634Google Scholar). However, in mammalian cells filopodia are more homogeneous. In studies examining the ability of the IRSp53 or its I-BAR domain to induce filopodia in mammalian cells, filopodia have not been defined (14Millard T.H. Bompard G. Heung M.Y. Dafforn T.R. Scott D.J. Machesky L.M. Futterer K. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 240-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 15Yamagishi A. Masuda M. Ohki T. Onishi H. Mochizuki N. J. Biol.

Milanesi F. Di Fiore P.P. Ciliberto A. Stradal T.E. Scita G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 1337-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In addition, in most studies on filopodia measurement of filopodial dynamics have not been done, and this makes interpretation and comparison of the data difficult. Thus we felt it important to define mammalian filopodia at the outset and determine which domains of IRSp53 were essential for this activity using dynamic measurements. Definition of Filopodia—To define filopodia more accurately, we measured their formation in a range of mammalian cells. N1E115, HeLa, COS7, and B16F1 cells were transfected with GFP-actin, and by using sequential time-lapse wide field fluorescence/DIC imaging, we scored the protrusions for length and lifetime. Mammalian cell line filopodia are actin-based structures with lengths between 8 and 15 μm and lifetimes between 79 and 142 s (Table 1). In addition, we noticed the following features of filopodia: (i) they have a width between 0.6 and 1.2 μm (see Table 1 legend); (ii) are unbranched; and (iii) rarely protrude together. In contrast to filopodia, retraction fibers are nondynamic, tapered, sometimes branched, and can protrude as clusters. Thus for structures to be designated bona fide filopodia in mammalian cells, they must be dynamic actin-based structures with characteristics similar to those presented in Table 1.TABLE 1Filopodia characteristics of mammalian cellsCell line (endogenous filopodia)Length±S.D.Lifetime±S.D.μmsN1E115157.68142101HeLa148.3413176COS 7105.1212377B16F185.257942cDNA transfectionsCdc42V12/Rac1N17 (N-WASP WT)8.41.5915730IRSp53 (N1E115)6.81.8818738N-WASP (N1E115)7.40.9715420 Open table in a new tab IRSp53-SH3 and I-BAR Domains Are Required for Filopodia Formation—IRSp53 induces filopodia in a Cdc42-dependent manner as a Cdc42-binding mutant IRSp531267N is unable to induce these structures. Induction of filopodia is also significantly reduced in an IRSp53 mutant deleted of its C-terminal domain comprising the SH3 domain (11Govind S. Kozma R. Monfries C. Lim L. Ahmed S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 579-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The C terminus of IRSp53 contains at least three protein binding domains, the SH3 domain, a potential WW domain binding motif, and a PDZ domain binding motif that could be responsible for filopodia formation (Fig. 1). To determine whether the SH3 domain was responsible for the filopodia formation, we compared the phenotypes of wild-type protein with that of IRSp53-FP/AA (an SH3 mutant defective in binding to ligands) using GFP-actin and time-lapse microscopy. Filopodia were scored on the definition outlined above. Filopodia formation was absent in the IRSp53-FP/AA mutant (Fig. 1). The I-BAR domain of IRSp53 has been reported to bundle F-actin, and this activity is reduced by mutation of four lysine residues (142, 143, 146, and 147) that form a potential actin-binding site (14Millard T.H. Bompard G. Heung M.Y. Dafforn T.R. Scott D.J. Machesky L.M. Futterer K. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 240-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Using time-lapse analysis of GFP-actin-transfected cells, we found that the full-length IRSp53-K142E/K143E/K146E/K147E (IRSp53-4K) mutant was unable to induce filopodia (Fig. 1). Thus, three distinct IRSp53 domains are required for filopodia formation as follows: partial-CRIB (11Govind S. Kozma R. Monfries C. Lim L. Ahmed S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 579-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), the SH3, and the I-BAR domain. Krugmann et al. (12Krugmann S. Jordens I. Gevaert K. Driessens M. Vandekerckhove J. Hall A.

https://openalex.org/W2015822383,"Lyssaviruses are RNA viruses with single-strand, negative-sense genomes responsible for rabies-like diseases in mammals. To date, genomic and evolutionary studies have most often utilized partial genome sequences, particularly of the nucleoprotein and glycoprotein genes, with little consideration of genome-scale evolution. Herein, we report the first genomic and evolutionary analysis using complete genome sequences of all recognised lyssavirus genotypes, including 14 new complete genomes of field isolates from 6 genotypes and one genotype that is completely sequenced for the first time. In doing so we significantly increase the extent of genome sequence data available for these important viruses. Our analysis of these genome sequence data reveals that all lyssaviruses have the same genomic organization. A phylogenetic analysis reveals strong geographical structuring, with the greatest genetic diversity in Africa, and an independent origin for the two known genotypes that infect European bats. We also suggest that multiple genotypes may exist within the diversity of viruses currently classified as 'Lagos Bat'. In sum, we show that rigorous phylogenetic techniques based on full length genome sequence provide the best discriminatory power for genotype classification within the lyssaviruses."
https://openalex.org/W2084362596,"RecQ helicases maintain chromosome stability by resolving a number of highly specific DNA structures that would otherwise impede the correct transmission of genetic information. Previous studies have shown that two human RecQ helicases, BLM and WRN, have very similar substrate specificities and preferentially unwind noncanonical DNA structures, such as synthetic Holliday junctions and G-quadruplex DNA. Here, we extend this analysis of BLM to include new substrates and have compared the substrate specificity of BLM with that of another human RecQ helicase, RECQ1. Our findings show that RECQ1 has a distinct substrate specificity compared with BLM. In particular, RECQ1 cannot unwind G-quadruplexes or RNA-DNA hybrid structures, even in the presence of the single-stranded binding protein, human replication protein A, that stimulates its DNA helicase activity. Moreover, RECQ1 cannot substitute for BLM in the regression of a model replication fork and is very inefficient in displacing plasmid D-loops lacking a 3′-tail. Conversely, RECQ1, but not BLM, is able to resolve immobile Holliday junction structures lacking an homologous core, even in the absence of human replication protein A. Mutagenesis studies show that the N-terminal region (residues 1–56) of RECQ1 is necessary both for protein oligomerization and for this Holliday junction disruption activity. These results suggest that the N-terminal domain or the higher order oligomer formation promoted by the N terminus is essential for the ability of RECQ1 to disrupt Holliday junctions. Collectively, our findings highlight several differences between the substrate specificities of RECQ1 and BLM (and by inference WRN) and suggest that these enzymes play nonoverlapping functions in cells.

RecQ helicases are a ubiquitous family of DNA strand-separating enzymes that defend the genome against instability. They derive their name from the prototypical member of the family discovered in Escherichia coli (1Nakayama K. Irino N. Nakayama H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1985; 200: 266-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Since this discovery, many other RecQ helicases have been found in various organisms ranging from prokaryotes to mammals (2Cobb J.A. Bjergbaek L.

Five members of the RecQ family have been found in human cells: BLM, RECQ1 (also known as RECQL or RECQL1), RECQ4, RECQ5, and WRN (4Hickson I.D. Nat. Rev.

Mutations in the genes encoding RECQ4, BLM, and WRN are responsible for distinct genetic disorders, named Rothmund-Thomson syndrome, Bloom's syndrome, and Werner's syndrome, respectively (7Ellis N.A.

Although these disorders are all associated with inherent genomic instability and cancer predisposition, they show distinct clinical features, suggesting that these three enzymes are involved in different DNA metabolic pathways. For example, Werner's syndrome patients show typical premature aging features, such as premature graying and thinning of hair, osteoporosis and cataracts, whereas Bloom's syndrome is unique among cancer predisposition syndromes in that Bloom's syndrome patients are predisposed to the development of most types of cancers. Rothmund-Thomson syndrome individuals are characterized by skin and skeletal abnormalities as well as an increase in cancer incidence, predominantly osteosarcoma. Mutations in the RECQ1 and RECQ5 genes may be responsible for additional cancer predisposition disorders that are distinct from Rothmund-Thomson syndrome, Bloom's syndrome, and Werner's syndrome, but this remains to be proven. In this regard, interesting candidates are patients with a phenotype similar to that of Rothmund-Thomson syndrome individuals who do not carry any mutations in the RECQ4 gene. Moreover, recent studies have linked a single nucleotide polymorphism present in the RECQ1 gene to a reduced survival in pancreatic cancer patients (10Li D. Frazier M. Evans D.B. Hess K.R. Crane C.H.

A property common to all RecQ helicases is their ability to unwind DNA structures other than conventional B-form DNA duplexes. In particular, several RecQ enzymes, including BLM and WRN, preferentially unwind G-quadruplex DNA and synthetic X-junctions that model the Holliday junction recombination intermediate (20Constantinou A.

Although some differences in substrate specificity between the human, lower eukaryotic, and prokaryotic RecQ enzymes have been described, little is known about the differences that may distinguish the activity of the five human enzymes (27Bachrati C.Z. Hickson I.D. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 577-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). A comparative analysis of the substrate specificity of human RecQ helicases can provide valuable insights into the molecular basis of the different cellular functions of these enzymes.A previous study showed that BLM and WRN have similar activity toward a panel of model DNA substrates of different structure and length, suggesting that, at least for these two enzymes, differences in helicase substrate specificity are not a fundamental distinguishing feature for defining their specific role in cellular DNA metabolism (23Mohaghegh P. Karow J.K. Brosh Jr., R.M. Bohr V.A. Hickson I.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2843-2849Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). In this study, we compared the substrate specificity of RECQ1 and BLM using a number of substrates of different structure and length, including substrates that have not been analyzed previously for either RECQ1 or BLM. Our findings highlight several differences between the enzymatic properties of RECQ1 and BLM and suggest that the role of RECQ1 in the maintenance of genome stability is distinct from that of BLM. The possible functions of these RecQ helicases in human cells are discussed.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProteins—Recombinant His6-tagged RECQ1 and BLM were expressed and purified following previously described procedures (28Cui S. Arosio D. Doherty K.M. Brosh Jr., R.M. Falaschi A. Vindigni A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 2158-2170Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 29Karow J.K. Newman R.H. Freemont P.S. Hickson I.D. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 597-600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The RECQ1-(57–649) cDNA was PCR-amplified with a forward primer containing an NheI site at the 5′-end and a reverse primer containing a XhoI site at the 5′-end. RECQ1-(57–649) cDNA was then cloned into NheI and XhoI sites of a pET-28a(+) vector (Novagen), and the insert was excised using XbaI and XhoI in order to add the His6 tag at the N terminus. The cDNA with the additional sequence for the His6 tag was subcloned into the pFastBac1 vector using XbaI and XhoI. To obtain mutant RECQ1-(1–579), a termination codon after residue 579 was created by QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). For the experiments with the untagged RECQ1, the His6 tag sequence was removed by digestion with thrombin (1:500 ratio) for 3 h at 4 °C in a buffer of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm KCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The sample was then incubated with the TALON metal affinity resin (Clontech) for 2 h at 4 °C. The flow-through containing the untagged RECQ1 was collected and concentrated using a Vivaspin filter (Vivascience). The experiments with untagged BLM were performed with a truncated variant of the protein, BLM-(642–1290), expressed and purified from E. coli following previously described procedures (30Janscak P.

Biol. 2003; 330: 29-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar).DNA Substrates—All of the oligonucleotides used in this study are listed in Table 1. For each substrate, a single oligonucleotide was 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. The kinase reaction was performed in PNK buffer (70 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol) at 37 °C for 1 h. [γ32P]ATP-labeled oligonucleotides were then annealed to a 1.4-fold excess of the unlabeled complementary strands in annealing buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl) by heating at 95 °C for 6 min and then cooling slowly to room temperature. The purification of the forked duplex substrates was performed using Micro Bio-Spin columns (Bio-Rad) or ProbeQuant G-50 Micro columns (Amersham Biosciences). The G4 and G2′ DNA substrates carrying the consensus repeat from the murine immunoglobulin Sγ2b switch region or the Oxytricha telomeric repeat sequence were prepared as described previously (24Sun H.

The Holliday junction substrates were purified using Sepharose-4B columns (Amersham Biosciences). The plasmid-based D-loop substrates were generated by RecA-mediated strand invasion of oligonucleotides DL3, DLm, and DL5 into pUC18 and were purified as described previously (32Bachrati C.Z.

Methods Enzymol. 2006; 409: 86-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). For the RNA-DNA heteroduplex, the radiolabeled rDL30m RNA oligonucleotide was annealed to pUCbottom in a 1:1.2 molar ratio, as described (33Bachrati C.Z. Hickson I.D. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 409: 86-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and was used without purification. For the oligonucleotide-based R-loop, the RNA-DNA heteroduplex was further annealed to pUCtop in a 1:1.2 molar ratio and used without purification. The plasmid-based fork regression substrate was prepared as described previously by Ralf et al. (34Ralf C. Hickson I.D. Wu L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 22839-22846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Briefly, the pG68 and pG46 plasmids that contain an array of BbvCI restriction endonuclease recognition sites were nicked by N.BbvC IA and N.BbvC IB, respectively. The two plasmids were annealed to create a paranemic joint, which was converted to a plectonemic joint by DNA topoisomerase I treatment to create the RF substrate molecule. The RF1 molecule was radiolabeled on the 3′ end using [α-32P]TTP and Klenow enzyme.TABLE 1Sequence of oligonucleotides used for the substrate preparationNumberNameSequence (5′-3′)1Fork 30 (U)GAACGAACACATCGGGTACGTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT2Fork 30 (D)TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTCGTACCCGATGTGTTCGTTC3Fork 8 (U)GAACGAACACATCGGGTACGTTTTTTTT4Fork 8 (D)TTTTTTTTCGTACCCGATGTGTTCGTTC5G4-TPTGGACCAGACCTAGCAGCTATGGGGGAGCTGGGGAAGGTGGGAATGTGA6G4-TP20TGGACCAGACCTAGCAGCTATGGGGGAGCTGGGGAAGGTGGGAATGTGATTTTTTTTTTTTT7OX-1TACTGTCGTACTTGATATTTTGGGGTTTTGGGGAATGTGA8X12-1GACGCTGCCGAATTCTGGCTTGCTAGGACATCTTTGCCCACGTTGACCCG9X12-2CGGGTCAACGTGGGCAAAGATGTCCTAGCAATGTAATCGTCTATGACGTC10X12-3GACGTCATAGACGATTACATTGCTAGGACATGCTGTCTAGAGACTATCGC11X12-4GCGATAGTCTCTAGACAGCATGTCCTAGCAAGCCAGAATTCGGCAGCGTC12X0-1TGGGTGAACCTGCAGGTGGGCAAAGATGTCCTAGCAATGTAATCGTCAAGCTTTATGCCGTT13X0-2GACGCTGCCGAATTCTACCAGTGCCAGCGACGGACATCTTTGCCCACCTGCAGGTTCACCC14X0-3CAACGGCATAAAGCTTGACGATTACATTGCTACATGGAGCTGTCTAGAGGATCCGACTATCGA15X0-4ATCGATAGTCGGATCCTCTAGACAGCTCCATGATCACTGGCACTGGTAGAATTCGGCAGCGT16rDL30mGAGAGUGCACCAUAUGCGGUGUGAAAUACC17pUCbottomCGAATGGCGCCTGATGCGGTATTTTCTCCTTACGCATCTGTGCGGTATTTCACACCGCATATGGTGCACTCTCAGTACAATCTGCTCTGATGCCGCATAGTTAAGCCAGCCCCGAC18pUCtopGTCGGGGCTGGCTTAACTATGCGGCATCAGACGTAGCTTGTGATTCTAGGTGGACTCGAGGTGCCCAGCAGGTATGCGAAGGATGAAGGAGAAAATACCGCATCAGGCGCCATTCG19DL3AATTCTCATTTTACTTACCGGACGCTATTAGCAGTGGCAGATTGTACTGAGAGTGCACCATATGCGGTGTGAAATACCGCACAGATGCGT20DLmGCAGATTGTACTGAGAGTGCACCATATGCGGTGTGAAATACCGCACAGATGCGT21DL5GCAGATTGTACTGAGAGTGCACCATATGCGGTGTGAAATACCGCACAGATGCGTTAGAAGCGTTATTCTCTGGGCGAATAGAGTGCTATC Open table in a new tab DNA Helicase Assays—Helicase assays were performed in 20 μl of a reaction mixture containing buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 8 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 80 μg/ml bovine serum albumin), 5 mm ATP, and 32P-labeled helicase substrate (0.5 nm). These buffer and substrate concentrations were used in all unwinding assays, except where stated. For the G-quadruplex substrates, reactions were performed in buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin) using 5 mm ATP and 30 nm 32P-labeled helicase substrate, as described previously (25Sun H.

The experiments with the plasmid-based D-loops, the RNA-DNA hybrids, and the R-loops were carried out in a 10-μl reaction volume in buffer C (33 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.8), 1 mm MgCl2, 66 mm sodium acetate, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm ATP). When RNA-based molecules were used as substrates, RNase inhibitor (New England Biolabs) was added to the reaction to a final concentration of 2 units/μl. Recombinant RecQ helicase protein (RECQ1 or BLM) was added to a concentration indicated in the figures, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for the times specified in the figure legends. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 20 μl of 0.4 m EDTA pH 8.0, 10% glycerol (quench solution). Reaction products were resolved using 10% native PAGE, and the extent of unwinding was quantified as described previously (28Cui S. Arosio D. Doherty K.M. Brosh Jr., R.M. Falaschi A. Vindigni A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 2158-2170Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Fork regression assays were carried out as described previously (34Ralf C. Hickson I.D. Wu L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 22839-22846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar).ATPase and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—The ATPase and DNA binding assays were performed using procedures described previously (28Cui S. Arosio D. Doherty K.M. Brosh Jr., R.M. Falaschi A. Vindigni A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 2158-2170Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The rate of ATP hydrolysis was measured using thin layer chromatography assays. Reactions included different DNA probes at the concentrations indicated in the figure legends and 20 nm RECQ1 or BLM in buffer A. The electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed in buffer B with various protein concentrations using 30 nm G-quadruplex DNA.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe unusual ability of BLM and WRN to unwind cruciform and G-quadruplex DNA structures provides useful insights into the possible biological function(s) of these enzymes (23Mohaghegh P. Karow J.K. Brosh Jr., R.M. Bohr V.A. Hickson I.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2843-2849Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). The present study extends these observations, providing the first comparative analysis of the substrate specificity of RECQ1 and BLM (and by extension WRN). A series of oligonucleotide- and plasmid-based DNA substrates with different structures and lengths was generated to compare the substrate specificities of RECQ1 and BLM (Table 2). Initial experiments using forked duplex substrates with an ssDNA 3The abbreviations used are: ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; nt, nucleotide(s); hRPA, human replication protein A; HJ, Holliday junction(s). tail of 30 or 8 nt confirmed that both enzymes were catalytically active and were able to unwind fork-like structures with an ssDNA tail of ≥8 nt (supplemental Fig. 1) (data not shown). The similar specific activity of RECQ1 and BLM toward the forked duplex substrate was used to standardize each preparation of enzyme for the unwinding experiments using other DNA substrates. Moreover, all experiments were repeated using at least two independent preparations of each enzyme and under identical reaction conditions to minimize any possible interexperimental variation. An untagged version of RECQ1 was also used to exclude any possible contribution of the His6 tag in determining the substrate specificity of RECQ1 (supplemental Fig. 2). The results were consistent with our previous finding that His6-tagged and untagged RECQ1 have identical ATPase, unwinding, and strand annealing activities (35Muzzolini L. Beuron F. Patwardhan A. Popuri V. Cui S. Niccolini B. Rappas M. Freemont P.S. Vindigni A. PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: e20Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Regarding BLM, previous studies have already demonstrated that a bacterially expressed (not His6-tagged) truncated variant of BLM, BLM-(642–1290), has the same substrate specificity as the full-length His6-tagged BLM isolated from yeast cells toward various linear duplexes, fork substrates, and Holliday junction structures (30Janscak P. Garcia P.L. Hamburger F. Makuta Y. Shiraishi K. Imai Y. Ikeda H. Bickle T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 29-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). This result was also confirmed with some of the substrates used in this work (supplemental Fig. 2).TABLE 2Substrate specificity of RECQ1 and BLM Open table in a new tab G-quadruplex DNA; a Putative Role of RecQ Helicases in the Removal of G4 DNA Structures from Ribosomal Gene Clusters, Immunoglobulin Heavy Chain Switch Regions, or Telomeric Repeats—Although G-DNA structures have not been unequivocably observed in vivo, the ease of formation of G-DNA in vitro suggests that G4 DNA structures probably exist at least transiently in cells (31Sen D. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 211: 191-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In particular, G-rich regions are abundant in ribosomal DNA gene clusters, in the immunoglobulin heavy chain switch regions, and within telomeric repeats. Although the complementary strand of a duplex would normally protect the G-rich strand from interstrand G-G pairing, cellular processes that promote DNA duplex unwinding, such as replication, transcription, or recombination, generate transient single-stranded DNA stretches that would allow G-quadruplex formation. Previous studies indicated that BLM and WRN could efficiently unwind G-quadruplex DNA substrates (21Fry M. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12797-12802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 23Mohaghegh P. Karow J.K. Brosh Jr., R.M. Bohr V.A. Hickson I.D.

Our experiments using different concentrations of BLM confirm this finding (Fig. 1A). Surprisingly, given that BLM, WRN, Sgs1, and E. coli RecQ can all unwind G-quadruplex substrates (23Mohaghegh P.

The same set of experiments was repeated using a G4 DNA substrate with a 3′-tail of 20 nt, with very similar negative results, indicating that the length of the tail does not affect the ability of RECQ1 to unwind this kind of DNA structure (Fig. 1, C and D). Again, BLM is able to disrupt this structure (Fig. 1, C and D). We also prepared aG2′ DNA substrate, containing the Oxytricha telomeric repeat sequence and a tail of 7 nt at the 3′-end, to test if RECQ1 could unwind this kind of G-quadruplex formed by two antiparallel hairpin dimers (24Sun H. Bennett R.J. Maizels N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1978-1984Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that RECQ1 is unable to unwind G2′ DNA substrates (data not shown). In contrast, BLM can also efficiently unwind this substrate even at a protein concentration 200-fold lower than the highest concentration of RECQ1 used in these unwinding experiments (data not shown).FIGURE 1Analysis of the unwinding activity of RECQ1 and BLM using G-quadruplex substrates.

The calculated kinetic constant (kcat) values for the ATP hydrolysis reactions catalyzed by BLM using G4 or ssDNA probes as DNA co-factors are 260 ± 10 and 330 ± 10 min–1, respectively (Fig. 2A). The equivalent values for RECQ1 are 25 ± 2 and 91 ± 2 min–1, respectively. These results suggest that the inability of RECQ1 to unwind this particular kind of DNA structure might be, at least partially, related to its poor ability to hydrolyze ATP in the presence of G-quadruplexes. Our gel mobility shift experiments showed, however, that RECQ1 efficiently binds G4 substrates with either a 7- or 20-nt 3′-tail with an affinity similar to that measured for the BLM protein (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that binding of RECQ1 to G4 DNA may not trigger the same conformational change necessary for the stimulation of the ATPase activity that is likely to take place with the BLM helicase.FIGURE 2ATPase and DNA binding assays using G4 DNA.

https://openalex.org/W2085207827,"DNA hypermethylation is a common epigenetic abnormality in cancer and may serve as a useful marker to clone cancer-related genes as well as a marker of clinical disease activity. To identify CpG islands methylated in prostate cancer, we used methylated CpG island amplification (MCA) coupled with representational difference analysis (RDA) on prostate cancer cell lines. We isolated 34 clones that corresponded to promoter CpG islands, including 5 reported targets of hypermethylation in cancer. We confirmed the data for 17 CpG islands by COBRA and/or pyrosequencing. All 17 genes were methylated in at least 2 cell lines of a 21-cancer cell line panel containing prostate cancer, colon cancer, leukemia, and breast cancer. Based on methylation in primary tumors compared to normal adjacent tissues, NKX2-5, CLSTN1, SPOCK2, SLC16A12, DPYS and NSE1 are candidate biomarkers for prostate cancer (methylation range 50%–85%). The combination of NSE1 or SPOCK2 hypermethylation showed a sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 95% in differentiating cancer from normal. Similarly NKX2-5, SPOCK2, SLC16A12, DPYS and GALR2 are candidate biomarkers for colon cancer (methylation range 60%–95%) and GALR2 hypermethylation showed a sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 95%. Finally, SLC16A12, GALR2, TOX, SPOCK2, EGFR5 and DPYS are candidate biomarkers for breast cancer (methylation range 33%–79%) with the combination of EGFR5 or TOX hypermethylation showing a sensitivity of 92% and specificity of 92%. Expression analysis for eight genes that had the most hypermethylation confirmed the methylation associated silencing and reactivation with 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine treatment. Our data identify new targets of transcriptional silencing in cancer, and provide new biomarkers that could be useful in screening for prostate cancer and other cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2059999434,"Previous studies have shown two homologous chromodomain modules in the HP1 and Polycomb proteins exhibit discriminatory binding to related methyllysine residues (embedded in ARKS motifs) of the histone H3 tail. Methylated ARK(S/T) motifs have recently been identified in other chromatin factors (e.g. linker histone H1.4 and lysine methyltransferase G9a). These are thought to function as peripheral docking sites for the HP1 chromodomain. In vertebrates, HP1-like chromodomains are also present in the chromodomain Y chromosome (CDY) family of proteins adjacent to a putative catalytic motif. The human genome encodes three CDY family proteins, CDY, CDYL, and CDYL2. These have putative functions ranging from establishment of histone H4 acetylation during spermiogenesis to regulation of transcription co-repressor complexes. To delineate the biochemical functions of the CDY family chromodomains, we analyzed their specificity of methyllysine recognition. We detected substantial differences among these factors. The CDY chromodomain exhibits discriminatory binding to lysine-methylated ARK(S/T) motifs, whereas the CDYL2 chromodomain binds with comparable strength to multiple ARK(S/T) motifs. Interestingly, subtle amino acid changes in the CDYL chromodomain prohibit such binding interactions in vitro and in vivo. However, point mutations can rescue binding. In support of the in vitro binding properties of the chromodomains, the full-length CDY family proteins exhibit substantial variability in chromatin localization.

Nature. 2005; 437: 100-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The Y chromosomes are believed to be enriched in genes essential for spermatogenesis and testis development. Interstitial Y chromosome deletions are associated with spermatogenic failure and male infertility (1Lahn B.T. Page D.C.

One gene that is present in multiple copies on the human Y chromosome is CDY, 5The abbreviations used are: CDY, chromodomain Y chromosome; ECH, enoyl-coenzyme A hydratase/isomerase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; MBP, maltose-binding protein. 5The abbreviations used are: CDY, chromodomain Y chromosome; ECH, enoyl-coenzyme A hydratase/isomerase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; MBP, maltose-binding protein. which exhibits testis-specific expression (1Lahn B.T. Page D.C. Science. 1997; 278: 675-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the mouse Y chromosome does not encode CDY, suggesting a developmentally advanced usage of CDY in primates (3Hughes J.F. Skaletsky H. Pyntikova T. Minx P.J. Graves T. Rozen S. Wilson R.K. Page D.C. Nature. 2005; 437: 100-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar).The human CDY gene seems to be derived from the autosomal homologs CDYL or CDYL2 (Fig. 1, A and B) (6Dorus S. Gilbert S.L. Forster M.L. Barndt R.J. Lahn B.T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 1643-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). CDYL is ubiquitously expressed, whereas CDYL2 exhibits selective expression in tissues of testis, prostate, spleen, and leukocytes (6Dorus S. Gilbert S.L. Forster M.L. Barndt R.J. Lahn B.T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 1643-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The mouse genome also encodes related CDYL and CDYL2 genes (Fig. 1B). The presence of CDY-like genes appears to be a hallmark of echinoderm and vertebrate genomes. In sea urchin and chicken genomes we found only one CDY-like gene that corresponds to mammalian CDYL2 (Fig. 1B).CDY family proteins have two conserved domains implicated in histone modification and recognition; that is, a chromodomain followed by an enoyl-coenzyme A hydratase/isomerase (ECH) putative catalytic domain (Fig. 1A). Previously, it was shown that the chromodomain of human CDY interacts with methylated lysine 9 of the histone H3 tail (H3K9me) (7Kim J. Daniel J. Espejo A. Lake A. Krishna M. Xia L. Zhang Y. Bedford M.T. EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 397-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). The ECH domain has been implicated in conflicting chromatin modification processes. One function of this domain is acetylation of germ line histone H4 (8Lahn B.T. Tang Z.L. Zhou J. Barndt R.J. Parvinen M. Allis C.D. Page D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8707-8712Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Another function is direct recruitment of histone deacetylases to sites within somatic cells (9Caron C. Pivot-Pajot C. van Grunsven L.A. Col E. Lestrat C. Rousseaux S. Khochbin S. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 877-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar).Epigenetic control of gene expression hinges on effecter recognition modules that help establish appropriate methyllysine-dependent interactions with chromatin (for review, see Ref. 10Kouzarides T. Cell. 2007; 128: 693-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7924) Google Scholar). The HP1 and Polycomb chromodomains (Fig. 1B), which are similar to the chromodomains of CDY family proteins, distinguish two methylated lysine residues within ARKS motifs in the H3 tail (H3K9me and H3K27me) (11Jacobs S.A. Khorasanizadeh S. Science. 2002; 295: 2080-2083Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar, 12Fischle W. Wang Y. Jacobs S.A. Kim Y. Allis C.D. Khorasanizadeh S.

Sequences immediately preceding the ARK(S/T) motif impact on the specificity of chromodomain interactions. HP1 chromodomains are subject to a binary methyl-phos switch as they are prohibited from interaction with H3K9me3 upon phosphorylation of the adjacent serine 10 in the H3 tail (H3S10ph) (17Fischle W. Tseng B.S. Dormann H.L. Ueberheide B.M. Garcia B.A. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Funabiki H. Allis C.D. Nature. 2005; 438: 1116-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar, 18Hirota T. Lipp J.J.

Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 2842-2851Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar).Additional complexity in epigenetic control arises from usage of histone variants. For example, substitutions of histone H3 with variants results in indexing of chromatin for transcriptional activation or repression (22Mito Y. Henikoff J.G. Henikoff S. Science. 2007; 315: 1408-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 23Henikoff S. Ahmad K. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 133-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), and an H3 barcode hypothesis has been proposed (24Hake S.B. Allis C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 6428-6435Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). In human testis, three somatic histone H3 variants (H3.1, H3.2, and H3.3) are encoded together with a testis-specific subtype (H3t) (25Govin J. Caron C. Rousseaux S. Khochbin S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 357-359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These variants have no amino acid changes N-terminal to the ARKS motifs, except in the H3t subtype. Although mass spectrometry has identified in vivo methylation of H3tK27 (26Ong S.E. Mittler G. Mann M. Nat. Meth. 2004; 1: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar), an effector binding module has not yet been reported. Another lysine-methylated ARKS motif is found in the N-terminal tail of a linker histone H1 subtype in humans (H1.4K26) (27Garcia B.A. Busby S.A. Barber C.M. Shabanowitz J. Allis C.D. Hunt D.F. J. Proteome Res. 2004; 3: 1219-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 28Kuzmichev A. Jenuwein T. Tempst P. Reinberg D. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 183-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar).An ARKT mimic of H3K9me has also been identified in the lysine methyltransferase G9a (G9aKme), suggesting a broader usage of ARK(S/T) motifs in human epigenetic signaling (29Henkels C.H. Khorasanizadeh S. Mol. Cell. 2007; 27: 521-522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 30Sampath S.C. Marazzi I. Yap K.L. Sampath S.C. Krutchinsky A.N. Mecklenbrauker I. Viale A. Rudensky E. Zhou M.M. Chait B.T. Tarakhovsky A. Mol. Cell. 2007; 27: 596-608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The G9aKme is targeted by the HP1 chromodomain in one transcriptional co-repressor complex (30Sampath S.C. Marazzi I. Yap K.L. Sampath S.C. Krutchinsky A.N. Mecklenbrauker I. Viale A. Rudensky E. Zhou M.M. Chait B.T. Tarakhovsky A. Mol. Cell. 2007; 27: 596-608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the human CDYL protein was also found associated with G9aKme in pulldown experiments from cellular extracts.Because methylation of lysine residues within numerous ARK(S/T) motifs appears to orchestrate complex epigenetic pathways (for review, see Refs. 29Henkels C.H. Khorasanizadeh S. Mol. Cell. 2007; 27: 521-522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 32Ooi S.L. Henikoff S. Curr. Opin.

Nature. 2007; 447: 407-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (2126) Google Scholar), determining the specificity of effectors may be a paradigm for understanding epigenetic signaling. Using a series of in vitro and cell-based assays, we studied the biochemical specificity of the chromodomains in the CDY family proteins. Our studies reveal a surprising variability in discriminatory interactions of CDY and CDYL2 chromodomains with methylated ARK(S/T) motifs.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAntibodies—Polyclonal antibodies specific for H3K9me3 were a gift from Dr. Thomas Jenuwein (IMP Vienna). The monoclonal antibody against mouse HP1α was obtained from Chemicon, and the monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody was purchased from Sigma.Peptide Preparation—The sequences of the synthetic peptides corresponding to histone tails are listed below. A non-native tyrosine residue at the C terminus of each peptide was used for concentration determination by UV absorption measurements. Peptides were labeled with fluorescein as previously described (13Jacobs S.A. Fischle W. Khorasanizadeh S.

Full-length CDY and CDYL2 were cloned into a modified pMAL vector (New England Biolabs) for expression as MBP-His fusion proteins (details are available upon request). To generate C-terminal epitope-tagged constructs for the transient expression of full-length human CDY and human CDYL, we used PCR amplification with reverse primers containing the sequence encoding for the FLAG and hemagglutinin peptides (for details, see Ref. 47Fischle W. Kiermer V. Dequiedt F. Verdin E. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 79: 337-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). cDNAs were cut with the appropriate restriction enzymes and cloned into the BamHI/XbaI sites of the pcDNA3.1+ vector (Invitrogen). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed according to the QuikChange protocol (Stratagene).Fluorescence Polarization Binding Assays—Fusion proteins with the N-terminal His tag were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) (Novagen) and purified by Ni2+-affinity chromatography (Qiagen) and gel filtration chromatography (Superdex 75 resin, GE Healthcare). N-terminal MBP-His fusion proteins of full-length CDY and CDYL2 were expressed in BL21 RIL (Novagen) and purified consecutively on maltose and nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resins. Protein concentrations were determined by absorbance spectroscopy using predicted extinction coefficients (for CDY chromodomain ϵ280 = 19,750 m-1cm-1; for MBP-His-CDY ϵ280 = 113,000 m-1cm-1; for CDYL chromodomain ϵ280 = 15,200 m-1cm-1; for CDYL2 chromodomain ϵ280 = 20,910 m-1cm-1; for MBP-His-CDYL2 ϵ280 = 126,000 m-1cm-1). Peptide concentrations were determined using absorbance spectroscopy (extinction coefficient for tyrosine, ϵ280 = 1280 m-1cm-1; extinction coefficient for fluoresceinated peptides ϵ492 = 68,000 m-1cm-1). Fluorescence polarization binding assays were performed under conditions of 20 mm imidazole, pH 8.0, 25 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol and in the presence of 100 nm fluorescein-labeled peptide following a previously described protocol (13Jacobs S.A. Fischle W. Khorasanizadeh S. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 376: 131-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Data were obtained using a Teacan Polarion 96-well plate reader or a Hidex Chameleon II plate reader (100 flashes). Sample plates were kept on ice until fluorescence reading at room temperature. Titration binding curves were analyzed using Kaleida-Graph (Synergy Software) as previously described (13Jacobs S.A. Fischle W. Khorasanizadeh S. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 376: 131-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments were carried out as described previously using a VP-ITC instrument (MicroCal) (13Jacobs S.A. Fischle W. Khorasanizadeh S. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 376: 131-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Chromodomains of CDY or HP1 were dialyzed against 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 25 mm NaCl, and 2 mm dithiothreitol. Peptides were purified by gel filtration in water (G10 resin, GE Healthcare), lyophilized, and dissolved in the chromodomain dialysis buffer. Exothermic heats of reaction (μcal/s) were measured at the indicated temperatures by automated sequencing of 30 injections of the H3 peptides (750 μm), each 10 μl, spaced at 2-min intervals, into 1.41 ml of chromodomain (CDY at 60 μm; HP1 at 70 μm). Binding curves were analyzed by non-linear least squares fitting of the data using the Origin (MicroCal) software package.Cell Transfection—NIH3T3 (American Cell Culture Collection) and mouse embryonic fibroblast (a kind gift of Dr. Thomas Jenuwein, IMP Vienna) cells were grown at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere, 5% CO2 using Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine. Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 as instructed by the manufacturer (Invitrogen).Immunofluorescence—For immunofluorescence staining, cells were grown and transfected on glass coverslips. 48 h post-transfection, cells were fixed in solution I (1× PBS, 3.7% formaldehyde, 1% Triton X-100, 2% Nonidet P-40) for 10 min and then washed in 1× PBST (PBS, 1% Triton X-100) for 3 × 10 min. Slides were blocked for 1 h (1× PBST, 5% goat serum, 2% bovine serum albumin) and incubated with the indicated primary antibodies overnight in a humidified atmosphere. Dilutions for primary antibodies were anti-H3K9me3 (1:1500), anti-HP1α (1:2000), and anti-FLAG (1:500). Slides were washed in 1×PBST for 3 × 10 min and incubated with the appropriate secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes, Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 2 h in a humidified atmosphere. After washing in 1× PBST, DNA was stained with DAPI (1 μg/ml) for 10 s. Pictures were taken on a Leica SP5 confocal microscope or a Zeiss Axiopod II both equipped with 60× lenses.RESULTSVariability in Binding to H3 Methylated on Lys-9—The CDY class of chromodomains exhibits high homology to HP1 and Polycomb chromodomains (Fig. 1B). Three aromatic residues were shown to be necessary for assembling a methyllysine binding aromatic cage in HP1 and Polycomb chromodomains (11Jacobs S.A. Khorasanizadeh S. Science. 2002; 295: 2080-2083Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar, 12Fischle W. Wang Y. Jacobs S.A. Kim Y. Allis C.D. Khorasanizadeh S. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1870-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar, 16Hughes R.M. Wiggins K.R. Khorasanizadeh S. Waters M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 11184-11188Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the chromodomains of the CDYL proteins do not have the first aromatic cage residue, suggesting substantial difference in the function of this factor. A three-dimensional structure corresponding to the chromodomain of CDYL2 has been deposited in the protein data bank (PDB accession code 2dnt). We prepared a superposition of the CDYL2 structure with the peptide-bound structure of the HP1 chromodomain involving an H3K9me3 peptide (11Jacobs S.A. Khorasanizadeh S. Science. 2002; 295: 2080-2083Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C). This comparison established that CDYL2 and, by homology, CDY and CDYL chromodomains, despite a moderate sequence identity (∼42%), have tertiary structures similar to HP1. Whereas HP1 and Polycomb chromodomains are 50-residue modules, the CDY family chromodomains are 55-residue modules containing a longer C-terminal α-helix (Fig. 1B). Previously, binding of the CDY chromodomain to H3K9me2 and H3K9me3 peptides was identified through protein microarray analysis (7Kim J. Daniel J. Espejo A. Lake A. Krishna M. Xia L. Zhang Y. Bedford M.T. EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 397-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar).To determine the specificity and affinity for methylated histone lysine residues among the three CDY family members, recombinant chromodomains of CDY, CDYL, and CDYL2 were expressed in bacteria and purified. Because the CDYL chromodomain has an incomplete aromatic cage plus an N-terminal extension (Fig. 1, A and B), we prepared a recombinant construct that included the N terminus of the protein together with the chromodomain module. Recombinant proteins were used in fluorescence polarization assays to measure equilibrium binding to fluoresceinated synthetic peptides corresponding to the histone H3 tail. The binding data are shown in Fig. 1D, and the dissociation constants are listed in Table 1. In accordance with sequence prediction and the presence of an incomplete aromatic cage, we measured no binding of the CDYL chromodomain to H3K9me3 (KD > 500 μm). Surprisingly, we measured a substantial difference in the dissociation constants associated with CDY and CDYL2. The interaction of the CDY chromodomain with the H3K9me3 peptide is 8-fold stronger than that of CDYL2. The results confirm subtle sequence differences among CDY family chromodomains, impacting on their interaction with methylated histone tails. The binding studies potentially implicate each CDY family member as part of distinct chromatin modification pathways.TABLE 1Dissociation constants (μm) measured by fluorescence polarization for CDY family chromodomains interacting with synthetic peptides as described under “Experimental Procedures”PeptideCDYCDYLCDYL2H3 Lys-9 Unmodified∼300>500>500 H3K4me3∼300>500>500 H3K9ac∼300>500>500 H3K9me13.4 ± 0.5>50067 ± 10 H3K9me20.7 ± 0.1>5008.9 ± 1.1 H3K9me30.5 ± 0.1452 ± 813.9 ± 0.5 H3K4me2K9me20.9 ± 0.2∼50011.0 ± 2.1 H3K9me3S10ph38 ± 4>500>500H3 Lys-27 Unmodified>500>500>500 H3K27ac>500>500>500 H3K27me1∼300113 ± 15 H3K27me2119 ± 3718.4 ± 3.1 H3K27me376 ± 11>50012.4 ± 1.2 H3K27me3S28ph>500>500Testis H3 Lys-27 H3tK27me37.5 ± 0.8∼5002.6 ± 0.4 H1.4 Lys-26 Unmodified>500>500>500 H1.4K26me310 ± 1∼5002.2 ± 0.4G9a Lys-185 Unmodified185 ± 17>500>500 G9a-K185me136 ± 9>500108 ± 27 G9a-K185me30.6 ± 0.2∼5004.9 ± 1.2 Open table in a new tab To compare the binding affinity of the chromodomain constructs with that of the full-length proteins, we prepared recombinant full-length CDY and CDYL2 (Fig. 2) and measured binding to the H3K9me3 peptide by fluorescence polarization (Fig. 2). As observed for the chromodomain fragments, the full-length CDY protein displayed a significantly stronger binding (by 10-fold) compared with the full-length CDYL2 protein. These results reveal the chromodomain of CDY and CDYL2 are able to bind to methylated ARK(S/T) motifs autonomously.FIGURE 2Interaction with methylated lysine residues is an intrinsic property of CDY family proteins. A, interaction of recombinant full-length human CDY and mouse CDYL2 proteins fused to MBP with an H3K9me3 or the corresponding unmodified peptide as measured by fluorescence polarization. Averages from at least three independent measurements are plotted. B, recombinant MBP fusion proteins used for the measurements in panel A were run on SDS-PAGE gels and stained with Coomassie Blue. Arrows indicate the MBP-CDY and MBP-CDYL2 recombinant proteins. Major degradation products co-purifying with the recombinant proteins are indicated. Molecular weight (MW) markers are shown on the left.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Distinct in Vivo Distribution of CDY, CDYL, and CDYL2 Proteins—Given the CDYL chromodomain does not bind to the H3K9me3 peptide and the CDY chromodomain binds more avidly than the CDYL2 chromodomain, we investigated the in vivo localization of these proteins in relation to heterochromatin in mammalian systems. We made use of mouse fibroblast cells (NIH3T3 and MEF cells) that show a distinct pattern of DNA-dense, pericentromeric heterochromatin regions in the nucleus. These coincide with local enrichment of H3K9me3 modification. The distribution of CDY family proteins in these cells was compared using transiently expressed fusion constructs that encode their full-length polypeptides with a C-terminal FLAG tag. As Fig. 3 shows, all three fusion proteins displayed an exclusively nuclear distribution (see also supplemental Fig. S1).FIGURE 3Differential nuclear distribution of CDY family proteins. FLAG-tagged human CDY (A), human CDYL (B), or mouse CDYL2 (C) were transiently expressed in NIH3T3 cells. Immunostaining with anti-FLAG-specific antibodies (green) and anti-H3K9me3 (red)-specific antibodies was analyzed by confocal microscopy. The merged image corresponds to the overlay of the two color channels. Yellow areas indicate colocalization sites for CDY family proteins with H3K9me3 modification. Cells of medium expression level representative for the nuclear distribution of the CDY family proteins are shown (see supplemental Fig. S1 for more images). DNA inside the cell nucleus was stained with DAPI and defines areas of high DNA density that are presumed to be heterochromatic.

Although the transiently expressed CDYL protein was also excluded from the nucleoli, CDYL showed a diffuse distribution pattern that never overlapped with regions of H3K9me3 (Figs. 3B and supplemental Fig. S2B). Interestingly, the CDYL2 protein was found throughout the nucleus in a punctate distribution pattern with pronounced cell-to-cell variation. Whereas some nuclei displayed granular staining of CDYL2, others showed larger areas of CDYL2 enrichment (Figs. 3C and supplemental Fig. S3C). Although CDYL2 enrichment at DAPI dense regions was less pronounced as compared with CDY, all cells analyzed exhibited some CDYL2 co-localized with regions of H3K9me3. Together, these observations underscore substantial differences in chromatin recognition and binding of the CDY family proteins.CDY and CDYL2 Are Differentially Sensitive to the Degree of Lysine Methylation—The level of methylation (mono-, di-, or trimethylation) of lysine residues in histone tails is important for chromatin regulation (10Kouzarides T.

We, therefore, measured the binding affinities of CDY and CDYL2 as a function of the methylation level on H3K9. Previous studies as well as data listed in Table 2 indicate that the HP1 chromodomain exhibits 2–3-fold reduced interaction with H3K9me2 peptide as compared with H3K9me3 peptide, whereas the binding to H3K9me1 peptide is substantially weaker. We found CDYL2 to resemble these features in HP1 (Table 1). However, the CDY chromodomain showed 20-fold stronger binding to H3K9me1 as compared with CDYL2. Interestingly, the binding of CDY to the H3K9me1 peptide is as efficient as the binding of CDYL2 or HP1 to the H3K9me3 peptide (Tables 1 and 2).TABLE 2Thermodynamic parameters for binding to H3 peptides methylated on"
https://openalex.org/W2080305969,"Background A highly sensitive, rapid and cost efficient method that can detect active botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) in complex biological samples such as foods or serum is desired in order to 1) counter the potential bioterrorist threat 2) enhance food safety 3) enable future pharmacokinetic studies in medical applications that utilize BoNTs. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we describe a botulinum neurotoxin serotype A assay with a large immuno-sorbent surface area (BoNT/A ALISSA) that captures a low number of toxin molecules and measures their intrinsic metalloprotease activity with a fluorogenic substrate. In direct comparison with the “gold standard” mouse bioassay, the ALISSA is four to five orders of magnitudes more sensitive and considerably faster. Our method reaches attomolar sensitivities in serum, milk, carrot juice, and in the diluent fluid used in the mouse assay. ALISSA has high specificity for the targeted type A toxin when tested against alternative proteases including other BoNT serotypes and trypsin, and it detects the holotoxin as well as the multi-protein complex form of BoNT/A. The assay was optimized for temperature, substrate concentration, size and volume proportions of the immuno-sorbent matrix, enrichment and reaction times. Finally, a kinetic model is presented that is consistent with the observed improvement in sensitivity. Conclusions/Significance The sensitivity, specificity, speed and simplicity of the BoNT ALISSA should make this method attractive for diagnostic, biodefense and pharmacological applications."
https://openalex.org/W1976416185,"Type III secretion (TTS) is an essential virulence function for Shigella flexneri that delivers effector proteins that are responsible for bacterial invasion of intestinal epithelial cells. The Shigella TTS apparatus (TTSA) consists of a basal body that spans the bacterial inner and outer membranes and a needle exposed at the pathogen surface. At the distal end of the needle is a ""tip complex"" composed of invasion plasmid antigen D (IpaD). IpaD not only regulates TTS, but is required for the recruitment and stable association of the translocator protein IpaB at the TTSA needle tip in the presence of deoxycholate or other bile salts. This phenomenon is not accompanied by induction of TTS or the recruitment of IpaC to the Shigella surface. We now show that IpaD specifically binds fluorescein-labeled deoxycholate and, based on energy transfer measurements and docking simulations, this interaction appears to occur where the N-terminal domain of IpaD meets its central coiled-coil, a region that may also be involved in needle-tip interactions. TTS is initiated as a series of distinct steps and that small molecules present in the bacterial milieu are capable of inducing the first step of TSS through interactions with the needle tip protein IpaD. Furthermore, the amino acids proposed to be important for deoxycholate binding by IpaD appear to have significant roles in regulating tip complex composition and pathogen entry into host cells."

At the appropriate heme iron concentrations under normal conditions, HRI function is suppressed by binding of the heme iron.

The molecular mechanism of heme sensing by HRI, including identification of the specific binding site, remains to be established.

In contrast, heme-induced inhibition of Cys-409 mutants of the isolated kinase domain and N-terminal-truncated proteins was substantially weaker than that of the full-length enzyme. A pulldown assay disclosed heme-dependent interactions between the N-terminal and kinase domains.

Eukaryotic cells decrease their overall rates of protein synthesis for survival in response to a variety of stress conditions, such as shortage of amino acids, UV light illumination, virus infection, and accumulation of denatured proteins. Much of the decrease in protein synthesis is caused by phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) 4The abbreviations used are: eIF2α, eukaryotic initiation factor 2α; HRI, heme-regulated eIF2α kinase or heme-regulated inhibitor; Fe(III) complex, hemin or Fe(III)-protoporphyrin IX complex; Fe(II) complex, Fe(II)-protoporphyrin IX complex; Δ145, an N-terminal-truncated mutant where amino acids 1–145 of the full-length HRI were truncated, and amino acids 146–619 remained; KD, isolated kinase domain with amino acids 146–243 linked with those 361–619; NTD, isolated N-terminal domain with amino acids 1–138. at Ser-51 by eIF2α kinases that respond specifically to stress (1Wek R.C.

Heme-regulated eIF2α kinase or heme-regulated inhibitor (HRI) is a member of the eIF2α kinase family that controls globin synthesis in response to the heme concentration in reticulocytes (5Chen J.J.

Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 9894-9905Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). HRI is inactive at normal heme concentrations. Under conditions of heme deficiency, the enzyme is activated by autophosphorylation and subsequently phosphorylates eIF2α at Ser-51. In addition to globin, HRI controls the synthesis of tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase and cytochrome P450 2B in liver upon acute porphyria (9Han X.M. Lee G. Hefner C. Maher J.J. Correia M.A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2005; 314: 128-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 10Liao M. Pabarcus M.K. Wang Y. Hefner C. Maltby D.A. Medzihradszky K.F. Salas-Castillo S.P. Yan J. Maher J.J. Correia M.A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2007; 323: 979-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Thus, HRI is possibly one of the most important existing heme sensor protein families for eukaryote survival in response to cell emergency states. Heme-responsive/sensing proteins, also known as “heme sensor proteins” are a current focus of investigation. In these proteins heme association (or dissociation) per se regulates various important physiological functions, such as transcription, proteolysis, and kinase activity (11Igarashi J. Kitanishi K. Martinkova M. Murase M. Iizuka A. Shimizu T. Acta Chim. Slov. 2008; 55: 67-74Google Scholar). The heme-sensing (or binding) sites of most heme sensor proteins constitute the Cys thiolate group. Cys thiolate coordination to the Fe(III)-protoporphyrin IX complex (hemin) is weaker than that of the well characterized His coordination, as observed for hemoglobin. Because axial ligand switching from thiolate to nitrogen occurs easily upon heme reduction from Fe(III) to Fe(II) complexes, redox-dependent ligand switching, in addition to response to the Fe(III) complex concentration, appears to regulate the physiological functions of heme sensor proteins (11Igarashi J. Kitanishi K. Martinkova M. Murase M. Iizuka A. Shimizu T. Acta Chim. Slov. 2008; 55: 67-74Google Scholar). A heme regulatory motif containing a Cys-Pro sequence (CP motif) is possibly critical for heme binding by heme-sensing proteins (11Igarashi J. Kitanishi K. Martinkova M. Murase M. Iizuka A. Shimizu T. Acta Chim. Slov. 2008; 55: 67-74Google Scholar). The heme-sensing mechanism of HRI hitherto reported is briefly summarized as follows. Under normal conditions, heme iron blocks the kinase active site (including the ATP binding and activation segment) of HRI to inhibit activity. Conversely, under heme deficiency conditions, the heme iron dissociates from the kinase active site, which is consequently exposed to the solvent, promoting catalytic activity to phosphorylate the Ser-51 residue of eIF2α. Spectroscopic evidence on truncated HRI mutant proteins indicates that the nitrogen atom of a His residue in the N-terminal domain and the sulfur atom of a Cys residue in the C-terminal domain are the heme axial ligands for HRI under normal conditions (7Igarashi J. Sato A. Kitagawa T. Yoshimura T. Yamauchi S. Sagami I. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15752-15762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 8Miksanova M. Igarashi J. Minami M. Sagami I. Yamauchi S. Kurokawa H. Shimizu T. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 9894-9905Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Hg2+ strongly suppresses HRI catalysis with an IC50 value of 0.6 μm, which is restored by NO, supporting the theory that the Cys thiolate is involved catalytic regulation (12Matinkova M. Igarashi J. Shimizu T. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 4109-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). An earlier study shows that two His residues are heme axial ligands of the isolated N-terminal domain of HRI (13Inuzuka T. Yun B.-G. Ishikawa H. Takahashi S. Hori H. Matts R.L. Ishimori K. Morishima I. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6778-6782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), distinct from the His and Cys residues proposed for full-length HRI (7Igarashi J.

Minami M. Sagami I. Yamauchi S. Kurokawa H. Shimizu T. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 9894-9905Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The mechanism proposed for NO-induced catalytic activation of the isolated N-terminal domain is also inconsistent with that for the full-length enzyme (7Igarashi J. Sato A. Kitagawa T. Yoshimura T. Yamauchi S. Sagami I. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15752-15762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 8Miksanova M. Igarashi J. Minami M. Sagami I. Yamauchi S.

Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6778-6782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Thus, the molecular mechanisms of catalytic activation and inhibition of full-length HRI by heme require clarification, in particular interactions between the heme iron and full-length HRI, the mechanism by which full-length HRI senses the heme iron and the amino acids acting as axial ligands for the heme iron. To elucidate the heme-sensing mechanism of HRI, it is necessary to identify the axial ligands for the heme iron complex and determine their roles in catalysis and heme inhibition. In the present study we generated three N-terminal-truncated mutant proteins along with seven single and two double His mutant proteins in the N-terminal domain and six single Cys mutant proteins in the C-terminal domain of the full-length HRI enzyme and conducted spectroscopic and catalytic analyses. Spectroscopic data indicate that His-119/His-120 and Cys-409 are the axial ligands for Fe(III) complex bound to full-length HRI, and the Pro residue adjacent to Cys-409 is critical for Fe(III) complex binding. The inhibitory effects of the heme iron on the C409S mutant proteins for the N-terminal-truncated and -isolated kinase domains were significantly lower than that for wild-type full-length HRI. Based on these results we suggest that heme sensing is conducted via heme-protein interactions, including those between the N-terminal and kinase domains, accompanied by global structural changes induced by coordination of the heme iron. Thus, it appears that heme iron coordination with the side chains of surface amino acids is not the only essential requirement for heme sensing to inhibit full-length HRI activity. Materials—Phos-tag acrylamide was acquired from the Phos-tag consortium. Highly purified oligopeptides were purchased from Greiner Bio-One (Tokyo, Japan). Other reagents were purchased from Wako Pure Chemicals (Osaka, Japan). Site-directed Mutagenesis, Protein Expression and Purification—Mutagenesis was conducted using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) and the PrimeSTAR mutagenesis basal kit from Takara Bio (Otsu, Japan). The desired mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) Codon Plus RIL (Stratagene) harboring the His-tagged HRI expression vector was grown at 37 °C until absorbance at 600 nm reached 0.6. Protein expression was induced by 50 μm isopropyl-β-d-galactoside. E. coli was harvested after 20 h of incubation at 15 °C and stored at -80 °C until use. The protein purification procedures used were similar to those described previously, with some modifications (7Igarashi J. Sato A. Kitagawa T. Yoshimura T. Yamauchi S. Sagami I. Shimizu T. J. Biol.

E. coli pellets were dissolved in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) containing 20 mm imidazole and protease inhibitors. Cells were disrupted using a sonicator, and cell debris was removed by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min. Supernatant fractions were loaded on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (Qiagen KK, Tokyo, Japan), washed in buffer A containing 20 mm imidazole, and eluted with a liner gradient of 20–200 mm imidazole in buffer A. HRI fractions were pooled and loaded on a HiTrap Q-Sepharose column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with buffer A, and HRI was eluted with a linear gradient of 150–500 mm NaCl containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. The His tag was cleaved using human rhinovirus 3C protease (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany) at 4 °C for 12 h. Finally, the sample was loaded on a HiLoad 26/60 Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with buffer A. SDS-PAGE analyses disclosed that the purified protein was more than 95% homogenous. The typical yield of HRI was 1 mg from 1 liter of culture medium. N-terminal-truncated mutant proteins (Δ85 (an N-terminal-truncated mutant where amino acids 1–85 of the full-length HRI were truncated, and amino acids 86–619 remained), Δ127 (an N-terminal-truncated mutant where amino acids 1–127 of the full-length HRI were truncated, and amino acids 128–619 remained), and Δ145) and the isolated kinase domain were purified in a similar manner to the full-length enzyme. Notably, the isolated kinase domain did not absorb to the HiTrap Q-Sepharose column. His6-N-terminal domain (NTD) was expressed and purified as described elsewhere (27Igarashi J. Sato A. Kitagawa T. Sagami I. Shimizu T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1650: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). For heme reconstitution, a slight excess of Fe(III) complex dissolved in 90% ethylene glycol was mixed with apoprotein in buffer A and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Unbound heme was removed using the HiTrap Q-Sepharose column under similar conditions as above. The protein concentration was determined with the Quick start protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Optical Absorption and CD Spectra—Optical absorption spectra were obtained for HRI in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 150 mm NaCl with a Shimadzu UV-2500 spectrophotometer maintained at 25 °C under aerobic conditions. To ensure the appropriate solution temperature, the reaction mixture was incubated for 10 min before spectroscopic measurements. CD spectra were obtained for 10 μm Fe(III)-HRI in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 150 mm NaCl with a Jasco J-720 CD spectrometer at room temperature. Molar ellipticity was normalized to the heme concentration determined using the pyridine hemochromogen assay. Heme dissociation kinetics values from HRI to apoH64Y/V68F mutant were obtained as described previously (8Miksanova M. Igarashi J. Minami M. Sagami I. Yamauchi S. Kurokawa H. Shimizu T. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 9894-9905Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 31Hargrove M.S. Singleton E.W. Quillin M.L. Ortiz L.A. Phillips Jr., G.N. Olson J.S. Mathews A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4207-4214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Enzyme Assay—In vitro kinase assays were performed as described previously (7Igarashi J. Sato A. Kitagawa T. Yoshimura T.

Kurokawa H. Shimizu T. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 9894-9905Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Briefly, the reaction mixture consisting of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, 60 mm KCl, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 0.35 μm HRI, and 2–20 μg of eIF2α was incubated at 15 °C for 5 min, and the reaction was initiated by adding 50 μm ATP at 15 °C. At the indicated times the reaction was terminated by adding sample buffer and heat-denatured at 95 °C for 5 min. Samples were loaded on a 7.5% SDS gel containing 50 μm Phos-tag acrylamide and 100 μm manganese chloride. Phosphorylated eIF2α protein interacted with the Phos-tag manganese complex so that the mobility of the phosphorylated protein was slower than that of phosphate-free eIF2α. Proteins were visualized with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R350 staining. Gel images were acquired using LAS-3000 (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan), and quantified using Multi-Gauge software (Fujifilm). Molecular Modeling—A small peptide, AAA-CP-AAA, containing a central CP motif was synthesized as a model, and the peptide geometry was relaxed using a molecular dynamics simulation in a periodic box of dimensions 20 × 20 × 30 Å, filled with water molecules. The model peptide is neutral overall, but the C terminus and N terminus are charged to preserve the α-helical conformation by virtue of the small dipole moment. Counterions were not added to the model. The molecular dynamics relaxation was run for 1 ps (step = 0.001 ps) at constant temperature (300 K) using the Amber99 force field. The relaxed peptide model was then removed from the box and docked to the iron atom of hemin (coordinates are taken from the crystal structure of the α-chlorohemin molecule) (28Koenig D.F. Acta Crystallogr. 1965; 18: 663-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) via formation of an Fe-S bond. The structure of the peptide-hemin complex was subsequently relaxed with molecular mechanics using the MMX force field. HyperChem 7.51 software (Hypercube Inc.; Gainesville, FL) was used for the modeling. Figures were generated with the graphic software Molden (Version 4.6) (14Schaftenaarand G. Noordik J.H. J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 2000; 14: 123-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2924) Google Scholar). Pulldown Assay—His6-NTD (amino acids 1–138, wild type, H119A, H120A, and H119A/H120A mutants) and Δ145 (wild type and C409S mutant) proteins were mixed with each other (100 pmol each) in the presence or absence of hemin (100 pmol). The mixture was loaded on to a Ni-Sepharose 6 column (GE Healthcare). Next, the column was washed with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 20 mm imidazole, and His6-tagged protein was eluted with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 200 mm imidazole. The input sample, washed flow-through, and elution fractions were analyzed with SDS-PAGE. Amino Acid Alignments—A His residue of the N-terminal domain and Cys residue of the C-terminal catalytic domain are possible axial ligands for Fe(III)-complexed full-length HRI (7Igarashi J. Sato A.

Sagami I. Yamauchi S. Kurokawa H. Shimizu T. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 9894-9905Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Amino acid alignments of selected N-terminal and C-terminal kinase domain regions of HRI are shown in Fig. 1. His-75 and -120 in the N-terminal domain are highly conserved, whereas His-78, -80, and -119 are present only in mammals. Cys-208, -385, and -464 in the kinase domain are highly conserved from mammals to Xenopus and zebrafish, whereas Cys-409, -491, and -550 are identified only in mammals. We targeted all His residues in the N-terminal domain and Cys residues in the kinase domain and generated N-terminal truncated and full-length single mutant proteins. Optical Absorption Spectra of N-terminal Single His Mutants of Full-length HRI—Sequencing of HRI revealed the presence of seven His residues at positions 75, 78, 80, 86, 119, 120, and 126 in the N-terminal domain (Fig. 1). We replaced the individual His residues of the N-terminal domain with Ala. H75A and H78A mutant proteins were not properly expressed, as observed from SDS-PAGE analyses, suggesting that bulkiness at these positions is critical to maintain the global structure of the full-length HRI protein. Accordingly, we generated H75L and H78L mutants of full-length HRI.

High and low RZ values reflect high and low heme binding affinities, respectively Open table in a new tab Optical Absorption Spectra of N-terminal His Double Mutant Proteins of Full-length HRI—An earlier study reports that ligand switching to the neighboring amino acid residue(s) possibly occurs upon single mutations at the His residues (21Yang J. Ishimori K. O'Brian M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7671-7676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In view of the amino acid sequence, ligand switching within the His-75/His-78 and His-119/His-120 couples appears to occur upon single mutations at one of the sites. Accordingly, we generated double mutants, H75L/H78L and H119A/H120A, of full-length HRI protein. The H119A/H120A mutant exhibited an unusual spectrum where the Fe(III) complex was not bound properly to the protein (Fig. 2D, Table 1). In contrast, the H75L/H78L mutant protein displayed essentially similar optical absorption spectra as the wild-type full-length protein. Based on these findings, we propose that either His-119 or His-120 is an axial ligand for the Fe(III) complex in full-length HRI. The data are in accordance with the spectral characteristics of N-terminal-truncated mutant proteins in that a His residue between positions 86 and 127 of the N-terminal domain should be one of the axial ligands for the Fe(III) complex in the full-length HRI protein (supplemental Fig. 1S) (8Miksanova M. Igarashi J. Minami M. Sagami I. Yamauchi S. Kurokawa H. Shimizu T. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 9894-9905Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). CD Spectra of Full-length His Mutant Proteins—Because it was implied that CD spectrum in the Soret region of the heme protein sensitively reflects the protein structure around the heme binding site, even optical absorption spectra do not manifest any changes upon mutations at the heme binding site (13Inuzuka T. Yun B.-G. Ishikawa H. Takahashi S. Hori H. Matts R.L. Ishimori K. Morishima I. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6778-6782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To further identify the amino acid(s) that acts as the axial ligand for Fe(III) complex in full-length HRI, we obtained CD spectra of all His mutant proteins. Specifically, the CD intensity at 425 nm of the H119A mutant protein was significantly larger (on the minus side) than those (trough at 423 nm) of other mutant and wild-type proteins (Fig. 3 and supplemental Fig. 2S). In addition, the CD spectrum of H120A showed the peak at 386 nm and the trough at 423 nm, and these spectral positions are also different from those of the wild-type protein. CD spectra of other full-length mutant proteins were essentially similar to that of the wild-type protein (Fig. 3 and supplemental Fig. 2S). These spectral findings indicate that either His-119 or His-120 is the axial ligand trans to Cys for the Fe(III) complex in the full-length HRI protein. Optical Absorption Spectra of Single Cys Mutants of the Kinase Domain of Full-length HRI—Spectroscopic characterization of full-length single mutant and N-terminal-truncated mutant HRI proteins suggests that a Cys residue in the C-terminal kinase domain is an axial ligand of the Fe(III) complex in full-length HRI protein. The kinase domain of HRI contains six Cys residues (Fig. 1). We generated six Cys-Ser mutant proteins and examined their optical absorption spectra. The maxima of the Soret and visible absorption spectra are summarized in Table 1. Selected absorption spectra are shown in Fig. 4. Evidently, only the C409S mutant protein lost heme binding ability in terms of the ratio of absorbance at the Soret peak to that at 280 nm and spectral features, whereas other mutants displayed similar heme binding ability to wild type. Here, we suggest that Cys-409 is the axial ligand for the Fe(III) complex in full-length HRI protein. Complete loss of heme binding ability of the C409S mutant additionally supports the theory that there is only one heme binding site per HRI monomer. These results are consistent with a 1:1 stoichiometry of heme binding to full-length HRI protein (8Miksanova M. Igarashi J. Minami M. Sagami I. Yamauchi S. Kurokawa H. Shimizu T. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 9894-9905Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), although earlier studies on the isolated domain indicate the presence of two heme binding sites (23Rafie-Kolpin M.

Role of the Heme-regulatory CP Motif in Cys Binding to the Fe(III) Complex—There are two heme regulatory or CP motifs (identified at residues 409 and 550) located in the kinase domain of HRI (Fig. 1). The CP motif may be critical in heme sensing in several heme-associated proteins, including HAP1, IRP2, Bach1, ALAS1, and Irr (11Igarashi J. Kitanishi K. Martinkova M. Murase M. Iizuka A. Shimizu T.

Tokunaga F. Iwai K. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 171-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. 3S). To address the role of Pro residues adjacent to the two Cys residues, Cys-409 and Cys550, we generated P410A and P551A mutant proteins and examined their heme binding affinities. As shown in Fig. 5, the P410A mutant protein lost heme binding properties, whereas the P551A protein maintained heme binding affinity (Table 1). Evidently, the Pro residue next to Cys residue plays an important role in Cys binding to the Fe(III) complex. The results strongly suggest that Cys-409 is an axial ligand to the Fe(III) complex in full-length HRI. To further address the general role of Pro adjacent to Cys in binding to the Fe(III) complex, we additionally obtained optical absorption spectra of the Fe(III) complex in the presence of oligopeptides containing the HRI CP motif and non-CP Cys (supplemental Fig. 4S). Oligopeptides with non-CP Cys residues did not bind free Fe(III) heme (supplemental Fig. 5S). In contrast, two oligopeptides containing the CP motif of the HRI sequence (Cys-409—Pro-410 and Cys-550—Pro-551) bound tight to free Fe(III) heme with equilibrium dissociation constants of less than 5 μm (supplemental Fig. 6S). Additionally, the binding affinities of the oligopeptides to the Fe(III) complex were significantly lowered when the Pro residue next to Cys was mutated to Ala (supplemental Fig. 6S). Molecular modeling investigations with classical force fields and, using the small peptide AAA-CP-AAA, suggest that Pro adjacent to Cys favors the coordination of Cys to the heme iron center with the aid of H-bonds (supplemental Fig. 7S). Additionally, hydrophobic interactions between the heme plane, proline, and a pr"

The ecology of this pathogen is poorly understood, in part because it has been extremely difficult to identify the niche(s) it occupies based on culture isolation of the organism from environmental samples.We investigated the ecology of blastomycosis by performing maximum entropy modeling of exposure sites from 156 cases of human and canine blastomycosis to provide a regional-scale perspective of the geographic and ecologic distribution of B. dermatitidis in Wisconsin. Based on analysis with climatic, topographic, surface reflectance and other environmental variables, we predicted that ecologic conditions favorable for maintaining the fungus in nature occur predominantly within northern counties and counties along the western shoreline of Lake Michigan. Areas of highest predicted occurrence were often in proximity to waterways, especially in northcentral Wisconsin, where incidence of infection is highest. Ecologic conditions suitable for B. dermatitidis are present in urban and rural environments, and may differ at the extremes of distribution of the species in the state.Our results provide a framework for a more informed search for specific environmental factors modulating B. dermatitidis occurrence and transmission and will be useful for improving public health awareness of relative exposure risks."
https://openalex.org/W2130514108,"Tobacco products and nicotine alter the cell cycle and lead to squamatization of oral keratinocytes (KCs) and squamous cell carcinoma. Activation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) elicits Ca(2+) influx that varies in magnitude between different nAChR subtypes. Normal differentiation of KCs is associated with sequential expression of the nAChR subtypes with increasing Ca(2+) permeability, such as alpha5-containing alpha3 nAChR and alpha7 nAChR. Exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) or an equivalent concentration of nicotine accelerated by severalfold the alpha5 and alpha7 expression in KCs, which could be abolished by mecamylamine and alpha-bungarotoxin with different efficacies, suggesting the following sequence of autoregulation of the expression of nAChR subtypes: alpha3(beta2/beta4) > alpha3(beta2/beta4)alpha5 > alpha7 > alpha7. This conjecture was corroborated by results of quantitative assays of subunit mRNA and protein levels, using nAChR-specific pharmacologic antagonists and small interfering RNAs. The genomic effects of ETS and nicotine involved the transcription factor GATA-2 that showed a multifold increase in quantity and activity in exposed KCs. Using protein kinase inhibitors and dominant negative and constitutively active constructs, we characterized the principal signaling cascades mediating a switch in the nAChR subtype. Cumulative results indicated that the alpha3(beta2/beta4) to alpha3(beta2/beta4)alpha5 nAChR transition predominantly involved protein kinase C, alpha3(beta2/beta4)alpha5 to alpha7 nAChR transition-Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II and p38 MAPK, and alpha7 self-up-regulation-the p38 MAPK/Akt pathway, and JAK-2. These results provide a mechanistic insight into the genomic effects of ETS and nicotine on KCs and characterize signaling pathways mediating autoregulation of stepwise overexpression of nAChR subtypes with increasing Ca(2+) permeability in exposed cells. These observations have salient clinical implications, because a switch in the nAChR subunit composition can bring about a corresponding switch in receptor function, leading to profound pathobiologic effects observed in KCs exposed to tobacco products."
https://openalex.org/W2077325026,"The MUC1 protein is aberrantly expressed on many solid tumor cancers. In contrast to its apical clustering on healthy epithelial cells, it is uniformly distributed over cancer cells. However, a mechanistic link between aberrant expression and cancer has remained elusive. Herein, we report that a membrane-bound MUC1 cleavage product, that we call MUC1*, is the predominant form of the protein on cultured cancer cells and on cancerous tissues. Further, we demonstrate that transfection of a minimal fragment of MUC1, MUC1*(1110), containing a mere forty-five (45) amino acids of the extracellular domain, is sufficient to confer the oncogenic activities that were previously attributed to the full-length protein. By comparison of molecular weight and function, it appears that MUC1* and MUC1*(1110) are approximately equivalent. Evidence is presented that strongly supports a mechanism whereby dimerization of the extracellular domain of MUC1* activates the MAP kinase signaling cascade and stimulates cell growth. These findings suggest methods to manipulate this growth mechanism for therapeutic interventions in cancer treatments."
https://openalex.org/W1993476788,"Metabolism of nitroglycerin (GTN) to 1,2-glycerol dinitrate (GDN) and nitrite by mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH2) is essentially involved in GTN bioactivation resulting in cyclic GMP-mediated vascular relaxation. The link between nitrite formation and activation of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) is still unclear. To test the hypothesis that the ALDH2 reaction is sufficient for GTN bioactivation, we measured GTN-induced formation of cGMP by purified sGC in the presence of purified ALDH2 and used a Clark-type electrode to probe for nitric oxide (NO) formation. In addition, we studied whether GTN bioactivation is a specific feature of ALDH2 or is also catalyzed by the cytosolic isoform (ALDH1). Purified ALDH1 and ALDH2 metabolized GTN to 1,2- and 1,3-GDN with predominant formation of the 1,2-isomer that was inhibited by chloral hydrate (ALDH1 and ALDH2) and daidzin (ALDH2). GTN had no effect on sGC activity in the presence of bovine serum albumin but caused pronounced cGMP accumulation in the presence of ALDH1 or ALDH2. The effects of the ALDH isoforms were dependent on the amount of added protein and, like 1,2-GDN formation, were sensitive to ALDH inhibitors. GTN caused biphasic sGC activation with apparent EC(50) values of 42 +/- 2.9 and 3.1 +/- 0.4 microm in the presence of ALDH1 and ALDH2, respectively. Incubation of ALDH1 or ALDH2 with GTN resulted in sustained, chloral hydrate-sensitive formation of NO. These data may explain the coupling of ALDH2-catalyzed GTN metabolism to sGC activation in vascular smooth muscle."
https://openalex.org/W2050962647,"Toll-IL-1 receptor (TIR) domain-containing adaptor molecule-1 (TICAM-1, also named TIR domain-containing adaptor-inducing interferon (IFN)-beta or TRIF)) is a signaling adaptor of Toll-like receptor (TLR) 3/4 that activates the transcription factors, interferon regulatory factor-3 (IRF-3) and NF-kappaB leading to inducing IFN-beta production. The mechanisms by which TICAM-1 is activated by TLR3/4 to serve as a signaling platform are unknown. In this study, we show that homo-oligomerization of TICAM-1 is critical for TICAM-1-mediated activation of NF-kappaB and IRF-3. Both TIR and C-terminal domain of TICAM-1 mediated TICAM-1 oligomerization. Pro(434) located in the TIR domain and the C-terminal region, with the exception of the RIP homotypic-interacting motif, were determinants of TICAM-1 oligomerization. Mutation of TIR domain (P434H) or deletion of C-terminal domain greatly reduced TICAM-1-mediated NF-kappaB and IFN-beta promoter activation. TICAM-1 oligomerization at either the TIR domain or the C-terminal region resulted in recruitment of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 3, a downstream signaling molecule essential for TICAM-1-mediated IRF-3 activation, but not recruitment of the IRF-3 kinase complex, NF-kappaB-activating kinase-associated protein 1 and TANK-binding kinase 1. In addition, RIP homotypic-interacting motif mutant, which possesses two oligomerization motifs but not the RIP1 binding motif, also failed to recruit NF-kappaB-activating kinase-associated protein 1 and TANK-binding kinase 1. Thus, full activation and formation of TICAM-1 signalosomes requires oligomerization induced at two different sites and RIP1 binding."

In this study we report the purification and identification of a protein secreted by neuroblastoma cells that stimulates interleukin-6 production by stromal cells. Using a series of chromatographic purification steps including heparin-affinity, ion exchange, and molecular sieve chromatography followed by trypsin digestion and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, we identified in serum-free conditioned medium of neuroblastoma cells several secreted peptides including galectin-3-binding protein, also known as 90-kDa Mac-2-binding protein. We demonstrated the presence of the galectin-3-binding protein in the conditioned medium of several neuroblastoma cell lines and in chromatographic fractions with interleukin-6 stimulatory activity. Consistently, bone marrow stromal cells express galectin-3, the receptor for galectin-3-binding protein. Supporting a role for galectin-3-binding protein in stimulating interleukin-6 expression in bone marrow stromal cells, we observed that recombinant galectin-3-binding protein stimulated interleukin-6 expression in these cells and that interleukin-6 stimulation by neuroblastoma-conditioned medium was inhibited in the presence of lactose or a neutralizing anti-galectin-3 antibody. Down-regulation of galectin-3-binding protein expression in neuroblastoma cells also decreased the interleukin-6 stimulatory activity of the conditioned medium on bone marrow stromal cells. We also provide evidence that stimulation of interleukin-6 by galectin-3-binding protein involves activation of the Erk1/2 pathway. The data, thus, identifies galectin-3-binding protein as a factor secreted by neuroblastoma cells that stimulates the expression of interleukin-6 in bone marrow stromal cells and provides a novel function for this protein in cancer progression.

It has become increasingly evident that the tumor microenvironment plays an important contributory role to cancer progression (1Fidler I.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (3552) Google Scholar). Tumor cells closely interact with non-malignant cells present in the tumor stoma through a series of adhesion-dependent and adhesion-independent mechanisms. Among the adhesion-independent interactions, cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors play a critical role (2Singh S. Sadanandam A. Singh R.K.

In this regard, the bone marrow, which is a frequent site of metastasis, provides a microenvironment that is particularly favorable to cancer progression because it is a source of hematopoietic and mesenchymal cells that produce a large number of cytokines and chemokines (4Bonfil R.D.

A similar interaction between tumor cells and BMSC has been previously demonstrated to play a critical role in multiple myeloma, a cancer also characterized by an increase in bone destruction (14Teoh G.

However, in contrast to myeloma, where the production of IL-6 by BMSC is dependent on an adhesion contact between BMSC and tumor cells, in neuroblastoma, stimulation of IL-6 does not involve cell-cell contact and occurs in the presence of serum-free conditioned medium (CM) from neuroblastoma cells. In this manuscript we report the purification and characterization of a protein secreted by human neuroblastoma cells and present in their culture medium that stimulates the expression of IL-6 by human BMSC. This protein was identified as galectin-3-binding protein (Gal-3BP), also known as 90-kDa Mac-2 binding protein, a secreted glycoprotein with a molecular mass of ∼90 kDa initially identified and characterized in breast cancer cells and in human milk (16Koths K.

The reaction was stopped by adding 200 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor for 30 min. Preparation of CM from Neuroblastoma Cells—Neuroblastoma cells were plated at 5 × 106 in 150 cm2 tissue culture flasks for 72 h in culture medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. The tissue culture flasks were then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (4 mm KCl, 0.5 mm Na2HPO4, 140 mm NaCl, and 0.15 mm KH2PO4), and serum-free medium was added. After 24 h, the CM was collected and centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C before being filtered through a 0.2-μm filter (Corning Inc., Corning, NY) and stored at –20 °C until used for chromatographic separation.

The bound proteins were eluted in one step with 1 m NaCl. The active fractions (see below) were pooled, desalted by passing through a YM-10 membrane, and resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. The pool was then applied to a 1-ml diethylaminoethyl-Sepharose column (HiTrap DEAE Fast Flow, GE Healthcare) equilibrated with the same buffer at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Bound proteins were eluted using a linear gradient of NaCl from 0 to 0.5 m. The active fractions were pooled and concentrated by passing through a YM-10 membrane, equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and applied to a molecular sieve column (Superdex 200, 5 mm × 150 mm, GE Healthcare) at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. Each fraction eluting from the chromatography was examined for protein concentration using the BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce) for IL-6 stimulatory activity (see below) and for protein content by SDS-PAGE (see below). Measurement of IL-6 Stimulatory Activity—Individual fractions separated by chromatography were tested for their ability to simulate the expression of IL-6 in BMSC in culture. In brief, BMSC were seeded in 24-well tissue culture plates at 104 cells/well (1.9 cm2, Corning, Inc.) and maintained for 48 h in serum-containing medium. Each well was then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 24 h with 1 ml of serum-free medium supplemented with an aliquot (50 or 100 μl) of individual chromatographic fractions. The supernatant of the culture medium was then collected, clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C, and examined for IL-6 concentration by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using a human IL-6 ELISA kit purchased from R&D Systems. The specific activity of each fraction was expressed in pg of IL-6/mg of protein in the fraction tested. SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting—SDS-PAGE was performed using 4–12% gradient acrylamide gels (Invitrogen). Proteins were visualized by silver staining or transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes by semi-dry blotting (Bio-Rad). After being blocked in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20 containing 5% nonfat dried milk, the membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the primary antibody in blocking buffer. After washing, the membranes were incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (dilution 1:10,000 v/v) for 1 h. The presence of immune complexes was identified by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Gels were scanned, and quantitative analysis was done using the NIH J image software. Mass Spectrometry; Trypsin Digestion and Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometry (MS/MS)—The protein mixture was dissolved in 20 μl of 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate and 4 m urea and reduced by adding dithiothreitol to a final concentration of 10 mm at 95 °C for 10 min. The sample was immediately alkylated by adding 2 μl of 50 mm iodoacetamide at 37 °C for 30 min. The urea was diluted to 1 m with 72 μl of 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate, and the proteins were digested with 1 μg of sequencing grade modified trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) at 37 °C overnight. The digestion was continued for an additional 24 h by adding 1 μg of trypsin. For MS analysis, 13 μl of 10% (v/v) formic acid was added, and the sample was desalted and concentrated using C18 reverse phase. One-fourth of the sample was loaded on a 10-cm reversed phase chromatography capillary column connected to a spray tip column through a MicroTee with in-union high voltage contact as previously described (17Wang L.C. Okitsu C.Y. Kochounian H. Rodriguez A. Hsieh C.L. Zandi E. Proteomics. 2008; 8: 1758-1761Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Peptides were eluted into the mass spectrometer using the gradients 5–50% acetonitrile + 0.1% formic acid over 75 min and 50–90% acetonitrile + 0.1% formic acid over 40 min. A split tee with a fused silica capillary (25-μm internal diameter) on one end was used to split the high pressure liquid chromatography flow from 50 to 500 μl/min. The other end of the tee was connected to a six-port divert/inject valve, which was used to introduce peptide samples into the column. A linear ion trap LTQ (Thermo Electron, Inc.) was used to acquire tandem MS/MS spectra with Xcalibur 2.1 software using the following method; a full MS scan was followed by seven consecutive MS2 scans of the top 7 ion peaks from the preceding full scan using dynamic exclusion (4 repetitions in 1.5 min were excluded for 15 min). Data were analyzed using Bioworks 3.2, utilizing the SEQUEST algorithm and Sage-N Sorcerer to determine cross-correlation scores between acquired spectra and NCBI protein FASTA databases. The following parameters were used for the TurboSEQUEST search: molecular weight range, 0–5000; threshold, 1000; monoisotopic; precursor mass, 1.4; group scan, 10; minimum ion count, 20; charge state, auto; peptide, 1.5; fragment ions, 0; static amino acid modifications, Cys 57.05 and Met 15.99. Results were filtered using SEQUEST cross-correlation scores greater than 2.0 for +1 ions, 3.0 for +2 ions, and 3.5 for +3 ions. Gal-3BP-blocking Experiment—Lactose and a blocking antibody against Gal-3 (TIB-166) were used in blocking experiments with BMSC. Lactose (50 to 150 mm) or TIB-166 (dilutions of 1/1000 to 1/100 v/v) were added for 2 h to the culture medium of BMSC before the addition of neuroblastoma CM or active pooled chromatographic fractions. Sucrose and mouse nonspecific IgG were used as a negative control for lactose and TIB-166, respectively. Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorter Analysis—Cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, detached in cell dissociation buffer, and recovered by centrifugation at 4500 rpm for 5 min before being resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% (v/v) bovine serum albumin. Aliquots containing 1 × 106 cells were incubated with antibodies at a final concentration of 1 μg/106 cells. After incubation for 15 min, cells were washed and reincubated with a secondary fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:1000 v/v). Cells were then analyzed using a FACScan flow cytometer, and the data were analyzed using CellQuest software (BD Bioscience). Nonspecific fluorescence was determined in the presence of an unlabeled anti-mouse IgG antibody. Transfection of siRNA—CHLA-255 neuroblastoma cells were seeded onto 24-well plates and cultured in medium without antibiotics for 24 h before transfection. Two different siRNAs for Gal-3BP were purchased from Qiagen, Inc. (Valencia, CA): Hs_LGALS3BP#1, 5′-CCG UCA UCC UGA CUG CCA A-3′, and Hs_LGLS3BP#5, sense 5′-CCA UGA GUG UGG AUG CUG A-3′. A scrambled control sequence was used as the control. siRNA transfection was done in the presence of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), and a fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled siRNA was used to assess the transfection efficiency. Statistical Analysis—Student's t test was used for the comparison between two sets of data. The analysis of variance was used for the analysis of trends. A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. CM of Neuroblastoma Cells Contains a Protein(s) That Stimulates IL-6 Production in BMSC—In support of the concept that the stimulation of IL-6 by neuroblastoma CM was mediated by a protein(s) produced by neuroblastoma cells, we had previously demonstrated that treatment of neuroblastoma cells with cycloheximide resulted in a loss of IL-6 stimulatory activity in the CM (13Sohara Y. Shimada H. Minkin C. Erdreich-Epstein A. Nolta J.A. DeClerck Y.A. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 1129-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To obtain additional evidence in support of the stimulatory factor being a protein, we demonstrated that treatment of CM from two neuroblastoma cell lines (NB-19 and CHLA-255) with trypsin significantly decreased the amount of IL-6 produced by BMSC cultured in the presence of these CM (Fig. 1A). Treatment of CHLA-255 CM with heat (50 and 90 °C) also resulted in a substantial loss of IL-6 stimulatory activity. The data are, thus, consistent with the IL-6 stimulatory factor present in neuroblastoma CM being a (or possibly several) portein. Interestingly, we also observed an increase in Erk1/2 activation (phosphorylation) when BMSC were cultured in the presence of neuroblastoma CM, raising the possibility that the stimulatory protein could be a ligand signaling via Erk1/2 (Fig. 1B). Chromatographic Purification of a Protein with IL-6 Stimulatory Activity—We, therefore, initiated a series of chromatographic separations in an attempt to isolate and identify the active protein(s). A typical example of the purification protocol used is shown in Fig. 2. Serum-free CM from CHLA-255 cells was concentrated 50-fold by pressure dialysis on a 10,000 nominal molecular weight limit polyethersulfone membrane, applied to a heparin affinity column, and eluted with 1 m NaCl (Fig. 2A). This initial purification step resulted in the identification of 2 sets of fractions (heparin-unbound and heparin-bound) with IL-6 stimulatory activity. The heparin-bound fractions (13Sohara Y.

North Am. 1997; 11: 27-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), which had a higher specific activity than the heparin-unbound fractions, were then pooled, desalted, applied to a DEAE anion exchange column, and eluted with a 0–0.5 m NaCl gradient (Fig. 2B). This resulted in the identification of a broad peak of active fractions (20Sasaki T. Brakebusch C. Engel J. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1606-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 21Raz A.

These fractions (9 ml) were pooled, desalted, concentrated 50× (180 μl), and applied to a gel filtration (Superdex 200) column (Fig. 2C). This chromatographic purification step resulted in the identification of 2 peaks of activity that, however, remained poorly separated. The activity and specific activity recovered during a typical purification procedure of CM from CHLA-255 cells is shown in Table 1. From 6 liters of CM containing 45.26 mg of protein, we obtained at the end 4.6 μg of active material with a specific activity of 203,977 pg of IL-6/mg of protein in the first peak eluting from the molecular sieve column and 7.6 μg of protein with a specific activity of 124,466 pg of IL-6/mg of protein in the second peak. Aliquots of the active fractions identified during these chromatographic steps were examined by SDS-PAGE and silver stain for protein content (Fig. 3). This analysis indicated after chromatographic separation by heparin, ion exchange, and molecular sieve chromatography, the presence of several proteins with Mr between 45 and 250 in the last pool of active fractions obtained by molecular sieve chromatography (fractions 7–9 in peak 1) (Fig. 3, lane 6). These pooled fractions were digested in solution with trypsin, and peptides were identified by liquid chromatography-MS/MS. This analysis identified a total of 65 proteins, most of them corresponding to intracellular and membrane-associated proteins (data not shown). However, among these, six proteins corresponded to secreted and extracellular matrix proteins (Table 2). Three peptides were from extracellular matrix proteins including laminin (β and γ chains) and tenascin. One peptide corresponded to the λ heavy chain of immunoglobulin (a likely contaminant from residual fetal bovine serum) and one to a hypothetical protein T08772. The protein with the highest score (4Bonfil R.D. Chinni S. Fridman R. Kim H.R. Cher M.L. Urol. Oncol. 2007; 25: 407-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) was Gal-3BP or Mac-2BP, a 587-amino acid-secreted glycosylated protein with a molecular mass of 65.3 and 90 kDa when glycosylated (16Koths K. Taylor E. Halenbeck R. Casipit C. Wang A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14245-14249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This latter protein particularly raised our interest as a likely candidate because a literature search revealed that it was the only protein among the six secreted peptides that had been previously reported to stimulate IL-6 expression (18Kalayci O.

This analysis revealed the presence of 3 broad peptide bands with Mr values in the range of 93, 70, and 26 in the CM of 3 neuroblastoma cell lines that stimulated IL-6 expression in BMSC (Fig. 4A). The diffuseness of these bands was consistent with their being glycoproteins, and their Mr values were consistent with previously published data. Gal-3BP has been reported to be cleaved by plasmin and another endogenous protease into a 70-kDa N-terminal fragment with activity and a 26-kDa C-terminal domain (16Koths K. Taylor E. Halenbeck R. Casipit C. Wang A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14245-14249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Sasaki T. Brakebusch C. Engel J. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1606-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). A similar Western blot analysis performed on aliquots of pooled active fractions obtained by chromatography (Fig. 4B) revealed the presence of the intact 93-kDa protein in the active heparin-unbound fractions and of the N-terminal 70-kDa proteolytic fragment and 26-kDa C-terminal fragment in the active heparin-bound fractions and all other active fractions obtained by ion exchange and molecular sieve chromatography. In contrast, Gal-3BP was not identified by Western blot analysis in chromatographic fractions that had no IL-6 stimulatory activity (data not shown). BMSC Express Galectin-3—Gal-3BP binds to Gal-3, a member of the galectin family of lectins that specifically recognizes β-galactosidic carbohydrate structures and is localized not only at the cell membrane but also in the cytoplasm and the nucleus of cells (21Raz A.

We, therefore, determined whether Gal-3 was expressed by BMSC (Fig. 5).

Other cytoplasmic sterol-binding proteins could interact with this pathway by sequestering or delivering substrates and ligands. One potential regulator is OSBP (oxysterol-binding protein), which is implicated in the integration of sterol sensing/transport with sphingomyelin synthesis and cell signaling. Since these activities could impact the cholesterol efflux pathway, we examined whether OSBP was involved in LXR regulation and in expression and activity of ABCA1. Suppression of OSBP in Chinese hamster ovary cells by RNA interference resulted in increased ABCA1 protein expression and cholesterol efflux activity following induction with oxysterols or the synthetic LXR agonist TO901317. OSBP knockdown in J774 macrophages also increased ABCA1 expression in the presence and absence of LXR agonists. OSBP depletion did not affect ABCA1 mRNA levels or LXR activity. Rather, OSBP silencing increased the half-life of ABCA1 protein by 3-fold. Sphingomyelin synthesis was suppressed in OSBP-depleted cells treated with 25-hydroxycholesterol but not TO901317 or 22-hydroxycholesterol and did not correlate with ABCA1 stabilization. Moreover, co-transfection experiments revealed that reduction of ABCA1 protein by OSBP was prevented by a mutation in the sterol-binding domain but not by mutations that abrogated interaction with the Golgi apparatus or endoplasmic reticulum. Thus, OSBP opposes the activity of LXR by negatively regulating ABCA1 activity in the cytoplasm by sterol-binding domain-dependent protein destabilization.

LXR is activated by oxysterol derivatives of cholesterol in vivo and is thus positioned to sense the cellular levels of cholesterol and regulate genes required for its elimination (7Chen W. Chen G.

Although transcriptional induction of ABCA1 by LXR is a key event in this process, it is now recognized that regulation of ABCA1 protein stability in the plasma membrane (PM) and endosomes is also involved. ApoAI binds and stabilizes ABCA1, resulting in increased PM localization and decreased degradation by thiol proteases (9Arakawa R. Yokoyama S. J. Biol.

Phosphorylation of the PEST sequence is inhibited by apoAI, resulting in increased surface localization and stabilization. ABCA1 also interacts with β1- and α1-syntrophin, scaffolding proteins that regulate transport through linkage to the cytoskeleton, resulting in stabilization at intracellular sites and the PM (14Munehira Y.

Thus, distribution of ABCA1 between the PM and endosomes affects protein stability and efficiency of cholesterol efflux to apoA1. Other sterol-binding proteins could affect cholesterol homeostasis by sequestration or delivery of oxysterol ligands to LXR or by influencing the supply of cholesterol or phospholipids to ABCA1 for efflux to apoA1. A class of binding proteins that could fulfill these functions is the OSBP (oxysterol-binding protein) and ORP (OSBP-related) gene family, which are expressed across eukaryotic phyla and consist of 12 mammalian and seven yeast members (16Jaworski C.J.

OSBP and ORPs are characterized by a C-terminal OSBP homology domain that binds oxysterols and cholesterol (18Im Y.J. Raychaudhuri S. Prinz W.A. Hurley J.H.

The majority of family members also contain pleckstrin homology (PH) and FFAT (two phenylalanines in an acidic tract) domains that mediate interaction with phosphatidylinositol phosphates (21Levine T.P.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2025-2035Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar), respectively. The PH and FFAT domain of OSBP facilitate partitioning between the ER and Golgi apparatus in response to oxysterol and cholesterol binding (23Wyles J.P. McMaster C.R. Ridgway N.D. J. Biol.

Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1062-1071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sterol-dependent partitioning of OSBP between the Golgi and ER does not appear to be directly involved in cholesterol regulation, since depletion by RNA interference did not affect the sterol-regulatory element-binding protein pathway and cholesterol ester synthesis (27Nishimura T. Inoue T. Shibata N. Sekine A. Takabe W. Noguchi N. Arai H. Genes Cells. 2005; 10: 793-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 28Perry R.J. Ridgway N.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 2604-2616Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Rather, OSBP mediates the oxysterol-dependent regulation of the ceramide transfer protein (CERT) and sphingomyelin synthesis in the Golgi apparatus (28Perry R.J. Ridgway N.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 2604-2616Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), indicating a sensing function for integration of cellular cholesterol and sphingomyelin levels. The pleiotropic effects of yeast OSH deletions (29Beh C.T. Rine J. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2983-2996Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and mammalian ORP overexpression (22Lagace T.A.

J. 2002; 361: 461-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) on cholesterol homeostasis also suggest a functional interaction at the level of cholesterol transport and/or regulation of transport machinery. Indeed, yeast Osh4p binds and transports sterols in vitro and has been implicated along with other OSH proteins in sterol transport in vivo (32Raychaudhuri S. Im Y.J. Hurley J.H. Prinz W.A. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 107-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that the observed effects of ORPs on cholesterol homeostasis in mammalian cells could be mediated directly or indirectly through LXR. Overexpression of ORP1L in COS cells increased LXRα activity, based on a reporter gene assay (33Johansson M. Bocher V. Lehto M. Chinetti G. Kuismanen E. Ehnholm C. Staels B. Olkkonen V.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 903-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). However, transgenic expression of ORP1L in macrophages implanted in the bone marrow of LDL-/- mice resulted in decreased expression of the LXR target genes ABCG1, apoE, and ABCG5 (34Yan D. Jauhiainen M. Hildebrand R.B. Willems van Dijk K. Van Berkel T.J. Ehnholm C. Van Eck M. Olkkonen V.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2007; 27: 1618-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Adenoviral expression of OSBP in mouse hepatocytes did not affect mRNA for ABCA1 and ABCG1 but up-regulated SREBP1c (sterol-regulatory element-binding protein 1c) expression and processing (35Yan D. Lehto M. Rasilainen L. Metso J. Ehnholm C. Yla-Herttuala S. Jauhiainen M. Olkkonen V.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2007; 27: 1108-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Recently, ORP8 was shown to negatively regulate ABCA1 transcription by a mechanism involving DR4 and E-box elements (36Yan D. Mayranpaa M.I. Wong J. Perttila J. Lehto M. Jauhiainen M. Kovanen P.T. Ehnholm C. Brown A.J. Olkkonen V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 332-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Since ORP8 is anchored to the ER by a C-terminal transmembrane domain, transcriptional inhibition is probably indirect and related to the sterol binding or metabolic activity of this ORP. The cholesterol- and oxysterol-binding activity of OSBP and resultant activation of sphingomyelin synthesis in the Golgi apparatus have the potential to impact on ABCA1 expression and activity. To test this, RNA interference was used to silence OSBP, and resultant effects on ABCA1 expression and activity were determined. Results show that OSBP negatively regulates ABCA1 expression and cholesterol efflux activity by decreasing protein stability. This effect was not correlated with sphingomyelin synthesis or interaction of OSBP with the ER or Golgi apparatus but was dependent on OSBP sterol-binding activity. We conclude that OSBP opposes the activity of LXR by negatively regulating ABCA1 protein stability in the cytoplasmic compartment. Cell Culture and Transfection—CHO cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagles medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal calf serum and proline (33 μg/ml) (medium A) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. J774.1 macrophages were cultured in DMEM with 10% fetal calf serum. CHO cells stably expressing a vector encoding a short hairpin RNA targeting OSBP or a nontargeting control were cultured in medium A with G418 (350 μg/ml) (28Perry R.J. Ridgway N.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 2604-2616Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). For cholesterol efflux experiments, CHO cells were cultured in DMEM, 5% (v/v) lipoprotein-deficient serum, and proline (medium B). Cells received concentrated stock solutions of 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol (22OH) and 25-hydroxycholesterol (25OH), TO901317 or 9-cis retinoic acid (RA) such that the final concentration of DMSO or ethanol solvent in media did not exceed 0.1% (v/v). CHO cells were transfected with murine pABCA1-FLAG (Dr. Nan Wang, Department of Medicine, Columbia University, NY) and pOSBP using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). CHO and J774 cells were transiently transfected with a short interfering RNA (siRNA) against OSBP (siOSBP2) or nontargeting controls (siNT) purchased from Dharmacon Inc. (Lafayette, CO) using Trans-IT TKO transfection reagent (Mirus Corp., Nepean, Canada), as previously described (28Perry R.J. Ridgway N.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 2604-2616Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting—Cells were washed twice with PBS, scraped from the dish, sedimented at 10,000 × g for 1 min, and resuspended in 100 μl of Triton-X buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 5 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100) on ice for 10 min. Supernatants were collected after centrifugation for 10 min at 10,000 × g and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Analysis of the supernatant and pellet fractions by immunoblotting indicated that >95% of the ABCA1 protein was found in the Triton-soluble (supernatant) fraction. To preserve the integrity of ABCA1, samples were not heated prior to resolution of equivalent amounts of protein (15 μg) by SDS-PAGE on discontinuous 6–10% gels. Following transfer to nitrocellulose, filters were probed with primary antibodies against ABCA1 (Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO), OSBP, and actin, followed by goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Proteins were visualized by chemiluminescence and exposed to film, and expression was quantified by densitometry using ImageJ 1.38 (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Cell Surface Biotinylation—Proteins on the surface of CHO cell were biotinylated, harvested, and purified on streptavidin resin using a cell surface isolation pack (Pierce) and original methods (37Feng B. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43271-43280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Briefly, after surface biotinylation and quenching, cells were lysed, and debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. Biotinylated proteins in the supernatant (500 μl) were bound to a streptavidin column and eluted in 250 μl of SDS sample buffer. The total and cell surface fraction were treated with 50 mm dithiothreitol to remove biotin, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted using antibodies against ABCA1, OSBP, actin, protein kinase D, and AKT. Cholesterol Efflux Assays—Twenty-four hours after siRNA transfection, CHO cells received medium B, containing cholesterol (10 μg/ml) and [3H]cholesterol (0.3 μCi/ml) together with 22OH (1 μg/ml) and 10 μm RA, 1.0 μm TO901317, and 10 μm RA or solvent controls. After 18 h, cells were incubated for 1 h with medium B and then washed twice with warm DMEM. Cells were then incubated in DMEM or DMEM with 20 μg of apoAI/ml (Calbiochem/EMD Biosciences Inc. Missassauga, Canada) for 1 h at 37 °C. Radioactivity in media (subjected to centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 1 min to remove cellular debris) and cells (lysed in 0.5 n sodium hydroxide for 30 min) were quantified by liquid scintillation counting. The percentage of cholesterol efflux from cells was calculated based on radioactivity in the media divided by the total (cells and media). ApoAI-specific efflux to was determined by subtracting cholesterol efflux in DMEM. Extraction of cholesterol from CHO-K1 cells by methyl-β cyclodextrin (MCD) followed a similar protocol as described above except that after [3H]cholesterol loading, cells were treated with 2 mm MCD in DMEM. Cell lysate and medium fractions were collected, and [3H]cholesterol was quantified as described above. LXR Reporter Gene Expression—CHO cells stably expressing a nontargeting short hairpin RNA (shNT) and an OSBP-specific short hairpin RNA (shOSBP) (seeded in 12-well plates) were co-transfected with pGL3-LXREX3 (provided by Dr. Chris Sinal, Dalhousie University) (5 ng/well) and pCMV-βgal (20 ng/well). After 24 h, cells were treated with solvent alone, 22OH (1.0 μg/ml) with 10 μm (RA), or 1.0 μm TO901317 for 18 h. Luciferase activity was measured according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega Corp., Madison, MI) and expressed relative to β-galactosidase activity measured in the same cell lysate. Quantification of ABCA1 mRNA—CHO cells were transfected with siNT or OSBP siRNA for 48 h and treated with 22OH (1 μg/ml) with 10 nm RA, 1 μm TO with 10 nm RA or solvent for 18 h. Total RNA was purified, and mRNA for ABCA1 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were quantified by a S1 nuclease protection assay using single-stranded cDNA probes (22Lagace T.A. Byers D.M. Cook H.W. Ridgway N.D. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 205-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The ABCA1 probe was a 356-bp EcoRI and SacI (nucleotides 2908–2552) fragment of the murine ABCA1 cDNA. ABCA1 expression was quantified by densitometry of autoradiograms using ImageJ 1.38 and expressed relative to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA. Stable and Transient Gene Silencing of OSBP Increases ABCA1 Expression—To test whether ABCA1 expression was affected by OSBP depletion, CHO cells stably expressing shOSBP that reduced expression by 80–90% were compared with cells expressing shNT (28Perry R.J. Ridgway N.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 2604-2616Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). OSBP and ABCA1 were detected by immunoblotting of lysates from shOSBP and shNT cells that were treated with increasing concentrations of the LXR agonists 22OH or 25OH plus RA for 18 h (Fig. 1A). Untreated shNT cells expressed low levels of ABCA1 protein, which was induced by the addition of 22OH or 25OH plus RA. Expression of ABCA1 in shOSBP cells was increased in a dose-dependent manner by 22OH or 25OH plus RA to a level that was ∼3–4-fold greater than shNT cells. Increased ABCA1 expression was also observed in shOSBP cells treated with 22OH and RA for 6 and 12 h (Fig. 1B). To test whether these results could be reproduced by another silencing method, CHO cells were transfected with an OSBP-specific siRNA (siOSBP) or a nontargeting control (siNT), and expression of ABCA1 was measured following induction with 22OH or 25OH (Fig. 1C). As reported previously, this siRNA reduced OSBP expression by 90% relative to siNT control (28Perry R.J. Ridgway N.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 2604-2616Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Compared with siNT-transfected CHO cells, transient knockdown with siOSBP resulted in a consistent increase in ABCA1 expression when cells were treated individually with RA, 22OH, or 25OH and a larger magnitude increase when RA and oxysterols were combined. Although it was apparent that OSBP depletion induced ABCA1 protein expression following induction with oxysterol agonists of LXR, the effect under basal conditions was difficult to assess due to low and variable ABCA1 expression in CHO cells. To assess whether basal expression was affected by OSBP depletion and if this relationship between OSBP and ABCA1 existed in other cells, ABCA1 expression was measured in J774 macrophages following siRNA transfection (Fig. 1D). ABCA1 expression under basal conditions was readily detected and very responsive to induction by 22OH or TO901317. Transient knockdown of OSBP in untreated J774 macrophages resulted in increased ABCA1 expression (3.0 ± 0.9-fold; mean ± S.E., n = 3) compared with siNT controls. It was also apparent that activation by RA and 22OH or the synthetic LXR agonist TO901317 increased ABCA1 expression in OSBP-depleted cells compared with siNT controls. The effect of increased ABCA1 expression on cholesterol efflux activity in CHO cells depleted of OSBP was measured by release of [3H]cholesterol to apoA1 in the medium (Fig. 2). siOSBP-transfected cells treated with 22OH or TO901317 and incubated with apoA1 for 1 h had a 3- and 4-fold increase in ABCA1 expression compared with the corresponding nontargeting controls (Fig. 2, A and B). This increase in ABCA1 expression translated into a significant 2–3-fold increase in [3H]cholesterol efflux relative to untreated cells (Fig. 2C). Although ABCA1 expression in siNT-transfected cells was increased by 22OH and TO901317, this did not result in a significant increase in cholesterol efflux activity (Fig. 2C). It should be noted that cholesterol efflux from OSBP-depleted cells was increased, but not significantly, compared with similarly treated siNT cells. Increased apoA1-specific cholesterol efflux in OSBP-depleted cells reflects the increased expression of ABCA1, but underlying changes in cholesterol distribution at the PM or in intracellular compartments could also be involved. Extraction of cellular cholesterol by the nonspecific acceptor methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MCD) is partially dependent on ABCA1 expression (38Landry Y.D. Denis M. Nandi S. Bell S. Vaughan A.M. Zha X. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36091-36101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) but can also be used to assess cholesterol deposition at the PM and internal compartments (39Yancey P.G. Rodrigueza W.V. Kilsdonk E.P. Stoudt G.W. Johnson W.J. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16026-16034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). To determine if cholesterol distribution was affected by OSBP depletion, CHO cells were treated as described in the legend to Fig. 2, and extraction of [3H]cholesterol by MCD in the medium was monitored at 37 °C (Fig. 3). Regardless of OSBP expression and LXR agonist treatment, MCD rapidly absorbed 20–30% of PM [3H]cholesterol by 30 min, after which efflux reached a second slower stage, reflecting mobilization from intracellular sites. Cholesterol extraction from OSBP-depleted cells was slightly reduced but not significantly different from controls, indicating that OSBP does not affect the overall distribution of cholesterol. Treatment of cells with the cholesterol-specific probe BC-θ (40Iwamoto M. Morita I. Fukuda M. Murota S. Ando S. Ohno-Iwashita Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1327: 222-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) also confirmed the lack of effect of OSBP-depletion on plasma membrane cholesterol levels (results not shown). OSBP Regulates ABCA1 Expression by a Post-transcriptional Mechanism—A possible explanation of the results shown in Figs. 1 and 2 is that OSBP and LXR compete for a common oxysterol ligand(s), and loss of OSBP expression effectively increases the pool of oxysterol available for LXR activation. However, this interpretation appeared to be untenable, since the nonsterol LXR agonist TO901317 increased ABCA1 expression in OSBP-depleted cells to a similar extent as 22OH and 25OH (Figs. 1 and 2). The possibility that OSBP also binds TO901317 was disproved by demonstrating that it failed to compete with 25OH for binding to recombinant OSBP in vitro (supplemental Fig. 1). To determine if OSBP depletion affected LXR activity and ABCA1 gene expression, an S1 nuclease protection assay was used to quantify ABCA1 mRNA levels in CHO cells transfected with control and OSBP-specific siRNAs (Fig. 4, A and B). Compared with untreated controls, siNT- and siOSBP-transfected CHO cells treated with 22OH or TO901317 displayed a similar 4–5-fold increase in ABCA1 mRNA. The lack of involvement of LXR was further confirmed by showing that luciferase activity driven from a LXR reporter construct was increased 2-fold by 22OH or TO901317 in both siNT- and siOSBP-transfected CHO cells (Fig. 4C). ABCA1 is also regulated at the post-transcriptional level by calpain dependent proteolysis (11Chen W. Wang N. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29277-29281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 12Wang N. Chen W. Linsel-Nitschke P. Martinez L.O. Agerholm-Larsen B. Silver D.L. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). To test whether OSBP depletion stabilized ABCA1, siNT and siOSBP transfected CHO cells were treated with TO901317, and turnover of ABCA1 protein was monitored by immunoblotting following inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide (Fig. 5, A and B). ABCA1 in CHO cells transfected with siNT had a short half-life of ∼2 h, a value similar to that reported in other cells (9Arakawa R. Yokoyama S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22426-22429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 14Munehira Y. Ohnishi T. Kawamoto S. Furuya A. Shitara K. Imamura M. Yokota T. Takeda S. Amachi T.

https://openalex.org/W2087512862,"Migration of epithelial cells is critical for normal homeostasis in gut and skin, but the factors regulating this process are not completely understood. The zinc finger transcription factor Klf5 (IKLF; BTEB2) is highly expressed in proliferating cells of esophagus, skin, and other organs. We hypothesized that Klf5 regulates keratinocyte migration via the integrin-linked kinase (ILK), which, like Klf5, is localized to basal keratinocytes. We stably transduced mouse primary esophageal keratinocytes to overexpress Klf5 or small interfering RNA against Klf5. Klf5 overexpression in keratinocytes increased migration and correlated directly with ILK expression and activation. ILK expression restored migratory capacity in keratinocytes with suppression of Klf5, whereas ILK small interfering RNA blocked the increased migration resulting from Klf5 overexpression. By chromatin immunoprecipitation, electromobility shift assay, and luciferase reporter assays, we confirmed that ILK was a direct target for Klf5. In addition, Klf5 induced the activation of the ILK targets Cdc42 and myosin light chain, which are critical for cell migration and motility but not Rac1, AKT, or GSK3beta. Overall, these results demonstrate that Klf5 is a key regulator of cell migration via ILK and provide new insight into the regulation of epithelial cell migration."
https://openalex.org/W1964474060,"A critical property of some neurons is burst firing, which in the hippocampus plays a primary role in reliable transmission of electrical signals. However, bursting may also contribute to synchronization of electrical activity in networks of neurons, a hallmark of epilepsy. Understanding the ionic mechanisms of bursting in a single neuron, and how mutations associated with epilepsy modify these mechanisms, is an important building block for understanding the emergent network behaviors. We present a single-compartment model of a CA3 hippocampal pyramidal neuron based on recent experimental data. We then use the model to determine the roles of primary depolarizing currents in burst generation. The single compartment model incorporates accurate representations of sodium (Na+) channels (NaV1.1) and T-type calcium (Ca2+) channel subtypes (CaV3.1, CaV3.2, and CaV3.3). Our simulations predict the importance of Na+ and T-type Ca2+ channels in hippocampal pyramidal cell bursting and reveal the distinct contribution of each subtype to burst morphology. We also performed fast-slow analysis in a reduced comparable model, which shows that our model burst is generated as a result of the interaction of two slow variables, the T-type Ca2+ channel activation gate and the Ca2+-dependent potassium (K+) channel activation gate. The model reproduces a range of experimentally observed phenomena including afterdepolarizing potentials, spike widening at the end of the burst, and rebound. Finally, we use the model to simulate the effects of two epilepsy-linked mutations: R1648H in NaV1.1 and C456S in CaV3.2, both of which result in increased cellular excitability."
https://openalex.org/W1964329624,"CXCL12/stromal cell-derived factor-1alpha (SDF-1alpha), a chemokine ligand for the G protein-coupled receptor CXCR4, plays an important role in the directed movement of cells. Many studies have documented the importance of CXCR4 in tumor progression and organ-specific metastasis. Recently, several studies have implicated a role for SDF-1alpha in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) metastasis, but currently there is little information about how SDF-1alpha promotes HNSCC metastasis. In this report we show that the NF-kappaB signaling pathway is activated in response to SDF-1alpha in HNSCC while primary and immortalized keratinocytes show no SDF-1alpha-mediated NF-kappaB activity. We found that SDF-1alpha-mediated NF-kappaB signaling is independent of phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt and ERK/MAPK pathways. We observed that SDF-1alpha induces IkappaBalpha phosphorylation and degradation and the nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB in HNSCC cell lines, suggesting that SDF-1alpha activates the classical NF-kappaB signaling pathway. Contrary to previous reports, SDF-1alpha-induced NF-kappaB activation is not mediated by tumor necrosis factor alpha. Furthermore, blocking the NF-kappaB signaling pathway with an IKKbeta inhibitor significantly reduces SDF-1alpha-mediated HNSCC invasion. Taken together, our data suggest SDF-1alpha/CXCR4 may promote HNSCC invasion and metastasis by activating NF-kappaB and that targeting NF-kappaB may provide therapeutic opportunities in preventing HNSCC metastasis mediated by SDF-1alpha."
https://openalex.org/W2046578569,"Although the role of collagen in thrombosis has been extensively investigated, the contribution of other extracellular matrices is still unclear. We have recently reported that laminin stimulates platelet spreading through integrin α6β1-dependent activation of the collagen receptor glycoprotein (GP) VI under static condition. Under physiological high and low shear conditions, platelets adhered to laminin, and this was strongly inhibited by an antibody that blocks association between GPIb-IX-V and von Willebrand factor (VWF). Moreover, platelets of type III von Willebrand disease or Bernard-Soulier syndrome adhered to laminin at a low shear condition but not at a high shear condition. The specific binding of laminin to VWF was confirmed by surface plasmin resonance spectroscopy (BIAcore). These findings suggest that laminin supports platelet adhesion depending on the interaction of VWF and GPIb-IX-V under pathophysiological high shear flow. This mechanism is similar to that of collagen. We propose that integrins, GPVI, GPIb-IX-V, and VWF represent a general paradigm for the interaction between platelets and subendothelial matrices.

Full understanding of the role of subendothelial matrices in this process is essential toward an understanding of thrombotic diseases and new forms of therapeutic intervention. Among types of subendothelial matrices, the role of collagen for thrombosis and hemostasis has been extensively investigated. Collagen activates platelets through collagen receptors glycoprotein (GP) 2The abbreviations used are: GP, glycoprotein; VWF, von Willebrand Factor; VWD, von Willebrand disease; BSS, Bernard-Soulier syndrome; BSA, bovine serum albumin. 2The abbreviations used are: GP, glycoprotein; VWF, von Willebrand Factor; VWD, von Willebrand disease; BSS, Bernard-Soulier syndrome; BSA, bovine serum albumin. VI and integrin α2β1 and induces platelet plug formation and occlusion at sites of vessel damage under physiological shear condition by recruiting platelets to exposed collagen. At arterial shear rates of flow, von Willebrand factor (VWF) and its platelet surface receptor GPIb-IX-V play a critical role in initiation of thrombus formation, although the role of VWF and GPIb-IX-V is minimal in venous shear rates of flow. Under arterial shear, VWF in circulation binds to collagen via its A3 domain, and then platelets are captured or tethered to the complex of collagen and VWF through GPIb-IX-V binding to VWF (1Savage B. Almus-Jacobs F. Ruggeri Z.M. Cell. 1998; 94: 657-666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). This is followed by platelet activation mediated by the binding of collagen to GPVI, leading to inside-out stimulation of integrin α2β1 and αIIbβ3 and platelet thrombus formation (2Nieswandt B. Watson S.P. Blood. 2003; 102: 449-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). Since collagen is a strong thrombogenic matrix that supports platelet adhesion and aggregation under high shear flow, collagen has been considered to play a central role in thrombosis and hemostasis. A glycoprotein laminin, which is also a major subendothelial matrix in vasculature, is predominantly expressed in the basement membrane under endothelial cells. We have recently discovered that the laminin purified from human placenta induces platelet activation that leads to cell spreading (3Inoue O. Suzuki-Inoue K. McCarty O.J. Moroi M. Ruggeri Z.M. Kunicki T.J. Ozaki Y. Watson S.P. Blood. 2006; 107: 1405-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, human laminin stimulates platelets by binding to the collagen receptor GP VI, and this interaction is facilitated by integrin α6β1 (3Inoue O. Suzuki-Inoue K. McCarty O.J. Moroi M. Ruggeri Z.M. Kunicki T.J. Ozaki Y. Watson S.P. Blood. 2006; 107: 1405-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). This mechanism of platelet adhesion and activation is similar to the interaction of platelets with collagen; integrin α2β1 binding to collagen facilitates the interaction between GPVI and collagen (4Inoue O. Suzuki-Inoue K. Dean W.L. Frampton J. Watson S.P. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 769-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 5Emsley J. Knight C.G. Farndale R.W. Barnes M.J. Liddington R.C.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2120-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Since both laminin and collagen are major subendothelial matrices in vasculature and both matrices activate platelets through GPVI, we hypothesized that laminin also plays a role in thrombosis and hemostasis under arterial shear condition. To explore the physiological significance of laminin-induced platelet activation, we sought to investigate whether laminin also supports platelet adhesion under pathophysiological flow condition. The present study demonstrated that laminin also supports platelet adhesion depending on the interaction of VWF with GPIb-IX-V at a high shear condition, thereby contributing to the hemostatic process. We propose that integrins, GPVI, GPIb-IX-V, and VWF may be common molecules necessary for platelet binding to subendothelial matrices. Materials—AJvW-2, an anti-VWF monoclonal antibody (8Eto K.

Biol. 1999; 19: 877-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), was a gift from Ajinomoto Pharmaceutical Research Laboratories (Yokohama, Japan). Argatroban was from Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma (Tokyo, Japan). DiOC6 was from Invitrogen. Glass capillary tube was from Camlab (Cambridge, UK). Horm type I collagen was from Nycomed Pharma GmbH (Munich, Germany). Human laminin and collagenase were from Sigma-Aldrich. Human VWF was purified as described elsewhere (9Fujimura Y. Titani K. Holland L.Z. Russell S.R. Roberts J.R. Elder J.H. Ruggeri Z.M. Zimmerman T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 381-385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All other materials were from previously named sources (3Inoue O. Suzuki-Inoue K. McCarty O.J. Moroi M. Ruggeri Z.M. Kunicki T.J. Ozaki Y. Watson S.P. Blood. 2006; 107: 1405-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Flow Adhesion Assay—Whole blood from healthy donors, a patient with type III von Willebrand disease (type III VWD), or a patient with Bernard-Soulier syndrome (BSS) was collected into a syringe and anticoagulated with 0.1 μg/ml argatroban and 5 units/ml heparin. All subjects provided written, informed consents in accordance with the Ethical Committee of University of Yamanashi and the Declaration of Helsinki. Capillary tubes (0.3 × 1.2 mm, 50 mm long) were coated with 100 μg/ml laminin or collagen overnight at 4 °C. Capillaries were washed and blocked with phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% BSA for 2 h at room temperature. Laminin-coated capillaries were treated with 0.1 mg/ml collagenase for 2 h at 35 °C before BSA blocking as described previously (3Inoue O. Suzuki-Inoue K. McCarty O.J. Moroi M. Ruggeri Z.M. Kunicki T.J. Ozaki Y. Watson S.P. Blood. 2006; 107: 1405-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Then they were rinsed with modified Tyrode's buffer supplemented with 2 mm CaCl2 and 1 units/ml heparin and connected to a syringe filled with the anticoagulated blood that had been pretreated with 5 μm DiOC6 for 30 min. Blood was perfused into capillaries at indicated shear rates in the presence or absence of 10 μg/ml AJvW-2, and adherent platelets were visualized using a fluorescent video microscope (IX71, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Movie data were converted into sequential photo images, and the percentage of area covered by adherent platelets at 5 min was measured using NIH Image (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Since platelet count is significantly low in BSS patients when compared with normal donors, we diluted blood from a normal donor by the addition of platelet-poor plasma and added washed red blood cells from the same donor to adjust blood cell counts so that comparison could be made between BSS blood and diluted normal blood. Surface Plasmon Resonance Spectroscopy—A specific interaction between VWF and laminin was analyzed using a BIAcore X (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). VWF coupling, blocking, and regeneration of a CM5 chip were performed as described before (3Inoue O. Suzuki-Inoue K. McCarty O.J. Moroi M. Ruggeri Z.M. Kunicki T.J. Ozaki Y. Watson S.P. Blood. 2006; 107: 1405-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Laminin in HBS-EP buffer (10 mm HEPES, 0.15 m NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, and 0.005% Tween 20, pH 7.4, BIAcore) at several concentrations was perfused over the control surface or an immobilized VWF surface at a flow rate of 10 μl/min at 25 °C, and the resonance changes were recorded. The response from the VWF surface was subtracted from that of the control. The dissociation constants (Kd) were determined using BIAevaluation software. Statistics—Statistical analysis was performed using the unpaired Student's t test. Laminin Supports Platelet Adhesion under High Shear Flow—Whole blood labeled with DiOC6 was flowed over laminin or collagen surfaces under high (1500 s–1) shear rate for 5 min. Fig. 1 showed that laminin as well as collagen supports platelet adhesion (Fig. 1, A and B). Under high shear rates, platelets attached to, tethered on, and stably adhered to both collagen and laminin surfaces, whereas some of them detached after transient adhesion. The majority of adherent platelets to collagen formed large aggregates in 5 min (Fig. 1A), whereas only small aggregate formation was observed on laminin under high shear flow (Fig. 1B). Under high shear flow, VWF in circulation binds to exposed collagen, and the initial contact of platelets with collagen is mediated through GPIb-IX-V and VWF bridges. In this process, VWF plays an essential role in platelet adhesion to collagen. Since laminin supports platelet adhesion under high shear flow, we hypothesized that VWF and GPIb-IX-V on platelet membranes are also involved in this process, as is the case with collagen. To investigate this hypothesis, an anti-VWF antibody against A1 domain (AJvW-2) that blocks association of GPIb-IX-V with VWF was utilized. Pretreatment of blood with AJvW-2 significantly inhibited platelet adhesion to laminin as well as platelet adhesion to collagen at 1500 s–1. The percentage of area covered by adherent platelets to a laminin-coated capillary was reduced in the presence of AJvW-2 from 38.6±4.40% to 0.65±0.84% at 5 min (mean±S.D., p < 0.005), and that to a collagen-coated capillary was reduced from 39.3±6.53% to 1.66±1.71% at 5 min (mean±S.D., p < 0.005) (Fig. 1, A and B). In contrast, AJvW-2 did not inhibited platelet adhesion to either laminin or collagen at a shear rate of 300 s–1 (data not shown). These results suggested that VWF and GPIb-IX-V play a crucial role in platelet adhesion to laminin, which is quite reminiscent of the role of VWF and GPIb-IX-V for platelet adhesion to collagen under high shear condition. Platelet Adhesion to Laminin Requires VWF and GPIb-IX-V under High Shear Flow—The inhibitory effect of AJvW-2 on platelet adhesion to laminin under high shear prompted us to further investigate the role of VWF and GPIb-IX-V in shear-resistant platelet adhesion to laminin using blood from a patient who lacks VWF (type III VWD) or GPIb-IX-V (BSS). As shown in Fig. 1C, platelets from a normal donor adhered to laminin and collagen at high and low shear rates. On the other hand, the adhesion of platelets from a VWD patient to laminin- or collagen-coated surfaces was greatly attenuated at a shear rate of 1500 s–1, although they almost normally adhered to either surface at a shear rate of 300 s–1, suggesting that VWF plays a crucial role in platelet adhesion to laminin under high shear conditions (Fig. 1C). Involvement of GPIb-IX-V in platelet adhesion to laminin under flow was also investigated using whole blood from a patient of BSS, whose platelets lack GPIb-IX-V. Similar to the results with VWF-deficient blood, platelets from a BSS patient adhered to both laminin and collagen under low shear condition but failed to adhere to either surface under high shear conditions (Fig. 1D), indicating that GPIb-IX-V is also involved in platelet adhesion to laminin under this condition. The Direct Binding of Laminin to VWF Was Observed by a Surface Plasmon Resonance Spectroscopy—Our findings hitherto strongly suggested that VWF binds to laminin under high shear flow, and then platelets bind to laminin through the interaction between GPIb-IX-V and VWF. To verify the binding of laminin with VWF, we next measured Kd for the interaction of laminin with VWF using BIAcore. As shown in Fig. 2, a direct binding between laminin and VWF was observed. The Kd for the interaction of laminin with VWF was calculated as 524 ± 63.9 nm (mean ± S.D.), and that of Horm collagen with VWF was calculated as 5.90 ± 1.03 nm (mean ± S.D.). This suggests that the affinity between laminin and VWF is about 100-fold lower than that between Horm collagen and VWF. Although a previous study reported that laminin supports platelet adhesion under high shear (11Hindriks G. Ijsseldijk M.J. Sonnenberg A. Sixma J.J. de Groot P.G. Blood. 1992; 79: 928-935Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), its mechanism has not been elucidated to date. We have recently reported that human laminin supports platelet adhesion through integrin α6β1 and activates platelets that induce spreading through a collagen receptor GP VI under static condition (3Inoue O. Suzuki-Inoue K. McCarty O.J. Moroi M. Ruggeri Z.M. Kunicki T.J. Ozaki Y. Watson S.P. Blood. 2006; 107: 1405-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The similarity of the mechanism of platelet adhesion and activation between laminin and collagen under static condition prompted us to hypothesize that laminin supports platelet adhesion under high shear flow through a mechanism similar to collagen. First, we compared platelet adhesion to laminin with that of collagen at a high shear rate. When blood was flowed over collagen, platelets rapidly adhered to the monolayer and formed large aggregates in 5 min, indicating that major signaling receptors GPVI strongly activates platelets upon adhesion to collagen. Although platelets adhered to laminin, the majority of adherent platelets formed only small aggregates in 5 min. These differences may be accounted for by the lower affinity of GPVI for laminin relative to collagen; the Kd for the interaction of GPVI with laminin (6.36±1.44 μm) is 10 times larger than that of GPVI with collagen (0.57 ± 0.73 μm) (3Inoue O. Suzuki-Inoue K. McCarty O.J. Moroi M. Ruggeri Z.M. Kunicki T.J. Ozaki Y. Watson S.P. Blood. 2006; 107: 1405-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). We next demonstrated that the shear-resistant adhesion of platelets to laminin is greatly dependent on the interaction between GPIb-IX-V and VWF using an anti-VWF antibody or blood donated by patients of VWD and BSS. It is of note that VWF and GPIb-IX-V are involved in shear-resistant adhesion to laminin under flow. Our results may account for the previously unex-plained finding by Wagner et al. (12Wagner D.D. Urban-Pickering M. Marder V.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 471-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), which showed that VWF binds to extracellular matrices independently of collagen. We also confirmed the direct interaction of laminin with VWF by using BIAcore in this study, although a previous report failed to detect the direct binding of VWF to laminin by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (13Matsui T. Kunichima S. Hamako J. Katayama M. Kamiya T. Naoe T. Ozaki Y. Fujimura Y. Titani K. J. Biochem. 1997; 121: 376-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). We assume that the direct binding of VWF with laminin may be difficult to be detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay because of the weak binding affinity between VWF and laminin. We have recently reported that laminin activates platelets through a collagen receptor GPVI and that the interaction between GPVI and laminin is facilitated by another laminin receptor integrin α6β1 (3Inoue O. Suzuki-Inoue K. McCarty O.J. Moroi M. Ruggeri Z.M. Kunicki T.J. Ozaki Y. Watson S.P. Blood. 2006; 107: 1405-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In the present study, we demonstrated that shear-resistant adhesion of platelets to laminin requires an interaction among laminin, VWF, and GPIb-IX-V. This is quite reminiscent of collagen-induced platelet activation, for which GPVI, integrin α2β1, VWF, and GPIb-IX-V are required. We propose that GPVI, integrins, VWF, and GPIb-IX-V may represent a general paradigm for the interaction between platelets and subendothelial matrices. Since both laminin and collagen are major subendothelial matrices in the vessel wall, this redundant mechanism of platelet adhesion to laminin and collagen under high shear flow may be suitable for cessation of bleeding at sites of damage to the vasculature and may also lead to pathological thrombus formation. We are grateful to Dr. Morio Arai of Novo Nordisk Pharma Ltd., Dr. Mitsuhiko Sugimoto of Nara Medical University, Dr. Kaneo Sato, and Chiaki Komatsu of University of Yamanashi for the help to the study."
https://openalex.org/W2129255694,"ASPP2 is a pro-apoptotic protein that stimulates the p53-mediated apoptotic response. The C terminus of ASPP2 contains ankyrin (Ank) repeats and a SH3 domain, which mediate its interactions with numerous partner proteins such as p53, NFκB, and Bcl-2. It also contains a proline-rich domain (ASPP2 Pro), whose structure and function are unclear. Here we used biophysical and biochemical methods to study the structure and the interactions of ASPP2 Pro, to gain insight into its biological role. We show, using biophysical and computational methods, that the ASPP2 Pro domain is natively unfolded. We found that the ASPP2 Pro domain interacts with the ASPP2 Ank-SH3 domains, and mapped the interaction sites in both domains. Using a combination of peptide array screening, biophysical and biochemical techniques, we found that ASPP2 Ank-SH3, but not ASPP2 Pro, mediates interactions of ASPP2 with peptides derived from its partner proteins. ASPP2 Pro-Ank-SH3 bound a peptide derived from its partner protein NFκB weaker than ASPP2 Ank-SH3 bound this peptide. This suggested that the presence of the proline-rich domain inhibited the interactions mediated by the Ank-SH3 domains. Furthermore, a peptide from ASPP2 Pro competed with a peptide derived from NFκB on binding to ASPP2 Ank-SH3. Based on our results, we propose a model in which the interaction between the ASPP2 domains regulates the intermolecular interactions of ASPP2 with its partner proteins.

Human ASPP2 is a 1128-amino acid protein, whose C-terminal part (amino acids (aa) 600-1128) was originally identified as a protein that binds the p53 core domain and was named p53-binding protein 2 (53BP2) (2Iwabuchi K. Bartel P.L. Li B. Marraccino R. Fields S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6098-6102Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Another truncated form of ASPP2 (aa 123–1128) was discovered as Bbp (Bcl-2-binding protein) (3Naumovski L. Cleary M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3884-3892Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Full-length ASPP2 was found to specifically stimulate the apoptotic function of p53 by enhancing the transactivation function of p53 on the promoters of pro-apoptotic genes, but it has no effect on genes involved in cell cycle arrest (1Samuels-Lev Y. O'Connor D.J. Bergamaschi D. Trigiante G. Hsieh J.K. Zhong S. Campargue I. Naumovski L. Crook T. Lu X. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 781-794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). ASPP2 contains several structural and functional domains (Fig. 1A): Its N terminus (residues 1–83) has the structure of a β-Grasp ubiquitin-like fold (4Tidow H. Andreeva A. Rutherford T.J. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 371: 948-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). It is followed by a predicted α-helical domain located between aa 123 and 323 (3Naumovski L. Cleary M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3884-3892Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and a proline-rich (ASPP2 Pro) domain between aa 674 and 902 (3Naumovski L. Cleary M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3884-3892Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The C-terminal part of ASPP2 contains four ankyrin repeats and an SH3 domain (ASPP2 Ank-SH3), as seen from its crystal structure in complex with p53 core domain (5Gorina S. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1996; 274: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the C-terminal domain of the homologous ASPP family member iASPP was solved recently, showing a similar structure of four ankyrin repeats and an SH3 domain. The C-terminal domain of iASPP formed a homodimer mediated by contacts between the N-terminal part of one molecule and the SH3 domain and the third ankyrin repeat of a second molecule (6Robinson R.A. Lu X. Jones E.Y. Siebold C. Structure. 2008; 16: 259-268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The ASPP2 Ank-SH3 domains mediate the interactions of ASPP2 with numerous partner proteins, most of which are involved in apoptosis or its regulation. Among these partner proteins are p53 (2Iwabuchi K. Bartel P.L. Li B. Marraccino R. Fields S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Jin B. Duraisingham S. Crook T. Lu X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1341-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The role of the ASPP2 Pro domain is unclear. This domain was not shown to bind other proteins, with the only exception being the interaction with YAP1. This interaction is mediated predominantly via the ASPP2 SH3 domain, but there is an additional binding site in the C terminus of the ASPP2 Pro domain, which is adjacent to the ASPP2 Ank-SH3 domains (9Espanel X. Sudol M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14514-14523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar).Peptides are valuable experimental tools to study proteins in many cases. This is particularly useful in the case of natively unfolded protein domains: Peptides, which are in most cases also unstructured, are excellent tools to study such domains. Peptides are also good models for binding studies, because they may gain their native structure upon ligand binding. This was shown for example for peptides derived from the BH4 domain of Bcl-2 (12Lee L.C. Hunter J.J. Mujeeb A. Turck C. Parslow T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23284-23288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and from the pro-apoptotic Bak (13Sattler M. Liang H. Nettesheim D. Meadows R.P. Harlan J.E.

Peptides are also useful to map interaction sites between proteins: Peptide arrays provide a highly efficient way for identifying the location of the binding sites in both interaction partners (14Frank R. J. Immunol. Methods. 2002; 267: 13-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). There have been numerous applications of peptide arrays for the study of epitope mapping, enzyme binding, and protein-protein interactions (15Reineke U. Volkmer-Engert R. Schneider-Mergener J. Curr.

Here we used peptides to gain information about the structure and interactions of ASPP2 domains using both methodologies: peptides as models for the ASPP2 Pro domain, which we found to be natively unfolded (see below), and peptide arrays to identify the precise binding sites involved in intramolecular and intermolecular interactions of ASPP2.Our aim in the current study was to elucidate the structure and the interactions of the ASPP2 Pro domain to gain insight into its function. Our results show that the ASPP2 Pro domain is natively unfolded. We found that ASPP2 Pro makes an interaction with the ASPP2 Ank-SH3 domains and mapped the interaction sites in both domains. However, according to our results ASPP2 Pro does not mediate the interactions of ASPP2 with peptides derived from its partner proteins. ASPP2 Pro-Ank-SH3 bound a peptide derived from its partner protein NFκB weaker than ASPP2 Ank-SH3 bound this peptide. This suggested that the presence of the proline-rich domain inhibited the interactions mediated by the Ank-SH3 domains. This was confirmed by our observation that a peptide from ASPP2 Pro competed with a peptide derived from NFκB on binding to ASPP2 Ank-SH3. Based on our results, we propose a model in which the interaction between the ASPP2 domains regulates the intermolecular interactions of ASPP2 with its partner proteins.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESExpression Plasmids—The constructs pRHislipoTEV (pHLT) ASPP2 Ank-SH3, containing ASPP2 893–1128 was a kind gift of Dr. Mark Allen, Cambridge, UK. The construct pGEX2TK ASPP2 Pro-Ank-SH3, containing ASPP2 693–1128 amino acids was a kind gift from Prof. Xin Lu, Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, London, UK. Point mutations were introduced into the gene encoding ASPP2 using the Site-Direct Mutagenesis kit (iNtRON). The construct pHLT ASPP2 Pro-Ank-SH3 was obtained by cloning of the ASPP2 693–1128 fragment from pGEX2TK ASPP2 Pro-Ank-SH3 into the pHLT ASPP2 Ank-SH3 construct. This was done in the following manner: pGEX2TK ASPP2 Pro-Ank-SH3 vector was restricted with BamHI and PstI enzymes. The fragment from this reaction was then used to replace the original BamHI-PstI fragment in the pHLT ASPP2 Ank-SH3, creating pHLT ASPP2 Pro-Ank-SH3. The truncated form pHLT ASPP2 Pro containing ASPP2 amino acids 693–918 was obtained by introducing two stop codons in positions 919 and 920 on the pHLT ASPP2 Pro-Ank-SH3 template, using site-directed mutagenesis with the following oligonucleotides: (i) 5′-GGCTCAGAGCGTATCGCTCATTAATAGAGGGTGAAATTCAACCCCC-3′; (ii) 5′-GGGGGTTGAATTTCACCCTCTA-TTAATGAGCGATACGCTCTGAGCC-3′. All constructs were verified by DNA sequence analysis (Center for Genomic Technologies, the Hebrew University).Protein Expression and Purification—We expressed and purified three truncated ASPP2 variants with and without the HLT tag containing His tag, Lipo domain, and TEV protease cleavage site (20Mondigler M. Ehrmann M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2986-2988Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). All pHLT constructs were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 pLysS cells (Novagen). Cells were grown in 2× YT media containing 1% glucose. Induction was done at A600 nm = 0.6 with 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for the pHLT ASPP2 Pro and for pHLT ASPP2 Pro-Ank-SH3, and with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for pHLT ASPP2 Ank-SH3. All cells were harvested after 14-h incubation at 22 °C for constructs ASPP2 Ank-SH3 and ASPP2 Pro and 16 °C for construct ASPP2 Pro-Ank-SH3.Purification of ASPP2 Pro-Ank-SH3—Cells were lysed by French Pressure cell press (SIM-AMINCO) and purified on a nickel-Sepharose HP column (Amersham Biosciences) using an ÄKTA explorer system (Amersham Biosciences). The protein was eluted using imidazole. The eluted protein was digested overnight at 24 °C with His-tagged TEV protease (21Lucast L.J. Batey R.T. Doudna J.A. BioTechniques. 2001; 30 (548, 550 passim): 544-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and further purified on a Superdex 200 column (Amersham Biosciences). Eluted protein was further purified on nickel-NTA beads (Qiagen) to trap the His-tagged TEV protease and residual uncleaved protein.Purification of ASPP2 Pro—Cells were lysed by French Pressure cell press and purified on a nickel-Sepharose HP column using an ÄKTA explorer system. The protein was eluted using imidazole. The protein was further purified on Superose 12 (Amersham Biosciences). Part of the protein was aliquoted and stored at -80 °C; the rest of the sample was digested overnight at 24 °C with His-tagged TEV protease (21Lucast L.J. Batey R.T. Doudna J.A. BioTechniques. 2001; 30 (548, 550 passim): 544-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and further purified on a 10-ml nickel-NTA column (Qiagen) to trap the His-tagged TEV protease, the HLT tag, and residual uncleaved protein.Purification of ASPP2 Ank-SH3—Cells were lysed by microfluidizer processor M-110EHI and purified a nickel-Sepharose HP column using an ÄKTA explorer system. The protein was eluted using imidazole. The protein was further purified on Resource Q30 column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted by NaCl gradient. The eluted protein was digested overnight at 30 °C with His-TEV protease (21Lucast L.J. Batey R.T. Doudna J.A. BioTechniques. 2001; 30 (548, 550 passim): 544-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and subsequently reapplied onto the nickel-NTA column (Qiagen) to separate the His-tagged TEV protease and residual uncleaved protein. The unbound fraction was further purified on a Sephacryl S-100 column (Amersham Biosciences).Analytical Size Exclusion Chromatography—HislipoTEV (HLT) 350 μl of ASPP2 Pro at 4.1 μm was injected to an analytical gel filtration Superose 12 (300 × 10 mm) column, on an ÄKTA design Explorer instrument equipped with a Monitor UV-900 detector and the Unicorn software package. The running buffer was 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol at 4 °C. 150 μl of 86 μm ASPP2 Ank-SH3 was separated in 1-ml fractions from an analytical Superose 12 (300 ×10 mm) column equilibrated with 25 mm phosphate buffer with 150 mm NaCl, at 4 °C. Molecular mass standards were run under the same conditions, and their elution volumes were used to create a calibration curve. The markers were: thyroglobin (669 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), β-amylase (200 kDa), aldolase (163 kDa), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (44 kDa), and RNase A (13.7 kDa).Peptide Array Screening—The peptide arrays were synthesized by Jerini Bio Tools GmbH (Berlin). The peptides were acetylated at their N terminus and attached to cellulose via their C terminus by an amide bond. Binding of the human ASPP2 893–1128 (ASPP2 Ank-SH3) to the cellulose-bound peptides was screened as described previously (17Rüdiger S. Germeroth L. Schneider-Mergener J. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1501-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar) with the following modifications: The peptide array was prewashed in binding buffer (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.075 m NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5% sucrose, 0.05% Tween 20). ASPP2 Ank-SH3 in a final concentration of 6.8 μm or ASPP2 Pro (final concentration, 1.4 μm) was incubated with the array in binding buffer overnight at 4 °C with gentle shaking. The electrotransfer was performed in four steps: 10-min transfer followed by replacement of the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and continuation of the transfer for additional 30 min; afterward all the “sandwiched” (blotting paper and polyvinylidene difluoride membrane) was replaced, and the transfer was continued for two more 30-min intervals. Transferred ASPP2 was detected using enhanced chemifluorescence with ASPP2-specific polyclonal rabbit antisera for ASPP2 Ank-SH3 and a different polyclonal rabbit antisera (a kind gift from Prof. Xin Lu) for ASPP2 Pro. Alternatively, a chemiluminescence blotting substrate Super Signal reagent (Pierce) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions for detection using ECL.Nickel-affinity Pulldown Assay—59 μl of 45 μm ASPP2 Ank-SH3 was incubated for 1 h with gentle agitation at 4 °C with 500 μl of 5.3 μm HLT ASPP2 Pro in 25 mm NaH2PO4, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and with 500-μl wash buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, with 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 10 mm imidazole) alone. 20 μl of nickel-NTA beads (Qiagen) equilibrated with wash buffer was added, and the incubation continued for another 1 h. The samples were centrifuged for 4 min at 3500 rpm at 4 °C, and the suspension was collected and defined as unbound. Samples were centrifuged, unbound material was collected, and beads were washed five times with buffer before elution with buffer containing 250 mm imidazole. Finally, samples were analyzed on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel.CD—CD spectra were recorded using a J-810 spectropolarimeter (Jasco) in 5 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 30 mm NaCl, and 2% glycerol in a 0.1-cm quartz cuvette for far-UV CD spectroscopy. Far-UV CD spectra were collected in a spectral range of 185 to 250 nm. The changes in CD spectra with temperature were measured in a temperature range of 20–90 °C in 10 °C steps. Prior to each experiment ASPP2 Pro was centrifuged in 13,200 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and the UV spectrum between 200 and 400 nm was measured. The amount of secondary structure was analyzed using DichroWeb (22Whitmore L. Wallace B.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W668-W673Crossref PubMed Scopus (1966) Google Scholar) with K2D software.Peptide Synthesis and Purification—Peptides were synthesized on Applied Biosystems (ABI) 433A peptide synthesizer using standard N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl chemistry as described before (23Hayouka Z. Rosenbluh J. Levin A. Loya S. Lebendiker M. Veprintsev D. Kotler M. Hizi A. Loyter A. Friedler A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 8316-8321Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar).Fluorescein Labeling—The peptides were labeled using 5′ (and 6′)-carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (Molecular Probes) at the N terminus as described before (23Hayouka Z. Rosenbluh J. Levin A. Loya S. Lebendiker M. Veprintsev D. Kotler M. Hizi A. Loyter A. Friedler A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 8316-8321Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar).Fluorescence Anisotropy—Measurements were performed at 10 °C by using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS-50b spectrofluorometer equipped with a Hamilton microlab M dispenser (24Weinberg R.L.

Structure. 2005; 13: 629-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Titration of ASPP2 Ank-SH3 into the fluorescein-labeled peptides was performed in 20 mm Hepes at pH 7.3 with ionic strength (IS) of 50 mm, 100 mm, and 150 mm. Titration of ASPP2 Ank-SH3 and of ASPP2 Pro-Ank-SH3 into the fluorescein-labeled NFκB 303–332 was performed in 20 mm NaH2PO4 at pH 7.0 with an IS of 50 mm. Fluorescence was measured with excitation at 480 nm and emission at 530 nm. The bandwidths were changed depending on the amount of the labeled molecule used. The labeled peptide was placed in the cuvette in a volume of 1 ml, at a concentration of 100 nm, and 150–200 μl of ASPP2 Ank-SH3 was placed in the dispenser. Additions of 5 μl were titrated at 90-s intervals, the solution was stirred for 10 s, and the fluorescence and anisotropy were measured. Dissociation constants (Kd) were calculated by fitting the anisotropy titration curves (corrected for the dilution effect) by using Kaleida-Graph (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). The following equation was used for the single-site model, r=r0+ra[ASPP2 Ank-SH3]Kd+[ASPP2 Ank-SH3](Eq. 1) Where, r0 is the initial anisotropy, ra is the difference in anisotropy between unbound and bound anisotropy, Kd is the dissociation constant, [ASPP2 Ank-SH3] is the molar concentration of ASPP2 Ank-SH3. Each experiment was performed at least three times, and Kd values were always reproducible. The experimental errors for Kd values are the result of the data fitting.In the different competition binding assays, the conditions were as following: 150 μl of 750 μm ASPP2 723–737 was added to a 1150-μl mixture of 87 nm fluorescein-labeled NFκB 303–332 and 2 μm ASPP2 Ank-SH3 at 50 mm IS; 150 μl of 195 μm NFκB 303–332 was added to a 1150-μl mixture of 87 nm fluorescein-labeled ASPP2 723–737 and 10.5 μm ASPP2 Ank-SH3 at 50 mm IS; 100 μl of 1500 μm ASPP2 723–737 was added to a 1200-μl mixture of 83 nm fluorescein-labeled ASPP2 723–737 and 26.5 μm ASPP2 Ank-SH3 at 150 mm IS.Disorder Predictions—We have used the following servers for disorder prediction for ASPP2: NORS (26Liu J.

In all cases, the whole sequence of ASPP2 (SP: ASPP2_HUMAN) was subjected to disorder prediction using default server parameters.Cross-linking—ASPP2 Pro-Ank-SH3 and ASPP2 Ank-SH3 (3.75 μm final concentration) were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in a pH 7.0 buffer containing 20 mm NaH2PO4, 110 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol. The reaction mixtures were treated with the cross-linking agent BS3 (25, 50, or 100 eq, Pierce) for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction mixtures were denatured and analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE (37Zhao L.

Biopolymers (Peptide Science). 2008; (in press)Google Scholar).Analytical Ultracentrifugation—AUC experiments were performed at 10 °C using a Beckman Optima XLI analytical ultracentrifuge with an An60Ti rotor. A 2.9 μm sample of ASPP2 Pro-Ank-SH3 (693–1128) was subject to sedimentation equilibrium experiments. The buffer was 25 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.02% NaN3, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Samples were loaded in triplicate into 6-sector 12-mm path length cells. Data were analyzed using the UltraSpin software. Data were fit to a single exponential model indicating equilibrium of single species of unspecified mass.RESULTSASPP2 Pro Domain Is Natively Unfolded—We used analytical size-exclusion chromatography to study the oligomerization state and compactness of the ASPP2 variants. ASPP2 Pro (aa 693–918) and ASPP2 Ank-SH3 (aa 893–1128) both eluted from the gel-filtration column as single peaks, indicating the existence of a single oligomeric form in both cases. The ASPP2 Pro domain eluted earlier than predicted from its molecular mass, and its apparent molecular mass estimated from the calibration curve was ∼130,000 Da (Fig. 2A), a value five times higher than the theoretical value of 24,500 Da. This early elution in the gel filtration may be attributed to an extended or unfolded native structure of the protein (39Sanchez-Puig N. Veprintsev D.B. Fersht A.R. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 11-21Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) or to putative oligomerization. The structured ASPP2 Ank-SH3 eluted as expected from its molecular weight. For this protein, the calculated and the estimated molecular mass were the same, with a value of 26,600 Da (Fig. 2B).FIGURE 2Determination of the quaternary structure of ASPP2 Pro. Analytical gel filtration studies of ASPP2 Pro compared with ASPP2 Ank-SH3 domains supports its lack of structure: A, ASPP2 Pro: The calculated molecular mass of ASPP2 Pro is 24,500 Da, but the experimental molecular mass estimated from the calibration curve corresponds to ∼130,000 Da. B, ASPP2 Ank-SH3: ASPP2 Ank-SH3 eluted after 15 ml, as expected from its calculated molecular mass of around 27,000 Da.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine the basis for the early elution of ASPP2 Pro in the gel filtration experiments, we analyzed its secondary structure using CD spectroscopy. The far-UV CD spectrum of the recombinant purified protein exhibited a minimum at only ∼200 nm (Fig. 3A), suggesting a highly unstructured conformation. To further test this, we monitored changes in the far-UV CD signal as a function of temperature (Fig. 3B). No change in the signal was observed, indicating no structural transition upon temperature increase. This is typical for unstructured proteins (40Uversky V.N. Fink A.L. FEBS Lett. 2002; 522: 9-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Taken together, the CD spectra indicate a high content of unstructured regions in ASPP2 Pro domain.FIGURE 3Analysis of the structure of ASPP2 Pro by CD spectroscopy and computational predictions. A, far-UV CD spectra of ASPP2 Pro. The spectrum almost lacks the typical signatures of secondary structure and exhibits a minimum around 200 nm, indicating an unfolded conformation. Analysis of the CD spectrum using the Dichroweb server (22Whitmore L. Wallace B.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W668-W673Crossref PubMed Scopus (1966) Google Scholar) showed that ∼40% of the protein corresponds to a random coil. B, temperature dependence of the CD spectrum of ASPP2 Pro. Spectra were measured at the range of 30–90 °C at 10 °C intervals. The lack of significant changes in the spectrum indicates the lack of a structural transition upon increase of the temperature, pointing again at an unstructured conformation. C, disorder predictions for residues 693–1128 of ASPP2. Each line represents the disorder prediction for the ASPP2 sequence by different methods (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). Segments that are predicted to be disordered are gray. The secondary structure for residues 919–1128, containing the ankyrin repeats and SH3 domains, is depicted in helices and arrows forα-helices andβ-strands, respectively. The different methods predict an unstructured conformation for the proline-rich region and a folded conformation for the ASPP2 Ank-SH3 region. D, the ASPP2 Pro sequence. 57% of the amino acids in ASPP2 Pro are typical for disordered regions (Glu, Lys, Arg, Gly, Gln, Ser, and Pro (colored blue)) (42Romero P. Obradovic Z. Li X. Garner E.C.

https://openalex.org/W2010983242,"Tumor necrosis factor-stimulated gene-6 protein (TSG-6) is involved in the transfer of heavy chains (HCs) from inter-α-inhibitor (IαI), pre-α-inhibitor, and as shown here HC2·bikunin to hyaluronan through the formation of covalent HC·TSG-6 intermediates. In contrast to IαI and HC2·bikunin, pre-α-inhibitor does not form a covalent complex <i>in vitro</i> using purified proteins but needs the presence of another factor (Rugg, M. S., Willis, A. C., Mukhopadhyay, D., Hascall, V. C., Fries, E., Fülöp, C., Milner, C. M., and Day, A. J. (2005) <i>J. Biol. Chem.</i> 280, 25674–25686). In the present study we purified the required component from human plasma and identified it as HC2. Proteins containing HC2 including IαI, HC2·bikunin, and free HC2 promoted the formation of HC3·TSG-6 and subsequently HC3·hyaluronan complexes. HC1 or HC3 did not possess this activity. The presented data reveal that both HC2 and TSG-6 are required for the transesterification reactions to occur."
https://openalex.org/W2027136434,"CD40-CD154 interactions have proven critical in autoimmunity, with the identification of CD4(lo)CD40(+) T cells (Th40 cells) as harboring an autoaggressive T cell population shedding new insights into those disease processes. Th40 cells are present at contained levels in non-autoimmune individuals but are significantly expanded in autoimmunity. Th40 cells are necessary and sufficient in transferring type 1 diabetes in mouse models. However, little is known about CD40 signaling in T cells and whether there are differences in that signaling and subsequent outcome depending on disease conditions. When CD40 is engaged, CD40 and TNF-receptor associated factors, TRAFs, become associated with lipid raft microdomains. Dysregulation of T cell homeostasis is emerging as a major contributor to autoimmune disease and thwarted apoptosis is key in breaking homeostasis.Cells were sorted into CD4(hi) and CD4(lo) (Th40 cells) then treated and assayed either as whole or fractionated cell lysates. Protein expression was assayed by western blot and Nf-kappaB DNA-binding activity by electrophoretic mobility shifts. We demonstrate here that autoimmune NOD Th40 cells have drastically exaggerated expression of CD40 on a per-cell-basis compared to non-autoimmune BALB/c. Immediately ex-vivo, untreated Th40 cells from NOD mice have high levels of CD40 and TRAF2 associated with the raft microdomain while Th40 cells from NOR and BALB/c mice do not. CD40 engagement of Th40 cells induces Nf-kappaB DNA-binding activity and anti-apoptotic Bcl-X(L) expression in all three mouse strains. However, only in NOD Th40 cells is anti-apoptotic cFLIP(p43) induced which leads to preferential survival and proliferation. Importantly, CD40 engagement rescues NOD Th40 cells from Fas-induced death.CD40 may act as a switch between life and death promoting signals and NOD Th40 cells are poised for survival via this switch. This may explain how they expand in autoimmunity to thwart T cell homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2081781663,"The G protein-coupled receptor kinase-interacting protein 1 (GIT1) is a multidomain protein that plays an important role in cell adhesion, motility, cytoskeletal remodeling, and membrane trafficking. GIT1 mediates the localization of the p21-activated kinase (PAK) and PAK-interactive exchange factor to focal adhesions, and its activation is regulated by the interaction between its C-terminal paxillin-binding domain (PBD) and the LD motifs of paxillin. In this study, we determined the solution structure of rat GIT1 PBD by NMR spectroscopy. The PBD folds into a four-helix bundle, which is structurally similar to the focal adhesion targeting and vinculin tail domains. Previous studies showed that GIT1 interacts with paxillin through the LD4 motif. Here, we demonstrated that in addition to the LD4 motif, the GIT1 PBD can also bind to the paxillin LD2 motif, and both LD2 and LD4 motifs competitively target the same site on the PBD surface. We also revealed that paxillin Ser272 phosphorylation does not influence GIT1 PBD binding in vitro. These results are in agreement with the notion that phosphorylation of paxillin Ser272 plays an essential role in regulating focal adhesion turnover.

Both members of the GIT protein family, GIT1 and GIT2/p95-PKL, have an N-terminal Arf GTPase-activating protein domain, a Spa2-homology domain, a coiled-coil domain, and a C-terminal paxillin-binding domain (PBD). Previous studies have shown that the Spa2 homology domain binds the PAK ·PIX complex, and the PBD binds paxillin (11Zhao Z.S. Manser E. Loo T.H. Lim L. Mol. Cell.

Recently, a low-resolution structural model for the GIT1 PBD was derived from small-angle x-ray scattering and homology modeling, based on the structure of the FAK focal adhesion targeting (FAT) domain, which is a four-helix bundle protein (15Schmalzigaug R.

Mutagenesis studies suggest that paxillin binds the GIT1 PBD through the putative helices H1 and H4 (15Schmalzigaug R. Garron M.L. Roseman J.T. Xing Y. Davidson C.E. Arold S.T. Premont R.T. Cell. Signal. 2007; 19: 1733-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, a high-resolution structure of the GIT1 PBD is unavailable, and the mechanism of paxillin-GIT interaction remains unclear. Paxillin is one of the major binding partners of GIT proteins in FAs, functioning as an elongated adaptor protein that links actin filaments with integrin (18Brown M.C. Turner C.E. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 1315-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). It contains multiple docking sites for different signaling and structural proteins in FAs and comprises five N-terminal LD motifs and four C-terminal LIM domains (19Brown M.C. Curtis M.S. Turner C.E.

The LD motifs are named after their consensus sequence LDXLLXXL and bind with multiple proteins, including FAK, GIT, vinculin, actopaxin, and integrin-linked kinase (13Turner C.E. Brown M.C.

Structural studies have shown that the LD2 motif and the bound form of the LD4 motif form amphipathic α-helices, with several leucines forming a large hydrophobic patch (24Liu G. Guibao C.D. Zheng J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 36684-36692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Unlike FAK, the interaction between GIT1 and paxillin is reported to be mediated by the LD4 motif only (13Turner C.E. Brown M.C. Perrotta J.A. Riedy M.C. Nikolopoulos S.N. McDonald A.R. Bagrodia S.

Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 161-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In this study, we determined the solution structure of the PBD of rat GIT1 (residues 640–770) by NMR spectroscopy. Using synthesized LD peptides, we also studied the interaction between the GIT1 PBD and paxillin LD motifs. Our finding reconciles some controversial observations of earlier studies and provides a clearer picture of the role of GIT proteins in focal adhesion regulation. Protein Purification and Peptide Synthesis—Full-length rat GIT1 cDNA was a gift from Dr. Edward Manser. The sequence of rat GIT1 is identical to human GIT1 sequence except for one substitution (P644L) in the N-terminal unstructured region. We subcloned the GIT1 PBD (residues 640–770) into the pET28 vector (EMD Biosciences, San Diego, CA). The protein was overexpressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3). The 13C/15N-labeled sample was prepared by growing the cells in MOPS-buffered medium containing 15NH4Cl (1 g/liter) and [13C6]glucose (3.6 g/liter) (27Neidhardt F.C. Bloch P.L. Smith D.F. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 119: 736-747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins were purified using Ni2+-charged His-Bind resins (EMD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The His6 tag was removed by thrombin cleavage (EMD Biosciences) at room temperature for 4 h. The digested protein was dialyzed in 20 mm potassium phosphate (pH 6.5), 5 mm 1,4-dithiothreitol, and 5 mm EDTA and then further purified by gel filtration on a HiLoad 26/60 Superdex 75 HR column (GE Healthcare). Human paxillin LD2 (residues 140–161), LD4 (residues 261–282), and the LD4 peptide phosphorylated at Ser272 were chemically synthesized and purified by high pressure liquid chromatography at the Hartwell Center of Bioinformatics and Biotechnology. NMR Spectroscopy—The 15N/13C-double-labeled GIT1 PBD sample used for structure determination was ∼400 μl at a concentration of 1.2 mm in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5), 5 mm deuterated EDTA, 5 mm deuterated dithiothreitol, and 5% (v/v) D2O. All NMR spectra for structure determination were acquired at 37 °C with a Bruker Avance 600 or 800 MHz spectrometer equipped with a cryoprobe. To determine the residues exposed to the solvent, a 15N-labeled GIT1 PBD sample was first lyophilized in a Labconco FreeZone Plus 6 freeze dry system (Labconco Corp., Kansas City, MO) and dissolved in the same volume (400 μl) of D2O. 15N heteronuclear single-quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra were collected at 25 °C every 10 min by the Bruker 600 MHz spectrometer. Spectra were analyzed by the software Sparky (28Goddard, T. D., and Kneller, D. G. SPARKY 3, University of California, San Francisco, CAGoogle Scholar). NMR Data Analysis and Structure Calculation—All NMR spectra were processed with NMRPipe (29Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11280) Google Scholar) and analyzed with CARA (30Keller R. The Computer Aided Resonance Assignment Tutorial. 1st Ed. Verlag, Cantina, Switzerland2004Google Scholar). Backbone assignments were obtained based on CBCA(CO)NH, HNCACB, HNCA, and HN(CO)CA experiments. Side chain assignments were obtained by using HCCH-TOCSY, HCCH-COSY, HBHA(CO)NH, CC(CO)NH, and HCC(CO)NH spectra. Dihedral angle range was predicted by TALOS (31Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2727) Google Scholar). For structural determination, the nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) distance restraints were derived from 13C and 15N NOESY spectra. NOE spectra were first analyzed by an automatic algorithm with the software ATNOS/CANDID (32Herrmann T. Guntert P. Wuthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 2002; 24: 171-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 33Herrmann T. Guntert P. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 209-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1314) Google Scholar), and the results were then manually inspected and modified. Structure calculation and refinement were carried out by using the software CYANA 2.1 (34Guntert P. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1998; 31: 145-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The final structures were checked and validated by PROCHECK (35Laskowski R. MacArthur M. Moss D. Thornton J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Structure figures in this paper are generated by Molmol (36Koradi R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. Model. 1996; 14 (51–55): 29-32Google Scholar). For the electrostatic potential map, the figure was generated by Pymol, based on the electrostatic potential generated by GRASP (37Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Proteins. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5311) Google Scholar). The structure superposition and structure-based sequence alignment are generated by the Swiss-PdbViewer (38Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9399) Google Scholar). Chemical Shift Perturbation Titration—All NMR titration experiments were performed at 25 °C under the same conditions: 15N-labeled GIT1 PBD at a concentration of 400–450 μm in 20 mm potassium phosphate (pH 6.5), 5 mm deuterated EDTA, 5 mm deuterated dithiothreitol, and 5% (v/v) D2O. All peptide stocks were prepared in the same buffer, and their pH was readjusted to 6.5 before titration. Titrations were made by adding ligand at the following ratios: 1:0.5, 1:1, 1:2, and 1:5. A series of 15N HSQC spectra were taken on a Bruker Avance 600 MHz spectrometer with a cryoprobe, and data were analyzed with Sparky (28Goddard, T. D., and Kneller, D. G. SPARKY 3, University of California, San Francisco, CAGoogle Scholar). Biacore Binding Assay—Synthesized LD peptides with the N-terminal biotin tag were attached to a NeutrAvidin-covered gold surface (CM5 chip, GE Healthcare). Kinetic studies were performed at 20 °C with a Biacore 3000 (GE Healthcare). The purified GIT1 protein (in 20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 6.5), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.005% P20 surfactant) was injected to flow through the chip, and Kd was derived by fitting the data from three injections. The association and dissociation were observed at a flow rate of 50 μl/min in a concentration range of 1.4–110 μm. Binding affinities were determined by the program Scrubber 2 (version 2.0b, BioLogic Software). The experiment was repeated with chips covered with both high- and low-density peptides, and the results were found to be compatible. CD Spectroscopy—All CD spectra were obtained with an Aviv 62DS CD spectrometer (Aviv, Lakewood, NJ). The CD spectrum of the PBD was taken at 25 °C in 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 6.5) and 1 mm EDTA. The thermostability of the protein was determined by monitoring the CD signal of the PBD sample at 222 nm while increasing the sample temperature. Solution Structure of the GIT1 PBD Is a Four-helix Bundle—The PBD of rat GIT1 (residues 640–770) (Fig. 1a) was expressed in E. coli as a soluble protein, and CD spectroscopy showed that the protein was predominantly helical. The CD studies also showed that the protein was relatively stable, and it started to unfold at about 45 °C (supplemental Fig. S1). The solution structure of the PBD was determined by heteronuclear multidimensional NMR spectroscopy. After backbone and side chain assignments, the NOE constraints were obtained from both 15N- and 15N/13C-edited three-dimensional NOESY spectra. The structure of the PBD was determined based on 2440 NOE distance constraints and 189 dihedral angle constraints. The structures were calculated by CYANA, and 20 structures with the lowest target function value were selected and superimposed (Fig. 1b). Table 1 gives the final structural statistics. All experimental NMR constraints were satisfied, the average target function of the 20 structures selected is 0.7, and no NOE constraint violation was >0.2 Å. Most residues (81%) had dihedral angles in the most favored region of the Ramachandran plot, and 10.9% residues are in the additionally allowed region. The only residue in the disallowed region was Asp643, which is located in the unstructured N terminus. The solution structure was of high precision. The average root mean square deviations of the 20 structures from the average structure for backbone atoms and all heavy atoms of residues 643–767 were 0.39 and 0.77 Å, respectively. The coordinates and the structure factors of the GIT1 PBD have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with accession code 2JX0.TABLE 1Statistics of the GIT1 PBD structure determined by NMR spectroscopyDistance restraints Total no. of NOE restraints2440 Intraresidue574 Sequential750 Medium range718 Long range398 Restraints per residue18.07Dihedral angle restraints Total number of restraints189 ϕ angle restraints93 ψ angle restraints96Ramachandran plot (%) Residues in most favored regions88.1 Residues in additional allowed regions10.9 Residues in generously allowed regions0.5 Residues in disallowed regions0.4r.m.s.d.ar.m.s.d., root mean square deviation.

Open table in a new tab The GIT1 PBD forms a compact rod-shaped protein with a well defined C terminus and a slightly floppy N terminus. The C-terminal end is in proximity to the N terminus, a feature common to many functional independent domains. The PBD structure forms a four-helix bundle with a right-handed up-and-down topology, about 58 Å in height and 26 Å in diameter (Fig. 1c). The four helices form an antiparallel bundle, with many NOEs observed between helix turns and an average axis angle of 19.1° between neighboring helices. The hydrophobic side chains from all helices interlace to form a network of hydrophobic interactions that dramatically stabilize the bundle (Fig. 1, b and c). Extensive interhelical NOEs were observed, resulting in well defined side chains of the residues located in the interhelical regions (Fig. 1c). The PBD fold was confirmed by the solvent-exposed surface mapped by the hydrogen/deuterium (H/D) exchange experiments. Fast 15N HSQC spectra were taken immediately after dissolving the lyophilized 15N-labeled PBD in D2O. After the first 15 min, ∼57% of amide peaks had disappeared because of H/D exchange. All the protected peaks were in the helical regions, whereas most peaks that vanished belonged to the residues in the loop regions and the termini (Fig. 1d). Some peaks were protected even after 6 h; they were all within the core of the four-helix bundle. The H/D exchange data validates the 81 pairs of H-bonds in the structure, most of which were between Oi and HNi+4 from individual helices. Of the four helices in the PBD structure, H4 (30 residues) is slightly longer than helices H1 (23 residues), H2 (21 residues), and H3 (22 residues). The H3/H4 loop is longer than the H1/H2 loop, which may explain why H3 and H4 appear longer than H1 and H2 in the low-resolution small-angle x-ray scattering model (15Schmalzigaug R. Garron M.L. Roseman J.T. Xing Y. Davidson C.E. Arold S.T. Premont R.T. Cell. Signal. 2007; 19: 1733-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The GIT1 PBD had 11 prolines, all located in the loops or at the end of helices. The rigid backbone and hydrophobic side chain of proline make the loops less flexible, allowing us to observe extensive NOE connections between the loops and the rest of the protein. The PBD also has three cystines; the chemical shifts of C-β of all three cystines were less than 32 ppm, indicating that they were in the reduced forms (39Sharma D. Rajarathnam K. J. Biomol. NMR. 2000; 18: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). This might be caused by the presence of 5 mm dithiothreitol in the NMR sample buffer. In the solution structure, Cys683 and Cys725 are closely located in helices H2 and H3, and the distance between the C-α atoms of the two residues is 8.7 Å. A small degree of rotation of the Cys683 side chain or a slight change in the packing of the helices can bring the two cysteine side chains close enough to form a disulfide bond. Considering the high thermostability of the PBD, we cannot rule out the possibility of a disulfide bond bridge between the two cysteines. A sequence comparison of the GIT1 PBD with those of two other four-helix bundle domains, the FAT domain of FAK and the vinculin tail (Vt) domain, revealed that the hydrophobic residues in the core regions that hold the four helices together are well conserved among all three sequences (Fig. 1a). The best example of the hydrophobic residues is Leu721 in helix H3, wherein the side chain of the residue had hydrophobic contacts with side chains of Leu668, Ile687, Val746, and Cys749 (supplemental Fig. S2). In the structure-based sequence alignment, not only was Leu721 conserved among the three domains, but the residues that had hydrophobic contacts with this leucine were well conserved too. Although different in surface residues, the three domains share a conserved central hydrophobic network that holds the bundle together. The overall folding of the GIT1 PBD is very similar to that of the FAT domain of FAK (root mean square deviation value of 1.65 Å) and helices H2 to H5 of the Vt domain (root mean square deviation value of 1.68 Å calculated and averaged on C-α pairs) (supplemental Fig. S3). The Vt domain is a five-helix bundle, with the first helix attached to the groove between helices H2 and H5. The distance between Vt H2 and H5 is slightly more than that between GIT1 H1 and H4, probably because Vt H1 is attached to the groove. It has been demonstrated that the FAK FAT domain features helix H1 swapping dynamics and dimer formation (25Arold S.T. Hoellerer M.K. Noble M.E. Structure (Camb.). 2002; 10: 319-327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 40Prutzman K.C. Gao G. King M.L. Iyer V.V. Mueller G.A. Schaller M.D. Campbell S.L. Structure (Camb.). 2004; 12: 881-891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), although the biological importance of such a dimer in the context of full-length FAK is not very clear. However, unlike the FAT domain, our NMR data clearly indicated that PBD existed as a monomer in solution. In addition, the 15N HSQC spectrum of the PBD taken at 37 °C revealed that all amide peaks of the protein had similar intensity, suggesting that the PBD has few flexible loops. Also, a change of sample temperature from 37 to 13 °C resulted in a series of spectra showing all peaks with unchanged intensities; no local line broadening was observed when decreasing temperature (supplemental Fig. S4), further suggesting that the PBD was a rigid protein. It is likely that such difference in the two proteins was caused by the sequence of the loop that linked helices H1 and H2, the H1/H2 loop. In the PBD, the sequence of this loop is EFKH, whereas the equivalent loop in the FAT domain is PAPP; the three prolines in the FAT domain probably introduce the conformational strain that probably triggers the helix H1 swapping dynamics observed in the FAT domain. The PBD and the FAT Domain Are Similar on the H1/H4 Surface but Different on the H2/H3 Surface—Forming four amphipathic helices, the GIT1 PBD buries most of its hydrophobic side chains in the bundle core. There is only one major hydrophobic patch on the surface. As shown in Fig. 2a, side chains from H1 and H4 form two positive-charged ridges sandwiching an elongated hydrophobic groove, which covers about two-thirds of the bundle length. To the center of the H1/H4 surface, positively charged Lys663, Lys755, and Lys758, and polar residues Thr662, Gln666, and Tyr751 enclose a well defined hydrophobic pocket composed of Ile665, Ala754, and Ala757 at the bottom. These residues are conserved between GIT1 and GIT2 in all organisms for whom sequences are available. Among them, Lys663, Lys758, Ala754, and Ala757 are also conserved with the FAK FAT domain, with a conserved Ile665/Val936 substitution (Fig. 1a). This surface makes an ideal binding site for paxillin, as confirmed by chemical shift perturbation titration experiments. When the GIT1 PBD was compared with the FAT domain of FAK, the latter had two major hydrophobic grooves located at both the H1/H4 and H2/H3 faces, which correspond to the LD2 and LD4 motif binding sites, respectively (41Hoellerer M.K. Noble M.E. Labesse G. Campbell I.D. Werner J.M. Arold S.T. Structure (Camb.). 2003; 11: 1207-1217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2b). Both grooves have a surface setting similar to that of the H1/H4 site of the PBD: a hydrophobic groove with surrounding polar and positive-charged ridges. Structural superimposition of the PBD and the FAT domain revealed that GIT1 Lys663/FAK Lys934 and GIT1 Lys758/FAK Lys1033 were in the same position, which is another indication of functional similarity arising from structural similarity. The electrostatic interaction between the side chain of FAK Lys1033 and the conserved Asp146 in the LD2 motif might be important in determining binding specificity. Thus, we speculated that the analogous Lys663 and Lys758 in GIT1 might also greatly contribute to paxillin binding; this prediction was confirmed by the studies described in the next section. The FAT surface has two hydrophobic surfaces that serve as LD motif binding sites, but the GIT1 PBD has only one such surface (Fig. 2). In the FAT domain, helices H2 and H3 form a second hydrophobic surface, and at the center of the FAT H2/H3 site, the bottom of the hydrophobic pocket is composed of Gly959 and Ala996 on H2 and H3, respectively. However, the equivalent position on GIT1 PBD is occupied by bulky His688 and Tyr719, which effectively close the pocket. Moreover, the positively charged H2 ridge in the FAT domain is also eliminated by the substitutions of Lys956 and Arg963 in FAK by Glu685 and Thr692 in GIT1. Interestingly, we found that the Vt domain was more similar to FAK; for example, FAK Lys956 was conserved as Lys1021 in the Vt domain, whereas FAK Gly959 was substituted with a small residue Ala1024 in the Vt. This suggests a possible paxillin binding site on the H2/H3 surface of the Vt domain. Paxillin LD4 Motif Binds to the PBD at the H1/H4 Face—The binding between the GIT1 PBD and paxillin is essential to localize the PAK ·PIX ·GIT complex to the focal adhesion (42Brown M.C. West K.A. Turner C.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1550-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Although the interaction between the paxillin LD4 motif and GIT proteins had been proposed (11Zhao Z.S. Manser E. Loo T.H. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6354-6363Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 13Turner C.E. Brown M.C. Perrotta J.A. Riedy M.C. Nikolopoulos S.N. McDonald A.R.

Therefore, we analyzed the interaction between the GIT1 PBD and the paxillin LD4 motif by chemical shift"
https://openalex.org/W2090611257,"Development of a small animal model to study HIV replication and pathogenesis has been hampered by the failure of the virus to replicate in non-primate cells. Most studies aimed at achieving replication in murine cells have been limited to fibroblast cell lines, but generating an appropriate model requires overcoming blocks to viral replication in primary T cells. We have studied HIV-1 replication in CD4+ T cells from human CD4/ CCR5/Cyclin T1 transgenic mice. Expression of hCD4 and hCCR5 in mouse CD4+ T cells enabled efficient entry of R5 strain HIV-1. In mouse T cells, HIV-1 underwent reverse transcription and nuclear import as efficiently as in human T cells. In contrast, chromosomal integration of HIV-1 proviral DNA was inefficient in activated mouse T cells. This process was greatly enhanced by providing a secondary T cell receptor (TCR) signal after HIV-1 infection, especially between 12 to 24 h post infection. This effect was specific for primary mouse T cells. The pathways involved in HIV replication appear to be PKCθ−, CARMA1-, and WASp-independent. Treatment with Cyclosporin A (CsA) further relieved the pre-integration block. However, transcription of HIV-1 RNA was still reduced in mouse CD4+ T cells despite expression of the hCyclin T1 transgene. Additional post-transcriptional defects were observed at the levels of Gag expression, Gag processing, Gag release and virus infectivity. Together, these post-integration defects resulted in a dramatically reduced yield of infectious virus (300–500 fold) after a single cycle of HIV-1 replication. This study implies the existence of host factors, in addition to those already identified, that are critical for HIV-1 replication in mouse cells. This study also highlights the differences between primary T cells and cell lines regarding pre-integration steps in the HIV-1 replication cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1995815026,"Human checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) is an essential kinase required for cell cycle checkpoints and for coordination of DNA synthesis. To gain insight into the mechanisms by which Chk1 carries out these functions, we used mass spectrometry to identify previously uncharacterized interacting partners of Chk1. We describe a novel interaction between Chk1 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), an essential component of the replication machinery. Binding between Chk1 and PCNA was reduced in the presence of hydroxyurea, suggesting that the interaction is regulated by replication stress. A highly conserved PCNA-interacting protein (PIP) box motif was identified in Chk1. The intact PIP box is required for efficient DNA damage-induced phosphorylation and release of activated Chk1 from chromatin. We find that the PIP box of Chk1 is crucial for Chk1-mediated S-M and G(2)-M checkpoint responses. In addition, we show that mutations in the PIP box of Chk1 lead to decreased rates of replication fork progression and increased aberrant replication. These findings suggest an additional mechanism by which essential components of the DNA replication machinery interact with the replication checkpoint apparatus."
https://openalex.org/W2094987029,"Protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2) is activated when trypsin cleaves its NH(2) terminus to expose a tethered ligand. We previously demonstrated that PAR-2 activates ion channels in pancreatic duct epithelial cells (PDEC). Using real-time optical fluorescent probes, cyan fluorescence protein-Epac1-yellow fluorescence protein for cAMP, PH(PLC-delta1)-enhanced green fluorescent protein for phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, and protein kinase Cgamma (PKCgamma)-C1-yellow fluorescence protein for diacylglycerol, we now define the signaling pathways mediating PAR-2 effect in dog PDEC. Although PAR-2 activation does not stimulate a cAMP increase, it induces phospholipase C to hydrolyze phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate into inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol. Intracellular Ca(2+) mobilization from inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-sensitive Ca(2+) stores and a subsequent Ca(2+) influx through store-operated Ca(2+) channels cause a biphasic increase in intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)), measured with Indo-1 dye. Single-cell amperometry demonstrated that this increase in [Ca(2+)](i) in turn causes a biphasic increase in exocytosis. A protein kinase assay revealed that trypsin also activates PKC isozymes to stimulate additional exocytosis. Paralleling the increased exocytosis, mucin secretion from PDEC was also induced by trypsin or the PAR-2 activating peptide. Consistent with the serosal localization of PAR-2, 1 microm luminal trypsin did not induce exocytosis in polarized PDEC monolayers; on the other hand, 10 microm trypsin at 37 degrees C damaged the epithelial barrier sufficiently so that it could reach and activate the serosal PAR-2 to stimulate exocytosis. Thus, in PDEC, PAR-2 activation increases [Ca(2+)](i) and activates PKC to stimulate exocytosis and mucin secretion. These functions may mediate the reported protective role of PAR-2 in different models of pancreatitis."
https://openalex.org/W2081255014,"The tRNA tertiary core region is important for both tRNA stability and activity in the translation elongation cycle. Here we report the effects of mutating each of two highly conserved base pairs in the tertiary core of Phe-tRNAPhe, 18-55 and 19-56, on rate and equilibrium constants for specific steps of this cycle, beginning with formation of aminoacyl-tRNA·EF-Tu·GTP ternary complexs and culminating with translocation of A-site-bound peptidyl-tRNA into the P-site. We find that codon-dependent binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to the A/T-site and proofreading of near-cognate tRNA are sensitive to perturbation of either base pair; formation of the ternary complex and accommodation from the A/T to the A-site are sensitive to 18-55 perturbation only, and translocation of peptidyl-tRNA from the A- to P-site is insensitive to perturbation of either. These results underline the importance of the core region in promoting the efficiency and accuracy of translation, and they likely reflect different requirements for structural integrity of the core during specific steps of the elongation cycle. The tRNA tertiary core region is important for both tRNA stability and activity in the translation elongation cycle.

These results underline the importance of the core region in promoting the efficiency and accuracy of translation, and they likely reflect different requirements for structural integrity of the core during specific steps of the elongation cycle. The L-shaped conformation of tRNA is maintained by interactions between the D- and T-loops within the “tertiary core” region of the molecule. These interactions include two universally conserved base pairs, G18-Ψ55 (Ψ is a modification of U) and G19-C56, and a stacking interaction of three purines at the 18, 57, and 58 positions (Fig. 1A). The L-shaped conformation allows ribosome-bound tRNA to contact simultaneously the 30 S subunit decoding center, via its anticodon loop, and the 50 S subunit peptidyltransferase center, via its CCA end. Ribosome-bound tRNA, however, assumes conformations distinct from the classical L-shaped structure. Indeed, tRNA has been likened to a flexible spring that reversibly changes conformation during the process leading to recognition of cognate aminoacyl-tRNA at the A-site and peptide bond formation (1Frank J. Sengupta J. Gao H. Li W. Valle M. Zavialov A. Ehrenberg M. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 959-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Departures from the classical tRNA structure have also been seen for tRNA bound at the P- and E-sites (2Yusupov M.M. Yusupova G.Z. Baucom A. Lieberman K. Earnest T.N. Cate J.H. Noller H.F.

Science. 2006; 313: 1935-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar). Recent molecular dynamics studies have suggested that maintaining a balance between tRNA flexibility and rigidity is essential for optimizing the rate and accuracy of cognate tRNA recognition (5Sanbonmatsu K.Y.

Biochimie (Paris). 2006; 88: 1075-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and it is reasonable to suppose that this balance might be important for other steps of the elongation cycle as well, such as translocation. Mutations in the tertiary core and D-arm that could affect this balance are known to affect tRNA function during elongation. Thus, maintenance of the geometries of one or both of the 18-55 and 19-56 bp is essential for optimal aminoacyl-tRNA·EF-Tu·GTP ternary complex (TC) 4The abbreviations used are: TC, ternary complex (aminoacyl-tRNA·EF-Tu·GTP); 70SIC, 70 S initiation complex; PRE-AC, pre-accommodation; PRE-TR, pre-translocation; fMet-tRNAfMet(prf), fMet-tRNAfMet labeled with proflavin; Phe-tRNAPhe(prf), Phe-tRNAPhe labeled with proflavin; WT, wild type. 4The abbreviations used are: TC, ternary complex (aminoacyl-tRNA·EF-Tu·GTP); 70SIC, 70 S initiation complex; PRE-AC, pre-accommodation; PRE-TR, pre-translocation; fMet-tRNAfMet(prf), fMet-tRNAfMet labeled with proflavin; Phe-tRNAPhe(prf), Phe-tRNAPhe labeled with proflavin; WT, wild type. formation (7Peterson E.T.

Related studies on bacterial cells have also demonstrated the importance of tertiary core interactions for the overall rate of translation (8Doyon F.R. Zagryadskaya E.I. Chen J. Steinberg S.V. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 343: 55-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 10Herr A.J. Atkins J.F. Gesteland R.F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2886-2896Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Similarly, elevated error rates have been observed for D-arm variants (11Smith D. Yarus M. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 503-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 12Smith D. Yarus M. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 489-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, including the Hirsh mutation (G24A) (13Hirsh D. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 58: 439-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), which, although little affecting TC binding to a cognate codon, allows decoding of a near-cognate codon with relatively high efficiency (14Cochella L. Green R. Science. 2005; 308: 1178-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Despite these earlier examples, relatively little is known (15Nazarenko I.A. Harrington K.M. Uhlenbeck O.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2464-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) about the role of the tertiary core in tRNA function at the A-site. Here, using single and multiple turnover kinetics and binding experiments, we examine the effects of mutations in the G18-U55 and G19-C56 bp on each of four major steps comprising the elongation cycle (Fig. 1B) as follows: (i) TC formation; (ii) pre-accommodation (PRE-AC) complex formation which proceeds in three resolvable steps, an initial 2nd order binding step of the TC in which there is no codon-anticodon recognition, followed by two first-order steps in which cognate codon-anti-codon recognition is rapidly followed by GTP hydrolysis (16Pape T. Wintermeyer W. Rodnina M.V. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7490-7497Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar); (iii) pretranslocation complex (PRE-TR) formation, in which peptidyl-tRNA and discharged tRNA are located in the A- and P-sites, respectively. PRE-TR formation from the PRE-AC complex proceeds via Pi release from EF-Tu followed by a rapid conformational change in EF-Tu that results in dissociation of aminoacyl-tRNA from EF-Tu (17Kothe U. Rodnina M.V. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 12767-12774Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and either accommodation of aminoacyl-tRNA into the 50 S A-site followed by rapid peptide bond formation (18Bieling P. Beringer M. Adio S. Rodnina M.V. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 423-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) or dissociation of aminoacyl-tRNA from the ribosome prior to peptide bond formation, the latter constituting a form of proofreading; and (iv) EF-G·GTP-dependent translocation, in which discharged tRNA and peptidyl-tRNA move from the P- to E-site and A- to P-site, respectively, completing the elongation cycle. Translocation proceeds via a hybrid state intermediate, with the 3′ ends of tRNAs moving toward the P- and E-sites on the 50 S subunit, whereas the anti-codons of tRNAs remain in A- and P-sites on the 30 S subunit (19Pan D. Kirillov S.V. Cooperman B.S. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 519-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Ribosomes and Proteins—Tight-coupled ribosomes were prepared from Escherichia coli MRE600 cells as described (9Pan D. Kirillov S. Zhang C.M. Hou Y.M. Cooperman B.S. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 354-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Clones of E. coli His-tagged proteins EF-G, EF-Tu, IF1, IF2, and IF3 were obtained as described (9Pan D. Kirillov S. Zhang C.M. Hou Y.M. Cooperman B.S. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 354-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and the proteins were purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Qiagen) columns, except that EF-G went though an additional fast protein liquid chromatography Mono Q column with a gradient of 50-350 mm KCl in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 6 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. EF-Ts was a gift from Dr. Yale E. Goldman (University of Pennsylvania). mRNAs—mRNA022UUU was prepared from JM109 cells transformed with pTZ18 plasmid containing the 022 sequence under a T7 promoter, which was provided by Dr. C. Gualerzi (University of Camerino). The plasmid was extracted, restricted, and then transcribed using the EPICENTRE Ampliscribe T7 flash transcription kit. mRNA was purified by precipitation with 2.5 m LiCl on ice (30 min). mRNA022CUC was made by mutation of UUU to CUC, using the QuickChange protocol (Qiagen) followed by a preparation procedure essentially identical to that described for making mRNA022UUU. tRNAs—Native E. coli tRNAfMet and tRNAPhe were acquired from Chemical Block (Moscow, Russia). Mutations were introduced into plasmid pTFMa (a derivative of pUC18) containing E. coli WT-tRNAPhe sequence using the QuickChange protocol (Qiagen) and confirmed by DNA sequencing. Plasmids harboring the WT-tRNAPhe sequence and its variants were purified, restricted with BstNI, and transcribed by T7 RNA polymerase. His-tagged E. coli PheRS, purified on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Qiagen) column was used to charge both native tRNAPhe and transcribed tRNAPhe (WT or variants). Charging was carried out by incubating 20 μm tRNAPhe, 80 μm [3H]Phe, and 30 μg/ml PheRS in Buffer C (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 4 mm ATP, 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and 7 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) at 37 °C for 10 min. Purification of the charged tRNAs was carried out on fast protein liquid chromatography using a Mono Q column with a gradient of 0-1 m NaCl in 50 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.0). tRNAfMet labeled with proflavin (prf), denoted tRNAfMet-(prf), was prepared by replacing the dihydrouridine residue at position 20 with proflavin, as described (9Pan D. Kirillov S. Zhang C.M. Hou Y.M. Cooperman B.S. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 354-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 19Pan D. Kirillov S.V. Cooperman B.S. Mol.

Y.). 2007; 13: 1594-1601Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). 40 μl of NaBH4 (100 mg/ml in 0.01 m KOH) was added to tRNAfMet (1 mg in 400 μl of 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5)), followed by incubation on ice for 60 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 20 μl of 6 m acetic acid and ethanol precipitation. The resulting pellet was dissolved in 50 μl of water, which was then mixed with 1 ml of 2 mm proflavin (in 0.1 m sodium formate (pH 3.0)) and incubated at 37 °C for 45 min. To remove unreacted dye, the solution was adjusted to pH 7.5 with Tris, extracted with buffer-saturated phenol (three times), and precipitated with ethanol (twice). Unlabeled and prf-labeled tRNAfMet were charged and formylated with partially purified E. coli tRNA synthetase containing MetRS and formyltransferase by incubating 20 μm tRNAfMet, 80 μm [35S]methionine (2000 dpm/pmol), 720 μm folinic acid (as a formyl donor), and 1/10 volume of crude E. coli aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase in Buffer C′ (Buffer C plus 10 mm KCl) at 37 °C for 30 min. Crude synthetase was prepared from the supernatant resulting from ultracentrifugation of E. coli MRE600 cell lysate (40,000 rpm, 18 h, Beckman rotor Ti70.1) through 6 ml of 1.1 m sucrose in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 500 mm NH4Cl, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 3 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. The supernatant was passed through a DEAE-cellulose column, and fractions with A280/A260 ≥ 1.5 were pooled. Complex Formation—All complexes were made up in Buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 70 mm NH4Cl, 30 mm KCl, 7 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol) at 37 °C. 70SIC was formed by incubating 2 μm 70 S ribosome, 8 μm mRNA, 3 μm each of IF1, IF2, IF3, and fMet-tRNAfMet, and 1 mm GTP for 25 min. TC was formed by incubating 5 μm EF-Tu, 1 μm [3H]Phe-tRNAPhe, 1 mm GTP, 1.5 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, and 0.5 mg/liter pyruvate kinase for 5 min, unless otherwise specified. PRE-TR complex was formed by incubating 0.8 μm 70SIC with 0.4 μm TC. Prior to use in stoichiometric or kinetic assays, 70SIC and PRE-TR complex were purified by centrifugation through a 1.1 m sucrose cushion (450,000 × g, 40 min, 4 °C) in Buffer A and Buffer B (same as Buffer A but with 20 mm MgCl2), respectively. Measurement of Kd for TC Formation—Kd values for binding of Phe-tRNAPhe to EF-Tu·GTP were determined by RNase protection assay (22Pleiss J.A. Uhlenbeck O.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 895-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Buffer TC contains all components of Buffer A, 100 μm GTP, 10 μg/ml pyruvate kinase, and 2 mm phosphoenolpyruvate. EF-Tu was incubated in buffer TC at 37 °C for 5 min to exchange any GDP bound to EF-Tu for GTP. Such exchange occurs because of contamination of EF-Tu with small amounts of EF-Ts (23Arai K. Arai N. Nakamura S. Oshima T. Kaziro Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 92: 521-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Samples of EF-Tu·GTP solution (10 nm to 16 μm, 25 μl) were mixed with 25 μl of 50 nm [3H]Phe-tRNAPhe in buffer TC on ice, incubated at 37 °C for 5 min, and placed on ice for 30 min. 5 μl of 0.05 mg/ml bovine pancreatic RNase A (Sigma) was then added, and incubation was continued for 15 s on ice, followed by quenching with 200 μl of 10% cold trichloroacetic acid. EF-Tu protected [3H]Phe-tRNAPhe was collected on nitrocellulose filters after three washes of 1 ml of 5% cold trichloroacetic acid. The filters were dried, dissolved in 1 ml of ethyl acetate, and counted in a scintillation counter, providing a measure of TC concentration. Kd values for various Phe-tRNAPhe were calculated by fitting results determined as a function of EF-Tu to Equation 1, using Igor-Pro (Wavemetrics). Stoichiometric Assays—TC binding to 70SIC was measured by a filter binding assay, using nitrocellulose filters (pore size 0.45 μm, Millipore), 2× 3-ml washes with Buffer A, and drying [TC]=([Phe−tRNA]+[EF−Tu]+Kd)−[(Phe−tRNA]+[EF−Tu]+Kd)2−4[Phe−tRNA][EF−Tu]2(Eq. 1) of filters before counting. Final concentrations were as follows: 70SIC, 0.4 μm; EF-Tu, 1 μm;[3H]Phe-tRNAPhe 0.2 μm; GTP, 100 μm; volume, 20 μl. Samples were incubated for 1 min at 37 °C before filtering. Dipeptide formation was measured using the chromatographic method described below. Kinetics—All kinetics experiments were carried out in Buffer A at 25 °C. All concentrations given below are final, after mixing. Rapid kinetics experiments were performed either with a Kintek quenched flow apparatus (fMet-Phe formation, GTP hydrolysis, fMet-Phe-puromycin formation) or with an Applied Photophysics SX.18MV stopped-flow spectrofluorometer (accommodation and translocation). The slow dissociation of fMet-[3H]Phe-tRNAPhe from the A-site was monitored by nitrocellulose filtration. fMet-Phe Formation—[3H]Phe-labeled TC complex (0.2 μm) was rapidly mixed with 70SIC (0.4 μm). Reactions were quenched with 5 m NH4OH, lyophilized, taken up in 500 μl of water, applied to a cation exchange column (Bio-Rad 50W-X8, 400 μl) that had been prewashed with 0.01 m HCl and water, and eluted with water. 3H-Labeled fMet-Phe eluted in the flow-through and ∼5 column volumes. Values shown are corrected for a background measured in the absence of 70SIC. GTP Hydrolysis and Accommodation—TC was formed by incubating 4 μm EF-Tu, 4 μm [3H]Phe-tRNAPhe, and 0.8 μm [γ-32P]GTP. 0.2 μm TC (calculated from the concentration of [γ-32P]GTP) was rapidly mixed with 0.4 μm 70SIC. After quenching with 0.6 m HClO4, aliquots (50 μl) were mixed with 20 mm sodium molybdate (150 μl), the resulting dodecamolybdate complex was extracted with an equal volume of ethyl acetate, and radioactivity was determined in a scintillation counter. Accommodation was monitored by changes in the fluorescence on rapidly mixing TC (0.2 μm) with 70SIC (0.4 μm) containing fMet-tRNAfMet(prf). Translocation—PRE-TR complex (0.12 μm) containing tRNAPhe was rapidly mixed with 1 μm EF-G, 1 mm GTP, and 5 mm puromycin. To prevent dissociation of fMet-Phe-tRNAPhe prior to translocation, the syringe containing pretranslocation complex was cooled in an ice bath. fMet-[3H]Phe-puromycin was extracted into ethyl acetate, and radioactivity was determined. fMet-Phe-tRNAPhe Dissociation—70SIC (0.2 μm) was mixed with [3H]Phe-labeled TC (0.12 μm) and incubated at 25 °C. Aliquots were analyzed by nitrocellulose filtration at different time points (1-180 min). [3H]Phe in the filtrate measures dissociation of fMet-[3H]Phe-tRNAPhe (24Semenkov Y.P. Rodnina M.V. Wintermeyer W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1027-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Determination of Rate Constants and Functional Homogeneity—With one clear exception, the U55A variant, each Phe-tRNAPhe preparation (WT or variant) gave rates and stoichiometries of ribosome-dependent reactions consistent with complete or near-complete functional homogeneity. Thus, rates of fMet-Phe-tRNA dissociation, GTP hydrolysis, fMet-Phe formation, and translocation were well fit to single exponential equations, giving apparent first-order rate constants, with stoichiometries per TC formed similar to those obtained with native or WT Phe-tRNAPhe. Fitting the rates of accommodation of tRNAPhe transcripts required a double exponential equation. However, for all of the transcripts except U55A, 75-90% of the total fluorescence change occurs in the rapid first phase of reaction, so even with this assay the extent of any putative functional heterogeneity would be quite limited. In contrast, the U55A variant preparation could have considerable functional heterogeneity, because its ribosome-dependent reactions proceed with low stoichiometry, and the fluorescent change accompanying accommodation does not show a dominant first phase. Fits to exponential equations were carried out with Igor-Pro (Wavemetrics). kcat and Km values were obtained by fitting the curves of k′GTP as a function of 70SIC concentration to the Michaelis-Menten equation. tRNA Variant Preparation—tRNAPhe was transcribed and contained the wild-type sequence (WT-tRNAPhe) or variations in the 18, 19, 55, and/or 56 positions (Fig. 1A). WT transcript differs from the native tRNAPhe, isolated from E. coli cells, in having no post-transcriptional modification, and it is used for direct comparison with transcribed variants. Initial Screening of Variants—Four assays (Table 1) were used to test each of the 12 tRNAPhe variants for functional Phe-tRNAPhe interaction with the A-site, following addition of the corresponding [3H]Phe-tRNAPhe·EF-Tu·GTP TC to a 70 S initiation complex (70SIC) containing fMet-tRNAfMet in the P-site and an empty A-site programmed with an UUU codon as follows: (i) the initial stoichiometry of Phe-tRNAPhe binding to the A-site via the TC complex; (ii and iii) the stoichiometry and rate (k′dp) of dipeptide formation; and (iv) the rate of peptidyl-tRNA dissociation (k′d) from the A-site following dipeptide formation. Here an increased value indicates destabilization of peptidyl-tRNA binding to the A-site.TABLE 1Preliminary screening: relative values for EF-Tu·GTP·Phe-tRNAPhe binding, dipeptide formation, and fMetPhe-tRNAPhe dissociation (UUU codon)tRNAPheInitial Phe-tRNAPhe bindingDipeptide stoichiometryk′dpaApparent net rate constant for peptide bond formation is shown.k′dbApparent net rate constant for fMetPhe-tRNAPhe dissociation from the ribosome is shown.EF-Tu, 1 μMEF-Tu, 5 μMs−1s−1Native1.06 ± 0.051.04 ± 0.051.27 ± 0.090.94 ± 0.15WT transcriptcValues for WT transcript are as follows: filter binding, 0.70 ± 0.05 (EF-Tu, 1 μM) and 0.69 ± 0.03 (EF-Tu, 5 μM), Phe-tRNAPhe bound/total Phe-tRNAPhe (Phe-tRNAPhe is the limiting reagent); dipeptide formed/total Phe added, 0.81 ± k′dp, 2.2 ± 0.2 s−1.

Gromadski and Rodnina (25Gromadski K.B. Rodnina M.V. Mol.

Open table in a new tab Measured at an EF-Tu concentration of 1 μm, mutation effects in reducing initial Phe-tRNAPhe binding are, for the most part, modest (Table 1). The strongest effects on TC binding are found for U55A (4-fold decrease) and C56G and G18U/U55A (∼2-fold decreases). The latter two decreases largely disappear when the measurement is repeated at a higher EF-Tu concentration (5 μm), indicating that they are due more to a defect in TC formation (see below) than in TC binding to the ribosome. However, raising EF-Tu concentration does not significantly increase the stoichiometry of Phe-tRNAPhe binding for U55A, suggesting that this mutation directly perturbs Phe-tRNAPhe interaction with the A-site. Additional evidence for such a perturbation is provided by the larger negative effect that U55A mutation has on the stoichiometry of dipeptide formation than on the stoichiometry of initial Phe-tRNAPhe binding. This contrasts with the largely similar effects that almost all of the other mutants (G19C excepted) have on both stoichiometric assays. More pronounced effects are seen on apparent rate constants (Table 1). For k′dp, the largest decreases are for U55A, G18U/U55A, and G19C (8-10-fold) and G18A, C56A, and C56G (3-4-fold), whereas for k′d, the largest increases (5-9-fold) are found for U55G, G18U/U55A, G19U, and C56G. The dissociation rate for U55A was not determined accurately because of its low binding stoichiometry but is likely to be relatively rapid, given the evidence for perturbed Phe-tRNAPhe binding to the A-site. In both assays, WT function is fully or partly restored in 19-56 double variants that preserve Watson-Crick base pairing. Selection of Variants for Further Study—Five variants (U55A, G18U/U55A, G19U, C56A, and G19U/C56A) were selected for particularly close scrutiny, to determine which step or steps in the overall process of PRE-TR complex formation were responsible for the effects observed. The first four variants were selected because, with the exception of U55A, they have relatively large effects on the rate and smaller effects on the stoichiometry of dipeptide formation (U55A strongly affects both), allowing us to concentrate our analysis on the rate constants. The G19U/C56A variant was selected to more fully examine the rescuing effect of a second mutation that restores a 19-56 Watson-Crick base pair. Binding of Phe-tRNAPhe to the ribosomal A-site, leading to PRE-TR complex formation, includes three readily distinguishable steps (Fig. 1B) as follows: (a) formation of the TC, (b) formation of the PRE-AC complex, and (c) formation of the PRE-TR complex. Below we determine the effects of the selected mutations on each of these three steps. TC Formation—The binding affinities to EF-Tu·GTP of native Phe-tRNAPhe, its WT transcript, and the five selected variants were determined by the ribonuclease protection assay (22Pleiss J.A. Uhlenbeck O.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 895-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), giving the dissociation constants displayed in Table 2. The largest effects are seen for U55A and G18U/U55A, which have 15-20-fold lower affinities than WT-Phe-tRNAPhe for EF-Tu·GTP. G19U and C56A are less affected, with 6- and 1.7-fold lower affinities, respectively, although for G19U/C56A binding affinity is restored to a level close to that of the WT transcript. Structural studies of the ternary complex (26Nissen P. Kjeldgaard M. Thirup S. Polekhina G. Reshetnikova L. Clark B.F. Nyborg J. Science. 1995; 270: 1464-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar) show a contact between EF-Tu and the backbone of nucleotide 54. Thus, although EF-Tu does not directly interact with the 18-55 bp, the comparatively large effects of 18-55 mutations on TC formation may reflect a perturbation of the stacking interaction that the 18-55 bp makes with the intraloop 54-58 bp (Fig. 1A). The smaller effects of mutations at 19-56 are consistent with their being even further from EF-Tu within the TC, and with earlier results showing that the G19C and C56G mutations have only minor effects on TC formation (15Nazarenko I.A. Harrington K.M. Uhlenbeck O.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2464-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The similarity in the values for native and WT-Phe-tRNAPhe binding to EF-Tu is also in accord with earlier results (27Harrington K.M. Nazarenko I.A. Dix D.B. Thompson R.C. Uhlenbeck O.C.

https://openalex.org/W2116696802,"Although the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor plays a critical role in the central nervous system, many questions remain regarding the relationship between its structure and functional properties. In particular, the involvement of ligand-binding domain closure in determining agonist efficacy, which has been reported in other glutamate receptor subtypes, remains unresolved. To address this question, we designed dual cysteine point mutations spanning the NR1 and NR2 ligand-binding clefts, aiming to stabilize these domains in closed cleft conformations. Two mutants, E522C/I691C in NR1 (EI) and K487C/N687C in NR2 (KN) were found to exhibit significant glycine- and glutamate-independent activation, respectively, and co-expression of the two subunits produced a constitutively active channel. However, both individual mutants could be activated above constitutive levels in a concentration-dependent manner, indicating that cleft closure does not completely prevent agonist association. Interestingly, whereas the NR2 KN disulfide was found to potentiate channel gating and M3 accessibility, NR1 EI exhibited the opposite phenotype, suggesting that the EI disulfide may trap the NR1 ligand-binding domain in a lower efficacy conformation. Furthermore, both mutants affected agonist sensitivity at the opposing subunit, suggesting that closed cleft stabilization may contribute to coupling between the subunits. These results support a correlation between cleft stability and receptor activation, providing compelling evidence for the Venus flytrap mechanism of glutamate receptor domain closure."
https://openalex.org/W2070293741,"Inh3 (inhibitor-3) is a potent inhibitor of protein phosphatase-1 that selectively associates with PP1gamma1 and PP1alpha but not the PP1beta isoform. We demonstrate that Inh3 is a novel substrate for caspase-3 and is degraded in vivo during apoptosis induced by actinomycin D. Inh3 was not degraded in apoptotic MCF-7 cells, which lack caspase-3. These experiments establish that Inh3 is a novel physiological substrate of caspase-3. Electroporation of the caspase-3-resistant Inh3-D49A mutant into HL-60 cells resulted in a significant attenuation of apoptosis induced by actinomycin D. These results show that Inh3 degradation contributes to the apoptotic process. Immunofluorescence based examination of the subcellular localizations of Inh3 and PP1gamma1 revealed a major relocalization of the cellular pool of PP1gamma1 from the nucleolus to the nucleus and then to the cytoplasm during actinomycin D-induced apoptosis. A similar redistribution of PP1alpha from the nucleus to the cytoplasm occurred. These results are consistent with an unexpected discovery that significant fractions of the cellular pools of PP1gamma1 and PP1alpha are associated with Inh3 in HL-60 cells. Thus, Inh3 is a major factor in the cellular economy of PP1gamma1 and PP1alpha subunits. The unscheduled relocalization of this large a pool of PP1 subunits and their release from a potent inhibitor could deregulate a diverse range of essential cellular processes and signaling pathways. We discuss the significance of these findings in relation to working hypotheses whereby Inh3 destruction could contribute to the apoptotic process."

We report stationary and time-resolved resonance Raman spectra of the wild-type and several mutants (Glu-93 → Ile, Met-95 → Ala, Arg-97 → Ile, Arg-97 → Ala, Arg-97 → Glu, Phe-113 → Leu, and Phe-113 → Thr) of the heme-containing PAS domain of Ec DOS. For the CO- and NO-bound forms, both the hydrogen-bonded and non-hydrogen-bonded conformations were found, and in the former Arg-97 forms a hydrogen bond with the heme-bound external ligand. The resonance Raman results revealed significant interactions of Arg-97 and Phe-113 with a ligand bound to the sixth coordination site of the heme and profound structural changes in the heme propionates upon dissociation of CO. Mutation of Phe-113 perturbed the PDE activities, and the mutation of Arg-97 and Phe-113 significantly influenced the transient binding of Met-95 to the heme upon photodissociation of CO. This suggests that the electrostatic interaction of Arg-97 and steric interaction of Phe-113 are crucial for regulating the competitive recombination of Met-95 and CO to the heme.

The Ec DOS is composed of a C-terminal PDE catalytic domain and the N-terminal heme-containing domain. The latter is a prototypical PAS domain, which is a ubiquitous protein sensory domain found in all kingdoms (9Taylor B.L. Zhulin I.B. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 479-506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and has a conserved α/β folds consisting of ∼147 residues (10Park H.J. Suquet C. Satterlee J.D. Kang C.

Thus, Ec DOS is a novel gas-sensor enzyme that has unprecedented ability to be activated by different gas molecules. Because the CO and NO concentrations in the cells are very low (nanomolar), it is likely that Ec DOS is predominantly an oxygen sensor enzyme whereby catalysis is regulated in response to the micromolar O2 level (16Huang S.H. Rio D.C. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 15115-15122Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). It is believed that the structural changes in the heme vicinity caused by ligand binding to the heme provide the initial event in the gas sensing, followed by intramolecular signal transduction from the heme to the functional domain, and thus regulating the PDE activity. Fig. 1 illustrates the crystal structure of the truncated heme sensor domain (Ec DOSH) of Ec DOS protein (10Park H.J. Suquet C. Satterlee J.D. Kang C. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2738-2746Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In the reduced form (Fig. 1A), Met-95 and His-77 are the heme axial ligands in the distal and proximal sides, respectively, and Met-95 forms a hydrogen bond with heme 7-propionate. Upon O2 binding to the reduced heme, Met-95 is replaced by O2 and heme 7-propionate forms a hydrogen bond with Arg-97 instead of Met-95. This stabilizes the heme-coordinated O2 (Fig. 1B). Thus, the replacement of a distal axial ligand from Met-95 to O2 perturbs the heme 7-propionate hydrogen bonding network, resulting in large conformational changes in the FG loop (10Park H.J. Suquet C. Satterlee J.D. Kang C. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2738-2746Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the role of other distal residues (Fig. 1) and the heme 7-propionate hydrogen bonding network are not clear in the CO- or NO-sensing mechanism. To understand the gas-sensing mechanism of Ec DOS, it is essential to determine the changes in the heme and surrounding structures caused by distal ligand binding/dissociation. Although the crystal structure provides information about the O2-free (reduced) and O2-bound forms (10Park H.J. Suquet C. Satterlee J.D. Kang C. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2738-2746Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), there is not enough information available about how the structural changes are transmitted from the heme to the PDE catalytic domain. A useful way to answer this question for heme proteins is to use time-resolved studies, in which the ligand dissociation reaction is initiated by photodissociation of heme-bound external ligand. In the present study, we have performed stationary and time-resolved resonance Raman (TR3) investigations of wild-type (WT) Ec DOSH and several variants (E93I, M95A, R97I, R97A, R97E, F113L, and F113T) and examined the enzymatic activities for the full-length Ec DOS. We found the simultaneous presence of hydrogen-bonded and non-hydrogen-bonded forms for CO and NO adducts, and Arg-97 forms a hydrogen bond with the heme-bound external ligand. We also point out the importance of Arg-97, Phe-113, and heme propionates in the regulation of ligand binding at the distal side. Sample Preparation—Cloning of the full-length Ec DOS and the heme-containing sensor domain Ec DOSH, the construction of expression plasmids, and the purification procedure of the WT and mutant proteins were performed essentially as described previously (8Sasakura Y.

Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by using a PCR-based approach as implemented in the QuikChange™ kit (Stratagene). The purities of Ec DOS samples were confirmed to be >95% homogeneous by SDS-PAGE. For RR measurements, Ec DOSH was further purified by gel filtration through Superdex 75 (26/60 cm) pre-equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer at pH 7.5. The concentration of protein was adjusted to 100 μm in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5). The oxidized Ec DOSH was prepared by adding an excess amount of potassium ferricyanide to the purified protein and afterward potassium ferricyanide was removed by gel filtration with Sephadex G-25. Reduced Ec DOSH was prepared by adding a minimum amount of sodium dithionite solution (final concentration, 0.5 mm) into the protein solution under nitrogen atmosphere. The NO-adduct of Ec DOSH was prepared by incubating the dithionite-reduced Ec DOSH with NO-saturated buffer. For TR3 experiments, ∼100 μl of 200 μm oxidized protein (50 mm Tris-HCl buffer at pH 7.5), was transferred to an airtight spinning cell, into which CO gas was incorporated to a pressure of 1 atm (after evacuation of the internal pressure to 0.01 mmHg). The pump/fill procedure was repeated at least three times, and finally a small amount of degassed dithionite solution (final concentration, 0.5 mm) was added for the reduction of the oxidized protein. Resonance Raman Measurements—RR spectra of Ec DOSH proteins were obtained with a single polychromator (SPEX750M, Jobin Yvon) equipped with a liquid nitrogen-cooled charge-coupled device detector (Spec10:400BLN, Roper Scientific). The excitation wavelength employed was 413.1 nm from a krypton ion laser (BeamLok 2060, Spectra Physics). The laser power at the sample point was adjusted to 1 milliwatt for the oxidized, reduced, and NO-bound forms and to 0.1 milliwatt for the CO-bound form to prevent photodissociation. Raman shifts were calibrated with indene, acetone, and an aqueous solution of ferrocyanide. The accuracy of the peak positions of well defined Raman bands was ±1 cm-1. Time-resolved Resonance Raman Measurements—Nanosecond TR3 experiments were performed as described previously (17Sakan Y. Ogura T. Kitagawa T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5815-5824Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). TR3 spectra were obtained with two 10-ns pulsed lasers operating at 30 Hz. The probe light (435.7 nm) was generated by the H2-first anti Stokes Raman shift of the second harmonic of an Nd:YAG laser (Quanta-Ray, LAB-130), and its power was made as low as possible (∼80 μJ) to avoid photodissociation by the probe pulse. The pump light (532.0 nm) was the second harmonic of an Nd:YAG laser (Quanta-Ray, LAB-130), and its power was adjusted to 5 mJ/pulse at the sample point. The delay time (Δtd) of the probe pulse from the pump pulse was controlled through independent firing of two Q-switch lasers by a pulse generator (Stanford Research, DG-535) for Δtd values between -0.5 μs and 1 ms and was monitored on an oscilloscope (Iwasaki, DS-4242) by photodiode detection. Scattered light at right angle was collected and focused by two synthetic quartz lenses onto an entrance slit of a single spectrograph (Spex, 500M) equipped with a non-blazed holographic grating and a liquid nitrogen-cooled charge-coupled device detector (Princeton Instruments, CDD-1100PB). Raman shifts were calibrated using indene, and the accuracy of frequencies are ±1 cm-1 for well defined peaks. Phosphodiesterase Assay—PDE activities of the full-length Ec DOS were determined using a colorimetric assay for free phosphate as described previously (15Atsunari Tanaka A. Takahashi H. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 21301-21307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The measurements were performed under anaerobic conditions (O2 concentration < 10 ppm) in a glove box. Phe-113 mutants were fully reduced by adding 10 mm dithiothreitol, and the formation of the reduced form was confirmed by absorption spectroscopy. The CO- and O2-bound forms were prepared by diluting the sample in the gas-saturated, reduced PDE solution containing 10 mm dithiothreitol. The NO-bound form was prepared by adding 50-100 μm 6-(2-hydroxy-1-methyl-2-nitrosohydrazine)-N-methyl-1-hexanamine to the sample of the reduced form. The PDE reaction was performed at 25 °C in a mixture with 71.4 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 71.4 mm NaCl, 7.14 mm MgCl2, 2.14 units/μl calf intestine alkaline phosphatase, 14.3 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.29 μm Ec DOS and initiated by the addition of 0.3 volume of 0.33 mm 3′,5′-cyclic diguanylic acid (purchased from BIOLOG, Bremen, Germany). After the desired time, the reaction was terminated by the addition of an equal volume of 1 m HCl. The solution was then centrifuged for 5 min at 15,000 × g to remove denatured proteins as precipitates. The supernatant (100 μl) was mixed with 200 μl of BIOMOL Green, and the mixture was incubated at 25 °C for 30 min. The change in absorbance at 630 nm was measured. The initial rates of the reactions are averages of at least three time course experiments. The crystal structure of the O2-bound form of Ec DOSH showed that Arg-97 forms hydrogen bonds with the heme-coordinated O2 (Fig. 1B), while the interactions of the heme-bound CO or NO with the surrounding residues are not known. To investigate these interactions, we prepared several mutants of the heme distal side residues (E93I, M95A, R97I, and F113L) and measured their RR spectra. It is well established that the heme of WT Ec DOSH adopts a six-coordinate low spin (6c-ls) state in the oxidized and reduced forms (18Gonzalez G. Dioum E.M. Bertolucci C.M. Tomita T. Ikeda-Saito M.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4819-4826Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The RR spectra of the reduced form for the mutants are similar to that of WT except for M95A mutant, in which the mutation of the distal axial ligand (Met-95 in Fig. 1A), produces a 5-coordinate high spin (5c-hs) structure (supplemental Fig. S1). In addition, the RR spectra of the oxidized form for all the mutants are similar to that of WT (supplemental Fig. S1). The spectral similarity of M95A to WT was expected, because hydroxy ion (or water molecule) is coordinated to the heme axial site in the oxidized form as revealed by the crystal structure (11Kurokawa H. Lee D.-S. Watanabe M. Sagami I. Mikami B. Raman C.S. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20186-20193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the mutations cause no significant change on the coordination- and spin-states of the oxidized heme of the mutants. Binding of Different Ligands—Because of the sensitivity of the Fe-CO and the C-O stretching frequencies to the heme environment, the CO adducts of heme proteins provide a valuable probe of the heme pocket. The CO-isotope dependence in RR spectra of CO-bound form of WT Ec DOSH is illustrated in Fig. 2. Spectra a and b in Panel A represent the spectra of 12C16O and 13C18O, respectively, in the 300-650 cm-1 region, and spectra d and e in panel B represent the spectra of 12C16O and 13C18O, respectively, in the region 1800-2100 cm-1. Spectra c and f display the isotope difference spectra (c = a and b, and f = d and e). It is obvious from the difference spectra that the 488, 1924, and 1970 cm-1 bands of 12C16O are shifted to 477, 1837, and 1879 cm-1, respectively, after isotopic labeling. Accordingly, the 488 cm-1 band is assigned to the Fe-CO stretching and the 1924 and 1970 cm-1 bands to C-O stretching. On the basis of the empirical νCO-environment correlation obtained with myoglobin (Mb), the νCO frequencies observed at 1910-1930, 1940-1950, and 1960-1970 cm-1 correspond to CO with strong hydrogen bonding interaction, moderate hydrogen bonding interaction, and neutral surrounding, respectively (21Li T.S. Quillin M.L. Philips Jr., G.N. Olson J.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1433-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we assign the major (1970 cm-1) and minor bands (1924 cm-1) to non-hydrogen bonded and strongly hydrogen bonded C-O modes of the heme Fe-CO, respectively. The detection of the major band has been reported previously for the Ec DOSH (18Gonzalez G. Dioum E.M. Bertolucci C.M. Tomita T. Ikeda-Saito M. Cheesman M.R. Watmough N.J. Gilles-Gonzalez M.-A.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4819-4826Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), but the 1924 cm-1 band was not reported before. This is presumably due to overlap of the isotope-shifted (13C16O) component of the 1970 cm-1 band and the 1924 cm-1 component of 12C16O in the isotope-difference spectrum (18Gonzalez G. Dioum E.M.

Ikeda-Saito M. Gilles-Gonzalez M.-A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4819-4826Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The use of 13C18O isotope allowed us to clarify the presence of the strongly hydrogen-bonded conformer (1924 cm-1). The low (A) and high frequency regions (B) of RR spectra of the CO complexes for several mutants are shown in Fig. 3 and summarized in Table 1. The mutation of Glu-93 showed no significant effect on the stretching vibration modes. On the other hand, the major C-O mode is downshifted by 3 cm-1 in M95A spectrum (c) compared with WT spectrum (a). This implies that the M95A perturbs the electrostatic field near the iron-bound CO ligand. The Fe-CO and CO stretching frequencies of F113L (d) are largely perturbed (Table 1), implying that Phe-113 is also affected by CO and thus functioning in recognizing the axial ligand CO. Furthermore, the mutation of Arg-97 (e) leads to the disappearance of the strongly hydrogen-bonded conformer. We note that the broad Raman band near 1924 cm-1 in the spectrum of R97I (e) is assigned to a heme non-fundamental mode but not to CO stretching. This is because it exhibited no significant change upon isotopic labeling as seen in supplemental Fig. S2.TABLE 1Comparison of the frequencies of the stretching modes for CO- and NO-bound forms of WT and mutantsProteinsvFe-COvC-OvFe-NOvN-Ocm−1WT4881924/19705571580/1635E93I4881924/19695571580/1635M95A4881924/19675571580/1635F113L4961924/19655511580/1632R97I48619725511635 Open table in a new tab Thus, the RR results indicate that the strongly hydrogen bonding conformer at ∼1924 cm-1 is observed for WT, E93I, M95A, and F113L proteins and is absent only for the R97I mutant. This means that Arg-97 forms a hydrogen bond with the bound CO in the hydrogen bonding conformer. We also examined NO-isotope dependence in RR spectra of NO-bound form of WT and several mutants (Table 1 and see also supplemental Fig. S3). The 557 cm-1 band is assigned to the Fe-NO stretching, and the 1580 and 1635 cm-1 bands to N-O stretching. The 1635 cm-1 component of the NO-bound form means that NO is placed in a hydrophobic environment without a hydrogen bond, but the other N-O stretching frequency (1580 cm-1) is characteristic of NO having a negative charge and being stabilized by strong hydrogen bonding (22Park E.-S. Thomas M.R. Boxer S.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 12297-12303Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 23Tomita T. Hirota S. Ogura T. Olson J.S. Kitagawa T. J. Phys. Chem.

Because the strongly hydrogen bonding conformer is observed for WT, E93I, M95A, and F113L and is absent only for R97I, it is reasonable to suggest that Arg-97 forms a hydrogen bond with the heme-bound NO in the hydrogen bonding conformer. Time-resolved Resonance Raman Investigations of WT Ec DOSH—TR3 spectroscopy has been successfully used to characterize photodissociated heme-CO complexes in various heme proteins (19Sato A.

It provides information about dynamic structures in the heme and its pocket. In the present study, TR3 is used to follow dissociation of CO from Ec DOSH heme. The TR3 spectra for WT Ec DOSH obtained from the pump/probe experiments are displayed for the high (panel A) and low (panel B) frequency regions in Fig. 4, and they are compared with those of the equilibrium CO (a) and reduced (l) forms. In the spectrum of the equilibrium-reduced form (l), the oxidation state marker (ν4) appears at 1361 cm-1, characteristic frequency of the heme in the reduced state (18Gonzalez G. Dioum E.M.

The ν2 band is observed at 1581 cm-1 and the coresensitive band (ν3) at 1494 cm-1, characteristic of 6c-ls heme (Table 2). This indicates that heme adopts the 6c-ls state in the reduced form, where Met-95 is the heme axial ligand in the distal side (Fig. 1A).TABLE 2Raman frequencies of porphyrin skeletal modes, peripheral group modes, heme iron coordination, and delay times after photodissociation of CO for WT Ec DOSHWTDelay timev4v3v2δ(CβCcCd)δ(CβCaCb)Coordinationμscm−1Reduced1361149415813804136c-ls (Met-95)CO137014991581377/384409/4276c-ls (CO)Transient0.021353147015593634085c-hs1.01353147015593754085c-hs1001361149415813804136c-ls (Met-95) Open table in a new tab Upon binding of CO to the reduced heme, Met-95 is displaced by CO and ν4, ν3, and ν2 bands are shifted to 1370, 1499, and 1581 cm-1, respectively (Fig. 4A, trace a) (19Sato A. Sasakura Y. Sugiyama S. Sagami I. Shimizu T. Mizutani Y. Kitagawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32650-32658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The spectrum for Δtd =-0.5 μs (Fig. 4, trace b) is similar to that observed without the pump beam (Fig. 4, trace a). This indicates that the recombination of CO to photodissociated species is completed in one turn of the spinning cell. In addition, the fact that the νFe-CO band at 488 cm-1 almost disappeared at Δtd = 20 ns and thenceforth (Fig. 4B, traces c-k) demonstrates that photodissociation is achieved by the pump beam. In the transient species at 20 ns (Fig. 4A, trace c), ν4, ν3, and ν2 bands appeared at 1353, 1470, and 1559 cm-1, respectively (Table 2). These bands are similar to those observed for the equilibrium-reduced form of Mb in which heme adopts the 5c-hs structure (27Mizutani Y. Kitagawa T. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2001; 105: 10992-10999Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the heme of Ec DOSH adopts the 5c-hs structure immediately after CO photolysis. The formation of 5c-hs heme after CO photolysis is consistent with previous studies (19Sato A. Sasakura Y. Sugiyama S. Sagami I. Shimizu T. Mizutani Y. Kitagawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32650-32658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 29Liebl U. Bouzhir-Sima L. Ne′grerie M. Martin J.-L. Vos M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6527-6535Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, at 50 μs (spectrum h) after CO photolysis, new ν4, ν3, and ν2 bands appeared at 1361, 1494, and 1581 cm-1, respectively, indicating the generation of 6c-ls heme. The component of 5c-hs heme almost disappeared at 100 μs (spectrum i), and then 6c-ls heme is dominant. In addition, spectra i-k are similar to that of the equilibrium-reduced form (l). Therefore, the conversion of the 5c-hs to the 6c-ls heme after CO photolysis is attributed to binding of Met-95 to the heme. The binding of Met-95 to the heme at ∼100 μs is consistent with the flash photolysis results in which Met-95 binding occurs in competition with bimolecular CO binding, and subsequent replacement of Met-95 by CO in the millisecond time scale (30Liebl U. Bouzhir-Sima L. Kiger L. Marden M.C. Lambry J.-C. Negrerie M. Vos M.H. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6527-6535Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the spectrum of the equilibrium-reduced form of WT (Fig. 4B, l) displays Raman bands at 343, 380, and 413 cm-1, which can be assigned to ν8, propionate bending δ(CβCcCd), and vinyl bending modes δ(CβCaCb), respectively. These band positions are the same as those previously reported (19Sato A. Sasakura Y. Sugiyama S. Sagami I. Shimizu T. Mizutani Y. Kitagawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32650-32658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and are shifted to 343, 377/384, and 409/427 cm-1 upon CO-binding (a) (Table 2). It is evident from Table 2 that the propionate bending mode, δ(CβCcCd), is shifted to ∼363, ∼375, and ∼380 cm-1 at 0.02 (c), 1.0 (e), and 100 μs (i), respectively, after photolysis (see also supplemental Fig. S4). The frequency shifts suggest that the interactions of the propionate side chains with surrounding residues at these delay times are different. On the other hand, the vinyl bending mode is shifted to 408 and 413 (broad) cm-1 within 0.02 (c) and 100 μs (i) delay, respectively. This result implies that significant alteration in the interactions of the vinyl groups with the surrounding residues occurs in 0.02-100 μs after CO photolysis. Thus, the environment around the heme peripheral groups was changed following CO dissociation. The TR3 results of M95A mutant (Table 3 and supplemental Fig. S5) demonstrate that the photodissociated transient spectra returned to that of the starting CO-bound form directly without passing through the reduced form. Thus, it confirmed that binding of Met-95 to heme is the origin of the large spectral changes observed for WT at 100 μs after CO photolysis. Specifically, in the absence of Met-95, CO begins to rebind to the heme near 100 μs as indicated by the increase in intensity of the Fe-CO stretching mode at 488 cm-1. In addition, in 1 ms after photolysis, the spectrum is similar to that observed for the equilibrium CO-bound form.TABLE 3Raman frequencies of porphyrin skeletal mod"

Many reports from African ART programmes make little mention of patients who are transferred out to another facility, yet Malawi's national figures show a transfer out of 9%. There is no published information about what happens to patients who transfer-out, but this is important because if they transfer-in and stay alive in these other facilities then national retention figures will be better than previously reported.Of all patients started on ART over a three year period in Mzuzu Central Hospital, North Region, Malawi, those who transferred out were identified from the ART register and master cards. Clinic staff attempted to trace these patients to determine whether they had transferred in to a new ART facility and their outcome status. There were 805 patients (19% of the total cohort) who transferred out, of whom 737 (92%) were traced as having transferred in to a new ART facility, with a median time of 1.3 months between transferring-out and transferring-in. Survival probability was superior and deaths were lower in the transfer-out patients compared with those who did not transfer.In Mzuzu Central Hospital, patients who transfer-out constitute a large proportion of patients not retained on ART at their original clinic of registration. Good documentation of transfer-outs and transfer-ins are needed to keep track of national outcomes. Furthermore, the current practice of regarding transfer-outs as being double counted in national cohorts and subtracting this number from the total national registrations to get the number of new patients started on ART is correct."

Efficient and safe methods of DNA delivery need to be found for medical application. Here we report a new monopolar system of non-viral electro-gene transfer into the thymus in vivo that consists of the local application of electrical pulses after the introduction of the DNA. We assessed the proof of concept of this approach by correcting ZAP-70 deficient severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) in mice. The thymic electro-gene transfer of the pCMV-ZAP-70-IRES-EGFP vector in these mice resulted in rapid T cell differentiation in the thymus with mature lymphocytes detected by three weeks in secondary lymphoid organs. Moreover, this system resulted in the generation of long-term functional T lymphocytes. Peripheral reconstituted T cells displayed a diversified T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire, and were responsive to alloantigens in vivo. This process applied to the thymus could represent a simplified and effective alternative for gene therapy of T cell immunodeficiencies."

https://openalex.org/W2017222444,"The Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I houses catalytic centers for both polymerase and 3'-5' exonuclease activities that are separated by about 35 A. Upon the incorporation of a mismatched nucleotide, the primer terminus is transferred from the polymerase site to an exonuclease site designed for excision of the mismatched nucleotides. The structural comparison of the binary complexes of DNA polymerases in the polymerase and the exonuclease modes, together with a molecular modeling of the template strand overhang in Klenow fragment, indicated its binding in the region spanning residues 821-824. Since these residues are conserved in the ""A"" family DNA polymerases, we have designated this region as the RRRY motif. The alanine substitution of individual amino acid residues of this motif did not change the polymerase activity; however, the 3'-5' exonuclease activity was reduced 2-29-fold, depending upon the site of mutation. The R821A and R822A/Y824A mutant enzymes showed maximum cleavage defect with single-stranded DNA, mainly due to a large decrease in the ssDNA binding affinity of these enzymes. Mismatch removal by these enzymes was only moderately affected. However, data from the exonuclease-polymerase balance assays with mismatched template-primer suggest that the mutant enzymes are defective in switching mismatched primer from the polymerase to the exonuclease site. Thus, the RRRY motif provides a binding track for substrate ssDNA and for nonsubstrate single-stranded template overhang, in a polarity-dependent manner. This binding then facilitates cleavage of the substrate at the exonuclease site."
