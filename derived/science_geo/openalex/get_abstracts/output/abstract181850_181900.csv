https://openalex.org/W2141042406,"We studied human population structure using genotypes at 377 autosomal microsatellite loci in 1056 individuals from 52 populations. Within-population differences among individuals account for 93 to 95% of genetic variation; differences among major groups constitute only 3 to 5%. Nevertheless, without using prior information about the origins of individuals, we identified six main genetic clusters, five of which correspond to major geographic regions, and subclusters that often correspond to individual populations. General agreement of genetic and predefined populations suggests that self-reported ancestry can facilitate assessments of epidemiological risks but does not obviate the need to use genetic information in genetic association studies."
https://openalex.org/W2076735150,"Rats repeatedly ran through a sequence of spatial receptive fields of hippocampal CA1 place cells in a fixed temporal order. A novel combinatorial decoding method reveals that these neurons repeatedly fired in precisely this order in long sequences involving four or more cells during slow wave sleep (SWS) immediately following, but not preceding, the experience. The SWS sequences occurred intermittently in brief (∼100 ms) bursts, each compressing the behavioral sequence in time by approximately 20-fold. This rapid encoding of sequential experience is consistent with evidence that the hippocampus is crucial for spatial learning in rodents and the formation of long-term memories of events in time in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2010374889,"Acrp30/adiponectin is an adipocyte-specific secretory protein that has recently been implicated as a mediator of systemic insulin sensitivity with liver and muscle as target organs. Acrp30 is found as two forms in serum, as a lower molecular weight trimer-dimer and a high molecular weight complex. Little is know about the regulation and significance of these Acrp30 complexes in serum and about the events that lead to the generation of the bioactive ligand. Here, we show that there is a profound sexual dimorphism of Acrp30 levels and complex distribution in serum. Female mice display significantly higher levels of the high molecular weight complex in serum than males. In both females and males, levels of the high molecular weight complex are significantly reduced in response to a systemic increase of insulin. The ratio of the two complexes is restored upon normalization of glucose levels. Structurally, we show that oligomer formation of Acrp30 critically depends on disulfide bond formation mediated by Cys-39. Mutation of Cys-39 results in trimers that are subject to proteolytic cleavage in the collagenous domain. Surprisingly, Acrp30(C39S) or wild-type Acrp30 treated with dithiothreitol are significantly more bioactive than the higher order oligomeric forms of the protein with respect to reduction of serum glucose levels. Furthermore, treatment of primary hepatocytes with trimeric and higher order forms of Acrp30 confirms that the increased bioactivity seen in vivo is reflected in an augmented potency to reduce glucose output in the presence of gluconeogenic stimuli. Combined, these results shed new light on the regulation of this complex protein and suggest a new model for in vivo activation of the protein, implicating a serum reductase activity.

Adipose has been under appreciated as an endocrine tissue for decades because of the prevalent opinion that it served merely as storage for lipids. Recently, however, the importance of adipocytes to whole body energy homeostasis and metabolism has been underscored by several reports focusing on secreted products of adipocytes (1Mohamed-Ali V. Pinkney J.H. Coppack S.W. Int. J. Obes. Relat. Metab. Disord. 1998; 22: 1145-1158Google Scholar, 2Berg A.H. Combs T. Du X. Brownlee M. Scherer P.E. Nat.

Banerjee R.R. Wright C.M. Patel H.R. Ahima R.S. Lazar M.A. Nature. 2001; 409: 307-312Google Scholar). There has been increased interest in adipose tissue as an endocrine organ, and several of these secreted proteins, termed adipokines, are currently undergoing extensive study regarding roles as divergent as feeding behavior to cardiovascular protection. For instance, leptin, the gene disrupted in ob/ob mice, has central roles in the hypothalamus, as well as peripheral effects in liver, muscle, and endothelial cells (5Havel P.J. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2002; 13: 51-59Google Scholar). Other adipose-secreted products, such as tumor necrosis factor α and adipsin (complement factor D), have well established functions in innate immunity (6Spiegelman B.M. Hotamisligil G.S. Cell. 1993; 73: 625-627Google Scholar, 7Hotamisligil G.S. J. Intern. Med. 1999; 245: 621-625Google Scholar, 8Cook K.S. Min H.Y. Johnson D. Chaplinsky R.J. Flier J.S. Hunt C.R. Spiegelman B.M.

The recently identified adipokine resistin has been implicated as a modulator of insulin sensitivity and is also being studied for its effects on metabolism (4Steppan C.M. Bailey S.T. Bhat S. Brown E.J. Banerjee R.R. Wright C.M. Patel H.R. Ahima R.S. Lazar M.A. Nature. 2001; 409: 307-312Google Scholar, 10Shuldiner A.R. Yang R. Gong D.W. N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 345: 1345-1346Google Scholar). Acrp30 (also known as adiponectin, AdipoQ, and GBP28) is an adipokine exclusively synthesized and secreted by adipocytes (11Scherer P.E. Williams S. Fogliano M. Baldini G. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26746-26749Google Scholar, 12Hu E. Liang P. Spiegelman B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10697-10703Google Scholar, 13Maeda K. Okubo K.

(Tokyo). 1996; 120: 803-812Google Scholar). Acrp30 has recently been shown to influence glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity. The mRNA expression of Acrp30 is reduced in obese and diabetic mice (12Hu E. Liang P. Spiegelman B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10697-10703Google Scholar), and plasma levels are lower in obese compared with lean humans (15Arita Y. Kihara S. Ouchi N. Takahashi M. Maeda K. Miyagawa J. Hotta K. Shimomura I. Nakamura T. Miyaoka K. Kuriyama H. Nishida M. Yamashita S. Okubo K. Matsubara K. Muraguchi M. Ohmoto Y. Funahashi T. Matsuzawa Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 79-83Google Scholar). In addition, longitudinal studies in rhesus monkeys demonstrate that, similar to work in humans, Acrp30 levels were negatively correlated with body weight, fat content, and resting insulin levels and decline with progression toward the diabetic state (16Hotta K. Funahashi T. Bodkin N.L. Ortmeyer H.K. Arita Y. Hansen B.C. Matsuzawa Y. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 1126-1133Google Scholar). Furthermore, the genomic locus encompassing the human Acrp30 gene, 3q27, has recently been identified as a novel susceptibility locus for early-onset diabetes, as well as metabolic syndrome X (17Comuzzie A.G. Funahashi T. Sonnenberg G. Martin L.J. Jacob H.J. Black A.E. Maas D. Takahashi M. Kihara S. Tanaka S. Matsuzawa Y. Blangero J. Cohen D. Kissebah A. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 86: 4321-4325Google Scholar). More recent work has described the bioactivity of Acrp30 or Acrp30 fragments on glucose and lipid homeostasis. Fruebis et al.(18Fruebis J. Tsao T.S. Javorschi S. Ebbets-Reed D. Erickson M.R. Yen F.T. Bihain B.E. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2005-2010Google Scholar) initially demonstrated that injection of a proteolytic cleavage product of Acrp30 (gAcrp30) ablated the rise in plasma-free fatty acids and triglycerides accompanying a high fat/sucrose gavage (18Fruebis J. Tsao T.S. Javorschi S. Ebbets-Reed D. Erickson M.R. Yen F.T. Bihain B.E. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2005-2010Google Scholar). They further found that chronic administration of gAcrp30 prevented diet-induced obesity without affecting feeding behavior. Work by Kadowaki and co-workers (3Yamauchi T. Kamon J. Waki H. Terauchi Y. Kubota N. Hara K. Mori Y. Ide T. Murakami K. Tsuboyama-Kasaoka N. Ezaki O. Akanuma Y. Gavrilova O. Vinson C. Reitman M.L. Kagechika H. Shudo K. Yoda M. Nakano Y. Tobe K. Nagai R. Kimura S. Tomita M. Froguel P. Kadowaki T. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 941-946Google Scholar) also supported the hypothesis that Acrp30 is an important regulator of insulin sensitivity, by showing gAcrp30 and leptin synergism in improving insulin resistance in lipoatrophic mice. Both groups suggested that gAcrp30 increases fatty acid oxidation. Finally, work in our laboratory has focused on administration of full-length, recombinant Acrp30 purified to homogeneity from mammalian cells. Injection of this preparation leads to a transient decrease in circulating glucose levels in wild-type mice, as well as models of type I and II diabetes (2Berg A.H. Combs T. Du X. Brownlee M. Scherer P.E. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 947-953Google Scholar). Follow-up studies using pancreatic clamps in vivo and cell culture studies on primary hepatocytes indicate that the transient decrease in serum glucose levels is because of improved hepatic insulin sensitivity, resulting in decreased hepatic gluconeogenesis (2Berg A.H. Combs T. Du X. Brownlee M. Scherer P.E. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 947-953Google Scholar,19Combs T.P. Wagner J.A. Berger J. Doebber T. Wang W.J. Zhang B.B. Tanen M. Berg A.H. O'Rahilly S. Savage D.B. Chatterjee K. Weiss S. Larson P.J. Gottesdiener K.M. Gertz B.J. Charron M.J. Scherer P.E. Moller D.E. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 998-1007Google Scholar). Acrp30 consists of an N-terminal collagenous domain and a C-terminal globular domain that shares homology to the globular domains of collagens VIII and X, as well as complement factor C1q and a family of hibernation-specific serum proteins. Other members of this family of proteins, known as collectins, that share structural (but no sequence) homology include surfactant proteins (SP) 1The abbreviations used are: SP, surfactant protein; LMW, low molecular weight; HMW, high molecular weight; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FCS, fetal calf serum; DTT, dithiothreitol; HEK, human embryonic kidney A and D (SP-A, SP-D), mannose-binding protein, bovine conglutinin, and cerebellin. Experimental evidence indicates that each of these collectin family members contains a C-terminal domain that forms either homotrimers, as is the case for Acrp30, or heterotrimers between different isoforms of the protein, such as C1q (20Hansen S. Holmskov U. Immunobiology. 1998; 199: 165-189Google Scholar). For instance, studies have confirmed that SP-D, a pulmonary protein secreted into the distal airways and alveoli of the lung and recently shown to bind various pathogens and potentiate leukocyte function, trimerizes, with a homotrimer as the basic building block for larger oligomeric secreted complexes (21Brown-Augsburger P. Chang D. Rust K. Crouch E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18912-18919Google Scholar). Further work demonstrated the necessity for higher order complex formation of these oligomeric forms and in fact determined that the activity of SP-D in vitro and in vivo critically depends on the proper assembly of a higher molecular weight complex (22Zhang L. Ikegami M. Crouch E.C. Korfhagen T.R. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19214-19219Google Scholar). Similarly, we demonstrate here that Acrp30 exists in two discrete complexes in serum, as a hexamer (LMW form) and a higher order complex of between 12–18 subunits (HMW form), and these complexes are stable both in vitro and in vivo. There is a characteristic sexual dimorphism in circulating Acrp30 levels, with higher levels found in females. Additionally, we demonstrate that there is a sexual dimorphism in terms of complexes of the protein, as males have the majority of their Acrp30 circulating as hexamers, whereas female mice have a more balanced distribution of the two forms. Furthermore, we show that levels of the two complexes respond differentially to insulin and glucose treatment, with selective loss of the HMW form. Finally, a homologous mutation to the C15S/C20S change in SP-D that ablates higher order assembly and function of SP-D complexes (23Brown-Augsburger P. Hartshorn K. Chang D. Rust K. Fliszar C. Welgus H.G. Crouch E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13724-13730Google Scholar) was introduced into Acrp30. Biochemically, the C39S mutation in Acrp30 prevents higher order complex formation beyond the basic homotrimer. These homotrimers can also be visualized electronmicroscopically by rotary shadowing. Surprisingly, and in contrast to SP-D, this destabilized homotrimer has greater bioactivityin vivo and in vitro than the native oligomeric complexes of Acrp30. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) was prepared by the Albert Einstein Cancer Center Media Core Facility. FCS was purchased from Invitrogen. EXPRE35S35S protein labeling reagent was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. DMEM lacking methionine, cysteine, and glutamate was purchased from ICN (Costa Mesa, CA). Dithiothreitol (DTT), glucose Trinder assays, and trypsin was purchased from Sigma. All other chemicals were purchased from Fisher. Antibodies to the N-terminal domain of Acrp30 were described previously (2Berg A.H. Combs T. Du X. Brownlee M. Scherer P.E. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 947-953Google Scholar). Another antibody was raised by injecting full-length recombinant Acrp30 produced in and purified from 293-T cells into rabbits (Covance Research, Denver, PA). FVB or C57Bl/6J mice were bred in house and used as indicated. All mice were 2 to 5 months of age and fed ad libitum using regular mouse chow. All protocols were approved by the Albert Einstein Animal Committee. 5–20% sucrose gradients in 10 mm HEPES, pH 8, 125 mm NaCl were poured stepwise (5, 10, 15, 20%) in 2-ml thin-walled ultracentrifuge tubes (BD Biosciences) and allowed to equilibrate overnight at 4 °C. Following layering of the sample on top (diluted 1:10 with 10 mm HEPES, pH 8, 125 mm NaCl in the case of serum), the gradients were spun at 55,000 rpm for 4 h at 4 °C in a TLS55 rotor in a Sorvall TL-100 table-top ultracentrifuge. 150-μl gradient fractions were sequentially retrieved from the top of the gradient and analyzed either by quantitative Western blot analysis or by scintillation counting in the case of iodinated protein. Alternatively, pooled serum or recombinant protein was loaded on two Superose 6 gel filtration columns arranged in tandem, and 0.5-ml fractions were collected (0.2 ml/min flow rate for 4 h in phosphate-buffered saline) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Complementary primers (5′CACCCAAGGGAACTTCT GCAGGTTGGATGG) and (5′GCCATCCAACCTGC AGAAGTTCCCTTGGGTG) were synthesized (with the underlined sequence encoding the new serine residue). Primers were electrophoresed on a 12% acrylamide gel containing 8 m urea, 25 mm Tris, pH 6.8, at 20 watts for 2 h, followed by visualization by UV shadowing at 254 nm. Excised gel slices were fragmented and then resuspended in 150 μl of phenol, pH 6.6, and 150 μl of 0.3m sodium acetate and incubated at 37 °C. The aqueous layer was further phenol-chloroform extracted, followed by two chloroform extractions and ethanol precipitation. Pfupolymerase (Stratagene) was used for PCR with pAB23 (bicistronic expression vector containing the Acrp30 cDNA and green fluorescent protein (2Berg A.H. Combs T. Du X. Brownlee M. Scherer P.E. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 947-953Google Scholar)) as a template. Reactions were digested by 5 units ofDpnI (New England Biolabs) to remove any remaining double-stranded methylated template plasmid for 3 h at 37 °C and then electroporated into DH10β bacteria. Transformants were screened for acquisition of PstI sensitivity (newPstI site generated by mutation italicized). Acrp30 constructs (described below) were used for transient transfection assays in HEK 293-T cells. Plasmids were transiently transfected into HEK 293-T cells (10-cm dishes) by the Effectene method (Qiagen). 48 h after transfection, cells were labeled for 4 h in 3 ml of DMEM lacking methionine and cysteine and supplemented with 0.5 mCi (1000 Ci/mmol) of express protein labeling reagent. Cells were thereafter washed three times with chase medium (DMEM containing unlabeled methionine and cysteine at 1 mm and cycloheximide at 300 μm). At the end of the chase period, supernatants were harvested, and cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and then scraped into TNET-OG buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 60 mm octyl-glucoside, and protease inhibitors). Wild-type and mutant Acrp30 proteins were purified as described previously (2Berg A.H. Combs T. Du X. Brownlee M. Scherer P.E. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 947-953Google Scholar). Briefly, a bicistronic expression vector for Acrp30 and green fluorescent protein was constructed and stably transfected into 293-T cells. High expressers were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and further propagated in DMEM containing 10% FCS, penicillin/streptomycin and 0.1 g/liter ascorbic acid. The selection process for high expressers was repeated a total of three times, allowing sufficient recovery and growth time after each successive cell sort. When cells reached confluence, the serum-containing medium was removed, and cells were allowed to secrete for 48 h into serum-free DMEM with 0.1 g/liter ascorbic acid. Medium was collected and centrifuged for 30 min at 3000 rpm to pellet cellular debris. Ammonium sulfate was added to 40% (w/v), and protein was precipitated overnight at 4 °C and then centrifuged for 3 h at 4000 rpm. Precipitated protein was resuspended in 10 mmHEPES, pH 8, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2(low salt buffer) and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C in the same buffer. Dialyzed protein was filtered through a 0.45-μm filter before loading onto a 5-ml EconoPac High Q anion exchange cartridge (Bio-Rad). The column was washed extensively with low salt buffer before elution with a 50 to 500 mm NaCl salt gradient. Acrp30-containing fractions were determined by Coomassie staining, and positive fractions were concentrated and analyzed for purity. The resulting protein was >99% pure as judged by staining of Coomassie-stained gels. A purified preparation of full-length Acrp30 lacking the globular head domain was produced and purified from HEK 293-T cells and kindly provided by Dr. Maximilien Murone (Apotech). 50 μg of Acrp30 in 10 mm HEPES, pH 8, 125 mm NaCl was incubated with 1 mCi of Na125I and 10 μl of chloramine T (1 mg/ml) for 30 min at room temperature. The reaction was quenched with 5 mm cold NaI before loading onto a PD-10 desalting column (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with 20 mm BisTris, pH 6.5, 200 mm NaCl, and 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin to remove unincorporated label. The column was washed with the same buffer without the bovine serum albumin, and fractions were collected and assayed for radioactivity and stability of protein by electrophoresis followed by Western blot and phosphorimaging analysis. Recombinant wild-type Acrp30 was incubated in the presence of various concentrations of DTT (Sigma) from 1 to 100 mmfinal concentration, 100 mm glycine, pH 3, or 100 mm sodium carbonate, pH 11.5, for 1 h at 37 °C. Following incubation, protein was applied to a 5–20% sucrose gradient as described. Alternatively, recombinant wild-type Acrp30 (1 μg) was incubated in DMEM ± 100 mm DTT for 1 h at 37 °C and then incubated in the presence of 1% serum alone, 293-T cells alone, or 1% serum + 293-T cells for 1 h at 37 °C. Medium was collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by blotting using anti-full-length Acrp30 polyclonal antiserum. Cleavage products detected were identical to those present in 293-T cells expressing the C39S mutant Acrp30, as verified by Edman degradation. Briefly, protein was electrophoresed and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). Membranes were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250 and destained with 50% methanol, and the cleavage product band was excised. N-terminal sequences were determined by Edman chemistry using an Applied Biosystems Procise Sequencer by the Albert Einstein Laboratory of Macromolecular Analysis. Blood glucose levels were measured by Trinder assay (Sigma). Acrp30 was quantitated by Western blot analysis; following SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell). Rabbit polyclonal anti-Acrp30 antibody derivatized with 125I was used to decorate the blots, and total Acrp30 signal was determined with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) and analyzed with ImageQuant 1.2 software against recombinant Acrp30 standards of known concentration. Intraperitoneal insulin injections and glucose gavages were performed on C57Bl/6J males. Serum was collected through tail bleeds. Purified, recombinant proteins (wild-type Acrp30 and C39S Acrp30) or iodinated Acrp30 complexes were injected intravenously into the tail vein of mice of the FVB background. The full-length untagged cDNA encoding murine Acrp30 with the C39S mutation was put under the control of the aP2 enhancer/promoter sequence, and the rabbit β-globin 3′ untranslated region poly(A) sequence was added to the 3′ end. The isolated construct was purified for pronuclear injection into mouse embryos from FVB mice (Taconic Farms). Mouse embryos (fertilized one-cell zygotes) were injected and implanted in female CD-1 mice (Charles River Breeding Laboratories) at the Transgenic Mouse Facility at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Acrp30 transgenic mice were identified by slot blot analysis using genomic DNA prepared from mouse tails and also analyzed by Northern blot analysis. Acrp30(C39S mutant)-positive founder transgenic mice were continuously crossed to FVB mice to maintain a pure FVB background. The transgene was transmitted exclusively through male mice. Separation of proteins by SDS-PAGE, fluorography, and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (24Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. Baldini G. Sargiacomo M. Corley-Mastick C. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1233-1243Google Scholar). Primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 and 1% bovine serum albumin. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were detected with enhanced chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). Measurements were performed as described (2Berg A.H. Combs T. Du X. Brownlee M. Scherer P.E. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 947-953Google Scholar). In brief, single-cell hepatocyte suspensions were isolated as described previously and allowed to adhere to 24-well plates pre-coated with rat-tail collagen I. Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FCS, penicillin/streptomycin, 10 μg/ml insulin, and 10 μm dexamethasone. Medium was changed to RPMI with 5 mm glucose, 0.4% FCS, and cells were allowed to equilibrate overnight in this low glucose medium. The following morning, medium was refreshed, insulin (35 pm) and/or Acrp30 (wild-type or Cys mutant) was added, and treatment lasted another 24 h. After stimulation, glucose production was measured by incubating cells for 6 h in glucose-free RPMI containing 5 mm each of alanine, valine, glycine, pyruvate, and lactate, removing the supernatant, and assaying by Trinder assay (Sigma). Each point represents that average of three independent measurements. Samples of the various purified Acrp30 preparations were diluted in 0.2 m ammonium bicarbonate to a final concentration of 10–20 μg/ml, mixed 1:1 (v/v) with 80% (v/v) glycerol. Shortly after addition of the glycerol, the mixture was sprayed onto freshly cleaved mica. The mica chips were dried at <10−5 torr for at least 2 h. Rotary shadowing with platinum/carbon at an angle of 9°, carbon shadowing at 90°, replica formation, and electron microscopy followed earlier protocols (25Engel J. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 245: 469-488Google Scholar). Sexually dimorphic levels have been reported for many metabolic factors, including adipocyte-specific hormones such as leptin (26Clayton P.E. Gill M.S. Hall C.M. Tillmann V. Whatmore A.J. Price D.A. Clin. Endocrinol. (Oxford). 1997; 46: 727-733Google Scholar). We therefore examined levels of Acrp30 in males versusfemale mice. We noted that there is indeed a sexual dimorphism in serum Acrp30 levels, with a significant, ∼2.5-fold increase in total circulating levels in female mice compared with male littermates (∼25 μg/ml versus ∼10 μg/ml). A similar dimorphism has been reported in humans, where the dimorphism is smaller (about a 50–100% increase in females) (27Yang W.S. Lee W.J. Funahashi T. Tanaka S. Matsuzawa Y. Chao C.L. Chen C.L. Tai T.Y. Chuang L.M. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 86: 3815-3819Google Scholar). To further study the relevance of these sexually dimorphic levels, we analyzed the size distribution of oligomeric complexes of Acrp30 in mice by means of gel filtration chromatography and velocity sedimentation. Consistent with previous reports (11Scherer P.E. Williams S. Fogliano M. Baldini G. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26746-26749Google Scholar), Acrp30 exists in two major oligomeric forms in mouse serum, as a hexamer of ∼180 kDa and a higher order structure with the apparent molecular mass of 400 kDa, as determined by size standards run concurrently. Interestingly, the sexual dimorphism is not only limited to absolute amounts of Acrp30 but is also reflected in the distribution of oligomeric complexes in serum. The majority of Acrp30 in male mice is present in the smaller, hexameric form, whereas female mice have a more even distribution of Acrp30 complexes, with similar serum levels of both low and high molecular weight complexes (Fig.1, A and B). This suggests that male and female mice have comparable levels of the low molecular weight form (9–12 μg/ml) but differ significantly with respect to the levels of the high molecular form (Fig.1 C). To determine whether these oligomeric complexes are stable or interconvert spontaneously, recombinant, HEK 293-T-produced mouse Acrp30 protein was further separated by gel filtration chromatography into separate fractions corresponding to the hexamer and high molecular weight forms. Following purification, the complexes were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, either as purified proteins or in the presence of rat serum, which contains immunologically distinct Acrp30 complexes. Both the low and the high molecular weight form are remarkably stable (Fig. 2 A). No significant interchange can be observed for the high molecular weight form in the presence of rat serum; similarly, the low molecular weight form does not assemble into a high molecular weight species, suggesting that the two complexes do not spontaneously interchange in the presence of serum. Because we were adding microgram amounts of recombinant Acrp30 to microliter amounts of serum, the inability of serum to catalyze an interchange may reflect saturation of an enzymatic activity, as recombinant Acrp30 is in large excess over endogenous Acrp30. To address this issue, we iodinated Acrp30 and incubated nanogram amounts of the iodinated complexes with mouse serum in vitro. This reflects subphysiologic amounts of exogenous Acrp30 compared with endogenous levels. Interchange between the different molecular weight forms is assayed by monitoring the distribution of counts across a velocity centrifugation. Even under these conditions, we found no evidence for either a spontaneous or catalyzed interchange between the subunits (Fig. 2 B). This suggests that such an interchange may not take place in vivo or that the conditions chosenin vitro are not effectively mimicking in vivoconditions. Preparative amounts of iodinated complexes were isolated by velocity sedimentation centrifugation, followed by dialysis of excess sucrose. The purified fractions were injected intravenously into mice. The high specific activity of the iodinated protein permitted the injection of small amounts of protein (<1 μg) compared with the total circulating pool of Acrp30 in female mice (∼90 μg), avoiding any significant changes to endogenous levels of the protein. Serum samples were assayed for up to 8 h post-injection, and the complex distribution was determined by velocity sedimentation followed by scintillation counting to determine the size of the labeled oligomeric complexes (Fig.2 C). Even though the complexes were cleared and appeared at reduced levels, we were unable to detect a significant redistributionin vivo of either the iodinated hexamer or high order structure complexes at any stage following injection. This suggests that there is no direct precursor/mature form relationship between the two populations of Acrp30 in serum under basal conditions. Although no interchange was observed under basal conditions, we also tested whether a more significant degree of interchange can be observed during a metabolic challenge. We therefore decided to examine the stability of the complexes in response to an insulin injection, conditions that lead to a selective reduction of the high order complex (see below). Mice were intravenously injected with purified, iodinated Acrp30 complexes in the presence or absence of 1 unit ins"

SVZ cells exposed to EGF in culture grow to form neurospheres that are multipotent and self-renewing. We show here that the majority of these EGF-responsive cells are not derived from relatively quiescent stem cells in vivo, but from the highly mitotic, Dlx2(+), transit-amplifying C cells. When exposed to EGF, C cells downregulate Dlx2, arrest neuronal production, and become highly proliferative and invasive. Killing Dlx2(+) cells dramatically reduces the in vivo response to EGF and neurosphere formation in vitro. Furthermore, purified C cells are 53-fold enriched for neurosphere generation. We conclude that transit-amplifying cells retain stem cell competence under the influence of growth factors."

Here, we demonstrate and characterize a robust sustained negative BOLD response (NBR) in the human occipital cortex, triggered by stimulating part of the visual field. The NBR was spatially adjacent to but segregated from the PBR. It depended on the stimulus and thus on the pattern of neuronal activity. The time courses of the NBR and PBR were similar, and their amplitudes covaried both with increasing stimulus duration and increasing stimulus contrast. The NBR was associated with reductions in blood flow and with decreases in oxygen consumption. Our findings support the contribution to the NBR of (1) a significant component of reduction in neuronal activity and (2) possibly a component of hemodynamic changes independent of the local changes in neuronal activity."
https://openalex.org/W2135621635,"A protein required to localize mitochondria to Drosophila nerve terminals has been identified genetically. Photoreceptors mutant for milton show aberrant synaptic transmission despite normal phototransduction. Without Milton, synaptic terminals and axons lack mitochondria, although mitochondria are numerous in neuronal cell bodies. In contrast, synaptic vesicles continue to be transported to and concentrated at synapses. Milton protein is associated with mitochondria and is present primarily in axons and synapses. A likely explanation of the apparent trafficking defect is offered by the coimmunoprecipitation of Milton and kinesin heavy chain. Transfected into HEK293T cells, Milton induces a redistribution of mitochondria within the cell. We propose that Milton is a mitochondria-associated protein required for kinesin-mediated transport of mitochondria to nerve terminals."
https://openalex.org/W1972939055,"One hypothesis for the etiology of Parkinson's disease (PD) is that subsets of neurons are vulnerable to a failure in proteasome-mediated protein turnover. Here we show that overexpression of mutant α-synuclein increases sensitivity to proteasome inhibitors by decreasing proteasome function. Overexpression of parkin decreases sensitivity to proteasome inhibitors in a manner dependent on parkin's ubiquitin-protein E3 ligase activity, and antisense knockdown of parkin increases sensitivity to proteasome inhibitors. Mutant α-synuclein also causes selective toxicity to catecholaminergic neurons in primary midbrain cultures, an effect that can be mimicked by the application of proteasome inhibitors. Parkin is capable of rescuing the toxic effects of mutant α-synuclein or proteasome inhibition in these cells. Therefore, parkin and α-synuclein are linked by common effects on a pathway associated with selective cell death in catecholaminergic neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2144495216,"Acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) synthetase (Acs) is an enzyme central to metabolism in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Acs synthesizes acetyl CoA from acetate, adenosine triphosphate, and CoA through an acetyl–adenosine monophosphate (AMP) intermediate. Immunoblotting and mass spectrometry analysis showed that Salmonella enterica Acs enzyme activity is posttranslationally regulated by acetylation of lysine-609. Acetylation blocks synthesis of the adenylate intermediate but does not affect the thioester-forming activity of the enzyme. Activation of the acetylated enzyme requires the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide–dependent protein deacetylase activity of the CobB Sir2 protein from S. enterica. We propose that acetylation modulates the activity of all the AMP-forming family of enzymes, including nonribosomal peptide synthetases, luciferase, and aryl- and acyl-CoA synthetases. These findings extend our knowledge of the roles of Sir2 proteins in gene silencing, chromosome stability, and cell aging and imply that lysine acetylation is a common regulatory mechanism in eukaryotes and prokaryotes."

Human tumors, including colorectal adenocarcinoma, secrete angiogenic factors, inducing proliferation and chemotaxis of microvascular endothelial cells, eventually leading to tumor neovascularization. The chemokine interleukin 8 (IL-8; CXCL8) exerts potent angiogenic properties on endothelial cells through interaction with its cognate receptors CXCR1 and CXCR2. As CXCR1 and CXCR2 expression is differentially regulated in tissue-specific endothelial cells and effects of IL-8 on intestinal endothelial cells are not defined, we characterized the potential IL-8-induced angiogenic mechanisms in primary cultures of human intestinal microvascular endothelial cells (HIMEC) and IL-8 receptor expression in human intestinal microvessels. CXCR1 and CXCR2 expression on HIMEC were defined using reverse transcriptase-PCR, immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, and Western blot analysis. IL-8-induced downstream signaling events were assessed using immunoblot analysis and immunofluorescence. The angiogenic effects of IL-8 on HIMEC were determined using proliferation and chemotaxis assays. HIMEC responded to IL-8 with rapid stress fiber assembly, chemotaxis, enhanced proliferation, and phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2 (ERK 1/2). HIMEC express CXCR2, but not CXCR1. Neutralizing antibodies to CXCR2 diminished IL-8-induced chemotaxis and stress fiber assembly. Specific inhibitors of ERK 1/2 and phosphoinositide 3-kinase abrogated endothelial tube formation and IL-8-induced chemotaxis in HIMEC. IL-8 elicits angiogenic responses in microvascular endothelial cells isolated from human intestine by engaging CXCR2. We confirmed tissue expression of CXCR2 in human intestinal microvessels.

It comprises a multistep sequence of basement membrane proteolysis, endothelial cell (EC)1 proliferation and chemotaxis, and organization and maturation of tubular structures. Angiogenesis results from an increase in angiogenic mediators (such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)) or a reduction in angiostatic factors, including interferon (IFN)-γ, as well as the release of proteases, which degrade the extracellular matrix (1Belperio J.A.

Hori Y. Fan T.D. Inflammation. 1993; 17: 135-143Google Scholar). IL-8 was initially identified as a major proinflammatory cytokine. In Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, total mucosal IL-8 mRNA and protein are significantly up-regulated in the colonic mucosa (8Uguccioni M. Gionchetti P. Robbiani D.F. Rizzello F. Peruzzo S.

Wagner H. Hess M. Laissue J.A. Mueller C. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 144: 997-1007Google Scholar). IL-8 acts as a potent chemoattractant for neutrophils, the major cellular component of acute inflammatory infiltrates (8Uguccioni M. Gionchetti P. Robbiani D.F. Rizzello F. Peruzzo S. Campieri M. Baggioloini M. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 155: 331-336Google Scholar). In addition to this proinflammatory function, there is growing evidence that IL-8 exerts effects on nonimmune cells, including the vascular endothelium. Studies from human gastrointestinal carcinomas have suggested a pivotal role for IL-8 in tumor angiogenesis and tumor growth. IL-8 expression correlates with vascularity in gastric carcinomas (13Kitadai Y. Haruma K. Sumii K. Yamamoto S. Ue T. Yokozaki H. Yasui W. Ohmoto Y. Kajiyama G. Fidler I.J. Tahara E. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 152: 93-100Google Scholar), and microvessel counts in histologically normal tissue adjacent to colonic adenocarcinoma indicated distant angiogenic effects mediated by soluble factors (14Fox S.H. Whalen G.F. Sanders M.M. Burleson J.A. Jennings K. Kurtzman S. Kreutzer D. J. Surg. Oncol. 1998; 69: 230-234Google Scholar). Notably, IL-8 is highly expressed in hyperplastic mucosa adjacent to colon cancer, supporting an indirect angiogenic effect of colon cancer cells (15Kuniyasu H. Yasui W. Shinohara H. Ellis L.M. Wilson M.R. Bucana C.D. Rikita T. Tahara E. Fidler I.J. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 157: 1523-1535Google Scholar). Moreover, IL-8 is apparently involved in development of distant metastasis from colorectal cancer (16Haraguchi M. Komuta K. Akashi A. Matsuzaki S. Furui J. Kanematsu T. Oncol. Rep. 2002; 9: 159-165Google Scholar). Interestingly, both colonic epithelial cells (17Eckmann L. Jung H.C. Schurer-Maly C. Panja A. Morzycka-Wroblewska E. Kagnoff M.F. Gastroenterology. 1993; 105: 1689-1697Google Scholar) and microvascular EC of human gut secrete IL-8 in a regulated fashion in vitro(18Utgaard J.O. Jahnsen F.L. Bakka A. Brandtzaeg P. Haraldsen G. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1751-1756Google Scholar), suggestive of a cross-talk between those cells in the human intestinal mucosa (19Lugering N. Kucharzik T. Gockel H. Sorg C. Stoll R. Domschke W. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1998; 114: 377-384Google Scholar). Substantial evidence exists that IL-8 is a critical factor in angiogenesis in a multitude of human tumors. Strategies blocking the angiogenic activity of IL-8 have proven effective to inhibit angiogenesis, metastasis, and tumor progression in human tumors in murine models (20Huang S. Mills L. Mian B.

The chemokine receptor CXCR2 promiscuously binds all known angiogenic ELR+ CXC chemokines, including IL-8, the growth-regulated oncogene family members (GRO-α, -β, and -γ), NAP-2, GCP-2, and ENA-78 with high affinity (29Ahuja S.K.

In contrast, CXCR1 specifically binds only IL-8 and GCP-2 (30Lee J. Horuk R. Rice G.C. Bennett G.L. Camerato T. Wood W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16283-16287Google Scholar, 31Wolf M. Delgado M.B. Jones S.A. Dewald B. Clark-Lewis I. Baggiolini M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 164-170Google Scholar). Both CXCR1 and CXCR2 are members of the seven-transmembrane domain rhodopsin-like G protein-coupled receptor superfamily and share 78% amino acid sequence homology (32Addison C.L. Daniel T.O. Burdick M.D. Liu H. Ehlert J.E. Xue Y.Y. Buechi L. Walz A. Richmond A. Strieter R.M. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 5269-5277Google Scholar). The detection of the IL-8 receptors, CXCR1 and CXCR2 in cultured EC, by means of RNA message and functional protein expression, has demonstrated conflicting results (33Petzelbauer P. Watson C.A. Pfau S.E. Pober J.S. Cytokine. 1995; 7: 267-272Google Scholar), as the degree of monolayer confluence and the extracellular matrix likely regulate CXC receptor expression in EC (34Feil C. Augustin H.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 38-45Google Scholar). In addition, several cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α are potent inducers of CXCR2 on human microvascular EC (35Yoshida S. Ono M. Shono T. Izumi H. Ishibashi T. Suzuki H. Kuwano M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4015-4023Google Scholar). EC subsets from different vascular beds demonstrate heterogeneous responsiveness to cytokines and differentially express adhesion molecules and secretory products (36Mason J.C. Yarwood H. Sugars K. Haskard D.O. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1233-C1240Google Scholar, 37Garlanda C. Dejana E. Atheroscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 1193-1202Google Scholar, 38Petzelbauer P. Bender J.R. Wilson J.

Therefore, we sought to define the expression of IL-8 receptors in human intestinal microvessels and characterize the functional angiogenic response of human intestinal microvascular EC (HIMEC) to IL-8. Monoclonal anti-CXCR1 (Clone 5A12) and anti-CXCR2 (Clone 6C6) antibodies were purchased from BD Pharmingen (San Diego, CA). Mouse IgG (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) served as an isotype control. Recombinant human IL-8 and cytokines were purchased from R&D Systems. Endothelial cell growth supplement was from Upstate Biotech Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). MCDB-131 medium, porcine heparin, bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (Escherichia coli O111:B4), concanavalin A, trypsin inhibitor (type II-S), and PSF (penicillin/streptomycin/fungizone) were from Sigma. Fetal bovine serum (FBS) and RPMI 1640 medium were obtained from BioWhittaker (Walkersville, MD). Bovine serum albumin (BSA, Fraction V) was obtained from Fisher Scientific (Fair Lawn, NJ). Human plasma fibronectin was purchased from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). The specific inhibitors of p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) (PD98059) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (wortmannin and LY294002) were purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA), and MatrigelTM was obtained from BD Discovery Labware (Bedford, MA). Macroscopically normal intestinal specimens for HIMEC isolation were obtained from patients undergoing scheduled bowel resection. The use of human tissues was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Medical College of Wisconsin. HIMEC were isolated as previously described (40Binion D.G. West G.A. Ina K. Ziats N.P. Emancipator S.N. Fiocchi C. Gastroenterology. 1997; 112: 1895-1907Google Scholar). In brief, mucosal strips from resected normal colon were washed, minced, and digested in collagenase type II solution (Worthington, Lakewood, NJ; 2 mg/ml). EC were extruded by mechanical compression and plated onto fibronectin-coated tissue culture dishes in growth medium (MCDB-131 medium supplemented with 20% (v/v) FBS and endothelial cell growth supplement, porcine heparin (130 mg/ml), and 2.5% (v/v) PSF solution). After 7–10 days of culture, microvascular EC clusters were physically isolated, and a pure culture was obtained. HIMEC cultures were recognized by microscopic phenotype, modified lipoprotein uptake (Dil-ac-LDL, Biomedical Technology, Inc., Stoughton, MA), and expression of Factor VIII-associated antigen. All experiments were carried out using HIMEC cultures between passages 8 and 12. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from healthy donors were purified by Ficoll-Hypaque (Amersham Biosciences) density centrifugation. Whole blood samples were aseptically drawn into heparinized vials, mixed (1:1) with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4), and centrifuged over a Ficoll density gradient. Cell viability was ≥95% as assessed by trypan blue exclusion. PBMC were washed, plated, and cultured overnight in RPMI 1640 containing 2 mmglutamine, 25 mm HEPES, 2 μg/ml LPS, 4 μg/ml concanavalin A, and 5% (v/v) FBS. Cells were washed and subjected to RNA isolation. Unlabeled oligonucleotides with the following sequences were purchased from Operon (Alameda, CA): CXCR1 sense 5′-GGGGCCACACCAACCTTC-3′ and antisense 5′-AGTGCCTGCCTCAATGTCTCC-3′ (product size 363 bp; GenBankTM accession number:BC028221); CXCR2 sense 5′-GGGCAACAATACAGCAAACT-3′ and antisense 5′-GCACTTAGGCAGGAGGTCTT-3′ (499 bp; accession number: NM_001557); β-actin sense 5′-CCAGAGCAAGAGAGGCATCC-3′ and antisense 5′-CTGTGGTGGTGAAGCTGTAG-3′ (436 bp; accession number: BC016045). Total RNA was isolated from subconfluent HIMEC cultures by a single step guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol-chloroform extraction using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Genomic DNA was subsequently removed by DNase I (Amplification Grade, Invitrogen). For reverse transcription, cDNA was generated using 1 μg of total RNA according to the manufacturer's protocol (Superscript II reverse transcription kit, Invitrogen) in a total volume of 20 μl. PCR was performed using RoboCycler (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). For each reaction, 1.25 μl of cDNA was amplified using specific primers (25 pmol) in a final volume of 50 μl. For CXCR1, PCR was performed for 35 cycles of 94 °C (45 s), 62 °C (30 s), and 72 °C (60 s) followed by a final 72 °C step (6 min). For CXCR2 and β-actin, the samples were subjected to 35 cycles of 94 (60 s) and 62 °C (150 s), followed by a final 72 °C step (6 min). PCR products were separated on a 1% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. DNase-treated total RNA samples (no reverse transcriptase) were used as a negative control, whereas cDNA of stimulated PBMC served as a positive control. Equal loading of cDNA was confirmed by amplification of β-actin. HIMEC monolayers were washed and detached with ice-cold 20 mm EDTA (pH 7.6), PBS and resuspended in fixation buffer (PBS containing 0.05% (w/v) NaN3, 0.5% (w/v) BSA, and 1% (w/v) paraformaldehyde). After washing in wash buffer (fixation buffer without paraformaldehyde), cells were incubated with primary antibodies (10 μg/ml), washed, incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (BD Biosciences) in the dark and analyzed (FACScan; BD Biosciences). Mouse isotype IgG served as a negative control (R&D Systems). Neutrophils from healthy donors were purified as described previously (41Rafiee P. Lee J.K. Leung C.C. Raffin T.A. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 4785-4792Google Scholar). Cell viability and purity was ≥95% as assessed by trypan blue exclusion and DiffQuik staining (Baxter Scientific, McGraw, IL). Neutrophils and HIMEC from two different isolations were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mmTris-Cl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 75 mm NaCl, 25 mm NaF, 25 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm Na2MoO4, 1 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 5 μg/ml of each leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin (all from Sigma) on ice. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation, and total protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). 10 μg of neutrophil protein and 30 μg of HIMEC extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted onto nitrocellulose, and blocked for 1 h at room temperature in 3% (w/v) BSA, 3% (w/v) nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 (TBS-T). After washing in TBS-T, blots were incubated with polyclonal rabbit anti-human anti-CXCR2 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) overnight at 4 °C. Immunodetection was performed using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA) and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). For detection of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2, subconfluent HIMEC monolayers were stimulated with recombinant human IL-8 (100 ng/ml) at different time points. HIMEC were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed as described above. 15 μg of total protein per lane was separated and blotted, and blocked blots were incubated with antibodies specific for phosphorylated and total ERK 1/2 (Cell Signaling Tech., Beverly, MA) at 4 °C overnight. Immunodetection was performed as described above. F-Actin polymerization was assessed in subconfluent HIMEC seeded on fibronectin-coated glass chamber slides (LabTek; Nalge Nunc, Naperville, IL). Cells were cultured in MCDB-131 containing 10% FBS, stimulated with 100 ng/ml recombinant human IL-8 (15 min), and fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 20 min. Cells were washed and permeabilized with Triton X-100 (0.2% (v/v) in PBS) for 10 min, blocked with 2.5% (w/v) BSA/PBS, and stained with fluorescein phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). After washing, slides were air dried and mounted with Fluromount-G (Southern Biotechnology, Birmingham, AL) and examined with a fluorescence microscope (Olympus BX-40) using a fixed shutter speed to allow for comparison of fluorescence intensity. In some experiments, stress fiber assembly was blocked by preincubation of cells with 10 μg/ml neutralizing CXCR2 antibody (30 min at 37 °C). Polycarbonate filters (8 μm pore size, BD Biosciences) were coated with human fibronectin (10 μg/ml) at 4 °C overnight. HIMEC were trypsinized, washed with chemotaxis buffer (MCDB-131 + 1% (w/v) BSA) containing soybean trypsin inhibitor (10 mg/ml), and resuspended in chemotaxis buffer. 5 × 105 cells were added to the upper chamber, and chemotaxis buffer (1000 μl) containing VEGF (50 ng/ml) or recombinant human IL-8 were filled into the lower compartment of the 12-well plates. After 3 h of incubation at 37 °C (5% CO2), cell culture inserts were removed and the upper side of the membrane was gently wiped. Filters were stained with DiffQuik (Baxter Scientific, McGraw, IL), air dried, and mounted onto glass slides. Migrated HIMEC adherent to the lower side of the membrane were counted (10 random high-power fields (×200) per condition). In inhibition studies, resuspended cells were incubated with neutralizing anti-CXCR2 antibodies (4 μg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C, isotype control antibodies, or inhibitors of MAPK kinase and PI3K as indicated in the figure legends. Control cells remained free of inhibitors. Cell viability was >95% as assessed by trypan blue exclusion. Each condition was assessed in triplicate. Cellular DNA synthesis was assessed by [3H]thymidine uptake. HIMEC were kept in medium without endothelial cell growth supplement (5% (v/v) FBS) for 48 h, trypsinized, and seeded onto fibronectin-coated 24-well plates (4 × 104 cells per well). After adherence (3 h, 37 °C), cells were stimulated for 18 h with IL-8 (1–100 ng/ml) in medium. Following 12 h of stimulation, cells were pulsed with [3H]thymidine (1 μCi/ml; Amersham Biosciences). After washing twice, cells were fixed for 10 min on ice with 5% (v/v) trichloroacetic acid. DNA was then released from precipitated material by alkaline lysis in 0.5 n NaOH, and supernatants were quantified in a β-counter. Endothelial tube formation was assessed using MatrigelTM, a solubilized extracellular basement membrane matrix extracted from the Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm mouse sarcoma, as described previously (42Salvucci O. Yao L. Villalba S. Sajewicz A. Pittaluga S. Tosato G. Blood. 2002; 99: 2703-2711Google Scholar). Multiwell dishes (24-well) were coated with 250 μl of complete medium containing 5 mg/ml Matrigel and HIMEC resuspended in complete growth medium were seeded at a density of 5 × 104. The growth medium was supplemented with the MAPK kinase inhibitors PD98059 (10 and 20 μm) LY294002 (10 and 20 μm), or wortmannin (50 or 100 nm). Control cells remained free of inhibitors. Cells were cultured on MatrigelTM for 16 h and endothelial tube formation was assessed by inverted phase-contrast microscopy. Five high-power fields per condition were examined and experiments were repeated in two independent HIMEC cultures. Control cells receiving Me2SO only served as a vehicle control (not shown). Full thickness normal colonic and ileal mucosa was fixed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde/PBS overnight, saturated in 20% (w/v) sucrose/PBS, embedded in OCT compound (Sakura, Japan), and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. 6-μm frozen sections were stained with monoclonal mouse anti-human antibodies (anti-CXCR2 (Clone 6C6)) at 4 °C overnight using the Cell and Tissue Staining kit (R&D Systems). After immunodetection of horseradish peroxidase conjugates with diaminobenzidine, sections were briefly counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin and mounted. Positive staining is visible as a dark-brown precipitate. Isotype IgG was used as a negative control. Statistical analysis was performed by analysis of variance using StatView for Macintosh (version 4.51; Abacus Concepts, Inc., Berkeley, CA). p < 0.05 was considered significant, and data shown are mean ± S.E. To assess CXCR1 and CXCR2 expression in cultured HIMEC, we performed reverse transcriptase-PCR using receptor-specific primers (Fig.1). The mRNA for CXCR2 was detected in unstimulated HIMEC. Moreover, CXCR2 mRNA was markedly increased upon challenge with TNF-α/LPS (100 IU/ml and 1 μg/ml, respectively). TNF-α is known to up-regulate IL-8 receptors in human microvascular EC (35Yoshida S. Ono M. Shono T. Izumi H. Ishibashi T. Suzuki H. Kuwano M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4015-4023Google Scholar), providing a possible mechanistic explanation for its in vivo proangiogenic effects (43Frater-Schroder M. Risau W. Hallmann R. Gautschi P. Bohlen P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 15: 5277-5281Google Scholar). Incubation of HIMEC with IFN-γ, an angiostatic cytokine in vitro (44Tsuruoka N. Sugiyama M. Tawaragi Y. Tsujimoto M. Nishihara T. Goto T. Sato N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 155: 429-435Google Scholar, 45Maheshwari R.K. Srikantan V. Bhartiya D. Kleinman H.K. Grant D.S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1991; 146: 164-169Google Scholar), led to a slight decrease in detectable mRNA for CXCR2, a receptor shown to mediate angiogenesis in vivo (32Addison C.L. Daniel T.O. Burdick M.D. Liu H. Ehlert J.E. Xue Y.Y. Buechi L. Walz A. Richmond A. Strieter R.M. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 5269-5277Google Scholar, 46Du J. Luan J. Liu H. Daniel T.O. Peiper S. Chen T.S. Yu Y. Horton L.W. Nanney L.B. Strieter R.M. Richmond A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2002; 71: 141-153Google Scholar). The message for CXCR1 could not be amplified in HIMEC cultures from 6 patients using up to 45 PCR cycles or re-amplification of PCR products (data not shown), whereas stimulated PBMC (positive control) from healthy donors yielded a robust signal. 12-Hour stimulation with proinflammatory stimuli (TNF-α, 100 IU/ml; LPS, 1 μg/ml; IFN-γ, 100 IU/ml; combination of TNF-α/LPS and IL-1β, 100 IU/ml) failed to induce detectable CXCR1 mRNA. We confirmed CXCR2 expression in HIMEC by flow cytometry. Unstimulated HIMEC expressed low levels of CXCR2 when compared with isotype control antibody (Fig.2 A). Staining with anti-CXCR1 antibody did not produce any signal above background (data not shown). Furthermore, we confirmed CXCR2 expression by Western blot analysis of total HIMEC lysates with a polyclonal anti-CXCR2 antibody, demonstrating a specific band in lysates of two different HIMEC populations. Neutrophil lysates from healthy donors served as a positive control (Fig. 2 B). To further assess expression of CXCR2, the putative receptor for ELR+chemokine-mediated CXCR2 angiogenesis in vivo, we performed immunostaining. CXCR2 was detected by immunohistochemistry of both colonic (Fig. 3 A) and small intestinal (Fig. 3 B) normal full thickness specimens. Microvessels in close proximity to colorectal adenocarcinoma were similarly stained as was normal colon (not shown). Isotype controls did not produce detectable specific signal (Fig. 3, C andD). Chemokines typically elicit activation and migration of target cells. Having shown that HIMEC express an IL-8 receptor, we next assessed induction of stress fibers as a biological function for chemokine receptor signaling by incubation with fluorescein phalloidin. In unstimulated HIMEC, F-actin staining was limited to the cell periphery and intercellular junctions (arrow, Fig. 4 A). IL-8 (100 ng/ml) lead to a rapid (starting at ∼1 min) and sustained (30 min) F-actin reorganization in HIMEC, showing prominent stress fiber bundles (arrows, Fig. 4 B) and a marked increase in fluorescence intensity. In addition, cellular retraction could be observed at the periphery (arrowheads) of some cells, leading to gaps in the monolayer (Fig. 4 B). Stress fiber induction in response to IL-8 utilizes CXCR2, as preincubation of HIMEC with neutralizing anti-CXCR2 antibodies markedly attenuated IL-8-induced F-actin polymerization (Fig. 4 C). Having demonstrated IL-8 activation of stress fibers in HIMEC, we assessed its ability to stimulate cell migration/chemotaxis using fibronectin-coated polycarbonate filters"
https://openalex.org/W2040700968,"Neurons that release hypocretin/orexin modulate sleep, arousal, and energy homeostasis; the absence of hypocretin results in narcolepsy. Here we present data on the physiological characteristics of these cells, identified with GFP in transgenic mouse brain slices. Hypocretin-1 and -2 depolarized hypocretin neurons by 15mV and evoked an increase in spike frequency (+366% from a 1-3 Hz baseline). The mechanism for this appears to be hypocretin-mediated excitation of local glutamatergic neurons that regulate hypocretin neuron activity, in part by presynaptic facilitation of glutamate release. This represents a possible mechanism for orchestrating the output of the diffuse hypothalamic arousal system. No direct effect of hypocretin on membrane properties of hypocretin cells was detected. Norepinephrine and serotonin, transmitters of other arousal systems, decreased spike frequency and evoked outward currents, whereas acetylcholine and histamine had little effect."

Microporous materials were obtained in all four combinations of M4+ and M3+, and some of them were thermally stable up to at least 380 degrees C. These materials exhibit framework topologies with pore size ranging from 12 to 24 tetrahedral atoms, high surface area, high framework charge density and ion exchange capacity, and tunable electronic and optical properties."
https://openalex.org/W1990740805,"Bursts of neuronal activity are transmitted more effectively as synapses mature. However, the mechanisms that control synaptic efficiency during development are poorly understood. Here, we study postnatal changes in synaptic ultrastructure and exocytosis in a calyx-type nerve terminal. Vesicle pool size, exocytotic efficiency (amount of exocytosis per Ca influx), Ca current facilitation, and the number of active zones (AZs) increased with age, whereas AZ area, number of docked vesicles per AZ, and release probability decreased with age. These changes led to AZs that are less prone to multivesicular release, resulting in reduced AMPA receptor saturation and desensitization. A greater multiplicity of small AZs with few docked vesicles, a larger pool of releasable vesicles, and a higher efficiency of release thus promote prolonged high-frequency firing in mature synapses."
https://openalex.org/W1979366584,"Viewing other persons' actions automatically activates brain areas belonging to the mirror-neuron system (MNS) assumed to link action execution and observation. We followed, by magnetoencephalographic cortical dynamics, subjects who observed still pictures of lip forms, on-line imitated them, or made similar forms in a self-paced manner. In all conditions and in both hemispheres, cortical activation progressed in 20-70 ms steps from the occipital cortex to the superior temporal region (where the strongest activation took place), the inferior parietal lobule, and the inferior frontal lobe (Broca's area), and finally, 50-140 ms later, to the primary motor cortex. The signals of Broca's area and motor cortex were significantly stronger during imitation than other conditions. These results demonstrate that still pictures, only implying motion, activate the human MNS in a well-defined temporal order."
https://openalex.org/W2006768051,"Recent studies of peptidoglycan recognition protein (PGRP) have shown that 2 of the 13 Drosophila PGRP genes encode proteins that function as receptors mediating immune responses to bacteria. We show here that another member, PGRP-SC1B, has a totally different function because it has enzymatic activity and thereby can degrade peptidoglycan. A mass spectrometric analysis of the cleavage products demonstrates that the enzyme hydrolyzes the lactylamide bond between the glycan strand and the cross-linking peptides. This result assigns the protein as anN-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase (EC3.5.1.28), and the corresponding gene is thus the first of this class to be described from a eukaryotic organism. Mutant forms of PGRP-SC1B lacking a potential zinc ligand are enzymatically inactive but retain their peptidoglycan affinity. The immunostimulatory properties of PGRP-SC1B-degraded peptidoglycan are much reduced. This is in striking contrast to lysozyme-digested peptidoglycan, which retains most of its elicitor activity. This points toward a scavenger function for PGRP-SC1B. Furthermore, a sequence homology comparison with phage T7 lysozyme, also an N-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase, shows that as many as six of the Drosophila PGRPs could belong to this class of proteins.

Signal transduction pathways are immediately activated to induce genes for antimicrobial peptides or signaling molecules such as tumor necrosis factor-α (1Silverman N. Maniatis T. Gene Dev. 2001; 15: 2321-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar). Pre-formed humoral protein cascades can also be triggered by a single microbe through strong binding to cell wall fragments (2Takaki Y. Seki N. Kawabata Si S. Iwanaga S. Muta T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14281-14287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). It is therefore important that organisms have efficient mechanisms to remove such immunogenic substances. This is necessary to be able to respond to a second infection and to minimize overreaction to foreign material and the risk of septic shock. Usually microbes are internalized for further processing after being bound to cellular scavenger receptors (3Gough P.J. Gordon S. Microbes Infect. 2000; 2: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar,4Aderem A. Underhill D.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 593-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (2112) Google Scholar). In the late 1980s, Janeway (5Janeway C.A.J. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1989; 54: 1-13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) formulated the concept of pattern recognition. This concept implies that the innate immune system is set to recognize molecular patterns that are common to most microbes and that are essential structural parts of the microbial cell. Such pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs),1 e.g.lipopolysaccharide, peptidoglycan (PGN), and β-glucan, were postulated to be recognized by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). In mammals, the Toll-like receptors (TLR) are involved in the response to a variety of PAMP molecules, and in at least one case, a TLR has been shown to be a true PRR (6Iwaki D. Mitsuzawa H.

Microbiol. 2002; 5: 70-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The differential recognition of different pathogens enables insects to respond with a somewhat adapted response, depending on the nature of the infecting pathogen (8Lemaitre B. Reichhart J.M. Hoffmann J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14614-14619Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). In Drosophila melanogaster there are 13 genes for peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRP) (9Werner T. Liu G. Kang D. Ekengren S. Steiner H. Hultmark D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13772-13777Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). A gene knock out of one of these, PGRP-SA, was shown to be defective in the response to Micrococcus luteus in adult flies via the Toll/Dif pathway (10Michel T. Reichhart J.M. Hoffmann J.A. Royet J. Nature. 2001; 414: 756-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). In similar genetic screens, one of the membrane-bound forms, PGRP-LCx, was shown to be required for activation of the Relish pathway (11Choe K.M. Werner T. Stöven S. Hultmark D. Anderson K.V. Science. 2002; 296: 359-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 12Gottar M. Gobert V. Michel T. Belvin M. Duyk G. Hoffmann J.A. Ferrandon D. Royet J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 13854-13860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar) that PGRP is needed to trigger the prophenol oxidase cascade with PGN in Bombyx mori. Because these three PGRP proteins have been shown to have affinity for peptidoglycan, they are all true PRRs (9Werner T. Liu G. Kang D. Ekengren S. Steiner H. Hultmark D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A homology comparison of PGRP and bacteriophage T7 lysozyme identified PGRP as part of the N-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase superfamily of proteins (15Kang D.W. Liu G. Lundström A. Gelius E. Steiner H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10078-10082Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). This enzyme hydrolyzes the bond between the N-acetylmuramyl group in the glycan strand and the l-alanine in the stem peptide in peptidoglycan. None of the two receptor PGRPs (SA and LCx) has such amidase activity.2 However,N-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase activity has been found in mammalian sera, and the enzymatic properties of a human enzyme have been well characterized (16Valinger Z. Ladesic B. Tomasic J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 701: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 17Vanderwinkel E. de Pauw P. Philipp D. Ten Have J.P. Bainter K. Biochem. Mol. Med. 1995; 54: 26-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), although the gene for this enzyme is not known. This is in contrast to the many known genes of bacterial N-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidases, which take part in the degradation of the bacterial cell wall (18Shockman G.D. Daneo-Moore L. Kariyama R. Massidda O. Microb. Drug Resist. 1996; 2: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In the present study we report that one member of the PGRP family, theDrosophila SC1B, is anN-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase, and we examine the immunogenicity of peptidoglycan being digested with this enzyme. The inserts of the cDNA clones pBacPAK9/PGRP-SC1B-His and pBacPAK9/PGRP-SA-His (9Werner T. Liu G. Kang D. Ekengren S. Steiner H. Hultmark D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13772-13777Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar) were excised from the baculovirus vector pBacPAK9 with EcoRI and XhoI and ligated into the pMT/V5-His expression vector (Invitrogen). Because the insert contains six histidine codons followed by a stop codon, neither the V5 epitope nor the vector His tag was utilized. The vector contains a copper-inducible metallothionein promoter. The Drosophila Expression System (Invitrogen) was employed to produce Schneider 2 (S2) cell lines expressing the following His-tagged proteins: PGRP-SA(−His), PGRP-SC1B(−His), and the mutants PGRP-SC1B[C168S](−His) and PGRP-SC1B[C168A](−His). The vector pCoHYGRO encoding a hygromycin-B resistance gene was used for selection. Transfection was performed using the calcium phosphate method (19Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 16.33-16.36Google Scholar). Stable clones were selected in Schneider'sDrosophila medium (PAN Biotech) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and hygromycin-B (300 μg/ml). Transformed cells were adapted to serum-free medium (HyClone Hy-Q-CCM3) and grown in 500-ml suspension cultures at 21 °C. At a concentration of 3 × 106 cells/ml, the cells were induced with CuSO4(500 μm) and grown for 5 days. Cells were centrifuged (3,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C), and the medium was assayed for protein. Proteins in the medium were precipitated with 70% saturated ammonium sulfate overnight at 4 °C. The precipitate was spun down (8,000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C), and the pellet was dissolved in 30 ml of water. The suspension was dialyzed against 2 liters of binding buffer (5 mm imidazole, 600 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.9) with two changes of buffer over an 18-h period. Proteins were applied to the superloop in a fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences AB) and passed through a nickel-charged HiTrap chelating HP column (Amersham Biosciences) at 1 ml/min. The column was washed with 60 mm imidazole, 600 mm NaCl, 20 mmTris, pH 7.9, and elution was performed with a linear gradient to 600 mm imidazole. The proteins eluted at ∼20% elution buffer and were essentially free from other proteins, which was confirmed with a Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Insoluble peptidoglycan fromStaphylococcus aureus Cowan 1, M. luteus Ml 11, and Bacillus megaterium Bm 11 was prepared as described (20Rosenthal R.S. Dziarski R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 235: 253-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In short, bacterial lawns were grown overnight at 37 °C on nutrient agar plates. Cells were collected and suspended in saline and boiled for 20 min. Bacteria were pelleted, washed with saline, water, and acetone, and then dried at 37 °C. Bacteria were resuspended in cold water with an equal volume of 0.1-mm glass beads and homogenized using a Bead Beater (Biospec Products) 10 times for 2 min and filtered through a glass filter. Unbroken cells were sedimented by centrifugation at 1,500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and cell walls were collected at 6,500 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Cell walls were then treated with 100 μg/ml RNase A (Sigma), 50 μg/ml DNase I (Sigma), and 0.25% toluene. The suspension was incubated with slow shaking for 18 h in 37 °C. Trypsin (200 μg/ml) (Sigma) was added and incubated for another 18 h at 37 °C. Cell walls were collected, washed, and lyophilized. For teichoic acid removal, S. aureus and B. megaterium PGN were incubated with 5% trichloroacetic acid at 22 °C for 18 h. The insoluble walls were heated at 90 °C for 15 min, washed three times with water and three times with acetone, and dried. Insoluble trichloroacetic acid-treated PGN from S. aureus was suspended in PBS (pH 7.2 at 4 mg/ml) and briefly sonicated using an XL2020 Sonicator (Misonix). PGN (1 mg/ml) was then incubated with PGRP-SC1B or hen egg white lysozyme (EC 3.2.1.17) (Sigma) at different concentrations. Clearance of the turbid solutions was monitored as decrease in absorbance at 540 nm on a Titertec iEMS Reader MF (Labsystems) for 10 h at 25 °C with occasional shaking. To measure substrate specificity and to compare the activities of PGRP-SC1B and the mutants PGRP-SC1B[C168S] and PGRP-SC1B[C168A], the assay was slightly modified. Tris buffer (60 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl) was used, and the final concentrations of PGRP-SC1B and PGN were 10 and 330 μg/ml, respectively. Peptidoglycans used were from S. aureus and B. megaterium (with and without teichoic acids) and M. luteus (lacking teichoic acid). A 540was measured every 5 min for 3 h. The initial rate was calculated as ΔA 540/(Δtime × [enzyme]). The antibacterial activity of PGRP-SC1B against S. aureus, B. megaterium, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus thuringiensis, Micrococcus luteus, Escherichia coli D22, E. coli D31, and Enterobacter cloacae β12 was tested in a zone inhibition assay on thin agar plates (21Hultmark D. Engström A. Bennich H. Kapur R. Boman H.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 127: 207-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Bacteria were grown to mid-log phase, and 2 μl from a 100× bacterial dilution was mixed with 8 ml of 47 °C yeast tryptone agar and spread on a Petri dish. Samples (2 μl) of PGRP-SC1B (2–50 μg/ml) were loaded to 2-mm diameter holes in the agar plate. Drosophilambn-2 cells were grown in 35-mm culture dishes in Schneider'sDrosophila medium (PAN Biotech) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). Cells were seeded at 1 × 106 cells/ml and grown for 24 h at 25 °C. S. aureus trichloroacetic acid-treated PGN (1 mg/ml) was pretreated by incubation for 10 h at 25 °C with hen egg white lysozyme (20 μg/ml), PGRP-SC1B (20 μg/ml), or with a mixture of both enzymes. Control PGN was incubated in PBS under the same conditions. Digested or control PGN was added to the mbn-2 cells at a concentration of 5 μg/ml. As additional control, mbn-2 cells were treated with PGRP-SC1B (20 μg/ml), hen egg white lysozyme (20 μg/ml), and PBS. Total RNA was isolated from the mbn-2 cells at 2, 6, and 24 h after induction. Total RNA was isolated using Trizol (Invitrogen), essentially following the manufacturer's instructions. RNA (15 μg per lane) was separated on a denaturing 1% agarose gel and subsequently capillary-blotted onto a Hybond-XL nylon filter (Amersham Biosciences). The filter was probed with [32P]dCTP random prime-labeled (Amersham Biosciences Rediprime II kit) cDNAs for cecropin A1, attacin, diptericin, and ribosomal protein 49. High stringency hybridization at 42 °C was performed and a PhosphorImaging screen was exposed to the filter. Scanning was done using a FLA-3000 scanner (Fuji film), and data were analyzed with Image Gauge 3.45 software (Fuji film). Peptidoglycan fromS. aureus (1.8 mg/ml) was cleaved with PGRP-SCIB (6 μg/ml) in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer, pH 7.0, at 22 °C for 18 h with rocking. After incubation, a sample was hydrolyzed with lysostaphin (EC 3.4.24.75) (12.5 μg/ml) (Sigma) for 18 h at 22 °C with rocking. Reverse phase HPLC was carried out using a Varian 5000 Liquid Chromatograph with a 5-μm Brownlee 4.6 × 30-mm RP-18 column. The sample was centrifuged for 4 min at 13,000 rpm, and a 200-μl aliquot of the supernatant was applied to the column. The initial solvent was 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and the sample was eluted with a gradient of acetonitrile containing 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. The gradient profile was as follows: 0%, 0 min; 15%, 20 min; 25%, 25 min; and 60%, 30 min. All separations were monitored at 214 nm. The fractions were collected manually and subsequently subjected to MALDI-TOF mass spectral analysis. The masses of the samples were measured by MALDI-TOF MS using a Voyager DE STR (Applied Biosystems) operating in the reflector, positive ion mode. The accelerating voltage was set to 20 kV with an extraction delay time of 125 ns. For each spectrum, 250 laser shots were averaged. Mass spectra were calibrated externally by Calibration Mixtures 1 (SequazymeTM Peptide Mass Standard Kit, Perspective Biosystems). The sample (0.5 μl) was applied and mixed with 0.5 μl of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid in 50% acetonitrile on the sample plate. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed to produce two mutants of PGRP-SC1B-His (C168S and C168A) using a two-step PCR strategy. First, two PCRs were done with pMT/PGRP-SC1B-His as template. One reaction used 5′-CATCTCAGTGCAACTAA-3′, a complementary sequence to the pMT/V5-His expression vector upstream of PGRP-SC1B, as the sense primer plus a mutagenic primer complementary to bases 483–519 in the coding sequence of PGRP-SC1B. The other reaction was with the complementary mutagenic primer plus 5′-TAGAAGGCACAGTCGAGG-3′, a sequence downstream of PGRP-SC1B in the vector. The mutagenic primers substitute the Cys-168 TGC codon for a TCC serine codon or a GCC alanine codon. After separation on a 1% agarose gel, the PCR products were purified using the Mini-elute gel extraction kit (Qiagen). In the second PCR step, the purified fragments from the first PCR step were used as templates with the same flanking vector primers as above. The resulting PCR product was purified using gel extraction, cleaved with restriction enzymes EcoRI and XhoI (Invitrogen), and inserted into pMT/V5-His. The mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. PCRs were run using a PC-960G Gradient Thermal Cycler (Corbett Research) and Deep Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs). Oligonucleotide primers were purchased from DNA Technology A/S (Aarhus, Denmark). Sequencing of plasmid constructs was performed using DYEnamic terminator ET cycle sequencing kit (Amersham Biosciences). Insoluble trichloroacetic acid-treated peptidoglycan (1 mg/ml) from S. aureus was incubated with PGRP-SC1B, PGRP-SC1B[C168A], PGRP-SC1B[C168S], or PGRP-SA in Tris buffer (60 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl) for 30 min at 4 °C. The samples were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatants were collected. The PGN pellet fraction was washed with Tris buffer, centrifuged, and dissolved in SDS loading buffer. Supernatant and pellet fractions were analyzed on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. A recombinant PGRP-SC1B protein was synthesized using the Schneider expression system and S2 insect cells. Codons coding for 6 histidine residues were added to the C terminus by PCR to facilitate purification of recombinant protein. After metal chelate affinity column purification, the protein was essentially pure (Fig.1 C). We tested the peptidoglycan degrading activity of the purified protein. The activity is compared with that of egg white lysozyme in PBS at pH 7.2 (Fig. 1). The activity is dose-dependent, and the kinetic curves with 2 μg/ml lysozyme and 5 μg/ml PGRP-SC1B are similar. The kinetics of the enzymatic digestion of PGN thus shows that PGRP-SC1B is almost as efficient as hen egg white lysozyme for degradation of PGN fromS. aureus. TableI shows the activity of PGRP-SC1B against purified peptidoglycans from different bacteria. The protein is active against all peptidoglycans tested; however, it has by far the highest activity against trichloroacetic acid-treated S. aureuspeptidoglycan that lacks teichoic acid. We also noted an increased activity against PGN from B. megaterium after trichloroacetic acid treatment.Table IEnzymatic activity of PGRP-SCIB to peptidoglycan from different speciesPeptidoglycan sourceTeichoic acidaTeichoic acid was removed by treatment with 5% trichloroacetic acid at 22 °C for 18 h.Initial rateRelative activityml·min−1·mg−1%Staphylococcus aureus−0.175100+0.02514.3Bacillus megaterium−0.06034.3+0.04022.9Micrococcus luteus−0.06537.1Peptidoglycan (0.33 mg/ml) was incubated with PGRP-SC1B (10 μg/ml) in 60 mm Tris buffer. pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl.

To find out which bond is cleaved by PGRP-SC1B, we compared the HPLC profiles of undigested S. aureuspeptidoglycan and peptidoglycan cleaved with PGRP-SC1B (Fig.2). The profile of undigested control peptidoglycan shows no peaks. In contrast, there is a complex pattern of peaks in the PGRP-SC1B-cleaved sample. Because S. aureuspeptidoglycan has a high degree of cross-linking (22Ghuysen J.-M. Strominger J.L. Tipper D.J. Compr. Biochem. 1968; 26: 53-104Google Scholar), the size and structure of the PGRP-SC1B-cleaved peptides vary greatly, which explains the profile. To simplify the pattern, PGRP-SC1B-treated peptidoglycan was digested with the endopeptidase lysostaphin, which hydrolyzes the pentaglycine bridges that cross-link the stem peptides (1Silverman N. Maniatis T. Gene Dev. 2001; 15: 2321-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar). The number of peaks in the chromatogram is dramatically reduced to one major and one minor peak (Fig. 2 C). To determine the masses of the peptidoglycan fragments, the material in the major peak was analyzed using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The spectrum (Fig. 3) is dominated by peaks with masses corresponding to those of the fragments that can be derived from the known structure of S. aureus peptidoglycan (Fig. 3, inset). The pattern is compatible with PGRP-SC1B cleaving between N-acetylmuramic acid andl-alanine in peptidoglycan. The multitude of peaks in the spectrum is fully explained by (i) lysostaphin cleavage at different positions in the penta-glycine bridges and by (ii) two parallel series of peaks generated by sodium replacement of a hydrogen ion. For example, the peak at 702.4 Da is in good agreement with a protonated stem peptide plus five glycine residues with a calculated mass of 703.3 (Table II).Table IISummary of peptidoglycan fragment mass mapping analysisPeptide structureType of ionTheoreticalObservedm/zAEKA + G2[M + H]+532.27531.27AEKA + G3[M + H]+589.29589.30AEKA + G4[M + H]+646.31645.33AEKA + G4[M + Na]+667.31667.32AEKA + G5[M + H]+703.33702.36AEKA + G5[M + Na]+724.33724.35AEKA + G6[M + H]+759.35759.39AEKA + G6[M + Na]+781.35781.38S. aureus peptidoglycan was cleaved with PGRP-SCIB plus lysostaphin and analyzed by MALDI-MS as shown in Fig. 3. Open table in a new tab S. aureus peptidoglycan was cleaved with PGRP-SCIB plus lysostaphin and analyzed by MALDI-MS as shown in Fig. 3. In bacteriophage T7 lysozyme, Cys-130 is a zinc ligand essential forN-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase activity. To examine the impact of the homologous Cys-168 in PGRP-SC1B on amidase activity and PGN-binding properties, we constructed two mutants using site-directed mutagenesis. In the receptor type PGRPs (PGRP-SA and PGRP-LCx), a serine residue is found in this position. Therefore, we made the substitution C168S as well as C168A as a control. Fig.4 A shows that both mutants have lost enzymatic activity. This suggests that cysteine in position 168 is an active-site residue, most likely a zinc ligand, also in PGRP and thereby required for amidase activity. However, the capacity to bind peptidoglycan (Fig. 4 B) is retained in both mutants in consonance with the fact that receptor function is not dependent on this residue being a metal ligand. The finding that PGRP-SC1B degrades peptidoglycan prompted us to test if PGRP-SC1B is bacteriolytic. PGRP-SC1B did not exhibit any antibacterial activity against any of the five Gram-positive and three Gram-negative bacterial strains employed in the plate assay (data not shown). Thus the PGN layer of living bacteria is not susceptible to degradation by PGPR-SC1B. As indicated in Table I, this inertness is partly due to the presence of teichoic acid. We cannot, however, exclude the possibility that PGRP-SC1B has antibacterial effects in synergy with other immune proteins. As PGN is a strong elicitor of immune responses in insects, we assayed the influence of PGRP-SC1B on this elicitor activity. Challenge ofDrosophila mbn-2 cells with intact peptidoglycan (Fig.5) results in a typical immune induction pattern, namely an early response of cecropin A1 that persists over time and a more delayed response of attacin and diptericin. Interestingly, the inducibility of the antibacterial peptide genes was drastically reduced when PGRP-SC1B-degraded peptidoglycan was added to the cells. In contrast, the lysozyme-digested PGN remained immunostimulatory to the mbn-2 cells because the immune genes tested were induced to almost the same levels as when exposed to intact PGN. None of the control treatments with protein alone had immune stimulatory effect. We also tested conditions more similar to the physiological situation in the fly in which both lysozymes and PGRP-SC1B are constitutively expressed. The cells were practically unable to respond to the double-digested peptidoglycan, implying an efficient scavenging effect abolishing immunogenic PGN concentrations in the insect. What is the physiological role for PGRP-SC1B? We have shown clearly that it degrades peptidoglycan and that the degradation products are less immunostimulatory, but not all peptidoglycans are equally well degraded. Those from S. aureus and M. luteus contain l-Lys and a peptide cross-linking bridge of a slightly different structure. B. megaterium and most Gram-negative bacteria have PGN withmeso-diaminopimelic acid and direct cross-linking between stem peptides. This PGN is the most resistant of those tested, but the differences are small. We observed the largest difference between PGN with and without teichoic acid. In nature other enzymes may initially remove teichoic acid from the cell wall. In the physiological situation, PGRP-SC1B also works in concert with lysozyme to make the peptidoglycan structure more accessible for PGRP amidases to abolish PGN immunogenicity. With lysozyme we also saw a difference in activity against PGN with and without teichoic acid (not shown), confirming earlier studies on lysozyme specificity (23Ohta K. Komatsuzawa H. Sugai M. Suginaka H. Microbiol. Immunol. 1998; 42: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The ancient connection to phage T7 lysozyme was noticed when the first PGRPs were cloned (15Kang D.W. Liu G. Lundström A. Gelius E. Steiner H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10078-10082Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar), and these proteins were extensively tested for amidase activity but were found to be negative. From the known crystal structure of bacteriophage T7 lysozyme and a mutational analysis, five amino acid residues have been shown to be required for enzymatic activity (24Cheng X. Zhang X. Pflugrath J.W. Studier F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4034-4038Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). A sequence homology comparison between theDrosophila PGRPs and T7 lysozyme with respect to these residues shows that PGRP-SC1B has four of these five residues conserved (Fig. 6). The fifth amino acid residue, Lys-128 in T7 lysozyme, is replaced by a threonine in PGRP-SC1B; however, in T7 lysozyme it was shown that a threonine can be substituted for the lysine residue with retained but reduced activity. If one allows for a threonine in this position one observes that five other members of the Drosophila PGRP family have these five amino acid residues in common. These potentially enzymatically active proteins are PGRP-SB1, PGRP-SB2, PGRP-SC1A, PGRP-SC2, and PGRP-LB. If our hypothesis is correct, the expression pattern of PGRP-SB1 (9Werner T. Liu G. Kang D. Ekengren S. Steiner H. Hultmark D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13772-13777Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar),i.e. high inducibility in the fat body and secretion, makes it a good candidate for being a modulator of immunity reactions in fat body and hemocytes. The PGRP-SC1B gene is expressed predominantly in gut cells; the localization of the protein is not known, but a luminal export is likely. With such a localization, one should not exclude a digestive function for this particular form.PGRP-SC2 has a similar expression pattern asPGRP-SC1B, but in addition it is induced in the fat body. Interestingly, the two PGRPs with receptor functions, PGRP-SA and PGRP-LCx, both have a serine substitution in the position corresponding to the Cys-130 zinc ligand in T7 lysozyme. This modification removes one of the three potential zinc ligands and would make these proteins inactive enzymes. This substitution can also be found in otherDrosophila PGRPs as well as in the B. mori PGRP being a receptor for the prophenol oxidase cascade (14Yoshida H. Kinoshita K. Ashida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13854-13860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Also some of the mammalian forms have this substitution, making them candidates for being signaling PGRPs rather than enzymes. Furthermore, our analysis of PGRP-SC1B mutants shows Cys-130 to be essential for amidase activity but not for binding PGN. A cysteine residue in this position can thus serve as a marker for an effector type PGRP, and a non-cysteine residue could be an indication of a PGRP receptor function. The concept of receptors and scavengers belonging to the same family of proteins contains an apparent logic. If PGRP-SC1B binds to the same motif in PGN as PGRP-SA and LCx, an obvious explanation for the scavenger effect of PGRP-SC1B is that it cleaves in the middle of the binding motif for the receptor PGRPs. This effect is not obtained with lysozyme because a different bond is cleaved. It has been suggested that the minimal PGN structure required to elicit an immune response in insects contains the two sugar moieties N-actetylglucosamine and N-acetylmuramic acid bound to the stem peptide Lys-Glu-DAP-Ala (25Iketani M. Nishimura H. Akayama K. Yamano Y. Morishima I. Insect. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 29: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This is consistent with our results, as such an active product is obtained by lysozyme cleaving the glycan strand but not by PGRP-SC1B, which instead hydrolyzes the bond between the peptide and the glycan strand. PGRP-SC1B is in this way efficiently destroying the PAMP properties of peptidoglycan. In the mammalian system, recognition of peptidoglycan is thought to be mediated by TLR2 directly binding to PGN (6Iwaki D. Mitsuzawa H. Murakami S. Sano H. Konishi M. Akino T. Kuroki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24315-24320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 26Schwandner R. Dziarski R. Wesche H. Rothe M. Kirschning C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17406-17409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar). A receptor function for PGRP as in insects has not yet been demonstrated in mammals, but the PGN structure recognized seems to be similar if not identical in the two systems. Drosophila PGRP-SC1B is the first eukaryotic N-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase gene to be described. However, a humanN-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase has been purified from serum and shown to reduce the immunostimulatory effect of peptidoglycan (27Hoijer M.A. Melief M.J. Debets R. Hazenberg M.P. Eur. Cytokine Netw. 1997; 8: 375-381PubMed Google Scholar). It will be interesting to find out if the amidase activity in vertebrate sera also can be ascribed to PGRP proteins. Studies of scavenger functions in Drosophila have concentrated on cell-mediated responses performed by macrophage-like cells, expressing scavenger receptors that engulf bacteria and bacterial fragments (28Rämet M. Pearson A. Manfruelli P. Li X.H. Koziel H. Gobel V. Chung E. Krieger M. Ezekowitz R.A.B. Immunity. 2001; 15: 1027-1038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). One of these cellular receptors is a member of the PGRP family (13Rämet M. Manfruelli P. Pearson A. MatheyPrevot B. Ezekowitz R.A.B. Nature. 2002; 416: 644-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). Our study now shows that a secreted PGRP protein also can accomplish a scavenging task in innate immunity."

We identify genes likely to be required for these functions downstream of sensory inputs. Here, we characterize one of these genes as egl-4, which we show encodes a cGMP-dependent protein kinase.

Previous studies of β-cells focused on protein kinase A (PKA) as a downstream effector of cAMP action. However, it is now apparent that cAMP also exerts its effects by binding to cAMP-regulated guanine nucleotide exchange factors (Epac). Although one effector of Epac is the Ras-related G protein Rap1, it is not fully understood what the functional consequences of Epac-mediated signal transduction are at the cellular level. 8-(4-chloro-phenylthio)-2′-O-methyladenosine-3′-5′-cyclic monophosphate (8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP) is a newly described cAMP analog, and it activates Epac but not PKA.

Analysis of cAMP-mediated signaling pathways is complicated by the lack of specificity with which cAMP acts. cAMP targets not only PKA and Epac, but also certain cAMP phosphodiesterases and ion channels (3Schwede F. Maronde E. Genieser H.-G. Jastorff B. Pharmacol. Ther. 2000; 87: 199-226Google Scholar). Recent structure-function analyses of cAMP action demonstrate that introduction of a 2′-methoxyl group in place of the 2′-hydroxyl group of cAMP confers Epac specificity to the cyclic nucleotide (4Enserink J.M.

One such analog is 8-(4-chloro-phenylthio)-2′-O-methyladenosine (8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP). Rap1 activation assays conductedin vitro demonstrate that 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP binds to and activates Epac1 with higher apparent affinity (EC50 2.2 μm) than cAMP itself (EC50 30 μm) (4Enserink J.M.

Furthermore, 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP is a weak activator of PKA (4Enserink J.M. Christensen A.E. de Rooij J. Triest M.V. Schwede F. Genieser H.G. Døskeland S.O. Blank J.L. Bos J.L. Nat.

We now demonstrate that 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP is an effective stimulus for Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR) and exocytosis in human pancreatic β-cells and an insulin-secreting cell line (INS-1). The action of 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP is shown to be independent of PKA but is blocked by overexpression of dominant negative Epac2. Therefore, 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP is likely to serve as a specific pharmacological tool for analyses of PKA-independent signaling properties of cAMP in the regulation of intracellular Ca2+ signaling and exocytosis. Human islets of Langerhans were provided under the auspices of the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation International Islet Distribution Program. Single cell suspensions of human islet cells were prepared by digestion with trypsin-EDTA, and the cells were plated onto glass coverslips (25CIR-1; Fisher) coated with 1 mg/ml concanavalin A (type V; Sigma).

All reagents for cell culture were obtained from Invitrogen. A plasmid in which expression of enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) was placed under the control of the rat insulin II gene promoter (RIP2) was constructed by fusing a −695-bp BamH1 fragment of RIP2 to the coding sequence of EYFP contained within the pEYFP-N1 expression plasmid (Clontech). LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen) was used to transfect INS-1 cells with this plasmid designated as RIP2-EYFP, and clones of INS-1 cells exhibiting stable transfection were obtained by antibiotic resistance selection using G418. For construction of adenovirus, RIP2-EYFP was PCR-amplified inserting XhoI (5′ end, primer CTC GAG ACC GCG GGC CCG GGA TCC) and KpnI (3′ end, primer GGT ACC CCT CTA CAA ATG TGG TAT GGC TG) digestion sites on either end of the RIP2-EYFP sequence. The PCR product was subcloned into pCR2.1, and RIP2-EYFP was then inserted into a XhoI/KpnI site of AdLox.HTM. The RIP2-EYFP-AdLox.HTM vector was co-transfected with psi5 vector into CRE8 cells expressing CRE recombinase. This resulted in recombination of the RIPYFP-AdLox.HTM vector with the psi5 vector (6Chan C.B. MacDonald P.E. Saleh M.C. Johns D.C. Marban E. Wheeler M.B. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1482-1486Google Scholar). The psi5 vector acts as a donor virus to supply viral backbone. AdRIPYFP viral particles generated in this manner were passaged three times in CRE8 cells and CsCl gradient-purified. 109 viral particles/ml were used to infect β-cells or islets. Pancreatic islets isolated from male Wistar rats (250 g) were plated on rat tail collagen and infected for 48 h with AdRIP2EYFP. Islets were stained for insulin using guinea pig anti-insulin and a secondary anti-guinea pig IgG conjugated with rhodamine TRITC (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). Islets were stained for glucagon using rabbit anti-glucagon, 08–0064, (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA) and a secondary anti-rabbit IgG-conjugated with rhodamine TRITC. Laser scanning confocal microscopy was performed (Carl Zeiss, LSM 410), and images were obtained using a 63× oil immersion objective. Expression of EYFP was detected through use of an inverted microscope (Eclipse TE300, Nikon Instruments, Melville, NY) equipped with a 75-W xenon arc lamp serving as a light source. A liquid light guide directed unfiltered excitation light to an EYFP filter set mounted in a filter cube containing an HQ500/20 excitation filter, a Q515LP dichroic beamsplitter, and an HQ535/30 emission filter (HQ filter set 41028, Chroma Tech. Corp., Brattleboro, VT). Once an EYFP-positive cell was identified, the filter cube was switched manually to a second filter cube containing components of the fura-2 filter set. Excitation light provided by the xenon arc lamp was reflected by a rotating chopper mirror through 340/20BP and 380/20BP excitation filters (Chroma) mounted in a motorized filter wheel located at the light source. The filtered light was then directed to the fura-2 filter set by way of the liquid light guide. The fura-2 filter cube contained a 400DCLP dichroic beamsplitter and a 510/80 excitation filter (Chroma). The fura-2 loading solution consisted of a standard extracellular saline (SES) containing (in mm): 138 NaCl, 5.6 KCl, 2.6 CaCl2, 1.2 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, and 5.6d-glucose. The SES was supplemented with 1 μm fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester (fura-2 AM; Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR), 2% FBS, and 0.02% Pluronic F-127 (w/v; Molecular Probes Inc.). Cells were exposed to fura-2 AM for 20–30 min at 22 °C. The loading solution was removed, and cells were washed and equilibrated in fresh SES for 10 min at 22 °C. Images were acquired using a 100× UVF oil immersion objective (numerical aperature 1.3, Nikon), and dual excitation wavelength microfluorimetry was performed ratiometrically at 0.5-s intervals using a digital video imaging system outfitted with an intensified charge-coupled device camera (IonOptix Corp., Milton, MA). [Ca2+]i was calculated according to methods established (7Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Google Scholar, 8Holz G.G. Leech C.A. Heller R.S. Castonguay M. Habener J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14147-14156Google Scholar). In vitro calibration of raw fluorescence values was performed using fura-2 (K+)5 salt dissolved in calibration buffers from Molecular Probes Inc. (Calcium Calibration Kit 1 with Mg2+). Values of R min andR max were 0.20 and 7.70. Cells were loaded with serotonin (5-HT) by incubation in culture medium containing 0.6 mm 5-HT and 0.6 mm 5-hydroxytryptophan. 5-HT is sequestered in large dense-core secretory granules by active transport, but it is excluded from the small synaptic vesicle-like structures that do not contain insulin (9Ekholm R. Ericson L.E. Lundquist I. Diabetologia. 1971; 7: 339-348Google Scholar). The release of 5-HT serves as a surrogate marker for insulin secretion (10Aspinwall C.A. Huang L. Lakey J.R. Kennedy R.T. Anal. Chem. 1999; 71: 5551-5556Google Scholar). Prolonged exposure of β-cells to high concentrations of 5-HT produces toxic effects (11Zawalich W.S. Tesz G.J. Zawalich K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37120-37123Google Scholar). Therefore, exposure to 5-HT was limited to 4–16 h. Carbon fiber electrodes for amperometric detection of secreted 5-HT were prepared as described previously (12Kang G. Holz G.G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 546: 175-189Google Scholar). A +650-mV potential was applied to a 10-μm diameter carbon fiber, the tip of which was placed adjacent to the cell of interest. The distance from the electrode tip to the cell was ∼1 μm. An HEKA EPC-9 patch clamp amplifier was used for detection of the amperometric current resulting from oxidation of 5-HT. The signal was filtered at 200 Hz, sampled at 1 kHz, and stored on a MacIntosh G3 computer running PULSE 8.31 software (HEKA, Lambrecht, Germany). The activity of CRE-Luc was assessed in lysates of INS-1 cells by use of a luciferase assay as described previously (13Skoglund G. Hussain M.A. Holz G.G. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1156-1164Google Scholar, 14Chepurny O.G. Holz G.G. Cell Tissue Res. 2002; 307: 191-201Google Scholar, 15Chepurny O.G. Hussain M.A. Holz G.G. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 2303-2313Google Scholar). After a 4-h exposure to test substances, cells were lysed and assayed for luciferase-catalyzed photoemissions using a luciferase assay kit (Tropix, Bedford, MA) and a luminometer allowing automated application of ATP and luciferin solutions (Model TR-717, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Experiments were carried out in triplicate. Statistical analyses were performed using the analysis of variance test combined with Fisher's Poisson least squares distribution test. INS-1 cells were plated in complete growth medium in 12-well plastic culture dishes. 3H-inositol (10 μCi/ml) was added to each well, and the cells were incubated for 48 h. The medium was then changed to serum-free RPMI 1640 containing 10 mm lithium chloride and the pharmacological agents to be tested. The incubation was continued for an additional 60 min at 37 °C. Cellular lipids and inositol phosphates were extracted for Dowex chromatography and quantification as described previously (16Koreh K. Monaco M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 88-91Google Scholar). 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP, 8-CPT-cAMP, and Rp-8-Br-cAMPS were obtained from BIOLOG Life Sci. Inst., Bremen, Germany. GLP-1, Ex-4, acetylcholine, forskolin, 8-Br-cAMP, H-89, KT 5720, and ryanodine were from Sigma. Wild type and dominant negative pSRα plasmids for transfection and the expression of recombinant mouse Epac2 were obtained from the laboratory of Dr. S. Seino (17Ozaki N. Shibasaki T. Kashima Y. Miki T. Takahashi K. Ueno H. Sunaga Y. Yano H. Matsuura Y. Iwanaga T. Takai Y. Seino S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 11: 805-811Google Scholar). Methodology was developed allowing phenotype selection of β-cells in primary cultures of dispersed islets bathed in SES containing 7.5 mmglucose. A −695-bp fragment of the rat insulin II gene promoter (RIP2) was fused to the coding sequence of EYFP (18Kang G. Chepurny O.G. Holz G.G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 536: 375-385Google Scholar) for initial expression of EYFP in INS-1 cells (Fig.1, A and B). RIP2-EYFP was then incorporated into an adenoviral vector, and expression of EYFP was conferred to human β-cells by adenovirus-mediated gene transfer using AdRIP2EYFP (Fig. 1,C and D). Confocal microscopy in combination with fluorescence immunocytochemistry demonstrated that expression of EYFP was restricted to the insulin-immunoreactive β-cells and not the glucagon-reactive α-cells in whole islets of Langerhans derived from rat (Fig. 2). Functional studies of small clusters of human islet cells demonstrated that the EYFP-positive β-cells exhibited an increase of [Ca2+]iwhen exposed to the insulin secretagogue glyburide (Fig.3).Figure 2β-Cell-specific expression of EYFP conferred by RIP2.

The cell labeled 1 (top panel) exhibited an increase of [Ca2+]i (bottom panel) in response to a 10-s application of 100 nm glyburide applied to the entire cluster of cells. This same cell contained EYFP (bottom panel inset; note that the boundary surrounding the cluster of cells is indicated by a white outline). The remaining two cells of the cluster did not contain EYFP and failed to respond to glyburide. Identical findings were obtained in a total of five separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The Epac-selective cAMP analog 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP was a highly effective stimulus for Ca2+ signaling in human β-cells. Human islet cells infected with AdRIP2EYFP were loaded with fura-2, and EYFP-positive β-cells were identified using the EYFP filter set. Next, the filter set was manually switched to a fura-2 filter set, thereby allowing ratiometric measurements of [Ca2+]i imaged using an intensified charge-coupled device camera. The responsiveness of an EYFP-positive β-cell was demonstrated by measuring the increase of [Ca2+]i that accompanied a 10-s application of 50 μm8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP delivered via a micropipette (Fig.4, A1 and A2). The phenotype of this cell was additionally confirmed by demonstrating its responsiveness to the insulin secretagogue glyburide (Fig. 4,A2). The increase of [Ca2+]imeasured in response to 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP was blocked by pretreatment of human β-cells with ryanodine (Fig.4 B). The increase of [Ca2+]imeasured during exposure of 5-HT-loaded human β-cells to 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP was associated with exocytosis, as measured by carbon fiber amperometry (Fig.5). The increase of [Ca2+]i (Fig. 5, A1) was time-locked to the appearance of amperometric current spikes resulting from the oxidation of released 5-HT (Fig. 5, A2). When viewed on an expanded time scale, the quantal nature of the individual secretory events was revealed (Fig. 5, A3 andA4). No secretory events were detected in the absence of an increase of [Ca2+]i. The action of 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP was also evaluated in the INS-1 insulin-secreting cell line (5Asfari M. Janjic D. Meda P. Li G. Halban P.A. Wollheim C.B. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 167-178Google Scholar). These cells exhibit Epac-mediated CICR appearing as a transient increase of [Ca2+]i (18Kang G. Chepurny O.G. Holz G.G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 536: 375-385Google Scholar). 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP was a stimulus for CICR in INS-1 cells (Fig.6 A), and the kinetics of the increase of [Ca2+]i matched closely that observed in human β-cells (cf. Fig. 4). The action of 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP was mimicked by forskolin (Fig.6 B) and by 8-Br-cAMP (Fig. 6 C). In some cells, the fast transient increase of [Ca2+]i was followed by a more slowly developing and sustained increase of [Ca2+]i (Fig. 6 D). Neither effect of 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP was blocked by the cAMP antagonist Rp-8-Br-cAMPS (Fig. 6 D and Fig.7 A). Rp-cAMPS is an inhibitor of both PKA and Epac, but it has a low affinity for Epac compared with 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP. 2H. Rehmann and J. Bos, unpublished findings.The action of 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP was dose-dependent over a concentration range of 10–100 μm (Fig. 7 A) and was not blocked by 10 μm of the PKA inhibitors H-89 or KT 5720 (Fig.7 A). However, the action of 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP was diminished by transfection of INS-1 cells with dominant negative pSRα Epac2 (Fig. 7 A). Dominant negative Epac2 does not bind cAMP because G114E and G422D amino acid substitutions have been introduced into the protein's two cAMP-binding domains (17Ozaki N. Shibasaki T. Kashima Y. Miki T. Takahashi K. Ueno H. Sunaga Y. Yano H. Matsuura Y. Iwanaga T. Takai Y. Seino S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 11: 805-811Google Scholar).Figure 7Pharmacological properties of 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP. A, a population study of INS-1 cells was performed and the percentage of cells exhibiting CICR in response to 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP was determined. The action of 100 μm 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP was dose-dependent (* indicates statistical significance < 0.001 relative to 10 μm) and was not blocked by H-89 (10 μm), KT 5720 (10 μm), or Rp-8-Br-cAMPS (300 μm). Transfection of INS-1 cells with dominant negative Epac2 blocked the action of 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP (100 μm), whereas transfection with wild type (WT) Epac2 did not (* indicates statistical significance < 0.001 relative to WT Epac). Transfected cells were identified by use of RIP2-EYFP as described previously (18Kang G. Chepurny O.G. Holz G.G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 536: 375-385Google Scholar).B, 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP failed to stimulate luciferase activity in INS-1 cells transfected with CRE-Luc. Application of the structurally related PKA activator 8-CPT-cAMP produced a dose-dependent stimulation of CRE-Luc, and the action of 8-CPT-cAMP was reduced by the PKA inhibitor H-89 (10 μm). (** indicates statistical significance < 0.005 relative to 30, 100, or 300 μm 8-CPT-cAMP in the absence of H-89). This experiment was repeated twice, and the effect of each concentration of test substance was evaluated in triplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To examine the specificity with which 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP differentiates between Epac and PKA, INS-1 cells were transfected with a plasmid in which expression of luciferase was placed under the control of multimerized cyclic AMP-response elements (CRE-Luc). This reporter is activated by cAMP via a PKA-signaling mechanism involving CREB (13Skoglund G. Hussain M.A. Holz G.G. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1156-1164Google Scholar, 14Chepurny O.G. Holz G.G. Cell Tissue Res. 2002; 307: 191-201Google Scholar, 15Chepurny O.G. Hussain M.A. Holz G.G. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 2303-2313Google Scholar). The activity of CRE-Luc was stimulated by 30–300 μm 8-CPT-cAMP (active at PKA and Epac), and was reduced by the PKA inhibitor H-89 (Fig. 7 B). However, 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP failed to stimulate CRE-Luc (Fig.7 B). Identical findings were obtained when evaluating the actions of 8-CPT-cAMP, H-89, and 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP in HEK 293 cells transfected with CRE-Luc (data not shown). These observations demonstrate that when tested in vitro at a concentration of 30–300 μm, 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP exhibits little or no efficacy as a stimulator of the cAMP-, PKA-, and CREB-signaling pathways in INS-1 cells. GLP-1 or the GLP-1 receptor agonist exendin-4 (Ex-4) mobilizes Ca2+ from ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+ stores in INS-1 cells (18Kang G. Chepurny O.G. Holz G.G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 536: 375-385Google Scholar). In the present study, we found that CICR in response to 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP was also blocked by ryanodine (Fig.8). However, it was recently reported that Epac mediates stimulatory actions of cAMP on inositol trisphosphate (IP3)-sensitive Ca2+ stores in HEK 293 cells (19Schmidt M. Evellin S. Weernink P.A. von Dorp F. Rehmann H. Lomasney J.W. Jakobs K.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 1020-1024Google Scholar, 20Evellin S. Nolte J. Tysack K. vom Dorp F. Thiel M. Weernink P.A. Jakobs K.H. Webb E.J. Lomasney J.W. Schmidt M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16805-16813Google Scholar). This action of cAMP is proposed to result from Epac-mediated activation of phospholipase C-epsilon (PLC-ε), with concomitant stimulation of IP3 production (19Schmidt M. Evellin S. Weernink P.A. von Dorp F. Rehmann H. Lomasney J.W. Jakobs K.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 1020-1024Google Scholar, 20Evellin S. Nolte J. Tysack K. vom Dorp F. Thiel M. Weernink P.A. Jakobs K.H. Webb E.J. Lomasney J.W. Schmidt M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16805-16813Google Scholar). Therefore, Ca2+ mobilized by 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP as a consequence of CICR in INS-1 cells might originate from Ca2+ stores regulated not only by ryanodine receptors (RYR) but also by inositol trisphosphate receptors (IP3-R). INS-1 cells express muscarinic cholinergic receptors, and acetylcholine is a stimulus for inositol phosphate (IP) production (Table I). However, a role for IP3-R in Epac-mediated signal transduction in INS-1 cells appears unlikely because no stimulation of IP production was observed in INS-1 cells exposed to 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP, GLP-1, or Ex-4 (Table I).Table I8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP fails to stimulate production of inositol phosphates in INS-1 cellsAdditionInositol phosphate accumulation (cpm/well)p valuenNone3144 ± 4608Acetylcholine (100 μm)5416 ± 456p< 0.000548-CPT-2-Me-cAMP (30 μm)2508 ± 120NS48-CPT-2-Me-cAMP (100 μm)3048 ± 636NS48-CPT-2-Me-cAMP (300 μm)3024 ± 368NS4Exendin-4 (100 nm)3324 ± 220NS4GLP-1 (100 nm)2656 ± 220NS4Inositol phosphate production in INS-1 cells was stimulated by acetylcholine but not 8-CPT-2-Me-cAMP, exendin-4, or GLP-1.

Open table in a new tab Inositol phosphate production in INS-1 cells was stimulated by acetylcholine but not 8-CPT-2-Me-cAMP, exendin-4, or GLP-1. Incorporation of tritiated inositol into total cellular phosphoinositides prior to stimulation was 7550 ± 1398 cpm per well. NS, not significant. Until now, no certain means by which to specifically activate Epac was available. Here we demonstrate that a newly developed Epac-selective cAMP analog (8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP) is a stimulator of CICR and exocytosis in human β-cells. 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP is also demonstrated to stimulate CICR in an insulin-secreting cell line (INS-1), and this effect is PKA-independent because it is not blocked by H-89, KT 5720, or Rp-8-Br-cAMPS. Overexpression of a dominant negative Epac2 abrogates CICR in response to 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP as expected because there exists in INS-1 cells an Epac2-signaling pathway critical to hormonal regulation of Ca2+ signaling (18Kang G. Chepurny O.G. Holz G.G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 536: 375-385Google Scholar). The specificity with which 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP differentiates between PKA and Epac is emphasized by its failure to reproduce the action of 8-CPT-cAMP in an assay of CRE-Luc activity that is diagnostic of cAMP/PKA/CREB signal transduction. Therefore, 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP is demonstrated to posses unique Epac-selective properties that should allow its wide spread use in assays of multiple cellular functions. One difference between the findings of the present study and those of our previous report (18Kang G. Chepurny O.G. Holz G.G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 536: 375-385Google Scholar) is that H-89 and Rp-8-Br-cAMPS fail to block the action of 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP, whereas both compounds exert inhibitory effects when examining the action of GLP-1 receptor agonist exendin-4 (18Kang G. Chepurny O.G. Holz G.G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 536: 375-385Google Scholar). These contrasting results are understandable if 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP acts exclusively via Epac2, whereas exendin-4 acts not only via Epac2 but also PKA. It is also noteworthy that in some INS-1 cells a sustained increase of [Ca2+]i is observed in response to 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP, and it is preceded by CICR (cf., Figs. 6 D and 8 B). This biphasic response to 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP is reminiscent of the action of GLP-1 in β-cells (8Holz G.G. Leech C.A. Heller R.S. Castonguay M. Habener J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14147-14156Google Scholar). GLP-1 is an inhibitor of ATP-sensitive K+ channels (K-ATP), and by doing so it produces β-cell depolarization, activation of Ca2+ influx, and a sustained increase of [Ca2+]i (21Holz G.G. Habener J.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 388-393Google Scholar, 22Holz G.G. Kuhtreiber W.M. Habener J.F. Nature. 1993; 361: 362-365Google Scholar). It will be of interest to ascertain if a similar inhibition of K-ATP is observed in response to 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP acting as an Epac-selective modulator of K+ channel function. In this regard, it is noteworthy that Epac contains not only Rap1 recognition motifs within its guanyl nucleotide exchange factor catalytic domain, but also additional protein-protein interaction motifs within its DEP domain where homologies to Disheveled, Egl-10, and Pleckstrin are found. A physical association of Epac and the SUR1 subunit of K-ATP has been reported on the basis of a yeast two-hybrid screen (17Ozaki N. Shibasaki T. Kashima Y. Miki T. Takahashi K. Ueno H. Sunaga Y. Yano H. Matsuura Y. Iwanaga T. Takai Y. Seino S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 11: 805-811Google Scholar), so it is reasonable to speculate that the targets of Epac action may also include cell surface K-ATP channels. Epac mediates stimulatory actions of cAMP on phospholipase C-ε in HEK 293 cells (19Schmidt M. Evellin S. Weernink P.A. von Dorp F. Rehmann H. Lomasney J.W. Jakobs K.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 1020-1024Google Scholar, 20Evellin S. Nolte J. Tysack K. vom Dorp F. Thiel M. Weernink P.A. Jakobs K.H. Webb E.J. Lomasney J.W. Schmidt M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16805-16813Google Scholar). The resultant increase of [IP3] serves as a stimulus for CICR mediated by the IP3-R. However, we find that the Ca2+mobilizing action of 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP is unlikely to be a consequence of Epac-mediated IP3 production. 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP fails to increase levels of inositol phosphates in INS-1 cells loaded with 3H-inositol. Instead, available evidence indicates an important role for RYR as targets of Epac action (8Holz G.G. Leech C.A. Heller R.S. Castonguay M. Habener J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14147-14156Google Scholar, 18Kang G. Chepurny O.G. Holz G.G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 536: 375-385Google Scholar, 23Islam M.S. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 1299-1309Google Scholar). Indeed, pretreatment of INS-1 cells with ryanodine blocks CICR in response to 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP. Furthermore, it was previously reported that treatment of INS-1 cells with the IP3-R inhibitor Xestospongin C fails to block CICR in response to forskolin (18Kang G. Chepurny O.G. Holz G.G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 536: 375-385Google Scholar). Since our methods of analysis were restricted to use of a dominant negative Epac2, no conclusion can yet be reached concerning what role Eapc1 may play in β-cell Ca2+ signaling. However, 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP is an activator of Epac1 (4Enserink J.M. Christensen A.E. de Rooij J. Triest M.V. Schwede F. Genieser H.G. Døskeland S.O. Blank J.L. Bos J.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 901-906Google Scholar), and in the present study it failed to stimulate inositol phosphate production. Although these findings argue against a role for the IP3 receptor as a target of Epac1 and Epac2 action in β-cells, additional studies are necessary to reach a firm conclusion. Previous studies of INS-1 cells demonstrated that cAMP-elevating agents mobilize Ca2+ from thapsigargin-sensitive Ca2+ stores (18Kang G. Chepurny O.G. Holz G.G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 536: 375-385Google Scholar). These Ca2+ stores are most likely located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where the SERCA Ca2+ ATPase targeted by thapsigargin is found. One possible effector that links Epac signaling to these Ca2+ stores is Rap1, a small molecular weight G protein previously reported to form direct protein-protein interactions with SERCA (24Lacabaratz-Porret C. Corvazier E. Kovacs T. Bobe R. Bredoux R. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 173-181Google Scholar). In addition, an Epac/Rap1 signaling complex in the ER might influence Ca2+ signaling by modulating RYR gating properties, possibly through direct interactions with the channel. Such an effect might synergize with PKA-mediated sensitization of RYR, thereby facilitating Ca2+ release from the ER (25Marx S.O. Reiken S. Hisamatsu Y. Jayaraman T. Burkhoff D. Rosemblit N. Marks A.R. Cell. 2000; 101: 365-376Google Scholar). In this regard, HEK 293 cells overexpressing the GLP-1-R exhibit ryanodine-sensitive CICR in response to GLP-1, and this action correlates with the ability of GLP-1 to stimulate cAMP production (26Gromada J. Rorsman P. Dissing S. Wulff B.S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 373: 182-186Google Scholar). Therefore, the targeting of RYR by GLP-1, whether direct or indirect, is a signaling mechanism not restricted to β-cells. Here we also demonstrate that 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP stimulates Ca2+-dependent exocytosis in human β-cells. Exocytosis is observed to be time-locked to the increase of [Ca2+]i generated by CICR, and indeed, no exocytosis is observed in the absence of CICR. It appears, therefore, that an increase of [Ca2+]i is a necessary and not simply permissive stimulus for initiation of exocytosis. Of course this conclusion does not preclude additional Epac-mediated signaling events important to secretion. For example, the interaction of Epac with Rim2, an insulin granule-associated protein, might play an important role in conferring stimulatory effects of cAMP on exocytosis in β-cells (17Ozaki N. Shibasaki T. Kashima Y. Miki T. Takahashi K. Ueno H. Sunaga Y. Yano H. Matsuura Y. Iwanaga T. Takai Y. Seino S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 11: 805-811Google Scholar, 27Kashima Y. Miki T. Shibasaki T.

Despite this caveat, it is clear that the mobilization of Ca2+ by cAMP is a highly significant feature of β-cell stimulus-secretion coupling. Indeed, we recently reported that CICR serves to amplify exocytosis in INS-1 cells (12Kang G. Holz G.G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 546: 175-189Google Scholar). The present findings are noteworthy because we demonstrate a functional coupling of Epac-mediated CICR to exocytosis in human β-cells. This coupling is revealed through the use of a newly developed Epac-selective cAMP analog. The findings are of medical importance because they shed light on the blood glucose-lowering properties of an insulinotropic hormone (GLP-1) currently under investigation for use in the treatment of type-2 diabetes mellitus (30Drucker D.J.

https://openalex.org/W2004803686,"We show that alpha and betaCaMKII are inversely regulated by activity in hippocampal neurons in culture: the alpha/beta ratio shifts toward alpha during increased activity and beta during decreased activity. The swing in ratio is approximately 5-fold and may help tune the CaMKII holoenzyme to changing intensities of Ca(2+) signaling. The regulation of CaMKII levels uses distinguishable pathways, one responsive to NMDA receptor blockade that controls alphaCaMKII alone, the other responsive to AMPA receptor blockade and involving betaCaMKII and possibly further downstream effects of betaCaMKII on alphaCaMKII. Overexpression of alphaCaMKII or betaCaMKII resulted in opposing effects on unitary synaptic strength as well as mEPSC frequency that could account in part for activity-dependent effects observed with chronic blockade of AMPA receptors. Regulation of CaMKII subunit composition may be important for both activity-dependent synaptic homeostasis and plasticity."

We now report the presence of tonic, spontaneous, and evoked currents in embryonic and neonatal CA1 neurons mediated primarily by the activation of GABAA receptors. These currents are mediated by a nonconventional release of transmitters, as they persist in the presence of calcium channel blockers or botulinium toxin and are observed in Munc18-1-deficient mice in which vesicular release is abolished. This paracrine communication is modulated by glutamate but not GABA transporters, which do not operate during this period of life. Thus, a Ca2+- and SNARE-independent release of transmitters underlies a paracrine mode of communication before synapse formation."

We have recently shown that M. tuberculosis binds to and infects DCs through ligation of the DC-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) and that M. tuberculosis mannose-capped lipoarabinomannan (ManLAM) inhibits binding of the bacilli to the lectin, suggesting that ManLAM might be a key DC-SIGN ligand.

Indeed, purified M. tuberculosis-derived ManLAM was found to inhibit the binding ofM. tuberculosis to human monocyte-derived DCs, as well as to recombinant HeLa-derived cells expressing DC-SIGN. LAM is a major component of the mycobacterial cell wall. It contains a carbohydrate backbone composed of d-mannan andd-arabinan (Fig.1). The mannan core is attached to an acylated mannosylphosphatidylinositol (MPI) anchor at its reducing end; the arabinan domain is capped with either mannose residues in so-called ManLAMs or with phosphoinositide motifs in so-called PILAMs (16Chatterjee D.

The caps of ManLAMs consist of mono-, α(1→2)-di-, and α(1→2)-tri-mannopyranosides, with dimannopyranosides being the most abundant motif (18Nigou J. Vercellone A. Puzo G. J. Mol.

These include various strains of M. tuberculosis,M. bovis BCG, the leprosy agentMycobacterium leprae, and the opportunistic species Mycobacterium avium (16Chatterjee D. Khoo K.H.

In addition to their structural role in organizing of the cell wall, LAMs are known to be potent inducers of various cytokines when in contact with mammalian phagocytic cells (24Nigou J. Gilleron M. Rojas M. Garcia L.F. Thurnher M. Puzo G. Microbes Infect. 2002; 4: 945-953Google Scholar).We have shown that the slow growing mycobacteria M. tuberculosis and M. bovis BCG, which express ManLAM, interact with human DCs through DC-SIGN and that purifiedM. tuberculosis-derived ManLAM inhibitsM. tuberculosis binding to recombinant HeLa-derived cells expressing DC-SIGN and to monocyte-derived DCs. The goal of the present report was to obtain a better understanding of the molecular determinants of the LAM molecule involved in binding to DC-SIGN. Using a DC-SIGN-expressing recombinant cell line as a readout, we first report that DC-SIGN binds poorly to the fast growing species M. smegmatis and that M. smegmatis-derived PILAM, which lacks mannose caps, exhibits a very limited ability to inhibit M. tuberculosis binding to the lectin. Using various chemically or enzymatically generated variants of the ManLAM molecule, we further demonstrate that both the acyl chains on the MPI anchor and the mannose-capping residues play a key role in the ManLAM-DC-SIGN ligation process. Moreover, we show that DC-SIGN does not bind to the PILAM- and AraLAM-containing species M. fortuitum and M. chelonae, respectively. Altogether, our findings provide evidences that DC-SIGN may discriminate between ManLAM-containing slow growers, such as M. tuberculosis, and nonpathogenic PILAM-containing fast growers, such as M. smegmatis, through a high affinity for mannose-capping residues on ManLAM.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONMycobacterial species can be divided into slow and fast growers. To gain a better understanding of the molecular basis of their ligation to DC-SIGN, we first compared the relative ability of the slow growing pathogenic species M. tuberculosis versus the fast growing saprophytic species M. smegmatis to bind to the lectin. A binding assay was performed on HeLa-derived cells expressing or not DC-SIGN (HeLa-DC and HeLa, respectively). As we reported previously,M. tuberculosis was found to bind to HeLa-DC ∼15 times more than to HeLa cells (Fig.2 A), and in a multiplicity of infection-dependent manner (data not shown). Conversely,M. smegmatis binding to HeLa-DC was found to be only ∼2 times more than to HeLa cells (Fig. 2 A). Our previous finding that M. tuberculosis ManLAM can inhibit M. tuberculosis binding to DC-SIGN suggests that the reduced ability of M. smegmatis to bind to HeLa-DC cells may be due to the inability of M. smegmatis PILAM to bind to the lectin. To test this hypothesis, we performed a M. tuberculosis binding assay on HeLa-DC cells that had been preincubated or not with LAM molecules from various mycobacterial species. As reported previously, yeast mannan and M. tuberculosis- as well as M. bovis BCG-derived ManLAMs were found to inhibit mycobacterial binding to HeLa-DC cells by as much as ∼90% (Fig. 2 B). By contrast, M. smegmatis-derived PILAM was found to inhibit poorly (∼25% inhibition) the binding of M. tuberculosisto HeLa-DC cells. Interestingly, PILAM was found able to fully inhibitM. smegmatis binding to HeLa-DC cells (data not shown). The fact that BCG-derived ManLAM inhibits M. tuberculosis binding to DC-SIGN as well as M. tuberculosis-derived ManLAM does is consistent with our previous result showing that M. bovis BCG binds to DC-SIGN to the same extent as M. tuberculosis and with the known structural similarity between ManLAMs from M. bovis BCG andM. tuberculosis (18Nigou J. Vercellone A. Puzo G. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 1353-1362Google Scholar).Figure 2DC-SIGN has high affinity for slowversus fast growing Mycobacteriumspecies. A, epithelial HeLa-derived cells expressing or not DC-SIGN (HeLa-DC and HeLa, respectively) were infected with M. smegmatis or M. tuberculosis H37Rv at a multiplicity of infection of 1 bacterium/cell. Bacterial binding was evaluated after 4 h at 4 °C by counting colony-forming units (CFUs). Data represent the means (±S.D.) of three separate experiments.B, cells were preincubated with 10 μg/ml yeast-derived mannan (MAN), M. tuberculosis H37Rv- orM. bovis BCG-derived ManLAM, M. smegmatis-derived PILAM, or saline (control, Ø) for 1 h at 4 °C and infected as described in A. Bacteria binding was measured as described in A. Data are expressed as percentages of binding relative to control values (100%, preincubation of HeLa-DC cells with saline), and the means (±S.D.) of three independent experiments are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Because DC-SIGN is a mannose-binding lectin and because PILAMs are devoid of mannose caps (Fig. 1), we next reasoned that the results described above might indicate that ManLAM capping residues may be the ManLAM subdomains preferentially recognized by the lectin. To test this hypothesis, we treated M. bovis BCG-derived ManLAM with α-exomannosidase to obtain ManLAM devoid of mannose caps (αManLAM). The reaction was assessed by CE-LIF analysis as previously described (18Nigou J. Vercellone A. Puzo G. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 1353-1362Google Scholar, 27Nigou J. Zelle-Rieser C. Gilleron M. Thurnher M. Puzo G. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 7477-7485Google Scholar). A typical electropherogram obtained for αManLAM is presented in Fig. 3 A. Peaks corresponding to mannooligosaccharide caps, i.e.mono-, α(1→2)-di-, and α(1→2)-tri-mannopyranosides, were almost undetectable. Quantification indicated that more than 95% of cap demannosylation was achieved. The ability of αManLAM to inhibitM. tuberculosis binding to DC-SIGN was evaluated in binding experiments. In contrast to native ManLAM, αManLAM failed to inhibit mycobacterial binding to the lectin (∼10% binding inhibition, Fig. 3 B). Similar results were obtained when cells were treated with M. tuberculosis-derived αManLAM prior to the binding assay (data not shown). These results indicate that mannooligosaccharide caps are critical structural features for ManLAM-mediated inhibition of M. tuberculosis binding to DC-SIGN.Figure 3Mannooligosaccharide caps and the acyl groups on the MPI anchor play a critical role in ManLAM binding to DC-SIGN.

ManLAM or αManLAM was submitted to mild acid hydrolysis (0.1 m HCl for 30 min at 110 °C) in the presence of mannoheptose as the internal standard. The liberated oligosaccharide was derivatized by APTS before CE-LIF analysis (18Nigou J. Vercellone A. Puzo G. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 1353-1362Google Scholar, 27Nigou J. Zelle-Rieser C. Gilleron M.

To this end, M. bovis BCG-derived dManLAM was prepared by alkali treatment. As shown on Fig. 3 B, dManLAM failed to inhibit M. tuberculosis binding to HeLa-DC cells, revealing that a native acylated MPI anchor is required for ManLAM-mediated inhibition of mycobacterial binding to DC-SIGN.Finally, we wished to know whether our finding was still valid in otherMycobacterium species for which the LAM structure was known. In agreement with what we reported above, the PILAM- and AraLAM-containing species M. fortuitum and M. chelonae were poorly recognized by DC-SIGN. Indeed, in a representative binding assay done in triplicate, M. fortuitum and M. chelonae bound to HeLa-DC cells 2.3 and 1.5 times more than to HeLa cells, respectively (data not shown). Interestingly, the ManLAM-containing slow grower M. avium was also found to bind poorly to DC-SIGN-expressing HeLa cells (∼1.7 times more than to HeLa cells; data not shown). This is not surprising because ManLAM from smooth colony-forming M. avium, which is the one used in our assay, has been reported to be capped mainly with single mannose residues instead of the di- and tri-mannopyranoside motifs found in M. tuberculosis- andM. bovis BCG-derived ManLAM (22Khoo K.H. Tang J.B. Chatterjee D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3863-3871Google Scholar). Because DC-SIGN does not bind to single mannose molecules but to more complex mannosylated structures (15Feinberg H. Mitchell D.A. Drickamer K. Weis W.I. Science. 2001; 294: 2163-2166Google Scholar), it is likely that such mono-mannosylated ManLAM is not recognized by the lectin. These results raise the possibility, currently under investigation, that DC-SIGN may recognize mycobacteria from the tuberculosis complex only.Altogether, our results demonstrate that the DC-SIGN-ManLAM interaction involves both the MPI anchor acyl chains and the mannose residues from caps of the ManLAM molecule. As established recently for the binding of ManLAM to the human surfactant pulmonary protein A C-type lectin (29Sidobre S. Nigou J. Puzo G. Riviere M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2415-2422Google Scholar,30Sidobre S. Puzo G. Riviere M. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 89-97Google Scholar), the MPI fatty acids are most likely involved in the supermolecular organization of the ManLAM molecules in aggregates, allowing macromolecular clustering in aqueous solution. Micelle formation probably results in a huge increase in ManLAM valence and increases ManLAM avidity to DC-SIGN. This is likely to explain the poor ability of dManLAM to inhibit M. tuberculosis binding to HeLa-DC cells but does not indicate whether LAM acyl chains, which are likely to be buried within the bacterial cell wall, can interact with the lectin in vivo. However, the latter definitely should be investigated, as our result is reminiscent of the involvement of the acyl chains of the M. tuberculosis 19-kDa lipoprotein antigen in binding to toll-like receptor-2 (TLR2) on phagocytic cells (31Brightbill H.D. Libraty D.H. Krutzik S.R. Yang R.B. Belisle J.T. Bleharski J.R. Maitland M. Norgard M.V. Plevy S.E. Smale S.T. Brennan P.J. Bloom B.R. Godowski P.J. Modlin R.L. Science. 1999; 285: 732-736Google Scholar).Selective recognition of the ManLAM mannose-capping residues by DC-SIGN on the surface of DCs is likely to have important consequences for both the pathogenesis and immunology of tuberculosis and other mycobacterial diseases. LAMs have various effects on phagocytic cells, including Mφs and DCs (24Nigou J. Gilleron M. Rojas M. Garcia L.F. Thurnher M. Puzo G. Microbes Infect. 2002; 4: 945-953Google Scholar). PILAMs induce the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-12, and IL-6, and the production of microbicidal radicals, such as NO 2−, in a much more potent way than do ManLAMs. In addition, ManLAMs, but not PILAMs, inhibit the Mφ activation effect of interferon-γ produced by effector T lymphocytes. PILAMs are thus now considered as proinflammatory molecules, whereas ManLAMs are viewed rather as anti-inflammatory components (17Vercellone A. Nigou J. Puzo G. Front Biosci. 1998; 3: e149-e163Google Scholar, 24Nigou J. Gilleron M. Rojas M. Garcia L.F. Thurnher M. Puzo G. Microbes Infect. 2002; 4: 945-953Google Scholar), which is consistent with the known ability of ManLAM-containing slow growing mycobacteria to resist immune defense mechanisms of their susceptible host (32Russell D.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 569-577Google Scholar). In particular, our recent results demonstrate that ManLAM inhibits the secretion of IL-12 by human DCs, a process that, like DC-SIGN ligation, requires both the MPI anchor acyl chains and the mannose caps (27Nigou J. Zelle-Rieser C. Gilleron M. Thurnher M. Puzo G. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 7477-7485Google Scholar). In this previous study (27Nigou J. Zelle-Rieser C. Gilleron M. Thurnher M. Puzo G. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 7477-7485Google Scholar), based on experiments using monoclonal antibodies, we suggested that ManLAM was acting through ligation of the mannose receptor (MR). Although MR is also involved in LAM mannose caps recognition (33Schlesinger L.S. Hull S.R. Kaufman T.M. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 4070-4079Google Scholar), one cannot rule out the possibility that ManLAM could act also through the ligation of DC-SIGN, which is currently under investigation. Indeed, DC-SIGN ligation by ManLAM, either attached to the bacilli or released in the milieu through exocytosis (34Russell D.G. Mwandumba H.C. Rhoades E.E. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 421-426Google Scholar), is likely to induce major signaling events, possibly including cell deactivation and/or secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as transforming growth factor-β or IL-10 (35Figdor C.G. van Kooyk Y. Adema G.J. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 77-84Google Scholar). Interestingly, PILAMs but not ManLAMs can activate cells in a TLR2-dependent manner (36Means T.K. Wang S. Lien E. Yoshimura A. Golenbock D.T. Fenton M.J. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 3920-3927Google Scholar). It will be of interest to study the cross-talk between phagocytic cell surface lectins, such as MR and DC-SIGN, and TLRs in response to mycobacterial ligands, including LAMs from various mycobacterial species.From an evolutionary perspective, it is interesting that DC-SIGN can discriminate between fast growing saprophytic and slow growing virulent or potentially virulent mycobacteria. Until recently, it was proposed that mannose capping of the LAM molecules was a unique feature of virulent mycobacteria. This is unlikely to be the case because the attenuated species M. bovis BCG also contains mannose-capped LAM (21Khoo K.H. Dell A. Morris H.R. Brennan P.J. Chatterjee D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12380-12389Google Scholar). Even if not virulent stricto sensu, M. bovis BCG can be pathogenic under certain conditions, especially in children and immunocompromised patients, in whom it may cause a variety of effects ranging from local adenitis to disseminated disease (37Lotte A. Wasz-Hockert O. Poisson N. Dumitrescu N. Verron M. Bull. Int. Union Tuberc. 1980; 55: 58-67Google Scholar). Moreover, M. bovis BCG is derived from virulentM. bovis, which shares a common ancestor with M. tuberculosis (38Brosch R. Gordon S.V. Marmiesse M. Brodin P. Buchrieser C. Eiglmeier K. Garnier T. Gutierrez C. Hewinson G. Kremer K. Parsons L.M. Pym A.S. Samper S. van Soolingen D. Cole S.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3684-3689Google Scholar). One cannot exclude that mannose capping of the ManLAM molecule is a feature of virulent mycobacteria that has been conserved during the recent evolution of M. bovis BCG fromM. bovis. In this context, DC-SIGN could be viewed as a pattern recognition receptor (39Janeway Jr., C.A. Medzhitov R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 197-216Google Scholar) that has evolved to recognize potentially harmful mycobacteria through their specific surface glycosylated moieties. In parallel, mycobacteria could have evolved mechanisms (LAM capping) to resist host immunity (deactivation of the inflammatory response) in contrast with their fast growing, soil-living, harmless ancestors.

https://openalex.org/W2111549347,"The North Atlantic is believed to represent the largest ocean sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide in the Northern Hemisphere, yet little is known about its temporal variability. We report an 18-year time series of upper-ocean inorganic carbon observations from the northwestern subtropical North Atlantic near Bermuda that indicates substantial variability in this sink. We deduce that the carbon variability at this site is largely driven by variations in winter mixed-layer depths and by sea surface temperature anomalies. Because these variations tend to occur in a basinwide coordinated pattern associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation, it is plausible that the entire North Atlantic Ocean may vary in concert, resulting in a variability of the strength of the North Atlantic carbon sink of about +/-0.3 petagrams of carbon per year (1 petagram = 10(15) grams) or nearly +/-50%. This extrapolation is supported by basin-wide estimates from atmospheric carbon dioxide inversions."

A genetic screen for negative regulators of olfaction uncovered mutations in the cGMP-dependent protein kinase EGL-4 that disrupt olfactory adaptation in C. elegans. G protein-coupled olfactory receptors within the AWC olfactory neuron signal through cGMP and a cGMP-gated channel. The cGMP-dependent kinase functions in AWC neurons during odor exposure to direct adaptation to AWC-sensed odors, suggesting that adaptation is a cell intrinsic process initiated by cGMP. A predicted phosphorylation site on the beta subunit of the cGMP-gated channel is required for adaptation after short odor exposure, suggesting that phosphorylation of signaling molecules generates adaptation at early time points. A predicted nuclear localization signal within EGL-4 is required for adaptation after longer odor exposure, suggesting that nuclear translocation of EGL-4 triggers late forms of adaptation."

Here we demonstrate that the inhibitory coreceptor CD22 down-modulates signaling through IgM-BCR and IgD-BCR, but not that through IgG-BCR, because of the IgG cytoplasmic tail, which prevents CD22 phosphorylation. These results suggest that the cytoplasmic tail of IgG specifically enhances IgG-BCR signaling by preventing CD22-mediated signal inhibition. Enhanced signaling through IgG-BCR may be involved in efficient IgG production, which is crucial for immunity to pathogens."

The IL-1 receptor belongs to the IL-1R/TLR (Toll-like receptor) superfamily. Human TLRs have recently emerged as key components in the generation of immune and inflammatory responses because of their ability to recognize pathogen-associated molecules (5Akira S. Takeda K. Kaisho T. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 675-680Google Scholar). The signaling pathway downstream of mammalian IL-1R/TLR is evolutionally conserved with that initiated by theDrosophila Toll protein (5Akira S. Takeda K. Kaisho T. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 675-680Google Scholar, 6Wasserman S.A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 497-502Google Scholar). Drosophila Toll controls dorsoventral axis formation in embryogenesis and has a role in the anti-fungal immune response in the adult fly (6Wasserman S.A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 497-502Google Scholar). Upon IL-1 stimulation, the adaptor molecules MyD88 and Tollip are recruited to the IL-1 receptor complex, which then recruits the serine-threonine kinases IRAK4 and IRAK. IRAK is hyperphosphorylated, mediating the recruitment of TRAF6 to the receptor complex (7Muzio M. Ni J. Feng P. Dixit V.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1612-1615Google Scholar, 8Wesche H. Korherr C.

IRAK-TRAF6 then leaves the receptor complex to interact with pre-associated TAK1, TAB1, and TAB2 on the membrane. TAK1 and TAB2 are phosphorylated on the membrane, which facilitates the formation and translocation of the TRAF6-TAK1-TAB1-TAB2 complex from the membrane to the cytosol. TAK1 is subsequently activated in the cytosol, leading to the activation of IκB kinase (IKK). Activated IKK causes the activation of NFκB through the phosphorylation and degradation of IκBs, which sequester NFκB prior to activation. Activation of TAK1 also results in the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase. Drosophila Toll is activated by the endogenous ligand Spaetzle, leading to the activation of Dif (Rel protein) through the degradation of Cactus, the Drosophila homologue of the mammalian IκBs, which sequester Dif prior to activation. Toll signals through the adapter molecule Tube and the serine-threonine kinase Pelle (13Shelton C.A. Wasserman S.A. Cell. 1993; 72: 515-525Google Scholar). Although no mammalian counterpart has been found for Tube, Pelle is highly homologous to IRAK4 and IRAK (7Muzio M. Ni J. Feng P. Dixit V.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1612-1615Google Scholar, 8Wesche H.

DrosophilaTRAF (dTRAF) has also been identified and shown to interact with Pelle (14Silverman N. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2321-2342Google Scholar). Therefore, the Toll-Pelle-dTRAF-Cactus-Dif cascade is quite analogous to the mammalian IL-1R/TLR-IRAK4/IRAK-TRAF6-IκB-NFκB pathway (14Silverman N. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2321-2342Google Scholar). However, the downstream signaling events from Pelle-dTRAF to Cactus are not clear. When Pelle was used as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screening, a novel Pelle-interacting protein called Pellino was identified (15Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Google Scholar). Pellino was shown to only interact with the catalytically active Pelle but not with a kinase-dead Pelle mutant, suggesting that Pellino may play an important role in facilitating the function of Pelle. In this study, we report the identification of mammalian Pellino (termed Pellino 1) and its role in IL-1- mediated signaling.

The vector pSUPER was obtained from Dr. Reuven Agami's group (Center for Biomedical Genetics, Leiden, The Netherlands). Pellino 1-pSUPER was constructed by cloning primers derived from Pellino 1 (47–66 bp) according to the methods described by Brummelkamp et al. (20Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Google Scholar). For stable transfections, 2 × 105 cells were seeded onto a 10-cm plate and cotransfected the following day by the calcium phosphate method with 10 μg of each expression vector and 1 μg of pBabePuro. After 48 h, the cells were selected with 1 μg/ml puromycin until clones appeared. 6 × 105 cells were seeded onto each 15-cm plate and transfected the following day by the calcium phosphate method with 15 μg of FLAG-tagged Pellino 1. After 48 h, cells untreated or treated with 100 units/ml of IL-1 were lysed in a Triton-containing lysis buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 12.5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaF, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm EGTA, 20 μm aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cell extracts were incubated with 1 μg of antibody or preimmune serum (negative control) for 2 h, followed by a 2-h incubation with 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (pre-washed and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline at a 1:1 ratio). After incubation, the beads were washed four times with lysis buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore), and analyzed by immunoblotting. 2 × 105 cells were transfected by the same procedure as described above with 1 μg of pE-selectin-luc, 1 μg of pSV2-β-gal, and 100 ng of each expression construct. After 48 h, the cells were split onto two 35-mm plates and stimulated with IL-1 the next day for 4 h before harvest. Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were determined by using the luciferase assay system and chemiluminescent reagents fromPromega (Madison, WI). An NFκB binding site (5′-GAGCAGAGGGAAATTCCGTAACTT-3′) from the IP-10 gene was used as a probe (21Majumder S. Zhou L.Z. Chaturvedi P. Babcock G. Aras S. Ransohoff R.M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 54: 169-180Google Scholar). Complementary oligonucleotides, end-labeled with polynucleotide kinase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and γ-32P-labeled ATP, were annealed by slow cooling. Approximately 20,000 cpm of probe were used per assay (22Kessler D.S. Veals S.A. Fu X.Y. Levy D.E. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1753-1765Google Scholar). Whole cell extracts were used for the assay. The binding reaction was carried out at 4 °C for 20 min in a total volume of 20 μl containing 20 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.0, 10 mm KCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.25 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 10% glycerol. Human Pellino 1 cDNA, cloned from a human dermal fibroblast cDNA library, encodes an open reading frame of 418 amino acid residues (accession number NP_065702, Fig.1 a). To identify functionally important regions of Pellino 1, the mammalian Pellino 1 was aligned with those from other species (Fig. 1). There is a surprising degree of similarity between the human Pellino 1 sequence and the homologous protein from Caenorhabditis elegans, which share 44% amino acid identity and 53% similarity. The C-terminal portion of Pellino 1 contains two invariant Cys-Gly-His triplets, two invariant Cys-Pro-X-Cys motifs (where X is a hydrophobic residue), and a conserved Cys-Pro-Val motif (Fig 1 a), reminiscent of the structure of the C3HC4 Ring finger subfamily of zinc finger domains (23Rich T. Allen R.L. Lucas A.M. Stewart A. Trowsdale J. Immunogenetics. 2000; 52: 145-149Google Scholar), which mediate diverse protein-protein interactions of tumor suppressors, protooncogenes, and signaling molecules such as TRAFs. Pellino 1 is ubiquitously expressed; it is expressed highly in peripheral blood leukocytes, moderately in placenta, lung, liver, kidney, spleen, thymus, skeletal muscle, and brain, and at a low level in small intestine, colon and heart (Fig. 1 b). We examined whether mammalian Pellino 1 interacts with IRAK and IRAK4, which are the mammalian counterparts of Pelle (7Muzio M. Ni J. Feng P. Dixit V.M.

Chem. 1999; 274: 19403-19410Google Scholar). Because IRAK and IRAK4 are essential signaling components in the IL-1 pathway, the interaction of Pellino 1 with IRAK and IRAK4 was studied upon IL-1 stimulation. Cell extracts prepared from HEK293 cells transfected with FLAG-tagged Pellino 1, either untreated or stimulated with IL-1, and immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2 antibody followed by Western immunoblotting using antibodies against IRAK and IRAK4. Interestingly, Pellino 1 indeed forms an IL-1-dependent signaling complex with the endogenous IRAK and IRAK4, strongly suggesting that it plays a role in IL-1-mediated signaling (Fig.2 a). We used small interfering RNA (siRNA), a new gene knock-down technology, to investigate the functional role of Pellino 1 in IL-1-mediated signaling pathways. Recently, a mammalian expression vector was developed that directs the synthesis of siRNA-like transcripts (pSUPER, suppression of endogenous RNA) (20Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Google Scholar). Pellino 1-pSUPER has been generated and stably transfected into HEK293 cells. Northern analysis showed that 27% of the clones (clones 1, 3, 12, 16, and 18) transfected with Pellino 1-pSUPER had a 90% reduction of Pellino 1 mRNA (Fig. 3 a), whereas the clones transfected with vector showed the same levels of Pellino 1 mRNA (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 3 b, IL-1 induced much weaker NFκB activation in C-12 and C-16 (in which Pellino 1 expression is knocked down; Fig. 3 a) than in C-9 (a clone from the same transfection in which Pellino 1 expression is not altered, Fig. 3 a), strongly suggesting that Pellino 1 is required for IL-1-mediated NFκB activation. The same expression levels of NFκB were shown in these clones by immunoblotting with antibodies against p65 and p50 (Fig. 3 b). On the other hand, the reduced expression of Pellino 1 had no effect on tumor necrosis factor-induced NFκB activation, indicating that Pellino 1 is specifically required for IL-1-dependent signaling. We also examined the effect of reduced Pellino 1 expression on IL-1-induced IL-8 gene expression, which was greatly reduced in C-12 and C-16 as compared with C-9 (Fig. 3 c), confirming that Pellino 1 is indeed required for this IL-1-mediated signaling pathway. Previous biochemical and genetic studies are consistent with a model for IL-1-mediated signaling (12Jiang Z. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Qian Y. Matsumoto K. Li X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7158-7167Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 c). To address the molecular mechanism by which Pellino 1 functions in IL-1 signaling, we investigated whether Pellino 1 interacts with IRAK and IRAK4 in the receptor complex (Complex I) or the TAK1-containing Complex II. Cell extracts prepared from HEK293 cells transfected with FLAG-tagged Pellino 1, either untreated or stimulated with IL-1, were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2 (Fig.2, a and b), anti-TRAF6 (Fig. 2 b), and anti-TAK1 (data not shown) and anti-TAB2 (data not shown)antibodies followed by immunoblotting with antibodies against IRAK, TRAF6, IL-1 receptor, TAK1, and TAB2. As shown previously (12Jiang Z. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Qian Y. Matsumoto K. Li X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7158-7167Google Scholar), TRAF6 is present both in the receptor complex (interacting with IL-1R and IRAK, Fig. 2, b and c) and the TAK1 complex (interacting with TAK1 and TAB2, Fig. 2, b andc). However, whereas Pellino 1 formed a complex with IRAK (Fig. 2, a and b), IRAK4 (Fig. 2 a), and TRAF6 (Fig. 2, a and b), it co-immunoprecipitated with neither the IL-1 receptor (Fig.2 b) nor the TAK1 complex (TAK1 and TAB2; Fig. 2 b, and data not shown) upon IL-1 stimulation, suggesting that the IL-1-induced Pellino 1-IRAK4-IRAK-TRAF6 is likely to exist as an intermediate between the receptor complex (Complex I) and the TAK1-containing complex (Complex II) (Fig. 2,a–c). Because most of the signaling components in the IL-1-mediated pathway are able to constitutively activate NFκB upon overexpression, Pellino 1 was examined for this activity. Pellino 1 in a mammalian expression vector was co-transfected with NFκB-dependent E-selectin-luc into HEK293 cells followed by luciferase reporter assay. Pellino 1 can activate the E-selectin promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.4 a). We have previously taken a genetic approach to studying IL-1-dependent signaling pathways through random mutagenesis, generating IL-1-unresponsive cell lines lacking specific components of the pathways. Mutant cell line I1A lacks both the IRAK protein and mRNA and is defective in IL-1-induced NFκB and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase activation (18Li X. Commane M. Jiang Z. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4461-4465Google Scholar, 18Li X. Commane M. Jiang Z. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4461-4465Google Scholar, 25Li X. Commane M. Burns C. Vithalani K. Cao Z. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4643-4652Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4 a, whereas MyD88-mediated NFκB activation is completely abolished in IRAK deficient I1A cells, Pellino 1-mediated NFκB activation is intact in these cells, indicating that Pellino 1 functions downstream of IRAK. On the other hand, Pellino 1-induced NFκB activation was inhibited by a dominant negative, kinase-inactive TAK1 mutant (TAK1 DN), indicating that Pellino1 must function upstream of TAK1 (Fig. 4 b). In support of this conclusion, TAK1 can still activate NFκB in C-12, where Pellino 1 expression is greatly knocked down by RNA interference (Fig. 4 c). Taken together, the above results support the hypothesis that the Pellino 1-IRAK-IRAK4-TRAF6 signaling complex functions between the receptor complex (Complex I) and the TAK1 complex (Complex II). One possible function for Pellino 1 is linking TRAF6 to IRAK in IL-1 signaling. However, several lines of evidence suggest that Pellino 1 is unlikely to be involved in the interaction between IRAK and TRAF6. First, several TRAF6 binding sites have been identified in both human and murine IRAK, and mutations in these sites abolish the ability of IRAK to activate NFκB, suggesting that TRAF6 is likely to interact with IRAK directly through these sites (26Ye H. Arron J.R. Lamothe B. Cirilli M. Kobayashi T. Shevde N.K. Segal D. Dzivenu O.K. Vologodskaia M. Yim M. Du K. Singh S. Pike J.W. Darnay B.G. Choi Y. Wu H. Nature. 2002; 418: 443-447Google Scholar). Secondly, although our previous results have clearly shown that TRAF6 is recruited to the IL-1 receptor through its interaction with IRAK upon IL-1 stimulation (Fig.2, b and c) (12Jiang Z. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Qian Y. Matsumoto K. Li X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7158-7167Google Scholar), Pellino 1 was not detected in the IL-1-induced receptor complex (IL-1R-IRAK-TRAF6, Complex I; Fig. 2,b and c). Therefore, it is unlikely that Pellino 1 is responsible for the IL-1-induced interaction between IRAK and TRAF6. Previous studies have shown that the release of phosphorylated IRAK from the receptor is essential for mediating downstream signaling events in response to IL-1 (27Kobayashi K. Hernandez L.D. Galan J.E. Janeway Jr., C.A. Medzhitov R. Flavell R.A. Cell. 2002; 110: 191-202Google Scholar). However, it is unclear how the phosphorylated IRAK is released from the receptor. The fact that Pellino 1 forms a complex with the phosphorylated IRAK but not with the IL-1 receptor upon IL-1 stimulation (Fig. 2, a andb) suggests that Pellino 1 may play an important role in facilitating the release of phosphorylated IRAK from the receptor. It is important to note that Pellino 1 does interact with TRAF6 upon IL-1 stimulation, whereas it does not interact with TAK1, suggesting that Pellino 1 probably functions downstream of TRAF6 and upstream of TAK1. In support of this, a dominant negative mutant of TAK1 inhibits Pellino 1-mediated NFκB activation (Fig. 4 b). The fact that Pellino 1 can activate NFκB in IRAK-deficient cells (I1A) suggests that Pellino 1 may have a direct impact on the activation of TAK1. As a matter of fact, TAK1 is activated in I1A cells transfected with Pellino 1 (data not shown). It is quite possible that Pellino 1 has a transient interaction with the TAK1 complex, which could not be detected by the co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Fig. 2 c). We have previously proposed a model for the IL-1 pathway (12Jiang Z. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Qian Y. Matsumoto K. Li X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7158-7167Google Scholar). Taking the above findings of Pellino 1 into consideration, we now propose a modified model (Fig. 2 c). Upon IL-1 stimulation, adapter molecules MyD88 and Tollip are first recruited to the IL-1 receptor, which in turn recruits IRAK4, IRAK, and TRAF6, resulting in the formation of the receptor complex (Complex 1). During the formation of Complex I, IRAK4 is activated, leading to the hyperphosphorylation of IRAK, which creates an interface for the interaction of Pellino 1 with the IRAK4-IRAK-TRAF6 complex. The formation of Pellino 1-IRAK4-IRAK-TRAF6 causes conformational changes in the receptor complex (Complex I), which results in quick release of this intermediate complex (Pellino 1-IRAK4-IRAK-TRAF6) from the receptor. Through an unknown mechanism, the intermediate complex Pellino 1-IRAK4-IRAK-TRAF6 interacts with the membrane-bound pre-associated TAK1-TAB1-TAB2, resulting in the formation of Complex II (TAK1 complex, IRAK-TRAF6-TAK1-TAB1-TAB2). TRAF6-TAK1-TAB1-TAB2 (Complex III) is then translocated from the membrane to the cytosol where TAK1 is activated, eventually resulting in the activation of NFκB. Although this study has shown the critical role of Pellino 1 in IL-1-mediated signaling, it was recently reported that a related protein, Pellino 2, modulates IL-1 and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) signaling (28Yu K.Y. Kwon H.J. Norman D.A. Vig E. Goebl M.G. Harrington M.A. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 4075-4078Google Scholar). At present, the relationship between Pellino 1 and Pellino 2 and their specific functions in IL-1 signaling are still unclear. One possibility is that each Pellino has its specific interaction with IRAK and/or IRAK4. The elucidation of precise functions of Pellino proteins in IL-1/TLR-mediated signaling will be an exciting and important research area in the future. We thank Dr. Hoger Wesche for the IRAK4 antibodies and Drs. Jun Ninomiya-Tsuji and Kunihiro Matsumoto for dominant negative mutant TAK1 and antibodies against TAK1 and TAB2."
https://openalex.org/W2061543226,"The low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) is a typical example of a multidomain protein, for which in vivo folding is assumed to occur vectorially from the amino terminus to the carboxyl terminus. Using a pulse-chase approach in intact cells, we found instead that newly synthesized LDL-R molecules folded by way of “collapsed” intermediates that contained non-native disulfide bonds between distant cysteines. The most amino-terminal domain acquired its native conformation late in folding instead of during synthesis. Thus, productive LDL-R folding in a cell is not vectorial but is mostly posttranslational, and involves transient long-range non-native disulfide bonds that are isomerized into native short-range cysteine pairs."

One example of such an interaction is the influence of proprioceptive sensory axons on the differentiation of muscle spindles. We have monitored the expression of three transcription factors, Egr3, Pea3, and Erm, that delineate early muscle spindle development in an assay of muscle spindle-inducing signals. We provide genetic evidence that Neuregulin1 (Nrg1) is required for proprioceptive afferent-evoked induction of muscle spindle differentiation in the mouse. Ig-Nrg1 isoforms are preferentially expressed by proprioceptive sensory neurons and are sufficient to induce muscle spindle differentiation in vivo, whereas CRD-Nrg1 isoforms are broadly expressed in sensory and motor neurons but are not required for muscle spindle induction."

Classical antimitotics (colchicine and vinblastine) bind to tubulin and prevent the formation of microtubules (5Borisy G.G. Taylor E.W. J. Cell Biol. 1967; 34: 525-533Google Scholar, 6Borisy G.G.

The labeled amino acid residues are in agreement with the 3.5-Å resolution electron crystallographic structure of tubulin in Taxol-stabilized zinc-induced two-dimensional crystals (23Löwe J. Li H.

Tubulin zinc sheets, whose assembly is not GTP-dependent (28Melki R. Carlier M.F. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3405-3413Google Scholar), consist of protofilaments similar to those that form the microtubules although in an antiparallel array. The docking of these protofilaments into electron microscopy density maps of Taxol-containing 14 and 15 protofilament microtubules (29Sosa H. Dias D.P. Hoenger A. Whittaker M. Wilson-Kubalek E.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8000-8008Google Scholar) results in an atomic model of microtubules in which the binding site of Taxol is located on the microtubule inner surface (30Meurer-Grob P.

Such luminal location will in principle make the binding site difficult to access for Taxol site ligands in assembled microtubules. However, it had been shown previously that Taxol modifies the flexibility of microtubules in a few seconds (32Dye R.B. Fink S.P. Williams R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6847-6850Google Scholar) and that the reversible binding of Taxol and its side chain analog docetaxel to an accessible site of microtubules changes the number of their protofilaments within a time range of 1 min (33Dı́az J.F. Valpuesta J.M. Chacón P. Diakun G. Andreu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33803-33810Google Scholar). The binding site of Taxol is easily accessible for two fluorescent derivatives of Taxol, Flutax-1 and Flutax-2 (34Evangelio J.A. Abal M. Barasoain I. Souto A.A. Acuña A.U. Amat-Guerri F. Andreu J.M.

These probes easily bind to and dissociate from native cytoplasmic and spindle microtubules and centrosomes and are able to induce cell death (34Evangelio J.A. Abal M. Barasoain I. Souto A.A.

Chem. 2000; 275: 26265-26276Google Scholar) as shown in Equation 1,site+Flutax⇌k−1k+1site−Flutax⇌k−2k+2site−Flutax*Eq. 1 The first step comprises the fast binding of the ligand with micromolar affinity. This reaction does not affect the mobility of the fluorescent group (either fluorescein or difluorofluorescein), and because it is blocked by docetaxel it seems to be contributed to by the binding of the Taxol moiety itself. The kinetic binding constantsk +1 are of the order of 106m−1 s−1 at 37 °C (35Dı́az J.F. Strobe R. Engelborghs Y. Souto A.A. Andreu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26265-26276Google Scholar) indicating binding to an exposed binding site, in contrast with the current microtubule model. Subsequent to the bimolecular step, there is a monomolecular reaction that involves a rearrangement in the system resulting in the immobilization of the fluorescent group. This step probably implies a weak binding of the fluorescein moiety to the microtubules (35Dı́az J.F. Strobe R. Engelborghs Y. Souto A.A. Andreu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26265-26276Google Scholar). The purpose of this study was to definitely establish the accessibility of the binding site of Taxol in microtubules. Therefore, the kinetics of Taxol association and dissociation have been measured in order to discard any possible enhancement of the association rates by the fluorescent side chain of the analogs. Thus, these fluorescent derivatives of Taxol were used to learn about the mechanisms that allow such accessibility by investigating the effects of the solution variables and possible perturbants on the binding kinetics, such as the presence or absence of MAPS and the C-terminal acidic segment of tubulin. The binding rates of fluorescent taxoids to the Taxol site in native microtubule cytoskeletons have been measured as well. Finally, several hypotheses have been analyzed to potentially reconcile the location of the binding site of Taxol in the lumen of model microtubules with fast binding kinetics. Purified calf brain tubulin and chemicals were as described (12Dı́az J.F. Andreu J.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2747-2755Google Scholar). For glycerol-induced assembly, tubulin was directly equilibrated in buffer: 10 mmphosphate, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm GTP, 3.4m glycerol, pH 6.8. All tubulin samples were clarified by centrifugation at 50,000 rpm, 4 °C, for 10 min using TL100.2 or TL100.4 rotors in Beckman Optima TLX centrifuges. After centrifugation, 6 mm MgCl2 and up to 1 mm GTP were added to the solution, giving a final pH 6.5. Microtubular protein, containing tubulin and MAPs, was prepared as described (37De Pereda J.M. Wallin M. Billger M. Andreu J.M. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1995; 30: 153-163Google Scholar) in 100 mm Mes, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmMgSO4, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mmGTP, pH 6.5. MAPs were prepared from microtubular protein as described (38Sloboda R.D. Rosenbaum J.L. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 409-416Google Scholar). hTau40, the longest isoform of microtubule-associated protein Tau (39Goedert M. Spillantini M.G. Potier M.C. Ulrich J. Crowther R.A. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 393-399Google Scholar), was a gift from Dr. Vincent Peyrot and François Devred (University of Marseille, France). It was dissolved in 10 mm phosphate, pH 6.5, buffer, and its concentration was determined spectrophotometrically in 6 m guanidinium chloride (employing a practical extinction coefficient of 6500m−1 cm−1 at 280 nm, computed using the ProtParam tool at www.expasy.ch). The activity of both MAPS and Tau was confirmed by means of a cosedimentation assay with cross-linked microtubules. Docetaxel (Taxotere®) was kindly provided by Rhône-Poulenc Rorer (92165 Antony, France). Flutax-1 (7-O-[N–(4′-fluoresceincarbonyl)-l-alanyl]-Taxol) and Flutax-2 (7-O-[N–(4′-2,7-difluoro-fluoresceincarbonyl)-l-alanyl]-Taxol) were synthesized as described (40Souto A.A. Acuña A.U. Andreu J.M. Barasoain I. Abal M. Amat-Guerri F. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1995; 34: 2710-2712Google Scholar). The diffusion coefficients of the taxoids were measured at 20 °C in 10 mm phosphate, pH 6.5, buffer using a synthetic boundary cell in an Optima XL-A (Beckman Instruments) analytical ultracentrifuge as described (41$$Google Scholar) at a speed of 15,000 rpm and wavelength of 230 (Taxol and docetaxel) or 495 nm (Flutax-1 and Flutax-2). The data were analyzed using the program VELGAMMA (42Muramatsu N. Minton A.P. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 168: 345-351Google Scholar). The diffusion coefficients in GAB (glycerol assembly buffer, 3.4 m glycerol, 10 mm sodium phosphate, 1 mm EGTA, 6 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm GTP, pH 6.5) at 37 °C were calculated from the values in phosphate buffer using the viscosity of a 30% solution of glycerol in water at 37 °C (1.55 centipoise (43Sheely M.L. Ind. Eng. Chem. 1932; 24: 1060-1064Google Scholar)). Solutions of 50 μm tubulin in GAB were assembled at 37 °C for 30 min, and 20 mm glutaraldehyde was added to the solution, which was kept at 37 °C for another 10 min. The remains of the cross-linking agent were quenched by adding 60 mmNaBH4 (Fluka), and the solution was dialyzed overnight using Slide-A-Lyzer 10K dialysis cassettes (Pierce) against the desired buffer and drop-frozen in liquid nitrogen (35Dı́az J.F. Strobe R. Engelborghs Y. Souto A.A. Andreu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26265-26276Google Scholar, 44Andreu J.M. Barasoain I. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11975-11984Google Scholar). After this treatment 90% of the tubulin was found to have incorporated into the microtubules, and 100% of the assembled tubulin dimers were found to bind taxoids immediately after dialysis (as measured by a sedimentation assay (35Dı́az J.F. Strobe R. Engelborghs Y. Souto A.A. Andreu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26265-26276Google Scholar)). Each batch of cross-linked microtubules was found to be stable against dilution and low temperatures. The binding sites of Taxol in drop-frozen microtubules were found to be stable for at least several months, while they slowly decayed at 4 °C with a half-life of ∼50 days (average of four batches). The morphology of the cross-linked microtubules was checked with electron microscopy as described previously (45Andreu J.M. Dı́az J.F. Gil R. de Pereda J.M. Garcı́a de Lacoba M. Peyrot V. Briand C. Towns-Andrews E. Bordas J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31785-31792Google Scholar). Cross-linked microtubules before freezing were normal and indistinguishable from non-stabilized microtubules, whereas unfrozen microtubules showed many openings along their structures. When indicated, cross-linked microtubules in GAB 0.1 mm GTP were digested with 0.7% w/w subtilisin Carlsberg (Sigma) for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped with 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Calbiochem), and the cleavage of the C-terminal fragment of both tubulin subunits was checked by SDS-PAGE of peptides (46Walker J.M. The Protein Protocols Handbook. Humana Press, Inc., Totowa, NJ1996: 101-107Google Scholar). The kinetics of binding and dissociation of Flutax-1 and Flutax-2 were measured by the change of fluorescence intensity using an SS-51 stopped flow device (High-Tech Scientific, UK) equipped with a fluorescence detection system, using an excitation wavelength of 492 and a 530-nm cut-off filter in the emission pathway. The fitting of the kinetic curves was done with a non-linear least squares fitting program based on the Marquardt algorithm (47Bevington P.R. Data Reduction and Error Analysis for the Physical Sciences. McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York1969: 235-240Google Scholar) where pseudo-first order conditions were used; otherwise the FITSIM package (48Barshop B.A. Wrenn R.F. Frieden C. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 130: 134-145Google Scholar) was employed. Because the binding of Taxol to microtubules does not produce any optical signal, its binding kinetics was measured by its effect on the observable Flutax-1 binding to microtubules. The binding of Flutax-1 to its microtubule site in the presence of different concentrations of Taxol was measured as described above. The kinetic curves were fitted using the rate constants of binding and dissociation of Flutax-1 that had been determined independently (see Ref. 35Dı́az J.F. Strobe R. Engelborghs Y. Souto A.A. Andreu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26265-26276Google Scholar and this work). The kinetics of dissociation of Taxol from its site in the microtubules was measured by adding 10 μm Flutax-1 to a solution containing 1 μm Taxol and 1 μm binding sites. The dissociation of Taxol can be assessed by the small (less than 5%) change in fluorescence intensity of the solution because of the binding of Flutax-1 to the sites left empty by Taxol. The low signal to noise ratio required averaging a minimum of 10 experimental curves per measurement. These experiments were measured with a photon counting instrument Fluorolog 3-221 (Jobin Yvon-Spex, Longiumeau, France) with excitation wavelength 495 nm (0.1-nm bandpass in order to prevent photolysis) and emission wavelength 525 nm (5-nm bandpass). The equilibrium binding constants of Flutax-1, Flutax-2, and Taxol to microtubules were obtained from anisotropy titration measurements made with a PolarStar microplate reader (BMG Labtechnologies, Offenburg, Germany) at different temperatures, as described (44Andreu J.M. Barasoain I. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11975-11984Google Scholar). PtK2 potoroo epithelial-like kidney cells were cultured as described previously (49De Ines C. Leynadier D. Barasoain I. Peyrot V. Garcı́a P. Briand C. Rener G.A. Temple Jr., C. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 75-84Google Scholar). Unfixed coverslip-attached PtK2 cytoskeletons were obtained by washing cells eight times with PEMP (PEM buffer containing 4% polyethylene glycol 8000, pH 6.8), and then the cells were permeabilized with 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PEM (100 mmPipes, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 6.8) for 90 s at room temperature and finally washed eight times in PEMP microtubule stabilizing buffer (34Evangelio J.A. Abal M. Barasoain I. Souto A.A. Acuña A.U. Amat-Guerri F. Andreu J.M. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1998; 39: 73-90Google Scholar) to avoid disassembly. The cytoskeletons were dipped into 0.2 or 1 μm Flutax-2 for different times. They were rapidly washed 12 times with 2 ml of PEMP changing the washing well after six washes, mounted with 20 μl of PEMP, and their images were recorded with a Zeiss Axioplan epifluorescence microscope using a 100× Plan-Apochromat objective and a Hamamatsu 9742-95 cooled CCD camera (36Abal M. Souto A.A. Amat-Guerri F. Acuña A.U. Andreu J.M. Barasoain I. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2001; 49: 1-15Google Scholar). Controls were performed, in which the incubation with Flutax-2 was made in the presence of 50 μm docetaxel (which was preferred to Taxol due to its higher solubility). The displacement of Flutax-2 was observed in cytoskeletons incubated for 2 min with 1 μm Flutax-2, washed eight times with PEMP in two different wells, incubated with 13.3 μm docetaxel for different times, and then washed again eight times with PEMP in two different wells to remove the displaced Flutax-2, and the images were recorded as above. The fluorescence intensities of a minimum of 10 different fields per time point were integrated using Scion Image (Scion Corp.) and averaged. In order to measure the fluorescence intensity per unit of length of microtubules, 3 × 10-pixel (0.08 × 0.24 μm) rectangles where defined over single interphasic microtubules in the images. The intensity of the rectangles was found to be homogeneous within each microtubule and among microtubules at each reaction time (the S.D. was 8 ± 2% of the mean value). The values of the controls performed with 50 μm docetaxel were subtracted from the data. The maximal amount of tubulin contained in the cytoskeletons can be roughly estimated from the number of cells attached to the coverslip (∼200,000) and the volume of each cell (∼10−12liters). Assuming that the concentration of cytoskeletal tubulin inside the cells is in the order of 50 μm (5 mg/ml), the maximal amount of tubulin per coverslip is 10−11 mol, which is 200 and 40 times lower than the amount of Flutax-2 (0.2 or 1 μm) in the 2-ml well. The fact that the concentration of Flutax-2 remains constant during the experiment (pseudo-first order conditions) was confirmed by spectrophotometric measurements of Flutax-2 before and after staining of the cytoskeletons, with no change detected. In order to discard the possibility that the fluorescein moiety of the fluorescent taxoids could contribute to the fast initial binding steps of these ligands to their site in the microtubules, the kinetic constants of Taxol association and dissociation were measured using a competition method. This method precludes analysis of the exact mechanism of association of Taxol, which is assumed to occur in a single step, thought to be equivalent to the first step of binding of Flutax-1 (Introduction). The microtubules used for these experiments had been stabilized by gentle cross-linking (see “Experimental Procedures”), a procedure that has been shown not to modify the kinetics of binding of fluorescent taxoids (35Dı́az J.F. Strobe R. Engelborghs Y. Souto A.A. Andreu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26265-26276Google Scholar). Because the microtubules were frozen in liquid nitrogen and unfrozen prior to use, adequate controls were performed in order to check that the kinetics of binding was not modified by freezing, as was the case. The binding time course of 500 nm Flutax-1 to 500 nm sites was monitored in the presence of increasing concentrations of Taxol, using stopped flow techniques. If the association of Taxol were much slower than that of Flutax-1, no effect should be observed when increasing the concentration of Taxol. On the other hand, if the association of Taxol is faster than or comparable with that of Flutax-1, both Taxol and Flutax-1 will bind simultaneously, and only part of the sites will fill with Flutax-1; in this way an appreciable effect in the amplitude of the observed kinetics should be noticed. This is the case, as can be seen in Fig.1 A. A complete set of curves at each temperature were simultaneously fitted (using the rate constants of association and dissociation of Flutax-1 (35Dı́az J.F. Strobe R. Engelborghs Y. Souto A.A. Andreu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26265-26276Google Scholar)), rendering the kinetic constants of Taxol binding to its site in the microtubules (Table I). The binding rate constant value determined at 37 °C is five times higher than that of the fast step of Flutax-1 association (Taxol, 3.6 × 106m−1 s−1; Flutax-1, 6.1 × 105 to 7.4 × 105m−1 s−1 (35Dı́az J.F. Strobe R. Engelborghs Y. Souto A.A. Andreu J.M. J. Biol.

The values determined in this aqueous buffer at 20 °C, D20H2O, are as follows: 3.1 ± 0.3 × 10−10 m2s−1 for Taxol, 2.8 ± 0.2 × 10−10m2 s−1 for Flutax-1, and 2.7 ± 0.1 × 10−10 m2 s−1 for Flutax-2. After correction for the viscosity of GAB and temperature, the diffusion constants under the experimental conditions, D37,GAB, were 2.2 ± 0.2 × 10−10m2 s−1, 1.9 ± 0.2 × 10−10 m2 s−1, and 1.8 ± 0.2 × 10−10 m2 s−1, respectively. The value of Flutax-2 is very close to the rough spherical approximation used in our previous work, 1.6 × 10−10 m2 s−1 (35Dı́az J.F. Strobe R. Engelborghs Y. Souto A.A. Andreu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26265-26276Google Scholar). The diffusion coefficient values of the fluorescent ligands indicate, following the Stokes-Einstein equation, an effective radius of 8 Å. The kinetic constants of dissociation of Taxol were determined by displacing the Taxol bound to its site in the microtubules with a 10-fold excess of Flutax-1 (Fig. 1 B). The values obtained for k −1 of Taxol (0.091 s−1 at 37 °C) (Table I) and its activation energy (Fig. 2 A) are in between those of k −1 andk −2 of Flutax-1, so it is not possible to assign directly the dissociation step to either of the two dissociation steps of the fluorescent taxoid. The ratio of k + and k −renders equilibrium binding constant values of Taxol binding in the order of 107m−1 s−1which is compatible with equilibrium measurements of competition with Flutax-2 (Table II). There is a factor from 3 to 4 between both sets of values, coming from a similar factor observed between the equilibrium constants of the fluorescent taxoids used as reference values calculated from their kinetic parameters and those measured directly (Tables II and III in Ref.35Dı́az J.F.

This plasma membrane-redistributed GLUT4 protein was partially co-localized with caveolin as determined by confocal fluorescent microscopy but was fully excluded from lipid rafts based upon Triton X-100 extractability. Cholesterol depletion with methyl-β-cyclodextrin, filipin, or cholesterol oxidase resulted in an insulin-independent increase in the amount of plasma membrane-localized GLUT4 that was fully reversible by cholesterol replenishment.

However, this effect was not specific since cholesterol extraction also resulted in a dramatic inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis as assessed by transferrin receptor internalization. To functionally distinguish between caveolin- and clathrin-dependent endocytic processes, we took advantage of a dominant-interfering caveolin 1 mutant (Cav1/S80E) that specifically disrupts caveolae organization. Expression of Cav1/S80E, but not the wild type (Cav1/WT) or Cav1/S80A mutant, inhibited cholera toxin B internalization without any significant effect on transferrin receptor endocytosis. In parallel, Cav1/S80E expression increased the amount of plasma membrane-localized GLUT4 protein in an insulin-independent manner. Although Cav1/S80E also decreased GLUT4 endocytosis, the extent of GLUT4 internalization was only partially reduced (∼40%). In addition, expression of Cav1/WT and Cav1/S80A enhanced GLUT4 endocytosis by ∼20%.

The increase in plasma membrane GLUT4 occurs due to a large increase in the rate of GLUT4 exocytosis coupled with a smaller decrease in the rate of GLUT4 endocytosis (6Simpson F. Whitehead J.P.

Recent data suggest that two independent signal transduction pathways are necessary for the full extent of insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation. In one case, the insulin receptor tyrosine phosphorylates insulin receptor substrate-family proteins, resulting in the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and the generation of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate. Although less well defined, the serine/threonine kinases phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 and protein kinase B/Akt as well as protein kinase Cζ/λ have been implicated in signaling events functioning downstream of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (8Kaburagi Y.

In turn, Cbl is recruited to plasma membrane lipid raft microdomains through the CAP (Cbl-associated protein) adaptor protein that binds to both Cbl and the caveolar protein flotillin (12Chiang S.H.

Although substantial progress has been made in our understanding of the GLUT4 exocytotic process, the mechanisms and pathways involved in GLUT4 endocytosis and recycling are poorly understood. Several studies have indicated that GLUT4 is internalized through a clathrin-dependent endocytic pathway. For example, potassium depletion disrupts clathrin-coated pits and inhibits GLUT4 endocytosis (13Nishimura H. Zarnowski M.J. Simpson I.A. J. Biol.

Several studies report that caveolin-enriched fractions contain the majority of GLUT4 (20Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. Baldini G. Sargiacomo M. Mastick C.C. Lodish H.F. J.

Harris D.S. Heuser J. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1181-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 24Kandror K.V. Stephens J.M. Pilch P.F. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 999-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, disruption of lipid raft structure by cholesterol depletion effectively inhibits insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation and glucose uptake (23Ros-Baro A. Lopez-Iglesias C. Peiro S.

Chem. 2001; 276: 9670-9678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Furthermore, intracellular GLUT4 compartments were also observed to be devoid of caveolin, suggesting that if GLUT4 is caveolin-associated at the plasma membrane, after endocytosis GLUT4 must segregate from these caveolin-enriched domains (27Munoz P. Mora S. Sevilla L. Kaliman P. Tomas E. Guma A. Testar X. Palacin M. Zorzano A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8133-8139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). One interpretation of these data is that plasma membrane caveolin-enriched lipid raft microdomains may be involved in the insulin-stimulated GLUT4 endocytic process. Consistent with this hypothesis, cholesterol depletion has recently been reported to inhibit GLUT4 endocytosis (23Ros-Baro A. Lopez-Iglesias C. Peiro S. Bellido D. Palacin M. Zorzano A. Camps M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12050-12055Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). However, this interpretation is complicated because cholesterol depletion can also inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis through a physical restraint on membrane curvature (28Rodal S.K. Skretting G. Garred O. Vilhardt F. van Deurs B. Sandvig K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 961-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar, 29Subtil A. Gaidarov I. Kobylarz K. Lampson M.A. Keen J.H. McGraw T.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6775-6780Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Moreover, cholesterol depletion does not distinguish between cell surface caveolae versus caveolae localized to internal membrane compartments; thus it is not clear if GLUT4 endocytosis has specifically been affected in these experiments. To resolve some of these issues, we have examined the effect of cholesterol extraction and expression of caveolin mutants on the localization and rate of GLUT4 endocytosis in 3T3L1 adipocytes. Our data demonstrate that increased expression of wild type caveolin accelerates the extent of GLUT4 translocation. In contrast, expression of a dominant-interfering caveolin mutant inhibited GLUT4 endocytosis without any significant effect on clathrin-dependent internalization. However, the specific disruption of caveolin organization only partially inhibited GLUT4 endocytosis, whereas blockade of both clathrin and caveolin function resulted in a near complete block of GLUT4 internalization. These data are consistent with a model wherein caveolae and clathrin function together to mediate the efficient endocytosis of GLUT4. The Myc, HA, and clathrin antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Caveolin-2 antibody was from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Transferrin receptor antibody was from Leinco Technologies, Inc. (Ballwin, MO). The polyclonal antibody against GLUT4 (IAO2) and TC10 were obtained as previously described (14Kao A.W. Ceresa B.P.

Fluorescent secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Cholesterol, filipin III, methyl-β-cyclodextrin, and FITC-labeled cholera toxin B were from Sigma. Cholesterol oxidase was from Calbiochem. The Myc-tagged wild type caveolin 1 (Cav1/WT) cDNA was mutated to replace serine 80 with glutamic acid (Cav1/S80E) or with alanine (Cav1/S80A) via PCR and was cloned into pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen). GLUT4-EGFP cDNA was constructed as previously described (31Thurmond D.C. Ceresa B.P. Okada S. Elmendorf J.S. Coker K. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33876-33883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), and exofacial HA-tagged GLUT4 was generated by inserting the sequence CTTAAGTACCCTTATGATGTGCCAGATTATGCCGCTAGCCTC into the first exofacial loop of GLUT4 cDNA and cloning into pcDNA3 vector. Human transferrin receptor cDNA was purchased from American Type Tissue Culture (Manassas, VA) and subcloned into pcDNA3 vector. Murine 3T3L1 preadipocytes (American Type Tissue Culture) were grown and differentiated as described previously (32Olson A.L. Knight J.B. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2425-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Fully differentiated 3T3L1 adipocytes were electroporated with various cDNAs using a low voltage electroporation technique (0.15 V at 950 microfarads) as previously described (33Min J. Okada S. Coker K. Ceresa B.P. Elmendorf J.S. Syu L.-J. Noda Y. Saltiel A.R. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 751-760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). After transfection, the cells were plated on collagen-coated coverslips and incubated for 18–24 h before analysis. Intact cell immunofluorescence was performed by washing the cells once with ice-cold PBS followed by fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Ft. Washington, PA) and 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS at room temperature for 10 min. The cells were then blocked with 5% donkey serum. Plasma membrane sheets were prepared by the method of Robinson et al. (19Robinson L.J. Pang S. Harris D.S. Heuser J. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1181-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Briefly, the membranes were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 20 min and blocked with 5% donkey serum. The cells or plasma membrane sheets were then incubated with primary antibodies for 90 min at 37 °C and Texas Red- or FITC-conjugated donkey secondary antibody for 2 h at room temperature. The coverslips were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Inc. Burlington, CA) and examined with 40× or 63× oil immersion objectives using a Zeiss 510 confocal laser-scanning microscope. Fully differentiated 3T3L1 adipocytes were pretreated with 10 mm methyl-β-cyclodextrin, 5 μg/ml filipin III, or 2 units/ml cholesterol oxidase in serum starvation medium for the indicated period and then stimulated by 100 nm insulin for 30 min. To examine the effect of cholesterol recovery, cholesterol-methyl-β-cyclodextrin complexes were synthesized as described previously (34Pike L.J. Miller J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22298-22304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.95 mg of cholesterol was dissolved in 12.6 μl of isopropanol:CHCl3(2:1) solution. Methyl-β-cyclodextrin (31.5 mg) was dissolved in 346.5 μl of double-distilled H2O and heated to 80 °C with stirring. The cholesterol was added to methyl-β-cyclodextrin, and the solution was stirred until clear. This solution contained 6.8 mm cholesterol. For use, complexes were diluted into serum starvation medium to a final concentration of 0.2 mm. After methyl-β-cyclodextrin treatment, the cells were incubated with 0.2 mm cholesterol-methyl-β-cyclodextrin complexes for the indicated period. 3T3L1 adipocytes co-transfected with pcDNA3 vector, Myc-Cav1/WT, Myc-Cav1/S80E, or Myc-Cav1/S80A and exofacial HA-tagged GLUT4 were insulin-stimulated for 30 min at 37 °C. Then the cells were chilled and incubated with HA monoclonal antibody for 1 h at 4 °C to label the GLUT4 at the plasma membrane, and cells were washed to remove insulin and excess HA antibody as described previously (14Kao A.W. Ceresa B.P. Santeler S.R. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25450-25457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The cells were returned to 37 °C and incubated for various times to allow HA antibody-bound GLUT4 to internalize. The reactions were stopped by washing once with ice-cold PBS and fixing in 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS at room temperature for 10 min. The cells were incubated with Myc polyclonal antibody followed by Texas Red-anti-mouse and FITC-anti rabbit secondary antibody. Translocation of HA antibody-bound GLUT4 from plasma membrane to the intracellular pool was examined by immunofluorescence microscopy. 3T3L1 adipocytes overexpressing human transferrin receptor were pretreated with or without 10 mm methyl-β-cyclodextrin for 30 min. Then the cells were incubated with 5 μg/ml Texas Red-conjugated transferrin at 4 °C for 1 h to label the surface transferrin receptor followed by washing the cells 4 times with ice-cold PBS. The cells were returned to 37 °C and incubated for the indicated period to allow the endocytosis of labeled transferrin receptor. Then transferrin receptor endocytosis was examined by a confocal laser-scanning microscope. Cholera toxin B uptake was examined as described previously (35Henley J.R. Krueger E.W. Oswald B.J. McNiven M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 85-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). Briefly, differentiated 3T3L1 adipocytes were rinsed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution and serum-starved for 2 h. Then the cells were chilled and incubated with 4 μg/ml FITC-labeled cholera toxin B for 30 min at 4 °C. The cells were washed 4 times, returned to 37 °C, and incubated for 2.5 h. Uptake of FITC-labeled cholera toxin B was examined by a confocal laser-scanning microscope. Plasma membrane sheets of 3T3L1 adipocytes were extracted with a lysis buffer containing with 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mmNaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 15 min at 0 °C. The samples were then centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min, the supernatants were collected, and the pellets were washed once with ice-cold PBS, re-centrifuged, and re-suspended in the lysis buffer. The supernatants and re-suspended pellets were placed in Laemmli sample buffer, and the proteins were separated in a 7.5–20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride-blotting membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA), and analyzed for transferrin receptor, GLUT4, and caveolin by immunoblotting. Previously, we and others have observed that differentiated 3T3L1 adipocytes assemble large clusters of individual caveolae (caveolae rosettes) that are discernible by confocal fluorescent microscopy (25Gustavsson J.

Chem. 2002; 277: 25867-25869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Consistent with our previous findings (30Watson R.T. Shigematsu S. Chiang S.H. Mora S. Kanzaki M. Macara I.G. Saltiel A.R. Pessin J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 829-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), the lipid raft-targeted small GTP-binding protein TC10 and caveolin co-localize with these plasma membrane structures (Fig.1 A, panels a–c). However, the organization of these proteins is distinct from marker proteins that do not associate in lipid raft microdomains such as the transferrin receptor, which recycles from the plasma membrane through clathrin-coated pits, and the clathrin coat protein itself (Fig.1 A, panels d–i). In the basal state, caveolin displays its characteristic cluster organization that is apparent at both low and high magnifications (Fig. 1 B, panels e and f). However, in the absence of insulin the amount of GLUT4 protein present in the plasma membrane is very low, and thus, there is essentially no colocalization with caveolin (Fig.1 B, panels a, b, e,f, i, and j). Insulin stimulation had no significant effect on the organization of caveolin, but there was a marked increase in the plasma membrane association of GLUT4 (Fig.1 B, panels c, d, g,h, k, and l). Comparison of these images indicated that GLUT4 was partially dispersed throughout the plasma membrane. However, GLUT4 did display some co-localization with the caveolin-positive ring structures, although not nearly as pronounced as the TC10 marker. Because the apparent association of GLUT4 with the large clusters of organized caveolin was indeterminate, we assessed the association of GLUT4 with lipid raft microdomains by cold Triton X-100 extraction (Fig. 2). Total Triton X-100 extracts of isolated plasma membrane sheets (lysates) demonstrated the presence of the transferrin receptor, GLUT4, and caveolin (Fig. 2, lane 1). After centrifugation, the resulting soluble fraction contained all three proteins, whereas the insoluble pellet fraction was completely devoid of the transferrin receptor and GLUT4 (Fig. 2,lanes 2 and 3). Although a majority of the caveolin 1 protein was found in the soluble fraction, there was a substantial amount resistant to cold Triton X-100 extraction. As expected, insulin stimulation demonstrated a large increase in the amount of plasma membrane sheet-localized GLUT4 along with a smaller increase in the translocation of the transferrin receptor (Fig.2, lanes 4 and 5). Nevertheless, both the transferrin receptor and GLUT4 remained completely cold Triton X-100-soluble, whereas caveolin 1 was only partially extracted (Fig. 2,lanes 5 and 6). Together, these data demonstrate that GLUT4 is not an integral component of caveolin-containing lipid raft microdomains in 3T3L1 adipocytes. Recently several studies have reported that cholesterol extraction can inhibit insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (23Ros-Baro A. Lopez-Iglesias C. Peiro S. Bellido D. Palacin M. Zorzano A. Camps M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12050-12055Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 25Gustavsson J. Parpal S. Karlsson M. Ramsing C. Thorn H. Borg M. Lindroth M. Peterson K.H.

Chem. 2001; 276: 9670-9678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). To determine whether this resulted from an increase in plasma membrane-localized GLUT4, we next treated adipocytes with several agents known to alter lipid raft microdomains through modification of cell surface cholesterol (Fig.3). As expected, there was essentially no detectable plasma membrane-associated GLUT4 protein in the basal state, but after insulin stimulation GLUT4 was readily apparent (Fig.3 A, panels a and e). Treatment with methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) and cholesterol (Chol) oxidase resulted in an increase in the cell surface GLUT4 protein levels and did not display any further statistical significant increase by insulin (Fig. 3 A, panels b, d, f, and h). Although filipin also increased the basal level of plasma membrane-associated GLUT4, insulin was still capable of inducing a further stimulation (Fig.3 A, panels c and g). These results were quantitated by determining the relative fluorescent intensity of plasma membrane sheets from three independent experiments (Fig.3 B). To ensure that this was a specific effect of cholesterol depletion, adipocytes were first treated with MβCD and subsequently repleted with cholesterol (Fig. 4). As is readily apparent, MβCD treatment resulted in the cell surface appearance of GLUT4 that was fully reversed by re-introduction of cholesterol in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 4, panels a–f). Together, these data demonstrate that cholesterol depletion results in the accumulation of GLUT4 protein at the plasma membrane. The increase in plasma membrane GLUT4 could result from either an increase in exocytosis and/or decrease in endocytosis. Because previous studies report that cholesterol extraction can inhibit endocytosis (28Rodal S.K. Skretting G. Garred O. Vilhardt F. van Deurs B. Sandvig K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 961-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar,29Subtil A. Gaidarov I. Kobylarz K. Lampson M.A. Keen J.H. McGraw T.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6775-6780Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar), we determined the effect of MβCD on GLUT4 and transferrin receptor internalization (Fig. 5). Adipocytes were transfected with an exofacial HA epitope-tagged GLUT4 and stimulated with insulin to induce GLUT4 translocation and accumulation of the HA epitope on the plasma membrane. After HA antibody labeling at 4 °C, the insulin was removed by extensive washing, and the cells were then warmed to 37 °C for various times. As is apparent, the HA-GLUT4 was strongly labeled at the cell surface with essentially no interior labeling at 4 °C (Fig. 5 A,panels a and e). In untreated cells, there was a rapid time-dependent internalization of GLUT4 that concentrated in small compartments beneath the plasma membrane and in the perinuclear region (Fig. 5 A, panels b–f). Pretreatment of the cells with MβCD resulted in a marked reduction in the time-dependent appearance of intracellular-localized GLUT4 (Fig. 5 A, panels f–h). It should be noted that although MβCD treatment decreased the rate of GLUT4 internalization, it was not completely inhibited. This is better exemplified by plotting the number of cells displaying internalized GLUT4 after insulin removal (Fig. 5 B). Several studies report that cholesterol depletion can impair both lipid raft- and non-lipid raft-dependent internalization (28Rodal S.K. Skretting G. Garred O. Vilhardt F. van Deurs B. Sandvig K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 961-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar,29Subtil A. Gaidarov I. Kobylarz K. Lampson M.A. Keen J.H. McGraw T.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6775-6780Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). To address this issue in our experimental system, we also determined the effect of MβCD treatment on the internalization of the transferrin receptor (Fig. 5 C). After cell surface labeling at 4 °C and warming to 37 °C, the exofacial labeled transferrin receptor internalized with a similar rate and extent as GLUT4 in untreated cells. Similarly, the rate and extent of internalized transferrin receptor was substantially reduced in cells pretreated with MβCD. Thus, the impairment of GLUT4 endocytosis by cholesterol depletion accounts for its accumulation at the plasma membrane. However, these data do not distinguish whether GLUT4 endocytosis occurs through either a clathrin-dependent and/or lipid raft-dependent mechanism. Caveolin 1 can undergo phosphorylation at Ser-80 that results in the intracellular retention of caveolin 1 and co-sequestration of caveolin 2 (37Parolini I. Sargiacomo M. Galbiati F. Rizzo G. Grignani F. Engelman J.A. Okamoto T. Ikezu T. Scherer P.E. Mora R. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Peschle C. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol.

In turn, the loss of cell surface caveolin 1 and two proteins prevents the formation of caveolae structures and impairs caveolin-dependent functions. Thus, to distinguish between caveolin-dependent and non-caveolin-mediated endocytosis, we tested the ability of caveolin 1 mutants to affect caveolin organization and function in adipocytes (Fig. 6). The expressed wild type caveolin 1 (Cav1/WT) protein was distributed in ring-like clustered patterns on the plasma membrane that co-localized with endogenous caveolin 2 (Fig. 6, panels a and d).

Many fundamental regulatory decisions are mediated by signal transduction pathways that are initiated by the engagement of a receptor-ligand pair through cell-to-cell contact. The Notch signal transduction pathway, which governs cell fate decisions, is regulated primarily through this sort of mechanism (1Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Rand M.D. Lake R.J.

JAGGED1 is a member of the Delta/Serrate/Lag-2 (DSL)1 family of proteins that are thought to be cell-bound ligands that regulate Notch signaling (6Fleming R.J. Semin. Cell Dev.

DSL genes encode Type I membrane-spanning proteins that have an extracellular domain consisting of multiple highly conserved EGF-like motifs (16 copies in human JAGGED1) and a conserved DSL domain that is rich in cysteine residues (Fig. 2 A). The DSL family is classified into either the Delta-like or serrate/Jagged subgroups. The defining motif of serrate/Jagged DSL proteins is the presence of a cysteine-rich region (CR) between the EGF-like repeats and transmembrane domain. The intracellular domains of DSL proteins vary in length and are not conserved in primary amino acid sequence. For example, there is no sequence conservation between the 125 residues in the intracellular domain of JAGGED1 and the 154 residues in the intracellular domain of human DELTA1. Furthermore, the intracellular domains of DSL proteins do not share any significant similarities to other known proteins. However, deletions of the intracellular domains of serrate and delta result in similar mutant phenotypes inDrosophila, indicating that there is some function associated with this portion of the molecules (10Sun X. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Development. 1997; 124: 3439-3448Google Scholar, 11Sun X. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Development. 1996; 122: 2465-2474Google Scholar, 12Hukriede N.A. Gu Y. Fleming R.J. Development. 1997; 124: 3427-3437Google Scholar). DSL proteins expressed on the surface of the signal-transmitting cell are thought to function by activating Notch in a neighboring signal-receiving cell (Notch-expressing cell). However, an important question remains to be addressed: Does the signal-transmitting cell itself receive a signal that can be transmitted through the expressed DSL protein? Interestingly, the C terminus of JAGGED1 encodes a putative PDZ (PSD-95/Dlg/Zo-1)-ligand (13Hock B. Bohme B. Karn T. Yamamoto T. Kaibuchi K. Holtrich U. Holland S. Pawson T. Rubsamen-Waigmann H. Strebhardt K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9779-9784Google Scholar). Therefore, a potential role for JAGGED1 in novel PDZ-dependent signaling mechanisms exists. However, biological or biochemical evidence for this type of intrinsic JAGGED1 signaling has not been observed. Although it is not clear if signaling events occur in both the DSL-expressing and Notch-expressing cells upon receptor-ligand binding, bi-directional signaling mechanisms such as the Eph/Ephrin pathway have been documented (14Schmucker D. Zipursky S.L. Cell. 2001; 105: 701-704Google Scholar). There are four mammalian Notch genes (Notch1–4) encoding membrane-spanning receptors that are activated through interaction with DSL proteins across cell boundaries. The binding of DSL and Notch proteins is thought to result in a conformational change that renders Notch susceptible to proteolytic processing mediated by metalloproteases such as TNFα-converting enzyme (TACE) (15Brou C.

Constitutive presenilin-dependent γ-secretase activity is thought to then mediate an additional proteolytic cleavage that results in the release of the intracellular domain of Notch (Nic) from the plasma membrane (16Mumm J.S.

Nic subsequently translocates to the nucleus and effects gene expression (5Struhl G. Adachi A. Cell. 1998; 93: 649-660Google Scholar, 17Schroeter E.H. Kisslinger J.A. Kopan R.

Minoguchi S. Sakai T. Nomura-Okazaki S. Tamura K. Honjo T. Development. 1997; 124: 4133-4141Google Scholar). All four Notch receptors have been shown to undergo the constitutive γ-secretase proteolysis, indicating that the specificity in signaling is not at this level of processing (21Saxena M.T. Schroeter E.H. Mumm J.S. Kopan R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40268-40273Google Scholar). Where the specificity in DSL-Notch signaling lies is not well understood. Although it is not known which DSL proteins can activate which Notch molecules, the DSL proteins Jagged1, Jagged2, and Delta1 have been reported to bind Notch2 and subsequently induce processing, indicating that multiple DSL proteins can activate a specific Notch molecule (22Shimizu K. Chiba S. Hosoya N. Kumano K. Saito T. Kurokawa M. Kanda Y. Hamada Y. Hirai H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6913-6922Google Scholar). Furthermore, soluble forms of the extracellular domain of Jagged1 can physically interact with Notch1, Notch2, and Notch3 in binding assays (23Shimizu K. Chiba S. Kumano K. Hosoya N. Takahashi T. Kanda Y. Hamada Y. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32961-32969Google Scholar, 24Shimizu K. Chiba S. Saito T. Kumano K. Hirai H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 385-389Google Scholar). Taken together, these data indicate that Jagged1 can bind all Notch receptors leading to activation of signaling in a similar manner. One potential mechanism that provides specificity in signaling is at the level of ligand-receptor interactions. Fringe proteins areO-fucose-β1, 3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases that modify the extracellular domain of Notch, resulting in an increase in affinity for Delta proteins and a decrease in affinity for Jagged proteins (25Hicks C.

Our laboratory has demonstrated that expression of activated NOTCH proteins (Nic) in RKE cells results in neoplastic transformation. Although there is evidence that JAGGED1 gene expression is altered in several human tumors, such as cervical and colon carcinomas, there is no evidence for a causal role in oncogenesis (29Gray G.E. Mann R.S. Mitsiadis E. Henrique D. Carcangiu M.L. Banks A. Leiman J. Ward D. Ish-Horowitz D. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 154: 785-794Google Scholar). Here, we report that expression of JAGGED1 results in cellular transformation of RKE cells in a dose-dependent manner. Both the extracellular and intracellular domains are required for this activity since expression of either a soluble form of the extracellular domain or a membrane-tethered intracellular domain fails to transform cells. Furthermore, JAGGED1-mediated transformation requires an intact C terminus that constitutes a PDZ-ligand. Our data indicate that cellular transformation by JAGGED1 expression is likely due to a PDZ-dependent signaling mechanism intrinsic to JAGGED1, providing evidence of a causal role for misexpression of JAGGED1 in oncogenesis and for a bi-directional mode of signaling in the Notch/DSL pathway. pcDNA expression vectors encoding humanJAGGED1, DELTA1, and NOTCH1 were kindly provided by S.

The pcDNA-Nic (Nic) and pcDNA-MASTERMIND-LIKE 1(MAML1myc) vectors were described elsewhere (35Jeffries S. Robbins D.J. Capobianco A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3927-3941Google Scholar). The following expression plasmids were generated: pcDNA-AF6ΔPDZ (deletion of aa 994–1012), pcDNA-Jex (aa 1–1067), pcDNA-Jtmic(deletion of aa 24–1067), pcDNA-Jtmic−myc(Jtmic plus a C-terminal Myc tag), pcDNA-J1ΔPL (aa 1–1212), pcDNA-J1myc(addition of a C-terminal Myc tag) and CMV-NotchΔ2444 (aa 1–2444). Detailed description of cloning strategies and primer sequences are provided as Supplemental Information. Jagged1 promoter reporter constructs were used in luciferase assays. For pJ1pro−8000/−98, the cDNA sequence for Jagged1 was used to search the high throughput genomic sequence data base (HTGS) on NCBI. A PAC clone was found to encode the entire genomic locus of Jagged1, including sequences up and downstream. PAC RPCI5 was obtained from The Sanger Centre. According to the genomic sequence, a SacI fragment encoded sequences 8-kb upstream of +1- and 2-kb downstream of the +1. This fragment was cloned into pBluescript (Stratagene). This clone was then digested usingNotI, which digests the fragment immediately 3′ of the 3′ JagPro-xho primer (described below). This fragment was blunted using Vent polymerase and dNTPs at 72 °C for 20 min. This product was then digested using SacI and cloned into pGL3basicSacI/SmaI. A 3.4-kb fragment of theJagged1 promoter was isolated by PCR from HeLa genomic DNA using primers 5′ JagPro3.4 and 3′ JagPro. Sequences of the primers are 5′-ATTCACTGGTGGACTGGAGG-3′ and 5′-AGGGAAGGAGGTAGGTCAGC-3′, respectively. The PCR product was then cloned into the TA TOPO 2.1 vector (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. pJ1pro−629/−98 was then obtained from this clone using PCR primers 5′ JagPro0.7sacI and 3′ JagPro-xho. The sequences of these primers are 5′-GCGCGAGCTCCAACGATCCCTTCCAAGTA-3′ and 5′-GCGCCTCGAGCGTCCCGGCTCTAATATAC-3′, respectively. The PCR product was digested with restriction enzymes SacI and XhoI (NEBL) and cloned into the luciferase vector pGL3-basic (Promega). Promoter constructs pJ1pro−629/−321 and pJ1pro−321/−98 were isolated as above using the PCR primers 5′ Jagpro0.7sacI and 3′ JagPro-UTR (5′-GCGCCTCGAGAAAAACCAGCCTAGCTCG-3′) or 5′ JagProUTR (5′-GCGCGAGCTCCGAGCTAGGCTGGTTTTT-3) and 3′ JagPro- xho, respectively. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein expression constructs were generated by ligation of the pGEX-4T3 vector (AmershamBiosciences) to coding sequences for the intracellular domain of JAGGED1 (GST-Jic, aa 1094–1218) or for the deletion mutant that lacks the PDZ-ligand (GST-JicΔPL, aa 1094–1213). pGEX-Ras was kindly provided by L. Quilliam (36Rebhun J.F. Chen H. Quilliam L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13406-13410Google Scholar). RKE and RK3E cells have been previously described (31Capobianco A.J. Zagouras P. Blaumueller C.M.

All cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine (DMEMc). All cell culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen. In order to establish clonal lines, RKE cells were transfected with plasmid DNA (10 μg) as indicated in the text using either Lipofectamine (10 μg, Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's protocols or a modified BES-calcium phosphate method. Cells were seeded in media containing 400 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen) to select for expression of drug resistance markers. To analyze transformation efficiency by focus formation, 1 × 103 to 1 × 105 RKE-derived cells expressing JAGGED1, Jex, Jtmic, or J1ΔPL were seeded with 1 × 106 of parental RKE on 100-mm diameter plates. Cultures were maintained for 3 weeks, and DMEMc was replenished every 3–4 days. To enhance visualization of foci, cells were fixed in methanol and stained in 70% isopropyl alcohol containing 0.5% methylene blue. The retroviral vector MFG-LacZ was packaged into retroviral particles by cotransfection of 293T cells with 5 μg of MFG-LacZ and 5 μg of SVΨ− Eco plasmids using Lipofectamine (12 μg). Infections were performed with MFG-LacZ viral supernatant containing 8 μg/ml hexadimethrine bromide (polybrene, Sigma). Cells were washed three times with 1× phosphate-buffered saline prior to seeding non-infected parental RKE cells. Cells were fixed in 0.05% glutaraldehyde (Sigma) and stained with X-gal according to standard protocols to detect β-galactosidase activity in MFG-LacZ-infected cells. Crude membrane fractions were prepared by hypotonic lysis at 4 °C in hypotonic lysis buffer (25 mm Hepes pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) supplemented with protease inhibitors (2 mm pefabloc, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)). Following dounce homogenization with a B-type pestle (Kontes Glass Company), nuclei were pelleted at 1,600 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Cell debris were removed from the crude cytoplasmic fraction (supernatant) by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Membrane fractions were isolated by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × gfor 30 min at 4 °C. Membrane pellets were washed with 1 ml of hypotonic lysis buffer and solubilized in 200 μl of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Hepes pH 7.4, 1.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors). Whole cell lysates were obtained by lysing cells in 1 ml of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. Lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Protein concentrations were determined using the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce). Equal amounts of each lysate (20–25 μg) were separated in SDS-polyacrylamide (8 or 14%) gels, followed by transfer to either nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell) or polyvinylidene difluoride (Millipore) membranes. Western blot analysis was performed by immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies (TS1.15h for Jagged1, Ref.29Gray G.E. Mann R.S. Mitsiadis E. Henrique D. Carcangiu M.L. Banks A. Leiman J. Ward D.

Proteins were visualized using the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson Laboratories) followed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Total RNA was extracted from confluent cultures using Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's specifications. cDNA was synthesized from total RNA (2 μg) using M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase (Promega) with oligo(dT) primers. PCR reactions were performed in a 50-μl mixture containing 0.5 μm of each gene-specific primer, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 200 μm of each dNTP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 1× PCR buffer (Hybaid), 0.2 units of DNA polymerase (Hybaid), and 0.1 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP. In order to perform semiquantitative PCR, cycling parameters were determined by amplifications of serial dilutions of cDNAs so that there was a linear range of amplification for each set of primers. Amplified PCR products were separated in Tris acetate/EDTA (TAE)-4% polyacrylamide gels and exposed to x-ray film. Gene-specific primers were designed to specifically amplify endogenous rat mRNA.

Whole cell lysates were prepared from transiently transfected 293T cells expressing either AF6myc or AF6ΔPDZmyc in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. Lysates were precleared for 1 h with GST bound-glutathione agarose beads (Sigma). Lysates were split into three equal aliquots and incubated for 2 h with relevant GST fusion proteins as indicated in the text. Proteins associated with GST fusions were detected using appropriate antibodies by Western blot analysis. AF6 proteins were detected by 9E10 antibody. The 8× CBF1 luciferase reporter plasmid was kindly provided by P. D. Ling and used to analyze ligand-induced Notch activation in coculture luciferase experiments (39Fuentes-Panana E.M. Ling P.D. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 693-700Google Scholar). HeLa cells were seeded in six-well plates and transfected with 8× CBF1Luc (600 ng), CMV-β-gal (200 ng; transfection efficiency control plasmid encoding β-galactosidase), CMV-NOTCH1Δ2444 (800 ng), and pcDNA-MAML1myc(400 ng). 293T cells were transfected with the following CMV-driven expression plasmids (5 μg): pcDNA3.1A (pcDNA), Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR), JAGGED1 (J1), JAGGED1ΔPL(J1ΔPL), and DELTA1 (Dl1) using Lipofectamine (10 μg). The following day, 293T cells were trypsinized, resuspended in 4 ml of DMEMc, and cocultured with HeLa cells (1 ml/well) for 12 h. Three separate experiments were performed in triplicate. For the Jagged1 promoter luciferase assays, HeLa cells were transfected with the luciferase reporter plasmid (0.5 ng) as indicated in the text, CMV-β-Gal (0.5 ng), and the following expression vectors (1 μg): pBP283 (pBabe), pcDNA, J1, J1ΔPL, J1myc, or Nic. Three separate experiments were performed in duplicate. HeLa cells were transfected using Lipofectamine (8 μg) in a total volume of 2 ml of OptiMem. Lysates were prepared in 1X Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega). Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were measured according to standard protocols. Luciferase values were corrected for transfection efficiency based on the β-galactosidase activity. There is now significant evidence that constitutively active forms of all four Notch receptors can contribute to oncogenesis (31Capobianco A.J. Zagouras P. Blaumueller C.M. Artavanis-Tsakonas S.

We previously reported that expression of NOTCHic (Nic) results in neoplastic transformation of E1A-immortalized rat kidney epithelial cells (RKE); in contrast, overexpression of wild-type NOTCH1 failed to transform these cells (31Capobianco A.J. Zagouras P. Blaumueller C.M. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6265-6273Google Scholar). The current model for Notch signaling proposes that activation of Notch occurs through ligand-induced proteolysis via cell-to-cell contact. We reasoned that wild-type NOTCH1 does not transform RKE cells due to a lack of ligand-induced activation, and therefore, we attempted to establish a coculture focus assay to test for ligand-induced transformation activity in the context of cell-to-cell contact. Although cell-to-cell contact failed to induce the transformation of NOTCH1-expressing cells, we observed that the JAGGED1-expressing cells displayed a transformed phenotype (data not shown and Fig. 1). To confirm our initial observation that JAGGED1 expression resulted in transformation, several clonal cell lines expressing JAGGED1 were generated (Fig. 1). The JAGGED1 expression vector was transfected into RKE cells, and colonies were obtained by selecting for expression of the linked drug resistance marker. Colonies either displayed a transformed morphology, as indicated by a multilayered growth of cells, or they grew as a flat monolayer, which is consistent with a non-transformed phenotype (data not shown). Cell lines were established from six colonies that appeared morphologically transformed (J1, J3, J12, J4, J7, and J8) and three colonies that appeared to have a flat non-transformed morphology. To determine if the JAGGED1-expressing clonal cell lines were transformed, J1 and J12 clonal cell lines were maintained in culture for 3 weeks. J1 and J12 cells did not exhibit contact inhibition and produced a dense multi-layered mat of cells compared with the control plate of parental RKE cells, which formed a uniform monolayer (Fig. 1 A). The intensity of methylene blue staining was greater on the J1 plate compared with J12 plate, indicating that J1 cells grew to a greater cell density. Since a dense layer of cells was formed by JAGGED1-expressing cells, it was difficult to assess the differences in transformation efficiency among the clonal cell lines. To determine the degree of transformation efficiency, 1 × 104 clonal cells were plated in the presence of excess parental RKE cells. Five of the six clonal cell lines that initially displayed a transformed morphology formed foci (Fig. 1 B). However, the number and size of the foci were different among the clonal cell lines, indicating that there was a variation in transformation efficiency. J1 and J3 cell lines produced a greater number of foci compared with J12 and J4 cell lines, whereas parental RKE cells and drug resistant clones displaying a non-transformed morphology did not form foci (Fig. 1 B and data not shown, respectively). Crude membranes extracted from the clonal cell lines were analyzed for JAGGED1 expression (Fig. 1 C). J1 and J3 cells, which displayed the highest transformation efficiency, expressed the highest level of JAGGED1. In contrast, expression of JAGGED1 was lowest in the J4 clone, which produced the fewest foci, whereas J12 cells displayed an intermediate level of JAGGED1 expression and transformation efficiency, indicating that there is a link between expression and transformation efficiency (Fig. 1 C). No JAGGED1 expression was observed in either the J7 clonal cell line that did not form foci or in the drug resistant clones that displayed a non-transformed morphology (Fig. 1 and data not shown). Na+/K+ATPase expression in the crude membrane fractions is shown as a normalization control for these samples (Fig. 1 C). To confirm that the JAGGED1-expressing cell was the transformed cell type in the coculture, JAGGED1-expressing cells were infected with MFG-LacZ retrovirus to mark these cells with β-galactosidase activity prior to coculturing with parental RKE cells. Following focus formation, cells expressing β-galactosidase were visualized by staining with X-gal. The presence of blue foci confirmed that JAGGED1-expressing cells were the transformed cells (Fig. 1 D). Furthermore, unstained RKE cells were excluded from the foci and located only in the surrounding monolayer, indicating that only the JAGGED1-expressing cells were transformed. To determine the functional domains in JAGGED1 that are necessary and/or sufficient for transformation, we generated deletion mutants of JAGGED1 that separate the extracellular and intracellular domains (Fig.2 A). While the extracellular domain is thought to function by binding Notch to initiate signaling, the intracellular domain has not been associated with any known function. The extracellular domain of Jagged1 was constructed as either a membrane-tethered or soluble protein. The membrane-bound form of the extracellular domain was transfected into RKE cells, and isolated drug-resistant cells did not form foci in transformation assays. However, we were not able to detect expression of the membrane-tethered protein using an antibody against the C-terminal Myc tag, but we did detect protein expression in transiently transfected 293T cells, indicating that the Myc tag must have been cleaved in the clonal RKE cells (data not shown). Clonal cell lines that expressed the"
https://openalex.org/W1986299882,"ACT is a LIM-only protein expressed exclusively in round spermatids, where it cooperates with transcriptional activator CREM in regulating various postmeiotic genes. Targeted inactivation of CREM leads to a complete block of mouse spermiogenesis. We sought to identify the regulatory steps controlling the functional interplay between CREM and ACT. We found that ACT selectively associates with KIF17b, a kinesin highly expressed in male germ cells. The ACT-KIF17b interaction is restricted to specific stages of spermatogenesis and directly determines the intracellular localization of ACT. Sensitivity to leptomycin B indicates that KIF17b can be actively exported from the nucleus through the Crm1 receptor. Thus, a kinesin directly controls the activity of a transcriptional coactivator by a tight regulation of its intracellular localization."
https://openalex.org/W1984606410,"Synapses that reliably activate their postsynaptic targets typically release neurotransmitter with high probability, are not very sensitive to changes in calcium entry, and depress. We have determined the mechanisms that give rise to these characteristic features at the climbing fiber to Purkinje cell synapse. We find that saturation of presynaptic calcium entry, of presynaptic release, and of postsynaptic receptors combine to produce a postsynaptic response that is near maximal. Postsynaptic receptor saturation also accelerates recovery from depression, in part by accentuating a rapid calcium-dependent recovery phase. Thus, postsynaptic receptor saturation interacts with presynaptic mechanisms to produce highly reliable synapses that can effectively drive their targets even during sustained activation."
https://openalex.org/W2038136908,"In the cerebellum, metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) are required for distinct forms of synaptic plasticity expressed at parallel fiber (PF) and climbing fiber (CF) synapses. At PF synapses, mGluR activation generates a slow synaptic current and triggers intracellular calcium release; at CF synapses, mGluR activation has not been observed. This has led some investigators to propose that mGluR-dependent changes in CF synaptic strength are induced heterosynaptically. Here we describe an mGluR-mediated response to CF stimulation consisting of two parallel signaling pathways: one leading to a slow synaptic conductance and the other leading to internal calcium release. This additional target for glutamate broadens the signaling capabilities of CF synapses and raises the possibility that changes in CF strength are homosynaptically triggered."

Implicit learning of the sequential regularities of the ""hidden rule"" activated the ventral perirhinal cortex, within the MTL, whereas learning the fixed stimulus-response associations activated the basal ganglia, indicating that the function of the MTL and the basal ganglia depends on the learned material and not necessarily on the participants' awareness."

Ca2+ transduces many signaling events, however, it is not known whether the actions of RANKL involve Ca2+ signaling. We investigated the effects of RANKL on rat osteoclasts using microspectrofluorimetry and patch clamp. RANKL induced transient elevation of cytosolic free Ca2+concentration ([Ca2+]i) to maxima 220 nm above basal, resulting in activation of Ca2+-dependent K+ current. RANKL elevated [Ca2+]i in Ca2+-containing and Ca2+-free media, and responses were prevented by the phospholipase C inhibitor U73122. Suppression of [Ca2+]i elevation using the intracellular Ca2+ chelator 1,2-bis(O-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA) abolished the ability of RANKL to enhance osteoclast survival. Using immunofluorescence, NFκB was found predominantly in the cytosol of untreated osteoclasts. RANKL induced transient translocation of NFκB to the nuclei, which was maximal at 15 min.U73122 or BAPTA delayed nuclear translocation of NFκB. Delays were also observed upon inhibition of calcineurin or protein kinase C. We conclude that RANKL acts through phospholipase C to release Ca2+ from intracellular stores, accelerating nuclear translocation of NFκB and promoting osteoclast survival. Such cross-talk between NFκB and Ca2+ signaling provides a novel mechanism for the temporal regulation of gene expression in osteoclasts and other cell types.

This factor is expressed on osteoblasts, stromal cells, B-lymphoid lineage cells, and activated T-cells as a transmembrane ligand and it also exists in a biologically active soluble form (1Manabe N.

RANKL acts through its receptor RANK, which is expressed on osteoclast precursors, mature osteoclasts, as well as dendritic cells (4Hofbauer L.C. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 1999; 141: 195-210Google Scholar). Osteoprotegerin (OPG) is a soluble decoy receptor, which binds RANKL and blocks its interaction with RANK (4Hofbauer L.C. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 1999; 141: 195-210Google Scholar). Signaling through RANK involves the recruitment of cytosolic tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factors (TRAFs) 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6, which in turn activate multiple signaling pathways (5Wong B.R. Josien R. Lee S.Y. Vologodskaia M. Steinman R.M. Choi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28355-28359Google Scholar, 6Galibert L. Tometsko M.E. Anderson D.M. Cosman D. Dougall W.C. J. Biol.

For example, the association of RANK with TRAF2 induces activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase, which leads to phosphorylation of c-Jun and activation of AP-1 (7Darnay B.G. Haridas V. Ni J. Moore P.A. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20551-20555Google Scholar, 8Lee Z.H. Kwack K. Kim K.K. Lee S.H. Kim H.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1536-1545Google Scholar, 9Zhang Y.H. Heulsmann A. Tondravi M.M. Mukherjee A. Abu-Amer Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 563-568Google Scholar). TRAF6 has been implicated in activation of the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase c-Src and the transcription factor NFκB (10Wong B.R. Besser D. Kim N. Arron J.R. Vologodskaia M. Hanafusa H. Choi Y. Mol Cell. 1999; 4: 1041-1049Google Scholar, 11Darnay B.G. Ni J. Moore P.A. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7724-7731Google Scholar). NFκB transcription factors are dimers of the five mammalian NFκB proteins: p65 (RelA), RelB, c-Rel, p50 (NFκB1), and p52 (NFκB2). NFκB regulates the expression of a large number of genes involved in cell survival as well as in cellular responses to inflammation and stress (12Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Google Scholar, 13Mak T.W. Yeh W.C. Arthritis Res. 2002; 4: S243-S252Google Scholar). Typically, NFκB exists as a heterodimer of p50 and p65 (12Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Google Scholar). NFκB is retained in the cytoplasm complexed with inhibitory proteins IκBs. RANK signaling involves activation of NFκB-inducing kinase, leading to activation of IκB kinases (IKK) α and β, which in turn phosphorylate serine residues on IκB, targeting it for degradation in the proteasome (5Wong B.R. Josien R. Lee S.Y. Vologodskaia M. Steinman R.M. Choi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28355-28359Google Scholar, 11Darnay B.G. Ni J. Moore P.A. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol.

IκB degradation exposes the NFκB nuclear localization sequence, permitting its nuclear import. Within the nucleus, NFκB acts in concert with other transcription factors to regulate gene expression, with termination of the signal caused by binding of IκB (15Sun S.C. Ganchi P.A. Ballard D.W. Greene W.C. Science. 1993; 259: 1912-1915Google Scholar). NFκB is essential for osteoclastogenesis, as disruption of both p50 and p52 subunits of NFκB leads to an osteopetrotic phenotype, because of impaired osteoclast differentiation (16Iotsova V. Caamano J. Loy J. Yang Y. Lewin A. Bravo R. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1285-1289Google Scholar). Interaction of RANKL with RANK is crucial for osteoclast function, however, there are gaps in our understanding of the signaling events leading to activation of NFκB in response to RANKL. Although interaction of RANK with TRAF6 is necessary and sufficient to activate NFκB, dominant negative forms of TRAF molecules are unable to completely block NFκB activation, suggesting that a TRAF-independent pathway is also involved (5Wong B.R. Josien R. Lee S.Y. Vologodskaia M. Steinman R.M. Choi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28355-28359Google Scholar, 11Darnay B.G. Ni J. Moore P.A. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7724-7731Google Scholar). Because Ca2+-sensitive effectors such as calcineurin and protein kinase C (PKC) mediate NFκB activation in T lymphocytes and monocytic cell lines (17Steffan N.M. Bren G.D. Frantz B. Tocci M.J. O'Neill E.A. Paya C.V. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 4685-4691Google Scholar, 18Trushin S.A. Pennington K.N. Algeciras-Schimnich A. Paya C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22923-22931Google Scholar), we considered the possible role of Ca2+ in the activation of NFκB by RANKL in osteoclasts. We tested the hypothesis that RANKL signaling in osteoclasts involves elevation of [Ca2+]i, and examined the role of cytosolic Ca2+ in cell survival and activation of NFκB. Classical biochemical approaches for studying osteoclasts are limited because of difficulty in isolating cells in sufficient number and purity. Furthermore, osteoclasts are terminally differentiated, and therefore do not proliferate in culture. We overcame these restrictions by studying authentic osteoclasts using single-cell techniques: microspectrofluorimetry and patch clamp to study changes in [Ca2+]i and membrane currents, and immunofluorescence to assess nuclear translocation of NFκB. We report that RANKL stimulates phospholipase C (PLC) leading to release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores, transient elevation of [Ca2+]i, and activation of Ca2+-dependent K+ current. The effect of RANKL on osteoclast survival was found to be dependent on elevation of [Ca2+]i. Moreover, nuclear translocation of NFκB was slowed when elevation of Ca2+was suppressed or when calcineurin or PKC were inhibited. Thus, phospholipase C and Ca2+ signaling are revealed to be important regulators of NFκB activation and osteoclast survival. Osteoclasts were isolated from the long bones of neonatal Wistar rats or neonatal New Zealand White rabbits as described previously (19Naemsch L.N. Dixon S.J. Sims S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39107-39114Google Scholar). Briefly, long bones were dissected free of soft tissue and cut with a scalpel to release bone fragments into 2–3 ml of osteoclast culture medium that consisted of Medium 199 buffered with 25 mm HEPES and HCO3− (Invitrogen, Burlington, Ontario) supplemented with 15% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 1% antibiotic solution (penicillin, 10,000 units/ml; streptomycin, 10,000 μg/ml; amphotericin B, 25 μg/ml). Cells were suspended by repeated passage though a pipette and plated on glass coverslips or 35-mm culture dishes. Rat osteoclasts were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 1 h, then gently washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to remove nonadherent cells and incubated in fresh medium for at least 1 h before use. To quantify survival, we counted the number of rat osteoclasts in culture dishes at time 0 (time of addition of RANKL or vehicle) and at 24 h. Rabbit osteoclasts were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 2 h after isolation, then fresh culture medium was added and cells were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 2 to 7 days before use. The majority of nonosteoclastic cells were removed from rabbit preparations using Pronase E (0.001% in PBS with 0.5 mm EDTA) for ∼5 min at room temperature (22–25 °C) with intermittent agitation (modified from Ref. 20Tezuka K. Sato T. Kamioka H. Nijweide P.J. Tanaka K. Matsuo T. Ohta M. Kurihara N. Hakeda Y. Kumegawa M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 186: 911-917Google Scholar). Osteoclasts were identified by the presence of three or more nuclei, and by their characteristic morphology under phase-contrast microscopy. Rat osteoclast precursors were identified as large (20–40 μm in diameter) mononucleated cells that were generally circular in outline, possessed a region of granular cytoplasm, and often exhibited a broad lamellipod. These mononucleated cells all stained strongly with neutral red, and 92% stained positive for the osteoclast marker tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase. These procedures were approved by the Council on Animal Care of the University of Western Ontario. Soluble RANKL (murine recombinant 158–316) and OPG (human recombinant 21–194 fused at the N terminus to the Fc domain of human IgG1) were kindly provided by Amgen (Thousand Oaks, CA) and RANKL (human recombinant 151–316 fused at the N terminus to a linker peptide and a FLAG tag) was purchased from Alexis Corp. (San Diego, CA). U73122 and U73343 were obtained from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA), dissolved in chloroform, aliquoted, evaporated under N2, and stored at −80 °C. On the day of each experiment, U73122 and U73343 were reconstituted in dimethyl sulfoxide and added to the physiological buffer or medium bathing the cells. BAPTA-acetoxymethyl ester (AM) and calcein blue-AM were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR) and stock solutions were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide. Osteoclasts were loaded with the BAPTA or calcein blue by incubation in loading medium (HCO3−-free Medium 199 buffered with HEPES supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum and 1% antibiotic solution) containing 50 μmBAPTA-AM or calcein blue-AM for 10 min at room temperature. Cyclosporin A, FK506, bisindolylmaleimide I and V were obtained from Calbiochem and stock solutions were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide. [Ca2+]i of single rat osteoclasts and osteoclast precursors was monitored using microfluorimetric techniques. Cells on glass coverslips were loaded with 1.5 μm fura-2-AM (Molecular Probes) for 40 min at room temperature in loading medium. Coverslips were then placed in a chamber mounted on the stage of a Nikon Diaphot inverted phase-contrast microscope, and superfused at room temperature with physiological buffer containing (in mm): NaCl, 130; KCl, 5; glucose, 10; MgCl2, 1; CaCl2, 1; HEPES, 20; adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH; 280–290 mOsmol/liter. The ratio of fluorescence emission at 510 nm with alternate excitation wavelengths of 345 and 380 nm was measured using a Deltascan illumination system (Photon Technology International, London, ON, Canada) as described previously (21Weidema A.F. Dixon S.J. Sims S.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C1531-C1539Google Scholar). RANKL was applied locally to cells by pressure ejection from a micropipette. In some studies, cells were superfused with a Ca2+-free physiological buffer, supplemented with 0.5 mm EGTA. The whole cell patch clamp configuration was used to record membrane currents as described previously (22Weidema A.F. Barbera J. Dixon S.J. Sims S.M. J. Physiol. 1997; 503: 303-315Google Scholar). Electrode solution contained (in mm) KCl, 140; HEPES, 20; MgCl2, 1; EGTA, 0.1; adjusted to pH 7.2 with KOH; 280–290 mOsmol/liter. Pipette resistance before seal formation was 3–5 MΩ. Cells were superfused in physiological buffer at room temperature. Currents were recorded with Axopatch-1D amplifier, filtered, and digitized at 2–5 kHz using pClamp 6.0 (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). Osteoclasts on glass coverslips were incubated with or without RANKL in osteoclast culture medium at 37 °C and at the indicated times fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (10 min), washed in PBS (3× 5 min); permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS (10 min), washed in PBS (3× 5 min); and blocked with 1% normal goat serum in PBS (NGS) for 1–2 h at room temperature. Monoclonal antibody to p65 (catalog number sc-8008, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was diluted 1:100 in NGS and applied overnight at 4 °C, followed by washing in PBS and incubation for 2 h at room temperature with biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG (Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA) diluted 1:200 in NGS. After incubation (2 h, room temperature) with fluorescein-conjugated streptavidin (Vector Laboratories Inc.) (1:100 in NGS), coverslips were washed, mounted on slides with Vecta-Shield (Vector Laboratories Inc.), and examined using a Zeiss LSM 510 laser-scanning confocal microscope. We assessed localization of fluorescent label in all osteoclasts on each coverslip (usually 40–70 cells/coverslip). Osteoclasts were rated positive for nuclear localization if fluorescence intensity of one or more nuclei exceeded that of the cytoplasm. Data are presented as representative traces, as percentages of total cells tested, or as mean ± S.E. with sample size (n) indicating the number of osteoclasts for Ca2+ fluorescence or electrophysiology studies, or the number of separate cell preparations for immunofluorescence studies. Differences were assessed by one-way analysis of variance for correlated samples, followed by a Tukey or Bonferroni test and accepted as statistically significant at p < 0.05. Sigmoid curves were fit by nonlinear regression using Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). Error bars were omitted where they were smaller than the symbol. Rat osteoclasts were loaded with fura-2, and Ca2+ was monitored by microspectrofluorimetry. Osteoclasts had basal [Ca2+]i of 154 ± 4 nm(n = 118, mean ± S.E.). Osteoclasts responded to soluble RANKL with elevation of [Ca2+]i, which typically peaked and then declined slowly, even in the continued presence of RANKL. Upon washout of RANKL, [Ca2+]ireturned promptly to basal levels (Fig.1 A). Multiple [Ca2+]i transients could be elicited by successive applications of RANKL (Fig. 1 B), although the subsequent responses were slightly decreased in amplitude. No responses were observed when osteoclasts were stimulated with vehicle (n = 25). Moreover, OPG blocked the ability of RANKL to induce [Ca2+]i elevations in osteoclasts that were responsive to multiple applications of RANKL alone (n = 3). The proportion of osteoclasts responding to RANKL with elevation of [Ca2+]i was dependent on the concentration of RANKL (Fig. 1 C). [Ca2+]i elevations were elicited by concentrations of RANKL as low as 10 pg/ml. The maximum proportion of osteoclasts (∼60%) responded to RANKL at 10–100 ng/ml, with half-maximal effects at ∼0.1 ng/ml. When the amplitudes of the RANKL-induced Ca2+ transients were quantified, similar concentration dependence was observed (Fig.1 D). At concentrations of 10–100 ng/ml, RANKL elevated [Ca2+]i to peaks of 220 ± 30 nmabove basal (based on 15 responsive osteoclasts of 24 tested). We also assessed changes in Ca2+ upon application of RANKL to rat osteoclast precursors. Even at concentrations of 1 μg/ml, RANKL caused elevation of [Ca2+]i in only 3 of 27 osteoclast precursors tested, whereas 11 of 17 multinucleated osteoclasts, tested in the same preparations, responded with elevation of Ca2+. As a negative control, we tested the responses of spindle-shaped stromal cells and found that none of the 12 cells tested responded to RANKL. Thus, a proportion of osteoclast precursors responded to RANKL with elevation of [Ca2+]i, although the percentage of responsive precursors was significantly lower than that of mature osteoclasts. All subsequent studies were performed using multinucleated osteoclasts. We next investigated the source of Ca2+ contributing to RANKL-induced elevation of [Ca2+]i in osteoclasts. RANKL elicited Ca2+ elevations of comparable amplitude in Ca2+-containing and Ca2+-free extracellular solutions, consistent with release of Ca2+from intracellular stores (Fig. 2,A and B, n = 5). Ca2+release from stores often involves PLC-mediated production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. We have shown previously that the PLC inhibitorU73122 blocks P2Y nucleotide receptor-mediated elevation of [Ca2+]i in osteoclasts (21Weidema A.F. Dixon S.J. Sims S.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C1531-C1539Google Scholar). Treatment of osteoclasts with U73122 (1 μm for 10 min) abolished the RANKL-induced rise of [Ca2+]i, whereas RANKL still elicited [Ca2+]i elevations in the presence of the control compound U73343 or vehicle (Fig. 2, C andD, n = 5). Taken together, these data indicate that RANKL signals through PLC leading to release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores and transient elevation of [Ca2+]i. Our findings are in contrast to previous observations that RANKL caused sustained elevation of [Ca2+]i in osteoclasts (23Myers D.E. Collier F.M. Minkin C. Wang H. Holloway W.R. Malakellis M. Nicholson G.C. FEBS Lett. 1999; 463: 295-300Google Scholar). An independent approach was used to verify the effect of RANKL on [Ca2+]i in osteoclasts. Rat, rabbit, and human osteoclasts possess intermediate conductance Ca2+-dependent K+ channels (24Komarova S.V. Dixon S.J. Sims S.M. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2001; 7: 637-654Google Scholar). Because only a subpopulation of rat osteoclasts exhibits this current (22Weidema A.F. Barbera J. Dixon S.J. Sims S.M. J. Physiol. 1997; 503: 303-315Google Scholar), we used patch clamp techniques to monitor the effects of RANKL on membrane currents of rabbit osteoclasts, which all demonstrate the current (25Naemsch L.N. Weidema A.F. Sims S.M. Underhill T.M. Dixon S.J. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4425-4435Google Scholar). Cells were held at −30 mV and voltage ramp commands were applied every 2 s. RANKL (100 ng/ml) evoked outward current after a delay of ∼10 s (n = 6 out of 14 osteoclasts tested) with inward current apparent at −100 mV (Fig.3 A). Current-voltage (I-V) relationships were determined from the voltage ramp commands. Basal current prior to application of RANKL was dominated by the inwardly rectifying K+ current Kir2.1 that has been identified previously in osteoclasts (Fig. 3 B, Control). Subtraction of the control current from that recorded at the peak of the response to RANKL showed that the RANKL-induced current was linear and reversed close to −70 mV, indicating K+-selective current (Fig. 3 C). A similar, linear K+ current has been shown previously to closely follow elevations of [Ca2+]i in osteoclasts (22Weidema A.F. Barbera J. Dixon S.J. Sims S.M. J. Physiol. 1997; 503: 303-315Google Scholar). Thus, RANKL-induced current likely represents activation of Ca2+-dependent K+ channels because of rise of [Ca2+]i. Hence, the voltage-clamp data independently confirm that RANKL induces elevation of [Ca2+]i in osteoclasts. It was shown previously that RANKL prolongs osteoclast survival in vitro(26Lacey D.L. Tan H.L. Lu J. Kaufman S. Van G. Qiu W. Rattan A. Scully S. Fletcher F. Juan T. Kelley M. Burgess T.L. Boyle W.J. Polverino A.J. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 157: 435-448Google Scholar). We investigated the role of Ca2+ in this process using the intracellular Ca2+ chelator BAPTA. To establish conditions for effective buffering of Ca2+ by BAPTA, we used ATP, which activates P2Y nucleotide receptors on osteoclasts leading to release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores and reproducible elevation of [Ca2+]i (21Weidema A.F. Dixon S.J. Sims S.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C1531-C1539Google Scholar). Osteoclasts were stimulated with ATP (100 μm) to ensure their responsiveness, then treated with different concentrations of BAPTA-AM and rechallenged with ATP. We established that loading with 50 μm BAPTA-AM for 10 min at room temperature was optimal for suppressing elevation of [Ca2+]i induced by ATP (Fig. 4 A,n = 8). We then confirmed that, under these conditions, BAPTA was effective in preventing RANKL-induced elevation of [Ca2+]i (Fig. 4 B). To examine the role of [Ca2+]i in osteoclast survival, cells were treated with BAPTA-AM or vehicle. The medium was changed and osteoclasts were incubated with RANKL (100 ng/ml) or vehicle at 37 °C for 24 h. The number of osteoclasts per dish at 24 h was expressed as a percentage of the initial number of osteoclasts in the same dish. As expected, RANKL significantly increased the number of osteoclasts that survived 24 h (Fig.4 C, n = 4 independent experiments). BAPTA suppressed this effect of RANKL, but did not affect osteoclast survival in the absence of RANKL (Fig. 4 C). Thus, elevation of [Ca2+]i appears to be necessary for RANKL to promote osteoclast survival. NFκB is one of the major downstream effectors of RANK signaling and activation of NFκB enhances cell survival in many cell types (13Mak T.W. Yeh W.C. Arthritis Res. 2002; 4: S243-S252Google Scholar, 26Lacey D.L. Tan H.L. Lu J. Kaufman S. Van G. Qiu W. Rattan A. Scully S. Fletcher F. Juan T. Kelley M. Burgess T.L. Boyle W.J. Polverino A.J. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 157: 435-448Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated the possible involvement of the PLC/Ca2+ pathway in the nuclear translocation of NFκB in osteoclasts. Activation of NFκB was assessed at the single-cell level using immunofluorescence to monitor the spatial distribution of the p65 subunit of NFκB. In the majority of untreated rat or rabbit osteoclasts, NFκB was located in the cytoplasm for the duration of the experiment (Fig. 5 A,left). In a proportion of osteoclasts, RANKL induced redistribution of NFκB to the nuclei, most often to all the nuclei within a single osteoclast (Fig. 5 A, right). Nuclear translocation of NFκB was rapid (within 7 min after addition of RANKL) and transient, reversing within 60 min (Fig. 5 B). Maximal translocation was evident by 15 min, with 52 ± 4% of osteoclasts exhibiting nuclear localization of NFκB (n = 12 independent experiments), compared with 4 ± 1% in untreated osteoclasts (n = 7 independent experiments). To examine a role of the PLC signaling pathway, we determined the kinetics of RANKL-induced NFκB translocation in osteoclasts treated with the PLC inhibitor U73122, which prevents [Ca2+]i elevations induced by RANKL. U73122markedly delayed translocation of NFκB from the cytoplasm to the nuclei in response to RANKL. In U73122-treated cells, maximum translocation was delayed until 30 min following addition of RANKL (versus 15 min in parallel samples treated with RANKL alone) (Fig. 5 B). U73122 did not significantly affect the maximum proportion of osteoclasts exhibiting nuclear translocation of NFκB in response to RANKL (100 ng/ml) (47 ± 6% in controlversus 44 ± 5% in U73122-treated, based on parallel samples from six independent experiments). U73343, a closely related analog of U73122, which does not inhibit PLC or block RANKL-induced elevation of [Ca2+]i (Fig. 2, C andD), had no significant effect on RANKL-induced translocation of NFκB (Fig. 5 C). Thus, we provide evidence that RANKL signaling through PLC affects the kinetics of NFκB translocation. We next examined whether chelation of intracellular Ca2+ using BAPTA affected the kinetics of RANKL-induced translocation of NFκB. Using loading conditions established above, we found that BAPTA delayed nuclear translocation of NFκB induced by RANKL (Fig. 6, data based on parallel samples from seven independent experiments). In BAPTA-loaded osteoclasts, maximum translocation was observed 30–60 min following treatment with RANKL (100 ng/ml) versus 15–30 min in cells treated with RANKL alone. Loading of cells with BAPTA significantly reduced the proportion of osteoclasts exhibiting nuclear localization of NFκB at 15 min, whereas the proportion of cells exhibiting nuclear localization at 60 min was significantly increased (as indicated byasterisks in Fig. 6). Furthermore, BAPTA reduced the maximum proportion of osteoclasts exhibiting nuclear translocation of NFκB in response to treatment with RANKL (41 ± 6% for BAPTA-loaded osteoclasts versus 57 ± 5% for control osteoclasts). In the absence of RANKL, BAPTA did not significantly affect NFκB distribution (Fig. 6). Hydrolysis of BAPTA-AM results in release of small molecular weight products because of the degradation of the acetoxymethyl ester (AM) moieties. To determine whether these degradation products might affect NFκB translocation, we examined cells treated with calcein blue-AM (a compound that bears the same AM modification as BAPTA-AM, but is ineffective as a Ca2+ chelator at physiological [Ca2+]i). Loading cells with calcein blue did not affect the kinetics or degree of RANKL-induced NFκB translocation (Fig. 6, n = 3), arguing against possible nonspecific effects of the AM degradation products. Taken together, these data indicate that RANKL-induced elevation of [Ca2+]i accelerates nuclear translocation of NFκB. We examined the role of a Ca2+-regulated effector known to contribute to activation of NFκB in other systems, the Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent phosphatase, calcineurin. The calcineurin inhibitor, cyclosporin A (1 μm), applied 30 min before addition of RANKL, suppressed the initial NFκB translocation (7 min), with no significant effect at later times (15–30 min) (Fig. 7, data based on parallel samples from eight independent experiments). The structurally distinct calcineurin inhibitor, FK506, had similar effects. FK506 (10 nm) significantly suppressed RANKL-induced NFκB translocation at 7 min to 67 ± 7% of control, but had no significant effect at 15 min (94 ± 7% of control) (n = 8). These findings are consistent with RANKL-induced elevation of [Ca2+]i causing transient activation of calcineurin, which in turn accelerates activation of NFκB. PLC activation leads to the generation of 2 second messengers, Ca2+ and diacylglycerol, both of which contribute to activation of PKC. In other systems, PKC can activate IκB kinases, inducing translocation of NFκB (12Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Google Scholar). In osteoclasts, the PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide I (100 nm) applied 30 min before addition of RANKL suppressed NFκB translocation at 7 and 15 min (Fig. 7, data based on parallel samples from seven independent experiments), with no significant effect at 30 min. In contrast, the control compound, bisindolylmaleimide V (100 nm) that does not inhibit PKC, had no sign"
https://openalex.org/W2014613177,"Cerebellar LTD requires brief activation of PKC and is expressed as a functional downregulation of AMPA receptors. Modulation of vascular smooth-muscle contraction by G protein-coupled receptors (called Ca2+ sensitization) also involves PKC phosphorylation and activation of a specific inhibitor of myosin/moesin phosphatase (MMP). This inhibitor, called CPI-17, is also expressed in brain. Here, we tested the hypothesis that LTD, like Ca2+ sensitization, employs a PKC/CPI-17 cascade. Introduction of activated recombinant CPI-17 into cells produced a use-dependent attenuation of glutamate-evoked responses and occluded subsequent LTD. Moreover, the requirement for endogenous CPI-17 in LTD was demonstrated with neutralizing antibodies plus gene silencing by siRNA. These interventions had no effect on basal synaptic strength but blocked LTD induction. Thus, a biochemical circuit that involves PKC-mediated activation of CPI-17 modulates the distinct physiological processes of vascular contractility and cerebellar LTD."

SNARE complex formation juxtaposes synaptic vesicle and plasma membranes and thus may set the stage for vesicle membrane fusion. In the final stages of fusion, neurotransmitter release is probably regulated by the Ca2+-binding protein synaptotagmin (8Fernández-Chacón R. Königstorfer A. Gerber S.H. Garcia J. Matos M.F. Stevens C.F. Brose N. Rizo J. Rosenmund C. Südhof T.C. Nature. 2001; 410: 41-49Google Scholar). Each SNARE protein contains at least one core domain that binds to other SNARE proteins to form a four-helix bundle (8Fernández-Chacón R. Königstorfer A. Gerber S.H. Garcia J. Matos M.F. Stevens C.F. Brose N. Rizo J. Rosenmund C. Südhof T.C. Nature. 2001; 410: 41-49Google Scholar). This four-helix bundle is composed of 16 layers transverse to the helical axes including a buried ionic layer at the center of the four-helix bundle (9Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Google Scholar). The neuronal SNARE complex consists of three SNAREs: synaptobrevin, syntaxin, and SNAP-25 (Synaptosome-associatedprotein, 25 kDa) (Fig. 1). Synaptobrevin (also referred to as vesicle-associated membrane protein) is a 12-kDa protein with a SNARE binding domain and a single spanning transmembrane domain (10Trimble W.S. Scheller R.H. Trends Neurosci. 1988; 11: 241-242Google Scholar,11Baumert M. Maycox P.R. Navone F. De Camilli P. Jahn R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 379-384Google Scholar). Syntaxin is a 35-kDa protein with a three-helix bundle regulatory domain, a SNARE binding domain, and a single spanning transmembrane domain (1Söllner T. Bennett M.K. Whiteheart S.W. Scheller R.H. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1993; 75: 409-418Google Scholar, 3Bennett M.K. Calakos N. Scheller R.H. Science. 1992; 257: 255-259Google Scholar, 12Bennett M.K. Garcia-Arraras J.E. Elferink L.A. Peterson K.

SNAP-25 is a 25-kDa protein with two SNARE binding domains and a linker domain of ∼45 amino acids. SNAP-25 is targeted to the plasma membrane by its association with syntaxin via palmitoylation of three cysteine residues in the linker domain (14Oyler G.A. Higgins G.A. Hart R.A. Battenberg E.

The crystal structure of the neuronal SNARE complex revealed a conserved buried ionic layer at the center of the four-helix bundle (9Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Google Scholar) whose function is still uncertain (16Wei S. Xu T. Ashery U. Kollewe A. Matti U. Antonin W. Rettig J. Neher E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1279-1289Google Scholar). Most probably, it plays a role during N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) driven disassembly of the SNARE complex, because mutations of this central layer can disrupt this process (17Scales S.J. Yoo B.Y. Scheller R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14262-14267Google Scholar). Here we present the crystal structure of the neuronal SNARE complex at a 1.4-Å resolution. To obtain this high resolution crystal structure, the individual SNAREs were truncated in comparison with the corresponding constructs used in the previously published crystal structure solved at a 2.4-Å resolution (9Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Google Scholar). This high resolution structure reveals new sites of hydration and stabilizing intermolecular interactions. We further characterize the thermal stability of this SNARE complex by CD and SDS melts, its oligomerization state, and its binding properties to synaptotagmin in the presence of Ca2+ and EDTA. Constructs encoding sequences for the “minimal” complex (Fig. 1), rat syntaxin 1a residues 180–262 (SXa), synaptobrevin II residues 1–96 (SBa), SNAP-25 B residues 1–83 (SN1a), and SNAP-25 B residues 120–206 (SN2a) were described elsewhere (18Fasshauer D. Eliason W.K. Brunger A.T. Jahn R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10354-10362Google Scholar). The cDNA-encoding sequences for the N-terminally truncated minimal complex and the microcomplex (Fig. 1), rat syntaxin 1a residues 188–262 (SXb) and residues 191–256 (SXc), synaptobrevin II residues 25–96 (SBb) and residues 28–89 (SBc), SNAP-25 B residues 7–83 (SN1b), and SNAP-25 B residues 132–204 (SN2b) and 141–204 (SN2c) were subcloned from these constructs into the expression plasmid pET28a (Novagen) or pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences) (SN2b only). The cDNA encoding the sequence for rat synaptotagmin I-(139–421) were subcloned from synaptotagmin I cDNA into the pGEX-2T expression vector. The G374 sequence variant of synaptotagmin (19Ubach J. Lao Y. Fernandez I. Arac D. Südhof T.C. Rizo J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5854-5860Google Scholar) was generated using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using the oligomers 5′-TGTAACCAACGAAGACTTTGCCGATGGCGTCGTTCTTGCC-3′ and 5′-GGCAAGAACGACGCCATCGGCAAAGTCTTCGTTGGTTACA-3′. The correct sequences of all of the constructs were verified by DNA sequencing (Biocore Inc., Palo Alto, CA, or Keck facility, Yale University, New Haven, CT). The pET28a expression plasmids were transformed into E. coliBL21(DE3) competent cells using standard protocols (20Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Chanda V.B. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 1. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1998: 1.1-1.8Google Scholar). Cells were grown at 37 °C in a BIOFLO 3000 fermentor (New Brunswick, NJ) using ECPYM1 medium (21Coligan J.E. Dunn B.M. Ploegh H.L. Speicher D.W. Wingfield P.T. Current Protocols in Protein Science. 1. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2000: 5.1-5.3Google Scholar) in the presence of 50 μg/ml kanamycin sulfate. The expression was induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at anA 600 of 20. The pGEX-2T expression plasmids were transformed into E. coli BL21-competent cells using standard protocols. Cells were grown at 37 °C in terrific broth supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin media in 4-liter flasks. At an A 600 of ∼1, the temperature was reduced to 25 °C and expression was induced for 3 h using 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Approximately 3 h after induction, cells were harvested by centrifugation for 20 min at 4200 rpm in a Beckman J6-HC Centrifuge using a JS-4.2 rotor. Cells were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Cells containing histidine-tagged SNARE proteins were resuspended in 1:10 denaturing lysis buffer (7 m guanidine, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.2, 10 mm imidazole) and passed once through a Microfluidizer (Microfluidics) at 25,000 p.s.i. Cell lysate was cleared by ultracentrifugation in a Beckman Optima XL-100K Centrifuge using a type 45 rotor at 45,000 rpm for 45 min. Cleared lysate was loaded in bulk for 10 h onto 25-ml nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen). The column was washed with 10-column volumes of denaturing wash buffer (6 m guanidine, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.2, 20 mm imidazole) followed by 10-column volumes of native buffer (300 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.7, 20 mm imidazole). The protein was then eluted with 3-column volumes of native buffer containing imidazole at 250 mm. Cells containing glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged synaptotagmin I C2AB and SN2b were resuspended in 300 mm NaCl, 50 mmNaH2PO4, 50 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, 1 mg/ml pepstatin, 10 mm benzamidine, and 100 mg/ml DNase. Cells were lysed by disruption using a Microfluidizer with two passes at 25,000 p.s.i. Cell lysate was cleared by ultracentrifugation in a Beckman Optima XL-100K Centrifuge using a type 45 rotor at 45,000 rpm for 45 min. Cleared lysate was loaded in bulk for 4 h onto 25 ml of glutathione resin (Amersham Biosciences) and washed with 10-column volumes of buffer. Protein was eluted with 15 mm glutathione and dialyzed overnight into 200 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES pH 7.8, 5 mm DTT, and 1 mm EDTA. Synaptotagmin was further purified using fast protein liquid cation exchange chromatography over a Mono S 10/10 column (Amersham Biosciences). The concentration of the proteins was calculated by using a Bradford assay or UV absorption at 280 nm. UV spectra demonstrated that synaptotagmin was free of the DNA contamination mentioned elsewhere (19Ubach J. Lao Y. Fernandez I. Arac D. Südhof T.C. Rizo J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5854-5860Google Scholar). The SNARE complex was formed by mixing SNAP-25, synaptobrevin, and syntaxin fragments at a 1:1:1:1 ratio, mixed with 4 m urea to prevent precipitation, and dialyzed into 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.2, and 1 mm CaCl2 at 4.0 °C. Thrombin was added after 4 h to remove the histidine tags from the proteins, and dialysis was continued for 10 h. SNARE complex was purified on a Mono Q 10/10 anion exchange column where it eluted between 230 and 330 mm NaCl. Final size exclusion purification was performed using a Superdex 200 16/60 column (Amersham Biosciences). The purity of the SNARE complex was assayed by SDS-PAGE using Phast gels (Amersham Biosciences) and Coomassie Blue staining. Final fractions containing completely formed SNARE complex were pooled, and the protein concentration was determined by UV absorption at 280 nm. The complex was flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. CD experiments were performed on a Aviv 62DS spectrometer at 150 mm NaCl, 20 mmNa2HPO4, pH 7.8, and 10 μm SNARE complex. Temperature scans were performed between 37 and 97 °C at two-degree intervals with 1-min equilibration between temperature changes and 1-min acquisitions with data averaging at each temperature point. GST pull-down experiments were performed at room temperature in 150 mm NaCl with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, and 1 mm DTT in the presence of either 0.5 mm CaCl2 or 1 mmEDTA. Samples were mixed at room temperature, incubated for 1 h with GST beads, and washed three times with buffer and mixed with SDS sample loading buffer. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using 10–25% SDS Phast gels. Size exclusion chromatography was performed using a Superdex 200 10/30 column at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Measurements were performed in 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, and 5 mm DTT. The elution profile was monitored by UV absorption at 280 nm, light scattering at 690 nm, and differential refractometry. Light scattering and differential refractometry were carried out using the Dawn and OptiLab instruments (Wyatt Technology). Analysis was carried out using the Astra software (22Wyatt P. Anal. Chim. Acta. 1993; 272: 1-40Google Scholar). For each sample, 100 μl of protein at 1 mg/ml protein was loaded. The differential refractive index increment (dn/dc) is fairly constant for proteins and was set to 0.185. Crystallization trials were conducted using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. The initial SNARE protein concentration was 9 mg/ml in a solution of 200 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES (Fluka), pH 7.8, and 5 mmDTT (American BioAnalytical). Crystals appeared at 4 °C in 1–3 days and grew to full size in 3–5 days. The well solution contained 15–20% (±)-2-methyl-2,4-pentanediole (MPD) (Fluka), 75–125 mm CaCl2 (Fluka), and 50 mm MES (Fluka) at pH 5.0–6.0. Initial drops consisted of a one-to-one mixture of protein sample and well solution resulting in a total volume of 4 μl. The crystals grew in clusters as thick needles. To obtain single crystals, these clusters of crystals were used for streak seeding into preequilibrated hanging drops. Single crystals were prepared for freezing by serial transfer using nylon loops into mother liquor with increasing amounts of MPD as a cryoprotectant up to 55%. Crystals were then frozen by rapid transfer directly into liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were collected at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory Advanced Light Source beamline BL 8.2.1 from a single crystal in one pass at 100 K using an Area Detector System Quantum 210 2 × 2 CCD detector. The diffraction data were collected to a 1.4-Å resolution. All of the data processing was carried out using the programs Denzo and Scalepack (23Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-325PubMed Google Scholar). Statistics of the diffraction data are shown in Table I.

The subsequent translation function used diffraction data from 15 to 4.0-Å resolution and resulted in an unambiguous solution. The search model consisted of one of the three non-crystallographically related copies of the neuronal SNARE solved at 2.4 Å (9Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Google Scholar). It was truncated to contain only those residues present in the microcomplex. Model building was performed using the program O (26Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Google Scholar). The initial model was optimized by rigid body refinement followed by simulated annealing with torsion angle dynamics (27Rice L.M. Brunger A.T. Proteins. 1994; 19: 277-290Google Scholar), restrained B-value refinement (28Hendrickson W.A. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 115: 252-270Google Scholar), and conjugate gradient minimization using the MLF target function (29Adams P.D. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Brunger A.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5018-5023Google Scholar). Overall anisotropic scale factors and bulk solvent correction were applied to the diffraction data. The progress of model rebuilding and refinement was monitored by cross-validation usingR free (30Brunger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-475Google Scholar), which was computed from a randomly chosen test set comprising 10% of the data. The sites of hydration were placed by inspection of peaks larger than three standard deviations above the mean in F o −F c ςA-weighted electron density maps. Only those sites were kept that exhibited reasonable protein solvent hydrogen-bonding distances without steric conflict and whoseB-value refined to <55 Å2. MPD and Ca2 + were identified by inspection of F o −F c and 2F o −F c ςA-weighted electron density maps. At various points during refinement, ςA-weighted, annealed 2F o − F c composite omit maps were used to minimize the effects of model bias. All of the refinements were carried out using the program CNS (25Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J.

Eliason W.K. Brunger A.T. Jahn R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10354-10362Google Scholar). The minimal SNARE complex obtained by limited proteolysis that was used in the 2.4-Å crystal structure had an apparent molecular mass of 60–90 kDa compared with a calculated molecular mass of 41 kDa (18Fasshauer D. Eliason W.K. Brunger A.T. Jahn R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10354-10362Google Scholar). The C-terminal truncations of synaptobrevin by botulinum toxin B or tetanus toxin produced a monomeric SNARE complex (34Margittai M. Fasshauer D. Pabst S. Jahn R. Langen R. J. Biol.

Furthermore, the C-terminal truncation of endobrevin (vesicle-associated membrane protein 8) in the endosomal SNARE complex produced a monodisperse sample (35Antonin W. Holroyd C. Tikkanen R. Honing S. Jahn R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3289-3298Google Scholar). Therefore, we truncated the neuronal synaptobrevin at Trp-89 along with the appropriate truncations of syntaxin and SNAP-25 (Fig.1). These truncations resulted in the removal of approximately one α-helical turn at the C-terminal ends of syntaxin and synaptobrevin (Fig. 1). The truncated neuronal SNARE proteins were then expressed, purified, and assembled. This “micro”-SNARE complex has an apparent molecular mass of 32.5 kDa ± 2% as determined by MALLS (data not shown) compared with a calculated molecular mass of 32.5 kDa. Thus, the microcomplex is both monomeric and monodisperse. We performed temperature-dependent SDS and CD melts of the micro-SNARE complex and compared the results to both the minimal SNARE complex (36Fasshauer D. Sutton R.B. Brunger A.T. Jahn R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15781-15786Google Scholar) and a SNARE complex that was obtained from the minimal complex by truncation at the N terminus (Fig. 2). Our experiments revealed a roughly 20 °C reduction in the stability of the micro-SNARE complex in SDS relative to both the minimal and N-terminally truncated SNARE complexes (Fig. 2 a). In light of this reduction in SDS stability, we further investigated the thermal stability of the various SNARE complexes under native conditions by CD. Both the minimal and the N-terminally truncated SNARE complexes have aT m of 94 °C, whereas the micro-SNARE complex has a reduced T m of 89 °C (Fig.2 b). Having demonstrated that the micro-SNARE complex forms a quantitative and stable complex, albeit with somewhat reduced T m, we investigated whether it would retain its ability to interact with the C2 domains of synaptotagmin I. GST pull-down experiments were conducted in the presence of both 1 mm EDTA and 0.5 mmCaCl2. As shown in Fig. 3, synaptotagmin I is capable of binding the micro-SNARE complex in both the presence and absence of Ca2+. These findings are consistent with prior reports using the C2AB domain of synaptotagmin III and the minimal SNARE complex (37Sutton R.B. Ernst J.A. Brunger A.T. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 589-598Google Scholar). We next determined the crystal structure of the microcomplex. Crystals were obtained in space group P212121 in the presence of MPD and CaCl2 at 4 °C. These conditions are similar to the previous crystallization conditions used for the minimal SNARE complex (9Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Google Scholar). The crystal structure contained only one copy of the complex per asymmetric unit in contrast to the minimal SNARE complex that crystallized in a different space group (I222) with three complexes per asymmetric unit. Most importantly, the crystals of the microcomplex diffracted to 1.4 Å, making this the highest resolution crystal structure of a SNARE complex available to date. All of the residues of the microcomplex were visible in the final model, which refined to aR cryst value of 19.8% and aR free value of 22.4%. The statistics of the diffraction data and the final refined model are shown in Tables I andII. The electron density maps are of excellent quality (Fig. 5 b) and allowed assignments of nearly all of the side-chain rotamers.Table IIRefinement statisticsSpace groupP212121Unit cell dimensionsa = 39.963 Å, b = 51.653 Å, c = 134.407 Åα = β = γ = 90°Resolution range34.13–1.45 ÅNo. reflection in working set43,726No. reflection in test set4783R cryst (%)0.198R free (%)0.224Ramanchandran plot (%)Most favored98.8Additionally allowed0.8Generously allowed0.4Disallowed0.0No. protein atoms2206No. water atoms322Average B-factor (Å2)27.8 Open table in a new tab Three Ca2+ sites were found that are coordinated by symmetry-related molecules. These sites were visible as 8 ς peaks in 2F o − F c maps. The coordinating oxygen atoms are located on SNAP-25 Gln-20 and Glu-27 of a SNARE complex and synaptobrevin Asp-80, Lys-83 of SNAP-25, Tyr-88, Trp-89, and syntaxin Lys-256 of a symmetry-related complex. Several water molecules complete the coordination spheres around the Ca2+. Because these Ca2+ sites are located at the artificially truncated C terminus of the microcomplex, it is probable that these binding sites are the result of crystallization conditions. As expected, the micro-SNARE complex forms a four-helix bundle. The Cα atoms of the microcomplex were superimposed on that of the minimal complex structure and on all of the homologous residues of the endosomal complex structure. The results of these superpositions are shown in Fig. 4, a andb, and Table III. It is interesting to note that the root mean square (r.m.s) difference between the microcomplex structure and the endosomal structure is larger than the root mean square difference observed when comparing either structure to the minimal complex structure. In contrast to the endosomal structure, the microcomplex displays little variation inB-values over most of the four-helix bundle (see Fig.4 c). Only the second α-helix of SNAP-25 between layers 2 and 8 and synaptobrevin between layers −7 and 0 display any systematic increase in Cα B-values.Table IIICα superpositionsStructure 1Structure 2Cα r.m.s.d.(Å)MicrocomplexEndosomal complex1.619MicrocomplexMinimal complex0.947 (Molecule 1)0.724 (Molecule 2)1.139 (Molecule 3)Endosomal complexMinimal complex1.187 (Molecule 1)1.270 (Molecule 2)1.087 (Molecule 3)Superposition was carried out for the neuronal structures (minimal complex and microcomplex) using synaptobrevin residues 31–84, syntaxin residues 196–255, and SNAP-25 residues 23–78 and 147–200, and superposition was carried out for the endosomal structure using endobrevin residues 11–64, syntaxin 7 residues 169–228, vti1b residues 140–195, and syntaxin-8 residues 152–205. r.m.s.d., root mean square difference. Open table in a new tab Superposition was carried out for the neuronal structures (minimal complex and microcomplex) using synaptobrevin residues 31–84, syntaxin residues 196–255, and SNAP-25 residues 23–78 and 147–200, and superposition was carried out for the endosomal structure using endobrevin residues 11–64, syntaxin 7 residues 169–228, vti1b residues 140–195, and syntaxin-8 residues 152–205. r.m.s.d., root mean square difference. To further compare the various SNARE complex crystal structures, we superimposed the residues around the ionic central layer (Fig. 1) with the corresponding residues of the previously solved structures. For the neuronal SNAREs, the layer consists of synaptobrevin Arg-56, syntaxin Gln-226, SNAP-25 Gln-53, and SNAP-25 Gln-174. For the endosomal complex, the corresponding residues are endobrevin Arg-76, syntaxin-7 Gln-199, vti1b Gln-170, and syntaxin-8 Gln-179. The root mean square differences for residues at this layer between the microcomplex and the endosomal complex are 0.315 and 0.509 Å for Cα and all atoms, respectively. Several of the SNARE crystal structures show the presence of a bifurcated hydrogen bond between synaptobrevin Arg-56 and SNAP-25 Gln-53 and Gln-174 (Fig.5 a). However, in one of the molecules of the minimal complex crystal structure (Fig. 5 a,cyan), Arg-56 exhibits a rotamer that allows direct hydrogen bonding from each of the side-chain nitrogen atoms of Arg-56 to each of the buried glutamines. This Arg-56 rotamer is also visible in the structure of the squid neuronal SNARE complex with complexin (38Bracher A. Kadlec J. Betz H. Weissenhorn W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26517-26523Google Scholar). Thus, Arg-56 exhibits significant conformational variability among the different structures, whereas the three glutamines exhibit very similar conformations (Fig. 5 a). The observed conformational variability of the central layer may suggest a possible functional role in the disassembly process (39Scales S.J. Finley M.F. Scheller R.H. Science. 2001; 294: 1015-1016Google Scholar). The quality of our diffraction data allowed us to assign numerous sites of hydration that were previously unobservable (Fig. 5 b). Of particular interest is a buried water molecule (Fig. 5 b,H 2 O 89) at the ionic central layer. This water molecule is located 3.10 Å from the ε-nitrogen of Arg-56, satisfying the hydrogen bond requirements of this nitrogen. It is possible that this water molecule is not present when Arg-56 adopts alternate conformations observed in some of the other crystal structures. The formation of salt bridges on the surface of proteins is known to stabilize exposed structural elements. The presence of surface salt bridges positioned to stabilize buried structural elements is less common. However, a carboxylic acid ε-oxygen of SNAP-25 Glu-170 shows just such an interaction buttressing SNAP-25 Gln-174 at 2.79 Å through the Gln-174 ε-nitrogen (Fig. 5 b). This interaction stabilizes the SNAP-25 Gln-174 ε-oxygen, which in turn interacts with synaptobrevin Arg-56 Nη2 at a distance of 2.65 Å (Fig.5 b). The close interaction of synaptobrevin Arg-56 Nη2 with the SNAP-25 Gln-174 ε-oxygen as compared with the Arg-56 Nη1 and syntaxin Gln-226 interaction probably reflects the proximity of the negatively charged carboxylic group from SNAP-25 Glu-170. We note further that SNAP-25 Glu-170 is a highly conserved residue in the SNAP-25 family, including the endosomal SNARE syntaxin-8. The neuronal SNARE complex can form oligomers under various conditions (18Fasshauer D. Eliason W.K. Brunger A.T. Jahn R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10354-10362Google Scholar, 44Hua Y. Scheller R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8065-8070Google Scholar). We have shown that C-terminal truncation of synaptobrevin, C-terminal to residue 89 (see Fig. 1), along with C-terminal truncation of syntaxin produces a SNARE complex that is both monomeric and monodisperse. Interestingly, the fragments of synaptobrevin containing residues 77–90 bind to phospholipids (40Quetglas S. Iborra C. Sasakawa N. De Haro L. Kumakura K. Sato K. Leveque C. Seagar M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3970-3979Google Scholar,41Quetglas S. Leveque C. Miquelis R. Sato K. Seagar M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9695-9700Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that some of the residues that are involved in phospholipids binding are also involved in oligomerization. We have shown that C-terminal truncation but not N-terminal truncation of the minimal SNARE complex results in a reduction in stability as measured by CD and SDS thermal melts. Other investigators have used SDS stability to characterize various combinations of SNARE proteins (42Foster L.J. Yeung B. Mohtashami M. Ross K. Trimble W.S. Klip A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11089-11096Google Scholar). Thus, considering the influence on stability by the C-terminal end of the SNARE complex, a comparison of SDS stability should be viewed with caution when comparing the stabilities of various SNARE combinations. Our finding that the microcomplex retains the ability to bind synaptotagmin is particularly noteworthy in view of the recent discovery of DNA contaminants and sequence mutations in earlier binding studies with synaptotagmin I C2AB (19Ubach J. Lao Y. Fernandez I. Arac D. Südhof T.C. Rizo J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5854-5860Google Scholar). Thus, SNARE binding by synaptotagmin is independent of oligomerization of the SNARE complex. Through C-terminal truncation, we obtained a microcomplex that allowed us to solve the structure of the SNARE complex at near atomic resolution. The structure confirmed many of the observations that we reported in our previous 2.4-Å structure (9Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Google Scholar). The structure also revealed several new details of the SNARE complex. The existence of alternate conformations of the buried arginine at the ionic central layer is consistent with a function for this layer in NSF-mediated disassembly of the SNARE complex (17Scales S.J. Yoo B.Y. Scheller R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14262-14267Google Scholar). Previously, unobservable interactions included a buried water molecule and a salt bridge that were likely to play an important role in stabilizing the ionic central layer (Fig. 5 b). Such structural details offer important new information for the design of future experiments to study SNARE complex function. We thank B. S. DeLeBarre for assistance with MALLS, B. S. DeLeBarre, M.

https://openalex.org/W2002556148,"Membrane-associated guanylate kinase homologues (MAGUKs) are generally found under the plasma membrane of cell-cell contact sites and function as scaffolding proteins by linking cytoskeletal and signaling molecules to transmembrane receptors. The correct targeting of MAGUKs is essential for their receptor-clustering function; however, the molecular mechanism of their intracellular transport is unknown. Here, we show that the guanylate kinase-like domain of human discs large protein binds directly within the amino acids 607–831 of the stalk domain of GAKIN, a kinesin-like protein of broad distribution. The primary structure of the binding segment, termed MAGUK binding stalk domain, is conserved inDrosophila kinesin-73 and some other motor and non-motor proteins. This stalk segment is not found in GKAP, a synaptic protein that interacts with the guanylate kinase-like domain, and unlike GKAP, the binding of GAKIN is not regulated by the intramolecular interactions within the discs large protein. The recombinant motor domain of GAKIN is an active microtubule-stimulated ATPase withk cat = 45 s−1,K 0.5 (MT) = 0.1 μm. Overexpression of green fluorescent protein-fused GAKIN in Madin-Darby canine kidney epithelial cells induced long projections with both GAKIN and endogenous discs large accumulating at the tip of these projections. Importantly, the accumulation of endogenous discs large was eliminated when a mutant GAKIN lacking its motor domain was overexpressed under similar conditions. Taken together, our results indicate that discs large is a cargo molecule of GAKIN and suggest a mechanism for intracellular trafficking of MAGUK-laden vesicles to specialized membrane sites in mammalian cells.

Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 382-384Google Scholar). They are thought to play scaffolding functions at specialized membrane sites, such as synaptic membrane, tight junction, and adherens junction (2Fanning A.S. Anderson J.M. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1999; 11: 432-439Google Scholar, 3Garner C.C. Nash J. Huganir R.L. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 274-280Google Scholar, 4Hung A.Y. Sheng M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5699-5702Google Scholar).Drosophila Dlg is a MAGUK encoded by lethal (1Anderson J.M. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 382-384Google Scholar) discs large-1 tumor-suppressor gene (dlg), and mutations ofdlg cause neoplastic overgrowth of the imaginal discs (5Woods D.F. Bryant P.J. Cell. 1991; 66: 451-464Google Scholar). The Dlg protein localizes to the septate junctions in epithelial cells where it regulates cell proliferation, apical-basal cell polarity, and the organization of junctional structure (6Woods D.F. Hough C. Peel D. Callaini G. Bryant P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1469-1482Google Scholar, 7Hough C.D. Woods D.F. Park S. Bryant P.J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3242-3253Google Scholar, 8Budnik V. Koh Y.H. Guan B. Hartmann B. Hough C. Woods D. Gorczyca M. Neuron. 1996; 17: 627-640Google Scholar). The human homologue ofDrosophila Dlg, termed hDlg, and its rat counterpart SAP97, localize at the pre- and postsynaptic membrane sites as well as the basolateral membrane of epithelial cells (9Lue R.A. Marfatia S.M. Branton D. Chishti A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9818-9822Google Scholar, 10Muller B.M. Kistner U. Veh R.W. Cases-Langhoff C. Becker B. Gundelfinger E.D. Garner C.C. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 2354-2366Google Scholar) and are proposed to perform scaffolding functions by linking cytoskeletal components to the transmembrane proteins (11Marfatia S.M. Morais Cabral J.H. Lin L. Hough C. Bryant P.J. Stolz L. Chishti A.H. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 753-766Google Scholar). In addition to the scaffolding function, mounting evidence now indicates that hDlg regulates cell proliferation and could be involved in tumorigenesis. For example, hDlg interacts with viral oncoproteins such as high-risk human papillomavirus E6 and human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) Tax (12Lee S.S. Weiss R.S. Javier R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6670-6675Google Scholar, 13Kiyono T. Hiraiwa A. Fujita M. Hayashi Y. Akiyama T. Ishibashi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11612-11616Google Scholar, 14Suzuki T. Ohsugi Y. Uchida-Toita M. Akiyama T. Yoshida M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5967-5972Google Scholar). Similarly, hDlg forms a complex with adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor suppressor gene product and negatively regulates cell cycle progression (15Matsumine A. Ogai A. Senda T. Okumura N. Satoh K. Baeg G.H. Kawahara T. Kobayashi S. Okada M. Toyoshima K. Akiyama T. Science. 1996; 272: 1020-1023Google Scholar, 16Ishidate T. Matsumine A. Toyoshima K. Akiyama T. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 365-372Google Scholar). The mechanism of how hDlg regulates cell proliferation is still largely unknown.Recently, we identified GAKIN (guanylate kinase-associated kinesin), which is also classified as human KIF13B (17Miki H. Setou M. Kaneshiro K. Hirokawa N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7004-7011Google Scholar), from Jurkat T lymphoma cells as a binding partner for the GUK domain of hDlg (18Hanada T. Lin L. Tibaldi E.V. Reinherz E.L. Chishti A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28774-28784Google Scholar). In T cells, hDlg interacts with tyrosine kinase Lck and potassium channel Kv1.3 (19Hanada T. Lin L. Chandy K.G. Oh S.S. Chishti A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26899-26904Google Scholar) and translocates to the immune synapse-like structure upon cross-linking of cell surface CD2 molecules (18Hanada T. Lin L. Tibaldi E.V. Reinherz E.L. Chishti A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28774-28784Google Scholar). These observations suggest that hDlg might play a role in the formation of physical contacts between T cells and antigen-presenting cells and regulate activation of T cells during immune response. An intriguing possibility emerges suggesting the role of GAKIN in the transport of hDlg to the immune synapse upon activation of T cells. Since transcripts of GAKIN and hDlg are ubiquitously expressed, it is conceivable that GAKIN-dependent trafficking is a widespread mechanism across species and tissues for the transport of hDlg and other MAGUKs. Consistent with this paradigm is the recent evidence indicating a role of soluble adaptor proteins in the transport of cargo vesicles via kinesin-like motors. For example, KIF17 motor interacts with mLin-10, which in turn mediates its interaction with the cargo vesicles containing NMDA receptor subunits (20Setou M. Nakagawa T. Seog D.H. Hirokawa N. Science. 2000; 288: 1796-1802Google Scholar). Similarly, KIF13A motor binds to a subunit of AP-1 complex mediating its interaction with the vesicles containing mannose-6-phosphate receptor (21Nakagawa T. Setou M. Seog D. Ogasawara K. Dohmae N. Takio K. Hirokawa N. Cell. 2000; 103: 569-581Google Scholar). Conventional kinesin, via its light chain, binds to c-Jun N-terminal kinase-interacting proteins that mediate interaction with specific cargo vesicles (22Verhey K.J. Meyer D. Deehan R. Blenis J. Schnapp B.J. Rapoport T.A. Margolis B. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 959-970Google Scholar). Since hDlg is a soluble scaffolding protein, it can in principle link cargo vesicles to an intracellular motor, and therefore this property fits well with the common paradigm of being a motor-cargo adaptor molecule.The guanylate kinase-like domains of MAGUKs exhibit little or no guanylate kinase activity (23Kuhlendahl S. Spangenberg O. Konrad M. Kim E. Garner C.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 252: 305-313Google Scholar), and their principal function seems to serve as a protein-protein interaction motif (18Hanada T. Lin L. Tibaldi E.V. Reinherz E.L. Chishti A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28774-28784Google Scholar, 24Kim E. Naisbitt S. Hsueh Y.P. Rao A. Rothschild A. Craig A.M. Sheng M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 669-678Google Scholar). Besides GAKIN, several proteins are reported to interact with the GUK domains of MAGUKs. These GUK-binders include GKAP (GUK-associated protein) (24Kim E. Naisbitt S. Hsueh Y.P. Rao A. Rothschild A. Craig A.M. Sheng M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 669-678Google Scholar), MAP1A (microtubule-associated protein 1A) (25Brenman J.E. Topinka J.R. Cooper E.C. McGee A.W. Rosen J. Milroy T. Ralston H.J. Bredt D.S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 8805-8813Google Scholar), BEGAIN (brain-enriched guanylate kinase-associated protein) (26Deguchi M. Hata Y. Takeuchi M. Ide N. Hirao K. Yao I. Irie M. Toyoda A. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26269-26272Google Scholar), a Rap specific GTPase-activating protein SPAR (27Pak D.T. Yang S. Rudolph-Correia S. Kim E. Sheng M. Neuron. 2001; 31: 289-303Google Scholar), and protein kinase A-anchoring protein AKAP79 (28Colledge M. Dean R.A. Scott G.K. Langeberg L.K. Huganir R.L. Scott J.D. Neuron. 2000; 27: 107-119Google Scholar). At this stage, it is not clear how a single GUK domain binds to so many seemingly non-related proteins and how these interactions are regulated. Recent determination of the crystal structures of PSD-95 revealed the existence of a novel mode of intramolecular interactions between the SH3 and GUK domains, providing a new perspective on the functional regulation of hDlg interactions (29McGee A.W. Dakoji S.R. Olsen O. Bredt D.S. Lim W.A. Prehoda K.E. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1291-1301Google Scholar, 30Tavares G.A. Panepucci E.H. Brunger A.T. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1313-1325Google Scholar, 31McGee A.W.

Interestingly, the binding of GKAP to the GUK domain of SAP97 is regulated by a series of intramolecular interactions between the SH3 and GUK domains (33Wu H. Reissner C. Kuhlendahl S. Coblentz B. Reuver S. Kindler S. Gundelfinger E.D. Garner C.C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5740-5751Google Scholar). The PDZ domains regulate MAP1A binding to the GUK domain intramolecularly, although their mechanism of regulation seems distinct from that of GKAP (25Brenman J.E. Topinka J.R. Cooper E.C. McGee A.W. Rosen J. Milroy T. Ralston H.J. Bredt D.S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 8805-8813Google Scholar). In this manuscript, we provide evidence for the existence of a novel protein-binding domain that links GAKIN to the GUK domain of hDlg. The binding mode between GAKIN and hDlg appears to be distinct from that of GKAP binding to hDlg/SAP97. Our results also suggest that GAKIN mediates intracellular trafficking of Dlg in epithelial cells.DISCUSSIONHuman Dlg protein and its rat orthologue SAP97 are localize at specialized membrane regions where cells form contacts such as the synaptic membrane in neuronal cells (10Muller B.M.

Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1071-1080Google Scholar), and contact sites between T lymphocyte and antigen-presenting cells (18Hanada T. Lin L. Tibaldi E.V. Reinherz E.L. Chishti A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28774-28784Google Scholar). In contrast, hDlg/SAP97 is present predominantly in the cytoplasm and appears to attach to intracellular membranes in cells that do not display cell-cell contacts (43Reuver S.M. Garner C.C. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1071-1080Google Scholar, 44Tiffany A.M. Manganas L.N. Kim E. Hsueh Y.-P. Sheng M. Trimmer J.S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 147-157Google Scholar). In addition to the PDZ domains that link hDlg to the cytoplasmic domains of transmembrane receptors (4Hung A.Y. Sheng M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5699-5702Google Scholar), the primary structure of hDlg contains multiple protein-protein interaction domains that interact with cytoskeletal components and signaling molecules (9Lue R.A. Marfatia S.M. Branton D. Chishti A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9818-9822Google Scholar, 19Hanada T. Lin L. Chandy K.G. Oh S.S. Chishti A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26899-26904Google Scholar). These multiple protein interactions presumably permit hDlg to function as a scaffolding protein by forming large protein complexes at the interface of the membrane-cytoskeleton (11Marfatia S.M. Morais Cabral J.H. Lin L. Hough C. Bryant P.J. Stolz L. Chishti A.H. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 753-766Google Scholar). A major remaining issue of fundamental importance pertains to the mechanism of hDlg trafficking and its delivery to specialized sites. Our original identification of GAKIN was made by virtue of its association with the GUK domain of hDlg in the context of whole cell lysate (18Hanada T. Lin L. Tibaldi E.V. Reinherz E.L. Chishti A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28774-28784Google Scholar), therefore a possibility remained that the GAKIN-hDlg interaction might not be direct. In this manuscript, we demonstrate that GAKIN interacts directly with the GUK domain of hDlg (Fig. 1). A unique feature of this interaction is the unusual location of the hDlg-binding region within the stalk domain of GAKIN. The traditional view of kinesin motors implies that their globular C-terminal tails usually serve as the cargo binding modules (45Klopfenstein D.R. Vale R.D. Rogers S.L. Cell. 2000; 103: 537-540Google Scholar). However, in the case of GAKIN, the MBS domain that binds to hDlg is located within the N-terminal half of GAKIN downstream of its N-terminal motor domain (Fig. 2). Thus, the C-terminal half of GAKIN with a single copy of CAP-Gly domain either serves a regulatory region for cargo binding and/or binds to distinct cargo molecules. It is noteworthy here other intracellular motors, such as the Rab6-binding kinesin Rab6-KIFL, have been speculated to harbor cargo-binding domains in their coiled-coil regions (46Hill E. Clarke M. Barr F.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5711-5719Google Scholar). In any case, the presence of the MBS domain in a variety of motor and non-motor proteins suggests that this region might represent a novel cargo-binding motif with implications in linking soluble adaptors to motor proteins within the scaffolding complex. For example, the KIF13A motor transports cargo vesicles via its C-terminal tail that interacts with β1-adaptin and mannose-6-phosphate receptor (21Nakagawa T. Setou M. Seog D. Ogasawara K. Dohmae N. Takio K. Hirokawa N. Cell. 2000; 103: 569-581Google Scholar). Our identification of the MBS domain in KIF13A raises the possibility that these motors could potentially bind additional cargoes within their long stalk domains. Similarly, the presence of two MBS domains in RIM-BP1 also implicates recruitment of additional proteins in the assembly of RIM and Rab3-based trafficking machinery in the brain (38Wang Y. Sugita S. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20033-20044Google Scholar). In summary, our mapping data on the direct interaction between hDlg and GAKIN reveals a novel protein-binding domain that could mediate similar interactions with a large number of GUK domain proteins.The MBS domain of GAKIN does not share any sequence similarity with proteins that bind to the GUK domains of MAGUKs. Indeed, our results indicate that binding of GAKIN to the GUK domain of hDlg is not regulated by intramolecular interactions of the SH3 and GUK domains (Fig. 3). Based on our observation that GKAP competes with the MBS domain of GAKIN for binding to the GUK domain of hDlg (Fig. 4), we speculate on a model that offers an explanation for at least one function of the intramolecular interactions of MAGUKs. According to this model, the MBS domain of GAKIN interacts with a “folded” state of hDlg in the cytoplasm and transports it to specialized membrane sites. This folded and thus closed state of hDlg does not permit binding with other GUK domain binders such as GKAP. Once the hDlg cargo reaches the target membrane sites, other membrane and protein interactions “unfold” the closed SH3-GUK conformation thus permitting the transfer of hDlg to another GUK domain binder such as GKAP. The final assembly of the mature scaffolding complex occurs at this site by recruitment of additional binding partners to the “open” conformation of hDlg. Further experimental verification of this model would require identification of other cargo molecules of the GAKIN-hDlg complex and further investigation as to whether novel segments of GAKIN regulate protein-protein interactions of the scaffolding complex at or during the assembly process.The data presented in this manuscript suggest that human GAKIN is a biologically active kinesin motor, providing a molecular basis for the intracellular trafficking of hDlg in mammalian cells. Our results also suggest that direct binding of GAKIN to the GUK domain of hDlg could permit transport of a soluble multiprotein complex to specialized cell-cell contact sites. Alternatively, the GAKIN-hDlg interaction may also allow trafficking of the scaffolding complex attached to the intracellular vesicles. The hDlg-bearing vesicles are then delivered to the plus end of microtubules by GAKIN. The proposed model of GAKIN-dependent transport of intracellular vesicles is also consistent with the observed punctate and vesicular distribution of hDlg/SAP97 in neuronal, epithelial, and lymphoid cells (18Hanada T. Lin L. Tibaldi E.V. Reinherz E.L. Chishti A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28774-28784Google Scholar, 44Tiffany A.M. Manganas L.N. Kim E. Hsueh Y.-P. Sheng M. Trimmer J.S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 147-157Google Scholar, 47McLaughlin M. Hale R. Ellston D. Gaudet S. Lue R.A. Viel A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6406-6412Google Scholar). In addition to hDlg, the GAKIN-dependent trafficking could also play a pivotal role for the transport of PSD-95, based on the fact that GAKIN binds to the GUK domain of PSD-95 and is expressed abundantly in neuronal cells (18Hanada T. Lin L. Tibaldi E.V. Reinherz E.L. Chishti A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28774-28784Google Scholar).The proposed model adds a new example to the emerging general paradigm that scaffolding adaptor proteins act as molecular links between specific motor proteins and cargo vesicles. Recent examples supporting this paradigm include the mLin-10 adaptor that links KIF17 motor to vesicles via mLin-2, mLin-7, andN-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptor subunit complex (20Setou M. Nakagawa T. Seog D.H. Hirokawa N. Science. 2000; 288: 1796-1802Google Scholar), the role of JIPs in connecting the conventional kinesin to cargo vesicles via the Reelin receptor (22Verhey K.J. Meyer D. Deehan R. Blenis J. Schnapp B.J. Rapoport T.A. Margolis B. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 959-970Google Scholar), and also the GRIP1 mediated linkage of kinesin heavy chains to vesicles via an AMPA receptor subunit (48Setou M. Seog D.H. Tanaka Y. Kanai Y. Takei Y. Kawagishi M. Hirokawa N. Nature. 2002; 417: 83-87Google Scholar). A more recent demonstration of SAP97 binding to the minus end-directed actin motor myosin VI also suggests a mechanism for the reversible translocation of MAGUKs in vivo (49Wu H. Nash J.E. Zamorano P. Garner C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30928-30934Google Scholar). In conclusion, the identity of various components of the hDlg and/or PSD-95 cargo complex transported by GAKIN could open an area of considerable interest for the assembly, transport, and regulation of this complex and more importantly could provide insights into the mechanism of dynamic regulation of the cell-cell contact structure in normal and disease states. Membrane-associated guanylate kinase homologues (MAGUKs)1 are a family of proteins composed of one or more PDZ domains, an SH3 domain, and a guanylate kinase-like (GUK) domain (1Anderson J.M. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 382-384Google Scholar). They are thought to play scaffolding functions at specialized membrane sites, such as synaptic membrane, tight junction, and adherens junction (2Fanning A.S. Anderson J.M. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1999; 11: 432-439Google Scholar, 3Garner C.C. Nash J. Huganir R.L. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 274-280Google Scholar, 4Hung A.Y. Sheng M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5699-5702Google Scholar).Drosophila Dlg is a MAGUK encoded by lethal (1Anderson J.M. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 382-384Google Scholar) discs large-1 tumor-suppressor gene (dlg), and mutations ofdlg cause neoplastic overgrowth of the imaginal discs (5Woods D.F. Bryant P.J. Cell. 1991; 66: 451-464Google Scholar). The Dlg protein localizes to the septate junctions in epithelial cells where it regulates cell proliferation, apical-basal cell polarity, and the organization of junctional structure (6Woods D.F. Hough C. Peel D. Callaini G. Bryant P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1469-1482Google Scholar, 7Hough C.D. Woods D.F. Park S. Bryant P.J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3242-3253Google Scholar, 8Budnik V. Koh Y.H. Guan B. Hartmann B. Hough C. Woods D. Gorczyca M. Neuron. 1996; 17: 627-640Google Scholar). The human homologue ofDrosophila Dlg, termed hDlg, and its rat counterpart SAP97, localize at the pre- and postsynaptic membrane sites as well as the basolateral membrane of epithelial cells (9Lue R.A. Marfatia S.M. Branton D. Chishti A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9818-9822Google Scholar, 10Muller B.M. Kistner U. Veh R.W. Cases-Langhoff C. Becker B. Gundelfinger E.D. Garner C.C. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 2354-2366Google Scholar) and are proposed to perform scaffolding functions by linking cytoskeletal components to the transmembrane proteins (11Marfatia S.M. Morais Cabral J.H. Lin L. Hough C. Bryant P.J. Stolz L. Chishti A.H. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 753-766Google Scholar). In addition to the scaffolding function, mounting evidence now indicates that hDlg regulates cell proliferation and could be involved in tumorigenesis. For example, hDlg interacts with viral oncoproteins such as high-risk human papillomavirus E6 and human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) Tax (12Lee S.S. Weiss R.S. Javier R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6670-6675Google Scholar, 13Kiyono T. Hiraiwa A. Fujita M. Hayashi Y. Akiyama T. Ishibashi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11612-11616Google Scholar, 14Suzuki T. Ohsugi Y. Uchida-Toita M. Akiyama T. Yoshida M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5967-5972Google Scholar). Similarly, hDlg forms a complex with adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor suppressor gene product and negatively regulates cell cycle progression (15Matsumine A. Ogai A. Senda T. Okumura N. Satoh K. Baeg G.H. Kawahara T. Kobayashi S. Okada M. Toyoshima K. Akiyama T. Science. 1996; 272: 1020-1023Google Scholar, 16Ishidate T. Matsumine A. Toyoshima K. Akiyama T. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 365-372Google Scholar). The mechanism of how hDlg regulates cell proliferation is still largely unknown. Recently, we identified GAKIN (guanylate kinase-associated kinesin), which is also classified as human KIF13B (17Miki H. Setou M. Kaneshiro K. Hirokawa N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7004-7011Google Scholar), from Jurkat T lymphoma cells as a binding partner for the GUK domain of hDlg (18Hanada T. Lin L. Tibaldi E.V. Reinherz E.L. Chishti A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28774-28784Google Scholar). In T cells, hDlg interacts with tyrosine kinase Lck and potassium channel Kv1.3 (19Hanada T. Lin L. Chandy K.G. Oh S.S. Chishti A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26899-26904Google Scholar) and translocates to the immune synapse-like structure upon cross-linking of cell surface CD2 molecules (18Hanada T. Lin L. Tibaldi E.V. Reinherz E.L. Chishti A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28774-28784Google Scholar). These observations suggest that hDlg might play a role in the formation of physical contacts between T cells and antigen-presenting cells and regulate activation of T cells during immune response. An intriguing possibility emerges suggesting the role of GAKIN in the transport of hDlg to the immune synapse upon activation of T cells. Since transcripts of GAKIN and hDlg are ubiquitously expressed, it is conceivable that GAKIN-dependent trafficking is a widespread mechanism across species and tissues for the transport of hDlg and other MAGUKs. Consistent with this paradigm is the recent evidence indicating a role of soluble adaptor proteins in the transport of cargo vesicles via kinesin-like motors. For example, KIF17 motor interacts with mLin-10, which in turn mediates its interaction with the cargo vesicles containing NMDA receptor subunits (20Setou M. Nakagawa T. Seog D.H. Hirokawa N. Science. 2000; 288: 1796-1802Google Scholar). Similarly, KIF13A motor binds to a subunit of AP-1 complex mediating its interaction with the vesicles containing mannose-6-phosphate receptor (21Nakagawa T. Setou M. Seog D. Ogasawara K. Dohmae N. Takio K. Hirokawa N. Cell. 2000; 103: 569-581Google Scholar). Conventional kinesin, via its light chain, binds to c-Jun N-terminal kinase-interacting proteins that mediate interaction with specific cargo vesicles (22Verhey K.J. Meyer D. Deehan R. Blenis J. Schnapp B.J. Rapoport T.A. Margolis B. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 959-970Google Scholar). Since hDlg is a soluble scaffolding protein, it can in principle link cargo vesicles to an intracellular motor, and therefore this property fits well with the common paradigm of being a motor-cargo adaptor molecule. The guanylate kinase-like domains of MAGUKs exhibit little or no guanylate kinase activity (23Kuhlendahl S. Spangenberg O. Konrad M. Kim E. Garner C.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 252: 305-313Google Scholar), and their principal function seems to serve as a protein-protein interaction motif (18Hanada T. Lin L. Tibaldi E.V. Reinherz E.L. Chishti A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28774-28784Google Scholar, 24Kim E. Naisbitt S. Hsueh Y.P. Rao A. Rothschild A. Craig A.M. Sheng M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 669-678Google Scholar). Besides GAKIN, several proteins are reported to interact with the GUK domains of MAGUKs. These GUK-binders include GKAP (GUK-associated protein) (24Kim E. Naisbitt S. Hsueh Y.P. Rao A. Rothschild A. Craig A.M. Sheng M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 669-678Google Scholar), MAP1A (microtubule-associated protein 1A) (25Brenman J.E. Topinka J.R. Cooper E.C. McGee A.W. Rosen J. Milroy T. Ralston H.J. Bredt D.S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 8805-8813Google Scholar), BEGAIN (brain-enriched guanylate kinase-associated protein) (26Deguchi M. Hata Y. Takeuchi M. Ide N. Hirao K. Yao I. Irie M. Toyoda A. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26269-26272Google Scholar), a Rap specific GTPase-activating protein SPAR (27Pak D.T. Yang S. Rudolph-Correia S. Kim E. Sheng M. Neuron. 2001; 31: 289-303Google Scholar), and protein kinase A-anchoring protein AKAP79 (28Colledge M. Dean R.A. Scott G.K. Langeberg L.K. Huganir R.L. Scott J.D. Neuron. 2000; 27: 107-119Google Scholar). At this stage, it is not clear how a single GUK domain binds to so many seemingly non-related proteins and how these interactions are regulated. Recent determination of the crystal structures of PSD-95 revealed the existence of a novel mode of intramolecular interactions between the SH3 and GUK domains, providing a new perspective on the functional regulation of hDlg interactions (29McGee A.W. Dakoji S.R. Olsen O. Bredt D.S. Lim W.A. Prehoda K.E. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1291-1301Google Scholar, 30Tavares G.A. Panepucci E.H. Brunger A.T. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1313-1325Google Scholar, 31McGee A.W. Bredt D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17431-17436Google Scholar, 32Shin H. Hsueh Y.P. Yang F.C. Kim E. Sheng M. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 3580-3587Google Scholar). Interestingly, the binding of GKAP to the GUK domain of SAP97 is regulated by a series of intramolecular interactions between the SH3 and GUK domains (33Wu H. Reissner C. Kuhlendahl S. Coblentz B. Reuver S. Kindler S. Gundelfinger E.D. Garner C.C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5740-5751Google Scholar). The PDZ domains regulate MAP1A binding to the GUK domain intramolecularly, although their mechanism of regulation seems distinct from that of GKAP (25Brenman J.E. Topinka J.R. Cooper E.C. McGee A.W. Rosen J. Milroy T. Ralston H.J. Bredt D.S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 8805-8813Google Scholar). In this manuscript, we provide evidence for the existence of a novel protein-binding domain that links GAKIN to the GUK domain of hDlg. The binding mode between GAKIN and hDlg appears to be distinct from that of GKAP binding to hDlg/SAP97. Our results also suggest that GAKIN mediates intracellular trafficking of Dlg in epithelial cells. DISCUSSIONHuman Dlg protein and its rat orthologue SAP97 are localize at specialized membrane regions where cells form contacts such as the synaptic membrane in neuronal cells (10Muller B.M. Kistner U. Veh R.W. Cases-Langhoff C. Becker B. Gundelfinger E.D. Garner C.C. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 2354-2366Google Scholar), adherens junctions of epithelial cells (9Lue R.A. Marfatia S.M. Branton D. Chishti A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9818-9822Google Scholar, 43Reuver S.M. Garner C.C. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1071-1080Google Scholar), and contact sites between T lymphocyte and antigen-presenting cells (18Hanada T. Lin L. Tibaldi E.V. Reinherz E.L. Chishti A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28774-28784Google Scholar). In contrast, hDlg/SAP97 is present predominantly in the cytoplasm and appears to attach to intracellular membranes in cells that do not display cell-cell contacts (43Reuver S.M. Garner C.C. J.

In addition to the PDZ domains that link hDlg to the cytoplasmic domains of transmembrane receptors (4Hung A.Y. Sheng M. J. Biol.

These multiple protein interactions presumably permit hDlg to function as a scaffolding protein by forming large protein complexes at the interface of the membrane-cytoskeleton (11Marfatia S.M.

Nakagawa T. Seog D.H. Hirokawa N. Science. 2000; 288: 1796-1802Google Scholar), the role of JIPs in connecting the conventional kinesin to cargo vesicles via the Reelin receptor (22Verhey K.J. Meyer D. Deehan R. Blenis J. Schnapp B.J. Rapoport T.A. Margolis B. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 959-970Google Scholar), and also the GRIP1 mediated linkage of kinesin heavy chains to vesicles via an AMPA receptor subunit (48Setou M. Seog D.H. Tanaka Y. Kanai Y. Takei Y. Kawagishi M. Hirokawa N. Nature. 2002; 417: 83-87Google Scholar). A more recent demonstration of SAP97 binding to the minus end-directed actin motor myosin VI also suggests a mechanism for the reversible translocation of MAGUKs in vivo (49Wu H. Nash J.E. Zamorano P. Garner C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30928-30934Google Scholar). In conclusion, the identity of various components of the hDlg and/or PSD-95 cargo complex transported by GAKIN could open an area of considerable interest for the assembly, transport, and regulation of this complex and more importantly could provide insights into the mechanism of dynamic regulation of the cell-cell contact structure in normal and disease states. Human Dlg protein and its rat orthologue SAP97 are localize at specialized membrane regions where cells form contacts such as the synaptic membrane in neuronal cells (10Muller B.M. Kistner U. Veh R.W. Cases-Langhoff C. Becker B. Gundelfinger E.D. Garner C.C. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 2354-2366Google Scholar), adherens junctions of epithelial cells (9Lue R.A. Marfatia S.M. Branton D. Chishti A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9818-9822Google Scholar, 43Reuver S.M. Garner C.C. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1071-1080Google Scholar), and contact sites between T lymphocyte and antigen-presenting cells (18Hanada T. Lin L. Tibaldi E.V. Reinherz E.L. Chishti A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28774-28784Google Scholar). In contrast, hDlg/SAP97 is present predominantly in the cytoplasm and appears to attach to intracellular membranes in cells that do not display cell-cell contacts (43Reuver S.M. Garner C.C. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1071-1080Google Scholar, 44Tiffany A.M. Manganas L.N. Kim E. Hsueh Y.-P. Sheng M. Trimmer J.S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 147-157Google Scholar). In addition to the PDZ domains that link hDlg to the cytoplasmic domains of transmembrane receptors (4Hung A.Y. Sheng M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5699-5702Google Scholar), the primary structure of hDlg contains multiple protein-protein interaction domains that interact with cytoskeletal components and signaling molecules (9Lue R.A. Marfatia S.M. Branton D. Chishti A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9818-9822Google Scholar, 19Hanada T. Lin L. Chandy K.G. Oh S.S. Chishti A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26899-26904Google Scholar). These multiple protein interactions presumably permit hDlg to function as a scaffolding protein by forming large protein complexes at the interface of the membrane-cytoskeleton (11Marfatia S.M. Morais Cabral J.H. Lin L. Hough C. Bryant P.J. Stolz L. Chishti A.H. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 753-766Google Scholar). A major remaining issue of fundamental importance pertains to the mechanism of hDlg trafficking and its delivery to specialized sites. Our original identification of GAKIN was made by virtue of its association with the GUK domain of hDlg in the context of whole cell lysate (18Hanada T. Lin L. Tibaldi E.V. Reinherz E.L. Chishti A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28774-28784Google Scholar), therefore a possibility remained that the GAKIN-hDlg interaction might not be direct. In this manuscript, we demonstrate that GAKIN interacts directly with the GUK domain of hDlg (Fig. 1). A unique feature of this interaction is the unusual location of the hDlg-binding region within the stalk domain of GAKIN. The traditional view of kinesin motors implies that their globular C-terminal tails usually serve as the cargo binding modules (45Klopfenstein D.R. Vale R.D. Rogers S.L. Cell. 2000; 103: 537-540Google Scholar). However, in the case of GAKIN, the MBS domain that binds to hDlg is located within the N-terminal half of GAKIN downstream of its N-terminal motor domain (Fig. 2). Thus, the C-terminal half of GAKIN with a single copy of CAP-Gly domain either serves a regulatory region for cargo binding and/or binds to distinct cargo molecules. It is noteworthy here other intracellular motors, such as the Rab6-binding kinesin Rab6-KIFL, have been speculated to harbor cargo-binding domains in their coiled-coil regions (46Hill E. Clarke M. Barr F.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5711-5719Google Scholar). In any case, the presence of the MBS domain in a variety of motor and non-motor proteins suggests that this region might represent a novel cargo-binding motif with implications in linking soluble adaptors to motor proteins within the scaffolding complex. For example, the KIF13A motor transports cargo vesicles via its C-terminal tail that interacts with β1-adaptin and mannose-6-phosphate receptor (21Nakagawa T. Setou M. Seog D. Ogasawara K. Dohmae N. Takio K. Hirokawa N. Cell. 2000; 103: 569-581Google Scholar). Our identification of the MBS domain in KIF13A raises the possibility that these motors could potentially bind additional cargoes within their long stalk domains. Similarly, the presence of two MBS domains in RIM-BP1 also implicates recruitment of additional proteins in the assembly of RIM and Rab3-based trafficking machinery in the brain (38Wang Y. Sugita S. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20033-20044Google Scholar). In summary, our mapping data on the direct interaction between hDlg and GAKIN reveals a novel protein-binding domain that could mediate similar interactions with a large number of GUK domain proteins. The MBS domain of GAKIN does not share any sequence similarity with proteins that bind to the GUK domains of MAGUKs. Indeed, our results indicate that binding of GAKIN to the GUK domain of hDlg is not regulated by intramolecular interactions of the SH3 and GUK domains (Fig. 3). Based on our observation that GKAP competes with the MBS domain of GAKIN for binding to the GUK domain of hDlg (Fig. 4), we speculate on a model that offers an explanation for at least one function of the intramolecular interactions of MAGUKs. According to this model, the MBS domain of GAKIN interacts with a “folded” state of hDlg in the cytoplasm and transports it to specialized membrane sites. This folded and thus closed state of hDlg does not permit binding with other GUK domain binders such as GKAP. Once the hDlg cargo reaches the target membrane sites, other membrane and protein interactions “unfold” the closed SH3-GUK conformation thus permitting the transfer of hDlg to another GUK domain binder such as GKAP. The final assembly of the mature scaffolding complex occurs at this site by recruitment of additional binding partners to the “open” conformation of hDlg. Further experimental verification of this model would require identification of other cargo molecules of the GAKIN-hDlg complex and further investigation as to whether novel segments of GAKIN regulate protein-protein interactions of the scaffolding complex at or during the assembly process. The data presented in this manuscript suggest that human GAKIN is a biologically active kinesin motor, providing a molecular basis for the intracellular trafficking of hDlg in mammalian cells. Our results also suggest that direct binding of GAKIN to the GUK domain of hDlg could permit transport of a soluble multiprotein complex to specialized cell-cell contact sites. Alternatively, the GAKIN-hDlg interaction may also allow trafficking of the scaffolding complex attached to the intracellular vesicles. The hDlg-bearing vesicles are then delivered to the plus end of microtubules by GAKIN. The proposed model of GAKIN-dependent transport of intracellular vesicles is also consistent with the observed punctate and vesicular distribution of hDlg/SAP97 in neuronal, epithelial, and lymphoid cells (18Hanada T. Lin L. Tibaldi E.V. Reinherz E.L. Chishti A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28774-28784Google Scholar, 44Tiffany A.M. Manganas L.N. Kim E. Hsueh Y.-P. Sheng M. Trimmer J.S. J.

In addition to hDlg, the GAKIN-dependent trafficking could also play a pivotal role for the transport of PSD-95, based on the fact that GAKIN binds to the GUK domain of PSD-95 and is expressed abundantly in neuronal cells (18Hanada T. Lin L. Tibaldi E.V. Reinherz E.L. Chishti A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28774-28784Google Scholar). The proposed model adds a new example to the emerging general paradigm that scaffolding adaptor proteins act as molecular links between specific motor proteins and cargo vesicles. Recent examples supporting this paradigm include the mLin-10 adaptor that links KIF17 motor to vesicles via mLin-2, mLin-7, andN-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptor subunit complex (20Setou M.

https://openalex.org/W1970713232,"Estrogen receptor α (ER) is a ligand-activated transcription factor implicated in breast cancer growth. Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), such as tamoxifen (4-OHT), bind to the ER and affect the position of helix 12, thereby influencing coregulator binding and ER transcriptional activation. Previous studies have shown that a triple mutation in helix 12 (3m; D538A/E542A/D545A) caused a change in ER stability and obliterated 4-OHT action (Liu, H., Lee, E. S., de los Reyes, A., Zapf, J. W., and Jordan, V. C. (2001) Cancer Res. 61, 3632–3639). Two approaches were taken to determine the role of individual mutants (D538A, L540Q, E542A, and D545A) on the activity and stability of the 4-OHT·ER complex. First, mutants were evaluated using transient transfection into ER-negative T47D:C4:2 cells with an ERE3-luciferase reporter, and second, transforming growth factor α (TGFα) mRNA was used as a gene target in situ for stable transfectants of MDA-MB-231 cells. Transcriptional activity occurred in the presence of estrogen in all of the mutants, although a decreased response was observed in the L540Q, 3m, and D538A cells. The 3m and D538A mutants lacked any estrogenic responsiveness to 4-OHT, whereas the other mutations retained estrogen-like activity with 4-OHT. Unlike the other mutants, the ER was degraded in the D538A mutant with 4-OHT treatment. However, increasing the protein levels of the mutant with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 did not restore the ability of 4-OHT to induce TGFα mRNA. We suggest that Asp-538 is a critical amino acid in helix 12 that not only reduces the estrogen-like actions of 4-OHT but also facilitates the degradation of the 4-OHT·D538A complex. These data further illustrate the complex role of specific surface amino acids in the modulation of the concentration and the estrogenicity of the 4-OHT·ER complex.

Two transcriptional activation functions, activation function 1 (AF1) and activation function 2 (AF2), are present in the ER (see Fig. 1). AF1 is a constitutive activation function located in the A/B region, and AF2 is a ligand-dependent activation function in the E region or ligand binding domain (LBD). The activity of AF1 and AF2 is largely mediated by the cell and promoter context (3Tora L. White J. Brou C. Tasset D. Webster N. Scheer E. Chambon P.

Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) are compounds that bind to the ER and exert tissue-specific effects. Tamoxifen was the first SERM approved clinically for the treatment and prevention of breast cancer. Tamoxifen acts as an antiestrogen in the breast but has estrogenic properties in that it maintains bone density (6Love R.R. Mazess R.B. Barden H.S. Epstein S. Newcomb P.A. Jordan V.C. Carbone P.P.

Raloxifene is a chemically related SERM that is used for the prevention of osteoporosis but also lowers cholesterol and reduces the risk of both breast cancer and endometrial cancer (9Cummings S.R.

Dukes M. Bowler J. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 3867-3873PubMed Google Scholar). This occurs because ICI 182,780 interferes with receptor dimerization (11Fawell S.E. White R. Hoare S. Sydenham M. Page M. Parker M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6883-6887Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar) and increases ER protein turnover (12Dauvois S. Danielian P.S. White R. Parker M.G. Proc.

Analysis of the crystal structure of the ligand·ER complex has been instrumental in understanding ER conformation at the molecular level and highlights the importance of helix 12 in modulating estrogenic and antiestrogenic actions. Helix 12 is located in the LBD of the ER, but the composition and orientation of helix 12 differs depending on the ligand bound to the ER (13Shiau A.K. Barstad D. Loria P.M. Cheng L. Kushner P.J. Agard D.A. Greene G.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 927-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2254) Google Scholar). When the ER LBD is complexed with the ER agonists estrogen (E2) or diethylstilbestrol (DES), helix 12 is positioned over the ligand binding pocket (see Fig.2 A) (13Shiau A.K. Barstad D. Loria P.M.

This proper positioning generates AF2 and forms a surface for the recruitment of coactivators. However, when 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT, the active metabolite of tamoxifen) or raloxifene is bound to the ER LBD, the antiestrogenic side chain displaces helix 12 from its normal position, thereby preventing the formation of a functional AF2 (Fig. 2 B) (13Shiau A.K.

Having excluded AF2, the reported partial agonist activity of 4-OHT can only be mediated by AF1 (15Berry M. Metzger D. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2811-2818Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). In a previous study, a binding site responsible for the estrogen-like action of 4-OHT was defined that is referred to as AF2b (16MacGregor Schafer J. Liu H. Bentrem D.J. Zapf J.W. Jordan V.C. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5097-5105PubMed Google Scholar). This site contains two critical components: Asp-351 and a portion of helix 12 (Asp-538, Glu-542, and Asp-545). AF2b is proposed to be a docking site for coactivators or corepressors that modulate the estrogenicity of the 4-OHT or raloxifene ER complex (17Yamamoto Y. Wada O. Suzawa M. Yogiashi Y. Yano T. Kato S. Yanagisawa J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42684-42691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 18Liu H. Lee E.S. de los Reyes A. Zapf J.W. Jordan V.C.

Chem. 2002; 277: 9189-9198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Therefore, different ligands induce different receptor conformations, and the positioning of helix 12 is the key event that permits discrimination between ER agonists and antagonists by influencing the interaction of the ER with coregulators. The estrogenic or antiestrogenic action of ligands at the ER depends on the subtle changes in ER shape that programs the ER to form an active or inactive transcription complex or to be degraded by the proteasome. The amount of available ER in the cell is controlled by a balance between synthesis and degradation. ER stability is influenced by the nature of the bound ligand such that ligand-induced conformational changes modulate the ability of the ER to interact with proteins involved in the degradation process (20Preisler-Mashek M.T. Solodin N. Stark B.L. Tyriver M.K. Alarid E.T. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: E891-E898Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The transcriptional activity of the resulting ER pool is also influenced by the ligands present. The ER is activated if the ligand is estrogenic, and the established estrogens can be classified as class I or class II (21Jordan V.C. Schafer J.M. Levenson A.S. Liu H. Pease K.M. Simons L.A. Zapf J.W. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6619-6623PubMed Google Scholar). Class I estrogens, such as DES or E2, are planar compounds that use the AF2 site for optimal action. Class II estrogens, represented by angular triphenylethylene compounds such as 4-OHT and fixed ring 4-hydroxy triphenyl pentene, utilize AF2b for activity. However, ligands such as SERMs or pure antiestrogens can block the activity of the ER by creating a ligand·ER complex that is inactive. Overall, the complex decision-making network depends upon the protein recognition sequences exposed on the external surface of the relevant SERM·ER complex in response to ligand binding. Analysis of the helix 12 region of AF2b using the 3m mutation (D538A/E542A/D545A) yielded important insight into mechanism of 4-OHT agonism. The transforming growth factor α (TGFα) gene is recognized as a target of estrogen action and is involved in cell growth stimulation by estrogen (22Bates S.E. Davidson N.E. Valverius E.M. Freter C.E.

Rev. 1995; 47: 51-85PubMed Google Scholar), so the biological activity of the 4-OHT·ER complex can be assessed using Northern blotting for TGFα mRNA. Expression of TGFα mRNA is normally induced by E2 and 4-OHT treatment in MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells stably transfected with the wild type ER (S30 cells) (24Jiang S.Y. Jordan V.C. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1992; 84: 580-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The 3m mutation resulted in a decreased induction of TGFα in response to E2 and no response to 4-OHT (18Liu H. Lee E.S. de los Reyes A. Zapf J.W. Jordan V.C. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3632-3639PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the 3m mutation abolished the agonist activity of 4-OHT and decreased the agonist activity of E2. In addition, a slight degradation of the ER was observed when the 3m mutant stable cell line was treated with E2, 4-OHT, and ICI (18Liu H. Lee E.S. de los Reyes A. Zapf J.W. Jordan V.C. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3632-3639PubMed Google Scholar). This is in contrast to stable cell lines containing the wild type ER, which displayed a large down-regulation of the ER in the presence of E2 and ICI, but an increase in ER protein with 4-OHT treatment. Although the effect of E2 on the 3m mutation and the three individual amino acids comprising the 3m mutation has been studied using ERE-luciferase assays (4Tzukerman M.T. Esty A. Santiso-Mere D.

In addition, the precise interaction between 4-OHT and the individual mutations is not known. Amino acid L540 is a nearby amino acid of interest on the underside of helix 12 when it is sealing estrogen in the hydrophilic pocket of the LBD. The L540Q mutation was initially generated by random chemical mutagenesis and is a dominant negative ER mutant (28Ince B.A. Zhuang Y. Wrenn C.K. Shapiro D.J. Katzenellenbogen B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14026-14032Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Ince B.A. Montano M.M. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Mol.

Previous studies in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells have shown that an ERE-CAT reporter is activated by 4-OHT and ICI 164,384, but not by E2, in the presence of the L540Q mutant (27Montano M.M. Ekena K. Krueger K.D. Keller A.L. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 230-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Therefore, the L540Q mutation reverses the pharmacology of E2 and ICI 182,780 that is normally observed at the wild type ER in MDA-MB-231 cells. We have stably transfected individual mutant ER cDNAs into MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells to create an in vitromodel to address the contribution of specific amino acids in helix 12 (D538A, E542A, D545A, and L540Q) to the agonist activity of 4-OHT at the AF2b site. We have found that Asp-538 is the critical amino acid in helix 12 that not only reduces the estrogen-like actions of 4-OHT but also enhances the degradation of the ER upon 4-OHT treatment. Stable cell lines were maintained in phenol red-free minimum essential media supplemented with 5% calf serum treated 3× with dextran-coated charcoal, 0.5 mg/ml G418 (Geneticin, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), 2 mml-glutamine, 0.1 mm non-essential amino acids, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 6 μg/ml insulin. This media is referred to as stripped media, indicating that it is free of E2. S30 cells are MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells stably transfected with wild type ERα (24Jiang S.Y. Jordan V.C. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1992; 84: 580-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) and are referred to as wild type cells. These cells are grown in stripped media. T47D:C4:2 cells are ERα-negative human breast cancer cells (32Pink J.J. Bilimoria M.M. Assikis J. Jordan V.C. Br. J. Cancer. 1996; 74: 1227-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) that were propagated in phenol red-free RPMI media containing 10% fetal serum calf serum treated 3× with dextran-coated charcoal, as well as the concentrations of amino acids, penicillin, streptomycin, and insulin described above. ER− represents a G418-resistant clone that is ER-negative. The 3m stable cell line (18Liu H. Lee E.S. de los Reyes A. Zapf J.W. Jordan V.C. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3632-3639PubMed Google Scholar) containing the triple mutation (D538A/E542A/D545A) was also grown in stripped media. 4-OHT and E2 were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). ICI 182,780 was obtained from AstraZeneca (Macclesfield, England). Raloxifene was a generous gift from Eli Lilly and Co. (Indianapolis, IN). All drugs were dissolved in ethanol and stored at −20 °C. MG132 was dissolved in Me2SO and obtained from Calbiochem(San Diego, CA). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The ERαPSG5 plasmid (HEGO, kindly provided by P. Chambon) was used as a template for PCR. Primers used were as follows: D538A (5′-GCA TCT CCA GCA GCA GGG CAT AGA GGG GCA CCA CG-3′ and 5′-CGT GGT GCC CCT CTA TGC CCT GCT GCT GGA GAT GC-3′), L540Q (5′-GGC GTC CAG CAT CTC CAG CTG CAG GTC ATA GAG GGG-3′ and 5′-CCC CTC TAT GAC CTG CAG CTG GAG ATG CTG GAC GCC-3′), E542A (5′-GGG CGT CCA GCA TCG CCA GCA GCA GGT C-3′ and 5′-GAC CTG CTG CTG GCG ATG CTG GAC GCC C-3′), and D545A (5′-GTA GGC GGT GGG CGG CCA GCA TCT CCA GC-3′ and 5′-GCT GGA GAT GCT GGC CGC CCA CCG CCT AC-3′). Miniprep DNA was isolated from the resulting bacterial colonies using the QIAprep Spin Miniprep kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The Miniprep DNA was sequenced for the presence of the mutation. A larger scale DNA preparation was made from a chosen mutant using the Qiagen Maxiprep kit, and the entire ER DNA was sequenced. Each mutant was then cloned into the pIRESneo2 plasmid (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) using theEcoRI site flanking the ER cDNA. MDA-MB-231 (clone 10A) cells (24Jiang S.Y. Jordan V.C. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1992; 84: 580-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) were grown in stripped media for 3–4 days prior to transfection. The cells were transfected with 10 μg of the ER mutant in the pIRESneo2 plasmid. 5 × 106 cells were electroporated in a 0.4-cm cuvette (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at a voltage of 0.250 kV and a high capacitance of 0.95 microfarad in phenol red-free minimal essential media with no additives. The cells were transferred to a 10-cm plate and incubated overnight in 10 ml of stripped media without G418, and the media was changed the next day. The following day, media containing 0.5 mg/ml G418 was added, and the cells were subsequently maintained in this media. Individual colonies appeared ∼1 month after transfection, and these were isolated and screened for stable expression of the ER by Western blotting. The cells were transfected with 1 μg of the ERE3-luciferase plasmid (33Catherino W.H. Jordan V.C. Cancer Lett. 1995; 92: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and 1 μg of the mutant or wild type ERαPSG5 plasmid. To normalize for transfection efficiency, 0.2 μg of the PCMVβ plasmid (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) were also transfected. 5 × 106 cells were electroporated in a 0.4-cm cuvette (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at a voltage of 0.320 kV and a high capacitance of 0.95 microfarad in serum-free media. The cells were transferred to 12-well plates and incubated overnight. The next day, the cells were treated with the appropriate compound for 24 h. The cells were washed once with cold PBS, and 100 μl of extraction buffer (0.1 m potassium phosphate (pH 7.5), 1% Triton X-100, 100 μg/ml BSA, 2.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) was added to each well. The cells were incubated on ice for 2 min, dislodged from the plates, and transferred to an Eppendorf tube. The lysate was centrifuged for 2 min at top speed in a microcentrifuge, and the supernatant was used for the assay. 50 μl of the lysate was mixed with 350 μl of reaction buffer (160 mm MgCl2, 75 mm glycylglycine (pH 7.8), 0.5 mg/ml BSA, 19 mg/ml ATP, and 15 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5)) and 100 μl of luciferin (0.4 mg/ml). Luminescence was measured in a Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, San Diego, CA) for 10 s. β-Galactosidase activity was measured using 10 μl of each sample and the Galacto-Light Plus detection system (Applied Biosystems, Bedford, MA). Data are reported as relative light units, which is the luciferase reading divided by the β-galactosidase reading. Stable transfectants were treated with compounds for 24 h. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 20 μg of RNA was loaded per lane in a 1% agarose/0.66m formaldehyde gel. The RNA was transferred to a MagnaGraph nylon transfer membrane (Osmonics, Minnetonka, MN) overnight in 10× SSPE buffer (20× SSPE is 3.6 m NaCl/0.2 mNaH2PO4/0.02 m EDTA (pH 7.4)). The RNA was fixed to the membrane by UV-cross-linking. The membrane was prehybridized in hybridization solution (0.5 m sodium phosphate, 10 mm EDTA, 1% BSA, 7% SDS (pH 7.2)) for a minimum of 2 h at 60 °C. The TGFα probe (a gift from Dr. R. Derynck, Genentech, South San Francisco, CA) or the ERα probe (theEcoRI fragment from the ERαPSG5 plasmid) was labeled with [32P]dCTP using the Megaprime DNA labeling system (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ), and the labeled probe was separated from free 32P using Microspin columns (AmershamBiosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The probe was heated at 95 °C for 5 min, added to the hybridization buffer, and incubated at 60 °C overnight. The next day, the membrane was washed for 30 min at 60 °C with 1× SSPE/0.1% SDS, 30 min with 0.5× SSPE/0.05% SDS, and 2 × 15 min with 0.1× SSPE/0.1% SDS. To visualize TGFα, the membrane was exposed to film overnight. Equal loading of samples was verified by stripping the membrane and reprobing with β-actin. Cells were treated for 24 h with compound. To harvest protein, cells were washed once with PBS, scraped using a cell scraper into 10 ml of PBS, and transferred to a 15-ml conical tube. The cells were pelleted, and the supernatant was aspirated. The cell pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of extraction buffer (50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate (pH 8), containing a 1:100 dilution of a freshly added protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma P8340, St. Louis, MO)), passed through a 22-gauge needle, and incubated on ice for 30 min. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was transferred to a new tube. Samples were quantitated using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. 20 μg of cell lysate were separated on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to nitrocellulose. The blot was blocked in blotto (2.5% dry milk/0.05% Tween/0.5× PBS) for 1 h to overnight. Blots were probed with polyclonal ERα antibodies at 1:200 (G20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and monoclonal β-actin antibodies at 1:20,000 (Sigma A5441, St. Louis, MO) for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was then washed 3 × 5 min with wash buffer (0.5× PBS/0.05% Tween). The blot was incubated in a 1:3000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h. The membrane was washed 3 × 5 min with wash buffer, and bands were visualized using chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). Western and Northern blots were quantitated using the gel plot feature in Scion Image version 4.0.2. The results were statistically analyzed using SPSS 9.0. Previous results in our laboratory showed that a triple mutation in helix 12 of the ER (3m, D538A/E542A/D545A) caused a change in ER stability and eliminated 4-OHT agonist activity (18Liu H. Lee E.S. de los Reyes A. Zapf J.W. Jordan V.C. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3632-3639PubMed Google Scholar). To analyze the role of individual amino acids in helix 12, multiple mutations were generated. These mutations include single point mutations of the 3m mutation (D538A/E542A/D545A) and the L540Q mutation (Figs. 1 and 2). The transcriptional activity of the ER mutants was first tested by transient transfection of ER-negative T47D:C4:2 cells with the mutant ER cDNA and an ERE3-luciferase reporter (33Catherino W.H. Jordan V.C. Cancer Lett. 1995; 92: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Transfection with the empty vector PSG5 showed no induction of luciferase activity with any of the treatments used (Fig. 3). In addition, none of the mutants exhibited any response to treatment with the vehicle control ethanol (EtOH). E2 treatment resulted in a statistically significant induction of luciferase activity with the wild type ER and all of the mutants when compared with the EtOH control. The greatest induction was observed with the E542A mutant. The wild type, D538A, D545A, and 3m mutants displayed an intermediate level, and the L540Q mutant displayed the smallest induction. The L540Q mutant was the only mutant that showed a slight induction of luciferase activity during ICI 182,780 treatment, but this was not statistically significant. In addition, the wild type, E542A, and D545A ERs displayed an induction of luciferase activity upon 4-OHT treatment, whereas the D538A, L540Q, and 3m mutants did not. When wild type, 3m, and D538A cells were treated with E2 plus 4-OHT, the response of the cells was the same as that observed with 4-OHT alone, indicating that 4-OHT acts as a complete antiestrogen in these cells (data not shown). Therefore, of the three mutations present in the 3m mutant, the D538A mutation is responsible for the elimination of the agonist activity of 4-OHT at an ERE in T47D:C4:2 cells. To further evaluate these mutants in a reproducible manner, stable transfectants were generated in ER-negative MDA-MB-231 cells. At least five clones were obtained representing each mutation, and the clones were screened for the presence of the ER using Western blotting. Two clones harboring each mutation were initially screened using Northern blotting for TGFα mRNA levels. Both of the clones studied showed similar TGFα levels in response to various treatments, so a single representative clone was chosen for further analysis. Each of the stable clones was screened to ensure that the proper mutation was present using reverse transcription-PCR and sequencing. ER protein levels were compared between each of the stable cell lines (Fig. 4). All of the cell lines contained similar levels of ER protein, so the characteristics observed in each cell line were not a result of varying ER levels. A clone that was stably transfected but ER-negative by Western blot analysis was used as a control and designated ER−. The transcriptional activity of the ER mutants was also analyzed using Northern blot analysis of TGFα mRNA. The advantage of this assay is that the TGFα gene is an endogenous gene in MDA-MB-231 cells, and induction of TGFα mRNA levels reflects a process that is inherent to these cells. Cells from the ER− clone were treated with EtOH, E2, 4-OHT, and E2 plus 4-OHT, and no induction of TGFα mRNA was observed (data not shown). Wild type cells showed an induction of TGFα mRNA in response to E2 and 4-OHT, but 4-OHT did not act as an antiestrogen in these cells, because it was not able to significantly block the E2 response (Fig. 5). A similar pattern of mRNA expression was observed in the E542A and D545A mutants. Although the 3m and D538A mutants showed an increase in TGFα mRNA in response to E2 treatment, the level of induction was less than that observed for the other mutants. In addition, no induction occurred with the 4-OHT treatment. This is in agreement with ERE-luciferase assay results and suggests that Asp-538 is the single amino acid within the 3m mutation required for the agonist activity of 4-OHT at the ER. The L540Q mutant produced an induction of TGFα mRNA with ICI 182,780 and 4-OHT treatment but not with E2 treatment. In addition, raloxifene (Ral) treatment had no effect on TGFα mRNA level"
https://openalex.org/W2110546335,"5′-Methylthioadenosine/S-adenosylhomocysteine (MTA/AdoHcy) nucleosidase is a key enzyme in a number of critical biological processes in many microbes. This nucleosidase catalyzes the irreversible hydrolysis of the N9–C1′bond of MTA or AdoHcy to form adenine and the corresponding thioribose. The key role of the MTA/AdoHcy nucleosidase in biological methylation, polyamine biosynthesis, methionine recycling, and bacterial quorum sensing has made it an important antimicrobial drug target. The crystal structures of Escherichia coli MTA/AdoHcy nucleosidase complexed with the transition state analog, formycin A (FMA), and the nonhydrolyzable substrate analog, 5′-methylthiotubercidin (MTT) have been solved to 2.2- and 2.0-Å resolution, respectively. These are the first MTA/AdoHcy nucleosidase structures to be solved in the presence of inhibitors. These structures clearly identify the residues involved in substrate binding and catalysis in the active site. Comparisons of the inhibitor complexes to the adenine-bound MTA/AdoHcy nucleosidase (Lee, J. E., Cornell, K. A., Riscoe, M. K., and Howell, P. L. (2001) Structure (Camb.) 9, 941–953) structure provide evidence for a ligand-induced conformational change in the active site and the substrate preference of the enzyme. The enzymatic mechanism has been re-examined. 5′-Methylthioadenosine/S-adenosylhomocysteine (MTA/AdoHcy) nucleosidase is a key enzyme in a number of critical biological processes in many microbes.

(2001) Structure (Camb.) 9, 941–953) structure provide evidence for a ligand-induced conformational change in the active site and the substrate preference of the enzyme. The enzymatic mechanism has been re-examined. 5′-methylthioadenosine S-adenosylhomocysteine formycin A 5′-methylthiotubercidin 5′-methylthioadenosine phosphorylase root mean square deviation The enzyme 5′-methylthioadenosine (MTA)1/S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy) nucleosidase (EC 3.2.2.9) is a dual substrate specific enzyme that irreversibly cleaves the N9–C1′ bond of 5′-methylthioadenosine and S-adenosylhomocysteine to form adenine, and 5′-methylthioribose andS-ribosylhomocysteine, respectively (1Duerre J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 3737-3741Google Scholar).MTA/AdoHcy nucleosidase has been described as an excellent target for broad-spectrum antimicrobial drug design (2Sufrin J.R. Meshnick S.R. Spiess A.J. Garofalo-Hannan J. Pan X.Q. Bacchi C.J. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 2511-2515Google Scholar, 3Riscoe M.K. Ferro A.J. Fitchen J.H. Parasitol. Today. 1989; 5: 330-333Google Scholar). The enzyme is not found in mammalian cells but is found in many microbial pathogens, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis,Haemophilus influenza, Vibrio cholerae, andBacillus anthracis. Inhibition of MTA/AdoHcy nucleosidase should selectively target the pathogenic microbes while leaving the human host unharmed by increasing cellular levels of MTA and AdoHcy. The buildup of these molecules will affect four major cellular functions in microbes. First, the enzyme is important in the recycling of methionine, an essential amino acid that is energetically expensive to synthesize (2Sufrin J.R. Meshnick S.R. Spiess A.J. Garofalo-Hannan J. Pan X.Q. Bacchi C.J. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 2511-2515Google Scholar, 3Riscoe M.K. Ferro A.J. Fitchen J.H. Parasitol. Today. 1989; 5: 330-333Google Scholar). Second, the nucleosidase is involved in the regulation of biological methylation, as AdoHcy is a potent negative feedback inhibitor of methyltransferases (4Borchardt R.T. Creveling C.R. Ueland P.M. Biological Methylation and Drug Design-Experimental and Clinical Roles of S-Adenosylmethionine. Humana Press, Clifton, NJ1986: 227-238Google Scholar). Biological methylation is critical in all organisms and is responsible for regulating a number of biological processes including DNA and protein metabolism (5Borchardt R.T. J. Med. Chem. 1980; 23: 347-357Google Scholar). Third, MTA/AdoHcy nucleosidase participates in the regulation of polyamine biosynthesis (6Pajula R.L. Raina A. FEBS Lett. 1979; 99: 343-345Google Scholar, 7Raina A. Tuomi K. Pajula R.L. Biochem. J. 1982; 204: 697-703Google Scholar). The role of polyamines is not well understood but they are thought to be important in growth processes. MTA acts as a potent negative feedback inhibitor of spermidine synthase. Finally, the nucleosidase has recently been implicated in the quorum sensing pathway in bacteria (8Schauder S. Shokat K. Surette M.G. Bassler B.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 463-476Google Scholar). Quorum sensing is the phenomenon whereby the accumulation of small exported organic molecules called autoinducers enables a bacterial cell to sense the population of bacteria. This phenomenon was first described in the bioluminescent marine bacteriumVibrio fischeri (9Nealson K.H. Hastings J.W. Microbiol. Rev. 1979; 43: 496-518Google Scholar, 10Hastings J.W. Nealson K.H. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1977; 31: 549-595Google Scholar, 11Schauder S. Bassler B.L. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1468-1480Google Scholar) and has been implicated in the regulation of virulence factors (12Passador L. Cook J.M. Gambello M.J. Rust L. Iglewski B.H. Science. 1993; 260: 1127-1130Google Scholar, 13Jones S. Yu B. Bainton N.J. Birdsall M. Bycroft B.W. Chhabra S.R. Cox A.J.R. Golby P. Reeves P.J. Stephens S. Winson M.K. Salmond G.P.C.

Microbiol. 1996; 50: 727-751Google Scholar) and biofilm formation in many bacteria (15Singh P.K. Schaefer A.L. Parsek M.R. Moninger T.O. Welsh M.J. Greenberg E.P. Nature. 2000; 407: 762-764Google Scholar). When a threshold level of autoinducers is reached, bacteria trigger a signal transduction cascade that can alter gene expression (16Bassler B.L. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 582-587Google Scholar). MTA/AdoHcy nucleosidase cleaves AdoHcy to generateS-ribosylhomocysteine and adenine. The enzyme LuxS acts onS-ribosylhomocysteine to form the autoinducer-2 furanone and homocysteine (8Schauder S. Shokat K. Surette M.G. Bassler B.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 463-476Google Scholar, 17Chen X. Schauder S. Potier N. Van Dorsselaer A. Pelczer I. Bassler B.L. Hughson F.M. Nature. 2002; 415: 545-549Google Scholar). Autoinducer-2 has been implicated in intra- and interspecies communication. Inhibition of the nucleosidase is thought to prevent the formation of the product (S-ribosylhomocysteine) needed for LuxS to catalyze the production of autoinducer-2.Previously we determined the 1.9-Å resolution crystal structure of MTA/AdoHcy nucleosidase complexed with adenine bound in the active site (18Lee J.E. Cornell K.A. Riscoe M.K. Howell P.L. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 941-953Google Scholar). The enzyme has a mixed α/β structure with a central 9-stranded β-sheet surrounded by six α helices and a 310 helix. Although the primary sequence is not homologous to any known proteins, its tertiary structure is similar to enzymes in the purine nucleoside phosphorylase family.This paper reports the crystal structures of MTA/AdoHcy nucleosidase complexed with the inhibitors, formycin A (FMA) and 5′-methylthiotubercidin (MTT) (Fig. 1). These inhibitors have a K i of 10 and 0.75 μm, respectively (Fig. 1) (19Cornell K.A. Swarts W.E. Barry R.D. Riscoe M.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 724-732Google Scholar). These are the first nucleosidase structures complexed with a transition state and nonhydrolyzable substrate analogs. The structures presented here reveal the residues involved in nucleoside binding and new insight into the identity of the catalytic base. Comparisons of the adenine-bound and the inhibitor-bound MTA/AdoHcy nucleosidase structures provide evidence of inter- and intrasubunit conformational changes in the active site. These conformational changes are required for substrate binding and catalysis. Furthermore, these comparisons have allowed a structural explanation of the substrate preference of the enzyme toward 6-aminopurine nucleosides, an intact ribose, and a 5′-neutral sulfur atom (19Cornell K.A. Swarts W.E. Barry R.D. Riscoe M.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 724-732Google Scholar). Taken together, these structures have enabled us to re-examine the catalytic mechanism involved in the cleavage of the N9–C1′ bond.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONStructural DeterminationThe nucleosidase used for crystallization consists of 232 amino acids and a 10-residue N-terminal extension. The 10-residue N-terminal extension is part of a larger 31-amino acid 6-histidine fusion tag used for purification. Chymotrypsin digestion of the enzyme results in the cleavage of the first 21 residues of the 31-residue tag. In the FMA and MTT nucleosidase structures, a dimer is present in the asymmetric unit. In both structures all 232 residues of the protein were clearly visible in the electron density map and have been modeled. The FMA and MTT complexed structures were refined to a R cryst = 19.8% and R free = 24.7%, andR cryst = 19.0% and R free= 22.3%, respectively (Table I). Analysis of the structures in PROCHECK (28Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Google Scholar) reveal that none of the nonglycine residues fall into the disallowed region of the Ramachandran plot.Overall StructureIn the FMA and MTT complexed MTA/AdoHcy nucleosidase structures, two monomers related by 2-fold noncrystallographic symmetry are present in the asymmetric unit (Fig.2 a). This is consistent with our observation that the nucleosidase elutes from an analytical fast protein liquid chromatography size exclusion column (Superdex-75 HR 10/30) with a retention time equivalent to a 51-kDa protein (18Lee J.E. Cornell K.A. Riscoe M.K. Howell P.L. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 941-953Google Scholar). The overall topology of the FMA and MTT nucleosidase complexes is similar to that previously published for the enzyme complexed with adenine (18Lee J.E. Cornell K.A. Riscoe M.K. Howell P.L. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 941-953Google Scholar). Each subunit has a central 9-stranded mixed β-sheet and a smaller 5 β-stranded sheet surrounded by six α-helices and a small 310 helix (Fig. 2 b). The root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) between monomers A and B in the FMA- and MTT-bound structures are 0.20 and 0.22 Å, respectively. Strong electron density was seen in both active sites of the MTA/AdoHcy nucleosidase structures throughout refinement indicating that each active site is fully occupied with one bound inhibitor (Fig. 2, c andd).Figure 2E. coli MTA/AdoHcy nucleosidase inhibitor complexes.

Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Active SiteThe active site of MTA/AdoHcy nucleosidase was previously identified from the adenine-bound nucleosidase complex and was suggested to comprise two parts, an adenine- and a ribose-binding site (18Lee J.E. Cornell K.A. Riscoe M.K. Howell P.L. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 941-953Google Scholar). Given that only a weakly bound adenine molecule was present in the active site of the previous structure, we were only able to define the adenine-binding site with any certainty. Modeling MTA into the active site putatively identified the residues involved in the ribose-binding site. Examination of the FMA and MTT complexes now suggest that the active site can be divided into three regions: 1) the adenine, 2) the ribose, and 3) the 5′-alkylthio-binding sites. Please note that for ease of comparison, the numbering of atoms in the purine base of the inhibitors FMA and MTT will be based on the numbering convention of MTA and not the IUPAC standard (Fig. 1).Adenine-binding SiteThe adenine-binding site is a deep pocket formed by β10 and a loop between β8 and α4. Based on the FMA and MTT complexed structures (Figs. 3 and 4), this site consists of residues Phe151, Ile152, Ser196, Asp197, and Ala199. Phe151 makes a base-stacking interaction with the adenine ring. An aromatic residue (Phe or Tyr) is structurally conserved between all known MTA/AdoHcy nucleosidases and the purine nucleoside phosphorylase family of enzymes. The main chain carbonyl oxygen and amide nitrogen of Ile152 are in excellent hydrogen bonding distance to the amino group (N6) and N1 of the adenine base, respectively. Additional interactions exist between Oδ2 and Oδ1 of Asp197 and the N7 and N6 amino group of the adenine base, respectively, in the FMA-bound nucleosidase structure. In the MTT-complexed model only a hydrogen bond interaction between Oδ1 of Asp197 and the N6 amino group exists, the N7 purine base position is replaced by a carbon in MTT. Ser196 and Ala199 do not interact with the inhibitor directly but are involved in orienting the side chain of the putative catalytic acid, Asp197. The Ser196 Oγ and amide nitrogen of Ala199 help anchor the Asp197 side chain by making hydrogen bonds to the Oδ2 and Oδ1 of Asp197, respectively. In the FMA-bound structure, N8 makes an additional hydrogen bond to the Oγ hydrogen of Ser76.Figure 3Active site of MTA/AdoHcy nucleosidase.Adenine-binding site with FMA (a) and MTT (b) bound.

Previously, only residues Met173, Glu174, and Arg193 were proposed to be involved in saccharide binding. The ribose in both the FMA and MTT complexed structures are anchored by both hydrogen bonds and van der Waals contacts. The hydrogen-bonding network consists of four direct and one water-mediated hydrogen bond to the enzyme. Two hydrogen bonds are made by the Oε1 and Oε2of Glu174 to the O3′ and O2′hydroxyls of the ribose, respectively. A third hydrogen bond is made from the backbone amide hydrogen of Met173 to the O2′ hydroxyl of the ribose, whereas the hydrophobic side chain of Met173 packs against the hydrophobic face of the ribose moiety. This interaction is thought to help stabilize and properly orient the sugar. The fourth direct hydrogen bond is made between the Oγ hydrogen of Ser76 and the O4′ oxygen of the ribose. The water-mediated hydrogen bond interactions are between WAT3 and the O2′ and O3′ ribosyl hydroxyls. van der Waals contacts are made between Met9 Sδ and Cε and the O4′ and C4′ positions of the ribose, respectively. In addition, Phe207 Cζ makes a van der Waals contact to the C4′ position.5′-Alkylthio-binding SiteThe 5′ substituents of the inhibitors are primarily coordinated by hydrophobic interactions. This hydrophobic pocket is made up of residues Met9, Ile50, Val102, Phe105, Pro113, Phe151, Met173, and Phe207 (Figs. 3 and 4). Previously, we had suggested that residues Ile50, Val102, Phe105, Tyr107, Pro113, Phe151, and Phe207 would make van der Waals-type interactions with the 5′-alkylthio group, with residues Val102, Phe105, Tyr107, and Pro113 being donated from a neighboring subunit (Fig. 3, c andd, in orange). The FMA- and MTT-bound structures confirm the participation of the previously proposed residues in the binding of the 5′ moiety with three exceptions. The 5′-alkylthio binding pocket also includes residues Met9 and Met173, as these residues form van der Waals type interactions to the 5′-methylthio group. The hydrophobic binding pocket does not include Tyr107 in the presence of MTT, FMA, or MTA. In the FMA- and MTT-complexed structures, Tyr107 is ∼6 Å away from the 5′-methyl moiety. Although Tyr107 is too far to play a major role in the binding of the methylthio group, the Oη of Tyr107 may be engaged in a hydrogen bond with the carboxylic acid or amino group of the homocysteinyl moiety of AdoHcy.Conformation of the NucleosidesIn solution, MTA and AdoHcy are found predominantly in the anti-conformation and exhibit a glycosidic torsion angle of 45° (C8–N9–C1′–O4′) (30Markham G.D. Norrby P.O. Bock C.W. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7636-7646Google Scholar). The FMA and MTT nucleosides bound to MTA/AdoHcy nucleosidase are found in a high syn-conformation relative to the glycosidic bond. This energetically unfavorable orientation of the substrate puts strain on the substrate and presumably favors the cleavage of the N9–C1′ bond. In the human MTAP structure, the bound MTA also exhibited a high syn-conformation with a glycosidic torsion angle of −54° (27Appleby T.C. Erion M.D. Ealick S.E. Structure. 1999; 7: 629-641Google Scholar). In the FMA- and MTT-bound structures, FMA and MTT have glycosidic torsion angles of −68° and −64°, respectively. The superimposition of the enzyme-bound MTA, FMA, and MTT structures confirm the similarity in the glycosidic torsion angle (Fig. 5). However, the superimposition also reveals differences in the torsion angles of the 5′-alkylthio tail. MTA bound in the human MTAP structure has a 5′-alkylthio torsion angle (C4′–C5′–S5–CS) of 39°, whereas MTT in the nucleosidase has a torsion angle of −83° (Fig. 5).Figure 5Conformations of the MTA , MTT , and FMA nucleosides in the active site. The MTT (red) and FMA (green) in the inhibitor-bound structures were superimposed with MTA (blue) from human MTA phosphorylase (Protein Data Bank code 1CG6) (27Appleby T.C. Erion M.D. Ealick S.E.

A detailed comparison of these structures has been carried out to determine whether any conformational changes occur on substrate binding. The structures were superimposed using residues in the central β-sheet as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A superimposition of the dimeric FMA and MTT inhibitor complexes based on the β-sheets from both subunits revealed an overall r.m.s.d. of 0.3 Å for the main chain atoms (N–Cα–C). The two structures are virtually identical and for the purpose of the following discussion, we have used the MTT complex as the representative model to describe the structural changes observed. A r.m.s.d. plot of all Cα atoms in the monomer of the adenine- and MTT-complexed structures highlights six major regions of the structure that deviate by more than 2.0 Å (labeled 1–6 in Fig.6 a). However, these six regions can be simplified into three areas of conformational change, as changes in region 1 are propagated to regions 4 and 6 and region 2 affects region 5. As an additional check on the validity of our superimposition, the adenine-bound structure was superimposed onto the MTT-complexed structure based on the adenine moiety. The r.m.s.d. plot of the Cα positions shows similar regions of conformational change. Stereo van der Waals diagrams before (Fig.6 b) and after binding MTT (Fig. 6 c) reveal the closure of the active site and the formation of a well defined hydrophobic pocket on substrate/inhibitor binding.Figure 6Ligand-induced conformational changes. a, r.m.s.d. plots of Cα positions. Structural differences of monomer A between the adenine and MTT-bound structures (blue) and the FMA- and MTT-bound structures (red). The superimposition of the structures is as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Residues 202–205 are disordered in the adenine-bound structure and are not present in the structure. The r.m.s.d. values for these residues are therefore zero. α-Helices and β-sheets are labeled as defined in Lee et al. (18Lee J.E. Cornell K.A. Riscoe M.K. Howell P.L.

The figures are drawn to the same scale to highlight the closure of the active site on inhibitor binding.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Adenine-binding Site Conformational ChangesA comparison of the adenine and MTT-bound structures of MTA/AdoHcy nucleosidase reveals numerous backbone and side chain movements (Fig.7). The largest movement is a loop to helix transition in residues 199–207. In the adenine-bound nucleosidase structure (Protein Data Bank code 1JYS), the electron density for residues 202–205 was either weak or missing. These residues were disordered in a solvent-exposed region of the enzyme. Upon binding of FMA or MTT, residues 200–211 form a N-terminal extension to the pre-existing α6 helix (residues 206–229). This extended α6 helix is not continuous as it has a ∼45° kink at Leu211 (Fig. 7 b). This conformational change results in a closure of the active site and the movement of residues 199–201 into the adenine-binding site where they make key hydrogen bonds to the enzyme, as described above. The amide nitrogen of Ala199 moves ∼2 Å to make a hydrogen bond to Asp197 Oδ2. The hydrogen bond together with one made between Asp197 Oδ1 and Ser196 Oγ are proposed to reposition the side chain of Asp197 closer to the N7 atom of the purine ring. The N-terminal extension of the α6 helix and the additional hydrogen bonds made by Ala199 are likely important in closing the adenine-binding cavity. Thus, the hydrogen bond formed between the carbonyl oxygen of Ala199 and the amide nitrogen of Gly154 may serve to pull in residues 150–152 and hence shrink the adenine-binding cavity. Residues 150–152 shift ∼1.2 Å, thus positioning Phe151 closer to the purine ring (Fig. 7 c).Figure 7Intrasubunit conformational changes upon inhibitor binding. a, ribbon diagram of the superimposed adenine (yellow) and MTT (blue) complexed MTA/AdoHcy nucleosidase monomers. b, ribbon diagram of the α6 helix extension. c, stickdiagram of the 150s loop shift. d, ribbon diagram of the helix α1 shift.

Brief Bioinform. 2001; 2: 195-197Google Scholar) and POV-RAY.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The adenine molecule seen in the 1JYS structure is loosely bound as evident from the long hydrogen bond between the Asp197 and the N7 of adenine (∼3.9 Å), and by the higher than average B-factors for the adenine (∼55 Å2)versus the rest of the protein (33.7 Å2). The hydrogen bond between the N7 of the purine ring and the Oδ hydrogen of Asp197 in the FMA-complexed structure is now 2.7 Å (Fig. 4 a). The N-terminal extension of the α6 helix (residues 200–211) also allows Phe207 to move ∼7.5 Å toward the 5′-alkylthio group to help complete the hydrophobic pocket. Phe151 and Phe207 make a herringbone interaction to Phe105 of the neighboring subunit.Intramolecular 5′-Alkylthio-binding Site Conformational ChangesA major intrasubunit conformational change involves a movement of residues 7–42. Residues Met9 and Glu12 in the α1 helix undergo a movement into the active site upon ligand binding and this conformational change is propagated to residues in β-strands, β2, β3, and β4 (Fig. 7 d). Met9 moves toward the 5′-alkylthio-binding site. The side chain of Met9 packs against the 5′-methylthio group of MTT and helps create part of the hydrophobic pocket. Glu12 does not bind the substrate but hydrogen bonds a water molecule (WAT3) that is in close proximity to the C1′ position of MTT (∼3.5 Å). The conformational change of Glu12 creates hydrogen bonds to the amide hydrogen of Met9 and Ser76, and the Oγ of Ser76. We propose that Glu12 is critical for the deprotonation of the nucleophilic water required for the hydrolysis of the N9–C1′ bond (see later discussion).The importance of the N-terminal residues of MTA/AdoHcy nucleosidase was previously analyzed with a truncation mutant of the first 8 residues (19Cornell K.A. Swarts W.E. Barry R.D. Riscoe M.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 724-732Google Scholar). A high degree of sequence similarity exists with the first 8 residues of the human MTAP (VKIGIIGG) and the E. coli MTA/AdoHcy nucleosidase (MKIGIIGA). Cornell et al.(19Cornell K.A. Swarts W.E. Barry R.D. Riscoe M.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 724-732Google Scholar) postulated that this region is involved in MTA or AdoHcy binding. Although the inhibitor-enzyme complexed structures show that residues 1–8 do not play a direct role in the binding of the substrate, elimination of these residues may affect the local structural stability of this region and therefore hinder the conformational changes required in the α1 helix for catalysis, particularly residues Met9and Glu12.Intermolecular 5′-Alkylthio-binding Site Conformational ChangesMTA/AdoHcy nucleosidase is thought to be a dimer based on the donation of residues in the 100s loop from a neighboring subunit. At the 5′-alkylthio tail, residues Val102, Phe105, Tyr107, and Pro113 were proposed to help make hydrophobic interactions to the 5′-methylthio or homocysteinyl group. The identity of these residues was determined using a superimposed model of MTA taken from the human MTAP structure (27Appleby T.C. Erion M.D. Ealick S.E. Structure. 1999; 7: 629-641Google Scholar). However, the modeled MTA molecule revealed that Tyr107, Pro113, and Val102 are ∼8.7, 7.7, and 6.9 Å, respectively, away from the nearest atom in the 5′-methylthio group. This led us to suggest that aninter-subunit conformational change was probably needed to bring the residues into van der Waals contacts. The only residue modeled close enough to the 5′ position of the substrate was Phe105 (4.4 Å).The Cα superimposition of the adenine and MTT-bound dimer reveals a conserved dimer interface (Fig.8 a). Upon further inspection, the 100s loop containing the donated residues was not found to undergo a major conformational change but rather a smaller loop translation by only some of the donated residues (Fig. 8 b). Residues Val102 and Pro113 do not seem to undergo a conformational change but residues Phe105 and Tyr107 move ∼1.5 Å closer to the methylthio group in both structures. This result is not surprising given that the 5′-methylthio group in the enzyme complexed with MTT is in a different conformation than the previously modeled MTA molecule. Residues Val102, Phe105, and Pro113 are actually in good van der Waals proximity to the methylthio tail of MTT. Even with the conformational changes seen in Tyr107, this residue is still too far removed (5.8 Å) to make van der Waals contacts with the methylthio group. However, as noted above Tyr107 Oη could potentially hydrogen bond with the carboxyl moiety of the longer homocysteinyl group from AdoHcy.Figure 8Intersubunit conformational changes upon inhibitor binding. a, ribbon diagram of the superimposed adenine and MTT complexed dimers.

In addition, each FLN contains two intercalated 24–36 residue 舠hinge舡 regions, the first between repeats 15 and 16 and the second between repeats 23 and 24. FLNs self-associate to form homodimers, an interaction that requires the presence of repeat 24. Current data suggest that FLNs may have multiple functions. 1) They are involved in the organization of the cytoskeleton (4Weihing R.R. Can. J. Biochem.

Nevertheless, a clear mechanistic explanation for their importance is still lacking. Most interactions with FLNs have been identified as a result of yeast two-hybrid studies using as bait a variety of membrane or cytoplasmic proteins. In this manner, one or another filamin has been identified as an interactant with some 25 proteins (2Stossel T.P. Condeelis J. Cooley L. Hartwig J.H. Noegel A. Schleicher M. Shapiro S.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 138-145Google Scholar, 15Yuan Y. Shen Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48318-48324Google Scholar, 16Nikki M. Merilainen J. Lehto V.P. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 1065-1079Google Scholar). In every case where localization studies have been performed, the interaction site on the filamin has been in the C-terminal third of the molecule. Because the libraries that were screened tend to be relatively enriched in 3′-sequences, it seemed possible that interactions with the more N-terminal portions of the filamins might have been missed. Accordingly, we embarked on a yeast two-hybrid search using as bait FLNB repeats 10–18. We report here the identification and characterization of a new member of the LIM protein superfamily, filamin-binding LIM protein-1 (FBLP-1), that interacts with FLNB proximal to the binding site of all of the other known filamin interactants with the exception of actin. The interaction between FLNB and FBLP-1 may play an important role in actin cytoskeleton organization. During the cloning of full-length FLNB, we had previously isolated from a human placental cDNA library a cDNA fragment (Fig. 5, construct 1) designated FLNB-(10–18), which codes for repeats 10–18 (residues 1128–1956) of FLNB but lacks the first hinge domain (residues 1704–1727) because of alternative splicing. FLNB-(10–18) was directionally cloned into the yeast expression vector pGBKT7 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). This construct expresses a fusion protein consisting of repeats 10–18 of FLNB and the yeast GAL4 DNA-binding domain. A yeast two-hybrid human placental cDNA library (in pACT2, Clontech) was screened. Yeast strain AH109 was transformed sequentially with the FLNB-(10–18) vector and the library vectors. Transformants were plated on SD/Trp−/Leu−/His−/Ade−plates and incubated at 30 °C until colonies appeared. These colonies were re-streaked on plates containing X-α-gal to determine α-galactosidase activity of individual colonies. To exclude false positives, positive clones were re-introduced into yeast together with either the FLNB-(10–18) vector or pLAM5′, a vector encoding a human lamin cDNA in the two-hybrid DNA-binding domain vector pGBKT7. To obtain the remaining 5′ end of the cDNA, double-stranded cDNA was synthesized from human placental poly(A)+ RNA and subjected to 5′-RACE using a Marathon cDNA amplification kit (Clontech). After ligating the Marathon adaptor to the 5′ ends of the double-stranded cDNA, two-step (nested) PCR amplification was performed using two adaptor primers and two gene-specific primers: FP4, 5′-ACAAACTGCCTGCCTCAC-3′, and FP4-in, 5′-ACTTCCTCCGCCACGGCCACATC-3′. A 600-bp PCR product was extracted from agarose gel, transferred to pT7BLUE (Novagen, Madison, WI), and sequenced. Isolated cDNA inserts were transferred to the sequencing vector pBluescript (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and both strands were sequenced using universal primers or synthetic oligonucleotides. Sequencing was performed using Dyedeoxy Terminator Cycle Sequencing kits and a model 377 or 310 DNA-sequencing system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The fragment of FLNB (Fig. 5,constructs 2–6) were excised from cDNA clones in pBluescript by restriction enzymes and introduced into pGBKT7. An expressed sequence tag clone AK027444, which contains the full-length cDNA of FBLP-1B, was purchased from the Helix Research Institute (Chiba, Japan). The various constructs in Fig. 5Bwere prepared by restriction enzymes using FPC1–22 and AK027444 and introduced into pACT2. A full-length FLNB construct was assembled in pBluescript from overlapping FLNB cDNA clones by standard methods and transferred into pcDNA3.1/Zeo. The full-length human zyxin cDNA in pCMV-Sport6 (IMAGE 3904696) was purchased from the IMAGE consortium. The GFP fusion protein expression constructs were prepared by transferring the full-length cDNA of FBLP-1 or zyxin into pEGFP-C1 (Clontech). To analyze the tissue and cell distribution of each variant of FBLP-1, cDNA from various tissues (Clontech) and cells was used as template for PCR amplification. Oligonucleotides used were as follows: FP3, 5′-TACCAGGACACACTGGAG-3′; FP7, 5′-GTGCACAAACCCTTCTC G-3′; FP8, 5′-GTTCACGCCATTCTCCTG-3′; and FP9, 5′-AGAGCAGGTTAGGAAGGG-3′. Southern blotting of PCR products was performed using the 1.3-kilobase insert of the FPC1–22 clone as a probe and the ECL detecting system (Amersham Biosciences). A glutathione S-transferase-FLNB fusion protein expression vector was constructed by subcloning a FLNB cDNA coding repeats 14–24 (residues 1519–2602), including the first hinge, into pGEX-5X-3 (Amersham Biosciences). A rabbit polyclonal antibody was prepared by immunizing with the fusion protein. IgG was purified by protein G-Sepharose, the anti-glutathioneS-transferase fraction was removed on a glutathioneS-transferase-Sepharose column, and specific IgG was purified by passage over a column of fusion protein coupled to Sepharose. As a transfection control, we used the GFP expression vector pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) without any insert. Transient transfection of human fibroblast 293 cells was performed using the calcium phosphate method. Transfected cells were detached by 0.5m EDTA-PBS, washed with PBS, and lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (17 Triton X-100, 0.57 deoxycholate, 0.17 SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 30 mm Tris-HCL, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 ॖg/ml leupeptin, pH7.5) on ice for 15 min. After centrifugation at 15,000 for 10 min, lysates were pre-cleared by incubation with protein G-agarose (Pierce) at room temperature for 90 min. Polyclonal anti-FLNB-(14–24) or polyclonal anti-GFP (Clontech) was incubated with protein G-agarose for 90 min at room temperature and washed five times with Tris-buffered saline. The pre-cleared lysates were mixed with the antibody-agarose complexes and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed five times in Triton X-100 buffer and boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Each sample was separated on 5 or 7.57 SDS-PAGE, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and incubated with anti-FLNB-(14–24) or monoclonal anti-GFP (Medical & Biological Laboratories, Nagoya, Japan). Antibody binding was detected using peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and was visualized with the ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences). The 293A cell line we used, a subclone of the 293 cell line, was kindly provided by Dr. Jeffrey Benovic (Kimmel Cancer Institute, Jefferson Medical College). This subclone has greater adhesive and spreading ability than the parental 293 cells. Transient transfection was performed using Effectene reagent (Qiagen). After transfection, fixed and permeabilized cells were incubated with 37 bovine serum albumin-PBS for 30 min at room temperature and then incubated with anti-FLNB-(14–24), anti-FLNA monoclonal antibodies TI10 and PM6/317 (Biodesign, Saco, ME), or the anti-vinculin monoclonal antibody hVIN-1 (Sigma). After washing with 0.17 bovine serum albumin-PBS and further incubation with 37 bovine serum albumin-PBS, the cells were incubated with Cy3-labeled goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG (Sigma). Other cells not incubated with antibodies were incubated with TRITC-labeled phalloidin (Sigma). Stained cells were visualized by inverted fluorescence microscopy (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Using as bait FLNB-(10–18), we screened 2 × 105 clones of a human placental two-hybrid library and isolated seven positives. To eliminate false-positives, we re-introduced these clones into yeast together with either the FLNB-(10–18) bait or pLAM5′. Six clones showed trans-activation of HIS3, ADE2, and LacZ in the presence of the FLNB bait. However, five of the six also interacted with the lamin bait and were considered nonspecific. The sixth clone, FPC1–22, which reacted specifically with FLNB-(10–18), contained a 1.3-kilobase insert terminating in a poly(A) sequence and was sequenced. As shown in Fig. 1, the sequence of FPC1–22 predicts a polypeptide consisting of 374 amino acids. Since upon sequencing, no in-frame termination codon was found upstream of the putative first ATG codon, we performed 5′-RACE, using human placental poly(A)+ RNA and identified an in-frame stop codon 72 bp upstream of this ATG. Thus, this ATG was designated as the initiation codon. We term this protein human FBLP-1 (filamin-binding LIMprotein-1 (GenBank™ accession number AF459643)). FBLP-1 has a proline-rich domain near its N terminus, two LIM domains, and a unique ∼70 amino acid sequence at its C terminus. As shown in Fig.2, the structure of FBLP-1 is similar to that of the zyxin family of proteins (zyxin, LPP, and trip6) and more weakly homologous to other LIM family members (paxillin, hic-5, and leupaxin). FBLP-1 has two (F/L)PPPP motifs in its proline-rich domain. In other LIM family members, these motifs serve as a ligand for a subset of Ena-VASP homology 1 domain proteins. FBLP-1 also contains a leucine-rich nuclear export signal as indicated in Fig. 1. This nuclear export signal motif (LXXXLXXL) is also present in zyxin family members and is thought to play a role in nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking.Figure 2Structural comparison of FBLP-1 and several homologous human proteins. The total amino acid number for each protein is shown on the right.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Using the BLAST program to search the GenBank data base, we identified two closely related full-length cDNAs (GenBankTMaccession numbers AK055259 and AK027444) coding for hypothetical proteins (Fig. 3). Both predicted proteins have three C-terminal LIM domains, whereas AK027444 lacks a proline-rich domain. In this paper, we refer to AK055259 and AK027444as FBLP-1A and FBLP-1B, respectively. By searching the data base, we found a genomic DNA sequence (GenBankTM accession number AL450998) from bacterial contigs of human chromosome 1 that contains the sequence of FBLP-1. On the basis of this sequence, the exon-intron organization of theFBLP-1 gene can be depicted as shown in Fig. 3. The proline-rich domain of FBLP-1 is a product of exons 3 and 4, the first and second LIM domains are produced by exons 5 and 6a, and the C-terminal unique sequence is produced by exon 6b. A consensus sequence for alternative splicing is present at the junction of exons 6a and 6b. Exon 6b is spliced out in FBLP-1A and FBLP-1B. The additional LIM domain of these two variants is coded by exon 7. Exons 3 and 4 are spliced out in FBLP-1B, resulting in the deletion of the proline- rich domain. During this analysis, we observed that an STS marker, WI-14085, was part of the gene. This marker has been linked to microsatellite marker D1S3543 in 1p36.13. These data have been grouped as UNIGENE Hs.8728, UniSTS SHGC-13447, and LocusLink 54751. To confirm the interaction between FLNB and FBLP-1 at the protein level, we transiently co-transfected 293A cells with full-length FLNB and either GFP or GFP-FBLP-1. After 48 h, cells were lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP IgG. Western blotting was performed with anti-GFP or anti-FLNB-(14–24) IgG (Fig.4). The anti-GFP IgG precipitated equally GFP alone and GFP-FBLP-1; however, FLNB was detected only in precipitates from the GFP-FBLP-1 co-transfectants. A large amount of FLNB was still present in the supernatant after immunoprecipitation. We also performed the reverse immunoprecipitation using anti-FLNB IgG and detecting with anti-GFP IgG; however GFP-FBLP-1 was not detected in the immunoprecipitate (data not shown). These data suggest that only a small fraction of FLNB is associated with FBLP-1, although most of the FBLP-1 is associated with FLNB. To identify the domain interacting with FBLP-1, each of several subdomains of FLNB was introduced into yeast together with FPC1–22, and X-α-gal assays were performed. As shown in Fig.5A, only constructs 1 and 2 interacted specifically with FPC1–22. This result indicates that FBLP-1 binds to FLNB between repeats 10 and 13. To identify the domain of FBLP-1 interacting with FLNB, each of the FBLP-1 constructs shown in Fig. 5B was introduced into yeast together with FLNB-(10–18) in pGBKT-7. As shown in the figure, the N-terminal 70 amino acid sequence (before the proline-rich domain) contains the filamin-binding domain. Yeast transformed with FLNB-(10–18) and FBLP-1A or FBLP-1B were slow-growing and produced small colonies on plates, although both were positive in the X-α-gal assay. As these transformed yeast grow slowly even on Trp−/Leu− plates, it is possible that the third LIM domain present in these two variants reduces the yeast growth rate. Using primers FP3 and FP7, a 206-bp fragment of FBLP-1 was amplified (Fig. 6, upper panel). Primers FP3 and FP8 amplified a 531-bp fragment of FBLP-1; however, some extra products were observed (data not shown). Primers FP3 and FP9 designed to amplify the common region of FBLP-1A and FBLP-1B amplified a 498-bp fragment from both FBLP-1A and FBLP-1B (Fig.6, lower panel). FBLP-1 was detected in most tissues tested with the except of liver; however, FBLP-1A and FBLP-1B could not be detected in brain, liver, or skeletal muscle. FBLP-1 was detected both in platelets and the megakaryocyte-like cell line, CMK, although FBLP-1A and FBLP-1B were detected only in platelets. To evaluate the cellular localization of FBLP-1, 293A cells were transfected with GFP-FBLP-1 and plated on uncoated plastic culture dishes (Fig.7). Although 293A cells spread more readily than the parental 293 cell line, 293A cells demonstrate limited numbers of stress fibers when grown on uncoated plastic culture dishes. The overexpression of FBLP-1 markedly increased stress fiber formation (Fig. 7, A–F versus I). Furthermore, both FLNB and FBLP-1 are localized to stress fibers in the transfected cell (Fig. 7, A–C, left). In contrast, FLNB is distributed diffusely throughout the cytoplasm in the non-transfected cell (Fig. 7C, right). FBLP-1 co-localized with F-actin stained by phalloidin (Fig. 7H) on stress fibers. In the GFP-transfected control, GFP was present diffusely throughout the nucleus and cytoplasm (Fig. 7, I and J). These results strongly suggest that FBLP-1 may dynamically support the reorganization of stress fibers. FLNA also co-localized with FBLP-1 to stress fibers (Fig. 7, D–F). Although we have not examined directly the interaction of FBLP-1 and FLNA, this observation suggests that such an interaction occurs. To compare the localization pattern of FBLP-1 with zyxin, 293A cells grown on gelatin-coated plates were transfected with GFP-FBLP-1 or GFP-zyxin. As shown in Fig. 8, GFP-FBLP-1 (green color) strongly localized to stress fibers (Fig. 8,A, C, and E) but not to filopodia (solid arrowheads) or lamellipodia (open arrowhead). On the other hand, GFP-zyxin localized at focal adhesions and at filopodia and lamellipodia (Fig. 8F,orange) but not on stress fibers (Fig. 8, B,D, and F). Because other members of the zyxin family have been reported to localize at focal adhesion plaques, GFP-FBLP-1-transfected cells were stained with anti-vinculin antibody to identify focal adhesion plaques (Fig.9). Although weak signals were detected at focal adhesions, GFP-FBLP-1 localized preferentially to stress fibers. Vinculin, on the other hand, localized largely to focal adhesions in the transfected cells.Figure 9Localization of FBLP-1 and vinculin in 293A cells. 293A cells cultured on gelatin-coated plates were transfected with GFP-FBLP-1. All of the images are of the same transfected cell. Lower images are higher magnification views of upper images. FBLP-1 was detected as GFP signal (green), and vinculin was detected by anti-vinculin antibody (red).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Filamins are represented in almost all living species, usually as a small family of paralogs. As already mentioned, filamins are involved in the organization of the cytoskeleton and appear to be necessary for normal cell adhesion and motility. Furthermore, they bind to the cytoplasmic tails of a growing number of membrane proteins, suggesting that they play a role in cytoskeletal-membrane interactions. In addition, they bind several cytoplasmic components of signaling pathways and may serve as a point of convergence for signals between the cell membrane and the cell interior. Filamin A (ABP-280) and chicken gizzard filamin were the first members of the superfamily to be identified and were originally characterized as proteins that promote actin filament bundling in F-actin solutions. FLNA appears to promote orthogonal actin filament organization (5Hartwig J.H. Tyler J. Stossel T.P. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 87: 841-848Google Scholar), whereas chicken gizzard filamin appears to induce parallel bundling of actin filaments (20Barry C.P. Xie J. Lemmon V. Young A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25577-25586Google Scholar). Flanagan et al. (21Flanagan L.A. Chou J. Falet H. Neujahr R. Hartwig J.H. Stossel T.P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 511-517Google Scholar) demonstrated that in cells expressing FLNA, this protein plays an essential role in the stabilization of orthogonal actin networks required for locomotion. Recently, we reported (8van der Flier A. Kuikman I. Kramer D. Geerts D. Kreft M. Takafuta T. Shapiro S.S. Sonnenberg A. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 361-376Google Scholar) that a splice variant of FLNB interacts with the cytoplasmic domain of the integrins ॆ1A and ॆ1D at the tips of stress fibers, suggesting that filamins interact with these proteins and may organize actin filaments depending on the state of cell activation. However, a large body of recent literature concludes that the Arp2/3 complex has a predominant intracellular role in promoting the formation of orthogonal actin networks, at least at the leading edge of the cell (22Svitkina T.M. Borisy G.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1009-1026Google Scholar), and that an actin filament network, which resembles closely that seen in cells, can be produced in cell-free systems in the absence of filamins (23Cameron L.A. Svitkina T.M. Vignjevic D. Theriot J.A. Borisy G.G. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 130-135Google Scholar). In Drosophila, the Arp2/3 complex is required for specific subsets of actin polymerization events (e.g. ring canal formation during oogenesis); however, the formation of parallel actin bundles apparently does not depend on Arp2/3 function (24Hudson A.M. Cooley L. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 677-687Google Scholar). From study of the Drosophila cheerio mutant, the suggestion has been made that a branching F-actin network may be transformed into parallel bundles through the action of filamin, the product of thecheerio gene (25Sokol N.S. Cooley L. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1221-1230Google Scholar). Because both the Arp2/3 complex and filamins localize in sites of actin reorganization (22Svitkina T.M. Borisy G.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1009-1026Google Scholar), it is possible that the Arp2/3 complex synergizes in some manner with one or more of the filamins. Actin cytoskeleton organization is orchestrated both by polymerization of actin monomers and by cross-linking of the resultant actin filaments. The bacterial pathogen, Listeria monocytogenes, has been very instructive in studying several facets of these phenomena (26Beckerle M.C. Cell. 1998; 95: 741-748Google Scholar). This pathogen grows an F-actin 舠tail舡 or 舠comet舡 after cellular entry, a phenomenon dependent on a surface protein, ActA (27Pistor S. Chakraborty T. Niebuhr K. Domann E. Wehland J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 758-763Google Scholar). ActA has an N-terminal domain that interacts with the Arp2/3 complex (28Welch M.D. Iwamatsu A. Mitchison T.J. Nature. 1997; 385: 265-269Google Scholar, 29Zalevsky J. Grigorova I. Mullins R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3468-3475Google Scholar) followed by a proline-rich domain that interacts with Ena/VASP family proteins (30Niebuhr K. Ebel F. Frank R. Reinhard M. Domann E. Carl U.D. Walter U. Gertler F.B. Wehland J. Chakraborty T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5433-5444Google Scholar). The Ena/VASP proteins, in turn, recruit actin monomers bound to profilin and accelerate actin polymerization (31Machner M.P. Urbanke C. Barzik M. Otten S. Sechi A.S. Wehland J. Heinz D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40096-40103Google Scholar). The organization of F-actin induced by ActA is strikingly similar to the actin cytoskeletal organization that occurs at the leading edge of lamellipodia in normal cells. Several human proteins have properties similar to ActA. The zyxin family proteins that include zyxin (32Golsteyn R.M. Beckerle M.C. Koay T. Friederich E. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1893-1906Google Scholar), LIM-containing lipoma-preferred partner (LPP) (33Petit M.M. Fradelizi J. Golsteyn R.M. Ayoubi T.A. Menichi B. Louvard D. Van de Ven W.J. Friederich E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 117-129Google Scholar), and the trip6 protein (thyroid receptor-interacting protein-6) (34Wang Y. Gilmore T.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1538: 260-272Google Scholar) have N-terminal proline-rich domains that contain the same (F/L)PPPP motifs present in ActA, and these proteins can bind to Ena/VASP proteins. The VCA (Verprolin homology, Cofilin homology,Acidic) domain of the WASp (Wiscott-Aldrich syndrome protein) family is similar to the N-terminal domain of ActA and can interact with Arp2/3 (35Higgs H.N. Pollard T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32531-32534Google Scholar). It was reported recently that VASP binds WASp directly in vitro, an interaction that may be essential in stimulating actin assembly and membrane protrusion at the leading edge (36Castellano F. Le Clainche C. Patin D. Carlier M.F. Chavrier P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5603-5614Google Scholar). The zyxin, VASP, and WASp family proteins are all found at sites of cell adhesion and in lamellipodia. LIM domains were first identified in three transcription factors,lin-11, isl-1, and mec-3, but have since been identified in many other proteins including the paxillin and zyxin families, LIM kinases, and LIM-containing transcription factors (37Turner C.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E231-E236Google Scholar, 38Bach I. Mech. Dev. 2000; 91: 5-17Google Scholar). The LIM domain is a cysteine- and histidine-rich, zinc-coordinating domain and functions in mammalian cells as a protein-protein interaction motif and probably as a DNA binding motif as well. Proteins containing LIM domains may play important roles in a variety of biological processes including cytoskeleton organization, cell development, and signaling (38Bach I. Mech. Dev. 2000; 91: 5-17Google Scholar). The LIM domains of paxillin bind to protein tyrosine phosphatase-PEST and support the function of this molecule at focal adhesions (39Shen Y. Schneider G. Cloutier J.F. Veillette A. Schaller M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6474-6481Google Scholar). Paxillin also binds to α-tubulin and may facilitate cross-talk between actin filaments and microtubules (40Herreros L. Rodriguez-Fernandez J.L. Brown M.C. Alonso-Lebrero J.L. Cabanas C. Sanchez-Madrid F. Longo N. Turner C.E. Sanchez-Mateos P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26436-26440Google Scholar). Hic-5 has been reported to bind to DNA in a zinc-dependent manner through its LIM domains and may regulate transcription of several proteins (38Bach I. Mech. Dev. 2000; 91: 5-17Google Scholar). In this study, we have identified a new FLNB-binding protein, FBLP-1, that contains both a proline-rich domain and LIM domains. Unlike several other LIM family members we have tested, FBLP-1 has the ability to bind to FLNB and to induce stress fiber formation. Thus, FBLP-1 may play a role in the dynamic organization of stress fibers and perhaps of other aspects of the cytoskeleton. The role of its LIM domains in this activity remains to be explored. Furthermore, it is possible that through its proline-rich domain, FBLP-1 may interact with Ena/VASP family members and, thus, may provide a link between filamins and the Arp2/3 complex. Studies to examine this possibility are currently underway. We thank Andrew Likens for expert assistance with the graphics."

The glutamic acid-rich γ-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) domain of factor IX is involved in phospholipid binding and is required for activation by factor VIIa. In contrast, activation by factor XIa is not phospholipid-dependent, raising questions about the importance of the Gla for this reaction. We examined binding of factors IX and IXaβ to factor XIa by surface plasmon resonance. Plasma factors IX and IXaβ bind to factor XIa withKd values of 120 ± 11 nm and 110 ± 8 nm, respectively. Recombinant factor IX bound to factor XIa with a Kd of 107 nm, whereas factor IX with a factor VII Gla domain (rFIX/VII-Gla) and factor IX expressed in the presence of warfarin (rFIX-desγ) did not bind. An anti-factor IX Gla monoclonal antibody was a potent inhibitor of factor IX binding to factor XIa (Ki 34 nm) and activation by factor XIa (Ki 33 nm). In activated partial thromboplastin time clotting assays, the specific activities of plasma and recombinant factor IX were comparable (200 and 150 units/mg), whereas rFIX/VII-Gla activity was low (<2 units/mg). In contrast, recombinant factor IXaβ and activated rFIX/VIIa-Gla had similar activities (80 and 60% of plasma factor IXaβ), indicating that both proteases activate factor X and that the poor activity of zymogen rFIX/VII-Gla was caused by a specific defect in activation by factor XIa. The data demonstrate that factor XIa binds with comparable affinity to factors IX and IXaβ and that the interactions are dependent on the factor IX Gla domain.

Bouma B. Griffin G. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 5946-5951Google Scholar, 2Broze G. Girard T. Novotny W. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7539-7546Google Scholar, 3Davie E. Fujikawa K. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10363-10370Google Scholar). The importance of this protein to normal hemostasis is demonstrated by the severe bleeding abnormality (hemophilia B) associated with its deficiency state (4Pollak E. High K. Scriver C. Beaudet A.

Stamatoyannopoulos G. Majerus P. Perlmutter R. Varmus H. The Molecular Basis of Blood Diseases. 3rd Ed. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia2001: 680-697Google Scholar). FIX is a member of a family of proteases, including the hemostasis-related proteins prothrombin, factor VII, factor X, and protein C (the “vitamin-K dependent proteases”), which require specific post-translational modifications for normal activity (3Davie E. Fujikawa K. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10363-10370Google Scholar, 6Suttie J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 459-477Google Scholar). At the N terminus of the mature forms of these proteins is a region rich in glutamic acid called the γ-carboxyglutamic acid or “Gla” domain. Glutamic acid residues in the Gla domain are modified by the addition of a carboxyl group to the γ-carbons in a reaction catalyzed by the vitamin K-dependent enzyme γ-glutamyl carboxylase (6Suttie J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 459-477Google Scholar, 7Wu S.-M. Cheung W.-F. Frazier D. Stafford D. Science. 1991; 254: 1634-1636Google Scholar). Proper γ-carboxylation is required for Gla domain binding to calcium and phospholipid, two properties that are indispensable for proper protease activity during coagulation (8Mann K. Nesheim M. Church W. Haley P. Krishnaswamy S. Blood. 1990; 76: 1-16Google Scholar). In vivo, Gla domain-dependent protease-substrate interactions take place on the phospholipid membranes of damaged cells and activated platelets. Binding to phospholipid accelerates the conversion of substrate to product by decreasing the Km for the reactions several orders of magnitude (8Mann K. Nesheim M. Church W. Haley P. Krishnaswamy S.

The use of coumarin compounds as therapeutic anticoagulants is based on their ability to interfere with vitamin K metabolism, causing incomplete γ-carboxylation of the Gla domains of prothrombin and factors VII, IX, and X (8Mann K. Nesheim M. Church W. Haley P. Krishnaswamy S. Blood. 1990; 76: 1-16Google Scholar). In addition to phospholipid, protease-substrate interactions involving vitamin K-dependent proteins require a protein cofactor, which further improves catalytic efficiency by increasing thek cat for the reactions (9Mann K. Jenny R. Krishnaswamy S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 915-956Google Scholar). FIX is a 56-kDa polypeptide comprised of C-terminal trypsin-like catalytic (heavy chain) domain and an N-terminal noncatalytic (light chain) region separated by an 11-kDa activation peptide (1Osterud B. Bouma B. Griffin G. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 5946-5951Google Scholar, 11DiScipio R. Kurachi K. Davie E. J. Clin. Invest. 1978; 61: 1528-1538Google Scholar). Two proteolytic cleavages are required to liberate the activation peptide from the remainder of the molecule to produce FIXaβ (11DiScipio R. Kurachi K. Davie E. J. Clin. Invest. 1978; 61: 1528-1538Google Scholar, 12Lindquist P. Fujikawa K. Davie E. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 1902-1909Google Scholar). Activation may occur by two distinct mechanisms mediated by the plasma serine proteases factor VIIa (EC 3.4.21.21) and factor XIa (EC3.4.21.27) (2Broze G. Girard T. Novotny W. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7539-7546Google Scholar, 3Davie E. Fujikawa K. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10363-10370Google Scholar, 13Osterud B. Rapaport S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Activation of FIX by factor VIIa is a typical coagulation protease-substrate interaction requiring calcium, phospholipid, and a protein cofactor (the membrane protein tissue factor) (13Osterud B. Rapaport S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5260-5264Google Scholar, 15Lawson J. Mann K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11317-11327Google Scholar). In this reaction the Gla domains of both FIX and factor VIIa form critical interactions with the phospholipid surface (16Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Chene C. Winkler F.K. Guha A. Konigsberg W.H. Nemerson Y. Kirchhofer D. Nature. 1996; 380: 41-46Google Scholar, 17Freedman S.J. Blostein M.D. Baleja J.D. Jacobs M. Furie B.C. Furie B. J. Biol.

Hemostasis and Thrombosis: Basic Principles and Clinical Practice. 4th Ed. Lippincott, Williams and Wilkins, Philadelphia2001: 89-101Google Scholar). The importance of the FIX Gla domain to FIX activation by factor XIa is less certain because the reaction appears to involve a mechanism distinctly different from typical vitamin K-dependent protease-substrate interactions. Although calcium is required (1Osterud B. Bouma B. Griffin G. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 5946-5951Google Scholar, 21Bajaj S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4127-4133Google Scholar, 22Walsh P. Bradford H. Sinha D. Piperno J. Tuszynski G. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 73: 1392-1399Google Scholar), phospholipid has little influence on the process (1Osterud B. Bouma B. Griffin G. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 5946-5951Google Scholar, 11DiScipio R. Kurachi K. Davie E. J. Clin. Invest. 1978; 61: 1528-1538Google Scholar, 23Mannhalter C. Schiffman S. Deutsch E. Br. J. Haematol. 1984; 56: 261-271Google Scholar). Indeed, factor XIa lacks a Gla domain, suggesting that it may interact poorly with phospholipid (3Davie E. Fujikawa K. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10363-10370Google Scholar, 24Fujikawa K. Chung D. Hendrickson L. Davie E. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2417-2424Google Scholar, 25McMullen B. Fujikawa K. Davie E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2056-2060Google Scholar). Furthermore, a protein cofactor has not been identified for FIX activation by factor XIa, at least when the reaction occurs in liquid plasma. These observations raise the possibility that the FIX Gla domain is not required for activation by factor XIa. This evidence not withstanding, there are some data to support a role for the Gla domain in FIX activation by factor XIa. A Gla domain mutation at amino acid 4 associated with hemophilia B interferes with factor XIa-mediated activation of FIX (26de la Salle C. Charmantier J.L. Ravanat C. Ohlmann P. Hartmann M.L. Schuhler S. Bischoff R. Ebel C. Roecklin D. Balland A. Nouv. Rev. Fr. Hematol. 1993; 35: 473-480Google Scholar), as does failure to remove the FIX propeptide from the N terminus (27Wojcik E.G. Van Den Berg M. Poort S.R. Bertina R.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 629-636Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies directed against FIX-Gla block activation of FIX by factor XIa (28Liebman H.A. Furie B.C. Furie B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7605-7612Google Scholar,29Refino C. Himber J. Burcklen L. Moran P. Peek M. Suggett S. Devaux B. Kirchhofer D. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 1188-1195Google Scholar). However, the antibodies interfere with other activities such as FIX activation by factor VIIa/tissue factor and factor X activation by FIXaβ. Therefore, nonspecific steric interference cannot be ruled out as the mechanism of action. In this report we describe studies on FIX binding to factor XIa. The work demonstrates that both FIX and FIXaβ bind to factor XIa but not zymogen factor XI and that the FIX Gla domain plays a critical role in the interactions. Plasma-derived FIX, FIXaα, and FIXaβ were purchased from Enzyme Research Laboratories (South Bend, IN). The cDNAs for human wild type FIX and chimera FIX/VII-Gla were gifts from Dr. Darrell Stafford, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill (30Toomey J. Smith K. Stafford D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19198-19202Google Scholar). FIX/VII-Gla contains the factor VII signal peptide, propeptide, Gla domain, and aromatic stack region (factor VII amino acids 1–48) and the FIX epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) 1 and 2 domains, activation peptide, and catalytic domain (factor IX amino acids 50–415). cDNAs were ligated into the mammalian expression vector pJVCMV, which contains a cytomegalovirus promoter (31Sun Y. Gailani D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29023-29028Google Scholar). 50 million HEK293 cells (a human fetal kidney fibroblast line, ATCC CRL 1573) were cotransfected with 40 μg of expression construct and 2 μg of plasmid RSVneo, which contains a gene conferring resistance to neomycin. Transfection was by electroporation (Electrocell Manipulator 600 BTX, San Diego). Transfected cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5% fetal bovine serum containing the neomycin analog G418 at 500 μg/ml. G418-resistant clones were transferred to 96-well culture plates, and supernatants were tested for protein expression by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using goat anti-human FIX antibodies (Affinity Biologicals, Hamilton, ON). Expressing clones were expanded in 175-cm2 culture flasks, and the medium was changed to serum-free Cellgro Complete Medium (Mediatech, Herdon, VA) supplemented with 10 μg/ml vitamin K1 (phytonadione, Abbot). The medium was exchanged every 48–72 h. Conditioned medium was supplemented with benzamidine to a final concentration of 5 mm and stored at −20 °C pending purification. Recombinant proteins are designated by the prefix “r” to distinguish them from plasma-derived proteins (no prefix). To generate rFIX that is incompletely γ-carboxylated (rFIX-desγ), transfected HEK293 cells expressing rFIX were grown in medium supplemented with 5 μg/ml sodium warfarin (Sigma) instead of vitamin K. Proteins were purified from conditioned medium by monoclonal antibody affinity chromatography. Antibodies were linked to 5 ml of Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad) at 3 mg of IgG/ml of gel. For rFIX, the antibody used was humanized murine monoclonal IgG SB 249417 (GlaxoSmithKline, King of Prussia, PA), a calcium-dependent antibody that recognizes the properly γ-carboxylated FIX Gla domain (32Toomey J.R. Blackburn M.N. Storer B.L. Valocik R.E. Koster P.F. Feuerstein G.Z. Thromb. Res. 2000; 100: 73-79Google Scholar). One to two liters of conditioned medium were run across the column, followed by washing with 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl (TBS) containing 2.5 mm CaCl2. Elution was with TBS containing 25 mm EDTA. For rFIX-desγ and rFIX/VII-Gla, a monoclonal murine IgG against the FIX catalytic domain (kindly provided by Dr. George Broze, Washington University, St. Louis, MO) was used. Washing was with TBS containing 2.5 mm CaCl2, and elution was with TBS containing 2.5 mmCaCl2 and 2.0 m sodium thiocyanate. Protein containing fractions from elutions were pooled and concentrated in an Amicon concentrator, dialyzed against TBS, and stored at −80 °C. Protein concentration was determined by dye binding assay (Bio-Rad). Preparation of recombinant factor XI has been described previously (31Sun Y. Gailani D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29023-29028Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK293 cells were transfected with an expression construct consisting of the human factor XI cDNA in pJVCMV to generate stable expressing clones, and recombinant factor XI was purified from conditioned medium by affinity chromatography using monoclonal IgG 1G5.12 (31Sun Y. Gailani D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29023-29028Google Scholar). This process was used to generate a recombinant variant of factor XI in which the active site serine residue at amino acid position 557 was changed to alanine (factor XI-Ala557) by site-directed mutagenesis. Factor XI-Ala557 was converted to the “active” form (factor XIa-Ala557) by diluting to 300 μg/ml in TBS containing 5 μg/ml human factor XIIa (Enzyme Research Laboratory) and incubating at 37 °C. Conversion of the 80-kDa zymogen to the 45-kDa heavy and 35-kDa light chains of the “activated” species was followed by reducing SDS-PAGE. Factor XIa-Ala557 was separated from factor XIIa by repurification over the 1G5.12 column. Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) assays were performed as follows. The protein to be tested (plasma FIX, rFIX, rFIX-desγ, or rFIX/VII-Gla) was diluted to 5 μg/ml in TBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (TBSA). Serial dilutions of the 5 μg/ml stocks were prepared in TBSA prior to testing in the aPTT assay. 65 μl of FIX-deficient plasma (Diagnostica Stago, Asnieres-sur-Seine, France), 65 μl of the protein to be tested, and 65 μl of PTT-A reagent (Diagnostica Stago) were mixed in a fibrin cup and incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. 65 μl of 25 mm CaCl2 was added, and the time to clot formation was determined on a fibrometer (DataClot II, Helena Laboratories, Beaumont, TX). Results were compared with serial dilutions of pooled normal plasma (George King, Overland Park, KS). By definition, undiluted normal plasma has a FIX activity of 1 unit/ml or 100%. For modified partial thromboplastin time (modified PTT) assays, proteases to be tested (plasma FIXaβ, rFIXaβ, or rFIXaβ/VII-Gla) were diluted to 5 μg/ml in TBSA, and serial dilutions were prepared as described above. 65 μl of FIX-deficient plasma, 65 μl of rabbit brain cephalin prepared by the method of Bell and Alton (33Bell W. Alton H. Nature. 1954; 174: 880-881Google Scholar), and 65 μl of the protein to be tested were mixed in a fibrin cup warmed to 37 °C. 30 s later, 65 μl of 25 mmCaCl2 was added, and the time to clot formation was determined on the fibrometer. Results were compared with those for plasma FIXaβ, which was arbitrarily assigned an activity of 100%. SPR studies were performed on a dual flow cell Biacore X device (Biacore, Inc., Uppsala, Sweden). The zymogen or activated versions of plasma-derived factor XI or recombinant factor XI-Ala557 were immobilized on a carboxymethyl dextran (CM5) surface using amine coupling chemistry. The surface of the flow cell was activated by injection of a mixture ofN-hydroxysuccinimide and EDAC for 5 min at a rate of 10 μl/min. Factor XI or XIa at 50 μg/ml in sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, was manually injected onto the activated surface. Finally, the remaining active sites on the flow cell were blocked by injecting 1m ethanolamine for 5 min. A flow cell to assess nonspecific background binding was prepared using plasma kallikrein instead of factor XIa. Plasma kallikrein is structurally highly similar to factor XIa but interacts poorly with FIX (25McMullen B. Fujikawa K. Davie E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2056-2060Google Scholar, 31Sun Y. Gailani D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29023-29028Google Scholar, 34McMullen B. Fujikawa K. Davie E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2050-2056Google Scholar). Analyte (FIX, FIXaβ, rFIX, rFIX-desγ, or rFIX/VII-Gla) was injected across the flow cells at varying concentrations (4 nm to 2 μm) in HEPES-buffered saline (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.005% polysorbate 20) containing 2.0 mm CaCl2 at a flow rate of 35 μl/min. A 2-min association time was determined to be adequate for plasma-derived FIX, FIXaβ, and wild type rFIX and was used for all subsequent experiments. Removal of bound analyte to regenerate the flow cell was accomplished by infusing HEPES-buffered saline containing 3 mm EDTA. Flow cells were equilibrated with HEPES-buffered saline containing 2.0 mm CaCl2 prior to subsequent runs. A similar procedure was used for determining nonspecific binding of analyte to kallikrein-coated flow cells. Data obtained for analyte binding to immobilized factor XI/XIa were corrected for nonspecific binding by subtracting the kallikrein flow cell signal from the factor XI/XIa flow cell signal obtained with the same analyte. BIAevaluation software provided by the manufacturer was used for data analysis. The BIAcore equilibrium analysis method was used for all interactions. Briefly, the response at equilibrium (Ru eq) for each concentration of analyte was determined as above. A nonlinear regression routine was used to determine the Kd by fitting the data to the 1:1 interaction steady-state affinity model,Rμeq=C×Rmax/C+KdEquation 1 where C represents the concentration of analyte andR max the maximal binding capacity. SPR experiments on the effect of the FIX Gla domain-specific antibody SB 249417 on the FIX-factor XIa interaction were performed similarly, with the following exceptions. The concentration of analyte (FIX) was fixed at 1 μm, and various concentrations of SB 249417 (0.01–5.0 μm) were mixed with the analyte and incubated for 5 min at room temperature prior to injecting into the flow cells. The data were fit to a single site competition model, and the inhibition constant (Ki) was calculated by nonlinear regression (GraphPad Prism, version 3.0, GraphPad, San Diego). Inhibition of FIX activation by factor XIa was assessed by a colorimetric assay. A reaction mixture containing 200 nm FIX, 1 nm factor XIa, and varying concentrations of SB 249417 (1 nm to 10 μm) in reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, and 0.05% CHAPS) was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. After incubation, FIXaβ generation was determined by adding the reaction mixture to an equal volume of a detection mixture comprising reaction buffer and 66% ethylene glycol containing 2 mm FIXap-nitroanilide-conjugated peptide substrate S299 (American Diagnostica, Greenwich, CT). After incubating for 10 min at 37 °C, the release of p-nitroanilide as a measure of FIXa activity was determined at a wavelength of 405 nm using a spectrophotometric microplate reader. In the absence of FIX in the assay, nop-nitroanilide signal was detected. Data were fit to a single site competition model, and an inhibition constant (Ki) was calculated by nonlinear regression (GraphPad Prism). Plasma-derived or recombinant proteins were diluted to 100 nm in TBS containing 2.5 mmCaCl2, and the solution was warmed to 37 °C in a water bath. Reactions were started by the addition of plasma-derived factor XIa to a final concentration of 1 nm. At time points between 0 and 60 min, 30-μl volumes were removed and mixed with 10 μl of 4× nonreducing SDS-sample buffer (500 nm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 40% glycerol, 10% SDS). Samples were size fractionated on 12% polyacrylamide gels followed by transfer to nitrocellulose membranes. Blots were developed with goat anti-human FIX polyclonal IgG (Affinity Biologicals) using an ECL chemiluminescence Western blotting detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). The intensities of bands on autoradiographs for Western blots of recombinant protein activation by factor XIa were measured using a Bio-Rad Imaging Densitometer model GS-670. Measurements for bands representing the zymogen (56 kDa band) and active protease (45 kDa band) were determined for each lane. For each lane, the value for the active protease was divided by the sum of the signals for the zymogen and active protease for each time point to determine the percent zymogen converted to protease. Cleavage of FIX by Russell's viper venom protease (RVVP) was assessed as follows. Plasma-derived or recombinant FIX proteins were diluted to 1.0 μm in TBS containing 2.5 mmCaCl2, and the solution was warmed to 37 °C in a water bath. Reactions were started by he addition of RVVP (Enzyme Research Laboratory) to a final concentration of 15 nm. At time points between 0 and 120 min, 30-μl volumes were removed and mixed with 10 μl of 4× reducing SDS-sample buffer (500 nmTris-HCl, pH 6.8, 40% glycerol, 10% SDS, 10% 2-mercaptoethanol). Samples were size fractionated on 12% polyacrylamide gels, and gels were stained with GelCode Blue stain reagent (Pierce). Initially, binding of plasma-derived FIX in solution to immobilized plasma-derived factor XIa was studied. FIX concentrations between 4 nm and 2 μm were tested using 2-min association and 90-s dissociation times. FIX rapidly associates with, and dissociates from, factor XIa (Fig.1 A) in a process that is dependent on calcium (data not shown). Dissociation appears to be nearly complete, indicating that little nonspecific irreversible binding to components of the flow cell is occurring. A plot of plasma FIX bound to factor XIa as a function of FIX concentration is shown in Fig. 1 B (open circles). The plot was derived from data in Fig. 1 A corrected for nonspecific binding as determined by the simultaneous infusion of the identical concentrations of FIX across the reference flow cell containing immobilized plasma kallikrein. Certain characteristics of the FIX-factor XIa interaction (the rapid dissociation rate in particular) preclude a kinetic fit of the data. We used equilibrium binding analysis to determine the binding constant, where binding at steady state is plotted against the concentration of FIX, and Kd is determined in the traditional manner as the concentration of analyte (FIX) occupying 50% of available binding sites. Using this method, aKd for the FIX-factor XIa binding interaction of 120 ± 11 nm was obtained. This result is in reasonably good agreement with published values ofKm for activation of FIX by factor XIa (160–180 nm) determined by chromogenic substrate assay (31Sun Y. Gailani D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29023-29028Google Scholar, 35Sun M.-F. Zhao M. Gailani D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36373-36378Google Scholar). Interestingly, FIXaβ also bound to plasma factor XIa with aKd of 110 ± 8 nm (Fig.1 B, open squares). Apparently liberation of the activation peptide during FIX activation does not alter the affinity of the protein for factor XIa. Neither FIX nor FIXaβ bound to zymogen factor XI (Fig. 1 B, closed circles andclosed squares), indicating that factor XI undergoes conformational changes upon conversion to factor XIa which exposes the FIX binding site. A significant concern when using SPR to study the binding of a substrate to its enzyme is, of course, that the substrate may be converted to product by the enzyme on the surface of the flow cell. In the case under consideration, this could confound interpretation of results for binding of FIX to factor XIa. To address this issue, we prepared a recombinant version of factor XIa, factor XIa-Ala557, in which the active site serine of the catalytic domain was replaced with alanine. Wild type factor XIa expressed in HEK293 cells has been shown to have activity similar to that of plasma-derived factor XIa in plasma and purified protein based assays (31Sun Y. Gailani D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29023-29028Google Scholar, 36Zhao M. Abdel-Razek T. Sun M. Gailani D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31153-31159Google Scholar). As expected, factor XIa-Ala557 lacks activity in plasma clotting assays and does not cleave the factor XIa chromogenic substrate S-2366 (data not shown). The binding of FIX and FIXaβ to factor XIa-Ala557 was studied by SPR in the same manner as binding to plasma-derived factor XIa (Fig. 1 C,open circles and squares). TheKd values for binding of FIX and FIXaβ to factor XIa-Ala557 (152 ± 41 and 129 ± 27 nm, respectively) are comparable with those obtained with plasma-derived factor XIa. Again, FIX and FIXaβ do not bind to uncleaved “zymogen” factor XI-Ala557 (Fig.1 C, closed circles and squares). The results indicate that conversion of FIX to FIXaβ by immobilized factor XIa, if it occurs, does not influence the results of the binding assays appreciably. The studies demonstrate that both zymogen and activated FIX bind to factor XIa with similar affinity and that a catalytically functional factor Xla molecule is not required for binding. To determine the importance of the FIX Gla domain in binding to, and activation by, factor XIa, recombinant versions of FIX with altered Gla domains were prepared (Fig.2 A). Recombinant proteins were expressed in the human fibroblast cell line HEK293 because this line has been shown to γ-carboxylate properly a high percentage of expressed recombinant vitamin K-dependent protein (37Yan S.C. Razzano P. Chao Y.B. Walls J.D. Berg D.T. McClure D.B. Grinnell B.W. Biotechnology. 1990; 8: 655-661Google Scholar). In a standard aPTT assay, plasma-derived FIX demonstrated a specific activity of 200 units/mg (1 unit equaling the FIX activity in 1 ml of normal plasma). rFIX expressed in the presence of vitamin K had a specific activity of 75% (150 units/mg) of that of plasma FIX in the aPTT assay. FIX expressed in the presence of the vitamin K antagonist warfarin (rFIX-desγ) demonstrated significantly reduced activity (<1% normal activity or <2 units/mg of protein) when tested under the same conditions. As shown in Fig. 2 B, the presence of warfarin in the cell culture results in a protein that is not recognized by a monoclonal antibody (SB 249417) that requires calcium and a properly γ-carboxylated FIX Gla domain for protein recognition. This demonstrates that adding warfarin to the cell culture system effectively interferes with γ-carboxylation of the Gla domain. rFIX in which the Gla domain has been replaced by the corresponding domain from factor VII (rFIX/VII-Gla; Fig. 2 A) was expressed in the presence of vitamin K. This chimeric protein also demonstrated poor activity in the aPTT assay (<1% normal activity or <2 units/mg of protein). The aPTT assay requires FIX to be activated by factor XIa and the FIXaβ subsequently generated to activate factor X. Poor activity in this assay could, therefore, reflect a defect in one or both of these steps. To define further the abnormalities in rFIX-desγ and rFIX/VII-Gla, we attempted to activate recombina"

We tested the hypothesis that the activity of these kinases was coordinated by an A kinase anchoring protein (AKAP) by demonstrating that the type II sodium-phosphate cotransporter (NaPi-4) physically associated with an AKAP and that this association was necessary for regulation of phosphate transport by parathyroid hormone. Immunoprecipitation with anti-NaPi-4 antiserum and glutathioneS-transferase pull-down with GST-NaPi-4 showed that NaPi-4 associated with AKAP79, protein kinase A catalytic and regulatory subunits, and the parathyroid hormone receptor in opossum kidney cells. When the regulatory subunit of protein kinase A was uncoupled from the AKAP by a competing peptide, parathyroid hormone lost the ability to inhibit phosphate transport. This result was confirmed by co-transfecting HEK293 cells with the sodium-phosphate cotransporter and wild type AKAP, a mutant AKAP79, or the empty vector. 8-Bromo-cAMP was able to inhibit phosphate transport in cells expressing the wild type AKAP79 but not empty vector or mutant AKAP79.

Direct activation of either PKA or PKC causes inhibition of sodium-dependent phosphate transport in renal proximal tubule, similar to the effect of PTH itself. The significance of this dual signaling is not clear; nor are the mechanisms for coordinating the two pathways. Activation of similar signaling pathways by other stimuli such as dopamine does not result in identical regulation of sodium-phosphate cotransport or cotransporter expression (8Lederer E.D. Sohi S.S. McLeish K.R. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1998; 9: 975-985Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism for this agonist-specific effect on phosphate despite activation of ostensibly similar second messengers is not understood. Several mechanisms to explain agonist-specific functional effects have been proposed, including activation of different enzyme isoforms, coupling to different G proteins, or activation of different unrecognized signals. Recently, interest has focused on the role of scaffolding and anchoring proteins as a means to compartmentalize and individualize agonist effect on intracellular processes (9Schillace R.V. Scott J.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 761-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 10Faux M.C. Scott J.D.

Each AKAP also expresses a sequence that targets it to a specific subcellular position and so directs signal transduction to a unique locale.

Thus, tethering of PKA to a specific cellular site by an AKAP was critical to the ability of hormone-activated PKA to regulate water transport. Lamprecht et al. (27Lamprecht G. Weinman E.J. Yun C.H.

These findings suggested to us the possibility that PTH regulated the expression and function of the sodium-phosphate cotransporter through a signaling complex assembled by an AKAP. We tested this hypothesis by examining the physical association of the sodium-phosphate cotransporter with an AKAP and other signal transduction proteins. We also examined the effect of disruption of the AKAP-PKA binding on PTH regulation of sodium-phosphate cotransport. These studies were performed in OK cells, a continuous cell line derived from the Virginia opossum that exhibits several characteristics of mammalian renal proximal tubule including a polarized morphology, apical expression of sodium-phosphate cotransporters (NaPi-4), and regulation of phosphate uptake by PTH, PKA, and PKC. Wild type OK cells were a generous gift of Dr. Steve Scheinman (Syracuse Health Science Center, Syracuse, NY).

OK cells were grown to confluence in monolayers in 175-cm2 flasks in culture medium consisting of Eagle's medium with Earle's salts (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal calf serum, 4 mmglutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, pH 7.4, as previously described (30Lederer E.D. Sohi S.S. Mathiesen J.M. Klein J.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F270-F277PubMed Google Scholar). The cells from passages 82–88 were used for experiments at 100% confluence. The OK cell plates were washed with Hanks' balanced saline solution twice and once with 50 mmmannitol, 5 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4. The cells were lysed with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, and the lysate (100 μg of protein) was incubated with preimmune serum for 1 h at room temperature on a rotator. 10 μl of Protein A-Sepharose beads were added and incubated for another 1 h at room temperature. The sample was centrifuged for 5 min at 5000 rpm in a microcentrifuge. The pellet was discarded, and the supernatant was incubated with 10 μl of antiserum against NaPi-4 (30Lederer E.D. Sohi S.S. Mathiesen J.M. Klein J.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F270-F277PubMed Google Scholar) or antibody against AKAP79/150 overnight at 4 °C. 10 μl of Protein A-Sepharose beads were added and incubated on a rotator for 1 h at 4 °C. The samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 5000 rpm. The pellet was washed with Hanks' balanced saline solution three times and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The anti-NaPi-4 antiserum (antibody) was immobilized on Protein A-Sepharose beads using the Seize X Protein A immunoprecipitation kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 0.4 ml of the ImmunoPure plus Immobilized Protein A-Sepharose beads were washed twice with binding/wash buffer (0.14 m NaCl, 0.008 mNa2PO4, 0.002 m potassium phosphate, 0.01 m KCl, pH 7.4). 0.4 ml of 1:1 diluted (in binding buffer) antiserum was added to the beads and incubated on a rotator for 1 h at room temperature. The beads were washed three times with 0.5 ml of binding buffer, and 0.4 ml of the binding buffer was added. 2 mg of the disuccinimidyl suberate was dissolved in 80 μl of Me2SO, and 25 μl of disuccinimidyl suberate reagent was added to the beads and incubated on a rotator for 1 h at room temperature. The beads were centrifuged and washed three times with 0.5 ml of quenching buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, 0.15 mNaCl, pH 7.2). The beads were then washed with elution buffer (Pierce) until no protein was detected at 280 nm in the eluent. The beads were then washed with the quenching buffer twice. OK cells were lysed in immunoprecipitation lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 20 mm NaF, 1 mmNa2VO3, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 1% Triton X-100. The lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant (200 μg of protein) diluted to 0.4 ml with binding buffer was added to the beads and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The beads were centrifuged, and the flow-through was collected and stored at −20 °C for further analysis. The beads were washed 8–10 times with the quenching buffer. The proteins bound to the anti-NaPi-4 beads were eluted in 190 μl of the elution buffer and collected in 10 μl of 1 m Tris buffer, pH 9.5. Elution was repeated at least three times. 20 μl of the eluted samples were mixed with 5 μl of sample buffer (5×) without reducing agents. The sample was boiled for 5 min, and proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and either blotted for NaPi-4 or processed for RII overlay assay. For PTH receptor immunoblot, the samples were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min instead of boiling for 5 min. The immunoprecipitated OK cell lysates were solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer, subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE, and transferred electrophoretically to either nitrocellulose (Trans-Blot; Bio-Rad) or polyvinylidene difluoride (PolyScreen; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as described previously (30Lederer E.D. Sohi S.S. Mathiesen J.M. Klein J.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F270-F277PubMed Google Scholar). After blocking, the membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies (NaPi-4, 1:5000; AKAP79/150, 1:5000; PTH receptor, 1:1000 dilution) in 5% milk in TTBS. Location of specific antibodies was detected by incubation with peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG at 1:10,000 dilution for NaPi-4 and AKAP79/150 and anti-mouse IgG at a 1:2000 dilution for PTH receptor in 5% milk in TTBS, followed by development with enhanced chemiluminescence (Renaissance; PerkinElmer). The bands imaged by chemiluminesence were analyzed by densitometry. The films were scanned using a Personal Densitometer SI (Amersham Biosciences). Proteins were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. AKAPs were detected using recombinant RIIα (ICOS, Bothell, WA). The nitrocellulose membrane was incubated with 5% milk, 0.2% bovine serum albumin in 20 mm Tris, 145 mm NaCl, pH 7.4 (TBS) at room temperature for 1 h to inhibit nonspecific binding and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with 10 nm recombinant RII protein. The membrane was then washed four times with TTBS and incubated for 2 h at room temperature with affinity-purified anti-RII antibodies at 1:5000 dilution in 5% milk, 0.2% bovine serum albumin in TBS. The nitrocellulose membrane was washed again with TTBS four times, and the location of AKAPs was detected by incubation with peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG at a 1:5,000 dilution in 5% milk, 0.2% bovine serum albumin in TBS, followed by development with enhanced chemiluminescence (Renaissance; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with Hanks' balanced saline solution and incubated for 2 h, 1 h, and 30 min in 30 μl of kinase buffer containing 25 mm HEPES, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 25 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, pH 7.4, and 3 μl of [γ-32P]ATP (1 mCi/ml) in the presence or absence of 0.5 μm cAMP. A positive control with 0.5 μmmyelin basic protein and 2 μl of active catalytic unit of PKA in 30 μl of kinase buffer and a negative control (positive control plus 2 μl of the PKA inhibitory peptide TTYADFIASGRTGRRNAIHR) were run simultaneously with the test samples. The reaction was stopped by adding 1× Laemmli buffer and heating the samples at 95 °C for 5 min. The samples were run on 10% SDS-PAGE, and phosphorylation was detected by autoradiography. NaPi-4 full-length or deletion mutant (DM-4) was shuttled from NaPi-4 pCR2.1 plasmid into the EcoRI site of GST-pGEX-3. The ligated GST-pGEX3-NaPi-4 cDNA was transformed intoE. coli DH5α. Positive colonies were selected by restriction endonuclease mapping using restriction enzymesEcoRI, SacI, and MluI for orientation. The constructs were also confirmed by sequencing. The GST-pGEX-3-NaPi-4 or GST-pGEX-3-DM-4 plasmid was transformed intoE. coli BL21PlysS, and the expression and purification of GST and GST-NaPi-4 or GST-DM-4 fusion protein was performed as previously described by Zu et al. (31Zu Y.-L. Takamatsu Y. Zhao M.-J. Maekawa T. Handa H. Ishii S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20181-20187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, a fresh overnight culture of E. coli BL21 transformed with either GST-pGEX-3, recombinant GST-pGEX-3-NaPi-4, or GST-pGEX-3-DM-4 was diluted 1:10 in 2× YT medium containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and grown at 37 °C. After this reached an absorption of 0.6 at 600 nm, ispropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mm, and the bacterial growth was continued for 4 h at 37 °C. Cells were harvested, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and 5 mm Pefabloc by mild sonication on ice. The samples were centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C. Samples (10 ml) of bacterial supernatant were rocked for 30 min at 4 °C with 800 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads previously washed three times by and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.5% Triton X-100. The beads were washed 8–10 times with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, and 50 mm KCl and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.5% Triton X-100. OK cells grown on six-well plates (Corning) were washed with Hanks' balanced saline solution and lysed with 200 μl of immunoprecipitation lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 20 mm sodium orthovanadate, 20 mm NaF, 5 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 21 μg/ml aprotinin, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin. The lysates were precleared by incubation with GST-glutathione-Sepharose beads for 2 h at 4 °C. Following this preclearing step, GST-NaPi-4, GST vector, or glutathione-Sepharose beads were added to the lysates and incubated at 4 °C overnight on a rotator. The beads were washed three times with Krebs Plus buffer, and 40 μl of 2× Laemmli buffer was added to each tube. The samples were boiled for 5 min and then subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose for immunoblot analysis. HEK293 cells were maintained in DMEM (Cellgro, Herndon, VA) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin and streptomycin. The cells were split a day prior to transfection at a concentration such that the cells were 60–80% confluent. HEK293 cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The cells were washed with OPTI medium 24 h before treatment with 8-Br-cAMP. Phosphate transport was measured by determination of radiolabeled phosphate uptake as previously described (30Lederer E.D. Sohi S.S. Mathiesen J.M. Klein J.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F270-F277PubMed Google Scholar). Each assay was performed in triplicate and averaged, and the mean was considered as a single data point. Data are shown as mean ± S.E. Then values shown represent the number of separate experiments. Each experiment was done in triplicate. p value is calculated using SigmaStat software utilizing Student's ttest. A p value less than 0.05 was a prioriconsidered statistically significant. To determine whether any AKAPs associated with NaPi-4, we immunoprecipitated OK cell membranes with antiserum to NaPi-4 and performed immunoblot analysis for AKAP79/150 and AKAP149 (Fig. 1). The AKAP79/150 antibody identified bands at 79 and 60 kDa. AKAP149 monoclonal antibody did not identify a band. Ezrin antibody inconsistently and only faintly identified a band at the 79-kDa position (data not shown). Immunoblots of OK cell lysates and crude membrane preparations for AKAP79/150 are shown in Fig.2. Only very faint bands are seen in the whole cell lysates; however, the crude membranes exhibited strong bands at 60 kDa and a 79/80-kDa doublet. We therefore focused our attention on AKAP79. To determine which of the bands identified by the AKAP79/150 polyclonal antibody in NaPi-4 immunoprecipitates were AKAPs, we performed an RII overlay assay on the immunoprecipitated proteins in the presence and absence of a competing peptide, DLIEEAASRSVDAVIEQVKAAGAY, or a nonfunctional analogue, DLIEEAASRPVDAVIEQVKAAGAY (Fig.3). In this assay, the immunoblot membrane is incubated in buffer containing the regulatory subunit of PKA (RII), which should bind any AKAP, followed by immunoblot for RII. The RII overlay assay identified the 79-kDa protein (left lane). The addition of the competing peptide virtually abolished RII binding (middle lane), whereas the addition of the inactive analogue had no effect on RII binding (right lane). The RII overlay assay also demonstrated significant nonspecific binding as noted by the heavy lower molecular weight bands. The intensity of these bands was not diminished by either the competing peptide or the nonfunctional analogue. There was an additional band identified at about 150 kDa by the RII overlay assay; however, the intensity of this band was diminished by both the competing peptide and the nonfunctional analogue. These findings suggest that in the NaPi-4 immunoprecipitates, only the 79-kDa band is specifically an RII-binding protein (i.e. an AKAP).Figure 2OK cell lysates and crude membrane preparations were blotted for AKAP79/150. Lysates revealed only faint bands, whereas crude membrane preparation showed bands at 60 kDa and a doublet at 79–80 kDa.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 3OK cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with NaPi-4 antiserum as described under “Materials and Methods.”The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and RII overlay was performed (see “Materials and Methods”) in the presence of vehicle (left lane), competing peptide that blocks the binding of AKAP-PKA RII (middle lane), or the inactive analogue (right lane). RII overlay identified a protein at the same molecular size as did the AKAP79/150 antibody. RII binding was inhibited by the competing peptide but not the inactive analogue. Blots are representative of three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To exclude the possibility of a nonspecific interaction between the polyclonal antiserum and the OK cell membrane proteins, we immunoprecipitated OK cell membranes with preimmune anti-NaPi-4 serum, immune serum, and immune serum preincubated overnight with cognate peptide. Subsequent immunoblot with the ICOS AKAP79/150 antibody demonstrated that the preimmune serum did not immunoprecipitate AKAP79 and that preincubation of the immune serum with peptide markedly decreased the ability to immunoprecipitate AKAP79 (Fig.4). Note in the accompanying panel that preincubation of the immune serum with immunizing peptide markedly diminished the ability of the antiserum to immunoprecipitate NaPi-4. To confirm the AKAP79/NaPi-4 association, we immunoprecipitated OK cell membranes with the ICOS 79/150 antibody and blotted for NaPi-4. We detected NaPi-4 in the ICOS antibody immunoprecipitates (Fig.5). Immunoprecipitation with both NaPi-4 and AKAP79/150 antibody resulted in several nonspecific bands, especially at molecular sizes of 50 kDa or less. We therefore repeated the NaPi-4 immunoprecipitation using antibody covalently linked to beads. Using this technique, as shown in Fig.6, we confirmed the fact that NaPi-4 antibody immunoprecipitates an AKAP recognized by AKAP79 antibody.Figure 5OK cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with AKAP79/150 antibody or antibody preincubated with recombinant AKAP79 as described in “Materials and Methods.” The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and blotted for NaPi-4. The arrow indicates the NaPi-4 band, clearly present as a broad band in cells immunoprecipitated with AKAP79/150 antiserum (right lane) but markedly decreased in cells immunoprecipitated with AKAP79/150 antiserum preincubated with AKAP79 (left lane). Blots are representative of three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 6The OK cell lysate was immunoprecipitated with NaPi-4 antiserum using the Seize-X IgG kit from Pierce according to the manufacturer's protocol. The proteins from column flow-through, column first wash, and the first eluted sample were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The nitrocellulose membrane was blotted against antibodies for NaPi-4 and AKAP79, and an RII overlay assay was performed. Thearrows indicate NaPi-4, AKAP79, and RII overlay positive bands. Blots are representative of three different experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We next determined whether NaPi-4 and the AKAP associated with other cellular signaling components. We reasoned that if an AKAP were present, the catalytic as well as the regulatory subunit of PKA would be present in the NaPi-4 immunoprecipitates. We immunoprecipitated OK cells with NaPi-4 antiserum after preclearing the lysates with preimmune serum and then incubated the immunoprecipitate with radiolabeled ATP in the presence or absence of exogenous cAMP. Autoradiography of the separated proteins demonstrated three phosphorylated bands when cAMP was present in the assay but not when cAMP was omitted from the assay (Fig. 7). The control experiments demonstrated that under these reaction conditions, activated PKA was capable of phosphorylating myelin basic protein and that this phosphorylation was blocked by the PKA inhibitor, IP20. If the catalytic subunit were present, we reasoned that the regulatory subunit of PKA would also be present in NaPi-4 immunoprecipitates. Fig. 8 shows that immunoprecipitation with NaPi-4 or AKAP79 antibody blotted positively for the regulatory subunit, PKA RII.Figure 8OK cells were immunoprecipitated with either NaPi-4 or AKAP79/150 antibody and immunoblotted for PKA RII.Immunoprecipitation with both NaPi-4 and AKAP79/150 antibody showed a positive signal for the presence of PKA RII. Blots are representative of three different experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) NaPi-4 is regulated by hormone-stimulated PKC as well as PKA. Additionally, AKAP79/150 is capable of binding protein kinase C and phosphatases along with PKA. Therefore, we examined the NaPi-4 immunoprecipitates for the presence of several protein kinase C isoforms and phosphatases. Immunoblots of immunoprecipitates separated by SDS-PAGE failed to reveal any PKC isoforms, including PKCβ1, -β2, -δ, -ε, and -γ. The immunoprecipitates, however, did blot positively for protein phosphatase 2b (data not shown). In preliminary experiments (data not shown), we demonstrated the presence of the PTH receptor in NaPi-4 immunoprecipitates by two-dimensional gel separation and mass spectroscopy of tryptic digests, showing 30% peptide coverage. Since PTH is one of the major physiologic regulators of sodium-phosphate cotransport, we examined the NaPi-4 immunoprecipitates for evidence of the PTH receptor by immunoblot analysis of one-dimensional gels. As seen in Fig.9, immunoblot for the PTH receptor revealed the presence of a single band in NaPi-4 immunoprecipitates. This band was present but of far lesser density in immunoprecipitates from preimmune serum. The ability of NaPi-4 antibody to immunoprecipitate the PTH receptor and AKAP79/150 suggests that all three proteins can be found in renal brush border membranes (BBM). Therefore, we prepared BBM from OK cells grown on permeable supports and blotted for NaPi-4, the PTH receptor, and AKAP79/150. As shown in Fig. 10, there was about 6–8-fold enrichment of NaPi-4 expression and the PTH receptor in the BBM whe"
https://openalex.org/W1982442692,"The present study began with mathematical modeling of how inhibitors of both factor Xa (fXa) and thrombin affect extrinsic pathway-triggered blood coagulation. Numerical simulation demonstrated a stronger inhibition of thrombin generation by a thrombin inhibitor than a fXa inhibitor, but both prolonged clot time to a similar extent when they were given an equal dissociation constant (30 nm) for interaction with their respective target enzymes. These differences were then tested by comparison with the real inhibitors DX-9065a and argatroban, specific competitive inhibitors of fXa and thrombin, respectively, with similar K ivalues. Comparisons were made in extrinsically triggered human citrated plasma, for which endogenous thrombin potential and clot formation were simultaneously measured with a Wallac multilabel counter equipped with both fluorometric and photometric detectors and a fluorogenic reporter substrate. The results demonstrated stronger inhibition of endogenous thrombin potential by argatroban than by DX-9065a, especially when coagulation was initiated at higher tissue factor concentrations, while argatroban appeared to be slightly less potent in its ability to prolong clot time. This study demonstrates differential inhibition of thrombin generation by fXa and thrombin inhibitors and has implications for the pharmacological regulation of blood coagulation by the anticoagulant protease inhibitors.

Yokoyama A. Ishihara H. Yokoyama Y. Nagahara T. Iwamoto M. Thromb. Haemost. 1994; 71: 314-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) and argatroban (2Kikumoto R. Tamao Y. Tezuka T. Tonomura S. Hara H. Ninomiya K. Hijikata A. Okamoto S. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). DX-9065a is a synthetic fXa1 inhibitor currently under clinical development. Argatroban is a synthetic thrombin inhibitor, which is already approved in Japan and the United States as an anticoagulant agent. Despite targeting different enzymes, the two inhibitors are similar in that they are synthetic, low molecular weight compounds, are monospecific to one of the coagulation cascade proteases, and can inhibit their target enzymes directly and competitively. Moreover, they have similar K i values for inhibition of the respective target enzymes: K ivalues are 41 nm for fXa with DX-9065a (1Hara T. Yokoyama A. Ishihara H. Yokoyama Y. Nagahara T. Iwamoto M. Thromb. Haemost. 1994; 71: 314-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) and 39 nm for thrombin with argatroban (2Kikumoto R. Tamao Y. Tezuka T. Tonomura S. Hara H. Ninomiya K. Hijikata A. Okamoto S. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar).The coagulation cascade comprises multiple sequential steps of protease reactions, and it is not intuitively obvious how the kinetics of the activation of each step contributes to the overall cascade. In the current study, as an attempt to better understand the differences between fXa inhibitors and thrombin inhibitors, a mathematical model of blood coagulation has been developed to simulate actions of these compounds. Computer modeling shows that a thrombin inhibitor gives a stronger inhibitory effect on thrombin generation than a fXa inhibitor. However, the two types of inhibitor prolong clot time to a similar extent when coagulation is triggered with an extrinsic pathway stimulus of the same intensity.In the experimental portions of the current study, a microplate method was developed to examine thrombin generation and clot formation simultaneously during the course of plasma coagulation. The method utilized a fluorogenic reporter substrate, Z-GGR-AMC (3Hemker H.C. Giesen P.L. Ramjee M. Wagenvoord R. Beguin S. Thromb. Haemost. 2000; 83: 589-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 4Ramjee M. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 277: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), in combination with a Wallac multilabel counter equipped with both fluorometric and photometric detectors. This methodology was used to compare the abilities of DX-9065a and argatroban to inhibit thrombin generation as well as to prolong clot time during extrinsically initiated plasma coagulation. It was shown that, while the two compounds prolonged clot time to a comparable extent, argatroban exerted a much stronger inhibitory effect on thrombin generation than did DX-9065a. The results were in good agreement with those predicted by the numerical simulation described herein.DISCUSSIONWhile thrombin generation initiated by extrinsic stimuli occurs in an explosive fashion during the propagation phase of blood coagulation, the thrombin concentration is very low during the initiation phase,i.e. before the propagation phase. The duration of the initiation phase normally coincides with the clot time of coagulation and, therefore, represents anticoagulant potencies if it is assessed in the presence of anticoagulants. The results of numerical simulation in the present study have predicted that fXa inhibitors and thrombin inhibitors might display comparable anticoagulant potencies as long as they are presumed to be competitive inhibitors with the same kinetic properties for interaction with their respective target enzymes. This was demonstrated experimentally by comparing DX-9065a and argatroban for their ability to prolong the clot time in human plasma (Fig. 3). It has been shown by these experiments that DX-9065a and argatroban are virtually equipotent in maintaining a subthreshold thrombin concentration during the initiation phase of extrinsically triggered plasma coagulation.As predicted for the hypothetical inhibitors in the mathematical model, however, DX-9065a and argatroban exerted a differential influence on thrombin generation during the propagation phase of plasma coagulation. This was typically shown at the highest TF concentration examined, where DX-9065a reduced ETP much less effectively than did argatroban (Fig. 4 A). The previous comparative studies on DX-9065a and other anticoagulants also demonstrated that DX-9065a was effective in prolonging clot time, but was less potent in reducing ETP than other anticoagulants (11Prasa D. Svendsen L. Stürzebecher J. Tromb. Haemost. 1997; 78: 1215-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 12Peyrou V. Lormeau J.C. Hérault J.P. Gaich C. Pfliegger A.M. Herbert J.M. Thromb. Haemost. 1999; 81: 400-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Thus these results are in good agreement with those obtained at higher TF concentrations in the current study.One explanation for the different abilities of the selective inhibitors to affect thrombin generation is that fXa inhibitors are able to inhibit de novo production of thrombin but not the ongoing actions of preformed thrombin. In contrast, thrombin inhibitors are able to inhibit not only the production of thrombin but also the actions of thrombin directly. The previous experimental studies, however, are not consistent with such a mechanism-based, straightforward rationalization. Hirudin and hirulog are known to be specific and direct inhibitors of thrombin, which delay thrombin peaks effectively during coagulation (12Peyrou V. Lormeau J.C. Hérault J.P. Gaich C. Pfliegger A.M. Herbert J.M. Thromb. Haemost. 1999; 81: 400-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 13Prasa D. Svendsen L. Stürzebecher J. Tromb. Haemost. 1997; 77: 498-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), yet they do not reduce ETP as effectively as other anticoagulants (12Peyrou V. Lormeau J.C. Hérault J.P. Gaich C. Pfliegger A.M. Herbert J.M. Thromb. Haemost. 1999; 81: 400-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and display properties similar to those of DX-9065a. Although hirudin is a very potent inhibitor of thrombin, its tight but rather slow binding to thrombin (14Kuzmiè P. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 267: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) might somehow affect its overall anticoagulant properties in the plasma milieu. Furthermore, a recombinant tick anticoagulant peptide (11Prasa D. Svendsen L. Stürzebecher J. Tromb. Haemost. 1997; 78: 1215-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and a pentasaccharide, SR-90107A (12Peyrou V. Lormeau J.C. Hérault J.P. Gaich C. Pfliegger A.M. Herbert J.M. Thromb. Haemost. 1999; 81: 400-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), are two examples of fXa inhibitors reported to suppress ETPs more efficiently than DX-9065a. The reasons for these unpredictable observations are not clear at present. However, it should be pointed out that, for a given anticoagulant protease inhibitor, not only which enzyme is inhibited but also its precise mechanism of inhibition are important factors influencing its impact on the overall dynamic process during blood coagulation. Fortunately, both DX-9065a (1Hara T. Yokoyama A. Ishihara H. Yokoyama Y. Nagahara T. Iwamoto M. Thromb. Haemost. 1994; 71: 314-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) and argatroban (2Kikumoto R. Tamao Y. Tezuka T. Tonomura S. Hara H. Ninomiya K. Hijikata A. Okamoto S. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) are simple, competitive, reversible inhibitors, with which one can simply postulate a rapid equilibrium for the dissociation-association interactions with their respective target enzymes. This might be a reason why numerical simulation models the dynamic effects of these compounds quite well. Thus, the findings presented in this report can be applied to other inhibitors of the same mechanism but only when they display similar kinetic properties.The differential effects of the inhibitors in the simulation results are best perceived when thrombin activity curves are viewed with a proper time scale as shown in Fig. 2. If ETP, a time-integral of a thrombin activity curve, is calculated for an infinite time interval for a given set of numerical simulation data, the resultant ETP values approach invariable ones that are no longer dependent on inhibitor concentrations (data not shown). Thus, the differential effect presented in Fig. 2 should be regarded as an apparent one that does not necessarily represent the mathematical characteristics of the model. It is not known, however, whether the same explanation is applicable to the experimental results from the thrombin generation assays where ETP can be obtained only within a limited time scale.Interestingly, the inhibitory effect of DX-9065a on ETP varied depending on the concentration of TF used to stimulate coagulation. The initiation of thrombin generation at the highest thromboplastin concentration resulted in up to more than a 5-fold increase in the ETP IC50 value for DX-9065a compared with that at the lowest thromboplastin concentration (Table II). Such a TF-dependent effect was observed only when plasma was anticoagulated with DX-9065a. Argatroban did not show any TF-dependent effect on ETP IC50 concentrations. The two compounds displayed only a limited difference in the ability to inhibit ETP at the lowest thromboplastin concentration (Fig. 4 E and Table II). Moreover, no TF-dependent effect was observed with CT × 2 irrespective of whether plasma was anticoagulated with DX-9065a or argatroban (Table II).In the absence of inhibitors, it was also shown that ETP increased with increasing TF concentrations (see the values without inhibitors in Table II). This observation may have some relevance to the observed TF-dependent effect of DX-9065a on ETPs. However the numerical simulation could not reproduce any of these TF-dependent effects on thrombin generation even when the initial concentration of TF:VIIa complex was varied over a wide range of concentrations (data not shown). The mechanism for the TF-dependent regulation is presently unknown. However, it seems reasonable to speculate that the observed TF-dependent effects might have some important roles in the regulation of blood coagulation. The purpose of the current study is to investigate the differences in the modes of action of two anticoagulant protease inhibitors, DX-9065a (1Hara T. Yokoyama A. Ishihara H. Yokoyama Y. Nagahara T.

Here we show that the plant yellow lupin, Lupinus luteus, has the ability to synthesize Hcy-thiolactone. The inhibition of methylation of Hcy to methionine by the anitifolate drug aminopterin results in greatly enhanced synthesis of Hcy-thiolactone by L. luteus plants. Methionine inhibits the synthesis of Hcy-thiolactone in L. luteus, suggesting involvement of methionyl-tRNA synthetase. Consistent with this suggestion is our finding that the plant Oryza sativa methionyl-tRNA synthetase, expressed in Escherichia coli, catalyzes conversion of Hcy to Hcy-thiolactone. We also show that Hcy is a component of L. luteus proteins, most likely due to facile reaction of Hcy-thiolactone with protein amino groups. In addition, L. luteus possesses constitutively expressed, highly specific Hcy-thiolactone-hydrolyzing enzyme. Thus, Hcy-thiolactone and Hcy bound to protein by an amide (or peptide) linkage (Hcy-N-protein) are significant components of plant Hcy metabolism.

J. Biol. Chem. 1934; 106: 451-456Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The discovery of an error editing reaction of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, in which Hcy is converted to Hcy-thiolactone, highlighted the biological significance of Hcy-thiolactone (2Jakubowski H. Fersht A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 3105-3117Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Hcy-thiolactone is synthesized by methionyl-tRNA synthetase (MetRS) in bacterial (3Jakubowski H. Proc.

Isoleucyl-tRNA synthase and leucyl-tRNA synthase, in addition to MetRS, synthesize Hcy-thiolactone from exogenous Hcy, at least in bacteria (5Jakubowski H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17672-17673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Hcy-thiolactone forms in a two-step reaction driven by the hydrolysis of ATP (2Jakubowski H. Fersht A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 3105-3117Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In the first step, MetRS catalyzes reaction of Hcy with ATP, which leads to the formation of a MetRS-bound homocysteinyl adenylate. MetRS+Hcy+ATP⇔MetRS·Hcy∼AMP+PPi REACTION1In the second step, MetRS catalyzes the reaction of the side chain thiolate of Hcy, which displaces the AMP moiety from the activated carboxyl group of Hcy; Hcy-thiolactone is a product of this reaction (Reaction FR2). Hcy-thiolactone, an intramolecular thioester of Hcy, is relatively stable and has a half-life of about 25 h under physiological conditions of pH and temperature (10Jakubowski H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1935-1941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because the pK of its amino group is unusually low at 7.1 (18Anderson R.F. Packer J.E. Int. J. Radiat. Phys. Chem. 1974; 6: 33-46Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar), Hcy-thiolactone freely diffuses through cellular membranes and accumulates in extracellular fluids (3–17). A characteristic ultraviolet absorption spectrum with a maximum at 240 nm allows facile detection and quantification of Hcy-thiolactone in biological samples (4Gao W. Goldman E. Jakubowski H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11528-11535Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 5Jakubowski H. J. Biol.

Like all thioesters, Hcy-thiolactone is chemically reactive. For example, Hcy-thiolactone forms adducts with protein (Hcy-N-protein), in which the carboxyl group of Hcy is linked by an amide bond with ε-amino group of a protein lysine residue (10Jakubowski H.

The modification by Hcy-thiolactone results in protein damage (12Jakubowski H. J. Nutr. 2000; 130 (suppl.): 377-381Crossref Google Scholar, 13Jakubowski H. J.

Although its role in cell physiology is largely unknown, Hcy-thiolactone has been suggested to be a positive effector of the stationary phase response in Escherichia coli (21Goodrich-Blair H. Kolter R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2000; 185: 117-121PubMed Google Scholar) and is also likely to be involved in the regulation of methionine synthase gene expression in E. coli (6Jakubowski H. Goldman E. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 412-429Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In humans, Hcy-thiolactone is likely to play a role in cardiovascular disease due to its ability to form Hcy-N-protein, which leads to protein damage (10Jakubowski H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1935-1941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Jakubowski H. Zhang L. Bardeguez A. Aviv A. Circ.

A protein component of high-density lipoproteins, Hcy-thiolactonase/paraoxonase, detoxifies Hcy-thiolactone, thereby minimizing formation of Hcy-N-protein in humans (22Jakubowski H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3957-3962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 23Jakubowski H. Ambrosius W. Pratt J.H. FEBS Lett. 2001; 491: 35-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Whether Hcy-thiolactone is present and how it is metabolized in plants was unknown. Here we report that Hcy-thiolactone and Hcy-N-protein are components of Hcy metabolism in yellow lupine (Lupinus luteus). We also show that Hcy-thiolactone is synthesized by rice (Oryza sativa) methionyl-tRNA synthetase and degraded by a highly specific yellow lupine Hcy-thiolactone hydrolase. Carrier-freel-[35S]Met, from Amersham Biosciences, was supplemented with unlabeled methionine (Sigma- Aldrich) to a specific activity of 20,000 Ci/mol.l-[35S]Hcy-thiolactone (20,000 Ci/mol) was prepared by digestion of l-[35S]Met with hydriodic acid (1Baernstein H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1934; 106: 451-456Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) as described previously (24Jakubowski H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21813-21816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar).l-[35S]Hcy was prepared by hydrolysis ofl-[35S]Hcy-thiolactone with 0.1 mNaOH at 37 °C for 15 min. The preparations of [35S]Met and [35S]Hcy were confirmed to be free of Hcy-thiolactone (<0.1%). Yellow lupine (L. luteus, var. Juno) seeds were germinated at 21 °C on cellulose paper towels soaked with deionized sterile water. On the 6th day, the roots were removed, and the seedlings were transferred into 50-ml Falcon tubes (5 seedlings/tube) containing 1 ml of sterile water or 25 μmaminopterin (Sigma-Aldrich) in water. Hypocotyls tips were immersed in the liquid medium. After 48 h, the seedlings were transferred for 12 h to fresh tubes containing 1.5 μm[35S]Met or [35S]Hcy (15 μCi in 0.5 ml of sterile water). 35S-amino acids were used as tracers to facilitate monitoring of Hcy-thiolactone during purification; quantification was by measurements of A 240 (see below). Antifolate drugs, aminopterin, sulfonamide, or trimethoprim (from Sigma-Aldrich), were included as indicated under “Results.” The hypocotyls and coltyledons were then collected separately and frozen at −20 °C. Yellow lupine hypocotyls or cotyledons (∼1 g) were ground up at 0 °C with 1 ml of 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, using a mortar and pestle. The extracts were centrifuged at 30,000 × gusing a JA25.50 rotor in a Beckman-Coulter J2 centrifuge (15 min, 2 °C). The plant yellow lupine extracts (0.5–1 ml) were adjusted to pH 8 with di-potassium phosphate, and Hcy-thiolactone was extracted with 4 volumes of chloroform-methanol (2:1, v/v). Organic layers were reextracted with 0.1 m HCl. Aqueous layers were lyophylized on a Labconco concentrator and taken up in 50 μl of water, and 5-μl aliquots were subjected to two-dimensional TLC on 6.7 × 5-cm cellulose plates (Analtech, Newark, DE), as described previously (26Jakubowski H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30425-30428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The first dimension separation was for 30 min using 1-butanol/acetic acid/water (4:1:1, v/v). The second dimension was for 15 min using isopropanol/ethyl acetate/water/ammonia (20:20:5:0.05, v/v). [35S]Hcy-thiolactone spots were visualized by autoradiography using Kodak BioMax x-ray film, scraped off the TLC plates, extracted with 60 μl of water, and finally quantified by cation exchange HPLC (19Jakubowski H. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 308: 112-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Plasmid pET/MOsΔC, encoding rice MetRS (25Kaminska M. Deniziak M. Kerjan P. Barciszewski J. Mirande M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6907-6917Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar), was kindly supplied by Marc Mirande (Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Gif-sur-Yvette, France). The plasmid was introduced into competentE. coli BL21 (DE3) host cells (Promega). The cells were propagated on M9 minimal medium supplemented with 1 μg/ml thiamine and 50 μg/ml kanamycin (Sigma-Aldrich). Fresh overnight cultures were diluted 5-fold into fresh medium and grown for 2 h at 37 °C. The cultures were then shifted to 30 °C, supplemented with 0.2 mm Ile, 0.2 mm Leu, 0 or 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and 2.5 mmd,l-Hcy. Samples of cultures were analyzed for Hcy-thiolactone by cation exchange HPLC (19Jakubowski H. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 308: 112-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Proteins, extracted from hypocotyls of 6-day-old yellow lupine seedlings, were treated with 5 mm DTT for 5 min at room temperature and precipitated with 80% ethanol at 0 °C to remove free Hcy. The plant protein was dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5 mm DTT and precipitated with 80% ethanol. The cycle of DTT treatment and ethanol precipitation was repeated four more times. This procedure removed >99% total Hcy from plant protein extracts. Samples of DTT-treated protein were diluted to 0.1 ml with 25 mm DTT and transferred to glass ampoules (1-ml volume) containing 0.1 ml of 12 N HCl. The ampoules were sealed under vacuum, and the samples were hydrolyzed at 120 °C for 1 h. This procedure quantitatively converted Hcy-N-protein into Hcy-thiolactone. After hydrolysis, samples were lyophilized and dissolved in 10 μl of water, and 3.3-μl aliquots were subjected to two-dimensional TLC on 6.7 × 5-cm cellulose plates (Analtech) as described previously (26Jakubowski H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30425-30428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). [35S]Hcy-thiolactone, localized on TLC plates by autoradiography using Kodak BioMax x-ray film, was extracted with water (60 μl) and finally purified and quantified by cation exchange HPLC (19Jakubowski H. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 308: 112-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 26Jakubowski H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30425-30428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). To determine Hcy-N-protein relative to protein methionine in lupine plants, radiolabeled spots corresponding to Hcy-thiolactone and methionine were cut out from a duplicate set of TLC separations and quantified by using a Beckman LS6500 scintillation counter. The principle of the procedure involves the conversion of Hcy to Hcy-thiolactone, which is then quantified by HPLC (19Jakubowski H. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 308: 112-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Plant extracts were treated with 5 mm DTT to convert disulfide-bound forms of Hcy to free reduced Hcy, deproteinized by ultrafiltration through Millipore 10-kDa cut-off membranes at 4 °C. The ultra-filtrate (50 μl) was lyophilized on a SpeedVac concentrator and dissolved in 6 μl of 50 mm DTT, and Hcy was converted to Hcy-thiolactone by treatment with 3 μl of 6 m HCl for 30 min at 100 °C. After lyophylization, samples were dissolved in 50 μl of water and subjected to HPLC. HPLC analyses were carried out using a cation exchange PolySULFOETHYL Aspartamide column (2.1 × 200 mm, 5 μ, 300 Å) from PolyLC, Inc. and System Gold Noveau HPLC instrumentation from Beckman-Coulter as described previously (19Jakubowski H. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 308: 112-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 26Jakubowski H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30425-30428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Solution A (10 mm mono-sodium phosphate) and solution B (200 mm NaCl in 10 mm mono-sodium phosphate) were used as solvents. After application of sample, the column was eluted with a linear gradient from 50% to 100% solution B for 5 min, followed by 100% solution B for 0.5 min and 2-min reequilibration with 50% solution B. The effluent was monitored at multiple wavelengths, includingA 240, the UV absorption maximum of Hcy-thiolactone (ε = 3,500 m−1cm−1) (5Jakubowski H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17672-17673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 15Jakubowski H. Carmel R. Jacobsen D.W. Homocysteine in Health and Disease. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom2001: 21-31Google Scholar). For each sample, the identity of the eluted material as Hcy-thiolactone was confirmed by its co-migration with an authentic Hcy-thiolactone, by its characteristic absorbance spectrum with a maximum at A 240, and by its sensitivity to lupine Hcy-thiolactonase or NaOH. The detection limit was 5 pmol of Hcy-thiolactone. Unless indicated otherwise, incubations were carried out at 37 °C in 0.1 m potassium-Hepes buffer (pH 7.2). Hcy-thiolactonase activity was determined by following the formation of [35S]Hcy from [35S]Hcy-thiolactone. Hcy was separated from Hcy-thiolactone by TLC on cellulose plates (Analtech) and quantified by scintillation counting (22Jakubowski H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3957-3962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 23Jakubowski H. Ambrosius W. Pratt J.H. FEBS Lett. 2001; 491: 35-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Spectrophotometric assays were used in substrate specificity studies with nonradiolabeled substrates (all from Sigma). Hydrolysis of Hcy-thiolactones was determined from the decrease of their characteristic UV absorption at λ = 240 nm (ε = 3,500 m−1 cm−1) (22Jakubowski H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3957-3962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Hydrolysis of phenyl acetate and p-nitrophenyl acetate was determined spectrophotometrically using ε = 1,300m−1 cm−1 at 270 nm for phenol and ε = 13,000 m−1 cm−1 at 412 nm for p-nitrophenol, respectively. Hydrolysis of diethylp-nitrophenyl phosphate (paraoxon) was measured spectrophotometrically using ε = 13,000m−1 cm−1 at 412 nm for p-nitrophenol (22Jakubowski H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3957-3962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). In experiments in which utilization of other (thio)esters (10 mm) by Hcy-thiolactonase was tested, potential substrates and products were separated by TLC and visualized by staining with ninhydrin or under UV. With all potential substrate-product pairs, complete separation was achieved on cellulose plates (Analtech) using 1-butanol/acetic acid/water (4:1:1, v/v) as a solvent. Complete separation of acetyl-S-CoA (Sigma) and Met-S-CoA (prepared as described in Ref. 27Jakubowski H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5147-5153Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) thioesters from free CoA-SH was achieved on polyethyleneimine-cellulose plates (Sigma) using 1.2m LiCl as a solvent. All steps were carried out at 4 °C. Buffer A, B, or C containing 10, 20, or 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 6.8), respectively, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 5% glycerol was used. Yellow lupine seed (L. luteus, var. Juno) meal (100 g) was extracted with 300 ml of Buffer A. Protein (9,030 mg) in crude extract, obtained by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min, was fractionated with ammonium sulfate. Protein (2,320 mg) precipitated between 0–35% ammonium sulfate saturation was collected by centrifugation, dissolved in 5 ml of Buffer B, and extensively dialyzed against Buffer B. Dialysate was clarified by centrifugation and applied on DEAE-Sephacel column. The column was washed with 5 volumes of Buffer B and eluted with a KCl gradient in Buffer B. Protein fractions with Hcy-thiolactonase activity (60 mg), eluting at 0.3–0.35m KCl, were concentrated by ammonium sulfate precipitation, dissolved in 5 ml of Buffer C, and further purified by gel filtration on a Superdex 200 column equilibrated with Buffer C. The enzyme eluted from the gel filtration column as a protein with a molecular mass of 55 kDa. Active fractions (0.7 mg of protein) were applied on a hydroxylapatite column equilibrated with Buffer A and eluted with a gradient 10–100 mm phosphate, pH 6.8, in Buffer A. Active fractions, eluted at 75 mm phosphate, were concentrated, dialyzed against Buffer A, and stored at −20 °C. The Hcy-thiolactonase preparation (0.2 mg of protein) had a specific activity of 536 μmol/mg/h and was purified 25,000-fold. The purified enzyme preparation showed several protein bands on SDS-PAGE. In plants, Hcy is synthesizedde novo from sulfate and also as a by-product of cellular methylation reactions (Fig. 1) (28Giovanelli J. Mudd S.H. Datko A.H. Plant Physiol. 1985; 78: 555-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 29Giovanelli J. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 143: 419-426Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Three pathways of further Hcy metabolism are utilized to different extents by living organisms: methylation to methionine, trans-sulfuration to cysteine, and conversion to Hcy-thiolactone. In plants, Hcy is further metabolized by methylation to methionine by a methyltetrahydofolate-dependent methionine synthase (Fig. 1,MS) (29Giovanelli J. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 143: 419-426Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar) or byS-methyl-methionine-dependent HcyS-methyltransferase (29Giovanelli J.

Methods Enzymol. 1987; 143: 419-426Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar). MetRS-dependent metabolism of Hcy to Hcy-thiolactone, present in bacteria, yeast, and mammalian cells (15Jakubowski H.

Landes Biosciences, Georgetown, TX2003Google Scholar), was not known to be present in plants. To determine whether metabolism of Hcy to Hcy-thiolactone occurs in plants, yellow lupine seedlings were examined for the presence of Hcy-thiolactone and Hcy-thiolactone hydrolase. Before extraction of Hcy-thiolactone, 6-day-old seedlings were maintained for additional 60 h on water in the absence and presence of the antifolate drug aminopterin (25 μm), an inhibitor of eukaryotic dihydrofolate reductase enzymes (32Prabhu V. Chatson K.B. Lui H. Abrams G.D. King J. Plant. Physiol. 1998; 116: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To facilitate purification of Hcy-thiolactone from plant tissues, yellow lupine seedlings were metabolically labeled with radiotracers [35S]Met or [35S]Hcy for 12 h before harvesting. As shown in Figs. 2 B and 3, Hcy-thiolactone was present in hypocotyls of yellow lupine seedlings. Although exogenous 35Samino acids were taken up by seedlings and metabolized to [35S]Hcy-thiolactone intracellularly (Fig. 2 B), their contribution to total Hcy-thiolactone, measured by A 240 (Fig.3) synthesis, was <0.1%. Lupine tissue concentrations of Hcy-thiolactone were 49.5 μm and <0.6 μm in the presence and absence of aminopterin, respectively (Table I). The presence of up to 1 mm exogenous [35S]Hcy in culture medium did not increase Hcy-thiolactone synthesis by the plant seedlings in the presence or absence of aminopterin (not shown). Treatment of seedlings with aminopterin also increased the plant tissue total Hcy level from 4.3 μm in the absence of aminopterin to 245 μm in the presence of aminopterin. Hcy-thiolactone represented ∼20% of total Hcy concentration in hypocotyls of yellow lupine seedlings grown in the presence of aminopterin. The growth of 6-day-old lupine seedlings was reduced in the presence of aminopterin.Figure 3Cation exchange HPLC determination of Hcy-thiolactone in extracts from yellow lupine seedlings.

Other antifolates, such as trimethoprim (0.1 mm) or sulfonamide (5 mm), did not reduce growth and did not affect Hcy-thiolactone or total Hcy levels in the plants. This suggests that trimethoprim, an inhibitor of bacterial dihydrofolate reductase enzymes (33Cai X.Y. Jakubowski H. Redfield B. Zaleski B. Brot N. Weisbach H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 182: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), does not inhibit plant mitochondrial dihydrofolate reductase. The observation that Hcy or Hcy-thiolactone levels do not increase in the presence of sulfonamide, an inhibitor of de novo folate synthesis (32Prabhu V. Chatson K.B. Lui H. Abrams G.D. King J. Plant. Physiol. 1998; 116: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), suggests that endogenous methyltetrahydrofolate pools in lupine seedlings are not significantly depleted during growth. This suggestion is consistent with a study of one carbon fluxes in Arabidopsis thaliana, which indicated that cellular folate pools have a relatively long half-life in this plant (33Cai X.Y. Jakubowski H. Redfield B. Zaleski B. Brot N. Weisbach H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 182: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Because of its mostly neutral character under physiological pH (18Anderson R.F. Packer J.E. Int. J. Radiat. Phys. Chem. 1974; 6: 33-46Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar), Hcy-thiolactone is expected to diffuse out from lupine seedlings. Indeed, we have found that Hcy-thiolactone was excreted from seedlings grown in the presence of aminopterin. When yellow lupine seedlings were labeled with [35S]Hcy in the presence of aminopterin, the amount of [35S]Hcy-thiolactone excreted into medium in which seedlings were maintained represented 30% of the amount formed in hypocotyls (data not shown). In the absence of plant seedlings, no [35S]Hcy-thiolactone was formed in the aminopterin-containing medium. To determine whether plant MetRS metabolizes Hcy to Hcy-thiolactone, rice MetRS was expressed in E. coli BL21 harboring pET/MOsΔC, a plasmid bearing the rice MetRS gene under the control of the lac promotor (25Kaminska M. Deniziak M. Kerjan P. Barciszewski J. Mirande M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6907-6917Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The rate of Hcy-thiolactone synthesis in the culture of E. coliBL21/pET/MOsΔC increased about 3-fold upon induction with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Fig.4), which indicates that rice MetRS catalyzes the synthesis of Hcy-thiolactone. Supplementation of growth medium with methionine resulted in inhibition of Hcy-thiolactone synthesis in these cultures, as expected (Fig. 4). To determine whether MetRS is involved in Hcy-thiolactone synthesis in plants in vivo, yellow lupine seedlings were maintained on aminopterin in the presence of increasing concentrations of methionine. In the presence of 0.1 and 1 mm methionine, the plant tissue levels of Hcy-thiolactone dropped to 60% and 6%, respectively, of the levels observed in the absence of methionine (TableII). The inhibition by methionine is consistent with the involvement of MetRS in the synthesis of Hcy-thiolactone in lupine seedlings.Table IIMethionine inhibits the synthesis of Hcy-thiolactone in yellow lupine seedlingsMethionine supplementationLupine tissue Hcy-thiolactoneaThe concentrations were determined from Hcy-thiolactone measurements using HPLC.mmμm055.9 ± 6.00.0157.70.133.51.03.3a The concentrations were determined from Hcy-thiolactone measurements using HPLC. Open table in a new tab To determine whether Hcy is present in plant proteins, proteins from yellow lupine seedlings were extracted and depleted of free and disulfide forms of Hcy by treatments with DTT and precipitation with ethanol. Lupine proteins were then hydrolyzed with HCl in the presence of DTT. Under these conditions, Hcy, linked to protein by amide linkage (Hcy-N-protein), is converted to Hcy-thiolactone (10Jakubowski H.

As shown in Table I, the level of Hcy-N-protein in cotyledons of lupine seedlings increased after aminopterin treatment. Analysis of protein 35S-amino acids after labeling of seedlings with [35S]Met showed that [35S]Hcy-N-protein represented up to 5% of the [35S]Met-protein levels (Table I). When seedlings were labeled with [35S]Hcy in the presence of aminopterin, the conversion of [35S]Hcy to [35S]Met-protein was inhibited 85%, compared with the conversion in the absence of aminopterin (TableIII). The conversion of [35S]Hcy to [35S]Hcy-N-protein increased by 60% in the presence of aminopterin. [35S]Hcy-N-protein represented 8.3% and 87% of [35S]Met-protein in the absence and presence of aminopterin, respectively (Table III).Table IIIIncorporation of [35S]Hcy into protein in yellow lupine seedlingsGrowth conditions[35S]Hcy-N-protein,[35S]Met-protein,[35S]Hcy-N-protein/[35S]Met-proteincpmcpm%Control162 ± 141930 ± 668.3+Aminopterin259 ± 16297 ± 2387.2Six-day-old seedlings were maintained in the absence and presence of 25 μm aminopterin for 60 h and labeled with 1.5 μm [35S]Hcy (20,000 Ci/mol) for the last 12 h. The [35S]-amino acid content in proteins was determined by two-dimensional TLC of acid hydrolysates of lupine proteins as described under “Materials and Methods.” Open table in a new tab Six-day-old seedlings were maintained in the absence and presence of 25 μm aminopterin for 60 h and labeled with 1.5 μm [35S]Hcy (20,000 Ci/mol) for the last 12 h. The [35S]-amino acid content in proteins was determined by two-dimensional TLC of acid hydrolysates of lupine proteins as described under “Materials and Methods.” To determine whether plants have the ability to metabolize Hcy-thiolactone, yellow lupine seedlings were maintained on 0.75 μm [35S]Hcy-thiolactone in water. The seedlings metabolized 60% and 100% [35S]Hcy-thiolactone after 7 and 24 h, respectively. Analysis of plant extracts showed that [35S]Met was a major metabolite derived from [35S]Hcy-thiolactone after 24 h (data not shown). In the absence of yellow lupine seedlings, Hcy-thiolactone was stable under the experimental conditions utilized (half-life > 3 days). Because Hcy-thiolactone is unlikely to be metabolized without ring opening, its fast metabolism suggests that Hcy-thiolactone-hydrolyzing enzyme is present in plants. Indeed, when crude extracts from yellow lupine seeds were incubated with [35S]Hcy-thiolactone, it was hydrolyzed to [35S]Hcy at a rate of 0.21 μmol/mg/h. This level of Hcy-thiolactone-hydrolyzing activity is 3.7-fold higher than the level present in human serum (22Jakubowski H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3957-3962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Lupine Hcy-thiolactonase activity, measured in extracts from cotyledons, did not change significantly after seed germination and growth up to 6 days (data not shown). The Hcy-thiolactonase activity, precipitated from crude extracts of yellow lupine seed meal with 35% ammonium sulfate, was further purified by anion exchange chromatography on DEAE-Sephacel, gel exclusion chromatography on Superdex, and absorption chromatography on hydroxylapatite. At all steps of purification procedure, a single peak of Hcy-thiolactonase activity was observed, suggesting that a single enzyme was responsible for Hcy-thiolactone hydrolysis in yellow lupine. The specific activity of the purified Hcy-thiolactonase preparation, 536 μmol/mg/h, was 25,000-fold greater than that measured in crude extracts. The plant Hcy-thiolactonase preparation exhibited 7-fold higher specific activity than pure human Hcy-thiolactonase. Examination of the substrate specificity showed that, in addition to l-Hcy-thiolactone, the purified enzyme also hydrolyzed α-aminoacyl esters and thioesters (TableIV). For example, thioesters of methionine, such as Met-S-CoA and Met-S-DTT, and methionine methyl esters were hydrolyzed. Esters of other α-amino acids, such as methyl esters of alanine, cysteine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, and lysine, were also hydrolyzed.D-Hcy-thiolactone and D-forms of α-aminoacyl esters were hydrolyzed up to 20-fold less efficiently than thel-forms. l-Homoserine-lactone was also a substrate. However, N-acetyl-d,l-Hcy-thiolactone was not hydrolyzed. Esters of β-amino acids, such as β-Ala methyl ester, esters and thioesters of acetic acid, such asO-acetyl-l-serine and acetyl-S-CoA, and γ-methyl ester of glutamic acid were not hydrolyzed. In contrast to human Hcy-thiolactonase/paraoxonase, the plant enzyme did not hydrolyze non-natural aryl esters, such as phenyl acetate andp-nitrophenyl acetate, or the organophosphate paraoxon (Table IV).Table IVSubstrate specificities of plant and human Hcy-thiolactone hydrolasesCompoundRelative activity of plant Hcy-thiolactonaseRelative activity of human Hcy-thiolactonaseaData from Ref. 22.%%l-Hcy-thiolactone100100d-Hcy-thiolactone624d,l-Hcy-thiolactone5046N-acetyl-d,l-Hcy-thiolactone−bSymbols + or − indicate that a compound is hydrolyzed or is not hydrolyzed, respectively.−l-Hse-lactone+++++l-Methionyl-S-CoA++n.d.cn.d., not determined.Acetyl-S-CoA−−l-Methionine-S-dithiothreitol++n.d.l-Methionine methyl ester++−d-Methionine methyl ester+n.d.l-Phenylalanine ethyl estern.d.−l-Tryptophane methyl ester++−l-Lysine methyl ester+n.d.l-Cysteine methyl ester++−l-Alanine methyl ester++−β-Alanine methyl ester−−γ-Glu methyl ester−n.d.O-Acetyl-serine−−Phenyl acetate−280,000p-Nitrophenyl acetate−4,000Paraoxon−330Assays were carried out for 1 h at 30°C in 10-μl reaction mixtures containing 10 mm indicated compound, 0.1m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, and yellow lupine Hcy-thiolactonase.

Reaction products were analyzed by TLC on cellulose or polyethyleneimine-cellulose plates. The substrate specificity studies indicate that lupine Hcy-thiolactone-hydrolyzing enzyme exhibits selectivity of an α-aminoacyl-(thio)ester hydrolase. The plant Hcy-thiolactone-hydrolyzing enzyme eluted from a Superdex gel filtration column as a 55-kDa protein. The enzyme exhibited a broad pH optimum, from pH 6 to pH 8, and did not require calcium or any other divalent cation for activity. TheK m value for l-Hcy-thiolactone was 45 mm. Taken together, these data indicate that the plant enzyme is a novel Hcy-thiolactonase, fundamentally different from human Hcy-thiolactonase/paraoxonase. This work demonstrates a novel aspect of Hcy metabolism in plants: synthesis and degradation of Hcy-thiolactone in the plant yellow lupine (Fig. 1). In the synthetic pathway, Hcy is converted to Hcy-thiolactone by the plant MetRS. In the degradation pathway, Hcy-thiolactone is hydrolyzed to Hcy by a unique plant Hcy-thiolactone hydrolase. Hcy-thiolactone, a product of an error-editing reaction of MetRS in bacteria, yeast, and mammalian, including human, cells (2–17), has not been reported in plants before. As shown here, Hcy-thiolactone can be a significant component of sulfur amino acid pools in yellow lupine, particularly when the conversion of Hcy to methionine is limited by the antifolate drug aminopterin. Our results suggest that the synthesis of Hcy-thiolactone in plants is catalyzed by MetRS. The demonstration of Hcy-thiolactone synthesis also in plants supports a conclusion that Hcy editing during selection of amino acids for protein synthesis is most likely universal (15Jakubowski H. Carmel R. Jacobsen D.W. Homocysteine in Health and Disease. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom2001: 21-31Google Scholar, 16Jakubowski H. Encyclopedia of Life Sciences. 18.

Hcy-thiolactone reacts easily with protein lysine residues under physiological conditions (20Jakubowski H. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 2277-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). This reaction is responsible for the presence of Hcy in endothelial cell proteins (11Jakubowski H. Zhang L. Bardeguez A. Aviv A. Circ.

Chem. 2002; 277: 30425-30428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Our data demonstrate that Hcy is also present in yellow lupine proteins. When methylation of Hcy to methionine synthase was inhibited by the antifolate drug aminopterin, Hcy-N-protein became a major metabolite of Hcy in yellow lupine seedlings. The presence of Hcy-N-protein in mammals (26Jakubowski H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30425-30428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) and plants suggests that Hcy-N-protein is likely to be a component of Hcy metabolism in multicellular organisms. Incorporation of Hcy into protein mediated by Hcy-thiolactone is known to result in protein damage (14Jakubowski H. Biomed. Pharmacother. 2001; 55: 443-4477Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 15Jakubowski H. Carmel R. Jacobsen D.W. Homocysteine in Health and Disease.

Because of this, the ability to detoxify Hcy-thiolactone is essential for biological integrity, particularly in multicellular organisms. Indeed, specific Hcy-thiolactone hydrolase/paraoxonase, tightly associated with high density lipoprotein, exists in mammals, including humans (22Jakubowski H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3957-3962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 23Jakubowski H. Ambrosius W. Pratt J.H. FEBS Lett. 2001; 491: 35-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Our present work shows that yellow lupine plants possess a novel Hcy-thiolactone-hydrolyzing enzyme. The plant Hcy-thiolactonase is different from the human Hcy-thiolactone-hydrolyzing enzyme. For example, the plant Hcy-thiolactonase does not require calcium for activity, whereas the human Hcy-thiolactonase/paraoxonase does (22Jakubowski H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3957-3962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar,23Jakubowski H. Ambrosius W. Pratt J.H. FEBS Lett. 2001; 491: 35-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Although both enzymes hydrolyze Hcy-thiolactone, they differ in their ability to hydrolyze other (thio)esters. For example, whereas the plant enzyme hydrolyzes α-aminoacyl (thio)esters, the human enzyme does not (Table IV). On the other hand the plant enzyme does not hydrolyze phenyl and p-nitrophenyl esters of acetic acid or the organophosphate paraoxon. These artificial esters are very good substrates of the human enzyme (Table IV). In conclusion, our findings show that two novel pathways of Hcy metabolism are utilized by the plant L. luteus: 1) metabolic conversion of Hcy to Hcy-thiolactone, a fundamental editing reaction in protein synthesis, which appears to be conserved in all living organisms; and 2) hydrolysis of Hcy-thiolactone to Hcy, which thus far has been documented in multicellular organisms such as mammals and plants.

At 20 °C, for PYP characteristic, the 446-nm absorbance band displays a photocycle, in which the depletion of the 446-nm ground state absorption occurs in at least three phases, with time constants of <30 ns, 0.5 μs, and 17 μs.

In the ground state the chromophore is deprotonated and buried in a hydrophobic pocket of the protein where its negative charge is stabilized via a hydrogen bonding network. Absorption of light induces a photocycle in E-PYP, in which isomerization of the chromophore is the initial step, which leads to the formation of several transient intermediates on the femtosecond to nanosecond timescale (8Ujj L.

Within a few nanoseconds an intermediate is formed (pR465, also named I1 or PYPL; λmax = 465 nm) and red-shifted with respect to the ground state absorption maximum (λmax= 446 nm). pR465 decays into a blue-shifted intermediate (pB355, also named I2 or PYPM; λmax = 355 nm) with time constants of 200 μs and 1.2 ms (10Meyer T.E.

This latter transition is accompanied by protonation of the phenolic oxygen of the chromophore and by subsequent conformational changes of the protein (12Hendriks J. Gensch T.

So far, proteins from three other species were purified and basically characterized: (i) PYP from Rhodospirillum salexigens (16Meyer T.E. Fitch J.C. Bartsch R.G. Tollin G. Cusanovich M.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1016: 364-370Google Scholar), which shares 71% amino acid sequence identity with E-PYP and has virtually the same ground state absorption spectrum (λmax = 445 nm) and similar kinetics of photobleaching and recovery (with time constants for pB formation and pG recovery of 85 μs and 210 ms, respectively); (ii) PYP-phytochrome-related protein from Rhodospirillum centenum (17Jiang Z. Swem L.R. Rushing B.G. Devanathan S. Tollin G. Bauer C.E. Science. 1999; 285: 406-409Google Scholar), a hybrid-protein, consisting of 884 amino acids, with an N-terminal PYP domain fused to a central phytochrome-like domain and a C-terminal histidine kinase domain. When heterologously expressed and reconstituted with 4-hydroxy-cinnamic acid, Ppr displays an absorbance maximum at 434 nm and is photoactive; bleaching at 434 nm is accompanied by the initial formation of a red-shifted intermediate with a difference absorption maximum at ∼470 nm, and subsequently a blue-shifted intermediate is formed with a difference absorption maximum at ∼330 nm. The recovery to the ground state is biphasic with a fast and a very slow component (lifetimes of 0.21 ms and 46 s, respectively); and (iii) PYP from Rhodobacter sphaeroides(R-PYP), which has been characterized in some more detail (18Haker A. Hendriks J. Gensch T. Hellingwerf K.J. Crielaard W. FEBS Lett. 2000; 486: 52-56Google Scholar) and is also the subject of this study.Heterologously expressed R-PYP, reconstituted in vitro with 4-hydroxy-cinnamic acid, is a yellow-colored and photoactive protein (18Haker A. Hendriks J. Gensch T. Hellingwerf K.J. Crielaard W. FEBS Lett. 2000; 486: 52-56Google Scholar). The main absorption band with a maximum at 446 nm (R-PYP446) can be reversibly bleached by irradiation with blue light, which leads to the formation of a blue-shifted intermediate with a difference absorption maximum at 360 nm (formerly designated as pB350; because of our new results presented in this paper it is now named pB360). pB360 of R-PYP relaxes to the ground state of R-PYP446, pG446, with a time constant of 2 ms. This recovery process is ∼100-fold faster than in E-PYP and ∼23.000-fold faster than in Ppr.Moreover, the UV-visible absorption spectrum of R-PYP shows an additional peak, positioned at 360 nm, named R-PYP360. R-PYP360 and R-PYP446 are jointly part of a temperature- and pH-dependent equilibrium. R-PYP360 and R-PYP446 can be reversibly interconverted by increasing/decreasing the temperature. Lowering the temperature leads to accumulation of R-PYP360. Titration of the ground state of R-PYP in the pH range from 1.5 to 9 revealed two separate transitions, with pKa values of 3.8 and 6.5 (18Haker A. Hendriks J. Gensch T. Hellingwerf K.J. Crielaard W. FEBS Lett. 2000; 486: 52-56Google Scholar). Below pH 9 the absorbance at 446 nm decreases, whereas the absorbance at 360 nm increases at lower pH. Below pH 5, yet another spectral intermediate is formed, with a clearly further blue-shifted absorbance maximum (345 nm). This form is probably analogous to pBdark of E-PYP, which is a partially unfolded protein state, formed at low pH (pKa = 2.7) (19Hoff W.D. Van Stokkum I.H.M. Gural J. Hellingwerf K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1322: 151-162Google Scholar).In the present study we extend our analysis of the photoactive properties of R-PYP. To gain a deeper insight into the photocycle of R-PYP446 we measured laser-induced transient absorption changes, with high spectral (charged-coupled device (CCD) camera) and temporal (photomultiplier) resolution at two different temperatures. Measurements were complicated by the light sensitivity of R-PYP360, which also undergoes a photocycle after absorption of light. In addition, the protein conformation of the two forms of R-PYP was examined with respect to accessible hydrophobic surface areas, using the fluorescent polarity probe Nile Red. The isomerization and protonation state of the chromophore and some features of the hydrogen bonding network for both ground state species of R-PYP and their longest living photocycle intermediates were studied by FT-IR spectroscopy. Photoactive yellow protein (PYP)1 is a photoreceptor that has been found in several purple bacteria (1Kort R. Hoff W.D. Van West M. Kroon A.R. Hoffer S.M. Vlieg K.H. Crielaand W. Van Beeumen J.J. Hellingwerf K.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3209-3218Google Scholar). The first, and so far best studied example for this group of blue light receptors, was found in Ectothiorhodospira halophila (E-PYP) (2Meyer T.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 806: 175-183Google Scholar). The chromophore, responsible for the photophysical properties of PYP, is 4-hydroxy-cinnamic acid that is bound to Cys-69 via a thiol-ester linkage (3Hoff W.D. Dux P. Hard K. Devreese B. Nugteren-Roodzant I.M. Crielaard W. Boelens R. Kaptein R. Van Beeumen J. Hellingwerf K.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13959-13962Google Scholar, 4Baca M. Borgstahl G.E. Boissinot M. Burke P.M. Williams D.R. Slater K.A. Getzoff E.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14369-14377Google Scholar). The crystal structure of this small protein, consisting of 125 amino acids, has been solved to 1.4-Å resolution (5Borgstahl G.E. Williams D.R. Getzoff E.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6278-6287Google Scholar) and shows an α/β-fold, which has become the prototype for the folding of the Per-Arnt-Sim domain superfamily (6Pellequer J.L. Wager-Smith K.A. Kay S.A. Getzoff E.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5884-5890Google Scholar, 7Taylor B.L. Zhulin I.B. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 479-506Google Scholar). In the ground state the chromophore is deprotonated and buried in a hydrophobic pocket of the protein where its negative charge is stabilized via a hydrogen bonding network. Absorption of light induces a photocycle in E-PYP, in which isomerization of the chromophore is the initial step, which leads to the formation of several transient intermediates on the femtosecond to nanosecond timescale (8Ujj L. Devanathan S. Meyer T.E. Cusanovich M.A. Tollin G. Atkinson G.H. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 406-412Google Scholar, 9Gensch T. Gradinaru C. van Stokkum I. Hendriks J. Hellingwerf K. van Grondelle R. Chem. Phys. Lett. 2002; 356: 347-354Google Scholar). Within a few nanoseconds an intermediate is formed (pR465, also named I1 or PYPL; λmax = 465 nm) and red-shifted with respect to the ground state absorption maximum (λmax= 446 nm). pR465 decays into a blue-shifted intermediate (pB355, also named I2 or PYPM; λmax = 355 nm) with time constants of 200 μs and 1.2 ms (10Meyer T.E. Yakali E. Cusanovich M.A. Tollin G. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 418-423Google Scholar, 11Hoff W.D. van Stokkum I.H. van Ramesdonk H.J. van Brederode M.E. Brouwer A.M. Fitch J.C. Meyer T.E. van Grondelle R. Hellingwerf K.J. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 1691-1705Google Scholar). This latter transition is accompanied by protonation of the phenolic oxygen of the chromophore and by subsequent conformational changes of the protein (12Hendriks J. Gensch T. Hviid L. van Der Horst M.A. Hellingwerf K.J. van Thor J.J. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 1632-1643Google Scholar, 13Xie A. Kelemen L. Hendriks J. White B.J. Hellingwerf K.J. Hoff W.D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1510-1517Google Scholar). It is suggested that pB355 is the signaling state of PYP. From pB355the ground state pG446 is recovered in a biexponential process with time constants of 200 ms and ∼1 s (11Hoff W.D. van Stokkum I.H. van Ramesdonk H.J. van Brederode M.E. Brouwer A.M. Fitch J.C. Meyer T.E. van Grondelle R. Hellingwerf K.J. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 1691-1705Google Scholar). The pR465 to pB355 and pB355 to pG446 transitions are very sensitive to both temperature and pH (14Genick U.K. Devanathan S. Meyer T.E. Canestrelli I.L. Williams E. Cusanovich M.A. Tollin G.
