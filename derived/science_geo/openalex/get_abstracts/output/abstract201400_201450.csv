https://openalex.org/W2040081525,A technique for the selection of induced and spontaneous auxotrophic mutants of Neurospora in relatively high frequency is described. The method takes advantage of the reduced rate of death of germinating conidia of an inositol-requiring strain when a secondary mutation is imposed.

It is possible that the abnormal properties which characterize the acidic methemoglobin derivatives result from a crevice configuration of the heme, with two Feprotein bonds."
https://openalex.org/W2071094437,The effect of thyroxin on the in vitro incorporation of dl-leucine-l-C(14) into the protein of rat liver homogenates has been investigated. Both thyroxin pretreatment in vivo and thyroxin in vitro at a concentration of 1 x 10(-5) M were found to increase the rate of amino acid incorporation. The increased activity following the thyroxin pretreatment in vivo was found to be localized in the mitochondrial fraction. It is suggested that the acceleration of metabolic rate characteristic of thyroxin action may be secondary to the stimulation of energy-requiring reactions such as protein synthesis.
https://openalex.org/W2011197534,"THE in vivo studies of Schayer1 have shown ring N-methylation to be the principal pathway of histamine metabolism in a variety of mammalian species. His work demonstrates the following scheme: Kobayashi2 found that incubation of histamine with whole-liver homogenates resulted in the formation of 1-methylimidazole-4-acetic acid. These observations reflect the summation of at least three enzymatic processes, one of which is concerned with the synthesis of a co-factor needed for histamine methylation. This report describes the isolation and properties of an enzyme, imidazole N-methyl transferase, which catalyses the ring-N-methylation of histamine requiring S-adenosylmethionine as the methyl donor."

It is concluded that protein synthesis occurs continuously within nuclear chromatin."

https://openalex.org/W1971903797,"Withdrawal and subsequent restoration of deoxyriboside to a deoxyriboside-requiring mutant leads to synchronous cell division. There is a time lag between restoration and the first synchronous division; during this time the amount of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) per cell increases in stepwise fashion, and tnass per cell increases linearly with time. The onset of cell division is heralded by cessation of DNA synthesis and an abrupt increase in rate of mass synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W2010241275,Abdominal stretch-receptor organs of Astacus leptodactylus are investigated by means of extra- and intracellular leads. The effects of changing temperature on steady-state rate of activity are surprisingly low. The sensory nerve cell compensates for changes in temperature by means of opposite reactions of generator potential and threshold.
https://openalex.org/W2022296310,"Microscopically, most clinical carcinomas appear as aggregates of neoplastic cells in a matrix of connective tissue. As the tumor grows, increasing numbers of nests of cells are seen. Studies in which matrix tissue culture techniques are used implicate factors intrinsic to the aggregate in the continuing propagation of new nests of cells."

One migrates with the same Rf as standard bromsulfalein; the other three move less fast. The major band, which accounts for 71.3 percent of the injected bromsulfalein, appears to be a conjugate of bromsulfalein with glycine and glutamic acid."

https://openalex.org/W2039161729,"It is generally thought that fusion of intermittent photic stimuli occurs when the duration between successive pulses of light is reduced to a certain value, this value being a function of the illumination and viewing conditions. The findings described in this report show that fusion is determined not only by the duration between successive stimuli but also by the temporal pattern of successive stimuli."

This demonstrated the in vivo escape of Ba(137m) from sites of Cs(137) accumulation. Liver tissue was slightly deficient in Ba(137m), whereas tissues such as bone marrow and spleen showed little or no deviation from equilibrium."

However, it is very susceptible to the action of certain chemical carcinogens2,3, developing a high incidence of tumours of the skin or breast when the chemicals are administered in an appropriate way. Dmochowski and Orr4 showed that breast tumours so induced lacked the virus-like mammary tumour agent."

https://openalex.org/W1992399653,"An experiment was conducted on 120 human subjects to test the hypothesis that the probability distribution of serial errors is an invariant property of rote memorization. Contrary to the hypothesis, the relative difficulty function was significantly affected by ability to learn. There was a systematic tendency (p < .05) for fast learners to commit proportionately more errors in the middle of the sequence."

https://openalex.org/W1978903971,"IN assaying antibiotic substances by any of the well-known plate diffusion methods it is necessary to dilute the unknown solution to varying degrees, depending on the original concentration. In addition to minimizing the possible disturbing influence of interfering substances and the pH of the original sample in the assay plate, this procedure has the practical convenience of providing inhibitory zones of a suitable size-range needed for a satisfactory assay. However, if one could run good assays on the original concentrated samples without resorting to serial dilution it would simplify the assay procedures. We have found that such a step is possible with the use of a micrometer syringe which would enable one to spot micro-volumes directly on the assay plate with great accuracy. These minute volumes dry rapidly and form discrete spots, giving uniformly circular inhibition zones after allowing proper diffusion and incubation periods."

This is exactly the result obtained with similar variations in reward schedules. It seems that essentially ""meaningless"" changes in stimulation can reinforce behavior, too."

https://openalex.org/W2060005947,"GENE conversion was the name given by Winkler1 to the transformation in a heterozygote of a + allele into a mutant allele, or of one mutant into another. He intended to explain recombination and crossing-over through digenic conversion of allele A into a in one chromosome and simultaneously of a into A in its homologue. Monogenic conversion, in only one chromosome, should also be possible, but this would not easily be distinguished from mutation. More recently, conversion has been used only in the monogenic sense2 in which it is demonstrated chiefly through tetrad analysis from heterozygotes Aa when the expected Mendelian segregation of 2A : 2a is not obtained."
