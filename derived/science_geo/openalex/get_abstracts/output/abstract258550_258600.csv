We have recently demonstrated that CXCR3 plays a critical role in metastasis of mouse melanoma cells to lymph nodes. Here, we show that some human colon cancer cell lines express CXCR3 constitutively. We constructed cells that expressed CXCR3 cDNA ('DLD-1-CXCR3'), and compared with nonexpressing controls by rectal transplantation in nude mice. Although both cell lines disseminated to lymph nodes at similar frequencies at 2 weeks, DLD-1-CXCR3 expanded more rapidly than the control in 4 weeks. In 6 weeks, 59% of mice inoculated with DLD1-CXCR3 showed macroscopic metastasis in para-aortic lymph nodes, whereas only 14% of those with the control (P<0.05). In contrast, metastasis to the liver or lung was rare, and unaffected by CXCR3 expression. In clinical colon cancer samples, we found expression of CXCR3 in 34% cases, most of which had lymph node metastasis. Importantly, patients with CXCR3-positive cancer showed significantly poorer prognosis than those without CXCR3, or those expressing CXCR4 or CCR7. These results indicate that activation of CXCR3 with its ligands stimulates colon cancer metastasis preferentially to the draining lymph nodes with poorer prognosis."

Drosophila cryptochrome (dCRY) is a blue light photoreceptor that is involved in the synchronization of the circadian clock with the environmental light-dark cycle. Until now, spectroscopic and structural studies on this and other animal cryptochromes have largely been hampered by difficulties in their recombinant expression. We have therefore established an expression and purification scheme that enables us to purify mg amounts of monomeric dCRY from Sf21 insect cell cultures. Using UV-visible spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and reversed phase high pressure liquid chromatography, we show that insect cell-purified dCRY contains flavin adenine dinucleotide in its oxidized state (FADox) and residual amounts of methenyltetrahydrofolate. Upon blue light irradiation, dCRY undergoes a reversible absorption change, which is assigned to the conversion of FADox to the red anionic FAD⋅¯ radical. Our findings lead us to propose a novel photoreaction mechanism for dCRY, in which FADox corresponds to the ground state, whereas the FAD⋅¯ radical represents the light-activated state that mediates resetting of the Drosophila circadian clock.

Cryptochromes do not exhibit any DNA repair activities, despite significant sequence homology of plant cryptochromes to CPD-photolyases and animal cryptochromes to (6-4)-photolyases (5Partch C.L.

Blue light absorption, phosphorylation, and effector interactions of plant cryptochromes control fundamental biological processes such as de-etiolation and flowering onset (7Sullivan J.A. Deng X.W.

Rev. 2003; 103: 2203-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar), blue light activation leads to the formation of a neutral blue FADH·radical. Whereas in AtCRY1 FADox is photoreduced to FADH·upon blue light illumination, the FADH·radical in photolyases is produced after a blue light-activated electron transfer from FADH- to the Pyr<>Pyr substrate. Animal cryptochromes, either as photoreceptors or integral components of biological clocks, play crucial roles in the generation of 24-h (circadian) rhythms or their synchronization with the environmental light-dark cycle (6Lin C.

Drosophila cryptochrome (dCRY) is a blue light photoreceptor mediating light synchronization of the circadian clock (14Stanewsky R. Kaneko M. Emery P. Beretta B. Wager-Smith K. Kay S.A. Rosbash M. Hall J.C. Cell. 1998; 95: 681-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar, 15Emery P. So W.V. Kaneko M. Hall J.C. Rosbash M. Cell. 1998; 95: 669-679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). The Drosophila clock is operated by a transcriptional and translational feedback loop in which the clock proteins Period and Timeless (dTIM) inhibit their own transcription by negatively regulating the transcription factors dClock and dCycle (16Young M.W. Kay S.A. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2001; 2: 702-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). dCRY resets the Drosophila clock by sequestering dTIM from the feedback loop through light-dependent dCRY-dTIM interactions (17Ceriani M.F. Darlington T.K. Staknis D. Mas P. Petti A.A. Weitz C.J. Kay S.A. Science. 1999; 285: 553-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar), which trigger the proteasomal degradation of dTIM (18Naidoo N. Song W. Hunter-Ensor M. Sehgal A. Science. 1999; 285: 1737-1741Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) and dCRY (19Lin F.J. Song W. Meyer-Bernstein E. Naidoo N. Sehgal A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7287-7294Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The dCRY molecule comprises a chromophore-binding photolyase homology region (PHR) (514 amino acids) and a unique C-terminal extension (28 amino acids) referred to as “tail” region (Fig. 1). Binding to its effector dTIM and light signaling to the clock is mediated by the PHR domain of dCRY. The tail region prevents the dCRY-dTIM interaction and stabilizes dCRY in the dark (20Rosato E. Codd V. Mazzotta G. Piccin A. Zordan M. Costa R. Kyriacou C.P. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 909-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 21Busza A. Emery-Le M. Rosbash M. Emery P. Science. 2004; 304: 1503-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). A light-induced conformational change, possibly governed by intramolecular redox reactions, appears to be required to displace the tail region and to allow for dCRY-dTIM interactions and subsequent dTIM and dCRY degradation. To date, no spectroscopic data on the blue light responses of dCRY or any other animal cryptochrome are available. To study the photochemistry of dCRY as a circadian blue light photoreceptor, we have established an expression and purification scheme that enables us to purify mg amounts of monomeric dCRY from Sf21 insect cell cultures. The chromophore content of the purified material is analyzed by UV-visible absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), and reversed phase high pressure liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) analysis. We show that insect cell purified dCRY contains FAD in its oxidized state (FADox) and residual amounts of MTHF. Intriguingly, dCRY undergoes a reversible absorption change upon blue light irradiation, which is assigned to the conversion of FADox to an anionic FAD⋅¯ radical. These findings lead us to propose a novel photoreaction mechanism for dCRY, which is expected to have crucial implications for the resetting mechanism of the Drosophila circadian clock. Virus Generation—Full-length Drosophila cryptochrome (dCRY 1-542) was heterologously expressed in Sf21 insect cells using the Bac-to-Bac System (Invitrogen). A dCRY fusion protein comprising an N-terminal His6 tag followed by a tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site for removal of the hexahistidine moiety was subcloned into the pFastBac-HTb vector (Invitrogen) using the restriction sites NotI and XhoI. Tag removal yielded a recombinant dCRY protein with a 19-residue extension (GAMGSGIERPTSTSSLVAA) at the N terminus corresponding to a molecular mass of 64,155 Da. Recombinant bacmid DNA was generated after a transposition step in the Escherichia coli DH10Bac strain and isolated according to the manufacturer's protocols. For recombinant virus generation, 1 × 106 Sf21 cells were transfected using Cellfectin reagent (Invitrogen). The parental virus was isolated 3 days after infection. After two more amplification steps, the P3 high titer stock with usually ≥1 × 108 plaque-forming units/ml was obtained and used for subsequent large scale expressions. Cell Culture and Recombinant Protein Expression—Sf21 cells were grown as suspension cultures at 27 °C in TC100 complete medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) and 1% (v/v) Pleuronic-F68 (Invitrogen). For expression in a 1 liter of culture, 2.5 × 109 cells were infected with the third passage virus at an optimized multiplicity of infection and incubated at 60 rpm in Fernbach flasks. Optimal expression kinetics were established in pilot studies. The cells were centrifuged at 500 × g, and the pellet was washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in 30 ml of buffer A (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, at 4 °C, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol (β-ME)), and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen prior to storage at -20 °C. Purification of dCRY—For purification of dCRY, pellets from 5 liters of expression cultures were thawed on ice and homogeneously resuspended in buffer A supplemented with Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor tabs (Roche Applied Science) and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cells were lysed using a Branson 450 sonifier equipped with a microtip, and the lysate was spun for 60 min at 100,000 × g. The supernatant was loaded onto a DEAE-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) preequilibrated with buffer A. The column was processed by applying a linear gradient ranging from 0 to 100% buffer B (buffer A + 500 mm NaCl). dCRY-containing fractions were pooled, adjusted to 300 mm NaCl, and loaded on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (Qiagen). dCRY was eluted in buffer C (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, at 4 °C, 300 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol (v/v), 2 mm β-ME) applying a linear gradient of 25-300 mm imidazol. Affinity purified dCRY was concentrated to 10 mg/ml according to Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) using an Amicon Ultra-15 filter device (Millipore, Bedford, MA) with a 30-kDa molecular mass cut-off (MWCO). The concentrated material was subjected to gel filtration on a HiLoad S200 16/60 column (GE Healthcare) using a buffer system containing 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, at 4 °C, 150 mm NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol and 2 mm β-ME. For analytical gel filtration runs, a HiLoad S200 10/30 (GE Healthcare) column was used with a running buffer containing 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, at 4 °C, 300 mm NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, and 2mm β-ME. Fractions containing highly purified and monomeric dCRY were pooled, concentrated to typically 13 mg/ml (200 μm) and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. The samples were stored at -80 °C until measured. UV-visible absorption spectra of purified dCRY were recorded using an Uvikon 933 spectrophotometer (Kontron, Neufahrn, Germany) at room temperature with cuvettes of 1-cm path length. The dCRY sample was measured at a concentration of 13 mg/ml (200 μm). Flavin fluorescence spectra were recorded on a RF-1501 Fluorimeter (Shimadzu, Duisburg, Germany) with a bandwidth of 10 nm using a 450-nm excitation wavelength for the emission spectra and a 530-nm emission wavelength for the excitation spectra. The detection of the folate chromophore was performed using a FluoroMax II Fluorimeter (Spex Industries, Edison, NJ) by recording emission spectra at an excitation wavelength of 380 nm and excitation spectra at an emission wavelength of 460 nm. Purified dCRY was mixed in a 1:1 ratio (v/v) with a saturated α-cyano-4-hydroxy-cinnamicacid (CHCA; Sigma) MALDI matrix solution dissolved in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid and 50% (v/v) acetonitrile. 1 μl of this protein-matrix mixture was spotted on a MALDI steel target plate (100-well plate; Applied Biosystems) and allowed to air dry. The measurements were carried out using a Voyager-DE™ MALDI-TOF-MS PRO BioSpectrometry™ work station (PerSpective Biosystems) with delayed extraction and a nitrogen laser (337.1 nm) in the linear mode. External mass calibration was performed using the c1 calibration mixture (Applied Biosystems; Foster City, CA) with des-Arg1-bradykinin (905.05; [M + H]+), angiotensin I (1297.51; [M + H]+), Glu1-fibrinopeptide B (1571.61; [M + H]+), and neurotensin (1673.96; [M + H]+) in a 1:1 mixture (v/v) with a saturated CHCA matrix solution (dissolved in 50% (v/v) acetonitrile, 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid). After calibration, mass analysis was performed with the Voyager™ 5.1 Software Data Explorer™ (Applied Biosystems). 30-μl samples of purified dCRY at various concentrations were heat-denatured for 3 min at 97 °C and spun at 13 krpm for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant containing the released chromophores was subjected to RP-HPLC analysis using the protocol described in Ref. 22Jung A. Domratcheva T. Tarutina M. Wu Q. Ko W.H. Shoeman R.L. Gomelsky M. Gardner K.H. Schlichting I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 12350-12355Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar with a Waters (Toronto, Ontario, Canada) Chromatography System and a C18 reversed phase column (Hypersil-ODS, Bischoff Chromatography, Leonberg, Germany). Flavin chromophores and MTHF were followed by absorption at 370 nm. To quantify the chromophore loading, a 150 μm dCRY solution was denatured and subjected to RP-HPLC analysis. The percentage of FAD loading was determined by comparing the integrated peak areas with an FAD calibration curve (50, 150, and 200 μm FAD). MTHF degradation products, which do not absorb at wavelengths >300 nm, were checked for by diode array detection. Series of UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded using a Shimadzu UV 2401 spectrometer with a spectral bandwidth of 2 nm. The temperature of the sample was adjusted to 10 °C by a circulating water bath. A light-emitting diode (Luxeon Star; Lumileds) with an emission maximum at 445 nm (14 nm full width at half-maximum) provided 19 milliwatts/cm2 of blue light at the sample. dCRY was photoreduced by blue light illumination for 100 s. The spectrum of 100% product formation was calculated by subtracting the spectrum of the dark form from that obtained after 100 s of illumination. The limit of subtraction was reached when an untypical shoulder appeared at 500 nm in the product spectrum (23Massey V. Palmer G. Biochemistry (Mosc.). 1966; 5: 3181-3189Crossref Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Time traces of dCRY dark recovery were recorded at 450 nm after a 10-s illumination with blue light. Fitting a single exponential curve to these experimental data did not yield satisfying results, showing that one time constant was not sufficient to describe the decay. Therefore, a biexponential function was used that resulted in an almost perfect match of the curves. The two obtained time constants describe the time until all but 1/e ≈ 37% of the molecules recovered to the dark form. dCRY protein was diluted in 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol (v/v), and 2 mm β-ME. Anaerobic conditions were produced by directing a stream of argon onto the solution for 40 min. β-ME was removed by passage through a Sephadex G 25 column (PD-10; Amersham Biosciences). Lyophilized glucose oxidase from Aspergillus niger (Sigma-Aldrich G 2133) was dissolved in 110 mm sodium phosphate, pH 9.2, 90 mm NaCl, and 9 mm EDTA. Possible traces of free chromophore were removed by ultrafiltration using a filter with a 10-kDa cut-off (Vivaspin 500; Vivasciences, Hannover, Germany). Glucose oxidase was rendered anaerobic and photoreduced with blue light (445-nm light-emitting diode, 19 milliwatts/cm2) for a time period of 2 h. Structural models of dCRY were created by the program Modeller (24Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10636) Google Scholar) using the automodel command. Crystal structures of E. coli photolyase (Protein Data Bank code 1DNP) (25Park H.W. Kim S.T. Sancar A. Deisenhofer J. Science. 1995; 268: 1866-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar) and of Cryptochrome 3 from A. thaliana (Protein Data Bank code 2IJG) (26Huang Y. Baxter R. Smith B.S. Partch C.L. Colbert C.L. Deisenhofer J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 17701-17706Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) were used as template structures because of the presence of MTHF. Pairwise alignments of dCRY and template sequences were created with the MUSCLE algorithm (27Edgar R.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 1792-1797Crossref PubMed Scopus (31027) Google Scholar) and modified, when necessary, to avoid the disruption of secondary structures. Model structures were superimposed on template structures using the combinatorial extension method (28Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 739-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (1702) Google Scholar). Both ligands, FAD and MTHF, were placed in the corresponding binding pockets, yielding only few unfavorable contacts between the ligands and adjacent protein side chains. These unfavorable contacts were removed by a conformational search of the clashing residues finding the conformations with minimal interaction energy between them, the ligands, and the rest of the protein. The models were refined by a short minimization (150 steps) of complex energies with fixed positions of the ligands. Refinement was performed with the program CHARMm (29Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. States D.J. Swaminathan S. Karplus M. J. Comput. Chem. 1983; 4: 187-217Crossref Scopus (14019) Google Scholar) using the default parameters for energy calculations. Expression and Purification of dCRY from Sf21 Insect Cells—Full-length Drosophila cryptochrome (dCRY [1-542]) fused to an N-terminal hexahistidine tag was recombinantly expressed and purified from Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf21) insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (Fig. 2). After cell lysis and centrifugation, the cleared lysate from typically 5 liters of insect cell expression culture was initially purified on a DEAE-Sepharose anion exchange column (Fig. 2A). This purification step enhanced dCRY stability by removing (next to other contaminating proteins) proteases that otherwise led to proteolytic degradation of dCRY. dCRY-containing fractions, which were colored yellowish because of the presence of chromophore, were pooled and subjected to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity (Fig. 2B) and size exclusion chromatography (Fig. 2C). The described purification scheme resulted in overall yields of 3-5 mg of highly purified photoreceptor/liter of cell culture (Fig. 2, C and D). The identity of the purified protein was confirmed by mass spectrometry (data not shown). Comparison with standard proteins suggests that purified dCRY behaves as a monomer under analytical gel filtration conditions (Fig. 2E). Analysis of Chromophore Content—The yellow color of the purified dCRY protein (Fig. 2D) suggested that the isolated photoreceptor contains FAD and possibly MTHF, as present in other spectroscopically characterized cryptochrome/photolyase family members (2Sancar A. Chem. Rev. 2003; 103: 2203-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar, 5Partch C.L. Sancar A. Photochem. Photobiol. 2005; 81: 1291-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). We have analyzed the chromophore content of dCRY by absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy as well as MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and RP-HPLC. Absorption spectra of freshly purified dCRY show maxima at 475, 450, 428, 374, and 360 nm, consistent with the presence of oxidized FAD (Fig. 3; see also Fig. 7A, dark form) (2Sancar A. Chem. Rev. 2003; 103: 2203-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar). Because in photolyases MTHF strongly absorbs with a maximum at 380-410 nm (30Malhotra K. Kim S.T. Sancar A. Biochemistry (Mosc.). 1994; 33: 8712-8718Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar), the absorption spectrum of dCRY does not speak to the presence of significant MTHF amounts. The chromophore content was further analyzed by fluorescence spectroscopy. To detect the presence of the flavin moiety, we recorded excitation spectra for emission at 530 nm and emission spectra for excitation at 450 nm. Consistent with the presence of FAD, we observed two excitation maxima at 370 and 450 nm and a strong emission signal at 530 nm (Fig. 4A). However, the absence of any fine structure and the similarity of the dCRY fluorescence profile with that of free FAD suggests that the fluorescence signal might arise from small amounts of free FADox. It therefore appears that the dCRY-bound FADox evidenced by the fine structure of the absorption spectra (Fig. 3; see also Fig. 7A) does not exhibit significant fluorescence, likely because of a very short fluorescence life time. Based on the known cryptochrome and photolyase structures (25Park H.W. Kim S.T. Sancar A. Deisenhofer J. Science. 1995; 268: 1866-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 31Brautigam C.A. Smith B.S. Ma Z. Palnitkar M. Tomchick D.R. Machius M. Deisenhofer J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 12142-12147Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), FAD is expected to bind to dCRY in a U-shaped conformation. The U-shape might allow for a photoinduced electron transfer between the adenine and the isoalloxazine ring, thereby causing a short fluorescence life time as has been determined for cryptochrome 3 from A. thaliana (32Song S.H. Dick B. Penzkofer A. Pokorny R. Batschauer A. Essen L.O. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B. 2006; 85: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Additionally, electron transfer from adjacent amino acids to FAD is thought to contribute to fluorescence life time quenching (32Song S.H. Dick B. Penzkofer A. Pokorny R. Batschauer A. Essen L.O. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B. 2006; 85: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). For detection of MTHF, emission spectra were recorded for excitation at 380 nm, and excitation spectra were recorded for emission at 460 nm. The emission spectra showed a strong peak at 520 nm and a small peak at 460 nm (Fig. 4B). Whereas the 520 nm peak again documents the presence of FAD, the peak at 460 nm is indicative of residual amounts of MTHF, as previously reported for Vibrio cholerae CRY2 (33Worthington E.N. Kavakli I.H. Berrocal-Tito G. Bondo B.E. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39143-39154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). However, this peak was not observed in some other dCRY preparations, and moreover, no significant signal was obtained in excitation spectra for 460-nm emission. We conclude that at best a small proportion of the insect cell-purified dCRY contains MTHF.FIGURE 7Blue light-induced absorption changes of dCRY are assigned to the conversion of oxidized FAD to the red anionic FAD radical.

Absorption maxima at 655, 605, 472, 403, and 367 nm show the formation of the red anionic FAD radical (FAD⋅¯) from the oxidized state (FADox). B, reference spectra for oxidized and anionic radical states of flavin in glucose oxidase; comparison with dCRY. C, reaction scheme for the conversion of oxidized FAD to the anionic FAD radical upon blue light irradiation of dCRY and its dark recovery. D, normalized absorbance difference spectra (“after” minus “before” illumination). Difference spectra obtained under anaerobic and aerobic conditions, each in the presence and absence of β-ME, are superimposed. Under all of the tested reaction conditions, FADox is converted to the anionic FAD radical FAD⋅¯. E, dark recovery of FADox monitored as increase of absorbance at 450 nm over time. The samples were irradiated with 19 milliwatts/cm2 445-nm blue light for 10 s. Whereas the rate of FAD radical generation depends on the presence/absence of β-ME (compare black and green lines with, respectively, red and blue lines), the recovery speed of dCRY depends on the presence of oxygen (compare black and red lines with, respectively, green and blue lines). Time constants for dark recovery are several hours for anaerobic conditions (0 (green) or 2 mm (blue) β-ME). Under aerobic conditions (0 (black) or 2 mm (red) β-ME), ∼50% of the molecules recover with time constants of 4-5 min, the other 50% with 20-30 min time constants, and <1% of the molecules do not return.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 4Fluorescence spectra of dCRY identify its intrinsic chromophore content.

Furthermore, a strong peak for folic acid is observed at 440.93 Da (theoretical mass 442.4; [M + H]+), and a smaller peak is observed for tetrahydrofolic acid at 445.84 Da (theoretical mass 446.4; [M + H]+), suggesting that MTHF is partially degraded to these compounds during protein purification. The low MTHF fluorescence signal obtained with our purified dCRY is therefore likely to be correlated with the weak fluorescence of its folic acid degradation product"
https://openalex.org/W2047929507,"Acquisition of drug resistance is one of the main obstacles encountered in cancer chemotherapy. Overexpression of multi-drug resistance 1 (MDR1) gene and its protein product P-glycoprotein, accompanied with a decrease in doxorubicin accumulation level, was observed in doxorubicin-resistant R-HepG2 cells, a subline derived by selection of human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells with doxorubicin. In addition, Northern-blot analysis revealed an eight fold upregulation of the imprinted H19 mRNA in R-HepG2 cells. H19 knockdown by transfection with antisense H19 oligonucleotides suppressed the MDR1/P-glycoprotein expression, increased the cellular doxorubicin accumulation level and sensitized doxorubicin toxicity in both HepG2 parent cells and R-HepG2 cells. Results from methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction analysis indicated that the MDR1 gene promoter was hypomethylated in R-HepG2 cells. Antisense H19 oligonucleotides transfection induced a marked increase in the percentage of MDR1 promoter methylation and decrease in MDR1 expression in R-HepG2 cells. Thus, the H19 gene is believed to induce P-glycoprotein expression and MDR1-associated drug resistance at least in liver cancer cells through regulation of MDR1 promoter methylation."
https://openalex.org/W2059356721,"Occludin is hyperphosphorylated on Ser and Thr residues in intact epithelial tight junction (TJ); however, the role of this phosphorylation in the assembly of TJ is unclear. The influence of protein phosphatases PP2A and PP1 on the assembly of TJ and phosphorylation of occludin was evaluated in Caco-2 cells. Protein phosphatase inhibitors and reduced expression of PP2A-Cα and PP1α accelerated the calcium-induced increase in transepithelial electrical resistance and barrier to inulin permeability and also enhanced the junctional organization of occludin and ZO-1 during TJ assembly. Phosphorylation of occludin on Thr residues, but not on Ser residues, was dramatically reduced during the disassembly of TJ and was gradually increased during the reassembly. PP2A and PP1 co-immunoprecipitate with occludin, and this association was reduced during the assembly of TJ. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assay using recombinant GST-occludin demonstrated that cellular PP2A and PP1 bind to the C-terminal tail of occludin, and these interactions were also reduced during the assembly of TJ. A pairwise binding assay using GST-occludin and purified PP2A and PP1 demonstrates that PP2A and PP1 directly interacts with the C-terminal tail of occludin. In vitro incubation of phospho-occludin with PP2A or PP1 indicated that PP2A dephosphorylates occludin on phospho-Thr residues, whereas PP1 dephosphorylates it on phospho-Ser.

Although the significance of Ser/Thr phosphorylation of occludin in TJ assembly is unclear, occludin is shown to undergo dephosphorylation on Ser/Thr residues during the disruption of TJ by calcium depletion, phorbol esters, or bacterial infection (28Farshori P. Kachar B. J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 170: 147-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 29Simonovic I. Rosenberg J. Koutsouris A. Hecht G. Cell.

Phosphorylation of occludin on Ser/Thr residues may be mediated by atypical protein kinase C (PKC), such as PKCζ and PKCλ, which are localized in the vicinity of TJ (10Stuart R.O. Nigam S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6072-6076Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). A previous study indicated that PP2A, a Ser/Thr-phosphatase, interacts with TJ protein complex and suggested that it may influence the integrity of TJ in MDCK cells that overexpress PP2A (31Nunbhakdi-Craig V. Machleidt M. Ogris E. Bellotto D. White C.L. Sontag E. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 967-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Therefore, the balance between atypical PKC and PP2A may determine the Ser/Thr phosphorylation status of occludin. In the present study we examined the influence of endogenous PP2A and PP1 on the calcium switch-induced assembly of TJ in Caco-2 cells. This study demonstrates that 1) inhibition of PPase activity by selective inhibitors and reduced expression of PP2A-Cα or PP1α by siRNA and/or antisense oligonucleotides accelerates the assembly of TJ, 2) the assembly of TJ is associated with the phosphorylation of occludin on Thr residues, which is enhanced by reduced expression of PP2A, 3) PP2A and PP1 directly interact with occludin, and their interaction with occludin is reduced during the assembly of TJ, and 4) PP2A dephosphorylates occludin on p-Thr residues, whereas PP1 dephosphorylates it on p-Ser. Chemicals—Cell culture reagents and supplies and Oligofectamine® were purchased from Invitrogen. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-inulin, GSH, leupeptin, aprotinin, bestatin, pepstatin A, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, GSH-agarose, Triton X 100, vanadate, Malachite green, protein-A-Sepharose, and protein-G-Sepharose were purchased from Sigma. Okadaic acid, fostriecin, and calyculin-A were purchased from Calbiochem. Purified PP2A, PP1, and phosphopeptide, RRApSVA (pS is phosphoserine), were purchased from Upstate (Charlottesville, VA). The PPase substrate phosphopeptide (KRpTIRR) and p-Tyr peptide DADEpYLIPQQG were custom synthesized by Sigma Genosys (St. Louis, MO). All other chemicals were of analytical grade purchased either from Sigma or Fisher. Antibodies—Mouse monoclonal anti-PP2A-Cα, anti-PP1α, HRP-conjugated anti-GST, and anti-PKCζ antibodies were purchased from BD Transduction. Mouse monoclonal anti-occludin, rabbit polyclonal anti-ZO-1, HRP-conjugated anti-occludin, rabbit polyclonal anti-p-Thr, and anti-p-Ser antibodies were purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (San Francisco, CA). AlexaFluor 488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody was obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG, HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG, anti-actin, and HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibodies were purchased from Sigma. The specificity of anti-p-Thr and anti-p-Ser antibodies was confirmed by immunoblotting control cell extracts for p-Thr and p-Ser in the presence of varying concentrations of different peptides; RRApSVA, KRpTIRR, or DADEpYLIPQQG. Results are presented in Fig. 7, C and D. Antisense Oligonucleotide and siRNA—Antisense oligonucleotides were designed against the nucleotide sequence of the genes for catalytic subunits of human PP2A and human PP1. The nucleotide sequences of PP2A and PP1 were compared with each other using the ClustalW program, and unique sequences were selected for each protein. To determine the specificity of these oligos, the sequences were further verified by BLAST search of the known human genome databases, and no matches were found other than the respective proteins, confirming the uniqueness of these nucleotide sequences. The sequences of antisense oligos for PP2A and PP1 and the missense oligo are as follows: AS-PP2A-1, ttccggtcatggcaccagtt; AS-PP2A-2, ccttatctacagtcatgctg; AS-PP2A-3, cagtcacatcgtcttacagg; AS-PP1-1, gatgggtcggcctccagggt; AS-PP1-2, ctgaactgcccgtacttccc; AS-PP1-3, tttggcggaattgcggggtg; missense oligo, tatacgatggtacagtggagt. The sequence of the missense oligo did not match any sequence for human proteins. These antisense oligonucleotides were custom synthesized in the phosphorothioate and Cy3-conjugated form by Sigma Genosys and were purified by high performance liquid chromatography. siRNA to human PP2A-Cα and scrambled RNA control were purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). Cell Culture—Caco-2 cells, purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA), were grown under standard cell culture conditions as described before (19Rao R.K. Basuroy S. Rao V.U. Karnaky K.J. Gupta A. (2002) Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Cells were grown on polycarbonate membranes in Transwells (6.5, 12, or 24 mm; Costar, Cambridge, MA), and experiments were conducted 11-13 days (6.5 or 12 mm Transwells) or 17-19 days (24 mm Transwells) post-seeding. TJ Assembly by Calcium Switch—Caco-2 cell monolayers were treated with 4 mm EGTA in both the apical and basal compartments until the transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) was reduced to about 15-17% that of basal values (usually reduced from 300 to 50 ohms·cm2); this was monitored by measuring TER every 5 min, and the average time recorded for EGTA treatment was 30 min. The cells were then quickly washed three times with DMEM to remove all traces of EGTA and incubated in regular DMEM containing calcium for varying times. The integrity of TJ was analyzed by measuring TER and unidirectional flux of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated inulin. Treatment with PPase Inhibitors—Caco-2 cells were treated with PPase inhibitors as previously described (32Favre B. Turowski P. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13856-13863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Cell monolayers were incubated with 100 nm fostriecin, 4 nm okadaic acid, and 0.5 nm calyculin A for 24 h before the experiment. The cells were then washed with DMEM, and the inhibitors were added again during the calcium switch experiments to maintain the inhibitory effect. Transfection of Antisense Oligos and siRNA—Caco-2 cells (125,000 cells/well) were seeded in six-well plates. The cells were then allowed to grow and attach for 24 h. After the incubation, the cells were treated with serum-free, antibiotic-free DMEM, and the incubation was continued for an additional 24 h. The cells were then transfected using 1 ml of antibiotic- and serum-free DMEM with or without 80 pmol of the antisense oligonucleotides or siRNA and 3.15 μl of Oligofectamine® reagent in each well and incubated for 6 h at 37 °C. Serum was then added to the medium to make a final concentration of 10% serum and incubated at 37 °C. After 24 h the cell monolayers were trypsinized and seeded on to Transwell inserts, and the TER was monitored every day. Calcium switch experiments were performed on day 4. For controls, cells were transfected with missense oligos or control RNA with scrambled nucleotide sequence at similar dose and transfection conditions. Measurement of TER—TER was measured as described previously (15Rao R.K. Baker R.D. Baker S.S. Gupta A. Holycross M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G812-G823PubMed Google Scholar) using a Millicell-ERS Electrical Resistance System (Millipore, Bedford, MA). TER was calculated as ohms·cm2 by multiplying it with the surface area of the monolayer. The resistance of the polycarbonate membrane in Transwells (∼30 ohms·cm2) was subtracted from all readings. Unidirectional Flux of Inulin—Transwells with the cell monolayers were incubated under different experimental conditions in the presence of fluorescein isothiocyanate-inulin (0.5 mg/ml) in the basal well. At varying times during the assembly of TJ, 100 μl each of apical and basal media were withdrawn, and fluorescence was measured using a fluorescence plate reader (BioTEK Instruments, Winooski, VT). The flux into the apical well was calculated as the percentage of total fluorescence administered into the basal well/h/cm2 of surface area. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—At varying times during the calcium switch, cell monolayers (12 mm) were washed with PBS and fixed in acetone:methanol (1:1) at 0 °C for 5 min. Cell monolayers were blocked in 3% nonfat milk in TBST (20 mm Tris, pH 7.2, and 150 mm NaCl) and incubated for 1 h with primary antibodies; rabbit polyclonal anti-ZO-1, anti-PP2A-Cα, or mouse monoclonal anti-occludin antibodies followed by incubation for 1 h with secondary antibodies; goat AlexaFluor 488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibodies. The fluorescence was visualized using a Zeiss LSM 5 laser scanning confocal microscope, and the images from Z-series sections (1 μm) were collected by using Zeiss LSM 5 Pascal, the confocal microscopy software (Release 3.2). Images were stacked using the software, Image J (NIH), and processed by Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, CA). Preparation of Detergent-insoluble Fractions—Triton-insoluble fractions were prepared as previously described (33Basuroy S. Seth A. Elias B. Naren A.P. Rao R.K. Biochem. J. 2006; 393: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Cell monolayers in Transwells (24 mm) were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and incubated for 5 min with lysis buffer-CS (50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1.0% Triton X-100, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml bestatin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin-A, 1 mm vanadate, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cell lysates were centrifuged at low speed (15,600 × g) for 4 min at 4 °C to sediment the high density actin-rich fraction. The pellet was suspended in 200 μl of lysis buffer-CS. Protein concentration in different fractions was measured by the BCA method (Pierce). Triton-insoluble and Triton-soluble fractions were mixed with an equal volume of Laemmli sample buffer (2× concentrated) and heated at 100 °C for 10 min. Immunoprecipitation—At varying times during the assembly of TJ, Caco-2 cell monolayers (24 mm Transwells) were washed with ice-cold 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and actin-rich Triton-insoluble and Triton-soluble fractions were prepared. The suspension of Triton-insoluble fraction was sonicated for 10 s in lysis buffer-N (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, containing 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, and a mixture of protease inhibitors). Sonication induced fragmentation of the F-actin filaments and released actin-bound protein complexes. Under such conditions greater than 80% of occludin and ZO-1 were recovered in the supernatant fraction; however, co-immunoprecipitation studies indicated that the interaction between occludin and ZO-1 was unaffected. The actin lysate and Triton-soluble fraction (1.0 mg protein/ml) were incubated with 2 μg of anti-occludin antibodies at 4 °C for 16 h. The immune complexes were isolated by precipitation using protein-A/G-Sepharose (for 1 h at 4 °C). For immunoprecipitation of p-Thr and p-Ser, Triton-insoluble and -soluble fractions were heated in the presence of 0.3% SDS for 10 min at 100 °C followed by centrifugation. The clear supernatant was then used for immunoprecipitation. Immunoblot Analysis—Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel (7 or 4-12% gradient) electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were blotted for occludin, ZO-1, p-Thr, p-Ser, PP2A-Cα, PKCζ, or PP1α by using specific antibodies in combination with HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG or HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibodies. HRP-conjugated anti-GST antibody was used for immunoblot analysis of GST or GST-occludin. The blot was developed using the ECL chemiluminescence method (Amersham Biosciences). Quantitation was performed by densitometric analysis of specific bands on the immunoblots by using the software Image J. PP2A Assay—Detergent-soluble or insoluble fractions or an immunocomplex was diluted in PPase buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 60 mm NaCl, 60 mm KCl, and protease inhibitors) to a final volume of 20 μl and incubated with 5 μl of phosphopeptide substrate, KRpTIRR (5 μg). After incubation at 30 °C for 10 min, free phosphate was assayed by adding 100 μl of Malachite green reagent to each sample in a 96-well microtiter plate. After 10 min of incubation at 30 °C, absorbance was measured at a 650-nm wavelength in a microplate reader (SpectraMax 190, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Zero-minute incubation was used for the control assay. Assay was also performed in the presence of 100 nm fostriecin. To determine PP2A-specific activity, the phosphatase activity measured in the presence of 100 nm fostriecin was subtracted from the corresponding total activity. The units of PP2A activity represent pmol of free phosphate generated in 1 h under assay conditions. Preparation of GST-occludin-C—C-terminal tail of chicken occludin was prepared as a GST fusion protein (GST-occludin-C) in Escherichia coli BL21DE (3Lee D.B.N. Huang E. Ward H.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 290: F20-F34Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) cells and purified using GSH-agarose as described before (23Kale G. Rao R.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 302: 324-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). cDNA for the C-terminal tail of occludin (amino acids 354-503) in pGEX vector was received as a gift from Dr. J. M. Anderson, University of North Carolina (Chapel Hill, NC). GST Pulldown Assay—To prepare protein extracts, Caco-2 cell monolayers at different stages of calcium switch were lysed in 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS containing 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate (3 ml/100 mm plate). Cell lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was used for the pulldown assay. Cell lysate (0.6 ml) was incubated with 10 μg of GST-occludin-C and 20 μl of GSH-agarose at 4 °C for 15 h on an inverter. Agarose beads were washed 3 times with PBS, and proteins were extracted by heating at 100 °C for 10 min in 20 μl of Laemmli sample buffer. The amounts of PP2A, PP1, and PKCζ present in GSH-agarose pulldown were determined by immunoblot analysis. At the end of the experiment the blots were stained with Ponceau S and immunoblotted for GST to confirm the use of equal amounts of GST-occludin-C in different samples. Pairwise Binding Assay—To determine the direct interaction between occludin and PP2A-Cα or PP1α, GST-occludin-C (5-20 μg) was incubated with purified PP2A-Cα (0.1 or 0.25 μg) or purified PP1α (0.1 or 0.25 μg) in PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100, 1 mm vanadate, and 10 mm sodium fluoride for 3 h at 30 °C on an inverter. GST-occludin-C was pulled down by binding to 20 μl of 50% GSH-agarose slurry at 30 °C for 1 h. The amounts of PP2A-Cα and PP1α bound to GSH-agarose pull-down were determined by immunoblot analysis. Nonspecific binding was determined by carrying out the binding with GST instead of GST-occludin-C. Dephosphorylation of Occludin by PP2A and PP1—Occludin was immunoprecipitated from the Triton-soluble fraction of Caco-2 cells. Occludin immunocomplexes were then incubated with 0.5 μg PP2A or PP1 in PPase buffer for 60 min. For control assay, PPase formulation buffer was used in place of PP2A and PP1. After incubation for 10-60 min at 30 °C, the reaction mixture was heated with Laemmli sample buffer and immunoblotted for p-Thr, p-Ser, and occludin. Statistics—Comparison between two groups was made by Student's t tests for grouped data. Significance in all tests was set at 95% or greater confidence level. Inhibition of Protein Phosphatase Activity Accelerates the Calcium Switch-induced Assembly of TJ—The effect of endogenous PP2A and PP1 activities on the assembly of TJ was evaluated in Caco-2 cells. Assembly of TJ was monitored by the calcium switch method. PP2A activity in Caco-2 cells was selectively inhibited by pretreatment of cells with low concentrations of okadaic acid, fostriecin, or calyculin-A as reported before (32Favre B. Turowski P. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13856-13863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Incubation with okadaic acid dose-dependently reduced PP2A activity in both detergent-insoluble and detergent-soluble fractions of Caco-2 cells (Fig. 1A). PP2A activity measured by immunocomplex PP2A assay also demonstrated a reduction in the PP2A activity in okadaic acid-treated cells (Fig. 1B). Similarly, incubation with fostriecin and calyculin-A also reduced PP2A activity (data not shown). Basal TER of cell monolayers treated with PPase inhibitors was not significantly different from the TER values for control (Fig. 1C). Calcium depletion by EGTA rapidly reduced the TER, and replenishment of calcium in the EGTA-treated cell monolayers gradually restored the TER to the basal level (Fig. 1D). Increased TER by calcium replenishment was accompanied by reduced permeability to inulin. Pretreatment of cells with okadaic acid, fostriecin, and calyculin-A significantly accelerated the restoration of TER during the reassembly of TJ by calcium replacement (Fig. 1D). The inulin permeability measured during the restoration of TER was significantly lower in inhibitor-treated cells compared with that in untreated cells (Fig. 1E). Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy showed that EGTA treatment resulted in the disruption of junctional organization of occludin and ZO-1 and redistribution of these proteins in the intracellular compartments (Fig. 2A). Three hours after calcium replacement a partial reorganization of occludin and ZO-1 at the intercellular junctions was achieved. However, in cells pretreated with fostriecin, both occludin and ZO-1 relocalization to the intercellular junctions was almost complete by 3 h. Densitometric analysis indicated that intracellular fluorescence of occludin (Fig. 2B) and ZO-1 (Fig. 2C) increased during EGTA treatment, whereas the junctional fluorescence was significantly reduced. During the reassembly, this process appeared to be reversed. However, the decrease in intracellular and increase in junctional fluorescence of both occludin and ZO-1 during the reassembly was significantly greater in fostriecin-treated cells compared with that in untreated cells. The z-sections of these images (Fig. 2D) confirm the accelerated reassembly of occludin and ZO-1 in cells pretreated with fostriecin. Confocal microscopy also indicates that occludin and ZO-1 are localized predominantly in vesicular structures in EGTA-treated cell monolayers. Reduced Expression of PP2A by Antisense Oligonucleotides or siRNA Accelerates the Assembly of TJ—To confirm the role of endogenous PP2A in the regulation of the assembly of TJ, we designed three different antisense oligonucleotides against the nucleotide sequence of human PP2A-Cα. Antisense oligonucleotides, AS-PP2A-2, AS-PP2A-3, or a combination of AS-PP2A-2 and AS-PP2A-3 were transfected into Caco-2 cells. Cy3-conjugated AS-PP2A-3 showed that Oligofectamine® effectively introduced the antisense oligonucleotides into the cell (Fig. 3A). Transfection with AS-PP2A-2, AS-PP2A-3, or AS-PP2A-2+AS-PP2A-3 resulted in a marked decrease in the levels of PP2A-Cα"
https://openalex.org/W2031226474,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurode-generative disease characterized by motor neuron death. A hallmark of the disease is the appearance of protein aggregates in the affected motor neurons. We have found that p62, a protein implicated in protein aggregate formation, accumulated progressively in the G93A mouse spinal cord. The accumulation of p62 was in parallel to the increase of polyubiquitinated proteins and mutant SOD1 aggregates. Immunostaining studies showed that p62, ubiquitin, and mutant SOD1 co-localized in the protein aggregates in affected cells in G93A mouse spinal cord. The p62 protein selectively interacted with familial ALS mutants, but not WT SOD1. When p62 was co-expressed with SOD1 in NSC34 cells, it greatly enhanced the formation of aggregates of the ALS-linked SOD1 mutants, but not wild-type SOD1. Cell viability was measured in the presence and absence of overexpressed p62, and the results suggest that the large aggregates facilitated by p62 were not directly toxic to cells under the conditions in this study. Deletion of the ubiquitin-association (UBA) domain of p62 significantly decreased the p62-facilitated aggregate formation, but did not completely inhibit it. Further protein interaction experiments also showed that the truncated p62 with the UBA domain deletion remained capable of interacting with mutant SOD1. The findings of this study show that p62 plays a critical role in forming protein aggregates in familial ALS, likely by linking misfolded mutant SOD1 molecules and other cellular proteins together.

In ∼20% of familial cases, a mutant allele of the copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1) enzyme has been identified (3Deng H.X. Hentati A. Tainer J.A. Iqbal Z. Cayabyab A. Hung W.Y. Getzoff E.D.

As of today, over 100 different mutations of SOD1 causing ALS have been reported, the majority of which are point mutations and act in a dominant fashion. Several ALS risk factors have been identified, but the etiology of the disease is largely unclear. A hallmark of the disease is the appearance of intracellular inclusions in degenerating motor neurons (6Piao Y.S. Wakabayashi K. Kakita A. Yamada M. Hayashi S. Morita T. Ikuta F. Oyanagi K.

However, it is unclear how the SOD1 mutants form aggregates and whether other proteins play any role in the aggregation process or the aggregate-induced toxicity. p62 (also called sequestosome 1) was first identified as a phosphotyrosine-independent ligand for the Lck SH2 domain (14Joung I. Strominger J.L. Shin J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5991-5995Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). It was later found to be a polyubiquitin-binding protein (15Vadlamudi R.K.

The p62 protein has been proposed to act as a shuttling factor of polyubiquitinated proteins to the proteasome (16Seibenhener M.L. Babu J.R. Geetha T. Wong H.C. Krishna N.R. Wooten M.W. Mol. Cell.

However, the role of p62 in mutant SOD1-mediated fALS is currently undocumented. In addition, the mechanistic details of p62 aggregate formation or the time frame of the accumulation of p62 in relation to ALS progression are barely known. In the present work, we investigated the p62 protein levels in the G93A SOD1 transgenic mouse model of fALS (30Gurney M.E. Pu H. Chiu A.Y. Dal Canto M.C. Polchow C.Y. Alexander D.D. Caliendo J. Hentati A. Kwon Y.W. Deng H.X. Chen W.J. Zhai P. Sufit R.L. Siddique T. Science. 1994; 264: 1772-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (3494) Google Scholar) and studied the role of p62 in fALS mutant SOD1 aggregate formation in NSC34 cells (a mouse motor neuron-like cell line) (31Cashman N.R. Durham H.D. Blusztajn J.K. Oda K. Tabira T. Shaw I.T. Dahrouge S. Antel J.P. Dev. Dyn. 1992; 194: 209-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar, 32Fukada K. Zhang F. Vien A. Cashman N.R. Zhu H. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2004; 3: 1211-1223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). We found that the p62 level was elevated in the spinal cord of early pre-symptomatic G93A SOD1 transgenic mice and then progressively accumulated during the life of the animals. In addition, p62 was found in the protein aggregates in the G93A mice. In contrast, the level of p62 was generally lower and p62-positive aggregates were extremely rare in mice overexpressing wild-type (WT) SOD1. The p62 protein selectively interacted with familial ALS mutants, but not WT SOD1, suggesting a direct role for p62 in the discrimination between wild-type and mutant SOD1. Co-transfection of DsRed-tagged p62 with GFP-tagged SOD1 showed that aggregate formation of the fALS-linked SOD1 mutants A4V and G93A was significantly enhanced by p62 overexpression, whereas WT SOD1 did not form aggregates. Deletion of the ubiquitin-association (UBA) domain of p62 decreased its ability of enhancing mutant SOD1 aggregation, but did not completely inhibit it. Further protein interaction data showed that the truncated p62 without the UBA domain could interact with mutant SOD1 as the full-length p62, suggesting that the UBA domain is not essential to the interaction. Based on the above data, p62 plays an important, yet undocumented role in the formation of protein aggregates in familial ALS. Animals—Transgenic mice strains overexpressing WT and G93A mutant SOD1 were generously provided by Dr. Zuoshang Xu (University of Massachusetts Medical School). The mice were generated from B6.Cg-Tg(SOD1)2Gur/J and B6.Cg-Tg(SOD1-G93A)1Gur/J stains (30Gurney M.E. Pu H. Chiu A.Y. Dal Canto M.C. Polchow C.Y. Alexander D.D. Caliendo J. Hentati A. Kwon Y.W. Deng H.X. Chen W.J. Zhai P. Sufit R.L. Siddique T. Science. 1994; 264: 1772-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (3494) Google Scholar) and bred and maintained as hemizygotes at the University of Kentucky animal facility. Transgenic mice were identified using PCR according to Gurney (33Gurney M.E. N. Engl. J. Med. 1994; 331: 1721-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). G93A SOD1 transgenic mice were sacrificed at ages 35, 60, 90, and 125 ± 5 days. Age-matched WT SOD1 transgenic mice were used as controls. Mice were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of 0.1 ml pentobarbital (50 mg/ml, Abbott Laboratories) and transcardically perfused with 0.1 m phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.5, before spinal cords and other tissues were dissected. All animal procedures were approved by the university IACUC committee. Plasmid Construction—The construction of GFP-tagged SOD1 (SOD1-GFP) plasmids was previously reported (34Zhang F. Zhu H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1760: 404-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The C-terminally 3xHA-tagging vector p3xHA-CMV14 was derived from the p3xFLAG-CMV14 vector (Sigma) by replacing the 3xFLAG tag with the 3xHA tag GSAYPYDVPDYAGSYPYDVPDYAGSYPYDVPDYA-stop-stop between the BamHI and XmaI sites, leaving the multiple cloning site of the parental vector unaltered. The 3xHA-tagged SOD1 plasmids were constructed by subcloning SOD1 encoding sequences to the EcoRI and BamHI sites of p3xHA-CMV14. The Mus musculus p62 cDNA clone (MGC:5968, IMAGE: 3487289, GI:13543729) was obtained from ATCC. The DsRed-p62 fusion construct was made by PCR amplifying the p62 coding sequence that was subsequently inserted into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of the pDsRed-monomer C1 vector (Clontech). The p62 lacking the UBA domain (p62-UBAΔ lacking Glu353-Leu404) was also tagged with DsRed in a similar fashion (DsRed-p62-UBAΔ). A GST-tagging vector for mammalian cells was made by replacing the 3XFLAG tag of p3XFLAG-CMV10 (Sigma) with the GST sequence of pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences). The p62 and p62-UBAΔ fragments were subcloned from the respective DSRed-tagged constructs into the GST-tagging vector. The sequence fidelity of all constructs was verified by sequencing. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Cell Viability—NSC34 cells were cultured at 37 °C under 5% CO2, 95% air in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (31Cashman N.R.

Cells were treated, harvested, and lysed as described in individual experiments. NSC34 cells were transfected with SOD1-GFP constructs and untagged p62 or its vector control in 6-well plates. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were stained with 6.25 μg/ml propidium iodide for 10 min. Cells with SOD1-GFP aggregates and dead cells were counted using a Zeiss Axiovert 100 epifluorescent microscope in ten random viewfields. Three independent experiments were carried out, and the p values were calculated using the Student's t test. Immunoprecipitation and GST Pull-down Assays—Dissected mouse spinal cords were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (P8340, Sigma, 1:1,000 dilution), 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.625 mg/ml N-ethylmaleimide (E3876, Sigma). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the protein concentration determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). 1000 μg of each extract was precleared for 1 h at 4 °C with 50 μl of 50% protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) in a total volume of 500 μl of RIPA buffer. Extracts were then incubated with 2 μg of ubiquitin monoclonal antibody (sc-8017, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4 °C, followed by incubation with 50 μl of 50% protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h. Protein G beads were collected by centrifugation for 5 min at 500 × g and washed three times with ice-cold RIPA buffer. Proteins were eluted by boiling in 2× SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting analysis. NSC34 cells were co-transfected with 0.5 μg of p62 construct and 0.5 μg of 3xHA-SOD1 construct. 28 h post-transfection, the medium were changed to fresh medium containing 20 μm MG-132 (Calbiochem) or vehicle control (Me2SO). Cells were cultured for additional 20 h, harvested, and lysed in 1× RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitor mixture (P8340, Sigma, 1:1,000 dilution), 10 μm MG-132 and 0.625 mg/ml N-ethylmaleimide. After incubation on ice for 20 min, the lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and the protein concentrations were determined using Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). The immunoprecipitation was carried out as described above using anti-HA antibodies (sc-7392 mouse monoclonal or sc-805 rabbit polyclonal, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Proteins were eluted by boiling in 2× SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting analysis. The GST pull-down experiments were carried out similarly as above using glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) and the manufacturer's protocol. Western Blotting Analysis—After SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes in 25 mm Tris-HCl, 192 mm glycine, 20% (v/v) methanol. Membranes were blocked in 5% milk in TBS with 0.1% Tween-20 (TBST) at room temperature followed by incubation with the indicated primary antibodies in TBST. Anti-SOD1 (sc-11407, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-p62 (goat polyclonal, sc-10117, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-HA (sc-7392 and sc-805, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-GST (sc-459, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used at 1:1,000 dilution. Anti-p62 (mouse monoclonal, 610832, BD Bioscience), antiubiquitin (sc-8017, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-DsRed (632496, Clontech), anti-GFP (sc-8334, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used at 1:500 dilution. After primary antibody incubation, membranes were washed with TBST and incubated with the indicated secondary antibodies in 5% milk in TBST at room temperature. Membranes were then washed with TBST before the protein of interest was visualized using Supersignal West Pico or Dura Enhanced Chemiluminescent (ECL) substrate (Pierce). Fluorescence Microscopy—Immunohistological analyses were performed on spinal cords of G93A and WT SOD1 transgenic mice at ages 35, 60, 90, and 125 ± 5 days. Spinal cords were dissected out, post-fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m PBS, dehydrated, and embedded in Paraplast X-tra (Tyco Healthcare). Sections (6 μm) were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and boiled in 0.01 m citrate buffer (pH 6.0) in a microwave oven at a high power setting for 15 min to retrieve antigens. Sections were then blocked in 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) in 0.1 m PBS with 0.1% Triton-X100 (PBST) for 30 min and incubated with primary antibodies diluted in 2% FBS-PBST overnight at room temperature. The rabbit SOD1 antibody (sc-11407, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), the mouse ubiquitin antibody (sc-8017, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and the goat p62 antibody (sc-10117, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used at 1:400, 1:300, and 1:200, respectively. Following primary antibody incubation sections were washed with PBST and incubated with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochoride (DAPI) (Sigma) at 1:7,500 and an appropriate secondary antibody in 10% FBS-PBST for 1 h at room temperature. For double and triple stainings sections were washed three times with PBST between incubations with the different secondary antibodies. The following secondary antibodies from Molecular Probes were used; Alexa fluor 488 anti-goat, Alexa fluor 594 anti-rabbit, Alexa fluor 488 anti-mouse, and Alexa fluor 680 anti-mouse. After secondary antibody incubations slides were washed with PBST and mounted using Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories). Fluorescence microscopy was carried out using a Leica DM IRBE laser scanning confocal microscope. The images were visualized using a ×100 objective. NSC34 cells were cultured on sterile coverslips and transfected with SOD1-GFP and DsRed-p62 constructs. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were fixed using 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS at room temperature. After washing with PBS, the coverslips were mounted on slides with Vectashield mounting media (Vector Laboratories) containing DAPI (Molecular Probes) to visualize the cell nuclei. Fluorescence microscopy was carried out using a Leica DM IRBE laser scanning confocal microscope with a ×100 objective. NSC34 cells were transfected with SOD1-GFP and DsRed-p62 constructs in 6-well plates. 24 h after transfection, the cells were inspected for GFP and DsRed fluorescence using a Zeiss Axiovert 100 epifluorescent microscope. There was no detectable cross-talk between the different fluorophores. The number of transfected cells and cells with DsRed-positive, GFP-positive, and double-positive aggregates were counted in ten randomly chosen view fields. Statistical analysis was carried out using Student's t test to calculate p values. Accumulation of p62 and Polyubiquitinated Proteins in G93A SOD1 Transgenic Mice—We followed the accumulation of p62 and polyubiquitinated proteins in the G93A SOD1 transgenic mice and the control WT SOD1 transgenic mice. G93A transgenic mice were sacrificed at the presymptomatic 35 and 60 days of age, at 90 days when the disease onset is expected, and at 125 days when the mice reach the end stage of the disease. Age-matched WT SOD1 transgenic mice were also sacrificed. Protein extracts were prepared from the spinal cord and sciatic nerve of the G93A and WT mice. The Western blotting experiments were performed using a mouse monoclonal p62 antibody (610832, BD Bioscience), and the results are shown in Fig. 1. The level of p62 was detectably higher in the G93A spinal cords as early as 35 days of age and clearly showed continued elevation during later stages in Western blotting experiments (Fig. 1A). In comparison, the level of p62 in WT mouse spinal cord was much lower at all time points. In addition, compared with WT, elevated levels of p62 were also observed in G93A transgenic mice sciatic nerves containing motor neuron axons (Fig. 1B). This elevation was detectable at 90 days and even greater at 125 days. The accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins closely paralleled that of p62. At each age, a greater amount of high molecular weight ubiquitin-positive signal was detected in the G93A mouse spinal cord compared with WT (Fig. 1A). In addition, the amount of polyubiquitinated proteins increased more rapidly in G93A mice than in WT mice as the animals aged. A similar pattern of accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins was observed in the sciatic nerves of G93A mice as well (Fig. 1B). Polyubiquitinated proteins were immunoprecipitated from WT and G93A mouse spinal cord extracts using an ubiquitin antibody and immunoblotted for p62 using a goat polyclonal antibody (sc-10117, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) (Fig. 1C). All samples contained detectable amounts of p62, even in the case of the WT samples, probably because of the fact that p62 was enriched by the ubiquitin immunoprecipitation. The levels of p62 co-precipitated by the polyubiquitinated proteins were always higher in the G93A mouse spinal cords than in the age-matched WT mouse spinal cords. The elevation became more significant in the 90 and the 125 days samples. The same results were obtained using the mouse monoclonal antibody that was used in Fig. 1, A and B. Control experiments were carried out using IgG in immunoprecipitation, and p62 was not detected in the controls. The accumulation of p62 in G93A mice was also demonstrated using immunofluorescence staining studies, and the results are shown in Fig. 2. p62 was hardly detectable in the WT mouse at various ages except for a minute amount in a small subset of cells in 125-day-old animals. In contrast, p62-positive staining emerged in the motor neurons of 35-day-old G93A mouse spinal cord and increased with age. Moreover, the p62 staining closely resembled protein aggregates in the motor neurons of G93A mice and was observed long prior to the disease onset. Co-localization of p62, SOD1, and Ubiquitin in Protein Aggregates in Spinal Cord Motor Neurons of the G93A SOD1 Transgenic Mice—The fALS-linked SOD1 mutant G93A was co-localized with p62 in the protein aggregates in the spinal cord motor neurons of G93A SOD1 transgenic mice as demonstrated by co-immunostaining studies (Fig. 3A). Images from WT SOD1 mice are not shown because p62 staining was barely observed (see Fig. 2). Co-immunostaining images of SOD1 and ubiquitin are shown in Fig. 3B. In WT SOD1 mice, ubiquitin staining was strong in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus. In the G93A SOD1 mice, loss of nuclear ubiquitin signal accompanied by an increase in cytoplasmic ubiquitin staining was observed as early as 35 days of age (data not shown) but was more profound at 60 days (Fig. 3B). At 60 days of age, ubiquitin-positive aggregates appeared in the neurites and generally in the white matter of the G93A spinal cord samples. By 90 days, the ubiquitin-positive aggregates appeared in the cell bodies as well, along with the progression of the accumulation of the ubiquitin aggregates in the white matter. At 125 days, multiple ubiquitin aggregates were seen in the white matter and in the few remaining motor neurons. It is noted that the accumulation of p62 (Fig. 2), the co-aggregates of p62 and SOD1 (Fig. 3A), and the co-aggregates of SOD1 and ubiquitin (Fig. 3B) emerged in concert during the disease onset and progression. Moreover, Fig. 3C is the triple staining of SOD1, p62, and ubiquitin, demonstrating the co-localization of the three proteins in aggregates. Co-precipitation of fALS-linked SOD1 Mutants and p62 from NSC34 Cells—To test whether p62 specifically interacted with mutant SOD1, we co-transfected DsRed-p62 and HA-tagged WT, A4V, or G93A mutant SOD1 into NSC34 cells. The HA tag was selected to be fused at the C terminus of SOD1 because it lacks lysine residues, thus avoiding potential fortuitous ubiquitination sites. A set of transfected cells was treated with MG-132 (a proteasome inhibitor), whereas another set was treated with Me2SO vehicle control only. Cell extracts were prepared and subjected to immunoprecipitation using an anti-HA antibody. The immunoprecipitated samples were blotted with anti-DsRed to determine the presence of p62, and the results are shown in Fig. 4. Without MG-132, p62 was co-precipitated with the fALS-linked SOD1 mutants A4V and G93A, but not with WT SOD1. Treatment of the transfected cells with MG-132 greatly enhanced the co-precipitation of p62 with the fALS SOD1 mutants, but p62 was hardly detectable in the WT SOD1 immunoprecipitation sample. In contrast, Western blotting of cell l"
https://openalex.org/W2038623184,"Tumor suppressor Pdcd4 has recently been shown to inhibit invasion by activating activator protein-1 (AP-1); however, little is known of the functionally significant Pdcd4-target genes. The urokinase receptor (u-PAR) promotes invasion/metastasis, and is associated with poor cancer-patient survival. The present study was conducted (1) to investigate a role for Pdcd4 in intravasation, invasion and u-PAR regulation, and (2) to describe mechanisms by which this is achieved. Fourteen cell lines showed reciprocal expression of u-PAR/Pdcd4. Resected tumor/normal tissues of 29 colorectal cancer patients demonstrated a significant inverse correlation between Pdcd4/u-PAR. siRNA-Pdcd4-transfected GEO cells significantly increased endogenous u-PAR mRNA/protein. A u-PAR-promoter-chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT)-reporter was reduced in activity with increasing Pdcd4 expression in RKO. Deletion of a putative Sp-1-binding site (−402/−350) inhibited u-PAR promoter regulation by Pdcd4, this being paralleled by a reduction of Sp1 binding to this region in pdcd4-transfected cells. Pdcd4-transfected cells showed an increase in Sp3 binding to u-PAR promoter region −152/−135, the deletion of which reduces the ability of Pdcd4 to suppress u-PAR promoter activity. Surprisingly, the u-PAR-AP-1 site was not targeted by Pdcd4. Finally, RKO cells overexpressing Pdcd4 showed an inhibition of invasion/intravasation (chicken embryo metastasis assay). These data suggest Pdcd4 as a new negative regulator of intravasation, and qas the invasion-related gene u-PAR. It is the first study to implicate Pdcd4 regulation of gene expression via Sp1/Sp3."
https://openalex.org/W2061264646,"Intestinal injury or chronic inflammation induce cytokines that promote crypt regeneration and mucosal repair. If excessive or prolonged, such mechanisms may increase colon cancer risk. Factors that terminate or limit cytokine action in intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) may protect against crypt hyperplasia and neoplasia. We hypothesized that suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS3) is such a factor. Mice with Vilin-promoter/Cre-recombinase (VC)-mediated IEC-specific SOCS3 gene disruption (VC/HO), WT/HO littermates with floxed but intact SOCS3 genes and VC/WT mice were studied. Colon was examined after acute dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced mucosal injury or after azoxymethane (AOM) and chronic DSS. Signaling pathways were examined in colon, cultured IEC or colon cancer cell lines. VC/HO mice showed no basal phenotype. After acute DSS, VC/HO exhibited enhanced crypt proliferation and crypt hyperplasia and reduced transforming growth factor (TGF) beta expression in colon. Inflammation and mucosal damage were similar across genotypes. Following AOM/DSS, VC/HO mice had increased size, number and load of colonic tumors and increased STAT3 and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) activation in colon. In vitro, SOCS3 overexpression reduced proliferation, IL-6-mediated STAT3 activation and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha-mediated NF-kappaB activation. We conclude that cytokine induction of SOCS3 normally provides an intrinsic mechanism to limit injury-induced crypt hyperproliferation and inflammation-associated colon cancer by regulating both STAT3 and NF-kappaB pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2001994340,"The Hedgehog pathway transcription factor Gli1 induces transformation of epithelial cells via induction of Snail, a repressor of E-cadherin (E-cad). E-cad is normally complexed with beta-catenin at the cell membrane. Loss of E-cad during developmental epithelial-mesenchymal transitions can switch beta-catenin from its role at adherens junctions to its role in nuclear transcription. During tumorigenesis it is unclear which pathways trigger this switch. In the current study, gain- and loss-of-function approaches identified E-cad as a selective inhibitor of transformation by Gli1, and Snail knockdown was rescued by downregulation of E-cad. Gli1 induced relocalization of beta-catenin from the cell membrane to the nucleus. The ability of wild-type or mutant alleles of E-cad to modulate transformation by Gli1 correlated with their ability to regulate localization of beta-catenin. Inhibition of Wnt-beta-catenin signaling by dominant negative Tcf4 selectively blocked in vitro transformation by Gli1. In Gli1-transgenic mice, infiltrating skin tumor cells expressed active, unphosphorylated beta-catenin. Our studies identify E-cad as a selective suppressor of transformation by Gli1 and point to the Sonic Hedgehog-Gli1 pathway as a key regulator of the beta-catenin switch in epithelial cells and cancers."

https://openalex.org/W1975542710,"The mechanisms underlying cellular drug resistance have been extensively studied, but little is known about its regulation. We have previously reported that activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) is upregulated in cisplatin-resistant cells and plays a role in cisplatin resistance. Here, we find out a novel relationship between the circadian transcription factor Clock and drug resistance. Clock drives the periodical expression of many genes that regulate hormone release, cell division, sleep-awake cycle and tumor growth. We demonstrate that ATF4 is a direct target of Clock, and that Clock is overexpressed in cisplatin-resistant cells. Furthermore, Clock expression significantly correlates with cisplatin sensitivity, and that the downregulation of either Clock or ATF4 confers sensitivity of A549 cells to cisplatin and etoposide. Notably, ATF4-overexpressing cells show multidrug resistance and marked elevation of intracellular glutathione. The microarray study reveals that genes for glutathione metabolism are generally downregulated by the knockdown of ATF4 expression. These results suggest that the Clock and ATF4 transcription system might play an important role in multidrug resistance through glutathione-dependent redox system, and also indicate that physiological potentials of Clock-controlled redox system might be important to better understand the oxidative stress-associated disorders including cancer and systemic chronotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2018132516,"Telomerase-negative cancer cells can maintain their telomeres by a recombination-mediated alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) process. We reported previously that sequestration of MRE11/RAD50/NBS1 complexes represses ALT-mediated telomere length maintenance, and suppresses formation of ALT-associated promyelocytic leukemia (PML) bodies (APBs). APBs are PML bodies containing telomeric DNA and telomere-binding proteins, and are observed only in a small fraction of cells within asynchronously dividing ALT-positive cell populations. Here, we report that methionine restriction caused a reversible arrest in G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle and reversible induction of APB formation in most cells within an ALT-positive population. We combined methionine restriction with RNA interference to test whether the following proteins are required for APB formation: PML body-associated proteins, PML and Sp100; telomere-associated proteins, TRF1, TRF2, TIN2 and RAP1; and DNA repair proteins, MRE11, RAD50, NBS1 and 53BP1. APB formation was not decreased by depletion of Sp100 (as reported previously) or of 53BP1, although 53BP1 partially colocalizes with APBs. Depletion of the other proteins suppressed APB formation. Because of the close linkage between ALT-mediated telomere maintenance and ability to form APBs, the eight proteins identified by this screen as being required for APB formation are also likely to be required for the ALT mechanism."

https://openalex.org/W2046131175,"The zinc-finger protein A20/TNFAIP3, an inhibitor of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation, has been shown to protect MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells from TNFα-induced apoptosis. As estrogen receptor (ER) status is an important parameter in the development and progression of breast cancer, we analysed the effect of 17β-estradiol (E2) treatment on the expression of A20. We found that A20 is a new E2-regulated gene, whose expression correlates with ER expression in both cell lines and tumor samples. With the aim of investigating the impact of A20 expression on MCF-7 cells in response to ER ligands, we established stably transfected-MCF-7 cells overexpressing A20 (MCF-7-A20). These cells exhibited a phenotype of resistance to the 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen cytostatic and pro-apoptotic actions and of hyper-response to E2. Dysregulations in bax, bcl2, bak, phospho-bad, cyclin D1, cyclin E2, cyclin D2 and cyclin A2 proteins expression were shown to be related to the resistant phenotype developed by the MCF-7-A20 cells. Interestingly, we found that A20 was also overexpressed in MVLN and VP tamoxifen-resistant cell lines. Furthermore, high A20 expression levels were observed in more aggressive breast tumors (ER-negative, progesterone receptor-negative and high histological grade). These overall findings strongly suggest that A20 is a key protein involved in tamoxifen resistance, and thus represents both a new breast cancer marker and a promising target for developing new strategies to prevent the emergence of acquired mechanisms of drug resistance in breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2017229935,"Following DNA damage, cells undergo G2/M cell cycle arrest, allowing time for DNA repair. G2/M checkpoint activation involves activation of Wee1 and Chk1 kinases and inhibition of Cdc25A and Cdc25C phosphatases, which results in inhibition of Cdc2 kinase. Results presented in this report indicate that γ-irradiation (IR) exposure of MCF-7 cells resulted in extracellular signal regulated protein kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) activation and induction of G2/M arrest. Furthermore, inhibition of ERK1/2 signaling resulted in ⩾85% attenuation in IR-induced G2/M arrest and concomitant diminution of IR-induced activation of ataxia telangiectasia mutated- and rad3-related (ATR), Chk1 and Wee1 kinases as well as phosphorylation of Cdc25A-Thr506, Cdc25C-Ser216 and Cdc2-Tyr15. Moreover, incubation of cells with caffeine, which inhibits ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)/ATR, or transfection of cells with short interfering RNA targeting ATR abrogated IR-induced Chk1 phosphorylation and G2/M arrest but had no effect on IR-induced ERK1/2 activation. In contrast, inhibition of ERK1/2 signaling resulted in marked attenuation in IR-induced ATR activity with little, if any, effect on IR-induced ATM activation. These results implicate IR-induced ERK1/2 activation as an important regulator of G2/M checkpoint response to IR in MCF-7 cells."
https://openalex.org/W2048460774,"Prolactin (PRL) stimulates the cytoskeletal re-organization and motility of breast cancer cells. During PRL receptor signaling, Vav2 becomes phosphorylated and activated, an event regulated by the serine/threonine kinase Nek3. Given the regulatory role of Vav2, the function of Nek3 in PRL-mediated motility and invasion was examined. Overexpression of Nek3 in Chinese hamster ovary transfectants potentiated cytoskeletal re-organization in response to PRL. In contrast, downregulation of Nek3 expression by small-interfering RNA (siRNA) attenuated PRL-mediated cytoskeletal reorganization, activation of GTPase Rac1, cell migration and invasion of T47D cells. In addition, PRL stimulation induced an interaction between Nek3 and paxillin and significantly increased paxillin serine phosphorylation, whereas Nek3 siRNA-transfected cells showed a marked reduction in paxillin phosphorylation. Analysis of breast tissue microarrays also demonstrated a significant up-regulation of Nek3 expression in malignant versus normal specimens. These data suggest that Nek3 contributes to PRL-mediated breast cancer motility through mechanisms involving Rac1 activation and paxillin phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W2043503470,"Although patients diagnosed with melanoma of ⩽1.00 mm thickness have a relatively good cure rate, the prognosis for patients with locally advanced and metastatic melanoma is grave. The discovery of new and effective therapies for this disease depends in large part on molecular studies that will resolve why advanced-stage melanoma is refractory to conventional chemotherapy and radiation therapy. To identify genes that have important functions in advanced-stage melanomas, in particular, in melanoma-infiltrated lymph nodes, which are not well characterized at the molecular level, we generated a LongSAGE library from a melanoma-positive lymph node, and subjected melanoma-infiltrated lymph nodes to protein expression profiling. The data document that the molecular signature of melanoma, which has spread to regional lymph nodes, is very similar to the molecular signature of primary melanomas. Equally important, we provide evidence that the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, Ubc9, is expressed at high levels in melanoma-positive lymph nodes, and that it plays a crucial role in preventing advanced-stage melanomas from undergoing chemotherapy-induced apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W1994045067,"Inactivation of the p53 tumor suppressor pathway is a critical step in human tumorigenesis. In addition to mutations, p53 can be functionally silenced through its increased degradation, inhibition of its transcriptional activity and/or its inappropriate subcellular localization. Using a proteomic approach, we have found that members of the Ras network of proteins, Ras-GTPase activating protein-SH3-domain-binding proteins 1 and 2 (G3BP1 and 2), bind to p53 in vitro and in vivo. Our data show that expression of G3BPs leads to the redistribution of p53 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. The G3BP2 isoform additionally associated with murine double minute 2 (MDM2), a negative regulator of p53. G3BP2 expression resulted in significant reduction in MDM2-mediated p53 ubiquitylation and degradation. Interestingly, MDM2 was also stabilized in G3BP2-expressing cells and its ability to ubiquitylate itself was compromised. Accordingly, short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated knockdown of G3BP2 caused a reduction in MDM2 protein levels. Furthermore, expression of shRNA targeting either G3BP1 or G3BP2 in human cancer cell lines resulted in marked upregulation of p53 levels and activity. Our results suggest that both G3BP isoforms may act as negative regulators of p53."
https://openalex.org/W1968601246,"Kruppel-like factor (KLF) 6 is a tumor-suppressor gene functionally inactivated by loss of heterozygosity, somatic mutation and/or alternative splicing that generates a dominant-negative splice form, KLF6-SV1. Wild-type KLF6 (wtKLF6) expression is decreased in many human malignancies, which correlates with reduced patient survival. Additionally, loss of the KLF6 locus in the absence of somatic mutation in the remaining allele occurs in a number of human cancers, raising the possibility that haploinsufficiency of the KLF6 gene alone contributes to cellular growth dysregulation and tumorigenesis. Our earlier studies identified the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 as a transcriptional target of the KLF6 gene in cultured cells, but not in vivo. To address this issue, we have generated two genetic mouse models to define the in vivo role of KLF6 in regulating cell proliferation and p21 expression. Transgenic overexpression of KLF6 in the liver resulted in a runted phenotype with decreased body and liver size, with evidence of decreased hepatocyte proliferation, increased p21 and reduced proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression. In contrast, mice with targeted deletion of one KLF6 allele (KLF6+/-) display increased liver mass with reduced p21 expression, compared to wild type littermates. Moreover, in primary hepatocellular carcinoma samples, there is a significant correlation between wtKLF6 and p21 mRNA expression. Combined, these data suggest that haploinsufficiency of the KLF6 gene may regulate cellular proliferation in vivo through decreased transcriptional activation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21."
https://openalex.org/W2042665420,"Gastric carcinoma is one of the major causes of cancer mortality worldwide. Early detection results in excellent prognosis for patients with early cancer (EGC), whereas the prognosis of advanced cancer (AGC) patients remains poor. It is not clear whether EGC and AGC are molecularly distinct, and whether they represent progressive stages of the same tumor or different entities ab initio. Gene expression profiles of EGC and AGC were determined by Affymetrix technology and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Representative regulated genes were further analysed by in situ hybridization (ISH) on tissue microarrays. Expression analysis allowed the identification of a signature that differentiates AGC from EGC. In addition, comparison with normal gastric mucosa indicated that the majority of alterations associated with EGC are retained in AGC, and that further expression changes mark the transition from EGC to AGC. Finally, ISH analysis showed that representative genes, differentially expressed in the invasive areas of EGC and AGC, are not differentially expressed in the non-invasive areas of the same tumors. Our data are more directly compatible with a progression model of gastric carcinogenesis, whereby EGC and AGC may represent different molecular stages of the same tumor. Finally, the identification of an AGC-specific signature might help devising novel therapeutic strategies for advanced gastric cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2039518376,"Various common signaling pathways maintain tissue stem cells, including Notch and Wnt/β-catenin signals. Phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling regulates the ‘stemness’ of several stem cells in culture, specifically in maintaining embryonic stem and neural stem cells, and in deriving embryonic germ cells from primordial germ cells. We examined the effect of Akt signaling in epidermal cells in transgenic mice expressing an Akt-Mer fusion protein whose kinase activity was conditionally activated by treatment with 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4OHT). The topical application of 4OHT to adult skin of the transgenic mice induced new hair growth in resting phase follicles. In addition, the mice showed hyperplasia in interfollicular epidermis (IFE) and hair follicles, which was presumably caused by the extensive proliferation of keratinocytes in basal layer of IFE and outer root sheath of hair follicles, respectively. The progenitor cell population increased consistently in 4OHT-treated transgenic mice. Our results show that PI3K/Akt signaling induces epidermal hyperplasia and proliferation of epidermal progenitors."

https://openalex.org/W2170641660,"STIM1 (stromal interacting molecule 1), an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein that controls store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE), redistributes into punctae at the cell periphery after store depletion. This redistribution is suggested to have a causal role in activation of SOCE. However, whether peripheral STIM1 punctae that are involved in regulation of SOCE are determined by depletion of peripheral or more internal ER has not yet been demonstrated. Here we show that Ca2+ depletion in subplasma membrane ER is sufficient for peripheral redistribution of STIM1 and activation of SOCE. 1 μm thapsigargin (Tg) induced substantial depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores and rapidly activated SOCE. In comparison, 1 nm Tg induced slower, about 60-70% less Ca2+ depletion but similar SOCE. SOCE was confirmed by measuring ISOC in addition to Ca2+, Mn2+, and Ba2+ entry. Importantly, 1 nm Tg caused redistribution of STIM1 only in the ER-plasma membrane junction, whereas 1 μm Tg caused a relatively global relocalization of STIM1 in the cell. During the time taken for STIM1 relocalization and SOCE activation, 1 nm Bodipy-fluorescein Tg primarily labeled the subplasma membrane region, whereas 1 μm Tg labeled the entire cell. The localization of Tg in the subplasma membrane region was associated with depletion of ER in this region and activation of SOCE. Together, these data suggest that peripheral STIM1 relocalization that is causal in regulation of SOCE is determined by the status of [Ca2+] in the ER in close proximity to the plasma membrane. Thus, the mechanism involved in regulation of SOCE is contained within the ER-plasma membrane junctional region. STIM1 (stromal interacting molecule 1), an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein that controls store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE), redistributes into punctae at the cell periphery after store depletion. This redistribution is suggested to have a causal role in activation of SOCE. However, whether peripheral STIM1 punctae that are involved in regulation of SOCE are determined by depletion of peripheral or more internal ER has not yet been demonstrated. Here we show that Ca2+ depletion in subplasma membrane ER is sufficient for peripheral redistribution of STIM1 and activation of SOCE. 1 μm thapsigargin (Tg) induced substantial depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores and rapidly activated SOCE. In comparison, 1 nm Tg induced slower, about 60-70% less Ca2+ depletion but similar SOCE. SOCE was confirmed by measuring ISOC in addition to Ca2+, Mn2+, and Ba2+ entry. Importantly, 1 nm Tg caused redistribution of STIM1 only in the ER-plasma membrane junction, whereas 1 μm Tg caused a relatively global relocalization of STIM1 in the cell. During the time taken for STIM1 relocalization and SOCE activation, 1 nm Bodipy-fluorescein Tg primarily labeled the subplasma membrane region, whereas 1 μm Tg labeled the entire cell. The localization of Tg in the subplasma membrane region was associated with depletion of ER in this region and activation of SOCE. Together, these data suggest that peripheral STIM1 relocalization that is causal in regulation of SOCE is determined by the status of [Ca2+] in the ER in close proximity to the plasma membrane. Thus, the mechanism involved in regulation of SOCE is contained within the ER-plasma membrane junctional region. Store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) 3The abbreviations used are: SOCE, store-operated Ca2+ entry; IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; SERCA, sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase(s); ER, endoplasmic reticulum; SOC, store-operated Ca2+; Tg, thapsigargin; BD-Tg, Bodipy-fluorescein thapsigargin; CCh, carbachol; 2-APB, 2-aminoethyldiphenylborinate; SES, standard extracellular solution; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; TIRF, total internal reflection fluorescence; TIRFM, TIRF microscopy. is activated in response to depletion of Ca2+ in intracellular Ca2+ store(s). SOCE not only ensures refilling of the intracellular Ca2+ stores but also provides sustained elevation of cytosolic [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]i). Physiologically, SOCE is activated by agonist-stimulated generation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and IP3-mediated release of Ca2+ from ER Ca2+ stores via the IP3 receptor. It has been clearly demonstrated that during refilling of internal Ca2+ stores, Ca2+ entering the cell is rapidly taken up into the ER by SERCA activity with minimal diffusion in the subplasma membrane region. These studies indicate close apposition of the ER and plasma membrane at the site of SOCE (1Liu X. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol.

Cell Calcium. 1990; 11: 611-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1261) Google Scholar). Thus, it has been suggested that ER localized in the subplasma membrane region is likely to be coupled to SOCE and that depletion of these local Ca2+ stores triggers activation of SOCE. The presently proposed mechanisms for activation of SOCE suggest direct physical coupling between components in the ER and plasma membrane, generation of diffusible components, or recruitment of the SOC channel. The exact mechanism involved in regulation of SOCE as well as the molecular components of the channel(s) mediating Ca2+ entry in different types of cells has not been clearly identified. Recent studies have suggested STIM1 (stromal interacting molecule 1) as a novel regulator for SOCE. STIM1, which is a Ca2+-binding protein localized diffusely in the ER, has been shown to relocate into a peripheral region of the cell in response to internal Ca2+ store depletion (7Luik R.M. Wu M.M. Buchanan J. Lewis R.S. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 815-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 8Wu M.M. Buchanan J. Luik R.M. Lewis R.S. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 803-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). STIM1 displays punctate subplasma membrane localization in response to depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores, which has been reported to be causal in activation of SOCE and to define the elementary unit that is involved in SOCE. Although several studies have clearly established involvement of ER-plasma membrane junctional domains in the regulation of SOCE, the exact site of store depletion has not yet been demonstrated. Based on all of the data available presently, it is logical to propose that that since the EF-hand domain of STIM1 is localized in the lumen of the ER and STIM1 punctae involved in SOCE activation are localized in subplasma membrane Ca2+ stores very close to the surface membrane (probably interacting with SOCE channels), this ER Ca2+ store would have to be depleted for activation of SOCE. Further, these stores would have to remain in a depleted state in order to retain the punctate localization of STIM1, which is required to maintain SOCE in an activated state. However, conditions typically used for activating SOCE and assessing STIM1 function (8Wu M.M. Buchanan J. Luik R.M. Lewis R.S. J.

Thus, it is unclear whether changes in the local Ca2+ store (i.e. in the vicinity where regulation of SOCE seems to be taking place) regulate relocation of STIM1 and activation of SOCE or whether signals from more interior regions of the cell are required. In this study, we have assessed whether STIM1 regulation of SOCE is dependent on the [Ca2+] in subplasma membrane ER or in more internal ER. We have used low concentrations of Tg to slow down the process of ER depletion and activation of SOCE. It has been previously shown that low concentrations of Tg that induce only partial depletion of internal Ca2+ stores result in a slow but almost complete activation of ICRAC (14Glitsch M.D. Parekh A.B. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 523: 283-290Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 15Huang Y. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19554-19559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), although these previous studies do not clarify the location of the SOCE-coupled ER Ca2+ store. We demonstrate that as Tg diffuses into the periphery of the cell, Ca2+ stores in this region are depleted, and this is associated with activation of SOCE. SOCE is not further enhanced by depletion of more internal ER. Further, we show that mobilization of the SOCE regulatory protein STIM1 in the subplasma membrane region of the cells is associated with depletion of ER in this region. Together, our data suggest that STIM1 senses [Ca2+] within ER localized in the ER-plasma membrane junctional regions and that the status of this peripheral ER Ca2+ store determines peripheral relocation of STIM1 that is required for activation of SOCE.

Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy—Immunofluorescence was conducted in a similar manner as described previously (22Bandyopadhyay B.C. Swaim W.D. Liu X. Redman R.S. Patterson R.L.

Vybrant Staining Assay—Vybrant staining assay was used to evaluate apoptosis, using the method described previously (24Bollimuntha S. Singh B.B. Shavali S. Sharma S.K. Ebadi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2132-2140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). TIRF Imaging—HSG cells were seeded and cultured overnight on glass coverslips, which formed the base of a perfusion chamber that was mounted on the stage of an Olympus IX81 motorized inverted microscope (OPELCO, Dulles, VA). Prior to the start of imaging, cells were loaded with 4 μm Fluo-4AM in aCa2+-SES for 1 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. To determine ER localization in the subplasma membrane regions, cells were loaded with 1 μm ER-Tracker Red dye for 1 h at 37 °C. TIRF imaging was then conducted as described previously (25Ong H.L. Liu X. Sharma A. Hegde R.S. Ambudkar I.S. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2007; 453: 797-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Changes in Fluo-4 fluorescence were calculated using KaleidaGraph software (Red Rock Software, Salt Lake City, UT) and were expressed as ΔF/F0, where F is the fluorescence captured at a particular time point and F0 is the mean fluorescence intensity from the initial 20 captured images. Submaximal Depletion of ER Ca2+ Store Activates SOCE—Stimulation of HSG cells by the endoplasmic Ca2+ pump inhibitor Tg (1 μm) induces an initial rapid increase in [Ca2+]i (represented by the 340/380 fluorescence ratio; Fig. 1A) due to internal Ca2+ release, which is detected as a transient [Ca2+]i increase in the absence of external Ca2+. The addition of Ca2+ to the external medium after internal store depletion induces a second increase in [Ca2+]i due to Ca2+ influx. At this concentration, Tg induces almost complete depletion of the internal IP3-sensitive Ca2+ store (the addition of Tg after carbachol induced some additional Ca2+ release but not vice versa; data not shown). Further, caffeine does not affect Tg- or carbachol-induced [Ca2+]i increase in HSG cells (data not shown). The contribution of mitochondrial Ca2+ transport to the Tg-stimulated [Ca2+]i changes was not assessed. To determine the extent of [Ca2+]ER depletion required for activation of SOCE, we examined internal Ca2+ release and Ca2+ entry induced by lower [Tg]. 0.5 μm, 10 nm, and 1 nm Tg induced slower and less internal Ca2+ release than 1 μm Tg (Fig. 1B). Importantly, substantial Ca2+ entry was seen at the lower [Tg], and neither the rates nor amplitudes of the [Ca2+] increase at the various [Tg] were significantly different from each other (see Fig. 1D and also traces in Fig. 1, E and G). The extent of store depletion was assessed by the addition of 1 μm Tg after treatment of cells with lower [Tg] (Fig. 1, C and D). The 1 μm Tg-induced [Ca2+]i increase was reduced by <50% in cells pretreated with 1 nm Tg for 500 s, suggesting that at least 50% of internal Ca2+ store was not associated with activation of Ca2+ entry. Similarly, 10 nm and 0.5 μm also induced less store depletion compared with 1 μm Tg (see Fig. 1D). These data demonstrate that Ca2+ entry is activated even when internal Ca2+ stores are incompletely depleted. To confirm that SOCE is activated by 1 nm Tg, we examined the effects of Gd3+ and 2-APB, both of which are used to block SOCE (26Parekh A.B. Putney Jr., J.W. Physiol. Rev. 2005; 85: 757-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1800) Google Scholar, 27Putney Jr., J.W. Mol. Intervent. 2001; 1: 84-94PubMed Google Scholar). Ca2+ entry stimulated by 1 μm and 1 nm Tg was inhibited by 1 μm Gd3+ and 10 μm 2-APB (Fig. 1, E-H, respectively). The inhibitory effect of 1 μm Gd3+ was seen whether it was added before or after 1 mm CaCl2 (Fig. 1E, inset; data with 1 nm Tg not shown). These findings strongly suggest that SOCE is activated under conditions where there is relatively less depletion of the ER Ca2+ store. 1 nm Tg, like 1 μm Tg, also activated the previously described inwardly rectifying store-operated Ca2+ current, ISOC, in HSG cells (1Liu X. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29891-29898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2, A-C). However, the magnitude of the current with 1 nm Tg was about 60% less than that with 1 μm Tg, and there was also a longer lag before an increase in current was detected (209 ± 55 s compared with 20 ± 4 s with 1 μm Tg). Notably, the current developed rapidly after this lag period and appeared to be quite stable, unlike the current with 1 μm Tg, which inactivated more rapidly. These data are inconsistent with the Fura-2 data, which demonstrate that 1 μm and 1 nm Tg activate similar magnitude of SOCE, although activation is slower at the lower [Tg]. We hypothesized that this discrepancy could be due to a contribution of Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release to the Fura-2 fluorescence measurements (28Yao J. Li Q. Chen J. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21511-21519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Alternatively, it could be a result of recycling of Ca2+ into the ER store by residual SERCA activity in cells treated with the lower [Tg]. It should be noted that since ISOC measurements were done in the presence of 10 mm external Ca2+, it is possible that, despite the buffering of Ca2+ in the pipette solution, Ca2+ entering the cell is taken back into the ER to partially refill the store (3Parekh A.B. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 547: 333-348Crossref Scopus (169) Google Scholar). However, removal of external Ca2+ (as was the case in the Fura-2 assay) would allow this store to be substantially depleted. Uptake of Ca2+ into the ER by the residual SERCA activity in cells stimulated with low [Tg] will also result in lower ambient [Ca2+]i, which would attenuate Ca2+-dependent inactivation of SOCE and account for the relatively stable ISOC in these cells. To determine the possible contribution of Ca2+ entry and ER Ca2+ recycling, ISOC was measured in a divalent cation-free external medium (Figs. 2, D-F). Under these conditions, (i) the magnitudes of the steady-state currents induced by 1 nm and 1 μm Tg were similar, and (ii) the lag time for current activation with 1 nm Tg was reduced (140 compared with 209 s). The possible contribution of Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release was confirmed by measuring Ba2+ entry stimulated by 1 nm or 1 μm Tg. As seen in the traces shown in Fig. 2, G and H, similar levels of Ba2+ entry were induced under the two conditions (basal Ba2+ entry into these cells was not detectable). In aggregate, these data suggest that Ca2+ entry and reuptake into ER account for the lower magnitude and in part for the longer lag time for activation of ISOC (with Ca2+ as the charge carrier) in cells treated with 1 nm Tg. The longer lag for activation of ISOC at the lower [Tg] is also due to the longer diffusion time and probably reflects the time required to inhibit enough SERCA to achieve sufficient depletion of ER Ca2+. Once this is achieved, ISOC is rapidly activated. The relatively slow internal Ca2+ release induced by 1 nm Tg allowed us to examine the temporal characteristics of SOCE activation. The readdition of external Ca2+ at 20, 50, 150, and 250 s after stimulation with 1 nm Tg in Ca2+-free medium resulted in substantial elevations of [Ca2+]i (Figs. 3, A-D, respectively), which was blocked by 2-APB (Fig. 3C, dashed line). Fig. 3E demonstrates that SOCE is half-maximally activated within 20 s and maximally activated by 150 s. The magnitude of SOCE activated by 1 nm Tg at 150 s was similar to that activated by 1 μm Tg for 300 s (asterisk in Fig. 3E). Note that longer incubation with either the low or high Tg did not induce any further increase in SOCE. The addition of 1 μm Tg after stimulation with 1 nm Tg for 150 s demonstrated that there was about 30% depletion of the internal Ca2+ store (data not shown, but compare with Fig. 1C). Together, these data demonstrate that SOCE is maximally activated by 150 s after 1 nm Tg treatment. To confirm this, SOCE was measured using Mn2+ asaCa2+ surrogate (29Mertz L.M. Baum B.J. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15010-15014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 50 s after the addition of 1 nm Tg, the rate of Fura-2 quenching was substantially less than that induced by 1 μm Tg (Fig. 3F). However, similar Mn2+ entry was seen in cells stimulated for 150 and 250 s with either 1 nm or 1 μm Tg (Fig. 3, G and H). In aggregate, these data suggest that depletion of SOCE-coupled stores with 1 nm Tg is slow at first due to recycling of Ca2+ into the ER by residual SERCA activity. This would also account for the transient increase in [Ca2+]i at the 20 s time point (Fig. 3A). With time enough, SERCA are inactivated to prevent this recycling, thus resulting in complete activation of SOCE (similar magnitude seen with 1 nm Tg and 1 μm Tg). Translocation of STIM1 by Low and High Concentrations of Thapsigargin—STIM1 has been proposed to be an essential regulatory protein for SOCE (10Liou J. Kim M.L. Heo W.D. Jones J.T. Myers J.W.

It is translocated to the plasma membrane region of cells upon depletion of internal Ca2+ stores, and this translocation has been associated with activation of SOCE. We have used TIRFM to examine localization of heterologously expressed YFP-STIM1 in HSG cells. Both low and high concentrations of Tg stimulated movement of YFP-STIM1 in the subplasma membrane in cells maintained in a Ca2+-containing medium in contrast to control cells expressing mYFP alone, which does not change (Fig. 4A). However, although there was a fast and almost uniform increase in STIM1 punctae with 1 μm Tg (Fig. 4B; punctae were detected at 2 min and maximum by 4 min), translocation of STIM1 with 1 nm Tg (Fig. 4C) was relatively slower (4 and 6 min time points are shown). The addition of 1 μm Tg after 1 nm Tg to these cells induced a further increase in STIM1 in the subplasma membrane region (data not shown). Importantly, when cells were treated with 1 nm Tg in the absence of external Ca2+, the extent of STIM1 relocalization was similar to that induced by 1 μm Tg (Fig. 4D). The data in Fig. 4, B-D, are fully consistent with the functional data shown in Figs. 1, 2 and 3. In the presence of 1 nm Tg, rapid recycling of Ca2+ that enters cells incubated in a Ca2+-containing medium prevents complete depletion of the ER Ca2+ store, thus accounting for the lower SOCE and less STIM1 redistribution into punctae. When Ca2+ is removed from the external solution, the store depletes more substantially, and thus when Ca2+ is readded to the external medium, comparable influx is seen in the two conditions. These data clearly demonstrate that incomplete depletion of ER Ca2+ stores is sufficient for relocalization of STIM1 and activation of SOCE. Depletion of Peripheral Ca2+ Stores Is Associated with STIM1 Relocation and SOCE Activation—We assessed the localization of the ER stores involved in STIM1 regulation of SOCE by using several different experimental protocols. First, BD-Tg and live cell confocal imaging were used to determine the extent of diffusion (and thus localization) of Tg in HSG cells during activation of SOCE. 1 μm BD-Tg rapidly induced strong labeling of all of the ER (Fig. 5B, top, shows x-y image). The x-z image (Fig. 5B, bottom) demonstrates that this labeling is predominantly perinuclear. In comparison, the pattern of labeling seen with 1 nm BD-Tg was quite distinct. Strong punctate labeling was seen only in the subplasma membrane region (Fig. 5A, top, shows x-y image) with very little intracellular fluorescence. This was confirmed by the x-z image of the cells (Fig. 5A, bottom), which clearly shows the peripheral localization of this signal. Overlay of Bodipy-fluorescein and differential interference contrast images of selected cells are shown in Fig. 5C. Further, specificity of labeling was assessed by preincubation of cells with 2 nm Tg for 3 min before treatment with 1 nm BD-Tg. This preincubation dampened the labeling of the cells with BD-Tg (Fig. 5D;at higher [BD-Tg], initial fluorescence was similarly dampened by preincubation of cells with an equivalent concentration of non-fluorescent Tg). Fluorescence was measured in selected regions of the cell following stimulation with 1 nm Tg (Fig. 5E) (images were collected up to 3 min, and data from the first 150 s are shown; note that SOCE was maximally activated by 1 nm Tg within 150 s). BD-Tg fluorescence in the subplasma membrane region increased within the 5 s after Tg addition and continued to rise, leveling out at after 150 s. Signal in the nucleus did not significantly increase until about 100 s. Fluorescence in the internal region was less than in the subplasma membrane ER and displayed a slow, somewhat linear increase after a longer initial lag. Thus, with 1 nm BD-Tg, initial labeling was mostly limited to the subplasma membrane region of the cell, suggesting that SOCE activation by 1 nm Tg is coincident with the presence of Tg in the subplasma membrane region of the cell. With time, there was further diffusion of Tg into the more internal region of the cell and more global inactivation of SERCA in the cells but without a corresponding increase in SOCE. The peripheral localization of 1 nm BD-Tg during activation of Ca2+ entry suggests that the ER in this region is depleted rather than the more internal ER. This was examined using a mathematical model based on the data in Fig. 5 and in a previous report (15Huang Y. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19554-19559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We wanted to test whether a model with two ER compartments that are functionally distinct but slowly equilibrate with each through diffusion of Ca2+ between them (see supplemental materials for details) could account for the data in Fig. 3, A-C. supplemental Fig. 1, A-C, confirms that this simple model reproduces those observation. The simulations further predict (supplemental Fig. 1, D-F) that when cells are treated with 1 nm Tg, there is greater depletion of the local subplasma membrane Ca2+ store than the inter"
https://openalex.org/W2007576401,"Small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) has emerged as a key post-translational modulator of protein functions. Here we show that TIF1β, a developmental regulator proposed to act as a universal co-repressor for the large family of KRAB domain-containing zinc finger proteins, is a heavily SUMO-modified substrate. A combined analysis of deletion and punctual mutants identified TIF1β as a multilysine acceptor for SUMO which specifically targets six lysine residues (Lys554, Lys575, Lys676, Lys750, Lys779, and Lys804) within the TIF1β C-terminal repressive region. Reporter gene assays indicate that TIF1β requires SUMO-modification for its repressive activity. Indeed, sumoylation-less mutants failed to recapitulate TIF1β-dependent repression. TIF1β homodimerization properties and interaction with the KRAB domain are preserved in the mutants with lysine to arginine substitutions as confirmed by in vivo bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET). Using histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, we also demonstrate that TIF1β sumoylation is a prerequisite for the recruitment of HDAC and that TIF1β SUMO-dependent repressive activity involves both HDAC-dependent and HDAC-independent components. Finally, we report that, in addition to relying on the integrity of its PHD finger and on its self-oligomerization, TIF1β sumoylation is positively regulated by its interaction with KRAB domain-containing proteins. Altogether, our results provide new mechanistic insights into TIF1β transcriptional repression and suggest that KRAB multifinger proteins not only recruit TIF1β co-repressor to target genes but also increase its repressive activity through enhancement of its sumoylation.

The TIF1β PHD finger and bromo domain were reported to cooperate in transcriptional repression via recruitment of repressive enzymatic activities such as histone deacetylase complexes (NurD/Mi2-α) and a methyltransferase protein (SETDB1) (15Schultz D.C.

In attempts to unveil other determinants involved in the strong repressive activity mediated by TIF1β, we found that this co-repressor is a SUMO target protein. Recent studies have demonstrated that post-translational modification of transcription factors and their co-regulators by the small ubiquitin-related modifier protein, SUMO, can modulate their transcriptional activity (24Gill G.

The four mammalian SUMO, SUMO1, -2, -3, and -4, all resemble ubiquitin in terms of tertiary structure and their mechanism of conjugation to protein substrate. However, unlike ubiquitination, the main known functional consequences of SUMO modification appear not to be degradation (29Bayer P. Arndt A. Metzger S. Mahajan R. Melchior F. Jaenicke R. Becker J.

SUMO proteins form an isopeptide bond between their C-terminal glycine and a ϵ-NH2-amino group of a lysine residue on their target proteins (51Saitoh H. Pu R.T. Dasso M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 374-376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The target lysine to which SUMO is conjugated is usually contained within a short consensus sequence, ψKX(E/D) (where ψ represents a large hydrophobic residue) (52Melchior F. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 591-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). The SUMO conjugation process, so called sumoylation, involves SUMO-activating E1 enzyme (SAE1/SAE2 heterodimer) and a SUMO-conjugating E2 enzyme (UBC9) (53Okuma T. Honda R. Ichikawa G. Tsumagari N. Yasuda H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Furthermore, SUMO-specific E3 ligases that enhance SUMO conjugation have also been described. The known E3 ligases belong to three structurally independent protein classes represented by RanBP2, Pc2, and PIAS family members (protein inhibitor of activated STAT) (54Kagey M.H. Melhuish T.A.

SUMO E3 ligases display limited substrate specificity and are reported to stabilize the interaction between the E2-conjugating enzyme, UBC9, and the target substrates to be sumoylated (53Okuma T.

Like ubiquitination, sumoylation is a dynamic and reversible process because of the existence of several SUMO-specific proteases, referred to as members of the SENP (sentrin proteases) family. These proteases are involved both in the maturation of SUMO as C-terminal hydrolases and in the removal of SUMO from its target protein as isopeptidases (58Melchior F. Schergaut M. Pichler A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 612-618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). In this study, we report that TIF1β is a strong substrate for SUMO modification exhibiting several sumoylation sites clustered in its C-terminal repressive region. Prevention of TIF1β sumoylation by using sumoylation-deficient mutants abrogates its repressive activity both as a protein artificially targeted to DNA or indirectly recruited to DNA via a KRAB domain-containing protein. Furthermore, we demonstrate that TIF1β SUMO modification is required for recruitment of HDAC-containing complexes. Finally, this study indicates that TIF1β sumoylation can be positively regulated by its homodimerization and its interaction with KRAB domain-containing multifinger proteins which are recruiting this co-repressor to target genes. TIF1β Constructs—Full-length TIF1β (GenBank™ accession number NM_011588; aa1–834) was derived from the pMFH-Gal4-TIF1β construct (generous gift from Dr. J. V. Bonventre) (3Kim S.S. Chen Y.M.

To generate Myc-tagged TIF1β, a ClaI-NotI-blunted fragment was transferred from SK+-TIF1β into the blunted XbaI site of pcDNA3.1-Myc (pcDNA3.1-Myc-TIF1β). Flag-HA-TIF1β was obtained by subcloning an EcoRV-NotI fragment from SK+-TIF1β into pcDNA3-Flag-HA (pcDNA3-Flag-HA-TIF1β). pcDNA3.1-Gal4DBD-TIF1β construct was obtained by subcloning Gal4DBD-TIF1β as an HindIII-SalI fragment from pGBT9 vector (Clontech) into the HindIII-XhoI sites of pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). C-terminal deletion mutants Gal4DBD-TIF1β-(1–735) (Δ1) or Gal4DBD-TIF1β-(1–675) (Δ2) were generated from pcDNA3.1-Gal4DBD-TIF1β by removing the KpnI-XbaI or EcoNI-XbaI C-terminal fragments, respectively. Gal4DBD-TIF1β-(1–563) (Δ3) or Gal4DBD-TIF1β-(1–482) (Δ4) were obtained by subcloning a HindIII-SacI or HindIII-AflII fragments from pGBT9-TIF1β into the HindIII-EcoRV sites of pcDNA3.1, respectively. TIF1β devoid of the N-terminal homodimerization RBCC motif and encoding the HP1 binding domain, the PHD finger and the bromo domain (ΔN-TIF1β; from nucleotides 1806 to the stop codon of TIF1β at position 3063) was amplified by PCR and cloned inphase as a BamHI fragment into the BamHI site of pCGN and as a BamHI-SalI fragment into pGBT9 to generate pGBT9 ΔN-TIF1β. A Gal4DBD-ΔN-TIF1β construct was obtained by subcloning the HindIII-SalI fragment from pcBT9 ΔN-TIF1β into the HindIII-XhoI sites of pcDNA3.1. TIF1β point mutations were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) starting with fragments of the wild-type cDNA cloned in pBluescript SK+.

Human embryonic kidney 293T cells (HEK 293T) maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Wisent), 100 μg/ml penicillin and streptomycin, 1 mml-glutamine were seeded at a density of 3 × 105 cells per 60-mm dish for cell extracts and immunoprecipitation experiments, 1 × 106 cells per 100-mm dish for BRET experiments, and 2 × 105 in 6-well plates for transcriptional assays. Transient transfections of plasmids were performed on the following day using the calcium phosphate precipitation method except for transcription assays where FuGENE transfection reagent (3 μl/1 μg DNA) (Roche Applied Science) was used. The total amount of transfected DNA was kept constant (10 μg for 100-mm dishes, 6 μg for 60-mm dishes, and 1–1.3 μg for 6-well plates). For preparing whole cell extracts to be separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, cells were lysed in denaturating Laemmli buffer (400–600 μl/dish) containing 20 mm NEM (N-ethylmaleimide), a cysteine protease inhibitor usually used to preserve the sumoylation of cellular proteins. DNA was immediately sheared using a 1-ml syringe with a 26-gauge ½ needle or sonicated to reduce sample viscosity. For immunoprecipitation, cells were lysed in SDS-solubilizing buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.8% SDS, 20 mm NEM) (1.5 ml/dish) completed with a mixed proteases inhibitors. The following steps were done at 4 °C. Extracts were passed through a 26-gauge ½ needle to reduce viscosity and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 2 min. Extracts were then precleared with protein A-Sepharose (1 ml/10–20 μl stacked beads) (Sigma) for 1 h. Immunoprecipitations of the precleared extracts (1 ml) were then carried out for 16 h using 10 μl of the appropriate antibody and 40–50 μl of protein A-Sepharose. The protein A-Sepharose beads were washed three times with 1 ml of washing buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.4% SDS, 2% Triton, 20 mm NEM). Washed immunoprecipitates were resuspended in Laemmli buffer. Whole cell extracts and immunoprecipitates were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrotransferred for Western blotting. Following probing of the nitrocellulose membranes with the relevant antibodies, a chemiluminescence reagent was used (Renaissance kit, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The BRET assays were conducted as we previously described in Ref. 14Germain-Desprez D. Bazinet M. Bouvier M. Aubry M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22367-22373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar. In brief, transiently transfected cells were resuspended and distributed in 96-well microplates (white Optiplate from Packard). Upon addition of the cell permeant luciferase substrate (coelenterazine deep blue, PerkinElmer Life Sciences), the bioluminescence signal resulting from its degradation was detected using a 370–450-nm band pass filter (donor emission peak 400 nm). The energy transferred resulted in a fluorescence signal emitted by the GFP10 acceptor (excitation peak 400 nm and emission peak 510 nm) that was detected using a 500–530-nm band pass filter. The BRET signal (BRET ratio) was quantified by calculating the acceptor fluorescence/donor bioluminescence ratio as previously reported. Expression level of each construct was determined by direct measurements of total fluorescence and luminescence on aliquots of transfected cell samples. The GFP10 total fluorescence was measured using a FluoroCount (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with an excitation filter at 400 nm, an emission filter at 510 nm. The total luminescence was measured using the same cells incubated with coelenterazine H for 10 min (Molecular Probes) (emission peak 485 nm). The BRET ratios were plotted as a function of the GFP/LUC fusion protein expression ratio, both fusion proteins expression being assessed with the same cells as described above, to take into account the potential variations in the expression of individual constructs from transfection to transfection. As a negative control, the Rluc-TIF1β/GFP-NLS BRET pair evaluating random collision was used as in Ref. 14Germain-Desprez D. Bazinet M. Bouvier M. Aubry M. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1994850457,"Global influenza surveillance is one of the most effective strategies for containing outbreaks and preparing for a possible pandemic influenza. Since the end of 2003, highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAI) H5N1 have caused many outbreaks in poultries and wild birds from East Asia and have spread to at least 48 countries. For such a fast and wide-spreading virulent pathogen, prediction based on changes of micro- and macro-environment has rarely been evaluated. In this study, we are developing a new climatic approach by investigating the conditions that occurred before the H5N1 avian influenza outbreaks for early predicting future HPAI outbreaks and preventing pandemic disasters. The results show a temperature drop shortly before these outbreaks in birds in each of the Eurasian regions stricken in 2005 and 2006. Dust storms, like those that struck near China's Lake Qinghai around May 4, 2005, exacerbated the spread of this HPAI H5N1 virus, causing the deaths of a record number of wild birds and triggering the subsequent spread of H5N1. Weather monitoring could play an important role in the early warning of outbreaks of this potentially dangerous virus."

Here we identify the CPH domains (conserved domain within Cul7, PARC, and HERC2 proteins) of both Cul7 and PARC as p53 interaction domains using size exclusion chromatography and NMR spectroscopy. We present the first structure of the evolutionarily conserved CPH domain and provide novel insight into the Cul7-p53 interaction. The NMR structure of the Cul7-CPH domain reveals a fold similar to peptide interaction modules such as the SH3, Tudor, and KOW domains.

The CPH domain interaction surface of p53 resides in the tetramerization domain and is formed by residues contributed by at least two subunits. The ubiquitin-proteosome system plays an important role in controlling diverse biological processes, ranging from signal transduction to cell cycle control (1Hochstrasser M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar, 2Cardozo T. Pagano M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 739-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). These complex processes are controlled via specific degradation of individual or groups of proteins. Protein degradation via the ubiquitin path-way involves two successive steps: tagging of the substrate by covalent attachment of multiple ubiquitin molecules (ubiquitylation) and degradation of the tagged protein by 26 S proteo-some complex with release of free and reusable ubiquitin (3Schwartz A.L. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Med. 1999; 50: 57-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Ubiquitylation is the ultimate result of coordinated activity of an enzymatic cascade, which includes a ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), 3The abbreviations used are: E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin carrier protein; E3, ubiquitin-ligating enzyme; TD, tetramerization domain; TCEP, Tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine hydrochloride; NOE, nuclear Over-hauser effect; NOESY, NOE spectroscopy; MQLR, M340Q/L344R; HSQC, heteronuclear correlated spectroscopy; TOCSY, total correlated spectroscopy. 3The abbreviations used are: E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin carrier protein; E3, ubiquitin-ligating enzyme; TD, tetramerization domain; TCEP, Tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine hydrochloride; NOE, nuclear Over-hauser effect; NOESY, NOE spectroscopy; MQLR, M340Q/L344R; HSQC, heteronuclear correlated spectroscopy; TOCSY, total correlated spectroscopy. a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), and ubiquitin-ligating (E3) enzymes. The E3 ligases are the “brain” of this process and determine substrate specificity (4Petroski M.D. Deshaies R.J. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Cul7, is a recently identified member of the Cullin family of ubiquitin E3 ligases, localizes predominantly in the cytoplasm (6Andrews P. He Y.J. Xiong Y. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 4534-4548Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and forms a unique Skp1-Cul7-Fbx29-like complex with FBXW8, a WD40 containing F-box protein (7Dias D.C. Dolios G. Wang R.

Although a target substrate for FBXW8 has not been yet identified, Cul7 recruits RBX1 to form a Skp1-Cul7-Fbx29-like E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (7Dias D.C. Dolios G. Wang R. Pan Z.Q. Proc. Natl.

Xiong Y. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 4534-4548Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Cul7 has significant sequence similarity (see Fig. 1) with the p53-associated, Parkin-like cytoplasmic protein, PARC (10Nikolaev A.Y. Li M. Puskas N. Qin J. Gu W. Cell. 2003; 112: 29-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Both proteins contain CPH (domain that is conserved in Cul7, PARC, and HERC2 proteins) (11Kasper J.S. Arai T. Decaprio J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 348: 132-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), DOC (DOC1/APC10), and Cullin homology domains (see Fig. 1A) that are linked with E3 ligase function, suggesting that PARC and Cul7 may both function as E3 ubiquitin ligases. PARC has been shown to sequester p53 in the cytoplasm via interaction between the N terminus of PARC and the C terminus of p53 (10Nikolaev A.Y. Li M. Puskas N. Qin J. Gu W. Cell. 2003; 112: 29-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Cul7 may perform functions similar to those of PARC given their degree of sequence similarity and have also recently been shown to interact directly with p53 via its N terminus (6Andrews P. He Y.J. Xiong Y. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 4534-4548Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 11Kasper J.S. Arai T. Decaprio J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 348: 132-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Recently published data identified a domain within Cul7 that is necessary and sufficient for p53 binding (6Andrews P. He Y.J. Xiong Y. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 4534-4548Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 11Kasper J.S. Arai T. Decaprio J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 348: 132-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This domain (the CPH domain) also contributes to the cytoplasmic localization of Cul7 (6Andrews P. He Y.J. Xiong Y. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 4534-4548Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 11Kasper J.S. Arai T. Decaprio J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 348: 132-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This, taken together with its similarity to PARC, another p53 interacting protein and putative E3 ligase, argues for more detailed investigation of these two proteins with respect to their interactions with p53. Understanding the structure, function, and interactions of Cul7/PARC domains with p53 will help to elucidate their involvement in ubiquitylation pathways and the circumstances through which they impinge on the p53 pathway. Inactivation of p53 is considered an important step in the development of many human cancers. It is therefore important to determine how p53 levels are regulated and how this regulation is altered in cancer. Transcriptionally active p53 protein is tetrameric, and in this conformation it binds with high affinity to DNA or interacts more efficiently with various other proteins (12Hainaut P. Hollstein M. Adv. Cancer Res. 2000; 77: 81-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar, 13Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2279) Google Scholar). The tetramerization domain is therefore important for p53 function because it ensures that the protein is endowed with its correct conformation. The oligomerization state of p53 is also thought to contribute to its subcellular localization by virtue of a cryptic nuclear export sequence that is only exposed in nontetrameric forms of the protein (14Stommel J.M. Marchenko N.D. Jimenez G.S. Moll U.M. Hope T.J. Wahl G.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1660-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). Here we show that the conserved CPH domain of Cul7 interacts with the tetramerization domain (TD) of p53. To gain insight into Cul7 and its interaction with p53, we have solved the three-dimensional structure of the CPH domain of human Cul7 by NMR spectroscopy. The structure reveals a small domain with a fold similar to SH3, KOW, and Tudor domains, suggesting that it may function as a peptide-binding module. Chemical shift perturbation studies map the p53-TD interaction to regions distinct from the analogous peptide-binding surface of Tudor, KOW, and SH3 domains. Our NMR data also suggest that the Cul7-p53 interaction depends on the p53 oligomerization status. The structures and interactions were compared with the homologous region of PARC, confirming a similar interaction with the CPH domain of PARC. Cloning, Expression, and Purification—The coding regions for Cul7 360-460 and PARC 366-465 (CPH-containing domains) and the p53 TD (residues 310-360) were PCR-amplified from human Cul7 cDNA and human p53 cDNA, respectively, and subcloned into the pET15b expression vector (Novagen) at the 5′-NdeI site and 3′-BamHI site. The p53 fragment was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3)-pLysS cells (Stratagene), whereas Cul7 and PARC constructs were expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) Rosetta cells (Novagen). For large scale production, the cells were grown at 37 °C until A600 nm of ∼1.0, and then the cultures were induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 5 h at room temperature before harvesting. The bacteria were grown in LB medium for nonlabeled proteins and in M9-defined medium supplemented with [15N]ammonium chloride (0.8 g/liter) and d-glucose. For the 15N/13C-labeled samples, d-glucose was replaced by 13C6-d-glucose (4 g/liter). These highly expressed proteins were purified by Talon (BD) affinity chromatography under native conditions and eluted with buffer containing 500 mm imidazole. The proteins were treated with thrombin and further purified by size exclusion chromatography using a HiLoad 26/60 Super-dex-75 column (GE Healthcare). Gel Filtration Studies—A calibrated Superdex 75 column was equilibrated with 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 2 mm benzamidine, 0.5 mm TCEP, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cul7-CPH and p53-TD were combined in 1:1 and 1:3 molar ratios and subjected to gel filtration chromatography (see Fig. 4A, shown in blue and black, respectively). Peak fractions were pooled and run on SDS-PAGE. NMR Spectroscopy—All of the spectra were recorded at 25 °C on Varian INOVA 600 MHz and Bruker Avance 500 MHz spectrometers equipped with triple resonance 1H/13C/15N cold and cryoprobes, respectively. All of the NMR samples were prepared at pH 7.5 with 25 mm Tris, 250 mm NaCl, 2 mm benzamidine hydrochloride, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm TCEP. The final NMR samples contained 90% H2O, 10% D2O with a protein concentration ranging between 0.5 and 0.7 mm. Two-dimensional, gradient-enhanced 1H/15N HSQC root mean square deviation spectra were acquired on uniformly 15N- or 13C/15N-labeled Cul7- and PARC-CPH domains and 15N-labeled p53-TD. The spectra were processed with NMRPipe software (15Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11280) Google Scholar) and analyzed with the SPARKY program (T. D. Goddard and D. G. Kneller, SPARKY 3, University of California, San Francisco). Linear prediction in the 13C and 15N dimensions was used to improve the digital resolution. The assignment of 94.8% of 1H, 15N, and 13C resonances of Cul7-CPH domain was obtained with the automated ABACUS approach (16Grishaev A. Steren C.A. Wu B. Pineda-Lucena A. Arrowsmith C. Llinas M. Proteins. 2005; 61: 36-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) combined with manual analysis using data from HNCO, CBCA(CO)NH, HBHA(CO)NH, CC(CO)NH-TOCSY, HC(CO)NH-TOCSY HC(C)H-TOCSY, and (H)CCH-TOCSY experiments. The assignment of ∼80% of 1H, 15N, and 13C resonances of the PARC-CPH domain were based on the following experiments: HNCACB, CBCA(CO)NH, HNCO, HNCA, and (H)CCH-TOCSY. The backbone resonances (1HN, 15N) of Cul7- and PARC-CPH domains obtained upon the addition of p53-TD were assigned assuming minimal change in chemical shifts relative to the unbound proteins. Structure Calculations—Distance restraints for structure calculations were obtained from 13C-edited NOESY-HSQC (τm = 120 ms) and 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC (τm = 150 ms) experiments. NOESY spectra were analyzed with the SPARKY program. The NOE-derived distance restraints were classified into four categories: 1.8-2.8, 1.8-3.5, 1.8-5.0, and 1.8-6.0Å, corresponding to strong, medium, weak, and very weak NOEs, respectively. The restraints for backbone φ and ψ torsion angles were derived from chemical shifts of backbone atoms using TALOS (17Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2727) Google Scholar). No hydrogen bond constraints were used. Structure calculations were carried out using CNS version 1.1 (18Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16919) Google Scholar) with its standard annealing protocol. Five iterative cycles of automated structure calculation and NOE assignment were applied. Automated NOE assignment was performed using the BACUS procedure (19Grishaev A. Llinas M. J. Biomol. NMR. 2004; 28: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). 15N-1H residual dipolar coupling constraints were incorporated in structure calculations on cycles 2-5 using floating alignment tensor (SANI (20Tjandra N. Omichinski J.G. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Bax A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 732-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar) energy term with force constant of 2.0 kcal/mol·Hz2). On each cycle, the best 20 of 100 generated structures were selected for 1) filtering prior NOE assignments followed by a BACUS search for new identities and 2) estimating the magnitude of the axial and rhombic components of the alignment tensor using the PALES program (21Zweckstetter M.

Proteins. 2006; 66: 778-795Crossref Scopus (538) Google Scholar). A homology model of PARC-CPH was generated from the NMR structure of the Cul7-CPH using YASARA (www.yasara.com). NMR Titration Experiments—Aliquots of 15N-labeled p53-TD and Cul7-CPH proteins were titrated into the unlabeled Cul7-CPH and p53-TD in molar ratios of 1:1, 1:2, 1:3, 1:4, and 1:5, respectively, until no further changes in chemical shifts were detected in the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum. HSQC spectra were acquired and analyzed after each addition of ligand. 15N-PARC-CPH domain was titrated with unlabeled p53-TD. The backbone resonances (1HN, 15N) of the bound form of Cul7- and PARC-CPH domains obtained upon the addition of p53-TD were assigned assuming a minimal change in chemical shifts compared with the unbound forms. 15N-p53-TD chemical shifts were those previously reported (20Tjandra N. Omichinski J.G. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Bax A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 732-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). The weighted chemical shift displacements were calculated using the following formula: Δppm = [(δnh)2 + (δn/5)2]1/2. Given that Cul7 and PARC have high sequence identity in their N-terminal domains and both interact with p53 via their N-terminal domains, we sought to identify a stable domain common to both proteins that would interact with p53. In screening for stable N-terminal domain constructs of Cul7, a protease-resistant fragment (residues 360-460) was identified from limited trypsin digestion (data not shown). Cul7(360-460) contains a CPH domain, named after a homologous sequence found within the Cul7, PARC, and HERC2 proteins (11Kasper J.S. Arai T. Decaprio J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 348: 132-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 26Hochrainer K. Mayer H. Baranyi U. Binder B. Lipp J. Kroismayr R.

Solution Structure of the Cul7-CPH Domain—The solution structure of the Cul7-CPH was determined by heteronuclear multidimensional NMR spectroscopy. The recombinant protein used for the structural studies comprised residues 360-460 of human Cul7. However, only residues 360-440 adopt a well defined tertiary structure. The additional C-terminal residues are disordered as indicated by few 1H NOEs and small heteronuclear {1H}-15N NOE values (data not shown). The protein is monomeric in solution as determined by size exclusion chromatography (see Fig. 4A, peak P3). The structure was determined using 2144 distance constraints and 144 dihedral angle constraints from three-dimensional 15N and 13C-edited NOE spectra and 51 orientational constraints derived from residual dipolar couplings (Fig. 2A and Table 1).TABLE 1Structure calculation statistics of the CUL7-CPH domainNMR restraintsDistance NOE restraints2144Intraresidue850Sequential (|i - j| = 1)510Medium range (1 < |i - j| < 5)246Long range (|i - j| ≥ 5)538Dihedral angle restraints104φ angles52ψ angles52Residual dipolar coupling restraintsH-N51Characteristics of the structure ensembleaEnsemble of 20 lowest energy structures out of 100 calculated.NMR restraints violationsDistance restraints (>0.5 Å)0Bond angles (>5 degrees)0.50 ± 0.67Root mean square deviation from NMR restraintsDistance restraints (Å)0.015 ± 0.001Bond angles (deg.)0.82 ± 0.32Q factor for residual dipolar coupling restraints0.154 ± 0.005Deviation from ideal covalent geometryBond lengths (Å)0.007 ± 0.0001Bond angles (deg.)0.68 ± 0.02Root mean square deviation from mean structurebThe values were calculated for residues 10-78.Backbone atoms0.75 ± 0.17All heavy atoms1.23 ± 0.12Energies (kcal/mol)cEnergy is calculated using the PARALLHDG5.3 parameters set (1).Total−3077 ± 100Van der Waals'−380 ± 22Electrostatic−3616 ± 101Ramachandran plot (%)aEnsemble of 20 lowest energy structures out of 100 calculated.Most favored regions90.6Additionally allowed regions9.4Generously allowed regions0.0Disallowed regions0.0a Ensemble of 20 lowest energy structures out of 100 calculated.b The values were calculated for residues 10-78.c Energy is calculated using the PARALLHDG5.3 parameters set (1Hochstrasser M.

Open table in a new tab The CPH Domain Resembles SH3/Tudor/KOW Domains—The CPH domain has a β-barrel architecture consisting of five antiparallel β-strands, three loops, and an α-helix (Fig. 2B). Strands β1-β2 are connected by a long turn, β2-β3 and β3-β4 are connected by a short turn, whereas strands β4 and β5 are linked by a helical turn. The structure exhibits an overall negatively charged surface. Conserved residues Tyr389 (loop2), Gly406 (loop3), Val407 (loop3), Pro408 (loop3), Pro409 (loop3), Phe413 (β3), Thr420 (β4), and Trp422 (β4) are exposed and form a hydrophobic cluster that may be involved in ligand interactions (Fig. 2C). Other conserved, charged residues Glu391 (β2), Glu399 (β2), Asn404 (loop3), Gln411 (β3), Ser416 (loop4), and Arg419 (β4) could form an additional platform for protein-ligand interaction. A DALI search (www.ebi.ac.uk/dali/) for structurally similar proteins yielded a list of ∼90 proteins with Z score of >2.0. The NusG KOW domain (Protein Data Bank code 1M1G) and the SH3 domain of the kinase p56lck (LCK; Protein Data Bank code 1lck) are the two closest matches (Z = 6.7 and 6.6, respectively), although they lack any significant sequence similarity. The next 17 hits are all SH3 domains; the Tudor domains of SMN (Protein Data Bank code 1g5v) and 53BP1 are found in the 19th and 28th positions (Z = 5.4 and 4.3, respectively). This suggests that the CPH domain may be a protein-protein interaction module, and/or a nucleic acid-binding protein, because the KOW domain of NusG (27Steiner T. Kaiser J.T. Marinkovic S. Huber R. Wahl M.C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4641-4653Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and the Tudor domain of 53BP1 (28Charier G. Couprie J. Alpha-Bazin B. Meyer V. Quemeneur E. Guerois R. Callebaut I. Gilquin B. Zinn-Justin S. Structure. 2004; 12: 1551-1562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) have been implicated in both these activities. The arrangement of β sheets in the CPH domain is almost identical to that found in SH3, Tudor, and KOW domains with backbone root mean square deviations on the order of 1.5 Å (Fig. 3). Nevertheless, there is significant variability in the length and arrangement of the loops that contribute to peptide binding in each domain. For example, the RT-Src loop of SH3 domain (29Eck M.J. Atwell S.K. Shoelson S.E. Harrison S.C. Nature. 1994; 368: 764-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) consists of 17 residues, whereas there are only 11 residues in the corresponding loop of the Cul7-CPH domain. Furthermore, despite the similar fold, all three domains display variety in the location of functional binding sites. Peptide binding by SH3 domains is mediated by a hydrophobic surface that is rich in aromatic residues and by various polar residues located in the RT-Src and N-Src loops (Fig. 3C) (30Larson S.M. Davidson A.R. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 2170-2180Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The Tudor domain of SMN uses loops 1 and 3 to bind to symmetrically dimethylated arginines of RG-rich sequences (Fig. 3D) (31Selenko P. Sprangers R. Stier G. Buhler D. Fischer U. Sattler M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The NusG KOW domain can bind proteins and nucleic acids at the same time via different surfaces (Fig. 3B) (27Steiner T. Kaiser J.T. Marinkovic S. Huber R. Wahl M.C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4641-4653Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Thus, each module uses the same fold in a unique manner to interact with partners, making it difficult to predict a substrate-binding surface for Cul7 from domain comparisons. The CPH Domain Interacts with p53-TD—The N-terminal region of Cul7 has been observed by us and others to be a major p53 binding determinant (6Andrews P. He Y.J. Xiong Y. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 4534-4548Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 11Kasper J.S. Arai T. Decaprio J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 348: 132-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Recently Kasper et al. (11Kasper J.S. Arai T. Decaprio J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 348: 132-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) reported that residues 268-438 of Cul7 were sufficient for association with p53. Residues 331-437 of Cul7 were shown to co-precipitate with p53 (6Andrews P. He Y.J. Xiong Y. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 4534-4548Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 11Kasper J.S. Arai T. Decaprio J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 348: 132-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Because both of these fragments encompass the CPH domain, we further examined whether the latter was responsible for the p53 interaction using size exclusion chromatography and NMR titration experiments. As shown in Fig. 4A, when Cul7-CPH is preincubated with an excess of p53-TD at high protein concentrations (2 mg/ml), Cul7-CPH co-eluted with p53-TD as a Cul7-CPH/p53-TD complex (shown in black). 15N HSQC NMR experiments in which the 15N-Cul7-CPH was titrated with p53-TD revealed chemical shift perturbations for several residues (Fig. 4B). The free and bound forms of the protein are in fast exchange on the NMR time scale, suggesting that the affinity between CPH and p53-TD is likely in the micromolar range. An approximate equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) of the Cul7-CPH/p53-TD complex was determined by least square fitting of the chemical shift changes accompanying ligand binding as a function of the total ligand concentration as described (32Tugarinov V. Kay L.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 1121-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Using chemical shift changes of Tyr389, Gln411, and Gly398 upon the addition of p53-TD, a Kd of ∼530 μm was estimated. This result is in agreement with the gel filtration results where the co-elution of two proteins could only be observed when Cul7-CPH is saturated by p53-TD and proteins are preincubated at high concentrations (0.6 and 1.6 mm for Cul7-CPH and p53-TD, respectively). No interaction was observed when proteins were preincubated at 1:1 molar ratio (Fig. 4A, shown in blue). The central p53-TD peptide-binding region (defined as those residues with weighted chemical shift displacements greater than 0.05 ppm) includes Tyr389, Glu391, Asn404, Gly406, Val407, Gln411, Glu415, Ser416, Arg419, and Thr420 and forms a contiguous surface on the protein (Fig. 4B). In addition, the resonance peak for Trp422 completely disappeared and that of Phe413 was significantly broadened. Other residues surrounding this surface (Gly398, Glu399, Val410, and Val412) also showed chemical shift perturbations (between 0.03 and 0.05 ppm; Fig. 4B). These residues form a cluster between loops 1-3 and strands β2-β4 forming an interface for interaction with p53 (Fig. 4C). Significantly, these residues also encompass the conserved residues Tyr389, Glu391, Gly406, Val410, Gln411, Thr420, and Trp422 (Fig. 1B), suggesting that p53 binds to Cul7-CPH through a conserved surface formed by a combination of hydrophobic negatively charged residues. Oligomeric Forms of p53-TD Residues Are Required for Binding Cul7-CPH—To assess the surface of p53-TD that interacts with Cul7-CPH, 1H-15N HSQC titration experiments were performed on uniformly 15N-labeled samples of wild type p53-TD with increasing amounts of unlabeled Cul7-CPH (Fig. 5A). The observed spectral changes that occurred after the addition of Cul7-CPH are characterized by reductions in resonance intensity of the residues Phe328, Arg335, Arg342, and Asn345. Resonances for residues Gly325, Leu330, Ile332, Arg333, and Gly334 became so weak they can no longer be detected (Fig. 5A). Residues Phe328, Leu330, Ile332, and Arg333 belong to the β-strand and are exposed to the surface of p53. In addition, these residues are hydrophobic (Fig. 5, C and D) and have been proposed to be a potential site for interaction with other proteins (33Wagner P. Fuchs A. Gotz C. Nastainczyk W. Montenarh M. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 34Wagner P. Fuchs A. Prowald A. Montenarh M. Nastainczyk W. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 155-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Residues Gly334 and Arg335 are also surface-exposed, and they belong to the turn that links the α-helices to the β-sheets. An additional, six residues in our p53-TD spectrum had reduced intensities but could not be assigned because of spectral overlap (35Lee W. Harvey T.S. Yin Y. Yau P. Litchfield D. Arrowsmith C.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 877-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Because of the small size of p53-TD (∼30 residues/subunit) and as a result of possible conformational changes in p53-TD, it is likely that residues distinct from the binding surface may also be affected by interaction with Cul7-CPH protein. Furthermore, a 1:1 complex between the symmetric p53 tetramer and the asymmetric Cul7-CPH domain would destroy the symmetry of the p53-TD, further complicating the NMR spectrum of the latter. This may explain why distinct chemical shift changes"

https://openalex.org/W1990110300,"The expression of fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR)-1 correlates with angiogenesis and is associated with prostate cancer (CaP) progression. To more precisely define the molecular mechanisms whereby FGFR1 causes angiogenesis in the prostate we exploited a transgenic mouse model, JOCK-1, in which activation of a conditional FGFR1 allele in the prostate epithelium caused rapid angiogenesis and progressive hyperplasia. By labeling the vasculature in vivo and applying a novel method to measure the vasculature in three dimensions, we were able to observe a significant increase in vascular volume 1 week after FGFR1 activation. Although vessel volume and branching both continued to increase throughout a 6-week period of FGFR1 activation, importantly, we discovered that continued activation of FGFR1 was not required to maintain the new vasculature. Exploring the molecular mediators of the angiogenic phenotype, we observed consistent upregulation of HIF-1α, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and angiopoietin 2 (Ang-2), whereas expression of Ang-1 was lost. Further analysis revealed that loss of Ang-1 expression occurred in the basal epithelium, whereas the increase in Ang-2 expression occurred in the luminal epithelium. Reporter assays confirmed that the Ang-2 promoter was regulated by FGFR1 signaling and a small molecule inhibitor of FGFR activity, PD173074, could abrogate this response. These findings establish a method to follow spontaneous angiogenesis in a conditional autochthonous system, implicate the angiopoietins as downstream effectors of FGFR1 activation in vivo, and suggest that therapies targeting FGFR1 could be used to inhibit neovascularization during initiation and progression of CaP."

https://openalex.org/W2000769711,"We have isolated a novel interferon (IFN)-retinoid regulated cell death regulatory protein genes associated with retinoid-IFN-induced mortality (GRIM)-19 earlier. To understand its mechanism of action, we have employed a yeast-two-hybrid screen and identified serine protease HtrA2 as its binding partner. GRIM-19 physically interacts with HtrA2 and augments cell death in an IFN/all-trans retinoic acid (RA)-dependent manner. In the presence of GRIM-19, the HtrA2-driven destruction of the antiapoptotic protein X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) is augmented. These interactions were disrupted by an human herpes virus-8 (HHV-8)-coded oncoprotein, vIRF1, and conferred resistance to IFN/RA-induced cell death. These data show a critical role of HtrA2 in a cytokine-induced cell death response for the first time and its inhibition by a viral protein."
https://openalex.org/W2103104055,"K-ras mutation occurs in 40–50% of human colorectal adenomas and carcinomas, but its contribution to intestinal tumorigenesis in vivo is unclear. We developed K-rasV12 transgenic mice that were crossed with Ah-Cre mice to generate K-rasV12/Cre mice, which showed β-naphthoflavone-induction of Cre-mediated LoxP recombination that activated intestinal expression of K-rasV12 4A and 4B transcripts and proteins. Only very occasional intestinal adenomas were observed in β-naphthoflavone-treated K-rasV12/Cre mice aged up to 2 years, suggesting that mutated K-ras expression alone does not significantly initiate intestinal tumourigenesis. To investigate the effects of mutated K-ras on DNA mismatch repair (MMR)-deficient intestinal tumour formation, these mice were crossed with Msh2−/− mice to generate K-rasV12/Cre/Msh2−/− offspring. After β-naphthoflavone treatment, K-rasV12/Cre/Msh2−/− mice showed reduced average lifespan of 17.3±5.0 weeks from 26.9±6.8 (control Msh2−/− mice) (P<0.01). They demonstrated increased adenomas in the small intestine from 1.41 (Msh2−/− controls) to 7.75 per mouse (increased fivefold, P<0.01). In the large intestine, very few adenomas were found in Msh2−/− mice (0.13 per mouse) whereas K-rasV12/Cre/Msh2−/− mice produced 2.70 adenomas per mouse (increased 20-fold, P<0.01). Over 80% adenomas from K-rasV12/Cre/Msh2−/− mice showed transgene recombination with expression of K-rasV12 4A and 4B transcripts and proteins. Sequencing of endogenous murine K-ras showed mutations in two out of 10 tumours examined from Msh2−/− mice, but no mutations in 17 tumours from K-rasV12/Cre/Msh2−/− mice. Expression of K-rasV12 in tumours caused activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase and Akt/protein kinase B signaling pathways, demonstrated by phosphorylation of p44MAPK, Akt and GSK3β, as well as transcriptional upregulation of Pem, Tcl-1 and Trap1a genes (known targets of K-rasV12 expression in stem cells). Thus, mutated K-ras cooperates synergistically with MMR deficiency to accelerate intestinal tumorigenesis, particularly in the large intestine."
https://openalex.org/W2074493585,"Human enhancer of invasion, clone 10 (HEI10) (CCNB1IP1) was first described as a RING-finger family ubiquitin ligase that regulates cell cycle by interacting with cyclin B and promoting its degradation. Subsequently, other studies suggested specific upregulation of HEI10 in metastatic melanoma and demonstrated direct interaction between HEI10 and the tumor suppressor Merlin, encoded by the neurofibromatosis 2 gene. These and other results led us to hypothesize that HEI10 also influences the processes of cell migration and metastasis. We here show that cells with depleted HEI10 both migrate more rapidly and invade more effectively than control cells. HEI10 depletion post-transcriptionally increases the expression of a group of promotility regulatory proteins including p130Cas, paxillin, Cdk1 and cyclin B2, but excluding Merlin. Among these, only inhibition of Cdk1/cyclin B activity specifically reversed the motility and invasion of HEI10-depleted cells. Finally, HEI10 is abundantly transcribed in many human tissues, and particularly abundant in some tumor cell lines, suggesting that it may be commonly involved in coordinating cell cycle with cell migration and invasion."
https://openalex.org/W2022403513,"Human LZIP is a transcription factor that is involved in leukocyte cell mobility. Expression of LZIP is known to differentially regulate monocyte cell migration induced by CCR1-dependent chemokines. However, its transcriptional regulation has not been characterized. Our results indicate that Lkn-1 induces LZIP expression in a time- and dose-dependent manner, and the induction of LZIP shows an immediate early response to Lkn-1. We identified and cloned ∼1.4 kb of the LZIP promoter from a human genomic DNA. To identify regulatory elements controlling restricted expression of LZIP, deletion mutants were constructed from the 1469-bp LZIP promoter region (–1219/+251) linked to the luciferase reporter gene. Maximal promoter activity was contained within 613 bp from the tentative transcription initiation site and was sharply reduced in a truncated construct (–338/+251). This promoter sequence contained consensus NF-κB- and Sp-1-binding sites. Results from an inhibitor assay showed that NF-κB is involved in Lkn-1-induced LZIP expression, but Sp-1 is not. We also demonstrated that NF-κB binds to the LZIP promoter and that the binding is specific, as revealed by an electrophoretic mobility shift assay and a mutation analysis. Chemotaxis analysis showed that LZIP expression because of the NF-κB subfamily is specifically involved in Lkn-1-induced chemotaxis.

We have recently reported that LZIP associates with CC chemokine receptor 1 (CCR1) and up-regulates leukotactin-1 (Lkn-1)-induced chemotactic activity, indicating that LZIP functions as a positive regulator in leukocyte cell migration induced by chemokines (5Ko J.

However, the exact biological roles and the natural target genes of LZIP remain to be characterized. The human LZIP gene is located on chromosome 9p and consists of nine exons and eight introns. Sequence analysis of the 5′-flanking region of the LZIP gene has revealed that LZIP promoter has potential binding sites for transcription factors involved in inflammatory processes and regulation of the immune system, including nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), nuclear factor of activated T-cells, specific protein-1 (Sp-1), and activator protein-2 (AP-2) (6Oyama N.

However, the regulatory mechanism of the transcriptional activation of LZIP is still obscure. Chemokines are a large family of chemotactic cytokines that provide key signals for trafficking and homing of specific subpopulations of leukocytes and other cells in both physiological and pathological processes (7Baggiolini M.

Lkn-1 induces chemotaxis through Gi/Go protein, phospholipase C (PLC), protein kinase C δ (PKCδ), and NF-κB, and newly synthesized proteins are required for Lkn-1-induced chemotaxis (12Ko J. Kim I.S. Jang S.-W. Lee Y.H. Shin S.Y. Min D.S. Na D.S. FEBS Lett. 2002; 515: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Because LZIP is involved in Lkn-1-induced chemotaxis, we characterized the regulatory mechanism of LZIP expression in response to CCR1-dependent chemokines by analyzing the promoter region of LZIP. We cloned the human LZIP promoter and defined its core sequences. We showed that the NF-κB-binding site in 613 bp of the LZIP core promoter region is important for LZIP expression in response to Lkn-1, and that NF-κB is a specific modulator of Lkn-1-induced LZIP expression. Materials—Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), RPMI 1640 medium, and fetal bovine serum (FBS) were purchased from Invitrogen. Lkn-1, human macrophage inflammatory protein (hMIP)-1α, regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES), HCC-4, and eotaxin were obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Rat tail collagen type I was a product of Sigma. Anti-p65 and anti-p50 antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Rabbit polyclonal anti-LZIP antibody was raised against an N-terminal peptide (amino acids 2–29) conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. SN50 and WP631 were obtained from Calbiochem. Cell Culture—Stable human osteogenic sarcoma cells expressing CCR1 (HOS/CCR1) (12Ko J. Kim I.S. Jang S.-W. Lee Y.H. Shin S.Y. Min D.S. Na D.S. FEBS Lett. 2002; 515: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and puromycin (0.5 μg/ml). HeLa and HEK 293 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). THP-1 and U937 cells were grown in RPMI with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Western Blot Analysis—Cells were lysed in 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, and protease inhibitors. Protein samples (30 μg of each lane) were separated by a 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose filters. The blots were incubated with anti-LZIP antibody and developed with the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Promoter Cloning and Plasmid Constructions—Genomic DNA was isolated from human blood. Genomic DNA was extracted from 3 ml of EDTA-peripheral blood leukocytes (13Miller S.A. Dykes D.D. Polesky H.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 161215 Crossref PubMed Scopus (17908) Google Scholar). A 1469-bp fragment of human LZIP promoter was generated by a GeneAmp PCR system thermocycler (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with human genomic DNA as a template. This approach used a forward primer from the 5′-upstream genomic sequence with an XhoI site (5′-CTCGAGCTGATTCCTGTTGTTTGTTGACCCTTAACC-3′) and a reverse primer from the downstream initiator methionine codon with a HindIII site (5′-AAGCTTAATCATCTACTTCCCAGTCGCTCGGTACCT-3′). This fragment was cloned into T-vector and pGL3 basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI) located upstream of the luciferase reporter gene. The construct was named p-1219-luc. A series of 5′-deleted constructs were prepared using PCR-amplified T-vector containing the –1219-bp fragment with forward primers containing XhoI (for –1002 construct, 5′-CTCGAGAAGCTTTCCTACCCACATGCCCGC/5′-AAGCTTAATCATCTACTTCCCAGTCGCTCGGTACCT; for –888 construct, 5′-CTCGAGGCTCCCCAAAGCCTATCCCAGACA/5′-AAGCTTAATCATCTACTTCCCAGTCGCTCGGTACCT; for –613 construct, 5′-CTCGAGCCTTCGACACTCTCTCGGCCACTT/5′-AAGCTTAATCATCTACTTCCCAGTCGCTCGGTACCT; for –338 construct, 5′-CTCGAGGGAACCCCCGCCCTCGGGGTGCGA/5′-AAGCTTAATCATCTACTTCCCAGTCGCTCGGTACCT; for –173 construct, 5′-CTCGAGGGAGAATTGAGCCTGGGAGGCGGG/5′-AAGCTTAATCATCTACTTCCCAGTCGCTCGGTACCT; and for –97 construct, 5′-CTCGAGAGTGGATAGGTGCCCGAGGCCTAC/5′-AAGCTTAATCATCTACTTCCCAGTCGCTCGGTACCT). The amplimers were digested by XhoI/HindIII and subcloned into the pGL3 basic vector. Mutations were introduced into the putative NF-κB site in p-613 using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Mutagenic primers were as follows: wild type, 5′-CGTCGTCCTGGGAACGTCCCCCACCCG-3′, and mutation, 5′-CGTCGTCCTGGCTACGTGGCCCACCCG-3′ (mutations are indicated in boldface). For cotransfection analysis, the human NF-κB p65 and p50 cDNA were cloned into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). All constructs were confirmed by sequence analysis. Transient Transfection—HOS/CCR1 cells were plated at a density of ∼4 × 105 cells/well in a 6-well plate. After 18–24 h, cells were cotransfected with 1 μg of reporter gene plasmid and 500 ng of pGL3 basic control plasmid using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). THP-1 cells were transfected in a 6-well plate by Lipofectamine according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). After 24 h of transfection, cells were grown in the same medium supplemented with 0.5% FBS for 24 h. Serum-starved cells were used for the assay. Luciferase Reporter Gene Activity Assay—Luciferase assays were performed using the luciferase assay system (Promega). Briefly, the transfected cells were lysed in the culture dishes with reporter lysis buffer, and the lysates were centrifuged at maximum speed for 10 min in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge. Ten μl of the supernatant fraction were incubated with 50 μl of luciferase substrate, and the relative luciferase activity was determined with a Luminoskan Ascent (Thermo Labsystems Oy, Helsinki, Finland). Luciferase activity was normalized with β-galactosidase activity. All data are presented as the mean ± S.D. of at least three independent experiments. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Nuclear extracts were prepared from confluent flasks of Lkn-1-treated or -untreated THP-1 cells. The oligonucleotides corresponding to seven potential transcription factor binding sites on the hLZIP promoter were as follows: NF-κB-581 (underlined, 5′-CGTCCTGGGAACGTCCCCCACC-3′), NF-κB-304 (5′-GGCAGCAGGGCCGTCCCCTACA-3′), Sp-1–564 (5′-ACCCGCGGGCGGCGCCCTG-3′), Sp-1–528 (5′-CGGGGGGCAGGCAG-3′), Sp-1–454 (5′-CAGCCCCTCCCTGGC-3′), Sp-1–357 (5′-AGAAGGCGGAGCC-3′), Sp-1–315 (5′-GCGAGGCGGCAGC-3′), and mut-NF-κB(5′-CGTCCTGGCTACGTGGCCCACC-3′). The oligonucleotides were 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega). Unincorporated nucleotides were removed by passage over a BioGel P-6 spin column (Bio-Rad) as described by the manufacturer's instructions. Nuclear extracts (5 μg of total protein) were incubated with radiolabeled probe for 20 min at room temperature, and protein-DNA complexes were separated from free probe by electrophoresis on a 4% native polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA (TBE). DNA binding buffer contained 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 4% glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 μg/ml poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC). Gels were pre-electrophoresed in 0.5× TBE for 30 min prior to loading, and electrophoresis continued for ∼3 h until the bromphenol blue dye approached the bottom of the gel. Dried gels were visualized by autoradiography. In competition experiments, binding reactions were incubated with 10-fold molar excess of unlabeled NF-κB binding oligonucleotides for 20 min before addition of the radiolabeled oligonucleotides. For supershift assays, the antibodies were added to the reaction mixture for an additional 30 min. After incubation, the reaction mixture was then separated by electrophoresis through a 4% native polyacrylamide gel, and the results were recorded by autoradiography. Confocal Microscopy—THP-1 cells transiently transfected with pcDNA-p65 and pcDNA-p50 were grown on coverslips. After 36 h, cytospin preparations were obtained on superfrost slides by centrifugation for 5 min. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with monoclonal anti-p65, anti-p50, and polyclonal anti-LZIP antibodies for 1 h. Cells were then washed and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse and TRITC-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies for 30 min. Cover slides were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, mounted, and examined using a Leica TCS SP2 confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar GmBH, Germany). Chemotaxis Assay—Migration of cells was monitored using a 48-well microchamber (Neuro Probe Inc., Cabin John, MD) as described previously (12Ko J. Kim I.S. Jang S.-W. Lee Y.H. Shin S.Y. Min D.S. Na D.S. FEBS Lett. 2002; 515: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Briefly, the lower wells were filled with 28 μl of buffer alone or with buffer containing Lkn-1, and the upper wells were filled with 50 μl of THP-1 cells at 1 × 106 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 medium containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 30 mm HEPES. The two compartments were separated by a polyvinylpyrrolidone-free filter (Neuro Probe Inc.) with 5-μm pores that was precoated with RPMI 1640 medium containing rat tail collagen type I at 4 °C overnight. After incubation for 6 h at 37 °C, the filters were removed from the chamber, washed, fixed, and stained with Diff-Quick (Baxter, Deerfield, IL). The cells of two randomly selected oil-immersed fields were counted using Axiovert 25 (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) and Visus Image Analysis System (Foresthill Products, Foresthill, CA). The chemotactic index was calculated from the number of cells that migrated to the control. Significant chemotaxis was defined as chemotactic index >2. LZIP Is Induced by CCR1-dependent Chemokines in THP-1 and HOS/CCR1 Cells—It is known that LZIP is ubiquitously expressed in most tissues (1Lu R. Yang P. O'Hare P. Misra V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5117-5126Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). We examined the basal expression level of LZIP in different human cell lines. Western blotting data indicated that all cells tested showed LZIP expression (Fig. 1, A and B). Low levels of LZIP expression were observed in U937, HOS/CCR1, and HEK 293 cells, whereas THP-1 monocyte cells showed a high level of LZIP expression (Fig. 1, A and B). Therefore, we used THP-1 monocyte cells to analyze inhibitory and CC chemokine effects and HOS/CCR1 cells to analyze CCR1 ligand stimulatory effects. Because chemokines play important roles in diverse biochemical and physiological events, including directed migration, activation of immunity, and hematopoiesis of leukocytes (7Baggiolini M. Dewald B. Moser B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 675-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (1987) Google Scholar, 8Rollins B.J. Blood. 1997; 90: 909-928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we examined whether LZIP expression is affected by various CC chemokines in THP-1 and HOS/CCR1 cells. Serum-starved THP-1 and HOS/CCR1 cells were treated with and without 100 ng/ml of Lkn-1, MIP-1α, RANTES, and HCC-4. All CCR1-dependent chemokines induced LZIP expression by ∼2.5–6-fold in THP-1 and HOS/CCR1 cells (Fig. 2, A and C). We also examined the effects of pro-inflammatory cytokines and growth factors in LZIP expression. However, these stimulators did not affect expression of LZIP (data not shown).FIGURE 2LZIP is induced by CCR1-dependent chemokines in THP-1 and HOS/CCR1 cells. A and C, THP-1 (A) and HOS/CCR1 cells (C) were incubated for 6 h with or without 100 ng/ml Lkn-1, MIP-1α, RANTES, and HCC-4. Cell lysates were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (30 μg/lane) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The LZIP level was detected by Western blotting with anti-LZIP antibody. The membranes were stripped and reprobed with anti-β-actin antibody. β-Actin was used as an internal control. B and D, densitometric analysis was performed using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). The data are expressed as the mean ± S.D. and presented as percent amount of LZIP (the protein level of LZIP in control cells is set to 100%). The data represent three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Lkn-1 Induces LZIP in a Time- and Dose-dependent Manner—We next investigated the time and dose dependence of Lkn-1 on LZIP expression in HOS/CCR1 cells. Serum-starved HOS/CCR1 cells were treated with 1–500 ng/ml of Lkn-1, and the expression level of LZIP was determined by Western blotting. Lkn-1 induced LZIP expression in a dose-dependent manner with a maximum induction at 100 ng/ml (Fig. 3A), indicating that Lkn-1 induces LZIP expression at the same concentration as the maximum chemotactic activity (5Ko J. Jang S.-W. Kim Y.S. Kim I.S. Sung H.J. Kim H.H. Park J.Y. Lee Y.H. Kim J. Na D.S. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 890-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We also treated HOS/CCR1 cells with 100 ng/ml of Lkn-1 for different times, and the LZIP level was determined. The level of LZIP was increased in a time-dependent manner with the maximum increase at 15 min in response to Lkn-1 (Fig. 3C), indicating that LZIP shows an immediate early response to Lkn-1. LZIP expression decreased after 15 min and showed a second peak expression at 4 h, indicating that Lkn-1 induces LZIP in a biphasic manner. Deletion Analysis of LZIP Promoter Activity—To investigate the regulatory mechanism of LZIP expression in response to Lkn-1, the 1469-bp genomic fragment containing exon 1 was cloned from a human genomic DNA. From this construction, a cloned fragment of 1469 bp, limited by XhoI and HindIII, was fully sequenced (Fig. 4). The 5′-flanking sequence of human LZIP was then analyzed using Transcription Element Search System (TESS) data base software. The proximal fragment of 613 bp contained two consensus sequences for NF-κB and four consensus sequences for Sp-1. To examine the transcriptional promoter activity, multiple constructions containing different lengths of the 5′-flanking region coupled to the firefly luciferase reporter gene were generated (Fig. 5A). The constructs containing different lengths of the LZIP promoter were transiently transfected into HOS/CCR1 cells, and the effects of Lkn-1 were examined. All the deletion promoter constructs showed increased luciferase activities in response to 100 ng/ml Lkn-1, compared with the pGL3 control construct (Fig. 5B). However, significant enhancement was observed between the constructs at –338 and –613 bp. These fragments contained five consensus sequences (Fig. 4).FIGURE 5Deletion analysis of LZIP promoter activity. A, serial deletion constructs of the 5′-flanking region of the human LZIP gene were coupled to the luciferase gene (LUC) in the reporter plasmid pGL3 basic. Underlined numbers indicate the length of the construct, starting from the transcriptional initiation site. The restriction endonucleases used to generate the series of deletion are indicated. The positions of transcription factor binding sites are shown. B, indicated luciferase constructs were transfected into HOS/CCR1 cells. Cells were serum-starved for 24 h prior to induction of protein expression with 100 ng/ml Lkn-1 for 6 h. Cell extracts were assayed for luciferase activity and determined as relative luciferase activity. Activity values are relative to the pGL3 basic plasmid. Luciferase activity was normalized with β-galactosidase activity. The data are presented as the mean ± S.D. for three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) NF-κB Binding Is Necessary for LZIP Expression in THP-1 Cells—Because NF-κB- and Sp-1-binding sites are involved in LZIP promoter activity, we examined whether the transcription factors NF-κB and Sp-1 induce LZIP protein expression. The selective Sp-1 inhibitor bisanthracycline (WP631) (14Martin B. Vaquero A. Priebe W. Portugal J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3402-3409Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 15Bontemps Y. Vuillermoz B. Antonicelli F. Perreau C. Danan J.L. Maquart F.X. Wegrowski Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21566-21575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and the NF-κB peptide inhibitor SN50 were used to analyze involvement of these transcription factors. The basal LZIP expression level was not affected by treatment with 1 μm WP631, whereas SN50 slightly decreased the LZIP level (Fig. 6, A and B). Lkn-1 increased LZIP expression 4-fold, compared with control cells. However, SN50 completely abolished LZIP induction in response to Lkn-1 (Fig. 6, A and B). WP-631 did not affect Lkn-1-induced LZIP expression (Fig. 6, A and B). These results indicate that Lkn-1-induced LZIP expression is because of activation of NF-κB. NF-κB Binds to the LZIP Promoter—To evaluate the DNA binding activity of NF-κBtothe LZIP promoter in response to Lkn-1, we performed an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) using a 32P-labeled NF-κB DNA binding sequence in the LZIP promoter (–589 to –568) as a probe. THP-1 cells were treated with 100 ng/ml Lkn-1 for different times. Results showed that the DNA binding activity of NF-κBtothe LZIP promoter increased in a time-dependent manner, and maximum NF-κB activation was observed at 60 min (Fig. 7A). To determine the specificity of NF-κB binding activity, nuclear extracts at 60 min were incubated with the labeled NF-κB binding probe in the absence and presence of either a 10-fold molar excess of unlabeled NF-κB binding probe or a mutant probe. Results from competition experiments showed that the NF-κB binding complex competed with the unlabeled NF-κB binding probe but not with mutant NF-κB binding probe (Fig. 7B), indicating that NF-κB binding activity is specific. NF-κB is a family of dimeric transcription factors, and various combinations of the Rel/NF-κB protein constitute an active NF-κB heterodimer that binds to a specific sequence of DNA (16Phelps C.B. Sengchanthalangsy L.L. Malek S. Ghosh G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24392-24399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). We confirmed the authenticity of the NF-κB band using supershift EMSA by incubation of nuclear extracts with antibodies against either the p50 (NF-κB1) or the p65 (RelA) subunit. Fig. 7C shows that the p50 and p65 subunits of NF-κB were supershifted, indicating that the band represented a p65/p50 heterodimer. We also examined the effects of WP631 and SN50 on Lkn-1-induced NF-κB DNA binding. The DNA binding activity of NF-κB was not affected by treatment with WP631, whereas SN50 inhibited Lkn-1-induced DNA binding of NF-κB (Fig. 7D). These data indicate that NF-κB binds to the LZIP promoter and that the DNA binding activity increases in response to Lkn-1. NF-κB Subunits Increase the Transcriptional Activation of LZIP—NF-κB transcription factors are protein dimers of several possible subunits, including p65, p50, p52, RelB, and c-Rel (17Mathew S. Murty V.V. Dalla-Favera R. Chaganti R.S. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 191-193PubMed Google Scholar, 18Ghosh S. May M. Kopp E. Annu. Rev.

These proteins dimerize to form heterodimers or homodimers, depending on the combination, and may act as transcriptional activators or repressors (21Plaksin D. Baeuerle P.A. Eisenbach L. J. Exp.

Biochem. 2000; 76: 437-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To investigate the regulatory mechanism of NF-κB in transcriptional activation of LZIP, we cloned the p65 and the p50 genes into pcDNA3.1. These plasmids were transfected into THP-1 cells, and LZIP expression was determined using confocal microscopy. As shown in Fig. 8A, p65 increased the LZIP expression level, whereas p50 had little effect on LZIP expression. THP-1 cells cotransfected with both p65 and p50 showed an increased LZIP expression level (Fig. 8A). These results suggest that the p65 homodimer and/or the p65/p50 heterodimer enhances LZIP protein expression, whereas the p50 homodimer does not. We also cotransfected p65 and/or p50 plasmids with the reporter construct containing the p-613 and/or p-338 promoter segment into THP-1 cells, and the luciferase activity was determined. THP-1 cells cotransfected with the reporter gene and the p65 plasmid showed increased transcriptional activity of the p-613 promoter by ∼4-fold, whereas cells cotransfected with the reporter gene and p50 showed no effect. Furthermore, cotransfection of both p65 and p50 also increased LZIP promoter activity, but to a lesser extent than p65 alone (Fig. 8B). These results indicate that the p65 homodimer and/or the p65/p50 heterodimer probably induce LZIP expression. Mutation Analysis of LZIP Promoter Activity—To determine whether NF-κB DNA binding is required for LZIP expression, the NF-κB consensus sequence in the LZIP promoter was mutated, and the luciferase activity was determined (Fig. 9A). This mutation resulted in a significant decrease in the basal luciferase activity compared with the wild-type LZIP promoter (Fig. 9B). THP-1 cells cotransfected with the mutated reporter gene and p65 failed to induce luciferase activity (Fig. 9B). Lkn-1 induced LZIP promoter activity in cells transfected with the wild-type NF-κB binding sequence by ∼6.5-fold, compared with cells transfected with the mock vector (Fig. 9B). However, cells transfected with the mutated NF-κB reporter increased LZIP promoter activity 1.8-fold in response to Lkn-1 (Fig. 9B). These data are consistent with previous results showing that THP-1 cells carrying the wild-type LZIP promoter increased luciferase activity 4–6.5"
https://openalex.org/W2047517591,"Aminoflavone (AF, NSC 686288) is beginning clinical trials. It induces replication-mediated histone H2AX phosphorylation, DNA–protein crosslinks and activates p53. Here, we studied p21CIP1/WAF1 and Mdm2 responses to AF. Although p53 stabilization and phosphorylation at serine 15 increased with dose and time of exposure, Mdm2 and p21CIP1/WAF1 protein levels displayed a biphasic response, as they accumulated at submicromolar doses and then decreased with increasing AF. As both Mdm2 and p21CIP1/WAF1 mRNA levels increased with AF concentration without reduction at higher concentrations, we measured the half-lives of Mdm2 and p21CIP1/WAF1 proteins. Mdm2 and p21CIP1/WAF1 half-lives were shortened with increasing AF concentrations. Proteasomal degradation appears responsible for the decrease of both Mdm2 and p21CIP1/WAF1, as MG-132 prevented their degradation and revealed AF-induced Mdm2 polyubiquitylation. AF also induced protein kinase B (Akt) activation, which was reduced with increasing AF concentrations. Suppression of Akt by small interfering RNA was associated with downregulation of Mdm2 and p21CIP1/WAF1 and with enhanced apoptosis. These results suggest that the cellular responses to AF are determined at least in part by Mdm2 and p21CIP1/WAF1 protein levels, as well as by Akt activity, leading either to cell cycle arrest when Mdm2 and p21CIP1/WAF1 are elevated, or to apoptosis when Mdm2 and p21CIP1/WAF1 are degraded by the proteasome and Akt insufficiently activated to protect against apoptosis."

https://openalex.org/W2015550902,"CDX2 is a Drosophila caudal-related homeobox transcription factor that is important for the establishment and maintenance of intestinal epithelial cells. We have reported that CDX2 promotes tumorigenicity in a subset of human colorectal cancer cell lines. Here, we present evidence that CDX2 negatively regulates the well-documented growth inhibitor insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3). Specifically, CDX2 binds to the IGFBP-3 gene promoter and can repress IGFBP-3 transcription, protein expression and secretion. Furthermore, inhibition of IGFBP-3 partially rescues the decreased anchorage-independent growth phenotype observed in CDX2 knockout cells. These data demonstrate for the first time that (1) CDX2 can function as a transcriptional repressor, and (2) one mechanism by which CDX2 promotes anchorage-independent growth is by transcriptional repression of IGFBP-3."
https://openalex.org/W2089828876,"Thymidylate synthase (TS) is an essential enzyme for DNA synthesis and repair and elevated levels of TS have been identified as an important prognostic biomarker for colorectal cancer and several other common human malignancies. In addition, TS gene expression has been linked with cell-cycle regulation and cell proliferation through the ability of retinoblastoma protein to repress the transcriptional activation of E2F target genes such as TS. Therefore, overproduction of TS could participate in the progression to a neoplastic phenotype. Consistent with this model, a recent study has suggested that ectopic TS expression can induce a transformed phenotype in mammalian cells. To investigate the role of deregulated TS activity in tumor development, we generated transgenic mice that express high levels of catalytically active human TS (hTS) exclusively in the pancreas and low levels of hTS in multiple other tissues. Analyses of pancreatic tissue in TS transgenic mice revealed abnormalities within the endocrine pancreas, ranging from pancreatic islet hyperplasia to the detection of islet cell tumors. Overexpression of hTS in murine islets provides a new model to study genetic alterations associated with the progression from normal cells to hyperplasia to islet cell tumors, and suggests that this mouse model may be useful for regulating TS activity in vivo for development of cancer prevention and new therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2092019611,"Loss of JunB has been observed in human leukemia and lymphoma, but it remains unknown, whether this loss is relevant to disease progression. Here, we investigated the consequences of JunB deficiency using Abelson-induced B-lymphoid leukemia as a model system. Mice deficient in JunB expression succumbed to Abelson-induced leukemia with increased incidence and significantly reduced latency. Similarly, bcr/abl p185-transformed JunB-deficient (junBΔ/Δ) cells induced leukemia in RAG2−/− mice displaying a more malignant phenotype. These observations indicated that cell intrinsic effects within the junBΔ/Δ tumor cells accounted for the accelerated leukemia development. Indeed, explantated bcr/abl p185 transformed junBΔ/Δ cells proliferated faster than the control cells. The proliferative advantage emerged slowly after the initial transformation process and was associated with increased expression levels of the cell cycle kinase cdk6 and with decreased levels of the cell cycle inhibitor p16INK4a. These alterations were due to irreversible reprogramming of the cell, because – once established – accelerated disease induced by junBΔ/Δ cells was not reverted by re-introducing JunB. Consistent with this observation, we found that the p16 promoter was methylated. Thus, JunB functions as a gatekeeper during tumor evolution. In its absence, transformed leukemic cells acquire an enhanced proliferative capacity, which presages a more malignant disease."

https://openalex.org/W1993631184,"The INK4a/ARF locus, encoding two tumor suppressor proteins, p16INK4a and p14ARF (ARF), plays key roles in many cellular processes including cell proliferation, apoptosis, cellular senescence and differentiation. Inactivation of INK4a/ARF is one of the most frequent events during human cancer development. Although p16INK4a is a critical component in retinoblastoma protein (Rb)-mediated growth regulatory pathway, p14ARF plays a pivotal role in the activation of p53 upon oncogenic stress signals. A body of evidence indicates that ARF also possesses growth suppression functions independent of p53, the mechanism of which is not well understood. We have recently shown that MDM2 interacts with Rb and promotes proteasome-dependent Rb degradation. In this study, we show that ARF disrupts MDM2–Rb interaction resulting in Rb accumulation. Wild-type ARF, but not ARF mutant defective in MDM2 interaction, stabilizes Rb and inhibits colony foci formation independent of p53. In addition, ablation of Rb impairs ARF function in growth suppression. Thus, this study demonstrates that ARF plays a direct role in regulation of Rb and suggests that inactivation of ARF may lead to defects in both p53 and Rb pathways in human cancer development."

This is correlated with an increased expression of the angiogenic factor vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in these tumors, which is in part caused by elevated expression of the HIF-1 hypoxia inducible transcription factors. We created malignant astrocytes with genetic deletions of the VHL gene and implanted them in subcutaneous and intracranial sites; these sites are respectively vessel poor and vessel-rich tissues. When grown in a vessel poor site, VEGF expression in VHL null cells was important for both vascularization and tumor growth. However, when the same cells are grown in the vessel-rich intracranial environment, loss of VEGF expression reduces vascularization, but does not affect tumor growth. This indicates that antiangiogenic therapies for tumors that express high levels of angiogenic factors such as VEGF may vary in their efficacy, with potentially lowered effectiveness in sites, such as the brain, that are inherently vessel rich."
