https://openalex.org/W2001628772,"We have identified a new mammalian protein arginine N-methyltransferase, PRMT5, formerly designated Janus kinase-binding protein 1, that can catalyze the formation of ω-N G-monomethylarginine and symmetric ω-N G,N G′-dimethylarginine in a variety of proteins. A hemagglutinin peptide-tagged PRMT5 complex purified from human HeLa cells catalyzes theS-adenosyl-l-[methyl- 3H]methionine-dependentin vitro methylation of myelin basic protein. When the radiolabeled myelin basic protein was acid-hydrolyzed to free amino acids, and the products were separated by high-resolution cation exchange chromatography, we were able to detect two tritiated species. One species co-migrated with a ω-N G-monomethylarginine standard, and the other co-chromatographed with a symmetric ω-N G,N G′-dimethylarginine standard. Upon base treatment, this second species formed methylamine, a breakdown product characteristic of symmetric ω-N G,N G′-dimethylarginine. Further analysis of these two species by thin layer chromatography confirmed their identification as ω-N G-monomethylarginine and symmetric ω-N G,N G′-dimethylarginine. The hemagglutinin-PRMT5 complex was also able to monomethylate and symmetrically dimethylate bovine histone H2A and a glutathioneS-transferase-fibrillarin (amino acids 1–148) fusion protein (glutathione S-transferase-GAR). A mutation introduced into theS-adenosyl-l-methionine-binding motif I of amyc-tagged PRMT5 construct in COS-1 cells led to a near complete loss of observed enzymatic activity. PRMT5 is the first example of a catalytic chain for a type II protein arginineN-methyltransferase that can result in the formation of symmetric dimethylarginine residues as observed previously in myelin basic protein, Sm small nuclear ribonucleoproteins, and other polypeptides.

It is an apparently irreversible modification in which the guanidinium group of arginyl residues becomes methylated in a reaction with S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet)1 as the methyl donor. Four different types of protein arginine methyltransferase enzymes have been discovered to date. Type I enzymes methylate arginine residues to form ω-N G-monomethylarginine residues and asymmetric ω-N G,N G-dimethylarginine residues; type II enzymes catalyze the formation of ω-N G-monomethylarginine residues and symmetric ω-N G,N G′-dimethylarginine residues; type III enzymes catalyze the formation of only ω-N G-monomethylarginine residues; and type IV enzymes catalyze the formation of δ-N G-monomethylarginine (for a review, see Ref.6Gary J.D. Clarke S. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 61: 65-130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Genes encoding enzymes responsible for type I methylation, such as the human PRMT1 and PRMT3 and yeastRMT1, and for type IV methylation, such as yeastRMT2, have already been identified (7Lin W.J.

However, genes encoding species that are capable of the type II or type III methylation have yet to be reported. The type II enzyme activity has been of much interest because it monomethylates and symmetrically dimethylates myelin basic protein (MBP) at arginine 107 in mammalian species (11Brostoff S. Eylar E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 765-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 12Baldwin G.S. Carnegie P.R.

MBP is a highly conserved protein occurring as a single species in humans and cattle and as several different isoforms in rodents (for reviews, see Refs. 13Kim S. Chanderkar L.P. Ghosh S.K. Paik W.K. Kim S. Protein Methylation. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1990: 77-95Google Scholarand 14Stoner G.L. J. Neurochem. 1984; 43: 433-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). MBP is a major myelin protein constituting 30% of the total membrane-associated protein (15Eylar E.H. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1972; 195: 481-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The ratio of unmethylated arginine to ω-N G-monomethylarginine to symmetric ω-N G ,N G′-dimethylarginine at position 107 varies from species to species, and it has been postulated that older myelin is more highly methylated (16Aspillaga M.O. McDermott J.R. J. Neurochem. 1977; 28: 1147-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Methylation of MBP has been implicated in maintaining the integrity of the myelin sheath. Subacute combined degeneration, a disorder characterized by the degeneration of the myelin sheath, can be induced in mice and monkeys when methylation of MBP is inhibited by exposure to an atmosphere containing 15% nitrous oxide (17Dinn J.J. Weir D.G. McCann S. Reed B. Wilson P. Scott J.M. Ir. J. Med. Sci. 1980; 149: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 18Scott J.M. Wilson P. Din J.J. Weir D.G. Lancet. 1981; 2: 334-337Abstract PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Until recently, symmetric dimethylarginine residues have been reported to be found only in myelin basic protein. However, two human Sm small nuclear ribonucleoproteins, D1 and D3, involved in mRNA splicing have recently been discovered to contain both ω-N G-monomethylarginine and symmetric ω-N G ,N G′-dimethylarginine residues in their C-terminal domains (19Brahms H. Raymuckers J. Union A. Keyser F. Meheus L. Luhrmann R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17122-17129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). We have recently found that purified D1 and D3 are methylated in vitro by PRMT5. 2J.-H. Lee, J. R. Cook, S. Gunderson, and S. Pestka, unpublished data. Although the role of methylation of these two proteins has yet to be determined, the methylation of D1 forms a major linear epitope for anti-Sm autoantibodies, which are found in people with systemic lupus erythematosus (19Brahms H. Raymuckers J. Union A. Keyser F. Meheus L. Luhrmann R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17122-17129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). In a yeast two-hybrid screen to search for proteins that bind the second polypeptide chain of Janus kinase 2, a protein arginine methyltransferase was identified as Janus kinase-binding protein 1 (JBP1) and shown to catalyze the methylation of MBP and histones H4 and H2A in vitro (20Pollack B.P.

Chem. 1999; 274: 31531-31542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), as does its yeast homologue Hsl7p (21Lee J.-H. Cook J.R. Pollack B.P. Kinzy T.G. Norris D. Pestka S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 274: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, the type of methylation of these proteins was not established, although JBP1 showed amino acid sequence similarity to the family of previously identified type I protein arginine methyltransferase catalytic subunits (20Pollack B.P.

Recent evidence has been presented that the methyl-accepting substrates are in fact protein arginine residues; however, whether the enzyme catalyzes a type I or type II reaction was not determined (22Rho J. Choi S. Seong Y.R. Cho W.K. Kim S.H. Im D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276 (; Erratum (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 16592): 11393-11401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Here we provide evidence that JBP1 can catalyze the formation of ω-N G-monomethylarginine and symmetric ω-N G ,N G′-dimethylarginine on a variety of substrates in vitro. Therefore, JBP1, now designated PRMT5, represents the first gene encoding a type II protein arginine N-methyltransferase. This PRMT5 polypeptide is a candidate catalytic unit that may be responsible for the modification of myelin basic protein in vivo, the Sm ribonucleoproteins, and additional proteins that require the presence of symmetric dimethylarginine residues. A GST-human fibrillarin (residues 1–148) fusion protein (designated GST-GAR) (8Tang J. Gary J.D. Clarke S. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16935-16945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) was overexpressed inEscherichia coli DH5α cells (Life Technologies, Inc.) by induction with a final concentration of 0.4 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The protein was then purified from extracts by binding to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions, but in the presence of 100 µmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and eluted with 30 mmglutathione, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 120 mmNaCl, and 2% glycerol. The protein was then desalted on a Sephadex G-25 gel filtration column (13.5-cm column height × 2.5-cm inner diameter; 60-ml bed volume) in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5. Wild type myc-PRMT5 was cloned as described previously (20Pollack B.P. Kotenko S.V. He W. Izotova L.S. Barnoski B.L. Pestka S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31531-31542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The mutant myc-PRMT5ΔGAGRG (amino acids 365–369) was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis with phage M13 (23Norrander J. Kempe T. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1983; 26: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (1535) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide used to introduce the deletion was 5′-CTGATGGTGCTGCCCCTGGTGAACGCTTCCC-3′. HA-JBP1 (PRMT5) was immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody from the HeLa-HA-SPMT cell line as described previously (20Pollack B.P. Kotenko S.V. He W. Izotova L.S. Barnoski B.L. Pestka S. J. Biol.

Commun. 2000; 274: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). 10–100 µg of MBP (Sigma product M1891; purified from bovine brain; lyophilized powder), 10–100 µg of histone H2A (Boehringer Mannheim product 1,034,740; purified from calf thymus), or 2 µg of GST-GAR was added to the HA-PRMT5 (immunoprecipitated from 1 × 107 HeLa cells/reaction) bound to protein A/G beads, which were then incubated at 37 °C for 5 h with 3 µl ofS-adenosyl-l-[methyl-3H]methionine ([3H]AdoMet; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; 72.0–79.0 Ci/mmol; 13–14 µm) for GST-GAR and 5 µl of [3H]AdoMet for MBP and histone H2A in a final volume of 30 µl for GST-GAR and 50 µl for histone H2A and MBP (21Lee J.-H. Cook J.R. Pollack B.P. Kinzy T.G. Norris D. Pestka S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 274: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Reactions were stopped by freezing on dry ice. For myc-tagged proteins, myc-PRMT5 andmyc-PRMT5ΔGAGRG were immunoprecipitated with anti-myc antibody from 7.5 × 106 COS-1 cells as described previously (20Pollack B.P. Kotenko S.V. He W. Izotova L.S. Barnoski B.L. Pestka S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31531-31542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). 10 µg of MBP was added to eithermyc-PRMT5 or myc-PRMT5ΔGAGRG, which was then incubated at 37 °C for 5 h with 5 µl of [3H]AdoMet (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; 82.0 Ci/mmol; 12 µm) in a final volume of 30 µl. A 5-µl aliquot of the above-mentioned in vitro reaction for MBP and histone H2A and a 30-µl aliquot of the above-mentioned in vitroreaction for GST-GAR were mixed with 11.1 µg of bovine serum albumin as a carrier protein and an equal volume of 25% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid in a 6 × 50-mm glass vial and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. The precipitated protein was then centrifuged at 4000 × g for 40 min at 25 °C, the supernatant was drawn off and discarded, and the pellets were washed once with an equal volume of acetone at −20 °C. After centrifugation for 20 min as described above, the acetone was discarded, and the pellets were allowed to dry. Acid hydrolysis was carried out on the dried pellet in a Waters Pico-Tag vapor-phase apparatus in vacuo for 20 h at 110 °C using 200 µl of 6 n HCl, and the hydrolyzed samples were resuspended in 50 µl of water for analysis on an amino acid cation exchange column. The column was regenerated with 0.2n NaOH. Standard amino acids included ω-N G-monomethylarginine (Sigma product M7033; acetate salt), asymmetric ω-N G,N G-dimethylarginine (Sigma product D4268; hydrochloride), and symmetricN G,N G′-dimethylarginine (Sigma product D0390; di-(p-hydroxyazobenzene-p′-sulfonate) salt). Pooled fractions from the cation exchange column were loaded onto a Sephadex G-15 column (1.5 cm in diameter and 77 cm in length) at 25 °C equilibrated with 0.1 m acetic acid. Fractions (3.5 ml) were collected, and their conductance was determined with a YSI conductance meter model 35. Radioactivity was measured by counting a 200-µl aliquot of every fraction diluted with 400 µl of water in 5 ml of Safety Solve scintillation fluor (Research Products International). A 100-µl aliquot was tested for the nonradioactive standards using the ninhydrin assay as described previously (5Bedford M.T. Frankel A. Yaffe M.B. Clarke S. Leder P. Richard S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16030-16036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). To determine the specific products of the methylation reaction catalyzed by PRMT5 (JBP1), HA-tagged PRMT5 was isolated from HeLa cells and incubated with MBP and [3H]AdoMet. Protein reaction products were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, acid-hydrolyzed to their amino acid components, and fractionated on a high-resolution amino acid analysis cation exchange column along with standards of unlabeled asymmetric ω-N G,N G-dimethylarginine and ω-N G-monomethylarginine, species that are well separated under our conditions (Fig. 1). We found that most of the radioactivity eluted just ahead of the ω-N G-monomethylarginine standard at 86 min in a position expected for its tritiated derivative (9Gary J.D. Lin W.J. Yang M.C. Herschman H.R. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12585-12594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 24Gottschling H. Freese E. Nature. 1962; 196: 829-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 25Xie H. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13364-13371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, a peak that consistently migrated at about 79 min between the positions of asymmetric ω-N G,N G-dimethylarginine and ω-N G-monomethylarginine standards was also observed. In Fig. 2A, we show that the radioactivity in this second peak at 76–79 min elutes just prior to the unlabeled symmetric ω-N G,NG′-dimethylarginine standard, suggesting that PRMT5 may catalyze the formation of the symmetric dimethylarginine derivative. However, δ-N-monomethylarginine, the product of the type IV methyltransferase, has also been determined to elute in a similar position on this cation exchange column (25Xie H. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13364-13371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To distinguish between these two methylarginine derivatives, we examined their breakdown products upon base treatment. It has previously been shown that when δ-N-monomethylarginine is treated with base, it forms δ-N-methylornithine (26Zobel-Thropp P. Gary J.D. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29283-29286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), whereas ω-N G,N G′-dimethylarginine and ω-N G-monomethylarginine yield methylamine, and ω-N G,N G-dimethylarginine yields dimethylamine (27Paik W.K. Kim S. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 88-92Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We thus treated the material eluting with the symmetric standard with 2 m NaOH at 55 °C for 24 h and then re-chromatographed it on the cation exchange column along with unlabeled δ-N-methylornithine and methylamine standards (Fig. 2 B). No radioactivity was found to co-elute with the δ-N-methylornithine standard. However, radioactivity did co-elute with the methylamine standard, suggesting that the peak in fractions 76–79 (Figs. 1 and 2 A) may be attributed to symmetric ω-N G,N G′-dimethylarginine.Figure 2Base treatment of the3H-methylated arginine derivative from MBP produces [3H]methylamine and not δ-N G-[3H]monomethylornithine.Fractions 76–79 from the chromatograph shown in Fig. 1 were pooled, mixed with 50 µl of 10 mm symmetric ω-N G,N G′-dimethylarginine, and desalted by gel filtration as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The desalted pool was then concentrated to ∼1.0 ml by vacuum centrifugation in a Speedvac apparatus. A, a 200-µl aliquot of the desalted pool was spiked with 20 µl of 10 mm symmetric ω-N G,N G′-dimethylarginine and brought to a pH of 2.0 with 6 N HCl. The sample was then re-chromatographed on the amino acid cation exchange column.B, a 200-µl aliquot of the desalted pool was mixed with 50 µl of 10 m NaOH and incubated at 55 °C for 24 h. The sample was then diluted with 4.25 ml of water and mixed with 50 µl of ∼0.02 m δ-N-methylornithine, which was synthesized as described previously (23Norrander J. Kempe T. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1983; 26: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (1535) Google Scholar), and 5 µl of 0.2m methylamine. The sample was brought to a pH of 2.0 and re-chromatographed as described above.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further confirm that the in vitro methylated MBP acid hydrolysis products are in fact symmetric ω-N G,N G′-dimethylarginine and ω-N G-monomethylarginine, the methylated arginine derivatives, were analyzed by thin layer chromatography. Fig.3shows that the radioactive material eluting at 76–79 min in Figs. 1 and 2 A co-elutes exactly with a symmetric ω-N G,N G′-dimethylarginine standard in two different thin layer chromatography systems. The radioactive species that co-elutes with the ω-N G-monomethylarginine standard at 83–86 min on the cation exchange column in Fig. 1 is also shown to co-elute with the ω-N G-monomethylarginine standard in these two chromatography methods (Fig. 4). These results indicate that HA-PRMT5 is capable of catalyzing the formation of ω-N G,N G′-dimethylarginine and ω-N G-monomethylarginine in polypeptides.Figure 4HA-PRMT5 can monomethylate arginine at the ω nitrogen as shown by co-migration with ω-N G-monomethylarginine on thin layer chromatography. A desalted pool of fractions 83–86 from Fig. 1 was desalted by gel filtration chromatography as described for fractions 76–79 in the Fig. 2 legend, and the sample was then concentrated to 1.5 ml in a Speedvac apparatus and analyzed by thin layer chromatography at room temperature on a 20-cm sheet coated with either a layer of silica gel (A) or a layer of cellulose (B) as described in the Fig. 3 legend.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next asked whether the formation of symmetric dimethylarginine residues occurred only with MBP, or whether the specificity for symmetric dimethylation resided in the enzyme itself. GST-GAR, an artificial polypeptide that has been shown to be an excellent in vitro substrate for type I enzymes that catalyze asymmetric dimethylation (8Tang J. Gary J.D. Clarke S. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16935-16945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), was also found to be radiolabeled in vitro with HA-PRMT5. As shown in Fig.5, amino acid analysis of this reaction product clearly demonstrates that arginine residues in GST-GAR are monomethylated (Fig. 5 B) and symmetrically dimethylated (Fig. 5 C), but significantly, these residues are not asymmetrically dimethylated by HA-PRMT5. Additionally, we found that histone H2A, another methyl-accepting substrate of HA-PRMT5 (21Lee J.-H. Cook J.R. Pollack B.P. Kinzy T.G. Norris D. Pestka S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 274: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), also forms the symmetric ω-N G,N G′-dimethylarginine and ω-N G-monomethylarginine derivatives (data not shown). Our results, therefore, suggest that PRMT5 is capable of specific type II (symmetric dimethylation) activity in a substrate-independent fashion. To verify that the type II activity we see is due to PRMT5 and not an impurity in the enzyme preparation, we constructedmyc-tagged mutants of PRMT5 that were transfected into COS-1 cells, and we analyzed the immunoprecipitates for arginine methyltransferase activity. Because the sequence GXGRG of motif I is highly conserved in PRMT5 and its homologues and is important for AdoMet binding (20Pollack B.P. Kotenko S.V. He W. Izotova L.S. Barnoski B.L. Pestka S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31531-31542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), the sequence GAGRG (amino acids 365–369) was deleted to form myc-PRMT5ΔGAGRG. As shown in Fig. 6, there is a dramatic reduction in the formation of ω-[3H]MMA and [3H]SDMA in the mutated enzyme preparation. The small amount of radioactivity seen in the PRMT5ΔGAGRG mutant preparation may represent co-precipitated endogenous enzymatic activity because a similar amount of radioactivity is seen in a vector-only control of immunoprecipitated COS-1 cell extracts (data not shown). We also constructed a mutant in which the GAAGR sequence of motif I was mutated to GAAAG. When this mutant was analyzed for enzymatic activity, the formation of ω-[3H]MMA and [3H]SDMA was approximately half that of the wild type enzyme (data not shown). In both the deletion and substitution mutants, Western analysis with anti-myc antibodies showed the presence of equivalent amounts of PRMT5 expression. A MBP-specific arginine methyltransferase activity has been previously purified to “near” homogeneity from calf brain as a large complex (500 kDa) containing two major polypeptides of 75 and 100 kDa (13Kim S. Chanderkar L.P. Ghosh S.K. Paik W.K. Kim S. Protein Methylation. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1990: 77-95Google Scholar). Attempts to dissociate the complex into smaller enzymatically active molecules have failed (13Kim S. Chanderkar L.P. Ghosh S.K. Paik W.K. Kim S. Protein Methylation. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1990: 77-95Google Scholar). The relationship between these polypeptides and the expected 72-kDa PRMT5 (JBP1) polypeptide is unknown at present, although the 75-kDa protein found in the MBP-specific methyltransferase could represent the catalytic PRMT5 polypeptide, and the 100-kDa polypeptide could be an additional subunit that is involved in regulation or substrate specificity. Here we show that PRMT5 purified as a native hemagglutinin-tagged complex from HeLa cells or as a myc-tagged complex from COS-1 cells, which should contain other tightly bound subunits as well, has type II arginine methyltransferase activity. However, it is likely that the 75-kDa protein contains this activity in the absence of additional subunits because it has been demonstrated that the polypeptide itself has methyltransferase activity (22Rho J.

We have shown that the PRMT5 complex can methylate MBP, GST-GAR, and histone H2A in vitro, although its physiological methyl-accepting substrate(s) has yet to be determined. Three potential substrates, MBP and the Sm nuclear ribonucleoproteins D1 and D3, have been shown to be symmetrically dimethylated in vivo (13Kim S. Chanderkar L.P. Ghosh S.K. Paik W.K. Kim S. Protein Methylation. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1990: 77-95Google Scholar,19Brahms H. Raymuckers J. Union A. Keyser F. Meheus L. Luhrmann R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17122-17129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). All of these three substrates have a consensus sequence that consists of an arginine residue sandwiched between two glycine residues. This consensus sequence is similar to that found for type I substrates (6Gary J.D. Clarke S. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 61: 65-130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As we show here with GST-GAR, type I substrates can be symmetrically dimethylated in vitro. We have also been able to asymmetrically dimethylate MBP, a type II substrate, with type I enzymes in vitro. 4T. L. Branscombe, A. Frankel, and S. Clarke, unpublished data. These results suggest that it is not the “consensus sequence” or secondary structure of the substrate that is crucial in determining the type of methylation the arginine residue will undergo, but rather the type of specific methyltransferase complex that acts on the methyl acceptor. The role of PRMT5 in vivo has yet to be determined. PRMT5 was isolated because of its ability to interact with Janus kinase 2 (20Pollack B.P. Kotenko S.V. He W. Izotova L.S. Barnoski B.L. Pestka S.

Homologues of PRMT5 have been identified inSchizosaccharomyces pombe and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Hsl7, the S. cerevisiae homologue, has been shown to be a negative regulator of the protein kinases Swe1 and Ste20 (28Ma X. Lu Q. Grunstein M.

Res. Commun. 2000; 274: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Disruption of the gene leads to cell cycle abnormalities and elongated buds (28Ma X. Lu Q. Grunstein M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1327-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The mammalian PRMT5 gene has been found to partially rescue this phenotype when introduced into S. cerevisiae on a plasmid (21Lee J.-H. Cook J.R. Pollack B.P. Kinzy T.G. Norris D. Pestka S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 274: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Skb1, the S. pombehomologue of Hsl7, interacts with the Shk1 kinase (the S. pombe homologue of Ste20), and disruption of its gene also leads to cell cycle abnormalities (30Gilbreth M. Yang P. Wang D.

This suggests that PRMT5 may be involved in numerous functions, including cell cycle progression and cellular signaling. We note the connections of enzymes that catalyze post-translational modifications by phosphorylation and methylation in these systems, and it is possible that both types of reactions interact to achieve metabolic control. Our demonstration that PRMT5 catalyzes type II activity distinguishes it from all of the known mammalian protein N-arginine methyltransferase homologues that catalyze type I activity. The crystal structures of two type I enzymes, the rat PRMT3 catalytic core (amino acids 201–528) in complex withS-adenosyl-l-homocysteine (32Zhang X. Zhou L. Cheng X. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3509-3519Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) and RMT1 (amino acids 22–348) (33Weiss V.H. McBride A.E. Soriano M.A. Filman D.J. Silver P.A. Hogle J.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1165-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar), have recently been solved. Both structures exhibit virtually identical core structural features with the predicted site for the arginine methyl-accepting substrate falling within an acidic pocket. Interestingly, all of the PRMTs except Hsl7 and PRMT5 contain an active site methionine residue (amino acid 337 for PRMT3 and amino acid 143 for RMT1) that has been proposed to exclude binding of ω-MMA in a conformation that would allow its symmetric methylation (32Zhang X. Zhou L. Cheng X. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3509-3519Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). However in both PRMT5 (amino acid 446) and Hsl7 (amino acid 474), the residue corresponding to Met-337 is serine. The smaller bulk of the side chain of this residue may now allow for SDMA formation with PRMT5 and possibly Hsl7 (Fig.7)."

These effects have been observed both in cultured cells and in regions of rat brain known to be involved in mood regulation. VPA and lithium also increase reporter gene expression driven by a promoter containing consensus TPA response element (TRE) sequences, but not mutant TRE, demonstrating that both agents enhance the transactivation activity of AP-1 (10Chen G. Yuan P.X. Jiang Y.M. Huang L.D. Manji H.K. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 64: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 11Yuan P.X. Chen G. Huang L.D. Manji H.K. Brain Res. Mol.

Four mammalian mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathways, ERK, JNK, p38, and ERK5, are known to regulate AP-1 transcription factors (for reviews, see Refs. 12Karin M. J. Biol.

Lithium increases the levels of the activated forms of JNKs but not total JNKs in rat frontal cortex and hippocampus, as well as in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell (9Yuan P. Chen G. Manji H.K. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 2299-2309Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Lithium also increases JNK activity in intact cells, as detected with c-Jun PathDetect trans-reporting system (14Xu l. Sancheez T. Zheng C. Strategies. 1997; 10: 1-3Google Scholar); these effects are blocked by a dominant-negative SEK1 mutant (9Yuan P. Chen G. Manji H.K. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 2299-2309Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Furthermore, lithium increases the levels of phosphorylated c-Jun and total c-Jun (9Yuan P. Chen G. Manji H.K. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 2299-2309Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Taken together, the data indicate that lithium activates the SEK/JNK pathway, an effect that ultimately results in increased c-Jun expression and increases in AP-1 DNA binding activity and transactivation activity (9Yuan P. Chen G. Manji H.K. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 2299-2309Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To date, the molecular mechanisms by which VPA regulates AP-1 function have remained completely unknown. In view of the role of MAP kinases in regulating AP-1 function, we have undertaken the present study to determine whether VPA affects the MAP kinase pathways. We have found that VPA at therapeutic concentrations (50–150 µg/ml or 0.41–1.04 mm) (15McElroy S.L. Keck Jr P.E. Schatzberg A.F. Nemeroff C.B. Textbook of Psychopharmacology. American Psychiatric Press, Inc., Washington D. C.1995: 351-375Google Scholar) stimulates ERK pathway, increases growth cone-associated protein 43 (GAP-43) and Bcl-2 levels, promotes neurite growth and cell survival, and increases norepinephrine (NE) uptake and release. Thus, activation of the ERK pathway by VPA may underlie the effects of VPA on AP-1 transcription factor and on the expression of genes known to be regulated by AP-1. Interestingly, these results are similar to those elicited by several neurotrophic factors in the same cell line (16Encinas M. Iglesias M. Llecha N. Comella J.X. J.

The pEBG SEK KR and pCEFL MKK6 KR were previously described (20Marinissen M.J. Chiariello M. Pallante M. Gutkind J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4289-4301Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The Elk1 PathDetect trans-reporting system and LipoTAXI were purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). GAP-43 antibody was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. AP-1 oligo nucleotide, pJNK, JNK, Bcl-2, and Bax antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). pERK, ERK, phospho-p38 (p-p38), and p38 antibodies were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). [3H]NE, [γ-32P]ATP, secondary antibodies, and chemiluminescence reagents were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. PD098059 and SB203580 were from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). T4 kinase and all culture reagents were from Life Technologies, Inc. VPA (2-propylpentanoic acid), protease inhibitor mixture, phosphatase inhibitor mixture I and II, and all other standard chemicals were obtained from Sigma. Human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell culture and AP-1 DNA binding assay were conducted as previously described (3Chen G. Yuan P. Hawver D.B. Potter W.Z. Manji H.K. Neuropsychopharmacology. 1997; 16: 238-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 10Chen G. Yuan P.X. Jiang Y.M. Huang L.D. Manji H.K. Brain Res. Mol.

Brain Res. 1998; 58: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In brief, SH-SY5Y cells were cultured in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air/5% CO2 at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 IU/ml of penicillin, and 50 µg/ml of streptomycin. When the cultures reached 80% confluence, the cells were treated with VPA (1 mm), PD098059 (50 µm), and SB203580 (10 µm) in serum-free media for 24 h. For AP-1 DNA binding assay, the consensus oligo (5′-CGC TTG ATG ACT CAG CCG GAA-3′) was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 kinase according to the manufacturer's specifications. Free [γ-32P]ATP was separated from labeled oligos using a pushing column from Stratagene. The washed cells were lysed, and the lysates were sonicated for 10 s and then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min to remove residual debris. The whole cell extracts were incubated with 32P-labeled oligos at 37 °C for 15 min. The DNA binding reaction was terminated by the addition of 5× loading buffer, and the reaction mixtures were then subjected to gel electrophoresis using a 6% DNA retardation gel. The specificity of the DNA binding assay was confirmed by demonstrating that the addition of 50-fold excess of unlabeled TRE oligos but not mutant AP-1 oligos completely blocked AP-1 binding; furthermore, an antibody against the AP-1 family proteins supershifted the AP-1 binding band. The Elk1 PathDetect trans-reporting system was used to detect activation of MAP kinases in intact SH-SY5Y cell (14Xu l. Sancheez T. Zheng C. Strategies. 1997; 10: 1-3Google Scholar). Transient transfection and luciferase reporter gene activity assays were conducted as previously described (9Yuan P. Chen G. Manji H.K. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 2299-2309Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 10Chen G. Yuan P.X. Jiang Y.M. Huang L.D. Manji H.K. Brain Res. Mol.

Brain Res. 1998; 58: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In brief, trypsinized SH-SY5Y cells were suspended in growth media and subcultured into six-well plates. After an overnight incubation, the cells were transfected with pFR-luc plasmid (encoding a luciferase gene driven by a promoter containing GAL4 binding sites) and pFA-Elk1 plasmid (encoding a fusion protein comprising of a GAL4 DNA binding domain and an Elk1 activation domain) in the media without serum and antibiotics. LipoTAXI reagent was used as the carrier. To block the ERK, JNK, and p38 pathways individually, the cells were cotransfected with pUSE Ha-Ras S17N and pUSE Raf-1 K375M, pEBG SEK KR, or pCEFL MKK6 KR. After 6 h of transfection, an equal volume of medium containing 1% fetal bovine serum was added, and the cells were incubated overnight, prior to the experimental studies. Transfected cells were incubated with VPA at the concentrations and for the time periods indicated in the figures. The incubations were also carried out in the presence of PD098059 (50 µm) or SB203580 (10 µm). Luciferase activity was measured using an assay kit from Promega (Madison, WI). Immunoblotting was conducted as previously described, with modifications (5Chen G. Yuan P.X. Jiang Y.M. Huang L.D. Manji H.K. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 1768-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 21Chen G. Manji H.K. Hawver D.B. Wright C.B. Potter W.Z. J.

Neurochem. 1999; 72: 879-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). In brief, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and homogenized by brief sonication in an extraction buffer. The buffer contains 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mmβ-glycerophosphate, protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), and phosphatase inhibitor mixture I and II (Sigma). The homogenates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 s to remove undissolved debris. Subsequent immunoblotting was performed using amounts of protein demonstrated to be within the linear range for immunoblotting. The antibodies for immunoblots were diluted according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The immunocomplex was detected with an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ECL or ECL plus kit. Quantitation of the immunoblots was performed by densitometric scanning of the film using an Image Analysis system with NIH Image 1.55 software. Neurite growth of human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell was set up based on described methods (18Kim B. Leventhal P.S. Saltiel A.R. Feldman E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21268-21273Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 19Recio-Pinto E. Ishii D.N. Brain Res. 1984; 302: 323-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Confluent SH-SY5Y cells were trypsinized and suspended in the growth media. The cell suspension was then diluted 1:120 and transferred to gas plasma-treated polystyrene tissue culture dishes or six-well plates (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). The cells were incubated for 2–3 h to allow the cells to attach. The dish or plate was then washed twice with DMEM to remove the residual serum and unattached cells. The cells were then incubated in DMEM in the absence or presence of VPA at varying concentrations and periods of time. The images of the cells were captured and relative neurite length was measured using NIH Image 1.55 software. Uptake and release of NE were determined using previously reported methods (23Murphy N.P. Ball S.G. Vaughan P.F. J. Neurochem. 1991; 56: 1810-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). SH-SY5Y cells were treated with 1.0 mm VPA in serum-free DMEM for 1 or 5 days in six-well dishes. For uptake, the cells were incubated with [3H]NE in Hepes-buffered saline (HBS) at 37 °C for 1 h, and the cells were then washed three times with HBS. HBS contains 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 135 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 6 mm glucose, 2.5 mmCaCl2, and 0.6 mm MgSO4. Desipramine (3 ng/ml) was used in one set of wells to determine the nonspecific incorporation. Release was induced by depolarization with potassium using K+-HBS. K+-HBS contains 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 40 mm NaCl, 100 mm KCl, 6 mm glucose, 2.5 mmCaCl2, and 0.6 mm MgSO4. Ascorbic acid (0.02%) and Clorgyline (0.3 µg/ml) were added to HBS and K+-HBS before used. The specific uptake and release were calculated and expressed as cpm/µg of protein. Statistical analysis was performed by analysis of variance, followed by Fisher's paired least significant difference or Scheffe's tests. p < 0.05 was considered significant. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. As we have previously observed (3Chen G. Yuan P. Hawver D.B. Potter W.Z. Manji H.K. Neuropsychopharmacology. 1997; 16: 238-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), VPA induced a 2-fold increase in the binding activity of AP-1 in serum-deprived human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y (Fig.1A). To begin addressing the mechanisms by which VPA affects gene expression, we took advantage of the availability of inhibitors of the MAP kinase pathways. PD098059, a MEK inhibitor (24Pang L. Sawada T. Decker S.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13585-13588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar), blocked VPA-induced increases of AP-1 binding (Fig.1 B); conversely, SB203580, a p38 inhibitor (25Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.J. Heys J.R. Landvatter S.W. Strickler J.E. McLaughlin M.M. Siemens I.R. Fisher S.M. Livi G.P. White J.R. Adams J.L. Young P.R. Nature. 1994; 372: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (3128) Google Scholar), was without significant effect (Fig. 1 C), suggesting that the ERK pathway is required for the effects of VPA. To further explore the potential activation of MAP kinases by VPA, the activation of Elk1, a common target for MAP kinases, was investigated using the PathDetect trans-reporting system, in which the luciferase reporter gene activity reflects the activation of Elk1 by MAP kinases in intact cells (14Xu l. Sancheez T. Zheng C. Strategies. 1997; 10: 1-3Google Scholar). SH-SY5Y cells were transfected with Elk1 PathDetect trans-reporting system and then treated with VPA. VPA (1 mm) increased luciferase activity by 0.5-fold at 4 h, 2-fold at 8 h, and 13-fold at 24 h (Fig.2A). One-hour VPA incubation did not produce any significant changes in luciferase activity (Fig. 2 A). Concentration dependence studies were conducted with the 8-h incubation and showed that 0.25 mm VPA was without significant effect, whereas 0.7-, 2.5-, and 6-fold increases in luciferase activity were observed with 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mmVPA, respectively (Fig. 2 B). Similar to the results observed with AP-1 DNA binding, SB203580 (10 µm) did not significantly affect VPA-induced luciferase increases (data not shown), whereas PD098059 reduced the effects of VPA (Fig. 2 C). To more specifically identify the upstream components in the ERK pathway required in the actions of VPA and reveal the role of other MAP kinase pathways in these actions, the SH-SY5Y cells were co-transfected with the Elk1 trans-reporting system and either pUSE Ha-Ras S17N (22Chen G. Zeng W.Z. Yuan P.X. Huang L.D. Jiang Y.M. Zhao Z.H. Manji H.K. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 879-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar), pUSE Raf-1 K375M, pEBG SEK KR, and pCEFL MKK6 KR, which encode dominant negative Ha-Ras, Raf-1, SEK1, and MKK6 mutants, respectively. The effects of VPA on Elk1 were significantly reduced by dominant negative Ras (Fig.3A) and Raf (Fig.3 B) mutants but not by SEK (Fig. 3 C) and MKK6 (Fig. 3 D) mutants. To further confirm activation of MAP kinases by VPA, the levels of the phosphorylated activated forms, as well as total ERKs, were quantitated using immunoblotting. The levels of pERK44 and pERK42 increased 2- and 1-fold by 1 day of VPA incubation and 13- and 7-fold by 5 days of VPA incubation (Fig. 4). Neither the 1-day nor the 5-day VPA incubation significantly altered total ERK44 or ERK42 levels (Fig. 4 A). Taken together, the data (Figs.Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4) demonstrate that VPA activates the ERK pathway, and the activation persists for several days. One-day VPA incubation did not significantly alter the levels of pJNK54 and pJNK46 (24Pang L. Sawada T. Decker S.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13585-13588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar) (Fig.5), which is consistent with a lack of significant effect of dominant-negative SEK mutant on VPA induction of Elk1 (Fig. 3 C). Five-day VPA incubation significantly increased levels of pJNK54 and pJNK46 (Fig. 5). One- and 5-day VPA incubations did not significantly change the levels of total JNK54 and JNK46 (Fig. 5 A). Taken together, the increased levels of pJNKs after the 5-day VPA incubation are likely due to the changes in phosphorylation or dephosphorylation of JNKs, but not the changes in JNK protein levels. The levels of p-p38 were not detectable in 1-day samples (Fig. 6A). Five-day VPA incubation significantly increased p-p38 levels (Fig. 6,A and B). One- and 5-day VPA incubations significantly increased p38 levels (Fig. 6), suggesting that chronic VPA either activates p38 gene expression or stabilizes p38 protein. Taking the increase in total p38 protein into account, the increases in p-p38 levels after 5-day VPA incubation could be due to changes in total p38, phosphorylated p38, or both. Because the ERK pathway is known to play a role in neurite growth (18Kim B. Leventhal P.S. Saltiel A.R. Feldman E.L. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4404-4413Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), the effects of VPA on the morphology of the SH-SY5Y cells was investigated. SH-SY5Y cells were seeded at a very low density and treated with 0, 0.25, 0.5, or 1.0 mm VPA in serum-free media for 1–8 days in serum-free media (Fig. 7). In the media without VPA, SH-SY5Y cells displayed very short neurites or spines (<2 × diameter of cell body); and the neurites/spines did not elongate appreciably over time (Fig. 7). In addition, the cells gradually detached and died over the time period in dishes without VPA. By contrast, much longer neurites were seen in the VPA-treated cells (Fig.7), and more cells remained. The quantitative image analysis showed that treatment of the cells with VPA produced a concentration- and time-dependent increase in neurite length, resulting in an 8.6-, 14.2-, and 23.0-fold increases in neurite length following 8-day incubation with 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 mm VPA, respectively (Fig. 7). To investigate the role of MAP kinases in the effects of VPA on neurite elongation, SH-SY5Y cells were incubated with 1.0 mm VPA in the absence or presence of PD098059 (50 µm). Me2SO was used as a solvent for PD098059 and was therefore used as the vehicle control. The cells gradually died over the 11-day period in dishes containing PD098059, in either the absence or presence of VPA (Fig.8). PD098059 did not have marked effects on short neurites (Fig. 8). By contrast, long neurites were only observed in VPA treated cells at days 4, 7, and 11, but not in cells co-treated with VPA and PD098059 at any of these time points (Fig. 8). These results suggest that activation of the ERK pathway is involved in the effects of VPA on neurite growth and cell survival. GAP-43 and Bcl-2 are proteins involved in neurite growth during development or regeneration (28Chen D.F. Schneider G.E. Martinou J.C. Tonegawa S.

One-day VPA incubation resulted in ∼70% increase in GAP-43 levels, whereas a greater than 3-fold increase in GAP-43 levels was observed after 5-day VPA exposure (Fig. 9, B andC). One-day VPA incubation did not produce significant increases in Bcl-2 levels, whereas 5-day VPA exposure produced >5-fold increase in Bcl-2 levels (Fig. 10,A and B). Neither 1-day nor 5-day VPA incubation produced significant changes in levels of Bax (Fig. 10, Aand C), the counterpart of Bcl-2 in apoptosis (34Merry D.E. Korsmeyer S.J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1997; 20: 245-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar).Figure 10VPA increases Bcl-2 but not Bax levels.SH-SY5Y cells were treated with 1.0 mm VPA in serum-free DMEM for 1 or 5 days. Whole cell extracts were prepared, and Bcl-2 and Bax immunoblotting was conducted with 20 µg of whole cell protein extracts. The levels were obtained using an image analysis system with NIH Image 1.55 software. Immunoblots of Bcl-2 and Bax shown are from a representative experiment, which was repeated three more times with similar results. Bcl-2 (B) and Bax (C) data are mean ± S.E. of four independent experiments, expressed as percentage change with respect to non-VPA-treated cells. *,p < 0.05 compared with non-VPA-treated cells.

Ball S.G. Vaughan P.F. J. Neurochem. 1991; 56: 1810-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Therefore, the uptake and release of NE were investigated. Incubation of SH-SY5Y cells with VPA (1.0 mm) increased [3H]NE uptake 1-fold after 1-day incubation and 3.5-fold after 5-day incubation (Fig.11A). Furthermore, VPA increased [3H]NE release 4-fold after a 1-day incubation and 16-fold after a 5-day incubation (Fig. 11 B). These data suggest that VPA treatment was associated with enhanced functional properties. Finally, we investigated the life span of SH-SY5Y cells with elongated neurites in the presence of VPA. During the extended period (∼13–40 days) (Fig. 12), web-like neurite networks developed, in which long neurites projected from clusters of cell bodies and ended in contact with either another neurite or another cluster of cell bodies (Fig. 12). After about day 40, the neurites and cell bodies began to detach, and by day 55, more than 50% of cells had detached. Interestingly, even when detached and suspended in the medium, some of the neurite networks remained. At present, 55 days of treatment is the longest VPA incubation that we have conducted. Without VPA, almost all of the cells detached and died after 12 days in serum-free medium. Antimanic action of VPA appears at blood level above 50 µg/ml, and clinical toxicity appears at blood level above 200 µg/ml (15McElroy S.L. Keck Jr P.E. Schatzberg A.F. Nemeroff C.B. Textbook of Psychopharmacology. American Psychiatric Press, Inc., Washington D. C.1995: 351-375Google Scholar). 150 µg/ml (1.041 mm) was used in the VPA antimanic efficacy trial (35Bowden C.L. Brugger A.M. Swann A.C. Calabrese J.R. Janicak P.G. Petty F. Dilsaver S.C. Davis J.M. Rush A.J. Small J.G. Garza-Trevino E.S. Risch S.C. Goodnick P.J. Morris D.D. J. Am. Med.

Therefore, 1 mm VPA was used in most of experiments described in this paper, except that lower and higher concentrations were used in concentration-dependent experiments. In the present study, we have shown that VPA at therapeutic concentration produces effects similar to those of neurotrophic factors, namely activation of the ERK pathway and promotion of neurite growth and cell survival. VPA also increases GAP-43 and Bcl-2 levels and enhances the neuronal function. VPA stimulates DNA binding activity, transactivation activity of AP-1 transcription factor, and expression of genes regulated by AP-1 (2Asghari V. Wang J.F. Reiach J.S. Young L.T. Brain Res. Mol.

Brain Res. 1999; 64: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In the present study, we found that VPA activated ERK, the upstream modulator of AP-1. Blockade of ERK pathway by PD098059 blocked VPA-induced increases in AP-1 binding activity. These data indicate that the ERK pathway is required for VPA-induced increases in AP-1 binding. There are at least two pathways through which ERK regulates AP-1 (12Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2249) Google Scholar). ERK phosphorylates and activates Elk1, thereby enhancing expression of c-Fos, a key member of the AP-1 family, resulting in an increase of AP-1 function (12Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2249) Google Scholar). It has been reported that VPA increases c-Fos expression (2Asghari V. Wang J.F. Reiach J.S. Young L.T. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1998; 58: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 8Wlodarczyk B.C. Craig J.C. Bennett G.D. Calvin J.A. Finnell R.H. Teratology. 1996; 54: 284-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), but this effect may be transient. ERK activation has also been shown to result in increases in phosphorylation of c-Jun at serine 63 and serine 73 and, secondarily, increases in c-Jun expression (36Binetruy B. Smeal T. Karin M. Nature. 1991; 351: 122-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 37Pulverer B.J. Hughes K. Franklin C.C. Kraft A.S. Leevers S.J. Woodgett J.R.

Binetruy B. Mercola D.A. Birrer M. Karin M. Nature. 1991; 354: 494-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). c-Jun has been implicated in several long lasting AP-1 effects, including neurite outgrowth (27Leppa S. Saffrich R. Ansorge W. Bohmann D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4404-4413Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). In our preliminary study, we found that VPA increased c-Jun levels and phosphorylated c-Jun in VPA-treated SH-SY5Y cells. These data suggest that the VPA-induced increases in AP-1 binding and function are likely due, at least in part, to activation of ERK followed by phosphorylation and increase in expression of c-Jun. Previous studies have found a conservative AP-1 site in the GAP-43 promoter, and AP-1 is involved in enhanced GAP-43 expression (32Skene J.H. Annu Rev Neurosci. 1989; 12: 127-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). In the present study, we also found that VPA increased expression of GAP-43, perhaps through an ERK-AP-1 mechanism. The cAMP-response element site is present in the Bcl-2 promoter and phosphorylation of cAMP-response element-binding protein is associated with increases in Bcl-2 expression upon PKC activation (40Ji L. Mochon E. Arcinas M. Boxer L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22687-22691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar,41Wilson B.E. Mochon E. Boxer L.M. Mol. Cell.

Activation of MAP kinases by neurotrophin results in increases in cAMP-response element-binding protein phosphorylation and enhanced Bcl-2 expression (42Liu Y.Z. Boxer L.M. Latchman D.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2086-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 43Pugazhenthi S. Miller E. Sable C. Young P. Heidenreich K.A. Boxer L.M. Reusch J.E. J. Biol.

Neuron. 2000; 25: 11-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Thus, the VPA-induced increases in Bcl-2 expression may be mediated through ribosome S6 kinase and cAMP-response element-binding protein. The precise mechanisms by which VPA brings about these effects are currently unknown, but they likely involve the activation of intracellular signaling pathways because there are no known cell surface “VPA receptors.” Furthermore, the time course for the VPA-induced activation of ERK was much slower than that provoked by insulin-like growth factor-I or brain-derived neurotrophic factor in SH-SY5Y cells (16Encinas M. Iglesias M. Llecha N. Comella J.X. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1409-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 18Kim B. Leventhal P.S. Saltiel A.R. Feldman E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21268-21273Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Thus, it is unlikely that the activation of ERK pathways by VPA is initiated by direct interactions of VPA with a cell surface receptor, such as insulin-like growth factor-I receptor. VPA is not known to bind to any G protein-coupled receptors that activate MAP kinases (46Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1839-1842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). However, it is still possible that VPA might stimulate synthesis and secretion of a neurotrophic factor, which in turn activates the ERK pathway through cell surface receptor tyrosine kinase or other mechanisms. Cells have been demonstrated to gradually take up VPA over a time course from minutes to hours (47Nilsson M. Hansson E. Ronnback L. Neurochem. Res. 1990; 15: 763-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 48Siafaka-Kapadai A. Patiris M. Bowden C. Javors M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 56: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In cells, VPA is incorporated into larger phospholipid molecule(s), perhaps phosphatidylcholine (48Siafaka-Kapadai A. Patiris M. Bowden C. Javors M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 56: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). From phosphatidylcholine, lysophosphatidylcholine is generated intracellularly by phospholipase A2. Lysophosphatidylcholine activates ERK through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Janus kinase 2/MEK-1-dependent pathway in endothelial cells (49Cieslik K. Abrams C.S. Wu K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1211-1219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and through the tyrosine kinase-Ras-dependent pathway in mesangial cells (50Bassa B.V. Roh D.D. Vaziri N.D. Kirschenbaum M.A. Kamanna V.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F328-F337PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, a parsimonious working hypothesis is that VPA in neuronal cells affects lysophosphatidylcholine accumulation or valproyl-lysophosphatidylcholine is a potent or long lasting inducer of ERK pathway. Similar to nerve growth factor in PC-12 cell (24Pang L. Sawada T. Decker S.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13585-13588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar) and insulin-like growth factor-I in SH-SY5Y cell (18Kim B. Leventhal P.S. Saltiel A.R. Feldman E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21268-21273Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), ERK is required for VPA to promote neurite growth. Studies have shown that neurite growth can be induced using constitutively activated ERK pathway components or constitutively activated c-Jun mutants in PC-12 cells (26Fukuda M. Gotoh Y. Tachibana T. Dell K. Hattori S. Yoneda Y. Nishida E. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 239-244PubMed Google Scholar, 27Leppa S. Saffrich R. Ansorge W. Bohmann D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4404-4413Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), demonstrating that stimulation of ERK pathway at steps distal to cell surface receptor is sufficient for these neurobiological effects. In our studies, VPA induced persistent activation of ERK, suggesting that VPA (or a metabolite) behaves like an ERK pathway activator, producing persistent activation of ERK, which results in extended neurite growth. Although mood disorders have traditionally been conceptualized as neurochemical disorders, recent brain imaging studies in living patients and three-dimensional morphometric studies in postmortem brains have shown that patients with mood disorders display morphometric changes suggestive of cell loss and/or atrophy (51Drevets W.C.

We also found that lithium induced increases in N-acetyl-aspartate levels (a putative marker of neuronal viability and function) (56Moore G.J. Bebchuk J.M. Hasanat K. Chen G. Seraji-Bozorgzad N.

In view of the reported glial and neuronal cell loss and atrophy in mood disorders and the neurotrophic actions of the classic mood stabilizer lithium, these neurotrophic effects of VPA may play an important role in its long term therapeutic actions. Furthermore, these results suggest this simple fatty acid may be of utility in the treatment of a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders, a possibility that warrants further investigation."

Analyses of the RNA-activated ATPase activity of eIF4A have demonstrated that the binding of ATP and RNA to eIF4A are coupled and that eIF4A undergoes a sequence of conformational changes as it binds substrates (RNA and ATP), hydrolyzes ATP, and releases products (4Lorsch J.R.

A simple kinetic framework for the helicase activity of eIF4A was established and indicates that duplex unwinding is non-processive (6Rogers Jr., G.W. Richter N.J. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12236-12244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Recently, the helicase activity of eIF4A has been studied with respect to substrate specificity. Results confirmed that the degree of unwinding short (10–15 base pairs) RNA duplexes by eIF4A is dependent only on the stability (rather than the length) of the duplex, and that the amplitude of unwinding may also be correlated with duplex stability (7Rogers Jr., G.W. Lima W.F. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12598-12608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). eIF4A was also shown to be capable of unwinding blunt-ended (no single-stranded region) RNA/DNA, 2RNA/DNA refers to a duplex composed of a long strand of RNA and a short strand of DNA. Conversely, DNA/RNA refers to a duplex composed of a long strand of DNA and a short strand of RNA. DNA/RNA, and RNA/DNA-PS (PS is phosphorothioate backbone) duplexes as well as acting in either a 5′ → 3′ or 3′ → 5′ (bidirectional) manner (7Rogers Jr., G.W. Lima W.F. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12598-12608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). These results, taken together with competitive inhibition experiments, suggest that eIF4A is capable of interacting directly with double-stranded RNA (7Rogers Jr., G.W. Lima W.F. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12598-12608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). eIF4A is proposed to function in the m7G cap-dependent initiation of protein synthesis by unwinding secondary structure in the 5′-untranslated region of the mRNA, which facilitates the binding of the 40 S ribosomal subunit to the mRNA and allows for subsequent scanning of the 40 S subunit to the initiator AUG codon (see Refs. 8Hershey J.W.B.

It has been demonstrated via in vitro model assays and fractionated lysate systems that eIF4A works in conjunction with eIF4B, eIF4H, and as a subunit of eIF4F in this important regulatory step of translation initiation (8Hershey J.W.B. Merrick W.C. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 33-88Google Scholar, 11Merrick W.C. Sonenberg N. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 1997; 11: 333-342Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Furthermore, eIF4A, eIF4B, and eIF4F have also been implicated in internal ribosome entry site-mediated (m7G cap-independent) initiation (12Pestova T.V. Hellen C.U.T. Shatsky I.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6859-6869Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). eIF4F is a heterotrimeric protein complex of ∼250 kDa composed of eIF4A, eIF4E, and eIF4G (13Grifo J.A. Tahara S.M. Morgan M.A. Shatkin A.J. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 5804-5810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). eIF4E (25 kDa) interacts directly with the m7G cap of mRNA and is a key protein involved in the regulation of protein synthesis (8Hershey J.W.B. Merrick W.C. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 33-88Google Scholar, 14Sonenberg N. Guertin D. Cleveland D. Trachsel H. Cell. 1981; 27: 563-572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). eIF4G (171 kDa) acts as a scaffolding/adapter molecule to coordinate the interactions of eIF4A, eIF4E, eIF3, poly(A)-binding protein, and RNA (8Hershey J.W.B. Merrick W.C. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 33-88Google Scholar). The RNA binding, ATPase, and helicase activities of eIF4A are all enhanced as part of the eIF4F complex (15Grifo J.A. Abramson R.D. Satler C.A. Merrick W.C. J. Biol.

Whereas the precise mechanisms of the stimulatory effects of eIF4B on eIF4A and eIF4F are unclear, investigation shows that eIF4B increases the binding affinity of eIF4A for RNA and ATP (16Abramson R.D.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5758-5765Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). eIF4H is a small protein (25 kDa) that enhances the RNA helicase activity of eIF4A, as well as stimulating overall globin synthesis (6Rogers Jr., G.W. Richter N.J. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12236-12244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar,25Richter-Cook N.J. Dever T.E. Hensold J.O. Merrick W.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 35415-35424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). eIF4H also contains an RRM and shows sequence homology to eIF4B in this region (25Richter-Cook N.J. Dever T.E. Hensold J.O. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7579-7587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). It is postulated that eIF4H may act via protein-protein interactions to stabilize conformational changes that occur in eIF4A during RNA binding, ATP hydrolysis, and RNA duplex unwinding (26Richter N.J. Rogers Jr., G.W. Hensold J.O. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35415-35424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Whereas a simple kinetic framework for duplex unwinding has been established for eIF4A alone, it is unknown how this mechanism is affected by the addition eIF4B and/or eIF4H or when eIF4A is a subunit of eIF4F. Furthermore, it was of interest to investigate how these factors affected the helicase activity of eIF4A with respect to processivity, duplex recognition, substrate specificity, and directionality. Therefore, similar experiments to those performed previously in our laboratory (6Rogers Jr., G.W. Richter N.J. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12236-12244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 7Rogers Jr., G.W. Lima W.F. Merrick W.C. J. Biol.

Reagents were purchased from the following suppliers: rabbit reticulocyte lysate from Green Hectares, Oregon, WI; ATP and bovine serum albumin from Sigma; [γ-32P]ATP and [α-32P]CTP from PerkinElmer Life Sciences; DNA oligonucleotides PTT-23, PTB-44, D-14, D-15, D-16, D-17, D-20, and D-20C from the Molecular Biology Core Laboratory of Case Western Reserve University; DNA oligonucleotide D-44 from IDT, Inc., Coralville, IA; RNA oligonucleotides R-11, R-12, R-13, R-14, and R-15 from Cybersyn, Lenni, Pennsylvania; RNA oligonucleotides R-17–5′, R-19–5′, R-21–5′, R-23–5′, R-28–5′, R-38–5′, R-17–3′, R-19–3′, R-21–3′, R-23–3′, R-28–3′, R-38–3′ R-17C, and R-13C from Dharmacon Inc., Boulder, CO; MegashortscriptTM In Vitrotranscription kit from Ambion; and T4 polynucleotide kinase from New England Biolabs. DNA-PS, 2′-MOE, and 2′-MOE/PS oligonucleotides were supplied by Isis Pharmaceuticals, Carlsbad, CA. Purification of eIF4A, eIF4B, eIF4F and eIF4H follows the standard procedure used to purify protein translation initiation factors that have been previously published by this laboratory (13Grifo J.A.

Purification of recombinant eIF4H is described (26Richter N.J. Rogers Jr., G.W. Hensold J.O. Merrick W.C. J. Biol.

The sequences of all oligonucleotides used in this report are listed in Table I of Ref.7Rogers Jr., G.W. Lima W.F. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12598-12608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar. The DNA oligonucleotides synthesized by the Molecular Biology Core Laboratory of Case Western Reserve University were oligonucleotide purification cartridge-purified and stored in distilled H2O. DNA oligonucleotides synthesized by IDT, Inc., were polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis-purified, lyophilized, and resuspended in distilled H2O. RNA oligonucleotides synthesized by Cybersyn were polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis-purified, lyophilized, and resuspended in distilled H2O. RNA oligonucleotides synthesized by Dharmacon were deprotected per the manufacturer's instructions, lyophilized, and resuspended in distilled H2O. Quantitation of each oligonucleotide was performed by UV spectroscopy, and a value of 33 µg per 1 A 260 was used in determining concentration. Integrity and proper size of each oligonucleotide were assessed by 32P-end labeling each oligonucleotide (described below) and analyzed on a denaturing (7 m urea) 20% polyacrylamide gel with known size standards. R-44 was synthesized by in vitro transcription and gel-purified as described (7Rogers Jr., G.W. Lima W.F. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12598-12608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Quantitation of the purified transcript was performed by UV spectroscopy as described above. The RNA, DNA, DNA-PS, 2′-MOE, and 2′-MOE/PS oligonucleotides were 5′-end-labeled using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase as described (7Rogers Jr., G.W. Lima W.F. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12598-12608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Duplexes used in the helicase reactions were made and manipulated as described (7Rogers Jr., G.W. Lima W.F. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12598-12608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). (See Table I of Ref. 7Rogers Jr., G.W. Lima W.F. Merrick W.C. J.

The helicase assay was performed as described previously (6Rogers Jr., G.W. Richter N.J. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12236-12244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 7Rogers Jr., G.W. Lima W.F. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12598-12608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Unwinding of duplex substrates was monitored by following displacement of the radiolabeled short strand from the duplex. In general, 20-µl reactions contained 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5 (final pH 7.2), 70 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 1 mm magnesium acetate. The concentration of ATP was 1 mm, and duplex concentration was 1.8–1.9 nm(36–38 fmol). The concentrations of eIF4A, eIF4B, eIF4F, and eIF4H are indicated in the figure legends. Reactions were incubated at 35 °C (unless otherwise stated) for the duration of the time course. Reactions were terminated by adding 5 µl of a solution containing 50% glycerol, 2% SDS, 20 mm EDTA, and 0.05% bromphenol blue and xylene cyanol dyes. The products of unwinding reactions were analyzed by separation of displaced radiolabeled short strand from duplex species by electrophoresis on 15 or 18% native polyacrylamide gels (19:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide) at 4 °C for 2–3 h at 200 V in 1× Tris borate/EDTA buffer. After electrophoresis, gels were scanned directly using an Ambis radioanalytical scanner. Gels were then exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR film at −80 °C using intensifying screens. Quantitation of the helicase assay was as described previously (6Rogers Jr., G.W. Richter N.J. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12236-12244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 7Rogers Jr., G.W. Lima W.F. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12598-12608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In brief, quantitation of counts/min in duplex and displaced/single-stranded RNA bands was performed using the Ambis software. The degree of unwinding for each reaction was determined by measuring the percentage of counts/min in duplex and displaced/single-stranded RNA bands using the following formulas: % duplex = cpm duplex/(cpm duplex + cpm displaced strand) and % displaced strand = cpm displaced strand/(cpm duplex + cpm displaced strand). The total yield in counts/min among different reactions did not vary by more than ±10% of the average counts/min value of all the reactions in the given experiment. Furthermore, all reagents and protein preparations used in the assay were judged to be free of RNase and phosphatase contamination. A single reaction without (−) protein was incubated at 4 °C during the course of each experiment, and the amount of duplex in this control reaction (typically 36–38 fmol) was normalized to 100%, and the amount of (background) single-stranded RNA (typically 2–4 fmol) was normalized to 0%. All other reactions were scaled to these values. Treatment of data has been described previously (6Rogers Jr., G.W. Richter N.J. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12236-12244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 7Rogers Jr., G.W. Lima W.F. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12598-12608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). All data reported are the average of 3–5 separate experiments. Standard errors were less than ±10% in all experiments. All plots and graphs were constructed using Prism software by GraphPad. Duplex stability (ΔG) values for RNA/RNA duplex substrates were calculated for 35 °C using the nearest neighbor method of analysis as described by Turner and Sugimoto (28Turner D.H. Sugimoto N. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1988; 17: 167-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). Duplex stability (ΔG) values for RNA/DNA and DNA/RNA duplex substrates were calculated for 35 °C using the nearest neighbor method of analysis as described by Sugimoto et al. (29Sugimoto N. Nakano S. Katoh M. Matsumura A. Nakamuta H. Ohmichi T. Yoneyama M. Sasaki M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11211-11216Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Duplex stability (ΔG) values for DNA/DNA duplex substrates were calculated for 35 °C using the nearest neighbor method of analysis as described by SantaLucia et al. (30SantaLucia J. Allawi H.T. Seneviratne P.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3555-3562Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). Changing the non-bridging oxygen atom in the oligonucleotide phosphodiester (phosphate) backbone to sulfur (phosphorothioate (PS) backbone) decreases the stability of the duplex by 0.3 kcal/mol per modification (31Crooke, S. T. (1995) Therapeutic Applications of Oligonucleotides, pp. 53–62 and 123–130, R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX.Google Scholar). Changing the 2′-group of the ribose sugar to a methoxyethyl (MOE) group increases the stability of the duplex by 0.2 kcal/mol per modification (32Altmann K.H. Fabbro D. Dean N.M. Geiger T. Monia B.P. Muller M. Nicklin P. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 630-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 33Altmann K.H. Nicholas N.D. Fabbro D. Freier S.M. Geiger T. Haner R. Husker D. Martin P.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4429-4443Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). Initial rates of unwinding duplex substrates by initiation factors were determined by measuring the amount of unwinding in the linear (0–2 min) portion of the reaction. Linear fits were applied, and the initial rate (in fmol/min) was taken from the slope of this line (data not shown). The amplitude (maximum % duplex unwound) of duplex unwinding was determined by allowing the helicase reaction to proceed to completion (15 min). Both values may be used to make comparisons with respect to the ability of initiation factors to unwind duplex substrates. This method of comparison is valid since a direct linear correlation exists between either the initial rate or the amplitude of unwinding by initiation factors and duplex stability (ΔGvalue) for duplexes with stabilities between −17.9 kcal/mol and −24.7 kcal/mol (results of this report and Refs. 6Rogers Jr., G.W. Richter N.J. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12236-12244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar and 7Rogers Jr., G.W. Lima W.F. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12598-12608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). For the experiments in which the unwinding of modified duplexes (RNA/DNA, DNA/RNA, DNA/DNA, RNA/DNA-PS, and RNA/2′-MOE) were compared with those of RNA/RNA duplexes (Fig. 4), treatment of the data has been performed as follows. It has been demonstrated that for eIF4A alone, the initial rate or amplitude of unwinding RNA/RNA duplexes is directly related to the stability of the duplex, irrespective of its length (6Rogers Jr., G.W. Richter N.J. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12236-12244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar,7Rogers Jr., G.W. Lima W.F. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12598-12608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). This has also been demonstrated for RNA/DNA, DNA/RNA, and RNA/DNA-PS duplexes (7Rogers Jr., G.W. Lima W.F. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12598-12608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Thus, in order to compare the efficiency of unwinding of these modified duplexes by different combinations of initiation factors, the degree of unwinding must be corrected to account for slight differences in duplex stability. This allows for comparisons among modified duplex unwindings independent of their stabilities, and thus, only differences in the chemical composition of the duplex substrates that may affect the efficiency of unwinding are compared. Therefore, the normalized amplitude given for each duplex in Fig. 4 is a ratio of the amplitude of unwinding measured experimentallyversus the amplitude of unwinding that would be predicted for each duplex based on its stability (ΔG value).

To investigate whether other lineage-specific PG synthases also show preferential coupling with either COX isozyme, we introduced these enzymes alone or in combination into 293 cells to reconstitute their functional interrelationship. As did the membrane-bound PGE2 synthase, the perinuclear enzymes thromboxane synthase and PGI2 synthase generated their respective products via COX-2 in preference to COX-1 in both theA23187-induced immediate and interleukin-1-induced delayed responses. Hematopoietic PGD2 synthase preferentially used COX-1 and COX-2 in the A23187-induced immediate and interleukin-1-induced delayed PGD2-biosynthetic responses, respectively. This enzyme underwent stimulus-dependent translocation from the cytosol to perinuclear compartments, where COX-1 or COX-2 exists. COX selectivity of these lineage-specific PG synthases was also significantly affected by the concentrations of arachidonate, which was added exogenously to the cells or supplied endogenously by the action of cytosolic or secretory phospholipase A2. Collectively, the efficiency of coupling between COXs and specific PG synthases may be crucially influenced by their spatial and temporal compartmentalization and by the amount of arachidonate supplied by PLA2s at a moment when PG production takes place.

Generally, the constitutive COX-1 is mainly utilized in the immediate PG biosynthesis, which occurs within several minutes after stimulation with Ca2+ mobilizers, whereas the inducible COX-2 is an absolute requirement for delayed PG biosynthesis, which lasts for several hours after proinflammatory stimuli. When cells are first treated with proinflammatory stimuli and subsequently exposed to Ca2+ mobilizers, the induced COX-2 can also promote the immediate response (priming response) (3Murakami M.

However, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying the functional segregation between the two COXs are still obscure.

It has been suggested that the two COX isozymes are differently coupled with specific terminal PG synthases.

This finding has provided further support for the hypothesis that there is selective functional linkage between COX isozymes and terminal PG synthases. In this study, we have extended our coexpression approach to clarify diverse functional couplings between COXs and several other lineage-specific PG synthases (TXS, PGIS, and H-PGDS). Our results suggest that lineage-specific PG synthases are classified into three categories in terms of their localization and COX preference: (i) the perinuclear enzymes that prefer COX-2 (TXS, PGIS, and mPGES), (ii) the cytosolic enzyme that prefers COX-1 (cPGES), and (iii) the translocating enzyme that utilizes both COXs depending on the stimulus (H-PGDS). Alterations in AA supply through exogenous and endogenous routes significantly affects the coupling between COXs and terminal PG synthases.

Briefly, HEK293 cells (5 × 104/ml) were seeded into each well of 24- or 48-well plates in 1 ml and 0.5 ml of culture medium, respectively.

The toxins are structurally and functionally related, each being synthesized as a 150-kDa single polypeptide that is subsequently proteolytically cleaved to give a 50-kDa amino-terminal L-chain, disulfide bonded to a 100-kDa carboxyl-terminal H-chain (1Montecucco C.

Although tetanus and botulinum toxins bind at the nerve terminals of the neuromuscular motor junction they exhibit different clinical symptoms. BoNTs act locally at the peripheral nervous system by disrupting neurotransmitter release and causing flaccid paralysis. In contrast, TeNT activity occurs at the central nervous system, following retrograde transport from the axon terminal to inhibitory neurons within the spinal cord. Proteolytic cleavage of vesicle-associated membrane protein by TeNT L-chain blocks neurotransmitter release (3Schiavo G. Benfenati F. Poulain B. Rossetto O. de Laureto P.P. DasGupta B.R.

Photoaffinity labeling studies have implicated the area near residue His1293 as a site where ganglioside binds (31Shapiro R.E. Specht C.D. Collins B.E. Woods A.S. Cotter R.J. Schnaar R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30380-30386Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Our own studies on the crystal structure of TeNT HC complexed with lactose (Gal(β1–4)Glc) supports this association (28Emsley P. Fotinou C. Black I. Fairweather N.F. Charles I.G. Watts C. Hewitt E.

Further structural studies on HC crystals soaked in solutions containing the carbohydrate units of gangliosides (galactose,N-acetylgalactosamine and sialic acid) (28Emsley P. Fotinou C. Black I.

These results suggested that additional sites on the HC molecule may be involved in recognition of ganglioside receptors and that a single ganglioside could bind simultaneously to more than one TeNT molecule. Our attempts to crystallize a complex between TeNT HC and native GT1b ganglioside have not been successful. However, crystals could be grown of a complex formed between TeNT HC and a synthetic GT1b analogue. This analogue has the ceramide replaced by a 2-(trimethylsilyl)ethyl group and a β2–3 linkage from the disialic acid arm to the central galactose unit, i.e. Sia6 is the β-anomer (Fig. 1 b). The crystal structure of this complex shows cross-linking between the GT1b analogue and TeNT HC. The fully protected derivative of GT1b oligosaccharide (290 mg), compound 27 in Ishida et al.(32Ishida H.-K. Ishida H. Kiso M. Hasegawa A. Tetrahedron Asymmetry. 1994; 5: 2493-2512Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar), was converted into the desired product (87 mg, 53% in three steps) by hydrogenolytic removal of benzyl groups over Pd-C catalyst, de-O-acylation with sodium methoxide in methanol and subsequent saponification of methyl esters and lactone group by treatment with 0.2 m KOH. The product was purified using a Sephadex LH-20 (MeOH) column. TeNT HCprotein was prepared from Escherichia coli BL21 (pKS1) by induction with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to 1 mm for 4 h as described by Sinha et al.(33Sinha K. Box M. Lalli G. Schiavo G. Schneider H. Groves M. Siligardi G. Fairweather N. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 1041-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Cells were then harvested, lysed by sonication, and the HC protein purified by nickel affinity chromatography using Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen, Crawley, Sussex, United Kingdom) followed by gel-filtration on a Superdex-200 column. The protein was concentrated to 2.8 mg/ml using a 30,000 cutoff MicrocepTMmicroconcentrator (Pal Gelman Sciences) pretreated overnight with 10% glycerol to prevent nonspecific interactions of protein with the membrane. Protein (2.8 mg/ml) and the GT1b analogue (GT1b-βA) were mixed in a range of final molar ratios (1:2 to1:10). Crystals were produced from all mixtures by vapor diffusion against a 1-ml reservoir solution containing either 20% PEG 4K and 0.2m imidazole-malate (pH 7.0), or 20% PEG 8K, 0.2m Na2KPO4, and 0.1 mTRIS (pH 8.5) using a sitting drop containing 2 µl of the HC + heptasaccharide solution and 2 µl of reservoir solution. After a few days, plate-like crystals (thickness less than 10 µm) grew in the first conditions and rod-like crystals (thickness about 50 µm) in the second conditions. X-ray diffraction data from the plate-like crystals were collected at the ESRF microfocus beamline (ID13, λ = 0.782 Å) with a Mar CCD detector set at a distance of 170 mm from the crystal. With an initial exposure time of 5 s per frame, 40 frames were collected from a single crystal with intervals of 1° of rotation about an axis perpendicular to the x-ray beam. The crystal was then translated 4 times to reduce the effects of damage caused by the intense beam. Following the first translation 50 frames were collected with 5-s exposures; then 23 frames with 20-s exposures; then 20 frames with 10-s exposures and finally 40 frames, with 10-s exposures. Each frame covered 1° rotation of the crystal. Data from the rod-like crystal were collected at the Daresbury SRS, station 7.2 (λ = 1.488 Å) with a Mar240 image plate detector set at a distance of 173 mm from the crystal. An exposure at a 10,000 dose/frame and angular interval of 1° was used. 173 frames were collected from a single crystal. All data sets were collected under cryo-cooling conditions (100 K). The crystals were placed briefly in a well of cryo-protectant (15% PEG 400) then collected in a loop and flash-cooled in a stream of dry nitrogen at 100 K. Both crystal forms were monoclinic, space group P21, but the a cell dimension was doubled in the plate-like crystals, which contain two molecules in the asymmetric unit as a consequence.

After rigid body refinement of the protein (both crystal forms), several cycles of refinement using Refmac (35Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Cryst. Sec.

Omit maps were used for building ambiguous areas. The initial model and the restraints dictionary for the carbohydrate were generated using coordinates for the monosaccharide units of the ligand taken from the Cambridge Structural Data base (CSD) and the Protein Data Bank. β-Neuraminic acid (CSD code ANEU) was used for the β-anomeric sialic acid,N-acetyl-β-galactosamine (CSD code AOGAPY) forN-acetylgalactosamine, β-lactose (CSD code BLACTO) for galactose and glucose, and coordinates for α-anomeric sialic acid were taken from the structure of the complex of cholera toxin with GM1 ganglioside (Protein Data Bank ID 2chb (36Merritt E.A.

The protein structure geometry was analyzed using PROCHECK (38Laskowski R.A. Macarthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Cryst. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Buried surfaces were calculated using GRASP (39Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Proteins. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5315) Google Scholar) with a 1.4-Å probe radius. The initial three-dimensional model of GT1b-OS was constructed with the SWEET software (40Bohne A. Lang E. von der Lieth C.W. J. Mol. Model. 1998; 4: 33-43Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and superimposed on the GT1b-βA structure using LSQKAB (41Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta Cryst. Sec. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19748) Google Scholar). The fit was improved with cycles of manual adjustment to the glycosidic torsion angles of the GT1b-OS (QUANTA) followed by superposition with LSQKAB. Excluding Sia6, the r.m.s. difference between the overlapped oligosaccharides is 1.3 Å. No energy minimization was performed. The figures were prepared using SETOR (42Evans S.V. J. Mol. Graph. 1993; 11: 134-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar) and GRASP (39Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Proteins. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5315) Google Scholar) and were edited and composed using the GIMP (www.gimp.org/). The complex of HC + GT1b-βA crystallizes in two forms: one with two molecules in the asymmetric unit and the other with one. The final models of the two crystal forms of HCconsist of residues 865 to 1315 of TeNT and all the carbohydrate residues. The terminal 2-(trimethylsilyl)ethyl group is disordered in all copies of the ganglioside and is modeled with two conformations. The model in the larger cell has 240 waters and in the smaller cell 120 (Table I). For both forms 80% of the residues are in the most favored regions of the Ramachadran plot as defined by PROCHECK (38Laskowski R.A. Macarthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Cryst. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) and no residues are in the disallowed regions. The r.m.s. differences in the Cα atom positions of the three copies of the protein (excluding flexible loop residues 865–875, 937–945, 977–989, 1060–1070, 1177–1194, and 1201–1209), are 0.57, 0.62, and 0.60 Å for the pairs A and B, A and C, and B and C, respectively (Fig.3). The three independent copies of the protein in the two crystal forms provide the same general information on the HC-carbohydrate interactions. All have two binding sites on the HC molecule. One interacts with the Gal4-GalNAc3 and the other with Sia7-Sia6 moieties of different ganglioside molecules (Table II), so that the ganglioside acts as a cross-linker for the protein (Figs.4and5).Table IIPotential hydrogen bonds in the binding sites of HcGT1b-βA Sugar atomProtein atomCopy of protein moleculeABCCarbohydrate-protein interactionsGalNAc3O-4NE-21271His3.5(3.7)O-4OD-21222Asp2.53.02.9O-4OD-11222Asp(3.7)O-6OD-11222Asp3.02.9O-4ND-21219Asn2.42.8O-5ND-21219Asn3.3O-4ND-11271His3.5Gal4O-4ND-11271His3.42.73.4O-4CO1270Thr3.02.82.7O-5ND-11271His2.63.12.5O-6ND-11271His2.52.92.4O-6OD-11222Asp3.12.5O-6OD-21222Asp2.72.62.6Sia6O-4OD-21147Asp2-aThese residues belong to a symmetry related protein molecule.2.92.82.4O-4OD-11147Asp2-aThese residues belong to a symmetry related protein molecule.2.82.63.0N-5OD-11147Asp2-aThese residues belong to a symmetry related protein molecule.3.3N-5NH-21226Arg2-aThese residues belong to a symmetry related protein molecule.3.33.03.3O-10ND-21216Asn2-aThese residues belong to a symmetry related protein molecule.2.73.4O-10OD-11216Asn2-aThese residues belong to a symmetry related protein molecule.3.02.8Sia7O-1BNH-21226Arg2-aThese residues belong to a symmetry related protein molecule.2.93.32.8O-1ANH-11226Arg2-aThese residues belong to a symmetry related protein molecule.3.03.12.8O-1ANH1216Asn2-aThese residues belong to a symmetry related protein molecule.3.13.03.0O-1AOD-11216Asn2-aThese residues belong to a symmetry related protein molecule.3.3O-4CO1214Asp2-aThese residues belong to a symmetry related protein molecule.2.42.42.5O-8OH1229Tyr2-aThese residues belong to a symmetry related protein molecule.2.43.03.2Intra-carbohydrate interactionsGlc1 O-6Gal2 O-13.2Gal2 O-6GalNAc3 O-53.1Gal2 O-6GalNAc3 O-13.33.3GalNAc3 O-7Gal4 O-23.4Gal4 O-2Sia5 O-63.23.53.5Sia6 O-9Sia6 O-1B2.5We consider distances between donor-acceptor smaller or equal to 3.5 Å as potential hydrogen bonds, although we list in parentheses the distances larger than 3.5 Å.2-a These residues belong to a symmetry related protein molecule.

The Gal-GalNAc-binding site is a narrow groove formed by the side chains of residues Trp1289and His1271 with Tyr1290 forming the base (Fig.6a). On one side of the groove, Trp1289 packs against His1293, while on the other His1271 packs against Phe1218. A hydrogen bond (3.5 Å in molecule A; 3.4 Å in molecule B; 3.5 Å in molecule C) from His1293 ND1 to the main chain carbonyl of Trp1289 contributes in holding the Trp in position. Tyr1290 forms only hydrophobic contacts. The location of His1293 is in agreement with photoaffinity labeling studies that place it close to a GD1b-binding site (31Shapiro R.E. Specht C.D. Collins B.E. Woods A.S. Cotter R.J. Schnaar R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30380-30386Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This is also the site where lactose binds to HC (28Emsley P.

The Gal4-GalNAc3 units of the oligosaccharide interact extensively with this site. The hydrophobic faces of both sugar rings are stacked against the indole ring of Trp1289 and the polar faces are hydrogen bonded to the protein (Table II). There are some differences in the number of hydrogen bonds found in the three copies of the complexes (Table II) but because of the resolution of the structures the significance of these differences is uncertain. Common hydrogen bonds are formed between the side chain of His1271 and OH-6, OH-4 and O-5 of Gal4 and between the main chain carbonyl oxygen of Thr1270and OH-4 of Gal4. GalNAc3 interacts via a hydrogen bond between OH-4 and Asp1222 OD and between OH-4 and His1271. The stacking of the hydrophobic face of galactose against aromatic rings and the involvement of OH-4 in specificity determination are common characteristics in carbohydrate-protein interactions (43Rini J.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1995; 24: 551-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 44Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 441-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). There are also water-mediated hydrogen bonds that are not common in all copies. The buried surface area between protein and carbohydrate for the Gal4-GalNAc3-binding site is 694, 740, and 700 Å2 for copies A, B, and C, respectively. This binding site is a shallow pocket, involving residues Arg1226, Asn1216, Asp1214, Asp1147, and Tyr1229 in interactions with the disialic acid moiety (Fig.6 b). The shape of the binding site and the mode of sialic acid-protein interactions corresponds to the second class described by Stehle and Harrison (45Stehle T. Harrison S.C. The EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5139-5148Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) (one side of the sialic acid ring is in contact with the protein, O-4 is exposed and the glycerol group interacts with the protein).

Elevated plasma fibrinogen levels are associated with coronary heart diseases. Fibrates are clinically used hypolipidemic drugs that act via the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα). In addition, most fibrates also reduce plasma fibrinogen levels, but the molecular mechanism is unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that fibrates decrease basal and IL-6-stimulated expression of the human fibrinogen-β gene in human primary hepatocytes and hepatoma HepG2 cells. Fibrates diminish basal and IL-6-induced fibrinogen-β promoter activity, and this effect is enhanced in the presence of co-transfected PPARα. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments demonstrate that PPARα activators decrease human fibrinogen-β promoter activity via the CCAAT box/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) response element. Co-transfection of the transcriptional intermediary factor glucocorticoid receptor-interacting protein 1/transcriptional intermediary factor 2 (GRIP1/TIF2) enhances fibrinogen-β gene transcription and alleviates the repressive effect of PPARα. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate that PPARα and GRIP1/TIF2 physically interact in vivo in human liver. These data demonstrate that PPARα agonists repress human fibrinogen gene expression by interference with the C/EBPβ pathway through titration of the coactivator GRIP1/TIF2. We observed that the anti-inflammatory action of PPARα is not restricted to fibrinogen but also applies to other acute phase genes containing a C/EBP response element; it also occurs under conditions in which the stimulating action of IL-6 is potentiated by dexamethasone. These findings identify a novel molecular mechanism of negative gene regulation by PPARα and reveal the direct implication of PPARα in the modulation of the inflammatory gene response in the liver.

Fibrinogen is synthesized in hepatocytes and secreted into the blood as a dimeric molecule, with each half composed of three nonidentical polypeptides (Aα, Bβ, and γ) linked by disulfide bonds. The three polypeptides are encoded by three distinct genes clustered on the long arm of chromosome 4 (4Kant J.A. Fornace A.J. Saxe D. Simon M.I. McBride O.W. Crabtree G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Induction of fibrinogen biosynthesis in response to trauma and inflammation is mainly mediated by IL-6 and occurs at the transcriptional level. In humans, fibrinogen-β-chain synthesis is considered to be the rate-limiting chain for assembly and secretion of mature fibrinogen (13Roy S.N. Mukhopadhyay G. Redman C.M. J. Biol.

The first element is an IL-6 response element, and the second is a binding site for the CCAAT box/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) family of transcription factors. These two distinct elements are both required for maximal induction by IL-6. Among drugs affecting plasma fibrinogen levels, fibric acid derivatives are reported as negative regulators of fibrinogen (16Sirtori C.R. Colli S. Cardiovasc. Drugs Ther. 1993; 7: 823Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The rationale behind the use of fibrates in reducing cardiovascular events is based on their ability to attenuate hypertriglyceridemia and hypercholesterolemia, both of which are established risk factors for cardiovascular diseases (17Hokanson J.E.

Gonzalez F.J. Princen H.M.G. Kooistra T. Staels B. Blood. 1999; 93: 2991-2998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but the exact molecular mechanism remained unresolved. PPARα belongs to the PPAR subfamily of nuclear receptors that activate gene expression in response to ligands following dimerization with the retinoid X receptor. PPAR/retinoid X receptor heterodimers bind to specific sequences localized in the promoter region of target genes termed peroxisome proliferator response elements. Several lines of evidence suggest that in addition to their hypolipidemic effect (21Staels B. Dallongeville J. Auwerx J. Schoonjans K. Leitersdorf E. Fruchart J.-C. Circulation. 1998; 98: 2088-2093Crossref PubMed Scopus (1426) Google Scholar), fibrates may exert direct anti-atherogenic activity through an anti-inflammatory activity at the level of the vascular wall. For instance, several clinical studies, such as BECAIT and LOCAT, revealed that fibrate treatment causes a slower progression of coronary atherosclerosis that is independent of any significant lowering of atherogenic lipoprotein concentrations (22Frick M.H. Syvanne M. Nieminen M.S. Kauma H. Majahalme S. Virtanen V. Kesaniemi Y.A. Pasternack A. Taskinen M.R. Circulation. 1997; 96: 2137-2143Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar,23Ruotolo G.

Furthermore, it has been reported that fibrates decrease plasma concentrations of inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor α and IL-6, in patients with angiographically established atherosclerosis (24Madej A.

Interestingly, PPARα has been demonstrated to act as a negative regulator of the vascular inflammatory gene response by antagonizing the activity of the transcription factors NF-κB and AP-1 (26Delerive P. De Bosscher K. Besnard S. Vanden Berghe W. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Fruchart J.-C. Tedgui A. Haegeman G. Staels B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32048-32054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar). In line with these findings, PPARα knockout mice exhibit a prolonged inflammatory response compared with wild type mice (27Devchand P.R. Keller H. Peters J.M. Vazquez M. Gonzalez F.J. Wahli W. Nature. 1996; 384: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (1214) Google Scholar). In the present work, we delineated the molecular mechanism of fibrinogen gene regulation in more detail, and we extended our previous observations in rodents to the human situation. We demonstrate that the nuclear receptor PPARα is also crucial for the negative regulation of the human fibrinogen-β gene expression by PPARα agonists and that this occurs under both basal and inflammatory conditions. Evidence is provided that the suppressive effect of PPARα requires the integrity of the C/EBP response element and is independent of the IL-6 response element. PPARα does not interact directly with C/EBP. Instead, we found that transcriptional intermediary factor glucocorticoid receptor-interacting protein 1/transcriptional intermediary factor 2 (GRIP1/TIF2) is a novel positive regulator of fibrinogen-β transcription and that the sequestration of GRIP1/TIF2 by PPARα constitutes a molecular mechanism by which negative regulation of fibrinogen-β by PPARα agonists takes place. Finally, we observed that the PPARα inhibitory effect may be extended to acute phase response genes other than the fibrinogen-β gene. Fenofibric acid was a kind gift of Dr. A. Edgar (Laboratoires Fournier, Daix, France); ciprofibrate and bezafibrate were from Sanofi-Synthelabo (Aramon, France) and Roche Molecular Biochemicals, respectively. Wy 14,643 was from Chemsyn (Lenexa, KS). Human recombinant IL-6 was purchased from Tebu (Le Perray-en-Yvelines, France). Dexamethasone was from Sigma. Human hepatocytes, isolated by collagenase perfusion, and HepG2 cells, obtained from the European Collection of Animal Cell Culture (Porton Down, Salisbury, United Kingdom) were cultured exactly as described previously (28Staels B. Vu-Dac N. Kosykh V.A. Saladin R. Fruchart J.-C. Dallongeville J. Auwerx J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 705-712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fibrinogen concentrations in conditioned medium were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay procedure as previously described (20Kockx M. Gervois P. Poulain P. Derudas B. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Princen H.M.G. Kooistra T. Staels B. Blood. 1999; 93: 2991-2998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA extraction and Northern blot analysis were performed as described (29Staels B. Auwerx J. Development. 1992; 115: 1035-1043PubMed Google Scholar) using a 1930-base pairEcoRI/PstI fragment of the human fibrinogen-β and human acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein 36B4 (30Masiakowski P. Breathnach R. Bloch J. Gannon F. Krust A. Chambon P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 7895-7903Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar) cDNA probes. Probes for human fibrinogen-α, fibrinogen-γ, and serum amyloid A were generated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. pSG5-hPPARα and pSG5-hPPARαΔLBD were described previously (31Gervois P. Pineda Torra I. Chinetti G. Grotzinger T. Dubois G. Fruchart J.-C. Fruchart-Najib J. Leitersdorf E. Staels B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1535-1549PubMed Google Scholar). phFib-β was generated by amplification and cloning of a 400-base pair genomic fragment corresponding to nucleotides –400 to +13 of the human fibrinogen-β promoter pGL3 reporter vector. Specific mutations in either the IL-6 or C/EBPβ response elements previously described (8Dalmon J. Laurent M. Courtois G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1183-1193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the quick mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and phFib-β as template, giving rise to phFib-β M1 and phFib-β M3 plasmids, respectively. HepG2 cells were transiently transfected using the calcium phosphate precipitation method with reporter and expression plasmids, as stated in the figure legends. The total amount of DNA was kept constant by complementation with corresponding empty vector mock DNA. After a 4-h incubation period, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and refed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.2% fetal calf serum and Wy 14,643 or vehicle and IL-6 as indicated in the figure legends. Cells were harvested after 24-h incubation and collected for the determination of the luciferase activity performed using a luciferase assay system (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). HepG2 cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, scraped off in 1 ml of ice-cold PBS, and collected by centrifugation for 5 min at 500 × g at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium desoxycholate, 0.1% SDS in PBS), protease inhibitors were freshly added (5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, 5 mg/ml EDTA-Na2, 1 mmbenzamidine, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and the suspension was vigorously vortexed. The cell extract was centrifuged (5 min at 10,000 ×g and 4 °C), and the supernatant was transferred to new tubes, aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C. Electrophoresis of samples was performed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Minigel system, Bio-Rad) under reducing conditions (10 mm dithiothreitol). Proteins were blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 10% skim milk powder diluted in TNT buffer (20 mm Tris, 55 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween), overnight at 4 °C. The membrane was probed with primary antibody diluted in 5% skim milk-TNT for 4 h at room temperature. Membrane was washed and incubated with peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody, followed by a subsequent six washes of 10 min. The bands were visualized using SuperSignal® West Dura substrate. 0.5 μg of GST-GRIP1/TIF2(536–1121) bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads was incubated with 5 μl of in vitro synthesized [35S]methionine-labeled protein in the presence or absence of 100 μm Wy-14643 (dissolved in Me2SO) in a total volume of 200 μl of incubation buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml of each aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin) and gently rotated at 4 °C. After centrifugation, the beads were washed four times for 15 min with incubation buffer without bovine serum albumin, resuspended in 30 μl of 1× Laemmli buffer, boiled for 5 min, and centrifuged. The supernatant was loaded on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel. After drying the gel, input and bound proteins were analyzed with a phosphorimager apparatus equipped with ImageQuant software. For binding of endogenous hPPARα to GRIP1/TIF2 a freshly isolated piece of human liver of about 1 g was homogenized in ice-cold PBS containing proteinase inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and stored at −80 °C. Thawed homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min to recover soluble proteins. Samples were diluted 10-fold in PBS/protease inhibitors and rotated at 4 °C for 6 h in the presence of 4 μg/ml primary rabbit anti-hPPARα antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or rabbit preimmune serum, respectively. Complexes were immunoprecipitated by antibody/protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 4 °C for 2 h and washed once in PBS/protease inhibitors and three times in protease inhibitor-containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 170 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaF. Co-immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting. The regulation of fibrinogen biosynthesis is mainly transcriptional and is stimulated by IL-6. Fibrinogen-β is considered the rate-limiting chain for fibrinogen biosynthesis. Therefore, we studied the effect of fibrates on the regulation of human fibrinogen-β expression in primary hepatocytes under basal and IL-6-induced conditions. In the absence of IL-6, basal fibrinogen mRNA levels were decreased by treatment with fenofibric acid, whereas control 36B4 mRNA was unaffected (Fig.1). The addition of IL-6 led to enhanced expression of fibrinogen-β mRNA. When cells were treated with both IL-6 and fenofibric acid, fibrinogen expression was strongly lowered. In order to check whether this inhibitory effect is not restricted to fenofibric acid, fibrinogen-β expression was analyzed in HepG2 cells treated with various other fibrates for 24 h. Treatment with each fibrate resulted in a down-regulation of fibrinogen-β expression in both the presence and the absence of IL-6 (Fig.2 a). The lowering effect also occurred at the protein level because secretion of fibrinogen was diminished by fibrate treatment; it also occurred in the presence of IL-6 (Fig. 2 b). Treatment of HepG2 cells with increasing concentrations of Wy 14,643 resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of basal and IL-6-induced fibrinogen-β mRNA levels (Fig. 3). These experiments demonstrate that PPARα agonists suppress human fibrinogen-β mRNA levels and fibrinogen secretion under both basal and IL-6-stimulated conditions.Figure 3Dose-dependent effect of Wy 14,643 on fibrinogen expression in HepG2 cells. Cells were treated for 3 h with increasing concentrations of Wy 14,643 (3, 10, 30, and 100 μm) and stimulated for 21 h or not with IL-6 (25 ng/ml) as indicated. Total RNA (10 μg) was subjected to Northern blot analysis using human fibrinogen-β (top panel) or 36B4 (bottom panel) cDNA probes. DMSO,Me2SO.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To elucidate whether fibrates can suppress the expression of the fibrinogen-β-chain gene at the transcriptional level, a 400-base pair promoter fragment of the human fibrinogen-β gene, which contains the essential regulatory elements for basal and inducible promoter activity (8Dalmon J. Laurent M. Courtois G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1183-1193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was cloned in front of a luciferase reporter gene giving rise to phFib-β. This reporter construct was transiently transfected into HepG2 cells that were subsequently treated with different fibrates in the presence or absence of IL-6. As shown in Fig.4 a, basal promoter activity decreased when cells were treated with fibrates and was enhanced 6-fold when cells were incubated with IL-6. Furthermore, prior treatment of the cells with fibrates resulted in a consistent inhibition of fibrinogen-β transcription induced by IL-6 (Fig. 4 a). Co-transfection of PPARα reduced fibrinogen-β promoter activity in both control and IL-6-treated cells, an effect that was further enhanced by the presence of Wy 14,643 (Fig. 4 b). These results indicate that the repressive effect of fibrates on human fibrinogen-β expression occurs at the transcriptional level through activation of PPARα. IL-6 induction of fibrinogen-β promoter is mediated by two distinct cis-acting elements (7Anderson G.M. Shaw A.R. Shafer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22650-22655Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Dalmon J. Laurent M. Courtois G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1183-1193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One of these elements is an IL-6 response element (RE)-like site, and the other is a consensus binding site for members of the C/EBP family of transcription factors. To delineate whether one of these elements is involved in PPARα-mediated repression of fibrinogen-β gene transcription, we performed transient transfection experiments using the 400-base pair fibrinogen promoter reporter constructs carrying mutations in either the C/EBPβ or IL-6 response elements (Fig. 5). As described above, phFib-β activity was repressed by activated PPARα in both the presence and absence of IL-6. Mutation of the IL-6 RE core site in the fibrinogen-β promoter construct (phFib-β M1) led to a decreased basal transcriptional activity and to a loss of IL-6 responsiveness. Furthermore, its activity was unaffected by activated PPARα. Mutation in the C/EBP binding site of fibrinogen-β promoter (phFib-β M3) resulted in a weaker basal transcriptional activity and in a diminished IL-6 inducibility. Interestingly, activated PPARα did not influence transcriptional activity of phFib-β M3 in either the absence or presence of IL-6. These results point to a crucial role of the IL6-RE in both basal and IL-6-induced fibrinogen-β promoter activity, whereas the C/EBP binding site alone does not respond to IL-6 but rather controls the overall transcriptional activity. Furthermore, PPARα does not interfere directly with the IL-6 pathway but diminishes the overall activity of fibrinogen-β promoter by antagonizing C/EBPβ-mediated activation of fibrinogen-β gene transcription. To determine whether PPARα could directly interfere with the C/EBPβ-mediated activation of fibrinogen-β transcription, we analyzed the effect of PPARα on C/EBPβ-induced fibrinogen-β promoter activity. As described above, overexpression of PPARα decreases basal and IL-6-induced activity of fibrinogen-β promoter, an effect that was enhanced in the presence of Wy 14,643 (Fig.6). Transfection of C/EBPβ resulted in a 3-fold induction of basal fibrinogen-β promoter activity, and luciferase activity was further increased upon addition of IL-6. In the absence of IL-6, co-transfection of a constant amount of C/EBPβ and increasing amounts of PPARα led to a dose-dependent inhibition of fibrinogen-β transactivation, an effect that was amplified by the presence of Wy 14,643 (Fig. 6). Interestingly, PPARα also repressed in a dose-dependent manner fibrinogen-β transcriptional activity induced by C/EBPβ in the presence of IL-6 stimulation. Again, this action of PPARα was much more pronounced in the presence of Wy 14,643. Taken together, these results demonstrate that PPARα counteracts C/EBPβ-induced activation of the fibrinogen-β promoter. Next, we addressed the question whether PPARα inhibits C/EBP induction of fibrinogen-β promoter activity through direct protein-protein interaction or by competition for a common co-factor. Because GST fusion protein pull-down assays and yeast two hybrid analysis failed to detect a direct interaction between PPARγ and C/EBPα as reported by Hollenberg et al.(36Hollenberg A.N. Susulic V.S. Madura J.P. Zhang B. Moller D.E. Tontonoz P. Sarraf P. Spiegelman B.M. Lowel B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5283-5290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), it is unlikely that PPARα and C/EBPβ directly interact. Therefore, we hypothesized that interference with coactivator might be a mechanism of gene repression by PPARα. Interestingly, a member of the TIF family has been previously identified as a co-factor interacting with both C/EBP and glucocorticoid receptor to regulate expression of the α1-acid glycoprotein gene, another acute phase protein (32Chang C.J. Chen Y.L. Lee S.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5880-5887Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, GRIP1/TIF2 has been described as a transcriptional mediator for the ligand-dependent activation function of nuclear receptors (33Voegel J.J. Heine M.J. Zechel C. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3667-3675Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). We first analyzed whether fibrinogen-β transcriptional activity could be affected by GRIP1/TIF2. Transfection of GRIP1/TIF2 in HepG2 cells increased fibrinogen-β reporter activity and enhanced stimulation of fibrinogen transcription in the presence of IL-6 (Fig.7 A). GRIP1/TIF2 had no effect on fibrinogen-β promoter mutated in its C/EBP binding site (phFib-β M3), showing that C/EBP binding site integrity is required. To investigate whether GRIP1/TIF2 plays a role in PPARα-mediated repression of fibrinogen transcription, GRIP1/TIF2 and PPARα expression were co-transfected together with the fibrinogen-β reporter vector. Wy 14,643 treatment failed to repress transcription when GRIP1/TIF2 was overexpressed (Fig. 7 B). In addition, co-transfection of increasing amounts of GRIP1/TIF2 expression vector with a constant amount of PPARα expression vector led to the abolishment of PPARα inhibitory effect on fibrinogen-β transactivation; this also occurred in the presence of PPARα ligand. Transfected cell extract subjected to electrophoresis demonstrated that the abolishment of PPARα action by GRIP1/TIF2 was not linked to an indirect effect on PPARα expression vector (Fig.7 C). These data highlight that GRIP1/TIF2 potentiates C/EBP-mediated fibrinogen-β transcription and strongly suggest that PPARα exerts its repressive effect through titration of this co-factor. To evaluate whether sequestration of GRIP1/TIF2 by PPARα also occurs under physiological conditions, association between endogenous proteins expressed at physiological levels in regular human hepatocytes was assessed by co-immunoprecipitation. Endogenous PPARα-GRIP1/TIF2 complexes were precipitated from human liver protein extracts (Fig.8 a). Specific co-immunoprecipitation of GRIP1/TIF2 was detected by anti-GRIP1/TIF2 Western blot when anti-PPARα but not control antibody was used for precipitation (Fig. 8 a). We also performed in vitro experiments to investigate whether protein-protein interaction between PPARα and GRIP1/TIF2 is ligand-dependent. GST pull-down experiments revealed that interaction between GRIP1/TIF2 and PPARα is enhanced in the presence of PPARα ligand (Fig. 8 b), which is in agreement with the transfection results. Because PPARα ligands can potentiate the interaction between PPARα and GRIP1/TIF2, we analyzed whether PPARα ligand binding domain (LBD) is required for the transcriptional repression of fibrinogen-β promoter activity by PPARα. We therefore compared the activity of wild type PPARα with that of the recently identified PPARα truncated isoform (31Gervois P. Pineda Torra I. Chinetti G. Grotzinger T. Dubois G. Fruchart J.-C. Fruchart-Najib J. Leitersdorf E. Staels B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1535-1549PubMed Google Scholar) lacking the entire LBD (PPARα-ΔLBD) on fibrinogen-β transcription. Transcriptional activity of fibrinogen-β was not affected by co-transfection of PPARα-ΔLBD, in contrast to PPARα wild type (data not shown). Altogether, these experiments demonstrate that PPARα negatively regulates fibrinogen-β through sequ"

Using a recently reported cDNA sequence for a carotene cleavage enzyme fromDrosophila, we identified a cDNA encoding a mouse homolog of this enzyme. When the cDNA was expressed in eitherEscherichia coli or Chinese hamster ovary cells, expression conferred upon bacterial and Chinese hamster ovary cell homogenates the ability to cleave β-carotene to retinal.

This was confirmed by pull-down experiments upon incubation of recombinant enzyme with tissue 12,000 ×g supernatants. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-mass spectrometry analysis of pulled-down proteins indicates that an atypical testis-specific isoform of lactate dehydrogenase associates with recombinant carotene cleavage enzyme. mRNA transcripts for the carotene cleavage enzyme were detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction in mouse testes, liver, kidney, and intestine.

All-trans- and 9-cis-retinoic acid are responsible for regulating transcription of well over 300 genes. The transcriptional actions of retinoids are mediated through the retinoic acid receptor and retinoid X receptor classes of ligand-dependent transcription factors (3Mangelsdorf D. Umesono K. Evans R.

Although retinoids have many essential physiologic actions within the body, animals are incapable of the de novo synthesis of retinoids. Thus, all naturally occurring retinoids must be derived from carotenoids that are synthesized in plants or photosynthetic microorganisms from terpenoid precursors (7Vieira A. Subcell. Biochem. 1998; 30: 29-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). There are more than 600 carotenoids that can be present in human diets, but only about 10% of these can be converted to retinoids (8Olson J.A. Machlin L.J. Handbook of Vitamins. 2nd Ed.

Through studies carried out in the 1960s, it was established that this conversion, termed carotene cleavage, is catalyzed by the enzyme carotene 15,15′-dioxygenase (11Goodman D.S. Huang H.S.

Nutr. 1996; 126: 499-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Because carotene 15,15′-dioxygenase lost enzymatic activity when attempts were made to purify it from cytosol fractions, details regarding the biochemical properties of this enzyme(s) have remained elusive. The identification and cloning of a carotene cleavage enzyme from maize mutants (34Schwartz S.H. Tan B.C. Gage D.A. Zeevaart J.A. McCarty D.R. Science. 1997; 276: 1872-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar) several years ago facilitated the recent cloning of a cDNA from D. melanogaster that, upon expression in bacteria, catalyzed β-carotene cleavage to retinal (22von Lintig J. Vogt K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11915-11920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). By sequence homology analysis employing the published sequence for this DrosophilacDNA, we have identified a cDNA that is expressed in adult mouse intestine, liver, kidney, and testis and maternal tissues during embryogenesis and which encodes a 64-kDa protein possessing carotene 15,15′-dioxygenase activity.When this mouse cDNA was expressed in either bacteria or CHO cells that lack endogenous carotene cleavage activity, expression of the cDNA conferred the activity on the bacterial and CHO cell homogenates (Fig. 2). All-trans-retinal along with some 13-cis-retinal (always <10% of all-trans-retinal) were the sole products that could be detected upon incubation of all-trans-β-carotene with the recombinant protein. The 13-cis-retinal likely arises as an isomerization product of all-trans-retinal produced upon all-trans-β-carotene cleavage because the concentration of 13-cis-retinal detected was directly dependent on the amount of all-trans-retinal produced upon β-carotene cleavage. HPLC peaks suggesting the presence of apocarotenals in extracts from incubation mixtures were not observed. These data indicate that cleavage of the β-carotene occurs primarily at the central 15,15′-carbon-carbon double bond. Unexpectedly, the dependence of reaction velocity for the recombinant dioxygenase showed a sigmoidal relationship with β-carotene concentration. Our kinetic data best fit the Hill equation. Analysis of the data gave rise to aK 0.5 for β-carotene of 0.95 µm, a V max of 368 pmol/mg/h, and a Hill coefficient of 0.659. As far as we are aware, the early literature on the kinetic properties of carotene 15,15′-dioxygenase indicates that the enzyme displays a hyperbolic relationship between reaction velocity and substrate concentration, with reported apparent K mvalues ranging from 0.52 to 9.5 µm and reportedV max values ranging from 23.8 to 1,300 pmol/mg protein/h (13Goodman D.

We do not understand the basis for this discrepancy between our kinetic data obtained using recombinant enzyme and data obtained by early investigators employing partially purified enzyme preparations. However, in keeping with this early literature, the recombinant mouse dioxygenase was markedly inhibited by the chelating agents o-phenanthroline and α,α′-bipyridyl, but to a much lesser degree by EDTA (Fig. 4). This observation is consistent with the reported properties of partially purified intestinal carotene cleavage enzyme obtained from hog, rabbit, and guinea pig (13Goodman D. Huang H. Kanai M. Shiratori T. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 3543-3554Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 39Singh H. Cama H.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 370: 49-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In this regard, the mammalian carotene 15,15′-dioxygenase may be different from the Drosophilaenzyme, which was strongly inhibited by 10 mm EDTA (22von Lintig J. Vogt K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11915-11920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Taken together, these date support the conclusion that we have identified a murine cDNA that encodes an enzyme that possesses catalytic properties that are very similar to those originally reported for mammalian carotene 15,15′-dioxygenase.Our attempts to purify catalytically active recombinant mouse carotene 15,15′-dioxygenase-GST fusion protein to homogeneity from bacterial homogenates were unsuccessful. As proved to be the case for early attempts to purify carotene 15,15′-dioxygenase from tissue sources, the purified dioxygenase rapidly lost catalytic activity. However, the activity of the purified recombinant dioxygenase was quickly restored upon addition of either the 12,000 × g supernatant from homogenates of bacteria transformed with empty pGEX-3X vector or the 12,000 × g supernatant from sham transfected CHO cell homogenates that do not express carotene 15,15′-dioxygenase mRNA. Thus, it appears that a protein(s) present in these supernatants is responsible for this effect and that the activating factor(s) was both nondialyzable and heat-labile. It is possible that such interactions are significant for maintaining or facilitating the physiologic actions of carotene 15,15′-dioxygenase, but this remains to be established conclusively by further investigations.Based on the observations regarding the need of the recombinant carotene cleavage enzyme for other protein factors to maintain its activity and on the kinetic data that suggest complex interactions between the β-carotene and the protein species that catalyze its cleavage to retinal, we investigated by pull-down assay the possibility that recombinant dioxygenase-GST fusion protein interacts with other proteins present in tissues. SDS-PAGE analysis of pull-down assays employing the 12,000 × g supernatant from mouse testis, the tissue with the highest level of carotene 15,15′-dioxygenase expression (see Fig. 5 A), showed a major protein species that copurified with the dioxygenase-GST fusion protein bound to glutathione-Sepharose. MALDI-MS analysis of the protein excised from the SDS-PAGE gel identified the protein as an atypical testis-specific LDH-C. LDH-C was originally identified in the 1960s and demonstrated to catalyze the reversible oxidation of lactate and other secondary alcohols (45Thomas K. Del Mazo J. Eversole P. Bellve A. Hiraoka Y. Li S.S. Simon M. Development. 1990; 109: 483-493PubMed Google Scholar, 46Blanco A. Burgos C. Gerez de Burgos N.M. Montamat E.E. Biochem. J. 1976; 153: 165-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, the physiologic role of this enzyme has often been questioned because the other widely distributed lactate dehydrogenase species (LDH-A and LDH-B) are both highly expressed in the testis (45Thomas K. Del Mazo J. Eversole P. Bellve A. Hiraoka Y. Li S.S. Simon M. Development. 1990; 109: 483-493PubMed Google Scholar, 46Blanco A. Burgos C. Gerez de Burgos N.M. Montamat E.E. Biochem. J. 1976; 153: 165-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We are unable to find in the literature any information as to whether LDH-C will catalyze either the oxidation or the reduction of aldehydes like retinal, the product of β-carotene cleavage. If LDH-C can catalyze either retinal reduction to retinol or retinal oxidation to retinoic acid, this would suggest that carotene 15,15′-dioxygenase acts physiologically in concert with other proteins involved in retinoid metabolism. We are presently investigating this possibility.The tissue pattern of carotene 15,15′-dioxygenase mRNA expression in the mouse is somewhat surprising (Fig. 5). This expression pattern does not overlap fully with carotene 15,15′-dioxygenase activity levels reported in early studies, which indicate that the highest specific activity level of carotene 15,15′-dioxygenase is present in small intestine followed by the liver, brain, lung, and kidney (20During A. Nagao A. Hoshino C. Terao J. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 241: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 5, dioxygenase mRNA expression is relatively low in the mouse small intestine compared with testis, liver, and kidney. This may be attributed to species differences between the mouse and the rat (and other mammalian species) because the published studies of tissue activity levels have not employed mouse small intestine as a source of enzyme activity. Moreover, the literature indicates that carotene 15,15′-dioxygenase activity is limited to only the proximal portion of the small intestine, including the duodenum and part of jejunum (8Olson J.A. Machlin L.J. Handbook of Vitamins. 2nd Ed. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1991: 1-57Google Scholar, 15Duszka C. Grolier P. Azim E.M. Alexandre-Gouabau M.C. Borel P. Azais-Braesco V. J. Nutr. 1996; 126: 2550-2556Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar,40Thompson S. Braude R. Coates M. Cowie A. Ganguly J. Kon S. Br. J. Nutr. 1950; 4: 398-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and is present only in mature functional enterocytes within these anatomic regions (18Tajima S. Goda T. Takase S. Life Sci. 1999; 65: 841-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Because we were concerned about the possible rapid degradation of intestinal RNA, as a source of intestinal total RNA we employed the entire small intestine without first separating the mucosal lining. This may also have contributed to the apparent relatively low levels of dioxygenase mRNA in the mouse small intestine having the effect of diluting the dioxygenase mRNA in the total RNA pool. Alternatively, the enzyme encoded by the cDNA isolated from a kidney library may be distinct from the one studied earlier in intestinal homogenates. However, this possibility seems unlikely because the biochemical characteristics of the recombinant enzyme strongly resemble those reported for carotene 15,15′-dioxygenase preparations from intestine. The relatively high level of dioxygenase mRNA expression in testes was also unexpected. There are reports in the literature that β-carotene accumulates in the testes in humans and ferrets (41Stahl W. Schwarz W. Sundquist A.R. Sies H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 294: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 42Lakshman M.R. Liu Q.H. Sapp R. Somanchi M. Sundaresan P.R. Nutr. Cancer. 1996; 26: 49-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). It is possible that this testicular β-carotene may serve as a previously unrecognized source of retinoid for maintaining testis function.The presence of carotene 15,15′-dioxygenase mRNA, at days 7.5 and 8.5 of mouse embryogenesis, in maternal tissue at the site of embryo implantation suggests that this enzyme may be acting to provide needed retinoid to the embryo. The anatomic site of dioxygenase expression appears to coincide with the region of the uterus which may be important in nutrient exchange. Thus, the presence of carotene cleavage activity in this maternal tissue would be consistent with the notion that maternal carotene cleavage to retinoid is an important mechanism through which the developing embryo can acquire retinoid that is needed for directing gene expression during developmental processes (43Blaner W. Piantedosi R. Sykes A. Vogel S. Nau H. Blaner W.S. Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology. Springer, Berlin1999: 117-149Google Scholar).In summary, we have identified a mouse kidney cDNA that encodes a 64-kDa protein that catalyzes the cleavage of β-carotene to retinalin vitro. The recombinant enzyme possesses most of the biochemical properties that have been reported for mammalian intestinal carotene 15,15′-dioxygenases. Based on our characterizations, we suggest that the protein encoded by this cDNA is indeed the same enzyme that was first described in the 1960s as carotene 15,15′-dioxygenase. This identification raises new possibilities for extending our understanding of both the biochemistry of this enzyme and the biochemical processes that are important for carotenoid processing and retinoid formation in vivo. Retinoids play an indispensable role in maintaining the health of higher animals (1Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids: Biology, Chemistry, and Medicine. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, New York1994Google Scholar). In vision, 11-cis-retinaldehyde serves as the chromophore for the visual pigment rhodopsin (2Saari J.C. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids: Biology, Chemistry, and Medicine. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, New York1994: 351-385Google Scholar). Aside from this action in vision, retinoids act primarily as transcriptional regulators. All-trans- and 9-cis-retinoic acid are responsible for regulating transcription of well over 300 genes. The transcriptional actions of retinoids are mediated through the retinoic acid receptor and retinoid X receptor classes of ligand-dependent transcription factors (3Mangelsdorf D. Umesono K. Evans R. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids: Biology, Chemistry, and Medicine. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, New York1994: 319-349Google Scholar, 4Chambon P.

Nutr. 1992; 12: 443-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Although retinoids have many essential physiologic actions within the body, animals are incapable of the de novo synthesis of retinoids. Thus, all naturally occurring retinoids must be derived from carotenoids that are synthesized in plants or photosynthetic microorganisms from terpenoid precursors (7Vieira A. Subcell. Biochem. 1998; 30: 29-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). There are more than 600 carotenoids that can be present in human diets, but only about 10% of these can be converted to retinoids (8Olson J.A. Machlin L.J. Handbook of Vitamins. 2nd Ed. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1991: 1-57Google Scholar, 9Rock C.L. Pharmacol. Ther. 1997; 75: 185-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The biochemical processes responsible for the conversion of carotenoids to retinoids are not fully understood. Through elegant work carried out in the early and mid 1960s, an enzymatic activity able to catalyze the cleavage of β-carotene to all-trans-retinal was identified and characterized (10Olson J. J.

Earthworms reside in the most contaminated sites on earth, displaying a phenomenal tolerance to toxic heavy metals.

However, the precise molecular mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains to be unraveled. This study meets this challenge by fully characterizing the major metal-binding protein in earthworms, namely the two isoforms of metallothionein. Chemical analysis of recombinant protein showed that although both isoforms bind equimolar amounts of cadmium (6 mol), wMT-2 is more stable during proton competition. Furthermore, isoform-specific transcript analysis demonstrated that only wMT-2 is responsive to cadmium in a dose and temporal manner. The specific sequestration of cadmium to wMT-2 protein was confirmed in situ using polyclonal antisera. The latter also provided the means for mapping the cellular and intracellular distribution of metallothionein, thus yielding a holistic insight into its involvement in cadmium transit during absorption, storage, and excretion.

The first authoritative account of the central role of the earthworm in soil formation, quality, and fertility dates back to Charles Darwin well over 100 years ago (1Darwin C.R. The Formation of Vegetable Mould through the Action of Worms, with Observations on Their Habits. Murray, London1881Crossref Google Scholar). More recent studies have shown this oligochaete annelid exhibiting an exceptional tolerance to cadmium, residing in soils with concentrations exceeding 600 μg of cadmium/g dry weight (2Stürzenbaum S.R. Kille P. Morgan A.J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 437-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In addition to surviving this toxicological challenge, they bio-accumulate this metal ion to a body burden in excess of 1 mg/g dry weight (2Stürzenbaum S.R. Kille P. Morgan A.J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 437-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 3Morgan J.E. Norey C. Morgan A.J. Kay J. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1989; C92: 15-21Google Scholar). This accumulation of cadmium is in stark contrast to the exclusion observed with other metal ions, for example, copper (4Marino F. Stürzenbaum S.R. Kille P. Morgan A.J. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1998; 120: 217-223Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). However, even where ions with closely related chemistry, such as cadmium and zinc, are elevated within the same environment, the compartmentalization, and therefore the metabolic pathway, remains distinct (5Morris C.A. Stürzenbaum S.R. Nicolaus B. Morgan A.J. Harwood J.L. Kille P. Klaassen C. MT IV. Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland1999: 621-627Google Scholar). Therefore, the earthworm must have a highly developed and specific trafficking pathway for this toxic metal ion. Ultrastructural mapping has shown that the majority of the cadmium is sequestered as a thiol-based bio-inorganic complex within intracellular vesicles in the earthworm's primitive liver-like tissue, the chloragog (5Morris C.A.

The co-localization of cadmium and sulfur within a distinct intracellular organelle suggested the involvement of a sulfur-rich protein. Metallothioneins (MTs)1 are cysteine-rich cationic proteins that have been linked to cadmium detoxification in a wide range of phylogenetic orders (e.g. humans (6Heilmaier H.E. Drasch G.A. Kretschmer E. Summer K.H. Toxicol. Lett. (Amst.). 1987; 38: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), fish (7Brown M.W. Shurben D. Solbe J.F.D.G. Cryer A. Kay J. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1987; 87: 65-69Google Scholar), Caenorhabditis elegans (8Slice L.W. Freedman J.H. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 256-263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), springtails (9Hensbergen P.J. Donker M.H. Van Velzen M.J. Roelofs D. Van Der Schors R.C. Hunziker P.E. Van Straalen N.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and others). However, until recently (2Stürzenbaum S.R. Kille P. Morgan A.J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 437-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) no molecular information has been forthcoming regarding metallothionein from annelid species. These authors (2Stürzenbaum S.R. Kille P. Morgan A.J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 437-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) describe the cloning of two MT isoforms that encode the major cadmium-binding protein in earthworms and demonstrated a potential transcriptional up-regulation of 3 orders of magnitude when resident on a cadmium-contaminated soil. Elegant mass spectral analysis of MT protein fragments supported these observations (10Gruber C. Stürzenbaum S.R. Gehrig P. Sack R. Hunziker P. Berger B. Dallinger R. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 573-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Three problems prevented detailed mechanistic investigations. Firstly, the protein isolated from earthworms was insufficient to initiate a full chemical analysis. Secondly, the small amount of protein obtained consisted of a protein pool containing a mixture of isoforms. Thirdly, gene quantification was isoform-nonspecific and thus only provided a measure of total MT transcripts. These constraints have precluded investigations into possible isoform-specific functions, as observed previously in a terrestrial mollusc (11Dallinger R. Berger B. Hunziker P. Kägi J.H. Nature. 1997; 388: 237-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In the present study we overcame these limitations through the production of recombinant proteins of both isoforms, thereby providing sufficient material to enable the initiation of full chemical characterizations as well as the production of isoform-specific MT antisera. The latter provided the means for mapping the cellular and intracellular localization of MT by light and electron microscopy, thus yielding an important in situ insight into the functions of MT in metal sequestration and excretion within defined cell types. Combining these data with a new generation of isoform-specific transcript analyses, we were able to generate a holistic understanding of the role(s) of MT in cadmium toxicology at a molecular, cellular, and whole systems level in a higher eukaryote, which is of considerable applied significance in environmental sciences. Individual earthworms (Lumbricus rubellus) were maintained on Kettering loam soil (Broughton Loam Ltd., United Kingdom) under constant laboratory conditions in the absence of, or supplemented with, sublethal concentrations of CdCl2 (0, 30, or 300 μg/g of dried soil) over a standard time course (1, 3, 7, and 21 days). Total RNA was isolated with TRI reagent (Sigma) and reverse transcribed using standard protocols. MT quantifications were subsequently performed on an ABI PRISM® 7700 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using probes and primers designed using the program ABI PRISM® Primer Express™ (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). All amplifications were isoform-specific and devoid of detectable cross-reactivity. Each data point represents (actin-normalized) triplicate MT measurements performed on each of four individual earthworms. wMT-1 and wMT-2 were amplified from MT cDNA clones with isoform-specific primers containing 5′ SalI and NcoI restriction site extensions. The PCR products as well as 0.6 μg of pET29a vector (Novagen) were digested with SalI and NcoI (New England Biolabs, Inc.) for 4 h at 37 °C and ligated (4 °C overnight) into pET29a using 2 units of T4 ligase and 1× ligation buffer (Promega) and transformed into DH5α-competent cells (Life Technologies, Inc.). DNA was prepared (Miniprep, Promega) from positive colonies, identified by PCR screening, and stored at −80 °C. Furthermore, sequence identity was confirmed by PCR-based Thermo Sequenase fluorescent-labeled primer sequencing. The cells were allowed to grow to anA600 of 0.6 followed by the induction of protein expression through the addition of 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Promega). Cadmium concentration was increased by 50 mm every hour to stabilize the expressed MT and reduce essential metal scavenging. After 5 h postinduction, cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed using a French pressure cell press (Aminco, Maryland). The cytosolic fraction was obtained by centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 60 min and concurrently heated for 10 min at 80 °C. Precipitated proteins were removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was applied to a 5-ml SP Hi-trap Sepharose ion exchange column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4. The recombinant protein was eluted over a gradient of 0–200 mm NaCl using an FPLC system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cadmium levels were measured in each 5-ml elution fraction by atomic absorption spectrophotometry at 228.8 nm using a Varian SpectrAA-100 (Varian Instruments). In addition, the Cd–S thiol bond-specific absorbance (A254) was measured using a Hewlett Packard diode array spectrophotometer. Cadmium-containing fractions were pooled and applied to a G-50 Sephadex column (20-ml void volume) eluting in MilliQ water. The cadmium-containing pool was used for amino acid analysis (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and pH titrations.Apoprotein was prepared by exposure to anaerobic 0.1m HCl as described previously (12Winge D.R. Miklossy K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 3471-3476Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and separated from free cadmium by G-25 size-exclusion Sephadex chromatography. The concentration of apoprotein was determined by amino acid analysis (7Brown M.W. Shurben D. Solbe J.F.D.G. Cryer A. Kay J. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1987; 87: 65-69Google Scholar), and the reduction state of cysteine residues was assessed in a 2,2′-dithiobis(5-nitropyridine) assay (13Stillman M.J. Cai W. Zelazowski A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4538-4548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (14Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 277: 680-685Crossref Scopus (207129) Google Scholar). Reconstitution of the apoprotein with cadmium was performed essentially as described in Ref. 15Kille P. Lees W.E. Darke B.M. Winge D.R. Dameron C.T. Stephens P.E. Kay J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8042-8049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, and analysis of protein stability by pH titration was performed as published previously (16Tommey A.M. Shi J. Lindsay W.P. Urwin P.E. Robinson N.J. FEBS Lett. 1991; 292: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Whole worms were fixed in 10% formal saline for 24 h and then processed for postembedding histochemistry. Fixed tissues were dehydrated in a graded alcohol series and embedded in paraffin wax. Sections (nominally 7 μm) were cut using a steel knife in a Bright's microtome, mounted on Chance Gold Star Micro Slides, and dried overnight on a warming plate. Sections were examined after single immunolabeling using the indirect immunoperoxidase method essentially as described elsewhere (17Winters C. Jasani B. Marchant S. Morgan A.J. Histochem. J. 1997; 29: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). A small piece of fresh chloragogenous tissue was dissected from earthworms resident on cadmium-contaminated soil (Rudry, South Wales, UK, see (2Stürzenbaum S.R. Kille P. Morgan A.J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 437-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar)), smeared across a 3-mm 100 mesh titanium electron microscope grid, and allowed to air dry (18Morgan A.J. Winters C. Stürzenbaum S.R. Hajibagheri N. Methods in Molecular Biology. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1999: 245-276Google Scholar). Grids were examined in a JEOL JEM1210 transmission electron microscope operated at 80 kV and fitted with a LINK ATW Pentafet solid state x-ray detector (138 eV resolution) and a LINK ISIS multichannel analyzer (Oxford Analytical Instruments, UK). XRMA allowed cadmium-containing compartments to be located in the anhydrous preparations and chemically characterized in terms of associated elements with an atomic number > 12. Chloragogenous tissue from earthworms resident on cadmium-contaminated soil were fixed, cryoprotected, and nitrified. Thin sections were collected on copper grids for immunogold cytochemistry using the Tokuyasu method essentially as described by Webster (19Webster P. Hajibagheri N. Methods in Molecular Biology. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1999: 49-76Google Scholar). Sections immediately adjacent to those used for MT immunolocalization were mounted on titanium grids. These were not exposed to uranyl acetate or any reagents involved in the immunodetection protocol. Sections on titanium grids were used for XRMA analysis of the MT-positive compartments in counterpart sections. Performing XRMA on chemically fixed material is a compromise (20Morgan A.J Stürzenbaum S.R. Winters C. Kille P. Invertebr. Reprod. Devel. 1999; 36: 17-24Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar) considered justified in the present application because cadmium, by definition, forms a stable complex with MT at circumneutral pH. Furthermore, XRMA could not be done on the Tokuyasu preparations because of the confounding presence of uranium signals in the spectra and neither can immunolocalization be performed on unfixed cryosections. Nevertheless, the conjugation of two otherwise incompatible techniques on adjacent sections provided complementary information on the subcellular distribution of cadmium and MT. The encoded proteins of two earthworm L. rubellus MT isoforms display an identity of 74.7% and a similarity of 91.1%. Between the two isoforms, all cysteine residues are conserved, but interestingly there is a distinctive 2-amino acid deletion/insertion (Fig.1 A). A fully quantitative PCR protocol harnessing product detection via a 5′-nuclease hydrolysis probe allowed the development of an assay, which could distinguish between the two MT transcripts. Individual expression measurements of each MT isoform together with an appropriate control gene were taken to allow the temporal- and dose-dependent response to cadmium exposure to be determined (example analyses are given in Fig.1 B, i and ii). Actin was exploited as an internal control gene and showed a consistent correlation with the spectrally quantified cDNA concentration used as template. However, both isoforms of this oligochaete annelid worm showed an elevated transcriptional response during the initial time point, which returned to basal levels thereafter. It is well established that MT induction is stimulated by stress (21Jacob S.T. Ghoshal K. Sheridan J.F. Gene Expr. 1999; 7: 301-310PubMed Google Scholar), and indeed the handling and acclimatization required at the start of the experiment could conceivably induce a stress response. Therefore, to investigate whether there was a differential transcription response between the two isoforms, the ratio of wMT-2 over wMT-1 was calculated (Fig.1 B). This clearly indicated that there is specific dose and temporal induction of wMT-2 in response to cadmium. To facilitate an extensive characterization at the protein level, each isoform was inserted into the pET vector system and expressed as S tag fusion proteins. The success of the accumulation of functional metal-binding proteins within the Escherichia coli cell was assessed by correlating the intracellular levels of cadmium with the induction of the recombinant protein. In comparison with the control (E. coli transformed with the empty pET 29a vector), an exponential temporal rise in cytosolic cadmium was observed in cultures expressing either of the MT isoform fusion proteins (Fig.2 A). An equivalent increase was observed in a protein band with a molecular mass corresponding to the relevant S tag fusion protein (Fig.2 B). Cation exchange chromatography was applied to purify the recombinant proteins to homogeneity, which when separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, migrated slightly slower than the native (S tag devoid) protein previously isolated from worms sampled from a cadmium-contaminated mine site (Fig.2 C). MTs bind metals via metal-sulfur thiol bonds which, in the case of cadmium, have a specific absorption shoulder at a wavelength of 254 nm. Exploiting the fact that the formation of cadmium-thiol bonds and protein-sequestered metal increases proportionally until MT is fully saturated, it was possible to assess the metal-to-protein ratio by stepwise molar reconstitution of an apoprotein. Initially, metal ions were removed under anaerobic conditions from the purified recombinant MT by acidification and subsequent gel filtration. Independent concentration determination was performed using both DTNP and amino acid analysis, thus confirming that the generated apoprotein was fully demetallated and that the thiol groups were reduced in excess of 97%. A stoichiometric addition of cadmium facilitated the reconstitution ofholoprotein with a stepwise increase in A254 up to 6 molar equivalents of cadmium for both isoforms after which an absorbance plateau was observed (Fig. 3,A and B). Controlled demetallation through gradual increase in H+ concentration was used to determine the stability of the cadmium clusters. These titrations showed that wMT-2 is able to retain its metal ions over a far wider pH range than wMT-1. This phenomenon is best quantified by comparingKd values, namely the H+ concentration in which half of the metal is dissociated from the molecule. Although the wMT-1 dissociates at a pH of 3.3, the Kd of wMT-2 is 2.8, a value very similar to recombinant human MT expressed with an identical fusion tag (Fig. 3 C). It is intriguing that the two isoforms bind equimolar amounts of divalent metal ion; however, the relative stability of their cadmium cluster(s) is significantly different. Polyclonal antibodies were raised against both of the cadmium-loaded recombinant earthworm MT isoforms. The antisera generated showed negligible cross-reactivity to recombinant human MT as well as the S tag peptide. In contrast, a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay confirmed that the antibodies specifically identified both native and recombinant earthworm MTs (data not shown). Furthermore, MT-positive immunoperoxidase staining was identified using both antisera, as indicated by intense staining within chloragogenous tissue from earthworms native to a cadmium-contaminated location (Fig.4 A). Being polyclonal antibodies, they initially did not exhibit isoform specificity. However, antibody specificity could be achieved by competitive blocking, i.e. preincubation of antisera raised against wMT-2 with wMT-1 antigen and vice versa. A complete loss of MT staining was observed postblocking with pretreated wMT-1 antiserum. In contrast no visual loss in intensity was detected after pretreatment of wMT-2 antiserum (Fig. 4 B). This indicates isoform-specific wMT-2 accumulation in the chloragogenous tissue. As to be expected, no immunostaining was detected with either antiserum preincubation with both antigens (Fig. 4 C), and similarly, no MT-positive staining was observed in control earthworms native to clean soil (Fig.4 D). Immunohistochemistry performed on posterior transverse sections of the earthworm revealed the precise cellular localization of the cadmium-responsive MT. Light staining was observed in the intestinal epithelium, whereas intense staining predominated in the chloragogenous tissue separating the alimentary wall from the coelomic cavity and in the chloragocytes entrapped within the typhlosole fold (Fig. 5, A and B). Higher magnification of the chloragogenous tissue showed that the MT-positive staining was most intense within discrete vesicles distributed in the apical cytoplasm (Fig. 5 C). Close inspection revealed some chloragocytes with truncated apices indicative of the extracellular release of the MT-enriched vesicles or cytoplasmic fragments into both the coelomic cavity or typhlosole spaces. These released vesicles were visible in most sections of chloragogenous tissue (for example, Fig. 4 B).Figure 5Immunoperoxidase histochemistry performed on posterior transverse sections of the earthworm revealed the precise cellular localization of wMT-2, the cadmium-responsive MT. Staining was observed in the apical cytoplasm of the intestinal epithelial cells and in the chloragogenous tissue surrounding the basal layer and the typhlosole (A and B). Higher magnification of the chloragogenous tissue indicated that the MT-positive staining was most intense either within discrete vesicles in the apical cytoplasm of intact cells abutting the coelomic cavity or as apical projections released into the coelomic cavity or typhlosole (C).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) At the EM level, chloragogenous tissue was initially smeared onto titanium grids and air-dried (18Morgan A.J. Winters C. Stürzenbaum S.R. Hajibagheri N. Methods in Molecular Biology. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1999: 245-276Google Scholar). As described previously (22Morgan A.J. Morgan J.E. Turner M. Winters C. Yarwood A. Dallinger R. Reinbow P.S. Ecotoxicology of Metals in Invertebrates. Lewis Publishers, Boca Raton, FL1993: 333-358Google Scholar), cadmium and sulfur were co-localized within discrete compartments using XRMA (data not shown); structures that possessed some of the features of the apical MT-containing vesicles were visualized by light microscopy. Evidently cadmium and MT were co-localized. However, for increased contrast and definition, fresh chloragogenous tissue was dissected, fixed, and cryosectioned for immunogold histochemistry and static probe XRMA (Fig.6) by the Tokuyasu preparative method (23Tokuyasu K.T. Mahler T.A. Singer S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 1157-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This pioneering combination of antigen- and metal-detection techniques confirmed the co-localization of cadmium and MT within the same discrete subcellular compartments. Metallothioneins are defined by their characteristic low molecular weight, high metal content, the presence of few or no aromatic residues, and an abundance of cysteines (up to 30%). In addition to the historic link to cadmium detoxification, studies have shown that MTs can donate essential metals, such as zinc, to metallo-enzymes (24Maret W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Although MT sequences are generally well conserved within phylogenetically related taxa, they differ significantly between taxa, and this is particularly true within and between invertebrate phyla. It was therefore not surprising that the cloned MT gene from the earthwormL. rubellus (2Stürzenbaum S.R. Kille P. Morgan A.J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 437-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 10Gruber C. Stürzenbaum S.R. Gehrig P. Sack R. Hunziker P. Berger B. Dallinger R. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 573-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) does not share any overall primary homology with other invertebrate sequences such as those described for the nematode C. elegans (8Slice L.W. Freedman J.H. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 256-263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or the snail (11Dallinger R. Berger B. Hunziker P. Kägi J.H. Nature. 1997; 388: 237-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Notwithstanding this lack of primary homology, the MTs share the short cysteine motifs that are central to thiolate cluster formation and thus metal binding. Furthermore, earthworms, nematodes, and snails all express two distinct MT isoforms that have analogous structure-function relationships. Both recombinant L. rubellus isoforms exhibit the ability to bind six cadmium ions, a number that is identical to C. elegans MTs (8Slice L.W. Freedman J.H. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 256-263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both earthworm and nematode MTs have 20 cysteine residues, yielding a stoichiometry marginally less than vertebrate MTs with their 7 metal atoms bound to proteins with a comparable number of cysteine residues. Although wMT-2 and human MT share the same cadmium retention potential during proton competition, wMT-1 is more susceptible to metal loss. This is a striking observation given the significant homology and conservation of all cysteine motifs between the earthworm isoforms. One major difference prevails, namely a 2-amino acid insertion/deletion approximately in the center of the sequence. If the earthworm protein forms a two-domain structure, similar to vertebrate MTs, this region would punctuate two domains comprising of an N-terminal Cys11 domain and a C-terminal Cys9 domain. This would result in a 6- and 4-amino acid putative link in wMT-1 and wMT-2, respectively. It has previously been shown that in vertebrates, an increase of the linker region reduces the overall stability of the MT molecule (25Rhee I.K. Lee K.S. Huang P.C. Protein Eng. 1990; 3: 205-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Therefore, the observation that wMT-1 is less stable than wMT-2 would be consistent with a two-domain hypothesis in which the linker modulates the stability of the protein. Furthermore, partial demetallation and subsequent proteolysis of vertebrate MTs can be used to generate individual domains (12Winge D.R. Miklossy K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 3471-3476Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This phenomenon is reflected in the analysis of native MTs extracted from the related compost earthworm Eisenia fetida. Not only does it have a longer linker region than L. rubellus, but sophisticated proteomic analysis could only yield the N-terminal half, equivalent to Cys11, of a proteolytically cleaved MT (10Gruber C. Stürzenbaum S.R. Gehrig P. Sack R. Hunziker P. Berger B. Dallinger R. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 573-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, the proteins investigated in this study, both native and recombinant, reflected the intact protein as confirmed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Overall, the limited chemical analysis has highlighted that although the ratio of metal binding is identical in both isoforms, they differ significantly in their metal binding properties, thus providing the first indication of a differential structure-function relationship. Increased evidence for isoform-specific roles was provided by the transcript analysis. The relative expression of wMT-2 compared with wMT-1 in response to cadmium over time and dose was determined. These results conclusively show wMT-2 to be the sole cadmium-responsive isoform. Exposure to 30 μg of cadmium/g of soil induced a significant transcriptional response after 21 days exposure; however, 300 μg of cadmium/g of soil elicited a 400-fold response of after 7 days, which increased to >2500-fold after 21 days. This considerable induction is comparable with the 2000-fold induction observed when total MT transcript measurements were quantified from worms resident to natural soils containing ∼600 μg of cadmium/g of soil (2Stürzenbaum S.R. Kille P. Morgan A.J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 437-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). This indicates that the observed response is nontransient and not followed by the activation of a secondary system. Thus this suggests that wMT-2 is the primary response for these organisms to cadmium exposure. Collectively these observations uphold the notion that only wMT-2 is involved in cadmium trafficking. However, it is unlikely that every mole of cadmium is bound to MT per se as the amount of cadmium body burden within the earthworm would equate to ∼1% MT protein in relation to total body mass. The precise mechanism(s) that modulate the observed positive transcriptional regulation of wMT-2 remains elusive. In higher eukaryotes the transcription factor MTF-1 has been shown to be the major metal regulator of MT expression acting through metal responsive elements located within the MT promoter region. However, we do not know at present whether a homologous system exists in the earthworm, especially in light of the fact that the C. elegans MT promoter lacks multiple metal responsive element sequences, and a homology search of the whole genome data base indicates the absence of a phylogenetically conserved MTF-1. Therefore, further investigation is required to determine whether the earthworm shares a novel or alternative system with its invertebrate counterpart or employs the vertebrate response mechanism. One major advantage of the earthworms is that it is possible to visualize an entire trans-section within a single light microscopic image. This section comprises the major organs involved in absorption (the intestine), primary detoxification (the chlorogog, equivalent to a vertebrate liver), and excretion (the nephridia, equivalent to a vertebrate kidney). With the aid of the wMT-2-specific polyclonal antisera, we were able to follow the involvement of MT at key steps of cadmium transit through the cross section of a higher eukaryotic organism. Initially wMT-2 is located in the cytoplasm adjacent to the apical membranes of alimentary epithelial cells; however, it appears to have little or no involvement in the subsequent trafficking of cadmium through the epithelium and across the basal layer. Clearly another metal transporter/metal pump is involved at this step. A possible candidate may be a homologue to C. elegans cdr-1, a 32-KDa integral membrane protein shown to respond specifically to cadmium in a manner paralleling the expression of MT. 2J. Freedman, personal communication, submitted for publication. In earthworms, cadmium is sequestered again by wMT-2 and compartmentalized once it enters the chloragogenous tissue. This correlates with previous electron probe analysis that identified cadmium- and sulfur-rich granules within this tissue (5Morris C.A. Stürzenbaum S.R. Nicolaus B. Morgan A.J. Harwood J.L. Kille P. Klaassen C. MT IV. Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland1999: 621-627Google Scholar). By examination of adjacent cryosections using electron microscopic ultrastructural analysis, XRMA electron probe, and immunogold labeling, we have been able to conclusively prove that these cadmium- and sulfur-rich granules are indeed concentrated compartments of wMT-2 protein. The Cd–MT sequestering compartments are released via exocytosis or shedding of the apical portions of the chloragocytes. This releases these granules either into a fold within the gut epithelium, known as the typhlosole, or directly into the coelomic cavity. In the coelom it is evident that the MT-rich granules are endocytosed by coelomocytes, wandering cells akin to vertebrate macrophages involved in immunocompetence. Finally, intense staining is observed in the nephridia (data not shown), indicating that these organs play a role in cadmium excretion although it is still unclear how the metal is delivered to them. Does the primary sequence contain any specific feature that would explain why this isoform is linked to cadmium detoxification via a compartmentalization process? Analysis of the derived amino acid sequences identified two N-glycosylation signal sequences that are present only in wMT-2 (2Stürzenbaum S.R. Kille P. Morgan A.J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 437-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). These may facilitate post-translational modification, which in turn may be instrumental in targeting this specific isoform to intracellular compartments. In addition the two isoforms exhibit differential cluster stability. This suggests that the more labile cluster of wMT-1 is better adapted to be involved as a carrier and donor of essential metals such as zinc and copper, whereas wMT-2 has evolved to scavenge and immobilize nonessential metals like cadmium. Previous work (22Morgan A.J. Morgan J.E. Turner M. Winters C. Yarwood A. Dallinger R. Reinbow P.S. Ecotoxicology of Metals in Invertebrates. Lewis Publishers, Boca Raton, FL1993: 333-358Google Scholar) has suggested that the compartment involved as the end point of accumulation may be lysosomes. Given its ability to retain its metal load at higher proton concentrations, wMT-2 is a well adapted candidate to sequester metals within acidified compartments. In conclusion wMT-2 is the sole cadmium-responsive MT isoform in earthworms both at the transcriptional and translational level. This protein is targeted in intracellular compartments, which are involved in a high capacity detoxification pathway. Sequence and chemical analyses have provided the molecular basis underlying the specific involvement of wMT-2 in cadmium sequestration. By exploiting molecular tools, we have been able to track the involvement of MT in the complete cycle of cadmium trafficking within a higher eukaryote, which is central to soil quality and fertility."
https://openalex.org/W2014089759,"We previously identified testicular protein kinase 1 (TESK1), which phosphorylates cofilin and induces actin cytoskeletal reorganization. We now report identification and characterization of another member of a TESK family, testicular protein kinase 2 (TESK2), with 48% amino acid identity with TESK1. Like TESK1, TESK2 phosphorylated cofilin specifically at Ser-3 and induced formation of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions. Both TESK1 and TESK2 are highly expressed in the testis, but in contrast to TESK1, which is predominantly expressed in testicular germ cells, TESK2 is expressed predominantly in nongerminal Sertoli cells. Thus, TESK1 and TESK2 seem to play distinct roles in spermatogenesis. In HeLa cells, TESK1 was localized mainly in the cytoplasm, whereas TESK2 was localized mainly in the nucleus, which means that TESK1 and TESK2 likely have distinct cellular functions. Because the kinase-inactive mutant of TESK2 was localized in the cytoplasm, nuclear/cytoplasmic localization of TESK2 depends on its kinase activity. A TESK2 mutant lacking the C-terminal noncatalytic region had about a 10-fold higher kinase activity in vitro and, when expressed in HeLa cells, induced punctate actin aggregates in the cytoplasm and unusual condensation and fragmentation of nuclei, followed by apoptosis.

We recently obtained evidence that TESK1, like LIM kinases, has the potential to phosphorylate cofilin/ADF specifically at Ser-3 and induces the formation of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions by phosphorylating cofilin/ADF (18Toshima J.

In contrast to LIM kinases, the kinase activity of TESK1 is not stimulated by either PAK or Rho-associated kinase but can be stimulated by the integrin-mediated signaling pathway (18Toshima J.

These results suggest that cofilin phosphorylation is regulated by at least three protein kinases, LIMK1, LIMK2, and TESK1, and upstream regulators for TESK1 seem to differ from those of LIM kinases.

(21Rosøk Ø. Pedeutour F. Ree A.H. Aasheim H.-C. Genomics. 1999; 61: 4-54Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar) report the cloning of human cDNA coding for a novel member of a TESK family, testicular protein kinase 2 (TESK2), with an overall structure closely related to that of TESK1. However, the deduced amino acid sequence of TESK2 by Rosøk et al. (21Rosøk Ø. Pedeutour F. Ree A.H. Aasheim H.-C. Genomics. 1999; 61: 4-54Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar) had 16 amino acids deleted within the protein kinase consensus sequence compared with sequences of TESK1 and LIM kinases, and the kinase activity, substrate(s), and cellular functions of TESK2 have remained to be determined.We report here identification and characterization of full-length of rat and human TESK2 with no deletion of 16 amino acids in the kinase domain. TESK2 has activity to phosphorylate cofilin/ADF and to induce actin cytoskeletal changes. We also show the predominant expression of TESK2 protein in rat testicular Sertoli cells and the subcellular distribution mainly in the nucleus, differing from previous findings in case of TESK1, which is expressed predominantly in the testicular germ cells and localizes primarily in the cytoplasm (17Toshima J.

We also characterized the role of the C-terminal noncatalytic region of TESK2 with regard to regulation of its kinase catalytic activity and cellular activity.DISCUSSIONIn this study we identified cDNAs coding for full-length rat and human TESK2. RT-PCR analysis revealed the existence of two isoforms of rat TESK2 transcripts with or without a 49-nt deletion within the protein kinase domain and one transcript for human TESK2 without a 49-nt deletion. Expression of the 49-nt-deleted TESK2 isoform was detected only in rat testis as a minor component, and it codes for the short truncated protein due to a shift in the reading frame. Rosøket al. (21Rosøk Ø. Pedeutour F. Ree A.H. Aasheim H.-C. Genomics. 1999; 61: 4-54Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar) report the cDNA sequence for human TESK2, but their reported sequence has a 48-nt (not 49-nt) deletion at the same position within the kinase domain. This sequence seems incorrect when compared with the human genome data bases. We were unable to detect the expression of the 48- or 49-nt deleted isoform of human TESK2 mRNA in several cell lines examined. These findings suggest that TESK2 mRNA without a 49-nt deletion is the major transcript that codes for the full-length functional TESK2 protein, and TESK2 mRNA with the 49-nt deletion seems to play, if any, a minor role. The exon/intron boundaries of TESK1 and TESK2 genes are almost conserved (28Toshima J. Nakagawara K. Mori M. Noda T. Mizuno K. Gene. 1998; 206: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), suggesting that these genes are generated from a common ancestral gene by gene duplication.Both TESK1 and TESK2 are highly expressed in the testis, which suggests a role for TESK family kinases in spermatogenesis. However, expression patterns of these kinases in the testis significantly differ; TESK1 is predominantly expressed in germ cells, particularly at stages of pachytene spermatocytes to early spermatids (17Toshima J. Ohashi K. Okano I. Nunoue K. Kishioka M. Kuma K. Miyata T. Hirai M. Baba T. Mizuno K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31331-31337Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 19Toshima J. Koji T. Mizuno K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 107-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), whereas TESK2 is predominantly expressed in somatic Sertoli cells. Northern analysis revealed that expression of TESK1 mRNA (3.6 kb) significantly increases after postnatal days 20–24 (19Toshima J. Koji T. Mizuno K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 107-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), but expression of TESK2 mRNA (3.0 kb) is practically constant throughout 7–24 postnatal days. Rat spermatocytes begin to undergo meiosis and to generate haploid round spermatids on postnatal days 25–30 (29Yang Z.W. Wreford N.G. de Kretser D.M. Biol. Reprod. 1990; 43: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Based on developmental changes in expression of TESK1 mRNA and protein, we suggested a role for TESK1 in germ cells at and/or after meiotic stages of spermatogenesis (19Toshima J. Koji T. Mizuno K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 107-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In contrast, expression patterns of TESK2 mRNA and protein suggest its primary role in somatic Sertoli cells. Together these findings suggest that TESK1 and TESK2 play distinct roles in spermatogenesis in the testis. Rosøk et al. (21Rosøk Ø. Pedeutour F. Ree A.H. Aasheim H.-C. Genomics. 1999; 61: 4-54Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar) report the expression of TESK2 mRNA with the size of 3.5 kb in rat testis only after the 30th day of postnatal development (21Rosøk Ø. Pedeutour F. Ree A.H. Aasheim H.-C. Genomics. 1999; 61: 4-54Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Although the reason for the differences between the sizes and expression patterns of TESK2 mRNA is not clear, it may be because Rosøk et al. (21Rosøk Ø. Pedeutour F. Ree A.H. Aasheim H.-C. Genomics. 1999; 61: 4-54Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar) used human TESK2 cDNA or a rat EST cDNA clone corresponding to the 3′-noncoding region of rat TESK2 (nt 2529–3003) as the probe for Northern analysis, whereas our probe was full-length rat TESK2 cDNA.The present study provides evidence that TESK2 can phosphorylate cofilin and ADF specifically at Ser-3. Since actin-depolymerizing and -severing activities of cofilin/ADF are abrogated by phosphorylation at Ser-3, TESK2 seems to play an important role in actin filament dynamics by inhibiting cofilin/ADF activity. Actually, expression of TESK2 in HeLa cells induced assembly of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions. Thus, TESK2, similar to other members of a LIMK/TESK family, appears to be involved in actin cytoskeletal reorganization by phosphorylating and regulating cofilin/ADF. Previous studies revealed that LIMK1 and LIMK2 are activated by Rho-associated kinase and PAK, downstream effectors of Rho and Rac, respectively, by phosphorylation of conserved Thr-508 (in LIMK1) and Thr-505 (in LIMK2) in the activation loop of the kinase domain (12Edwards D.C. Sanders L.C. Bokoch G.M. Gill G.N. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 253-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar, 13Maekawa M. Ishizaki T. Boku S. Watanabe N. Fujita A. Iwamatsu A. Obinata T. Ohashi K.

Chem. 2001; 276: 670-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Although the protein kinase domains of TESK1 and TESK2 are related to those of LIMKs, they have an alanine residue at the position corresponding to Thr-508 of LIMK1 or Thr-505 of LIMK2, within the activation loops of the kinase domains. Rho-associated kinase and PAK did not affect the kinase activity of TESK1 (18Toshima J. Toshima J.Y. Amano T. Yang N. Narumiya S. Mizuno K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1131-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) and TESK2 2J. Toshima, J. Y. Toshima, K. Takeuchi, R. Mori, and K. Mizuno, unpublished data. in vitro orin vivo. These results suggest that TESK1/TESK2 and LIMK1/LIMK2 commonly phosphorylate cofilin/ADF, but their upstream regulatory pathways differ significantly. As shown in this study, TESK1 and TESK2 have related structures, but their subcellular localization and distribution in cell lines differ significantly; hence, they have distinct modes of regulation and distinct functions in a cell type-specific manner.It remains to be known how nuclear TESK2 can regulate the actin cytoskeleton in the cytoplasm. Cofilin contains a well-characterized nuclear localization signal and has been reported to translocate to the nucleus in response to stimuli such as heat shock, treatment with dimethyl sulfoxide and T-cell costimulation and in a manner dependent on the dephosphorylation of Ser-3 (4Bamburg J.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 14: 305-338Google Scholar). It could be that the nuclear TESK2 phosphorylates cofilin translocated into the nucleus and thereby down-regulates the level of active (non-phosphorylated) cofilin in the cytoplasm and induces actin reorganization. Alternatively, the small amount of TESK2 localized in the cytoplasm may be enough to induce the changes in actin organization.We found that the Δ4 mutant of TESK2 with deletion of the C-terminal half has about a 10-fold higher kinase activity compared with wild-type TESK2. Because other truncated mutants, Δ1, Δ2, and Δ3, have kinase activity similar to that of wild-type TESK2, the region of amino acid sequence (327) seems to be involved in the negative regulation of TESK2 kinase activity. Many protein kinases contain an autoinhibitory domain within their noncatalytic region that inhibits catalytic activity by interacting with the catalytic domain. Among them, the N-terminal autoinhibitory domain of PAK is well characterized (30Manser E. Huang H.-Y Loo T.-H. Chen X.-Q. Dong J.-M. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1129-1143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Frost J.A. Khokhlatchev A. Stippec S. White M.A. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28191-28198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 32Zhao Z.-S. Manser E. Chen X.-Q. Chong C. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2153-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The PAK autoinhibitory domain partially overlaps with the Rac/Cdc42 binding domain and associates with the catalytic site to block substrate binding. When PAK associates with an active GTP binding form of Rac or Cdc42, the autoinhibitory domain dissociates from the catalytic site and sets the kinase domain free, leading to the promotion of autophosphorylation for activation (30Manser E. Huang H.-Y Loo T.-H. Chen X.-Q. Dong J.-M. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1129-1143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The kinase activity of TESK2 might be similarly regulated by binding of upstream regulators to the C-terminal region near residues (327) of TESK2. Identification of proteins that associate with this region may reveal mechanisms regulating TESK2 activation. The Δ4 mutant induced condensation and fragmentation of the nucleus and subsequent cell death. Because a kinase-inactive form of Δ4 had no such effect, the altered nuclear morphology and cell death are probably caused by excess phosphorylation of substrates by abnormally activated TESK2. Recent studies suggest that γPAK (PAK2) is constitutively activated via CPP32 (caspase 3)-catalyzed cleavage at the site between the N-terminal regulatory domain and the C-terminal kinase domain and thereby induces apoptosis in Jurkat cells (33Rudel T. Bokoch G.M. Science. 1997; 276: 1571-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar, 34Lee N. MacDonald H. Reinhard C. Halenbeck R. Roulston A. Shi T. Williams L.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1997; 94: 13642-13647Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). As the nuclear morphology induced by the Δ4 mutant, condensation and fragmentation of the nucleus, is similar to the typical apoptotic phenotype, TESK2 may play a role in the execution step of apoptosis, where TESK2 may abnormally activated by proteolysis, as in the case of γPAK. The dynamics of polymerization/depolymerization of actin filaments and their remodeling are essential for cell movement, adhesion, and division (1Mitchison T.J. Cramer L.P.

Genomics. 1999; 61: 4-54Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar) report the cloning of human cDNA coding for a novel member of a TESK family, testicular protein kinase 2 (TESK2), with an overall structure closely related to that of TESK1. However, the deduced amino acid sequence of TESK2 by Rosøk et al. (21Rosøk Ø. Pedeutour F. Ree A.H. Aasheim H.-C. Genomics. 1999; 61: 4-54Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar) had 16 amino acids deleted within the protein kinase consensus sequence compared with sequences of TESK1 and LIM kinases, and the kinase activity, substrate(s), and cellular functions of TESK2 have remained to be determined. We report here identification and characterization of full-length of rat and human TESK2 with no deletion of 16 amino acids in the kinase domain. TESK2 has activity to phosphorylate cofilin/ADF and to induce actin cytoskeletal changes. We also show the predominant expression of TESK2 protein in rat testicular Sertoli cells and the subcellular distribution mainly in the nucleus, differing from previous findings in case of TESK1, which is expressed predominantly in the testicular germ cells and localizes primarily in the cytoplasm (17Toshima J.

We also characterized the role of the C-terminal noncatalytic region of TESK2 with regard to regulation of its kinase catalytic activity and cellular activity. DISCUSSIONIn this study we identified cDNAs coding for full-length rat and human TESK2. RT-PCR analysis revealed the existence of two isoforms of rat TESK2 transcripts with or without a 49-nt deletion within the protein kinase domain and one transcript for human TESK2 without a 49-nt deletion. Expression of the 49-nt-deleted TESK2 isoform was detected only in rat testis as a minor component, and it codes for the short truncated protein due to a shift in the reading frame. Rosøket al. (21Rosøk Ø. Pedeutour F. Ree A.H. Aasheim H.-C. Genomics. 1999; 61: 4-54Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar) report the cDNA sequence for human TESK2, but their reported sequence has a 48-nt (not 49-nt) deletion at the same position within the kinase domain. This sequence seems incorrect when compared with the human genome data bases. We were unable to detect the expression of the 48- or 49-nt deleted isoform of human TESK2 mRNA in several cell lines examined. These findings suggest that TESK2 mRNA without a 49-nt deletion is the major transcript that codes for the full-length functional TESK2 protein, and TESK2 mRNA with the 49-nt deletion seems to play, if any, a minor role. The exon/intron boundaries of TESK1 and TESK2 genes are almost conserved (28Toshima J. Nakagawara K. Mori M. Noda T. Mizuno K. Gene. 1998; 206: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), suggesting that these genes are generated from a common ancestral gene by gene duplication.Both TESK1 and TESK2 are highly expressed in the testis, which suggests a role for TESK family kinases in spermatogenesis. However, expression patterns of these kinases in the testis significantly differ; TESK1 is predominantly expressed in germ cells, particularly at stages of pachytene spermatocytes to early spermatids (17Toshima J. Ohashi K. Okano I. Nunoue K. Kishioka M. Kuma K. Miyata T. Hirai M. Baba T. Mizuno K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31331-31337Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 19Toshima J. Koji T. Mizuno K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 107-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), whereas TESK2 is predominantly expressed in somatic Sertoli cells. Northern analysis revealed that expression of TESK1 mRNA (3.6 kb) significantly increases after postnatal days 20–24 (19Toshima J. Koji T. Mizuno K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 107-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), but expression of TESK2 mRNA (3.0 kb) is practically constant throughout 7–24 postnatal days. Rat spermatocytes begin to undergo meiosis and to generate haploid round spermatids on postnatal days 25–30 (29Yang Z.W. Wreford N.G. de Kretser D.M. Biol. Reprod. 1990; 43: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Based on developmental changes in expression of TESK1 mRNA and protein, we suggested a role for TESK1 in germ cells at and/or after meiotic stages of spermatogenesis (19Toshima J. Koji T. Mizuno K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 107-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In contrast, expression patterns of TESK2 mRNA and protein suggest its primary role in somatic Sertoli cells. Together these findings suggest that TESK1 and TESK2 play distinct roles in spermatogenesis in the testis. Rosøk et al. (21Rosøk Ø. Pedeutour F. Ree A.H. Aasheim H.-C. Genomics. 1999; 61: 4-54Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar) report the expression of TESK2 mRNA with the size of 3.5 kb in rat testis only after the 30th day of postnatal development (21Rosøk Ø. Pedeutour F. Ree A.H. Aasheim H.-C. Genomics. 1999; 61: 4-54Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Although the reason for the differences between the sizes and expression patterns of TESK2 mRNA is not clear, it may be because Rosøk et al. (21Rosøk Ø. Pedeutour F. Ree A.H. Aasheim H.-C. Genomics. 1999; 61: 4-54Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar) used human TESK2 cDNA or a rat EST cDNA clone corresponding to the 3′-noncoding region of rat TESK2 (nt 2529–3003) as the probe for Northern analysis, whereas our probe was full-length rat TESK2 cDNA.The present study provides evidence that TESK2 can phosphorylate cofilin and ADF specifically at Ser-3. Since actin-depolymerizing and -severing activities of cofilin/ADF are abrogated by phosphorylation at Ser-3, TESK2 seems to play an important role in actin filament dynamics by inhibiting cofilin/ADF activity. Actually, expression of TESK2 in HeLa cells induced assembly of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions. Thus, TESK2, similar to other members of a LIMK/TESK family, appears to be involved in actin cytoskeletal reorganization by phosphorylating and regulating cofilin/ADF. Previous studies revealed that LIMK1 and LIMK2 are activated by Rho-associated kinase and PAK, downstream effectors of Rho and Rac, respectively, by phosphorylation of conserved Thr-508 (in LIMK1) and Thr-505 (in LIMK2) in the activation loop of the kinase domain (12Edwards D.C.

Although the protein kinase domains of TESK1 and TESK2 are related to those of LIMKs, they have an alanine residue at the position corresponding to Thr-508 of LIMK1 or Thr-505 of LIMK2, within the activation loops of the kinase domains. Rho-associated kinase and PAK did not affect the kinase activity of TESK1 (18Toshima J. Toshima J.Y. Amano T. Yang N. Narumiya S. Mizuno K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1131-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) and TESK2 2J. Toshima, J. Y. Toshima, K. Takeuchi, R. Mori, and K. Mizuno, unpublished data. in vitro orin vivo. These results suggest that TESK1/TESK2 and LIMK1/LIMK2 commonly phosphorylate cofilin/ADF, but their upstream regulatory pathways differ significantly. As shown in this study, TESK1 and TESK2 have related structures, but their subcellular localization and distribution in cell lines differ significantly; hence, they have distinct modes of regulation and distinct functions in a cell type-specific manner.It remains to be known how nuclear TESK2 can regulate the actin cytoskeleton in the cytoplasm. Cofilin contains a well-characterized nuclear localization signal and has been reported to translocate to the nucleus in response to stimuli such as heat shock, treatment with dimethyl sulfoxide and T-cell costimulation and in a manner dependent on the dephosphorylation of Ser-3 (4Bamburg J.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 14: 305-338Google Scholar). It could be that the nuclear TESK2 phosphorylates cofilin translocated into the nucleus and thereby down-regulates the level of active (non-phosphorylated) cofilin in the cytoplasm and induces actin reorganization. Alternatively, the small amount of TESK2 localized in the cytoplasm may be enough to induce the changes in actin organization.We found that the Δ4 mutant of TESK2 with deletion of the C-terminal half has about a 10-fold higher kinase activity compared with wild-type TESK2. Because other truncated mutants, Δ1, Δ2, and Δ3, have kinase activity similar to that of wild-type TESK2, the region of amino acid sequence (327) seems to be involved in the negative regulation of TESK2 kinase activity. Many protein kinases contain an autoinhibitory domain within their noncatalytic region that inhibits catalytic activity by interacting with the catalytic domain. Among them, the N-terminal autoinhibitory domain of PAK is well characterized (30Manser E. Huang H.-Y Loo T.-H. Chen X.-Q. Dong J.-M. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1129-1143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Frost J.A. Khokhlatchev A. Stippec S. White M.A. Cobb M.H. J. Biol.

Biol. 1998; 18: 2153-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The PAK autoinhibitory domain partially overlaps with the Rac/Cdc42 binding domain and associates with the catalytic site to block substrate binding. When PAK associates with an active GTP binding form of Rac or Cdc42, the autoinhibitory domain dissociates from the catalytic site and sets the kinase domain free, leading to the promotion of autophosphorylation for activation (30Manser E. Huang H.-Y Loo T.-H. Chen X.-Q. Dong J.-M. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1129-1143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The kinase activity of TESK2 might be similarly regulated by binding of upstream regulators to the C-terminal region near residues (327) of TESK2. Identification of proteins that associate with this region may reveal mechanisms regulating TESK2 activation. The Δ4 mutant induced condensation and fragmentation of the nucleus and subsequent cell death. Because a kinase-inactive form of Δ4 had no such effect, the altered nuclear morphology and cell death are probably caused by excess phosphorylation of substrates by abnormally activated TESK2. Recent studies suggest that γPAK (PAK2) is constitutively activated via CPP32 (caspase 3)-catalyzed cleavage at the site between the N-terminal regulatory domain and the C-terminal kinase domain and thereby induces apoptosis in Jurkat cells (33Rudel T. Bokoch G.M. Science. 1997; 276: 1571-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar, 34Lee N. MacDonald H. Reinhard C. Halenbeck R. Roulston A. Shi T. Williams L.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1997; 94: 13642-13647Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). As the nuclear morphology induced by the Δ4 mutant, condensation and fragmentation of the nucleus, is similar to the typical apoptotic phenotype, TESK2 may play a role in the execution step of apoptosis, where TESK2 may abnormally activated by proteolysis, as in the case of γPAK.

https://openalex.org/W2114630983,"The F (fusion) protein of the respiratory syncytial viruses is synthesized as an inactive precursor F(0) that is proteolytically processed at the multibasic sequence KKRKRR(136) into the subunits F(1) and F(2) by the cellular protease furin. This maturation process is essential for the F protein to gain fusion competence. We observed that proteolytic cleavage additionally occurs at another basic motif, RARR(109), that also meets the requirements for furin recognition. Cleavage at both sites leads to the removal from the polypeptide chain of a glycosylated peptide of 27 amino acids. When the sequence RARR(109) was changed to NANR(109) or to RANN(109) by site-directed mutagenesis, cleavage by furin was completely prevented. Although the mutants were still processed at position Arg(136), they did not show any syncytia formation. Proteolytic cleavage of the modified motifs was achieved by treatment of transfected cells with trypsin converting the F mutants into their fusogenic forms. Our findings indicate that both furin consensus sequences have to be cleaved in order to activate the fusion protein."
https://openalex.org/W2023823877,"The E2F family of transcription factors regulates the temporal transcription of genes involved in cell cycle progression and DNA synthesis. E2F transactivation is antagonized by retinoblastoma protein (pRb), which recruits chromatin-remodeling proteins such as histone deacetylases and SWI·SNF complexes to the promoter to repress transcription. We hypothesized that E2F proteins must reverse the pRb-imposed chromatin structure to stimulate transcription. If this is true, E2F proteins should recruit proteins capable of histone acetylation. Here we map the E2F-4 transactivation domain and show that E2F-1 and E2F-4 transactivation domains bind the acetyltransferase GCN5 and cofactor TRRAP in vivo. TRRAP and GCN5 co-expression stimulated E2F-mediated transactivation, and c-Myc repressed E2F transactivation dependent on an intact TRRAP/GCN5 binding motif. The transactivation domain of E2F-4 recruited proteins with significant histone acetyltransferase activity in vivo, and this activity required catalytically active GCN5. E2F-4 proteins with subtle mutations in the transactivation domain exhibited a positive correlation among transcriptional activation and GCN5 and TRRAP binding capacity and associated acetyltransferase activity. We conclude that E2F stimulates transcription by recruiting acetyltransferase activity and the essential cofactors GCN5 and TRRAP. These results provide a mechanism for E2F transcription factors to overcome pRb-mediated dominant repression of transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2070742295,"Previous biochemical analysis ofEscherichia coli methyl-directed mismatch repair implicates three redundant single-strand DNA-specific exonucleases (RecJ, ExoI, and ExoVII) and at least one additional unknown exonuclease in the excision reaction (Cooper, D. L., Lahue, R. S., and Modrich, P. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 11823–11829). We show here that ExoX also participates in methyl-directed mismatch repair. Analysis of the reaction with crude extracts and purified components demonstrated that ExoX can mediate repair directed from a strand signal 3′ of a mismatch. Whereas extracts of all possible single, double, and triple exonuclease mutants displayed significant residual mismatch repair, extracts deficient in RecJ, ExoI, ExoVII, and ExoX exonucleases were devoid of normal repair activity. The RecJ−ExoVII− ExoI− ExoX− strain displayed a 7-fold increase in mutation rate, a significant increase, but less than that observed for other blocks of the mismatch repair pathway. This elevation is epistatic to deficiency for MutS, suggesting an effect via the mismatch repair pathway. Our other work (Burdett, V., Baitinger, C., Viswanathan, M., Lovett, S. T., and Modrich, P. (2001) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 98, 6765–6770) suggests that mutants are under-recovered in the exonuclease-deficient strain due to loss of viability that is triggered by mismatched base pairs in this genetic background. The availability of any one exonuclease is enough to support full mismatch correction, as evident from the normal mutation rates of all triple mutants. Because three of these exonucleases possess a strict polarity of digestion, this suggests that mismatch repair can occur exclusively from a 3′ or a 5′ direction to the mismatch, if necessary. Previous biochemical analysis ofEscherichia coli methyl-directed mismatch repair implicates three redundant single-strand DNA-specific exonucleases (RecJ, ExoI, and ExoVII) and at least one additional unknown exonuclease in the excision reaction (Cooper, D.

The RecJ−ExoVII− ExoI− ExoX− strain displayed a 7-fold increase in mutation rate, a significant increase, but less than that observed for other blocks of the mismatch repair pathway. This elevation is epistatic to deficiency for MutS, suggesting an effect via the mismatch repair pathway. Our other work (Burdett, V., Baitinger, C., Viswanathan, M., Lovett, S. T., and Modrich, P. (2001) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 98, 6765–6770) suggests that mutants are under-recovered in the exonuclease-deficient strain due to loss of viability that is triggered by mismatched base pairs in this genetic background. The availability of any one exonuclease is enough to support full mismatch correction, as evident from the normal mutation rates of all triple mutants. Because three of these exonucleases possess a strict polarity of digestion, this suggests that mismatch repair can occur exclusively from a 3′ or a 5′ direction to the mismatch, if necessary. methyl-directed mismatch repair single-strand DNA rifampicin kilobase pair(s) The correction of DNA polymerase misincorporation errors plays an important role in the maintenance of genetic integrity. DNA biosynthetic errors in Escherichia coli are corrected by the methyl-directed mismatch repair (MMR)1 system, which removes incorrect nucleotides by a strand-specific excision reaction that is directed to daughter DNA strands by virtue of the transient absence of d(GATC) methylation within newly synthesized DNA (1Meselson M. Low K.B. The Recombination of Genetic Material. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1988: 91-113Crossref Google Scholar). This system processes both base-base and small insertion/deletion mismatches (2Su S.S. Lahue R.S. Au K.G. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6829-6835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Parker B.O. Marinus M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Inactivation of the genes encoding the nonessential MutH, MutL, MutS, or UvrD components confers a large increase (100–500-fold) in mutation rate (1Meselson M. Low K.B. The Recombination of Genetic Material. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1988: 91-113Crossref Google Scholar, 5Modrich P. Annu. Rev.

Assembly of this ternary complex is sufficient to activate the d(GATC) endonuclease activity of MutH, which incises the unmethylated strand of a hemimethylated d(GATC) sequence (12Au K.G. Welsh K. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12142-12148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as well as the unwinding activity of DNA helicase II (uvrD/mutU gene product), which enters the helix at the incised d(GATC) sequence and unwinds toward the mismatch (13Dao V. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9202-9207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). That portion of the unwound, incised strand is subject to degradation by one of several single-strand DNA (ssDNA) exonucleases (7Cooper D.L. Lahue R.S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11823-11829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Grilley M. Griffith J. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11830-11837Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and DNA removed in this manner is resynthesized by DNA polymerase III holoenzyme in the presence of single-strand DNA-binding protein. Finally, DNA ligase restores covalent continuity to the repaired strand (6Lahue R.S. Au K.G. Modrich P. Science. 1989; 245: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar).In vitro excision can be directed by an incised d(GATC) site that is located either 5′ or 3′ to the mismatch on the unmethylated strand, and the nature of the exonuclease requirement depends on the relative orientation of the two DNA sites (7Cooper D.L. Lahue R.S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11823-11829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If the initial incision is made 5′ to the mismatch, excision requires either ExoVII or RecJ exonuclease, both of which are capable of 5′→3′ hydrolysis of ssDNA (15Chase J.W. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 4553-4561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Lovett S.T. Kolodner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2627-2631Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), whereas exonuclease I, which is capable of 3′→5′ hydrolytic activity (17Lehman I.R. Nussbaum A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2628-2636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is sufficient to meet the exonuclease requirement when d(GATC) incision occurs 3′ to the mispair. Extracts prepared from a RecJ− ExoVII− double mutant are defective in repair directed by a 5′ d(GATC) sequence. However, extracts of ExoI-deficient strains retain repair activity on heteroduplexes where repair is directed by a d(GATC) site located 3′ to the mismatch, suggesting that at least one additional activity can meet the 3′ exonuclease requirement (7Cooper D.L. Lahue R.S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11823-11829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The phenotypes of strains mutant in RecJ, ExoI, and/or ExoVII exonucleases have implicated these genes and their products in DNA repair and recombination (18Kushner S.R. Nagaishi H. Templin A. Clark A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 824-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 19Chase J.W. Richardson C.C. J.

In addition, ExoI and ExoVII also appear to have overlapping roles in preventing frameshift and quasi-palindrome templated mutations, two classes of mutations associated with strand slippage during DNA replication (21Viswanathan M. Lovett S.T. Genetics. 1998; 149: 7-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Viswanathan M. Lacirignola J.J. Hurley R.L. Lovett S.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 553-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Despite the biochemical evidence implicating ExoI, RecJ, and ExoVII in mismatch repair (7Cooper D.L. Lahue R.S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11823-11829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), triple mutants deficient in the three activities fail to show enhanced mutability in assays that score for spontaneous base substitutions, a hallmark of MMR deficiency (21Viswanathan M. Lovett S.T. Genetics. 1998; 149: 7-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Harris R.S. Ross K.J. Lombardo M.J. Rosenberg S.M. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 989-993Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, it seems unlikely that DNA helicase II alone would be sufficient to support methyl-directed excision, especially when one considers that excision tracts can be a thousand nucleotides or more (14Grilley M. Griffith J. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11830-11837Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Wagner Jr., R. Meselson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 4135-4139Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Inasmuch as ExoI, RecJ, and ExoVII have been implicated in a UV-induced recombination pathway that also depends on MutH, MutL, and MutS mismatch repair activities (25Feng W.Y. Hays J.B. Genetics. 1995; 140: 1175-1186Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and because biochemical experiments have suggested involvement of at least one additional exonuclease in the methyl-directed reaction, we have sought the identity of other exonucleases that might support methyl-directed excision.A novel E. coli 3′→5′ exonuclease, exonuclease X, has recently been identified (26Viswanathan M. Lovett S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30094-30100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This activity hydrolyzes both single- and double-strand DNA, but its affinity for single-strand DNA is approximately 10 times greater than that for duplex DNA. Unlike RecJ, ExoI, and ExoVII, which are processive exonucleases, ExoX is distributive, hydrolyzing only one or a few nucleotides before releasing from its substrate. The fact that ExoX is distributive does not affect its potency as a nuclease; in fact, its affinity for single-strand DNA and its specific activity rival those of RecJ and ExoI.We demonstrate here that ExoX also supports methyl-directed mismatch repair in vitro. The results show that either RecJ or ExoVII is sufficient to meet the exonuclease requirement when excision is initiated 5′ to the mispair, whereas either ExoI, ExoVII, or ExoX is sufficient to meet the exonuclease requirement when excision is initiated 3′ to the mismatch. Simultaneous inactivation of ExoX, ExoI, RecJ, and ExoVII abolishes normal mismatch repair in vitrobut confers only a modest increase in mutation rate. We provide evidence elsewhere (27Burdett V. Baitinger C. Viswanathan M. Lovett S.T. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6765-6770Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) that these exonucleases participate in methyl-directed repair in vivo, and we demonstrate that the relatively low mutability of the quadruple exonuclease mutant is due to under-recovery of mutants as a consequence of lethal events triggered by the occurrence of mismatches in this genetic background.DISCUSSIONPrevious work has implicated E. coli ExoX, as well as the ssDNA exonucleases ExoI, ExoVII, and RecJ, in the repair of UV-damaged DNA (21Viswanathan M. Lovett S.T. Genetics. 1998; 149: 7-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Viswanathan M. Lovett S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30094-30100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We have now demonstrated that these ssDNA exonucleases also function redundantly during mismatch correction. Inactivation of ExoI, ExoVII, ExoX, and RecJ conferred a moderate mutator phenotype, and the corresponding cell-free extracts were devoid of normal mismatch repair activity in vitro on model heteroduplexes.The modest increase in mutability observed in the absence of these four activities is less than that observed for other blocks of the MMR pathway, including mutS, mutL, mutH, or uvrDmutant strains. There are two possible explanations for this paradox. The simple heteroduplexes used for biochemical assay may not be good models for natural substrates. Consequently, the four exonucleases studied here may process some but not all mismatches in the cell. The alternate possibility is that all four exonucleases contribute to most, if not all, methyl-directed repair events—the relatively low mutability of the exonuclease-deficient strain may be due to under-recovery of mutants due to lethal events triggered by the occurrence of mismatches in this genetic background. We present evidence elsewhere (27Burdett V. Baitinger C. Viswanathan M. Lovett S.T. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6765-6770Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) that the latter explanation is likely to be correct. Quadruple mutants deficient in the four exonucleases are cold-sensitive for growth, undergo filamentation, and are extremely sensitive to 2-aminopurine, a base analogue that promotes mispairing and triggers the methyl-directed system (31Glickman B.W. Radman M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1063-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). These effects are suppressed by the introduction of null mutations in mutS, mutL, mutH, or uvrD, genes that mediate the earlier steps in the MMR pathway. The exact nature of this lethality is not known, but presumably accumulation of ssDNA displaced during MMR is deleterious to the cell.Depending on the relative position of the mispair to the incision site, different exonucleases are recruited for the excision step of MMR. ExoI, ExoX, and ExoVII are all capable of participating in the 3′ repair pathway. Both ExoI and ExoX are strict 3′→5′ exonucleases (26Viswanathan M. Lovett S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30094-30100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar,32Chase J.W. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 4545-4552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and repair of the 3′ substrate in extracts deficient in these two exonucleases is reduced by 50%. No repair activity above background was detected in extracts when a null mutation in ExoVII was introduced into the ExoI− ExoX− deficient background. The results of this study differ from our earlier finding with respect to the ability of ExoVII to support repair of a 3′ heteroduplex. Whereas previous work failed to detect 3′ heteroduplex repair supported by ExoVII in the reconstituted system (7Cooper D.L. Lahue R.S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11823-11829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we now find that ExoVII can support 3′ heteroduplex repair in both cell-free extracts and the purified system. However, in agreement with the previous study, we find that ExoVII is much less effective in supporting 3′ heteroduplex repair as compared with its activity with 5′ substrates (Fig. 4, comparelanes 3 and 7). In agreement with earlier results (7Cooper D.L. Lahue R.S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11823-11829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we show here that RecJ or ExoVII is sufficient for removal of mismatched bases via excision tracts initiated 5′ of the mismatch. Thus both the 3′ and 5′ exonuclease activities of ExoVII can be utilized in the mismatch correction system.These findings imply redundancy of exonuclease involvement in this mutation avoidance pathway and the level of repair supported by any one of these exonuclease activities is apparently sufficient to maintain a low level of spontaneous mutability. Mismatch repair proficiency is exhibited in the absence of all but one of these four exonucleases, further demonstrating that mismatch excision in vivo is truly bidirectional and can be accomplished from a single direction if necessary.Although recJ and xseA (ExoVII large subunit) orthologues can be found in almost all bacterial genomes sequenced to date, the other exonucleases are apparently more restricted in their distribution. This means that, at least in bacteria, a different assortment of exonucleases is likely to be called into play for the excision step of MMR in different species. The redundancy of exonucleases in E. coli may be due to the specialized roles these enzymes play in other aspects of DNA metabolism. For instance, RecJ mediates recombination via the RecF pathway (20Lovett S.T. Clark A.J. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 157: 190-196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and may process stalled replication forks (33Courcelle J. Hanawalt P.C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1999; 262: 543-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). RecJ and ExoI also assist recombination via the RecBCD pathway (21Viswanathan M. Lovett S.T. Genetics. 1998; 149: 7-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Miesel L. Roth J.R. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3146-3155Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Razavy H. Szigety S.K. Rosenberg S.M.

ExoI and ExoVII play important roles in the avoidance of misalignment errors during replication, such as frameshifts (21Viswanathan M. Lovett S.T. Genetics. 1998; 149: 7-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and quasi-palindrome templated mutations (22Viswanathan M. Lacirignola J.J. Hurley R.L. Lovett S.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 553-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The correction of DNA polymerase misincorporation errors plays an important role in the maintenance of genetic integrity. DNA biosynthetic errors in Escherichia coli are corrected by the methyl-directed mismatch repair (MMR)1 system, which removes incorrect nucleotides by a strand-specific excision reaction that is directed to daughter DNA strands by virtue of the transient absence of d(GATC) methylation within newly synthesized DNA (1Meselson M. Low K.B. The Recombination of Genetic Material. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1988: 91-113Crossref Google Scholar). This system processes both base-base and small insertion/deletion mismatches (2Su S.S. Lahue R.S. Au K.G. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6829-6835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Parker B.O. Marinus M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Inactivation of the genes encoding the nonessential MutH, MutL, MutS, or UvrD components confers a large increase (100–500-fold) in mutation rate (1Meselson M. Low K.B. The Recombination of Genetic Material. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1988: 91-113Crossref Google Scholar, 5Modrich P. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1991; 25: 229-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). Biochemical analysis of the repair of artificial mismatch-containing substrates has defined 10 activities in a methyl-directed excision repair reaction reconstituted with purified components (6Lahue R.S.

Assembly of this ternary complex is sufficient to activate the d(GATC) endonuclease activity of MutH, which incises the unmethylated strand of a hemimethylated d(GATC) sequence (12Au K.G. Welsh K.

That portion of the unwound, incised strand is subject to degradation by one of several single-strand DNA (ssDNA) exonucleases (7Cooper D.L. Lahue R.S. Modrich P. J. Biol.

Finally, DNA ligase restores covalent continuity to the repaired strand (6Lahue R.S. Au K.G. Modrich P. Science. 1989; 245: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). In vitro excision can be directed by an incised d(GATC) site that is located either 5′ or 3′ to the mismatch on the unmethylated strand, and the nature of the exonuclease requirement depends on the relative orientation of the two DNA sites (7Cooper D.L. Lahue R.S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11823-11829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If the initial incision is made 5′ to the mismatch, excision requires either ExoVII or RecJ exonuclease, both of which are capable of 5′→3′ hydrolysis of ssDNA (15Chase J.W. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 4553-4561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Lovett S.T. Kolodner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1964; 239: 2628-2636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is sufficient to meet the exonuclease requirement when d(GATC) incision occurs 3′ to the mispair. Extracts prepared from a RecJ− ExoVII− double mutant are defective in repair directed by a 5′ d(GATC) sequence. However, extracts of ExoI-deficient strains retain repair activity on heteroduplexes where repair is directed by a d(GATC) site located 3′ to the mismatch, suggesting that at least one additional activity can meet the 3′ exonuclease requirement (7Cooper D.L. Lahue R.S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11823-11829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The phenotypes of strains mutant in RecJ, ExoI, and/or ExoVII exonucleases have implicated these genes and their products in DNA repair and recombination (18Kushner S.R. Nagaishi H. Templin A.

In addition, ExoI and ExoVII also appear to have overlapping roles in preventing frameshift and quasi-palindrome templated mutations, two classes of mutations associated with strand slippage during DNA replication (21Viswanathan M.

Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11823-11829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), triple mutants deficient in the three activities fail to show enhanced mutability in assays that score for spontaneous base substitutions, a hallmark of MMR deficiency (21Viswanathan M.

However, it seems unlikely that DNA helicase II alone would be sufficient to support methyl-directed excision, especially when one considers that excision tracts can be a thousand nucleotides or more (14Grilley M.

Inasmuch as ExoI, RecJ, and ExoVII have been implicated in a UV-induced recombination pathway that also depends on MutH, MutL, and MutS mismatch repair activities (25Feng W.Y. Hays J.B. Genetics. 1995; 140: 1175-1186Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and because biochemical experiments have suggested involvement of at least one additional exonuclease in the methyl-directed reaction, we have sought the identity of other exonucleases that might support methyl-directed excision. A novel E. coli 3′→5′ exonuclease, exonuclease X, has recently been identified (26Viswanathan M. Lovett S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30094-30100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This activity hydrolyzes both single- and double-strand DNA, but its affinity for single-strand DNA is approximately 10 times greater than that for duplex DNA. Unlike RecJ, ExoI, and ExoVII, which are processive exonucleases, ExoX is distributive, hydrolyzing only one or a few nucleotides before releasing from its substrate. The fact that ExoX is distributive does not affect its potency as a nuclease; in fact, its affinity for single-strand DNA and its specific activity rival those of RecJ and ExoI. We demonstrate here that ExoX also supports methyl-directed mismatch repair in vitro. The results show that either RecJ or ExoVII is sufficient to meet the exonuclease requirement when excision is initiated 5′ to the mispair, whereas either ExoI, ExoVII, or ExoX is sufficient to meet the exonuclease requirement when excision is initiated 3′ to the mismatch. Simultaneous inactivation of ExoX, ExoI, RecJ, and ExoVII abolishes normal mismatch repair in vitrobut confers only a modest increase in mutation rate. We provide evidence elsewhere (27Burdett V. Baitinger C. Viswanathan M. Lovett S.T. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6765-6770Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) that these exonucleases participate in methyl-directed repair in vivo, and we demonstrate that the relatively low mutability of the quadruple exonuclease mutant is due to under-recovery of mutants as a consequence of lethal events triggered by the occurrence of mismatches in this genetic background. DISCUSSIONPrevious work has implicated E. coli ExoX, as well as the ssDNA exonucleases ExoI, ExoVII, and RecJ, in the repair of UV-damaged DNA (21Viswanathan M. Lovett S.T. Genetics. 1998; 149: 7-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Viswanathan M. Lovett S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30094-30100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We have now demonstrated that these ssDNA exonucleases also function redundantly during mismatch correction. Inactivation of ExoI, ExoVII, ExoX, and RecJ conferred a moderate mutator phenotype, and the corresponding cell-free extracts were devoid of normal mismatch repair activity in vitro on model heteroduplexes.The modest increase in mutability observed in the absence of these four activities is less than that observed for other blocks of the MMR pathway, including mutS, mutL, mutH, or uvrDmutant strains. There are two possible explanations for this paradox. The simple heteroduplexes used for biochemical assay may not be good models for natural substrates. Consequently, the four exonucleases studied here may process some but not all mismatches in the cell. The alternate possibility is that all four exonucleases contribute to most, if not all, methyl-directed repair events—the relatively low mutability of the exonuclease-deficient strain may be due to under-recovery of mutants due to lethal events triggered by the occurrence of mismatches in this genetic background. We present evidence elsewhere (27Burdett V. Baitinger C. Viswanathan M. Lovett S.T. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6765-6770Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) that the latter explanation is likely to be correct. Quadruple mutants deficient in the four exonucleases are cold-sensitive for growth, undergo filamentation, and are extremely sensitive to 2-aminopurine, a base analogue that promotes mispairing and triggers the methyl-directed system (31Glickman B.W. Radman M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1063-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). These effects are suppressed by the introduction of null mutations in mutS, mutL, mutH, or uvrD, genes that mediate the earlier steps in the MMR pathway. The exact nature of this lethality is not known, but presumably accumulation of ssDNA displaced during MMR is deleterious to the cell.Depending on the relative position of the mispair to the incision site, different exonucleases are recruited for the excision step of MMR. ExoI, ExoX, and ExoVII are all capable of participating in the 3′ repair pathway. Both ExoI and ExoX are strict 3′→5′ exonucleases (26Viswanathan M. Lovett S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30094-30100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar,32Chase J.W. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 4545-4552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and repair of the 3′ substrate in extracts deficient in these two exonucleases is reduced by 50%. No repair activity above background was detected in extracts when a null mutation in ExoVII was introduced into the ExoI− ExoX− deficient background. The results of this study differ from our earlier finding with respect to the ability of ExoVII to support repair of a 3′ heteroduplex. Whereas previous work failed to detect 3′ heteroduplex repair supported by ExoVII in the reconstituted system (7Cooper D.L. Lahue R.S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11823-11829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we now find that ExoVII can support 3′ heteroduplex repair in both cell-free extracts and the purified system. However, in agreement with the previous study, we find that ExoVII is much less effective in supporting 3′ heteroduplex repair as compared with its activity with 5′ substrates (Fig. 4, comparelanes 3 and 7). In agreement with earlier results (7Cooper D.L. Lahue R.S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11823-11829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we show here that RecJ or ExoVII is sufficient for removal of mismatched bases via excision tracts initiated 5′ of the mismatch. Thus both the 3′ and 5′ exonuclease activities of ExoVII can be utilized in the mismatch correction system.These findings imply redundancy of exonuclease involvement in this mutation avoidance pathway and the level of repair supported by any one of these exonuclease activities is apparently sufficient to maintain a low level of spontaneous mutability. Mismatch repair proficiency is exhibited in the absence of all but one of these four exonucleases, further demonstrating that mismatch excision in vivo is truly bidirectional and can be accomplished from a single direction if necessary.Although recJ and xseA (ExoVII large subunit) orthologues can be found in almost all bacterial genomes sequenced to date, the other exonucleases are apparently more restricted in their distribution. This means that, at least in bacteria, a different assortment of exonucleases is likely to be called into play for the excision step of MMR in different species. The redundancy of exonucleases in E. coli may be due to the specialized roles these enzymes play in other aspects of DNA metabolism. For instance, RecJ mediates recombination via the RecF pathway (20Lovett S.T. Clark A.J. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 157: 190-196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and may process stalled replication forks (33Courcelle J. Hanawalt P.C. Mol. Gen.

Currently, there are conflicting views about the distribution of heme in flavocytochrome b, and the exact location and coordination of these hemes have not been elucidated.

Since the integrity of residues essential for heme binding dictates successful biosynthetic maturation of flavocytochrome b, we reasoned that their replacement would compromise heme insertion and thus surface expression of functional protein. To identify histidines in gp91phox that bind heme and to determine the impact of heme acquisition on the subsequent biosynthetic maturation and processing of flavocytochrome b, we introduced point substitutions at each of the seven histidines that lie within the proposed transmembrane domains of gp91phox and examined the effects on flavocytochromeb expression and function.

A human promyelocytic cell line (PLB-985), a derivative cell line with a gene-targeted disruption of the CYBB gene (X-CGD PLB-985), and X-CGD PLB-985 cells constitutively expressing either a wild-type (WT) or mutant (as indicated) gp91phox transgene were maintained as described (31Zhen L. King A. Xiao Y. Chanock S. Orkin S. Dinauer M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9832-9836Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). For granulocytic differentiation, cells at a starting density of 1 × 105 cells/ml were exposed to 0.5% N,N-dimethylformamide for 6 days. The monkey kidney COS7 cell line expressing transgenic human p22phox (COS22) made previously by stable transfection of the full-length p22phox cDNA into parental COS7 wild-type cells was maintained as described (23Yu L. Zhen L. Dinauer M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27288-27294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Nucleotide changes that altered the coding sequence for individual histidine residues were introduced into a full-length wild-type gp91phoxcDNA and cloned into the NotI site of the multiple cloning site of pBluescript II KS(+) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The sequence of wild-type or mutant gp91phox cDNAs was verified by dideoxynucleotide sequencing and subcloned into the pEF-PGKpac mammalian expression vector (31Zhen L. King A. Xiao Y. Chanock S. Orkin S. Dinauer M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nucleotide changes in gp91phox expression constructs were confirmed after subcloning into pEF-PGKpac by dideoxynucleotide sequencing. The pEF-PGKpac constructs were either electroporated into X-CGD PLB cells following linearization with KpnI or transfected into p22phox-expressing COS7 cells using LipofectAMINE Plus (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Following transfection, clones were selected by limiting dilution in 2 µg/ml puromycin (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) and screened for gp91phox expression by immunoblots using mAb 48. To minimize any clone-to-clone variation in recombinant gp91phoxexpression or NADPH oxidase activity, three to four independent clones determined to express transgenic gp91phox were pooled and used for subsequent analysis. The WT and mutant cDNAs were also subcloned into the pRK5 mammalian expression vector (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) for transient expression in COS22 cells, which were harvested 24 h after transfection with LipfectAMINE Plus (Life Technologies). All preparations and manipulations of plasmids were performed using standard protocols (32Maniatis T. Fritsch E. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.

A single gate was used to eliminate dead cells and debris. Cultured COS7 and derivative cell lines were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, removed from the tissue culture plates by treating with 1 ml of trypsin-EDTA (Life Technologies) at room temperature for 5 min and harvested by centrifugation at 500 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C.

PLB-985 and derivative cell lines were harvested by centrifugation at 500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and washed once with cold phosphate-buffered saline. After treatment with 2.7 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate for 10 min on ice, Triton X-100 extracts of whole cells were made as previously described (23Yu L. Zhen L. Dinauer M. J. Biol.

Metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation of flavocytochromeb in each cell line were performed using previously described protocols (25DeLeo F.R. Burritt J.B., Yu, L. Jesaitis A.J. Dinauer M.C.

Superoxide dismutase-inhibitable NADPH oxidase activity was measured in granulocyte-differentiated PLB-985 cell lines following stimulation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (100 ng/ml) as described previously (31Zhen L. King A. Xiao Y. Chanock S. Orkin S. Dinauer M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9832-9836Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The assays were performed at 37 °C using a Thermomax microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA), and superoxide production was calculated using an extinction coefficient of 21.1 mm−1 cm−1 for cytochrome c. Data were analyzed using SOFTMAX version 2.02, and the V max was calculated over a 3-min interval. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Instat, version 2.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). Alternatively, qualitative assessment of NADPH oxidase activity in single cells was performed using the nitro blue tetrazolium test, as previously described (31Zhen L. King A. Xiao Y. Chanock S.

Flavocytochrome b was partially purified from PLB-985, and cells expressing WT gp91phox or derivatives with substitutions of specific His residues using the method of Cross and Curnutte (35Cross A. Curnutte J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6543-6548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) but with a few modifications. Cells (3–4 × 108) were disrupted using nitrogen bomb cavitation in a 1-ml volume as described by Borregaard et al. (36Borregaard N. Heilpe J. Simons E. Clark R. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 52-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar), and nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 300 × g for 8 min at 4 °C. 5.0 m NaCl was added to clarified supernatants so that the final concentration was 1.0 m. Membranes were sedimented at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C and then suspended in 0.5 ml of buffer F (50 mmsodium phosphate, pH 7.2, containing 1.0%n-heptyl-(β-d-thioglucopyranoside, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 20% glycerol, and 5 µg/ml aprotinin) using sonication and solubilized on ice overnight. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and solubilized membranes were incubated sequentially with 100-µl bed volumes of ω-amino-octyl-agarose and DEAE- and CM-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h at 4 °C. The precleared supernatant was passed twice through a 1.0-ml Heparin HiTrap column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After washing with 10 ml of buffer F containing 0.1% n-heptyl-(β-d-thioglucopyranoside, flavocytochrome b was eluted in six 0.5-ml fractions using buffer F containing 0.5%n-heptyl-(β-d-thioglucopyranoside and 1.5m NaCl. Fractions were diluted 3-fold with buffer F and then pooled and concentrated using a Centricon 10 (Amicon, Inc., Beverly, MA) so that the final volume was ≤1 ml. The concentration of flavocytochrome b in each eluent was determined by oxidation-reduction difference spectroscopy, using an extinction coefficient of 106 mm−1cm−1 for the (γ peak at 426–428 nm (37Metcalf J. Gallin J. Nauseef W. Root R. Laboratory Manual of Neutrophil Function. Raven Press, New York1986Google Scholar). Samples were normalized to the amount of co-purifying myeloperoxidase calculated from its absorbance peak at 475 nm using an extinction coefficient of 89 mm−1 cm−1. Effect of point mutations of candidate heme-binding histidines in gp91phox on flavocytochrome b expression. His residues in membrane-spanning helices of gp91phox, located in the N-terminal portion of the protein, are believed to coordinate axial heme binding (22Yu L. Quinn M. Cross A. Dinauer M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7993-7998Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), although the specific residues have not been identified. In the bis-heme cytochrome b subunit of the mitochondrial cytochrome bc1 complex, the two hemes are bis-histidine ligated to the same pair of parallel transmembrane α-helices, with the ligating histidine residue in each helix separated by 13 amino acids (38Robertson D. Farid R. Moser C. Urbauer J. Mulholland S. Pidikiti R. Lear J. Wand A. DeGrado W. Dutton P. Nature. 1994; 368: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Inspection of the gp91phox sequence reveals seven candidate histidine residues that lie within proposed transmembrane domains (Fig.1). Transmembrane pairs His101 and His115 (13 residues apart) and His209 and His222 (12 residues apart) are absolutely conserved in NOX family flavocytochromes and in the more distantly related yeast flavocytochrome, FRE1, where both histidine pairs are 13 residues apart (39Lambeth D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 459-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 40Finegold A. Shatwell K. Segal A. Klausner R. Dancis A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 14240-14244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). However, His111, His119, and His210 are also conserved between gp91phox and at least one other NOX family member. We previously demonstrated that blocking acquisition of heme by gp65 prevents heterodimer formation and biosynthetic maturation in myeloid cells (24Yu L. DeLeo F. Biberstine-Kinkade K. Renee J. Nauseef W. Dinauer M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 274: 4364-4369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 25DeLeo F.R. Burritt J.B., Yu, L. Jesaitis A.J. Dinauer M.C. Nauseef W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13986-13993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Therefore, we reasoned that disrupting any of the actual heme-binding His residues in gp91phox should prevent normal flavocytochrome b maturation and cell surface expression. To determine whether His residues residing within the predicted transmembrane domains of gp91phox bind heme and therefore impact flavocytochrome b expression and function, we therefore generated gp91phox constructs harboring amino acid changes at His101, His111, His115, His119, His209, His210, and His222. In most cases, Leu or Cys was substituted for His; in addition, in certain instances, His residues were replaced with Arg or Tyr. gp91phox derivatives were first expressed in COS7 cells that express human p22phox from a stable transgene (COS22 cells) as a means to rapidly assess the affects of amino acid changes on gp91phox expression. To identify which His residues in gp91phox were necessary for plasma membrane expression of flavocytochrome b, we compared surface-expressed flavocytochrome b on COS22 cells transiently transfected with expression constructs encoding either wild type gp91phoxor mutant gp91phox with one of the following amino acid substitutions: H101L, H111L, H115L, H119L, H209C, H209Y, H210L, or H222L (Fig. 2 A). Cells were stained with 7D5, a monoclonal antibody that recognizes a conformational epitope on an extracellular domain of flavocytochromeb that depends on normal heterodimer formation (34Burritt J. DeLeo F. McDonald C. Prigge J. Dinauer M. Nakamura M. Nauseef W. Jesaitis A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2053-2061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and analyzed by flow cytometry (Fig. 2 A). COS22 cells expressing wild type or H111L, H119L, and H210L forms of gp91phox produced surface-expressed flavocytochrome b, consistent with normal processing and export of gp91phox to the plasma membrane. In contrast, H101L-, H115L-, H209C-, H209Y-, and H222L-expressing cells lacked surface-associated flavocytochrome b, and 7D5 staining was similar to that of mock-transfected COS22 cells (Fig.2 A). Moreover, H101L-, H115L-, H209C-, and H222L-expressing cells synthesized gp65 but lacked mature gp91phox (Fig.2 B). Given the capacity of COS7 transfectants to deliver free subunits as well as heterodimer to the cell surface (22Yu L. Quinn M. Cross A. Dinauer M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7993-7998Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), the failure of these mutant forms of gp65 to be processed to gp91phox suggests that heme insertion per se is an important and independent determinant in the structural maturation of flavocytochrome b. That COS7 cells can express either monomeric gp91phox or p22phox on their cell surface (Ref. 22Yu L. Quinn M. Cross A. Dinauer M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7993-7998Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar and data not shown) conflicts with data demonstrating that neither subunit can be expressed individually in myeloid cells (42Segal A. Nature. 1987; 326: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 43Parkos C. Dinauer M. Jesaitis A. Orkin S. Curnutte J. Blood. 1989; 73: 1416-1420Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The disparity in protein processing between these two cell types suggests that the requirements for biosynthetic maturation of proteins and endoplasmic reticulum quality control in COS7 cells may differ from those of human myeloid cells. Therefore, we investigated the surface expression of flavocytochrome b composed of wild type and mutant forms of gp91phox in transfected human myeloid cells (Fig.2 C). Consistent with the results observed from the analysis of COS7 cells, surface-expressed flavocytochrome b and mature gp91phox were found only in the WT gp91phox-, H111L-, H119L-, and H210L-expressing myeloid cells (Fig. 2, C and D), although gp91phox with an H111R mutation was expressed only as the immature gp65 form (Fig. 2 D). Cells containing H101L, H115L, H115D, H209C, H222L, H222R, and H222C forms of gp91phox lacked plasma membrane-associated flavocytochrome b and mature gp91phox (Fig. 2, C and D, and data not shown). In addition, very little p22phox was expressed in those cells, similar to that observed in X-CGD PLB-985 cells, probably reflecting an adverse effect of these amino acid changes on heterodimer formation (Fig. 2 D and data not shown). That abnormal processing of gp91phox mutants with substitutions at His101, His115, His209, or His222 was similar in nonmyeloid and myeloid cells suggests that His residues at these positions were critical for biosynthetic maturation and export of mature flavocytochrome b to the plasma membrane, regardless of differences in protein processing between the two expression systems. Treating human myeloid cells with succinyl acetone, a heme synthesis inhibitor, blocks gp91phox-p22phox heterodimer formation (25DeLeo F.R. Burritt J.B., Yu, L. Jesaitis A.J. Dinauer M.C. Nauseef W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13986-13993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that heme imparts a structural constraint to gp91phox, necessary for it to bind p22phox, or that gp91phox and p22phox are linked directly through heme, as previously proposed by Quinn et al. (17Quinn M. Mullen M. Jesaitis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7303-7309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To examine the biochemical basis for the heme requirement in flavocytochromeb maturation, we immunoprecipi"
https://openalex.org/W2044274656,"Many cytochrome P450 (P450)-dependent reactions have been shown to be stimulated by another microsomal protein, cytochrome b 5(b 5). Two major explanations are (i) direct electron transfer from b 5 and (ii) a conformational effect in the absence of electron transfer. Some P450s (e.g. 3A4, 2C9, 17A, and 4A7) are stimulated by eitherb 5 or b 5 devoid of heme (apo-b 5), indicating a lack of electron transfer, whereas other P450s (e.g. 2E1) are stimulated byb 5 but not by apo-b 5. Recently, a proposal has been made by Guryev et al.(Biochemistry 40, 5018–5031, 2001) that the stimulation by apo-b 5 can be explained only by transfer of heme from P450 preparations to apo-b 5, enabling electron transfer. We have repeated earlier findings of stimulation of catalytic activity of testosterone 6β-hydroxylation activities with four P450 preparations, in which nearly all of the heme was accounted for as P450. Spectral analysis of mixtures indicated that only ∼5% of the heme can be transferred to apo-b 5, which cannot account for the observed stimulation. The presence of the heme scavenger apomyoglobin did not inhibit the stimulation of P450 3A4-dependent testosterone or nifedipine oxidation activity. Further evidence against the presence of loosely bound P450 3A4 heme was provided in experiments with apo-heme oxygenase, in which only 3% of the P450 heme was converted to biliverdin. Finally,b 5 supported NADH-b 5reductase/P450 3A4-dependent testosterone 6β-hydroxylation, but apo-b 5 did not. Thus, apo-b 5 can stimulate P450 3A4 reactions as well as b 5 in the absence of electron transfer, and heme transfer from P450 3A4 to apo-b 5 cannot be used to explain the catalytic stimulation. Many cytochrome P450 (P450)-dependent reactions have been shown to be stimulated by another microsomal protein, cytochrome b 5(b 5).

The most common mode of catalysis is mixed-function oxidation, which involves the use of both electrons and O2 as substrates. Electron input from pyridine nucleotides into P450s usually follows one of two general modes. The first, which is common in some bacterial and mitochondrial P450s, involves transfer of electrons from a flavoprotein to an iron-sulfur protein to P450 heme. The other major reaction, which is common in the microsomal P450s, involves electron transfer from a 2-flavin flavoprotein (NADPH-P450 reductase) into the P450 heme. Some P450-catalyzed reactions are stimulated byb 5, as first discovered in a series of studies in which NADH stimulated NADPH-dependent reactions in liver microsomes (7Hildebrandt A. Estabrook R.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1971; 143: 66-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). The role of b 5 in some reactions was later reinforced in reconstitution (8Imai Y. J. Biochem.

An added complexity is that NADPH-P450 reductase reduces b 5 efficiently as well as P450s, rendering the path of electron transfer difficult to establish in most cases. In general, direct electron transfer to ferric P450 is inefficient because of the unfavorable difference in oxidation potentials (19Velick S.F. Strittmatter P. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1485-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Until recently, the generally accepted mechanism for b 5 stimulation has been introduction of an electron into the P450 FeO 22+ complex, which is considered to have a much higher oxidation-reduction potential than the P450 Fe3+/Fe2+ couple (19Velick S.F.

Early studies with liver microsomes showed changes in the redox state ofb 5 (7Hildebrandt A. Estabrook R.W. Arch. Biochem.

Other early experiments withb 5 substituted with redox-inactive metals were also used to argue in favor of an electron transfer mechanism. However, this issue has been difficult to address directly because of the kinetic complexities in mixing b 5 with P450 in the P450 FeO 22+ form (24Pompon D. Coon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 15377-15385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Guengerich F.P. Johnson W.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14741-14750Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 26Perret A. Pompon D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11412-11424Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In 1995, we reported that the reduction of ferric P450 3A4 required the presence of b 5 for maximum rates, as well as a substrate (testosterone) (27Yamazaki H. Ueng Y.-F. Shimada T. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8380-8389Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The following year, in the course of doing what were intended to be controls for other experiments, we found that apo-b 5 was as effective asb 5 in stimulating P450 3A4-catalyzed testosterone 6β-hydroxylation and nifedipine oxidation (22Yamazaki H.

We extended this work and reported that P450 2C9 reactions were stimulated by apo-b 5 as well as b 5, but with P450 2E1, only b 5 was stimulatory (28Yamazaki H. Gillam E.M.J. Dong M.-S. Johnson W.W. Guengerich F.P. Shimada T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 342: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Other laboratories reported the stimulation of P450s 17A (29Auchus R.J. Lee T.C. Miller W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3158-3165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar) and 4A7 (30Loughran P.A. Roman L.J. Miller R.T. Masters B.S.S. Arch. Biochem.

Recent work in our own groups has also shown stimulation of catalytic activities of P450s 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C19, and 3A5 by both b 5 and apo-b 5. 2H. Yamazaki, M. Nakamura, T. Komatsu, K. Ohyama, M.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6063-6069Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The extent of stimulation does vary in different systems, and the reconstituted systems with higher activities appear to show less stimulation (22Yamazaki H. Johnson W.W. Ueng Y.-F. Shimada T.

Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 325: 174-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). However, the effect is usually 2–4-fold. Bacterial or baculovirus-based insect cell membranes in which P450 3A4 and NADPH-P450 reductase are simultaneously expressed have high catalytic activities (including testosterone 6β-hydroxylation activity) in the absence of b 5 (25Guengerich F.P.

Shimada N. Gillam E.M.J. Guengerich F.P. Shimada T. Yokoi T. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1999; 27: 999-1004PubMed Google Scholar). The critical issue here is what the role ofb 5 is in liver (or other tissues), and studies with anti-b 5 antibodies have shown a strong contribution of b 5 to catalytic activity in liver microsomes, regardless of the mechanism (33Guengerich F.P. Martin M.V. Beaune P.H. Kremers P. Wolff T. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5051-5060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Yamazaki H. Nakano M. Imai Y. Ueng Y.-F. Guengerich F.P. Shimada T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 325: 174-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The conclusions reached with apo-b 5 may or may not be relevant to microsomes. However, these stimulatory effects have been observed with numerous purified P450 preparations (3A4, 2C9, 17A, and 4A7) (22Yamazaki H. Johnson W.W. Ueng Y.-F. Shimada T. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15110-15120Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and conclusions about modulation of catalytic activities are not surprising in light of our current general understanding of protein-protein interactions. Some P450s have even shown catalytic stimulation by other P450s (28Yamazaki H. Gillam E.M.J. Dong M.-S. Johnson W.W. Guengerich F.P. Shimada T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 342: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 38Backes W.L. Batie C.J. Cawley G.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12852-12859Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, very recently, Guryev et al. (39Guryev O.L. Gilep A.A. Usanov S.A. Estabrook R.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5018-5031Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) have questioned the conclusions of the apo-b 5 studies (22Yamazaki H. Johnson W.W. Ueng Y.-F. Shimada T. Guengerich F.P.

Dispos. 1999; 27: 999-1004PubMed Google Scholar). They repeated the experiments cited above with P450s 3A4 and 17A and also found stimulation of catalytic activities by apo-b 5. Some transfer of heme to apo-b 5 was also found; the issue of whether the source was the P450 itself (3A4 or 17A) or adventitiously bound heme was unresolved. These investigators also added heme to purified apo-b 5 and apomyoglobin and characterized the binding as rapid and tight. A key experiment was the subsequent use of apomyoglobin as a heme scavenger in blocking stimulation by apo-b 5 (39Guryev O.L. Gilep A.A. Usanov S.A. Estabrook R.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5018-5031Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The results of Guryev et al. (39Guryev O.L. Gilep A.A. Usanov S.A. Estabrook R.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5018-5031Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) are not in accord with the previously held general view about the lack of electron transfer in the stimulation of some reactions by apo-b 5. Concerns involve the report of the presence of excess heme (30%?) in the preparations and the relatively low fraction of transfer of heme (∼ 10%) (39Guryev O.L. Gilep A.A. Usanov S.A. Estabrook R.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5018-5031Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We address some of the issues raised in that work, those that bear directly on the issues of how much heme transfer contributes to the stimulation of P450 activities by apo-b 5 and b 5. Other experiments presented (39Guryev O.L. Gilep A.A. Usanov S.A. Estabrook R.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5018-5031Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) do not directly address the question and are not considered here (e.g. binding to P450, truncations, mutants and use of alternate metals, and reduction in the absence of substrate); differences between apo-b 5,b 5, and b 5 derivatives may seem subtle but are known to have cooperative structural effects (40Falzone C.J. Wang Y. Vu B.C. Scott N.L. Bhattacharya S. Lecomte J.T.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4879-4891Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) that may not be readily interpreted. We considered a set of P450 3A4 preparations made since the earlier work (22Yamazaki H. Johnson W.W. Ueng Y.-F. Shimada T. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27438-27444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 28Yamazaki H. Gillam E.M.J. Dong M.-S. Johnson W.W. Guengerich F.P. Shimada T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 342: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) because our purification methodology has been changed. In these preparations we account for nearly all of the measured heme as P450, although some key experiments were done with a preparation of one of the stocks in which 30% of the P450 had converted to cytochrome P420. Our earlier reported stimulatory effects of apo-b 5 were fully repeatable, and we proceeded to focus on events that could occur in the time frame used to see the stimulations, e.g. reconstitution and assay. The transfer of 3–5% of the heme from P450 3A4 preparations does occur with apo-b 5 or the enzyme heme oxygenase, with conversion of heme to biliverdin in the latter case. This fraction is attributed to trace cytochrome P420 and adds evidence to the view that heme oxygenase, which is normally involved in the physiological degradation of free heme, does not act directly on P450 heme. The lack of an effect of highly purified apomyoglobin as a heme scavenger and the inability of apo-b 5 to support NADH-b 5 reductase/P450 3A4-catalyzed testosterone 6β-hydroxylation provide more evidence against an obligatory role for heme transfer to apo-b 5 in the stimulations of P450s. Biliverdin (IXα) was purchased from ICN (Costa Mesa, CA). Horse apomyoglobin (sequencing grade) was obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. UV-visible spectra were recorded using OLIS-Cary 14 and -Amino DW2 instruments (On-Line Instrument Systems, Bogart, GA). HPLC was done with a Spectra-Physics 8700 pumping system and ThermoSeparation 6000 rapid scanning monochromator or a JASCO PU-980 pumping system (Japan Spectroscopic Co., Tokyo, Japan) and Chromatopac C-R3A detector (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan).

Biophys. 1998; 350: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Purification was done using DEAE and Ni2+ affinity chromatography as described by Hosea et al. (44Hosea N.A. Miller G.P. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5929-5939Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Rat NADPH-P450 reductase was expressed in E. coli (45Shen A.L. Porter T.D. Wilson T.E. Kasper C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7584-7589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and purified as described elsewhere (46Hanna I.H. Reed J.R. Guengerich F.P. Hollenberg P.F. Arch. Biochem.

Rabbit liver NADH-b 5 reductase was prepared as described previously (50Mihara K. Sato R. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1975; 78: 1057-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and had a specific activity of 24.3 µmol K3Fe3(CN)6 reduced min−1 (nmol reductase)−1 (gift of Y. Imai; University Osaka Prefecture, Osaka, Japan). E. coli-expressed human heme oxygenase (devoid of 23 residues at the C terminus) (51Wilks A. Black S.M. Miller W.L. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4421-4427Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) was a gift of K. Auclair and P. R. Ortiz de Montellano (University of California, San Francisco, CA). The heme in the sample (36 nmol of enzyme) was converted to biliverdin by incubation with an equal concentration of NADPH-P450 reductase in the presence of 0.10 m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and an NADPH-generating system (vide infra). Spectral analysis indicated that the reaction was complete in the first minute. The mixture (in 3 ml) was applied to a 1.2 × 60-cm Sephadex G-10 column equilibrated with 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.4) containing 0.10 mm EDTA and eluted with the same. The void volume fraction was detected by A 280measurements; spectral analysis indicated the apparent presence of stable NADPH-P450 reductase flavin semiquinone. The sample was concentrated (to 1.9 ml) using an Amicon-Millipore ultrafiltration device equipped with a PM-10 membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Protein analysis indicated nearly complete recovery of the apo-heme oxygenase and NADPH-P450 reductase. This preparation of apo-heme oxygenase was used with hemin chloride, and a preliminary spectral analysis indicated that it was capable of forming biliverdin. NADPH-P450 reductase was added to the apo-heme oxygenase preparation in subsequent work with P450 3A4. The following order of mixing was used (all concentrations are for a final incubation mixture in 0.25 ml): P450 3A4 (20 nm), NADPH-P450 reductase (40 nm),b 5 or apo-b 5 (0–40 nm, usually 20 nm unless stated otherwise), apomyoglobin (10–40 nm, when indicated), sodium cholate (0.5 mm), and a phospholipid mixture (20 µg/ml) consisting of a 1:1:1 (w/w/w) mixture ofl-α-dilauroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine,l-α-dioleyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, and bovine brain phosphatidylserine (34Imaoka S. Imai Y. Shimada T. Funae Y. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6063-6069Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar); these components were mixed in concentrated solution before dilution and allowed to stand for 10 min at room temperature, followed by the addition of potassium phosphate buffer (to 100 mm; pH 7.4), MgCl2 (to 5 mm), testosterone (to 200 µm), and an NADPH-generating system consisting of 5 mm glucose 6-phosphate, 0.5 mm NADP+, and 0.5 unit of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase ml−1. Incubations proceeded for 10 min at 37 °C. Reactions were terminated, and the products were analyzed by HPLC (octadecylsilane column;A 240; 1.0 ml min−1 flow rate; 64% CH3OH in H2O (v/v)). Heme was estimated using the pyridine hemochrome method, with Δε557–575 = 32.4 mm−1 cm−1 (52Omura T. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2370-2378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 53Falk, J. E. (1964) Porphyrins and Metalloporphyrins, pp. 81 and 240–241, Elsevier, Amsterdam.Google Scholar). Biliverdin was extracted from incubations with acetone-HCl and analyzed by HPLC as described by Bonkowsky et al. (54Bonkovsky H.L. Wood S.G. Howell S.K. Sinclair P.R. Lincoln B. Healey J.F. Sinclair J.F. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 155: 56-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), using a Zorbax octadecylsilane column (3 µm; 6.2 × 80 mm; MacModd, Chadds Ford, PA) and both 670 and 405 nm measurements. Since our first report of the stimulation of P450 3A4 activities by b 5 and apo-b 5 (22Yamazaki H. Johnson W.W. Ueng Y.-F. Shimada T. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27438-27444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), the preparation of recombinant P450 3A4 has been changed in this laboratory. A C-terminal (His)5 tag had been incorporated to facilitate purification (44Hosea N.A. Miller G.P. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5929-5939Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Purification of P450s is done in the absence of nonionic detergents because these compounds have been found to be substrates for P450s, particularly P450 3A4 (55Hosea N.A. Guengerich F.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 353: 365-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Four preparations were used in this work. All had been prepared during the time period 1998–2001 and stored at −20 °C. All were relatively low in P420, as indicated in some of the figures presented later (P420 indicates spectrally distinct denatured P450 or loosely bound heme). Analysis of these preparations for P450 (Δε450–490 = 91 mm−1cm−1 for Fe2+·CO versusFe2+) and heme (pyridine hemochrome Δε557–575 = 32.4 mm−1cm−1) gave the following respective concentrations in the preparations: 21.3 µm P450 and 21.6 µm heme (Fig. 1 A); 16.0 µm P450 and 14.1 µm heme (Fig.1 B); 34.4 µm P450 and 34.6 µmheme (Fig. 1 C); 69.3 µm P450 and 67.7 µm heme (Fig. 1 D). Thus, the heme appears to be present nearly completely as P450, assuming the accuracy of these extinction coefficients (52Omura T. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2370-2378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 53Falk, J. E. (1964) Porphyrins and Metalloporphyrins, pp. 81 and 240–241, Elsevier, Amsterdam.Google Scholar) and allowing for what is probably ∼5% error in replicate measurements. With all four of these P450 3A4 preparations, b 5and apo-b 5 both stimulated testosterone 6β-hydroxylation nearly equally (Fig. 1). The extent of stimulation was 3–4-fold, similar to that reported earlier with other preparations of these proteins (22Yamazaki H. Johnson W.W. Ueng Y.-F. Shimada T. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2027933427,"Neuroprostanes are prostaglandin-like compounds produced by free radical-induced peroxidation of docosahexaenoic acid, which is highly enriched in the brain. We previously described the formation of highly reactive γ-ketoaldehydes (isoketals) as products of the isoprostane pathway of free radical-induced peroxidation of arachidonic acid. We therefore explored whether isoketal-like compounds (neuroketals) are also formed via the neuroprostane pathway. Utilizing mass spectrometric analyses, neuroketals were found to be formed in abundance in vitroduring oxidation of docosahexaenoic acid and were formed in greater abundance than isoketals during co-oxidation of docosahexaenoic and arachidonic acid. Neuroketals were shown to rapidly adduct to lysine, forming lactam and Schiff base adducts. Neuroketal lysyl-lactam protein adducts were detected in nonoxidized rat brain synaptosomes at a level of 0.09 ng/mg of protein, which increased 19-fold following oxidationin vitro. Neuroketal lysyl-lactam protein adducts were also detected in vivo in normal human brain at a level of 9.9 ± 3.7 ng/g of brain tissue. These studies identify a new class of highly reactive molecules that may participate in the formation of protein adducts and protein-protein cross-links in neurodegenerative diseases and contribute to the injurious effects of other oxidative pathologies in the brain.

We propose to term these nonenzymatically generated γ-ketoaldehydes isoketals (IsoKs) to distinguish them from levuglandins formed by rearrangement of the cyclooxygenase endoperoxide intermediate, PGH2 (5Salomon R.G. Miller D.B. Zagorski M.G. Coughlin D.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984; 106: 6049-6060Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar). These extremely reactive molecules form covalent adducts with lysine residues on proteins at a rate that exceeds that of 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE) by orders of magnitude, which is considered to be one of the most reactive aldehydes generated as a product of lipid peroxidation (6Esterbauer H. Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1991; 11: 81-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (5902) Google Scholar). Moreover, they exhibit a remarkable proclivity to cross-link proteins. We have previously shown that IsoKs initially form a reversible Schiff base adduct, which then proceeds through a pyrrole to stable lactam and hydroxylactam adducts (7Boutaud O. Brame C.J.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9389-9396Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).2 Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (22:6ω3) is a polyunsaturated fatty acid uniquely enriched in the brain and retina, especially in synaptic membranes and in photoreceptor cells (8Anderson B.E.

Astrocytes play an important role in the delivery of DHA to the blood-brain barrier endothelial cells and to neurons (11Bernoud N. Fenart L. Benistant C. Pageaux J.F. Dehouck M.P. Moliere P.

Although the physiologic basis for why DHA is enriched in the brain and retina remains unclear, reduced levels of DHA are associated with disturbances in visual acuity, behavior, and learning in young animals and humans (13Jensen M.M.

We had previously demonstrated the formation of IsoP-like compoundsin vivo from free radical-catalyzed peroxidation of DHA (16Nourooz-Zadeh J. Liu E.H. Anggard E. Halliwell B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 242: 338-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar,17Roberts L.J. Montine T.J. Markesbery W.R. Tapper A.R. Hardy P. Chemtob S. Dettbarn W.D. Morrow J.D. J. Biol.

Because DHA is highly concentrated in nervous system tissue, we have termed these compounds neuroprostanes (NPs) (17Roberts L.J. Montine T.J. Markesbery W.R. Tapper A.R. Hardy P. Chemtob S. Dettbarn W.D. Morrow J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13605-13612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Analogous to the formation of IsoPs, the formation of NPs also proceeds through bicyclic endoperoxide intermediates that not only are reduced to F-ring compounds but also undergo rearrangement in vivo to form D- and E-ring NPs (17Roberts L.J. Montine T.J. Markesbery W.R. Tapper A.R. Hardy P. Chemtob S. Dettbarn W.D. Morrow J.D. J. Biol.

Therefore, we explored the hypothesis that IsoK-like compounds could also be generated as rearrangement products of the NP pathway, for which we propose the term neuroketals (NKs). Our interest in the possibility that NKs could be formed derives from the fact that free radicals have been implicated in the pathogenesis of a wide variety of neurodegenerative disorders, including Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease (19Knight J.A.

Furthermore, reactive aldehydes are thought to be key mediators of oxidant injury because of their capacity to covalently modify proteins and DNA (4Brame C.J. Salomon R.G. Morrow J.D. Roberts L.J. J.

The notion that NKs, if formed, may at least participate in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease is strengthened by our previous finding that F4-NP levels are significantly increased in cerebrospinal fluid from patients with this disease (17Roberts L.J. Montine T.J. Markesbery W.R. Tapper A.R. Hardy P. Chemtob S. Dettbarn W.D. Morrow J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13605-13612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). The pathway by which NKs can be generated is shown in Fig.1, A–C. Five docosahexaenoyl radicals are initially formed that are then converted to eight peroxyl radicals following the addition of oxygen. These undergo endocyclization followed by further addition of molecular oxygen to form eight bicyclic endoperoxide intermediate regioisomers, which can then rearrange to form eight D4-NK and eight E4-NK regioisomers. The designation “D” and “E” is a carryover from the established prostaglandin nomenclature for PGD and PGE and levuglandins E and D to indicate the location of the keto group. Each regioisomer is theoretically comprised of eight racemic diastereoisomers for a total of 128 D4-type and 128 E4-type NKs. In accordance with the nomenclature system for IsoPs that has been approved by the Eicosanoid Nomenclature Committee, the eight regioisomers are designated by the carbon number on the side chain of the precursor endoperoxide intermediates where the hydroxyl group was located, with the carboxyl carbon as C1 (29Taber D.F.

Male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats were from Harlan Sprague-Dawley, Inc.

The purification and analysis of NKs followed similar procedures used for purification and analysis of IsoKs (4Brame C.J. Salomon R.G. Morrow J.D. Roberts L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13139-13146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Following oxidation of DHA, compounds were converted to O-methyloxime derivatives by treatment with a 3% aqueous solution of methoxyamine HCl. The pH of the reaction mix was then adjusted to 3, and the samples were extracted using a C18 Sep Pak cartridge. The compounds were then converted to a pentafluorobenzyl ester derivative, purified by TLC using the solvent heptane/ethyl acetate (60:40, v/v), converted to a trimethylsilyl ether derivative, and quantified by GC/NICI/MS using [2H4]PGE2 as an internal standard and a modification of the method used to purify and analyze IsoKs (4Brame C.J.

The region extending from 1.5 cm above to 2.5 cm above anO-methyloxime pentafluorobenzyl ester derivative of [2H4]PGE2 standard was scraped. This area was determined to contain NKs by analyzing sequential small cuts of the TLC plates. NKs were detected by GC/NICI/MS employing selected ion monitoring for the M-⋅CH2C6F5 ions (m/z 505 for NKs and m/z 528 for the [2H4]PGE2 internal standard. Catalytic hydrogenation was performed as described previously (31Morrow J.D. Harris T.M. Roberts L.J. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 184: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Purification and analysis of F4-NPs and IsoKs by GC/NICI/MS was performed as described (4Brame C.J. Salomon R.G. Morrow J.D. Roberts L.J. J. Biol.

To reduce and stabilize Schiff base adducts, 110 volume of 1m sodium borohydride in DMF was added and allowed to incubate for 30 min at 4 °C. The sample was extracted with an Oasis cartridge and analyzed by liquid chromatography (LC)/electrospray ionization (ESI)/MS/MS in the positive ion mode as described (4Brame C.J. Salomon R.G. Morrow J.D. Roberts L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13139-13146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The auxiliary gas pressure was 10 p.s.i., and the sheath gas pressure was 70 p.s.i. The voltage on the capillary was 20 V, and the tube lens voltage was 80 V. The capillary temperature was 200 °C. Collision-induced dissociation (CID) of molecular ions of putative NK-lysyl adducts was performed from −20 eV to −40 eV with 2.6-millitorr collision gas, scanning daughter ions between 50 and 550. Synaptosomes were prepared from brain of Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats according to the method of Janowsky et al. (32Janowsky A. Neve K. Eshleman A.J. Current Protocols in Neurosciences. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1998Google Scholar). Lipid peroxidation was initiated by the addition of an iron/ADP/ascorbate mixture as described above. Incubations were carried out at 37 °C for 4 h, and the samples were then placed at −80 °C to terminate the reactions. Following oxidation, 1 volume of 0.4 nKOH (containing 3 mm Trolox) was added for base hydrolysis, and the mixture was incubated under argon for 2 h at 37 °C. After neutralization of the sample with 5 n HCl, 10 volumes of cold ethanol (containing 5 mg of butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and 50 mg of triphenylphosphine (TPP)/100 ml) were added, and the proteins were precipitated by centrifugation at 2000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min. Proteins were then reprecipitated in 10 volumes of cold Folch solution and washed with 10 volumes of MeOH (each containing BHT and TPP). Proteins were resuspended in 1× phosphate-buffered saline and heated to 98 °C for 5 min. After cooling, Pronase (3 mg/mg of starting protein weight) was added, and the mixture was incubated overnight at 37 °C. Samples were then heated at 98 °C for 5 min to inactivate the Pronase, and after cooling, aminopeptidase M (1 µl/mg starting protein weight) was added, and the digest was incubated at 37 °C for 18 h. The digest was extracted with an Oasis cartridge as described above and purified by HPLC using a 4.6 × 250 mm Macrosphere 300 C18 column. The solvent system employed was a gradient consisting of 20 mm ammonium acetate with 0.1% acetic acid (solvent A) to 5 mm ammonium acetate/MeOH/acetic acid (10:90:0.1, v/v/v) (solvent B). The flow rate was 1 ml/min beginning at 100% A, followed by an increase to 40% B over 5 min and then to 100% B over 14 min. The column was then washed with 100% B for 10 more min. HPLC fractions containing radioactivity from NK-lysyl adduct internal standards were combined, reextracted with Oasis cartridges, and analyzed by LC/ESI/MS/MS as described above. Internal standards were formed by oxidation of 25 mg of DHA in the presence of [13C6]lysine (2 mg) and [3H]lysine (50 × 106 cpm). Adducts were extracted with Oasis cartridge and HPLC as described above. Fractions were collected every min, and aliquots containing radioactivity were analyzed by LC/ESI/MS/MS. HPLC fractions containing NK-lysyl adducts were combined, and the concentration was calculated from the specific activity of the [3H]lysine. Human cerebral cortices were ground in cold Folch solution (containing BHT and TPP). Proteins were precipitated and resuspended in 3 ml of cold MeOH (containing BHT and TPP) and 3 ml of 0.4 n KOH (containing Trolox) for the base hydrolysis. Proteins were then precipitated, washed, and subjected to complete enzymatic digestion to individual amino acids. Adducts were then extracted by Oasis cartridge and HPLC (using the same solvents as above and a flow rate of 1 ml/min beginning at 100% A followed by an increase to 40% B over 14 min and then to 100% B over 16 min) and analyzed by LC/ESI/MS/MS as described above. Previously, we have shown that oxidation of arachidonic acid (AA) in vitro results in the formation of IsoKs (4Brame C.J. Salomon R.G. Morrow J.D. Roberts L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13139-13146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Thus, we initially explored whether NKs are also formed in vitro during oxidation of DHA with iron/ADP/ascorbate. A representative selected current chromatogram obtained from this analysis is shown in Fig. 2. The two peaks in the lower m/z 528 chromatogram represent the syn- and anti-O-methyloxime isomers of the internal standard [2H4]PGE2. The predicted M-⋅CH2C6F5 ion for the pentafluorobenzyl ester, O-methyloxime, trimethylsilyl ether derivative NKs is m/z 505. In the upper ion current chromatogram are a series of m/z 505 peaks eluting at a longer retention time compared with PGE2. These peaks would be consistent with NKs, which would be expected to have a longer GC retention time than PGE2because of their two additional carbon atoms. Additional analyses further supported the identity of these compounds as NKs. No peaks were seen in the m/z 504 ion current chromatogram, indicating that the peaks in them/z 505 chromatogram are not natural isotope peaks of compounds generating an ion of less thanm/z 505. Analysis of the putative NKs as a [3H9] trimethylsilyl ether derivative resulted in a shift in the 505 peaks eluting after the arrowin Fig. 2 upwards to m/z 514, indicating the presence of one hydroxyl group. When analyzed as a [2H3]-O-methyloxime derivative, the m/z 505 peaks eluting after the arrow shifted upwards 6 Da to m/z 511, indicating the presence of two carbonyl groups (data not shown). Analysis following catalytic hydrogenation is shown in Fig. 3. Prior to catalytic hydrogenation, there were no peaks present 8 Da abovem/z 505 at m/z 513. However, following hydrogenation, intense new peaks appear atm/z 513 with a concomitant loss of the peaks in the m/z 505 ion current chromatogram. This indicated that the compounds contained four double bonds. Collectively, these data indicate that the compounds represented by the chromatographic peaks eluting after, but not before, the arrow in them/z 505 ion current chromatogram have the type and number of functional groups and double bonds predicted for NKs. We then compared the relative amounts of NKs and F4-NPs formed during oxidation of DHA. The amounts of NKs formed are less than the amounts of F4-NPs (Fig.4 A). Interestingly, however, the amount of NKs generated exceeded the amount of IsoKs formed during co-oxidation of equal molar amounts of DHA and AA with iron/ADP/ascorbate by 3.1-fold (Fig. 4 B). We previously demonstrated that IsoKs covalently adduct to lysine residues with remarkable rapidity (within seconds) (4Brame C.J. Salomon R.G. Morrow J.D. Roberts L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13139-13146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). IsoKs initially form an unstable reversible Schiff base adduct, which then proceeds through a pyrrole to stable lactam and hydroxylactam adducts2 (4Brame C.J. Salomon R.G. Morrow J.D. Roberts L.J. J.

To determine whether NKs form covalent adducts with lysine in vitro, DHA was oxidized with iron/ADP/ascorbate in the presence of lysine. Adducts were then analyzed, after reduction by sodium borohydride, by LC/ESI/MS. Selected ion current chromatograms monitoring m/z 491 and 503 from these analyses are shown in Fig. 6. The predicted [MH]+ ion for the dehydrated reduced Schiff base NK lysine adduct is m/z 491. This is consistent with our previous observation that IsoKs not only undergo reduction during treatment with the sodium borohydride but also dehydration (7Boutaud O. Brame C.J. Salomon R.G. Roberts L.J. Oates J.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9389-9396Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The predicted [MH]+ ions for the NK lysine lactam adducts ism/z 503. The presence of multiple m/z 491 and 503 peaks is consistent with the formation of multiple NK-lysyl adduct isomers, as would be predicted (see Fig. 1).Figure 6LC/ESI/MS analysis of NK-lysyl adducts formed during oxidation of DHA in the presence of lysine. Shown are the selected ion current chromatograms of the [MH]+ ionsm/z 491 for the dehydrated reduced Schiff base adducts (A) and m/z 503 for the lactam adducts (B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To further substantiate the structural identity of these compounds as Schiff base and lactam adducts, the compounds were analyzed by LC/ESI/MS/MS. CID of the putative dehydrated reduced Schiff base adducts produced daughter ions at m/z 473 and 346 (Fig. 7 A). CID of the putative NK-lysyl lactam adducts produced relevant daughter ions atm/z 485, m/z 467,m/z 356, m/z 338, andm/z 84 (Fig. 7 B). The ions atm/z 473 in the Schiff base CID spectrum and the ions at m/z 485 and m/z 467 in the lactam CID spectrum represent the loss of one molecule of H2O (m/z 473, 485) and two molecules of H2O (m/z 467). Other daughter ions present in these CID spectra can be assigned the structures shown in Fig. 8 based on analogous ions present in the CID spectra of IsoK-lysyl adducts (4Brame C.J. Salomon R.G.

Synaptosomes (composed of sealed off neuronal and glial processes) are a widely used model for the study of central nervous system gray matter metabolism (33Blakely R.D. Ory-Lavollee L. Thompson R.C. Coyle J.T. J. Neurochem. 1986; 47: 1013-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We compared the formation of NK-lactam adducts in nonoxidized synaptosomes and in synaptosomes following oxidation for 4 h with iron/ADP/ascorbate. NK-lysyl lactam adducts were isolated and after complete enzymatic digestion of proteins to individual amino acids and quantified following base hydrolysis. Adducts were analyzed by LC/ESI/MS/MS utilizing selected reaction monitoring of the transition of the [MH]+ ions for the synaptosomal lactam adducts (m/z 503) and NK [13C6]lysine lactam internal standards (m/z 509) to the specific respective CID ionsm/z 84 and 89. The internal standards were obtained by oxidation of DHA in the presence of [13C6]lysine and [3H]lysine. The lactam adducts were detected in nonoxidized synaptosomes at a level of 0.09 ng/mg of protein (Fig.9 A), and levels increased 19-fold to 1.71 ng/mg of protein following oxidation (Fig.9 B). The pattern of peaks representing synaptosomal lactam adducts differs somewhat from the pattern obtained for the internal standard. This can be explained by our previous observation that there appears to be a steric influence of phospholipids on the formation of different isomers from esterified substrate. The pattern of peaks representing lactam adducts in nonoxidized synaptosomes also differs somewhat from the patterns detected in oxidized synaptosomes. This is due to variation in absolute recovery of the NK adduct isomers in the pooled HPLC fractions collected due to the large number of isomers that elute over a broad range, as was also seen for peaks representing the internal standards. We then sought to determine whether NK-lactam protein adducts are present in detectable quantities in vivo in human brains obtained from individuals who had no known neurological disease at the time of death. Proteins from frozen human cerebral cortex were precipitated, delipidated, and treated with or without base hydrolysis before complete proteolysis. Levels of NK-lysyl lactam adducts in the cerebral cortex were 9.9 ± 3.7 ng/g of brain tissue (n = 4) (Fig. 10). The amount of adducts detected was not different from the levels measured when proteins had not been subjected to base hydrolysis, indicating that NK-lactam adducts were not esterified to phospholipids This is consistent with our observation that IsoK-lactam protein adducts are not associated with phospholipids.2 These studies have identified a novel class of IsoK-like compounds that are formed by free radical-induced peroxidation of DHA bothin vitro and in vivo. Our motivation for exploring whether IsoK-like compounds are formed via the NP pathway stems from the fact that DHA is uniquely enriched in neural and retinal tissues; DHA comprises about one-third and 30–65% of total fatty acids in aminophospholipids of gray matter and rod outer segments, respectively (8Anderson B.E.

The brain is especially sensitive to oxidative injury because of its high content of polyunsaturated fatty acids, its high oxygen consumption rate, and its relative paucity of antioxidant defenses compared with other tissues (37Floyd R.A. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1999; 222: 236-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). In this regard, NPs and IsoPs are readily detectable in normal brain tissue, suggesting a level of ongoing oxidant stress in the brain (17Roberts L.J. Montine T.J. Markesbery W.R. Tapper A.R.

It was of interest to find that NK-lysyl protein adducts are also readily detectable in normal brain tissue, suggesting that proteins are being covalently modified by NKs even in the normal state. At present, it is not known if NPs exert biological activity. However, because of their capacity to covalently modify proteins, adduction of key proteins by NKs may be highly injurious to neurons. This may take on particular relevance in pathologic disorders involving oxidant injury. This notion is supported by our previous findings that levels of NPs and/or IsoPs are significantly increased, indicative of enhanced oxidant injury, in both Huntington's disease and Alzheimer's disease (38Montine T.J.

Reactive aldehydes derived from lipid peroxidation have been suggested to play a key role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative processes. The reactive aldehydes most intensively studied have been 4-HNE and 4-hydroxy-2-hexenal, formed from oxidation of AA and DHA, respectively, and malondialdehyde (6Esterbauer H. Schaur R.J. Zollner H.

Neurochem. 1999; 72: 2323-2333Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Although 4-HNE is considered to be one of the most cytotoxic reactive aldehydes formed from lipid peroxidation (6Esterbauer H. Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1991; 11: 81-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (5902) Google Scholar), it is of interest and particular relevance that we previously showed that IsoKs adduct to lysine residues at a rate that exceeds that of 4-HNE by several orders of magnitude (4Brame C.J. Salomon R.G. Morrow J.D. Roberts L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13139-13146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Relevant to the hypothesis that NKs could be important effector molecules in the pathobiology of oxidative neuronal injury are the data obtained from the 2,5-hexanedione, the reactive metabolite that is responsible for the neurotoxicity ofn-hexane. 2,5-Hexanedione is a γ-diketone that reacts with the ε-amine group of lysine with reaction chemistry similar to that of NKs. γ-Diketone neuropathy is characterized by cross-linking of neurofilaments, via the formation of pyrrole adducts, leading to axonal atrophy and swelling (50Graham D.G. Amarnath V. Valentine W.M. Pyle S.J. Anthony D.C. Crit. Rev. Toxicol. 1995; 25: 91-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 51Lehning E.J. Jortner B.S. Fox J.H. Arezzo J.C. Kitano T. LoPachin R.M. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2000; 165: 127-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Thus, the neurotoxic effects of NKs would be expected to be similar to that of 2,5-hexanedione. It is interesting to note that the amounts of NKs generated during co-oxidation of equivalent amounts of DHA and AA in vitrowere greater than the amounts of IsoKs formed. This is consistent with the fact that DHA is more susceptible than AA to oxidation (52Dratz E.A. Deese A.J. Simopoulos A.P. Kifer R.R. Martin R.E. Health Effects of Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids in Seafoods. Academic Press, Inc., Orlando, FL1986: 319-351Crossref Google Scholar). This is also in accord with the findings that (a) NP levels are higher than levels of IsoPs in normal human brain, (b) levels of NPs are increased in brain from patients with Alzheimer's disease, whereas IsoPs are not, and (c) levels of NPs are higher than levels of IsoPs in cerebrospinal fluid from both control subjects and patients with Alzheimer's disease (17Roberts L.J. Montine T.J. Markesbery W.R. Tapper A.R. Hardy P. Chemtob S. Dettbarn W.D. Morrow J.D. J. Biol.

Pathol. 2001; 158: 293-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Collectively, this suggests that NKs formed by the NP pathway may play a more prominent role as neurotoxins in settings of oxidant injury to the brain than IsoKs formed by the IsoP. In summary, these studies have elucidated the formation of highly reactive γ-ketoaldehydes NKs as products of the NP pathway of free radical-induced peroxidation of DHA, both in vitro andin vivo. This identifies a new class of molecules that may be involved in the formation of protein adducts and protein cross-links in neurodegenerative diseases, a common feature of these disorders, and contribute to the injurious effects of other oxidative pathologies in the brain.

NCCG-gp41 features an exposed trimeric coiled-coil comprising the N-terminal helices of the gp41 ectodomain. The trimeric coiled-coil is stabilized both by fusion to a minimal thermostable ectodomain of gp41 and by engineered intersubunit disulfide bonds. NCCG-gp41 is shown to inhibit HIV envelope-mediated cell fusion at nanomolar concentrations with an IC50 of 16.1 ± 2.8 nm. It is proposed that NCCG-gp41 targets the exposed C-terminal region of the gp41 ectodomain in its pre-hairpin intermediate state, thereby preventing the formation of the fusogenic form of the gp41 ectodomain, which comprises a highly stable trimer of hairpins arranged in a six-helix bundle. NCCG-gp41 has potential as a therapeutic agent for the direct inhibition of HIV cell entry, as an anti-HIV vaccine, and as a component of a rapid throughput assay for screening for small molecule inhibitors of HIV envelope-mediated cell fusion.

Martin M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23883-23886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). HIV-I Env consists of two non-covalently attached proteins, gp120 and gp41, derived by proteolytic cleavage of gp160 (1Freed E.O. Martin M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23883-23886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The molecular events leading to fusion include initial binding of gp120 to CD4, triggering conformational changes in gp120 that permit subsequent interactions with the chemokine receptors, CXCR4 or CCR5 (2Moore J.P. Trkola A. Dragic T. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 551-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). This results in a further series of conformational changes in the gp120/gp41 oligomer that lead to insertion of the fusion peptide of gp41 into the target membrane and ultimately membrane fusion. Both gp120 and gp41 offer potential targets for the inhibition of viral entry through either drugs or neutralizing antibodies. Neutralizing antibodies directed at gp120 have been difficult to elicit (3McMichael A.J. Hanke T. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 612-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), because the surface of gp120 is heavily glycosylated (4Kwong P.D. Wyatt R. Robinson J. Sweet R.W. Sodroski J. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1998; 393: 648-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (2530) Google Scholar), thereby preventing access to the conserved regions of the molecule that bind the requisite receptors. One very potent inhibitor of fusion directed against gp120 has been discovered, namely, the small protein cyanovirin-N (5Boyd M.R. Gustafson K.R. McMahon J.B. Shoemaker R.H. O'Keefe B.R. Mori T.

The core of gp41 is a trimer of hairpins making up a six-helix bundle; three N-terminal helices form a central parallel coiled-coil around which are packed the C-terminal helices in an antiparallel manner. This structure is thought to represent the fusogenic state of gp41, which serves to bring the viral and cell membranes into close proximity, thereby promoting membrane fusion (7Chan D.C. Kim P.S. Cell. 1998; 93: 681-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar). It has long been known that peptides derived from the C- and N-helices inhibit fusion (13Wild C.T. Oas T.

The activity of the N-peptides, on the other hand, is about three orders of magnitude lower (13Wild C.T. Oas T. McDanal C.B. Bolognesi D. Matthews T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Blacklow S.C. Kim P.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 1075-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). Both the N- and C-peptides are thought to target the pre-hairpin fusion intermediate, which persists for many minutes (7Chan D.C. Kim P.S.

Formation of the pre-hairpin intermediate in which the N-terminal fusion peptide of gp41 is inserted into the target membrane is postulated to expose the trimeric coiled-coil of N-helices to which the C-peptides bind with high affinity, thereby preventing formation of the fusogenic trimer of hairpins (7Chan D.C. Kim P.S. Cell. 1998; 93: 681-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar, 18Furuta R.A. Wild C.T. Weng Y. Weiss C.D. Nat. Struct.

Virol. 1998; 72: 9676-9682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or bind to the C-terminal region of the gp41 ectodomain corresponding to the C-helix in the fusogenic state of gp41 (7Chan D.C. Kim P.S. Cell. 1998; 93: 681-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar). The N-helix of gp41 has also been targeted by cyclic D-peptide inhibitors derived from phage display (20Eckert D.M. Malashkevich V.N. Hong L.H. Carr P.A. Kim P.S. Cell. 1999; 99: 103-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar) and a variety of non-natural binding elements generated by combinatorial chemistry and linked to truncated C-peptides (21Ferrer M. Kapoor T.M. Strassmaier T. Weissenhorn W. Skehel J.J. Oprian D. Schreiber S.L. Wiley D.C. Harrison S.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 953-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar); to date the reported inhibitory activities of these compounds are only in the micromolar range. In this paper we present the design of a chimeric gp41 molecule, which we term NCCG-gp41 (see Fig. 1), in which the N-helix of HIV gp41 is grafted in helical phase onto the N terminus of a minimal thermostable trimeric core (six-helix bundle) of gp41 and stabilized by intermolecular disulfide bridges. We show that NCCG-gp41 presents a stable and exposed trimeric coiled-coil of N-helices that inhibits fusion at nanomolar concentrations. In addition to its fusion inhibitory properties, NCCG-gp41 has been designed with the aim of presenting an epitope suitable for the generation of fusion inhibitory antibodies directed against the exposed N-helices of gp41 in the pre-hairpin intermediate state. The DNA encoding the N-gp41 chimeric protein was synthesized (Life Technologies, Inc.) in approximately four equal fragments as shown in Fig. 2. The nucleotide sequence was biased for optimal codon usage in Escherichia coli(www.kazusa.or.jp/codon/). These fragments were assembled in a manner similar to that described previously (22Louis J.M. Wondrak E.M. Copeland T.D. Smith C.A.D. Mora P.T. Oroszlan S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1989; 159: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and the full-length fragment was cloned into the pET11a vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) for expression in E. coli BL21(DE3). The L31C, Q32C, and A33G mutations were introduced into the N-gp41 construct using the Quick-Change mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to create the NCCG-gp41 construct. Cells were grown at 37 °C either in Luria-Bertani medium or in a modified minimal medium for uniform (>99%) 15N labeling with 15NH4Cl as the sole nitrogen source and induced with 2 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside for 4 h. Cells derived from 1 liter of culture expressing NCCG-gp41 were suspended in 20 volumes of Buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, 10 mm EDTA, and 10 mm dithiothreitol) and lysed by sonication at 4 °C in the presence of 100 µg/ml lysozyme. The insoluble fraction was washed by resuspension in Buffer A containing 1m urea and 0.5% Triton X-100 and then in Buffer A. In both cases, the insoluble fraction was pelleted by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The final pellet was solubilized in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 7.5 mguanidine-HCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 20 mmdithiothreitol to yield a concentration not exceeding 20 mg/ml. 30 mg of protein was applied at ambient temperature and a flow-rate of 3 ml/min to a Superdex-75 column (HiLoad, 2.6 × 60-cm; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 4m guanidine-HCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 5 mm dithiothreitol. Peak fractions were then subjected to reverse-phase HPLC on POROS RII resin (Perceptive Biosystems) using a linear gradient of 0 to 60% acetonitrile/0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. Peak fractions were combined, and 7 mg of protein was diluted to a concentration of ∼0.2 mg/ml in 35% acetonitrile/water/0.05% trifluoroacetic acid and dialyzed against 2 liters of 50 mm sodium formate buffer, pH 3.0, for 3 h and then against 2 liters of the same buffer overnight at 4 °C. The protein was concentrated to ∼3 mg/ml and stored at 4 °C. A CD spectrum of NCCG-gp41 was recorded at 25 °C on a JASCO J-720 spectropolarimeter using a 0.05-cm path length cell. Quantitative evaluation of secondary structure from the CD spectrum was carried out using the program k2d (available at www.bioinformatik.biochemtech.uni-halle.de/), which employs a neural network approach for CD spectra deconvolution (23Andrade M.A. Chacon P. Merelo J.J. Moran F. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar). A1H–15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence correlation spectrum of uniformly 15N-labeled NCCG-gp41 was recorded at 40 °C at 600 MHz on a Bruker DRX600 NMR spectrometer. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were conducted at 20.0 °C and three different rotor speeds (10,000, 12,000, and 14,000) on a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge. Protein samples were prepared in 50 mmsodium formate buffer, pH = 3, and loaded into the ultracentrifuge cells at nominal loading concentrations of 0.80A 280. Data were analyzed in terms of a single ideal solute to obtain the buoyant molecular mass, M(1 −vρ), using the Optima XL-A data analysis software (Beckman). The value for the experimental molecular mass, M, was determined using calculated values for the density, ρ (determined at 20 °C using standard tables), and partial specific volume,v (calculated on the basis of amino acid composition; see Ref. 24Perkins S.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 157: 169-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). NIH-3T3 and B-SC-1 cells (American Type Culture Collection) grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and gentamycin at 50 µg/ml (all from Life Technologies, Inc.), were used for all assays. Recombinant vaccinia viruses used in this study include vCB41 (25Broder C.C. Berger E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9004-9008Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), vCBYF1-fusin (26Feng Y. Broder C.C. Kennedy P.E. Berger E.A. Science. 1996; 272: 872-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (3643) Google Scholar), vP11T7gene1 (27Alexander W.A. Moss B. Fuerst T.T. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 2934-2942Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and vCB21R-LacZ, which encode HIV-I LAV (Lai) Env (T-cell line tropic), CXCR4, bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase driven by a vaccinia virus promoter, and the E. coli lacZ gene under control of the T7 promoter, respectively. Two-domain-soluble CD4 (1) was a gift from E. Berger (National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health) and donated by S. Johnson (Pharmacia Upjohn, Kalamazoo, MI). N36 (residues 546–581 of HIV-I Env) and C34 (residues 628–661 of HIV-I Env) peptides, acetylated at their N termini and amidated at their C termini, were synthesized by solid-phase peptide synthesis (Commonwealth Biotechnologies, Richmond, VA), purified by reverse phase HPLC, and characterized by mass spectrometry. A modification (28Salzwedel K. Smith E. Dey B. Berger E.J. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 326-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) of the vaccinia virus-based reporter gene assay employing soluble CD4 (200 nm final concentration) was used to determine the effect on HIV Env-mediated cell fusion of NCCG-gp41 and C34 and N36 peptides. Assays were conducted essentially as described (28Salzwedel K. Smith E. Dey B. Berger E.J. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 326-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Briefly, NIH-3T3 and B-SC-1 cells were used for target and effector cell populations, respectively. Target cells were co-infected with vCB21R-LacZ and vCBYF1-fusin (CXCR4) and effector cells with vCB41 (Env) and vP11T7gene1 at a multiplicity of infection of 10. For inhibition studies, NCCG-gp41, C34, or N36 were added to an appropriate volume of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2.5% fetal bovine serum and PBS to yield identical buffer compositions (100 µl), followed by addition of 1 × 105 effector cells (in 50 µl of medium) per well. After incubation for 15 min, 1 × 105 target cells (in 50 µl) and soluble CD4 were added to each well. Following 2.5 h of incubation, β-galactosidase activity of cell lysates was measured (A 570; Molecular Devices 96-well spectrophotometer) upon addition of chlorophenol red-β-d-galactopyranoside (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). At least two independent experiments (performed in duplicate) were conducted for each inhibitor. The curves for % fusionversus inhibitor concentration, [I], were fit by non-linear optimization to the activity relationship, %fusion = 100/(1 + [I]/IC50). The structure of NCCG-gp41 was modeled and regularized using the National Institutes of Health version (available by anonymous ftp at portal.niddk.nih.gov in the directory /pub/clore/xplor_nih) of the program XPLOR (29Brünger A.T. X-PLOR: A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1993Google Scholar) and visualized using the program VMD-XPLOR (30Schwieters C.D. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 2001; 149: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The minimal trimeric core of the ectodomain of HIV gp41, N34-(L6)-C28, which has been solved crystallographically (11Tan K.J. Liu J. Wang S. Shen S. Lu M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12303-12308Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar), comprises residues 546–579 (N34) and 628–655 (C28) of HIV-I Env covalently linked by a six-residue SGGRGG loop (L6) (Fig. 1 a). The structure forms a thermostable trimer of hairpins in which N34 and C28 are entirely helical and arranged in a six-helix bundle (top half of Fig. 1 b). We have made use of the N34-(L6)-C28 core as a scaffold to graft a 35-residue sequence (N35) comprising residues 546–580 of HIV-I Env onto its N terminus, taking care that the helical register is continuously maintained from N35 through N34 (Fig. 1 a). The rationale for this design is that a fully accessible trimeric coiled-coil of N35 helices will be stabilized as a consequence of its being covalently linked to the gp41 ectodomain core (Fig. 1 b). To further stabilize the trimeric coiled-coil of N35 helices, and to ensure that the entire molecule remains trimeric at very low concentrations, we substituted the sequence Leu-Gln-Ala located at the C-terminal end of N35 (residues 31–33 of the construct) to Cys-Cys-Gly (Fig. 1, a and b). This approach was used previously in an attempt to stabilize the gp160 envelope protein (31Farzan M. Choe H. Desjardins E. Sun Y. Kuhn J. Cao J. Archambault D. Kolchinski P. Koch M. Wyatt R. Sodroski J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 7620-7625Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The location of the two cysteines on the helix face (at positions d and e, respectively) is such that three intermolecular disulfide bonds can readily be formed between the three subunits (A, B, and C), Cys31(A)-Cys32(B), Cys31(B)-Cys32(C), and Cys31(C)-Cys32(A) (Fig. 1, c and d). The A33G mutation was employed to ensure that minor adjustments of the polypeptide backbone can readily occur to ensure disulfide bond formation. The proposed structure for the chimeric protein, which we term NCCG-gp41, is shown in Fig. 1 b. The model was constructed from the x-ray structure of N34-(L6)-C28 (11Tan K.J. Liu J. Wang S. Shen S. Lu M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12303-12308Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar) and the internal trimeric coiled-coil of N-helices from the x-ray structure of a longer ectodomain fragment of gp41 (comprising residues 541–588 and 628–665 of HIV-I Env) (10Weissenhorn W. Dessen A. Harrison S.C. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 426-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1470) Google Scholar). N35 was grafted onto N34 by best-fitting the backbone of residues 581–586 (i.e. five residues C-terminal of N35) of the longer HIV gp41 ectodomain onto the backbone of residues 546–551 (i.e. the first five residues) of the N34-(L6)-C28 construct, followed by deletion of residues 581–586; substitution of Leu576, Leu577, and Ala578 in N35 by Cys, Cys, and Gly, respectively; and regularization to covalently link the N35 and N34 helices of each subunit and form intermolecular disulfide bonds with good stereochemistry. N35 (residues 1–35 of NCCG-gp41) and N34 (residues 36–69 of NCCG-gp41) form a continuous 69 residue α-helix, ∼100-Å-long. The internal trimeric coiled-coil of N34 helices is surrounded by three C-terminal helices (C28 corresponding to residues 76–103 of NCCG-gp41), whereas the trimeric coiled-coil of N35 helices, ∼50-Å in length, is fully exposed to solvent. The strategy employed for synthesizing the genes for N-gp41 and NCCG-gp41 is shown in Fig.2. The N-gp41 coding sequence and its complementary sequence were synthesized in approximately four equal fragments, which were ligated to yield full-length N-gp41 DNA and then cloned into the pET11a expression vector. The following two critical features of the nucleotide sequence are noteworthy: first, codon usage was optimized for E. coli; second, within these confines, non-identical codon usage was employed for the N35 and N34 portions of the gene. Hence, although the amino acid sequences of residues 1–34 and 36–69 of N-gp41 are identical (Fig. 1 a), the corresponding nucleotide sequences are different (Fig. 2). This is important, because it allows one to mutagenize at will residues within N35 without affecting N34. The L31C, Q32C, and A33G mutations in N35 were then introduced into the N-gp41 coding sequence to generate the NCCG-gp41 construct. Folded NCCG-gp41 is fully soluble at low pH values (less than 4) and elutes as a single peak on size-exclusion chromatography (Fig.3 a). Quantitative analysis of elution profiles down a Superdex-75 column as described (32Yang F. Bewley C.A. Louis J.M. Gustafson K.R. Boyd M.R. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Wlodawer A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 403-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) indicates that NCCG-gp41 elutes with an apparent molecular mass of 30,000 Da corresponding to a trimer (which has a calculated molecular mass of 35,442 Da). No evidence of dimer or monomer was apparent at the lowest concentration of about 140 nm tested on the Superdex-75 column. The trimeric nature of NCCG-gp41 was confirmed by sedimentation equilibrium studies, which indicated that NCCG-gp41 behaves as a single monodisperse species with a molecular mass of 35,600 ± 150 Da. NCCG-gp41 was specifically designed with the aim of generating a protein in which the subunits of the trimer are covalently linked by three intermolecular disulfide bonds, located at the C-terminal end of the N35 portion of the construct (Fig. 1,b–d), thereby ensuring that dissociation into monomers cannot occur. This is indeed found to be the case experimentally. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of refolded NCCG-gp41 demonstrates that under non-reducing conditions the majority (∼90%) of the protein migrates as a trimer with about 10% as a dimer (see Fig. 2 a, lane 2). This result is consistent with mass spectroscopic analyses of non-reduced NCCG-gp41, which shows the presence of trimer and minor dimer forms with experimental masses ofm/z 35,442 and 23,629, respectively. These values are essentially identical to the expected values of 35441.7 and 23627.8 for the trimer and dimer, respectively. When the disulfide bonds are reduced, however, by the addition of 2-mercaptoethanol, all the NCCG-gp41 migrates as a monomer as expected (see Fig.2 a, lane 3). The CD spectrum of NCCG-gp41 (Fig. 3 b) displays the characteristic signature of an α-helical protein with double minima at 208 and 222 nm. Deconvolution of the CD spectrum with the neural network program k2d (23Andrade M.A. Chacon P. Merelo J.J. Moran F. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar) yields an α-helical content of 96%, in complete agreement with the model in Fig.1 b in which the only non-helical residues are located in the six-residue loop connecting the N34 and C28 helices. The CD results are also completely consistent with the 1H–15N correlation (heteronuclear single quantum coherence) NMR spectrum of NCCG-gp41 (data not shown), which is reminiscent of that of the complete ectodomain of simian immunodeficiency virus gp41 (33Caffrey M. Cai M. Kaufman J. Stahl S.J. Wingfield P.T. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 819-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and displays rather limited dispersion of the backbone amide proton resonances (9.3–6.5 ppm), as expected for a predominantly helical protein. A quantitative vaccinia-virus-based reporter gene assay (28Salzwedel K. Smith E. Dey B. Berger E.J. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 326-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) was used to assess the ability of NCCG-gp41 to inhibit HIV-I Env-mediated cell fusion. In this assay, the extent of HIV-I Env-mediated cell fusion upon addition of soluble CD4 between effector cells bearing HIV-I Env (LAV) on their surface and target cells expressing the chemokine receptor CXCR4 is directly monitored via rates of β-galactosidase activity. Fusion activity as a function of NCCG-gp41 concentration is shown in Fig. 4 where it can be clearly seen that NCCG-gp41 inhibits HIV-I Env-mediated cell fusion at nanomolar concentrations with an IC50 of 16.1 ± 2.8 nm. For comparison we also carried out a set of parallel experiments with the C34 and N36 peptides (15Lu M. Blacklow S.C. Kim P.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 1075-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar) derived from the N- and C-terminal helices of gp41. (C34 comprises residues 628–661 of HIV-I Env and corresponds to the C28 portion of NCCG-gp41 plus an additional six residues at its C terminus; N36 comprises residues 546–581 of HIV-I Env and corresponds to the N35 portion of NCCG-gp41 plus an additional residue at its C terminus;cf. Fig. 1 a.) The C34 peptide has an IC50 of 2.2 ± 0.5 nm, in agreement with previous studies (16Chan D.C. Chutkowski C.T. Kim P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15613-15617Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 21Ferrer M. Kapoor T.M. Strassmaier T. Weissenhorn W. Skehel J.J. Oprian D. Schreiber S.L. Wiley D.C. Harrison S.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 953-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). For comparison, DP-178, the original C-peptide shown to have fusion inhibitory activity (14Wild C.T. Shugars D.C. Greenwell T.K. McDanal C.B. Matthews T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9770-9774Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar) and comprising residues 638–673 of HIV-I Env, which overlaps with the C-terminal half of the C34 peptide, has an IC50 of ∼50 nm(21Ferrer M. Kapoor T.M. Strassmaier T. Weissenhorn W. Skehel J.J. Oprian D. Schreiber S.L. Wiley D.C. Harrison S.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 953-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The fusion inhibitory activity of the N36 peptide, however, is much lower, in the micromolar range with an IC50 of 16.4 ± 1.8 µm, also consistent with previous work (13Wild C.T. Oas T. McDanal C.B. Bolognesi D. Matthews T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10537-10541Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). NCCG-gp41 is three orders of magnitude more potent than the N36 peptide in inhibiting HIV-I Env-mediated fusion (Fig. 4). This must be due to the fact that the N36 peptide aggregates and does not form a trimeric coiled-coil in the absence of C34 peptide (15Lu M. Blacklow S.C. Kim P.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 1075-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). In contrast, the exposed N35 portion of NCCG-gp41 is maintained in the trimeric helical coiled-coil conformation as a consequence of its being directly linked to the stable trimeric, six-helix core of gp41 and further stabilized by the presence of three intersubunit disulfide bonds (Fig. 1 b). Note that the trimeric six-helix core of gp41 possesses no inhibitory activity (34, so that the activity of NCCG-gp41 is entirely due to the presence of the exposed trimeric helical coiled-coil formed by the N35 portion of the molecule. Because the N35 portion of NCCG-gp41 forms a stable, covalently linked, trimeric coiled-coil that is entirely helical, NCCG-gp41 must target the accessible C-terminal region of the gp41 ectodomain in its pre-hairpin intermediate state. Thus, whereas the C-terminal region of the gp41 ectodomain forms an outer helical shell that interacts with the internal trimeric coiled-coil of N-helices to form a six-helix bundle in the fusogenic state solved by NMR (8Caffrey M.

A. 1998; 95: 9134-9139Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), in the pre-hairpin intermediate state, the N- and C-terminal regions of the gp41 ectodomain cannot be interacting with each other, consistent with current models (7Chan D.C. Kim P.S. Cell. 1998; 93: 681-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar,34Root M.J. Kay M.S. Kim P.S. Science. 2001; 291: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). We also carried out a series of experiments in which fully inhibitory concentrations of NCCG-gp41, C34, or N36, in the presence or absence of CD4, were added to effector cells, followed by repeated washing prior to adding the effector cells to target cells in the presence of soluble CD4. Under these conditions, cell fusion is observed in all three cases, suggesting that all three molecules act on a fusion intermediate of gp41 generated subsequent to the interaction of HIV-I envelope with cellular receptors, in agreement with previous studies on peptides derived from the C-helix of gp41 (18Furuta R.A. Wild C.T. Weng Y. Weiss C.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). In this paper we have presented the design and biophysical characterization of a chimeric protein, NCCG-gp41, in which the solvent-exposed trimeric N-helix coiled-coil of gp41 is stabilized by directly attaching it to a thermostable core fragment of gp41 comprising a trimer of hairpins (six-helix bundle) and covalently linking the subunits by engineering intermolecular disulfide bridges. We also demonstrated that NCCG-gp41 is a highly potent inhibitor of HIV-I Env-mediated cell fusion at nanomolar concentrations with an IC50 of ∼16 nm. While this work was in progress, Kim and colleagues (34Root M.J. Kay M.S. Kim P.S. Science. 2001; 291: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar) described the properties of an engineered protein, which they termed 5-helix and which comprises a single 200-residue polypeptide chain (N36-L6-C34-L6-N36-L6-C34-L6-N36, where L6 is a six residue linker) in which the N36 segments form a parallel triple helix coiled-coil at the center of the molecule, surrounded by two antiparallel (C34) helices, thereby leaving one N36 helix exposed to solvent. The inhibitory activity of 5-helix is comparable with that of NCCG-gp41, and it is likely that both function in a very similar manner. Both NCCG-gp41 and 5-helix could potentially be used as therapeutic agents (either parenteral or possibly as a topical microbicide), in a manner analogous to peptides derived from the C-helix of gp41 (14Wild C.T. Shugars D.C. Greenwell T.K. McDanal C.B. Matthews T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9770-9774Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar, 16Chan D.C. Chutkowski C.T. Kim P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15613-15617Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar) that are currently undergoing clinical trials (17Kilby J.M. Hopkins S. Venetta T.M. DiMassimo B. Cloud G.A. Lee J.Y. Alldredge L. Hunter E. Lambert D. Bolognesi D. Matthews T. Johnson M.R. Nowak M.A. Shaw G.M. Saag M.S. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1302-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). NCCG-gp41 offers a number of unique advantages in this regard. NCCG-gp41 is covalently linked by intersubunit disulfide bridges between the exposed N-helices and is about twice the size of 5-helix. In principle, these features should render NCCG-gp41 immune from the effects of potential proteolytic cleavage at the linkers between the N- and C-helices and increase its lifetime by reducing its degradation rate in the liver and clearance by the kidneys. Note that cleavage of the linkers in 5-helix will eventually result in repartitioning of the N- and C-helices to yield a significant proportion of inactive six-helix bundle. Moreover, at very low concentrations dissociation of the N- and C-helices could occur; cleavage of the linkers in NCCG-gp41, on the other hand, may lead to dissociation of the C-helices at very low concentrations, but the trimeric coiled-coil of N-helices will still be preserved because of the presence of the intersubunit disulfide bonds. In addition, NCCG-gp41 exposes the complete internal trimeric N-helix coiled-coil of gp41 in a stable manner. This feature, together with the larger size of NCCG-gp41, should be advantageous with respect to the possible use of NCCG-gp41 as an anti-HIV vaccine. We anticipate that immunization with NCCG-gp41 will generate antibodies directed against the internal trimeric N-helix coiled-coil of gp41, which is exposed in the pre-hairpin intermediate state. We predict that such antibodies will function in a manner analogous to the highly inhibitory peptides derived from the C-helix of gp41. This hypothesis is currently being tested in our laboratory. Finally, one can also anticipate that NCCG-gp41, in combination with the C34 or C28 peptide, could be used for high throughput screening for small molecule inhibitors that bind to the exposed trimeric N-helix coiled-coil of NCCG-gp41, thereby inhibiting HIV Env-mediated cell fusion.

https://openalex.org/W2021021541,"Various pathogenic bacteria such asShigella deliver effector proteins into mammalian cells via the type III secretion system. The delivered Shigellaeffectors have been shown to variously affect host functions required for efficient bacterial internalization into the cells. In the present study, we investigated the IpaH proteins for their ability to be secreted via the type III secretion system and their fate in mammalian cells. Upon incubation in a medium containing Congo red, the bacteria secrete IpaH into the medium, but secretion of IpaH occurs later than that of IpaBCD. Immunofluorescence microscopy indicated that IpaH9.8 is secreted from intracellular bacteria and transported into the nucleus. On microinjection of the protein, intracellular IpaH9.8 is accumulated at one place around the nucleus and transported into the nucleus. This movement seems to be dependent on the microtubule network, since nuclear accumulation of IpaH9.8 is inhibited in cells treated with microtubule-destabilizing agents. In nuclear import assay, IpaH9.8 was efficiently transported into the nucleus, which was completely blocked by treatment with wheat germ agglutinin. The nuclear transport of IpaH9.8 does not depend on host cytosolic factors but is partially dependent on ATP/GTP, suggesting that, like β-catenin, IpaH9.8 secreted from intracellularShigella can be transported into the nucleus."

The long 5′-untranslated region (2.7 kilobases) is characterized by a high content of GC in its 3′-end. The first TATA box was located at −2672/−2668. Multiple transcription start sites and a high density of putative binding sites for Sp1 (GC and CACCC boxes), AP-1/-2/-4, cAMP-responsive element-binding protein, GATA, GR, and STAT transcription factors were found within the 5′-flanking region. Transcriptional activity of the promoter was assessed using pGL3-luciferase deletion mutants in twoMUC4-expressing (CAPAN-1 and CAPAN-2) and one nonexpressing (PANC-1) pancreatic cancer cell line. Two highly active fragments (−219/−1 and −2781/−2572) that drive MUC4 transcription in CAPAN-1 and CAPAN-2 cells were identified. Gel retardation assays indicated that Sp1 and Sp3 bind to cognate cis-elements found in the 5′-flanking region and that Sp1 transactivates, whereas Sp3 inhibits the GC-rich region (−464/−1) in CAPAN-2 cells. Activation of protein kinase C with phorbol ester and treatment of cells with epidermal growth factor and transforming growth factor-α resulted in up-regulation of the promoter. Tumor necrosis factor-α and interferon (IFN)-γ inflammatory cytokines had no or mild effect on MUC4 transcriptional activity when used alone. However, a very strong synergistic effect (10–12-fold activation) between IFN-γ and tumor necrosis factor-α or IFN-γ and transforming growth factor-α was obtained in CAPAN-2 cells. Altogether these results demonstrate that the 5′-flanking region ofMUC4 contains epithelial cell-specific, positive, and negative regulatory cis-elements, that Sp1/Sp3 are important regulators of MUC4 basal expression, and that its regulation in pancreatic cancer cells involves complex interplay between several signaling pathways. The human mucin geneMUC4 encodes a large transmembrane mucin that is thought to play important roles in tumor cell biology and that is overexpressed in human pancreatic carcinomas. In this report, we describe the structure and functional activity of the 5′-flanking region, including 1.0 kilobase of the promoter. The long 5′-untranslated region (2.7 kilobases) is characterized by a high content of GC in its 3′-end. The first TATA box was located at −2672/−2668.

Spicer A.P. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 607-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar, 2Porchet N. Buisine M.-P. Desseyn J.-L. Moniaux N. Nollet S. Degand P. Pigny P. Van Seuningen I. Laine A. Aubert J.-P. J. Soc. Biol. 1999; 193: 85-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The common structural feature among all mucins is the presence of tandemly repeated amino acid regions that serve as a docking site forO-glycans (1Gendler S.J. Spicer A.P. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 607-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). Mucins are now classified in two main categories: secreted mucins including gel-forming (MUC2,MUC5AC, MUC5B, and MUC6) and non-gel-forming (MUC7) and membrane-bound mucins (2Porchet N. Buisine M.-P. Desseyn J.-L. Moniaux N. Nollet S. Degand P. Pigny P. Van Seuningen I. Laine A. Aubert J.-P. J. Soc. Biol. 1999; 193: 85-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This last group includes MUC1, MUC3, MUC4, and MUC12 (3Williams S.J. McGuckin M.A. Gotely D.C. Eyre H.J. Sutherland G.R. Antalis T.M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4083-4089PubMed Google Scholar). Human MUC4 has been extensively studied in our laboratory. Its first partial cDNA was isolated from a human tracheobronchial library (4Porchet N. Nguyen V.C. Dufossé J. Audié J.-P. Guyonnet-Dupérat V. Gross M.-S. Denis C. Degand P. Bernheim A. Aubert J.-P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 175: 414-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), and the gene was located on chromosome 3q29 (5Gross M.-S. Guyonnet-Dupérat V. Porchet N. Bernheim A. Aubert J.-P. Nguyen V.C. Ann. Génét. 1992; 35: 21-26PubMed Google Scholar). Recently its complete genomic organization has been established. The 5′-region of the gene is characterized by a single exon (exon 2) made of a 48-bp1 minimal unit repeated in tandem that encodes a large Ser/Thr-rich domain (6Nollet S. Moniaux N. Maury J. Petitprez D. Degand P. Laine A. Porchet N. Aubert J.-P. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 739-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The tandem repeat varies in size between 7 and 19 kb because of a variable number of tandem repeat polymorphism. The 3′-end region of MUC4 mainly consists of two EGF-like domains, a transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic tail (7Moniaux N. Nollet S. Porchet N. Degand P. Laine A. Aubert J.-P. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 325-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) and shows extensive alternative splicing downstream of the tandem repeat that generates a family of putative secreted and membrane-associated MUC4 isoforms (8Moniaux N. Escande F. Batra S.K. Porchet N. Laine A. Aubert J.-P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4536-4544Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The human MUC4 displays extensive similarities in the Nt and Ct regions with the rat sialomucin complex (SMC) previously isolated from mammary adenocarcinoma ascites cells (9Hull S.R. Sheng Z. Vanderpuye O. David C. Carraway K.L. Biochem. J. 1990; 265: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). SMC is a heterodimer glycoprotein composed of an O-glycosylated mucin subunit ASGP-1 tightly bound to a N-glycosylated transmembrane subunit ASGP-2 (10Carraway K.L. Price-Schiavi S.A. Komatsu M. Idris N. Perez A. Li P. Jepson S. Zhu X. Carjaval M.E. Carothers-Caraway C.A. Front. Biosci. 2000; 5: 95-107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, ASGP-2 contains two EGF-like domains in its extracellular part, one of which acts as a ligand for ErbB2/Neu oncogene (11Carraway III, K.L. Rossi E.A. Komatsu M. Price-Schiavi S.A.

The whole SMC molecule is transcribed from a single gene as a 9-kb mRNA, which is translated into a single polypeptide that is secondary cleaved to yield the heterodimer complex ASGP-1/ASGP-2 (12Sheng Z.Q. Hull S.R. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8505-8510Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the same way, MUC4 may also be cleaved in two subunits: the mucin subunit MUC4α and a transmembrane subunit with two EGF-like domains MUC4β (7Moniaux N. Nollet S. Porchet N. Degand P. Laine A. Aubert J.-P. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 325-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). MUC4 is therefore considered to be the human homologue of rat SMC. In situ hybridization studies have shown thatMUC4 is expressed in numerous normal tissues such as trachea, lung, stomach, colon, uterus, and prostate (13Audié J.-P. Janin A. Porchet N. Copin M.-C.

Audié J.-P. Porchet N. Real F.X. Gastroenterology. 1995; 109: 953-964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), gall bladder, liver, biliary epithelial cells, or intrahepatic bile ducts (18Vandenhaute B. Buisine M.-P. Debailleul V. Clément B. Moniaux N. Dieu M.-C. Degand P. Porchet N. Aubert J.-P. J. Hepatol. 1997; 27: 1057-1066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Interestingly, abnormal expression ofMUC4 was demonstrated to occur in several human epithelial cancers such as lung and pancreas carcinomas (17Balagué C. Audié J.-P. Porchet N. Real F.X. Gastroenterology. 1995; 109: 953-964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 19Lesuffleur T. Zweibaum A. Real F.-X. Crit. Rev. Oncol.

Tumor Biol. 1996; 17: 176-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Furthermore high levels of MUC4 mRNAs have been found in several differentiated pancreatic tumor cell lines (21Balagué C. Gambus G. Porchet N. Carrato C. Aubert J.-P. Kim Y.-S. Real F.-X. Gastroenterology. 1994; 106: 1054-1061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 22Hollingsworth M.A. Strawhecker J.M. Caffrey T.C. Mack D.R. Int. J.

(Tokyo). 2000; 128: 233-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The dysregulation of MUC4 expression, often dramatic, together with the homology to SMC/rMuc4, which is considered to promote tumor cell metastasis (24Komatsu M. Tatum L. Altman N.H. Carothers-Carraway C.A. Carraway K.L. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 87: 480-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), points out an important role for MUC4in human tumor biology, especially in pancreatic tumors. Knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying the dysregulation ofMUC4 observed in pancreatic cancer is thus necessary to understand the role and contribution of MUC4 altered expression during carcinogenesis. However, very few data concerning the factors involved in the control of MUC4 expression have been published so far. Gollub et al. (25Gollub E. Waksman H. Goswami S. Marom Z. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 217: 1006-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) have shown that estrogen and dexamethasone up-regulate MUC4 mRNA levels in the endometrial Ishikawa epithelial cell line. In bronchial cells, Bernacki et al. (26Bernacki S.H. Nelson A.L. Abdullah L. Sheehan J.K. Harris A. Davis W. Randell S.H. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1999; 20: 595-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) showed that MUC4 is regulated at the transcriptional level by retinoic acid. More recently, Choudhury et al. (27Choudhury A. Singh R.K. Moniaux N. El-Metwally T.H. Aubert J.-P. Batra S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33929-33936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that all-trans-retinoic acid induces MUC4 expression in CD18/HPAF pancreatic carcinoma cells and is mediated by TGF-β2. Recently, the 5′-flanking region as well as 2.4 kb of the promoter of the rat Muc4 was described (10Carraway K.L. Price-Schiavi S.A. Komatsu M. Idris N. Perez A. Li P. Jepson S. Zhu X. Carjaval M.E. Carothers-Caraway C.A. Front. Biosci. 2000; 5: 95-107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Price-Schiavi S.A. Perez A. Barco R. Carraway K.L. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 641-649Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The promoter is TATA-less and is characterized by the presence of an initiator consensus sequence located 27 bp upstream of the unique transcription start site. The cell-specific activity of the promoter is thought to be under the control of cis-elements present upstream from the initiator (28Price-Schiavi S.A. Perez A. Barco R. Carraway K.L. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 641-649Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The purpose of our study was to isolate and characterize the promoter of the human mucin gene MUC4 and identifycis-elements as well as define the molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of its expression in pancreas cancer cells. To this end, three human well differentiated pancreatic duct cancer cell lines CAPAN-1 (MUC4 positive), CAPAN-2 (MUC4positive), and PANC-1 (MUC4 negative) were chosen (21Balagué C. Gambus G.

We have identified regulatory cis-elements andtrans-acting factors involved in the control ofMUC4 expression. Moreover, this study shows thatMUC4 promoter regulation is complex and involves many signaling pathways that may be responsible for the overexpression ofMUC4 expression in carcinoma of the pancreas and hepatobiliary system. Inserts were prepared using the restriction map of a cosmid clone called LEA 51 (6), which covers the 5′-proximal region of MUC4. Gel-purified fragments (Qiaquick gel extraction kit, Qiagen) were subcloned into the promoterless pGL3 Basic vector (Promega). Internal deletion mutants were generated by PCR using pairs of primers bearing specific restriction sites at their 5′- and 3′-ends (Table I). PCR products were digested, gel-purified, and subcloned into the pGL3 vector that had been previously cut with the same restriction enzymes. Fragments 1488 (1.43 kb, KpnI-SacI) and 1489 (1.32 kb,KpnI-SacI) were generated using the restriction sites present within the LEA 51 genomic clone. Fragment 1744 was generated using the Genome walker kit (CLONTECH). The EcoRV 650-bp PCR fragment was first subcloned into pCR 2.1 vector (Invitrogen) before being subcloned into pGL3 basic vector. All clones were sequenced on both strands on an automatic LI-COR sequencer (ScienceTec, France) using infrared labeled RV3 and GL2 primers (Promega). Plasmids used for transfection studies were prepared using the Endofree plasmid Mega kit (Qiagen).Table IOligonucleotides used in PCRpGL3 deletion mutantPosition of the DNA fragmentOrientationOligonucleotide used for PCR (5′ → 3′)1919−144 /−1SCGCACG CGTCTT CCC AGG TTC CCT GGCASCGCACG CGTGGC TGC GGC AAA AGT CCC1809−219 /−1SCGCACG CGTTTC CTG GTG GGG TAG TGGASCGCACG CGTGGC TGC GGC AAA AGT CCC1555−461 /−1SCGCGAG CTCGTA CAG CCC CAA GGT CGCASCGCACG CGTGGC TGC GGC AAA AGT CCC2038−899 /−1SCGCACG CGTCTG GGG TCT GCCASCGCGAG CTCCTG GGG TCT GCC2150−1187 /−1SCGCGAG CTCAAC TGG GGT GAG CAG AGCASCGCGAG CTCGGC TGC GGC AAA AGT CCC1641−3135 /−2572SCGCGAG CTCCTG TCT CTT CAA GCC AAGASCGCACG CGTCCC TGA AGG GAG ACA CAA1959−2781 /−2572SCGCGAG CTCATA TTG AGG GGA GCT GGAASCGCACG CGTCCC TGA AGG GAG ACA CAA2095−3135 /−2614SCGCGAG CTCCTG TCT CTT CAA GCC AAGASCGCGAG CTCGGA GTC CGG AAG TGA ATT1718−3135 /−2837SCGCGAG CTCCTG TCT CTT CAA GCC AAGASCGCACG CGTTCA TCT GGG TTG GGT CAC1744−3713 /−3059SCGCGGT ACCACT ATA GGG CAC GCG TGGASCGCAGA TCTAGT GTG GAT GTG GGG TGTSequences of the pairs of oligonucleotides used in PCR to produce deletion mutants covering MUC4 5′-flanking region (see Fig.5).

Pancreatic cancer cell lines CAPAN-1 and CAPAN-2 were purchased from American Type Culture Collection, and PANC-1 cells were from European Collection of Cell Cultures. CAPAN-1 and CAPAN-2 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2 mm glutamine and 15 and 10% fetal calf serum (Roche Diagnostics), respectively. PANC-1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mmglutamine and 10% fetal calf serum. The cells were maintained in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2. Total RNAs from pancreatic cancer cells were prepared using the RNeasy® midi-kit from Qiagen. The cells were harvested at confluence, and 1.5 µg of total RNA was used to prepare cDNA (AdvantageTM RT-for-PCR kit,CLONTECH). PCR was then performed on 5 µl of cDNA as described by Van Seuningen et al. (32Van Seuningen I. Perrais M. Pigny P. Porchet N. Aubert J.-P. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 675-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) using specific pairs of primers for MUC4 mucin gene (MUC4 forward primer, 5′-CGCGGTGGTGGAGGCGTTCTT-3′;MUC4 reverse primer, 5′-GAAGAATCCTGACAGCCTTCA-3′; positions 3094–3114 and 3670–3690; accession number AJ242549) (7Moniaux N.

Single-stranded oligonucleotides were synthesized by MWG-Biotech. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used as an internal control. PCR reactions and PCR product analyses were carried out as described previously (32Van Seuningen I. Perrais M. Pigny P. Porchet N. Aubert J.-P. Biochem.

Annealing and labeling of the primers and extension reactions were performed as described previously (32Van Seuningen I. Perrais M. Pigny P. Porchet N. Aubert J.-P. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 675-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The reverse primer NAU 979 (5′-CCTGTTGTGGAGGACACCTGTG-3′) is located downstream of the TATA box, and the reverse primer NAU 1035 (5′-CAGCAGCTGCAGTGTGAGGAG-3′) is located in the 3′-end of the 5′-UTR. φX174 DNA/HinfI dephosphorylated markers (Promega) were radiolabeled with [γ-32P]dATP just before use. Manual sequencing of M13mp18 control DNA was performed using the T7 Sequenase version 2.0 kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The samples were denatured for 10 min at 90 °C before loading on a 8% sequencing gel (Sequagel-8; National Diagnostic, Prolabo, France). The gel was then vacuum-dried and autoradiographed for 3–4 days at −80 °C. The transfections were performed using Effectene® reagent (Qiagen) as described previously (33Perrais M. Pigny P. Buisine M.-P. Porchet N. Aubert J.-P. Van Seuningen-Lempire I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15386-15396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were passed at 0.5 × 106 cells/well the day before the transfection. Total cell extracts were prepared after 48 h of incubation at 37 °C using 1× reagent lysis buffer (Promega) as described in the manufacturer's instruction manual. The results were corrected for transfection efficiency by co-transfecting 0.1 µg of pSV-βGal vector (Promega). β-Galactosidase and luciferase activities were measured as described by Perrais et al. (33Perrais M. Pigny P. Buisine M.-P. Porchet N. Aubert J.-P. Van Seuningen-Lempire I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15386-15396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The luciferase activity is expressed as fold of induction of the test plasmid activity compared with that of the corresponding control vector (pGL3 control vector, Promega) after correction for transfection efficiency by dividing by β-galactosidase activity. Each plasmid was assayed in triplicate in at least three separate experiments. Co-transfection studies with pCMV-Sp1 and pCMV-Sp3 expression vectors were performed as described previously (32Van Seuningen I. Perrais M. Pigny P. Porchet N. Aubert J.-P. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 675-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). PMA (100 nm, 24 h), cholera toxin (1 µg/ml, 24 h), and calcium ionophore A23187 (250 nm, 30 min) were added to the transfected cells as indicated, and the cells were then harvested to measure luciferase activity. The cells were also treated with EGF (25 ng/ml, 24 h) and TGF-α (25 ng/ml, 24 h) growth factors and with TNF-α (40 ng/ml, 24 h) and IFN-γ (25 ng/ml, 24 h) inflammatory cytokines. All reagents were from Sigma unless otherwise indicated. In some experiments, the cells were pretreated for 30 min with tyrosine-kinase inhibitor tyrphostin AG 1478 (10 µm) (Calbiochem) before adding the growth factor of interest. Nuclear extracts from cell lines of interest were prepared as described by Van Seuningen et al. (34Van Seuningen I. Ostrowski J. Bustelo X.R. Sleath P. Bomsztyk K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26976-26985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and kept at −80 °C until use. Protein content (5 µl of cell extracts) was measured using the bicinchoninic acid method in 96-well plates as described in the manufacturer's instruction manual (Pierce). Nuclear proteins (5 µg) were preincubated for 20 min on ice in 20 µl of binding buffer with 2 µg of poly(dI-dC) (Sigma) and 1 µg of sonicated salmon sperm DNA. Radiolabeled DNA probe was added (120,000 cpm/reaction), and the reaction was left for another 20 min on ice. For supershift analyses, 1 µl of the antibody of interest (anti-Sp1 and anti-Sp3, Santa Cruz Laboratories, Tebu, France) was added to the proteins and left for 1 h on ice before adding the radiolabeled probe. The reaction was stopped by adding 2 µl of loading buffer and loaded onto a 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel, and electrophoresis conditions were as described by Van Seuningenet al. (32Van Seuningen I. Perrais M. Pigny P. Porchet N. Aubert J.-P. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 675-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The gels were vacuum-dried and autoradiographed overnight at −80 °C. DNA sequences were analyzed using PC-GENE software, and the Transfac 4.0 data base was used to localize putative transcription factor binding sites within the 5′-flanking region of MUC4. The search was conducted using MatInspector V2.2 software (35Quandt K. Frech K. Karas H. Wingender E. Werner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4878-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2421) Google Scholar). To isolate the promoter of the human mucin gene MUC4, a human genomic pWE15 library was screened with RAC3 probe (183 bp), which spans 106 bp of the 5′-UTR and 77 bp of the first exon of MUC4 (6Nollet S. Moniaux N. Maury J. Petitprez D. Degand P. Laine A. Porchet N. Aubert J.-P. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 739-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). One positive clone, called LEA 51, was isolated and contains an insert of 40 kb (Fig. 1). EcoRI digestion of the insert generated a 2.2-kb fragment that was sequenced and showed 100% homology in its 3′-end region with the previously published 5′-flanking cDNA sequence of MUC4 (6Nollet S. Moniaux N. Maury J. Petitprez D. Degand P. Laine A. Porchet N. Aubert J.-P. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 739-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To obtain more clones containing the promoter region, a PCR-based DNA walking technique was used. A 2.8-kb fragment was obtained from thePvuII library using the two primers NAU 376 and NAU 357 that are located in the 5′-end of the 5′-UTR of MUC4. The sequence of the 2.8-kb fragment perfectly aligned with the 3′-end of the cosmid clone LEA51, which indicated that we had most likely isolated the promoter of MUC4. A second round of PCR was then carried out using two primers (NAU 598 and NAU 599) located in the 5′-end of the 2.8-kb fragment. A 650-bp-long PCR product was isolated from the EcoRV library. The 3′-end of that fragment matched the 5′-end of the 2.8 kb. Altogether 3.7 kb of the MUC45′-flanking region upstream of the first ATG was isolated using this strategy. The sequence of the promoter and of the 5′-UTR is presented in Fig.2. The first typical TATA box (TATAA) was found at −2672/−2668 upstream of the translational start site. The 5′-UTR is mainly composed of GC-rich domains that are potential binding sites for Sp1 but also for the CACCC box-binding protein. This region is also characterized by numerous putative binding sites for transcription factors of the AP family (AP-1, AP-2, and AP-4), PEA3 transcription factor (Ets family), glucocorticoid receptor element, and two sites for the progesterone receptor. A very high density of binding sites for factors known to initiate transcription in TATA-less promoters (Sp1, CACCC box, glucocorticoid receptor element, AP-2, PEA3, and Med-1) (36Gumina R.J.

Finally, two putative STAT-binding sites, a transcription factor activated by IFN-γ (41Park C. Schindler C. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 15: 175-188Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar), were found in the 3′-end of the 5′-UTR. Upstream of the first TATA box, numerous putative binding sites for Sp1, glucocorticoid receptor element, AP-1, AP-4, GATA, and cAMP-responsive element-binding protein transcription factors were found. The expression of MUC4 in CAPAN-1 (lane 4) and CAPAN-2 (lane 5) and its absence in PANC-1 (lane 6) cells was confirmed by RT-PCR (Fig.3). One can note that MUC4expression is higher in CAPAN-1 (lane 4) cells compared with CAPAN-2 (lane 5). To localize transcription initiation sites, primer extension experiments were then carried out with total RNAs from the two cell lines expressing MUC4 (CAPAN-1 and CAP"
https://openalex.org/W2016925279,"We have studied the conformation of the peptide Ac-EPKRSVAFKKTKKEVKKVATPKK (CH-1), free in solution and bound to the DNA, by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. The peptide belongs to the COOH-terminal domain of histone H10 (residues 99–121) and is adjacent to the central globular domain of the protein. In aqueous (D2O) solution the amide I′ is dominated by component bands at 1643 cm−1and 1662 cm−1, which have been assigned to random coil conformations and turns, respectively. In accordance with previous NMR results, the latter component has been interpreted as arising in turn-like conformations in rapid equilibrium with unfolded states. The peptide becomes fully structured either in 90% trifluoroethanol (TFE) solution or upon interaction with the DNA. In these conditions, the contributions of turn (1662 cm−1) and random coil components virtually disappear. In TFE, the spectrum is dominated by the α-helical component (1654 cm−1). The band at 1662 cm−1 shifts to 1670 cm−1, and has been assigned to the COOH-terminal TPKK motif in a more stable turn conformation. A band at 1637 cm−1, also present in TFE, has been assigned to 310 helical structure. The amide I′ band of the complexes with the DNA retains the components that were attributed to 310 helix and the TPKK turn. In the complexes with the DNA, the α-helical component observed in TFE splits into two components at 1657 cm−1 and 1647 cm−1. Both components are inside the spectral region of α-helical structures. Our results support the presence of inducible helical and turn elements, both sharing the character of DNA-binding motifs."

An additional three members of the Clk family were isolated from mouse and human and were also shown to be dual specificity kinases (16Nayler O. Stamm S. Ullrich A. Biochem.

Farkas R. Lee K. Rabinow L. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1160-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar,34Bender J. Fink G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12105-12109Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Any Clk homologues have not been found in yeast, although KNS1 is derived from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and belongs to the LAMMER kinase family, including Clks (35Lee K. Du C. Horn M. Rabinow L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27299-27303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In mammals, only partial clones of putative prp4 homologues have been reported. The first cDNA sequence of hPRP4, human homologue of prp4, was reported by Käufer and their colleagues (5Gross T. Lutzelberger M. Weigmann H. Klingenhoff A. Shenoy S. Käufer N.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1028-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The reported hPRP4 cDNA, cloned from HeLa cDNA library, encoded a 55-kDa kinase consisting of 496 amino acids and had an ATG codon with the adequate context of Kozak consensus (36Kozak M. Mamm. Genome. 1996; 7: 563-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar), although any in-frame stop codons were not found in the upstream sequence. 2N. F. Käufer, personal communication. More recently, mouse prp4 homologue (herein called mPRP4) was captured with a gene trap approach (37Tate P. Lee M. Tweedie S. Skarnes W.C. Bickmore W.A. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2575-2585PubMed Google Scholar). The mPRP4 predicted from the cloned cDNA had the longer NH2-terminal sequence, which possesses basic and RS motifs. However, ATG codon was not found at the NH2-terminal end of the mPRP4. Many kinases are reported to be able to phosphorylate SR proteins as described above. However, it remains to be elucidated how SR protein kinases interact with each other. Here we report the cloning and the characterization of full-length hPRP4 cDNA encoding 170-kDa polypeptide. hPRP4 colocalizes with SR proteins in the subnuclear structures, termed speckles. One of the SR protein kinases, Clk1, interacts with hPRP4 COOH terminus, and phosphorylates the NH2-terminal region of hPRP4. Furthermore, cotransfection analysis showed that subnuclear localization of hPRP4 depends on the Clk1 kinase activity within the cells. These findings suggest that SR protein kinases regulate both SR proteins and themselvesin vivo. The monoclonal antibodies to the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag (12CA5, Roche Diagnostics), the Myc epitope tag (9E10, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), the FLAG epitope tag (M2, SIGMA), the His6 tag (Qiagen) and the rabbit polyclonal antibodies to the HA tag (MBL) were purchased from the indicated supplier. The rabbit polyclonal antiserum to hPRP4 was produced by immunizing rabbits with a synthetic peptide NH2-CDNLEDFDVEEEDEEALIEQR-COOH, including residues 522–541 of hPRP4, coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. The total RNA was isolated from confluent HeLa S3 cells on a 100-mm dish, using Isogen (Nippon Gene, Tokyo). Using the oligonucleotides 5′-TGGAGACATACCCTCTTTATC-3′ and 5′-ATCCTTGTCTTCTTCTGAGGAATG-3′ as gene-specific primers 1 and 2, respectively, 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) procedure was carried out according to the 5′-RACE system instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). The RT-PCR products were electrophoresed, subcloned into pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega), and sequenced with T7 promoter primer and M13 (−21) primer. Sequencing reaction and analysis were performed using DyeTerminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction (PE Applied Biosystems) and ABI Prism 310 genetic analyzer (PE Applied Biosystems), respectively. Based on the analyzed sequence, the oligonucleotides were newly synthesized for isolation of full-length clone of hPRP4. RT-PCR was performed using oligo(dT)12–18primer (Life Technologies, Inc.) for reverse transcription, and the oligonucleotides 5′-GTCGACATGGCCGCCGCGGAGACC-3′ and 5′-GCGGCCGCTTAAATTTTTTCCTGGATGAA-3′ for PCR. The amplified fragment was ligated into pGEM-T Easy vector, and the clone containing the appropriate insert was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The mutant cDNA, hPRP4 (K717R), was generated by substituting arginine for lysine at residue 717, by PCR-based method. The amplified fragment was ligated to pGEM-T Easy vector. The cDNA fragment corresponding to hPRP4ΔC (amino acids 1–497) or hPRP4ΔN (amino acids 498–1007) was amplified by PCR using primers containing SalI or NotI recognition site and ligated to pGEM-T Easy vector. All constructs made by PCR were verified by DNA sequencing. The hPRP4 cDNA and its mutants were subcloned into mammalian expression vector pME-HA (38Okajima T. Okuno S. Fujisawa H. Hagiwara M. Bioimages. 1996; 4: 117-128Google Scholar) betweenSalI and NotI sites. Mouse Clk1 cDNA was amplified by RT-PCR, followed by subcloning into pCRII vector (Invitrogen). The mutation in the ATP-binding site (K190R) was introduced using a PCR in vitro mutagenesis kit (TaKaRa) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Both pcDNA3FLAG-Clk1 and pcDNA3FLAG-Clk1 (K190R) were constructed by subcloning 1.4-kbXhoI fragment of the Clk1 and Clk1 (K190R) fragments into pcDNA3FLAG3 (gift from T. Fujino), respectively. The directions of the inserts were verified by sequencing. For expression of recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli, pET-hPRP4ΔN and pET-hPRP4ΔC were constructed by subcloning 1.5-kbSalI/NotI fragment of hPRP4ΔN and -ΔC into pET32b(+). Construction of pGEX-SF2 and pGEX-SF2ΔRS, the prokaryotic expression vectors of GST-fused SF2/ASF derivatives, has been described previously (19Koizumi J. Okamoto Y. Onogi H. Mayeda A. Krainer A.R. Hagiwara M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11125-11131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). For the Bac-to-Bac expression system (Life Technologies, Inc.), pFastBacHT-hPRP4 was constructed by subcloning 3-kb SalI/NotI fragment of hPRP4 cDNA into the SalI/NotI site of pFastBacHTc. GST-Clk1 and its derivative were expressed in E. coli (DH5α). The culture was induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at an absorbance of ∼0.8 at 600 nm and incubated for 16 h at 20 °C. The cells were harvested, resuspended in 20 ml of buffer A (100 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, 2 mm benzamidine, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and disrupted by sonication at 0 °C (Ultra Disruptor UD-201, Tomy). Triton X-100 was then added to 1% (v/v) final and rotated for 30 min at 4 °C. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 3 h or overnight at 4 °C. The resin was collected, washed three times with washing buffer (1% Triton X-100 in buffer A), and eluted with elution buffer (30 mm reduced glutathione, 100 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, 2 mm benzamidine). Elution was performed three times, and the fractions were collected and dialyzed twice in dialysis buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 8.0, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm DTT) overnight at 4 °C. His-tagged proteins HisTrx-hPRP4ΔC and HisTrx-hPRP4ΔN were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) using pET32-derived vectors and purified using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose chromatography (Qiagen) according to manufacturer's instructions. For preparation of His-tagged hPRP4 (His-hPRP4), hPRP4 is expressed using the Bac-to-Bac expression system (Life Technologies, Inc.). DH10Bac, the host strain of E. coli, was transformed with pFastBacHT-hPRP4, and the recombinant bacmid was prepared. Sf9 cells were transfected with the bacmid, and viral supernatant was collected. The baculovirus for protein preparation was used after amplification twice. Sf9 cells were infected, lysed at 3 days after infection, harvested, and resuspended in suspension buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole). The cell suspension was sonicated. After addition of Nonidet P-40 up to 1% final, the debris was removed by centrifugation and the supernatant was incubated with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose overnight at 4 °C. The resin was washed in washing buffer (20 mm imidazole, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl). The resin-bound proteins were eluted with elution buffer (400 mm imidazole, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl) and dialyzed twice in hPRP4 dialysis buffer (40 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 500 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, 10% glycerol). hPRP4 cDNA was amplified by PCR and labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using random-primer DNA labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The labeled probe was hybridized to human multiple tissue Northern blot I or II (CLONTECH) in ExpressHyb hybridization solution (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In situhybridization was carried out as described (39Yoshida K. Imaki J. Okamoto Y. Iwakabe H. Fujisawa H. Matsuda A. Nakanisi S. Matsuda H. Hagiwara M. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1998; 57: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Frozen sections (14 µm thick) were cut on a crystal and mounted onto poly-l-lysine-coated slides. Sections were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min and acetylated with 0.25% acetic anhydrate in 0.1 m triethanolamine. The sections were dehydrated in an ascending ethanol series and air-dried. The35S-labeled probes (3 × 106 cpm/ml) were dissolved in a buffer containing 50% formaldehyde, 10% dextran, 1× Denhardt's solution, 12 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 10 mmDTT. 150 µl of probe solution was applied to each slide at 65 °C for 16 h. Coverslips were then removed, and the slides were rinsed in 4× SSC and digested with RNase A (20 µg/ml) for 30 min in 0.1× SSC at 65 °C, before finally being dehydrated again. The sections were exposed to x-ray films (Eastman Kodak Co.) for 2 days, and the films were developed. To measure the kinase activity of immunoprecipitates, cells were transfected with HA-tagged expression vectors using LipofectAMINE and lysed at 24 h in the modified Net2 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl, 0.05% (w/v) Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EGTA, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mmNa3VO4(V)). Lysates were clarified at 15,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C and preabsorbed with protein G-Sepharose. Immunoprecipitations from cell lysates were carried out using monoclonal anti-HA antibody (12CA5) together with protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After incubation for 1 h at 4 °C, the complexes were washed three times with the lysis buffer and twice with kinase buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100). The kinase assays were initiated by the addition of 3 µg of the substrate and 100 µm [γ-32P]ATP, 10 mm MgCl2 in a final volume of 100 µl. The reactions were terminated after 30 min at 30 °C by addition of 6× Laemmli buffer. The reaction products were resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE and visualized by an imaging analyzer (Fujix, BAS2000). To measure the kinase activities of recombinant proteins, the kinase reactions containing 0.3 µg of substrate and the indicated amounts of kinase in a final volume of 25 µl were incubated for 20 min at 30 °C and terminated, resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, and detected as above. GST or GST fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose were incubated with the indicated His-tagged proteins or the lysate from COS-7 cells expressing HA-tagged proteins for 3 h or overnight at 4 °C. After extensively washed, glutathione-Sepharose precipitates were immunoblotted using mouse anti-His6 antibody or rabbit anti-HA antibody. 10% or 1% of the proteins used in binding reactions was loaded as a positive control (input). HeLa S3 cells or MCF-7 cells on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips were transfected with mammalian expression vectors and, after culture for 24 h, were washed in PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature, and washed three times in PBS. The fixed cells were permeabilized with the blocking solution (5% normal goat serum, 1.5% bovine serum albumin, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS) for 2 h at room temperature. The coverslips were incubated with appropriate primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. After washing three times in PBS, the coverslips were incubated with 1:50 dilution of goat anti-rabbit IgG fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) and 1:1000 dilution of Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) in blocking solution. The coverslips were washed three times in PBS, followed by Hoechst 33258 staining. The stained coverslips were washed three times in distilled water, rinsed in 70% ethanol and 100% ethanol, then dried and mounted with PermaFluor (Lipshaw Immunon). Primary antibodies and dilution used here were rabbit antiserum to hPRP4 (1:1000 dilution), 12CA5, mouse anti-HA monoclonal antibody (1:5000 dilution), rabbit anti-HA antibody (MBL) (1:500 dilution), mouse anti-SF2/ASF monoclonal antibody (AK103) (1:200 dilution), and mouse anti-SC35 monoclonal antibody (PharMingen) (1:500 dilution). The images were visualized by confocal microscopy (µ-Radiance, Bio-Rad). In vitro kinase assay was performed in the reaction containing recombinant His-hPRP4 in the absence or presence of 0.3 µg of recombinant GST-Clk1, as above. After separation of the reactions by SDS-PAGE, the bands corresponding to hPRP4 were excised and two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping was performed as described previously (18Okamoto Y. Onogi H. Honda R. Yasuda H. Wakabayashi T. Nimura Y. Hagiwara M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 872-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To isolate the full clone of hPRP4 from HeLa S3 cells, 5′-RACE was performed, and a 300-base pair major fragment was amplified. The sequence analysis of the 300-base pair fragment revealed that it contains the putative 5′ end of hPRP4 cDNA and a putative first ATG codon in the open reading frame of hPRP4 with an adequate context of Kozak consensus (5′-AAGATGG-3′) at the downstream of the GC-rich sequence (GenBankTM accession no. AY029347). Based on our upstream sequence data, an ∼3-kb fragment of hPRP4 cDNA was amplified by RT-PCR. The predicted open reading frame of hPRP4 consisting of 1007 amino acids was aligned with the prp4 homologues. Both hPRP4 and mPRP4 have basic amino acids repeat, which may function as a nuclear localization signal (NLS), and Arg-Ser/Ser-Arg (RS/SR) dipeptides at the NH2 terminus. Kinase domains I–XI were well conserved from yeast to human (Fig. 1A). As shown in Fig.1 B, the phylogenetic tree showed that hPRP4 and its homologues are structurally related to DYRK family and HIPK family. Although it is not clear that they share common biochemical features with hPRP4, at least some isoforms of DYRKs and HIPKs have been reported to localize in nucleus (40Becker W. Weber Y. Wetzel K.

A protein band of 170 kDa was immunoprecipitated and detected by immunoblotting with this antiserum (Fig. 1 C). The recombinant HA-hPRP4 protein expressed in COS-7 cells showed a molecular mass of 170 kDa on SDS-PAGE. To examine the expression pattern of hPRP4 mRNA in human tissues, we performed the Northern blot analysis using the full-length hPRP4 cDNA as a probe. The analysis revealed that the major transcript of ∼4.4 kb was widely expressed in human tissues, although the expression levels in lung and leukocytes seemed to be low (Fig.2A). To check the cell type-specific expression of hPRP4, we performed in situhybridization of mouse brain (Fig. 2 B). Sagittal section of a brain hybridized with antisense probe of hPRP4 revealed that the higher signals were detected in the cerebellum, the hippocampus, and the olfactory balb, suggesting the differential expression of hPRP4 or its homologue in neuronal cells.Figure 1Primary structure of hPRP4.

https://openalex.org/W2113882468,"The human 31-amino acid integral membrane protein sarcolipin (SLN), which regulates the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase in fast-twitch skeletal muscle, was chemically synthesized. Appropriate synthesis and purification strategies were used to achieve high purity and satisfactory yields of this hydrophobic and poorly soluble protein. Structural and functional properties of SLN were analyzed and compared with the homologous region of human phospholamban (PLB) comprising residues Ala24–Leu52 (PLB-(24–52)), the regulatory protein of the cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase. Circular dichroism spectroscopy showed that SLN is a predominantly α-helical protein and that the secondary structure is highly resistant to SDS and thermal denaturation. In this respect SLN is remarkably similar to PLB-(24–52). However, SLN is monomeric in SDS gels, whereas PLB-(24–52) shows a monomer-pentamer equilibrium typical for native PLB. Analytical ultracentrifugation experiments revealed that SLN oligomerizes in the presence of the nonionic detergents octylpolyoxyethylene and octyl glucoside in a concentration-dependent manner. No plateau was observed, and a pentameric state was only reached at much higher protein concentrations compared with PLB-(24–52). Chemical cross-linking showed that also in liposomes SLN has the ability to self-associate to oligomers. PLB-(24–52) specifically oligomerized to pentamers in the presence of octylpolyoxyethylene as well as in liposomes at low protein concentrations. In the presence of octylpolyoxyethylene pentamers were the main oligomeric species, whereas in liposomes monomers and dimers were predominant. Increasing the protein concentration led to self-association of PLB-(24–52) pentamers in the presence of octylpolyoxyethylene. Functional reconstitution of Ca-ATPase with PLB-(24–52) and SLN in liposomes showed that both proteins regulate the Ca-ATPase in a similar manner.

The transmembrane domain of the two proteins is highly conserved, but SLN lacks an extended cytoplasmic domain. Structural similarities between thesln and the plb gene, as well as the homology between the protein sequences of their products, led to the proposal that the two genes are members of a family (1Odermatt A. Taschner P.E. Scherer S.W. Beatty B. Khanna V.K. Cornblath D.R. Chaudhry V. Yee W.C. Schrank B. Karpati G. Breuning M.H. Knoers N. MacLennan D.H. Genomics. 1997; 45: 541-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The 52-residue protein PLB is located in the sarcoplasmic reticulum of cardiac and slow-twitch skeletal muscle (2Arkin I.T.

Rev. 1998; 78: 921-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). PLB is a critical regulator of the cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase (SERCA2a) and myocardial contractility (4Luo W. Chu G. Sato Y. Zhou Z. Kadambi V.J. Kranias E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4734-4739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Recently it has been shown for a mouse model of dilated cardiomyopathy that PLB is a key element in the progression of the disease (5Minamisawa S. Hoshijima M. Chu G. Ward C.A. Frank K. Gu Y. Martone M.E. Wang Y. Ross Jr., J. Kranias E.G. Giles W.R. Chien K.R. Cell. 1999; 99: 313-322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). PLB binds to and inhibits SERCA2a in its unphosphorylated form, and phosphorylation of PLB removes the inhibitory effect. PLB consists of a hydrophilic N-terminal domain, located in the cytosol, and a hydrophobic C-terminal domain traversing the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane. The latter has an α-helical conformation and is located within residues 26–52 (6Simmerman H.K. Lovelace D.E. Jones L.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 997: 322-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The transmembrane α-helical domain is responsible for protein oligomerization, and SDS-PAGE suggests that the oligomeric structure of PLB is a homopentamer (7Simmerman H.K. Collins J.H. Theibert J.L. Wegener A.D. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13333-13341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified PLB and the transmembrane domain PLB-(26–52) show conductance properties similar to channels, suggesting that PLB can form a pentameric pore structure in membranes (8Kovacs R.J. Nelson M.T. Simmerman H.K. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18364-18368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on mutagenesis data, Simmerman et al. (9Simmerman H.K. Kobayashi Y.M. Autry J.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5941-5946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) proposed a model for the PLB pentamer as a left-handed coiled coil stabilized by a leucine-isoleucine zipper. Although other models for the PLB pentamer were presented (10Adams P.D. Arkin I.T. Engelman D.M. Brunger A.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 154-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) the leucine-isoleucine zipper model was supported by investigation of the cysteine reactivity of PLB and its mutants (11Karim C.B. Stamm J.D. Karim J. Jones L.R. Thomas D.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12074-12081Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and by infrared spectroscopic analysis of PLB and molecular modeling (12Torres J. Adams P.D. Arkin I.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 677-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The 31-amino acid proteolipid SLN is located in the sarcoplasmic reticulum of fast-twitch skeletal muscle (13Wawrzynow A. Theibert J.L. Murphy C. Jona I. Martonosi A. Collins J.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 620-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The muscle-specific expression of SLN is complementary to PLB expression, mimicking the expression pattern of SERCA1 (1Odermatt A. Taschner P.E. Scherer S.W. Beatty B. Khanna V.K. Cornblath D.R. Chaudhry V. Yee W.C. Schrank B. Karpati G. Breuning M.H. Knoers N. MacLennan D.H. Genomics. 1997; 45: 541-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). SLN has been described to be a regulator of SERCA1, as PLB regulates SERCA2a, and it has been shown that SLN has a dual effect on Ca2+ transport activity. It decreases the apparent affinity of Ca-ATPase for Ca2+, like PLB, and thus inhibits Ca2+ uptake at low Ca2+concentrations. In addition and, in contrast to most reports on PLB, it enhances Ca-ATPase activity by increasing V maxat high Ca2+ concentrations (14Odermatt A. Becker S. Khanna V.K. Kurzydlowski K. Leisner E. Pette D. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12360-12369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In contrast to PLB, no structural data are available about the SLN protein. In order to get high amounts as well as a high purity of SLN, we chemically synthesized the full-length protein. Modifications to standard protocols were required for synthesis and purification of this extremely insoluble intrinsic membrane protein. We then analyzed the structural and functional properties of human SLN and compared it with the homologous region of human PLB comprising residues Ala24–Leu52, PLB-(24–52), which we also have synthesized. The secondary structure of SLN was found to be very similar to the one of PLB-(24–52). Both proteins are predominantly α-helical, and their secondary structures showed resistance to SDS denaturation and to thermal perturbation. However, the oligomeric state of both proteins proved to be different. PLB-(24–52) forms pentamers in 1%n-octylpolyoxyethylene (octyl-POE) and in 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) liposomes, and these oligomers are stable to SDS denaturation. SLN shows a tendency to self-association in 1% octyl-POE and in 1.5%n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (OG), and also in POPC liposomes it forms oligomers. However, pentamers are not specifically formed, and the oligomers are not SDS-stable. Both synthetic proteins regulate the Ca-ATPase in a similar manner. Part of the data was published previously in abstract form (15Pegoraro S. Hellstern S. Lustig A. Engel J. Moroder L. Fields G.B. Tam J.P. Barany G. Proceedings of the 16th American Peptide Symposium. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands2000Google Scholar). Synthesis of human PLB-(24–52) was performed as described (16Frank S. Kammerer R.A. Hellstern S. Pegoraro S. Stetefeld J. Lustig A. Moroder L. Engel J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6825-6831Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Synthesis of human SLN was performed on solid support using Fmoc/t-Bu chemistry on an ABI 431A fully automated synthesizer (Applied Biosystems Inc., Forster City, CA). The C-terminal amino acid was loaded onto a TentaGel S PHB resin (Rapp Polymers, Tübingen, Germany) using 4-dimethylaminopyridine-catalyzed esterification with preformed Fmoc-Tyr(t-Bu)-OH symmetrical anhydride. Loading was 0.2 mmol/g resin as determined spectrophotometrically. Double coupling procedures with a total of 8-fold Fmoc-amino acid excess in the presence of 2-(1H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate/1-hydroxybenzotriazole/N-ethyl-N,N-diisopropylamine (1:1:2 equivalents) in NMP/dimethylformamide/CHCl3(1:1:1, v/v) were used. Fmoc deprotection was performed in two steps of 4 and 12 min, with 2% piperidine, 2% 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-en in NMP/CHCl3 (1:1, v/v). All the washing steps were performed with NMP/dimethylformamide/CHCl3 (2:1:2, v/v). The final protein was cleaved from the resin and deprotected with a mixture of trifluoroacetic acid/water/thioanisole/ethanedithiol (90:5.5:3:1.5, v/v). The slurry was shaken for 100 min at room temperature and then filtered. The crude product was precipitated with methyltert-butyl ether, filtered, and dried (0.31 g). Preparative HPLC was performed with UV monitoring at 210 nm using C8 columns (220 × 12.5 mm; Machery & Nagel, Dürren, Germany) with 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid (eluent A) and CH3CN/2-propanol (1:1, eluent B) at flow rates of 8 ml/min. The crude product was divided into 50-mg fractions, dissolved in trifluoroacetic acid, and quickly injected into the preparative HPLC. The protein was eluted with a step gradient starting with a 2-min isocratic elution of 40% B followed by an 18-min gradient from 40% B to 60% B and finally from 60% B to 80% B in 42 min. The fractions from 41 to 47 min were collected, pooled, and lyophilized. A further purification step of the lyophilized product was performed, using the same gradient as before. Fractions from 42 to 45.5 min were collected and lyophilized; yield, 7 mg of pure product (16%).

Fluorescence spectra were recorded on a Jasco FP-777 spectrofluorometer with 2-mm quartz cuvettes thermostated at 20 °C. The excitation wavelength was set to 280 or 295 nm. The excitation slit width was 1.5 nm, and the emission slit width was 3 nm. The background intensity of the buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl) including detergent or lipid vesicles was subtracted from the protein fluorescence spectra. An Aviv 62DS circular dichroism spectropolarimeter was used with thermostated 1-mm quartz cuvettes. Each spectrum was the average of four scans and was corrected for the buffer contribution including detergent or lipid vesicles. Buffers used were 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5. A Beckman model XLA analytical ultracentrifuge was employed. Sedimentation velocity runs were performed in 12-mm double sector cells at 56,000 rpm at 20 °C. Sedimentation equilibrium runs were performed using the same cells also at 20 °C but at a filling height of 3 mm only; in case of OG, the filling height was 1.5–2.5 mm as described (17Lustig A. Engel A. Tsiotis G. Landau E.M. Baschong W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1464: 199-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The wavelength and the double sector cell thickness were varied according to the protein concentration used. The molecular masses were calculated from sedimentation equilibrium runs using a floating base-line computer program that adjusts the base-line absorbance to obtain the best linear fit of lnA versus r 2(A is the absorbance and r is the distance from the rotor axis). A partial specific volume of the proteins of 0.73 cm3/g in octyl-POE or of 0.757 cm3/g in OG (17Lustig A. Engel A. Tsiotis G. Landau E.M. Baschong W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1464: 199-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) was used for the calculations. The buffer density including octyl-POE is close to 1.0 g/cm3, and therefore runs were performed as in aqueous solutions (18Rosenbusch J.P. Lustig A. Grabo M. Zulauf M. Regenass M. Micron. 2001; 32: 75-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). By using OG the runs were performed at densities of gravitational transparency by adding sucrose as described (17Lustig A. Engel A. Tsiotis G. Landau E.M. Baschong W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1464: 199-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Lyophilized PLB-(24–52) or SLN was dissolved in trifluoroethanol and mixed with synthetic POPC that was dissolved in chloroform. The mixture was dried, dissolved in CH2Cl2, and again dried. Buffer was added to get a final POPC concentration of 6.6 mm. The dispersion was vortexed extensively. For preparation of small unilamellar vesicles, the dispersion was sonified (in ice water, under nitrogen) using a titanium tip ultrasonicator until the solution became transparent (about 20 min). Titanium debris and non-solubilized protein were removed by centrifugation, and the protein concentration was measured. Chemical cross-linking of PLB-(24–52) was performed using bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (BS3), and ethylene glycol bis(sulfosuccinimidylsuccinate) (Sulfo-EGS) (Pierce). Lyophilized PLB-(24–52) was solubilized in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 1% octyl-POE (v/v), or PLB-(24–52) was incorporated into liposomes (see above) using 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5 as buffer. The protein (40 µm) was incubated at a 5–50-fold molar excess of cross-linker for 30 min at 25 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8. Sulfo-EGS is a hydroxylamine-cleavable cross-linker and was cleaved in control experiments by incubating the cross-linked protein with 1 mhydroxylamine for 6 h at 37 °C at pH 8.5. Chemical cross-linking of SLN was performed usingp-azidophenyl glyoxal monohydrate (APG) and 4-[p-azidosalicylamido]butylamine (ASBA) (Pierce). Buffers used were 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, in case of cross-linking experiments with APG, or 20 mm MES, pH 4.5, in case of experiments using ASBA. SLN was incorporated into liposomes (see above), and the protein (60 µm) was incubated at different concentrations of APG for 4 h at 25 °C in the dark. The following photoactivation was performed with a 300 nm UV light source for 15 min at 25 °C. Cross-linking with ASBA was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. SR vesicles were prepared from the fast-twitch skeletal muscle of New Zealand White rabbits (19Fernandez J.L. Rosemblatt M. Hidalgo C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 599: 552-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The SR vesicles were purified on a sucrose gradient, and the Ca-ATPase was purified using a reactive-red affinity column (20Stokes D.L. Green N.M. Biophys. J. 1990; 57: 1-14Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Ca-ATPase was reconstituted with PLB-(24–52) or SLN in lipid vesicles as described (21Karim C.B. Marquardt C.G. Stamm J.D. Barany G. Thomas D.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10892-10897Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). 33 µg of PLB-(24–52) or SLN were reconstituted with 60 µg of purified Ca-ATPase in 2.4 mg of lipids (DOPC/1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine, 4:1) in a final volume of 300 µl. The final ratio of PLB-(24–52) or SLN to Ca-ATPase was ∼10, as shown previously (22Reddy L.G. Autry J.M. Jones L.R. Thomas D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7649-7655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Ca-ATPase activity was measured by an enzyme-linked assay performed in microtiter plates as described (21Karim C.B. Marquardt C.G. Stamm J.D. Barany G. Thomas D.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10892-10897Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Concentrations of SLN were determined by measurement of A 280, using a calculated extinction coefficient of 8480 m−1cm−1 for a folded protein according to Pace et al. (23Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3436) Google Scholar) (SLN is not soluble in guanidine HCl, thus making the Edelhoch method unsuitable for the calculation of the extinction coefficient). Concentrations of PLB-(24–52) were determined with the BCA Protein Assay (Pierce) using BSA as standard protein; the values were increased by a factor of 1.37 because of underestimation by this assay compared with amino acid analysis. In case of protein incorporated into lipid vesicles, 1% SDS was included into the BCA Protein Assay Reagent for protein solubilization (24Markwell M.A. Haas S.M. Bieber L.L. Tolbert N.E. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (5319) Google Scholar). Proteins were analyzed by Tricine/SDS-PAGE (25Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10470) Google Scholar), using 4–5% SDS and 1% 2-mercaptoethanol final concentrations in the sample buffer. Proteins in SDS gels were silver-stained as described (26Heukeshoven J. Dernick R. Electrophoresis. 1988; 9: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). Human SLN and the homologous region of human PLB, PLB-(24–52) (Fig. 1; (1Odermatt A. Taschner P.E. Scherer S.W. Beatty B. Khanna V.K. Cornblath D.R. Chaudhry V. Yee W.C. Schrank B. Karpati G. Breuning M.H. Knoers N. MacLennan D.H. Genomics. 1997; 45: 541-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar)), were chemically synthesized on solid phase using Fmoc/t-Bu chemistry. PLB-(24–52) was obtained in good yields and purity applying standard protocols with double coupling and 2-(1H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate/1-hydroxybenzotriazole activation (16Frank S. Kammerer R.A. Hellstern S. Pegoraro S. Stetefeld J. Lustig A. Moroder L. Engel J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6825-6831Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). For synthesis of SLN several modifications were applied to the standard protocols to improve the yield of the highly hydrophobic protein. The thiazolidine building blocks procedure proposed by Mutter and co-workers (27Mutter M. Nefzi A. Sato T. Sun X. Wahl F. Wohr T. Pept. Res. 1995; 8: 145-153PubMed Google Scholar) did not produce the expected results, and the major product showed a mass correspondent to the des-Ile17–Thr18 protein. Similarly unsuccessful were attempts of fragment coupling on solid support. Best results were obtained adding chloroform to the solvent mixture in the coupling, washing, and deprotection steps (see “Experimental Procedures”). Difficulties were also encountered in the purification of the crude SLN product using HPLC. Insolubility and high affinity to the stationary reverse phase caused irreversible adsorption to a C18 column. Satisfactory results in terms of resolution and recovery were obtained by using C8 columns and a gradient elution by 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid as eluent A and a mixture of acetonitrile/2-propanol (1:1) as eluent B. However, multiple preparative runs were required to isolate homogenous material with an experimental yield of 16% based on resin loading and quantitative amino acid analysis. The CD spectra of both synthetic PLB-(24–52) and SLN in 1% (v/v) octyl-POE were characteristic of an α-helical structure with dichroic minima at 209 and 222 nm and a maximum centered at 193 nm (Fig. 2). Nearly identical spectra were obtained for the two proteins in 1.5% (w/v) OG and 4% (w/v) SDS (data not shown). The spectrum of PLB-(24–52) is reminiscent of those recorded for full-length PLB and the related tryptic fragment PLB-(26–52) (6Simmerman H.K. Lovelace D.E. Jones L.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 997: 322-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 28Vorherr T. Wrzosek A. Chiesi M. Carafoli E. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 339-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 29Arkin I.T.

The two proteins were incorporated into POPC liposomes at a protein concentration of 30–50 µm and a POPC concentration of 6.6 mm, and the CD spectra showed mean molar ellipticities that were in the same range as those obtained in detergents (data not shown). To determine the thermal stability of both proteins, scans in the temperature range from 4 to 96 °C were carried out by recording the ellipticity at 221 nm. Both PLB-(24–52) and SLN did not melt in any of the detergents tested (4% SDS, 1.5% OG; octyl-POE could not be used because it is not heat-stable), and only a linear signal decrease of about 25% during heating could be observed (data not shown). This loss of helicity was completely reversible. High heat stability of the α-helices was also obtained with both proteins incorporated into POPC liposomes (data not shown). These results fully agree with previous observations about the high thermal stability of full-length PLB and the related tryptic fragment PLB-(26–52) (6Simmerman H.K. Lovelace D.E. Jones L.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 997: 322-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 29Arkin I.T. Rothman M. Ludlam C.F. Aimoto S. Engelman D.M. Rothschild K.J. Smith S.O. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 824-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In Tricine/SDS-polyacrylamide gels according to Schagger and von Jagow (25Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10470) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3) and in SDS-polyacrylamide gels according to Laemmli (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207012) Google Scholar) (data not shown), PLB-(24–52) showed the typical monomer-pentamer pattern, which also has been observed for native PLB (31Mayer E.J. McKenna E. Garsky V.M. Burke C.J. Mach H. Middaugh C.R. Sardana M. Smith J.S. Johnson Jr., R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1669-1677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Complete dissociation of pentameric PLB-(24–52) on SDS gels required boiling in the presence of high concentrations of SDS (4–5%) at low protein concentrations, as is the case for native PLB (32Jones L.R. Simmerman H.K. Wilson W.W. Gurd F.R. Wegener A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7721-7730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, and in agreement with published data (14Odermatt A. Becker S. Khanna V.K. Kurzydlowski K. Leisner E. Pette D. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12360-12369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) synthetic SLN was completely in the monomeric state, whether or not the protein was boiled prior to electrophoresis (Fig. 3). Even at very low SDS concentration in the sample buffer (0.1%), no oligomeric structures could be detected (data not shown). The capacity of SLN to be silver-stained was clearly reduced compared with the PLB fragment (Fig.3). The presence of SLN did not change the monomer-pentamer pattern of PLB-(24–52), even at a 10-fold molar excess (data not shown). This suggests that SLN is not interacting with PLB-(24–52) in SDS solutions. For investigation of the oligomeric state of both proteins in nonionic detergents ultracentrifugal techniques were used, which are suitable for the determination of the molecular mass of proteins in these detergents (17Lustig A. Engel A. Tsiotis G. Landau E.M. Baschong W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1464: 199-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 18Rosenbusch J.P. Lustig A. Grabo M. Zulauf M. Regenass M. Micron. 2001; 32: 75-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The ultracentrifugation studies were preferentially performed in 1% octyl-POE because its density is close to 1.0 g/cm3. However, another nonionic detergent, OG, was also used as described (17Lustig A. Engel A. Tsiotis G. Landau E.M. Baschong W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1464: 199-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Sedimentation equilibrium experiments in both 1% octyl-POE and 1.5% OG showed that at the lowest protein concentrations used (20–100 µm) SLN was monomeric to dimeric (calculated molecular mass of the monomer 3.8 kDa) (Fig.4). By increasing the SLN concentration up to 1.06 mm (4 mg/ml), the obtained molecular mass estimates increased up to 22.4 kDa, which is a value in the range of he"

We have found that α2–8-linked oligosialic acids with 5 ≤ degree of polymerization (DP) ≤ 7 occur on integrin α5 subunit of the human melanoma cell line G361. The integrin α5 subunit immunoprecipitated with anti-integrin α5 antibody reacted with the monoclonal antibody 12E3, which recognizes oligo/polysialic acid with DP ≥ 5 but not with the polyclonal antibody H.46 recognizing oligo/polysialic acid with DP ≥ 8. The occurrence of oligosialic acids was further demonstrated by fluorometric C7/C9analysis on the immunopurified integrin α5subunit. Oligosialic acids were also found in the α5 subunit of several other human cells such as foreskin fibroblast and chronic erythroleukemia K562 cells. These results suggest the ubiquitous modification with unique oligosialic acids occurs on the α5 subunit of integrin α5β1. The adhesion of human melanoma G361 cells to fibronectin was mainly mediated by integrin α5β1. Treatment of cells with sialidase from Arthrobacter ureafaciens cleaving α2–3-, α2–6-, and α2–8-linked sialic acids inhibited adhesion to fibronectin. On the other hand, N-acetylneuraminidase II, which cleaves α2–3 and α2–6 but not α2–8 linkages, showed no inhibitory activity. After the loss of oligosialic acids, integrin α5β1 failed to bind to fibronectin-conjugated Sepharose, indicating that the oligosialic acid on the α5 subunit of integrin α5β1 plays important roles in cell adhesion to fibronectin.

Although the molecular basis of the integrin-ligand interaction is not understood completely, a line of experimental evidence suggests that post-translational modifications of integrin α5β1 with carbohydrates are essential for cells to attach to fibronectin. The α and β subunits of integrin α5β1 contained 14 and 13 potential asparagine-linked glycosylation sites in their extracellular region, respectively (7Argraves W.S. Suzuki S. Arai H. Thompson K. Pierschbacher M.D. Ruoslahti E. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1183-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Previous studies indicated that each of the respective chains contained asparagine-linked carbohydrates accounting for a molecular mass of 20,000–30,000 daltons (8Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. J. Biol.

In the present study, we demonstrated the occurrence of α2–8 oligosialic acids on integrin α5β1by applying highly sensitive immunochemical and chemical methods (12Sato C. Inoue S. Matsuda T.

Polysialic acids on glycoproteins were first found in a glycoprotein isolated from unfertilized eggs of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) (14Inoue S. Iwasaki M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

After this discovery, α2–8-linked oligo/polysialic acid 1The terms oligosialic acid and polysialic acid are used for oligosialic acid with a degree of polymerization of up to 7 and polysialic acid with a degree of polymerization of 8 or greater, respectively. has been shown to occur in various animal specimens obtained from insect to human more frequently than hitherto recognized (12Sato C.

Although the functions of oligo/polysialic acids are not fully understood, it has been shown that α2–8-linked polysialic chains are attached to the embryonic form of neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM)2 in mammals (16Sato C.

Biology of the Sialic Acids. Plenum Press, New York1996: 95-144Google Scholar). Polysialic acids are known to negatively modulate N-CAM-associated cell-cell interactions during neurite outgrowth and synaptogenesis because of weak adhesive properties as compared with N-CAM lacking polyanionic polysialic acids (21Rutishauser U. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 679-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 22Rutishauser U. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 70: 304-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Using highly sensitive chemical and immunochemical methods to detect oligosialic acids recently established by Sato et al. (12Sato C. Inoue S. Matsuda T. Kitajima K. Anal.

Furthermore, oligosialic acids were expressed in a number of cultured mammalian cell lines such as human myeloid cell line HL-60, tetracarcinoma cell line PA-1, mouse neuroblastoma cell line Neuro2A, myoblastoma cell line C2C12, and preadipose cell line 3T3-L1, and their expression was reported to change drastically by the induction of differentiation (23Sato C.

Oligosialic acids are thus strongly suggested to play important roles in embryonic development and differentiation. Our present study demonstrates that α2–8-linked oligosialic acids on the α5 subunit of integrin α5β1 are integral for the integrin to bind to fibronectin. Arthrobacter ureafaciens sialidase (EC3.2.1.18), NANase-II from Clostridium perfringens, and peptide-N4-(N-acetyl-β-glucosaminyl)asparagine amidase (EC3.5.1.52) were purchased from Nacalai Co. (Kyoto, Japan), GLYCO (Oxford, United Kingdom), and Roche Molecular Biochemicals, respectively. Endo-N-acylneuraminidase (Endo-N) was prepared from bacteriophage K1F as described previously (24Hallenbeck P.C. Vimr E.R., Yu, F. Bassler B. Troy F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3553-3561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-integrin α5 subunit polyclonal antibody and human anti-integrin α5 subunit monoclonal antibody (mAb) JBS5 were purchased from Chemicon International, Inc. (Temecula, CA). mAb KH/33 against the human integrin α5 subunit, mAb LY111 against chondroitin sulfate, and bovine plasma fibronectin were purchased from Seikagaku Co. (Tokyo, Japan). mAb 12E3, recognizing oligo/polysialic acid, and the equine polyclonal antibody H.46 raised against polysialic acid (developed by Dr. J. B. Robbins of the National Institutes of Health) were donated kindly (to K. K.) by Dr. T. Seki (Juntendo University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan) and Dr. Y. Inoue (Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan), respectively. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat affinity-purified antibody to mouse IgM, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat IgG fraction to rabbit IgG, and mAb P4C10 against the human integrin β1 subunit were purchased from ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Aurora, OH). Synthetic peptides, Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser-Pro and Gly-Arg-Gly-Glu-Ser-Pro, were obtained from AnaSpec, Inc. (San Jose, CA). Protein G-Sepharose, CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B, and the ECL system were purchased fromAmersham Pharmacia Biotech. Phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride was from Sigma, and N-ethylmaleimide andn-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside were from Nacalai Co. (Kyoto, Japan). Polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Immobilon P) was from Millipore (Bedford, MA), and the nitrocellulose membrane and prestained molecular weight markers were from Bio-Rad. Colominic acid from Escherichia coli was provided kindly by Dr. M. Kawase (NGK Insulators, Handa, Japan). Other chemicals were of reagent grade. Human melanoma G361 cells and human chronic erythroleukemia K562 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Fibroblasts were prepared from human fetal foreskin. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (ICN Biochemicals, Inc., Aurora, OH) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum at 37 °C under a humidified 95% air/5% CO2atmosphere. After being washed, the cells were solubilized by lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.2% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.15 mNaCl2, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 2 mm N-ethylmaleimide) for 30 min at 4 °C. The extract was clarified by centrifugation for 5 min at 1,000 ×g and then for 10 min at 13,000 × g. Protein G-Sepharose was preincubated with 50 μg/ml anti-integrin α5 antibody (mAb KH/33) or normal mouse IgG for 2 h at 4 °C. After incubation with protein G-Sepharose, lysates were incubated with protein G-Sepharose pretreated with mAb KH/33 or normal mouse IgG. After incubation for 2 h at 4 °C, the beads were collected by centrifugation and washed with lysis buffer, and the immunoprecipitates were eluted by boiling at 60 °C for 20 min with Laemmli buffer. In other experiments, cell lysate was concentrated and then dialyzed with PBS using Ultrafree®-C3TK (Millipore). Immunoprecipitated proteins or cell lysates were subjected to electrophoresis on 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Proteins were electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose filter or a PVDF membrane for immunoblotting as described (25Towbin H. Staehilin T. Gorden G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44919) Google Scholar). The blots were incubated for at least 2 h in 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS (blocking buffer) followed by the incubation with polyclonal rabbit antibodies against integrin α5 subunits (diluted 1:500 in the blocking buffer) at room temperature for 2 h, or mAb 12E3 and polyclonal antibody H.46 against oligosialic acid and polysialic acid, respectively (diluted 1:500), at 4 °C overnight. Secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat IgG fraction to rabbit IgG (diluted 1:5,000) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat affinity-purified antibody to mouse IgM (diluted 1:1,000) were used at room temperature for 1 h. An ECL system was used for the detection of the immunoblotting analysis. To confirm whether the bands detected on the membrane were specially recognized by mAb 12E3, transblotted membrane was pretreated with A. ureafaciens exosialidase (250 milli-international units) or Endo-N (20 milli-international units) in 2.0 ml of 1% BSA/PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 at 37 °C for 20 h after blocking. The treated membranes were washed three times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 for 10 min, blocked, and immunostained with mAb 12E3 or polyclonal antibody H.46. Integrin α5 subunit blotted on PVDF membranes was analyzed by the fluorometric C7/C9 method for internal sialyl residues in α2–8-linked oligosialic acids. These were determined by fluorometric HPLC after sequential periodate oxidation, borohydride reduction, mild acid hydrolysis, and labeling with 1,2-diamino-4,5-methylenedioxybenzene as described previously (16Sato C. Kitajima K. Inoue S. Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2575-2582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar,26Inoue S. Kitajima K. Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24341-24344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). 5 mg/ml fibronectin (bovine plasma, Seikagaku Co.) was coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B according to manufacturer instructions. Cell lysates were treated with or without 20 milli-international units/ml sialidases at 37 °C for 3 h in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.15m NaCl and then incubated with fibronectin-Sepharose 4B in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 1%n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.15 m NaCl2, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 2 mm N-ethylmaleimide for 2 h at 4 °C. Sepharose beads and associated proteins were then precipitated by centrifugation, washed four times in the lysis buffer, resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and boiled for 2 min. The released proteins were resolved on 6% polyacrylamide gels under nonreducing conditions. Cell adhesion assays were performed as described previously with minor modifications (27Kinashi T. Springer T.A. Blood. 1994; 83: 1033-1038Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 μl of bovine plasma fibronectin (10 μg/ml in PBS) were dispensed into each well of 96-well polystyrene microtiter plates (Costar Corp., Cambridge, MA) and adsorbed overnight at 4 °C. The coated wells were washed three times with RPMI 1640 medium containing 10 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, and 0.03% BSA, blocked with 100 μl of RPMI 1640 medium containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 3% BSA at 37 °C for 2 h, and washed with RPMI 1640 medium containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 0.03% BSA. Cells were harvested by washing four times with PBS (without Ca2+ and Mg2+ cations) and incubating in 2 ml of PBS (without Ca2+ and Mg2+ cations) containing 0.1% trypsin (Difco) and 0.01% EDTA for 1 min. The cells were dislodged by shaking, suspended in 10 ml of standard growth medium, allowed to recover from trypsin treatment for 15 min, and counted using a hemocytometer. The cells were then centrifuged and resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 0.3% BSA at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml. Cells were labeled with 2′,7′-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5 (and -6)carboxyfluorescein (Molecular Probes) and suspended with RPMI 1640 containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 0.3% BSA. The cells were transferred into coated wells at 3 × 104 cells/well and then incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Nonadherent cells were removed with four 21-gauge needle aspirations. Bound cells were quantified in the 96-well plate using a Cyto Fluor® multiwell plate reader series 4000 (Perseptive Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Specific attachment was calculated by subtracting the number of cells attached to BSA from the number of cells attached to fibronectin. The percentage of adherence was calculated by the following formula: percentage adherence = (fluorescence intensity (FI) of experimental wells −FI of BSA-coated wells)/(FI of unwashed wells −FI of BSA-coated wells) × 100. Labeled cells were preincubated with mAbs at 37 °C for 20 min. The cells were then added to precoated wells and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The wells were then washed, and adherent cells were quantified as described above for the cell adhesion assay. The treatment of cells with sialidases was carried out before the cell adhesion assays. Cells (1 × 105 cells) were treated with 0.5 international units/ml exosialidase from A. ureafaciens, 0.5 international units/ml NANase-II from C. perfringens, or 0.1 international units/ml Endo-N from bacteriophage K1F (24Hallenbeck P.C. Vimr E.R., Yu, F. Bassler B. Troy F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3553-3561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in 200 μl of buffered medium (RPMI 1640 medium/PBS (1:1), pH 6.8) for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were treated with or without sialidase or mAb 12E3, suspended at 106 cells/ml and incubated with mAb JBS5 in PBS containing 0.3% BSA for 60 min for 4 °C. The cells were washed with PBS containing 0.3% BSA, incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG for 30 min at 4 °C, washed, and analyzed by EPICS XL (Coulter Corp., Miami, FL). Nonimmune mouse IgG was used as a negative control. To probe the occurrence of α2–8-linked oligosialic acids, the specimen was digested with several different sialidases. NANase-II can cleave α2–3 and α2–6 but not α2–8 linkages of Neu5Ac and N-glycolylneuraminic acid, whereas exosialidase from A. ureafaciens can split α2–3, α2–6, and α2–8 linkages of Neu5Ac and N-glycolylneuraminic acid. Treatment of the cell lysate of human melanoma G361 cells with NANase-II hardly affected the apparent Mr of integrin α5 subunit even if the incubation time was prolonged (Fig. 1). Digestion with exosialidase from A. ureafaciens yielded a sharp band with anMr of 145,000 at the faster moving position than that of intact α5 subunit with anMr of 150,000 (Fig. 1). Although optimal pH values for sialidases from A. ureafaciens and NANase-II were reported to be 5.0 and 6.0, respectively, enzyme digestion was performed at pH 7.5 in 20 mm Tris-HCl containing 0.15m NaCl, because oligosialic acids are sensitive to acidic conditions. The NANase-II-insensitive sialic acid linkages could have been cleaved by exosialidase from A. ureafaciens. Taking all these into consideration, the occurrence of α2–8-linked oligosialic acids of integrin α5 subunit of human melanoma G361 cells has been strongly suggested. The immunoprecipitate of human melanoma G361 cells with the anti-integrin α5 antibody mAb KH/33 was subjected to SDS-PAGE and subsequently transferred to a PVDF membrane. When the membrane was visualized with the anti-integrin α5polyclonal antibody, a broad band with an apparentMr value of ∼150,000 was detected (Fig.2). The band, corresponding to integrin α5 subunit, was also stained with the anti-oligo/polysialic acid antibody mAb 12E3, which recognizes α2–8-linked Neu5Ac oligomers with a degree of polymerization (DP) ≥ 5. However, the integrin α5 subunit hardly reacted to equine polyclonal antibody H.46, which recognizes α2–8-linked Neu5Ac polymers with a DP ≥ 8. These results suggest that the integrin α5 subunit possesses oligosialic acids with 5 ≤ DP ≤ 7. The electroblotted membranes were pretreated with exosialidase from A. ureafaciens, Endo-N, or peptide-N4-(N-acetyl-β-glucosaminyl)asparagine amidase and then stained with mAb 12E3. Endo-N is known as an endosialidase that hydrolyzes α2–8-linked oligo/polysialic acids (24Hallenbeck P.C. Vimr E.R., Yu, F. Bassler B. Troy F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3553-3561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The staining of the integrin α5 subunit with mAb 12E3 completely disappeared after the treatment with exosialidase from A. ureafaciens, Endo-N, and peptide-N4-(N-acetyl-β-glucosaminyl)asparagine amidase. However, pretreatment of the membrane with NANase-II did not diminish the staining with mAb 12E3. Thus, the results indicate that the integrin α5 subunit contained N-linked glycan chains with unique oligosialic acids with an average degree of polymerization of 5–7. Integrin α5β1 can be immunoprecipitated as a heterodimer in the presence of a divalent cation. Although the integrin β1 subunit migrated to the position at an Mr of 120,000 on SDS-PAGE (data not shown), the immunoreactivity at the position ofMr 120,000 with 12E3 was not observed, indicating that oligosialic acid occurs in the integrin α5 but not β1 subunit. Although G361 cells express the 140-kDa N-CAM isoform with oligosialic acid (16Sato C. Kitajima K. Inoue S. Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2575-2582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 19Troy F.A., II Rosenberg A. Biology of the Sialic Acids. Plenum Press, New York1996: 95-144Google Scholar, 20Zuber C. Lackie P.M. Catterall W.A. Roth J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9965-9971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the immunoprecipitate with mAb KH/33 did not stain with the anti-N-CAM antibody (data not shown), showing that staining with mAb 12E3 was attributable solely to oligosialic acid of α5 subunit but not to N-CAM. For chemical detection of α2–8-linked oligosialic acid, the periodate oxidation/fluorometric HPLC method (12Sato C. Inoue S. Matsuda T. Kitajima K. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 261: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) was applied to immunopurified integrin α5 subunit. The internal sialic acid residues in α2–8-linked oligosialyl chains were determined after sequential periodate oxidation, borohydride reduction, and mild acid hydrolysis according to a modified procedure of van Lenten and Ashwell (28van Lenten L. Ashwell G. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 1889-1894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, when an α2–8-linked oligosialyl chain is subjected to periodate oxidation, the nonreducing terminal residue is oxidized to give rise to the C7 analogue of the Neu5Ac orN-glycolylneuraminic acid (5-acetoamido-3,5-dideoxy-l-arabino-2-hepturosonic acid or 5-hydroxyacetoamide-3,5-dideoxy-l-arabino-2-hepturosonic acid), whereas internal residues linked by α2–8 linkages remain intact as the C9 analogue of Neu5Ac orN-glycolylneuraminic acid (2-keto-5- acetoamido-3,5-dideoxy-d-glycero-d-galacto-nonoic acid or 2-keto-5-hydroxyacetoamido-3,5-dideoxy-d-glycero-d-galacto-nonoic acid) (29Rohr T.E. Troy F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2332-2342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the detection of C9 analogues in the periodate oxidation products would further strongly support the presence of α2–8-linked oligosialic acids. Immunoprecipitated integrin α5 was electrophoresed and transferred to a PVDF membrane. When the membrane was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, the band with an Mr value of 150,000 corresponding to integrin α5 was detected (Fig.3). The membrane pieces containing integrin α5 were excised and subjected to fluorometric C7/C9 analysis. C7 and C9 derivatives of Neu5Ac were detected in the molar ratio of 143:5 after complete hydrolysis of the oxidized and reduced integrin α5 subunit. Detection of the C9 derivative was a strong ground for the occurrence of oligomeric sialic acids in the integrin α5 subunit. Assuming that an oligo-sialic acid of the integrin α5 subunit consists of an average of five internal sialic acid residues (refer to the previous section), an oligosialic acid-containing chain occurs in 1 of 143 termini of N-linked oligosaccharides. According to the structural analysis of N-linked oligosaccharides of integrin α5β1 (30Nakagawa H. Zheng M. Hakomori S. Tsukamoto Y. Kawamura Y. Takahashi N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), one N-linked sugar chain is estimated to bear an average of 1.70 termini capped by α2–3 or α2–6 sialic acid residue. Because integrin α5 contains 14 potential N-linked glycosylation sites (7Argraves W.S. Suzuki S. Arai H. Thompson K. Pierschbacher M.D. Ruoslahti E. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1183-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar), integrin α5 contains 23.8 termini capped by α2–3 or α2–6 sialic acid residue. Thus, an oligosialic acid-containing chain appears at the frequency of one of six molecules of integrin α5β1. In the control experiment in which the immunoprecipitate was made with normal IgG in place of the mAb KH/33, the C9 derivative was not detected by fluorometric C7/C9 analysis. Whether integrin α5 subunits derived from other cells of different origins were likewise modified with oligosialic acid was determined using human foreskin fibroblast and chronic erythroleukemia K562 cells. The immunoprecipitate of each cell with the mAb KH/33 was analyzed using anti-integrin α5 polyclonal antibodies, mAb 12E3 and polyclonal antibody H.46. The integrin α5 subunit of both cells reacted to mAb 12E3 but not to polyclonal antibody H.46 (Fig.4 A). Cell lysates of fibroblast and K562 cells were treated with NANase-II or sialidase fromA. ureafaciens, separated by SDS-PAGE, and stained using an anti-integrin α5 antibody and mAb 12E3. Integrin α5 subunits of fibroblast and K562 cells were hardly affected by treatment with NANase-II, although these were sensitive to exosialidase from A. ureafaciens (Fig. 4 B). It then seems that α2–8 oligosialic acids occur on integrin α5 subunits of human foreskin fibroblast and K562 cells. When immunopurified integrin α5 subunit from human foreskin fibroblast and K562 cells (Fig. 3) were subjected to fluorometric C7/C9 analysis, C7 and C9 derivatives of Neu5Ac in fibroblast and K562 cells were detected in the molar ratios of 50:5 and 45.6:5, respectively. Detection of the C9 derivative supports the occurrence of α2–8-linked oligosialic acids, and it is calculated that an oligosialic acid-bearing chain occurs every other molecule of integrin α5 in both samples. The results indicate that integrin α5 subunits of human foreskin fibroblast and K562 cells contain oligosialic acids and that further modification of the integrin α5 subunit with oligosialic acid is ubiquitous, implying its biological significance. To establish the functional role of oligosialic acid of integrin α5subunit in cell adhesion, the mediation of integrin α5β1 in cell adhesion to fibronectin was determined in human melanoma G361 cells. Integrin α5β1 is known as a major fibronectin receptor, recognizing the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequence in fibronectin (31Pierschbacher M.D. Ruoslahti E. Nature. 1984; 309: 30-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (2883) Google Scholar). The adhesion of G361 cells to a 10 μg/ml fibronectin-immobilized plate was dose-dependently inhibited by the synthetic Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser-Pro peptide (Fig.5 A). Treatment of G361 cells with func"

SAPK/JNK activation requires the phosphorylation of Thr and Tyr residues in its Thr-Pro-Tyr motif, and SEK1 (MKK4) and MKK7 (SEK2) have been identified as the upstream MAPK kinases. Here we examined the activation and phosphorylation sites of SAPK/JNK and differentiated the contribution of SEK1 and MKK7α1, -γ1, and -γ2 isoforms to the MAPK activation. In SEK1-deficient mouse embryonic stem cells, stress-induced SAPK/JNK activation was markedly impaired, and this defect was accompanied with a decreased level of the Tyr phosphorylation. Analysis in HeLa cells co-transfected with the two MAPK kinases revealed that the Thr and Tyr of SAPK/JNK were independently phosphorylated in response to heat shock by MKK7γ1 and SEK1, respectively. However, MKK7α1 failed to phosphorylate the Thr of SAPK/JNK unless its Tyr residue was phosphorylated by SEK1. In contrast, MKK7γ2 had the ability to phosphorylate both Thr and Tyr residues. In all cases, the dual phosphorylation of the Thr and Tyr residues was essentially required for the full activation of SAPK/JNK. These data provide the first evidence that synergistic activation of SAPK/JNK requires both phosphorylation at the Thr and Tyr residues in living cells and that the preference for the Thr and Tyr phosphorylation was different among the members of MAPK kinases.

Oliveira-dos-Santos A.J. Kozieradzki I. Fischer K.D. Odermatt B. Wakeham A. Shahinian A. Takimoto H. Bernstein A. Mak T.W. Woodgett J.R. Ohashi P.S. Penninger J.M. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 941-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). These findings allow us to speculate that SEK1-induced phosphorylation of SAPK/JNK may contribute to the kinase activation in different manners dependent on cell types.In this regard, Lawler et al. (14Lawler S. Fleming Y. Goedert M. Cohen P. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1387-1390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using Escherichia coli-expressed recombinant enzymes, have shown that SAPK1c/JNK1 was activated synergistically in vitro by SEK1 and MKK7 and found that SEK1 had a preference for a Tyr residue and that MKK7 had a preference for a Thr residue within the Thr-Pro-Tyr motif in the MAPK. Lisnock et al. (15Lisnock J. Griffin P. Calaycay J. Franz B. Parsons J. O'Keefe S.J. LoGrasso P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3141-3148Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) also reported similar results using recombinant JNK3α1 expressed in E. coli. In a more detailed analysis with SAPK/JNK isoforms (JNK1α1, JNK2α2, and JNK3α1) expressed in insect cells, it has been shown that both SEK1 and MKK7 were required in vitro for the maximum activation (16Fleming Y. Armstrong C.G. Morrice N. Paterson A. Goedert M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). These results give us a hint why two kinds of SAPK/JNK activators, SEK1 and MKK7, exist in cells and explain the differences of the biochemical phenotypes in SEK1-deficient cells to some extent.To elucidate the role of SEK1 in the SAPK/JNK activation in living cells, we first examined the activation and phosphorylation sites of SAPK/JNK in SEK1-deficient mouse ES cells that retain MKK7 expression. The contribution of various MKK7 isoforms to the SAPK/JNK activation was further investigated in HeLa cells that had been co-transfected with each isoform of MKK7 and SEK1. Our present results clearly show that both phosphorylation at the Thr and Tyr residues was required for the synergistic activation of SAPK/JNK in living cells and that the preference for the Thr and Tyr phosphorylation was different among the two members of the MAPKKs, SEK1 and MKK7.DISCUSSIONIt has been reported in in vitro experiments that synergistic SAPK/JNK activation requires both Tyr and Thr phosphorylation within the Thr-Pro-Tyr motif by the two different activators, SEK1 and MKK7 (14Lawler S. Fleming Y. Goedert M. Cohen P. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1387-1390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Lisnock J. Griffin P. Calaycay J. Franz B. Parsons J. O'Keefe S.J. LoGrasso P.

J. 2000; 352: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). This idea was confirmed and further extended by our present intact cell experiments. First, SEK1 appeared to be a selective MAPKK for the Tyr phosphorylation of SAPK/JNK based on the following results. SEK1-deficient ES cells had a defect in synergistic SAPK/JNK activation in response to a variety of stimuli (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3). The Tyr phosphorylation of SAPK/JNK observed in the wild-type cells was almost completely abolished in the SEK1-deficient ES cells (Fig. 3). Moreover, transfected SEK1 selectively phosphorylated the Tyr residue of SAPK/JNK in HeLa cells; the Thr phosphorylation was never observed under the present conditions (Figs.Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6, lane 2, and Fig. 7).Second, the properties of another MAPKK, MKK7, which was initially supposed to be involved in the Thr phosphorylation of SAPK/JNK, appeared to be different among the isoforms (Figs. 7 and8 B). MKK7 isoforms were produced from alternative splicing of one gene locus (11Tournier C. Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Barrett T. Davis R., J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1569-1581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 8 A, MKK7γ1 and -γ2 but not -α1 have an NH2-terminal extension that interacts with SAPK/JNK, and MKK7γ2 has further an extra COOH-terminal region whose biochemical properties remain unknown. This gene locus also produces other isoforms including MKK7α2, -β1, and -β2. However, apparent differences among the isoforms were not reported in the previous studies. In the present study, we found that the MKK7γ2 isoform expressed in HeLa cells was intrinsically a “dual-specific” protein kinase for SAPK/JNK because it phosphorylated the MAPK not only at the Thr residue but also at the Tyr (Figs. 6, D and E, lane 6, and Fig. 7 C). This was in sharp contrast to the action of MKK7γ1, which phosphorylated only the Thr residue of SAPK/JNK (Figs.4, D and E, lane 6, and Fig.7 A). Moreover, MKK7α1 failed to phosphorylate SAPK/JNK at the Thr residue unless the Tyr residue of the MAPK was phosphorylated by SEK1 (Figs. 5 E and 7 B). These differences in MKK7 isoforms may explain the molecular mechanisms of the lost and maintained SAPK/JNK activation observed between sek1(−/−) thymocytes and peripheral T cells (see the Introduction). In other words, the SEK1-deficient phenotype would be varied in the types of cells expressing MKK7 isoforms.Recently, Dong et al. (17Dong C. Yang D.D. Tournier C. Whitmarsh A.J. Xu J. Davis R.J. Flavell R.A. Nature. 2000; 405: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) have generatedmkk7(−/−) ES cells, which lack MKK7 but retain SEK1 expression. They showed that SAPK/JNK activation in response to UV irradiation, heat shock, and other stress signals was greatly reduced in the MKK7-deficient cells as had been observed in SEK1-deficient ES cells (2Nishina H. Fischer K.D. Radvanyi L. Shahinian A. Hakem R. Rubie E.A. Bernstein A. Mak T.W. Woodgett J.R. Penninger J.M. Nature. 1997; 385: 350-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 18Yang D.

Thus, the two MAPKKs SEK1 and MKK7 (probably its γ1 isoform) appeared to be required for the synergistic activation of SAPK/JNK in ES cells. We have also made mkk7(−/−) bone marrow-derived mast cell lines that showed increased cell proliferation in response to the growth factors stem cell factor (c-Kit ligand) and interleukin-3. 2T. Sasaki, H. Kishimoto, J. Irie-Sasaki, G. Matsumoto, A. Suzuki, Z. Yao, A. Wakeham, T. W. Mak, T. Katada, H. Nishina, and J. M. Penninger, submitted. The SAPK/JNK activation by a variety of stimuli including UV irradiation and Fcε receptor stimulation was lost in the mkk7(−/−) mast cells. Interestingly, the expression of SEK1 protein was strongly up-regulated in the mkk7(−/−) mast cells, and SEK1 was phosphorylated upon stimulation. These data indicate that MKK7 is essential, and SEK1 is not enough for SAPK/JNK activation in mast cells. Thus, the same synergistic SAPK/JNK activation by SEK1 and MKK7 has been observed not only in ES cells but also in differentiated mast cells.In the present study, we mainly used heat shock as a stress signal especially in HeLa cells. The molecular mechanism by which heat shock induces SAPK/JNK activation is reported to be due to the inhibition of SAPK/JNK phosphatase(s) rather than the activation of SEK1 and MKK7 (19Meriin A.B. Yaglom J.A. Gabai V.L. Mosser D.D. Zon L. Sherman M.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2547-2555Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). This allowed us to investigate the MAPK activation without specific stimulators of the MAPKKs. Indeed, we could observe the progressive SAPK/JNK activation in a manner dependent on the expressed amounts of SEK1 and MKK7 (see Figs. Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7). Although we have not investigated the effects of other stress signals under the same conditions, it is very likely that SAPK/JNK activation induced by those signals may be different from the present heat shock results. In relation to this, it has been reported that IL-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α mainly activate MKK7 rather than SEK1 (6Moriguchi T. Toyoshima F. Masuyama N. Hanafusa H. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7045-7053Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Lawler S. Cuenda A. Goedert M. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In contrast, SEK1 appeared to be activated by the βγ subunits of G-proteins (20Yamauchi J. Kaziro Y. Itoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1957-1965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These results indicate that SEK1- and MKK7-dependent signaling pathways exist independently in living cells. Our transfection systems presented in this study would be useful to distinguish such differences in intact cell levels.In the stress-responsive SAPK/JNK cascade, full activation of the MAPK mostly requires both stimulations of the two separate MAPKKs, and the activated MAPK phosphorylates its downstream substrates, such as c-Jun and the members of the AP-1 transcription family, to regulate proper gene expression. Therefore, this signaling should strictly proceed without errors. It is thus tempting to speculate that the existence of the two separate pathways leading to SAPK/JNK activation may physiologically function as a fail-safe mechanism. The SAPK/JNK1 is a member of the family of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). This MAPK is activated not only by many types of cellular stresses including heat shock, UV irradiation, and inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α) but also by heterotrimeric G-proteins, phorbol esters, and co-stimulatory activation of T lymphocytes. The activated SAPK/JNK phosphorylates c-Jun, Jun D, and ATF-2 to regulate gene expression for the stress response (1Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3591) Google Scholar). To examine the physiological roles of SAPK/JNK in the stress-induced signaling pathway, we previously disrupted sek1 gene in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells and in mice (2Nishina H. Fischer K.D. Radvanyi L. Shahinian A. Hakem R. Rubie E.A. Bernstein A. Mak T.W. Woodgett J.R. Penninger J.M. Nature. 1997; 385: 350-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 3Nishina H. Vaz C. Billia P.

Development. 1999; 126: 505-516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In thesek1(−/−) ES cells, heat shock-induced activation of SAPK/JNK was almost completely abolished, indicating that SEK1 certainly functions as an activator of SAPK/JNK. However, evidence has indicated that there might be SAPK/JNK activator(s) other than SEK1. Indeed, several groups including us have isolated the cDNA encoding SEK2 (also called MKK7) as another activator of SAPK/JNK (4Yao Z. Diener K. Wang X.S. Zukowski M. Matsumoto G. Zhou G. Mo R.

We have also made mkk7(−/−) bone marrow-derived mast cell lines that showed increased cell proliferation in response to the growth factors stem cell factor (c-Kit ligand) and interleukin-3. 2T.

The SAPK/JNK activation by a variety of stimuli including UV irradiation and Fcε receptor stimulation was lost in the mkk7(−/−) mast cells. Interestingly, the expression of SEK1 protein was strongly up-regulated in the mkk7(−/−) mast cells, and SEK1 was phosphorylated upon stimulation. These data indicate that MKK7 is essential, and SEK1 is not enough for SAPK/JNK activation in mast cells. Thus, the same synergistic SAPK/JNK activation by SEK1 and MKK7 has been observed not only in ES cells but also in differentiated mast cells. In the present study, we mainly used heat shock as a stress signal especially in HeLa cells. The molecular mechanism by which heat shock induces SAPK/JNK activation is reported to be due to the inhibition of SAPK/JNK phosphatase(s) rather than the activation of SEK1 and MKK7 (19Meriin A.B. Yaglom J.A. Gabai V.L. Mosser D.D. Zon L. Sherman M.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2547-2555Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). This allowed us to investigate the MAPK activation without specific stimulators of the MAPKKs. Indeed, we could observe the progressive SAPK/JNK activation in a manner dependent on the expressed amounts of SEK1 and MKK7 (see Figs. Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7). Although we have not investigated the effects of other stress signals under the same conditions, it is very likely that SAPK/JNK activation induced by those signals may be different from the present heat shock results. In relation to this, it has been reported that IL-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α mainly activate MKK7 rather than SEK1 (6Moriguchi T. Toyoshima F. Masuyama N. Hanafusa H. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7045-7053Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Lawler S. Cuenda A. Goedert M. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In contrast, SEK1 appeared to be activated by the βγ subunits of G-proteins (20Yamauchi J. Kaziro Y. Itoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1957-1965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These results indicate that SEK1- and MKK7-dependent signaling pathways exist independently in living cells. Our transfection systems presented in this study would be useful to distinguish such differences in intact cell levels. In the stress-responsive SAPK/JNK cascade, full activation of the MAPK mostly requires both stimulations of the two separate MAPKKs, and the activated MAPK phosphorylates its downstream substrates, such as c-Jun and the members of the AP-1 transcription family, to regulate proper gene expression. Therefore, this signaling should strictly proceed without errors. It is thus tempting to speculate that the existence of the two separate pathways leading to SAPK/JNK activation may physiologically function as a fail-safe mechanism."

G1 progression and G1/S transition also depend on sequential cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) activation. Here, we demonstrate that MAP kinase inhibition leads to accumulation of the CDK inhibitor p27Kip1 in NIH 3T3 cells. Blocking the proteasome-dependent degradation of p27Kip1impaired this accumulation, suggesting that MAP kinase does not act on p27Kip1 protein synthesis. In the absence of extracellular signals (growth factors or cell adhesion), genetic activation of MAP kinase decreased the expression of p27Kip1 as assessed by cotransfection experiments and by immunofluorescence detection. Importantly, MAP kinase activation also decreased the expression of a p27Kip1 mutant, which cannot be phosphorylated by CDK2, suggesting that MAP kinase-dependent p27Kip1regulation is CDK2-independent. Accordingly, expression of dominant-negative CDK2 did not impair the down-regulation of p27Kip1 induced by MAP kinase activation. These data demonstrate that the MAP kinase pathway regulates p27Kip1expression in fibroblasts essentially through a degradation mechanism, independently of p27Kip1 phosphorylation by CDK2. This strengthens the role of this CDK inhibitor as a key effector of G1 growth arrest, whose expression can be controlled by extracellular stimuli-dependent signaling pathways. The p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase is stimulated by various mitogenic stimuli, and its sustained activation is necessary for cell cycle G1 progression and G1/S transition.

More recently, small proteins (CDK inhibitors) that associate and inhibit the CDK-cyclin complexes were identified (1Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5096) Google Scholar). Two gene families of CDK inhibitors are known, the CDK4- and CDK6-specific inhibitors of the INK4 family and the Kip/Cip inhibitors, which include p21Cip1 and p27Kip1.First identified in transforming growth factor-β-treated cells (2Polyak K. Kato J-Y. Solomon M.J. Sherr C.J. Massagué J. Roberts J.M. Koff A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (1824) Google Scholar), p27Kip1 accumulates in serum-starved and density-arrested cells as well as in response to anti-proliferative stimuli (3Polyak K.

Cell. 1994; 78: 67-74Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1927) Google Scholar). Its accumulation is associated to cell cycle arrest in G1and/or to quiescence (5Rivard N. L'Allemain G. Bartek J. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18337-18341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Stimulation of quiescent cells by growth factors leads to p27Kip1 down-regulation, this process being necessary for the G1/S transition (6Coats S. Flanagan W.M. Nourse J. Roberts J.M. Science. 1996; 272: 877-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). First considered as a CKI with broad specificity, p27Kip1 now appears as an inhibitor of CDK2-cyclin E during the G1phase. Its association with the CDK4-cyclin D1 complex does not inhibit this kinase and may even participate to its activation (see Ref. 1Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5096) Google Scholar). Recently, a large number of clinical studies have linked a poor survival prognosis with low levels and reduced half-life of the p27Kip1 protein in many tumor types (for reviews see Refs.7Slingerland J. Pagano M. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 183: 10-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar and 8Sgambato A. Cittadini A. Faraglia B. Weinstein I.B. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 183: 18-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). For these reasons, understanding the regulation of p27Kip1 expression has received a peculiar attention during the last few years.Various mechanisms of p27Kip1 degradation have been described. The best characterized is the ubiquitin-dependent degradation by the proteasome. This involves Thr-187 phosphorylation by CDK2 (9Muller D. Bouchard C. Rudolph B. Steiner P. Stuckman I. Saffrich R.

Translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasmic compartment involves association with the protein Jab1 (17Tomoda K. Kubota Y. Kato J. Nature. 1999; 398: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar) and with the nuclear pore-associated protein mNPAP60 (18Müller D. Thieke K. Bürgin A. Dickmanns A. Eilers M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2168-2180Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Stable trimeric complex between CDK, cyclin, and p27Kip1 also appears necessary for further degradation (16Montagnoli A.

Although this pathway has been extensively dissected and is probably involved in various physiological process, other proteolytic mechanisms have been described. These include ubiquitin-independent degradation by the proteasome (19Shirane M. Harumiya Y. Ishida N. Hirai A. Miyamoto C. Hatakeyama S. Nakayama K. Kitagawa M. J. Biol.

An increased rate of synthesis was described in HL-60 cells arrested in G0 by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (24Millard S.S. Yan J.S. Nguyen H. Pagano M. Kiyokawa H. Koff A. J. Biol.

Science. 1996; 271: 1861-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar), whereas a decrease of synthesis was observed upon stimulation of BALB/c 3T3 cells with platelet-derived growth factor (26Agrawal D. Hauser P. McPherson F. Dong F. Garcia A. Pledger W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4327-4336Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Transcriptional regulation of p27Kip1has been also reported (27Servant M.J. Coulombe P. Turgeon B. Meloche S. J.

Comun. 2000; 269: 31-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar).Besides the level of p27Kip1 regulation, the extracellular signal-regulated transduction pathways involved remain to be clarified. One of them is the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway; phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway inhibitors increase the cellular level of p27Kip1 in various cell types (32Takuwa N. Takuwa Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5348-5358Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Casagrande F. Bacqueville D. Pillaire M.J. Malecaze F. Manenti S. Breton-Douillon M. Darbon J.M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 422: 385-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and the effects of the PTEN phosphatase, a negative regulator of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway, occur through p27Kip1 (34Li D-M. Sun H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15406-15411Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). More recently, AFX-like forkhead transcription factors were found to regulate p27Kip1 gene transcription downstream of the Ras/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B pathway (28Medema R.H. Kops G.J. Bos J. Burgering B. Nature. 2000; 404: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar). In addition to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway, the small G protein Rho was also described as a regulator of p27Kip1 expression (35Hirai A. Nakamura S. Noguchi Y. Yasuda T. Kitagawa M.

Chem. 1999; 274: 3396-3401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar).Mitogenic stimulation by growth factors usually activates the p42/p44 MAP kinase through a pathway involving Ras, Raf, and MAP kinase kinase (MEK). Sustained activation of this pathway is necessary for G1 progression and DNA synthesis (38Pages G. Lenormand P. L'Allemain G. Chambard J-C. Meloche S. Pouyssegur J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8319-8323Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar). Two well characterized cell cycle targets of MAP kinase are cyclin D1 and p21Cip1 (for a review, see Ref. 39Marshall C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 732-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). This pathway has been also shown to affect p27Kip1 regulation in different conditions. In some studies, MAP kinase activation by constitutive Raf or MEK mutants led to p27Kip1 down-regulation (40Rivard N. Boucher M-J. Asselin C. L'Allemain G. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C652-C664Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Treinies I. Paterson H.F. Hooper S. Wilson R. Marshall C. Mol. Cell.

In other cases, similar activation did not modify p27Kip1level but, rather, its association with CDKs (36Weber J.D. Hu W. Jefcoat S.C. Raben D.M. Baldassare J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23966-23971Google Scholar, 43Cheng M. Sexl V. Sherr C.J. Roussel M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1091-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 44Sewing A. Wiseman B. Lloyd A.C. Land H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5588-5597Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Finally, an accumulation of p27Kip1 was also described after MAP kinase activation (45Ravi R.K. Weber E. McMahon M. Williams J.R. Baylin S. Mal A. Harter M.L. Dillehay L.E. Claudio P.P. Giordano A. Nelkin B.D. Mabry M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 46Lahda M.H. Lee K.Y. Uppton T.M. Reed M.F. Ewen M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6605-6615Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The discrepancy of these data, the fact that MAP kinase and p27Kip1 are key elements of G1progression, and the lack of information concerning p27Kip1regulation by MAP kinase led us to address this question in more detail. Here we demonstrate that MAP kinase regulates the cellular level of p27Kip1 both in fibroblastic and epithelial cells through a mechanism independent of protein synthesis. We also bring evidence that p27 degradation induced by MAP kinase is independent of CDK2 activity.RESULTSInhibition of the MAP Kinase Pathway Leads to p27Kip1Accumulation in Asynchronous CellsChemical Inhibition of MEK Triggers p27Kip1Accumulation in Epithelial and Fibroblastic CellsTo investigate the role of MAP kinase on p27Kip1 expression, we used the specific MEK inhibitor U0126. NIH 3T3 and CCL64 cells were seeded at low density and treated with 20 μm U0126 for different times. Due to the chemical instability of U0126, the culture medium was changed every 4 h. To test the efficiency of the MEK inhibitor, MAP kinase activity was detected by Western blotting with an anti-phospho-MAP kinase antibody (Fig.1 B). As expected, treatment of cells with U0126 led to a strong decrease of MAP kinase activity. Western blot analysis of p27Kip1 in these fractions (Fig.1 A) shows a 60% increase of the protein level in NIH 3T3 cells (130% increase after 24 h; not shown) and a 150% increase in CCL 64 cells after 12 h of treatment, suggesting that MAP kinase inhibition leads to p27Kip1 accumulation in asynchronous epithelial and fibroblastic cells. After 12 h of treatment with U0126, 63% of NIH 3T3 accumulated in the G1phase (versus 45% of the untreated control cells), as determined by flow cytometry (not shown).A Dominant-negative Mutant of MEK Increases the Ectopic Expression of Human p27Kip1 in NIH 3T3 CellsTo confirm this observation, a dominant negative mutant of the MAP kinase-activating kinase MEK1 (MEKSA) was overexpressed in NIH 3T3 cells. Since the transfection efficiency in these cells was not high enough to detect variations of the endogenous p27Kip1 by Western blot, we performed co-transfections of human p27Kip1 with the MEK mutant. Under these conditions, each cell transfected with the p27Kip1 expression vector also received the MEKSA construct. Cells were harvested after 24 h of transfection and processed for Western blot analysis (Fig.2). Overexpression of the dominant negative version of MEK induced a weak decrease of endogenous MAP kinase activity (Fig. 2 B), as detected by Western blot with a phospho-MAP kinase antibody. This modest effect reflects the percentage of transfected cells (20–30%) obtained in our experiments. Nevertheless, the ectopic expression of human p27Kip1 was significantly increased (2–3-fold increase) by cotransfection with the dominant-negative MEK mutant (Fig. 2 A). This confirms the results obtained with the chemical inhibitor U0126. Note that in this and all subsequent experiments dealing with ectopic p27Kip1overexpression, the signal corresponding to endogenous p27Kip1 is masked by the high overexpression of ectopic human p27Kip1. Altogether these data suggest that inhibiting the MAP kinase pathway triggers p27Kip1accumulation in two different cell types.Figure 2A dominant negative form of MEK induces the accumulation of ectopic human p27Kip1 in NIH 3T3 cells. NIH 3T3 cells were cotransfected with the dominant-negative mutant of MEK (MEK SA) or with the empty vector (pcDNA) and with human wild type p27Kip1(ect-p27) as described under “Materials and Methods.” 24 h after the transfection, cells were harvested, and p27Kip1 expression analysis was performed by Western blot (upper panel). MAP kinase activity in these fractions was estimated by Western blot with an antibody against active MAP kinase (lower panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)MAP Kinase Activation Down-regulates p27Kip1 in the Absence of Growth Factors or Cell AdhesionA large panel of extracellular signals including growth factors and cell anchorage lead to MAP kinase activation. We tested the ability of the MAP kinase pathway to down-regulate p27Kip1expression in conditions where extracellular mitogenic signals were suppressed, in the absence of growth factors (serum starvation) and of cell-matrix interaction (cells grown in suspension).Co-expression with Constitutively Active MEK Decreases Ectopic p27Kip1 Expression in NIH 3T3 CellsCotransfections of p27Kip1 with constitutively active mutants of MEK or B-Raf were performed in NIH 3T3 cells. Cells were then either serum-starved or placed in suspension for 24 h. p27Kip1 expression and MAP kinase activity were detected by Western blot analysis. Serum starvation as well as anchorage disruption decreased the MAP kinase activity to basal levels in NIH 3T3 cells (not shown). This activity was restored by the expression of B-Raf-CAAX or MEKDD constructs (Fig. 3,A and B, lower panels). By comparison, serum starvation and anchorage disruption also decreased the protein kinase B/Akt activity, but expression of the B-Raf-CAAX and MEKDD mutants did not restore this activity (not shown). In cells overexpressing the B-Raf and MEK mutants, p27Kip1expression was significantly reduced (a 3–4-fold decrease) both in serum-starved (Fig. 3 A) and in suspended cells (Fig.3 B). In the absence of serum, the dominant-negative version of MEK had no effect on p27Kip1 levels (Fig.3 A), likely due to the fact that MAP kinase activity was already low in serum-starved fibroblasts. This was also the case in anchorage-deprived cells (not shown). These data demonstrate that MAP kinase activation can lead to reduction of p27Kip1 levels independently of other signaling pathways stimulated by either growth factors or cell adhesion.Figure 3MAP kinase activation down-regulates the ectopic expression of p27Kip1 in the absence of growth factors or of cell adhesion. NIH 3T3 cells were cotransfected with human p27Kip1 (ect-p27) and various constructs of the MAP kinase pathway, constitutively active versions of B-Raf (B-Raf-CAAX) and MEK (MEK DD) and the dominant-negative form of MEK (MEK SA) as well as with the pcDNA empty vector as a control (Cont). At day 1 after transfection, cells were either serum-starved (A; -Ser) or placed in suspension (B; Sp) for 24 additional hours. At that time, cells were harvested and analyzed by Western blot for p27Kip1 expression (upper panels) and for MAP kinase activity (lower panels) as described before.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Down-regulation of Endogenous p27Kip1 by Expression of Constitutively Active MEKTo confirm these data, immunofluorescence labeling of endogenous p27Kip1 was performed on serum-starved 3T3 cells transfected with MEKDD. First we verified that serum starvation-dependent accumulation of p27Kip1could be detected by this method. As shown in Fig.4 A, serum deprivation of nontransfected cells led to a clear increase of p27Kip1nuclear immunostaining. When transfection was performed with the constitutively active MEK mutant, an important ratio (50%) of cells expressing this mutant contained very low levels of p27Kip1by comparison with the neighboring nontransfected cells (Fig.4 B). As a control, we found no variation of p27Kip1 expression in cells transfected with HA-tagged the regulatory B56 δ subunit of the PP2A phosphatase, a protein unrelated with p27Kip1 regulation.Figure 4MAP kinase activation induces endogenous p27Kip1 down-regulation and/or translocation in serum-starved NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. A, NIH 3T3 cells were serum-starved for 24 h (right panel), and immunodetection of endogenous p27Kip1 was then performed as described under “Materials and Methods.” B, NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with the MEKDD construct, serum-starved the day after transfection for 24 additional hours, and further processed for the double immunodetection of MEKDD with an antibody against the HA tag of this construct (anti-HA) and of endogenous p27Kip1(anti-p27). The arrows point to cells expressing MEKDD (red) with modified expression of p27 (green).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)MAP Kinase Modifies the Rate of p27Kip1 DegradationTo investigate how MAP kinase affects the level of p27Kip1 protein expression, we first used a chemical inhibitor of the proteasome (MG132) to inhibit p27Kip1degradation. Western blot analysis (Fig.5 A) shows that treatment of cells (NIH 3T3 and CCL64) with MG132 induced p27Kip1accumulation. Similar results were obtained with the proteasome inhibitor LLnL (not shown). When cells were treated with MG132 and the MEK inhibitor U0126 at the same time, no further increase of p27Kip1 was observed, suggesting no additive effect of the two drugs. These data suggest that MAP kinase inhibition affects the degradation of p27Kip1 rather than its synthesis.Figure 5MAP kinase inhibition affects the rate of p27Kip1 degradation. A, NIH 3T3 fibroblasts (NIH) and CCL64 epithelial cells (CCL) were treated for 12 h with either the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (MG) or with both this inhibitor and the MEK inhibitor U0126 (U0). Western blot analysis of p27Kip1 expression was then performed on the corresponding cell extracts. B, exponentially growing NIH 3T3 cells were cotransfected with p27Kip1 and either pcDNA empty vector (pcDNA) or dominant negative MEKSAconstruct (MEK SA). The day after the transfection, metabolic labeling was performed with [35S]Met-Cyst for 1 h. Cells were harvested, and immunoprecipitation of p27Kip1 was performed followed by SDS gel separation and autoradiography. Note that only the ectopic p27 (ect-p27) is seen in this picture, due to high overexpression of this protein.C, exponentially growing cells were treated for different times with cycloheximide, and p27Kip1 was detected by Western blot in the corresponding fractions. D, contact arrested cells were rendered quiescent by serum saturation (T0) and reseeded at low density in the presence of serum. After 4 h, cycloheximide was added to the medium with or without the MEK inhibitor U0126 (U0). After two additional hours (T6) cells were harvested, and p27 level was detected by Western blot.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To assess more directly a possible effect of MAP kinase on p27Kip1 synthesis, we carried out the following experiment. We performed [35S]Met metabolic labeling of cells co-transfected with p27Kip1 and the dominant-negative MEK mutant (MEKSA). Ectopic p27Kip1 neosynthesis was evaluated by autoradiography after immunoprecipitation (Fig.5 B). As mentioned for the experiments in Fig. 2, the expression level of ectopic p27Kip1 is far higher that of the endogenous p27Kip1 in these experiments. As a consequence, the protein detected by autoradiography corresponds to the ectopic p27Kip1 exclusively. The endogenous radiolabeled protein would appear as a higher mobility band upon much longer exposure of the gels (not shown). As shown in Fig. 5 B, we did not detect any change in the rate of synthesis of the protein. The same result was obtained in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 during labeling (not shown). Since the total amount of ectopic p27Kip1 in these cells was increased by the coexpression of the dominant negative MEK (as described previously in Fig. 2), we conclude that p27Kip1 accumulation induced by MAP kinase inhibition is due to a decreased degradation of the protein rather than an increased rate of synthesis.To demonstrate the effect of MAP kinase inhibition on p27Kip1 degradation, we investigated the stability of p27Kip1 in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. First, the half-life of the protein was estimated to 2 h in exponentially growing NIH 3T3 cells, as observed after Western blotting of asynchronous cells treated with cycloheximide for different times (Fig. 5 C). To actually demonstrate an effect of MAP kinase on p27Kip1 degradation, we proceeded as follows. Contact inhibited cells were rendered quiescent by serum starvation for 24 h. Cells were then reseeded at low density in the presence of serum for different times, and the level of p27Kip1 was followed by Western blot. Cycloheximide was added to the medium 4 h after reseeding, allowing a direct visualization of p27Kip1 degradation after that time. As can be seen in Fig. 5 D, the degradation of p27 was partially impaired by the MEK inhibitor U0126, demonstrating that MAP kinase inhibition impairs the degradation process of p27Kip1.MAP Kinase-dependent Degradation of p27Kip1in Cell-free ExtractsTo go further into the mechanism of this down-regulation, we performed in vitro degradation experiments of p27Kip1 with cellular extracts from exponentially growing fibroblasts. [35S]Methionine-labeled p27Kip1 was produced by in vitro transcription/translation and incubated for different times with NIH 3T3 cellular extracts. As can be seen in Fig.6 A, an almost complete degradation of p27Kip1 occurred after a 3-h incubation with extracts of untreated control cells. To test the influence of MAP kinase on this degradation, cells were transfected with MEKDD or with pcDNA as a control, placed in suspension for 6 h, and harvested to prepare cell extracts. As shown in Fig.6 B (left panel), extracts from control cells (pcDNA) placed in suspension for 6 h have lost their capacity to degrade p27Kip1, indicating that the corresponding proteolytic activity was adhesion-dependent. When MAP kinase was activated by MEKDD expression, the ability of the extracts to catalyze p27Kip1 degradation was restored (Fig. 6 B, right panel). These data confirm that MAP kinase activation induces a degradation of p27Kip1 in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, and they suggest that this degradation is adhesion-dependent.Figure 6Degradation of p27Kip1 by cell extracts is independent of phosphorylation by CDK2. A and C, cell extracts were prepared from exponentially growing NIH 3T3 fibroblasts (Async.) and incubated with 35S-labeled wild type p27 (A) or T187A-p27 (p27TA) (C) obtained byin vitro transcription/translation. Incubations were performed for different times (expressed in hours), and p27Kip1 was detected by autoradiography. B andD, cells were transfected with MEKDD or empty pcDNA, left in suspension for 6 h (Susp.), and harvested to prepare cell extracts. 35S-labeled wild type p27Kip1 (B) or T187A-p27 (D) were incubated for different times with these extracts and visualized by autoradiography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)p27Kip1 Regulation by MAP Kinase Is Independent of Thr-187 Phosphorylation by CDK2MAP Kinase-dependent Degradation of Mutant T187A p27Kip1 in Cell-free ExtractsThe ubiquitin-dependent prot"

Here we show that STAT5A can serve as a functional substrate of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK). Purified recombinant BTK was capable of directly binding purified recombinant STAT5A with high affinity (K d = 44 nm), as determined by surface plasmon resonance using a BIAcore biosensor system. BTK was also capable of tyrosine-phosphorylating ectopically expressed recombinant STAT5A on Tyr694 both in vitro and in vivo in a Janus kinase 3-independent fashion. BTK phosphorylated the Y665F, Y668F, and Y682F,Y683F mutants but not the Y694F mutant of STAT5A. STAT5A mutations in the Src homology 2 (SH2) and SH3 domains did not alter the BTK-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation. Recombinant BTK proteins with mutant pleckstrin homology, SH2, or SH3 domains were capable of phosphorylating STAT5A, whereas recombinant BTK proteins with SH1/kinase domain mutations were not. In pull-down experiments, only full-length BTK and its SH1/kinase domain (but not the pleckstrin homology, SH2, or SH3 domains) were capable of binding STAT5A. Ectopically expressed BTK kinase domain was capable of tyrosine-phosphorylating STAT5A both in vitro and in vivo. BTK-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of ectopically expressed wild type (but not Tyr694 mutant) STAT5A enhanced its DNA binding activity. In BTK-competent chicken B cells, anti-IgM-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5 protein was prevented by pretreatment with the BTK inhibitor LFM-A13 but not by pretreatment with the JAK3 inhibitor HI-P131. B cell antigen receptor ligation resulted in enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5 in BTK-deficient chicken B cells reconstituted with wild type human BTK but not in BTK-deficient chicken B cells reconstituted with kinase-inactive mutant BTK. Similarly, anti-IgM stimulation resulted in enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5A in BTK-competent B cells from wild type mice but not in BTK-deficient B cells from XID mice. In contrast to B cells from XID mice, B cells from JAK3 knockout mice showed a normal STAT5A phosphorylation response to anti-IgM stimulation. These findings provide unprecedented experimental evidence that BTK plays a nonredundant and pivotal role in B cell antigen receptor-mediated STAT5A activation in B cells.

BTK participates in signal transduction pathways initiated by the binding of a variety of extracellular ligands to their cell surface receptors (2Kurosaki T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 309-318Google Scholar). Following ligation of B cell antigen receptors, BTK activation by the concerted actions of the PTKs LYN and SYK is required for induction of phospholipase C-γ2-mediated calcium mobilization (2Kurosaki T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 309-318Google Scholar). Mutations in the human btk gene are the cause of X-linked agammaglobulinemia, a male immune deficiency disorder characterized by a lack of mature, immunoglobulin-producing, peripheral B cells (6Tsukada S. Saffran D.C. Rawlings D.J. Parolini O. Allen R.C. Klisak I. Sparkes R.S. Kubagawa H. Mohandas T. Quan S. Cell. 1993; 72: 279-290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar, 7Vetrie D.

Saffran D.C. Tsukada S. Largaespada D.A. Grimaldi J.C. Cohen L. Mohr R.N. Bazan J.F. Howard M. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Witte O.N. Science. 1993; 261: 358-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). BTK has an N-terminal region consisting of a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain followed by a proline-rich TEC homology domain. The PH domain is the site of activation by phosphatidylinositol phosphates and G-protein βγ subunits and inhibition by protein kinase C (9Tsukada S. Simon M.I. Witte O.N. Katz A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11256-11260Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The remaining portion of BTK contains Src homology (SH) domain SH3, followed by SH2 and a C-terminal SH1/kinase domain (KD). The SH2 domain mediates binding to tyrosine-phosphorylated peptide motifs on other molecules, and the SH3 domain mediates binding to proline-rich motifs. Mutations in the SH1 domain, SH2 domain, and PH domain of human BTK have been found to cause maturational blocks at early stages of B cell ontogeny leading to XLA (10Vihinen M. Kwan S.P. Lester T.

BTK-deficient mice generated by introducing PH domain or SH1 domain mutations in embryonic stem cells exhibit defective B cell development and function (11Kerner J.D. Appleby M.W. Mohr R.N. Chien S.

Thus, different domains of BTK are important for its physiologic functions. Proximal events involving Src family PTK and SYK that lead to BTK activation following stimulation of the B cell antigen receptor are well known, but only very few signaling molecules have been identified as downstream substrates of BTK (2Kurosaki T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 309-318Google Scholar, 12Yang W. Desiderio S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 604-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Recent observations suggest the involvement of BTK in signal transduction pathways affecting gene transcription (13Hata D. Kitaura J. Hartman S.E. Kawakami Y. Yokota T. Kawakami T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10979-10987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Recent studies have further revealed a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling system for BTK that has implications regarding potential targets inside the nucleus, which may be critical in gene regulation during B cell development and differentiation (14Mohamed A.J. Vargas L. Nore B.F. Backesjo C.M. Christensson B. Smith C.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40614-40619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). An unresolved question in B cell immunology is the nature of the molecular coupling mechanisms that link the proximal signals that are triggered by the engagement of the B cell antigen receptor to downstream signal transduction pathways affecting gene transcription. BCR stimulation leads to the activation of transcription factor NF-κB in a BTK-dependent fashion, which in turn regulates genes controlling B cell growth (15Petro J.B. Rahman S.M. Ballard D.W. Khan W.N. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1744-1754Crossref Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Recently, the BTK substrate phospholipase C-γ2 was shown to couple BTK to the NF-κB signaling pathway (16Petro J.B. Kahn W.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1715-1719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). BTK has also been shown to regulate the nuclear localization and transcriptional activity of the multifunctional transcription factor BAP-135/TFII-I (17Novina C.D. Kumar S. Bajpai U. Cheriyath V. Zhang K. Pillai S. Wortis H. Roy A.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5014-5024Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). These results illustrate that the identification of substrates for BTK in B cells is a critical step to a better understanding of the molecular mechanism(s) of lymphocyte activation through the antigen receptor. Signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) proteins are a family of DNA-binding proteins that were initially identified during a search for interferon-α- or interferon-γ-stimulated gene transcription targets (18Fukada T.

Different ligands and cell activators employ specific STAT family members (21Kaneko S. Suzuki N. Koizumi H. Yamamoto S. Sakane T. Clin. Exp. Immun. 1997; 109: 185-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 22Lichtenstein A. Tu Y. Fady C. Vescio R. Berenson J. Cell.

Immunol. 1994; 155: 428-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The basic model for STAT activation suggests that in unstimulated cells, latent forms of STATs are predominantly localized within the cytoplasm. Ligand binding induces STAT proteins to associate with intracellular phosphotyrosine residues of transmembrane receptors (24Heim M.H. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1995; 267: 1347-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 25Levy F. Kvist S. Int. Immunol. 1990; 2: 995-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Once STATs are bound to receptors, they are phosphorylated by Janus family or Src family PTK (26Reddy E.P. Korapati A. Chaturvedi P. Rane S. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2532-2547Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). STAT proteins then dimerize through specific reciprocal SH2-phosphotyrosine interactions (27Takata M. Sabe H. Hata A. Inazu T. Homma Y. Nukada T. Yamamura H. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1341-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar) and may form complexes with other DNA-binding proteins (28Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1739) Google Scholar). STAT complexes translocate to the nucleus and interact with DNA response elements to enhance transcription of target genes (29Jurlander J. Lai C.F. Tan J. Chou C.C. Geisler C.H. Schriber J. Blumenson L.E. Narula S.K. Baumann H. Caligiuri M.A. Blood. 1997; 89: 4146-4152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). STAT5 is a molecular regulator of proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis in hematopoietic cells (30Nosaka T. Kawashima T. Misawa K. Ikuta K. Mui A.L. Kitamura T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4754-4765Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). B cells abundantly express STAT5, and engagement of the B cell antigen-receptor results in activation of STAT5 (31Karras J.G. Wang Z. Coniglio S.J. Frank D.A. Rothstein T.L. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 39-47PubMed Google Scholar). B cells from mice bearing subcutaneous mammary adenocarcinoma tumors are severely impaired in their ability to generate antigen-specific responses (32Pericle F. Kirken R.A. Bronte V. Sconocchia G. DaSilva L. Segal D.M. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 2580-2585PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, purified B cells isolated from these immunocompromised tumor-bearing mice exhibited a marked decrease in the expression level of STAT5 without a concomitant change in the expression levels of STAT1, -3, and -6 (32Pericle F. Kirken R.A. Bronte V. Sconocchia G. DaSilva L. Segal D.M. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 2580-2585PubMed Google Scholar). The observed correlation of the loss of B cell function with the selective decrease in STAT5 expression suggested that regulation of the STAT5 signaling pathway may provide a molecular mechanism for modulating the antigen-specific B cell responses. STAT5A-deficient mice showed decreased proliferation of splenocytes to interleukin (IL)-2 stimulation, which was reported to result from defective induction of IL-2 receptor chain (33Nakajima H.

Recently, STAT5A and STAT5B doubly disrupted mice have been generated (34Teglund S. McKay C. Schuetz E. van Deursen J.M. Stravopodis D. Wang D. Brown M. Bodner S. Grosveld G. Ihle J.N. Cell. 1998; 93: 841-850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1074) Google Scholar), and Sexl et al.reported that STAT5A/B contribute to interleukin-7-induced B cell precursor expansion (35Sexl V. Piekorz R. Moriggl R. Rohrer J. Brown M.P. Bunting K.D. Rothammer K. Roussel M.F. Ihle J.N. Blood. 2000; 96: 2277-2283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The expansion of B cell precursors is disrupted at the level of late pro-B and pre-B cells in STAT5A/B-deficient mice (35Sexl V. Piekorz R. Moriggl R. Rohrer J. Brown M.P. Bunting K.D. Rothammer K. Roussel M.F. Ihle J.N. Blood. 2000; 96: 2277-2283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These mice also have reduced numbers of circulating B cells in their blood (35Sexl V. Piekorz R. Moriggl R. Rohrer J. Brown M.P. Bunting K.D. Rothammer K. Roussel M.F. Ihle J.N. Blood. 2000; 96: 2277-2283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Notably, Bmx/Etk, another member of the TEC PTK family, was shown to induce activation of the STAT signaling pathway in transfected COS cells and insect ovary cells (36Saharinen P. Ekman N. Sarvas K. Parker P. Alitalo K. Silvennoinen O. Blood. 1997; 90: 4341-4353Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, Bmx/Etk was identified as a critical mediator of Src-induced cell transformation and STAT3 activation (37Tsai Y.T. Su Y.H. Fang S.S. Huang T.N. Qiu Y. Jou Y.S. Shih H.M. Kung H.J. Chen R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2043-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Expression of Bmx/Etk in a human hepatoma cell line Hep3B resulted in a significant increase in its transforming ability, and this effect was abrogated by dominant negative inhibition of STAT3 (37Tsai Y.T. Su Y.H. Fang S.S. Huang T.N. Qiu Y. Jou Y.S. Shih H.M. Kung H.J. Chen R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2043-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), indicating that Bmx/Etk links Src to STAT3 activation and that Src-Etk-STAT3 is an important pathway in cellular transformation. While these results set a precedent for activation of STAT proteins by a member of the TEC family PTK, the significance of these findings for the B cell physiology has not been investigated. The purpose of the present study was to examine the role of BTK in STAT5 activation in B cells that follows B cell antigen receptor ligation. Our experimental data presented herein provide unprecedented evidence that STAT5A is a substrate of BTK and that engagement of the B cell antigen receptor activates STAT5A in a BTK-dependent (but not JAK3-dependent) fashion. Thus, our study provides experimental evidence that BTK couples the STAT signaling pathway to the B cell antigen receptor. Our findings prompt the hypothesis that STAT5A links BTK-mediated signaling events that follow the engagement of the B cell antigen receptor to downstream gene activation. A compromised coupling between BTK and STAT5A might lead to aberrant expression of the STAT5A-responsive genes and might contribute to the XLA and XID phenotypes. Control, XID, and JAK3 knockout mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories. Mouse splenocytes were isolated, starved in RPMI at a density of 10 × 106 cells/ml for 2 h, and then stimulated either with murine anti-µ antibodies (10 µg/ml; Sigma) or recombinant IL-2 (20 ng/ml; R & D Systems) for the indicated times. KL-2 is an Epstein-Barr virus-transformed human lymphoblastoid cell line (4Vassilev A. Ozer Z. Navara C. Mahajan S. Uckun F.M. J. Biol.

The Sf21 (IPLB-Sf21-AE) insect cell line (Invitrogen) derived from Spodoptera frugiperda ovarian cells was used to isolate and propagate recombinant viral stocks and produce recombinant proteins of interest. The cells were maintained at 26–28 °C in Grace's insect cell medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic (Life Technologies, Inc.). Stock cells were maintained in suspension at 0.2–1.6 × 106/ml in 600 ml of total culture volume in 1-liter Bellco spinner flasks at 60–90 rpm. Cell viability was maintained at >95% as determined by trypan blue dye exclusion. The establishment of BTK-deficient DT-40 lymphoma B cell clones has been previously described (38Uckun F.M.

Mutations in the human btk cDNA were introduced by PCR using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) and confirmed by sequencing. Wild type and catalytic domain mutantbtk cDNAs were subcloned into pApuro expression vector and electroporated into BTK-deficient cells. The PTK activity of BTK immune complexes, as measured by in vitroautophosphorylation, was abrogated by the catalytic domain mutation. Equal amounts of BTK proteins were detected by Western blot analysis in all of the BTK-deficient DT-40 clones transfected with wild type or mutated human btk genes, but no BTK protein was detectable in the untransfected BTK-deficient DT-40 cells (38Uckun F.M.

For two-dimensional phosphotryptic peptide mapping, 32P-labeled protein bands were excised and subjected to enzymatic digestion with 100 µg/ml trypsin (Sigma) overnight in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate. Supernatants were dried by centrifugal evaporation, and dried samples were resuspended in 4 µl of a buffer containing 7.8% glacial acetic acid and 2.5% formic acid. Labeled peptides were separated on thin layer phosphocellulose plates (Eastman Kodak Co.) by electrophoresis at pH 1.9 for 30 min at 1000 V, followed by ascending chromatography in a buffer containing 37.5% n-butanol, 7.5% glacial acetic acid, and 25% pyridine. Subsequently, air-dried plates were exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film. For electrophoretic mobility shift assays, cell extracts were prepared according to the previously published method (43Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3915) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed in WCE lysis buffer (50 mmTris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmNa3VO4, and protease inhibitors). An annealed oligonucleotide corresponding to the GAS-like STAT5 binding site in the β-casein gene promoter (5′-AGATTTCTA GGAATTCAAATC-3′) purchased from New England Biolabs was end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase using [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A total of 10 µg of cell extract and 0.5 ng of labeled oligonucleotide were used per reaction. The cell extract and 200 ng of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were first incubated on ice for 15 min followed by another 15-min incubation on ice after adding the labeled oligonucleotide. The reaction products were run on a 5% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA buffer and visualized by autoradiography. The murine wild type STAT5A gene in pBluescript SKII+ vector was a kind gift from J. N. Ihle (St. Jude Children's Hospital, Memphis, TN). The STAT5A gene was excised from this plasmid byEcoRI digestion and cloned into pFastBac1 (PFB) donor vector (Life Technologies). The resulting pFastbac-stat5arecombinant plasmid (PFB-stat5a) was then used to generate the recombinant baculovirus by site-specific transposition inEscherichia coli DH10Bac competent cells (Life Technologies), which harbor a baculovirus shuttle vector (bacmid), bMON14272 with a mini-attTn7 target site for site-specific transposition. The bacterial colonies containing recombinant bacmids were identified by disruption of the lacZα gene. High molecular weight miniprep DNA was prepared from selected E. coli clones containing recombinant bacmid and transfected into Sf21 cells using Cellfectin reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) in a 60-mm dish (1.5 × 106 cells/dish). On day 5 after transfection, the supernatants from each dish were collected and saved for subsequent infections and plaque purification. Similarly, the genes encoding Y694F mutant STAT5A, Y694F-Y STAT5A, wild type BTK, TEC, and JAK3 were excised from pBluescript plasmid, cloned into PFB vector and processed as described above for expression in Sf21 cells. The BTK kinase domain (BTK-KD) gene was amplified from wild type BTK by PCR using 5′-primer (AGCCATGGGAattgatccaaaggacctcac) with a NcoI site and 3′-primer (ATAAGCTTtcaggattcttcatccatcaca) with aHindIII site. The PCR used Taq polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and conditions of 95 °C denaturing for 3 min, followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C denaturing for 1 min, 60 °C annealing for 1 min, 72 °C extension for 2 min, and then running for an additional 10 min at 72 °C. The PCR product was cloned into the PCR2.1 vector (BTKKD/PCR2.1) using the Invitrogen TA cloning technique. The identity of the insert was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Subsequently, the BTKKD/PCR2.1 was completely digested withNcoI and HindIII. The 800-base pair fragment was purified on a 0.8% agarose gel (Qiagene kit) and ligated to the pFastBac HTb donor plasmid (Life Technologies), followed by digestion with NcoI and HindIII to generate pFastBac HTb: BTKKD. Recombinant viral clones were identified visually and purified from plaque assay plates containing 1.5% SeaPlaque GTG agarose (FMC Bioproducts) after 5–6 days at 28 °C. Recombinant viral clones were then amplified in T-25 flask cultures (4.0 × 106/flask on day 0) for 3 days; infected cells were identified morphologically and then screened for production of the respective recombinant proteins by SDS-PAGE on 10% polyacrylamide gels stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R. The various recombinant baculoviruses were inoculated into 25 × 106Sf21 cells, and the cells were harvested 48 h later as detailed earlier (44Williams M.D. Rostovtsev A. Narla R.K. Uckun F.M. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 13: 210-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). When coexpression experiments were performed, the amounts of different viruses were adjusted following preliminary experiments to yield equivalent expression of the necessary proteins. For large scale production of wild type or mutant forms of STAT5A and BTK, 1-liter cultures of Sf21 cells in 3-liter Bellco spinner flasks (1.0–1.2 × 106 cells/ml) were infected with the recombinant plasmids PFB-stat5a or PFB-btk during logarithmic growth with 25 ml of viral stock solution (∼2.5 × 108 plaque-forming units/ml). This infection protocol results in a multiplicity of infection of ∼6. The viral stock solutions were passaged no more than three times following plaque purification prior to use in these large scale infections in order to minimize the presence of defective interfering particles. Cultures were incubated at 28 °C and stirred at 80–100 rpm using a magnetic stirrer (Bellco Glass Inc., Vineland, NJ) for 48 h. Infected cells were harvested by gentle centrifugation in a Beckman GS-6 centrifuge"

Recent studies employing wild type, truncated, and chimeric α2 integrin subunits indicate that the unique phenotypic influences of the α2β1 integrin on cell proliferation and migration on collagenous substrates are mediated through the cytoplasmic domain of the α2 subunit (13Klekotka P.A. Santoro S.A. Zutter M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9503-9511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 24Klekotka, P. A., Santoro, S. A., Ho, A., Dowdy, S. F., and Zutter, M. M. (2001) Am. J. Pathol., in press.Google Scholar). These findings suggested that certain residues present in the α2 integrin cytoplasmic domain not present in the α1 cytoplasmic domain might be responsible for mediating the differing phenotypes.To begin to understand these differences we have undertaken a mutagenesis study to identify the residues within the α2integrin cytoplasmic domain that are required to mediate chemotactic migration in response to epidermal growth factor (EGF) and entry into the cell cycle on type I collagen matrices in response to insulin. We find that the seven amino acids following the conserved GFFKR sequence are sufficient to recapitulate the phenotype of the full-length α2 integrin cytoplasmic domain in mammary epithelial cells. Mutation of the methionine at position 1137 to alanine inhibited both chemotactic migration and entry into S-phase. Mutation of the tyrosine at position 1134 to alanine inhibited migration, whereas it had only a modest effect on the ability of the cells to enter S-phase in the presence of insulin when adherent to type I collagen. Mutation of the lysine at position 1136 to alanine severely inhibited the ability of the mammary epithelial cells to enter S-phase, whereas it had no effect on the ability of the cells to migrate in response to EGF on a type I collagen matrix. Furthermore, these results confirmed our previous findings that phosphorylation of p38 MAPK downstream of the α2 integrin cytoplasmic domain was required for EGF-stimulated chemotactic migration and that up-regulation of cyclin E and cyclin dependent kinase 2 (cdk2) was required for entry into S-phase.RESULTSOur previous studies demonstrated that the α2, but not the α1, integrin subunit was essential for mediating EGF-stimulated chemotactic migration on type I collagen matrices (21Gotwals P.J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 9503-9511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In agreement with recent studies (24Klekotka, P. A., Santoro, S. A., Ho, A., Dowdy, S. F., and Zutter, M. M. (2001) Am. J. Pathol., in press.Google Scholar) and as shown in Fig.1A, the α2integrin cytoplasmic domain was required to support insulin-dependent entry into S-phase of mammary epithelial cells cultured on type I collagen in a minimal media containing only insulin. The α1 cytoplasmic domain did not support entry into S-phase, as also shown in Fig. 1 A. To identify the regions of the α2 integrin cytoplasmic domain that were important for mediating EGF-stimulated chemotactic migration and insulin-dependent entry into S-phase, we constructed a series of truncated α2 integrin cytoplasmic domains containing 14 and 7 amino acids beyond the conserved GFFKR motif (1146 and 1139, respectively) (Fig. 1 B).The 1146 and 1139 constructs were transfected into the NMuMG-3 cell line, and stable cell lines were selected for in G418 (850 µg/ml). Surface expression of the human α2 integrin subunit was evaluated by flow cytometry, and clones that expressed the α2 integrin extracellular domain at levels similar to the X2C2 (wild type) transfectants were utilized (data not shown). Clones of both the 1146 and 1139 transfectants adhered to and spread on type I collagen in a manner similar to the X2C2 transfectants (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 2A, clones of the α2 integrin cytoplasmic domain truncations, 1146 and 1139, migrated in response to EGF on type I collagen matrices in a manner comparable to cells expressing the full-length α2 integrin cytoplasmic domain (X2C2). Similarly, both the 1146 and 1139 transfectants were able to enter S-phase, as measured by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) incorporation, following adhesion to type I collagen in the presence of insulin as effectively as the X2C2 transfectants (Fig. 2 B). These results indicate that the seven amino acids following the GFFKR motif of the α2integrin cytoplasmic domain were sufficient to support EGF-stimulated chemotactic migration as well as insulin-dependent entry into S-phase in mammary epithelial cells adherent to type I collagen. In addition, since the 1139 construct encoded a truncated α2 integrin cytoplasmic domain that was one amino acid shorter than the α1 integrin cytoplasmic domain, the different phenotypes supported by the α1 and α2 cytoplasmic domains fused to the α2integrin extracellular and transmembrane domains were a consequence of specific sequences and not a function of the length of the cytoplasmic domain per se.Figure 2α2 cytoplasmic domain-dependent insulin-stimulated entry into S-phase and EGF-stimulated chemotactic migration on type I collagen. A, X2C2, X2C1, 1146, and 1139 transfectants were serum-starved for 24 h and plated on the upper surface of a transwell filter coated with type I collagen (25 µg/ml). Migration through the pores of the filter was either unstimulated (Control) or stimulated with EGF (10 ng/ml) (EGF). Cell migration proceeded for 5 h in a 5% CO2 humidified chamber at 37 °C. The number of cells attached to the lower surface of the transwell filter was quantitated microscopically. Results are presented as the mean ± S.E. of at least three separate experiments. B, entry into S-phase by clonal cell lines of the X2C2, X2C1, 1146, and 1139 transfectants was determined 24 h after the serum-starved cells were plated on type I collagen in DMEM plus insulin (5 µg/ml). The percentage of cells that incorporated BrdUrd during the final 2 h of incubation was determined. Results shown represent the mean ± S.E. of at least three separate experiments.

Since the data in Fig. 2, A and B,demonstrated that the seven amino acids following the GFFKR motif were sufficient to replicate the phenotype of the full-length α2 integrin cytoplasmic domain, we made an additional cytoplasmic domain truncation by deleting the carboxyl-terminal 17 amino acids of the α2 integrin cytoplasmic domain. As shown in Fig. 1 B, this deletion created a construct that encoded a cytoplasmic domain that consisted of the GFFKR motif followed by the three amino acids of the α2integrin cytoplasmic domain (1135). The 1135 construct was transfected into the NMuMG-3 cell line, and clonal cell lines that expressed the α2 integrin extracellular domain at levels comparable to the X2C2, 1146, and 1139 transfectants were established, as described above (data not shown). Clones of the 1135 transfectants adhered to and spread on type I collagen in a manner similar to the X2C2 transfectants (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 2 C, the ability of the 1135 transfectants to migrate in response to a chemotactic gradient of EGF was significantly reduced as compared with either the X2C2 or 1139 transfectants. Deletion of the four amino acids from the 1139 construct to create the 1135 construct also abrogated the ability of the 1135 transfectants to enter S-phase when plated on type I collagen in the presence of insulin (Fig. 2 D). These results indicate that one or more of the four amino acids deleted to create the 1135 construct was essential for mediating the functions of the α2 integrin cytoplasmic domain exhibited by the X2C2 and 1139 transfectants.Comparison of the seven amino acids distal to the GFFKR motif in the human α2 integrin cytoplasmic domain to those residues in the murine and bovine α2 integrin cytoplasmic domains revealed that only three of the amino acids are conserved across all three species (Fig. 3A). The three conserved residues include the tyrosine at position 1134, the lysine at position 1136, and the methionine at position 1137. Therefore, each of these three residues was individually mutated to an alanine in the 1139 cytoplasmic tail to create the 1139 Y1134A, 1139 K1136A, and 1139 M1137A constructs, respectively (Fig. 3 A). The tyrosine at position 1134 was also mutated to a phenylalanine (1139 Y1134F). Finally, although not conserved across all three species, the threonine at position 1138 of the human α2 subunit was mutated to alanine. These constructs were transfected into the NMuMG-3 cell line, and stable cell lines were established and selected as described above (data not shown). Individual clones of all four transfectants adhered to and spread on type I collagen in a manner similar to the X2C2 transfectants (data not shown). As shown in Fig.3 B, mutation of the lysine at position 1136 had no effect on the ability of the 1139 K1136A transfectants to migrate in response to EGF on type I collagen matrices. Substitution of the tyrosine at position 1134 with a phenylalanine had no effect on the ability of the 1139 Y1134F transfectants to migrate. However, mutation of either the tyrosine at position 1134 to alanine or the methionine at position 1137 to alanine severely reduced the ability of both the 1139 Y1134A and 1139 M1137A transfectants to migrate in response to EGF. Mutation of the threonine at position 1138 to alanine did not have a significant effect on chemotactic migration. These findings established the essential nature of the methionine at position 1137 and an aromatic amino acid at position 1134 for the ability of the α2integrin cytoplasmic domain to support EGF-dependent chemotactic migration by mammary epithelial cells on type I collagen matrices.Figure 3α2 cytoplasmic domain-dependent insulin-stimulated entry into S-phase and EGF-stimulated chemotactic migration on type I collagen is dependent on specific residues.

B, X2C2, X2C1, 1139, 1139 Y1134A, 1139 Y1134F, 1139 K1136A, and 1139 M1137A transfectants were serum-starved for 24 h and plated on the upper surface of a transwell filter coated with type I collagen (25 µg/ml). Migration through the pores of the filter was either unstimulated (Control) or stimulated with EGF (10 ng/ml) (EGF). Cell migration proceeded for 5 h in a 5% CO2 humidified chamber at 37 °C. The number of cells attached to the lower surface of the transwell filter was quantitated microscopically. Results are presented as the mean ± S.E. of at least three separate experiments. C, entry into S-phase by clones of the X2C2, X2C1, 1139, 1139 Y1134A, 1139 Y1134F, 1139 K1136A, and 1139 M1137A transfectants was determined 24 h after the serum-starved cells were plated on type I collagen in DMEM plus insulin (5 µg/ml). The percentage of cells that incorporated BrdUrd during the final 2 h of incubation was determined. Results shown represent the mean ± S.E. of at least three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Next, we evaluated the ability of the 1139 Y1134A, 1139 K1136A, and 1139 M1137A transfectants to enter S-phase in an insulin-dependent manner following adhesion to type I collagen. The data in Fig. 3 C demonstrate that mutation of either the lysine at position 1136 or the methionine at position 1137 abrogated the ability of the 1139 K1136A and 1139 M1137A transfectants to enter S-phase on type I collagen in the presence of insulin. However, in contrast to its effect on chemotactic migration, mutation of the tyrosine at position 1134 to an alanine had only a modest effect on the ability of the 1139 Y1134A transfectants to enter S-phase in an insulin-dependent manner when adherent to type I collagen. Replacement of the tyrosine at position 1134 with phenylalanine had little to no effect on the ability of the 1139 Y1134F transfectants to enter S-phase in the presence of insulin. Mutation of the threonine residue at position 1138 to alanine was also without effect (data not shown). These data demonstrate that the methionine at position 1137 was required for both EGF-dependent chemotactic migration and insulin-dependent entry into S-phase, whereas the lysine at position 1136 was required for entry into S-phase but not for migration. Conversely, the tyrosine, or at least an aromatic amino acid, at position 1134 was required for migration but was not essential for supporting α2 integrin cytoplasmic domain-dependent entry into S-phase in the presence of insulin in mammary epithelial cells expressing a truncated α2 integrin cytoplasmic domain.Progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle and into S-phase requires signals from both growth factor receptors and the extracellular matrix. Signals from growth factor receptors and integrins converge on several signaling pathways including the ERK MAPK pathway (7Aplin A.E. Short S.M. Juliano R.L. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 611-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). We were interested in determining if the ERK MAPK pathway was differentially activated in the transfectants that enter S-phase (the X2C2, 1139, 1139 Y1134F, and 1139 Y1134A transfectants)versus those that do not enter S-phase (the X2C1, K1136A, and M1137A transfectants). The results in Fig.4A, using an anti-phospho-ERK-specific antibody to evaluate the phosphorylation status of the ERK MAPK demonstrated that the X2C2, 1139, 1139 Y1134F, and 1139 Y1134A transfectants exhibited sustained phosphorylation (up to 24 h) of the ERK MAPK following adhesion to collagen substrates. In contrast, the X2C1, 1139 K1136A, and 1139 M1137A transfectants phosphorylated the ERK MAPK for the first 4 h following adhesion to type I collagen in the presence of insulin and then the levels of phospho-ERK decreased to base-line levels (Fig.4 A). To determine if sustained activation of the ERK MAPK pathway was required for entry into S-phase, we utilized a pharmacologic inhibitor of MAPK kinase, PD98059 (33Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2584) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.4 B, incubation of the X2C2 transfectants with PD98059 for the entire 24 h of the experiment significantly inhibited the number of cells entering S-phase, with a p < 0.002. When PD98059 was present for the first 6 h of the experiment and then removed and fresh media added, the inhibitor had no effect on the ability of the X2C2 transfectants to enter S-phase. Conversely, if the inhibitor was added after the first 6 h of the experiment, the compound inhibited the ability of the X2C2 transfectants to enter S-phase just as if it had been present for the entire experiment (Fig.4 B). Immunoblot analysis revealed that PD98059 inhibited the phosphorylation of ERK and that when PD98059 was removed the X2C2 transfectants were able to induce moderate levels of ERK phosphorylation again. Therefore, sustained phosphorylation (>6 h) of the ERK MAPK was required for mammary epithelial cells to enter S-phase following adhesion to type I collagen via the α2β1 integrin. Whereas adhesion to type I collagen of the X2C2, 1139, 1139 Y1134F, and 1139 Y1134A transfectants in the presence of insulin initiated a signal transduction cascade that induced the sustained phosphorylation of ERK required for entry into S-phase, the X2C1, 1139 K1136A, and 1139 M1137A transfectants were unable to induce sustained phosphorylation of ERK upon adhesion to collagen and were therefore unable to enter S-phase.Figure 4α2 cytoplasmic domain-dependent phosphorylation of ERK MAPK is dependent on specific residues. A, following serum starvation the X2C2, X2C1, 1139, 1139 K1136A, 1139 Y1134F, 1139 M1137A, and 1139 Y1134A transfectants were either lysed (time = 0) or plated on type I collagen in the presence of insulin (5 µg/ml). Following adhesion, cells were lysed at defined intervals including 1, 4, 8, 16, and 24 h. Immunoblot analysis of cell lysates was performed using the monoclonal anti-phospho-ERK MAPK antibody (P-ERK) followed by the polyclonal anti-total ERK MAPK antibody (Total ERK). B, entry into S-phase of the X2C2 transfectants was determined 24 h after the serum-starved cells were plated on type I collagen in DMEM plus insulin (5 µg/ml) (Control), in the presence of PD98059 (50 µm) (PD98059), in the presence of PD98059 for 6 h followed by DMEM plus insulin for the remaining 18 h (0–6 h + PD98059 6–24 h −PD98059), or in the absence of PD98059 for 6 h followed by PD98059 for the remaining 18 h (0–6 h −PD98059 6–24 h + PD98059). The percentage of cells that incorporated BrdUrd during the final 2 h of incubation was determined. Results shown represent the mean ± S.E. of at least three separate experiments (upper panel). Following serum starvation the X2C2 transfectants were lysed (time = 0) or plated on type I collagen in DMEM plus insulin (5 µg/ml) in the absence of PD98059 (X2C2), in the presence of PD98059 (50 µm) for 6 h followed by media without PD98059 for the remaining 18 h (0–6 h + PD98059 6–24 −PD98059), or in the absence of PD98059 for 6 h followed by the addition of PD98059 (50 µm) for the remaining 18 h (0–6 h −PD98059 6–24 h + PD98059). Following adhesion, cells were lysed at defined intervals including 1, 4, 8, 16, and 24 h. Immunoblot analysis of cell lysates was performed using the monoclonal anti-phospho-ERK MAPK antibody (P-ERK) followed by the polyclonal anti-total ERK MAPK antibody (Total ERK) (lower panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Following adhesion to collagen the X2C2 transfectants up-regulated the levels of cyclin E and cdk2 as they progressed through the G1 phase of the cell cycle (Fig.5A). However, the X2C1 transfectants induced a transient increase in cyclin E levels but failed to up-regulate cdk2 following adhesion to type I collagen and were arrested in G1. To determine if the inability of the 1139 K1136A and 1139 M1137A transfectants to progress through G1 and into S-phase was due to a failure to induce cyclin E and/or cdk2 expression, the transfectants were serum-starved, plated on type I collagen in the presence of insulin, and lysed at defined time points. As shown in Fig. 5 A, transfectants that were able to enter S-phase (X2C2, 1139, 1139 Y1134F, and 1139 Y1134A) up-regulated the expression of both cyclin E and cdk2 following adhesion to type I collagen in an insulin-dependent manner, as expected. The X2C1 transfectants failed to increase substantially the expression of cdk2 or induce sustained up-regulation of cyclin E (Fig.5 A). The 1139 K1136A transfectants induced cyclin E expression but not up-regulation of cdk2, and the 1139 M1137A transfectants failed to substantially induce expression of cdk2 or sustained up-regulation of cyclin E (Fig. 5 A). These results suggested that α2 integrin cytoplasmic domain-dependent induction of cyclin E and cdk2 levels, and therefore entry into S-phase, following adhesion to type I collagen was dependent on the presence of a lysine at position 1136 and a methionine at position 1137.Figure 5Increased cyclin E and cdk2 expression is dependent on specific residues within the α2 integrin cytoplasmic domain.

The bacterial strategy of macrophage infection, however, remains largely speculative. Wild type Shigella flexneri (YSH6000) invaded macrophages more efficiently than the noninvasive mutants, where YSH6000 induced large scale lamellipodial extension including ruffle formation around the bacteria. When macrophages were infected with the noninvasive ipaC mutant, the invasiveness and induction of membrane extension were dramatically reduced as compared with that of YSH6000. J774 macrophages infected with YSH6000 showed tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins including paxillin and c-Cbl, and this pattern was distinctive from those stimulated by Salmonella typhimurium or phorbol ester. Upon addition of IpaC into the external medium of macrophages, membrane extensions were rapidly induced, and this promoted uptake ofEscherichia coli. The exogenously added IpaC was found to be integrated into the host cell membrane as detected by immunostaining. The IpaC domain required for the induction of membrane extension from J774 was narrowed down within the region of residues 117–169, which contains a putative membrane-spanning sequence. Our data indicate that Shigella directs its own entry into macrophages, and the IpaC domain which is required for the association with its host membrane is crucial.

When Shigella reach the colon, the bacteria are translocated through the epithelial barrier by way of the M cells which overlay the solitary lymphoid nodules (1Wassef J.S. Keren D.F. Mailloux J.L. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 858-863Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Sansonetti P.J. Arondel J. Fontaine A. d'Hauteville H. Bernardini M.L.

Once they reach the underlying M cells, Shigella infect the resident macrophages and induce cell death (4Zychlinsky A. Prevost M.C. Sansonetti P.J. Nature. 1992; 358: 167-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). Meanwhile the pathogens released from the killed macrophages enter into enterocytes from the basolateral surface by inducing membrane ruffles and macropinocytosis. Once the bacterium is surrounded by a membrane vacuole, it immediately disrupts the vacuole to escape into the cytoplasm (5Sansonetti P.J. Ryter A. Clerc P. Maurelli A.T. Mounier J. Infect. Immun. 1986; 51: 461-469Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Within the cytoplasm,Shigella can multiply and move by inducing actin polymerization at one pole of the bacterium, which allows intracellular spreading of the bacterium within the cytoplasm as well as into the adjacent epithelial cells (6Makino S. Sasakawa C. Kamata K. Kurata T. Yoshikawa M. Cell. 1986; 46: 551-555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 7Bernardini M.L. Mounier J. d'Hauteville H. Coquis-Rondon M. Sansonetti P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3867-3871Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Thus, the predominant feature of theShigella pathogenicity is the ability to infect macrophage and epithelial cells, resulting in dissemination to adjacent epithelial cells. A genetic study revealed that Shigella invasion of epithelial cells requires the numerous genes encoded by the 31-kilobase pair pathogenicity island on the large 230-kilobase pair plasmid (8Sasakawa C. Kamata K. Sakai T. Makino S. Yamada M. Okada N. Yoshikawa M. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2480-2484Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pathogenicity island of Shigella flexneri contains 28 invasion-associated genes arranged in several transcribed regions (9Buchrieser C. Glaser P. Rusniok C. Nedjari H. D'Hauteville H. Kunst F. Sansonetti P. Parsot C. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 760-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). One of these contains the ipa genes whose products such as IpaA, IpaB, IpaC, and IpaD are required for bacteria-cell interactions including induction of macropinocytosis from epithelial cells, whereas the mxi and spa regions are mostly involved in the formation of the type III secretion machinery (10Sasakawa C. Adler B. Tobe T. Okada N. Nagai S. Komatsu K. Yoshikawa M. Mol. Microbiol. 1989; 3: 1191-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 11Sasakawa C. Buysse J.M. Watanabe H. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1992; 180: 21-44Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Parsot C. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1994; 192: 217-241PubMed Google Scholar). Studies have indicated that Shigella-induced macropinocytosis in epithelial cells occurs through a complicated process requiring the interaction of the type III-secreted effector proteins and host factors. In this process, the Ipa proteins (IpaA–D) are thought to play the most important roles. However, the involvement of Ipa proteins in the Shigella entry into epithelial cells is complicated and still unclear. Some of the Ipa proteins act both as regulators of the type III secretion system as well as effector proteins within the host cells. For example, IpaB and IpaD act as the molecular plug for regulating the type III secretion system (13Menard R. Sansonetti P. Parsot C. Vasselon T. Cell. 1994; 79: 515-525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 14Menard R. Prevost M.C. Gounon P. Sansonetti P. Dehio C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In addition, IpaB and IpaC, as well as Salmonella SipB and SipC (16Collazo C.M. Galan J.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 747-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) and Yersinia YopB and YopD (17Hakansson S. Schesser K. Persson C. Galyov E.E. Rosqvist R. Homble F. Wolf-Watz H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5812-5823Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), serve as a membrane pore in part of the type III machinery of the host cell plasma membrane, allowing the translocation of secreted effector proteins into the host cells (18Blocker A. Gounon P. Larquet E. Niebuhr K. Cabiaux V. Parsot C. Sansonetti P. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 683-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Upon contact to epithelial cells, a massive amount of IpaB and IpaC proteins is also secreted into the external medium from Shigella and promotes bacterial invasion by interacting with putative host receptors such as α5β1 integrin and CD44 (19Watarai M. Funato S. Sasakawa C. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 991-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 20Skoudy A. Mounier J. Aruffo A. Ohayon H. Gounon P. Sansonetti P. Nhieu G.T. Cell Microbiol. 1999; 2: 19-33Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar). However, these interactions would still be insufficient to elicit the macropinocytic events in epithelial cells required for bacterial entry. Further large scale rearrangement of actin dynamism is assumed to require a second signaling event within the host cytoplasm through the delivery of IpaA, IpaC, and IpgD via the type III secretion machinery (21Tran Van Nhieu G. Bourdet-Sicard R. Dumenil G. Blocker A. Sansonetti P.J. Cell Microbiol. 2000; 2: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 22Sansonetti P.J. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 25: 3-14PubMed Google Scholar). IpaA binds to vinculin, and the IpaA-vinculin complex together with F-actin promotes depolymerization of actin filaments required for modification of Shigella-induced membrane protrusions (23Tran Van Nhieu G. Ben-Ze'ev A. Sansonetti P.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2717-2729Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 24Bourdet-Sicard R. Rudiger M. Jockusch B.M. Gounon P. Sansonetti P.J. Nhieu G.T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5853-5862Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). IpaC somehow modulates actin dynamism, since formation of filopodia and lamellipodia can be induced when purified IpaC protein is added to semipermeabilized Swiss 3T3 cells or aipaC clone is transfected into HeLa cells. The IpaC-induced membrane protrusions have been implicated in the activation of Cdc42 which in turn activates Rac1 (25Tran Van Nhieu G. Caron E. Hall A. Sansonetti P.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3249-3262Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Although the mechanisms of IpaC-induced membrane protrusions are unknown, these studies have suggested that IpaC can somehow act as the effector for promotingShigella invasion of epithelial cells. Many invasive pathogenic bacteria have a specific strategy to resist the bactericidal activities of macrophages. For example, upon contact to macrophages, Yersinia activates the type III secretion system and delivers a set of Yop proteins into the cell (26Rosqvist R. Magnusson K.E. Wolf-Watz H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 964-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 27Sory M.P. Cornelis G.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 583-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 28Lee V.T. Anderson D.M. Schneewind O. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 593-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The injected Yop proteins such as YopE, YopH, YopT, YopO, and YopP act in various ways to prevent phagocytosis and kill the macrophages, such as inducing destruction of actin filaments, interfering with cell signal transduction, or provoking apoptosis (29Lee V.T. Schneewind O. Immunol. Rev. 1999; 168: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Salmonellainduces a macropinocytic event from epithelial cells and macrophages and delivers a subset of effector proteins from the type III secretion system encoded by the Salmonella pathogenicity island I, and then the pathogen can enter both types of cells. In the infection of macrophages, however, the pathogen eventually induces apoptosis to kill the cells (30Chen L.M. Kaniga K. Galan J.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 1101-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 31Alpuche-Aranda C.M. Racoosin E.L. Swanson J.A. Miller S.I. J. Exp.

Cell Microbiol. 2001; 3: 75-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar).Shigella infects macrophages and disrupts the phagocytic vacuoles to escape into the cytoplasm, from which the bacterium later induces the cell death (36Clerc P.L. Ryter A. Mounier J. Sansonetti P.J. Infect. Immun. 1987; 55: 521-527Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A previous study (4Zychlinsky A. Prevost M.C. Sansonetti P.J. Nature. 1992; 358: 167-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar) indicated that internalized Shigella induced macrophage apoptosis after 1–2 h postinfection, in which IpaB protein secreted via the type III secretion system within the macrophage cytoplasm played a crucial role. However, some other studies indicated that macrophage killing by apoptosis could only be induced if the cells were activated such as by stimulating with interferon-γ (37Nonaka T. Kuwae A. Sasakawa C. Imajoh-Ohmi S. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 174: 89-95Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Fernandez-Prada C.M. Hoover D.L. Tall B.D. Venkatesan M.M. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 1486-1496Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whenever Shigellaelicits different killing systems from the infected macrophages, the cell death results in release of massive amounts of interleukin-1β, thus triggering a strong inflammatory response (39Zychlinsky A. Fitting C. Cavaillon J.M. Sansonetti P.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 1328-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), and leads to an increase in the permeability of the epithelial barrier toShigella entry and the migration of PMN1 (40Sansonetti P.J. Arondel J. Cavaillon J.M. Huerre M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 884-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 41Arondel J. Singer M. Matsukawa A. Zychlinsky A. Sansonetti P.J. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 6056-6066Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, elucidation of the bacterial strategy for infection of macrophages is an important issue for understanding the pathogenicity of Shigella and for the development of novel attenuated vaccines that are still invasive but do not induce macrophage cell death. Nevertheless, the molecular basis for infection of macrophages by Shigella still remains poorly understood. Hence, we decided to investigate whether the pathogen had the ability to direct its own internalization into macrophages and induce the activation of macrophage functions. Our data strongly indicate thatShigella directs its own phagocytic events in macrophages by exploiting the ability of IpaC to be integrated into the host membrane. In this study, we provide direct evidence for the first time indicating that the membrane-spanning IpaC domain is critical for the inducing macropinocytic event in macrophages. S. flexneri 2a YSH6000 is the wild type strain, and S325 is a mxiA::Tn5 derivative of YSH6000 used as the negative control deficient in the type III secretion activity (42Sasakawa C. Makino S. Kamata K. Yoshikawa M. Infect. Immun. 1986; 54: 32-36Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). S. typhimurium SB300 was obtained from J. E. Galan (Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT).Escherichia coli MC1061 was used as the host for constructing various plasmids. pBluescript SK+ (Stratagene), pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), pCACTUS-Tpr (43Tamano K.

E. coli JM109 was used as the host for constructing pQE-30 (Qiagen)-borne plasmids. All primers used for construction of the various plasmids are listed in Table I. Strains containing pMW119Tp- or pCACTUS-Tpr-based plasmids were grown in Muller-Hinton broth (Difco) when selection for trimethoprim resistance was necessary. For all macrophage infection experiments, overnight cultures of the bacterial strains were diluted 50-fold in brain-heart infusion broth (Difco) and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. J774 cells (ATCC TIB-67) and THP-1 cells (ATCC TIB-202) were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Sigma), and RAW264.7 cells (ATCC TIB-71) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma). For the preparation of HMDM, monocytes were isolated from the peripheral blood of healthy donors using Ficoll-Paque (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) following the manufacturer's protocol. The separated mononuclear cells were plated on coverslips, and nonadherent cells were removed after 1 h of incubation. The medium was then replaced by fresh RPMI 1640 containing 10% FBS and 50 ng/ml human recombinant granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (PeproTech). Monocytes were cultivated for 5–7 days, and the adherent population was shown to be >95% macrophages as determined morphologically by Giemsa's stain.Table IOligonucleotides used in this studyPrimersSequenceicm-15′-TGGGGGCCCAGATTCTAAAATAAAAGACCicm-25′-TCCCCCGGGTGTGGTTGTTAATACGGGATicm-35′-TCCCCCGGGAATATAATTGACAGCATCicm-45′-CGCGGATCCATTTGAAAATTCGAGAATCicc-15′-TCGTAGCCACTGTTGGTAAACAGGCicc-25′-CGGGATCCGTTGAGCATAGTAAGGGipaD-15′-CGGGATCCATGAATATAACAACTCTipaD-25′-CGGAATTCAGAAATGGAGAAAAAGvirA-15′-CGGGATCCATGCAGACATCAAACATvirA-25′-TCCCCCGGGTTAAACATCAGGAGATAipaC-15′-TAAGGATCCATGTTGCAAAAGCAATTTTGCipaC-25′-TAAGTCGACTTAAGCTCGAATGTTACCAGCNC-15′-CGGGATCCGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGCGNC-25′-CGGGATCCGATATTTCCAGTCTTTCTTCTACTM-15′-ACGCGTCGACTGGAAATATCCAGAGTGCTM-25′-ACGCGTCGACAAGGCCTGGCAGCCCC8–15′-TAAGTCGACCAGAGTGTTCTCTGGAGTAAGC8–25′-TAAGTCGACCTGCAGCCAAGCTTAATTAG Open table in a new tab The antibodies specific for IpaB, IpaC, and IpaD used for the immunoblots have been described previously (45Tobe T. Yoshikawa M. Sasakawa C. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 12: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). A fusion protein of IpaC tagged with six histidine residues at the N terminus was constructed using the QIAexpress system with a pQE-30 plasmid. A DNA fragment including the ipaC gene was amplified by PCR using an ipaC-1 primer containing aBamHI site and an ipaC-2 primer containing a SalI site together with pMYSH6000, the large virulence plasmid in YSH6000 as the template. The amplified BamHI-SalI fragment was cloned into pQE-30, resulting in the plasmid pQE-ipaC-fl. The fusion IpaC protein purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography (Qiagen) was used to immunize rabbits. The anti-IpaC whole molecule antiserum was incubated with nitrocellulose membrane containing transferred fusion IpaC protein, and the Ig fraction specific for the whole molecule of IpaC (anti-IpaC-wm) was eluted. IpaC peptides named IpaC-n, encompassing amino acid residues 35–55 (ISTKQTQSSSETQKSQNYQQI), IpaC-m, encompassing amino acid residues 140–169 (RTAETKLGSQLSLIAFDATKSAAENIVRQG), and IpaC-c, encompassing amino acid residues 228–247 (KQIDTNITSPQTNSSTKFLG), were synthesized. The anti-IpaC whole molecule antiserum was incubated with IpaC-n-, IpaC-m- or IpaC-c-conjugated, epoxy-activated Sepharose 6B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to obtain an Ig fraction specific for each peptide; the antibodies obtained were named anti-IpaC-n, anti-IpaC-m, and anti-IpaC-c, respectively. The invasion efficiency of bacteria was measured with a gentamicin protection assay (46Small P.L. Isberg R.R. Falkow S. Infect. Immun. 1987; 55: 1674-1679Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, a 24-well tissue culture plate (Costar) was seeded with 2 × 105 cells/well and incubated overnight at 37 °C under 5% CO2. Each well was then infected at an m.o.i. of ∼500 for 30 min, before prewarmed tissue culture medium containing gentamicin was added at a final concentration of 200 µg/ml. After a 15-min incubation, the medium was removed, and the macrophages were washed three times with PBS. PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 was then added to each well in order to lyse the cells. After an appropriate dilution with saline, the lysed solution was plated onto L agar, and the number of viable bacteria was counted. Immunostaining was performed essentially as described previously (47Suzuki T. Miki H. Takenawa T. Sasakawa C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2767-2776Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Mac-1 and FcγR were labeled with the anti-Mac-1 mAb M1/70 (BIOSOURCEInternational, Inc.) or the anti-FcγR mAb 2.4G2 (PharMingen), respectively. The anti-rat IgG antibody conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (Sigma) was used as the secondary antibody. In order to measure the invasive capacity of the bacteria by immunostaining, the number of bacteria internalized in the macrophage cytoplasm was counted as follows: J774 cells seeded on coverslips were infected at an m.o.i. of ∼30 and centrifuged for 10 min at 900 × g. The infected J774 cells were then incubated for 15 min at 37 °C under 5% CO2. Next the cells were washed with PBS and then fixed for 15 min with PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde. The fixed cells were incubated in PBS containing anti-Shigella LPS antiserum for 1 h. To visualize extracellular bacteria, the cells were washed and then incubated with anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (Sigma). To visualize intracellular bacteria, the cells were washed again and permeabilized by incubation with PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 for 20 min at room temperature. The cells were then treated once more with the anti-ShigellaLPS antiserum and incubated with anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to Cy5 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Immunostained samples were examined by confocal laser scanning microscopy (Radiance Plus, Bio-Rad). J774 cells seeded on coverslips were infected at an m.o.i. of ∼500 before being centrifuged for 10 min and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C under 5% CO2. The cells were then washed with PBS and fixed in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde. The fixed cells were stained with Giemsa's solution. Photographs of the cells were taken with a CCD camera on the microscope, and the cell areas were measured using IPLab Spectrum software (Signal Analytics Corp.). Macrophages were grown on 12-mm round coverslips (Matsunami) before being infected by centrifugation as described above. For further fixation, the washed and fixed cells were treated with 2% OsO4 and then processed for electron microscopy as described by Ginocchio et al. (48Ginocchio C.C. Olmsted S.B. Wells C.L. Galan J.E. Cell. 1994; 76: 717-724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Visualization of samples was carried out by an S800 scanning electron microscope (Hitachi). For construction of a nonpolar mutant of ipaC, theaphA-3 (kanamycin resistance gene) cassette was used (49Menard R. Sansonetti P.J. Parsot C. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 5899-5906Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Purified pMYSH6000 was used as the template for PCR. Nonpolar mutants of ipaC were constructed as follows: a DNA fragment encompassing nucleotides from position 1226 upstream of the 5′ end of the ipaC gene to nucleotide 215 downstream from the 5′ end was amplified by PCR using primers icm-1 containing an ApaI site and icm-2 containing an SmaI site. TheApaI-SmaI fragment was cloned into pBluescript, resulting in the plasmid pipaC-u. Another DNA fragment encompassing nucleotides from position 1076 downstream from the 5′ end of theipaC gene to nucleotide 2494 downstream from the 5′ end was amplified using primers icm-3 containing an SmaI site and icm-4 containing a BamHI site. TheSmaI-BamHI fragment was then cloned into pipaC-u, yielding the plasmid pipaC-ud. The aphA-3 cassette was cloned at the SmaI site of pipaC-ud in the correct orientation, resulting in the plasmid pBSipaC::Kmr. The inactivatedipaC gene digested from pBSipaC::Kmr at ApaI andNotI sites was subcloned into pCACTUS-Tpr, followed by introduction of the resultant plasmid named pipaC::Kmr into YSH6000 by electroporation. Integration and selection of nonpolar ipaCmutants were achieved as described previously (43Tamano K. Aizawa S. Katayama E. Nonaka T. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Kuwae A. Nagai S. Sasakawa C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3876-3887Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), and the obtained mutant strain, ΔipaC, was named TK001. For complementation of the ipaC gene defect in TK001, pIpaC was constructed by cloning the DNA fragment containing the ipaC gene into pMW119Tp. This fragment was amplified by PCR using primer icc-1 and icc-2 with pMYSH6000 as the template. The effector protein solution released in the Shigella culture supernatants following stimulation with Congo red and the whole bacterial lysate were prepared as described previously (43Tamano K. Aizawa S. Katayama E. Nonaka T. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Kuwae A. Nagai S. Sasakawa C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3876-3887Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Each protein sample from the same number of bacteria was separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-IpaB, anti-IpaC, and anti-IpaD antibody. J774 cells were seeded on 6-well tissue culture plates (Costar) at a concentration of 4 × 105cells/well and incubated overnight at 37 °C under 5% CO2. Shigella and Salmonella strains were added at an m.o.i. of ∼500 and centrifuged for 10 min. COZ, IOZ, or BOZ was prepared as described previously (50Van Strijp J.A. Russell D.G. Tuomanen E. Brown E.J. Wright S.D. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 3324-3336PubMed Google Scholar, 51Tapper H. Grinstein S. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 409-418PubMed Google Scholar). Opsonized zymosan particles were centrifuged onto the macrophage (particle:cell ratio = 10:1) for 2 min. Treatment of macrophage with PMA (Sigma) was carried out at a final concentration of 100 ng/ml. After various incubation times, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and then lysed in 50 µl of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 30 mmsodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100, 100 mm Na3VO4, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/ml pepstatin A, 10 mg/ml leupeptin) per well. The cell lysates were sonicated for 10 s and clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatants were then assayed for protein concentration with SDS-PAGE. The supernatants were incubated with anti-PY mAb 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.), anti-paxillin mAb 349 (Transduction Laboratories), or anti-c-Cbl antibody C-15 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunoprecipitations were performed overnight at 4 °C. Protein G-Sepharose (Sigma) was used for precipitation of the immunocomplexes. The anti-PY antibody RC20 (Transduction Laboratories) was used for detection of phosphotyrosine proteins by immunoblot analysis. In the case of zymosan phagocytosis measured at 0, 15, 30, and 45 min, protein tyrosine phosphorylation was maximum at 15 min after addition (data not shown). J774 or HMDM were seeded on 35-mm dishes. The cells were washed twice with prewarmed RPMI medium without FBS, and then medium containing 1/10th volume of recombinant protein solution prepared at 5 µmwas added. Macrophage shape was observed with an Axiovert 135 microscope (Zeiss) equipped with a SenSys 1400 CCD camera (Roper Scientific) in chamber maintained at 37 °C with a 5% CO2 atmosphere. The bacterial pellet of E. coli HB101 grown to middle log phase was suspended in the FBS-free RPMI medium containing recombinant protein at a final concentration of 0.5 µm. Preparation of J774 cells and the phagocytosis assay were carried out under almost the same conditions as described for the gentamicin protection assay mentioned above. The cell medium was replaced with 0.5 ml/well RPMI without FBS prior to addition of the bacterial suspension. The bacterial pellet was added at an m.o.i. of ∼1000 for 15 min. After gentamicin treatment for 30 min, the internalized bacteria were recovered and spread onto L-agar plates. The DNA fragments containing virA oripaD gene amplified by PCR using primers virA-1 and virA-2 or ipaD-1 and ipaD-2, respectively, were cloned into pGEX-2T. After the purification under native conditions and digestion with thrombin according to the manufacturer's instructions, the GST fusion protein was dialyzed against Tris-buffered saline. pQE-ipaC-fl was digested with SacI and HindIII or StuI andHindIII in order to obtain the plasmids designated pQE-ipaC-ΔC1 (containing the coding region of IpaC amino acid residues 1–284) or pQE-ipaC-ΔC4 (containing the coding region of IpaC amino acid residues 1–169), respectively. After digestion, the DNA fragments containing the pQE-30 sequence were recovered from agarose gel and filled in using T4 DNA polymerase (Toyobo) followed by ligation. To obtain the plasmids named pQE-ipaC-ΔNC (containing the coding region of IpaC amino acid residues 117–284) and pQE-ipaC-ΔCTM (containing the ΔC1 deleted with coding region of IpaC amino acid residues 117–169), the DNA fragments were amplified by PCR using primers NC-1 and NC-2 or CTM-1 and CTM-2, respectively, together with pQE-ipaC-ΔC1 as a template. These DNA fragments were digested withBamHI (for construction of pQE-ipaC-ΔNC) orSalI (for construction of pQE-ipaC-ΔCTM) and"
https://openalex.org/W2026504273,"Several human genetic diseases have been associated with the genetic instability, specifically expansion, of trinucleotide repeat sequences such as (CTG)(n).(CAG)(n). Molecular models of repeat instability imply replication slippage and the formation of loops and imperfect hairpins in single strands. Subsequently, these loops or hairpins may be recognized and processed by DNA repair systems. To evaluate the potential role of nucleotide excision repair in repeat instability, we measured the rates of repeat deletion in wild type and excision repair-deficient Escherichia coli strains (using a genetic assay for deletions). The rate of triplet repeat deletion decreased in an E. coli strain deficient in the damage recognition protein UvrA. Moreover, loops containing 23 CTG repeats were less efficiently excised from heteroduplex plasmids after their transformation into the uvrA(-) strain. As a result, an increased proportion of plasmids containing the full-length repeat were recovered after the replication of heteroduplex plasmids containing unrepaired loops. In biochemical experiments, UvrA bound to heteroduplex substrates containing repeat loops of 1, 2, or 17 CAG repeats with a K(d) of about 10-20 nm, which is an affinity about 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of UvrA bound to the control substrates containing (CTG)(n).(CAG)(n) in the linear form. These results suggest that UvrA is involved in triplet repeat instability in cells. Specifically, UvrA may bind to loops formed during replication slippage or in slipped strand DNA and initiate DNA repair events that result in repeat deletion. These results imply a more comprehensive role for UvrA, in addition to the recognition of DNA damage, in maintaining the integrity of the genome."

Venkov P. Zlatanova J. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 777-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Gal4p is a prototypical “acidic” activator that has been shown to function in a large variety of cell types, indicating that its mechanism of action closely mimics that of activators found in almost all eukaryotic cells (2Fischer J.A. Giniger E. Maniatis T. Ptashne M. Nature. 1988; 332: 853-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 3Webster N. Jin J.R. Green S. Hollis M. Chambon P. Cell. 1988; 52: 169-178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Gal4p has a sequence-specific DNA-binding domain at its N terminus (4Carey M. Kakidani H. Leatherwood J. Mostashari F. Ptashne M. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 209: 423-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) and an acidic activation domain (AD)1 at its C terminus (5Johnston S.A. Salmeron Jr., J.M.

The AD is thought to bind one or more proteins in the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme, chromatin remodeling machines, and perhaps other complexes involved in transcription. Considerable effort has been directed toward attempting to elucidate the direct target(s) of the Gal4 AD, mostly using various in vitro binding assays (7Melcher K. Johnston S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2839-2848Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 8Koh S.S. Ansari A.Z. Ptashne M. Young R.A. Mol.

Whereas these studies have provided several candidate proteins, the physiological relevance of these Gal4 AD-transcription factor complexes remains uncertain. There is only one case of which we aware in which a protein has been implicated as a Gal4 AD-binding partner both biochemically and genetically. This is the Sug1 protein, a constituent of the 19 S regulatory particle (10Rubin D. Coux O. Wefes I. Hengartner C. Young R.A. Goldberg A.L. Finley D.

Cell. 1998; 92: 367-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar). Swaffield et al. (15Swaffield J.C. Bromberg J. Johnston S.A. Nature. 1992; 357: 698-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) isolated an allele ofSUG1 (sug1-1) that suppressed the “no growth on galactose” phenotype of gal4D, a truncation that removes most, but not all, of the C-terminal Gal4 AD and results in a protein with ∼3% the activity of the wild-type activator. Subsequent biochemical analysis demonstrated that a GST fusion protein containing the intact Gal4 AD binds Sug1p in vitro (7Melcher K. Johnston S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2839-2848Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Another suppressor of gal4D, calledsug2-1, was isolated along with sug1-1. The wild-type SUG2 gene was cloned subsequently (11Russell S.J. Sathyanarayana U.G. Johnston S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32810-32817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and was also found to be a component of the 19 S complex. Whereas these data are consistent with a biologically relevant interaction between the Gal4 AD and the proteasome, a concern is that the genetic data could reflect an indirect effect. For example, it is possible that suppression of gal4D could be due to decreased proteasome activity in the sug1-1 andsug2-1 strains, possibly leading to very high levels of Gal4D protein. Since many weak activators function more efficiently when expressed at high levels, this model could explain suppression without invoking a Gal4 AD-19 S interaction, and gross overexpression of Gal4Dp does compensate for the growth on galactose defect (16Russell S.J. Johnston S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9825-9831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Therefore, one must view the idea that Sug1p and Sug2p are true coactivators with caution. A useful and unbiased approach to understanding the protein-binding chemistry of the Gal4 AD would be to use a two-hybrid assay or some similar approach to search for proteins that bind the Gal4 AD directlyin vivo. Of course, one cannot use a potent activation domain as bait in the standard two-hybrid assay, which relies on reconstitution of the activity of a transcriptional activator (17Fields S. Song O.-K. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4860) Google Scholar). Recently, Karin and co-workers (18Aronheim A. Zandi E. Hennemann H. Elledge S.J. Karin M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3094-3102Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar) have reported an alternativein vivo protein interaction assay in which the interaction of fusion proteins containing the factors of interest occurs on the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane and results in activation of Ras. Therefore, one can employ transcriptional activators as bait in this system. We report here that the SUG2 gene product was one of seven putative Gal4 AD-binding proteins isolated from this unbiased in vivo screen. Gal4 AD-Sug2p binding was confirmedin vitro. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the Gal4 AD can bind the native 19 S regulatory particle containing Sug1p and Sug2p in vitro. These data, when considered along with the previous studies mentioned above and other recent results from our laboratories (21Ferdous A. Gonzalez F. Sun L. Kodadek T. Johnston S.A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 7: 981-991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (232) Google Scholar) (see “Discussion”), suggest an important physical and functional interaction between the Gal4 protein and the 19 S regulatory particle. The yeast strain used is cdc25H (MATα, ura3, lys2, leu2,trp1, his 200, ade 101,cdc25–2, GAL +). YPD was made by mixing 1% yeast extract, 2% Bacto-peptone, and 2% dextrose. For plates, 2% Bacto-agar was added. Synthetic defined glucose media with a complete supplement mixture (CSM) except uracil and leucine (SD/glucose (−UL)) were made as follows. 1.7 g of yeast nitrogen base, 5 g of ammonium sulfate, 20 g of dextrose, 182.7 g of sorbitol, 0.67 g of CSM-LEU-URA (Bio 101), and 17 g of agar were mixed in 1 liter total volume and autoclaved. Synthetic defined galactose media (1 liter) with complete supplement mixture except uracil and leucine (SD/galactose (−UL)) contained 1.7 g of yeast nitrogen base, 5 g of ammonium sulfate, 20 g of galactose, 0.67 g of CSM-LEU-URA, 17 g of agar. To generate pSos-Gal4 AD, Gal4 AD (residues 841–874) was PCR-amplified from pHKT-34 with primers containing engineered BamHI sites and was subcloned into theBamHI site of pSOS. This plasmid was called pSOS-Gal4. To generate pMyr-Gal80, Gal80 (amino acids 1–435) was PCR-amplified from pTL37N with primers containing engineered EcoRI sites and was subcloned into the EcoRI site of pMyr. This plasmid is called pMyr-Gal80. To generate pSOS-cI-wt, pSOS-cI-E233K, pSOS-cI-A152T, pMyr-cI-wt, pMyr-cI-E233K, and pMyr-cI-A152T, the papain fragment C of cI (amino acid residues 132–236) was PCR-amplified from Escherichia coli lysogen N99 clt (number 127) using primers containing engineered BamHI and SalI sites for cloning into pSOS and EcoRI and XhoI sites for cloning into pMyr. The PCR product of cI was cloned into pCR-Script. The QuikChange mutagenesis kit was used to generate cI-E233K and cI-A152T. cI-wt, cI-E233K, and cI-A152T were subcloned into the BamHI andSalI sites of pSOS to make pSOS-cI-wt, pSOS-cI-E233K, and pSOS-cI-A152T and subcloned into the EcoRI andXhoI sites of pMyr to make pMyr-cI-wt, pMyr-cI-E233K, and pMyr-cI-A152T. Yeast cdc25h cells were made competent as described by the manufacturer of the Cytotrap kit (Stratagene). 0.5 µg of each plasmid was added to 100 µl of yeast competent cells in separate microcentrifuge tubes. The contents of each microcentrifuge tube were mixed thoroughly, but gently, by inversion or tapping. The transformations were incubated at room temperature for 30 min with occasionally tapping, then heat-shocked at 42 °C for 10 min, and then placed on ice for 5 min. For each transformation, the entire transformation reaction was plated onto a 100-mm SD/glucose (−UL) agar plates. The inverted plates were incubated at room temperature until colonies were visible (4–6 days). Finally, three colonies from each transformation were picked and placed into a well of a sterile 96-well microtiter dish containing 25 µl of water (1 colony per well). 2.5 µl of the yeast/H2O suspension was then spotted onto two SD/galactose (−UL) agar plates. One plate was transferred to 37 °C, and the other was kept at room temperature. Growth at 37 °C was scored after 5 days. Western blots were performed as suggested by the manufacturer of the Cytotrap kit (Stratagene, Inc.). 5 µg of yeast poly(A)+ RNA (CLONTECH) was used to prepared oligo(dT)-primed directional (EcoRI/XhoI) cDNA (prepared by Barry Nieditch). Approximately 800 ng of cDNA was synthesized. The following steps were then carried out. 1) The pMyr vector was linearized with EcoRI and XhoI and dephosphorylated with calf intestine phosphatase. The linearized, dephosphorylated pMyr was resuspended in TE to the concentration of 100 ng/µl. 2) 38 ligation reactions were performed using the rapid ligation kit from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Each ligation reaction includes 100 ng of linearized/dephosphorylated pMyr and 20 ng of cDNA in the final volume of 20 µl. The ligation reactions were incubated at room temperature for 5 min and transformed into XL10-Gold (Kanr) ultracompetent cells (Stratagene, Inc.). 152 transformation was performed using 100 µl of XL10-Gold competent cells and 5 µl of the ligation reaction. The transformation cultures were then combined and plated out on 76 150-mm LB/chloramphenicol agar plates. Approximately 4.5 × 105 colonies were obtained. 3) The colonies were scraped into LB solution and plasmid DNA was prepared with Qiagen's GigaPrep plasmid kit. 40 µg of pSOS-bait plasmid, 40 µg of pMyr-cDNA plasmid library, and 108 µl of β-mercaptoethanol were added to 10 ml of competent yeast cdc25h cells in a 50-ml conical tube. The contents were mixed thoroughly but gently. The contents were then transferred into 20 microcentrifuge tubes. In a separate microcentrifuge tube, 2 µg of pSOS plasmid was added to 2 µg of pMyr-cDNA plasmid library and 5.4 µl of β-mercaptoethanol to 500 µl of yeast competent cells. The transformations were incubated at room temperature for 30 min with occasional mixing, heat-shocked at 42 °C for 10 min, and then placed on ice for 5 min. For each transformation, the entire reaction was plated onto a 150-mm SD/glucose (−UL) agar plate using glass beads. It is very important to use glass beads to achieve even distribution of yeast colonies on the plates. The inverted plates were incubated at room temperature for 48 h. The transformants were replica-plated onto SD/galactose (−UL) agar plates and incubated at 37 °C. Colonies appeared after 3 days and most were picked after 6 days, but the plates were kept at 37 °C since some colonies may appear much later (10 days). Colonies arising from the pSOS and pMyr-cDNA transformation provide an estimate of the numbers of false-positive clones from the cDNA library and the temperature-sensitive revertants. The colonies that grew at 37 °C were patched onto two SD/glucose (−UL) and one SD/galactose (−UL) agar plates. One SD/glucose (−UL) and one SD/galactose (−UL) agar plate were transferred to 37 °C. The other SD/glucose (−UL) agar plate was kept at room temperature for further patching. Colonies that grew at 37 °C on SD/galactose (−UL) agar plates, but not on SD/glucose (−UL) agar plates, were repatched. Only those colonies that grow at 37 °C on SD/galactose (−UL) agar plates, but not on SD/glucose (−UL) agar plates, both times were considered “putative-positive” clones and analyzed further. Isolation of pMyr-cDNA plasmids from yeast was done as suggested by the manufacturer of the Cytotrap kit (Stratagene, Inc.). 35S-Labeled proteins were transcribed and translated in vitro using the TNT rabbit reticulocyte kit from Promega. GST fusion proteins were produced in E. colistrain BL21 (DE, pLysS) and bound to glutathione-conjugated agarose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Fusion protein concentrations were determined by BCA assay (Pierce). 5 µg of GST or GST-AD (GST-34), while on agarose beads, was incubated with the 35S-labeled proteins in bead buffer (50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.0, 150 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1% Tween 20) that also contained 10 mg ml−1soluble E. coli lysate as a nonspecific competitor. Glutathione beads and labeled proteins were incubated at 4 °C with gentle agitation for 1 h. Following incubation, the beads were centrifuged and washed 4 times in 1.5 ml of bead buffer. After the final wash, the entire supernatant was carefully removed and 20 µl of SDS loading buffer was added to the beads. The beads were then boiled for 5 min and loaded onto a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. The gels were transferred to nitrocellulose for 45 min at 24 V using a Genie electroblotter (Idea Scientific). Membranes were then used for measurement of labeled protein by phosphorimaging (Molecular Dynamics). Inputs represent 10% of total input. The purification of 19 S was carried out according to the method of Vermaet al. (19Verma R. Chen S. Feldman R. Schieltz D. Yates J. Dohmen J. Deshaies R.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3425-3439Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The protocol involves initial purification of the intact 26 S proteasome carrying a FLAG tag on the C terminus of the Pre1 protein (a 20 S substituent) by immunoaffinity chromatography and FLAG peptide elution. Specifically, eight liters of a culture derived from the yeast strain RJD1144 (MATa his3Δ200 leu2–3, 112 lys2–801 trpΔ63 PRE1FLAG::YIplac211(URA3); kindly provided by Prof. R. Deshais and R. Verma, Caltech) was grown in synthetic uracil dropout medium to an A 600 of 2–3. The cells were pelleted, washed with distilled water, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The frozen pellet was ground in mortar filled with liquid nitrogen until a very fine powder was obtained. Three volumes of buffer A (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2) plus an ATP-regenerating system (20Kodadek T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 172: 804-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) were added. The solution was centrifuged in an SS34 rotor at 13,000 × g for 20 min. After centrifugation, the cleared lysate was transferred to another tube and incubated with immobilized anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (Sigma) for 90 min. The beads were then pelleted and washed in buffer A + 2 mm ATP + 0.1% Triton X four times and with buffer A + 2 mm ATP twice. Beads were then incubated with 150 µg/ml FLAG peptide for at least 4 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected. Typically, this protocol yields approximately 1 mg of highly purified 26 S proteasome. To obtain the 19 S regulatory complex, this 26 S preparation was then dialyzed in buffer A + 350 mm NaCl in the absence of ATP overnight to favor dissociation of the 19 S regulatory particle and the 20 S core complex, as well as to remove free FLAG peptide. This was then followed by dialysis in buffer A for another hour. The preparation was then incubated with immobilized anti-FLAG antibody again for 90 min to bind the free FLAG-tagged 20 S core proteasome. The supernatant was collected, concentrated in a Centricon filter device, and found by gel electrophoresis and Western blotting (21Ferdous A. Gonzalez F. Sun L. Kodadek T. Johnston S.A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 7: 981-991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (232) Google Scholar) to be largely free of 20 S complex. Approximately 300 µg of the 19 S complex was obtained from the 8-liter culture. 7.5 µg of GST-Gal4 AD was incubated with 12 µg of the 19 S preparation in 100 µl of MTB buffer for 1 h. Glutathione-agarose beads were then added, and 30 min later the bead-bound material was isolated by a brief centrifugation. The beads were washed three times with MTB buffer, and the bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE/Western blotting. The same protocol was employed in a control reaction using green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused to GST rather than the Gal4 AD. Mammalian 19 S was immunoprecipitated from an in vitro translated (radiolabeled) ySug2p-containing lysate according to the method described by Hendil and co-workers (22Hendil K.B. Khan S. Tanaka K. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 749-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). 10 µl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate containing in vitro translated yeast Sug2p lysate was pre-cleared by the addition of 20 µl of 10% protein A + Staphylococcus aureus cells (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 400 µl of IP buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 2 mm ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm KCl, 17% glycerol, 40 mm creatine phosphate, and 0.2 mg/ml creatine phosphokinase). The suspension was incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. The pre-cleared lysate was centrifuged briefly, and the supernatant was used for the subsequent immunoprecipitation experiments. Equal 130-µl aliquots of the cleared lysate were kept as an input fraction or incubated with 270 µl of IP buffer and 20 µl of protein A +S. aureus cells that had been loaded with either mouse monoclonal anti p45/110 (mSug1p, courtesy of Dr. K. B. Hendil, University of Copenhagen) or anti-trinitrophenol (PharMingen). Following a 1-h incubation at 4 °C, the suspensions were centrifuged at 8000 × g for 2 min. The supernatant was retained, and then total protein was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid. The pellet was washed 3 times in 1 ml of IP buffer. Each sample was then resuspended in SDS-containing loading buffer supplemented with 8m urea, boiled for 2 min, and electrophoresed through a 10% SDS-PAGE. Gels were then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Osmonics) using a Genie blotter (Idea Scientific). The presence of radiolabeled yeast Sug2p was assessed by exposing the nitrocellulose membrane to a PhosphorImager screen and reading the screen on the Storm system (Molecular Dynamics). Following visualization of radioactive proteins, the membranes were washed thoroughly in TBST to remove residual radioactivity. For Western blot analysis, nitrocellulose membranes were then subjected to Western blot analysis to assess the quality of the immunoprecipitation. Membranes were probed first with rabbit anti-Mss1p antisera (Affinity Research), washed extensively, and then probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antisera (Pierce). The blots were developed using Supersignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce). The “Cytotrap©”, or SOS, protein-interaction assay developed by Aronheim et al. (18Aronheim A. Zandi E. Hennemann H. Elledge S.J. Karin M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3094-3102Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar) was used to screen a yeast cDNA library for polypeptides that interact with the core Gal4 AD (residues 841–875). As shown schematically in Fig. 1 A, the “bait” protein (here the Gal4 AD) was fused to the human son of sevenless protein (SOS), the analogue of yeast Cdc25 protein, an activator of Ras, and the other was tagged with a myristoylation sequence. Unlike yeast Cdc25p, hSOSp lacks specific interactions with native yeast proteins that can recruit it to the plasma membrane. Therefore, in cells carrying a temperature-sensitive cdc25allele, Ras can be activated at the restrictive temperature only if hSOSp is recruited to the membrane via an interaction between the protein fused to it and the membrane-localized myristoylated protein. To ensure that this assay would be useful for the identification of AD-binding proteins, the well characterized interaction between the Gal4 AD and Gal80 repressor protein (5Johnston S.A. Salmeron Jr., J.M. Dincher S.S. Cell. 1987; 50: 143-146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 23Ma J. Ptashne M. Cell. 1987; 50: 137-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 24Chasman D.I. Kornberg R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2916-2923Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 25Parthun M.R. Jaehning J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4981-4987Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) was employed. The Gal4 AD was fused to hSOSp, and Gal80p was tagged with a myristoylation signal. Cells expressing either pSOS-Gal4 AD or pMyr-Gal80p did not grow at 37 °C, but cells expressing both proteins did (Fig.1 B). Another concern was that the isolated Gal4 AD might enter into spurious, low affinity interactions given its rather “sticky” nature (26Melcher K. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 1097-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and that these would be sufficient to result in Ras activation. However, when the λ repressor dimerization domain was substituted for the Gal80 protein, no growth was observed (Fig.1 B). Thus, specific interaction between Gal4 AD and Gal80 protein, but not nonspecific AD-protein interactions, can recruit hSOSp to the membrane and activate Ras, thereby allowing cdc25H cells to grow at 37 °C. Most AD-transcription complexes that have been examined in detail do not associate with extremely high affinities. Therefore, prior to carrying out the library screen, it was also of interest to estimate the minimum binding affinity required to obtain a “hit” in the Cytotrap system. To do so, the dimerization domains of wild-type λ Repressor (cI) protein and two mutants were employed. Wild-type repressor dimerizes in solution with a K D of 20 nm (27Estojak J. Brent R. Golemis E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5820-5829Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar), whereas the two mutants, E223K and A152T, dimerize with K D values of 100 nm and >1 µm, respectively (28Cohen S. Knoll B.J. Little J.W. Mount D.W. Nature. 1981; 294: 182-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 29Gimble F.S. Sauer R.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 29-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.2, the use of the wild-type repressor dimerization domain and the E233K mutant generated a positive result in the Cytotrap assay, but dimerization of the A152T mutant could not be detected, despite the fact that Western blots revealed all of the fusion proteins to be expressed in approximately equal quantities (data not shown). These data suggest that the Cytotrap assay is capable of detecting protein-protein interactions with K Dvalues of 200 nm or lower but cannot detect interactions with K D values above 1 µm. With these preliminary results in hand, SOS-Gal4 AD was used as bait in an experiment using a yeast cDNA library fused to a myristoylation tag under the control of the GAL1 promoter. Approximately 5 × 105 transformants containing library plasmids and the pSOS-Gal4 AD plasmid were grown on SD/glucose (−UL) agar plates at 25 °C, replica-plated onto SD/galactose (−UL) agar plates, and transferred to 37 °C. 344 colonies that grew at 37 °C were isolated and tested for growth on SD/glucose (−UL) and SD/galactose (−UL) agar plates at 37 °C. Library plasmids were isolated from 53 clones that exhibited galactose-dependent growth at 37 °C. These were re-transformed into cdc25H cells with either the original bait (pSOS-Gal4 AD) or pSOS. Twenty five isolates did not exhibit Gal4 AD-dependent growth and thus represent the background of the cDNA library. These plasmids include members of the Ras family and components of the Ras signaling pathway such as protein kinase C, etc. Fourteen plasmids suppressed the cdc25 phenotype only in the presence of pSOS-Gal4. These were sequenced. Seven different putative Gal4 AD-binding polypeptides were identified. Four were known proteins as follows: Hap5p, a fragment of TATA-binding protein-associated factor 60 (TAFII60), Apl1p, and Sug2p. Three corresponded to putative open reading frames with no known function. Hap5p is a member of the heterotrimeric CCAAT-binding complex and is involved in the activation of a number of genes in response to a non-fermentable carbon source (30McNabb D.S. Xing Y. Guarente L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 47-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). TAFII60 is a member of the transcription factor IID complex that binds to core promoters in mRNA-encoding genes (31Poon D. Weil P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15325-15328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is also one of many proteins in the SAGA complex (32Sterner D.E. Grant P.A. Roberts S.M. Duggan L.J. Belotsterkovskaya R. Pacella L.A. Winston F. Workman J. Berger S.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 86-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that while many TAFs are not required for the expression (33Walker S.S. Reese J.C. Apone L.M. Green M.R. Nature. 1996; 383: 185-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 34Moqtaderi Z. Bai Y. Poon D. Weil P.A. Struhl K. Nature. 1996; 383: 188-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) of most genes, recent evidence indicates that TAFII60 is one of a few “histone-like” TAFs that is essential for the expression of most genes (35Michel B. Komarnitsky P. Buratowski S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 663-673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Sug2p, as mentioned in the introduction, is a component of the 19 S proteasome regulatory particle and is also an essential gene in yeast (11Russell S.J. Sathyanarayana U.G. Johnston S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32810-32817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 13Glickman M.H. Rubin D.M. Fried V.A. Finley D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3149-3162Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Apl1p is thought to be a member of a clathrin-associated protein complex (36Kirchhausen T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6089-6090Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Of these proteins, Hap5p and TAFII60 are transcription factors, and Sug2p has been implicated genetically as being involved in Gal4p-mediated transcription (15Swaffield J.C. Bromberg J. Johnston S.A. Nature. 1992; 357: 698-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). There is no obvious connection between Apl1p and transcription. These interactions appear to be specific. As mentioned previously, growth was not supported by SOS-Gal4 AD and the Myr-repressor dimerization domain (Fig. 1). Furthermore, Hap5p did not bind to SOS itself or a fusion of SOS to the leucine zipper from c-Jun (Fig.3). Sug2p also did not bind the SOS parent protein (Fig. 3). The Gal4 AD is displayed as a dimer in the context of native Gal4p (4Carey M. Kakidani H. Leatherwood J. Mostashari F. Ptashne M. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 209: 423-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), and hSOSp is not known to dimerize"
https://openalex.org/W1994293323,"The events at the earliest stage of adipocyte differentiation are yet to be fully elucidated. Previously, we cloned the genes that are induced at the beginning of the differentiation of mouse 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cells. We found that the gene expression of regulators of G protein signaling-2 (RGS2) rapidly increased after the addition of inducers and decreased at 3–12 h. The expression pattern of RGS2 mRNAs differed among growth-arrested and proliferating 3T3-L1 cells and NIH-3T3 cells, indicating a specificity for adipogenesis. Here we report that the ectopic expression of RGS2 using a retroviral system in mouse NIH-3T3 cells promotes adipogenesis only in the presence of BRL49653, which is a ligand for the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ). These results strongly suggest that RGS2 play a crucial role in the program of adipocyte differentiation and may contribute to the function of PPARγ.

Nature. 2000; 404: 635-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (3595) Google Scholar). Therefore, greater insight into the molecular basis of obesity is required (5Friedman J.M. Nature. 2000; 404: 632-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar).The differentiation of adipocytes has been relatively well characterized, and several transcription factors have been identified as master regulators for the process (6Brun R.P. Kim J.B. Hu E. Altiok S. Spiegelman B.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 826-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 7Rosen E.D. Walkey C.J. Puigserver P. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1293-1307PubMed Google Scholar). Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ)1 is a specific transcription factor active during adipogenesis. Indeed, a mouse fibroblast cell line, NIH-3T3, stably infected with PPARγ expression vector differentiated into adipocytes (6Brun R.P. Kim J.B. Hu E. Altiok S. Spiegelman B.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 826-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 7Rosen E.D. Walkey C.J. Puigserver P. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1293-1307PubMed Google Scholar, 8Mandrup S. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5367-5370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). The CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) family also are identified as master regulators, and the ectopic expression of C/EBPα or C/EBPβ induces PPARγ expression and adipogenesis (9Schwarz E.J. Reginato M.J. Shao D. Krakow S.L. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1552-1561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). C/EBPβ is known to be an activator for C/EBPα, and the expression of C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ is followed by that of C/EBPα (6Brun R.P. Kim J.B. Hu E. Altiok S. Spiegelman B.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 826-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in double knockout mice for C/EBPβ and CEBPδ, adipogenesis was inhibited, and the amount of stored fat was reduced, although PPARγ and C/EBPα were expressed normally (10Tanaka T. Yoshida N. Kishimoto T. Akira S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7432-7443Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). These results have indicated that the differentiation is much more complex than previously thought and may have multiple routes.Whereas the middle and late stages of adipogenesis have been well studied, little is known about the earliest step of adipocyte differentiation. Mouse 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cells, which are fibroblastic cells of adipocyte lineage, are widely used for studies on adipocyte differentiation (11Cornelius P. MacDougald O.A. Lane M.D. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1994; 14: 99-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, 12MacDougald O.A. Lane M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 345-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar). Using this cell line, the levels of over 300 cellular proteins were shown to change during the initiation of differentiation, and in many cases, the level of mRNA changed also (13Sadowski H.B. Wheeler T.T. Young D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4722-4731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The proteins differentially expressed during adipocyte development were also summarized and include proteins associated with hormone action and signaling, lipogenesis and lipolysis, and cytoskeletal and extracellular structures, as well as secreted proteins (11Cornelius P. MacDougald O.A. Lane M.D. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1994; 14: 99-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Thus, numerous uncharacterized cDNAs that are differentially expressed during the conversion of adipocytes have been cloned (14Chapman A.B. Knight D.M. Dieckmann B.S. Ringold G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 15548-15555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Doglio A. Dani C. Grimaldi P. Ailhaud G. Biochem.

However, the expression of these cDNAs/proteins alone cannot explain the triggering of adipocyte differentiation.Previously we isolated the regulator of G protein signaling-2 (RGS2) as the product of a gene that was strongly expressed at the beginning of adipocyte differentiation (17Imagawa M. Tsuchiya T. Nishihara T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 299-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). RGS proteins are known to be negative regulators of G protein-dependent signaling, stimulating hydrolysis of the GTP bound to the activated Gα subunits (18Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3871-3874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Although the RGS gene family consists of more than 20 members, not one has yet been reported to be directly involved in adipocyte differentiation. In our previous report, RGS2 was induced only in growth-arrested cells but not in proliferating cells, indicating that this elevation is specific to the differentiation (17Imagawa M. Tsuchiya T. Nishihara T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 299-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). These finding prompted us to further characterize the function of RGS2 during adipocyte differentiation. Here we report that the ectopic expression of RGS2 stimulates the adipogenesis of a fibroblastic cell line, mouse NIH-3T3, only in the presence of the ligand for PPARγ and that RGS2 seems to have a crucial role in adipogenesis.DISCUSSIONDuring the adipocyte differentiation, C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ were expressed at a relatively early stage and induced the PPARγ as well as the C/EBPα gene (8Mandrup S. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5367-5370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 9Schwarz E.J. Reginato M.J. Shao D. Krakow S.L. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell.

Classon M. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 168-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). For the induction, cyclic AMP and glucocorticoid are known to be primary inducers (20Yeh W.-C. Cao Z. Classon M. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 168-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). However, the earliest step in the differentiation of adipocytes is still not clear, although the activation of CREB (cAMP-response element-binding protein) is necessary and sufficient to induce adipogenesis (21Reusch J.B. Colton L.A. Klemn D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1008-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). PPARγ expression is sufficient for the adipocyte differentiation, whereas double knockout mice for C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ expressed PPARγ but did not store fat (10Tanaka T. Yoshida N. Kishimoto T. Akira S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7432-7443Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). Thus, it seems that the process for the differentiation to adipocyte is quite complex.We previously isolated the genes induced at the earliest stage of the differentiation (17Imagawa M. Tsuchiya T. Nishihara T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 299-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). RGS2 was particularly strongly expressed after the addition of inducers. This induction was stage-specific, occurring in the confluent cells but not the proliferating cells, indicating that the expression of RGS2 is closely related to the differentiation. More than 20 genes are known to be part of the RGS family (18Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3871-3874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 22Siderovski D.P. Hessel A. Chung S. Mak T.W. Tyers M. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 211-212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 23Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1269-1272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). The expression levels of RGS2, RGS5, and RGS16 were determined by PCR. Although these experiments were semiquantitative, induction of RGS2 expression was observed. On the other hand, the levels of RGS5 and RGS16 were not changed (data not shown). Moreover, the localization of these RGSs was determined by transfection of green fluorescent protein-fused RGS constructs. RGS2 was partially localized to the nucleus, whereas RGS5 and RGS16 were found in the cytosolic compartment (data not shown). The localization of RGS2 to the nucleus was reported quite recently (24Heximer S.P. Lim H. Bernard J.L. Blumer K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14195-14203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 25Song L. Zmijewski J.W. Jope R.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 102-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). These results strongly indicate that RGS2 has an important and specific function during adipocyte differentiation.To further analyze the role of RGS2, we introduced an RGS2 expression vector into mouse NIH-3T3 cells, fibroblastic cells that do not differentiate into adipocytes in the presence of inducers. The resultant stable transformant did not differentiate upon the addition of a mixture of Mix, Dex, Ins, and FBS. However, upon the addition of this mixture plus BRL49653, which is a thiazolidine derivative and a ligand for PPARγ, RGS2-expressing stable transformants started to differentiate into adipocytes and stored oil droplets. The expression of adipogenic markers such as PPARγ, SREBP-1, LPL, and aP2 was also observed. However, the levels of the three C/EBP members (C/EBPα, β, and δ) were unchanged. These results strongly suggest that the overexpression of RGS2 is sufficient for the differentiation to adipocyte through the PPARγ route but has no effect on the expression of C/EBP.What is the role of BRL49653? One possibility is that the low-level expression of PPARγ in NIH-3T3 cells activates genes in the presence of the ligand, and this effect was enhanced by the overexpression of RGS2. Alternatively, BRL49653 was utilized as a ligand for the unidentified receptor. It is clear that RGS2 has a critical role in the differentiation, although the details are still unknown.RGS2 was reported recently to reduce T-cell proliferation as well as control synaptic development (26Oliveira-dos-Santos A.J. Matsumoto G. Snow B.E. Bai D. Houston F.P. Whishaw I.Q. Mariathasan S. Sasaki T. Wakeham A. Ohashi P.S. Roder J.C. Barnes C.A. Siderovski D.P. Penninger J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12272-12277Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). These results also indicated a role for RGS2 in the control of differentiation and proliferation. The real function of RGS2 during adipogenesis is still unknown, but the signals downstream of RGS2 are now under investigation at both the gene and protein expression levels. Adipose tissue, the main organ for energy storage, secretes many kinds of cytokines such as leptin and resistin (1Spiegelman B.M. Flier J.S. Cell. 1996; 87: 338-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1153) Google Scholar, 2Steppan C.M. Bailey S.T. Bhat S. Brown E.J. Banerjee R.R. Wright C.M. Patel H.R. Ahima R.S.

Chem. 2001; 276: 11252-11256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). Too much fat, however, causes severe diseases including diabetes and heart failure (4Kopelman P.G. Nature. 2000; 404: 635-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (3595) Google Scholar). Therefore, greater insight into the molecular basis of obesity is required (5Friedman J.M. Nature. 2000; 404: 632-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). The differentiation of adipocytes has been relatively well characterized, and several transcription factors have been identified as master regulators for the process (6Brun R.P. Kim J.B. Hu E. Altiok S. Spiegelman B.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 826-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 7Rosen E.D. Walkey C.J. Puigserver P. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1293-1307PubMed Google Scholar). Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ)1 is a specific transcription factor active during adipogenesis. Indeed, a mouse fibroblast cell line, NIH-3T3, stably infected with PPARγ expression vector differentiated into adipocytes (6Brun R.P. Kim J.B. Hu E. Altiok S. Spiegelman B.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 826-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 7Rosen E.D. Walkey C.J. Puigserver P. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1293-1307PubMed Google Scholar, 8Mandrup S. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5367-5370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). The CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) family also are identified as master regulators, and the ectopic expression of C/EBPα or C/EBPβ induces PPARγ expression and adipogenesis (9Schwarz E.J. Reginato M.J. Shao D. Krakow S.L. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1552-1561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). C/EBPβ is known to be an activator for C/EBPα, and the expression of C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ is followed by that of C/EBPα (6Brun R.P. Kim J.B. Hu E. Altiok S. Spiegelman B.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 826-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in double knockout mice for C/EBPβ and CEBPδ, adipogenesis was inhibited, and the amount of stored fat was reduced, although PPARγ and C/EBPα were expressed normally (10Tanaka T. Yoshida N. Kishimoto T. Akira S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7432-7443Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). These results have indicated that the differentiation is much more complex than previously thought and may have multiple routes. Whereas the middle and late stages of adipogenesis have been well studied, little is known about the earliest step of adipocyte differentiation. Mouse 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cells, which are fibroblastic cells of adipocyte lineage, are widely used for studies on adipocyte differentiation (11Cornelius P. MacDougald O.A. Lane M.D. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1994; 14: 99-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, 12MacDougald O.A. Lane M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 345-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar). Using this cell line, the levels of over 300 cellular proteins were shown to change during the initiation of differentiation, and in many cases, the level of mRNA changed also (13Sadowski H.B. Wheeler T.T. Young D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4722-4731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The proteins differentially expressed during adipocyte development were also summarized and include proteins associated with hormone action and signaling, lipogenesis and lipolysis, and cytoskeletal and extracellular structures, as well as secreted proteins (11Cornelius P. MacDougald O.A. Lane M.D. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1994; 14: 99-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Thus, numerous uncharacterized cDNAs that are differentially expressed during the conversion of adipocytes have been cloned (14Chapman A.B. Knight D.M. Dieckmann B.S. Ringold G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 15548-15555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Doglio A. Dani C. Grimaldi P. Ailhaud G. Biochem.

https://openalex.org/W1994976004,"Although several cardiac-specific transcription factors have been shown to play vital roles in various steps during the heart formation, the precise mechanism of the early stage of cardiogenesis has yet to be elucidated. By differential display technique, we tried to identify molecules that are expressed earlier than cardiac transcription factors such as CSX/NKX2-5 and GATA-4 and are involved in cardiomyocyte differentiation using the P19CL6 cell line, which efficiently differentiates into cardiomyocytes when treated with dimethyl sulfoxide. We isolated a novel gene designatedMidori. Its deduced amino acid sequence contained an ATP/GTP-binding site, Ig-like domain, and Kringle-like domain. Northern blot analysis revealed that expression of Midori was restricted to the fetal and adult heart and adult skeletal muscle in mice. In whole mount in situ hybridization,Midori was expressed in cardiac crescent and developing heart but not in somites. The MIDORI protein was localized in the nucleus and overexpression of Midori induced expression of endogenous Midori itself, suggesting that MIDORI may act as a transcriptional regulator. Permanent P19CL6 cell lines overexpressing Midori more efficiently differentiated into cardiomyocytes than did parental cells, whereas those overexpressing the antisense Midori less efficiently differentiated. These results suggest that Midori may promote the differentiation of P19CL6 into cardiomyocytes.

These results suggest that Midori may promote the differentiation of P19CL6 into cardiomyocytes. myosin heavy chain myosin light chain 2v days postcoitus digoxigenin 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid hemagglutinin Recent genetic studies have demonstrated that several heart-enriched transcription factors play vital roles in various developmental steps during the formation of the heart. Among them, CSX/NKX2-5, GATA-4, and MEF2C have been well characterized and used as early lineage-specific molecular markers of cardiac development.Csx/Nkx2-5 is a murine cardiac homeobox gene that was originally identified as a potential vertebrate homolog ofDrosophila tinman (1Komuro I. Izumo S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8145-8149Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 2Lints T.J. Parsons L.M. Hartley L. Lyons I. Harvey R.P. Genes Dev. 1993; 119: 419-431Google Scholar). Csx/Nkx2-5 is predominantly expressed in the heart and in cardiac progenitor cells from the early developmental stage. The heart does not form at all in the tinman mutant of Drosophila (3Bodmer R. Development. 1993; 118: 719-729Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the development of the heart stops at the looping stage inCsx/Nkx2-5 knockout mice (4Lyons I. Parsons L.M. Hartley L. Li R. Andrews J.E. Robb L. Harvey R.P. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1654-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar). In humans, it has been reported that patients with familial atrial septal defect or other congenital heart diseases have point mutations in the humanCSX/NKX2-5 gene in one allele (5Schott J.J. Benson D.W. Basson C.T. Pease W. Silberbach G.M. Moak J.P. Maron B.J. Seidman C.E. Seidman J.G. Science. 1998; 281: 108-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar, 6Benson D.W. Silberbach G.M.

Both of them started to be expressed in the precardiac mesoderm almost simultaneously withCsx/Nkx2-5. A zinc finger transcription factor, GATA-4 has been reported to be necessary for differentiation of the pluripotent P19 embryonal carcinoma cells into beating cardiomyocytes. In this system, the inhibition of Gata-4 expression by antisense transcripts interferes with the differentiation of the P19 cells at the precardiac (cardioblast) stage (11Grepin C. Robitaille L. Antakly T. Nemer M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4095-4102Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In contrast, the ectopic expression of Gata-4 in P19 cells accelerates cardiogenesis (12Grepin C. Nemer G. Nemer M. Development. 1997; 124: 2387-2395Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In vivo bilateral cardiac primordia fail to fuse at the ventral midline in Gata-4 −/− mice (8Kuo C.T. Morrisey E.E.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1061-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar). MEF2C is a member of MADS-box transcription factors, and targeted disruption ofMef2c results in right ventricular dysplasia (10Lin Q. Schwarz J. Bucana C. Olson E.N. Science. 1997; 276: 1404-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). Thus, Drosophila TINMAN, CSX/NKX2-5, GATA-4, and MEF2C are critical regulators of cardiac development and are useful molecular markers for examining effects of inductive signals from other tissues or germ layers. Although characteristics and functions of these cardiac transcription factors have been well studied, the precise molecular mechanism of the earlier stage of cardiac development, i.e. the mechanism by which these transcription factors themselves are regulated, remains largely unknown at present. It has recently been reported that some growth factors play an important role in initial induction of cardiac differentiation. For example, decapentaplegic(dpp) and bone morphogenetic proteins, which are the members of the transforming growth factor-β superfamily, have been shown to be important candidates that regulate expression of some cardiac-enriched transcription factors such as TINMAN, CSX/NKX2-5, and GATA-4 and induce cardiomyocyte differentiation. We previously demonstrated that bone morphogenetic proteins are indispensable for cardiomyocyte differentiation and that bone morphogenetic proteins induce cardiomyocyte differentiation through cardiac transcription factors CSX/NKX2-5 and GATA-4 (13Monzen K. Shiojima I. Hiroi Y. Kudoh S. Oka T. Takimoto E. Hayashi D. Hosoda T. Habara-Ohkubo A. Nakaoka T. Fujita T. Yazaki Y. Komuro I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7096-7105Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). As well as bone morphogenetic proteins/dpp, other growth factors such as Wnt/wingless (14Wu X. Golden K. Bodmer R. Dev. Biol. 1995; 169: 619-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) and fibroblast growth factors (15Sugi Y. Sasse J. Lough J. Dev. Biol. 1993; 157: 28-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 16Mima T. Ueno H. Fischman D.A. Williams L.T. Mikawa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1996; 178: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) have been reported to be essential for normal cardiac development. However, the precise molecular cascades from these growth factors to cardiac-specific genes needed for cardiac specification have yet to be elucidated. From this respect, we tried to identify molecules that are expressed in precardiac cells earlier than cardiac-specific transcription factors and to clarify the molecular mechanism by which induction of cardiac differentiation is controlled. In the investigation of the molecular mechanisms of cardiomyocyte differentiation, in vitro culture systems present a great advantage in contrast to the complexity in analyzing them in thein vivo situation. In the present study, we used the P19CL6in vitro cardiomyocyte differentiation system. P19CL6 is a clonal derivative isolated from murine P19 embryonal carcinoma cells by the limiting dilution method (18Habara-Ohkubo A. Cell Struct. Funct. 1996; 21: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Unlike P19 cells (19McBurney M.W. Jones-Villeneuve E.M. Edwards M.K. Anderson P.J. Nature. 1982; 299: 165-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 20Edwards M.K. Harris J.F. McBurney M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 2280-2286Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), whose use is limited because of their quite low efficiency of differentiation into cardiomyocytes, this CL6 subline efficiently (more than 80%) differentiates into beating cardiomyocytes with adherent conditions when it is treated with 1% dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) (13Monzen K. Shiojima I. Hiroi Y. Kudoh S. Oka T. Takimoto E. Hayashi D. Hosoda T. Habara-Ohkubo A. Nakaoka T. Fujita T. Yazaki Y. Komuro I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7096-7105Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 18Habara-Ohkubo A. Cell Struct. Funct. 1996; 21: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Expression of cardiac-specific transcription factors such as CSX/NKX2-5, GATA-4, and MEF2C and contractile protein genes such as myosin heavy chain (MHC)1 and myosin light chain 2v (MLC2v) are detected from day 6 and from day 10, respectively (13Monzen K. Shiojima I. Hiroi Y. Kudoh S. Oka T. Takimoto E. Hayashi D. Hosoda T. Habara-Ohkubo A. Nakaoka T. Fujita T. Yazaki Y. Komuro I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7096-7105Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), whereas skeletal muscle-specific transcripts such as myogenin and MyoD are not detected throughout the differentiation of the cells (18Habara-Ohkubo A. Cell Struct. Funct. 1996; 21: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), suggesting that myocytic differentiation of this cell line induced by Me2SO treatment is purely cardiogenic. On the other hand, P19CL6 cells can differentiate into neurons and other neuroectodermal derivatives by treatment with retinoic acid (18Habara-Ohkubo A. Cell Struct. Funct. 1996; 21: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Because these observations suggest that this subline of P19 is not committed into cardiac precursor cells nor even into mesoderm before induction of differentiation, P19CL6 is a useful model for studying the molecular mechanism by which the very early stage of cardiac specification is induced. Using the differential display technique in this P19CL6 system, we isolated a novel gene named Midori, representingM yocyticinduction/differentiationoriginator, in the present study. Expression ofMidori was restricted to the developing heart from the very early stage of cardiogenesis. The MIDORI protein was localized in the nucleus, and overexpression of Midori induced expression of endogenous Midori itself, suggesting that MIDORI may act as a transcriptional regulator. Overexpression of Midorienhanced the differentiation ability of P19CL6 cells into cardiomyocytes, whereas inhibition of Midori suppressed it. These results suggest that Midori may promote the differentiation of P19CL6 into cardiomyocytes. P19CL6 cells were cultured essentially as described previously (18Habara-Ohkubo A. Cell Struct. Funct. 1996; 21: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were grown in a 100-mm tissue culture dish under adherent conditions with α-minimal essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (JRH Bioscience), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) (growth medium) and were maintained in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. To induce differentiation under adherent conditions, P19CL6 cells were plated at a density of 3.7 × 105 cells in a 60-mm tissue culture dish with the growth medium containing 1% Me2SO (differentiation medium). The medium was changed every 2 days. Days of differentiation were numbered consecutively with the 1st day of the Me2SO treatment designated as day 0. Total RNA was extracted by the acid guanidine method (RNA Zol B, TEL-TEST, Inc.), and Northern blot analysis was performed with 20 μg of total RNA as follows. Total RNA was subjected to 1% agarose/formaldehyde gel electrophoresis and subsequently transferred onto a Hybond-N membrane filter (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Hybridization was carried out in 50% formamide, 5× saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA, 5× Denhardt's solution, 5% dextran sulfate, and 0.5% SDS at 42 °C overnight. The probe was labeled with [32P]dCTP by random priming (Takara). Differential display was performed with an RNAmap kit (Genhunter Co.) as described previously (21Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4707) Google Scholar, 22Bush E.W. Taft C.S. Meixell G.E. Perryman M.B. J. Biol.

The plasmids were digested with EcoRI and electrophoresed on a 2.0% agarose gel. The inserts were extracted from the gel (QIAEX II Gel Extraction Kit, Qiagen) and labeled as described above for Northern blot analysis. If the same expression pattern was obtained in the Northern blot on P19CL6, Northern blot analysis on fetal (17.5 days postcoitus (dpc)) and adult (8 weeks old) mice was performed. About 20 μg of poly(A)+ RNA of P19CL6 day 6 was separated from 1 mg of total RNA after selecting twice through oligo(dT)-cellulose type 7 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and 5 μg of poly(A)+ RNA was used to synthesize a cDNA library using a ZAP-cDNA synthesis kit and ZAP-cDNA Gigapack III Gold cloning kit (Stratagene). This manipulation yielded a library consisting of 2.88 × 106 independent clones. Using the cDNA fragment obtained from the differential screening,Midori was isolated from the P19CL6 day 6 cDNA library prepared as described above. Plasmids were excised from phage vectorsin vivo by ExAssist helper phage and were subjected to sequencing with Big Dye Terminator and ABI PRISM 310 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using ordinary sequencing primers and four custom-synthesized primers as follows: P1, 5′-TACTCCATGCCAGGTCTCAAG-3′; P2, 5′-GATGGAGAGGCAAACAAGGCT-3′; P3, 5′-TGTTCTGGATCTTGCATCCCT-3′; P5, 5′-GACTCAAGCCAGTTGAATGCC-3′. We also used a mouse skeletal muscle 5′-STRETCH PLUS cDNA library (CLONTECH) to get the full length of Midori. Phage DNA was purified from isolated clones (Lambda DNA miniprep, Qiagen), digested withEcoRI, and subcloned into pBluescript II SK+(Stratagene). The clones were sequenced and analyzed using the BLAST sequence analysis program. Pregnant females of mouse strain ICR were killed by cervical dislocation on 7.5–10.5 dpc. Harvested mouse embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) and treated with 10 μg/ml proteinase K at 37 °C for 3 min. Then samples were incubated with 2 mg/ml glycine, with 0.2% glutaraldehyde, 4% paraformaldehyde, and with 0.1% sodium borohydride subsequently. Digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled cRNA probes were synthesized with in vitro transcription using a DIG RNA labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). A part of the cDNA of Midori (not shown) was used for the template of the antisense and sense ribonucleotide probes, and that of MLC2v (not shown) was used for the template of the antisense probe as a positive control for hybridization. Hybridization was done with 2 μg/ml DIG-labeled cRNA probes in 50% formamide, 750 mm sodium chloride, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm PIPES, 1% SDS, 100 μg/ml yeast tRNA, 0.05% heparin, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin at 63 °C overnight. After washing with a low concentration of salt, the RNase reaction was carried out with 100 μg/ml RNase A and 100 units/ml RNase T1 in 0.5 m sodium acetate, 10 mm PIPES, and 0.05% Tween 20. Samples were washed and incubated with a 2000× dilution of anti-DIG alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 4 °C overnight. Then mRNA-cRNA hybrids were detected by staining with BM Purple alkaline phosphatase substrate (Boehringer Mannheim) at room temperature for 1 h for the MLC2v probe and for 2–3 h for the others. Two kinds of epitope-tagged cDNAs ofMidori in the expression vector were constructed. The HA-pcDNA3 vector was digested and ligated with the open reading frame of Midori to make a HA-tagged MIDORI protein with a 6-amino acid deletion of MIDORI at the amino terminus. Similarly, pcDNA3.1(−)/Myc-His B vector (Invitrogen) was used to make Myc-tagged MIDORI protein with a 1-amino acid deletion of MIDORI at the carboxyl terminus. COS cells were plated at a density of 4 × 104 cells in a 35-mm tissue culture dish on the day before transfection. The constructed plasmids were transiently transfected into COS cells by the calcium phosphate method and stained immunochemically on the next day. The cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde, phosphate-buffered saline and subsequently incubated with 50 mm ammonium chloride, 0.2% Triton X-100, and 10% fetal bovine serum. Corresponding to the transfected plasmids, either 500× diluted rabbit anti-HA polyclonal antibody or 20× diluted mouse anti-Myc antibody was mounted as the first antibody. After washing, either 200× diluted fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody or 50× diluted rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody was mounted as the second antibody. Midori cDNA of either sense or antisense orientation was subcloned into pEFSAneo, which harbors the human elongation factor 1-α promoter and a neomycin resistance gene, and the resultant genes were transfected into P19CL6 cells by the calcium phosphate method, respectively. Stable transfectants were selected with 600 μg of neomycin (G418)/ml. Immunostaining with MF20, a monoclonal antibody against a sarcomeric MHC, was performed on day 8 of differentiation by using anti-mouse immunoglobulin G conjugated with tetramethyl rhodamine isothiocyanate as the secondary antibody. We chose day 8 because thereafter most cells differentiate into cardiomyocytes and are MF20-positive in both P19CL6 and theMidori-overexpressing cell lines, and therefore it might be hard to show the difference among these cell lines. Total protein of the cell lines on day 14.5 of differentiation was extracted using cell lysis buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 25 mm sodium chloride, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, and 10 nm okadaic acid. The equal volume of cell lysate was subjected to 5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subsequently transferred onto a Hybond-ECL membrane filter (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). MF20 and anti-mouse immunoglobulin G conjugated with horseradish peroxidase were incubated as the first and the second antibody, respectively, in Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.6) containing 0.1% Tween 20. After washing in this buffer, the filter was soaked in ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 45 s, and subsequently the autoradiogram was developed after a 30-s exposure. To isolate novel molecules expressed in the very early stage of cardiac development, we performed the differential display method using the P19CL6 cell line as an in vitro model for cardiomyocyte differentiation. Because expression of cardiac transcription factors such as CSX/NKX2-5, GATA-4, and MEF2C are detected on day 6 (6 days after the initiation of Me2SO treatment) in P19CL6 cells (13Monzen K. Shiojima I. Hiroi Y. Kudoh S. Oka T. Takimoto E. Hayashi D. Hosoda T. Habara-Ohkubo A. Nakaoka T. Fujita T. Yazaki Y. Komuro I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7096-7105Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), we compared mRNA extracted from the differentiating cells of day 6 and from the undifferentiated cells of day 0 (i.e.before the Me2SO treatment). We obtained several differentially expressed cDNA fragments that were detected on day 6 but not on day 0. These cDNA fragments were therefore thought to represent parts of genes whose expression was induced in the early stage of differentiation. Among them, a fragment primarily amplified using the prepared primers in the RNAmap kit, AP5 and T12MA, was denoted as 5A1 (Fig. 1). Northern blot analysis using the 5A1 fragment as a cDNA probe revealed that the transcripts represented by 5A1 were detected as a single ∼6.4-kilobase pair band abundantly on days 4 and 6 and faintly thereafter but not at all on day 0 (Fig. 2 A), indicating that the mRNA expression was induced by the treatment with Me2SO and preceded expression of cardiac transcription factors such as CSX/NKX2-5, GATA-4, and MEF2C. Such temporal expression patterns imply the possibility that this molecule represented by the 5A1 fragment might play an important role in cardiomyocyte differentiation of P19CL6 at the relatively early developmental stage. We next examined tissue distribution of this mRNA using 20 μg of total RNAs from various tissues of fetal and adult mice. Northern blot analysis revealed that the expression was restricted to the heart of fetal mice and to the heart and skeletal muscle of adult mice among the various organs examined, suggesting that expression of this gene was myocyte-specific (Fig. 2, B and C). We screened the originally prepared cDNA library of P19CL6 day 6 and a random and oligo(dT)-primed cDNA library of murine skeletal muscle using the subcloned band as a probe and obtained a corresponding cDNA ∼6.4 kilobases in length. It contained the Kozak consensus sequence (26Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 887-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar) in the 5′-region and ∼5-kilobase pair open reading frame. A polyadenylation signal was situated at 32 base pairs upstream of the poly(A) tract. Two Ig-like C2-type domains, several nuclear localization signals, a proline/alanine-rich region, an ATP/GTP-binding site, and a Kringle-like domain were present in the deduced amino acid sequence (Fig.3). Considering these results and its possible functions as described below, we designated this novel gene Midori representingM yocyticinduction/differentiationoriginator.Figure 2Midori expression in P19CL6 and in mice. A, Northern blot analysis using the 5A1 fragment as a probe revealed that the single ∼6.4-kilobase pair band was not detected in undifferentiated P19CL6 but was present abundantly on day 4 and day 6 of differentiation and was weakly detected thereafter. We designated the gene represented by 5A1 as Midori(arrow). B and C, the expression ofMidori in vivo was restricted to the heart of fetal mice (B) and to the heart and skeletal muscle of adult mice (C) among the many organs examined.

Murine embryos at 7.5, 8.5, 9.5, and 10.5 dpc were prepared and hybridized with Midori sense and antisense and MLC2v antisense ribonucleotide probes. The probes were synthesized using DIG-labeled UTP. The Midori expression was first detected in the cardiac crescent at 7.5 dpc when the developing heart became visible and continued through 10.5 dpc. The expression ofMidori was localized within the heart at least until 10.5 dpc as well as that of MLC2v used as a positive control (Fig.4). Although Northern blot analysis revealed that Midori was abundantly expressed in the skeletal muscle of adult mice (Fig. 2 C), the expression was not detected in somites where differentiation into skeletal muscle took place. These results suggest that Midori is expressed specifically in the heart from the very early stage of cardiac development also in vivo. The existence of a nuclear localization signal in the amino acid sequence of MIDORI protein (Fig. 3) suggested its localization in the nucleus. To examine the intracellular localization of MIDORI, HA- and Myc-tagged MIDORI were separately transfected into COS cells. Immunochemical staining with both anti-HA and anti-Myc antibodies revealed that the MIDORI protein was expressed only in the nucleus (Fig. 5). To elucidate the role ofMidori in cardiac differentiation, we isolated the stable P19CL6 cells that overexpressed the antisense Midori and examined the differentiation ability of the cells. Three independent neomycin-resistant clones containing the Midori antisense sequence were isolated, and two of them (designated as A1 and A2, Fig.6) were differentiated and analyzed. Expression of the Midori antisense sequence had no effect on the morphology and the proliferative ability of the undifferentiated cells (data not shown). When treated with Me2SO, however, the cell line A1, which expressed antisense transcripts more abundantly than A2 (Fig. 6, large arrowhead), differentiated much less efficiently than A2 and parental P19CL6 cells. In P19CL6 and antisense cell lines, some parts of the cells formed aggregations (Fig.7, A and B,arrowheads) that were not immunostained by MF20 and did not beat at all. More aggregations were observed in A1 than in A2 (Fig.7 A). More MF20-positive beating foci were seen at day 8 in A2 than in A1 (Fig. 7 B, stained in red). In Western blot analysis on day 14.5 of differentiation, a lesser amount of MHC protein was detected in the line A1 than in A2 and P19CL6 (Fig.7 C, arrow). Overall, the antisense cell line contained less MF20-positive areas at day 8 of differentiation and less MHC protein at day 14.5 than did parental P19CL6 cells, suggesting that inhibition of Midori partially blocked cardiomyocyte differentiation of P19CL6 in a dose-dependent manner.Figure 7Morphological and phenotypic changes observed in the differentiated cell lines. Parental P19CL6 and the transfectants overexpressing either antisense or senseMidori transcripts were differentiated with Me2SO. A, on day 11 of differentiation, phase-contrast photomicrographs of live cultures showed that theMidori sense clone (S1) more efficiently differentiated into beating cardiomyocytes than did parental P19CL6 cells, whereas antisense clones (A1 and A2) less efficiently differentiated. Highly aggregated cells (arrowheads) appeared in wild type or more often in the antisense clones and did not beat at all. B, each cell line was double-stained with anti-sarcomeric MHC antibody (MF20) and Hoechst dye on day 8 of differentiation. MF20-positive cells are shown in red. In A1, many more aggregations (arrowheads) were seen than in any other cell lines. In contrast, many more MF20-positive cells were observed in S1 than in parental P19CL6 cells, whereas less cells survived in S1 than in wild type because of the extensive cell death during differentiation.C, Western blot analysis of MHC was performed on day 14.5 of differentiation. The bands corresponding to MHC are indicated by anarrow. The amount of the protein was less in A1 than in P19CL6, whereas more protein was detected in S1 than P19CL6.P, positive control; CL6, P19CL6.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next performed gain-of-function experiments by overexpressing Midori in P19CL6 cells. Five independent neomycin-resistant clones that stably overexpressed Midoriwere isolated, and two of them (designated as S1 and S2, Fig. 6) were differentiated and analyzed. Midori-overexpressing cells did not show any morphological difference with wild-type P19CL6 cells when cultured without Me2SO (data not shown). However, unlike in wild-type P19CL6 cells, mRNA levels of endogenousMidori (Fig. 6, arrow) were more abundant than those of exogenous Midori (Fig. 6, large arrowhead) in the undifferentiated cells, suggesting that expression of Midori was induced by itself. When treated with Me2SO, Midori-overexpressing P19CL6 cells differentiated into cardiomyocytes more efficiently than did wild-type P19CL6. Highly aggregated noncardiomyocytes seen in wild-type or in the antisense cell lines were only weakly detected in theMidori-overexpressing cell lines (Fig. 7 A). Immunocytochemical staining of MHC on day 8 of differentiation (Fig.7 B, stained in red) and Western blot analysis of MHC on day 14.5 (Fig. 7 C, arrow) revealed that the Midori-overexpressing cells more efficiently differentiated into cardiomyocytes than did parental P19CL6 cells, suggesting the potential role of Midori in the induction of cardiomyocyte differentiation. Cardiac-specific transcription factors such as CSX/NKX2-5, GATA-4, and MEF2C have recently been clarified to play important roles in the formation of the heart. These cardiac transcription factors are critical regulators of normal cardiac development and are useful molecular markers to examine effects of inductive signals from other tissues or germ layers. However, little is known about the genetic cascades that induce expression of these transcription factors themselves in the earlier stage of cardiac development. Therefore, we tried to identify transcriptional regulators that exist upstream of these cardiac transcription factors and control their expression using the P19CL6 in vitro culture system and obtained several results as follows. (i) We isolated a novel myocyte-specific geneMidori that was expressed earlier than cardiac transcription factors such as CSX/NKX2-5, GATA-4, and MEF2C in P19CL6 cells. (ii) Expression of Midori was localized in the primitive heart in early embryogenesis and was detected in cardiac and skeletal muscle in the adult mice. (iii) The MIDORI protein was localized in the nucleus and induced by Midori itself. (iv) Overexpression ofMidori enhanced the differentiation of P19CL6 into cardiomyocytes, whereas the blockade of Midori expression inhibited it. The cDNA sequence of Midori revealed that MIDORI contained two Ig-like C2-type domains (Fig. 3,boxed), several nuclear localization signals (Fig. 3,underlined), a proline/alanine-rich region (Fig. 3,dotted-underlined), an ATP/GTP-binding site motif A (Fig. 3,bold), and a Kringle-like domain (Fig. 3,broken-underlined). Transfection experiments using the epitope-tagged cDNA of Midori revealed that the MIDORI protein was localized in the nucleus and that exogenousMidori induced expression of endogenous Midoriitself in undifferentiated P19CL6 cells, suggesting its possible role as a transcriptional regulator. Several transcription factors contain proline-rich regions, which are known to act as transactivation or repression sites (27Venot C. Maratrat M. Dureuil C. Conseiller E. Bracco L. Debussche L.

These domains consist of a heparin- or agonist-binding site and are thought to be essential for receptor dimerization. Hepatocyte growth factor contains domains similar to the Kringle-like domain of MIDORI. This domain is necessary for receptor binding (35Chan A.M. Rubin J.S. Bottaro D.P. Hirschfield D.W. Chedid M.

No other nucleus-localized genes with these motifs have been reported to date, and possible interactions with other transcription factors and the transactivating/repressing ability of this novel gene have yet to be investigated. To elucidate the physiological roles for Midori in cardiomyocyte differentiation, we performed transfection experiments to enhance or inhibit the function of Midori in P19CL6 cells. Stable transfectants overexpressing the Midori antisense cDNA failed to differentiate into cardiomyocytes by the treatment with Me2SO, whereas those overexpressing the sense cDNA more efficiently differentiated into cardiomyocytes than did the wild-type P19CL6 cells. During the process of differentiation, many dead cells were observed in the Midori-overexpressing cell lines, and the nuclei of these cells were condensed and terminal dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL)-positive (data not shown). These findings were also observed in the wild type but to a smaller extent, and only a few cells died in the antisense cell lines (data not shown). The fact that forced expression of Midori did not harm undifferentiated P19CL6 cells nor COS cells and that the surviving cells in the Midori-overexpressing cell lines efficiently differentiated into cardiomyocytes suggest the possibility thatMidori might induce the apoptosis of noncardiomyocytes during the differentiation of P19CL6 cells. Further studies are necessary to prove this hypothesis. Recently another group cloned a part of a potential human homolog ofMidori. The cDNA fragment, designated KIAA1330, was cloned from human brain but was expressed mainly in the heart and skeletal muscle (39Nagase T. Kikuno R. Ishikawa K. Hirosawa M. Ohara O. DNA Res. 2000; 7: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) as we showed in mice (see Fig. 2 C). The genomic locus was assigned to human chromosome 15 (39). KIAA1330 contains an ∼2.7-kilobase pair open reading frame corresponding to the 3′-part of the open reading frame ofMidori. In the 3′ part of the open reading frame, the amino acid sequence of MIDORI is 74% identical and 79% homologous to that of KIAA1330. However, no information about the function of this gene is available at present. Here we have first demonstrated potential important roles of this novel gene in cardiomyocyte differentiation. Further investigation of the precise molecular functions of MIDORI will provide new insights into the understanding of the complicated mechanisms of heart development."

Kiss T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). The RNase MRP ribonucleoprotein particle has originally been identified by virtue of its capacity to cleave a mitochondrial RNA in vitro to generate RNA primers for mitochondrial DNA replication (2Chang D.D. Clayton D.A. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 409-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). However, most of the RNase MRP complex has been shown to reside in the nucleolus (3Chang D.D. Clayton D.A.

There, it functions in the formation of the short form of the 5.8 S rRNA (5.8 S(S)) by cleaving at site A3 in the internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) of precursor rRNA (5Chu S. Archer R.H.

In many different aspects, the RNase MRP complex is related to the RNase P complex, a ribonucleoprotein complex required for the removal of the 5′ end of the precursor tRNAs. Both function as site-specific endonucleases, contain an RNA component that has been proposed to adopt a similar cage-shaped structure, share several protein subunits, and are predominantly localized in the nucleolus (reviewed in Ref. 9van Eenennaam H. Jarrous N. van Venrooij W.J. Pruijn G.J.M. IUBMB Life. 2000; 49: 265-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The biological importance of the RNase MRP function is substantiated by the recent observations that mutations in the gene encoding the RNA component of the human RNase MRP complex cause an autosomal recessive disease called cartilage-hair hypoplasia (10Ridanpaa M. van Eenennaam H.

Snm1p has been reported to be associated specifically with the RNase MRP complex, whereas the Rpr2p protein is only bound to the RNase P complex (21Schmitt M.E. Clayton D.A.

Although homologues for several of the yeast proteins are found in human cells (Pop1p, Pop4p, Pop7p/Rpp2p, Rpp1p), until now no homologues have been identified for Snm1p, Pop3p, Pop5p, Pop6p, Pop8p, and Rpr2p (reviewed in Ref. 9van Eenennaam H. Jarrous N. van Venrooij W.J. Pruijn G.J.M. IUBMB Life. 2000; 49: 265-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In this report we describe the identification, cDNA cloning, and characterization of the human Pop5 protein, which, like all human protein subunits identified so far, is associated with both RNase MRP and RNase P RNAs. Data base searches were performed using the BLASTN 2.0.10 program (27Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59759) Google Scholar). The accession numbers of the human expressed sequence tags (ESTs)1 are AF117232, XM-012126, NM-015918, and AF070660. The accession numbers for the overlapping mouse ESTs are BF121181 and BF583365, for rat ESTs BF567090and AW918527, for cow BF075658, and for Drosophila melanogaster AAF49372. The following oligonucleotides (based on the human EST sequence) were used to isolate the open reading frame of hPop5 by a PCR-based approach: pop51 (5′-GCG-GAT-CCC-TCG-AGA-TGG-TGC-GGT-TCA-AGC-ACA-GG-3′) and pop52 (5′-GCG-GAT-CCC-CCG-GGT-CAT-CTA-GAC-TCC-ATT-GCT-TCT-GCA-GCC-TCC-TC-3′). The polymerase chain reaction was performed with 200 ng of denatured DNA from λgt11 human placenta (CLONTECH) and teratocarcinoma cDNA libraries as starting material (28Sillekens P.T. Habets W.J. Beijer R.P. van Venrooij W.J. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3841-3848Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The amplified fragments were ligated in the PCR-II-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced using the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method. To raise a polyclonal anti-hPop5 antiserum, the hPop5 protein was expressed as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase (GST) in E. coli and purified by glutathione affinity chromatography (29Frangioni J.V. Neel B.G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). Rabbits were immunized with this material following standard procedures (30Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). For each injection 200 µg of GST-hPop5 was used. To obtain anti-hPop5 and anti-GST antibodies, two affinity columns were prepared by immobilizing either 1.25 mg of GST-hPop5 or 4.8 mg of GST protein to 1.5 g of CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Rabbit serum raised against GST-hPop5 was first depleted of anti-GST activity by chromatography on the GST affinity column equilibrated with Buffer A (350 mm NaCl, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 1× PBS). Anti-GST antibodies were eluted from the column using Buffer B (0.1m glycine-HCl, pH 2.5, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.05% Nonidet P-40). This procedure was repeated until no detectable anti-GST activity could be measured in the flow-through using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay methods. Subsequently, the flow-through was loaded on the GST-hPop5 column in Buffer A. After washing with Buffer A, the anti-hPop5 antibodies were eluted with Buffer B. For Western blot analysis, the rabbit anti-hPop5 and pre-immune sera were used in a 500-fold dilution, whereas affinity-purified anti-GST and anti-hPop5 antibodies were used in a 100-fold dilution. Detection was performed using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Dako Immunoglobulins) as secondary antibody and visualization by chemiluminescence. Extracts of HEp-2 cells were prepared by resuspending cell pellets in buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm dithioerythritol, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.05% Nonidet P-40) and lysis by sonication using a Branson microtip (three times for 20 s each). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (12,000 ×g, 15 min) and supernatants were used directly for immunoprecipitations. A monoclonal anti-vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) tag antibody (Roche), an anti-55K (31Pluk H. Soffner J. Luhrmann R. van Venrooij W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 488-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) antiserum, a patient anti-Th/To serum, the rabbit anti-hPop5 antiserum, an anti-hPop4 antiserum (19van Eenennaam H. Pruijn G.J. van Venrooij W.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2465-2472Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and pre-immune serum from the rabbit immunized with hPop5 protein were coupled to protein A-agarose beads (Biozym) in IPP500 (500 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.05% Nonidet P-40) by incubation for 1 h at room temperature. Beads were washed twice with IPP500 and once with IPP150 (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.05% Nonidet P-40). For each immunoprecipitation a cell extract was incubated with the antibody-coupled beads for 2 h at 4 °C. Subsequently, beads were washed three times with IPP150. To analyze co-precipitating RNAs, the RNA was isolated by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. RNAs were resolved on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel and blotted to a Hybond-N membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Northern blot hybridizations with riboprobes specific for human RNase P, RNase MRP, and U3 RNAs were performed as described previously (32Verheijen R. Wiik A. De Jong B.A. Hoier Madsen M. Ullman S. Halberg P. van Venrooij W.J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1994; 169: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Indirect immunofluorescence assays with affinity-purified rabbit anti-hPop5 antibodies and affinity-purified rabbit anti-GST antibodies were performed on HEp-2 cells. Fixed cells were incubated with affinity-purified antibodies (diluted 1:20 in PBS) for 1 h at room temperature, washed with PBS, and subsequently incubated with Alexa Fluor® 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugate (Molecular Probes, diluted 1:75 in PBS) for 1 h at room temperature. Bound antibodies were visualized by epifluorescence microscopy. Purification of the human RNase P enzyme was performed as described previously (17Eder P.S. Kekuda R. Stolc V. Altman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1101-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 33Bartkiewicz M. Gold H. Altman S. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 488-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). HeLa S3 cells (National Cell Culture Center, Minneapolis, MN) were pelleted, disrupted, and the cell lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g, followed by another centrifugation at 100,000 g. The extract was loaded on a DEAE-Sepharose column, and bound material was eluted with a linear 100–500 mm KCl gradient. Fractions containing RNase P activity were pooled, concentrated, and further fractionated by centrifugation in a 15–30% glycerol gradient. To assay for RNase P activity in the immunoprecipitates and column fractions, an internally32P-labeled pre-tRNA substrate (Schizosaccharomyces pombe tRNASer SupS1), was transcribed in vitro and gel-purified. This 110-nucleotide-long substrate contains a 5′ end extension of 28 nucleotides in comparison with the mature tRNA. The immunoprecipitates or fractions were incubated with equal amounts of substrate in assay buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithioerythritol, 50 mm KCl, 50 µg/ml bovine serum albumin, 60 units/ml RNasin) for 10 min at 37 °C. Reaction products were analyzed by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. VSV G epitope (34Kreis T.E. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 931-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) (VSV-G)-tagged (hereafter referred to as VSV-tagged) cDNAs were constructed as follows. 55k-VSV cDNA constructs (31Pluk H. Soffner J. Luhrmann R. van Venrooij W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 488-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), containing either aXhoI or a XbaI site between the 55-kDa open reading frame (ORF) and the VSV tag sequence (positioned at the N- and C-terminal sides, respectively) were cleaved with XhoI andXbaI releasing the 55-kDa cDNA from this plasmid. The VSV-tagged constructs of hPop5 were constructed by isolation of the hPop5 ORF from the hPop5/PCR-II-TOPO construct byXhoI/XbaI digestion and ligation into theXhoI/XbaI-digested 55k-VSV constructs. A construct expressing deletion mutant hPop5 Δ(145–163) was generated by a PCR-based approach. Besides the deletion introduced by the PCR strategy, an XhoI site was introduced at the 5′ end of the translational start codon, whereas an XbaI site was introduced at the 3′ end of the coding sequence. The transfection construct was generated by ligating the XhoI/XbaI fragment into the XhoI/XbaI-digested 55k-VSV constructs. The integrity of the resulting construct was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The pCI-neo vector (Promega), which has been used to prepare 55k-VSV previously, was used as a control in the transfection experiments. HEp-2 monolayer cells were grown to 70% confluence by standard tissue culture techniques in either culture flasks or on coverslips. HEp-2 cells were transfected with the VSV-tagged constructs (3–4 µg) using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After overnight growth in flasks, cells were harvested, washed once with PBS, and used to prepare extracts for immunoprecipitation assays. Purification of the yeast RNase P holoenzyme has resulted in the identification of nine protein subunits (22Chamberlain J.R. Lee Y. Lane W.S. Engelke D.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1678-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Although some of these were shown to have homologues in humans, no human homologues have been reported for Snm1p, Pop3p, Pop5p, Pop6p, Pop8p, and Rpr2p. We have searched protein and “translated nucleic acid” sequence data bases to identify sequences that might represent human homologues of these yeast protein subunits. Four virtually identical nucleic acid entries were found that encode a putative human homologue of the yeast Pop5p protein (hereafter designated yPop5). The latter polypeptide consists of 173 amino acids and has a predicted molecular mass of 19.6 kDa. The corresponding human sequence (data base entry AF117232) is 785 nucleotides long and contains an ORF encoding a polypeptide of 162 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 18.7 kDa. For reasons documented below, this protein will be referred to as hPop5. Besides the human ESTs retrieved from the sequence data bases, two mouse ESTs, two rat ESTs, one cow EST, and one D. melanogaster entry that encode putative homologues of the yeast Pop5p protein were identified. These entries contain ORFs of 169, 169, 170, and 145 amino acids, respectively. To obtain a cDNA encoding the putative human Pop5 protein, two oligonucleotides were designed based on the identified human EST sequence. These oligonucleotides were used as PCR primers to isolate hPop5 cDNAs from human teratocarcinoma and placenta cDNA libraries. Sequence analysis of several clones obtained by this procedure revealed that cDNAs derived from both sources were identical, thereby ruling out the introduction of PCR artifacts. Two minor differences were found in all sequenced cDNAs in comparison with the corresponding EST described above (AF117232). Nucleotides 154–162 in the cloned cDNA sequence (numbering according to data base accession no. AJ306296) are 5′-GCA GCCGCC-3′, whereas the EST contains 5′-GCA CCC-3′ at this position, resulting in the replacement of a Pro codon by two Ala codons in the cloned cDNA in comparison with the EST. Furthermore, a single nucleotide substitution was detected at position 461, where a T residue was found rather than a C residue, which is observed at this position in the human EST. To determine whether the first ATG present in the human EST represents the translational start codon, we synthesized cDNA from several sources of mRNA. DNA sequencing of the resulting clones revealed that no additional sequence information was obtained (data not shown). The cloned cDNA encodes a protein of 163 amino acids, with a predicted molecular mass of 18.8 kDa and a predicted pI of 7.9. In Fig. 1an alignment of the amino acid sequences derived from the human, cow, rat, mouse,Drosophila, and yeast cDNAs/ESTs is shown. This illustrates the high level of homology between the mammalian Pop5 polypeptides (88–91% identity, 93–95% similarity), whereas the homology between the human, Drosophila, and yeast proteins is much lower (23–27% identity and 40–43% similarity). The conservation of the yeast and human Pop5 amino acid sequences is most extensive in the N terminus. Except for the acidic C terminus, the primary sequence of hPop5 does not reveal established sequence motifs. The acidic nature of the C terminus is conserved from human to yeast (in hPop5, 9 out of 15 residues are acidic), although it appears to be absent in the Drosophila sequence. To determine whether the hPop5 protein is associated with the human RNase MRP and RNase P ribonucleoprotein particles, a polyclonal antibody was raised against recombinant hPop5. The hPop5 protein was expressed as a fusion protein with GST in E. coli. The recombinant GST-hPop5 fusion protein was purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Fig. 2,lane 2) and used for immunization of rabbits. Western blot analysis showed that the resulting rabbit serum is reactive with the GST-hPop5 protein (lane 4), whereas the pre-immune serum is not (lane 3). Because the rabbit serum failed to recognize the hPop5 protein in HeLa extracts (data not shown), anti-hPop5 antibodies were purified by affinity selection with recombinant GST-hPop5 from the rabbit serum. Prior to the GST-hPop5 selection, the rabbit serum was depleted of anti-GST activity by performing affinity selection with recombinant GST. Western blot analysis of HeLa cell extracts with the affinity-purified antibodies against hPop5 revealed a single protein with an estimated size of 19 kDa (lane 6), whereas the affinity-purified antibodies against GST failed to detect any protein in HeLa extracts (lane 5). To investigate whether the hPop5 protein is associated with the RNase MRP and RNase P complexes, immunoprecipitations with the anti-hPop5 serum using total HeLa cell extract were performed. The co-precipitating RNAs were isolated and analyzed by Northern blot hybridization using riboprobes specific for RNase MRP, RNase P, and U3 RNA. As depicted in Fig. 3(lane 6), the anti-hPop5 antiserum efficiently immunoprecipitated both RNase MRP and RNase P RNAs, whereas no detectable precipitation of U3 RNA was observed. The specificity of this assay was demonstrated by the observation that pre-immune serum did not precipitate any of the RNAs analyzed (lane 5) and that anti-55K antibodies specifically precipitated U3 RNA (lane 3) in accordance with previous observations (31Pluk H. Soffner J. Luhrmann R. van Venrooij W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 488-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In addition, the RNase MRP and RNase P RNAs were co-immunoprecipitated by a patient anti-Th/To antiserum and by anti-hPop4 antibodies (lanes 2 and 4). These results indicate that the 19-kDa hPop5 protein is associated with both RNase MRP and RNase P RNAs in HeLa cells. To investigate the subcellular localization of the hPop5 protein, the affinity-purified antibodies directed against GST-hPop5 and GST were used for immunolocalization experiments in HEp-2 cells. The affinity-purified anti-hPop5 antibodies strongly stained the nucleoli and showed, in addition, a fine-speckled cytoplasmic staining (Fig.4, panel A). Using affinity-purified anti-GST antibodies, a similar fine-speckled cytoplasmic staining pattern, but no nucleolar staining, was observed (panel C), strongly suggesting that the cytoplasmic staining is caused by anti-GST reactivity. Although these results do not completely rule out a cytoplasmic localization of the hPop5 protein, they clearly show that the hPop5 protein accumulates in the nucleoli, consistent with its association with RNase MRP and RNase P. To obtain further evidence that the hPop5 protein is part of the complete RNase P complex, we tested whether hPop5 is associated with catalytically active RNase P. First, we partially purified the active RNase P complex from a HeLa cell extract by DEAE-Sepharose chromatography and glycerol gradient centrifugation. The fractions of the glycerol gradient were tested for RNase P activity by monitoring its ability to specifically cleave an internally labeled precursor tRNA substrate to tRNA and its 5′-leader. Products of this reaction were separated on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel and visualized by autoradiography. In agreement with previous observations (17,33), the RNase P activity was only detected in relatively fast sedimenting fractions (Fig. 5A). To study the presence of the hPop5 protein in the active RNase P fractions of the glycerol gradient, these fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting. As shown in the lower part of Fig. 5 A, hPop5 (bottom panel), hPop4 (middle panel), and Rpp38 (top panel) co-fractionated with the RNase P activity, suggesting that hPop5 indeed is associated with catalytically active RNase P. To confirm this, immunoprecipitations were performed on RNase P containing glycerol gradient fractions using affinity-purified anti-hPop5 and anti-GST antibodies and the immunoprecipitates were assayed for RNase P activity. As shown in Fig. 5 B (lanes 2and 3), the immunoprecipitate obtained with the affinity-purified anti-hPop5 antibodies was able to cleave pre-tRNA into mature tRNA and its 5′-leader, whereas the immunoprecipitate of the affinity-purified anti-GST antibodies was not. The RNase P activity in the anti-hPop5 immunoprecipitate was indistinguishable from that obtained with anti-hPop4 antibodies, which functioned as a positive control (lane 1). These results indicate that the hPop5 protein is part of the catalytically active RNase P complex. Although these data do not show that the hPop5 protein is associated with catalytically active RNase MRP as well, the strong evolutionary relationship between the RNase P and RNase MRP complexes suggests that hPop5 is also associated with RNase MRP. As described above, the only amino acid sequence element that could be detected in the primary structure of hPop5 is its acidic C terminus. Therefore, we investigated whether this sequence element is required for complex association. A VSV tag sequence (34Kreis T.E. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 931-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) was fused to the 3′ end of the hPop5 ORF and to the 3′ end of a truncated cDNA lacking the sequence corresponding to the acidic C terminus (designated hPop5-VSV and hPop5 Δ(145–163), respectively). HEp-2 cells were transfected with these constructs or with the corresponding “empty” vector as a negative control. After culturing the cells for 16-h extracts were prepared and used for immunoprecipitation with anti-VSV tag antibodies. Co-precipitating RNAs were isolated and analyzed via Northern blot hybridization using riboprobes for RNase MRP and RNase P RNA. As is shown in Fig.6A (lanes 1 and 2), RNase MRP and RNase P RNA were both immunoprecipitated from a cell extract containing the hPop5-VSV protein, but not from an extract from cells transfected with the empty vector. This result confirms that hPop5 associates with the RNase MRP and RNase P RNAs in human cells and demonstrates that this approach is suitable to analyze hPop5 mutants. As depicted in lane 3, the hPop5 Δ(145–163) mutant was able to associate with both RNase MRP and RNase P RNA, indicating that the evolutionarily conserved acidic C terminus is not required for association with these ribonucleoproteins. To investigate whether this element plays a role in the endoribonuclease activity of RNase P, HEp-2 cells were transfected with the VSV-tagged hPop5 and hPop5 Δ(145–163) constructs and immunoprecipitations were performed on extracts prepared from these cells. A 32P-labeled precursor tRNA was incubated at 37 °C with the immunoprecipitates, and the resulting products were analyzed by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. As shown in Fig. 6 B (lanes 1 and 2), complexes associated with both hPop5 and the mutant lacking the acidic C terminus displayed RNase P activity, whereas a control immunoprecipitate did not. Thus, the most C-terminal 19 amino acids of hPop5 are required neither for complex association nor for RNase P activity. In this report we describe the cloning of a novel human RNase MRP/RNase P protein subunit. Based upon its homology with the yeast Pop5p protein, we have designated this protein hPop5. We showed that the human protein, like the yeast Pop5p protein, is associated with both RNase MRP and RNase P ribonucleoprotein particles and that the latter particle is catalytically active in vitro. Besides the human homologue of Pop5p, our data base searches identified two ESTs (accession nos.AI751395 and AA534933) encoding a putative homologue of the RNase P-specific protein subunit: Rpr2p (9van Eenennaam H. Jarrous N. van Venrooij W.J. Pruijn G.J.M. IUBMB Life. 2000; 49: 265-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). No homologues were identified for the Snm1p, Pop3p, Pop6p, and Pop8p protein, suggesting that only 6 of the 10 yeast RNase MRP/RNase P protein subunits have human counterparts. A high degree of sequence conservation was observed among the mammalian Pop5 proteins, whereas only a moderate level of conservation exists between human, yeast, and DrosophilaPop5 (23–27% identity). A similar level of sequence conservation has been reported for other RNase MRP and RNase P protein subunits: hPop1/Pop1p (22% identity), Rpp30/Rpp1p (23% identity), Rpp20/Rpp2p (14% identity), and hPop4/Pop4p (29% identity) (16Lygerou Z.

RNA. 1998; 4: 407-417PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, the analysis of the genomes of archae bacteria allowed the detection of hPop5 and Rpp30 counterparts also in these organisms (35Koonin E.V. Wolf Y.I. Aravind L. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 240-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) and in addition showed that the secondary structures of Pop5 and Rpp14 are related. A similar conservation from humans to archaea has been suggested for the Rpp29/hPop4 and Rpp21 subunits (36Altman S. Gopalan V. Vioque A. RNA. 2000; 6: 1689-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). A comparison of the secondary structures of RNase MRP RNA and RNase P RNA from various organisms has led to the hypothesis that RNase MRP evolved from RNase P in an early eukaryote (37Collins L.J. Moulton V. Penny D. J. Mol. Evol. 2000; 51: 194-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The association of the four highly conserved proteins with MRP RNA would be explained by the hypothesis that proteins associated with RNase P RNA have the capacity to bind MRP RNA as well. We showed that the hPop5 protein is localized in the nucleus and accumulates in the nucleolus (Fig. 4). Previously, it has been proposed that nucleolar entry is a two-step mechanism (38Girard J.P. Bagni C. Caizergues Ferrer M. Amalric F. Lapeyre B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18499-18506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Schmidt Zachmann M.S. Nigg E.A. J.

First, a nucleolar protein is transported to the nucleus and subsequently it accumulates in the nucleolus. Recently, we demonstrated that clusters of basic amino acids are important for the localization of protein subunits of RNase MRP and RNase P in the nucleolus. 2H. van Eenennaam, A. van der Heijden, R. J. R. J. Janssen, W. J. van Venrooij, and G. J. M. Pruijn, submitted for publication. The absence of a nuclear localization signal as well as clusters of basic residues in the hPop5 amino acid sequence suggests that hPop5 is targeted to the nucleus/nucleolus in a different manner. The hPop5 protein might be transported to the nucleus and nucleolus by a piggyback mechanism. In that case hPop5 binds in the cytoplasm to another (RNase MRP/RNase P) protein, which carries the hPop5 protein to the nucleus and subsequently to the nucleolus. Transport of the hPop5 protein from the nucleoplasm to the nucleolus might also be dependent on its association with the (partially assembled) RNase MRP/RNase P ribonucleoprotein complexes. A similar situation has been proposed for the Rpp14 protein (41Jarrous N. Wolenski J.S. Wesolowski D. Lee C. Altman S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 559-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The results in Figs. 3 and 6 demonstrate that the hPop5 protein subunit, like its yeast counterpart, is associated with both RNase MRP and RNase P. The association of protein subunits with both RNase MRP and RNase P has been previously reported for hPop1, Rpp30, Rpp38, and hPop4/Rpp29 (reviewed in Ref. 9van Eenennaam H. Jarrous N. van Venrooij W.J. Pruijn G.J.M. IUBMB Life. 2000; 49: 265-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and has been observed for the Rpp20 protein subunit as well. 3H. van Eenennaam, D. Lugtenberg, J. H. P. Vogelzangs, W. J. van Venrooij, and G. J. M. Pruijn, unpublished observations. The sharing of protein subunits by these endoribonuclease complexes might be explained at least in part by the conservation of the secondary structure of their RNA components and the suggestion that the RNase MRP RNA has evolved from the RNase P RNA in early eukaryotes (see above). In yeast two protein subunits have been described to be specifically associated with either the RNase MRP complex or the RNase P complex (21Schmitt M.E. Clayton D.A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2617-2628Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 22Chamberlain J.R. Lee Y. Lane W.S. Engelke D.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1678-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Such complex-specific protein subunits have not been described for the human enzymes yet. An alternative explanation for extensive subunit sharing is the possibility that RNase MRP and RNase P assemble into a single complex in human cells. This possibility is supported by the finding that a subset of the cellular RNase MRP and RNase P complexes has been shown to exist in such a macromolecular complex (42Lee B. Matera A.G. Ward D.C. Craft J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11471-11476Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, in yeast, the majority of the RNase MRP and RNase P complexes can be physically separated and they function separately from each other (6Lygerou Z. Allmang C. Tollervey D. Seraphin B. Science. 1996; 272: 268-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 17Eder P.S. Kekuda R. Stolc V. Altman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The exact function and architecture of this human macromolecular complex and its relation to the individual RNase MRP and RNase P complexes remain to be elucidated and provide interesting topics for further research.

This conclusion is based on the following observations: (a) α1-acid glycoprotein was identified to bind PAI-1 by a yeast two-hybrid system. Three of 10 positive clones identified by this method to interact with PAI-1 contained almost the entire sequence of α1-acid glycoprotein; (b) this protein formed complexes with PAI-1 that could be immunoprecipitated from both the incubation mixtures and blood plasma by specific antibodies to either PAI-1 or α1-acid glycoprotein. Such complexes could be also detected by a solid phase binding assay; and (c) the real-time bimolecular interactions monitored by surface plasmon resonance indicated that the complex of α1-acid glycoprotein with PAI-1 is less stable than that formed by vitronectin with PAI-1, but in both cases, the apparentK D values were in the range of strong interactions (4.51 + 1.33 and 0.58 + 0.07 nm, respectively). The on rate for binding of PAI-1 to α1-glycoprotein or vitronectin differed by 2-fold, indicating much faster complex formation by vitronectin than by α1-acid glycoprotein. On the other hand, dissociation of PAI-1 bound to vitronectin was much slower than that from the α1-acid glycoprotein, as indicated by 4-fold lower k off values. Furthermore, the PAI-1 activity toward urokinase-type plasminogen activator and tissue-type plasminogen activator was significantly prolonged in the presence of α1-acid glycoprotein. These observations suggest that the complex of PAI-1 with α1-acid glycoprotein can play a role as an alternative reservoir of the physiologically active form of the inhibitor, particularly during inflammation or other acute phase reactions. α1-Acid glycoprotein, one of the major acute phase proteins, was found to interact with plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) and to stabilize its inhibitory activity toward plasminogen activators.

Ritkin D.B. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 93-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). Under normal physiological conditions, PAI-1 is present in blood plasma at nanomolar concentrations that increase rapidly in response to different stimuli, including cytokines associated with defensive processes such as inflammation (2Declerck P.J. Verstreken M. Kruithof E.K.O. Juhan-Vague L. Collen D. Blood. 1988; 71: 220-225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Loskutoff D.J. Sawdey M. Mimuro J. Prog. Hemostasis Thromb. 1989; 9: 87-115PubMed Google Scholar). Among serine proteinase inhibitors (serpins), PAI-1 is the most efficient in vivoinhibitor of both tissue-type and urokinase-type plasminogen activators (4Lawrence D.A. Ginsburg D. High K.A. Roberts H.R. Molecular Basis of Thrombosis and Haemostasis. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1995: 517-543Google Scholar). In contrast to other serpins, its inhibitory activity is associated with its thermodynamically unstable form, which spontaneously converts to the stable inactive form. The active form of PAI-1 is thought to have an exposed center loop that is available for interaction with proteinases (5Lawrence D.A. Ginsburg D. Day D. Berkenpas M.B. Verhamme I.M. Kvasman J.-O. Shore J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25300-25312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 6Lawrence D.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 339-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The conversion from active PAI-1 to its latent form involves incorporating this surface-exposed loop containing the reactive center into the central β-sheet of the protein (7Mottonen J. Strand A. Symersky J. Sweet R.M. Danley D.E. Geogheggan K.F. Gerard R.D. Goldsmith E.J. Nature. 1992; 355: 270-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar, 8Lawrence D.A. Olson S.T. Palaniappani S. Ginsburg D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3643-3648Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Thus, self-inactivation of PAI-1 is a crucial regulatory mechanism by which this protein functions in circulation. Because PAI-1 is inherently unstable and readily converts from an active to a latent form, the interaction with vitronectin is critical for regulation of PAI-1 inhibitory activity (9Declerck P.J. De Mol M. Alessi M.C. Baudner S. Paques E.P. Preissner K.T. Muller-Berghaus G. Collen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15454-15461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Salonen E.M. Vaheri A.

Stabilization of the active PAI-1 occurs due to formation of a complex with vitronectin, and PAI-1 circulates in blood vessels in such a complex (9Declerck P.J. De Mol M. Alessi M.C. Baudner S. Paques E.P. Preissner K.T. Muller-Berghaus G. Collen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15454-15461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This inhibitor also appears to be complexed with vitronectin on platelets (11Preissner K.T. Helzhuter S. Justus C. Muller-Berghaus G. Blood. 1989; 74: 1989-1996Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which are regarded as the main source of PAI-1 found in blood plasma (12Kruithof E.K. Nicolosa G. Bachmann F. Blood. 1987; 70: 1645-1653Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Vitronectin binds PAI-1 with high affinity (13Lawrence D.A. Palaniappani S. Stefansson S. Olson S.T. Francis-Chmura A.M. Shore J.D. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7676-7680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and maintains the active conformation of the inhibitor (14Seiffert D. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2824-2830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The vitronectin-binding site on PAI-1 appears to be located on the central β-sheet, the one that incorporates a surface-exposed loop containing the reactive center, and within adjacent secondary structures (7Mottonen J. Strand A. Symersky J. Sweet R.M. Danley D.E. Geogheggan K.F. Gerard R.D. Goldsmith E.J. Nature. 1992; 355: 270-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar,14Seiffert D. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol.

Therefore, association of vitronectin with the region in the vicinity of the reactive center interferes with movements of the β-strands and thus inhibits a conversion of PAI-1 to a latent form. On the other hand, the vitronectin interaction with PAI-1 induces allosteric changes in vitronectin that expose cryptic epitopes (17Seiffert D. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29644-29651Google Scholar) and modulates vitronectin-dependent cell adhesion (13Lawrence D.A. Palaniappani S. Stefansson S. Olson S.T. Francis-Chmura A.M. Shore J.D. Ginsburg D. J.

The physiological implications of the PAI-1-vitronectin interaction are important because they affect the functions of both proteins. However, based on the much higher stability of the active PAI-1 associated with subendothelial matrix as compared with that in the vitronectin complex, it seems reasonable to look for some other mechanisms by which the active conformation of PAI-1 can be stabilized. In fact, PAI-1 was suggested to bind to negatively charged phospholipids such as phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositol and thus to be activated, for example, after release from platelets (19Lambers J.W. Cammenga M. Konig B. Pannekoek H. van Mourk J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17492-17496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, PAI-1 secreted from activated platelets bound to fibrin associated with platelet membranes and inhibited fibrin degradation (20Kirkpatrick J. Lewis J.C. Hantgan R.R. Blood. 1993; 81: 1290-1299Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This binding required active PAI-1, and the fibrin-bound PAI-1, like the PAI-1-vitronectin complex, was shown to form complexes with tPA and uPA. There are more observations indicating that PAI-1 can bind directly (21Wagner O. de Vries C. Hohmann C. Veeman H. Pannekoek H. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 22Stringer A.A.R. Pannekoek H. J. Biol.

Recently, another protein that interacts with PAI-1 was identified in the mammary glands (24Tonner E. Allan G. Shkreta L. Webster J. Whitelaw C.B. Flint D.J. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2000; 480: 45-53Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was suggested that insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 5, in addition to activation of cell death via insulin-like growth factor 1 sequestration, can enhance plasminogen conversion to plasmin by sequestering PAI-1 and thus regulate extracellular matrix remodeling (24Tonner E. Allan G. Shkreta L. Webster J. Whitelaw C.B. Flint D.J. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2000; 480: 45-53Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, by using the yeast-based two-hybrid system for studying protein-protein interaction (25Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4853) Google Scholar, 26Chien C.-T. Bartel P.L. Sternglanz R. Fields S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9578-9582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar), we attempted to identify proteins other than vitronectin that, via binding to PAI-1, can preserve its inhibitory activity. Screening of the human liver cDNA library revealed α1-acid glycoprotein to be capable of complexing with PAI-1. Next, the interaction of α1-acid glycoprotein with PAI-1 was evidenced by several approaches including solid phase binding assays, co-immunoprecipitation experiments, and BIAcore analysis. These analyses revealed that α1-acid glycoprotein interacted with PAI-1 with lower binding affinity than vitronectin but with high enough affinity to stabilize the active conformation of PAI-1 and prolong its inhibitory activity toward uPA and tPA. Human PAI-1, vitronectin, and α1-acid glycoprotein were purchased from Calbiochem-Novabiochem Co. (San Diego, CA). Recombinant PAI-1 was also kindly donated by Dr. P. J. Declerck (Louvain, Belgium). Single-chain tPA containing >95% single-chain molecule was from Genentech. Human glu-plasminogen, α-thrombin, and plasminogen-free fibrinogen were purchased from Enzyme Research Laboratories Inc. (South Bend, IN). Antibodies to α1-acid glycoprotein, mouse monoclonal antibody AAG2, and rabbit polyclonal antibodies were purchased from ICN Biomedicals, Inc. (Aurora, OH). Mouse monoclonal antibody to vitronectin was from Chemicon International, Inc. (Temecula, CA). Mouse monoclonal antibodies to 20S proteasome were from Affinity Research Products Ltd. (Mamhead, United Kingdom). Mouse monoclonal antibodies to PAI-1, MAUI-12, and clone 7 were purchased from Biopool (Umea, Sweden) and Calbiochem-Novabiochem Co., respectively. Anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside, and Wizard Miniprep and Maxiprep kits for isolation of plasmid DNA were purchased from Promega Corp. (Madison, WI). Protein A/G was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). High binding 96-well microtiter plates were obtained from Costar Science Corp. (Cambridge, MA). 2,2′-Azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazidine-6-sulfonic) acid, bovine serum albumin (fraction V), p-nitrophenyl phosphate, alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co. Yeast strains for two-hybrid experiments, as well as all components of the MATCHMAKER Two-Hybrid System together with cDNA library from human liver, were obtained from CLONTECH. Cloning of plasmids was done inEscherichia coli strain DH5α, whereas yeast strain Y190 was used to asssay protein-protein interactions and for library screening. PAI-1 cDNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and subcloned into theEcoRI and BamHI restriction sites of pAS2-1 to produce pAS2-1-PAI-1. DNA sequencing of the obtained product by using Sequaterm kits (Epicentre) revealed an in-frame fusion of PAI-1 to the 3′ end of the GAL4 DNA-binding domain. The GAL4-PAI-1 fusion protein was stably expressed in yeast as evidenced by immunoblotting using monoclonal antibody to PAI-1. Concentrations of PAI-1 were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using the Imulyse PAI-1 kit from Biopool. Furthermore, PAI-1 in this construct was able to inhibit tPA-induced plasminogen conversion into plasmin. The two-hybrid assay using the GAL4 system was performed according to the instructions of the manufacturer (CLONTECH). For library screening, Y190 yeast cells were transformed with a liver two-hybrid library inserted into the activation vector pGAD10, and pAS2-1-PAI-1 was used as bait. Doubly transformed cells were plated on Leu−, Trp−, and His− plates. Colonies were picked, restreaked onto triple minus plates (Leu−Trp−His−), and assayed for the LacZ phenotype. Yeast transformants were permeabilized in liquid nitrogen and transferred on nitrocellulose soaked in 60 mm Na2HPO4, 40 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mmMgCl2, and 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol and containing 1 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactosidase at 30 °C. Positive blue colonies appeared in 1 h (strong interaction) to 6 h (weak interaction). Library clones fromHis+, Lac+ colonies were isolated and re-transformed alone with pAS2-1 and with pAS2-1-PAI-1 and pLAM5′ and checked again for β-galactosidase activity. PAI-1, vitronectin, and α1-acid glycoprotein were trace radiolabeled with Na125I using Iodobeads (Pierce) to a specific activity of 50 μCi/mg, and the labeled proteins were isolated by gel filtration on Sephadex G-25. All proteins migrated as a single band during Laemmli (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207002) Google Scholar) SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Aliquots of 125I-labeled PAI-1 (6 nm) were mixed with increasing concentrations of either vitronectin or α1-acid glycoprotein in 500 μl of 0.1m phosphate buffer, pH 7.1, containing 0.14 mNaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, and 4% PBS-Tween-polyethylene glycol and incubated for an hour at room temperature. Complexes were made by incubating the proteins at molar ratios (PAI-1:vitronectin and PAI-1:α1-acid glycoprotein) ranging from 1:10 to 1:40. In parallel experiments, samples of 125I-labeled α1-acid glycoprotein (5 and 10 nm; 100,000 or 200,000 cpm) were mixed with different concentrations of PAI-1 (30–150 nm) and incubated under the same conditions. One μg of rabbit polyclonal antibodies to vitronectin or α1-acid glycoprotein was added, and incubation continued for 4 h at 4 °C. To isolate immunoprecipitates, 20 μl of 50% slurry of protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added, and the incubation mixture was left overnight at 4 °C. The immunoadsorbent complexes were washed three times with PBS-Tween-polyethylene glycol and twice with PBS and then solubilized in 40 μl of Laemmli sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE using a 10% running gel (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207002) Google Scholar). Samples were reduced by heating to 100 °C for 5 min in the presence of 5% 2-mercaptoethanol. The gels were dried and exposed to x-ray Kodak film for a day at −70 °C. To identify PAI-1-α1-acid glycoprotein complexes in human plasma, 125I-labeled α1-acid glycoprotein (50 nm) was added to 500 μl of control blood plasma samples from an Imulyse kit (Biopool) and incubated for 18 h at 4 °C. Positive control plasma (50 μg PAI-1/ml) and negative control plasma (PAI-1-depleted plasma) were used. Next, 1 μg of rabbit polyclonal antibodies to PAI-1 was added and incubated for 4 h at 4 °C, and immunoprecipitates were isolated as described above. The wells of 96-well microtiter plates were coated overnight at 4 °C with either α1-acid glycoprotein or vitronectin at 1 μg/ml in PBS. Unbound proteins were washed from the wells, and nonspecific binding sites were blocked by incubation with 3% BSA and 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS for an hour at room temperature. Direct binding assays were performed by adding increasing concentrations of PAI-1 to immobilized α1-acid glycoprotein-, vitronectin-, or BSA-coated plates in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.5, containing 1% BSA, 0.01% Tween 20, and 1 mm CaCl2, and the plates were then incubated for an hour at 37 °C. The activation of latent PAI-1 by treatment with SDS was performed on all samples before binding assays, as described previously (28Lewis M.L. Nachtwey D.S. Damron K.L. Thromb. Res. 1991; 64: 223-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Unbound PAI-1 was aspirated, and the wells were washed three times with PBS containing 0.1% BSA and 0.05% Tween 20. To detect bound PAI-1, the plates were incubated with polyclonal antibodies to PAI-1 for an hour at room temperature and then washed with PBS containing 0.1% BSA and 0.05% Tween 20. The plates were incubated with goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. The reaction was developed using 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazidine-6-sulfonic) acid) from Sigma at 1 mg/ml in 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 4.5, and the change in color was determined at 405 nm. To detect nonspecific binding, all assays were done simultaneously on plates coated with BSA alone and processed as described above. The background binding to BSA was subtracted from all samples before data analysis. The kinetic parameters (association and dissociation rate constants, k onand k off, respectively) and the affinity constant (K D) between α1-acid glycoprotein and PAI-1 were measured by surface plasmon resonance using a BIAcore X (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In parallel, the same kinetic constants describing the vitronectin complex with PAI-1 were evaluated. Briefly, PAI-1 was covalently attached to carboxymethyl dextran (CM5) chips (BIAcore) previously activated with N-hydroxysuccinimide andN-ethyl-N′-dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide according to the manufacturer's instructions. Experiments were performed at 25 °C using Tris-buffered saline/Bia (150 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, 0.005% P20, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) as a running buffer. The sensor chip was regenerated with a short pulse of 200 nm glycine-HCl, pH 2.2. The amount of ligands, α1-acid glycoprotein or vitronectin, bound to immobilized PAI-1 was monitored by measuring the variation of the surface plasmon resonance angle as a function of time. Results were expressed in RU, an arbitrary unit specific for the BIAcore instrument (1000 RU correspond to ∼1 ng of bound protein/mm2). The association rate constant,k on, and dissociation rate constant,k off, were determined separately from individual association and dissociation phases, respectively, assuming one-to-one interaction. The overall affinity constant, K D, was derived from k on/k off. Samples of PAI-1 (6.0 nm) dissolved in PBS, pH 7.4, containing 0.1% BSA and 0.01% Tween 20 were incubated at 37 °C in the absence or presence of either vitronectin (0.6 μm) or α1-acid glycoprotein (0.6 μm). At different time points, aliquots were withdrawn to measure PAI-1 activity toward uPA and tPA using chromogenic assays. Briefly, the activity of PAI-1 was evaluated after incubation with high molecular weight uPA (4.8 nm; 25 IU/ml; American Diagnostica) or single-chain tPA (4.6 nm; 150 IU/ml; Genentech) for 30 min at 25 °C. The chromogenic substrate S-2444 (0.5 mm; Molndal) for uPA or Spectrozyme tPA (0.5 mm; American Diagnostica) for tPA were used. Residual uPA or tPA activity was determined by quantifying the change in absorbance at 410 nm. Rates of substrate hydrolysis were calculated for each of the various experimental conditions and expressed as a percentage of the maximum rate of uPA and tPA substrate hydrolysis in the absence of PAI-1. Several studies have indicated that active PAI-1 is very labile and converts within 1–2 h into an inactive form, unless its active conformation becomes stabilized via interaction with some other proteins (29Sprengers E.D. Akerman J.W.W. Jansen B.G. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1986; 55: 325-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 30Pannekoek H. Veerman H. Lambers H. Diergaarde P. Verweij C. van Zonneveld A.

Subsequently, vitronectin was found to bind PAI-1 with high affinity and to serve as a reservoir of the active PAI-1 in circulation (9Declerck P.J. De Mol M. Alessi M.C. Baudner S. Paques E.P.

Our present studies show for the first time that α1-acid glycoprotein also interacts with PAI-1 and may play a significant role in the regulation of fibrinolysis. This protein has been identified after using the yeast two-hybrid system to screen human liver cDNA libraries cloned into the GAL4 activation domain, with PAI-1 fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain for use as the bait protein. Of 50 His+ LacZ+colonies isolated, 10 gave a strong interaction, and after DNA sequence analysis and data bank searches, 3 of them revealed that they encode almost the entire molecule of α1-acid glycoprotein,i.e. without the 7 beginning amino acids from the signal peptide. This major acute phase protein is comprised of 201 amino acid residues, which may form to large extent a lipocalin domain (reviewed in Ref. 35Fournier T. Medjoubi-N N. Porquet D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1482: 157-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). The specificity and nature of the interaction between PAI-1 and α1-acid glycoprotein were characterized by co-transformation of various constructs into the Y190 yeast strain. β-Galactosidase activity was detected only in yeast co-transformed with PAI-1 and α1-acid glycoprotein, ruling out the possibility that single plasmids, either pGAD10-α1-acid glycoprotein or pAS2-1-PAI-1, contain intrinsic transcriptional activity or interact with other proteins nonspecifically. Human α1-acid glycoprotein is the product of a cluster of three adjacent genes: AGP-A, AGP-B, and AGP-B′ covering 70 kbase of the human genome and located on chromosome 9.AGP-A is actively expressed in human liver and codes for the major component of serum α1-acid glycoprotein (ORM1, orsomucoid) (35Fournier T. Medjoubi-N N. Porquet D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1482: 157-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). In addition to hepatocytes (36Dente L. Ruther U. Tripoldi M. Wagner E.F. Cortese R. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), different forms of this protein are expressed in other cells, including human breast epithelial cells (37Kushner I. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1982; 389: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar), endothelial cells from dermal tissue (38Sorensson J. Matejka G.L. Ohlson M. Haraldsson B. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: H530-H534PubMed Google Scholar), and cultured human granulocytes and monocytes (39Shibata Y. Tamura K. Ishida N. Microbiol. Immunol. 1984; 28: 99-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Under physiological conditions, α-acid glycoprotein plasma concentration remains stable (about 1 g/liter) but increases severalfold during acute phase reactions caused by systemic tissue injury, inflammation, and infection (37Kushner I. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1982; 389: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar, 39Shibata Y. Tamura K. Ishida N. Microbiol. Immunol. 1984; 28: 99-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Although the biological function of α1-acid glycoprotein remains unknown, it is considered to be a natural anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory agent (40Fey G.H. Fuller G.M. Mol. Biol. Med. 1987; 4: 323-338PubMed Google Scholar, 41Williams J.P. Weiser M.R. Pechet T.T. Kobzik L. Moore Jr., F.D. Hechtman H.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G1031-G1035PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, a vast number of studies have shown that the increased PAI-1 levels and activity are associated with all these pathophysiological processes, particularly under inflammatory conditions. To determine whether α1-acid glycoprotein interacts with PAI-1in vivo, both proteins were immunoprecipitated from the incubation mixture in which one of them was radiolabeled. In the first set of experiments, 125I-PAI-1 was mixed with α1-acid glycoprotein or vitronectin to achieve molar ratios in both cases ranging from 1:10 to 1:50 and incubated overnight. The complexes were then precipitated using antibodies specific to α1-acid glycoprotein or vitronectin, respectively. As illustrated in Fig. 1 A, both proteins were associated with PAI-1, and their complexes were detectable by autoradiography after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. However, the intensity of bands differed significantly, suggesting a higher binding affinity of PAI-1 to vitronectin than to α1-acid glycoprotein. Although PAI-1 is known to be very sensitive to oxidative radiolabeling (42Lawrence D.A. Loskutoff D.J. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 6351-6355Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 43Strandberg L.

Chem. 1991; 266: 13852-13858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we used PAI-1 radioiodinated with Iodobeads in the preliminary experiments because (a) this preparation contained a population of active PAI-1 molecules (corresponding to ∼35% of total PAI-1) that formed SDS-stable complexes with tPA, (b)125I-PAI-1 bound efficiently to vitronectin, which is known to bind with high affinity only active PAI-1 (12Kruithof E.K. Nicolosa G. Bachmann F. Blood. 1987; 70: 1645-1653Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and (c)125I-PAI-1 binding to α1-acid glycoprotein tested in fresh human blood plasma was competed by unlabeled active PAI-1, and the complex was not precipitated by nonspecific antibodies (Fig. 1 B). Formation of the complex between α1-acid glycoprotein and PAI-1 was further evidenced in the second system, in which α1-acid glycoprotein was labeled, and the complex was precipitated with antibodies specific to PAI-1 (Fig. 2 A). To examine whether such a complex can also be formed in blood plasma, two samples of standard human blood plasma provided with the Imulyse"

Chem. 1997; 272: 6898-6902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The PAR-1-mediated increase in intracellular calcium has been linked to coupling of the second intracellular loop of PAR-1 to Gαq (14Verrall S. Ishii M. Chen M. Wang L. Tram T. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6898-6902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). On the other hand, PAR-1-mediated activation of RhoA and the subsequent morphological changes involve activation of Gα12/13 (3Seasholtz T.M. Majumdar M. Brown J.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 949-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Recently, we showed that the PAR-1 cytoplasmic tail (C-tail) may be important for the regulation of cytoskeletal changes (16Mahajan V.B. Pai K.S. Lau A. Cunningham D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12062-12067Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). It is not known how PAR-1 transduces these diverse signals intracellularly. Hsp90 is a chaperone molecule widely expressed in cells of various species that plays a key role in signal transduction under non-stress conditions and in protein renaturation and refolding under stress (17Rutherford S.L. Zuker C.S. Cell. 1994; 79: 1129-1132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 18Bohen S.P. Kralli A. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1995; 268: 1303-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 19Pratt W.B. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 297-326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By forming heterocomplexes with its substrates, Hsp90 has been shown to be important for various signaling events. In yeast andDrosophila, the Hsp90 counterparts Hsp82 and Hsp83 are required for steroid receptor, v-Src, and tyrosine kinase signaling events (20Xu Y. Lindquist S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7074-7078Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 21Cutforth T. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1994; 77: 1027-1036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 22Nathan D.F. Lindquist S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3917-3925Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, Hsp90 association with Raf, MEK, and Src family proteins is required for signaling (19Pratt W.B. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 297-326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The significance of these interactions was examined with the antitumor agent geldanamycin, which binds specifically to Hsp90 and disrupts interactions between the chaperone and associated proteins (19Pratt W.B. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 297-326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Stebbins C.E. Russo A.A. Schneider C. Rosen N. Hartl F.U. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1997; 89: 239-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1247) Google Scholar). Hsp90 has also been shown to facilitate G protein-coupled pathways (24Garcia-Cardena G. Fan R. Shah V. Sorrentino R. Cirino G. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W.C. Nature. 1998; 392: 821-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar), but whether Hsp90 directly regulates G protein-coupled receptors is not known. We used a yeast two-hybrid system to identify molecules that directly interact with the PAR-1 C-tail and regulate thrombin signaling. Hsp90 was found to interact specifically with the PAR-1 C-tail in the yeast system. The interaction was confirmed by various in vitroand in vivo assays. The physiological significance of the interaction was examined by carrying out morphological and biochemical studies in astrocytes and neuronal cells. Thrombin was purchased from Calbiochem. Polyclonal antibody for PAR-1 was a gift from Marschal Runge (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC). A second anti-PAR-1 antibody (BIODESIGN International) was used for immunoblot analysis. Antibodies for RhoA and GST were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), and anti-Hsp90 antibody was obtained from Stressgen (Victoria, Canada). The GST/Rhotekin-binding domain construct was a gift from Martin Schwartz (Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA). Geldanamycin was provided by NCI (Rockville, MD). The polymerase chain reaction product of the human PAR-1 C-tail (residues 375–425) cloned into the NdeI and SalI sites of the Gal4 DNA-binding vector pAS2-1 was used as a bait vector. A human fetal brain cDNA library (CLONTECH) fused to the Gal4 activation domain in pGAD10 was used as a trap vector in yeast two-hybrid screening. The plasmids were transformed into yeast Y190 cells, and positive clones were selected on triple-minus plates (leu− trp− his−). Assays for β-galactosidase activity were carried out on these clones using a filter lift method according to the manufacturer's instructions (CLONTECH). Interactions were confirmed by re-transforming the β-galactosidase-positive clones with either the bait vector or the original pAS2-1 vector (backbone) into yeast. Oligonucleotides for cytoplasmic loop (CL) 1 (residues 119–135), CL2 (residues 199–218), and CL3 (residues 289–311) were cloned into pAS2-1 and transformed into yeast containing Hsp90/Gal4 activation domain fusion cDNA (positive clone). A β-galactosidase filter lift assay was carried out on triple-minus plates as described above. The human PAR-1 C-tail was subcloned in-frame into the GST fusion construct pGEX4T-3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). GST fusion constructs were transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3), and expression was induced by addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Fusion proteins were purified using glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Purified Hsp90 (100 pmol; Stressgen) was added to 0.1 ml of incubation buffer A (10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 50 mmKCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm sodium molybdate, 5 mm ATP, 100 mm NaCl, and 1% Nonidet P-40) containing GST fusion protein immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose, incubated overnight at 4 °C, and washed three times with incubation buffer A. Bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-Hsp90 antibody. A filter overlay assay was performed as described (25Li M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Science. 1992; 257: 1225-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1–2 µg of Hsp90 were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto nitrocellulose. The filter was rinsed in incubation buffer B (10 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 60 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm2-mercaptoethanol) for 5 min and then exposed for 10 min each to decreasing concentrations of guanidine HCl (6, 3, 1.5, 0.75, 0.38, 0.19, 0.1, and 0 m) in incubation buffer B. The filter was then exposed to incubation buffer B containing 5% dehydrated milk and 1% Nonidet P-40 for 1 h, and the incubation was continued for another 60 min in the same buffer supplemented with 1% dehydrated milk, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 1% bovine serum albumin. The filter was treated with either 0.5 µg/ml GST or GST/C-tail overnight at 4 °C in incubation buffer B supplemented with 1% dehydrated milk, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% bovine serum albumin, 5 mm ATP, and 20 mm sodium molybdate. Following incubation, the filter was washed three times, and the bound C-tail was detected by antibody against GST. Primary astrocyte cultures were prepared from brain cortex of 1- or 2-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats (5Vaughan P.J. Pike C.J. Cotman C.W. Cunningham D.D. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 5389-5401Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,7Donovan F.M. Cunningham D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12746-12752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Cultured astrocytes were incubated overnight in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and solubilized in immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 1 mm EGTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 µg/ml aprotinin, 10 µg/ml pepstatin, and 10 µg/ml leupeptin) as described earlier (16Mahajan V.B. Pai K.S. Lau A. Cunningham D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12062-12067Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The supernatant was immunoprecipitated with either control antibody (rabbit IgG) or anti-PAR-1 antibody generated against the SFLLRN peptide (16Mahajan V.B. Pai K.S. Lau A. Cunningham D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12062-12067Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) overnight at 4 °C in the presence of protein A-Sepharose. Immunoprecipitated PAR-1 was detected by Western blotting with a second antibody (BIODESIGN International). Proteins bound to the beads were washed three times with immunoprecipitation buffer, eluted with SDS sample buffer, resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE, and subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-Hsp90 antibody. Rat astrocyte cultures were used for morphological studies as described previously (16Mahajan V.B. Pai K.S. Lau A. Cunningham D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12062-12067Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 26Grabham P. Cunningham D.D. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 583-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Briefly, cultures were seeded at a density of 9.6 × 105 cells in a 22-mm 12-well plate and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum for 10 h. Cultures were rinsed and differentiated in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1.5 mm dibutyryl cAMP for 2 h; astrocytes developed a stellate morphology. Geldanamycin was added 2–3 h prior to thrombin (10 pm) treatment. Astrocytes with a stellate morphology were counted 2 h after thrombin addition. About 300–400 cells were counted in each experiment, which were run in duplicate. Experiments were repeated three to four times. Statistical analysis was carried out using one-way analysis of variance. Antisense (5′-CACUUCCUCAGGCAUCUUGA-3′) and reverse (5′-TCAAGATGCC-TGAGGAAGTG-3′) oligonucleotides for Hsp90 were obtained from Sequitur (Natick, MA) and were designed according to an earlier published study (27Conconi M. Petropoulos I. Emod I. Turlin E. Biville F. Friguet B. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 407-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were transfected into primary astrocytes with Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 1 h according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 18 h of transfection, cells were differentiated in 1.5 mm dibutyryl cAMP for 2 h. Cell morphology were examined in ∼200 cells as described above following thrombin (10 pm) addition for 2 h. Astrocytes subjected to various treatments were also immunoblotted with anti-Hsp90 antibody to monitor the expression levels of the protein. The rat PAR-1 C-tail was cloned into the pIRES-EGFP vector (CLONTECH) at theNdeI and SalI sites. Neuronal cells (5 × 105) of human retina origin (Ad12HER10 retinoblasts) were seeded in four-well Lab-Tek II slides and cultured for 18 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Transient transfections were performed for 6 h using 0.5 µg of DNA mixed with 4 µl of Novafector (Venn Nova, Pompano Beach, FL) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After 18 h, cells were differentiated with 2 mmdibutyryl cAMP in serum-free medium for 6 h. Following addition of thrombin (160 nm) for 2 h, the cells were fixed, and morphology of the fluorescent cells was quantitated (16Mahajan V.B. Pai K.S. Lau A. Cunningham D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12062-12067Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Neuronal cells respond to thrombin at low concentrations (10 pm) when grown on plastic dishes, whereas higher amounts (160 nm) of the protease are required when grown on glass coverslips used for the transfection studies. About 20–30% of the cells was transfected in most experiments. Control cells showed a refractile, mostly round morphology, whereas the thrombin-treated cells showed a flat morphology. Approximately 80–100 transfected cells were counted blindly for each of the treatments, and the experiments were repeated three times. Statistical analysis was carried out using the one-tailed t test. Active RhoA levels were measured in primary rat astrocyte cultures as described (28Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar). Astrocyte cultures were pretreated with geldanamycin (17.5 µm) for 2 h prior to thrombin (10 pm) addition. Cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.2), 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 µg/ml each leupeptin and aprotinin). Cell lysates were centrifuged at 13000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the clear supernatants were incubated with GST/Rhotekin-binding domain (20–30 µg) for 45 min. The beads were washed three times with Tris buffer (50 mmTris (pH 7.2), 500 mm NaCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 µg/ml each leupeptin and aprotinin), and the bound proteins were immunoprobed with anti-RhoA antibody. Astrocytes were cultured in 96-well plates (Costar Corp.) and treated with 20 µmgeldanamycin for 2 h. Cell medium was decanted and replaced with Fluo-3/AM (Molecular Probes, Inc.) in 100 µl of loading buffer (130 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 5 mm KCl, 10 mm glucose, 0.45 mmKH2PO4, 8 mm MgSO4, 4.2 mm NaHCO3, 20 mm HEPES, and 10 µm probenecid) with 1% fetal calf serum for 1 h. Cells were rinsed with loading buffer, and each 96-well plate was placed into a fluorometric imaging plate reader (Molecular Devices, Inc.). Some wells received 1 µmU73122 (BIOMOL Research Labs Inc.) for 10 min prior to 10 pm thrombin and 10 mm EDTA injection. The relative intracellular calcium levels were monitored at 488 nm for 210 s in four to eight identically treated wells as described earlier (16Mahajan V.B. Pai K.S. Lau A. Cunningham D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12062-12067Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). To identify molecular components in PAR-1 signaling events, we used the 50-amino acid C-tail of human PAR-1 as bait in a yeast two-hybrid system (16Mahajan V.B. Pai K.S. Lau A. Cunningham D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12062-12067Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Of the 3.5 × 106 clones screened using a human fetal brain library, one was positive in a β-galactosidase filter lift assay. Sequencing and BLAST analysis revealed the cDNA clone to be identical to the 3′-region (amino acids 369–721) of Hsp90, a chaperone protein that plays a key role in signaling and protein renaturation and refolding (17Rutherford S.L. Zuker C.S. Cell. 1994; 79: 1129-1132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 18Bohen S.P. Kralli A. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1995; 268: 1303-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 19Pratt W.B. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 297-326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The interaction between Hsp90 and the PAR-1 C-tail was found to be specific since co-transformation of the isolated Hsp90/Gal4 activation domain clone with the Gal4 DNA-binding vector alone or transformation of the Hsp90/Gal4 activation domain clone alone in yeast did not activate the β-galactosidase reporter gene (Fig.1). To determine if other intracellular regions of PAR-1 interact with Hsp90, CL1, CL2, and CL3 were co-transformed with the Hsp90/Gal4 activation domain clone into yeast. As shown in Fig. 1, CL1, CL2, and CL3 were not positive in the β-galactosidase filter lift assay, indicating that Hsp90 specifically interacted in yeast with only the PAR-1 C-tail. The interaction between the PAR-1 C-tail and Hsp90 in yeast was confirmed by two separate in vitro assays. First, purified Hsp90 was incubated with bacterially expressed, partially purified GST or with a GST fusion of the PAR-1 C-tail bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads in a pull-down assay (16Mahajan V.B. Pai K.S. Lau A. Cunningham D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12062-12067Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis of the bound proteins using anti-Hsp90 antibody revealed that Hsp90 bound specifically to GST/C-tail fusion protein (Fig.2A). A similar result was observed in a second in vitro overlay assay (25Li M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Science. 1992; 257: 1225-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar), wherein purified Hsp90 was subjected to SDS-PAGE, blotted, overlaid with either GST or GST/C-tail fusion protein, and probed with anti-GST antibody (Fig. 2 B). These results demonstrate that the PAR-1 C-tail interacts with Hsp90 in a cell-free system. To determine if full-length PAR-1 interacts with Hsp90 in vivo, PAR-1 was immunoprecipitated as described previously (16Mahajan V.B. Pai K.S. Lau A. Cunningham D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12062-12067Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) from primary cultures of astrocytes, which are known to express PAR-1 (29Weinstein J.R. Gold S.J. Cunningham D.D. Gall C.M. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 2906-2919Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 C, anti-PAR-1 antibody specifically co-immunoprecipitated Hsp90 from astrocyte cultures (second lane), whereas the control antibody (IgG) did not (first lane). Competition with the SFLLRN peptide, against which the anti-PAR-1 antibody was developed, blocked co-immunoprecipitation of Hsp90 from astrocyte cultures (third lane). We also utilized geldanamycin, a small molecule that specifically binds the ATP-binding pocket in Hsp90 (but not other chaperones), alters the tertiary structure of Hsp90, and prevents Hsp90 interactions with target proteins (23Stebbins C.E. Russo A.A. Schneider C. Rosen N. Hartl F.U. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1997; 89: 239-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1247) Google Scholar). After treatment with geldanamycin (10 µm), PAR-1 no longer co-precipitated Hsp90 (fourth lane), indicating that the interaction between PAR-1 and Hsp90 was disrupted. These experiments suggest that PAR-1 exists in a complex with Hsp90 under physiological, non-stress conditions. To examine the role of Hsp90 in PAR-1 signaling, we decreased its expression by an antisense strategy as previously described (27Conconi M. Petropoulos I. Emod I. Turlin E. Biville F. Friguet B. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 407-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Primary astrocyte cultures were used for the antisense study since they express abundant PAR-1, and their morphology is regulated by thrombin (26Grabham P. Cunningham D.D. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 583-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 30Suidan H.S. Stone S.R. Hemmings B.A. Monard D. Neuron. 1992; 8: 363-375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Cultured astrocytes showed a stellate morphology with numerous processes extending from the cell soma, but upon addition of thrombin (10 pm), the processes retracted, and the cells bodies spread and appeared non-stellate (Fig.3A) (13Suidan H.S. Nobes C.D. Hall A. Monard D. Glia. 1997; 21: 244-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 16Mahajan V.B. Pai K.S. Lau A. Cunningham D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12062-12067Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Consistent with the previous studies, transfection of Hsp90 antisense oligonucleotides into astrocyte cultures significantly decreased Hsp90 expression levels as measured by Western blotting (Fig. 3 B, inset). When astrocyte cultures treated with Hsp90 antisense oligonucleotides were challenged with thrombin (10 pm), they no longer responded, and >75% of the cells showed a stellate morphology (Fig.3, A and B). To determine the specificity of the antisense oligonucleotides, cells were treated with reverse oligonucleotides, and the thrombin effect was monitored. As shown in Fig. 3 B, reverse oligonucleotides did not change the expression of Hsp90 and had no significant effect on morphological changes induced by thrombin compared with vehicle controls. These results suggest that Hsp90 may be required for thrombin-mediated morphological changes. Since oligonucleotides may have nonspecific effects, an alternative approach was used to examine the role of Hsp90 in thrombin-mediated morphological changes. Addition of geldanamycin alone to astrocyte cultures did not alter morphology compared with control cells. However, geldanamycin abrogated thrombin-induced astrocyte spreading and conversion to a non-stellate morphology (Fig.3 C). The effect was concentration-dependent; and at the highest concentration of geldanamycin, >80% of the cells showed a stellate morphology. Thus, two different mechanistic approaches of Hsp90 inhibition displayed identical phenotypes, and PAR-1 signaling to the cytoskeleton was prevented. To explore whether proteins such as Hsp90 that bind the PAR-1 C-tail are important for signaling, human neuronal cells (Ad12HER10) were transfected with C-tail overexpression constructs to specifically disrupt the endogenous PAR-1 interaction with Hsp90. This strategy has been applied in several seven-transmembrane receptor studies (31Luttrell L.M. Ostrowski J. Cotecchia S. Kendall H. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1993; 259: 1453-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and was preferred over the transfection of PAR-1 C-tail truncation mutants since the cells under examination contain endogenous PAR-1 (29Weinstein J.R. Gold S.J. Cunningham D.D. Gall C.M. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 2906-2919Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and our goal was to perform a morphological evaluation of the cellular response. In an established transfection and morphological assay (16Mahajan V.B. Pai K.S. Lau A. Cunningham D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12062-12067Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), transfected cells were identified by the independent expression of enhanced green fluorescent protein from a single bicistronic mRNA. Transfected cultures were treated with thrombin (160 nm), and morphological changes in the fluorescent cells were examined. Cells transfected with vector alone showed a round, refractile body surrounded by a bright white halo (Fig.4, A and B). Thrombin-treated transfected cells expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein alone showed a non-refractile, flat cell body with increased diameters (Fig. 4, C and D). Overexpression of the C-tail blocked thrombin-mediated flattening of cells, and ∼50% of the transfected cells remained round and refractile (Fig. 4, E and F). However, overexpression of CL2 of PAR-1, which was shown to be required for thrombin-induced intracellular calcium signaling (14Verrall S. Ishii M. Chen M. Wang L. Tram T. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6898-6902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), did not prevent thrombin-induced morphological changes, and the cells remained flat and non-refractile (Fig. 4 G). Taken together, these results strongly suggest that the PAR-1 C-tail, but not CL2, is necessary for thrombin-induced morphological changes. Thrombin-induced changes in astrocyte morphology are mediated by RhoA, a small GTP-binding protein (3Seasholtz T.M. Majumdar M. Brown J.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 949-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 13Suidan H.S. Nobes C.D. Hall A. Monard D. Glia. 1997; 21: 244-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). If Hsp90 were an essential component of initial PAR-1 signaling, we hypothesized that geldanamycin treatment would prevent thrombin-induced RhoA activation. In this study, a GST fusion of the Rho-binding dom"

Here, we show that a synthetic peptide modeled after this transmembrane segment drives liposome-liposome fusion. Addition of millimolar Ca2+ concentrations strongly potentiated the effect of the peptides suggesting that Ca2+-mediated liposome aggregation supports the activity of the peptide. Peptide-driven fusion was suppressed by lysolipid, an established inhibitor of natural membrane fusion, and involved inner and outer leaflets of the liposomal bilayer. Thus, transmembrane segment peptide-driven liposome fusion exhibits important hallmarks characteristic of natural membrane fusion. Importantly, the mutations previously shown to attenuate the function of full-length G-protein in cell-cell fusion also attenuated the fusogenicity of the peptide, albeit in a less pronounced fashion. Therefore, the function of the peptide mimic is dependent on its primary structure, similar to full-length G-protein. Together, our data suggest that the G-protein transmembrane segment is an autonomous functional domain.

Cell Biol. 1996; 12: 627-661Crossref Scopus (504) Google Scholar). These viral fusion proteins consist of an ectodomain harboring an amphipathic fusion peptide, a single transmembrane segment (TMS),1 and a cytoplasmic domain. All these domains appear to cooperate in fusion protein function (2Lentz B.R. Malinin V. Haque M.E. Evans K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 607-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 3Kozerski C. Ponimaskin E. Schroth-Diez B. Schmidt M.F.G. Herrmann A. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 395-404Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In the case of influenza hemagglutinin (HA), a pH-driven global conformational change of the ectodomain is thought to eject the fusion peptide toward the target bilayer to establish initial contact between both membranes (4Bullough P.A. Hughson F.M. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1994; 371: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (1368) Google Scholar). Synthetic versions of many of these soluble fusion peptides drive liposome-liposome fusion in vitro. Furthermore, the fusogenic function of some synthetic fusion peptides is sensitive to point mutations in a similar fashion as the corresponding full-length fusion proteins (2Lentz B.R. Malinin V. Haque M.E. Evans K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 607-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 5Durell S.R. Martin I. Ruysschaert J.-M. Shai Y. Blumenthal R. Mol. Mem.

Therefore, they appear to be partially independent functional domains whose interaction with target membranes is an early event initiating fusion.A late role in fusion protein function has been ascribed to the TMSs. For example, upon replacement of the TMS by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol membrane anchor (7Kemble G.W. Danieli T. White J.M. Cell. 1994; 76: 383-391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 8Nüssler F. Clague M.J. Herrmann A. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 2280-2291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) or by mutating (9Melikyan G.B. Lin S.S. Roth M.G. Cohen F.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 6: 1821-1836Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar) its TMS, it was initially reported that influenza HA looses its ability to mediate complete bilayer fusion but retains hemifusion, i.e. lipid mixing of the contacting monolayers (7Kemble G.W. Danieli T. White J.M. Cell. 1994; 76: 383-391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). More recently, lipid-anchored HA was found to induce an aqueous continuity between fusion compartments which, however, formed less efficiently and did not enlarge substantially compared with wild-type (wt) HA. Consequently, the HA TMS was suggested to favor pore formation and growth (10Markosyan R.M. Cohen F.S. Melikyan G.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1143-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained with a point mutant (11Melikyan G.B. Markosyan R.M. Roth M.G. Cohen F.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3765-3775Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In another study, shortening the HA TMS reduced its ability to support the hemifusion to fusion transition whereas point mutations were without effect (12Armstrong R.T. Kushnir A.S. White J.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 425-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the function of other fusion proteins derived from the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 envelope glycoprotein (13Owens R.J. Burke C. Rose J.K. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 570-574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or the Moloney murine leukemia virus (14Taylor G.M. Sanders D.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2803-2815Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) was compromized by mutations within the TMSs.The trimeric vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) G-protein is a fusion protein that is functionally and structurally related to influenza HA. Replacement of the VSV G-protein TMS by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor rendered this protein non-fusogenic, suggesting that its function requires membrane anchoring by a hydrophobic peptide sequence (15Odell D. Wanas E. Yan J. Ghosh H.P. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 7996-8000Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, a 6-residue deletion or point mutations within the TMS attenuated the fusogenicity of VSV G-protein as indicated by reduced transfer of cytoplasmic contents between fusing cells. However, the mutant proteins were shown to retain hemifusion activity since lipid probes within the external leaflets of the reacting membranes mixed (16Cleverley D.Z. Lenard J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3425-3430Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Similar to the case of influenza HA, the TMS of VSV G-protein is therefore thought to act at a late step in membrane fusion.Here, we demonstrate that incorporation of a synthetic peptide corresponding to the VSV G-protein TMS into liposomal membranes dramatically increases their ability to fuse. Interestingly, those mutations previously shown to affect full-length VSV G-protein function in HeLa cells also attenuated TMS-peptide-induced liposome-liposome fusion. Thus, the TMS-peptide exhibits sequence-specific fusogenicity in the absence of the ectodomains and thus appears to be an independent functional domain.DISCUSSIONOur results demonstrate that incorporation of synthetic peptides modeled after the TMS of VSV G-protein into the membranes of synthetic liposomes strongly increases their ability to fuse. These peptides represent the central hydrophobic part of the predicted TMS which is located between lysine 462 and arginine 483. Since the hydrophobicity of our peptides is rather symmetrically distributed, we assume that they fully insert as α-helices into liposomal membranes. This is supported by previous studies where the ability of other lysine-bordered hydrophobic peptides to incorporate into lipid bilayers was tested. Huschilt et al. (20Huschilt J.C. Millman B.M. Davis J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 979: 139-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) found that a KKGL16KK peptide inserted as an α-helix at a perpendicular angle into dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine membranes. Furthermore, Webb et al. (29Webb R.J. East M. Sharma R.P. Lee A.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 673-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) established that a hydrophobic peptide core of 17 residues fully incorporated into a membrane composed of lipids with C18 acyl chains. The efficiency of these relatively short peptides to integrate into membranes is ascribed to the flexibility of the hydrophobic part of the bordering lysine side chains. This flexibility allows the charged termini to “snorkel up” toward the lipid head group regions. In a previous model study, the lysine termini bordering 17 hydrophobic residues adopting an α-helical conformation have been calculated to extend up to 1.9 nm from the bilayer center (22de Planque M.R. Kruijtzer J.A. Liskamp R.M. Marsh D. Greathouse D.V. Koeppe 2nd, R.E. de Kruijff B. Killian J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20839-20846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). By analogy to these model systems, our TMS peptides containing 16 hydrophobic amino acids are likely to span the hydrophobic core of liposomal membranes that are composed of natural lipids which contain mostly C18 lipid acyl chains.This in vitro fusion system consisting only of lipids and TMS-peptides appears to display characteristic hallmarks of biological membrane fusion. First, its sensitivity to lysolipid is consistent with the transient existence of a hemifusion state, which is thought to precede complete bilayer merger (2Lentz B.R. Malinin V. Haque M.E. Evans K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 607-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 24Chernomordik L. Kozlov M.M. Zimmerberg J. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 146: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Second, TMS-peptide-driven fusion involves both bilayer leaflets as shown upon bleaching the NBD fluorophore of the outer leaflet by dithionite. Third, both extent and initial rate of fusion are enhanced by Ca2+-mediated liposome aggregation, thus suggesting that fusion promotion by the peptides is potentiated by membrane proximity.Importantly, mutating the glycine residues within the TMS-peptide attenuated its fusogenicity to various degrees depending on the number of exchanges made, the type of introduced residue, and the P/L ratio of the proteoliposomes. Since glycine mutations had previously been shown to affect cell-cell fusion mediated by full-length VSV G-protein (16Cleverley D.Z. Lenard J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3425-3430Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), our liposome-based in vitro approach appears to reflect, at least in part, the sequence specificity of full-length fusion protein function.In analogy to results obtained with influenza HA TMS mutants (9Melikyan G.B. Lin S.S. Roth M.G. Cohen F.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 6: 1821-1836Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar), the VSV G-protein TMS has previously been shown to function late in the fusion process (16Cleverley D.Z. Lenard J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3425-3430Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). This late step appears to correspond to the conversion of the hemifusion intermediate to fully fused bilayers and is thought to be facilitated by the TMS. It should be noted that the extent of fluorescence dequenching seen here with pure liposomes,i.e. without added peptide, was reduced to an average of 60% upon outer leaflet bleaching. 3D. Langosch and B. Brosig, unpublished data. This suggests that a substantial fraction of peptide-independent spontaneous liposome fusion does not proceed beyond hemifusion. We speculate, therefore, that the hemifusion diaphragm may form spontaneously from randomly colliding liposomes. Its transition to full fusion, however, appears to be facilitated by the TMS-peptides.What is the characteristic feature of the TMS which drives this transition and which is required for optimal fusion protein function? The TMSs of fusion proteins are expected to be inserted as α-helices at orientations close to the membrane normal as demonstrated for the influenza HA TMS (30Tatulian S.A. Tamm L.K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 496-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). A comparison of the amino acid composition of fusogenic and non-fusogenic viral membrane protein TMSs revealed that glycine residues are strongly over-represented in the former (16Cleverley D.Z. Lenard J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3425-3430Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). It was therefore speculated that the functionally relevant glycines of the VSV G-protein might allow for bending of the TMS helices during the fusion process (16Cleverley D.Z. Lenard J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3425-3430Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Indeed, glycine residues have previously been shown to destabilize α-helical hydrophobic peptides in membrane-mimetic environments (31Li S.C. Deber C.M. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1992; 40: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). On the other hand, isoleucine was the single other residue type that was also significantly overrepresented in fusogenic TMSs (16Cleverley D.Z. Lenard J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3425-3430Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in our A3 or L5 peptide mutants, two or four isoleucines were exchanged for alanine or leucine, respectively, and this resulted in a marked decrease of fusogenicity despite the continued presence of both glycine residues. Isoleucine ranks among those residues with the highest propensities to form β-sheet structures (32Smith C.K. Withka J.M. Regan L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5510-5517Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 33Street A.G. Mayo S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9074-9076Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). This property was ascribed to steric interference of its β-branched side chain with the local polypeptide backbone which may destabilize the α-helical conformation (33Street A.G. Mayo S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9074-9076Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Although isoleucine has been reported not to interfere with α-helix formation in hydrophobic environments (23Li S.C. Deber C.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 368-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar,34Liu L.-P. Deber C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23645-23648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), it is tempting to speculate that not only glycine, but also isoleucine or other residues with β-branched side chains, impart structural flexibility to fusogenic TMS helices. Thus, local deformation or even transient unfolding of these helices may facilitate the restructuring of the lipid bilayer in fusion. It might be relevant in this context that the α-helical synthetic peptide corresponding to the influenza HA TMS increased the acyl chain order of a lipid bilayer (30Tatulian S.A. Tamm L.K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 496-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar).On the other hand, it should be noted that the fusogenic function of VSV G-protein (15Odell D. Wanas E. Yan J. Ghosh H.P. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 7996-8000Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), influenza HA (9Melikyan G.B. Lin S.S. Roth M.G. Cohen F.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 6: 1821-1836Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar), or the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 envelope glycoprotein (35Wilk T. Pfeiffer T. Bukovsky A. Moldenhauser G. Bosch V. Virology. 1996; 76: 539-553Google Scholar) was maintained upon replacement of the respective TMS by unrelated TMSs (9Melikyan G.B. Lin S.S. Roth M.G. Cohen F.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 6: 1821-1836Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 15Odell D. Wanas E. Yan J. Ghosh H.P. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 7996-8000Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This is an apparent contradiction to the effects of TMS point mutations as discussed above. The data may be reconciled, however, if one assumes that the structural feature(s) rendering a TMS compatible with fusion protein function are shared by certain unrelated TMSs which would be inactive in their normal contexts (2Lentz B.R. Malinin V. Haque M.E. Evans K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 607-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 14Taylor G.M. Sanders D.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2803-2815Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).The fusogenic capacity of synthetic TMSs appears not to be restricted to the VSV G-protein. In another study,2 we found that peptides modeled after the TMSs of SNARE proteins also drive liposome-liposome fusion in a sequence-specific fashion. As SNARE proteins are essential for membrane fusion in the secretory pathway of eukaryotic cells (36Jahn R. Südhof T.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 863-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar), functional autonomy of TMSs may be a phenomenon relevant for both viral and cellular fusion proteins. Biological membrane fusion involves a restructuring of lipid bilayers brought into close proximity by membrane-anchored fusion proteins. To date, the most thoroughly characterized fusion proteins are those which mediate fusion of viral envelopes with cellular membranes (1Hernandez L.D. Hoffman L.R. Wolfsberg T.G. White J.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1996; 12: 627-661Crossref Scopus (504) Google Scholar). These viral fusion proteins consist of an ectodomain harboring an amphipathic fusion peptide, a single transmembrane segment (TMS),1 and a cytoplasmic domain. All these domains appear to cooperate in fusion protein function (2Lentz B.R. Malinin V. Haque M.E. Evans K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 607-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 3Kozerski C. Ponimaskin E. Schroth-Diez B. Schmidt M.F.G. Herrmann A. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 395-404Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In the case of influenza hemagglutinin (HA), a pH-driven global conformational change of the ectodomain is thought to eject the fusion peptide toward the target bilayer to establish initial contact between both membranes (4Bullough P.A. Hughson F.M. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1994; 371: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (1368) Google Scholar). Synthetic versions of many of these soluble fusion peptides drive liposome-liposome fusion in vitro. Furthermore, the fusogenic function of some synthetic fusion peptides is sensitive to point mutations in a similar fashion as the corresponding full-length fusion proteins (2Lentz B.R. Malinin V. Haque M.E. Evans K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 607-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 5Durell S.R. Martin I. Ruysschaert J.-M. Shai Y. Blumenthal R. Mol. Mem.

Therefore, they appear to be partially independent functional domains whose interaction with target membranes is an early event initiating fusion. A late role in fusion protein function has been ascribed to the TMSs. For example, upon replacement of the TMS by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol membrane anchor (7Kemble G.W. Danieli T. White J.M.

Cell. 1999; 10: 2803-2815Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) was compromized by mutations within the TMSs.

Interestingly, in our A3 or L5 peptide mutants, two or four isoleucines were exchanged for alanine or leucine, respectively, and this resulted in a marked decrease of fusogenicity despite the continued presence of both glycine residues. Isoleucine ranks among those residues with the highest propensities to form β-sheet structures (32Smith C.K. Withka J.M. Regan L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5510-5517Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 33Street A.G. Mayo S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9074-9076Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). This property was ascribed to steric interference of its β-branched side chain with the local polypeptide backbone which may destabilize the α-helical conformation (33Street A.G. Mayo S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9074-9076Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Although isoleucine has been reported not to interfere with α-helix formation in hydrophobic environments (23Li S.C. Deber C.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 368-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar,34Liu L.-P. Deber C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23645-23648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), it is tempting to speculate that not only glycine, but also isoleucine or other residues with β-branched side chains, impart structural flexibility to fusogenic TMS helices. Thus, local deformation or even transient unfolding of these helices may facilitate the restructuring of the lipid bilayer in fusion. It might be relevant in this context that the α-helical synthetic peptide corresponding to the influenza HA TMS increased the acyl chain order of a lipid bilayer (30Tatulian S.A. Tamm L.K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 496-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar).On the other hand, it should be noted that the fusogenic function of VSV G-protein (15Odell D. Wanas E. Yan J. Ghosh H.P. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 7996-8000Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), influenza HA (9Melikyan G.B. Lin S.S. Roth M.G. Cohen F.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 6: 1821-1836Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar), or the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 envelope glycoprotein (35Wilk T. Pfeiffer T. Bukovsky A. Moldenhauser G. Bosch V. Virology. 1996; 76: 539-553Google Scholar) was maintained upon replacement of the respective TMS by unrelated TMSs (9Melikyan G.B. Lin S.S. Roth M.G. Cohen F.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 6: 1821-1836Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 15Odell D. Wanas E. Yan J. Ghosh H.P. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 7996-8000Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This is an apparent contradiction to the effects of TMS point mutations as discussed above. The data may be reconciled, however, if one assumes that the structural feature(s) rendering a TMS compatible with fusion protein function are shared by certain unrelated TMSs which would be inactive in their normal contexts (2Lentz B.R. Malinin V. Haque M.E. Evans K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 607-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 14Taylor G.M. Sanders D.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2803-2815Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).The fusogenic capacity of synthetic TMSs appears not to be restricted to the VSV G-protein. In another study,2 we found that peptides modeled after the TMSs of SNARE proteins also drive liposome-liposome fusion in a sequence-specific fashion. As SNARE proteins are essential for membrane fusion in the secretory pathway of eukaryotic cells (36Jahn R. Südhof T.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 863-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar), functional autonomy of TMSs may be a phenomenon relevant for both viral and cellular fusion proteins. Our results demonstrate that incorporation of synthetic peptides modeled after the TMS of VSV G-protein into the membranes of synthetic liposomes strongly increases their ability to fuse. These peptides represent the central hydrophobic part of the predicted TMS which is located between lysine 462 and arginine 483. Since the hydrophobicity of our peptides is rather symmetrically distributed, we assume that they fully insert as α-helices into liposomal membranes. This is supported by previous studies where the ability of other lysine-bordered hydrophobic peptides to incorporate into lipid bilayers was tested. Huschilt et al. (20Huschilt J.C. Millman B.M. Davis J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 979: 139-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) found that a KKGL16KK peptide inserted as an α-helix at a perpendicular angle into dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine membranes. Furthermore, Webb et al. (29Webb R.J. East M. Sharma R.P. Lee A.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 673-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) established that a hydrophobic peptide core of 17 residues fully incorporated into a membrane composed of lipids with C18 acyl chains. The efficiency of these relatively short peptides to integrate into membranes is ascribed to the flexibility of the hydrophobic part of the bordering lysine side chains. This flexibility allows the charged termini to “snorkel up” toward the lipid head group regions. In a previous model study, the lysine termini bordering 17 hydrophobic residues adopting an α-helical conformation have been calculated to extend up to 1.9 nm from the bilayer center (22de Planque M.R. Kruijtzer J.A. Liskamp R.M. Marsh D. Greathouse D.V. Koeppe 2nd, R.E. de Kruijff B. Killian J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20839-20846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). By analogy to these model systems, our TMS peptides containing 16 hydrophobic amino acids are likely to span the hydrophobic core of liposomal membranes that are composed of natural lipids which contain mostly C18 lipid acyl chains. This in vitro fusion system consisting only of lipids and TMS-peptides appears to display characteristic hallmarks of biological membrane fusion. First, its sensitivity to lysolipid is consistent with the transient existence of a hemifusion state, which is thought to precede complete bilayer merger (2Lentz B.R. Malinin V. Haque M.E. Evans K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 607-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 24Chernomordik L. Kozlov M.M. Zimmerberg J. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 146: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Second, TMS-peptide-driven fusion involves both bilayer leaflets as shown upon bleaching the NBD fluorophore of the outer leaflet by dithionite. Third, both extent and initial rate of fusion are enhanced by Ca2+-mediated liposome aggregation, thus suggesting that fusion promotion by the peptides is potentiated by membrane proximity. Importantly, mutating the glycine residues within the TMS-peptide attenuated its fusogenicity to various degrees depending on the number of exchanges made, the type of introduced residue, and the P/L ratio of the proteoliposomes. Since glycine mutations had previously been shown to affect cell-cell fusion mediated by full-length VSV G-protein (16Cleverley D.Z. Lenard J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3425-3430Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), our liposome-based in vitro approach appears to reflect, at least in part, the sequence specificity of full-length fusion protein function. In analogy to results obtained with influenza HA TMS mutants (9Melikyan G.B. Lin S.S. Roth M.G. Cohen F.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 6: 1821-1836Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar), the VSV G-protein TMS has previously been shown to function late in the fusion process (16Cleverley D.Z. Lenard J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3425-3430Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). This late step appears to correspond to the conversion of the hemifusion intermediate to fully fused bilayers and is thought to be facilitated by the TMS. It should be noted that the extent of fluorescence dequenching seen here with pure liposomes,i.e. without added peptide, was reduced to an average of 60% upon outer leaflet bleaching. 3D. Langosch and B. Brosig, unpublished data. This suggests that a substantial fraction of peptide-independent spontaneous liposome fusion does not proceed beyond hemifusion. We speculate, therefore, that the hemifusion diaphragm may form spontaneously from randomly colliding liposomes. Its transition to full fusion, however, appears to be facilitated by the TMS-peptides. What is the characteristic feature of the TMS which drives this transition and which is required for optimal fusion protein function? The TMSs of fusion proteins are expected to be inserted as α-helices at orientations close to the membrane normal as demonstrated for the influenza HA TMS (30Tatulian S.A. Tamm L.K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 496-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). A comparison of the amino acid composition of fusogenic and non-fusogenic viral membrane protein TMSs revealed that glycine residues are strongly over-represented in the former (16Cleverley D.Z. Lenard J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3425-3430Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). It was therefore speculated that the functionally relevant glycines of the VSV G-protein might allow for bending of the TMS helices during the fusion process (16Cleverley D.Z. Lenard J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3425-3430Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Indeed, glycine residues have previously been shown to destabilize α-helical hydrophobic peptides in membrane-mimetic environments (31Li S.C. Deber C.M. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1992; 40: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). On the other hand, isoleucine was the single other residue type that was also significantly overrepresented in fusogenic TMSs (16Cleverley D.Z. Lenard J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3425-3430Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar).

The microtubule-depolymerizing activity of stathmin is lost upon phosphorylation in mitosis. Although the role of phosphorylation of stathmin by p34cdc2 kinase in the assembly of the mitotic spindle is well established, the role of dephosphorylation of stathmin in mitosis is unknown. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that dephosphorylation of stathmin may be critically important for the depolymerization of the mitotic spindle and the exit from mitosis. We compared the effects of okadaic acid, a specific inhibitor of serine/threonine protein phosphatases, on different parameters of mitotic progression in the presence or absence of stathmin deficiency. Because okadaic acid prevents dephosphorylation of stathmin and results in accumulation of the inactive phosphorylated form, exposure to okadaic acid would be expected to have a more profound effect on mitosis in the presence of relative stathmin deficiency. We found that inhibition of stathmin expression results in increased sensitivity to the antimitotic effects of okadaic acid. This was reflected by increased growth inhibition associated with mitotic arrest. A vast majority of the stathmin-inhibited cells were found to be arrested in late metaphase/anaphase and had severe mitotic spindle abnormalities. Exposure to okadaic acid also resulted in a bigger ratio of polymerized/unpolymerized tubulin in stathmin-inhibited cells relative to control cells. Because the only difference between the control and the stathmin-inhibited cells is the deficiency of stathmin in the latter, the increased susceptibility of the stathmin-inhibited cells to okadaic acid-induced mitotic arrest implies a role for stathmin in the later stages of mitosis.

Ferrari A. Mistry S. Atweh G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10312-10318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and its phosphorylation on multiple sites is required for orderly progression through the cell cycle (8Larsson N.

The unphosphorylated form of stathmin that predominates in interphase promotes depolymerization of microtubules and phosphorylation of stathmin atcdc2 target sites early in mitosis eliminates the ability of stathmin to depolymerize microtubules allowing the mitotic spindle to form (1Marklund U. Larsson N. Melander H. Brattsand G. Gullberg M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5290-5298Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Thus, the microtubule-depolymerizing activity of stathmin that is regulated by changes in its level of phosphorylation plays a critical role in the regulation of the dynamic instability of microtubules during the different phases of the cell cycle (1Marklund U. Larsson N. Melander H. Brattsand G. Gullberg M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5290-5298Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 9Horwitz S.B. Shen H.-J. He L. Dittmar P. Neef R. Chen J. Schubart U.K. J.

We had previously investigated the mechanism(s) responsible for the dephosphorylation of stathmin as cells complete mitosis and enter a new division cycle (10Mistry S.J. Li H.C. Atweh G.F. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We used okadaic acid, a well known inhibitor of protein phosphatases, to investigate the potential role of phosphatases in the regulation of the level of stathmin phosphorylation during cell cycle progression (10Mistry S.J. Li H.C. Atweh G.F. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Okadaic acid is a marine toxin that readily enters eukaryotic cells and selectively inhibits PP1 and PP2A types of serine/threonine phosphatases (11Hardie D.G. Haystead T.A.J. Sim A.T.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 469-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 12Schonthal A. New Biol. 1992; 4: 16-21PubMed Google Scholar). We showed that inhibition of phosphatases by okadaic acid in K562 leukemic cells results in a marked increase in the level of phosphorylation of stathmin (10Mistry S.J. Li H.C. Atweh G.F. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We also demonstrated that stathmin mRNA expression and protein synthesis do not change significantly in the different phases of the cell cycle (10Mistry S.J. Li H.C. Atweh G.F. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, we proposed that the nonphosphorylated form of stathmin, which predominates during G1, is generated by dephosphorylation of stathmin by an okadaic acid-sensitive protein phosphatase (10Mistry S.J. Li H.C. Atweh G.F. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Although these experiments suggested that stathmin might be a target for okadaic acid-sensitive protein phosphatases in vivo, they did not provide direct evidence for a physiologic role of dephosphorylation of stathmin in the regulation of mitosis. The experiments described in this report were designed to investigate a potential role for stathmin in the depolymerization of the mitotic spindle and the exit from mitosis. K562 erythroleukemic cell lines that were used in this study were previously generated by stable transfections using an amplifiable expression vector containing the complete transcription unit for a mutant dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR)1 that has low affinity for methotrexate (3Luo X.N. Mookerji B. Ferrari A. Mistry S. Atweh G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10312-10318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The control cells, K562.DHFR, were transfected with an expression construct without stathmin cDNA (3Luo X.N. Mookerji B. Ferrari A. Mistry S. Atweh G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10312-10318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pools of stathmin-inhibited cell lines were generated by transfecting the expression construct containing the full-length stathmin cDNA in the antisense orientation (3Luo X.N. Mookerji B. Ferrari A. Mistry S. Atweh G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10312-10318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The antisense stathmin cDNA was placed under the control of the SV40 promoter (3Luo X.N. Mookerji B. Ferrari A. Mistry S. Atweh G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10312-10318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The antisense stathmin cDNA sequences were co-amplified with the DHFR sequences by exposing the transfected cells to 1 or 50 µm methotrexate (MTX) (3Luo X.N. Mookerji B. Ferrari A. Mistry S. Atweh G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10312-10318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The two stathmin-inhibited cell lines were previously designated as K562.DHFR.p18(−)[1 µm MTX] and K562.DHFR.p18(−)[50 µm MTX] (3Luo X.N. Mookerji B. Ferrari A. Mistry S. Atweh G.F. J. Biol.

In this study, we used pools of stably transfected cells rather than unique clonal isolates to eliminate the possibility of clonal variations. These cell lines were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 environment. All experiments were carried out using cells in the logarithmic phase of growth. The control and stathmin-inhibited cell lines were seeded at a density of 2 × 104cells/ml in the presence and absence of okadaic acid (Sigma) at different concentrations of okadaic acid as indicated. The cells were stained with trypan blue, and viable cell counts were determined daily over a period of 5 days using a hemocytometer. We used propidium iodide staining of fixed whole cells to analyze the distribution of cells in the different phases of the cell cycle (14Engelhard III, H.H. Krupka J.L. Bauer K.D. Cytometry. 1991; 12: 68-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The control and stathmin-inhibited cell lines were incubated for 24 h with different concentrations of okadaic acid as indicated. Approximately 1 × 106cells were harvested, washed, and fixed in 0.5% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. The fixed cells were permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 for 3 min, washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and resuspended in 1 ml of propidium iodide solution (PBS containing 0.05 mg/ml propidium iodide, 0.1% sodium citrate, and 1 mg/ml RNase). The cells were incubated for 15 min at 4 °C. DNA content was analyzed within 2 h using a Becton Dickinson FACStar Plus flow cytometer at 488 nm single laser excitation. The cell cycle distribution was analyzed using Lysis II software. The control and stathmin-inhibited cell lines were treated with different concentrations of okadaic acid for 24 h as indicated. The cells were harvested, washed, and cytocentrifuged onto glass slides. The cells were fixed in methanol for 5–7 min, air-dried, and then stained with Wright-Giemsa for 10 min. The mitotic cells were counted and expressed as a percentage of total cells with a minimum of 300 cells counted per slide in different fields. The control and stathmin-inhibited cells were exposed to different concentrations of okadaic acid (0, 5, and 10 nm). After 24 h of incubation with okadaic acid, the cells were washed in PBS, extracted in microtubule-stabilizing buffer (0.1 m PIPES, pH 6.9, 2 m glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 0.2% Triton X-100, 5 µm Taxol, and 10 µg/ml RNase) and cytocentrifuged onto polylysine-coated slides at 500 rpm for 4 min. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.5% glutaraldehyde for 15 min. The fixed cells were rinsed in three changes of PBS (5 min each). The unreacted aldehyde groups were reduced by two changes of NaBH4 (5 min each). The cells were rinsed three times in PBS (5 min each) and incubated in 3% bovine serum albumin for 30 min and thereafter stained with anti-α-tubulin (clone B512, Sigma) at a dilution of 1:3000 in PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h. After three rinses in PBS, cells were incubated with fluorescein-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG for 1 h and subsequently rinsed several times in PBS. For double immunostaining of tubulin and DNA, the cells were incubated in the next to last wash with PBS containing 1 µg/ml 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI) (Sigma) for 15 min and rinsed with two changes of PBS. The cells were mounted in aqueous dry mounting medium and analyzed by epifluorescence. Control and stathmin-inhibited K562 cell lines were treated with 10 nm okadaic acid and harvested after 24 h. The amounts of polymerized and soluble forms of tubulin in untreated or okadaic acid-treated cell lines were quantified using a modification of the procedure described previously (1Marklund U. Larsson N. Melander H. Brattsand G. Gullberg M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5290-5298Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 15Minotti A.M. Barlow S.B. Cabral F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3987-3994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An equal number of cells (1 × 106) from untreated or okadaic acid-treated control and stathmin-inhibited cell lines were lysed in microtubule-stabilizing lysis buffer containing 0.1 mPIPES, pH 6.9, 2 m glycerol, 5 mmMgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 4 µm Taxol, and 5 µg/ml leupeptin. Taxol was included in the lysis buffer to stabilize the microtubules during extraction and to maintain their stability during subsequent processing. The cell lysates were subjected to high speed centrifugation at 40,000 ×g for 30 min at 22 °C to sediment the polymeric tubulin (16Seger M. Pick E. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1984; 35: 303-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 17Eichhorn J.H. Peterkofsky B. J. Cell Biol. 1979; 82: 572-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Supernatants containing soluble tubulin were separated from the pellets containing the polymerized tubulin. The pellets containing the polymerized tubulin were solubilized in microtubule-stabilizing buffer and subjected to ultrasonic waves for 10 min to ensure complete disruption of the microtubules. The tubulin content in the pellets and supernatants was then analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting with an anti-α-tubulin antibody (clone B512, Sigma). The bound antibodies were visualized by chemiluminescence. To measure the total level of tubulin in untreated and okadaic acid-treated control and stathmin-inhibited cells, the cells were lysed in a buffer containing 25 mmTris, pH 7.4, 0.4 m NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% SDS, 0.1% deoxycholate, and 5 µg of leupeptin (18Caron J.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1989; 138: 603-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The protein concentrations were measured by the Bio-Rad DC assay, and equal amounts (100 µg) of the protein extracts were used. The total level of tubulin was then analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting with an anti-α-tubulin antibody as described above. This assay was performed more than three times with essentially identical results. We tested the hypothesis that dephosphorylation of stathmin may be critical for depolymerization of the mitotic spindle and exit from mitosis. We compared the effects of okadaic acid on mitotic progression in cells expressing different levels of stathmin. Because okadaic acid prevents dephosphorylation of stathmin and results in accumulation of the inactive phosphorylated form (10Mistry S.J. Li H.C. Atweh G.F. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), exposure to okadaic acid should have a more profound antimitotic effect in the presence of relative stathmin deficiency. We had previously generated several stable K562 erythroleukemia cell lines that express different levels of stathmin RNA (3Luo X.N. Mookerji B. Ferrari A. Mistry S. Atweh G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10312-10318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cell line in which stathmin expression was moderately inhibited by antisense RNA was previously referred to as K562.DHFR.p18(−)[1 µm MTX], and the cell line in which stathmin expression was maximally inhibited was referred to as K562.DHFR.p18(−)[50 µm MTX] (3Luo X.N. Mookerji B. Ferrari A. Mistry S. Atweh G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10312-10318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Jeha S. Luo X.N. Beran M. Kantarjian H. Atweh G.F. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1445-1450PubMed Google Scholar). A control cell line, K562.DHFR, was also established by transfecting the same expression plasmid without stathmin cDNA sequences (3Luo X.N. Mookerji B. Ferrari A. Mistry S. Atweh G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10312-10318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Jeha S. Luo X.N. Beran M. Kantarjian H. Atweh G.F. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1445-1450PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we refer to the K562.DHFR.p18(−)[1 µm MTX] cell line as K562.AS1, the K562.DHFR.p18(−)[50 µm MTX] cell line as K562.AS2, and the control K562.DHFR cell line as K562.C. We compared the effects of okadaic acid on different parameters of mitotic progression in the control and the two stathmin-inhibited K562 cell lines. We first examined the effects of okadaic acid on the proliferation of K562 leukemic cells in the presence and absence of stathmin inhibition. Fig. 1illustrates the effects of different concentrations of okadaic acid on the rate of proliferation of K562.C, K562.AS1, and K562.AS2 cells. Exposure of K562.C and K562.AS1 cells to 5 nm okadaic acid had very little effect on their rate of growth, whereas the growth of K562.AS2 cells was moderately decreased (Fig. 1). When the control K562.C cells were exposed to 10 nm okadaic acid, they proliferated at a moderately decreased rate (Fig. 1). However, exposure of stathmin-inhibited cells to the same concentration of okadaic acid resulted in a very profound growth inhibition of K562.AS1 cells and the near complete loss of proliferation of K562.AS2 cells (Fig. 1). The doubling time of the three cell lines was calculated in the presence and absence of exposure to okadaic acid (TableI). Exposure to 10 nm okadaic acid resulted in 22.2% prolongation of the doubling time of the control K562.C cells. Exposure of the stathmin-inhibited cells to the same concentration of okadaic acid resulted in a 45.5% prolongation of the doubling time of K562.AS1 cells and nearly 100% prolongation in the K562.AS2 cells (Table I). Thus, inhibition of stathmin expression is associated with increased sensitivity to the antiproliferative effects of okadaic acid.Table IRelative doubling time of the control and stathmin-inhibited cell lines in the absence and presence of different concentrations of okadaic acid (OA)Cell lines0 nm OA5 nm OA10 nm OAhK562.C22.623.126.1K562.AS126.727.337.5K562.AS227.330.054.5 Open table in a new tab We also examined the effects of okadaic acid on cell cycle progression of K562 cells in the presence and absence of stathmin inhibition. The cell cycle distribution of control and stathmin-inhibited cells that were exposed to different concentrations of okadaic acid were analyzed by propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry. Fig. 2 illustrates the effects of different concentrations of okadaic acid on the cell cycle profile of K562.C, K562.AS1, and K562.AS2 cell lines. As expected, exposure of all three cell lines to increasing concentrations of okadaic acid resulted in a dose-dependent accumulation of cells in the G2/M phases and a corresponding decrease in the proportion of cells in the G0/G1 phases of the cell cycle (Fig. 2). However, the magnitude of the okadaic acid-induced G2/M accumulation was markedly different in the different cell lines. Exposure of K562.C and K562.AS1 cells to 5 nmokadaic acid resulted in a modest increase in the fraction of cells in the G2/M phases (4 and 5.5%, respectively) (Fig. 2). In contrast, the fraction of K562.AS2 cells in the G2/M phases was increased by 18% (Fig. 2). When the cells were exposed to 10 nm okadaic acid, the G2/M fraction of the control K562.C cells was increased by 22%, whereas the G2/M fractions of K562.AS1 and K562.AS2 cells were increased by 43.8 and 47.7%, respectively (Fig. 2). Thus, inhibition of stathmin expression results in a dose-dependent increase in the sensitivity to okadaic acid-induced mitotic arrest. Because it is not possible to distinguish between accumulation in the G2 phase and accumulation in the M phase by propidium iodide staining, we analyzed the effects of okadaic acid on the mitotic index of control and stathmin-inhibited cells. Fig.3 illustrates the effects of different concentrations of okadaic acid on the mitotic index of K562.C, K562.AS1, and K562.AS2 cell lines. When the control K562.C cells were exposed to different concentrations of okadaic acid, the proportion of mitotic cells increased to 20.2% at 5 nm and 24.8% at 10 nm okadaic acid (Fig. 3). In contrast, when the stathmin-inhibited K562.AS1 cells were exposed to the same concentrations of okadaic acid, the proportion of mitotic cells increased to 33% at 5 nm and 51.3% at 10 nmokadaic acid (Fig. 3). Similarly, when K562.AS2 cells were exposed to okadaic acid, the proportion of mitotic cells was increased to 39.7% at 5 nm and 61.8% at 10 nm okadaic acid (Fig.3). Thus, stathmin inhibition accentuates the okadaic acid-induced mitotic arrest. Analyses of the data presented in Figs. 2 and 3 make it possible to deduce the fraction of cells arrested in mitosis and the fraction of cells arrested in the G2 phase of the cell cycle. A comparison of the relative fraction of cells arrested in mitosis as assessed by DNA content and morphology in the three cell lines following exposure to okadaic acid is shown in TableII. When the control K562.C cells were exposed to okadaic acid, more cells were found to be arrested in G2/M by DNA content than the cells arrested in M by morphology. In contrast, when the stathmin-inhibited cells were exposed to the same concentrations of okadaic acid, the fraction of cells arrested in G2/M by DNA content and the cells arrested in M by morphology were similar. This suggests that when stathmin-inhibited cells are exposed to okadaic acid essentially all cells that are in the G2/M fractions are arrested in M, whereas exposure of control cells to okadaic acid results in accumulation of cells in the G2 phase and the M phase.Table IIRelative fraction of cells arrested in mitosis by DNA content and morphology in control and stathmin-inhibited cell lines after exposure to okadaic acidExposure to okadaic acidCell linesK562.CK562.AS1K562.AS2DNA content G2/MMorphology MDNA content G2/MMorphology MDNA content G2/MMorphology M%5 nm27.920.229.133.040.939.710 nm34.424.848.951.363.361.8 Open table in a new tab We next evaluated the morphology of the mitotic spindle in control and stathmin-inhibited cells following exposure to okadaic acid. The mitotic spindles were analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence of tubulin to visualize the organization of microtubules and by DAPI staining to visualize the chromosomes. When the control and the stathmin-inhibited cells were exposed to a low concentration (5 nm) of okadaic acid, the majority of the mitotic cells showed normal bipolar organization of the mitotic spindle and were blocked in a metaphase-like early mitotic stage. However, there were fewer cells in late mitosis in K562.AS1 (23.2%) and K562.AS2 (19.6%) than in the control K562.C cells (39.8%). When the concentration of okadaic acid was increased to 10 nm, there was a dramatic increase in the number of cells with aberrant mitosis. The fraction of cells with abnormal mitotic spindles in the control K562.C cells was 36%. In contrast, the fraction of cells with abnormal mitotic spindles in stathmin-inhibited K562.AS1 and K562.AS2 cells markedly increased to 72 and 85.7%, respectively (Fig. 4). Both the control and stathmin-inhibited cells showed a wide range of mitotic spindle abnormalities after okadaic acid treatment (Fig. 5). In many instances, the microtubules of bipolar spindles were disorganized with scattered chromosomes as shown in Fig. 5, A andB. In other instances, although the spindles retained their bipolar organization, they were disrupted (Fig. 5, C andD). In some cells, the spindles had a unipolar organization (Fig. 5, E andF). A striking phenotype that was more commonly seen in okadaic acid-treated stathmin-inhibited cells was the presence of multipolar spindles with three or more poles (Fig. 5, G andI). These multipolar spindles were frequently observed with chromosomes that were either aggregated in multiple metaphase plates (Fig. 5, G and H) or randomly scattered between spindle poles (Fig. 5, I and J). The frequencies of the different types of spindle abnormalities are summarized in TableIII. Although okadaic acid treatment elicited the same type of spindle abnormalities in all three cell lines, the incidence of the severe spindle abnormalities increased with increased inhibition of stathmin expression.Figure 5Indirect immunofluorescence staining of mitotic spindle abnormalities. Representative micrographs illustrate the different spindle abnormalities that were seen following treatment with 10 nm okadaic acid for 24 h. Although all these micrographs were taken from K562.AS1 cells, the same types of abnormalities were seen in all cell lines. The micrographs in the left panels (A, C, E,G, and I) show anti-tubulin indirect immunofluorescence staining, and those in the right panels(B, D, F, H, andJ) show DNA staining with DAPI. The spindle abnormalities (indicated by arrowheads) ranged from bipolar spindles with disorganized arrays of microtubules and dispersed chromosomes (A and B), disrupted bipolar spindles (C and D), unipolar spindles (E andF), and multipolar spindles with chromosomes aggregated in multiple metaphase plates (G and H) or randomly scattered chromosomes between spindle poles (I andJ).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Table IIIRelative percentiles of different kinds of spindle abnormalities in untreated and okadaic acid (OA)-treated control and stathmin-inhibited cell linesAbnormal spindlesNo OA+10 nm OA (24 h)K562.CK562.AS1K562.AS2K562.CK562.AS1K562.AS2%Unipolar04.06.04.03.07.0Aberrant bipolar7.09.711.023.727.736.7Multipolar (>2 poles)01.00.79.041.342.0 Open table in a new tab We wanted to determine whether the increased mitotic aberrations observed in stathmin-inhibited cells after okadaic acid treatment are a result of perturbations in the dynamic equilibrium of microtubules that make up the mitotic spindles. Because phosphorylation of stathmin eliminates its microtubule-depolymerizing activity, preventing its dephosphorylation by okadaic acid treatment should be expected to result in a shift of the equilibrium between polymerized and unpolymerized tubulin in favor of the polymerized form. We used two different approaches to test this hypothesis. We first analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy the effects of stathmin inhibition on the morphology of the microtubule network in the presence and absence of okadaic acid (Fig.6). The K562.AS2 stathmin-inhibited cells displayed a more prominent microtubule network than the K562.C and the K562.AS1 cells (Fig. 6 A). When the cells were exposed to okadaic acid, this increase in density of microtubules became more pronounced in both the K562.AS1 and K562.AS2 stathmin-inhibited cell lines than in the control K562.C cells (Fig. 6 B). Although these observations are compatible with increased polymerization of microtubules in okadaic acid-treated stathmin-inhibited cells, they are difficult to quantify. Therefore, we used a second approach that is more quantitative in nature to compare the levels of polymerized and unpolymerized tubulin in untreated or okadaic acid-treated control and stathmin-inhibited cells. We used a biochemical assay that allows the isolation of the in vivo assembled microtubules in their polymerized state and the unpolymerized tubulin as a soluble protein (1Marklund U. Larsson N. Melander H. Brattsand G. Gullberg M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5290-5298Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 15Minotti A.M. Barlow S.B. Cabral F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3987-3994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The two forms of tubulin were separated by ultracentrifugation, and the levels of polymerized and unpolymerized forms of tubulin were quantified by immunoblotting with an anti-tubulin antibody (Fig. 7). Immunoblot analyses of the levels of polymerized and unpolymerized tubulin in the absence of okadaic acid showed no significant differences in the ratio of polymerized to unpolymerized tubulin in stathmin-inhibited K562.AS1 cells relative to the control K562.C cells (Fig. 7, A andB). In contrast, the K562.AS2 cells showed a 2-fold increase in the ratio of polymerized to unpolymerized tubulin relative to the control K562.C cells (Fig. 7, A and B). When the cells were exposed to okadaic acid, the ratio of polymerized to unpolymerized tubulin in K562.AS1 cells remained essentially unchanged, whereas the ratio of polymerized to unpolymerized tubulin was further increased (from 2- to 5-fold) in K562.AS2 cells relative to the control K562.C cells (Fig. 7, A and B). This demonstrates that stathmin inhibition results in increased polymerization of microtubules that is further enhanced by exposure to okadaic acid. These findings are supportive of the morphological data shown in Fig.6. In another experiment, we compared the total level of tubulin (i.e. polymerized and unpolymerized) in untreated and okadaic acid-treated control and stathmin-inhibited cells. Immunoblot analyses of tubulin levels in control and stathmin-inhibited cell lines showed no significant differences in the steady state levels of tubulin in the presence or absence of okadaic acid (Fig. 7 C). These observations suggest that okadaic acid-mediated inhibition of dephosphorylation of stathmin affects tubulin polymerization rather than the steady state levels of the tubulin subunits.Figure 7Effects of okadaic acid on tubulin polymerization in K562 cells with different degrees of stathmin inhibition.

This has been suggested by a number of studies that demonstrated a block in mitosis in diverse cell types following okadaic acid treatment (19Zheng B. Woo C.F. Kuo J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10031-10034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Ghosh S. Paweletz N. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 200: 215-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 21Vandre D.D. Wills V. J.

Exposure of K562 cells to okadaic acid was previously shown to result in growth inhibition that was associated with a pronounced mitotic arrest (19Zheng B. Woo C.F. Kuo J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10031-10034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In a second study, exposure of HeLa cells to okadaic acid was shown to result in defective anaphase separation (20Ghosh S. Paweletz N. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 200: 215-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). A third study showed that prolonged exposure of LLC-PK cells to okadaic acid results in disruption of chromosome alignment at the metaphase plate and spindle deformities associated with a high frequency of multipolar spindles (21Vandre D.D. Wills V. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 101: 79-91PubMed Google Scholar). This study concluded that okadaic acid blocks cells at the transition from metaphase to anaphase (21Vandre D.D. Wills V. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 101: 79-91PubMed Google Scholar). PP1 and PP2A have also been implicated to play a role in the metaphase/anaphase transition in several yeast mutants and in starfish oocytes (23Picard A. Capony J.P. Brautigan D.L. Doree M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3347-3354Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 24Ohkura H. Kinoshita N. Miyatani S. Toda T. Yanagida M.

Although numerous studies have contributed to our current appreciation of the role of okadaic acid-sensitive protein phosphatases in the progression through mitosis, particularly at the metaphase/anaphase transition, the targets of dephosphorylation by these phosphatases or the precise signaling pathways that control the exit from mitosis remain entirely unknown. On the basis of our previous observation of the increased stathmin phosphorylation in vivo following exposure of K562 cells to okadaic acid (10Mistry S.J. Li H.C. Atweh G.F. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and the known mitotic arrest that results from okadaic acid treatment of K562 cells (19Zheng B. Woo C.F. Kuo J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10031-10034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we previously proposed that dephosphorylation of stathmin by okadaic acid-sensitive protein phosphatases may be an important signaling event that is critical for the depolymerization of the microtubules that make up the mitotic spindle and for the exit from mitosis (10Mistry S.J. Li H.C. Atweh G.F. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). When stathmin is phosphorylated by p34cdc2 kinase as cells enter mitosis, its microtubule-depolymerizing activity is lost, tubulin is polymerized, and the mitotic spindle is formed (1Marklund U. Larsson N. Melander H. Brattsand G. Gullberg M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5290-5298Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). However, to complete the division cycle and enter a new G1 phase, cells need to depolymerize their microtubules to disassemble the mitotic spindles. The importance of the phosphorylation of stathmin by p34cdc2 kinase for the assembly of the mitotic spindle as cells enter mitosis was previously demonstrated (1Marklund U. Larsson N. Melander H. Brattsand G. Gullberg M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5290-5298Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the reversal of this process by stathmin dephosphorylation might be equally important for the ability of cells to complete their division cycle. We undertook the present study to determine whether dephosphorylation of stathmin by okadaic acid-sensitive protein phosphatases might be an important event in the postmetaphase process of microtubule depolymerization. If stathmin is important for the exit from mitosis, inhibiting its dephosphorylation should result in a more profound mitotic arrest in the presence of stathmin deficiency. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that inhibition of dephosphorylation by okadaic acid would result in a more profound mitotic block in the presence of decreased levels of stathmin. Although we previously demonstrated that exposure of K562 cells to okadaic acid results in increased phosphorylation of stathmin, the effects of okadaic acid on K562 cells is not limited to the inhibition of dephosphorylation of stathmin (10Mistry S.J. Li H.C. Atweh G.F. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, the only difference that we are aware of between the control and stathmin-inhibited K562 cells that were used in this study is in the level of expression of stathmin (3Luo X.N. Mookerji B. Ferrari A. Mistry S. Atweh G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10312-10318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the observed differences in the effects of okadaic acid in the different cell lines may be attributed to its effect on stathmin phosphorylation. Our analyses of the effects of okadaic acid on mitotic progression demonstrated that increased inhibition of stathmin expression results in increased sensitivity to the antimitotic effects of okadaic acid. This increased sensitivity was shown by three different assays that evaluated the effects of okadaic acid on cell growth, cell cycle distribution, and the mitotic index in control and stathmin-inhibited cell lines. These experiments were performed using cell lines that consisted of pools of stably transfected cells. This should eliminate the possibility that the observed differences in okadaic acid sensitivity may be because of clonal variations in the cell lines that were selected for this study. Our analyses of the morphology and the distribution of cells in mitosis revealed that exposure of K562 cells to okadaic acid at low concentration results in a higher proportion of cells in a metaphase-like mitotic stage and a lower proportion of cells in late mitosis (anaphases or telophases). This postmetaphase block in mitosis is more profound in the presence of stathmin inhibition. This suggests that inhibition of dephosphorylation of stathmin arrests cells late in mitosis. Furthermore, exposure to higher concentration of okadaic acid resulted in a significantly higher proportion of abnormal mitotic spindles in stathmin-inhibited cells than in the control cells. The abnormal mitotic spindles in the stathmin-inhibited cells were predominantly multipolar with scattered or aggregated chromosomes, a mitotic abnormality that is frequently associated with an aberrant anaphase (19Zheng B. Woo C.F. Kuo J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10031-10034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Ghosh S. Paweletz N. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 200: 215-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 21Vandre D.D. Wills V. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 101: 79-91PubMed Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the observed spindle abnormalities are probably a result of a more severe deficiency of the active (i.e. dephosphorylated) form of stathmin in the K562.AS cells. This may be responsible for the impairment of the ability of cells to undergo normal chromosome segregation at the onset of anaphase and prevent the exit from mitosis and entry into a new division cycle. Thus, the increased frequency of aberrant multipolar anaphases in okadaic acid-treated stathmin-inhibited K562 cells confirms that dephosphorylation of stathmin by okadaic acid-sensitive protein phosphatases is important during transition of cells from metaphase to anaphase. Entry into and exit from mitosis involves a number of structural transitions that are mediated through changes in the dynamic equilibrium of microtubules that make up the mitotic spindle. We measured the fraction of polymerized tubulin in the different cell lines in the presence and absence of okadaic acid. We found that inhibition of stathmin in K562 cells results in an increase in the polymerization of tubulin subunits in the absence of exposure to okadaic acid. This increased polymerization of microtubules in stathmin-inhibited cells is consistent with a recent report that demonstrated a similar increase in microtubule polymer levels in newt lung cells that were depleted of stathmin by either microinjection of stathmin antibody or antisense stathmin oligonucleotides (26Howell B. Deacon H. Cassimeris L. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3713-3722PubMed Google Scholar). However, the major aim of this study was to compare the effects of okadaic acid on tubulin polymerization in the presence or absence of stathmin inhibition. Our experiments showed that exposure of the same cells to okadaic acid results in a further increase in microtubule polymerization in K562.AS2 cells relative to the control K562.C cells. These findings are consistent with the postulated model of the microtubule regulatory activity of stathmin (1Marklund U. Larsson N. Melander H. Brattsand G. Gullberg M.

If phosphorylation of stathmin early in mitosis abrogates its microtubule-depolymerizing activity (1Marklund U. Larsson N. Melander H. Brattsand G. Gullberg M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5290-5298Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), inhibition of dephosphorylation of stathmin by okadaic acid should inactivate its microtubule-depolymerizing function and result in increased microtubule polymerization and overstabilization of the mitotic apparatus. This in turn would give rise to aberrant spindle morphology. The observed increase in the proportion of aberrant mitotic spindles along with the increase in the content of polymerized tubulin in okadaic acid-treated stathmin-inhibited cells provide strong support for the hypothesis that dephosphorylation of stathmin by okadaic acid-sensitive protein phosphatases plays a critical role in the regulation of exit from mitosis. We are extremely grateful to Dr. Jonathan Licht and Dr. James Manfredi from the Derald Ruttenburg Cancer Center for reviewing this manuscript and providing helpful comments."
https://openalex.org/W2068746509,"Poly-α-2,8-sialic acid (polysialic acid) is a post-translational modification of the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) and an important regulator of neuronal cell-cell interactions. The synthesis of polysialic acid depends on the two polysialyltransferases ST8SiaII and ST8SiaIV. Understanding the catalytic mechanisms of the polysialyltransferases is critical toward the aim of influencing physiological and pathophysiological functions mediated by polysialic acid. We recently demonstrated that polysialyltransferases are bifunctional enzymes exhibiting auto- and NCAM polysialylation activity. Autopolysialylation occurs onN-glycans of the enzymes, and glycosylation variants lacking sialic acid and galactose were found to be inactive for both auto- and NCAM polysialylation. In the present study, we have analyzed the number and functional importance of N-linked oligosaccharides present on polysialyltransferases. We demonstrate that autopolysialylation depends on specific N-glycans attached to Asn74 in ST8SiaIV and Asn89 and Asn219 in ST8SiaII. Deletion of polysialic acid acceptor sites by site-directed mutagenesis rendered the polysialyltransferases inactive in vitro and in vivo. The inactivity of autopolysialylation-negative polysialyltransferases in vivo was not caused by the absence or default targeting of the enzymes. The data presented in this study clearly show that active polysialyltransferases are competent to perform autopolysialylation and provide strong evidence for a tight functional link between the two catalytic functions.

Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 679-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Although NCAM mediates stable cell-cell contacts in the absence of PSA, the adhesion molecule is converted into an “anti-adhesive” factor in the presence of PSA (6Yang P. Major D. Rutishauser U. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23039-23044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PSA-NCAM is involved in promoting cell migration and axon guidance (7Hu H. Tomasiewicz H. Magnuson T. Rutishauser U.

In the adult brain PSA is restricted to areas with persistent cellular plasticity such as hippocampus, hypothalamus, and olfactory bulb (11Bonfanti L. Olive S. Poulain D.A. Theodosis D.T.

Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2237-2244PubMed Google Scholar), and the re-expression of PSA was observed in several tumors. Recent studies strongly suggest that the PSA levels in these tumors correlate with their potential for metastasis (15Scheidegger E.P. Lackie P.M. Papay J. Roth J. Lab. Invest. 1994; 70: 95-106PubMed Google Scholar, 16Glüer S. Schelp C. Madry N. von Schweinitz D. Eckhardt M. Gerardy-Schahn R. Br. J.

Although a wide range of biological effects have been attributed to PSA, the biosynthesis of the sugar polymer and the regulation of its expression are understood poorly. Two polysialyltransferases, ST8SiaII (formerly named STX) and ST8SiaIV (formerly named PST-1 or PST), are able to synthesize PSA on NCAM. The genes of both enzymes have been cloned from diverse species (see Ref. 18Windfuhr M. Manegold A. Mühlenhoff M. Eckhardt M. Gerardy-Schahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32861-32870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar and references cited therein), and their expression has been studied intensively during ontogenetic development (19Kurosawa N. Yoshida Y. Kojima N. Tsuji S. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 494-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 20Ong E. Nakayama J. Angata K. Reyes L. Katsuyama T. Arai Y. Fukuda M.

Neurochem. 1998; 71: 2339-2348Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). All studies describe ST8SiaII as the major isoform in embryonic and early postnatal brain, whereas ST8SiaIV was found to be the major isoform in adult brain. In line with this observation, inactivation of the ST8SiaIV gene by a knock-out mouse approach resulted in a nearly complete loss of PSA in mice older than 3 months and was found to be associated with severe deficits in synaptic plasticity (22Eckhardt M. Bukalo O. Chazal G. Wang L. Goridis C. Schachner M. Gerardy-Schahn R. Cremer H. Dityatev A. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5234-5244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both polysialyltransferases are individually able to polysialylate NCAM by adding PSA to monosialylated N-glycans (23Mühlenhoff M. Eckhardt M. Bethe A. Frosch M. Gerardy-Schahn R. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1188-1191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 24Angata K. Suzuki M. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28524-28532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The synthesis of PSA on NCAM is highly specific and involves only two of six N-glycosylation sites of NCAM (24Angata K. Suzuki M. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28524-28532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 25Nelson R.W. Bates P.A. Rutishauser U. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17171-17179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). An interesting feature of the polysialyltransferases is their ability to catalyze autopolysialylation. During this autocatalytic process, PSA chains are build up on N-glycans of the enzymes (26Mühlenhoff M. Eckhardt M. Bethe A. Frosch M. Gerardy-Schahn R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6943-6950Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 27Close B.E. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34586-34593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Most recently autopolysialylation could be demonstrated also for ST8SiaIII, a sialyltransferase for which the natural acceptor substrate has not been identified thus far. Compared with ST8SiaII and ST8SiaIV, autocatalytically synthesized PSA chains were found to be shorter in ST8SiaIII (28Angata K. Suzuki M. McAuliffe J. Ding Y. Hindsgaul O. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18594-18601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). When we initially described autopolysialylation, we also demonstrated that a secreted form of recombinant ST8SiaIV carried PSA (26Mühlenhoff M. Eckhardt M. Bethe A. Frosch M. Gerardy-Schahn R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6943-6950Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Close and Colley (27Close B.E. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34586-34593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) confirmed this observation and in addition showed that the full-length Golgi-localized polysialyltransferases ST8SiaII and -IV carry PSA. However, studies addressing the functional importance of this self-modification caused substantial controversy. Although data from our laboratory (18Windfuhr M. Manegold A. Mühlenhoff M. Eckhardt M. Gerardy-Schahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32861-32870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 26Mühlenhoff M. Eckhardt M. Bethe A. Frosch M. Gerardy-Schahn R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6943-6950Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) suggest a tight mechanistic link between auto- and NCAM polysialylation, Close et al.(29Close B.E. Tao K. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4484-4491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) recently described the two catalytic reactions to be independent. To clarify the role of autopolysialylation a large panel ofN-glycosylation variants of the polysialyltransferases ST8SiaII and -IV have been created by site-directed mutagenesis and used (i) to identify the number and positions of N-glycans involved in the autopolysialylation process and (ii) to investigate the functional abilities of N-glycosylation-deficient polysialyltransferases in vivo and in vitro. The detailed studies presented in this paper confirm our previous results that interference with the autopolysialylation process prevents the formation of active polysialyltransferases in vivo andin vitro. CMP-[14C]Neu5Ac (293 μCi/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.Endoneuraminidase NE (endoNE) was purified from the Escherichia coli K1 bacteriophage, PK1E, as described (30Gerardy-Schahn R.

Recombinant peptide-N-glycosidase F (PNGaseF) and mAb 12CA5 directed against the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope (YPYDVPDYA) were purchased from Roche. mAb M5 directed against the Flag sequence (MDYKDDDDK) and biotinylated mAb SPA-27 directed against Protein A were obtained from Sigma. Recombinant soluble Protein A-NCAM was expressed in 2A10 cells and purified as described (26Mühlenhoff M. Eckhardt M. Bethe A. Frosch M. Gerardy-Schahn R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6943-6950Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-α-mannosidase II antiserum was a kind gift of Dr. K. Moremen (University of Georgia, Athens, GA) (33Moremen K.W.

Chem. 1988; 263: 11892-11899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was provided generously by Dr. R. Breathnach (INSERM, Nantes, France). The plasmids pFlagHA-ST8SiaII and pFlagHA-ST8SiaIV containing full-length cDNA of murine ST8SiaII and hamster ST8SiaIV, respectively, with the N-terminal Flag and HA tags were constructed as described previously (18Windfuhr M. Manegold A. Mühlenhoff M. Eckhardt M. Gerardy-Schahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32861-32870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The plasmids pZeoSV-ST8SiaII and pZeoSV-ST8SiaIV contain the same coding sequence and were generated by subcloning the KpnI/XbaI fragment of pFlagHA-ST8SiaII and -IV into the vector pZeoSV (Invitrogen). The plasmids pPROTA-ST8SiaII and pPROTA-ST8SiaIV, containing a transin secretion signal sequence and the IgG binding domain of Staphylococcus aureus Protein A in front of truncated polysialyltransferases that lack their transmembrane domains, were constructed in the vector pPROTA (35Sanchez-Lopez R. Nicholson R. Gesnel M.C. Matrisian L.M. Breathnach R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11892-11899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PCR products coding for Ser26–Thr375 of murine ST8SiaII and Arg27–Gln359 of hamster ST8SiaIV were amplified using the primer pairs 5′-TCTCAGAGATCGAAGAAG-3′/5′-TTACGTAGCCCCATCAC-3′ and 5′-CCAGAACTGAGGAGCAC-3′/5′-TTATTGCTTCATGCACTTCCC-3′, respectively. The vector pPROTA was linearized withEcoRI and filled in with Klenow polymerase, and PCR fragments were inserted by blunt-end ligation. During ligation theEcoRI site was destroyed in the case of pPROTA-ST8SiaII, whereas one EcoRI site at the 5′end of the ST8SiaIV coding sequence was retained in the case of pPROTA-ST8SiaIV. N-glycosylation sites were destroyed by substituting asparagine in the Asn-XXX-Ser/Thr motifs by glutamine. This was done by PCR using the QuikChangeTMsite-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) following the guide lines given by the manufacturer. Mutagenic primers were designed to change the codons used for Asn (AAT or AAC) into a codon used for Gln (CAA or CAG) by two site-specific nucleotide exchanges. The sequences of all 22 primers are given in Table I. For site-directed mutations in theST8SiaII gene, the full-length murine cDNA subcloned in the vector pBluescript SK(−) (Stratagene) was used as a template in the PCRs. Amplified products containing the desired mutations were digested with EcoRI to generate a 952-bp fragment that was ligated into the EcoRI sites of pPROTA-ST8SiaII and pFlagHA-ST8SiaII, replacing the corresponding wild-type sequence. For the PCR-based mutations carried out in ST8SiaIV, a 930-bpEcoRI fragment from pPROTA-ST8SiaIV (bp 77–1006 of the coding sequence) subcloned into pBluescript SK(−) was used as a template. EcoRI fragments with site-specific mutations were subcloned into pPROTA-ST8SiaIV, and a 915-bpBsmBI/EcoRI fragment (bp 91–1006 of the coding sequence) was used for subcloning in pFlagHA-ST8SiaIV, replacing the corresponding wild-type sequence. The identity of all mutants both before and after subcloning was confirmed by dideoxy sequencing.Table IN-glycosylation mutants of the polysialyltransferases ST8SiaII and IVMutationNucleotide exchangeAmino acid exchangeMutation primersST8SiaIIΔ1178AAT → CAAN60Q5′-GAGCTGAAGTTGTAATCCAAGGCTCTTCACCGCCAGC-3′5′-GCTGGCGGTGAAGAGCCTTGGATTACAACTTCAGCTC-3′ST8SiaIIΔ2214AAT → CAAN72Q5′-GCTGTCGCTGACAGAAGTCAAGAAAGCCTTAAGCAC-3′5′-GTGCTTAAGGCTTTCTTGACTTCTGTCAGCGACAGC-3′ST8SiaIIΔ3265AAC → CAAN89Q5′-CCAAATGGAGACACCAACAGACGCTCTCTCTGAG-3′5′-CTCAGAGAGAGCGTCTGTTGGTGTCTCCATTTGG-3′ST8SiaIIΔ4400AAC → CAGN134Q5′-CGTGACAGCACAATGCAGGTGTCCCAGAACCTC-3′5′-GAGGTTCTGGGACACCTGCATTGTGCTGTCACG-3′ST8SiaIIΔ5655AAC → CAGN219Q5′-CCTTTGAGGACCTTGTGCAGGCCACGTGGCGGG-3′5′-CCCGCCACGTGGCCTGCACAAGGTCCTCAAAGG-3′ST8SiaIIΔ6700AAT → CAAN234Q5′-GCTGCACGGCCTCCAAGGGAGCATCCTGTGG-3′5′-CCACAGGATGCTCCCTTGGAGGCCGTGCAGC-3′ST8SiaIVΔ1148AAC → CAGN50Q5′-GTGTTTGAGCAGATCACTTGTGCAGAGCTCTGATAAAATCATTCG-3′5′-CGAATGATTTTATCAGAGCTCTGCACAAGTGATCTGCTCAAACAC-3′ST8SiaIVΔ2220AAT → CAGN74Q5′-GGCTGGAGAATCCAGTCTTCTTTAGTCC-3′5′-GGACTAAAGAAGACTGGATTCTCCAGCC-3′ST8SiaIVΔ3355AAT → CAGN119Q5′-CAGACGCCGGACGCTGCAGATTTCCCATGATCTGCAC-3′5′-GTGCAGATCATGGGAAATCTGCAGCGTCCGGCGTCTG-3′ST8SiaIVΔ4610AAT → CAAN204Q5′-GCATTTGGAGGCTTTCGGCAAGAGAGTGACAGAGC-3′5′-GCTCTGTCACTCTCTTGCCGAAAGCCTCCAAATGC-3′ST8SiaIVΔ5655AAT → CAGN219Q5′-GCATAGACTTTCCATGCTGCAGGACAGTGTCCTTTGG-3′5′-CCAAAGGACACTGTCCTGCAGCATGGAAAGTCTATGC-3′N-Glycosylation sites of ST8SiaII and ST8SiaIV were deleted by site-directed mutagenesis in a PCR approach using the mutation primers given in this table.

CHO cells of the complementation group 2A10 are PSA-negative because of a defect in the ST8SiaIV gene and were generated by chemical mutagenesis of CHO K1 cells (36Eckhardt M. Mühlenhoff M. Bethe A. Koopman J. Frosch M. Gerardy-Schahn R. Nature. 1995; 373: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 1:1 (Seromed) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum and 1 mmsodium pyruvate and maintained in a humidified 5% CO2atmosphere at 37 °C. For transient transfections 2 × 106 cells were grown overnight on 100-mm tissue culture dishes, rinsed twice with PBS (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4/150 mm NaCl), and transfected with 4 μg of plasmid DNA and 24 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 4 ml of OptiMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 7 h the transfection was stopped by adding 5 ml of medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. 24 h after the start of transfection the medium was substituted by 8 ml of medium containing 5% fetal calf serum, and the cells were harvested 48 h later. Alternatively, the cell supernatant was collected and used for measuring polysialyltransferase activityin vitro. For the selection of stable transfectants, cells were transfected as described and cultured 72 h later in the presence of 750 μg/ml G418 (Calbiochem). Colonies were picked and cloned by limiting dilution. Transfected cells of one 100-mm dish were lysed in 800 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm MnCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 200 units of aprotinin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay reagent (Pierce), the protein concentration was determined, and lysates were diluted with lysis buffer to a final concentration of 2.5 mg of protein/ml. For the immunoprecipitations 10 μl of wet Protein A-Sepharose covalently coupled with anti-HA mAb 12CA5 were added to 150 μl of lysate (375 μg of protein) and incubated overnight with gentle agitation at 4 °C. Thereafter, the beads were sedimented by centrifugation (5000 × g for 30 s) and washed twice with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40. The washing buffer was carefully removed, and 15 μl of Laemmli sample buffer were added. Flag-HA-tagged ST8SiaII and -IV were transiently expressed in CHO-2A10 cells and immunoprecipitated with anti-HA mAb 12CA5 as described above but using 400 μl of lysate (1 μg of protein) for each immunoprecipitation. Beads were washed twice with TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0/1 mm EDTA), and digests were performed in a final volume of 50 μl of TE buffer at 37 °C in a thermomixer (Eppendorf) at 1300 rpm for the indicated time points. Digests were started by adding 0.2 units PNGaseF for time points up to 15 min and 2 units for 1- and 3-h time points. Round-bottom microtiter plates (Greiner) were coated overnight with 0.2 μg of murine IgG (Pierce) at 4 °C and blocked with bovine serum albumin (1% in PBS) for 2 h at room temperature. After two washing steps with PBS, 10 μl of cell supernatant containing recombinant Protein A-fusion proteins were adsorbed for 1 h at 37 °C. In parallel, serial dilutions (4–0.2 ng/ml) of the recombinant IgG-binding fragment of Protein A (Sigma) were adsorbed to generate a standard curve. After the adsorption step, plates were washed three times with PBS, and 10 μl of 1: 50,000 diluted biotinylated anti-Protein A antibody SPA-27 were added per well. The plates were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C and washed three times with PBS. The bound biotinylated antibody was detected with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Roche) using 10 μl of a 1:2000 dilution per well. After 30 min at 37 °C plates were washed three times with PBS and developed with 50 μl of substrate solution containing 5 μg of 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine, 100 mm sodium acetate, 100 mm citric acid, and 0.0045% H2O2. Reactions were stopped after 20 min by adding 25 μl of 2 n H2SO4, and the optical density was measured in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader at 450 nm. All samples were measured in serial dilutions, and triple values were analyzed for each dilution. 500 ng of wild-type and mutant Protein A-polysialyltransferases were adsorbed to 10 μl of IgG-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Beads were washed twice with 1 ml of PBS and were used either directly for measuring autopolysialylation or for measuring NCAM polysialylation after the adsorption of 1 μg of Protein A-NCAM. Enzyme-coupled beads were washed three times with 1 ml of reaction buffer containing 10 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 6.0, and 10 mmMnCl2, and assays were started by adding 125 nCi of CMP-[14C]Neu5Ac in 40 μl of reaction buffer to give a final volume of 50 μl. Incubations were performed in a thermomixer (Eppendorf) at 1300 rpm for 2 h at 37 °C and stopped by washing twice with 1 ml of PBS. One of two parallel samples was treated with 100 ng of endoNE in a final volume of 50 μl of PBS for 30 min at 37 °C. After two additional washing steps with 1 ml of PBS, residual buffer was removed, and 15 μl of Laemmli sample buffer were added. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. SDS-PAGE was performed according to Laemmli (37Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). Samples were subjected to gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions using 2.5% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol. All samples were heated at 65 °C for 20 min, and 15 μl/slot were loaded on 10 or 7% polyacrylamide gels. For Western blot analysis, proteins were blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schüell), and blots were developed as described (26Mühlenhoff M. Eckhardt M. Bethe A. Frosch M. Gerardy-Schahn R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6943-6950Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) with primary antibodies used in a concentration of 5 μg/ml. For autoradiographic analysis, gels were vacuum-dried immediately after electrophoresis and exposed to Hyperfilm-MP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). LM-TK− cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Seromed) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Stable cell lines expressing Flag-HA-tagged polysialyltransferases were generated as described for CHO-2A10 cells. Transient transfections were performed using the Effectene transfection kit (Qiagen). 48 h before transfection, 8 × 104cells were seeded per well of a 6-well plate containing four glass coverslips. The cells were washed once with PBS, and 1.6 ml of fresh medium were added. 0.8 μg of plasmid DNA of wild-type or mutant Flag-HA-ST8SiaII/IV constructs in 100 μl of EC buffer, 6.4 μl of Enhancer, 8 μl of Effectene, and 600 μl of medium were mixed and added to the cells. 24 h after transfection, the cells were washed with PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, and washed twice with PBS. For detection of Golgi-localized antigens cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min at room temperature. For intracellular PSA staining, coverslips were incubated with endoNE (60 ng/ml in PBS) for 30 min at 37 °C to remove PSA on the cell surface prior to permeabilization. Immunodetections were carried out for 1 h at 37 °C with anti-PSA mAb 735 (5 μg/ml), anti-Flag mAb M5 (3.5 μg/ml), and rabbit anti-α-mannosidase II antiserum (1:2000) in 20% horse serum in PBS. After washing four times with PBS, the cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with sheep anti-mouse IgG-Cy3 (1:300, Sigma) and goat anti-rabbit IgG-ALEXA 488 (1:500, Molecular Probes) in 20% horse serum in PBS. The cells were washed three times with PBS, and coverslips were mounted in Moviol and analyzed under a Zeiss Axiophot fluorescence microscope. The schematic representations of polysialyltransferases shown in Fig.1 A illustrate the number and relative locations of the predicted five and six N-glycan attachment sites in ST8SiaIV (36Eckhardt M. Mühlenhoff M. Bethe A. Koopman J. Frosch M. Gerardy-Schahn R. Nature. 1995; 373: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) and ST8SiaII (38Livingston B.D. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11504-11507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. To determine how many of these sites are effectively used in the native proteins, full-length murine ST8SiaII and hamster ST8SiaIV, N-terminally tagged with Flag and HA epitopes, were analyzed by limited PNGaseF digestions followed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis (Fig.1, B and C). Native Flag-HA-ST8SiaIV migrated as a focused band of 55 kDa (Fig. 1 B, lane 1). After 180 min PNGaseF treatment the completely deglycosylated protein migrated with the expected molecular mass of 44 kDa (calculated 44.1 kDa). Partially deglycosylated enzymes were displayed after 2, 5, 15, and 60 min. In agreement with the approximate molecular mass of a single N-linked oligosaccharide chain, individual bands were separated by about 3 kDa. A total of six bands was displayed, demonstrating that five N-linked oligosaccharides are attached to ST8SiaIV. Fig. 1 C shows the results obtained for Flag-HA-ST8SiaII. The native protein migrated as a double band at 60 and 57 kDa (lane 1), suggesting the presence of two glycosylation variants. Complete deglycosylation (lane 6) resulted in a protein of 45 kDa (calculated 45.3 kDa), and partial digestions (see lanes 2–5) displayed a total of seven bands, indicating the presence of six N-linked carbohydrate chains in ST8SiaII. In summary these data show that all predicted N-glycan attachment sites are used in the recombinant polysialyltransferases isolated from CHO cells. For convenience, the numbers as shown in Fig.1 A will be used in the following text to refer to individualN-glycan attachment sites. To estimate the importance of individual carbohydrate chains for the enzymatic activity of the polysialyltransferases, N-glycosylation sites were inactivated, individually or in different combinations, by replacing asparagine in the glycosylation sequon Asn-XXX-Ser/Thr with glutamine (see Table I for details). 17 mutants were generated for ST8SiaIV (Fig.2) and 29 for ST8SiaII (Fig.3) including aglyco-variants (∅) and mutants containing only single N-glycan attachment sites (series +1, +2, etc.). Activities of mutant proteins were tested in vivo and in vitro. In vivo activities were measured by complementation analysis in CHO-2A10 cells. In CHO wild-type cells, ST8SiaIV is responsible for PSA expression. Because of a defect in the ST8SiaIV gene, cells of the complementation group 2A10 are unable to polysialylate NCAM (18Windfuhr M"

To investigate the possibility that this phenotype could be due to disruption of normal cellular adhesion to extracellular matrix, an assay was developed in which 293 cells co-expressing MARCKS and green fluorescent protein were tested for their adhesion competence on various substrates. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting of adherent and non-adherent green fluorescent protein-expressing cells demonstrated that wild-type MARCKS inhibited adhesion of cells to fibronectin, whereas a non-myristoylated mutant did not inhibit adhesion of cells to a variety of substrates. The fibronectin competitive inhibitor RGD peptide inhibited adhesion of cells expressing all MARCKS variants equally. Cytochalasin D inhibited the adhesion of cells expressing non-myristoylated MARCKS, but did not further decrease the adhesion of cells expressing adhesion-inhibitory proteins. Confocal microscopy demonstrated the presence of inhibitory, myristoylated MARCKS at the plasma membrane, suggesting that localization at this region might be important for MARCKS to inhibit cellular adhesion. These data suggest a possible myristoylation-dependent function of MARCKS to inhibit cellular adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins, indicating a potential mechanism for the cell migration defects seen in the MARCKS-deficient mice.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 3987-3988Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), a functional role for MARCKS remains elusive. Gene targeting experiments have demonstrated that MARCKS is essential for central nervous system development and postnatal life in the mouse (6Stumpo D. Bock C. Tuttle J. Blackshear P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 944-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Defects seen in the brains of developing MARCKS-deficient embryos included frequent abnormal neurulation and failure of fusion of forebrain hemispheres. There was also universal neuronal and retinal ectopia, resulting from the inappropriate migration of neurons, as well as deficiencies in laminin and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (7Blackshear P. Silver J. Nairn A. Sulik K. Squier M. Stumpo D. Tuttle J. Exp. Neurol. 1997; 145: 46-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), two components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) involved in migration of developing neurons (8Oohira A. Matsui F. Tokita Y. Yamauchi S. Aono S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 374: 24-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 9Liesi P. Experientia (Basel). 1990; 46: 900-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). These experiments suggested that MARCKS can regulate the ability of neurons to migrate normally; however, it was unclear whether this abnormality was at the level of cell:cell interactions, cell:ECM interactions, or even in the regulation of proteases involved in the remodeling of the ECM. MARCKS and its related protein, the MARCKS-like protein (MLP; also known as F52, MRP, or MacMARCKS) constitute a small family of heat-stable, acidic proteins, containing three regions of near-identity (2Blackshear P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1501-1504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An eight-residue domain in the amino-terminal portion of the protein surrounds the single intron splice site and is identical to a region of unknown function within the cytoplasmic domain of the mannose 6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor II receptor. The other two regions include an amino-terminal consensus sequence, which directs the co-translational addition of the 14-carbon myristoyl moiety, and a highly basic region of 25 amino acids containing the PKC phosphorylatable serines, known as the phosphorylation site domain (PSD). These two regions are responsible, respectively, for the hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions of MARCKS with negatively charged lipids in cellular membranes (10Seykora J. Myat M. Allen L.

Chem. 1997; 272: 23833-23842Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, a direct interaction between MARCKS and these proteins in intact cells has not been demonstrated convincingly. Based on the morphological defects seen in the MARCKS-deficient mice, we speculated that MARCKS could be directly involved in cell:ECM and/or cell:cell interactions. To begin to analyze a role for MARCKS in the regulation of cell:ECM interactions, we have designed an assay based on the overexpression of MARCKS in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. By co-transfecting green fluorescent protein (GFP) and using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), we were able to demonstrate that overexpression of MARCKS reduces the ability of these cells to adhere to various extracellular matrix components. In addition, we demonstrate that myristoylation of the protein and plasma membrane localization are both necessary, but neither is sufficient, for this inhibitory effect on cellular adhesion to occur. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells, obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA), were grown in Eagle's minimum essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin. Cells were maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2, 95% air in a water-jacketed incubator. The non-myristoylatable and PSD mutants of the bovine MARCKS cDNA have been described previously (11Swierczynski S. Blackshear P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13436-13445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). They are designated here as follows: wild-type (WT); alanine, glycine, asparagine, or aspartic acid replacement of the four phosphorylatable serines within the PSD (AS, GS, NS, or DS, respectively); alanine replacement of the amino-terminal glycine preventing myristoylation (A2G2); and the non-myristoylated (A2G2) and “pseudo-phosphorylated” (DS) double mutant (DBL). A HindII/EcoRI insert from each of the parent mutant constructs was purified, and the ends were made flush with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase. Blunt-ended inserts were ligated into the pCMV4 vector (31Woodford-Thomas T.A. Rhodes J.D. Dixon J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 401-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), which had been digested withSmaI and treated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (Life Technologies, Inc.). JM109 cells were transformed, ampicillin-resistant colonies were picked, and plasmid DNA was purified. Clones containing inserts were tested for MARCKS expression by transient transfection into 293 cells followed by radiolabeling withl-[35S]cysteine and immunoprecipitation with MARCKS-specific antibodies (32Spizz G. Blackshear P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 553-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Expressing clones were re-transformed, and DNA was prepared by large scale plasmid preparations followed by double-band purification on cesium chloride density gradients (33Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). MARCKS-GFP and MARCKS-RFP fusion constructs were made by digesting the pCMV4 plasmids containing various MARCKS inserts (above) withBsgI and digesting the 3′ overhangs of the inserts with T4 DNA polymerase and Klenow fragment, followed by digestion withHindIII and purification of the MARCKS inserts. The inserts were subcloned into HindIII/SmaI-digested and phosphatase-treated pEGFP-N1 or pDsRed1-N1 (CLONTECH Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA). Transformed JM109 cells were selected with kanamycin (30 µg/ml, Sigma), and clones containing inserts were tested for expression by transient transfection into 293 cells followed by immunoblotting of lysates with GFP-, RFP-, and MARCKS-specific antibodies (see below). The GFP fusion peptide containing the myristoylated amino-terminal 58 amino acids of bovine MARCKS, Myr58, was made as follows; pCMV4AS was digested with SstI and PstI, and a 220-base pair fragment was purified and ligated into the pEGFP-N1 vector that had been digested with the same enzymes. Clones were analyzed for expression by immunoblotting as described above. All DNA modifying enzymes were from Life Technologies, Inc. 293 cells were transfected with DNA by the calcium phosphate precipitation method (34Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6483) Google Scholar). Cells were plated at a density of 1–1.5 × 106 cells/100-mm (58 cm2) tissue culture plate (Costar, Cambridge, MA) or an equivalent cell density on different size plates. The specific amounts of DNA transfected are indicated in the figure legends. Following 4 h of exposure to DNA, cells were rinsed once in 0.9% NaCl, refed with growth medium, and grown for an additional 48 h before harvesting. Multiwell tissue culture plates (Costar) were coated with 5 µg/cm2 poly-d-lysine (PDL), 2 µg/cm2 fibronectin or collagen, or 4 µg/cm2 laminin. All were obtained from Collaborative Biomedical Products (Bedford, MA). All matrix components were diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) except collagen, which was diluted in 0.05 n HCl. Plates were coated for 1–2 h at room temperature with gentle shaking. Plates were rinsed three times with deionized H2O, followed by blocking of nonspecific sites with 1% (w/v) heat-denatured bovine serum albumin (low fatty acid content, Sigma) in PBS (35Palmantier R. Roberts J.D. Glasgow W.C. Eling T. Olden K. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2206-2212PubMed Google Scholar). Blocking was either overnight at 4 °C or at room temperature for 1–2 h. Plates were rinsed five times with H2O and air-dried under a laminar flow hood. To test the adhesion of 293 cells, transfected cells were collected by pipetting a stream of growth medium at the monolayer. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 600 × g at room temperature for 5 min, followed by rinsing with serum-free medium and re-pelleting. Cell pellets were gently resuspended in 3 ml of serum-free medium by pipetting to ensure that no visible clumps of cells were present. One-half ml was plated on each of 3 pre-coated wells of a 24-multiwell tissue culture cluster plate (Costar). The remaining cell suspension was analyzed for MARCKS expression (see below). Following adhesion for 10 min at 37 °C, the medium containing non-adherent cells was collected at room temperature by gently pipetting the medium three times over the adherent cells in order to release all non-adherent cells without disturbing the adherent cells. The adherent cells were gently rinsed once with saline (0.9% NaCl) at room temperature and released from the plates by treatment with 0.25% trypsin (w/v) in calcium- and magnesium-free Hanks' balanced salt solution (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 1 mm EDTA at 37 °C for 10 min, or until cells were released from the dish. Final suspensions of adherent and non-adherent cells prepared for flow cytometry contained 3% (v/v) FCS, 0.07% (w/v) trypsin, and 1% (v/v) formaldehyde. Using a FacSort flow cytometer and CellQuest software (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), cells were sorted for size (Fig.1, R1), and then for fluorescence due to GFP (Fig. 1, R2). Five to ten thousand cells were sorted for each sample, and the percentage of GFP-expressing cells within each population was analyzed. The percentage of GFP-expressing cells in the adherent population was divided by the percentage of GFP-expressing cells in the non-adherent population; this figure was used as an index of overall cell adhesion. The efficiency of transfection among different experiments ranged from 10% to 30%. However, differences in transfection efficiency did not alter experimental outcome. Each point represents the mean ± S.D. of three individual values. Each experiment was repeated at least three times with similar results. Both trypan blue exclusion and propidium iodide staining were used to rule out possible artifactual effects due to cell death (data not shown). In the case of RGD peptide treatment of cells, transfected 293 cells were prepared for FACS analysis essentially as described above, except for the following modifications: Transfected 293 cells were resuspended in serum-free medium containing GRGDSP or control GRADSP peptides (Life Technologies, Inc.) at a final concentration of 1 mm. Cells were then allowed to adhere to fibronectin-coated plates for 15 min. The cells from a single 100-mm plate were plated on a fibronectin-coated 9.6-cm2 dish. The final cell suspensions of both adherent and nonadherent cells subjected to FACS analysis contained 1% (v/v) formaldehyde, and the adherent cell samples also contained 0.17% (w/v) trypsin. In the case of cytochalasin D treatment of cells, transfected cells were incubated with 1 µm cytochalasin D prepared in Me2SO, or an equivalent amount of Me2SO, for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were then analyzed for adhesion as described above, including the modifications used for the RGD treatment. Cell suspensions, 1.5 ml of the suspensions used for the adhesion assays (see above), were processed for immunoblotting by rinsing with PBS and lysing in immunoprecipitation buffer containing protease inhibitors (32Spizz G. Blackshear P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 553-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Solubilized pellets were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, followed by thawing and centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Clarified supernatants were treated with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) sample buffer (32Spizz G. Blackshear P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 553-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 10% polyacrylamide gels, followed by electrophoretic transfer to nitrocellulose filters. Filters were blocked with 5% (w/v) dry milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 3% (v/v) Tween 20, followed by incubation for 1 h at room temperature with the appropriate primary antibody in the same buffer. A commercial rabbit anti-GFP or anti-RFP antibody was used according to the manufacturer's instructions (CLONTECH Laboratories). An IgG fraction from a polyclonal MARCKS-specific antibody (36Lobaugh L.A. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18393-18399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used at 1:100. Goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second antibodies (Bio-Rad) were used at 1:5000 in the same buffer, and reactive proteins were detected with enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). When necessary, films were scanned by scanning densitometry followed by analysis using the public domain NIH Image program. 293 cells were plated and transfected on two-well Lab-Tek chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International, Naperville, IL). In some cases the slides were pre-coated with fibronectin to ensure that the cells remained attached to the surface throughout the fixation protocol. Preliminary experiments demonstrated similar morphology of 293 cells on uncoated or treated surfaces (data not shown). To prepare cells for the detection of GFP or RFP fluorescence, the medium was removed 48 h following transfection, the monolayers were rinsed briefly in PBS, and the cells were fixed for 10 min at room temperature in freshly prepared 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS (37Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. 1st Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Residual fix solution was removed, and the cells were rinsed briefly in PBS. The upper chamber portions of the slides were removed, and the fixed cells were treated with Prolong Anti-fade (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and mounted under a coverslip. Images were collected using a Zeiss Inverted Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope, LSM-510, (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY); an excitation wavelength of 488 nm with an LP 505 emission filter, or wavelength of 543 nm with an LP 560 emission filter, was used to detect GFP or RFP, respectively. Images were analyzed using the LSM-510 Image software. In the case of cytochalasin D treatment and rhodamine-phalloidin staining of actin filaments prior to confocal microscopy, transfected cells were treated with Me2SO or cytochalasin D as described above. Cells were fixed and stained with rhodamine-phalloidin according to the manufacturer's instructions (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and detected as described above; an excitation wavelength of 488 nm with an LP 505 emission filter, or wavelength of 543 nm with an LP 560 emission filter, was used to detect GFP or rhodamine-phalloidin, respectively In order to analyze the ability of MARCKS to regulate cellular adhesion on a single cell basis, we used GFP as an indicator of transfection that would also allow cells to be sorted by FACS. Two approaches were used. In the first approach, cells were co-transfected with separate GFP- and MARCKS-expressing plasmids, using the assumption that all GFP-expressing cells should also have been transfected with the MARCKS cDNA. In the second approach, single plasmids expressing MARCKS-GFP fusion proteins were transfected. These independent methods were used to exclude the possibility that results obtained with the fusion proteins were anomalous. The ability of 293 cells to adhere to various protein matrices was first tested (data not shown). The most consistent levels of adhesion between experiments were obtained following adhesion of the cells to fibronectin; this matrix protein was therefore used in subsequent experiments. In the standard assay, 48 h following transfection, cells were allowed to adhere to fibronectin for 10 min at 37 °C, followed by collection for FACS analysis as described under “Materials and Methods.” To compensate for the fact that variable percentages of cells expressed the transfected proteins, the percentage of GFP-expressing cells in the adherent population divided by the percentage of GFP-expressing cells in the non-adherent population was used as the index of cellular adhesion. When the cells were co-transfected with both the GFP expression plasmid and the CMV vector alone, the ratio of adherent/nonadherent cells was 1.3 ± 0.07 (Fig. 2; mean ± S.D. of three values), whereas cells co-transfected with the pCMV4-MARCKS plasmid and the GFP plasmid exhibited a ratio of 0.6 ± 0.03 adherent/nonadherent cells (p < 10−4). In a parallel experiment, in which GFP was expressed alone or as a MARCKS-GFP fusion protein, the ratios of adherent/nonadherent cells were 0.92 ± 0.04 and 0.47 ± 0.07, respectively (p < 10−4) (Fig. 2). Using scanning densitometry of immunoblots probed with MARCKS-specific antibodies (Fig. 2, inset; data not shown), the level of ectopic MARCKS-GFP expression was determined to be ∼60–100-fold greater than endogenous MARCKS. When adjusted for the percentage of cells expressing the GFP fusion proteins as ascertained through FACS analysis, 15–30%, it was determined that MARCKS-GFP expression ranged from 200- to 700-fold over endogenous MARCKS. Using the same approach, it was determined that cells expressing MARCKS as a non-fusion protein exhibited much lower levels, 10–50-fold above endogenous. These data demonstrated that increased wild-type MARCKS expression, when co-expressed with GFP either as separate proteins or as a fusion protein, resulted in the decreased ability of 293 cells to adhere to a fibronectin-coated surface. MARCKS is thought to associate with the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane through hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions of its myristoylated amino terminus and its PSD, respectively. Mutants in these two domains that were used to determine the requirement of both of these regions for membrane association (11Swierczynski S. Blackshear P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13436-13445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 12Swierczynski S. Blackshear P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23424-23430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) were used to evaluate whether either or both domains were responsible for the observed decrease in 293 cell adhesion to fibronectin. Expression of the wild-type MARCKS-GFP fusion protein, and the various non-phosphorylatable, constitutively membrane-associated mutants, AS-, GS-, and NS-GFP fusion proteins, exhibited essentially identical adherent/nonadherent cell ratios of 0.5 ± 0.07, 0.5 ± 0.03, 0.5 ± 0.06, and 0.5 ± 0.01, respectively (p < 0.002 when compared with the mean of the values from the control GFP-expressing cells using the Bonferroni correction for multiple means; Ref. 38Godfrey K. N. Engl. J. Med. 1985; 313: 1450-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar) (Fig.3A). The DS (pseudo-phosphorylated)-GFP fusion protein resulted in an adherent/nonadherent cell ratio similar to that of the constitutively membrane-bound mutants of 0.5 ± 0.001 (p < 0.002 when compared with the control GFP-expressing cells, using the Bonferroni correction for multiple means). However, the A2G2 (non-myristoylated)- and DBL (non-myristoylated, pseudo-phosphorylated)-GFP fusion proteins resulted in adherent/nonadherent cell ratios of 0.8 ± 0.05 and 0.97 ± 0.01, respectively (Fig. 3 A). Both values were not significantly different from those obtained with the control GFP-expressing cells, which exhibited a ratio of 0.92 ± 0.04 adherent/nonadherent cells (Fig. 3 A). Therefore, whereas myristoylation of the protein appeared to be necessary for inhibition of adhesion under these conditions, the pseudo-phosphorylated version of the PSD, in a normally myristoylated protein, did not interfere with the MARCKS inhibition of 293 cell adhesion to fibronectin. Consistent with the observation that the pseudo-phosphorylated mutant inhibited adhesion to the same degree as the wild-type protein and the non-phosphorylatable, myristoylated mutants, was the observation that phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate treatment (1.6 µm in 0.01% Me2SO for 10 min before plating) of 293 cells expressing wild-type or mutant MARCKS did not alter the MARCKS effects on adhesion (data not shown), supporting our finding that MARCKS inhibition of 293 cells is likely to be PKC-independent. The data suggesting that myristoylation was necessary for MARCKS to inhibit adhesion to fibronectin suggested the possibility that a similar inhibition of adhesion could occur with the overexpression of any myristoylated peptide. To test this, a GFP fusion peptide was tested that consisted of the amino-terminal 58 amino acids of MARCKS, including the myristoylation site. The effect of this peptide on adhesion was compared with the effects of the NS-, DS-, and DBL mutant MARCKS-GFP fusion proteins. Control GFP transfections resulted in a ratio of 0.88 ± 0.03 adherent/nonadherent cells (Fig.3 B). The NS- and DS-GFP mutant protein-expressing cells exhibited adherent/nonadherent cell ratios of 0.60 ± 0.06 and 0.64 ± 0.04, respectively, values that were significantly different from those obtained in the control GFP-expressing cells (p < 0.004) (Fig. 3 B). The DBL-GFP-expressing cells exhibited an adherent/nonadherent cell ratio of 0.91 ± 0.03, which was not significantly different from that obtained with the GFP-expressing cells (Fig. 3 B). Expression of the myristoylated 58-residue amino-terminal MARCKS peptide (Myr58) demonstrated an adherent/nonadherent cell ratio of 0.78 ± 0.004 (Fig. 3 B). Although this value was slightly less than that obtained for the GFP-expressing cells (p < 0.01), in no experiment did this mutant ever inhibit adhesion to the same degree as the full-length myristoylated protein, and in certain instances, the adherent/nonadherent ratio seen with this mutant was the same as that seen for GFP or GFP-DBL expressing cells. These data demonstrated that expression of at least one myristoylated peptide alone is not sufficient to inhibit adhesion of 293 cells to fibronectin in this assay, at least not to the same extent as the full-length MARCKS protein, and that other regions of MARCKS are required, in addition to the myristoyl moiety, to promote inhibited adhesion. Approximately equal expression of all full-length mutants was demonstrated by immunoblotting, indicating that the observed differences in adhesion were not due to"

Although gliadins are mainly monomeric, glutenins consist of very large disulfide-linked polymers made up of high molecular weight and low molecular weight subunits. These polymers are among the largest protein molecules known in nature and are the most important determinants of the viscoelastic properties of gluten. As a first step toward the elucidation of the folding and assembly pathways that lead to glutenin polymer formation, we have exploited an in vitro system composed of wheat germ extract and bean microsomes to examine the role of disulfide bonds in the structural maturation of a low molecular weight glutenin subunit. When conditions allowing the formation of disulfide bonds were established, the in vitrosynthesized low molecular weight glutenin subunit was recovered in monomeric form containing intrachain disulfide bonds. Conversely, synthesis under conditions that did not favor the formation of disulfide bonds led to the production of large aggregates from which the polypeptides could not be rescued by the post-translational generation of a more oxidizing environment. These results indicate that disulfide bond formation is essential for the conformational maturation of the low molecular weight glutenin subunit and suggest that early folding steps may play an important role in this process, allowing the timely pairing of critical cysteine residues. To determine which cysteines were important to maintain the protein in monomeric form, we prepared a set of mutants containing selected cysteine to serine substitutions. Our results show that two conserved cysteine residues form a critical disulfide bond that is essential in preventing the exposure of adhesive domains and the consequent formation of aberrant aggregates.

Because of their nutritional and technological importance, these proteins have been the target of a variety of studies concerning their biochemical features, their synthesis and intracellular transport (1Galili G. Shimoni Y. Giorini-Silfen S. Levanony H. Altschuler Y. Shani N. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 1996; 34: 245-252Google Scholar). The polymerization state is a critical feature distinguishing gliadins from glutenins. Although gliadins (which are divided into α, γ, and ω types) are largely recovered in monomeric form, glutenins consist of large polymers whose building blocks are the high molecular weight (HMW)1 and the low molecular weight (LMW) glutenin subunits. High molecular weight glutenin subunits are constituted by a central repetitive domain flanked by two nonrepetitive regions containing cysteine residues critical for glutenin cross-linking. Two regions can instead be recognized in the primary structure of LMW glutenin subunits; one region is an N-terminal domain largely made up of repeated sequences, and the other is a C-terminal domain of unique sequence, where all the intrachain disulfide bonds are located (Fig.1). Low molecular weight glutenin subunits are structurally related to monomeric α- and γ-gliadins but critically contain two additional cysteine residues that remain available for the formation of interchain disulfides and that have been proposed to be responsible for the polymeric nature of these proteins (2Shewry P.R. Tatham A.S. J. Cereal Sci. 1997; 25: 207-227Crossref Scopus (452) Google Scholar). One of these residues is located in the N-terminal region of the polypeptide (at two alternative positions, designated Caand Cb* (3Keck B. Köhler P. Wieser H. Z. Lebensm.-Unters.-Forsch. 1995; 200: 432-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 4Köhler P. Belitz H.-D. Wieser H. Z.

Genet. 1997; 95: 1119-1126Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar)), whereas the other (C×) is located in the C-terminal domain (Fig. 1). Although the detailed structure of glutenin polymers remains unknown, available data indicate that LMW glutenin subunits are linked via disulfide bonds not only to other subunits of the same class but also to HMW glutenin subunits and to polypeptides related to γ-gliadins (2Shewry P.R. Tatham A.S. J. Cereal Sci. 1997; 25: 207-227Crossref Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Information about the structure of the individual LMW glutenin subunits is also rather sparse, and this is in part due to difficulties in applying x-ray diffraction or NMR analysis to these polypeptides. However, important information is provided by studies on the disulfide bonding pattern of these proteins, as deduced from the analysis of cystine peptides derived from whole glutenin (3Keck B. Köhler P. Wieser H. Z. Lebensm.-Unters.-Forsch. 1995; 200: 432-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 4Köhler P. Belitz H.-D. Wieser H. Z.

Cereal Sci. 1998; 27: 109-116Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Intrachain and interchain disulfide bonds cannot be unequivocally distinguished by these chemical mapping studies, but the presence of three intrachain disulfide bonds in LMW glutenin subunits can be inferred by analogy with the situation found in monomeric gliadins (6Müller S. Vensel W.H. Kasarda D.D. Köhler P. Wieser H. J. Cereal Sci. 1998; 27: 109-116Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 7Müller S. Wieser H. Popineau Y. J.

Cereal Sci. 1995; 22: 21-27Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and on the basis of in vitro refolding studies (10Thompson S. Bishop D.H.L. Madgwick P. Tatham A.S. Shewry P.R. J. Agric. Food Chem. 1994; 42: 426-431Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The position of some of the cysteine residues that are involved in these intrachain disulfide bonds is conserved not only in gliadin polypeptides but also in cereal α-amylase/trypsin inhibitors and in 2S albumin storage proteins (11Egorov T.A. Odintsova T.I. Musolyamov A.Kh. Fido R. Tatham A.S. Shewry P.R. FEBS Lett. 1996; 396: 285-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This suggests that all these proteins may share a common fold in which disulfide bonds play an important and perhaps essential role. Still, direct information about the role of intrachain disulfide bonds in the folding of all these proteins and of LMW glutenin subunits in particular is rather sparse (12Altschuler Y. Galili G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6677-6682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Shimoni Y. Galili G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18869-18874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Many aspects of glutenin polymer assembly, transport, and deposition also remain unclear. Because gliadins and glutenins extracted from mature grains are largely insoluble in aqueous solutions, it was initially suggested that these proteins spontaneously precipitate and rapidly form insoluble deposits immediately after insertion in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). However, this hypothesis was difficult to reconcile with the idea that storage proteins must have specific characteristics that allow both their efficient packaging during seed development and their rapid rehydration upon germination. Indeed, more recent studies show that the assembly of the gliadin fraction occurs in a slow and possibly ordered fashion and involves the formation of soluble monomeric intermediates (13Shimoni Y. Galili G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18869-18874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The pathway leading to the formation of the glutenin polymer remains unknown, but it also probably involves the regulated assembly of soluble monomeric subunits. It is also likely that glutenin polymer assembly begins in the ER, where protein folding and assembly can be assisted by molecular chaperons and folding enzymes (14Galili G. Sengupta-Gopalan C. Ceriotti A. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 38: 1-29Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Most importantly, studies performed in yeast and mammalian cells indicate that this compartment contains an oxidase machinery that plays an essential role in disulfide bond formation and that could therefore also assist the biogenesis of the disulfide-linked glutenin polymer (15Frand A.R. Cuozzo J.W. Kaiser C.A. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 203-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Consistent with this view, immunocytochemical analysis of thin sections from developing wheat seeds indicates that a large fraction of wheat storage proteins assemble inside the ER into so called “protein bodies,” which are then transported via an autophagic process to the storage vacuole (16Levanony H. Rubin R. Altschuler Y. Galili G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1117-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Given the complex situation found in wheat endosperm cells, wheat storage protein structural maturation can be more easily studied using simplified systems, such as transgenic plants expressing individual subunits (17Shani N. Rosenberg N. Kasarda D.D. Galili G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8924-8930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or in vitro translation systems. Indeed, this latter kind of approach has been successfully used to study the assembly of other storage proteins (18Nam Y.-W. Jung R. Nielsen N.C. Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 1629-1639Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 19Jung R. Nam Y.-W. Saalbach I. Müntz K. Nielsen N.C. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 2037-2050PubMed Google Scholar, 20Jung R.

Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 597-609Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and a cell-free system constituted of rabbit reticulocyte lysate and canine microsomal membranes has been shown to support disulfide bond formation in wild-type and modified gliadin polypeptides (23Bulleid N.J. Freedman R.B. Biochem. J. 1988; 254: 805-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 24Bulleid N.J. Freedman R.B. Nature. 1988; 335: 649-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). In this work, we have exploited an in vitro system constituted of a wheat germ extract and microsomes obtained from bean cotyledons to investigate the role of specific cysteine residues in the structural maturation of a LMW glutenin polypeptide. Our results suggest that formation of soluble monomeric subunits is an early step on the pathway of glutenin polymer assembly and indicate that one intrachain disulfide bond plays a major role in monomer maturation, possibly by maintaining adhesive domains in a buried state and, thus, preventing the precocious aggregation of the newly synthesized polypeptides. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's instructions. Silent mutations creating or eliminating diagnostic restriction sites were introduced to simplify the detection of recombinant clones. The coding sequence of the mutagenized clones was examined to confirm the introduction of the desired mutations and to exclude the fortuitous insertion of undesired ones. To prepare a construct (pBSΔSP) coding for a mutant LMW glutenin subunit lacking the putative signal peptide (25Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4928) Google Scholar), the B11-33-coding sequence was amplified with oligonucleotides CGCAGATCTGGGACTATGCAGATGGAGACTAGC and GAATTCAGATCTTATCAGTAGGCACCAACTCCGG using pSP64a-B1133 (a kind gift from Gad Galili) as template. The amplification product was digested withBglII and cloned into BglII cut pSP64T (26Krieg P.A. Melton D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 7057-7070Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). ABglII fragment containing the coding sequence was then isolated and cloned into the BamHI site of vector pBluescript II KS+ (Stratagene). Plasmid pSP64a-B1133 or derivatives of this plasmid bearing the various cysteine to serine substitutions were linearized with EcoRI and transcribedin vitro with SP6 polymerase. Plasmid pBSΔSP was linearized with XbaI and transcribed using T3 polymerase.In vitro transcriptions were performed in the presence of the cap analogue m7(5′)Gppp(5′)G (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), as previously described (27Ceriotti A. Pedrazzini E. De Silvestris M. Vitale A. Galbraith D.W. Bourque D.P. Bohnert H.J. Plant Cell Biology. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1995: 295-308Google Scholar). The transcripts were visually quantified by comparison to appropriate standards on formaldehyde/agarose gels and stored at −80 °C. Nuclease-treated microsomes from mid-maturation Phaseolus vulgaris cotyledons were prepared as described (27Ceriotti A. Pedrazzini E. De Silvestris M. Vitale A. Galbraith D.W. Bourque D.P. Bohnert H.J. Plant Cell Biology. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1995: 295-308Google Scholar). Synthetic mRNAs were translated in vitro in a reaction containing (for a final volume of 12.5 µl) 6.25 µl of wheat germ extract (Promega, prepared in a buffer containing 10 mmdithiothreitol (DTT)), 0.25 µl of 40 units/µl RNaseOUT (Life Technologies, Inc.), 1 µl of 1 mm amino acid mixture (minus leucine), 0.8 µl of 1 m potassium acetate, 1.2 µl of [3H]leucine (120–190 Ci/mmol, 5 µCi/µl,Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 1 µl of mRNA solution (25–100 ng/µl). When indicated, bean microsomes (1–4 µl, 50A 280/ml) and/or oxidized glutathione (from a 12.5 times stock in water, pH 7.8) were included in the translation reaction. In most experiments the amino acid mixture and the 3H-labeled leucine were dried down in a speed-vac concentrator before assembling the reaction. Translations were performed at 25 °C and were terminated by the addition of RNase A or cycloheximide at a final concentration of 50 µg/ml or 2 mm, respectively. For samples that were separated under nonreducing conditions, iodoacetamide was added to a final concentration of 100 mm. Samples were incubated 10 min on ice, mixed with 6 volumes of 20 mm Tris-HCl,pH 8.6, 6% SDS, 8% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue, and then heated for 5 min at 100 °C. For separation under reducing conditions, samples were mixed with 6 volumes of 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.6, 6% SDS, 8% glycerol, 50 mm DTT, 0.01% bromphenol blue and heated for 5 min at 100 °C. After cooling, iodoacetamide was added to a final concentration of 100 mm, and samples were incubated for 45 min at room temperature. For the protease protection assay, aliquots of the translation reaction were treated as described previously (27Ceriotti A. Pedrazzini E. De Silvestris M. Vitale A. Galbraith D.W. Bourque D.P. Bohnert H.J. Plant Cell Biology. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1995: 295-308Google Scholar), except that incubation was for 15 min at 25 °C with a proteinase K concentration of 50 µg/ml. SDS-PAGE was performed using the system of Laemmli (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207018) Google Scholar), with a separating gel containing 15% acrylamide and an acrylamide/bisacrylamide ratio of 200:1. Gels were treated for fluorography as described by Bonner and Laskey (29Bonner W.M. Laskey R.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 46: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (5621) Google Scholar). For sedimentation velocity analysis on sucrose gradients, in vitro translations were terminated by adding cycloheximide at a final concentration of 2 mm. N-Ethylmaleimide was then added at a final concentration of 40 mm, and microsomes were recovered by centrifugation at 35,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C in a SW 55 Ti rotor (Beckman Instruments) through a high salt/sucrose cushion (250 mm sucrose, 500 mmpotassium acetate, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9) (30Elliott J.G. Oliver J.D. High S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13849-13855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The pellet was resuspended in dilution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl, 1% Triton X-100) and loaded on a 4.8 ml linear sucrose gradient (5% to 25% sucrose in 20 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100). Gradients were centrifuged for 16 h at 45,000 rpm in a SW 55 Ti rotor at 4 °C and fractionated from the top using an AutoDensi-Flow apparatus (Labconco, Kansas City, MO). Material sedimented at the bottom of the gel was recovered (10 min at 80 °C) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.1% SDS. Equivalent amounts of gradient fractions and resuspended pellet were diluted with half a volume of 600 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.6, 25% glycerol, 18% SDS, and 0.03% bromphenol blue, and DTT was added to a final concentration of 50 mm. The samples were then heated for 5 min at 100 °C. After cooling, iodoacetamide was added to a final concentration of 100 mm, and samples were incubated for 45 min at room temperature before loading on the gel. Clone B11-33 codes for a LMW glutenin subunit of wheat cultivar Cheyenne (31Okita T.W. Cheesbrough V. Reeves C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8203-8213Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When synthetic mRNA corresponding to the full open reading frame of this clone was translated in a wheat germ system in the absence of microsomal membranes, a major polypeptide of M r 41,000 was synthesized (Fig.2A, lane 1). The mobility of this polypeptide is lower than expected on the basis of the predicted M r of the encoded protein (34,213). We have not investigated the reason(s) for this anomalous migration behavior, but it may be due to the presence the proline-rich repetitive domain. Indeed, other proline-rich proteins have abnormally low mobility on SDS-PAGE (32Pham D.Q.-D. Sivasubramanian N. Gene. 1992; 122: 345-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 33Robinson R. Kauffman D.L. Waye M.M.Y. Blum M. Bennick A. Keller P.J. Biochem. J. 1989; 263: 497-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and in the case of HMW glutenin subunits, this has been directly related to the presence of the proline-rich repetitive domain (34D'Ovidio R. Anderson O.D. Masci S. Skerritt J. Porceddu E. J. Cereal Sci. 1997; 25: 1-8Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). When P. vulgarismicrosomes were included in the translation mixture, a second faster-migrating and poorly resolved polypeptide was generated (lane 2). This second polypeptide, likely resulting from removal of the signal peptide, became the major translation product when the amount of microsomes was further increased (lanes 3and 4). Higher amounts of microsomes were found to inhibit the incorporation of radioactive amino acids (lane 5). Segregation into microsomes was verified using a protease protection assay (Fig. 2 B). Although no protected polypeptides were present when translation was performed in the absence of microsomes (Fig. 2 B, compare lanes 1 and 2), the faster of the two polypeptides synthesized in the presence of microsomes was found to be protected by protease attack (comparelanes 3 and 4) unless detergent was added to the assay (lane 5). We conclude that B11-33 polypeptides can be efficiently translocated into bean microsomes, where they are processed most likely by the removal of the signal peptide. Translation mixtures used in this study contain 5 mm DTT derived from the wheat germ extract and up to 0.32 mm DTT derived from the bean microsomes preparation. Although optimal for translation, such conditions do not allow the formation of disulfide bonds in thein vitro synthesized proteins. However, the addition of oxidized glutathione (GSSG) has been shown to allow the oxidation of a variety of polypeptides synthesized in the reticulocyte lysate/canine pancreatic microsomes system without drastically affecting translation efficiency (35Yilla M.

To assess whether oxidation of B11-33 polypeptides could be similarly achieved in the wheat germ system, translation of B11-33 mRNA was performed in the presence of bean microsomes and increasing GSSG concentrations (Fig.3A). GSSG addition had a moderate inhibitory effect on protein synthesis. When 5 mmGSSG was included in the translation mixture, a clear mobility downshift was induced in the translocated polypeptides (Fig.3 A, lane 3). Similarly, translation in the presence of 6 mm GSSG caused a mobility downshift of the untranslocated protein (lane 4). The mobility downshifts were very similar, suggesting that the same set of disulfide bonds is formed in translocated and untranslocated polypeptides. Migration remained unchanged when the samples were reduced before SDS-PAGE, confirming that the shifts were indeed due to intrachain disulfide bond formation (Fig. 3 A, lanes 7–12). Although discrete bands corresponding to LMW glutenin oligomers were not detected, accumulation of some labeled protein in the top part of the gel was often observed when samples containing oxidized monomers were run under nonreducing conditions (not shown). Rather than representing bona fide glutenin polymers, this material probably represents misfolded/aggregated polypeptides linked by aberrant disulfide bonds (see “Discussion”). Thus, whereas intrachain disulfide bonds readily form in the in vitrosynthesized polypeptides, covalent polymer formation appears to be very inefficient. Since untranslocated and translocated proteins were oxidized at different GSSG concentrations, we investigated whether the higher threshold for oxidation of the untranslocated protein was due to the presence of the signal peptide. To test this hypothesis, mRNAs coding for the wild-type protein and for mutant B11-33 polypeptides lacking the putative signal peptide were translated together in the absence of microsomes and in the presence of increasing concentrations of GSSG (Fig. 3 B). Although the two bands were poorly resolved, it is clear that the response to increasing GSSG concentrations was not sensibly different in mutant and wild-type polypeptides, indicating that other factors such as the folding environment must be responsible for the reduced GSSG requirement for the oxidation of the segregated protein. Further information about the assembly state of B11-33 polypeptides synthesized under reducing or oxidizing conditions were then obtained by subjecting the translation products to sedimentation velocity centrifugation on sucrose gradients. mRNA coding for the B11-33 LMW glutenin subunit was translatedin vitro either in the absence or in the presence of 7 mm GSSG. Saturating amounts of microsomes were included into the translation reactions to guarantee translocation of most of the in vitro synthesized polypeptides. At the end of the translation N-ethylmaleimide was added to block free thiols by alkylation. Microsomes were isolated and solubilized, and proteins were then separated by sedimentation velocity centrifugation on sucrose gradients (Fig. 4). B11-33 polypeptides synthesized in the presence or absence of GSSG had a strikingly different sedimentation behavior. Most of the protein synthesized under conditions favoring disulfide bond formation sedimented as monomers, whereas the polypeptides synthesized in the absence of GSSG were extensively aggregated and were recovered at the bottom of the tube. Since incompletely folded polypeptide chains are often found to be poorly soluble and prone to aggregation (39Marquardt T. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 40Sawyer J.T. Lukaczyk T. Yilla M. J. Biol.

Plant J. 2000; 24: 825-836Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), these results strongly suggest that intrachain disulfide bond formation plays an important role in the stabilization of B11-33 polypeptides. In addition, this analysis shows that monomers containing intrachain disulfide bonds are not assembled into stable non-covalent polymers. The correct conformational state of B11-33 polypeptides synthesized under oxidizing condition was further confirmed by the observation that these polypeptides could be readily extracted in 50% 1-propanol (data not shown) and, thus, had the typical solubility properties of LMW glutenin subunits fractions prepared from grain (10Thompson S. Bishop D.H.L. Madgwick P. Tatham A.S. Shewry P.R. J. Agric. Food Chem. 1994; 42: 426-431Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In the B11-33 protein, the three intrachain disulfide bonds that have been proposed to characterize LMW glutenin subunits would link Cys-134 with Cys-169, Cys-142 with Cys-162, and Cys-170 with Cys-280 (Fig. 1). To investigate the role of the individual disulfide bonds in the structural maturation of B11-33 polypeptides, site-directed mutagenesis was used to generate a set of mutants in which pairs of cysteine residues are substituted with serines. Messenger RNA coding for the wild-type or the mutated polypeptides was translated in vitro in the presence of bean microsomes and different concentrations of GSSG. The in vitro synthesized polypeptides were then separated under non-reducing or reducing conditions (Fig.5A). Comparison with the pattern obtained when translation was performed in the presence of sub-optimal amounts of microsomes (0.5-µl/12.5-µl reaction) demonstrates that most of the protein synthesized under the conditions of the assay (2-µl/12.5-µl reaction) does indeed correspond to signal processed (translocated) polypeptides. The most dramatic effect was observed in the case of the 134–169 mutant (Fig. 5 A, lanes 1–4). Under conditions that led to the oxidation of the wild-type protein (5 and 7 mm GSSG), most of this mutant was not recovered in a monomeric form containing intrachain disulfide bonds but rather remained fully reduced or entered large disulfide-linked aggregates (as indicated by the difference in signal between reduced and nonreduced samples). These data suggest that in the absence of the 134–169 disulfide bond the formation of the other intrachain disulfides is somehow hampered, whereas covalent aggregation is favored. Elimination of Cys-142 and Cys-162 (Fig. 5 A, lanes 5–8) did not sensibly affect the formation of oxidized monomeric protein, which migrated slightly slower than oxidized wild-type polypeptides (the difference is evident when the mutated and wild-type proteins are run close by, see Fig.6A). Because the distance between Cys-142 and Cys-162 along the linear sequence is relatively short, it is conceivable that elimination of the bond connecting these two residues does not have a dramatic effect on electrophoretic mobility. The small change in electrophoretic mobility and the efficient recovery of the protein in monomeric form suggest that the two remaining disulfide bonds are normally formed also when the 142–162 bridge is absent. When Cys-170 and Cys-280 were substituted with serines and the mutant protein was synthesized in the presence of 5 mm GSSG, a doublet likely repres"

These genes are specifically expressed in antigen-presenting cells and can be induced in various other cell types by cytokines such as interferon γ (2Mach B. Steimle V. Martinez-Soria E. Reith W.

Molecular analysis of the factors associated with this syndrome (RFX5, RFXAP, RFXANK, and CIITA) provided invaluable information about the regulation of MHC class II genes. Whereas the trimeric RFX and NFY complexes are ubiquitously expressed, expression of CIITA is cell type-restricted and correlates with constitutive or interferon γ-mediated MHC class II gene expression (4Steimle V.

CIITA acts as a very potent transcriptional co-activator via its amino-terminal activation domain that can interact with components of the basal transcriptional machinery (11Mahanta S.K. Scholl T.

Biol. 2000; 20: 8489-8498Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). CIITA has two nuclear localization signals (NLSs), one of which is localized at its carboxyl terminus and resides within a region deleted in a case of BLS (16Cressman D.E. Chin K.C. Taxman D.J. Ting J.P.Y. Immunity. 1999; 10: 163-171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), hereafter named NLS1. A second bipartite NLS (NLS2) resides at the amino-terminal part of the protein. Lysines within NLS2 are acetylated by PCAF and CBP (15Spilianakis C. Papamatheakis J. Kretsovali A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8489-8498Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Nuclear levels of CIITA are regulated through many distinct mechanisms such as GTP binding to cognate sites (17Harton J.A. Cressman D.E. Chin K.-C. Der C.J. Ting J.P. Science. 1999; 285: 1402-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), acetylation within the amino-terminal NLS2 (15Spilianakis C. Papamatheakis J. Kretsovali A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8489-8498Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), and protein-protein interactions involving the carboxyl-terminal leucine-rich repeats (8Hake S. Masternak K. Kammerbauer C. Jansen C. Reith W. Steimle V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7716-7725Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Despite the two NLSs, CIITA is found both in the nucleus and cytoplasm (16Cressman D.E. Chin K.C. Taxman D.J. Ting J.P.Y. Immunity. 1999; 10: 163-171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 17Harton J.A. Cressman D.E. Chin K.-C. Der C.J. Ting J.P.

Biol. 2000; 20: 8489-8498Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). We show here that an amino-terminal region and a central region of CIITA that also contain the activation domain and the two GTP binding sites, respectively, determine nuclear export. We also demonstrate that although the presence of an intact NLS is critical for nuclear import of CIITA, access of the protein to the import machinery is further modified by its ability to associate with itself. Point mutations that destroy self-association have a profound effect in the nuclear import and transactivation properties of the protein. HeLa, COS-1, and COS-7 cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and transfected as described previously (13Kretsovali A. Agalioti T. Spilianakis C. Tzortzakaki E. Merika M. Papamatheakis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6777-6783Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Luciferase assays were performed 24 h after transfection. The mouse class II promoter Ea (extending to the −2.1 kilobase) was fused to the Luciferase gene producing the Ea-Luc construct. FLAG-tagged full-length CIITA or its derivatives were expressed from pCDNA3 expression vector. Green or red fluorescent protein fusions were constructed in pEGFPC-1 or the dsred (CLONTECH), respectively. CIITA mutants were constructed with the Gene Editor in vitro site-directed mutagenesis system from Promega. The mutagenic primers were as follows: ML1, CAGCGATGCTGACCCCGCGTGCGCCTACCACTTCTATGA; ML2, CCCTGCTCCGCCCGGGGGGCGGCGGCCGGCCTTTTCC; ML3, CTGCTCCGAGGTTGCACCGCCGCCGCCACAGCCCGGCCCCGGGGC; and F961S, AAGAAACTGGAGTCTGCGCTGGGCCCT. All constructions were verified by sequencing. Protein expression was assayed by Western blotting and immunofluorescence. Fragments of CIITA were subcloned into pGEX vectors (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in frame with glutathione S-transferase. Approximately 1 µg of fusion proteins were immobilized to glutathione-Sepharose beads and incubated with in vitro translated and35S-labeled (TNT, Promega) full-length CIITA or derivatives in a buffer containing 150 mm KCl, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2% bovine serum albumin and supplemented with protease inhibitors. the reactions were carried out at 4 °C for 5 h and washed three times in the same buffer without bovine serum albumin. Bound proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and detected by autoradiography. For in vivoprotein-protein interactions, COS-1 cells in 100-mm diameter were transfected with 5–10 µg of each plasmid using the calcium phosphate method. Whole cell extracts were prepared in lysis buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 170 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors. Extracts were incubated for 16 h at 4 °C with anti-FLAG M2 agarose (Sigma). The immunoprecipitated samples were washed four times with lysis buffer containing 250 mm NaCl, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Western blotting analysis was performed using monoclonal anti-FLAG (Sigma) or anti-GFP (CLONTECH) antibodies. For cell fractionation experiments, HeLa cells were transfected with GFP-CIITA derivatives and RFX5 and lysed in hypotonic buffer A (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) with three strokes using a Dounce homogenizer, pestle type B. The post-centrifugation supernatant was kept as cytoplasmic fraction. Pelleted nuclei were further washed with hypotonic buffer with two more strokes using a Dounce homogenizer with a loose pestle and following centrifugation nuclei were extracted with buffer C (20 mmHepes, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 0.42 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol). Fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with α-CIITA (a polyclonal antiserum raised against the amino-terminal 330 amino acids of CIITA) and α-RFX5 (Rockland) antibodies. For the His-CRM1 pull-down experiment, His-tagged CRM-1 was immobilized on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads (Qiagen). The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 60 mm imidazole, 0.5% Triton X-100, 5% glycerol, and protease inhibitors mix). One more wash was done with EBC buffer without EDTA (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 170 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors mix). Following 1 h of blocking with 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and two washes with EBC buffer, COS cell extracts (precleared with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads) containing GFP CIITA derivatives were added. Following a 4-h interaction at 4 °C and three washes with NETN buffer, the CRM1-retained proteins were resolved in SDS-PAGE (10% for the left part and 8% for the right part) and detected by immunoblotting using anti-GFP antibody. Localization of transfected proteins was analyzed with an Olympus IMT2 fluorescence microscope on living or fixed (phosphate-buffered saline/acetone 2:3) cells with or without further staining by an anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody and the appropriate tetrarhodamine isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse antibody. Quantitation of nuclear and cytoplasmic content of the expressed CIITA proteins was done with fluorescence image analysis by the Scion Image Beta 4 program (www.scioncorp.com). Quantitative protein expression was determined by Western blotting analysis with an anti-GFP monoclonal antibody (CLONTECH). We have shown recently that CIITA is the first co-activator that is actively exported from the nucleus (15Spilianakis C. Papamatheakis J. Kretsovali A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8489-8498Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In agreement with this and other observations (16Cressman D.E. Chin K.C. Taxman D.J. Ting J.P.Y. Immunity. 1999; 10: 163-171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) we found CIITA to be evenly distributed between the nucleus and cytoplasm with nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio (N/C) of 0.93. To delineate regions that mediate export, we generated amino- and carboxyl-terminal deletions of CIITA fused to the GFP (Fig.1B). A deletion of the first 102 amino acids (Fig. 1 A, 102–1130) rendered CIITA nuclear (N/C = 10), indicating that this region regulates nuclear export. Thus, sequences within the transcription activation domain of the protein determine nuclear export. All carboxyl-terminal deletions of CIITA that retain the amino-terminal NLS2 (15Spilianakis C. Papamatheakis J. Kretsovali A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8489-8498Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and extend up to amino acid 524 are mainly nuclear. As shown in Fig. 1 ACIITA 1–524 shows high nuclear levels (N/C = 8). In contrast, a CIITA molecule that extends to amino acid 550 showed equal distribution in both compartments (N/C = 1.1) and was retained in the nucleus when LMB was added. These distribution patterns are consistent with the presence of additional sequences between amino acids 525 and 550 that are involved in nuclear export. We designate regions 1–102 and 525–550 as nuclear export regions (NERs) 1 and 2, respectively. A CIITA deletion that extends to amino acid 979 (Fig. 1 A,1–979) and contains both NLSs (15Spilianakis C. Papamatheakis J. Kretsovali A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8489-8498Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 16Cressman D.E. Chin K.C. Taxman D.J. Ting J.P.Y. Immunity. 1999; 10: 163-171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) showed cytoplasmic distribution (N/C = 0.35) and was partially responsive to LMB. Thus, in agreement with a recent report (8Hake S. Masternak K. Kammerbauer C. Jansen C. Reith W. Steimle V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7716-7725Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), our results show that additional information residing in the carboxyl-terminal part of the protein that includes the earlier described leucine-rich region is required for nucleocytoplasmic transport. Fractionation experiments of HeLa cells co-transfected with the same set of constructs shown in Fig.1 B along with a construct coding for RFX5 showed that the distribution of proteins in the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions (Fig.1 C) is in agreement with results of the visual analysis. RFX5 that is exclusively nuclear 2A. Dimakopoulos and J. Papamatheakis, unpublished data. serves as a purification control. To investigate the role of CIITA regions in controlling nuclear export, we performed experiments to evaluate the binding of various CIITA parts to the export receptor CRM1 (18Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1741) Google Scholar, 19Ossareh-Nazari B. Bachelerie F. Dargemont C. Science. 1997; 278: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). Whole cell extracts prepared from COS-1 cells expressing various CIITA derivatives fused to GFP were passed through a CRM1 affinity column. Specific protein retention on the CRM1 column was assayed by immunoblotting. Fig.2shows that full-length CIITA was specifically retained on the column (Fig. 2, lane 14), whereas RFX5 a nuclear protein was not (lane 16).2 CIITA fragments 1–114 and 408–550 that contain the NER1 and NER2 elements described previously did bind to the CRM1 (lanes 4 and 8, respectively), whereas fragments spanning the regions 102–408 and 550–850 did not (lanes 6and 10). A deletion that removes the first 102 amino acids of the protein (amino acids 102–1130) that is exclusively nuclear did not bind to CRM1 (lane 12), indicating that although it contains sequences that promote nuclear export, these sequences were not accessible to the export machinery in this context. Both NERs contain closely spaced leucines, although they do not match perfectly to the consensus for nuclear export signals (20Mattaj I.W. Englmeier L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 265-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar). To investigate the possibility that these leucines may be required for CIITA export, we generated the mutants shown in Fig.3. The intracellular distributions and activities of GFP-tagged proteins were next studied. The distribution of ml1 was similar to the mixed pattern of wild type protein, whereas mutant proteins ml2 and ml3 were mainly cytoplasmic in the great majority of cells (Fig. 3 A). Therefore leucines mutated in ml2 and ml3 are involved in the nuclear localization of CIITA. We also generated a naturally occurring point mutation that substitutes amino acid 961 (F961S) recently reported in a case of late onset BLS, which inactivates CIITA (21Quan V. Towey M. Sacks S. Kelly A.P. Immunogenetics. 1999; 49: 957-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This point mutation also rendered the protein cytoplasmic (Fig. 3 A). Treatment with LMB did not influence the distribution of ml2, ml3 (not shown), or F961S (Fig.3 A), thus suggesting that these mutants are defective in nuclear import. Transient transfection assays (Fig. 3 B), using an MHC class II promoter-Luc fusion plasmid further showed that ml1 had activity slightly higher than the wild type. Mutant ml2 retained about 30% of activity, in agreement with an earlier report (22Brown J.A. Rogers E.M. Boss J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4128-4136Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and ml3 or BLS are practically inactive (Fig. 3 B). Overall, these results suggest that mutations that do not directly destroy individual import signals abolish the nuclear import and activity of CIITA. Impaired nuclear import of CIITA mutations that do not directly affect the NLS raise the possibility that import may require a proper protein configuration that is disrupted in the above mutants. Such a configuration could be acquired by protein-protein interactions. The sequence homology of CIITA with the caspase activator Nod1 that is able to oligomerize (23Inohara N.T. Koseki T. Lin J. del Peso L. Lucas P.C. Chen F.F. Ogura Y. Nunez G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27823-27831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar) led us to investigate whether CIITA also self-associates. Fig. 4A shows that in vitro translated full-length CIITA interacted strongly with the region extending from amino acids 408 to 550 (lane 6) and with the carboxyl-terminal region (amino acids 650–1130 and 408–1130;lanes 8 and 12, respectively). The same probe could associate to a lesser extend with the amino-terminal deletion of amino acids 102–1130 (lane 11). A probe of amino acids 408–550 (Fig. 4 B) could interact with itself (lane 6), with the amino-terminal amino acids 1–114 (lane 2) and 114–408 (lane 3) and less efficiently with the carboxyl-terminal amino acids 650–1130 (lane 8). In agreement with this, a fragment spanning the first 408 amino acids was efficiently retained by GST-CIITA/408–550 (Fig. 4 C,lane 6) but had no ability of homotypic interaction (Fig.4 C, lanes 3–5). The carboxyl-terminal amino acids 408–1130 could bind to the amino-terminal amino acids 1–408 (Fig. 4 D, lane 5) and less efficiently to itself (Fig. 4 D, lane 6). Remarkably, an intact CIITA molecule was incapable of binding to itself (Fig. 4 A,lane 10) or to the amino-terminal 408 amino acids (Fig. 4,A, lanes 3–5 and C, lane 10), whereas it could bind to the carboxyl-terminal amino acids 408–1130 (Fig. 4, A, lane 12 and D,lane 9). Therefore the amino-terminal region might interfere with the self-interaction of CIITA in vitro. To confirm that such self-interactions also occur in vivo we used co-immunoprecipitation of CIITA proteins tagged either with FLAG epitope or with GFP. Fig. 5Ashows that FLAG CIITA efficiently co-immunoprecipitated GFP-CIITA (lane 2) but not GFP (lane 1). No GFP-CIITA alone could bind to the anti-FLAG column (lane 3). Therefore intact CIITA molecules are able to self-oligomerize in vivobut not in vitro, indicating the involvement of additional factors or protein modifications. Similar co-immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed that the interaction of the amino-terminal amino acids 1–408 to the 408–550 region of CIITA also occurs in vivo (Fig. 5 B, lane 1) and requires the intact central region because fragments thereof did not interact (Fig.5 B, lanes 2 and 3). These experiments show that CIITA undergoes multiple homotypic and heterotypic interactions that may lead to intramolecular and/or bimolecular self-associations. We next tested the ability of mutant proteins ml2, ml3, and F961S to self-associate in vitro and in vivo. Fig.6A shows that mutants ml2 and ml3 had reduced binding to a GST-CIITA amino acids 408–550, and mutant F961S shows practically no interaction. In vivoco-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that all three mutants had reduced ability for self-association (Fig. 6 B, lanes 2–4) as compared with the wild type protein (Fig. 6 B,lane 1). Overall these data favor the possibility that these point mutations lead to altered protein topology and defective function by affecting the ability for self-association. To examine whether the self-association properties of CIITA may influence its subcellular localization, we co-transfected various GFP- and FLAG-CIITA expressing plasmids into COS-7 cells and compared their subcellular distribution. Fig. 7shows that a FLAG CIITA/1–408 is mainly nuclear (N/C>10) (panel a) and deletion 408–1130 that lacks NLS2 is cytoplasmic (N/C = 0.33) (panel b). However, upon co-transfection, the 408–1130 molecule showed increased nuclear levels (compare panels band d) in cells that also express CIITA/1–408 (comparepanels c and d). In such experiments the average N/C of 408–1130 estimated from cells co-expressing the two molecules increased from 0.33 to 0.83, thus approaching the wild type CIITA levels. The same approach was employed to study the interaction between two different intact CIITA molecules within cells. For this reason the effect of a red fluorescent CIITA (dsred-CIITA) (Fig. 7 e) on the localization of a GFP-CIITA that alone was rendered nuclear (Fig.7 f) because of the action of an exogenously supplemented SV40 NLS (GFP-NLSCIITA) was studied. dsred-CIITA led to increased cytoplasmic content of the co-expressed GFP-NLS-CIITA (comparepanels h–f), indicating that in this context, a single S40 NLS present in dimers formed with native CIITA is not sufficient to overcome the action of the export signals. Overall the bimolecular interaction of either intact CIITA molecules or fragments thereof influences their subcellular localization in a way that resembles that of the intact CIITA. Finally, to test the functional consequences of the self-association of CIITA, we produced full-length complementing fragments of CIITA and co-transfected them into HeLa cells. Individually expressed amino- or carboxyl-terminal truncations of CIITA had no effect on a target MHC class II reporter (Fig. 8, lines 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, and10). Interestingly, co-expression of amino and carboxyl termini of CIITA separated at amino acid 408 (1–408 and 408–1130) showed significant trans-complementation activity (Fig. 8, line 8). Splitting the molecule at amino acid 330 or 550 did not rescue CIITA activity (Fig. 8, lines 5 and 11). Thus, a functional CIITA can be reconstituted by the assembly of two separate protein fragments derived by cleavage at position 408. On the contrary, the carboxyl-terminal parts (408–1130 amino acids) mutants BLS/F961S (line 14) or ml2 and ml3 (not shown), which are defective for self-association, were unable to rescue transcriptional activity by similar assays. In this work we investigate mechanisms that control the nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of CIITA. We determine two separate regions, NER1 and NER2, that mediate the CRM1-dependent nuclear export of CIITA. Furthermore, we provide evidence that nuclear levels of CIITA correlate with its ability for self-association. We show that CIITA can self-associate via homo- and heterotypic interactions. Based on the analysis of mutations that impair nuclear import, we suggest that structural constrains imposed by self-association affect recognition of CIITA by the import machinery. Regulated nuclear transport is a mechanism that rapidly converts a cell effector from an inactive into an active form and vice versa during various cell signaling, cell cycle progression, and differentiation pathways. Competence for transport through the nuclear membrane is achieved by diverse mechanisms. In some cases factor dimerization upon signal-dependent phosphorylation (STATs and IRF3) precedes nuclear import, although it is not determined whether it is a prerequisite for it. Interaction with other proteins is also a well established mechanism for the regulated nucleocytoplasmic transport. Binding to IκB inhibits nuclear import of p65 through masking of the NLS (24Beg A.A. Ruben S.M. Scheinman R.I. Haskill S. Rosen C.A. Baldwin A.S.J. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1899-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar, 25Zabel U. Henkel T. Silva M.S. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Conversely, binding to calcineurin inhibits the nuclear export of NFAT by masking the nuclear export signals (26Zhu J. McKeon F. Nature. 1999; 398: 256-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In addition, self-interaction may affect nucleocytoplasmic transport, as exemplified by tetramerization of p53s, which inhibits its nuclear export (27Stommel J.M. Marchenco M.D. Jimenez G.S. Moll U.M. Hope T.J. Wahl G.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1660-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). Although intracellular shuttling mostly characterizes transcription factors that are activated by post-translational mechanisms, CIITA, which is regulated at the transcriptional level, also shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm (15Spilianakis C. Papamatheakis J. Kretsovali A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8489-8498Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 16Cressman D.E. Chin K.C. Taxman D.J. Ting J.P.Y. Immunity. 1999; 10: 163-171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This behavior of CIITA is not typical for a co-activator, because there is only one other example of a co-activator that has been shown to move between nucleus and cytoplasm in response to different stimuli, namely the activating signal co-integrator 1 (28Kim H.-J. Yi J.-Y. Sung H.-S. Moore D. Jhun B. Lee Y.C. Lee J.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6323-6332Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The low expression level of the endogenous protein has not permitted thus far the elucidation of the role of CIITA nucleocytoplasmic shuttling in various physiological or developmental states. It is possible that the amount and/or timing of CIITA retained in the nucleus must be precisely adjusted. Low CIITA nuclear levels may be advantageous to avoid secondary effects such as inhibition of the activity of other factors as was shown for NFAT (29Sisk T.J. Gourley T. Roys S. Chang C.H. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2511-2517Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and Fas ligand (30Gourley T.S. Chang C.H. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 2917-2921Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the possibility of unknown functions of CIITA in the cytoplasm cannot be formerly excluded. In this line, CIITAs sequence similarity with the caspase activator Nod-1 (31Inohara N.T. Koseki T. del Peso L. Hu Y. Yee C. Chen S. Carrio r. Merino J. Liu D. Ni J. Nunez G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14560-14567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar) is very intriguing and needs further study to elucidate its role in apoptotic pathways. Nod-1 is known to oligomerize via the nucleotide binding sequence (23Inohara N.T. Koseki T. Lin J. del Peso L. Lucas P.C. Chen F.F. Ogura Y. Nunez G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27823-27831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). We demonstrate by biochemical, topological, and functional assays that CIITA is also able to oligomerize via sequences homologous to Nod-1. CIITA has the ability for multiple (homotypic and heterotypic) interactions, all of which involve the central part of the molecule that harbors the GTP motifs and the export region NER2. Intramolecular or bimolecular interactions can lead to a highly structured monomer or dimer in a nonmutually excusive manner. Neither type of configuration is ruled out by the present analysis. The heterotypic, intramolecular interaction of amino-terminal sequences that include the NER1 with the central NER2 region limits the NER2-NER2 homotypic interaction and lowers the nuclear levels of CIITA. In accordance with this, elimination of NER1 shifts the equilibrium toward homotypic NER2-mediated interactions that result in an exclusively nuclear distribution observed with the 102–1130/GFP form of CIITA. Conversely, point mutations within NER2, which compromise the homotypic NER2-mediated dimerization, lead to the inability for nuclear import. This process is reminiscent of the IRF-3 protein, which is constitutively cytoplasmic because of an intramolecular association, which masks the NLS, whereas upon virus-mediated signaling and concomitant phosphorylation, it dimerizes and enters the nucleus (32Lin J. Mamane Y. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2465-2474Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The balance of opposing import and export signals in determining the subcellular distribution of CIITA is demonstrated by the relocalization effects caused by the paired expression of amino- with carboxyl-terminally derived parts of CIITA or intact CIITA molecules, one of which is supplied with the SV40 NLS. In both cases co-expression of either pair of molecules moderates extreme nuclear or cytoplasmic protein distributions and almost restores the distribution pattern and the activity of native CIITA. The interaction of CIITA with CRM1 depends on the presence of both NER1 and NER2. Because no significant binding to CRM-1 was detected using bacterial CIITA and in vitro translated CRM-1 in the presence or absence of Ran-GTP (not shown), the possibility that an intermediary factor is required for this interaction remains open for further investigation. CIITA derivatives lacking the amino terminus that harbors NER1 show a strong dominant negative effect (33Zhou H. Su H.S. Zhang X. Douhan J.R. Glimcher L.H. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 4741-4749PubMed Google Scholar, 34Bontron S. Ucla C. Mach B. Steimle V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4249-4258Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 35Yun S. Gustafsson K. Fabre J. Int. Immunol. 1997; 9: 1545-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Thus, the negative effect of these proteins stems from their high nuclear localization (this study) in combination with their increased ability for promoter recruitment (9Masternak K. Muhlethaler-Mottet A. Villard J. Zufferey M. Steimle V. Reith W. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1156-1166PubMed Google Scholar). The localization of NER1 within the transcriptional activation domain suggests that CBP and PCAF may compete with CRM1 for binding to CIITA in a way similar to calcineurin for NFAT (26Zhu J. McKeon F. Nature. 1999; 398: 256-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we have shown that PCAF increases nuclear levels of CIITA by two mechanisms: acetylation and direct binding (15Spilianakis C. Papamatheakis J. Kretsovali A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8489-8498Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). It is possible that the second mechanism involves masking of the CRM1 interaction surface of CIITA. Thus, CIITA molecules that are not engaged in transcription may undergo fast nucleocytoplasmic turnover. Nuclear retention via interaction with co-activators has also been reported for IRF-3 (36Kumar K.P. McBride K.M. Weaver B.K. Dingwall C. Reich N.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4159-4168Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), HNF-4 (37Soutoglou E. Katrakili N. Talianidis I. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 745-751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), and ASC-1 (28Kim H.-J. Yi J.-Y. Sung H.-S. Moore D. Jhun B. Lee Y.C. Lee J.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6323-6332Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). It is intriguing that diverse mutations of CIITA such as the leucine substitutions and the BLS mutation reported here or mutations introduced in the GTP-binding site (17Harton J.A. Cressman D.E. Chin K.-C. Der C.J. Ting J.P. Science. 1999; 285: 1402-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) or the leucine-rich region (8Hake S. Masternak K. Kammerbauer C. Jansen C. Reith W. Steimle V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7716-7725Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) result in defective nuclear import. A model consistent with these results could involve alterations of protein conformation that affect recognition of CIITA by the import machinery. Similar mechanisms might modulate the nucleocytoplasmic properties of other proteins as well. These results are in agreement with data reported on CIITA self-association by Linhoff and colleagues (38Linhof M.W. Harton J. Cressman D. Martin B. Ting J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3001-3011Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and Sisk and colleagues (39Sisk T.J. Roys S. Chang C.-H. Mol. Cell.

Engagement of the TCR triggers multiple intracellular biochemical events that operate in a sequence and transduce the extracellular signal into different subcellular compartments. This results in the induction of transcription of selected genes and translation of their corresponding mRNA, reorganization of cytoskeletal elements, modulation of expression of cell surface receptors, and secretion of lymphokines and other soluble immune mediators. These responses may lead to T cell proliferation, apoptosis, anergy, or differentiation into distinct types of effector cells. Determination of the specific differentiation pathway of engaged T cells is dependent upon the structure of the presented peptide antigen, and the nature of simultaneously engaged cell surface receptors. Individual components of the TCR-linked signaling pathways are physically separated in resting cells, and they reassemble into functional complexes upon receptor engagement (1Qian D. Weiss A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 2Isakov N. Adv. Immunol. 1998; 69: 183-247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This mechanism enables the recruitment of enzymes and other effector molecules to specific subcellular compartments, predominantly the lipid rafts (3Janes P.W. Ley S.C. Magee A.I. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 447-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar) at the site of the immunological synapse (4Monks C.R. Freiberg B.A. Kupfer H. Sciaky N. Kupfer A.

Because this process occurs in a temporally and spatially regulated manner, it ensures an efficient signaling, which, under appropriate conditions that follow a productive T cell interaction, lead to cell activation and differentiation. Adapter molecules such as Grb2, Shc, and Crk possess multiple protein-protein interaction domains, which allows them to play a critical role in the assembly of multimolecular activation complexes (7Rudd C.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 8Peterson E.J. Clements J.L. Fang N. Koretzky G.A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 337-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Many of these adapter proteins are involved in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation by coupling proximal biochemical events, initiated by cell surface receptor engagement, with distal signal transducing pathways. The Crk adaptor protein was originally identified as a product of the v-crk oncogene in the avian retrovirus CT10 (9Mayer B.J. Hamaguchi M. Hanafusa H. Nature. 1988; 332: 272-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar) and shortly thereafter in the ASV-1 avian retroviral isolate (10Tsuchie H. Chang C.H. Yoshida M. Vogt P.K. Oncogene. 1989; 4: 1281-1284PubMed Google Scholar). It was later found to be encoded by a cellular proto-oncogene (11Reichman C.T. Mayer B.J. Keshav S. Hanafusa H. Cell Growth & Differ. 1992; 3: 451-460PubMed Google Scholar), and it has since been established that Crk proteins are implicated in signaling pathways regulating cell growth (12Gesbert F. Garbay C.

Although adapter proteins such as Grb2 and Shc were found to play a positive role in the regulation of T cell activation, other adapter proteins, including Crk and Cbl, were predominantly implicated in the negative regulation of TCR-linked signaling pathways. It is possible therefore that Crk and Cbl regulate the termination of TCR-linked activation signals or are involved in biochemical processes promoting T cell suppression and induction of immune anergy (21Clements J.L.

It is assumed that Grb2 association with Cbl precludes Grb2 binding to Sos, thereby preventing the recruitment of Sos to the plasma membrane and the subsequent activation of Ras (34Liu Y.C. Altman A.

It has been suggested that the preferential formation of CrkL-Cbl-C3G complexes and the subsequent activation of Rap-1, sequester Raf-1 (the kinase immediately distal to Ras (43Moodie S.A. Willumsen B.M. Weber M.J. Wolfman A. Science. 1993; 260: 1658-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar)). This short-circuits Ras-dependent signaling and thereby promotes immune cell anergy (26Boussiotis V.A. Freeman G.J. Berezovskaya A. Barber D.L. Nadler L.M. Science. 1997; 278: 124-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). This hypothesis was further supported by showing that TCR ligation in tolerant T cell clones fail to couple with Ras activation and Ras-dependent distal signaling pathways (44Li W. Whaley C.D.

Science. 1996; 271: 1276-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). The Cbl-associated PI3K may also be involved in the negative regulation of T cell responsiveness, because overexpression of a mutated, constitutively active form of PI3K resulted in a reduced TCR-dependent activation of the NF-AT transcription factor (46Reif K. Lucas S. Cantrell D. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 285-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In addition, overexpression of a dominant negative form of PI3K increased NF-AT activity in TCR-stimulated T cells. We have previously shown that Crk associates with tyrosine-phosphorylated and enzymatically active ZAP-70 PTK in TCR-stimulated T cells (47Gelkop S. Isakov N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21519-21527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We now demonstrate that a direct physical interaction exists between Crk and the PI3K regulatory subunit, p85, in activated T cells and further characterizes the mechanism of this interaction.

Matsuda (National Institute of Health, Tokyo, Japan). Plasmids containing GST fused to the full-length p85 or individual regions of p85, as indicated above, were gifts of Dr. J. Bertoglio (INSERM Unit 461, Paris, France). pGEX plasmids were used to transform Escherichia coli DH5α cells (Life Technologies, Inc.). After induction of protein expression with 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Promega, Madison, WI) for 2–4 h, the bacteria were resuspended in a lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% Triton X-100 and were further disrupted by sonication. Following centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min, the induced proteins were adsorbed to bead-immobilized glutathione. Soluble GST fusion proteins were obtained by elution with 2 mmreduced glutathione (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. For in vitro binding assays, bead-adsorbed GST or GST fusion proteins (5 μg/sample) were incubated with cell lysates at 4 °C on a rotator for 3 h. The beads were then washed three times in a lysis buffer, and bound proteins were either eluted and subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions followed by immunoblotting or tested in an in vitro kinase assay. Human leukemic Jurkat T cells were maintained at a logarithmic growth phase in complete RPMI (RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin (all from Biological Industries, Beit Haemek, Israel), and 5 × 10−6 mβ-mercaptoethanol (Sigma)) in 75 cm2 growth area tissue culture flasks (Cell-Cult, Sterilin Limited, Feltham, UK) in an atmosphere of 7.5% CO2 at 37 °C. Peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) were obtained by histopaque gradient centrifugation of heparinized blood from healthy volunteers. Enriched population of preactivated and rested PBL T cells were obtained by cell culture (1 × 106/ml) in complete RPMI containing 10% fetal calf serum in the presence of 5 μg/ml phytohemagglutinin in 75 cm2 growth-area tissue culture flasks (50 ml/flask). Human recombinant interleukin-2 (20 units/ml) was added after 72 h of culture, and cells were maintained in culture for 6 more days by the addition of interleukin-2 (20 units/ml) once every 2 days. Jurkat or PBL T cells (10 × 106/100 μl) were stimulated with freshly prepared 1% pervanadate (10 mmNa3VO4 containing 1% H2O2) for 30 min at 37 °C. Ab-mediated cross-linking of the TCR/CD3 was performed by incubating Jurkat or PBL T cells (10 × 106/100 μl) with C305 mAb (100 μg/ml) or OKT3 mAb (100 μg/ml), respectively, for 30 min on ice. A secondary cross-linking rabbit anti-mouse Ig Ab was then added for 10 min on ice followed by cell transfer to 37 °C and incubation for the indicated time interval. Cell lysates were prepared by resuspension of cells in a lysis buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 10 μg/ml each leupeptin and aprotinin, 2 mm AEBSF, and 1% Triton X-100 followed by a 20-min incubation on ice. Lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the nuclear free supernatants were used for immunoprecipitation studies or mixed with equal volumes of 2× SDS sample buffer, vortexed, incubated at 100 °C for 5 min, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Cytosolic and particulate fractions were prepared by resuspending the cells in buffer A (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 μg/ml each leupeptin and aprotinin, and 2 mm AEBSF) and repeatedly aspirating them through a 1-ml syringe with a 26-gauge needle for 20 s. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 400 × g for 5 min, nuclear pellets were removed, and lysates were recentrifuged at 13,000 ×g. Supernatants (cytosolic fractions) were transferred to a second set of microcentrifuge tubes, Triton X-100 was added up to a 1% final concentration, and samples were either mixed with 5× SDS sample buffer (4:1, v/v) or used for immunoprecipitation. Pellets were washed once in buffer A, resuspended in buffer A plus 1% Triton X-100 (in the original volume used for the lysis), incubated for 30 min on ice, and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 20 min. Supernatants (particulate fractions) were either mixed with 5× SDS sample buffer (4:1, v/v) or used for immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitation was performed by using an optimal dilution of polyclonal antisera or mAbs that were preabsorbed on protein A-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4 °C. Excess Abs were removed by three washes in cold phosphate-buffered saline, and Ab-coated beads were incubated with cell lysates for 2–3 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were precipitated by centrifugation followed by extensive washing in a lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitated proteins were then fractionated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with specific Abs. Samples of cell lysates, GST fusion proteins, GST fusion protein-bound molecules, or Ab immunoprecipitates were resolved by electrophoresis on 10% acrylamide gels using Bio-Rad Mini-PROTEAN II cell. Proteins in the gels were either stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Sigma) or blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) at 100 V for 45 min in a Bio-Rad Mini Trans-Blot transfer cell. After 1 h of blocking at 37 °C with 3% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline, nitrocellulose membranes were incubated with the indicated primary Abs followed by incubation with HRP-conjugated sheep anti-mouse or donkey anti-rabbit Ig or with HRP-conjugated protein A. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized using an ECL reagent and autoradiography. To determine direct binding of either Crk-II or selected Crk-II domains to the electrophoresed nitrocellulose-bound proteins, SDS-PAGE was performed as described above followed by blotting onto an Immobilon-N (Millipore) membrane. Protein denaturation was performed by incubation of the membrane for 1 h at 25 °C in denaturation buffer (7 mguanidine-HCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mmdithiothreitol, 2 mm EDTA, 0.25% (w/v) nonfat dry milk). Protein renaturation was performed by several washes of the membrane in cold renaturation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mmEDTA, 0.1% (w/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.25% (w/v) nonfat dry milk) and overnight incubation in renaturation buffer at 4 °C. After blocking the membrane with phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Tween 20, it was incubated overnight at 4 °C with a blocking buffer containing 10 μg/ml the indicated GST fusion protein or GST, used as a negative control. Bound GST proteins were detected by incubation of the membrane with a mouse anti-GST mAb for 1 h followed by an HRP-conjugated sheep anti-mouse Ig and then by ECL development. To identify Crk-binding proteins in activated T cells, we used GST-CrkII fusion proteins in a pull-down assay and searched for tyrosine-phosphorylated CrkII-binding proteins in a lysate of activated Jurkat T cells. We found that GST-CrkII pulled down a 70-kDa protein identified as ZAP-70 (47Gelkop S. Isakov N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21519-21527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and, occasionally, a faint protein band with a molecular mass of 85 kDa. Immunoblotting confirmed that this protein band corresponds to the PI3K regulatory subunit, p85 (not shown). To further analyze the putative association of p85 with CrkII, we stimulated Jurkat T cells either with pervanadate or by cross-linking of the TCR with the C305 mAb and tested whether p85 co-immunoprecipitates with Crk. We found (Fig.1A) that anti-Crk mAbs co-immunoprecipitated p85 from lysates of activated but not resting Jurkat T cells. The association of p85 with CrkII in activated T cells was further substantiated by the occurrence of reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1B), even though a low level of constitutive association could be observed in lysate of resting cells. To further analyze whether cell activation-induced p85 association with CrkII represents a general physiological phenomenon, we repeated the experiment using human PBL as a source of T cells. The results (Fig. 1C) confirmed that p85 co-immunoprecipitates with CrkII from lysates of both pervanadate and anti-CD3 (OKT3)-treated PBL, again demonstrating that a small fraction of these proteins are associated in a constitutive manner. The time course of the effect of TCR cross-linking with C305 clonotypic mAbs on p85 association with CrkII demonstrated maximal binding within 2 min of activation, which persisted for 10 min and then gradually declined (Fig. 2). Striping and reblotting of the nitrocellulose membrane with anti-phosphotyrosine mAbs demonstrated that CrkII and, to a much lower extent, p85 underwent tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 2C). However, phosphorylation of both proteins, which peaked at 10 min post-stimulation, was hardly detectable after 2 min, demonstrating a disproportional relationship between the degree of phosphorylation of CrkII and/or p85 and the formation of p85-CrkII complexes. Thus, this association may either be independent of the tyrosine phosphorylation state of these proteins, or the low phosphorylation levels (which are below the sensitivity of the immunoblot assay) may be sufficient for mediating the observed p85-CrkII interaction. Additional studies demonstrated that immunoprecipitates of CrkII from a lysate of pervanadate-stimulated Jurkat T cells, similar to p85 immunoprecipitates, exhibited in vitro PI3K activity (not shown) suggesting presence of the PI3K p110 catalytic subunit in the complex. Immunoblot analysis of cytosolic and particulate fractions of Jurkat T cells revealed that more than 90% of the Crk molecules reside in the cytosol of the cell (see Fig.3B). Accordingly, we found that the predominant association between Crk and p85 occurs at the cytosolic fraction (Fig. 3A). Analysis of Crk immunoprecipitates from the particulate fraction (right panel, Fig. 3B) revealed two major protein bands of ∼40 and ∼42 kDa in the lysate of resting cells and a third band with a slower mobility in the lysate of pervanadate-treated cells. Similar results have been reported in HEK-293 cells stimu"
https://openalex.org/W2007938816,"Abstract Although little is known about the precise mechanisms by which the molecular chaperone Hsp90 recognizes its client proteins, Cdc37 has been shown to play a critical role in the targeting of Hsp90 to client protein kinases. Described here is the identification and characterization of a novel 35-kDa human protein that is 31% identical to Cdc37. We have named this novel protein Harc (Hsp90-associating relative ofCdc37). Northern blot analysis revealed the presence of Harc mRNA in several human tissues, including liver, skeletal muscle, and kidney. Biochemical fractionation and immunofluorescent localization of epitope-tagged Harc (i.e. FLAG-Harc) indicated that it is present in the cytoplasm of cells. FLAG-Harc binds Hsp90 but unlike Cdc37 does not bind Src family kinases or Raf-1. Mapping experiments indicate that the central 120 amino acids of both Harc and Cdc37 constitute a Hsp90-binding domain not described previously. FLAG-Harc is basally serine-phosphorylated and hyperphosphorylated when co-expressed with an activated mutant of the Src family kinase Hck. Notably, FLAG-Harc forms complexes with Hsp90, Hsp70, p60Hop, immunophilins, and an unidentified p22 protein but not with the Hsp90 co-chaperone p23. Thus Harc likely represents a novel participant in Hsp90-mediated protein folding, potentially targeting Hsp90 to Hsp70-client protein heterocomplexes."
https://openalex.org/W2057314025,"Swelling of hepatocytes and other epithelia activates volume-sensitive ion channels that facilitate fluid and electrolyte efflux to restore cell volume, but the responsible signaling pathways are incompletely defined. Previous work in model HTC rat hepatoma cells has indicated that swelling elicits ATP release, which stimulates P2 receptors and activates Cl(-) channels, and that this mechanism is essential for hepatocellular volume recovery. Since P2 receptors are generally coupled to Ca(2+) signaling pathways, we determined whether hepatocellular swelling affected cytosolic [Ca(2+)], and if this involved a purinergic mechanism. Exposure of HTC cells to hypotonic media evoked an increase in cytosolic [Ca(2+)], which was followed by activation of K(+) and Cl(-) currents. Maneuvers that interfered with swelling-induced increases in cytosolic [Ca(2+)], including extracellular Ca(2+) removal and intracellular Ca(2+) store depletion with thapsigargin, inhibited activation of membrane currents and volume recovery. However, the swelling-induced increases in cytosolic [Ca(2+)] were unaffected by either extracellular ATP depletion with apyrase or blockade of P2 receptors with suramin. These findings indicate that swelling elicits an increase in hepatocellular Ca(2+), which is essential for ion channel activation and volume recovery, but that this increase does not stem from activation of volume-sensitive P2 receptors. Collectively, these observations imply that regulatory responses to hepatocellular swelling involve a dual requirement for a purinergic-independent Ca(2+) signaling cascade and a Ca(2+)-independent purinergic signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2108438806,"The ubiquitin-proteasome system is required in growth hormone receptor (GHR) endocytosis. For cytokine receptors, which lack intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, signal transduction is initiated by the activation of a member of the Janus kinase (JAK) family. Previously, we have shown that GHR and JAK2 tyrosine (de) phosphorylation are regulated via the ubiquitin system. In this study, we examined the role of JAK2-mediated signal transduction in GHR internalization and down-regulation. Mutation of the attachment site for JAK2, box-1, in the GHR cytoplasmic tail resulted in the complete absence of GHR and JAK2 phosphorylation. This modification did not alter the rate and extent of receptor-bound growth hormone internalization as compared with a functional GHR, nor did it change its turnover and transport to the plasma membrane. In addition, the receptor was still normally ubiquitinated and remained dependent on both an intact ubiquitin system and proteasomal action for its internalization. Thus, GHR ubiquitination, endocytosis, and degradation occur independently of GHR signal transduction via JAK2.

Studies using mutated box-1 regions of the GHR have shown that this region is intermediate in GH-dependent association and activation of JAK2 (4VanderKuur J.A. Wang X. Zhang L. Cambell G.S.

Although box-1 is sufficient to bind and activate JAK2, maximal JAK2 activation requires downstream residues in the half-proximal part of the GHR cytoplasmic domain. This more distal region appears to stabilize the interaction between the receptor and JAK2. Within box-1, no specific residue seems, in itself, crucial for the association. Neither mutation of each individual proline residue nor simultaneous mutation of the first two prolines in box-1 impaired JAK2 association to the receptor. On the other hand, simultaneous mutation of the four prolines abolished the capacity of the receptor to interact with and activate JAK2 and other signaling proteins (4VanderKuur J.A. Wang X. Zhang L.

Thus, the proline-rich region is critical for GH signal transduction. After binding to its receptor, GH internalizes via clathrin-coated pits and is degraded in lysosomes (17Roupas P. Herington A.C.

This process is regulated by both the ubiquitin system and the proteasome (19Strous G.J. van Kerkhof P. Govers R. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L.

For other signaling receptors containing tyrosine kinase activity, such as the epidermal growth factor (EGF) (23Lamaze C. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and G protein-coupled receptors (24Ferguson S.S. Barak L.S. Zhang J. Caron M.G. Can. J. Physiol.

Res. 1996; 51: 352-353Google Scholar), it was shown that kinase activity is necessary for their maximal internalization rate. In the EGF receptor, mutation of its intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity abolished both signaling transduction and ligand-induced down-regulation/endocytosis (26Chen W.S. Lazar C.S. Poenie M.

Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Until now, a role for JAK2 activity in endocytosis of the GHR has not been described. The role of box-1 in endocytosis is unclear, and mutations in box-1 may lead to a block of GHR endocytosis (15Allevato G. Billestrup N. Goujon L. Galsgaard E.D. Norstedt G. Postel-Vinay M.C. Kelly P.A. Nielsen J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17210-17214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Recently, we observed that signaling of GHR/JAK2 is also regulated by the proteasome because proteasomal inhibitor MG132 prolongs the GH-induced activity of both GHR and JAK2, presumably through stabilization of GHR and JAK2 tyrosine phosphorylation. When proteasomal inhibitor was combined with ligand in an endocytosis-deficient GHR mutant, the same phenomena occurred, indicating that proteasomal action on tyrosine dephosphorylation is independent of endocytosis (28Alves dos Santos C. van Kerkhof P. Strous G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10839-10846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To determine the role of JAK2-mediated signal transduction in GHR internalization and down-regulation, we replaced the four proline residues in box-1 with alanines (GHR4P-A). Modification of box-1 resulted in the complete absence of GHR and JAK2 phosphorylation. We demonstrate that the GHR4P-A mutant behaves in a similar manner as the wtGHR. GHR4P-A presents the same internalization kinetics as wtGHR; it is ubiquitinated normally and depends on an intact ubiquitin system as well as on the proteasome for its internalization. Chinese hamster ts20 cells were stably transfected with the full-length rabbit GHR cDNA sequence as described previously (19Strous G.J. van Kerkhof P. Govers R. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3806-3812Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), as well as a cDNA encoding for a GHR mutation on box-1 (see “Mutagenesis and Transfection”). Due to a thermolabile ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), the ubiquitin conjugating system is inactive in these cells at the nonpermissive temperature of 42 °C. Stable Geneticin-resistant transfectants were grown in Eagle's minimal essential medium (MEM) α supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin, 3.5 g/liter glucose, and 0.45 mg/ml Geneticin. For experiments, cells were grown in the absence of Geneticin to ∼80% confluence. Anti-GHR antiserum was raised against amino acids 271–381 (anti-GHR(T)) of the cytoplasmic tail as described previously (19Strous G.J. van Kerkhof P. Govers R. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3806-3812Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Antibody recognizing the lumenal part of the GHR (Mab5) was from AGEN Inc. (Parsippany, NJ). Antiserum against JAK2 was raised in rabbits as described in Ref. 29Strous G.J. van Kerkhof P. Govers R. Rotwein P. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 40-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar. Polyclonal antibody against JAK2 and phosphotyrosine (4G10; anti-PY) were obtained from Upstate Biotechnologies Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). GH antiserum was from DAKOPATTS, and antiserum specific for protein-ubiquitin conjugates was a generous gift from Dr. A. Ciechanover (Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel). Human GH was a gift of Lilly Research Laboratories (Indianapolis, IN). Culture medium, fetal calf serum, and Geneticin were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. MG132 was purchased from CalBiochem. The signaling-deficient mutant GHR4P-A was constructed by QuickChange mutagenesis (Stratagene), using a 5′ oligonucleotide and a 3′ oligonucleotide containing the unique restriction site KpnI. This GHR cDNA was cloned into pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen), sequenced, and transfected into ts20 cells at 30% confluence using the calcium phosphate transfection method. After transfection, individual clones were selected in Geneticin based on the amount of GH binding and by immunoblotting cell extracts with an antibody to the N terminus of the GHR. 125I-labeled human GH (125I-GH) was prepared by using chloramine T (19Strous G.J. van Kerkhof P. Govers R. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3806-3812Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in 35-mm dishes, washed, and incubated with MEMα supplemented with 20 mm Hepes (MEMα/Hepes) and 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1 h at 30 °C and further incubated for 1 h on ice with 8 nm125I-GH in MEMα/Hepes in the absence or presence of excess unlabeled GH. The cells were washed free of unbound GH and incubated from 0 to 1 h at 30 °C. The cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, membrane-associated GH was removed by acid wash (0.15 mNaCl and 0.05 m glycine, pH 2.5), and internalized GH was determined by measuring the radioactivity after solubilization of the acid-treated cells by 1 m NaOH. The cell extracts were counted in a LKB gamma counter. Cy3-GH was prepared using a FluoroLink Cy3 label kit according to the supplier's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Transfected ts20 cells, grown on coverslips, were incubated for 1 h in MEMα/Hepes at either 30 °C or the nonpermissive temperature of 42 °C and then incubated for 30 min in the presence of Cy3-GH (1 µg/ml). If necessary, MG132 (20 µm) dissolved in ethanol was added 1 h before the start of the experiment. Cells were washed with PBS to remove unbound label and fixed for 2 h in 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS. After fixation, the cells were embedded in Mowiol, and confocal laser scanning microscopy was performed using a Leica TSC 4D system. Cells grown in dishes were lysed on ice in lysis buffer containing 1% Triton-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmNa3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 10 µg/ml aprotinin, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride in PBS. The lysates were cleared by centrifugation. In ubiquitin blotting experiments, the cells were lysed in boiling lysis buffer containing 1% SDS in PBS to minimize isopeptidase activity. The lysate was heated at 100 °C for 5 min, sheared to break all DNA, and centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000 ×g. Immunoprecipitations were carried out in 1% Triton-100, 0.5% SDS, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 0.5% BSA, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 10 µg/ml aprotinin, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride in PBS. Reactions were incubated with GHR(T) or JAK2 antiserum for 2 h at 0 °C. Protein A-agarose beads (Repligen Co., Cambridge, MA) were used to isolate the immunocomplexes. The immunoprecipitates were washed twice with the same buffer and twice with 10-fold diluted PBS. For co-immunoprecipitations, cells were lysed in 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5% BSA, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmNa3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 10 µg/ml aprotinin, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride in PBS. The lysates were further incubated with GH antibody for 2 h, and the immunocomplexes were isolated through protein A-agarose beads. All immunocomplexes were analyzed through 7.5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of SDS (SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) together with total cellular lysate and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride paper. The blots were immunostained with either Mab 4G10 (anti-PY), anti-ubiquitin, anti-GHR, or commercial JAK2 antibody. After incubating the blots with rabbit anti-mouse IgG (RAMPO) or protein A conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, antigens were visualized through the ECL system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). For metabolic labeling, the cells were incubated in methionine-free MEM for 30 min, and then [35S]methionine (3.7 MBq/ml TRAN-35S labelTM; 40 TBq/mmol; ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) was added and labeled for 10 min at 30 °C in a CO2 incubator. The radioactivity was chased for different times with or without 8 nm GH in the presence of MEMα containing 0.1 mm unlabeled methionine and 0.1% BSA. The radioactivity was determined using a StormTM imaging system (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) and quantified with Molecular Dynamics Image Quant software version 4.2a. To determine whether activation of the GHR and downstream signaling components are involved in GH-dependent endocytosis, the four proline residues between amino acids 280–287 in box-1 of the cytosolic tail of the GHR were mutated to alanines (GHR4P-A). An intact box-1 is required for the association of JAK2 with GHR and GH-dependent activation of JAK2 (4VanderKuur J.A. Wang X. Zhang L. Cambell G.S. Allevato G. Billestrup N. Norstedt G. Carter-Su C.

Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 1292-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). A ts20 cell line stably expressing GHR4P-A with approximately the same number of GH binding sites at the cell surface as the wild-type GHR ts20 cell line was used in this experiment. Immunoblot analysis of cellular extracts from both cell lines demonstrated that the mutant receptor expressed a GHR protein of the expected molecular size and that the level of total cell expression was comparable (Fig. 1A). To ascertain that the GHR4P-A mutant was unable to respond to GH, the tyrosine phosphorylation of the GHR was assayed. As shown in Fig. 1 A, no PY signal was detectable on the 130-kDa GHR4P-A mutant upon GH stimulation, in contrast to wtGHR-expressing cells. As a negative control, untransfected ts20 cell lines were used. Similarly, JAK2 did not become tyrosine phosphorylated upon GH addition in cells expressing the GHR4P-A(Fig. 1 B). Box-1 is therefore essential for activation of both JAK2 and GHR, confirming previously published results (4VanderKuur J.A. Wang X. Zhang L. Cambell G.S. Allevato G. Billestrup N. Norstedt G.

To test the capacity of the GHR4P-A to activate signaling molecules other than JAK2, a co-immunoprecipitation of GH·GHR complexes was performed and blotted for phosphotyrosine proteins (Fig.2). As expected, the inactive GHR4P-A did not display the same phosphorylated bands as seen for the wtGHR, indicating that the mutant receptor did indeed lack signaling activity.Figure 2Tyrosine phosphorylation capacity of GHR4P-A cells. ts20 cells and ts20 cells expressing wtGHR and GHR4P-A were incubated at 30 °C with or without 8 nm human GH for the time periods indicated. Cells were lysed, and GH·GHR complexes were co-immunoprecipitated with an antibody against GH (anti-GH), blotted with anti-PY (top panel), and reblotted with anti-GHR (Mab5) (bottom panel). Arrows indicate the mature (mGHR) and precursor (pGHR) forms of the GHR.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether JAK2 tyrosine kinase activity is required for ligand-induced internalization, the uptake of 125I-GH was determined in cell lines expressing either wtGHR or the GHR4P-A mutant. As seen in Fig. 3, the percentage of internalization reached 50% after 30 min of GH induction for the wtGHR. In two independent cell lines, the rate of GH internalization for the box-1-mutated GHR was similar to or higher than that of wild-type receptors. To exclude a possible contribution of receptor recycling, GH internalization was measured during the first 10 min of GH uptake and gave similar results for both types of receptors (data not shown). In addition, the extent and rate of GH degradation were unaltered, indicating that JAK2 activation and GHR phosphorylation play no role in the transport of the ligand to the lysosomes. GHR4P-A internalized bound GH as efficiently as wtGHR, indicating that tyrosine phosphorylation of the GHR is not required for GH-dependent GHR internalization. To approach the same question in a different way, a fibroblastoma cell line deficient in JAK2 (γ2A) and its parental cell line containing JAK2 (2C4) transiently transfected with wtGHR were also tested for GH uptake. Both cell lines showed the same endocytosis rates of125I-GH as observed for the GHR4P-A mutant (data not shown). Next, we assessed the life cycle of both the wtGHR and the GHR4P-A mutant at 30 °C through pulse-chase labeling with [35S]methionine (Fig. 4). The wtGHR is synthesized as a 110-kDa glycoprotein precursor and converted thereafter to a 130-kDa mature species. For both the wtGHR and the GHR4P-A, the mature form was detectable at 20 min of chase and maximal at 60 min, after which rapid degradation occurred (Fig. 4, A and B). These results demonstrate that both receptors have a fast turnover with a half-life of 45–60 min and that maturation and transport to the plasma membrane were not affected by a mutated box-1 in the GHR. To determine whether GH affects receptor turnover, the same experiment was performed in the presence of GH (Fig.4, C and D). GH slightly accelerated degradation of the wtGHR mature form (Fig. 4 C) as compared with GHR4P-A (Fig. 4 D). Using ts20 cell lines, we showed previously that an active ubiquitin-proteasome system is essential for wtGHR internalization (19Strous G.J. van Kerkhof P. Govers R. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3806-3812Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 22van Kerkhof P. Govers G. Alves dos Santos C.M. Strous G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1575-1580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). To elucidate this further, immunofluorescence studies were performed following the uptake of cy3-labeled GH for 30 min (Fig. 5). As a control, wtGHR cells were used (Fig. 5, A–C), clearly demonstrating an inhibition of internalization upon MG132 or 42 °C preincubation, similar to the results of previous results (19Strous G.J. van Kerkhof P. Govers R. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3806-3812Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 22van Kerkhof P. Govers G. Alves dos Santos C.M. Strous G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1575-1580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). For the GHR4P-A mutant cells (Fig. 5, D–F), both treatments induced inhibitory effects similar to those seen for the wtGHR. Fig. 5 D confirms the results presented in Fig. 3, clearly showing a normal ligand internalization staining pattern. Under conditions in which either the proteasomes were inhibited (MG132) or the ubiquitin system was blocked (42 °C), cy3-GH-dependent GHR4P-A mutant internalization was inhibited. To test whether kinase activity plays a role in GHR internalization, both cy3-GH and Texas Red-labeled transferrin, used to control cellular transport, were measured in wtGHR cells treated in the absence or presence of the kinase inhibitor staurosporine (data not shown). Indeed, staurosporine had no effect on the internalization of either ligand, suggesting that tyrosine kinase activity is not essential for GHR endocytosis. To determine whether GHR signaling is involved in receptor ubiquitination, we tested whether the GHR4P-A mutant was ubiquitinated upon GH stimulation. As shown in Fig. 6, in the presence of GH, wtGHR was ubiquitinated at the permissive temperature but was not ubiquitinated at the nonpermissive temperature of 42 °C. Similar results were obtained for the GHR4P-A. Thus, the ubiquitin-proteasome system does not require JAK2 action or its presence on the dimerized GHR for its action to stimulate receptor endocytosis. In conclusion, GHR signal transduction via JAK2 is independent of ubiquitination, endocytosis, and degradation. The GHR is a member of the cytokine/hematopoietin receptor superfamily, defined on the basis of a limited amino acid homology. In the intracellular domain of several members of this superfamily situated close to the plasma membrane, a proline-rich, 8-amino acid-long motif referred to as box-1 has been recognized as being involved in signal transduction (4VanderKuur J.A.

Dinerstein H. Pallier A. Postel-Vinay M.C. Finidori J. Kelly P.A. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 1292-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The association of JAK2 to box-1 of the GHR, activation of the dimerized JAK2 kinase, and JAK2 autophosphorylation are all early steps in the signaling pathway (6Argetsinger L.S. Campbell G.S. Yang X. Witthuhn B.A. Silvennoinen O. Ihle J.N. Carter-Su C. Cell. 1993; 74: 237-244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). The central role of JAK2 in GH signaling is evident from studies using mutated GHRs that failed to bind or activate JAK2 and downstream effectors such as Src homology 2 containing protein (SHC), MAP, signal transducer and activator of transcription, and IRS (4VanderKuur J.A.

The results of our experiments shown in Fig. 1 confirm that JAK2 can be specifically tyrosine phosphorylated in response to GH. Mutation of the four prolines of the box-1 region at the membrane proximal domain of the cytoplasmic tail of the GHR abrogated JAK2 association with the GHR cytoplasmic domain as demonstrated previously (4VanderKuur J.A. Wang X. Zhang L. Cambell G.S. Allevato G. Billestrup N. Norstedt G. Carter-Su C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21709-21717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although mutation of the box-1 region in the GHR did not affect the ability of the altered receptor to bind GH at the cell surface, it dramatically affected the receptor's capacity to couple GH binding to JAK2 activation and consequently the capacity of other possible signaling molecules (Fig. 2). Interestingly, the biological responses of the GHR expressed in a variety of cell types (i.e. activation of MAP kinase, activation of c-fos gene expression, increased protein synthesis, lipid synthesis, and cellular proliferation) have not been observed for the GHR mutant of the box-1 region (30Colosi P. Wong K. Leong S.R. Wood W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12617-12623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Moller C. Hansson A. Enberg B. Lobie P.E. Norstedt G. J. Biol.

Chem. 1991; 266: 17441-17445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to what has been found with other families of signal-transducing growth factor receptors (e.g. EGF receptor), GH-stimulated JAK2 kinase activity and tyrosine phosphorylation of the GHR itself were not required for efficient GH-dependent internalization of the GHR (Fig. 3). A previous report suggested that mutations in box-1 might lead to a block of GHR endocytosis (15Allevato G. Billestrup N. Goujon L. Galsgaard E.D. Norstedt G. Postel-Vinay M.C. Kelly P.A. Nielsen J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17210-17214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In this study, the specific initial rate of internalization of the GHR4P-A appears to be nearly the same as that for normal receptor. Furthermore, as observed in Fig. 3, GH is still normally targeted for degradation in GHR4P-A, indicating that transport to the lysosomes is not affected in box-1-defective receptors. The GHR4P-A turnover also does not differ from that of the wtGHR, suggesting that, once internalized, intracellular sorting destinations of inactive receptor isoforms do not differ from those of functional receptor isoforms. However, upon GH stimulation, the wtGHR mature form showed relatively faster degradation, whereas the addition of GH had no such clear effect on the turnover of the GHR4P-A (Fig. 4). This result suggests that GH-dependent accelerated degradation of wtGHR is mediated through a JAK2-dependent process that is absent in GHR4P-A, indicating that signal transduction is contributing to a faster endocytosis/degradation of the GHR. This might be due to the fact that the signal transduction pathway via signal transducer and activator of transcription or MAP kinase stimulates clathrin-mediated endocytosis, a phenomenon known from EGF receptor studies (33Sorkin A. Mazzotti M. Sorkina T. Scotto L. Beguinot L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13377-13384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Previously, we showed that the ubiquitin system is required for ligand-induced GHR internalization (19Strous G.J. van Kerkhof P. Govers R. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3806-3812Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). In particular, a specific 10-amino acid sequence between amino acids 323 and 332 termed the UbE motif within the GHR cytosolic tail is involved in both GHR ubiquitination and ligand-induced endocytosis (21Govers R. ten Broeke T. van Kerkhof P. Schwartz A.L. Strous G.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). GHR internalization requires the recruitment of the ubiquitin conjugation system to the UbE motif. Recently, we showed that the proteasome is also involved in GHR down-regulation (22van Kerkhof P. Govers G. Alves dos Santos C.M. Strous G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1575-1580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Specific proteasomal inhibitors block GH uptake of the full-length GHR, whereas a truncated receptor can endocytose undisturbed. Using ts20 cells, we determined whether the endocytosis of an inactive GHR is still inhibited upon inactivation of the ubiquitin system or upon inhibition of the proteasome with MG132. Our results show that at the nonpermissive temperature with an impaired ubiquitin system, GHR4P-A internalization was still inhibited as observed previously for the wtGHR (Fig. 5) (19Strous G.J. van Kerkhof P. Govers R. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3806-3812Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Thus, GHR/JAK2 signal transduction plays no role in the binding of the E2/E3 enzymes, members of the ubiquitin conjugation system, to the receptor (Fig. 3). Similarly, the proteasomal inhibitor MG132 prevented GHR4P-A endocytosis as determined previously for the wtGHR (Fig. 5) (22van Kerkhof P. Govers G. Alves dos Santos C.M. Strous G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1575-1580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). This suggests that the motif at the GHR tail responsible for the proteasome action (amino acids 369–399) (22van Kerkhof P. Govers G. Alves dos Santos C.M. Strous G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1575-1580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) does not interact with signaling proteins, nor is such an interaction or phosphorylation important for the proteasome action. Furthermore, both wtGHR and mutated receptor are ubiquitinated upon GH binding (Fig. 6). Together, these results demonstrate that the molecular mechanism that underlies the ubiquitin-proteasome system-dependent endocytosis of the GHR does not require the presence or the activity of JAK2 and its signaling molecules. In a recently published work, we showed that proteasomes are involved in the down-regulation of GHR activation signals (28Alves dos Santos C. van Kerkhof P. Strous G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10839-10846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The endocytosis-deficient receptor GHR F327A was still able to become phosphorylated and induce signal transduction. Surprisingly, its signal transduction was still down-regulated at the cell surface, indicating that it occurs independent of endocytosis. However, proteasomal inhibitors prevented GHR and JAK2 dephosphorylation at the cell surface. We concluded that the ubiquitin-proteasome system is a regulator of JAK2 signal transduction, probably via suppressors of cytokine signaling. Thus, the ubiquitin-proteasome system independently regulates the signal transduction capacity of the GHR in two ways: first, it determines the rate of endocytosis via the UbE-motif in the GHR tail, and second, it determines the signaling time via JAK2 and suppressors of cytokine signaling. Both mechanisms appear to be independently regulated by the same system, probably via completely different E2/E3 enzyme systems. In other systems, e.g. the EGF receptor, association of the adapter protein Grb2 is required for receptor endocytosis. Grb2 associates with the cytoplasmic tail of the EGF receptor after stimulation by EGF, leading to activation of the Ras/MAP kinase signaling pathway. Grb2 also indirectly associates with the GHR via SHC in the region that maps to the distal cytoplasmic tail (amino acids 454–620) (35VanderKuur J.A. Butch E.R. Waters S.B. Pessin J.E. Guan K.L. Carter-Su C. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4301-4307Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Cells expressing truncated receptors, which lack this domain and are therefore unable to associate with Grb2F, can internalize the truncated receptor as efficiently as cells containing wtGHR. Thus, in addition to the dispensability of JAK2 activity and receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, recruitment of Grb2 to the receptor and activation of the MAP kinase pathway is also not required for GHR down-regulation. Similarly, EGF-stimulated activation of Src kinase leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of clathrin, and because phosphorylation is required to recruit clathrin to the membrane, this observation strongly suggests a role for c-Src in EGF receptor endocytosis (34Wilde A. Beattie E.C. Lem L. Riethof D.A. Liu S.-H. Mobley W.C. Soriano P. Brodsky F.M. Cell. 1999; 96: 677-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). This is not the case for the GHR4P-Abecause inhibition of JAK2 and consequently of Src does not affect GHR clathrin-dependent endocytosis. Furthermore, it has recently been published that neither activation of the erythropoietin receptor, another member of the cytokine family, nor JAK2 tyrosine kinase activity is required for internalization of bound erythropoietin (36Beckman D Lin L.L. Quinones M.E. Longmore G.D. Blood. 1999; 94: 2667-2675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that, for signaling receptors of the cytokine receptor superfamily, endocytosis follows a pathway distinct from signaling receptors of the receptor-tyrosine kinase family.

https://openalex.org/W2048331014,"Abstract Nucleocapsid (NC) protein possesses nucleotide-annealing activities, which are used in various processes in retroviral life cycle. As conserved characters, the NC proteins have one or two zinc fingers of CX 2CX 4HX 4C motif surrounded by basic amino acid sequences. Requirement of the zinc fingers for the annealing activities of NC protein remains controversial. In this study, we focused the requirement in the process of maturation of dimeric viral RNA. Discrimination between immature and mature dimers of synthetic RNA corresponding to the dimerization initiation site of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) genomic RNA was performed based on their Mg2+-dependent stability in gel electrophoreses and on their distinct signal pattern from NMR analysis of imino protons. Chaperoning activity of the HIV-1 NC protein, NCp7, and its fragments for maturation of dimeric RNA was investigated using these experimental systems. We found that the two basic regions flanking the N-terminal zinc finger of NCp7, which are connected by two glycine residues instead of the zinc finger, were sufficient, although about 10 times the amounts of peptide were needed in comparison with intact NCp7. Further, it was found that the amount of basic residues rather than the amino acid sequence itself is important for the activity. The zinc fingers may involve the binding affinity and/or such a possible specific binding of NCp7 to dimerization initiation site dimer that leads to the maturation reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1995855524,"We have investigated the importance of dimerization of E-cadherin in the heterophilic adhesive interaction between E-cadherin and integrin αEβ7. Dimerization of cadherin molecules in parallel alignment is known to be essential for homophilic adhesion and has been attributed to Ca2+-dependent interactions in the domain 1-2 junction or to cross-intercalation of Trp2 from one molecule to the other. We have disrupted either or both of these proposed mechanisms by point mutations in E-cadherin-Fc and have tested the modified proteins for αEβ7-mediated cell adhesion. Prevention of Trp2 intercalation had no adverse effect on integrin-mediated adhesion, whereas disruption of Ca2+ binding permitted adhesion but with reduced efficiency. Both modifications in combination abolished recognition by αEβ7. In EGTA, αEβ7 adhered to wild type E-cadherin but not to the Trp2 deletion mutant. Independent evidence that the mutations prevented either or both mechanisms for dimerization is presented. The data show that dimerization is required for recognition by αEβ7 and that it can take place by either of two mechanisms.

It is a type 1 transmembrane protein that contains five Ig-like extracellular domains maintained in a rodlike conformation by interdomain calcium atoms. In addition to its adhesive activity, E-cadherin has an important role as a cell signaling molecule and through both activities serves to maintain the integrity of epithelia (1Vleminckx K. Kemler R. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 211-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). E-cadherin is also a counterreceptor for one member of the integrin family, the mucosal T cell integrin αEβ7 (2Cepek K.L.

This heterophilic adhesive interaction is thought to play a part in the retention of lymphocytes in or near mucosal epithelia (4Schon M.P. Arya A Murphy E.A. Adams C.M. Strauch U.G. Agace W.W. Marsal J. Donohue J.P. Her H. Beier D.R. Olson S. Lefrancois L. Brenner M.B. Grusby M.J. Parker C.M. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 6641-6649PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, much attention has been focused on the molecular mechanisms for the two types of adhesion. A model has been proposed for homophilic adhesion in which adjacent cadherin molecules on the cell surface dimerize in parallel alignment (cis-dimer) and interdigitate with dimers on an opposing cell to form a zipper-like assembly of multiple low affinity contacts (5Shapiro L. Fannon A.M. Kwong P.D. Thompson A. Lehmann M.S. Grubel G. Legrand J-F Als-Nielsen J. Colman D.R. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1995; 374: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). Homophilic adhesion, heterophilic adhesion and cadherin dimerization depend mainly on contact sites on the extracellular, N-terminal domain EC1.The mechanism for cadherin dimerization is not yet fully understood. X-ray crystallographic studies on cadherin domain 1 or domains 1 and 2 together have suggested two alternative mechanisms. Shapiro et al. (5Shapiro L. Fannon A.M. Kwong P.D. Thompson A. Lehmann M.S. Grubel G. Legrand J-F Als-Nielsen J. Colman D.R. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1995; 374: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar) observed that domain 1 of N-cadherin formed cis-dimers by cross-intercalation of Trp2 into a hydrophobic pocket in its neighboring domain. In contrast, Nagar et al. (6Nagar B. Overduin M. Ikura M. Rini J.M. Nature. 1996; 380: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar) found that E-cadherin domains 1 and 2 dimerize through calcium-dependent hydrogen bonding in the interdomain junction. Pertz et al. (7Pertz O. Bozic D. Koch A.W. Fauser C. Andrea Brancaccio A. Engel J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1738-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar) obtained similar results and showed that Trp2 docked into the hydrophobic pocket of its own domain rather than providing a bridge to its neighbor. The crystal structure of N-cadherin domains 1 plus 2 failed to reveal a cis-interaction by either mechanism (8Tamura K. Shan W-S. Hendrickson W.A. Colman D.R. Shapiro L. Neuron. 1998; 20: 1153-1163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Support for Ca2+ dependence of dimerization has come from observation of purified recombinant cadherin molecules by electron microscopy (7Pertz O. Bozic D. Koch A.W. Fauser C. Andrea Brancaccio A. Engel J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1738-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar), atomic force microscopy (9Baumgartner W. Hinterdorfer P. Ness W. Raab A. Vestweber D. Schindler H. Drenckhahn D.

Investigations into the mechanism of cadherin dimerization on the cell surface have given a different picture. Cadherin complexes have been isolated from cell lysates and analyzed by sedimentation or electrophoresis. In this situation, Trp2 was shown to be essential for cis-dimer formation (11Shan W-S.

It is not known whether the two proposed mechanisms for dimerization could operate simultaneously, but the crystal structures of ECAD1,2 (6Nagar B. Overduin M. Ikura M. Rini J.M.

Although the precise roles of Trp2 and interdomain calcium are not fully understood, it is widely accepted that both are required for homophilic adhesion and that cis-dimerization is an essential part of the process.Integrin αEβ7 has been shown to bind to the distal surface of domain 1 and the contact site has been mapped in detail. Karecla et al. (17Karecla P.I. Green S.J. Bowden S.J. Coadwell J. Kilshaw P.J. J. Biol.

Recently, this observation has been confirmed and extended to identify a role also for the FG loop located nearby (18Taraszka K.S. Higgins J.M.G. Tan K. Mandelbrot D.A. Wang J.H. Brenner M.B. J. Exp.

Thus, the acidic side chain of Glu31 docks into the MIDAS site of the αE A domain and Phe298 from the A-domain is accommodated in a hydrophobic cleft between the BC and FG loops of E-cadherin. The MIDAS site on the integrin β7subunit is also required for ligand binding (19Higgins J.M.G. Cernadas M. Tan K. Irie A. Wang J.H. Takada Y. Brenner M.B. J. Biol.

The two proposed mechanisms for dimer formation have been investigated. We have prepared a series of E-cadherin-Fc fusion proteins in which amino acid substitutions have been made either in the N terminus, to prevent Trp2 cross-intercalation, or in the junction between domains 1 and 2, to prevent co-ordination of one or more of the three calcium atoms present. The two categories of modification are referred to as “single” mutations or, when combined, as “double” mutations. The recombinant proteins have been tested for their ability to support αEβ7-mediated cell adhesion and to dimerize. None of the amino acid substitutions would be expected to have any direct effect on the contact site on E-cadherin, which engages the integrin. The results show that cadherin dimerization is essential for adhesion to the integrin and provide a new perspective on the relative importance of Trp2 and the EC1-EC2 interdomain junction for the formation of cis-dimers.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Lines and AntibodiesThe mouse T cell hybridoma MTC-1 was grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FCS1and 5 ng/ml recombinant transforming growth factor-β2. Under these conditions, the cells expressed high levels of αEβ7. The mouse gut epithelial cell line CMT93, which expresses E-cadherin on the cell surface, was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% FCS. The rat monoclonal antibodies ECCD-2 (21Sirayoshi Y. Nose A. Iwasaki K. Takeichi M. Cell Struct. Funct. 1986; 11: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and DECMA-1 (22Ozawa M. Hoshutzky H. Herrenknecht K. Kemler R. Mech. Dev. 1990; 33: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), specific for E-cadherin, and M290 (23Kilshaw P.J. Baker K.C. Immunol. Lett. 1988; 18: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), specific for mouse αE A-domain, were purified from culture supernatants. Sheep antisera to two peptides in E-cadherin domain 1 were prepared. The sequence spanning the βBC loop (amino acids 25–35), KSNRDKETKVF, and that representing the distal part of the βB strand (amino acids 19–30), KNLVQIKSNRDK, were conjugated to KLH. Sheep were immunized with the conjugates in complete Freund's adjuvant and boosted twice using incomplete adjuvant.E-cadherin-Fc ConstructsThe extracellular region of mouse E-cadherin, excluding the signal sequence and propeptide was fused to human IgG1 Fc using the vector Signal pIg-Tail (R & D Systems), which incorporates a CD33 signal sequence. The construct introduced three additional amino acids (Met, Asp, and Leu) to the N terminus of fully processed, mature E-cadherin. The extracellular region extending up to, but not including, the transmembrane domain was fused to the complete IgG1 Fc hinge. cDNA for the extracellular region of E-cadherin was prepared by polymerase chain reaction using Pfu polymerase, introducing BglII restriction sites into the 5′ and 3′ primers. In addition, a splice donor site was included in the 3′ primer to remove an IgG1 intron so that correct splicing to the IgG1 hinge exon would take place. Forward primer was 5′-GATCAGATCTAGACTGGGTCATCCCTCCCATCAGC-3′; reverse primer was 5′-GATCAGATCTACTTACCTGTAACTTGCAATCCTGCTGCCACGATT-3′.Constructs for wild type E-cadherin and all mutants were prepared using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Mutations were prepared in the N-terminal region, the Ca2+-binding region of EC1–2, or in both positions (Table I). Forward primers for the constructs are listed as follows and were used in conjunction with their reverse complements: wild type E-cadherin (removal of MDL from the N terminus), 5′-GCTGTGGGCAGGGGCCCTGGCTGACTGGGTCATCCCTCCCATCAGC-3′; mutation W2G/V3A (WV), 5′-GCTGTGGGCAGGGGCCCTGGCTGACGGGGCCATCCCTCCCATCAGC-3′; mutation D67A (Ca1), 5′-GGCTGAAAGTGACACAGCCTCTGGCTAGAGAAGCCATTGCC-3′; mutation Q101A/N102A (Ca2,3), 5′-GTGATCACAGTGACAGATGCGGCTGACAACAGGCCAGAG-3′; mutation D134A (Ca3), 5′-GGTCTCAGCCACCGCTGCAGACGATGACGTCAAC-3′.Table IMutations prepared in E-cadherin-FcAmino acid changesDirect consequencesAbbreviationAddition of Met, Asp, and Leu to N terminusStructural change likely to prevent Trp2 dockingMDLW2G/V3APrevention of Trp2 dockingWVD67ARemoval of a ligand for Ca1 in domain 1–2 junctionCa1Q101A/N102ARemoval of ligand for Ca2 and Ca3 in domain 1–2 junctionCa2,3D134ARemoval of ligand for Ca3 in domain 1–2 junctionCa3 Open table in a new tab In a second set of mutants, a factor Xa cleavage site (IEGR) was introduced immediately distal to the Ig hinge region: 5′-GCATGAAGGCGGGAATCGAGGGAAGAGGATTGCAAGTTACAG-3′.All constructs were sequenced to confirm fidelity. DNA for transfection into COS cells was prepared using a Plasmid Maxi Kit (Qiagen).Preparation of E-cadherin-Fc Fusion ProteinsCOS7 cells were transfected using a modification of the DEAE-dextran method (24Gonzalez A.L. Joly E. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 216-217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). After overnight recovery in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% FCS, the cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 1% FCS for 4–6 days. The medium was then harvested, cleared of cell debris by centrifugation at 1500 × g, and then centrifuged at 50,000 ×g for 1 h. Sterile supernatants were stored at 4 °C. A representative set of E-cadherin-Fc fusion proteins (WT, MDL, WV, Ca2,3, WV + Ca2,3, and MDL + Ca2,3) were analyzed by gel filtration fast protein liquid chromatography on a Superdex-200HR 10/30 column equilibrated in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl, 0.05% Tween 20 to verify that they were monodisperse. The double mutant, Ca2,3 + WV, was susceptible to aggregation on long term storage, so particular care was taken to ensure that all experiments were conducted with monodispersed material. The double mutant was also subjected to N-terminal sequencing to ensure that no degradation had taken place. E-cadherin-Fc proteins were purified from culture supernatant by elution from protein A-Sepharose using 0.1 mglycine/HCl or 50 mm citrate, pH 3.0, followed by immediate neutralization in Tris and restoration of Ca2+ to 2 mm. Purity was verified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Concentrations were determined by adsorbance at 280 nm.Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent AssayThe concentration of E-cadherin-Fc in culture supernatants was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using purified E-cadherin-Fc as a standard. 96-well plates were coated overnight with affinity-purified goat anti-human Fc at 5 µg/ml in PBS. Dilutions of supernatants containing known quantities of E-cadherin-Fc were incubated on the plate for 1 h at room temperature, and their binding was detected by a similar incubation with biotinylated goat anti-human Fc (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories), followed by avidin-horseradish peroxidase (Sigma). Binding of rat monoclonal antibodies DECMA-1 and ECCD-2 (both at 1 µg/ml) to E-cadherin-Fc was detected using horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rat IgG (Chemicon). For titration of sheep antibodies to the BC loop and the βB strand, E-cadherin-Fc proteins were immobilized using rabbit anti-human Fc (Pierce), and binding of the antibodies was detected with a mouse monoclonal antibody to sheep IgG (Sigma). With both antisera, reactivity was specifically inhibited by their respective peptides.Analytical UltracentrifugationSedimentation equilibrium and sedimentation velocity experiments were performed at 20 °C using a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman Instruments) equipped with 12-mm Epon double sector cells in an An-60 Ti rotor. The proteins were dissolved in 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.9, 100 mm NaCl, and 2 mm CaCl2. The protein concentration was adjusted to 0.5 mg/ml for sedimentation equilibrium runs and to 0.15 mg/ml for the sedimentation velocity scans. Sedimentation coefficients were determined by sedimentation velocity experiments at rotor speeds of 52,000 rpm. The absorbance of the sedimenting material was measured at 232 nm. Sedimentation coefficients were corrected to standard conditions (water, 20 °C). Sedimentation equilibrium runs were carried out at 8000–17,000 rpm, depending on molecular mass. Apparent molecular masses were evaluated from lnA versus r 2 plots, where Ais the absorbance and r is the distance from the rotor center.Cell Adhesion AssaysIntegrin-mediated AdhesionE-cadherin-Fc fusion proteins were coated to a 96-well enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate (Costar; 3590) via goat anti-Fc as described for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. MTC-1 cells were labeled with BCECF-AM (Molecular Probes catalog no. B-3051) by incubation in 1 ml of serum-free RPMI containing 5 µg/ml BCECF-AM for 30–40 min at 37 °C. The cells were then washed and resuspended at 5 × 105/ml in assay medium, HBSS (Sigma) containing 1.25 mmCa2+ and 0.8 mm Mg2+ plus 1% FCS. The cells were then activated by the addition of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (15 ng/ml). 5 × 104 cells were added to each well in a total volume of 200 µl. The plate was centrifuged for 2 min at 16 × g to gently sediment the cells and then incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Nonadherent cells were then removed by gentle pipetting, and the attached cells were quantitated using a fluorescence plate reader. For assays conducted in the absence of Ca2+, MTC-1 cells were suspended in Hanks' balanced saline solution plus 0.1% bovine serum albumin, activated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, and then washed free of Ca2+ and transferred to Hanks' balanced saline solution lacking Ca2+ and Mg2+, supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 1 mm EGTA, and 10 mmMg2+. For experiments involving antibody-mediated inhibition of adhesion, purified IgG antibodies (DECMA-1, ECCD2, M290) were present in the adhesion assay at 10 µg/ml (DECMA-1 and ECCD2) or 2.5 µg/ml (M290). Adhesion results are expressed as mean percentage of cells adhering in three or four replicate wells ± S.E.Homophilic AdhesionE-cadherin-Fc fusion proteins were attached to assay plates as described above. CMT93 cells were dissociated by chelation (nonenzymatic cell dissociation solution; Sigma) and maintained in suspension in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% FCS at 37 °C for 20 min. They were then transferred to Hanks' balanced saline solution plus 1% FCS, and 8 × 104 cells were added to each well. The plates were then incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Nonadherent cells were washed away, and residual adherent cells were quantitated by measuring acid phosphatase activity (25Tolosa E. Shaw S. J. Immunol. Methods. 1996; 192: 165-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar).Cleavage with Factor Xa1–2 µg of E-cadherin-Fc bound to 10 µl of protein A-Sepharose was suspended in 50 µl of 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0. 1 µg of factor Xa (1 µl at 1 mg/ml; New England Biolabs) was added and incubated at room temperature for 5 h. Released cadherin fragments were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by Western blotting using DECMA-1. Residual IgFc on the beads was released with SDS sample buffer and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-Fc.DISCUSSIONThe primary aim of this study was to determine whether cis-dimerization of E-cadherin is required for recognition by αEβ7. We chose E-cadherin-Fc proteins for the analysis because the disulfide bonds of the Ig hinge would hold the membrane-proximal regions of paired cadherin molecules in close apposition. This may simulate the situation on the cell membrane when regulatory mechanisms acting on the cytoplasmic domain favor cadherin clustering (30Ozawa M. Kemler R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1605-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 31Ozawa M. Kemler R. J. Biol.

Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4415-4423Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have demonstrated that transmembrane segments of E-cadherin cluster together, possibly by a leucine zipper-type mechanism, and have proposed that this mechanism acts in concert with cis-interactions at domain 1 to stabilize the dimer. At low Ca2+ concentrations, other ectodomains may also be involved (33Troyanovsky R.B. Klingelhofer J. Troyanovsky S. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4379-4387Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have focused specifically on cis-interactions at domain 1. The mutations in the N-terminal region of domain 1 and in the Ca2+ binding sites in the EC1-EC2 junction were selected to investigate the two proposed mechanisms for dimerization. We extended the N terminus by three amino acids, MDL, because this would be expected to interfere with the cross-intercalation of Trp2 between domain pairs (5Shapiro L. Fannon A.M. Kwong P.D. Thompson A. Lehmann M.S. Grubel G. Legrand J-F Als-Nielsen J. Colman D.R. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1995; 374: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar) or docking into its own domain (7Pertz O. Bozic D. Koch A.W. Fauser C. Andrea Brancaccio A. Engel J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1738-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). As predicted, results with this mutant were identical to those with the WV mutant and are consistent with previous reports that correct cleavage of the N terminus (34Ozawa M. Kemler R. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1645-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) and the presence of Trp2 (12, 13,) are both essential for cadherin function. Mutations of amino acids coordinating Ca1, Ca2,3, or Ca3 were selected by reference to two published crystal structures (6Nagar B. Overduin M. Ikura M. Rini J.M. Nature. 1996; 380: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar, 7Pertz O. Bozic D. Koch A.W. Fauser C. Andrea Brancaccio A. Engel J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1738-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar) and a previous report (35Ozawa M. Engel J. Kemler R. Cell. 1990; 63: 1033-1038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) that the Ca3 mutant (Asp134 → Ala) prevents homophilic adhesion. The Ca2,3 mutant (Q101A/N102A) removed Gln101, which is thought to play a key role in hydrogen bonding between the domain pair (6Nagar B. Overduin M. Ikura M. Rini J.M. Nature. 1996; 380: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). The binding site for Ca1 was targeted because it is thought to have a lower affinity for Ca2+ than the other two sites (7Pertz O. Bozic D. Koch A.W. Fauser C. Andrea Brancaccio A. Engel J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1738-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 27Koch A.W. Pokutta S. Lustig A. Engel J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7697-7705Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and to be required for homophilic adhesion but not dimer formation (7Pertz O. Bozic D. Koch A.W. Fauser C. Andrea Brancaccio A. Engel J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1738-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Our results with Ca1 were, however, similar to those with the other two calcium loss mutants. Calcium binding has not yet been measured empirically in these mutants, so it is not absolutely certain that we achieved selectivity for particular calcium atoms; loss of a single calcium ligand may have destabilized the junctional region as a whole.Prevention of Trp2 intercalation alone was shown to have no effect on integrin-mediated adhesion, and loss of one or more calcium atoms in the EC1-EC2 junction permitted αEβ7-mediated adhesion but with reduced efficiency. The two types of modification in combination completely prevented adhesion, which implies that integrity of one or the other mechanism for dimerization was required. A reciprocal relationship between Trp2 and interdomain Ca2+ was confirmed by the observation that integrin-mediated adhesion in the presence of EGTA was abrogated by the removal of Trp2.Binding of peptide antibodies specific for the BC loop or the βB strand strongly supports our contention that dimers can form by either mechanism. The antibodies bound to double mutants, which should not form dimers, but did not bind to wild type or single mutants in which dimerization would be expected. Experiments with the Trp2 replacement mutant, WV, demonstrated that the Ca2+-dependent mechanism required Ca2+ concentrations higher than 125 µm. At this level, the first indication of dissociation into monomers was detected.Attempts to monitor dimerization by chemical cross-linking experiments with E-cadherin-Fc have been unsuccessful for technical reasons. Similarly, electron microscopic observations on the proteins have been confounded by disruption of the dimeric conformation during the preparative procedures. Nevertheless, our studies with factor Xa proteolysis have provided additional evidence for major conformational changes consistent with the presence of absence of dimers. Generation of nonspecific cleavage products in the IgFc hinge using factor Xa can be adequately explained by differences in flexibility at the Ig hinge related to dimerization at the level of EC1. To our knowledge, this is a novel use of a restriction peptidase to monitor conformational changes in a protein.Another laboratory recently reported that dimerization of E-cadherin was unnecessary for either αEβ7-mediated adhesion or homophilic adhesion (36Berg R.W. Yang Y. Lehnert K. Krissansen G.W. Immunol. Cell Biol. 1999; 77: 337-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The authors observed that unmodified E-cadherin-Fc fusion protein that had been reduced and alkylated in the Ig hinge and was assumed to be monomeric functioned normally in either type of assay. The interpretation is, however, flawed, because in these circumstances strong noncovalent interactions between the CH3 domains of the paired Fc regions would have maintained the dimeric structure (37Thies M.J. Mayer J. Augustine J.G. Frederick C.A. Lilie H. Buchner J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 67-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 38Dall'Acqua W. Simon A.L. Mulkerrin M.G. Carter P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9266-9273Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar).Implications for Integrin FunctionIn principal, a dimeric ligand could either bind two separate integrin molecules by monovalent interactions or one integrin molecule in a bivalent manner. Recent studies on the crystal structure of the ICAM-1 dimer suggest that monovalency is likely in the interaction with LFA-1 (39Casasnovas J.M. Stehle T. Liu J-H. Wang J.H. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1998; 95: 4134-4139Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The critical Glu34 integrin contact residues in the ICAM-1 dimer are located on outward facing surfaces on opposite sides of the molecule a maximum distance apart, about 4.2 nm (39Casasnovas J.M. Stehle T. Liu J-H. Wang J.H. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1998; 95: 4134-4139Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In contrast, the two Glu31 residues that lie side by side on the top surface of dimeric E-cadherin and are recognized by αEβ7 are more closely spaced, about 2.4 nm apart. A convincing model has recently been proposed for the interaction between the A-domain of the αE integrin subunit and the top surface of E-cadherin domain 1, involving docking of E-cadherin Glu31 into the αE MIDAS site (19Higgins J.M.G.

RAP1 also participates in other nuclear processes, and discrete domains of RAP1 have been shown to have specific properties including DNA binding, DNA bending, transcriptional activation, and silencing and telomere functions. To investigate whether specific domains of RAP1 are required to “open” chromatin and help GCN4 to activate theHIS4 gene, we examined the abilities of different truncated RAP1 proteins to perturb positioned nucleosomes via a nucleosomal RAP1 site in a yeast episome in vivo, and we testedHIS4 activation in yeast strains harboring truncated RAP1 mutants. We found that neither the DNA bending domain nor the putative activation domain of RAP1 is required for its ability to perturb the chromatin structure of a plasmid containing a RAP1 site. Similarly, neither the putative activation domain nor the N-terminal DNA-bending domain was required for GCN4-mediated activation of HIS4. We also used a rap1ts mutant to show that continuous occupancy of the HIS4 promoter by RAP1 is required for GCN4-mediated gene activation.

Binding sites for RAP1 have been found in promoters, silencers, and telomeres, and correspondingly, RAP1 participates in gene transcription, silencing, and telomere maintenance (1Shore D. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 408-412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). RAP1 has been implicated in transcriptional activation of many genes including the mating-type genes MATα1 and MATα2, ribosomal protein genes, and glycolytic genes. RAP1 also contributes to a meiotic recombination at the HIS4 locus (2White M.A. Wierdl M. Detloff P. Petes T.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9755-9759Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and a cluster of RAP1 binding sites from the TEF1 promoter has recently been shown to function as a boundary element that can prevent the spread of silent chromatin (3Bi X. Broach J.R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1089-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar).The ability of RAP1 to play such disparate roles in yeast depends in part on its ability to interact with a variety of other proteins. In many cases, the sites of interaction have been mapped, and a domain structure for RAP1 has been constructed based on these and other findings (Fig. 1). The central part of this 827-amino acid protein contains the DNA-binding domain, and the C terminus contains domains that interact with the SIR and RIF proteins, which are important for silencing and telomeric length control (4Hardy C.F.J. Sussel L. Shore D. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 801-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Also, within this C-terminal part, amino acids 630–695 function as an activation domain in a hybrid GAL4-RAP1 fusion protein (5Hardy C.F.J. Sussel L. Shore D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1209-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The N terminus of RAP1 is a large region that is not essential for cell viability, although it may be involved in regulating the activity of RAP1 through a putative BRCT domain (6Callebaut I. Mornon J.P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). It has also been shown to potentiate DNA bending by RAP1 in vitro (7Muller T. Gilson E. Schmidt R. Giraldo R. Sogo J. Gross H. Gasser S.M. J. Struct. Biol. 1994; 113: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). RAP1 also contributes to the transcription of glycolytic enzyme genes via cooperative interactions with the activator GCR1, and in this case, in vitro experiments have shown that either the N-terminal or the C-terminal moiety of RAP1 together with the DNA-binding domain suffices to assist GCR1 binding, although the DNA-binding domain alone does not (8Lopez M.C. Smerage J.B. Baker H.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14112-14117Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).A property of RAP1 that is likely to contribute to its function in disparate processes is a potent ability to perturb chromatin structure in a way that increases access by DNA-binding proteins and nucleases, a property we refer to as “chromatin opening” (9Morse R.H. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 51-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 10Yu L. Morse R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5279-5288Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This property most clearly contributes to RAP1 function at the HIS4promoter where a RAP1 binding site is required to overcome the repressive effect of chromatin structure and allow GCN4 to bind and activate transcription in response to conditions of amino acid starvation (10Yu L. Morse R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5279-5288Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 11Devlin C. Tice-Baldwin K. Shore D. Arndt K.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3642-3651Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). When HIS4 activation is made to depend on other activators with a better ability to outcompete histones for binding to DNA, the RAP1 site becomes dispensable, indicating that the RAP1 requirement is a consequence of the poor ability of GCN4 to bind to chromatin under physiological conditions (10Yu L. Morse R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5279-5288Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), More recently, we have used chromatin immunoprecipitation to show directly that GCN4 binding to the HIS4 promoter is reduced when the RAP1 binding site is mutated. 2L. Yu, J. P. Madigan, and R. H. Morse, unpublished results. 2L. Yu, J. P. Madigan, and R. H. Morse, unpublished results. The ability of RAP1 to open chromatin can also be assessed by placing a RAP1 site into a stable episome that serves as a chromatin reporter in yeast cells. An introduction of a mutant RAP1 site allows a positioned nucleosome to form that incorporates the mutant site, whereas a wild-type RAP1 binding site (the same one present in theHIS4 promoter) prevents nucleosome positioning in its near vicinity (10Yu L. Morse R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5279-5288Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar).Nucleosome perturbation via a GAL4 site near the center of a positioned nucleosome or via a PHO4 binding site just outside a positioned nucleosome requires the binding protein to have a functional activation domain (12Morse R.H.

We also used a strain expressing a RAP1 mutant that is conditional for DNA binding to examine whether RAP1 binding is required for continuous expression of HIS4 or only for the initial chromatin opening event that allows GCN4 to bind.

The coats are commonly divided into two groups: the clathrin-based coats and the nonclathrin coatomers. Coat proteins are recruited to the cytoplasmic surface of the donor organelle membrane from a cytosolic pool, and this process is thought to be regulated by specific small GTP-binding proteins. Upon binding to an organelle, coat proteins are believed to serve two main functions: 1) to promote selective sorting of protein passengers into budding areas in the donor organelle and hence into the nascent carrier vesicle (this process is mediated by coat protein recognition of short cytoplasmic amino acid stretches, termed sorting signals) and 2) to initiate local membrane deformation (bending) required for the formation of transport vesicle from a physically stable donor membrane. Following vesicle formation, the coat material is removed, and the coat-free carrier vesicle travels along cytoskeletal tracks toward its acceptor membrane. Considerable progress has been made during the last few years toward the understanding of the structure and function of clathrin-based coats (for recent reviews, see Refs. 1Kirchhausen T. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 705-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar and 2Kirchhausen T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 699-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Clathrin coats are assembled from two major components: clathrin and adaptor complexes (adaptor proteins; APs).1 APs are recruited from the cytosol onto the cytoplasmic surface of two distinct organelles: the plasma membrane and the trans-Golgi network (TGN). The binding of APs is essential for the subsequent assembly of cytosolic clathrin on the donor membrane, and hence for the subsequent vesicle formation. The accepted mechanism is that the assembly of cytosolic clathrin forms the scaffold required for the local deformation of membrane and for the subsequent formation of clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs). AP-2 complexes drive the formation of clathrin-coated endocytic vesicles from the plasma membrane, whereas AP-1 complexes prompt the formation of exocytic transport vesicles in the TGN. Ultrastructural studies suggest a low level of AP-1 association with endosomes (1Kirchhausen T. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 705-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). In addition, an AP-1-related complex localized neither to the TGN nor to endosomal compartments has recently been identified (3Takatsu H. Sakurai M. Shin H.W. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24693-24700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Both AP-1 and AP-2 complexes are heterotetramers, consisting of two large subunits termed adaptins (γ and β1 in the case of AP-1; α and β2 in the case of AP-2), a medium-sized subunit (µ1 or µ2), and a small subunit (ς1 or ς2). The primary function of the β-subunit is to bind clathrin, but it may also be involved in the recognition of dileucine-based sorting signals (4Rapoport I. Chen Y.C. Cupers P. Shoelson S.E. Kirchhausen T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2148-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The γ and α adaptins most likely contain targeting information in a 200-residue region within the N-terminal core domain (5Page L.J. Robinson M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 619-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). µ1A, the ubiquitous chain of the AP-1 adaptor complex, may also have some function in AP-1 binding to the TGN and the recognition of tyrosine-based sorting signals encoded by cargo proteins (1Kirchhausen T. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 705-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). An epithelium-specific µ-chain version, µ1B, has recently been cloned and implicated in basolateral targeting of specific receptors (6Folsch H. Ohno H. Bonifacino J.S. Mellman I. Cell. 1999; 99: 189-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). The function of the ς subunit is unknown. Although considerable progress has been made in recent years in resolving problems of recognition, specificity, and regulation of cargo/AP/clathrin interactions, we still lack a deep mechanistic understanding of how APs are involved in the formation of transport vesicles, and whether they are involved in downstream events of vesicle transport. Also, the need for APs in clathrin coat formation remains unresolved (1Kirchhausen T. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 705-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Simultaneous disruption of all known AP subunits in yeast, for example, failed to generate the clathrin minus phenotype and has no noticeable effect on the generation of clathrin-coated vesicles and cell cycle in the mutant yeast (7Huang K.M. D'Hondt K. Riezman H. Lemmon S.K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3897-3908Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). However, knockout experiments in which the µ1A-subunit gene has been deleted in mice indicated a key function for AP-1 in endosomal sorting of mannose 6-phosphate receptors (8Meyer C. Zizioli D. Lausmann S. Eskelinen E.L. Hamann J. Saftig P. von Figura K. Schu P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2193-2203Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), and when the γ-adaptin gene was deleted in mice, mouse embryos died at a very early stage of development (9Zizioli D. Meyer C. Guhde G. Saftig P. von Figura K. Schu P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5385-5390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). These results suggest that AP complexes, including AP-1 adaptors, play more important roles in multicellular organisms than in yeast. But these observations also raise general concerns related to AP functions. It is possible, for instance, that the severe failure of multicellular organization associated with γ-adaptin deletion is due to general malfunction in clathrin coat assembly. Another possibility is that AP-1 complexes perform additional, yet unrecognized, cellular functions uniquely expressed in Metazoa. In this paper, we show that AP-1 adaptors are capable of interacting with microtubules (MTs) via scaffolding proteins belonging to the structural MT-associated protein (MAP) family. Structural MAPs promote tubulin polymerization, stabilize MTs often in the form of bundles, function as molecular spacers linking microtubular tracks, and interact with F-actin (for reviews see Refs. 10Mandelkow E. Mandelkow E.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 72-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar and 11Maccioni R.B. Cambiazo V. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 835-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). The increasing stability of MTs is thought to be critical for neuronal morphogenesis and the development of cell polarity (12Drewes G. Ebneth A. Mandelkow E.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 307-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). On the basis of this knowledge and our data we propose that ubiquitous MAPs (e.g.microtubule-associated protein of type 1A (MAP1a)) are involved in loading AP-1-bearing transport vesicles onto appropriate MTs. AP-1-MAP interactions may also modulate the stability of MTs and the structure of AP-1-coated organelles. Tubulin purified from calf brain, containing ∼85% tubulin and 15% associated proteins (MAP-containing tubulin; MCT), was prepared by heat-dependent assembly-disassembly cycles (kindly provided by Dr. Pnina Yaish (Sigma). MCT was provided as a lyophilized powder containing MES buffer salts, EGTA, EDTA, MgCl2, dithiothreitol, GTP, leupeptin, aprotinin, and sucrose as stabilizer. The powder was reconstituted in H2O supplemented with 100 µm paclitaxel (Taxol) to yield 10 mg/ml protein concentration. MTs were assembled according to protocols provided by the manufacturer. Taxol was purchased from Sigma. Latrunculin A was a generous gift from Prof. Yoel Kashman (School of Chemistry, Tel-Aviv University). Methyl-(5-(2-theinyl-carbonyl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)carbamate (nocodazole) was from Sigma. AMP-PNP was from Sigma. Protein A-Sepharose beads were from Pierce. Affinity-purified rabbit anti-γ-adaptin was used at a 1:100 dilution for immunofluorescence. Antibodies directed against the µ1 and ς1 adaptor subunits were used as previously described (13Orzech E. Schlessinger K. Weiss A. Okamoto C.T. Aroeti B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 274: 2201-2215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Mouse anti-γ-adaptin monoclonal antibodies, clone 100/3, were purchased from Sigma. These antibodies were used at 1:250 dilution for immunofluorescence (IF) and at 1:1000 dilution for Western blotting (WB). Mouse polyclonal antibodies directed against mouse-γ-adaptin proline/glycine-rich hinge domain were from Transduction Laboratories. In experiments in which γ-adaptin was overexpressed in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, the overexpressed subunit could be exclusively labeled with these antibodies if used at a 1:100 dilution for IF, or at 1:5000 for WB. Rabbit anti-TGN38 has been used for IF as described (14Orzech E. Cohen S. Weiss A. Aroeti B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15207-15219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies anti-α-tubulin (clone B-5-1-2) from Sigma were used at 1:100 and 1:1000 dilution for IF and WB, respectively. Mouse monoclonal antibodies immunospecific for MAP1a (clone HM-1), which react with the mouse and rat proteins, were from Sigma. Mouse monclonal 100/2 directed against α-adaptin was from Sigma and used at 1:100 dilution for immunoblotting. Mouse monoclonal anti-tau (15Binder L.I. Frankfurter A. Rebhun L.I. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 1371-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar) was used at 1:1000 dilution for WB. Mouse monoclonal anti-p58 antibodies were from Sigma and used at 1:100 for IF. The rat monoclonal anti-yeast tubulin, clone YL1/2 (1:400 for IF), was obtained from Dr. M. Brandeis (Hebrew University, Israel). Purified mouse IgG1 was from Sigma. Secondary antibodies labeled with horseradish peroxidase or with fluorescent probes were from Jackson ImmunoResearch. Protease inhibitors were fromRoche Molecular Biochemicals or Sigma. MDCK cells were cultured on plastic dishes or coverslips as previously described (16Aroeti B. Kosen P.A. Kuntz I.D. Cohen F.E. Mostov K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1149-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The embryonic carcinoma cell line, P19, was obtained from Dr. M. Linial (Hebrew University, Israel). Cells were cultured and differentiated as described (17Parnas D. Linial M. Int. J. Dev. Neurosci. 1995; 13: 767-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Tubulin was purified from bovine brain with four cycles of polymerization-depolymerization followed by chromatography on phosphocellulose P11 column, essentially as described by Williams (18Williams R.C. Carraway K.L. Carraway C.A.C. The Cytoskeleton: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1992: 151-166Google Scholar). The purified MAP-free monomeric tubulin (MFT, ∼4 mg/ml) was aliquoted, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. MAPs were eluted from the P11 column with 1 m KCl and concentrated through Centricon to yield a protein concentration of 2 mg/ml. The concentrated MAP fraction was aliquoted, snap-frozen in liquid N2, and stored at −80 °C. For the in vitro co-sedimentation assay, an aliquot of 4 mg of monomeric tubulin was polymerized at 37 °C for 30 min in PEM (100 mm K-Pipes, pH 6.8, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA) containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm Mg-GTP, 1 mm Mg-ATP, and 20 µmTaxol. The polymerized tubulin was centrifuged twice (55,000 rpm TLS rotor, 30 min 22 °C) through a 10% sucrose cushion containing 20 µm Taxol. The pellet was gently resuspended in PEM-containing Taxol to yield a 3 mg/ml protein concentration. Aliquots were snap-frozen and stored at −80 °C. MDCK monolayers grown on plastic plates were washed three times with MEM/BSA (MEM containing 0.25 g/liter NaHCO3, 0.6% BSA, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4), and actin filaments were depolymerized by incubating the cells in MEM/BSA supplemented with 5 µm latrunculin A for 60 min at 37 °C. The latrunculin A stock solution (10 mm in Me2SO) was stored at −20 °C. MTs were depolymerized by incubating MDCK cells for 30 min at 4 °C in MEM/BSA, followed by a 60-min incubation in MEM/BSA supplemented with 33 µm nocodazole for 60 min at 4 °C and subsequent treatment for 60 min with the drug added in warm (37 °C) MEM/BSA. The nocodazole stock solution (33 mm in Me2SO) was stored at −20 °C. Cells were fixed for 10 min in methanol at −20 °C or fixed with paraformaldehyde according to the pH shift fixation procedure (19Apodaca G. Katz L.A. Mostov K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 67-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) and processed for immunofluorescence as previously described (13Orzech E. Schlessinger K. Weiss A. Okamoto C.T. Aroeti B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 274: 2201-2215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (40) Google Scholar). When staining with rhodamine-phalloidin, cells were fixed by the paraformaldehyde pH shift method and then stained in PBS with 5 units/ml rhodamine phalloidin (stock solution stored as 200 units/ml in methanol at −20 °C) for 30 min at 22 °C. Cells were washed three times for 5 min with PBS, postfixed, mounted, and stored as described (19Apodaca G. Katz L.A. Mostov K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 67-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). A Bio-Rad MRC-1024 confocal scanhead coupled to a Zeiss Axiovert 135M inverted microscope fitted with × 40 or × 63 oil immersion lenses was used to acquire images of the stained cells as described (13Orzech E. Schlessinger K. Weiss A. Okamoto C.T. Aroeti B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 274: 2201-2215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Images (512 × 512 pixels) were saved in tag information file format, and contrast levels of each image were adjusted in the Photoshop program (Adobe, Mountain View, CA). Contrast-corrected images were imported into Freehand (Macromedia, San Francisco, CA). AP-1 and AP-2 complexes were isolated from CCVs obtained from 150 bovine adrenal glands using gel filtration chromatography (65 × 1.6 cm Sephacryl S300 HR columns; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and AP-1 was further purified from AP-2 by hydroxyapatite (1-ml Econo-Pac HTP cartridge; Bio-Rad) chromatography. The absence of AP-2 in AP-1-containing samples was confirmed by immunoblotting, using the 100/2 antibodies. Both purification steps were performed by fast protein liquid chromatography (Amersham Pharmacia BiotechEktaExplorer), following previously established protocols (20Manfredi J.J. Bazari W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1218-12188PubMed Google Scholar). Samples containing purified AP-1 (1 mg/ml) were snap-frozen and stored at −80 °C. The MT binding activity of cytosolic AP-1, or of AP-1 purified from CCVs, was examined by the MT cosedimentation assay. For each experiment, fresh cytosol was prepared from confluent MDCK monolayers cultured for 3 days on three 10-cm plates. Cytosol extraction was performed at 4 °C using ice-cold and freshly prepared buffers. Cells were washed three times with 10 ml of PBS, pH 7.4, and once with 10 ml of PMEE buffer (PEM buffer containing 0.5 mm EGTA) supplemented with 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, a mixture of protease inhibitors (25 µg/ml pepstatin, 50 µg/ml chymostatin, 25 µg/ml leupeptin, 50 µg/ml antipain, 2.5 µg/ml aprotinin), and 250 mmsucrose (PMEE/sucrose). Buffer was aspirated, leaving cell monolayers as dry as possible. 0.3 ml of PMEE/sucrose buffer was added to each plate, and cells were scraped off the dish by a rubber policeman. Cell suspensions from each plate were combined into a single Eppendorf tube, and cells were then broken by 10 passages through a 21-gauge needle followed by 10 passages through a 25-gauge needle connected to a 1-ml syringe. Homogenate was ultracentrifuged (60,000 rpm, TLA120.2 rotor; 45 min at 4 °C). The supernatant (cytosol) was separated from the membrane pellet and kept on ice. Rat liver and rat brain cytosol were prepared from 10–15 3½-month-old Sabra rats, as described (21Apodaca G. Cardone M.H. Whiteheart S.W. DasGupta B.R. Mostov K.E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1471-1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To prepare mitotic cytosol, a suspension of mitotic cells (see below) was spun, and cell pellet was suspended in an equal volume of PMEE/sucrose buffer. Cytosol depleted of endogenous tubulin was prepared as follows. Cytosol was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 1 mm Mg-GTP and 20 µm Taxol final concentrations. Cytosol was then centrifuged (60,000 TLA120.2 rotor; 15 min at 22 °C), and supernatant (tubulin-depleted cytosol) was carefully transferred to a fresh Eppendorf tube. In some experiments, MDCK cytosol was depleted of ATP by incubation with 10 mg/ml glucose and 2 units of hexokinase (type C-130; Sigma) for 15 min at 22 °C, or cytosol was supplemented with 2 mm AMP-PNP. Cytosol free of endogenous tubulin (100 µg/ml final concentration) or purified AP-1 (125 µg/ml final concentration) was first centrifuged (30,000 rpm, 15 min, 22 °C, Ti-42.2 Backman rotor) to pellet protein aggregates. Cytosol was incubated with Taxol-stabilized polymeric tubulin (9 µm) assembled from either MCT or MFT for 30 min at 22 or 37 °C, as indicated under “Results.” Similarly, AP-1 purified from CCVs was incubated with MAP-free polymeric tubulin, in the absence or presence of MAPs (100 µg/ml final concentration). The final volume of the reaction mixture was 40 µl. The reaction mixture was centrifuged for 30 min (20,000 rpm, Ti-42.2 Beckman rotor, 22 °C). Following centrifugation, γ-adaptin associated with polymeric tubulin was in the pellet, whereas γ-adaptin that does not interact with polymeric tubulin remains in the cytosol supernatant. The entire supernatant (unless otherwise stated) and pellet were solubilized in 2× sample buffer (1× sample buffer: 15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 25 mm EDTA, pH 7.0, 0.25% urea mixed with bromphenol blue, 6% (v/v) glycerol, 65 mm dithiothreitol) and analyzed for the presence of γ-adaptin by SDS-PAGE followed by WB (13Orzech E. Schlessinger K. Weiss A. Okamoto C.T. Aroeti B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 274: 2201-2215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Anti-α-tubulin (Sigma) or irrelevant mouse IgG1 antibodies (Sigma) were covalently coupled to protein A-Sepharose using dimethylpimelimidate as previously described (16Aroeti B. Kosen P.A. Kuntz I.D. Cohen F.E. Mostov K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1149-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Freshly prepared MDCK cytosol was supplemented with 5 mm Mg-ATP and then precleared by its incubation for 4 h at 4 °C with 250 µl of plain protein A-Sepharose. After spinning down the beads, the cleared cytosol was transferred to an Eppendorf tube containing 50 µl of plain protein A-Sepharose, protein A-Sepharose coupled to IgG, or protein A-Sepharose coupled to anti-tubulin. The cytosol was incubated with the beads for 15 h at 4 °C. Beads were then washed six times with cold PEM buffer, and proteins were released by boiling the beads in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The presence of tubulin and γ-adaptin in the immunoprecipitates was detected by immunoblotting. A 2-µl aliquot of monoclonal anti-MAP1a (clone HM1, Sigma) and of irrelevant mouse IgG1 antibodies (Sigma) were diluted into 0.5 ml of PEM buffer, incubated with protein A-Sepharose (100 µl, 15% slurry; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 15–17 h at 4 °C with rotation, and subsequently covalently attached to the beads by dimethylpimelimidate. Antibody-coupled beads were washed four times with PEM buffer supplemented with 0.1% Nonidet P-40 (PEM/Nonidet P-40). Brain rat cytosol was thawed, supplemented with protease inhibitors, and spun for 15 min at 4 °C (15,000 ×g) to eliminate large protein aggregates. The cytosol was then diluted with buffer PEM/Nonidet P-40 to yield 2 mg/ml protein concentration. Antibody-coupled beads were incubated with 0.5 ml of cytosol for 15–17 h at 4 °C with continuous end-to-end rotation. Immunobeads were then washed six times with buffer PEM/Nonidet P-40 and one time with buffer PEM, dried, mixed with 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and boiled for 3 min to release the bound material. For MAP1a detection, half of the sample buffer volume was subjected to SDS-PAGE using 7% polyacrylamide gel; for γ-adaptin detection, the rest of the sample was analyzed by 10% gels. MAP1a immunoprecipitates were transferred to nitrocellulose sheets using the Bio-Rad Mini Trans-Blot® wet electrophoretic transfer cell apparatus (240 mA, 2 h). The γ-adaptin immunoprecipitates were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using the Hoefer semidry apparatus as previously described. Nitrocellulose sheets were blocked and probed with anti-MAP1a antibody (1:500) or with anti-γ-adaptin antibodies (1:1000; Transduction Laboratories). Confluent MDCK monolayers cultured on 10-cm plates were split 1:10. After 16 h, cells were trypsinized, and 4 × 105 cells were seeded on a 10 cm dish. Cells were allowed to settle on the plate for an additional 6 h. Then 0.33 µm nocodazole was added to the growth medium, and cells were incubated in the presence of nocodazole for about 11 h at 37 °C in CO2 incubator. Mitotic cells, typically arrested in prometaphase, were collected by the mitotic shake-off procedure, as described (22Brandeis M. Hunt T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5280-5289Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). For immunofluorescence, harvested mitotic cells were gently placed on top of a coverslip precoated with a 50% solution of polylysine (Sigma). Tight attachment to the coverslip was promoted by brief centrifugation. The mouse γ-adaptin cDNA was subcloned in the sense direction into theBamHI sites of the pADtet vector containing the regulated tetracycline promotor. Adenoviruses were produced as described (23Hardy S. Kitamura M. Harris-Stansil T. Dai Y. Phipps M.L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1842-1849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MDCK cells (T23 clone, which constitutively expresses thetrans-activator of the tet system) were seeded at confluence 4 days prior the assay on 12-mm Transwell™ (Costar). 18 h before the assay, cells were infected at their apical side for 2 h with 5 µl of the γ-adaptin virus stock, corresponding to ∼40 plaque-forming units/cell in PBS containing 1 mmMgCl2 but lacking CaCl2. Cells were washed twice with PBS containing 1 mm MgCl2. Expression of γ-adaptin was induced by incubating the cells for a further 16 h in MEM containing Earle's balanced salt solution supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, in 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C and humidified atmosphere. Expression was suppressed by incubating the infected cells for 16 h in medium containing 20 ng/ml doxycycline (Dox; Sigma). The Dox stock solution (1 mg/ml in H2O, stored at −80 °C) was diluted to the indicated concentration just before use. Using this method, 95–100% of the filter-cultured T23 cells expressed the γ-adaptin, as judged by immunofluorescence analysis. MDCK cell monolayers were treated with nocodazole, immunostained with anti-γ-adaptin antibodies, and prepared for immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. Nocodazole treatment disrupts the typical perinuclear staining of γ-adaptin (Fig. 1 A, compareNocodazole with Control). The transmembrane TGN marker, TGN38, was also dispersed in the cell cytoplasm in nocodazole-treated cells (Fig. 1 A). Note that some γ-adaptin staining remained at supranuclear regions (indicated byarrows), suggesting the existence of a γ-adaptin population that is resistant to nocodazole treatment. In these regions, AP-1 may interact with nocodazole-insensitive cytoskeletal elements. Following nocodazole removal, the majority of γ-adaptin and TGN38 reappeared at the perinuclear (original) location (not shown), indicating that the effects of nocodazole treatment are reversible. Cell treatment with the actin-disrupting agent, latrunculin A, did not affect the intracellular distribution of γ-adaptin (data not shown). It is possible that Golgi disruption by nocodazole is the mere cause for γ-adaptin dispersal in nocodazole-treated cells, regardless of whether AP-1 is attached to MTs or not (24Holleran E.A. Holzbaur E.L. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 26-29Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 25Lane J. Allan V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1376: 27-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Another possibility, however, is that AP-1 links the organelle to MTs, and MT disruption by nocodazole results in a concomitant dispersion of AP-1-coated organelles. Our next aim was to determine whether AP-1 co-localizes with microtubular arrays. To investigate this, γ-adaptin and tubulin in MDCK cells and differentiated P19 neuronal cells were fluorescently immunolabeled (in green and red, respectively), and their respective intracellular distribution was analyzed by confocal microscopy. High magnification images of single MDCK cells (Fig. 1 B, upper panel) reveal two populations of γ-adaptin-labeled structures. A small fraction of γ-adaptin-labeled organelles appeared mainly as linear tracks of punctate/vesicular staining, coinciding with MTs (indicated byarrows in the merge panel). These structures may represent γ-adaptin-coated vesicles associated with MTs. The majority of γ-adaptin labeling, although seen in regional proximity with microtubular networks, did not co-localize with MTs. Interestingly, γ-adaptin-coated organelles were also seen in tubulin-rich axonal regions in P19 cells (Fig.1 B , lower panel, structures indicated by arrows). These morphological observations suggest that some AP-1 adaptor-coated organelles and perhaps cytosolic AP-1 exist in regional proximity with MTs. To further assess the possible interactions between AP-1 and MTs, the ability of γ-adaptin to co-immunoprecipitate with tubulin fr"

The enzymes share a conserved catalytic core.

PHMs produced as part of DBMsignal/PHMs was active.In vitro translated and cellular DBMsignal/PHMs had similar masses, indicating that the DBM signal was not removed.

After in vitro translation in the presence of microsomal membranes, trypsin treatment removed 2 kDa from DBMsignal/PHMs while PHMs was entirely protected. In addition, a Cys residue in DBMsignal/PHMs was accessible to Cys-directed biotinylation. Thus the chimera adopts the topology of a type II membrane protein. Pulse-chase experiments indicate that DBMsignal/PHMs turns over rapidly after exiting the trans-Golgi network. Although PHMs is efficiently localized to secretory granules, DBMsignal/PHMs is largely localized to the endoplasmic reticulum in AtT-20 cells. On the basis of stimulated secretion, the small amount of PHMs generated is stored in secretory granules. In contrast, the expression of DBMsignal/PHMs in PC12 cells yields protein that is localized to secretory granules.

On the basis of stimulated secretion, the small amount of PHMs generated is stored in secretory granules. In contrast, the expression of DBMsignal/PHMs in PC12 cells yields protein that is localized to secretory granules. dopamine β-monooxygenase peptidylglycine α-hydroxylating monooxygenase soluble PHM Chinese hamster ovary peptidylglycine α-amidating monooxygenase complete serum-free medium 2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acid polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis trans-Golgi network Catecholamine synthesis from tyrosine involves several cytosolic enzymes and one secretory granule enzyme, dopamine β-monooxygenase (DBM)1 (1Stewart L.C.

DBM monomers form tetramers composed of two noncovalently bound disulfide-linked dimers (6Sabban E.L. Greene L.A. Goldstein M. J. Biol.

Sequence analysis of membrane DBM from bovine adrenal medulla revealed an uncleaved signal sequence in 30% of the protein (11Taljanidisz J. Stewart L. Smith A.J. Klinman J.P. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 10054-10061Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Similarly, sequence analysis of rat DBM produced by in vitrotranscription/translation in the presence of microsomal membranes indicated that the signal sequence was not removed (12Feng Z. Angeletti R.H. Levin B.E. Sabban E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21808-21815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These studies suggest that DBM is a type II integral membrane protein. The NH2-terminal sequences of rat, mouse, human, and bovine DBM vary in length, but each contains a stretch of 20 hydrophobic amino acids, which is longer than the hydrophobic domains typically found in cleaved signal sequences (13Parks G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7187-7195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 14Kendall D.A. Bock S.C. Kaiser E.T. Nature. 1986; 321: 706-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Although rat and mouse DBM also contain a lengthy stretch of amino acids preceding the hydrophobic domain, human and bovine DBM do not. However, analysis of the genomic sequence encoding human DBM (15Lamouroux A. Vigny A. Faucon B.N. Darmon M.C. Franck R. Henry J.P. Mallet J.

With this modification, the similarity of human to mouse and rat DBM is increased greatly. Additional sequence data for the 5′ end of bovine DBM are not available (19Lewis E.J. Allison S. Fader D.

Because DBM is a large tetrameric glycoprotein, it has proven difficult to evaluate the role of the DBM signal/anchor sequence in the context of the native protein. To analyze the routing information in the DBM signal/anchor, we appended it to the monooxygenase domain of a homologous enzyme. Peptidylglycine α-hydroxylating monooxygenase (PHM) catalyzes the first step of the two-step conversion of peptidylglycine substrates into α-amidated products. The reactions catalyzed by DBM and PHM both require copper, ascorbate, and molecular oxygen (22Eipper B.A. Milgram S.L. Husten E.J. Yun H.Y. Mains R.E.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 366: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and the catalytic core of PHM shares 32% identity with a 296-amino acid region of DBM (26Ouafik L.H. Mattei M.G. Giraud P.

We selected PHM as our reporter protein because it is homologous to DBM in sequence, has the same cofactor requirements, can be assayed easily, is substantially smaller than DBM, and is not glycosylated. In the DBMsignal/PHMs chimera, the signal sequence of PAM was replaced with residues 1–42 of rat DBM, and a translational stop was inserted after the PHMs domain (Fig. 1 B). The metabolism of PHMs has been characterized in detail. In Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, PHMs yields a protein of 39 kDa that retains its pro-region, whereas in AtT-20 cells the pro-region is removed yielding a 38-kDa protein that is stored efficiently in secretory granules and released in response to secretagogue (Fig. 1 B) (29Tausk F.A. Milgram S.L. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 2185-2196PubMed Google Scholar, 30Mains R.E. Milgram S.L. Keutmann H.T. Eipper B.A. Mol.

Outside of the catalytic core, the sequences of PAM, the bifunctional protein that contains both PHM and peptidyl α-hydroxy-glycine α-amidating lyase, and DBM diverge, and their topologies differ. PAM is a type I integral membrane protein and does not form disulfide-linked dimers. Tissue-specific alternative splicing produces integral membrane and soluble forms of PAM (32Eipper B.A. Green C.B. Campbell T.A. Stoffers D.A. Keutmann H.T. Mains R.E. Ouafik L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4008-4015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and endoproteolysis generates soluble PHM and peptidyl α-hydroxy-glycine α-amidating lyase from membrane PAM (31Milgram S.L. Johnson R.C. Mains R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 717-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). DBMsignal/PHMs was expressed in AtT-20 corticotrope tumor cells and PC12 pheochromocytoma cells, which contain secretory granules, and in CHO cells, which do not; although PC12 cells produce DBM, AtT-20 cells do not. We monitored PHM activity to evaluate folding of the chimeric protein. The presence or absence of the DBM signal sequence was assessed through changes in mass. In vitrotranscription/translation was used to demonstrate exposure of the NH2 terminus of DBM to cytosol. Metabolic labeling of stably transfected AtT-20 and CHO cell lines demonstrated rapid turnover and limited secretion of DBMsignal/PHMs. DBMsignal/PHMs adopts the topology of a type II membrane protein and is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum in AtT-20 and CHO cells. Although folded into a catalytically active conformation, the PHMs sequence does not localize the chimera to AtT-20 secretory granules. In contrast, DBMsignal/PHMs expressed transiently in PC12 cells was localized to secretory granules. To generate DBMsignal/PHMs, the gene splicing-by-overlap-extension (SOE) technique was employed (33Horton R.M. Cai Z.L. Ho S.N. Pease L.R. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 528-535PubMed Google Scholar). cDNA fragments were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using as templates the pBluescript plasmids carrying the cDNAs for PHMs (rPAM-1 (nucleotides 1–1444)) and DBM (rDBM (nucleotides 1–2445)), kindly provided by Dr. E. Sabban (Medical College of New York, Valhalla, NY) (12Feng Z. Angeletti R.H. Levin B.E. Sabban E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21808-21815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cDNA fragment encoding the DBM signal sequence (42 amino acids) was spliced onto the cDNA encoding rat PHM (26) to generate the DBMsignal/PHMs chimera. The sequence at the splice junction was verified to encodeAVAIFLVILVAALQGFRSPLSVFKRFLETTR, where the DBM signal sequence is shown in bold. The DBMsignal/PHMs cDNA was inserted into a pCIS.2CXXNH expression vector using complementary restriction sites. Construction of the pBluescript plasmid encoding PHMs (pBS.PHMs) was described previously (31Milgram S.L. Johnson R.C. Mains R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 717-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). AtT-20 and CHO cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/F-12 medium containing 10% fetal clone serum (HyClone, Logan, UT) and 10% Nu-Serum (Collaborative Research, Bedford, MA). Stable AtT-20 cell lines were established by co-transfecting the pCIS expression vector and pMT.Neo (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.), followed by drug selection with G418 (0.5 mg/ml) (31Milgram S.L. Johnson R.C. Mains R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 717-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Stable CHO cell lines were generated using Lipofectin and selected in α-minimum Eagle's medium containing 20% dialyzed fetal calf serum. Cell lines expressing DBMsignal/PHMs were screened by enzyme assay, immunofluorescence, and Western blot analysis. In addition, DBMsignal/PHMs and rat DBM (34Oyarce A.M. Eipper B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3270-3278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) were transiently expressed in rat PC12 pheochromocytoma cells using GenPORTER 2 (GTS, San Diego, CA). PC12 cells grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/F-12 medium containing 10% fetal clone serum and 10% Nu-Serum were plated on 25-mm culture dishes and transfected with 4 µg of DNA/well. After a 6-h incubation with the DNA in CSFM, the cells were plated on chamber slides precoated with 0.1 mg/ml poly-l-lysine and examined 48 h after initial exposure to DNA using immunofluorescence microscopy as described below. To study the biosynthesis of the DBMsignal/PHMs chimera, pulse-chase experiments were performed as described previously (34Oyarce A.M. Eipper B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3270-3278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 35Milgram S.L. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 23-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells plated on 12-mm culture dishes coated with 0.1 mg/ml poly-l-lysine were labeled for 20 min with 300 µCi of [35S]methionine (1 mCi/ml, 1000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 300 µl of methionine-free CSFM air. Cells were either extracted (pulse) in 20 mm sodium TES, 10 mm mannitol, pH 7.0, and 1% TX-100 containing protease inhibitors (31Milgram S.L. Johnson R.C. Mains R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 717-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) or further incubated for varying periods of time (chase) in CSFM air. The CSFM air contained 20 mm sodium HEPES, pH 7.4, instead of NaHCO3. For temperature block experiments, the cells were labeled at 37 °C for 20 min and then chased at 20 or 37 °C for 2 h. Immunoprecipitation of cell extracts and media was carried out using Ab1761 directed against the PHM domain (rPAM-1-(37–382)). The immunocomplexes were isolated by incubation with protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) (35Milgram S.L. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 23-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by fluorography. pBluescript plasmid containing cDNA encoding DBMsignal/PHMs was used as template forin vitro coupled transcription/translation (TNT) and translocation using rabbit reticulocyte lysate and canine pancreas microsomal membranes as specified by the supplier (Promega, Madison, WI). Unless otherwise indicated, 1.3 equivalents of canine pancreas microsomal membranes were added to 50 µl of translation reaction. The pBluescript plasmid containing cDNA encoding PHMs was used for comparison. In vitro synthesized proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography (36Oyarce A.M. Hand T.A. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). DBMsignal/PHMs synthesized in vitro in the presence or absence of microsomal membranes was studied using a trypsin protection assay and biotinylation (37Yun H.Y. Johnson R.C. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 301: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 38Blobel G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1976; 68: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). PHMs was used as a control. Briefly, the translation reaction was stopped by adding 1 µl of cycloheximide (100 µg/ml) to 15 µl of the in vitro translation reaction. The membranes were stabilized by incubation with 1 µl of 30 mmtetracaine-HCl (39Scheele G. Jacoby R. Carne T. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 87: 611-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) for 5 min at room temperature followed by cooling on ice. Samples were digested with 5 µg of trypsin (Fluka) for 30 min at 37 °C, and digestion was stopped by boiling in 10 mmsodium phosphate, pH 6.0, 0.1% SDS, and 10 mm2-mercaptoethanol. Where indicated, samples were digested in the presence of 0.1% Triton X-100 (Pierce). Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and fluorography (36Oyarce A.M. Hand T.A. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The in vitro translation reaction (15 µl) containing DBMsignal/PHMs protein was diluted to 50 µl with PBS (pH 7.4) and incubated with 10 mm N-biotinylaminoethyl methanethiosulfonate (Toronto Research Chemicals, Ontario, Canada) for 10 min at room temperature to label cysteine residues (40Chen J.G. Liu-Chen S. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12675-12681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The excess reagent was quenched by incubation with 50 mm NH4Cl for 10 min at room temperature. The reaction mixture was diluted with 500 µl of 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4/1% TX-100 (Super E), and the biotinylated proteins were isolated by incubation with immobilized NeutrAvidin (Pierce) for 30 min at room temperature. The NeutrAvidin beads were washed with Super E and 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and protein eluted by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. PHM activity was measured using 0.5 µm α-N-acetyl-Tyr-Val-Gly,125I-α-N-acetyl-Tyr-Val-Gly at pH 5.0 in the presence of 0.5 µm CuSO4, 0.5 mm ascorbate, and 0.18 mg/ml catalase (41Husten E.J. Eipper B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17004-17010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples of cell extracts, media, and subcellular fractions were fractionated on 12% polyacrylamide, 0.25%N,N′-methylene-bis-acrylamide/SDS gels (42Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as described previously (41Husten E.J. Eipper B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17004-17010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The membranes were blocked and then incubated in PHM antibody (Ab1761) at 4 °C overnight (35Milgram S.L. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 23-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 43Oyarce A.M. Eipper B.A. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 287-297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The proteins were detected using the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cells grown on chamber slides precoated with 0.1 mg/ml poly l-lysine were rinsed with PBS and fixed in ice-cold methanol for 15 min. After fixation, the slides were blocked and stained with primary antibody against the PHM domain (Ab1761) for 4 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. PHM antibody 1761 was diluted 1:1000 in PBS containing 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. A fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G was used as a secondary antibody at a dilution of 1:1000. The distribution of fluorescence was analyzed with a Zeiss (Thornwood, MT) Axioskop epifluorescence microscope using a fluorescein isothiocyanate filter set. DBMsignal/PHMs was expressed in AtT-20 cells, which contain secretory granules, and in CHO cells, which do not. DBMsignal/PHMs in the stably transfected cells was analyzed by enzyme assay and Western blot. The soluble PHMs protein expressed in AtT-20 cells was analyzed for comparison. From both cell types, aliquots of cell extract containing an equal amount of PHM activity were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 2A, similar amounts of DBMsignal/PHMs protein and PHMs protein yielded 150 pmol/h of PHM activity. This result indicates that the chimera folds properly when expressed in either cell type and is as active as the control PHMs protein. Interestingly, the DBMsignal/PHMs protein (43 kDa) has a substantially greater apparent molecular mass than PHMs (38 kDa). DBMsignal/PHMs produced by in vitro transcription/translation in the absence of microsomal membranes (Fig. 2 B), conditions that do not allow cleavage of signal sequences, also has a mass of 43 kDa. The predicted molecular mass for the chimera in the absence of signal peptide cleavage is 43 kDa. PHMs produced by in vitrotranslation has a mass of 41 kDa as predicted in the absence of signal peptide cleavage and greater than the mass of the cellular product. These data suggest that most of the DBMsignal/PHMs chimera in cell extracts retains the DBM signal sequence. To further investigate the properties of the DBMsignal/PHMs chimera, subcellular fractionation was carried out. Stably transfected cells expressing DBMsignal/PHMs or PHMs were separated into soluble and membrane fractions and analyzed by Western blot using the PHM antibody. As shown in Fig. 3, DBMsignal/PHMs was found only in the membrane fraction in both cell types; no DBMsignal/PHMs was recovered in the soluble fraction. In contrast, PHMs was recovered in both the soluble and membrane fractions. The association of monofunctional PHM with membranes is characteristic of the protein and was observed in secretory granules from rat hypothalamus and hippocampus (43Oyarce A.M. Eipper B.A. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 287-297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The association of the DBMsignal/PHMs protein with membranes was investigated by incubating membranes with sodium carbonate, pH 11.5, for 30 min to dissociate peripheral proteins (Fig. 3). After carbonate treatment, all of the DBMsignal/PHMs from both cell types remained in the membrane fraction, indicating that the chimera is an intrinsic membrane protein. As expected for a protein lacking a transmembrane domain, all the PHMs recovered in the membrane fraction was removed by carbonate treatment. Taken together, these data demonstrate retention of the DBM signal sequence, yielding an integral membrane chimeric protein. Metabolic labeling was carried out to study the biosynthesis, storage, and secretion of DBMsignal/PHMs in AtT-20 cells and CHO cells. AtT-20 PHMs cells were analyzed for comparison. DBMsignal/PHMs and PHMs were immunoprecipitated from cell extracts and culture medium, fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and detected by fluorography. After a pulse incubation, a single 43-kDa form of DBMsignal/PHMs was detected in both cell types (Fig. 4A); the newly synthesized protein was identical in size to the chimeric protein observed on Western blots and to the in vitro translation product. After 30 min of chase, essentially all the newly synthesized DBMsignal/PHMs protein was recovered and its mass was unaltered, indicating that the DBM signal sequence had not been removed. A dramatic loss of newly synthesized protein occurred at longer chase times. As shown in Fig. 4 B, 26% of the newly synthesized DBMsignal/PHMs is retained in AtT-20 cells after the 2-h chase, and almost all the chimera is lost during the 6-h chase. Interestingly, the loss of DBMsignal/PHMs is less dramatic in CHO cells, with 15% of the protein remaining after the 6-h chase. The radiolabeled product observed in CHO cells after the 6-h chase still had a mass of 43 kDa. In contrast and as expected (31Milgram S.L. Johnson R.C. Mains R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 717-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 44Milgram S.L. Eipper B.A. Mains R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), PHMs, which had a mass of 40 kDa after the pulse incubation, matured into a 38-kDa protein upon removal of the pro-region; this cleavage was completed between 30 min and 2 h of chase. Spent media were examined to evaluate secretion of newly synthesized protein. Secretion of a 38-kDa protein from AtT-20 cells expressing PHMs was readily detectable at 2 h of chase, and all the newly synthesized PHMs was recovered in cells or medium after a 6-h chase. In contrast, the loss of newly synthesized protein from cells expressing the DBMsignal/PHMs chimera was not accounted for by secretion. Secretion of a small amount of 38-kDa PHMs by CHO cells was detectable after 2 h. Secretion from AtT-20 cells expressing DBMsignal/PHMs was barely detectable even after 6 h (Fig. 4, inset). A 43-kDa protein was also detected in the medium of AtT-20 DBMsignal/PHMs cells (Fig. 4, inset). Newly synthesized misfolded proteins are known to undergo rapid degradation (45Schubert U. Anton L.C. Gibbs J. Norbury C.C. Yewdell J.W. Bennink J.R. Nature. 2000; 404: 770-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar, 46Murakami Y. Matsufuji S. Hayashi S. Tanahashi N. Tanaka K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 267: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 47Wikstrom L. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 48Stafford F.J. Bonifacino J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1225-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, because fully active PHM was observed in cells expressing DBMsignal/PHMs, this type of rapid degradation was not anticipated. The DBMsignal/PHMs chimera presents an acceptable signal peptide cleavage site and contains little sequence outside of the PHM catalytic core that could be misfolded and thus target the chimera for degradation. To determine the site of degradation, temperature-block experiments were performed. AtT-20 DBMsignal/PHMs cells were incubated with [35S]methionine at 37 °C for 20 min and chased for 2 h at 20 or 37 °C before extraction. Incubation at 20 °C blocks the exit of proteins from the TGN (49Chanat E. Huttner W.B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1505-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 50Mellman I. Simons K. Cell. 1992; 68: 829-840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5A, substantially more DBMsignal/PHMs remained in cells chased at 20 °C than in the cells chased at 37 °C. In a similar experiment with CHO cells, the degradation of DBMsignal/PHMs was substantially diminished when the chase temperature was 20 instead of 37 °C (Fig. 5 B). To further analyze the site at which DBMsignal/PHMs was degraded in AtT-20 cells, we added a variety of protease inhibitors (10 µg/ml leupeptin, 100 µg/mlN-acetyl-leucinyl-leucinyl-norleucinal, 5 mm methylamine/NH4Cl, 100 µmchloroquine, 5 µm MG132, and 20 µmlactacystin) during the chase incubation. Proteasome inhibitors MG132 and lactacystin produced a slight increase in recovery, whereas the other inhibitors were without effect (data not shown). No inhibition of degradation was observed after treatment with Brefeldin A (data not shown). Taking into account the effects of temperature and these pharmacological agents, degradation of DBMsignal/PHMs may occur in the endoplasmic reticulum and/or in a post-Golgi/TGN compartment. Our data indicate that the DBM signal is not efficiently removed from the DBMsignal/PHMs chimera in AtT-20 or CHO cells. To verify this conclusion and determine whether DBMsignal/PHMs has a cytosolic domain, we used in vitro transcription/translation with microsomal membranes. Whether the in vitro reaction was carried out in the presence or absence of microsomal membranes, a single 43-kDa protein was observed (Fig. 6). The identical sizes of products translated in the absence or presence of microsomal membranes is consistent with retention of the DBM signal. In contrast, translation of PHMs in the presence of microsomal membranes led to the synthesis of a smaller protein (38 kDa), indicating that cleavage of the signal sequence occurred. With the goal of analyzing translocation of DBMsignal/PHMs across the membrane, trypsin digestion of the translation product was carried out in the presence of intact microsomal membranes or after detergent permeabilization. Trypsin treatment of DBMsignal/PHMs translated in the presence of intact microsomal membranes decreased the molecular mass of the product by ∼2 kDa (Fig. 6). Thus a segment of DBMsignal/PHMs is exposed to the cytosol and susceptible to trypsin digestion. If DBMsignal/PHMs adopts the topology of a type II membrane protein, the residue Arg19 of DBM would provide a site for cleavage by trypsin (Fig. 6, lower panel). In contrast, PHMs was protected from tryp"

Several major types of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels have been identified that differ in their pharmacological and biophysical properties (1Bean B.P. Annu. Rev.

A revised classification scheme based on sequence, biophysical, and pharmacological properties has been proposed (5Ertel E.A. Campbell K.P. Harpold M.M. Hofmann F. Mori Y. Perez-Reyes E. Schwartz A.

L-type channels, which are sensitive to 1,4-dihydropyridine antagonists and activators, are distributed widely in the cardiovascular, central nervous, and neuroendocrine systems, and the Ca2+ channel antagonists active at these channels are cardiovascular drugs of clinical significance (6Triggle D.J. Epstein M. Calcium Antagonists in Clinical Medicine. 2nd Ed. Hanley and Belfus, Philadelphia, PA1998: 1-26Google Scholar). These channels represent an important category of pharmacological receptors with discrete drug binding sites. The binding sites have been characterized, and their localization on the major α1subunit has been well established (7Hockerman G.H. Peterson B.Z. Johnson B.D. Catterall W.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

Activity-dependent regulation is a common regulatory mechanism in a variety of receptor systems including ion channels, and electrical activity plays an important role in the regulation of ion channels. Thus, in many receptors of the G protein category, persistent activation by agonist ligands causes down-regulation of the receptor through a process of receptor internalization that involves an initial reversible phase in which the receptor can be recycled back to the plasma membrane and a later irreversible phase in which the receptor is degraded through the lysosomal machinery (14Dargent B. Jullien F. Couraud F. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 407-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In a number of systems, the membrane potential as an activating signal regulates both the function and numbers of ion channels. The membrane potential exerts two distinct categories of control over voltage-gated ion channels including Ca2+ channels, both of which have the property of shutting down cellular Ca2+ influx that in excess is a pathological signal. Inactivation is a rapid event with a time scale of milliseconds, and down-regulation is a slower event with a time frame of seconds to minutes or hours. Inactivation has both voltage- and Ca2+-dependent mechanisms, and recovery is typically both rapid and complete after the removal of the depolarizing stimulus (15Zhang J.F. Ellinor P.T. Aldrich R.W. Tsien R.W. Nature. 1994; 372: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 16Imredy J.P. Yue D.T. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1301-1318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Voltage-gated Ca2+ channels are also subject to a slower and more persistent regulation by depolarizing stimuli. Thus, in PC-12 cells (17DeLorme E.M. McGee R. Brain Res. 1986; 397: 189-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 18DeLorme E.M. Rabe C.S. McGee R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1988; 244: 838-843PubMed Google Scholar) and chick retinal neurons (19Ferrante J. Triggle D.J. Rutledge A. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1991; 69: 914-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) that contain L-type Ca2+ channels, chronic depolarization with elevated extracellular K+ down-regulates the channel density measured by 1,4-dihydropyridine binding and channel function measured by 45Ca2+ uptake measurement. In rat myenteric neurons, persistent depolarization causes a slowly developing long term reduction in sustained 1,4-dihydropyridine-sensitive calcium channel current (20Franklin J.L. Fickbohm D.J. Willard A.L. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 1726-1735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Membrane depolarization reduces both low and high voltage-activated Ca2+ currents in molluscan neurons (21Berdan R. Easaw J.C. Wang R. J. Neurophysiol. 1993; 69: 151-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In the neuroendocrine GH4C1 cells, short term depolarization (up to 2 h) with elevated K+ produces a decrease in L-type Ca2+ channel density measured by 1,4-dihydropyridine binding and a corresponding decrease in channel function as measured by 45Ca2+ uptake into these cells. This decrease in the binding site density is ac-companied with an increase in affinity for the ligand as anticipated from voltage-dependent binding (22Liu J. Bangalore R. Rutledge A. Triggle D.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 1198-1206PubMed Google Scholar). This work was designed to extend our previous study by characterizing electrophysiologically the short term regulation of L-type Ca2+ channels in GH4C1 cells by membrane depolarization. This cell line has a high density and a relatively pure population of Ca2+ channels of the T- and L-types (23Armstrong C.M. Matteson D.R. Science. 1985; 227: 65-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 24Matteson D.R. Armstrong C.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1986; 87: 161-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 25Dubinsky J.M.

(Lond.). 1987; 387: 195-225Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Cells of pituitary gland origin are chemically and electrically excitable, and the activation of L-type Ca2+ channels is involved in the regulation of persistent secretion induced by depolarization and hormones such as thyrotropin-releasing hormone (28Rosenthal W. Hescheler J. Hinsch K.D. Spicher K. Trautwein W. Schultz G. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1627-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 29Rosenthal W. Hescheler J. Trautwein W. Schultz G.

Tashjian Jr., A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 427-434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The activity and regulation of Ca2+ channels is physiologically important for maintaining a homeostasis of hormone secretion. Ca2+ influx into the cell subsequent to depolarization or hormonal response not only acts as a trigger for hormone release but also acts to inactivate the channels and prevent their sustained activation. This is analogous to the hormone-induced desensitization of receptors (32Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1996; 51: 319-351PubMed Google Scholar). F-10 medium and fetal bovine serum were purchased from Sigma. Horse serum was purchased from either Sigma or Life Technologies, Inc. ATP was purchased from Sigma. BAPTA-AM1 was purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Electrodes were pulled from thin-walled borosilicate glass capillaries with an outer diameter of 1.2 mm (TW-120, World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL). The pipettes were pulled in two stages on a vertical electrode puller (Model 750, David Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA) and had a resistance of 8–10 megohms when filled with internal recording solution. The rat anterior pituitary cell line, GH4C1, was obtained from Dr. Jane Chisholm (Bayer, Inc., West Haven, CT). Cells were maintained in a monolayer culture in Ham's F-10 medium supplemented with 15% horse serum and 2.5% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a humidified incubator under an atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Cells were removed from flasks once a week with 0.05% trypsin and were plated either into flasks or sterile 35-mm Petri dishes (Corning) for electrophysiology experiments. The medium was changed every 2 days. Cells that were in culture for 2–6 days were used for experiments. Normal Tyrode's solution contained 132 mm NaCl, 5.8 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2·6H2O, 2 mmCaCl2·2H2O, 10 mm HEPES, and 5 mm dextrose. The pH was adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH. Depolarizing Tyrode's solution contained 87 mm NaCl, 50 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2·6H2O, 2 mmCaCl2·2H2O, 10 mm HEPES, and 5 mm dextrose. The pH was adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH. External recording solution contained 125 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine, 5 mmCsCl, 10 mm HEPES, 1 mmMgCl2·6H2O, 5 mm dextrose, and 20 mm BaCl2. 105 ml of 1 nHCl/liter of solution was added. The pH was adjusted to 7.4 with CsOH. Internal recording solution contained 60 mm CsCl, 1 mmCaCl2·2H2O, 1 mmMgCl2·6H2O, 10 mm HEPES, 11 mm EGTA, 50 mm aspartic acid, and 5 mm Na2ATP. The pH was adjusted to 7.4 with CsOH. Whole cell voltage clamp experiments were carried out using an Axopatch 200 amplifier (Axon Instruments, Inc. Foster City, CA). Voltage commands were generated on a MacIntosh IIci computer through a 12-bit digital to analog converter using a MacADIOS II/16 board (GW Instruments, Somerville, MA). Data were acquired after 16-bit analog to digital conversion. Further analysis was performed with a program written in the laboratory by Dr. Satpal Singh in Think-C (Symantec Corporation, Cupertino, CA). Test currents were digitally sampled every 500 µs, except during the examination of capacitative currents, which were sampled every 100 µs. Currents were digitally corrected for linear leakage with respect to currents obtained at −60 mV from a holding potential of −40 mV. Current densities expressed as pA/pF were calculated by dividing the measured current with the cell capacitance to avoid the differences in current amplitude that arise because of the differences in cell size. Currents were filtered at 5 kHz with a Lowpass Bessel filter. All voltage clamp traces represent an average data from several different cells. To generate the current voltage profiles (I-V plots), current amplitudes at the peak current value were measured for each voltage command. All data are shown as mean values ± S.E. Cells were rinsed with 1 ml of 5.8 mm K+ buffer and incubated for the desired time interval in the appropriate buffer at 37 °C. At the end of the incubation, whole cell barium currents were elicited by step depolarizations to different potentials from a holding potential of −40 mV. T-type channels present in these cells inactivate by holding at −40 mV, and the L-type channels can then be studied selectively (27Cohen C.J. McCarthy R.T. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1987; 387: 195-225Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The current recorded under these experimental conditions is inhibited by 1,4-dihydropyridines, which are specific L-type calcium channel blockers, in our experiments (33Peri R. Padmanabhan S. Rutledge A. Singh S Triggle D.J. J. Med. Chem. 2000; 43: 2906-2914Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) done in parallel to the experiments reported here as well as in recordings made by several other groups (e.g.see Refs. 23Armstrong C.M. Matteson D.R. Science. 1985; 227: 65-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 24Matteson D.R. Armstrong C.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1986; 87: 161-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 25Dubinsky J.M. Oxford G.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1984; 83: 309-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 27Cohen C.J. McCarthy R.T. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1987; 387: 195-225Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Cells were continuously bathed in the appropriate Tyrode's solution until the whole cell configuration was achieved. Recording solution was locally applied to the cells by a gravity-driven perfusion system. Whole cell barium currents were recorded from a single cell in the dish. To avoid interference from a rundown of currents, the recordings were completed within 3–5 min of establishing the whole cell configuration unless otherwise specified. For clarity, only the currents to +10 mV have been shown in all the current traces. Capacitative currents settled rapidly within 2 ms in these cells. Hence, the first and the last 3 ms have been removed from the current traces to avoid interference from capacitative currents. GH4C1 cells express L-type calcium channels. The currents through these channels have been previously characterized both by whole cell and single channel experiments. To establish a base line for studying the calcium channel regulation, the cells were bathed in resting Tyrode's solution (5.8 mm K+) for up to 2 h at 37 °C after removing the culture medium. Barium currents were measured from the cells at the end of the incubation. The total barium current density measured after preincubation in Tyrode's solution at 37 °C remained within 85–90% of the amplitude of the current observed without any preincubation. The current traces at +10 mV after different incubation times are shown in Fig.1A, and the current-voltage relationship is shown in Fig. 1 B. A plot of normalized currents elicited by step depolarization to +10 mV from a holding potential of −40 mV at different incubation times is shown in Fig.1 C. This shows that the preincubation of GH4C1 cells in serum-free buffer at 37 °C over 2-h time periods does not alter the stability of L-type calcium channel currents. However, once the whole cell configuration was established, the current rapidly ran down to smaller levels within 10 min. All recordings were therefore completed within 3–5 min after establishing the whole cell configuration at the end of any preincubation. The average L-type calcium channel current density obtained using 20 mm barium as an external charge carrier was 17–19 pA/pF. Cell capacitance measured during the experiment using a hyperpolarizing pulse to −60 mV from a holding potential of −40 mV was ∼21–23 pF. Cellular depolarization by preincubating the cells in depolarizing Tyrode's solution (50 mm K+) rapidly down-regulated the currents. The current density decreased from 17.39 ± 0.82 pA/pF to 5.36 ± 0.35 pA/pF within 5 min of depolarization, indicating a 69% decrease in the current amplitude (Fig.2A). The time course of down-regulation was established by preincubating cells in depolarizing Tyrode's solution (50 mm K+) for different time periods. Down-regulation reached a maximal level within 5 min, and longer durations of preincubations up to 1 h did not further increase the extent of down-regulation (Fig. 2, A andB). Depolarization-induced (50 mmK+) down-regulation was reversible. After 30 min of down-regulation by preincubating the cells in depolarizing 50 mm K+-Tyrode's solution, the cells were allowed to recover in resting Tyrode's solution for different time periods (Fig. 2 C). Currents elicited by pulses to +10 mV are shown to depict the recovery from down-regulation. The currents recovered to 80–85% of control levels within 30–45 min of repolarization (Fig. 2 D). This also suggests that the phenomenon observed is down-regulation and not the calcium and voltage-dependent inactivation of calcium channels as the recovery from inactivation is relatively fast and complete within seconds. Down-regulation of L-type calcium channel currents depended on the extent of depolarization. Increasing the concentration of K+ ions in the external buffer increased the depolarization stimulus and the extent of down-regulation. The resting cell potential measured in 5.8 mm K+-Tyrode was −65 to −70 mV and changed to approximately −15 mV in 50 mmK+-Tyrode. The current density decreased with the increase in levels of extracellular potassium in the depolarizing buffer (Fig. 3, A andB). Down-regulation reached a maximum at 50 mmextracellular [K+], beyond which any further increase of [K+] did not produce a further decrease in the currents (Fig. 3 C). To investigate whether the down-regulation was because of cellular depolarization and not nonspecifically because of excessive potassium in the external depolarizing buffer, we explored alternate depolarization mechanisms. 50 mm K+ depolarizes the cell to approximately −15 mV. A similar change in membrane potential can be introduced in cells in resting Tyrode's buffer by voltage clamping them. If depolarization were to produce a down-regulation, this should produce a similar decrease in the current amplitude. We examined this hypothesis in an experiment where we measured the whole cell currents from a holding potential of −40 mV before and after voltage clamping the cell at −10 mV for 5 min in 5.8 mm K+- Tyrode's solution. Voltage clamping at −10 mV for 5 min decreased the current amplitude in a manner similar to the down-regulation observed with 50 mmK+ treatment (Fig. 3, D and E). Another mode of depolarization also produced a down-regulation of L-type currents. Cells were exposed to the alkaloid veratridine, a sodium channel activator, for 30 min (34Dargent B. Couraud F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5907-5911Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 35Dargent B. Arsac C. Tricaud N. Couraud F. Neuroscience. 1996; 73: 209-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Veratridine decreased the calcium channel currents in a concentration-dependent manner (concentration response data not shown). Treatment with 50 µm veratridine for 30 min decreased the current density by 22%. The current density decreased from 15.87 ± 0.61 pA/pF to 12.34 ± 1.06 pA/pF (Fig. 4,A and B). The decrease in the current density was also accompanied with an enhanced inactivation of the current. Thus, the different modes of depolarization had different effects on down-regulation. Normalized current-voltage curves for cells depolarized with 50 mm K+ or with veratridine are shown in Fig. 4, C and D. Cells depolarized with elevated extracellular [K+] shifted the peak current to +20 mV from +10 mV, but cells depolarized with veratridine did not show any voltage shift in peak current. Over the 200-ms pulse duration, cells depolarized with elevated extracellular [K+] did not show any kinetic changes, but cells depolarized with veratridine showed a faster inactivation of currents (Fig. 4 A). The presence of [Ca2+] in the extracellular depolarizing buffer was essential for the down-regulation of currents. The removal of [Ca2+] from depolarizing buffer to the contaminating levels in double distilled water inhibited the down-regulation, and the current density remained the same as in the cells incubated in normal Tyrode's buffer. The current traces at +10 mV and the current-voltage relationships in depolarizing buffers having different Ca2+concentrations are shown in Fig. 5,A and B. The down-regulation was enhanced with an increasing concentration of Ca2+ in the depolarizing 50 mm K+ buffer (Fig. 5 C). BAPTA-AM, a cell permeant analog of BAPTA, chelates intracellular calcium after the hydrolysis of the acetomethoxy-functional group (AM) inside the cell. Preloading the cells with 25 µm BAPTA-AM before depolarization did not inhibit the down-regulation caused by depolarization (Fig. 5, D and E). This suggests that the down-regulation may not be attributed to the accumulation of excess Ca2+ inside the cell. It might also be because of the fact that the molecular determinants of the Ca2+channel responsible for the down-regulation may be located in microdomains inaccessible to BAPTA-AM. Depolarization-induced down-regulation appeared to have an autocrine component. When the cells were bathed in a stream of depolarizing 50 mmK+ buffer as opposed to stagnant buffer, a part of the down-regulation was relieved (Fig. 6). This suggests that hormones or other factors that are released by these anterior pituitary cells into the surrounding medium on depolarization may act on the channels and inhibit their activity. This could be prevented in the stream of depolarizing buffer if the factors are washed out from the vicinity of the cells. However, a substantial component of down-regulation still persisted that was independent of the factors released from the cell, suggesting alternate mechanisms for the down-regulation of the remaining component of the L-type current. Membrane potential is an important regulator of ion channel activity. Whereas cellular depolarization on one hand is an important physiologic signal, it also serves as a pathophysiologic trigger. Membrane depolarization can bring about both up- and down-regulation of the channel activity. In PC-12 cells, prolonged depolarization by elevated extracellular K+ causes concomitant time- and concentration-dependent decreases in both [3H]nitrendipine binding and depolarization-dependent uptake of45Ca2+, indicating a decrease in the channel number and function (18DeLorme E.M. Rabe C.S. McGee R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1988; 244: 838-843PubMed Google Scholar). In chick neural retinal cells, chronic depolarization reduces (+)-[3H]PN200-110 binding and45Ca2+ uptake (19Ferrante J. Triggle D.J. Rutledge A. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1991; 69: 914-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Chronic depolarization decreases the density of the macroscopic Ca2+ currents in the rat myenteric neurons (36Fitzpatrick D.B. Karmazyn M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1984; 228: 761-768PubMed Google Scholar). In pituitary GH4C1 cells, short term depolarization for periods of up to 2 h decreases the (+)-[3H]PN200-110 binding site density by 10-fold accompanied by a 20-fold increase in drug affinity (22Liu J. Bangalore R. Rutledge A. Triggle D.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 1198-1206PubMed Google Scholar). In all of these studies the regulation depended on the presence of extracellular calcium. Cellular depolarization can also cause an up-regulation of the surface channels as well. Depolarization of chick myotubes has been shown to trigger the appearance of (+)-[3H]PN200-110 binding sites (37Wang G.K. Wang S.Y. J. Gen.

Binding studies with the radioligand 125I-ω-CgTx on subcellular fractions show that the intracellular pool of neuronal N-type Ca2+channels in PC-12–251 cells and IMR-32 cells constituted 60–80% of the total calcium channels (38Sher E. Clementi F. Neuroscience. 1991; 42: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 39Passafaro M. Clementi F. Sher E. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 3372-3379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This intracellular pool of channels is recruited to the cell membrane on depolarization with KCl. The cell surface 125I-ω-CgTx binding sites increased by >200% within 10 min of depolarization with 55 mm KCl. This transiently decreased over a period of 1 h and then stabilized at a level that was higher than the control level. In this study, we show an electrophysiologic correlation of the calcium channel regulation in pituitary GH4C1 cells by short term membrane depolarization. GH4C1 and GH3 pituitary clonal cells express L-type calcium channels. Currents through these channels have been characterized both by whole cell and single channel experiments (23Armstrong C.M.

Sci. 1991; 245: 127-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Short term regulation studies using radioligand binding were also done on these cells (22Liu J. Bangalore R. Rutledge A. Triggle D.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 1198-1206PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, we chose these cells as a model system to study the functional aspects of calcium channel regulation electrophysiologically. We show that cellular depolarization with elevated extracellular potassium produced an ∼70% decrease in the barium current density in GH4C1 cells. This process is very rapid, and the decrease in currents is evident with depolarizations as short as 5 min. Even though the earlier studies involving (+)-[3H]PN200-110 binding have evaluated the regulation of the channel activity for periods shorter than half an hour, these studies may not be accurate because of the limitation posed by equilibration of the ligand with receptor. In addition and unlike the (+)-[3H]PN200-110 binding experiments, the electrophysiologic experiments evaluate the channel activity in the absence of any exogenous 1,4-dihydropyridines, thus precluding any possible additional regulation of the channel by the antagonist itself. Our study also shows that the down-regulation of the L-type calcium channels by depolarization is a reversible phenomenon, and that the currents recover to near control levels when the cells are placed in normal 5.8 mm K+-Tyrode. The extent of down-regulation depended on the depolarizing stimuli and increased as the membrane potential was raised by increasing the extracellular potassium. Qualitatively, no appreciable changes in the channel kinetics were observed between the control cells and the cells depolarized with 50 mm K+ using barium as charge carrier. However, the down-regulation was accompanied with a +10 mV shift in the voltage dependence of activation to a more depolarized potential. Depolarization of cells by voltage clamping at −10 mV also produced a down-regulation similar to depolarization produced by 50 mm K+. The depolarization of cells with veratridine, a sodium channel activator, also produced a decrease in the channel currents. However, this decrease is not as dramatic as seen with 50 mm K+ and also does not shift the voltage dependence of activation. In our experiments, we observed that the down-regulation of the channel activity could be partially relieved by depolarizing the cells in a stream of depolarizing 50 mm K+ buffer rather than in the stagnant buffer. This finding suggests that a factor or factors may be released by these cells on depolarization with 50 mm K+ to act on the cell in a feedback manner under the conditions of sustained depolarization and to inhibit the channel activity. In a stream of the buffer, these factors are removed, which prevents their feedback activity on the cells. Hormone-induced modulation of channels is inherent to neurosecretory cells. The activation of calcium channels is essential for the release of hormones like prolactin, GH, and adrenocorticotropic hormone from the anterior pituitary cells (42Schultz G. Hescheler J. Arzneim.-Forsch. 1993; 43: 229-232PubMed Google Scholar, 43Simasko S.M. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 2015-2026Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Physiologically, this can be achieved by the action of hormones like thyrotropin-releasing hormone. Depolarization with elevated potassium also leads to hormonal release in in vitro assays. On the other hand, certain hormones like somatostatin inhibit calcium channel activity and suppress the release of the pituitary hormones. This autocrine regulation of calcium channels is thought to be mediated through G proteins-Go in pituitary cells (29Rosenthal W. Hescheler J. Trautwein W. Schultz G. FASEB J. 1988; 2: 2784-2790Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 42Schultz G. Hescheler J. Arzneim.-Forsch. 1993; 43: 229-232PubMed Google Scholar, 44Wickman K.D. Clapham D.E. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1995; 5: 278-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The presence of extracellular calcium ions was essential for the down-regulation, indicating that it is a calcium-dependent process. Elimination of Ca2+ from depolarizing buffer abolished the down-regulation. Here we show that as the calcium concentration is increased to physiologic levels in the depolarizing buffer, the down-regulation is gradually enhanced. However, the preincubation of cells with 25 µm BAPTA-AM, a cell permeant calcium chelator before depolarization, failed to relieve the down-regulation. This suggests two possibilities: (a) even though BAPTA-AM was hydrolyzed to BAPTA inside the cell, there was a constant flux of Ca2+ from the extracellular medium, saturating BAPTA and thereby preventing its action, and (b) the site of action of Ca2+ on the channel to produce regulation is very close to the channel pore and is inaccessible to intracellular chelators. Calcium- and voltage-dependent inactivation of L-type calcium channels are well studied phenomena (16Imredy J.P. Yue D.T.

In our study, the depolarizing buffer (50 mm K+) contained 2 mm Ca2+ and could induce voltage- and/or Ca2+-dependent inactivation of the channel. However, the phenomenon observed in our study is not a voltage-dependent inactivation, because it does not occur with depolarization in the absence of Ca2+ in the depolarizing buffer. In addition, the recovery from both voltage- and Ca2+-dependent inactivation is relatively fast and occurs within a few seconds for fast inactivation and within 1–2 min for slow inactivation (47Sokolov S. Weiss R.G. Timin E.N. Hering S. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 527: 445-454Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 48Hering S. Berjukow S. Sokolov S. Marksteiner R. Weiss R.G. Kraus R. Timin E.N. J.

Nature. 1999; 399: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the recovery from depolarization-induced regulation occurred over a period of 30–45 min in our studies, suggesting that it is down-regulation and not inactivation. This finding is also consistent with the decrease in the binding site density observed in response to depolarization in the earlier experiments (22Liu J. Bangalore R. Rutledge A. Triggle D.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 1198-1206PubMed Google Scholar). In conclusion, we present evidence for depolarization-induced down-regulation of currents through L-type calcium channels in GH4C1 cells. This is a reversible phenomenon. The down-regulation of L-type calcium channels is calcium-dependent and requires the presence of external calcium. The data suggest but do not prove the direct action of calcium on calcium channel to induce the down-regulation. The possible mechanisms for down-regulation may involve an autocrine component."
