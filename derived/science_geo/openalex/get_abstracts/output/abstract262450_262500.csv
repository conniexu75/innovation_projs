https://openalex.org/W2094735859,"The cancer stem cell hypothesis postulates that tumor growth is driven by a rare subpopulation of tumor cells. Much of the supporting evidence for this intriguing idea is derived from xenotransplantation experiments in which human leukemia cells are grown in immunocompromised mice. We show that, when lymphomas and leukemias of mouse origin are transplanted into histocompatible mice, a very high frequency (at least 1 in 10) of the tumor cells can seed tumor growth. We suggest that the low frequency of tumor-sustaining cells observed in xenotransplantation studies may reflect the limited ability of human tumor cells to adapt to growth in a foreign (mouse) milieu."

Global chromatin changes accompany the transition from proliferating NSCs to committed neuronal lineages, but the mechanisms involved have been unclear. Using a proteomics approach, we show that a switch in subunit composition of neural, ATP-dependent SWI/SNF-like chromatin remodeling complexes accompanies this developmental transition. Proliferating neural stem and progenitor cells express complexes in which BAF45a, a Kr√ºppel/PHD domain protein and the actin-related protein BAF53a are quantitatively associated with the SWI2/SNF2-like ATPases, Brg and Brm. As neural progenitors exit the cell cycle, these subunits are replaced by the homologous BAF45b, BAF45c, and BAF53b. BAF45a/53a subunits are necessary and sufficient for neural progenitor proliferation. Preventing the subunit switch impairs neuronal differentiation, indicating that this molecular event is essential for the transition from neural stem/progenitors to postmitotic neurons. More broadly, these studies suggest that SWI/SNF-like complexes in vertebrates achieve biological specificity by combinatorial assembly of their subunits."

The contribution of these smaller glaciers has accelerated over the past decade, in part due to marked thinning and retreat of marine-terminating glaciers associated with a dynamic instability that is generally not considered in mass-balance and climate modeling. This acceleration of glacier melt may cause 0.1 to 0.25 meter of additional sea-level rise by 2100."

They are also thought to underlie placebo effects, impacting perceptions and biological processes. Using healthy human subjects, we examined the role of the nucleus accumbens (NAC), a region centrally involved in the encoding of reward expectation, in the formation of placebo responses. Employing functional molecular imaging, activation of NAC dopamine (DA) release was observed during placebo administration and related to its anticipated effects, perception-anticipation mismatches, and placebo effect development. In additional functional MRI studies, the expectation of monetary gain increased NAC synaptic activity in a manner proportional to placebo-induced DA release, anticipated effects, perception-anticipation differentials, and actual placebo effects. Individual variations in NAC response to reward expectation accounted for 28% of the variance in the formation of placebo analgesia.

Individual variations in NAC response to reward expectation accounted for 28% of the variance in the formation of placebo analgesia. A common phenomenon across a variety of human experiences is the extent to which our expectations about an event, whether positive or negative, direct behavior to ensure future reward acquisition or to avoid potential harm. It is thought that these effects are mediated by specific neuronal circuits linking cognitive, emotional, and motor responses traditionally studied in the context of the pursuit of natural (e.g., food), monetary, and drug rewards (Kalivas et al., 1999Kalivas P.W.

However, individual expectancies also shape the actual perception and experience of events, not just motivated behavior. For example, the anticipation that a noxious challenge would be of higher or lower intensity has been shown to increase and diminish subjective report, as well as the brain regional responses to otherwise identical stimuli. The neural effects have consistently involved the anterior cingulate and posterior insula, areas implicated in the perception and regulation of pain signals (Keltner et al., 2006Keltner J.R. Furst A.

Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7438-7445PubMed Google Scholar). Environmental challenges threatening homeostasis and positive expectations capable of reducing the bodily response are therefore interacting with each other conferring vulnerability and resiliency, respectively. These effects are thought to be the basis for the formation of placebo effects and point to individual expectancies as important modifiers of biological processes in both health and disease. However, the processes by which anticipation translates into measurable biological responses are unknown, this being a question of profound relevance to medicine and human biology. Placebo effects are an important confound in medical trials (Hrobjartsson and Gotzsche, 2001Hrobjartsson A. Gotzsche P. Is the placebo powerless? An analysis of clinical trials comparing placebo with no treatment.N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 344: 1594-1602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1191) Google Scholar), while at the same time they represent a resiliency mechanism favoring homeostasis. The larger the anticipated benefit from a drug or a procedure, typically the greater is the actual health improvement observed (de Craen et al., 2000de Craen A.J. Tijssen J.G. de Gans J. Kleijnen J.

In nonhuman primates and rodents, brainstem ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopaminergic cells projecting to the nucleus accumbens (NAC) of the ventral basal ganglia respond to both the magnitude of anticipated rewards and deviations from the predicted outcomes, serving as an adaptive system modulating behavioral responses (Schultz, 2006Schultz W. Behavioral theories and the neurophysiology of reward.Annu. Rev. Psychol. 2006; 57: 87-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar, Setlow et al., 2003Setlow B. Schoenbaum G. Gallagher M.

Fiorillo C.D. Schultz W. Adaptive coding of reward value by dopamine neurons.Science. 2005; 307: 1642-1645Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). Based on this information and if the placebo effect is considered a form of reward anticipation response, it has been hypothesized that the activity of mesolimbic dopamine (DA) cells during reward anticipation and their capacity to adapt to environmental information underlies placebo responding in humans (Fields, 2004Fields H. State-dependent opioid control of pain.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 565-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar, Irizarry and Licinio, 2005Irizarry K.J. Licinio J. An explanation for the placebo effect?.Science. 2005; 307: 1411-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). DA activation in the NAC has been detected with positron emission tomography (PET) during receipt of a placebo in patients diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in a manner proportional to the anticipated improvement in motor control (de la Fuente-Fernandez et al., 2002de la Fuente-Fernandez R. Phillips A.G. Zamburlini M. Sossi V. Calne D.B. Ruth T.J. Stoessl A.J. Dopamine release in human ventral striatum and expectation of reward.Behav. Brain Res. 2002; 136: 359-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). However, no relationship was found between NAC DA activity and the actual placebo effects on motor function. These were, in fact, ascribed to DA activity in nigrostriatal projection regions (caudate and putamen) (de la Fuente-Fernandez et al., 2001de la Fuente-Fernandez R. Ruth T.J. Sossi V. Schulzer M. Calne D.B. Stoessl A.J. Expectation and dopamine release: Mechanism of the placebo effect in Parkinson's disease.Science. 2001; 293: 1164-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). Along similar lines, Petrovic and collaborators, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) (Petrovic et al., 2005Petrovic P. Dietrich T. Fransson P. Andersson J. Carlsson K. Ingvar M. Placebo in emotional processing‚Äìinduced expectations of anxiety relief activate a generalized modulatory network.Neuron. 2005; 46: 957-969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), described a correlation between ratings of negative affect improvement during preconditioning with a benzodiazepine and ventral basal ganglia synaptic activity after receipt of a placebo. These reports seem to confirm an involvement of NAC DA and synaptic activity in the expectations created by the introduction of a placebo, or in the case of the latter work, in conditioned responses. Nevertheless, how these effects are related to actual placebo effects and whether individual differences in NAC function underlie individual variations in the biological effects of placebos remains unknown. Alternatively, placebo-associated changes in NAC and mesolimbic DA function could simply form part of an epiphenomenon related to the organism response to a salient stimulus (i.e., the placebo) without physiological relevance other than directing attention to that stimulus. These questions were examined in a sample of healthy humans with a combination of studies employing PET and [11C]raclopride and fMRI. The studies were described as a randomized control trial of a novel analgesic agent and that either a placebo or an active agent could be administered. In that manner, we hoped to elicit a full range of expectations and placebo effects that would allow the study of interindividual differences in these phenomena. The placebo consisted of 1 ml of isotonic saline delivered intravenously every 4 min. The 20 min pain expectation periods were followed by an actual pain challenge that was maintained for 20 min. Molecular imaging was employed to measure placebo-induced DA release during the pain expectation state. This would be reflected by reductions in the in vivo receptor availability (binding potential, BP) during pain anticipation scans when the placebo was administered. To determine whether individual differences in placebo effects are related to variations in the biological response to reward anticipation, subjects also underwent an fMRI study using the Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) task. This task activates NAC synaptic activity during the anticipation of a reward (Knutson et al., 2004Knutson B. Bjork J.M. Fong G.W. Hommer D. Mattay V.S. Weinberger D.R. Amphetamine modulates human incentive processing.Neuron. 2004; 43: 261-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Interindividual variations in NAC DA responses to placebo administration were then compared with the synaptic activity of the same region during anticipation of a monetary reward. Both these measures were then examined as a function of the anticipated analgesic effects of the placebo, deviations from those expectations, and the magnitude of placebo analgesic effects in pain challenges. It was hypothesized that in healthy subjects, in the absence of underlying pathology or previous conditioning, interindividual variations in placebo-induced NAC DA activity and in the synaptic activity of this region during reward anticipation would be related to the variability in placebo effects obtained in the studies. Fourteen of the volunteers (seven male, seven female) participated in the functional molecular PET and [11C]raclopride studies. This is a DA D2 receptor radioligand that also labels D3 receptors in the NAC (Seeman et al., 2006Seeman P. Wilson A. Gmeiner P. Kapur S. Dopamine D2 and D3 receptors in human putamen, caudate nucleus, and globus pallidus.Synapse. 2006; 60: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Each subject was studied during conditions of expectation of a painful challenge with and without the administration of a placebo with potential analgesic properties. Anticipated analgesia ratings averaged 37 ¬± 26 (mean ¬± 1 SD) (range 0‚Äì95), using a 0‚Äì100 visual analog scale (VAS = 0 not expected to be effective, 100 complete effectiveness). These studies were followed by actual pain challenges, with and without placebo administration, lasting for 20 min each (Figure 1A). Subjective ratings of placebo analgesia acquired at that time were rated at 35 ¬± 30 (range 0‚Äì80, with 0 = completely ineffective and 100 = completely effective). The mismatch between anticipated and perceived placebo effects was also computed (analgesia perceived minus anticipated, 2 ¬± 31, range 60 to ‚àí60). Prior to the induction of pain, placebo effects during pain expectation were determined using the Positive and Negative Affectivity Scale (PANAS; Watson et al., 1988Watson D. Clark L.A. Tellegen A. Development and validation of brief measures of positive and negative affect: The PANAS scales.J Pers. Soc. Psychol. 1988; 54: 1063-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (22690) Google Scholar) affect ratings. Placebo administration was associated with reductions in PANAS negative affect ratings (2.3 ¬± 2.4 without placebo to 1.5 ¬± 2.7 with placebo, one-tail paired t test, t = 2.8, p < 0.01). Fear ratings were also reduced (2.2 ¬± 2.2 to 1.0 ¬± 2.0, t = 4.5, p = 0.001), while positive affect ratings showed a trend toward increases (6.9 ¬± 6.1 without placebo to 9.5 ¬± 9.2 with placebo, t = 1.6, p < 0.08). In the pain challenges that followed, placebo-induced analgesic effects were determined by contrasting studies with and without the administration of the placebo using the change in pain intensity ratings acquired every 15 s for the 20 min duration of the challenges (df = 13, paired one-tail t tests). For the entire sample, the average pain intensity ratings were 33 ¬± 14 without and 27 ¬± 12 with placebo (average within subject reduction 6 ¬± 10 VAS units, t = 1.8, p = 0.04) (Figure 1C). We also examined whether placebo effects on pain ratings could be explained by the order in which the studies were conducted, as placebo administrations always followed pain challenges to provide a frame of reference to the subjects. For this purpose, a separate sample of 18 healthy males 20‚Äì30 years of age was studied twice with the same experimental protocol, except that no scanning was performed and subjects did not receive the placebo. Average VAS pain intensity ratings over 20 min were 32 ¬± 13 for studies conducted first in order, and 31 ¬± 13 for those second in order (paired one-tail t test, t = 0.6, p = 0.3). Significant differences for the change in pain ratings between placebo and no intervention group were obtained, confirming the development of a placebo analgesia that was not confounded by order effects (two-sample, one-tail t test, t = 2.1, p = 0.02). Pain ratings over time during the no intervention studies are shown in Figure 1D. Analgesic effects were also examined as a function of time (divided into acute, tonic, and sustained pain phases) to determine whether one or more parts of the 20 min pain challenge were more susceptible to placebo analgesic effects and for comparability with pain models of shorter duration (Grevert and Goldstein, 1977Grevert P. Goldstein A. Effects of naloxone on experimentally induced ischemic pain and on mood in human subjects.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1977; 74: 1291-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, Amanzio and Benedetti, 1999Amanzio M. Benedetti F. Neuropharmacological dissection of placebo analgesia: Expectation-activated opioid systems versus conditioning-activated specific subsystems.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 484-494PubMed Google Scholar). For the initial acute pain intensity ratings (peak rating after a 0.15 ml bolus of 5% hypertonic saline administered over 15 s) pain ratings were 60 ¬± 23 VAS intensity units before and 56 ¬± 18 after placebo (t = 0.9, p = 0.2). Ratings over the first 10 min of the challenge (tonic pain) were 33 ¬± 16 (pain) and 27 ¬± 10 (pain + placebo) (t = 1.6, p = 0.06). During the last 10 min of the challenge (sustained pain phase), these were 33 ¬± 15 (pain) and 26 ¬± 14 (pain + placebo) (t = 2.4, p = 0.02). Placebo effects then appeared more prominent for tonic or more sustained phases of pain, as opposed to brief, phasic pain (Figure 1C). The anticipation of analgesia was significantly and positively correlated with the average reduction in pain ratings during pain + placebo studies (r = 0.48, p < 0.05), as was the difference between perceived and anticipated analgesia (r = 0.54, p < 0.05). For analyses of imaging data, individuals were grouped into high and low placebo analgesia responders using the median value of the average change in pain intensity ratings over the 20 min challenges. Placebo responders above the median (high responders) showed average reductions in pain intensity of 11 ¬± 7 VAS units (Figure 1C), while a ‚àí0.2 ¬± 10 VAS intensity unit reduction was recorded in placebo responders below the median (low placebo responders) (n = 7 in each group). In the DA receptor quantification scans acquired during pain expectation, volumes of interest placed in the NAC bilaterally demonstrated placebo-induced activation of DA D2/D3 neurotransmission, evidenced by significant reductions in BP. These averaged 11.0% in the left and 8.1% in the right NAC (left NAC BP, 1.3 ¬± 0.2 without and 1.2 ¬± 0.3 with placebo, paired one-tail t test, t = 2.5, p < 0.02; right NAC BP, 1.7 ¬± 0.3 without and 1.6 ¬± 0.4 with placebo, paired one-tail t test, t = 1.8, p = 0.05) (Figure 1B). No significant sex differences in placebo-induced DA release were obtained, nor correlations between DA release and estradiol or progesterone plasma levels in females (p > 0.05). Progesterone levels were uniformly low for this sample of women, who were studied in the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. No significant correlations were obtained between the placebo effect during pain expectation trials (the change in PANAS negative, positive, or fear scores with placebo) and right or left NAC DA activity (p > 0.05). However, when subjects were grouped into high and low placebo responders using a median split of the placebo-induced change in positive affect during pain expectation, significant differences in DA activation were obtained in the left NAC (high responders 20 ¬± 16%, low responders 2 ¬± 11% change in BP, t = 2.3, p = 0.02). Effects in the same direction were obtained for the right NAC, but did not reach statistical significance (high responders 9 ¬± 14%, low responders 2 ¬± 6% change in BP, t = 1.2, p = 0.1). No significant differences in placebo-induced NAC DA release were obtained for subject groupings using placebo-induced changes in PANAS negative affect or fear ratings (p > 0.05). The magnitude of placebo-induced DA activation in the NAC, bilaterally, was positively associated with the anticipated effectiveness of the placebo as rated by the volunteers prior to its introduction (right, r = 0.69, p < 0.005; left, r = 0.67, p = 0.005) (Figure 2A). More relevant to the elicitation of placebo analgesic effects, similar relationships were obtained between placebo-induced NAC DA activation and the mismatch between its perceived effectiveness and the anticipated placebo analgesia (right, r = 0.46, p < 0.05; left, r = 0.66, p < 0.005) (Figure 2B). The high placebo analgesia group in the pain trials also demonstrated significantly greater magnitudes of right NAC DA responses to placebo during the pain expectation PET studies than low placebo analgesia responders (high placebo analgesia group, 15 ¬± 13% reduction in DA D2/D3 BP, low placebo analgesia, 0.4 ¬± 7%, unpaired one-tail t test, t = 2.5, p < 0.02). However, no significant correlations were obtained between these two variables (p > 0.05). No significant effects were obtained for the left NAC in t tests or correlations (p > 0.05). In the low placebo response group, four individuals reported increases in pain intensity during placebo administration (hyperalgesia during placebo administration, a possible nocebo effect) that reached statistical significance (placebo hyperalgesia group 10.0 ¬± 2.3 increase in average VAS intensity ratings, remainder of the sample 11.3 ¬± 10.9 reduction, unpaired t test, t = 5.7, p < 0.0001). These subjects showed lower levels of placebo-induced DA release compared to the remainder of the group in the right NAC, with a mean in the direction of ‚Äúdeactivation‚Äù (change in BP, hyperalgesia/nocebo responders, 0.2 ¬± 6.3% increases in BP, remainder of the sample 5.9 ¬± 10.3% reductions in BP), albeit these differences did not reach statistical significance with the small sample size of the nocebo group. Changes in left NAC DA D2/D3 receptor BP were similar for hyperalgesia/nocebo responders and other subjects, however (hyperalgesia/nocebo group 6.8 ¬± 11.7%; others 8.0 ¬± 8.8%; decreases in BP in both cases). The results of the functional molecular imaging studies indicate that ventral basal ganglia DA neurotransmission is activated in response to the introduction of a placebo in a manner proportional to its anticipated benefit. The imaging data were obtained in the absence of actual pain (pain expectation periods), and therefore do not represent a response motivated by varying experiences of pain at the time, known to influence placebo responding (Zubieta et al., 2006Zubieta J.K. Yau W.Y. Scott D.J. Stohler C.S. Belief or Need? Accounting for individual variations in the neurochemistry of the placebo effect.Brain Behav. Immun. 2006; 20: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). They may then more closely relate to individual variations in NAC DA reactivity to salient cues, in this case the placebo, of potential benefit to the subject. In this regard, we show that the difference between subjectively experienced and anticipated placebo effects was related to the magnitude of NAC DA D2/D3 system activation during placebo administration. Furthermore, high placebo analgesia responders in pain trials following the imaging experiments were characterized by more pronounced NAC DA activity during placebo administration in the pain expectation periods that preceded them. Thirty volunteers (23 male, 7 female) were available for additional fMRI studies that involved using the MID task (Knutson et al., 2001Knutson B. Adams C.M. Fong G.W. Hommer D. Anticipation of increasing monetary reward selectively recruits nucleus accumbens.J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: RC159PubMed Google Scholar). In this task, subjects were presented with a visual stimulus representing null ($0.00), low ($0.20), intermediate ($1.00), or high ($5.00) monetary reward values. This was followed by an anticipatory state, a neutral target, and the announcement that the expected reward was received (Knutson et al., 2001Knutson B. Adams C.M. Fong G.W. Hommer D. Anticipation of increasing monetary reward selectively recruits nucleus accumbens.J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: RC159PubMed Google Scholar). The protocol and responses of the NAC to varying levels of anticipated rewards are shown in Figure 3A. Significant increases in blood-oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) fMRI signal, reflecting brain neuronal synaptic activity (Logothetis et al., 2001Logothetis N.K. Pauls J. Augath M. Trinath T. Oeltermann A. Neurophysiological investigation of the basis of the fMRI signal.Nature. 2001; 412: 150-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (4412) Google Scholar), were detected in the NAC, bilaterally, during the anticipation of monetary rewards in a manner proportional to reward value, as previously reported (Knutson et al., 2001Knutson B. Adams C.M. Fong G.W. Hommer D. Anticipation of increasing monetary reward selectively recruits nucleus accumbens.J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: RC159PubMed Google Scholar) (Figure 3B depicts the average changes in right and left NAC BOLD signal). We then tested whether variations in NAC synaptic activity levels during the anticipation of the larger monetary gain ($5.00), compared to the null condition ($0.00), were related to the formation of placebo effects. In this sample, significant effects of placebo during pain anticipation were obtained for PANAS negative (t = 1.9, p < 0.04) and fear (t = 2.4, p = 0.02), but not positive affect ratings (t = 0.9, p = 0.2). Placebo analgesic effects during pain trials were also significant across the entire group (t = 1.7, p < 0.05). A significant positive correlation was obtained between right NAC BOLD fMRI activation during monetary reward anticipation and the anticipated effectiveness of the placebo (r = 0.79, p < 0.001), similarly to the results obtained with placebo-induced NAC DA release. Also as observed for placebo-induced NAC DA release, the mismatch between perceived effectiveness and anticipated placebo analgesic effects was positively correlated with NAC synaptic activity during monetary reward anticipation (r = 0.56, p < 0.001). The relationships between anticipated and subjectively perceived effects of placebo administration and the NAC BOLD response to reward were further explored by grouping subjects into those finding the placebo as more (n = 7), equally (n = 16) or less effective (n = 7) than anticipated. Right NAC responses to small ($0.20), medium ($1.00), and large ($5.00) rewards were examined for these three groups of subjects with two-way ANOVA (independent variables, group and reward level; dependent variable, right NAC BOLD responses). Group √ó reward level interactions were obtained (F = 2.95, p = 0.02). Subjects that found the placebo either more or equally effective than anticipated demonstrated parametrically increasing right NAC responses to increasing levels of expected reward value. Individuals that rated the placebo as less effective than anticipated did not demonstrate parametrically increasing NAC responses as a function of reward values (Figure 3D). Positive correlations were also obtained between fMRI BOLD activation during reward anticipation and the analgesic effects of the placebo during pain trials (the difference between average pain intensity ratings over the 20 min) (r = 0.53, p = 0.02), accounting for 28% of the variance in the formation of placebo analgesia. Furthermore, the magnitude of right NAC synaptic activity during the reward anticipation task was positively correlated with placebo-induced DA activation in the right and left NAC in the 14 volunteers who participated in both PET and fMRI studies (right, r = 0.51, p < 0.04; left, r = 0.52, p < 0.04) (Figure 3C). No significant sex differences or correlations with estradiol or progesterone were obtained for right NAC BOLD activation (p > 0.05). In view of previous data linking changes in positive affect and NAC responses to monetary reward (Knutson et al., 2005Knutson B. Taylor J. Kaufman M. Peterson R. Glover G. Distributed neural representation of expected value.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 4806-4812Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar), subjects were grouped into high and low placebo responders using the median value of the change in PANAS positive affect score (during pain expectation). Similar median splits were performed for pain intensity ratings in pain trials before and after placebo administration. High PANAS positive placebo responders during pain expectation trials demonstrated significantly greater right NAC activation during monetary reward anticipation than low placebo responders (percent BOLD signal change from null to $5.00 conditions, high PANAS positive affect responders, 0.82 ¬± 0.45%, low PANAS responders 0.56 ¬± 0.38%, unpaired one-tail t test, df = 28, t = 1.7, p < 0.05). However, no significant correlations were obtained between the placebo-induced change in PANAS positive or negative affect during pain expectation and NAC activity during anticipation of reward (p > 0.05). When subjects were grouped as high or low placebo responders using the analgesic effect of the placebo during pain trials as the classifying factor, high placebo analgesia responders also demonstrated greater right NAC responses during reward anticipation (percent BOLD signal change from null to $5.00 conditions, high placebo analgesia group 0.76 ¬± 0.45%, low analgesia group 0.48 ¬± 0.31%, unpaired one-tail t test, df = 28, t = 1.9, p < 0.05). In the sample studied with fMRI, 8 subjects demonstrated hyperalgesia during placebo administration (possible nocebo response): 11.4 ¬± 7.9 increase in average intensity pain ratings; reminder of the sample, 12.5 ¬± 6.7 reduction in pain ratings. Right NAC BOLD signal during monetary reward anticipation was significantly lower in the hyperalgesia/nocebo group compared to the rest of the subjects (hyperalgesia/nocebo group 0.4 ¬± 0.3% increase in NAC BOLD signal; others, 0.8 ¬± 0.6% increase in BOLD, unpaired one-tail t test, t = 2.0, p < 0.03). The present report implicates NAC DA in placebo responses when there is anticipation of analgesia. We utilized an experimental design similar to those of clinical randomized controlled trials (no preconditioning or subject preselection, no deception, either an active or an inactive drug could be administered), allowing for a full range of expectations and placebo effects. This design was associated with relatively modest placebo effects across the entire sample, but permits the assessment of individual variations in this phenomenon. The introduction of a placebo was associated with the activati"

The task of solving the game, determining the final result in a game with no mistakes made by either player, is daunting. Since 1989, almost continuously, dozens of computers have been working on solving checkers, applying state-of-the-art artificial intelligence techniques to the proving process. This paper announces that checkers is now solved: Perfect play by both sides leads to a draw. This is the most challenging popular game to be solved to date, roughly one million times as complex as Connect Four. Artificial intelligence technology has been used to generate strong heuristic-based game-playing programs, such as Deep Blue for chess. Solving a game takes this to the next level by replacing the heuristics with perfection."
https://openalex.org/W2101402490,"When faced with a crowded visual scene, observers must selectively attend to behaviorally relevant objects to avoid sensory overload. Often this selection process is guided by prior knowledge of a target-defining feature (e.g., the color red when looking for an apple), which enhances the firing rate of visual neurons that are selective for the attended feature. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging and a pattern classification algorithm to predict the attentional state of human observers as they monitored a visual feature (one of two directions of motion). We find that feature-specific attention effects spread across the visual field‚Äîeven to regions of the scene that do not contain a stimulus. This spread of feature-based attention to empty regions of space may facilitate the perception of behaviorally relevant stimuli by increasing sensitivity to attended features at all locations in the visual field.

This spread of feature-based attention to empty regions of space may facilitate the perception of behaviorally relevant stimuli by increasing sensitivity to attended features at all locations in the visual field. The human visual system has a limited processing capacity. Consequently, when multiple stimuli are simultaneously present in a scene, they must compete for cortical representation and access to awareness (Desimone and Duncan, 1995Desimone R. Duncan J.

To resolve this competition, incoming sensory input is selectively filtered based on current behavioral goals so that relevant stimuli are processed more efficiently than irrelevant stimuli. An observer might attend to a particular region of space, providing a competitive advantage to stimuli presented at the selected location (Gandhi et al., 1999Gandhi S.P. Heeger D.J. Boynton G.M.

Alternately, attended features (e.g., a color or direction of motion) will enjoy a competitive advantage over stimuli that do not express the attended feature, independent of their spatial location (Martinez-Trujillo and Treue, 2004Martinez-Trujillo J.C.

Feature-based selection is thought to be especially important because we often know the defining features of a target (e.g., the pencil is yellow) without knowing its exact location (e.g., the pencil is somewhere on the desk). Investigators have only recently begun to examine the neural basis of feature-based attention (Haenny et al., 1988Haenny P.E. Maunsell J.H. Schiller P.H.

Attention and visual perception.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2005; 15: 465-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). This ‚Äúfeature-similarity gain‚Äù mechanism operates on the firing rate of all neurons tuned to the attended feature, even when the neuron is being driven by a stimulus that is outside the current focus of spatial attention (Bichot et al., 2005Bichot N.P.

Martinez Trujillo J.C. Feature-based attention influences motion processing gain in macaque visual cortex.Nature. 1999; 399: 575-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar). In addition, if the multiplicative gain factor also boosts the baseline firing rate of a neuron (‚Äúactivity gain;‚Äù see, e.g., Williford and Maunsell, 2006Williford T. Maunsell J.H. Effects of spatial attention on contrast response functions in macaque area V4.J. Neurophysiol. 2006; 96: 40-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), then the model makes the untested prediction that feature-based attention should modulate the firing rate of a neuron that is not directly driven by a stimulus in its spatial receptive field. In the present study, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and an image classification algorithm were used to demonstrate direction-selective attentional modulations in human occipital and parietal cortex (or intraparietal cortex [IPS]), replicating and extending recent reports showing similar attention effects in early regions of visual cortex (Kamitani and Tong, 2005Kamitani Y. Tong F. Decoding the visual and subjective contents of the human brain.Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 679-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar, Kamitani and Tong, 2006Kamitani Y. Tong F. Decoding seen and attended motion directions from activity in the human visual cortex.Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 1096-1102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). In addition, feature-based attentional modulations spread to stimuli presented outside the focus of spatial attention, corroborating single-cell recording studies (Bichot et al., 2005Bichot N.P. Rossi A.F. Desimone R. Parallel and serial neural mechanisms for visual search in macaque area V4.Science. 2005; 308: 529-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, Treue and Martinez Trujillo, 1999Treue S. Martinez Trujillo J.C. Feature-based attention influences motion processing gain in macaque visual cortex.Nature. 1999; 399: 575-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar) and establishing the feature-specific nature of these spatially global modulations in human observers (Saenz et al., 2002Saenz M. Buracas G.T. Boynton G.M. Global effects of feature-based attention in human visual cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 631-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Finally, feature-based attention spreads to unstimulated regions of the visual scene, which may facilitate visual search by automatically priming behaviorally relevant features simultaneously across all locations in the visual field. The behavioral task is depicted in Figure 1. Observers maintained gaze on a central fixation point; at the onset of each trial, a small attention cue indicated whether to attend to the left or right stimulus aperture, and it also indicated the direction of motion to be monitored within the attended aperture (i.e., either 45¬∞ or 135¬∞ motion). Observers pressed a button when the dots moving in the currently attended direction slowed (a target event), which occurred twice on each trial. No button press was required when the dots moving in the unattended direction slowed (a distractor event), which also occurred twice on each trial. On half of the trials, only the spatially cued aperture contained moving dots; on the remaining trials, dot fields were also presented on the unattended side of space. The speed of the moving dots presented on the unattended side of space (when present) remained constant throughout a trial. Each scan consisted of 24 trials interleaved with blank 6 s intertrial intervals. Observers were able to reliably discriminate target from distractor events (mean d-prime, ¬±SEM with one stimulus aperture: 2.58 ¬± 0.33, and with two stimulus apertures: 2.38 ¬± 0.30, not significantly different). Visual features fall into superordinate categories such as motion or color, and can be further divided into subordinate categories such as specific directions of motion or specific colors. Traditionally, fMRI studies have been restricted to the superordinate level of analysis because the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) response measured with fMRI is spatially imprecise with respect to the topology of subordinate-level selectivity within visual cortex. For example, motion-selective region MT contains direction-selective columns of neurons, with a 180¬∞ array of columns spanning approximately 0.5 mm of cortex (Albright et al., 1984Albright T.D. Desimone R. Gross C.G. Columnar organization of directionally selective cells in visual area MT of the macaque.J. Neurophysiol. 1984; 51: 16-31PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, a single fMRI voxel, measuring approximately 3 mm3 in the present study, should contain columns selective for many different directions. Averaging across all voxels in MT would nullify any directional selectivity in the BOLD response. However, Kamitani and Tong, 2005Kamitani Y. Tong F.

Neurosci. 2005; 8: 686-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar used a similar procedure to predict the orientation of a stimulus rendered ‚Äúinvisible‚Äù via a combination of forward and backward masking (Macknick's ‚Äústanding wave of invisibility;‚Äù see Macknik and Livingstone, 1998Macknik S.L. Livingstone M.S. Neuronal correlates of visibility and invisibility in the primate visual system.Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 144-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Here, we used a pattern classification analysis to examine motion-specific attentional modulations in visually responsive regions of occipital, parietal, and frontal cortex (see Experimental Procedures and Haynes and Rees, 2005Haynes J.D. Rees G. Predicting the orientation of invisible stimuli from activity in human primary visual cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 686-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). All neuroimaging analyses were based on measurements of the BOLD response made within regions of interest (ROIs) that were independently identified using a functional localizer task that isolated voxels responding more strongly to stimuli in one visual hemifield compared with the other. We exploited the fact that ROIs in left visual cortex receive input primarily from stimuli in the right visual field, whereas ROIs in right visual cortex receive input primarily from stimuli in the left visual field. This contralateral stimulus-to-cortex mapping allowed us to measure BOLD responses evoked by attended and ignored stimulus apertures on the same trial because the two apertures projected to visual areas in opposite cortical hemispheres. The qualitative pattern of responses was similar across corresponding ROIs (e.g., left and right human MT+, or hMT+, which is thought to be the homolog to monkey regions MT and MST), so data were collapsed across hemispheres within each observer. Each observer participated in either seven or eight scans of the main experimental task shown in Figure 1. To classify the observer's attentional state (e.g., attending 45¬∞ versus 135¬∞ motion), we first computed an activation vector indexing the magnitude of the BOLD signal in each voxel within a given ROI at each time point from 6 s to 18 s poststimulus. We then grouped these activation vectors into three bins based on the following stimulus/attention configurations with respect to each ROI: trials on which the observer was attending to a contralateral stimulus (Figures 1B and 1D), trials on which the observer was attending to an ipsilateral stimulus while there was an unattended stimulus in the contralateral field (Figure 1C), and trials on which the observer was attending to an ipsilateral stimulus while no stimulus was present in the contralateral visual field (Figure 1E). In all cases, the goal was to infer the currently attended direction of motion based on the activation vectors from each bin. To carry out the classification in a given stimulus/attention configuration, activation vectors from all but one of the scans were averaged to form a ‚Äútraining‚Äù vector, and activation vectors from the remaining scan were averaged to form a ‚Äútest‚Äù vector (a scan refers to an ‚àº8 min data acquisition block, so training and test vectors were independent). To classify the currently attended direction of motion, each test activation vector was classified based on the mean training activation vector that it most closely resembled (see Experimental Procedures). The accuracy of classification was validated using a ‚Äúhold-one-scan out‚Äù procedure, where data from each scan served as a test set in turn. Since the classification procedure was used to determine if the observers were attending to either 45¬∞ or 135¬∞ motion on any given trial, chance classification was always 50%. Figure 2A shows classification accuracy within motion-selective regions V3A (Braddick et al., 2001Braddick O.J. O'Brien J.M. Wattam-Bell J. Atkinson J. Hartley T. Turner R.

Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7060-7078PubMed Google Scholar) and hMT+ when the currently attended target stimulus was within the receptive field of the ROI under consideration (data collapsed across the stimulus configurations are depicted in Figures 1B and 1D; see Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data, available with this article online, for each condition separately). In V3A and hMT+, classification accuracy was above chance when all 50 voxels were considered, and the qualitative pattern of results was similar based on only the 30 most spatially selective voxels (Figure S2). As in other studies (e.g., the first figure in Haynes and Rees, 2005Haynes J.D. Rees G. Predicting the orientation of invisible stimuli from activity in human primary visual cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 686-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar), classification accuracy was sometimes above chance when only a few voxels were considered because the Mahalanobis distance (md) is sensitive to differences in the pattern of activation across an ROI and differences in mean activation levels between conditions. Thus, differences in the mean activation level across the first several voxels supported above-chance classification of the attended direction (however, similar results were obtained when the mean of each activation vector was explicitly removed before pattern classification; see Figure S3). This feature-based attentional modulation was not driven by sensory differences in the display because target events (a slowing of the dots moving in the currently attended direction) and distractor events (a slowing of the dots moving in the ignored direction) occurred with equal frequency on each trial. Spatial attention cannot account for the results because the moving stimuli were spatially interleaved, and a ‚Äúspotlight‚Äù of attention would cover dots moving in both directions. Therefore, the successful classification of motion direction depicted in Figure 2A must reflect systematic changes in the pattern of activation across V3A and hMT+ induced by feature-based attention. Figure 2B depicts asymptotic classification accuracy‚Äîdefined as classification accuracy with all 50 voxels considered‚Äîfrom all visual areas identified. Collapsed across visual areas, classification accuracy was significantly above chance [paired t test against chance, t(9) = 5.84, p < 0.0005]. Note that ROIs in IPS and frontal eye field (FEF) were only successfully identified in a subset of hemispheres across the ten observers (see Experimental Procedures). If feature-based attention spreads automatically to other stimuli in the visual field (Bichot et al., 2005Bichot N.P. Rossi A.F. Desimone R.

Martinez Trujillo J.C. Feature-based attention influences motion processing gain in macaque visual cortex.Nature. 1999; 399: 575-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar), then the pattern of activation evoked by the unattended stimulus aperture should also be modulated by the current state of feature-based attention. Figure 2C shows classification accuracy based on responses in areas V3A and hMT+ when an ignored stimulus was in the contralateral visual field (as in Figure 1C). Even though the stimulus was completely irrelevant to the task, the activation patterns predicted the currently attended direction of motion, and similar results were obtained in other regions of occipital and parietal cortex [Figure 2D, paired t test against chance collapsed across visual areas, t(9) = 2.9, p < 0.025]. Previous human neuroimaging studies have shown a general increase in the response to ignored stimuli that share a feature with an attended stimulus (Saenz et al., 2002Saenz M. Buracas G.T. Boynton G.M. Global effects of feature-based attention in human visual cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 631-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). The current data support the notion that these increased responses are due to response modulations within neurons selective for the attended feature. If feature-based attention operates by enhancing baseline firing rates, then we reasoned that it might also modulate the pattern of activation within an ROI even in the absence of direct sensory stimulation (as in Figure 1E). Figure 2E shows classification accuracy based on responses in V3A and hMT+ when the contralateral visual field was unstimulated, and the pattern of activation within most ROIs predicted the currently attended direction of motion, even in the absence of direct sensory input [Figure 2F, paired t test against chance collapsed across visual areas, t(9) = 5.29, p < 0.0005]. These data provide evidence that feature-based attentional modulations spread to unstimulated regions of the visual field. Since classification was carried out separately for each stimulus/attention configuration, the present results do not establish that the pattern of activation observed in the absence of direct visual stimulation is the same as the pattern observed when an actual stimulus is present in the receptive field of an ROI. We explicitly tested this possibility by evaluating classification accuracy when the training set was based on attended contralateral motion and the test set was based on either an unattended motion stimulus (Figure 1C) or an unstimulated region of the visual field (Figure 1E). While classification accuracy for an unattended stimulus was slightly above chance in some visual areas (although nonsignificant overall), classification accuracy based on responses to an unstimulated region of the visual field was at chance. Thus, our results show that although feature-based attention induces a systematic modulation of the pattern of activation across an ROI even in the absence of direct stimulation (Figure 2), the activation patterns are not necessarily the same as the patterns observed when a stimulus is driving the response. We speculate that this lack of generalization may be due to large sensory differences between the stimulus-present and stimulus-absent conditions. However, it is also possible that the pattern of attentional modulations in the absence of a stimulus may be qualitatively distinct from the pattern induced by an attended stimulus. An alternate account of our results holds that above-chance classification accuracy might be observed in all conditions if the observer foveates the currently attended stimulus. However, eye position was monitored in several observers during scanning and the mean gaze position deviated less than 0.5¬∞ of visual angle during epochs of attention to the left and right sides of space (approximately the size of the central attention cue). Such small deviations in eye position are unlikely to significantly influence the data, given that the stimuli were located approximately ¬±6¬∞ in the periphery. Nor did we find any systematic differences in eye position related to the currently attended direction of motion (45¬∞ versus 135¬∞, Figure S4). Because we are arguing that feature-based attention spreads to unstimulated regions of the visual field, it is important to demonstrate that the spatial receptive fields of the selected voxels did not also encompass the currently attended ipsilateral stimulus. Four of the original observers were scanned in a control experiment in which 12 s epochs of left or right peripheral visual stimulation were interleaved with occasional 12 s epochs of passive fixation (see Experimental Procedures). As depicted in Figure 3 (see also Figure S5), the voxels within V1, V2v, V3v, V4v, and V3A that were used in the main attention experiment (i.e., Figure 2) were highly selective for epochs of contralateral stimulation compared with epochs of ipsilateral stimulation (where epochs of passive fixation formed the baseline). On the other hand, reliable positive responses in hMT+, IPS, and FEF were observed during periods of ipsilateral stimulation compared with baseline (Ben Hamed et al., 2001Ben Hamed S. Duhamel J.R. Bremmer F. Graf W. Representation of the visual field in the lateral intraparietal area of macaque monkeys: a quantitative receptive field analysis.Exp.

https://openalex.org/W2071891769,"To unravel the strategy by which Brucella abortus establishes chronic infections, we explored its early interaction with innate immunity.Brucella did not induce proinflammatory responses as demonstrated by the absence of leukocyte recruitment, humoral or cellular blood changes in mice. Brucella hampered neutrophil (PMN) function and PMN depletion did not influence the course of infection. Brucella barely induced proinflammatory cytokines and consumed complement, and was strongly resistant to bactericidal peptides, PMN extracts and serum. Brucella LPS (BrLPS), NH-polysaccharides, cyclic glucans, outer membrane fragments or disrupted bacterial cells displayed low biological activity in mice and cells. The lack of proinflammatory responses was not due to conspicuous inhibitory mechanisms mediated by the invading Brucella or its products. When activated 24 h post-infection macrophages did not kill Brucella, indicating that the replication niche was not fusiogenic with lysosomes. Brucella intracellular replication did not interrupt the cell cycle or caused cytotoxicity in WT, TLR4 and TLR2 knockout cells. TNF-alpha-induction was TLR4- and TLR2-dependent for live but not for killed B. abortus. However, intracellular replication in TLR4, TLR2 and TLR4/2 knockout cells was not altered and the infection course and anti-Brucella immunity development upon BrLPS injection was unaffected in TLR4 mutant mice.We propose that Brucella has developed a stealth strategy through PAMPs reduction, modification and hiding, ensuring by this manner low stimulatory activity and toxicity for cells. This strategy allows Brucella to reach its replication niche before activation of antimicrobial mechanisms by adaptive immunity. This model is consistent with clinical profiles observed in humans and natural hosts at the onset of infection and could be valid for those intracellular pathogens phylogenetically related to Brucella that also cause long lasting infections."
https://openalex.org/W2032313226,"The progression of progenitors to oligodendrocytes requires proliferative arrest and the activation of a transcriptional program of differentiation. While regulation of cell cycle exit has been extensively characterized, the molecular mechanisms responsible for the initiation of differentiation remain ill-defined. Here, we identify the transcription factor Yin Yang 1 (YY1) as a critical regulator of oligodendrocyte progenitor differentiation. Conditional ablation of yy1 in the oligodendrocyte lineage in vivo induces a phenotype characterized by defective myelination, ataxia, and tremor. At the cellular level, lack of yy1 arrests differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitors after they exit from the cell cycle. At the molecular level, YY1 acts as a lineage-specific repressor of transcriptional inhibitors of myelin gene expression (Tcf4 and Id4), by recruiting histone deacetylase-1 to their promoters during oligodendrocyte differentiation. Thus, we identify YY1 as an essential component of the transcriptional network regulating the transition of oligodendrocyte progenitors from cell cycle exit to differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2113038626,"The complement system is an important immune mechanism mediating both recognition and elimination of foreign bodies. The lectin pathway is one pathway of three by which the complement system is activated. The characteristic protease of this pathway is Mannan-binding lectin (MBL)-associated serine protease 2 (MASP2), which cleaves complement proteins C2 and C4. We present a novel and alternative role of MASP2 in the innate immune system. We have shown that MASP2 is capable of promoting fibrinogen turnover by cleavage of prothrombin, generating thrombin. By using a truncated active form of MASP2 as well as full-length MASP2 in complex with MBL, we have shown that the thrombin generated is active and can cleave both factor XIII and fibrinogen, forming cross-linked fibrin. To explore the biological significance of these findings we showed that fibrin was covalently bound on a bacterial surface to which MBL/MASP2 complexes were bound. These findings suggest that, as has been proposed for invertebrates, limited clotting may contribute to the innate immune response."

Cyclic 3‚Ä≤,5‚Ä≤-guanylyl and adenylyl nucleotides function as second messengers in signal transduction pathways of eukaryotes and prokaryotes. The synthesis of these molecules is catalyzed by a wide variety of nucleotidyl cyclases, which are active as homo- or heterodimers (1Sinha S.C. Sprang S.R. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2006; 157: 105-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Monocyclic nucleotidyl cyclases that catalyze the formation of cAMP or cGMP are regulated by small molecules, endogenous domains, or exogenous protein partners, many of which alter the interface of the catalytic domains and therefore the integrity of the catalytic site. Much less is known about catalysis and regulation mechanisms of the recently discovered family of diguanylate cyclases (DGCs). 3The abbreviations used are:DGCdiguanylate cyclasec-di-GMPcyclic diguanylic acidSECsize-exclusion chromatographyITCisothermal titration calorimetryDSSdisuccinimidyl suberatePVDFpolyvinylidene difluorideGFPgreen fluorescent protein.3The abbreviations used are:DGCdiguanylate cyclasec-di-GMPcyclic diguanylic acidSECsize-exclusion chromatographyITCisothermal titration calorimetryDSSdisuccinimidyl suberatePVDFpolyvinylidene difluorideGFPgreen fluorescent protein. DGCs are responsible for the synthesis of cyclic di-GMP, a ubiquitous second messenger involved in bacterial bio-film formation and persistence (2Jenal U. Malone J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2006; 40: 385-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Cellular levels of c-di-GMP are controlled through the opposing activities of DGCs and phosphodiesterases, which form two large families of output domains found in bacterial one- and two-component systems (3Ulrich L.E. Koonin E.V. Zhulin I.B. Trends Microbiol. 2005; 13: 52-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). The DGC activity is contained within the highly conserved GGDEF domain, whose three-dimensional fold is similar to the catalytic core of adenylate cyclase and the ‚Äúpalm‚Äù domain of DNA polymerases (4Paul R. Weiser S. Amiot N.C. Chan C. Schirmer T. Giese B. Jenal U. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 715-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 5Chan C. Paul R. Samoray D. Amiot N.C. Giese B. Jenal U.

Because GGDEF domains are often associated with sensory input domains, it was proposed that these regulatory proteins serve to directly couple environmental or internal stimuli to a specific cellular response through the synthesis of the second messenger c-di-GMP. Similar to monocyclic nucleotidyl cyclases, the controlled formation of catalytically competent GGDEF domain dimers may be a key mode of DGC regulation (2Jenal U. Malone J. Annu. Rev.

PleD is an unorthodox member of the response regulator family of two-component signal transduction systems with two receiver domains arranged in tandem fused to a GGDEF output domain (5Chan C. Paul R. Samoray D. Amiot N.C. Giese B. Jenal U. Schirmer T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 17084-17089Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation by two cognate kinases, PleC and DivJ, is required for the activation and dynamic sequestration of PleD to the differentiating pole (4Paul R. Weiser S. Amiot N.C. Chan C. Schirmer T. Giese B. Jenal U. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 715-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 9Aldridge P. Paul R. Goymer P. Rainey P. Jenal U. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 1695-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Although the first receiver domain (Rec1) serves as phosphoryl acceptor (at the conserved Asp-53 residue), the second receiver domain (Rec2) was proposed to function as an adaptor for dimerization of activated PleD (5Chan C. Paul R. Samoray D. Amiot N.C. Giese B. Jenal U. Schirmer T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 17084-17089Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 9Aldridge P. Paul R. Goymer P. Rainey P. Jenal U. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 1695-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). A simple mechanistic model for the activation of PleD proposes that phosphorylation at the conserved Asp-53 of Rec1 induces repacking of the Rec1/Rec2 interface. This in turn would mediate dimer formation by isologous Rec1-Rec2 contacts across the interface and thereby facilitate reorientation and assembly of two C-terminal DGC domains (5Chan C. Paul R. Samoray D. Amiot N.C. Giese B. Jenal U. Schirmer T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 17084-17089Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that PleD activity can be greatly stimulated in vitro by the phosphoryl mimic BeF3 and that activation of PleD results in dimer formation. Cross-linking experiments revealed that the DGC activity resides entirely in the dimer fraction of activated PleD. Furthermore, controlled dimerization not only modulates DGC activity but is also employed to couple PleD activity to its subcellular sequestration. This is the first demonstration that GGDEF protein dimers represent the active conformation of diguanylate cyclases and confirms that oligomerization can be used to regulate the activity of this abundant class of signaling proteins.

Open table in a new tab Expression and Purification of PleD‚ÄîE. coli cells carrying the respective expression plasmid were grown in 200 ml of LB medium with ampicillin (100 Œºg/ml), and expression was induced by adding isopropyl 1-thio-Œ≤-d-galactopyranoside to 0.4 mm final concentration. After harvesting by centrifugation, the cells were resuspended in TN buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl at pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm Œ≤-mercaptoethanol) and lysed by passage through a French press cell. The suspension was clarified by centrifugation, followed by a high spin centrifugation step (100,000 √ó g, 1 h). The supernatant was loaded onto Ni-NTA affinity resin (Qiagen), washed with TN buffer, and eluted with an imidazole gradient. Elution fractions were examined for purity by SDS-PAGE, and fractions containing pure protein were pooled. PleD was extensively dialyzed first against 500 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 5 mm Œ≤-mercaptoethanol, and than against 250 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 5 mm Œ≤-mercaptoethanol. Prior to cross-linking experiments PleD was dialyzed against a buffer containing 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm PO4, and 5 mm Œ≤-mercaptoethanol. Analytical size exclusion chromatography (SEC) was performed with a Superdex 200 column on a SMART system (Amersham Biosciences) at a flow rate of 50 Œºl/min. Preparative SEC to quantitatively strip nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-purified PleD from bound c-di-GMP was performed on a preparative scale Superdex 200 column on an AEKTA system (Amersham Biosciences). Enzymatic Assays‚ÄîDiguanylate cyclase assays were adapted from procedures described previously (Paul et al. 4). The standard reaction mixtures with purified PleD contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 250 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2 in a 50-Œºl volume and were started by adding 100 Œºm GTP/[Œ±-33P]GTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, 0.01 ŒºCi/Œºl). To calculate the initial velocity of product formation, aliquots were withdrawn at regular time intervals, and the reaction was stopped with an equal volume of 50 mm EDTA, pH 6.0. Reaction products (2 Œºl) were separated on polyethyleneimine-cellulose plates (Macherey-Nagel) in 1.5 m KH2PO4/5.5 M (NH4)2SO4 (pH 3.5), mixed in a 2:1 ratio. Plates were exposed to a phosphorimaging screen, and the intensity of the various radioactive species was calculated by quantifying the intensities of the relevant spots using Image-QuaNT software (Amersham Biosciences). Measurements were always restricted to the linear range of product formation. Cross-linking Assays‚ÄîThe purified protein (20 or 25 Œºm in 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm NaPO4, pH 7.8, 10 mm MgCl2,5 mm Œ≤-mercaptoethanol, ¬± 1 mm BeCl2/10 mm NaF) was incubated with 2 mm disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS, Pierce) for 0, 1, 5, and 10 min. The cross-linker was inactivated by adding Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, to 50 mm final concentration. After separation on 10% SDS-PAGE and transfer to a PVDF membrane, PleD monomeric and dimeric forms were detected by staining with an anti-PleD antibody (8Aldridge P. Jenal U. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 379-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Isothermal Titration Calorimetry‚ÄîThe interaction of PleD with cyclic-di-GMP was measured with a VP-ITC isothermal titration calorimeter from MicroCal (Northampton, MA), with 3 Œºm PleD in the cell and 90 Œºm c-di-GMP in the syringe (buffer: 100 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm Œ≤-mercaptoethanol). All solutions were thoroughly degassed and equilibrated to 25 ¬∞C before filling into the calorimeter. The delay between the injections was set to 5‚Äì10 min to ensure complete re-equilibration between subsequent injections. The heat capacity of the interaction between the inhibitor and the protein was estimated through measurements between 5 and 25 ¬∞C. Microscopy and Photography‚ÄîC. crescentus strains were grown in 5 ml of peptone-yeast extract media containing 5 Œºg/ml tetracycline (PYE/tet) for 18 h at 30 ¬∞C on a roller incubator. The stationary phase cultures were diluted 1/50 and grown for another 8‚Äì10 h in 5 ml of PYE/tet. For fluorescence imaging 1 Œºl of bacterial culture was placed on a microscope slide layered with a pad of 2% agarose dissolved in water. An Olympus IX71 microscope equipped with an UPlanSApo 100√ó/1.40 oil objective (Olympus) and a coolSNAP HQ (Photometrics) charge-coupled device camera were used to take differential interference contrast and fluorescence photomicrographs. For GFP fluorescence fluorescein isothiocyanate filter sets (Ex 490/20 nm, Em 528/38 nm) were used with exposure times of 0.15 and 1.0 s, respectively. Images were processed with softWoRx version 3.3.6 and Photoshop CS version 8.0. Activation of the PleD Diguanylate Cyclase by Beryllium Fluoride‚ÄîTo investigate the specific requirements for PleD DGC activity and activation in vitro, we first set out to define the optimal reaction conditions with respect to pH, the concentrations of monovalent and divalent cations, and protein concentration. PleD was enzymatically active between pH 6.5 and 10.0, with maximal activity between pH 7.5 and 8.5 (supplemental Fig. S1). Enzymatic activity was strictly dependent on the presence of either Mg2+ (supplemental Fig. S1) or Mn2+ (not shown), with Mn2+ resulting in a slightly higher activity compared with Mg2+. The strict requirement for bivalent cations is in agreement with the recent finding of coordinating metal ions in the catalytic center of the PleD DGC (11Wassmann P. Chan C. Beck A. Heerklotz H. Paul R. Jenal U. Schirmer T. Structure. 2007; 15: 915-927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Activity decreased with increasing NaCl concentration (supplemental Fig. S1). Also, the addition of KCl (25 mm) to reaction assays (4Paul R. Weiser S. Amiot N.C. Chan C. Schirmer T. Giese B. Jenal U. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 715-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar) slightly decreased the enzymatic activity and was omitted in subsequent experiments. Activation of the PleD DGC in vitro and in vivo requires the transfer of a phosphoryl group onto the aspartic acid acceptor residue Asp-53 of the first receiver domain (Fig. 1) (4Paul R. Weiser S. Amiot N.C. Chan C. Schirmer T. Giese B. Jenal U. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 715-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). However, in vitro phosphorylation experiments with PleD resulted in an exiguous increase of DGC activity, possibly due to suboptimal assay conditions or to low stability of the phosphorylated form (4Paul R. Weiser S. Amiot N.C. Chan C. Schirmer T. Giese B. Jenal U. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 715-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). For this reason we tested activation of PleD by beryllium fluoride (BeF3) a molecular mimic of a phosphoryl group that has been widely used for biochemical and structural studies of bacterial response regulators (12Yan D.

Structure. 2005; 13: 1353-1363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, BeF3 significantly stimulated the enzymatic activity of PleD, with optimal concentrations of 1 mm BeCl2 (Fig. 2A) and 10 mm NaF (Fig. 2B), respectively. DGC activation was reversible and was immediately abolished upon removal of BeF3 (data not shown). A PleD mutant protein lacking the phosphoryl acceptor site Asp-53 (PleDD53N) could not be activated, suggesting that BeF3 activates the protein by specifically interacting with this residue in the first receiver domain (Fig. 2C). A constitutively active mutant of PleD, PleD* (4Paul R. Weiser S. Amiot N.C. Chan C. Schirmer T. Giese B. Jenal U. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 715-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar) was also stimulated by BeF3, but only by a factor of 2 (data not shown). This is consistent with the view that PleD* is locked in an active state (see below). Concentrations of BeCl2 or NaF above 1 mm and 10 mm, respectively, had a negative effect on DGC activity (Fig. 2, A‚ÄìC). At these concentrations BeF3 probably interacts nonspecifically with surface residues that are required for diguanylate cyclase activity.FIGURE 2Beryllium fluoride-mediated activation of the PleD diaguanylate cyclase.

This suggested that PleD might be active in a dimeric (or oligomeric) form, with dimer formation being concentration-dependent. The observation that PleD* and BeF3 activated PleD reach an activity plateau at much lower protein concentrations than non-activated PleD further suggested that the PleD dimerization constant is affected either by genetic changes or by chemical activation of the protein. To test this hypothesis, cross-linking studies were performed with PleD using the chemical cross-linker DSS (see ‚ÄúMaterials and Methods‚Äù). We reasoned that the amount of covalently cross-linked dimers was proportional to the amount of dimers in solution. When the DSS cross-linker was incubated with non-activated wild-type PleD or PleDD53N at a protein concentration of 20 Œºm (well below the estimated dissociation constant Kd of dimerization of 104 Œºm (11Wassmann P. Chan C. Beck A. Heerklotz H. Paul R. Jenal U. Schirmer T. Structure. 2007; 15: 915-927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar)), only a minor fraction of the protein was captured as covalently cross-linked dimers (Fig. 3A). This is consistent with the low basal level of enzymatic activity observed for non-activated PleD (Table 1). Activation of PleD by BeF3 not only increased DGC activity (Table 1) but also the amount of cross-linked dimer species (Fig. 3A). In contrast, the non-activable PleDD53N (Fig. 2 and Table 1) showed no increase in cross-linked dimers (Fig. 3A). The crystal structure of non-activated PleD predicted a specific dimerization interface in the Rec1-Rec2 receiver domain stem with a small contact patch around the surface exposed Tyr residue at position 26 of the first receiver domain (Fig. 1). Tyr-26 is strictly conserved in PleD homologs that share a Rec1-Rec2-DGC domain structure, but not in response regulators with a different domain architecture (supplemental Fig. S2). To test if this residue plays a role in PleD dimerization, DGC activity and dimerization behavior of the PleDY26A mutant protein were analyzed. Indeed, PleDY26A was completely inactive in the absence and only marginally active in the presence of BeF3 (Table 1). Consistent with this, only a minor fraction of the protein could be cross-linked in the dimer form, irrespectively of the presence of BeF3 (Fig. 3A). In agreement with these in vitro data, the pleDY26A allele failed to complement the pleiotropic developmental defects of a C. crescentus pleD null mutant. Together these results strongly support the view that Tyr-26 residue forms part of the interaction surface of PleD dimers. This is consistent with the finding that, although additional inter-chain contacts are formed in the crystal structure of BeF3 activated PleD, the specific contact around Tyr-26 is maintained (11Wassmann P. Chan C. Beck A. Heerklotz H. Paul R. Jenal U. Schirmer T. Structure. 2007; 15: 915-927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The Diguanylate Cyclase Activity of PleD Resides in the Dimer Fraction‚ÄîAs indicated by cross-linking, PleD forms dimers in the presence of BeF3. To investigate if the enzymatic activity coincided with the cross-linked PleD fractions, reactions were diluted 10-fold immediately after DSS treatment and quenching. At this BeF3 concentration PleD showed only residual DGC activity (Fig. 2). As shown in Fig. 3B, cross-linking of BeF3-activated PleD resulted in a 6-fold increase of DGC activity as compared with non-cross-linked samples. In contrast, cross-linking of PleD in the absence of BeF3 and cross-linking of PleDD53N either in the presence or absence of BeF3 did not result in increased DGC activity. Taken together, these results suggested that, in the presence of BeF3, a fraction of the PleD protein is trapped by DSS cross-link in a dimerized form and that the dimer represents the active conformation of PleD. To further substantiate this idea we attempted to separate active dimers from inactive monomers by SEC (see ‚ÄúMaterials and Methods‚Äù). Only PleD, but not PleDD53N, changed its apparent molecular size in the presence of BeF3 (Fig. 4, A and B). However, in contrast to the constitutive active PleD*, which is present predominantly as a dimer (Fig. 4C), BeF3-activated PleD did not show resolved monomer and dimer peaks. Rather, the broadening of the PleD peak and its shift to a higher apparent molecular mass are consistent with a rapid equilibrium between monomers and dimers for the activated PleD. Only when BeF3-activated PleD was cross-linked with DSS before SEC, defined monomer and dimer peaks were observed (Fig. 4D). The peak corresponding to cross-linked PleD dimers was considerably smaller than the monomer peak indicating that only a minor fraction of PleD was trapped in the dimeric form. This was confirmed by immunoblot experiments with anti-PleD antibodies that also showed an increase of the dimer form (fractions 11 and 12) in BeF3-treated samples (Fig. 4F). Nevertheless, the dimer fractions almost exclusively accounted for the detectable DGC activity (Fig. 4E). The observations that BeF3 treatment increased the proportion of PleD dimers and that isolated dimers exhibited high DGC activity are in support of an ‚Äúactivation by dimerization‚Äù mechanism. DGC Activity Is Not Required for PleD Dimerization‚ÄîTo demonstrate that dimerization is required, but not sufficient for diguanylate cyclase activity, we analyzed if the PleDE370Q mutant formed dimers. The conserved Glu-370 residue is part of the A-site signature sequence GG(E/D)EF of the PleD diguanylate cyclase domain and was proposed to coordinate a Mg2+ ion in the active site required for deprotonation of the 3‚Ä≤-OH group of one GTP substrate molecule and its subsequent nucleophilic attack onto the Œ±-phosphate of the other GTP molecule. As predicted, the PleDE370Q mutant lacked detectable enzymatic activity both in the presence and absence of BeF3 (data not shown). We even failed to detect any enzymatic activity when the protein concentration was increased to >50 Œºm and with prolonged incubation times. However, in contrast to PleDY26A the lack of activity was not due to a failure to dimerize. When BeF3-activated PleDE370Q was used in cross-link experiments, the behavior of the mutant form was indistinguishable from PleD wild type (supplemental Fig. S3). Thus, dimerization is clearly a prerequisite for, rather than a consequence of diguanylate cyclase activity. Activation of the PleD Diguanylate Cyclase Does Not Interfere with Feedback Inhibition‚ÄîThe diguanylate cyclase activity of PleD is subject to strong product inhibition through binding of c-di-GMP to an allosteric I-site widely conserved among GGDEF domain proteins (5Chan C.

To test if PleD activation with BeF3 interferes with allosteric control, binding of c-di-GMP to the I-site was directly measured using ITC (Fig. 5). Integration of the titration peaks of c-di-GMP injected from the syringe into the cell of the calorimeter containing PleD produced a sigmoidal enthalpy curve for the interaction between PleD and c-di-GMP. The slope of the binding curve implies a dissociation constant of 0.3 Œºm (¬±0.1 Œºm). This is in good agreement with the Ki of 0.5 Œºm determined earlier (5Chan C. Paul R. Samoray D. Amiot N.C.

When binding of c-di-GMP to PleD was compared in the non-activated and BeF3-activated conformation, both binding affinity (0.4 ¬± 0.1 Œºm) and stoichiometry (2.1:1 ¬± 0.2) did not change significantly upon activation. In agreement with this, the IC50 values for PleD inhibition measured at a protein concentration of 5 Œºm were very similar for the non-activated (5.1 ¬± 1.4 Œºm) and the BeF3-activated (5.9 ¬± 1.3 Œºm) PleD.

We used adaptation to quantify the effect of feature-based attention on orientation-selective responses in human visual cortex. Observers were adapted to two superimposed oblique gratings while attending to one grating only. We measured the magnitude of attention-induced orientation-selective adaptation both psychophysically, by the behavioral tilt aftereffect, and physiologically, using fMRI response adaptation. We found evidence for orientation-selective attentional modulation of neuronal responses-a lower fMRI response for the attended than the unattended orientation-in multiple visual areas, and a significant correlation between the magnitude of the tilt aftereffect and that of fMRI response adaptation in V1, the earliest site of orientation coding. These results show that feature-based attention can selectively increase the response of neuronal subpopulations that prefer the attended feature, even when the attended and unattended features are coded in the same visual areas and share the same retinotopic location."
https://openalex.org/W2154711012,"Many investigations have reported the successful mapping of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for gene expression phenotypes (eQTLs). Local eQTLs, where expression phenotypes map to the genes themselves, are of especially great interest, because they are direct candidates for previously mapped physiological QTLs. Here we show that many mapped local eQTLs in genetical genomics experiments do not reflect actual expression differences caused by sequence polymorphisms in cis-acting factors changing mRNA levels. Instead they indicate hybridization differences caused by sequence polymorphisms in the mRNA region that is targeted by the microarray probes. Many such polymorphisms can be detected by a sensitive and novel statistical approach that takes the individual probe signals into account. Applying this approach to recent mouse and human eQTL data, we demonstrate that indeed many local eQTLs are falsely reported as ""cis-acting"" or ""cis"" and can be successfully detected and eliminated with this approach."

To identify residues contributing to virus/cell interaction, we performed point mutational analysis of the HPV16 major capsid protein, L1, targeting surface-exposed amino acid residues. Replacement of lysine residues 278, 356, or 361 for alanine reduced cell binding and infectivity of pseudovirions. Various combinations of these amino acid exchanges further decreased cell attachment and infectivity with residual infectivity of less than 5% for the triple mutant, suggesting that these lysine residues cooperate in HS binding. Single, double, or triple exchanges for arginine did not impair infectivity, demonstrating that interaction is dependent on charge distribution rather than sequence-specific. The lysine residues are located within a pocket on the capsomere surface, which was previously proposed as the putative receptor binding site. Fab fragments of binding-neutralizing antibody H16.56E that recognize an epitope directly adjacent to lysine residues strongly reduced HS-mediated cell binding, further corroborating our findings. In contrast, mutation of basic surface residues located in the cleft between capsomeres outside this pocket did not significantly reduce interaction with HS or resulted in assembly-deficient proteins. Computer-simulated heparin docking suggested that all three lysine residues can form hydrogen bonds with 2-O-, 6-O-, and N-sulfate groups of a single HS molecule with a minimal saccharide domain length of eight monomer units.

Some of them, including HPV type 16 (HPV16), are the primary etiologic agent for anogenital tumors, especially cervical carcinoma (1McMurray H.R. Nguyen D. Westbrook T.F. McCance D.J. Int. J. Exp. Pathol. 2001; 82: 15-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). To initiate a successful life cycle, viruses need to attach to host cells. This is achieved by binding to cell surface receptor molecules, which can be proteins or sugar or lipid components. Specific attachment will then initiate internalization, which is followed by amplification of the viral genome and finally production of progeny virus. Certain HPVs of the genus of Œ±-Papillomavirus have been shown to use cell surface proteoglycans as initial attachment receptors; the target glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains have been tentatively identified as heparan sulfate (HS) (2Giroglou T.

Cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), mainly syndecans and glypicans, are composed of a protein core with covalently attached HS chains. These unbranched polysaccharides are generated through a process initiated by polymerization of glucuronic acid and N-acetylglucosamine units in alternating sequence (5Esko J.D. Lindahl U. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). This backbone undergoes a series of modifications, including N-deacetylation and N-sulfation of the glucosamine units, C-5 epimerization of glucuronic to iduronic acid residues, and finally O-sulfation at the 2-O-position of hexuronic acid and at the 3-O- and 6-O-positions of glucosamine units (5Esko J.D. Lindahl U. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). The modification reactions are incomplete yet strictly regulated and give rise to a large number of distinct HS species that appear to be cell/tissue-specific. HS chains serve as ligands for a large number of proteins and thus influence a wealth of biological processes of importance to development and homeostasis. However, they have also been implicated as receptors for a growing number of viruses including dengue virus (6Chen Y. Maguire T. Hileman R.E. Fromm J.R. Esko J.D. Linhardt R.J. Marks R.M. Nat.

Not much is known about the viral components contributing to the interaction with HSPG. The papillomavirus shell is composed of 360 copies of the major capsid protein, L1, organized into 72 pentameric capsomeres and a small number of the minor capsid protein, L2. This protein shell encapsidates a circularized double-stranded DNA genome of ‚àº8000 bp. Because HPVs are difficult to propagate in vitro due to their dependence on terminally differentiating keratinocytes for completion of their life cycle, DNA-free virus-like particles (VLPs) and DNA-containing pseudoviruses have been used to study HPV/cell interaction (25Selinka H.C. Sapp M. Papillomavirus Rep. 2003; 14: 259-265Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). L2 protein does not seem to contribute to the initial binding to HSPG as VLPs and pseudovirions composed of L1 protein alone can bind to cell surface-exposed proteoglycan as well as to heparin, a highly sulfated form of HS secreted by mast cells. Interaction of HPV with heparin requires an intact outer surface conformation (26Rommel O. Dillner J. Fligge C. Bergsdorf C. Wang X. Selinka H.C. Sapp M. J. Med.

Virol. 2003; 77: 12961-12967Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) suggesting that the cluster of basic amino acids, as usually required for this type of interaction, is conformational rather than linear. To identify regions of L1 protein involved in GAG binding, we performed site-directed mutagenesis of basic and polar residues located on the capsid surface of HPV16. We also determined the minimal saccharide length required for binding to papillomavirus capsids and evaluated the contribution of variously positioned sulfate groups. Moreover a molecular model is presented to illustrate how three amino acid residues, lysines 278, 356, and 361, may collectively mediate the interaction of HPV with HS-related GAG. Plasmids and Mutagenesis-Expression plasmids carrying codon-modified HPV16 L1 and L2 structural genes have been reported previously (28Leder C. Kleinschmidt J.A. Wiethe C. MuÃàller M. J.

For each HPV16 L1 exchange mutant, two complementary PCR primers of 30-40 nucleotides were used to introduce an alanine (GCC) or arginine (CGG) instead of a lysine, arginine, or threonine codon. During PCR the whole pUF3 plasmid was amplified, then the PCR products were digested with DpnI to remove methylated template DNA, and the remaining mutant plasmids were transformed. The mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Cell Culture-COS-7 cells were maintained at 37 ¬∞C and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics.

Briefly expression plasmids carrying codon-optimized wt or mutant HPV16 L1 genes, respectively, were co-transfected with a codon-modified L2 expression plasmid and a marker plasmid coding for green fluorescent protein. After 48 h, the transfected 293TT cells were suspended in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing calcium and magnesium (DPBS, Invitrogen) supplemented with 9.5 mm MgCl2. After sonication for 20 s, 0.5% non-ionic detergent Brij 58 (Sigma) and 0.2% Benzonase (Sigma) were added, and the samples were incubated at 37 ¬∞C for 16-20 h. The nuclease-digested lysates were chilled on ice, adjusted to 0.8 m NaCl, incubated on ice for 10 min, and then clarified by centrifugation at 2,000 √ó g for 10 min at 4 ¬∞C.

After centrifugation, fractions were collected and tested on SDS-PAGE, and gradient fractions containing appreciable amounts of capsid proteins were used for analysis. Pseudoviruses were quantitated by Western blot and conformation-dependent enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting-Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (10% resolving gel, 5% stacking gel) and electrically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Capsid proteins L1 and L2 were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence Western blot analysis using the monoclonal antibodies 16L1-312F and 33L2-1 (32Volpers C. Sapp M. Snijders P.J. Walboomers J.M.

Unckell F. Schirmacher P. Streeck R.E. Sapp M. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3258-3264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of pseudovirions was determined in the presence or absence of antibody H16.56E or its Fab fragments. To generate these Fab fragments, antibody-containing cell culture supernatants (100 Œºl) were digested for 90 min with 3 Œºl of papain (P3125, Sigma; 27 Œºg/ml) in the presence of 10 mm cysteine basically following the procedure described by Johnstone and Thorpe (35Johnstone A. Thorpe R. Immunochemistry in Practice, 2nd Ed. 1987; : 55-59Google Scholar). Full antibody controls were mock-treated for 90 min in the absence of papain. Subsequently both Fab fragments and undigested H16.56E antibodies were used in cell binding assays. After binding, cells were extensively washed with PBS to remove unbound pseudovirions, lysed in Laemmli sample buffer, incubated at 100 ¬∞C for 5 min, and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting for the detection of cell surface-bound HPV16 L1 protein. Pseudovirus Infection Assay-293TT cells were grown in 24-well plates and infected with mutant and wt pseudovirions from OptiPrep gradients (5000-8000 infectious units/well for wt and corresponding amounts of assembled L1 protein for mutants) in a total volume of 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing supplements. The cells were grown at 37 ¬∞C for 72 h before manually counting cells with nuclear green fluorescence to determine infectious events. ELISA-ELISA microtiter plates (BD‚Ñ¢ Heparin Binding Plate, BD Biosciences) were coated with 25 Œºg/ml heparin (H4784, Sigma) or heparan sulfate (H9902, Sigma) overnight at room temperature. Subsequently the plates were washed with PBS, 0.2% Tween 20 (PBST). Free binding sites were blocked with 2% milk in PBST for 1 h at 37¬∞C. Mutant and wt pseudovirions were diluted in PBS (0.5 Œºg/ml) in the absence or presence of 250 Œºg/ml heparin (H4784, Sigma). After preincubation for 30 min at room temperature, pseudovirions were added to the plates in replicates and bound for 1 h at 37¬∞C. Subsequently wells were incubated with primary antibody solution (polyclonal antiserum K75) for 1 h at 37¬∞C. Bound pseudovirions were detected by the addition of horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody for 30 min at 37 ¬∞C. The assays were developed with trimethylbenzidine (Moss, Inc.) and stopped with 1 n HCl. Absorbance was measured at 450 nm using a Multiscan RC plate reader (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Heparin and heparan sulfate binding was normalized with an ELISA detecting directly coupled pseudovirions that was always run in parallel as described previously (26Rommel O. Dillner J. Fligge C.

The purified pseudovirions were directly spotted onto carbon-coated copper grids, washed with water three times, and negatively stained with 2% phosphotungstic acid. Grids were observed, and photomicrographs were obtained with a Zeiss EM900 transmission electron microscope or a Philips Tecnai 12 transmission electron microscope at an instrumental magnification of √ó50,000. Graphics and Docking Simulation-The crystal structure of HPV16 L1 particle (36Chen X.S. Garcea R.L. Goldberg I. Casini G. Harrison S.C. Mol.

After docking, an energy minimization was performed to optimize the interactions in the model. Radiolabeling of Heparin and Heparin Fragments-Bovine lung heparin (The Upjohn Co.) was purified as described previously (37Lindahl U. Cifonelli J.A. Lindahl B. Roden L. J. Biol.

Radiolabeled, size-defined heparin oligosaccharides were produced by partial deamination with HNO2, pH 1.5, reduced with NaB3H4 (20-25 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) to a specific activity of 0.5 √ó 106 dpm/nmol oligosaccharide, and separated according to size on a Bio-Gel P-10 (Bio-Rad) column (1 √ó 146 cm) as described before (39Spillmann D.

Polysaccharide concentration was assessed by colorimetric determination of hexuronic acid using the meta-hydroxydiphenyl method (40Blumenkrantz N. Asboe-Hansen G. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 54: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (6019) Google Scholar) with glucuronic acid as a standard. A factor of 3 was arbitrarily used to convert values to saccharide mass. Chemical Modification of Heparin-Selective chemical desulfation of heparin was performed as described previously (39Spillmann D. Witt D. Lindahl U. J. Biol.

In short, the pyridinium salt of heparin was N-desulfated by solvolysis in Me2SO/H2O (43Inoue Y. Nagasawa K. Carbohydr.

For 2-O-desulfation the sodium salt of heparin was adjusted to pH 12.5 and lyophilized (45Jaseja M. Rej R.N. Sauriol F. Perlin A.S. Can. J.

Interaction of HPV16L1L2 with Heparin and Size-defined Heparin Oligosaccharides-3H-Radiolabeled heparin (‚àº0.5 Œºg) or size-defined oligosaccharides (4-26-mer; ‚àº3 pmol of fragments each) were incubated with 5 Œºg of HPV16L1L2 VLPs in 200 Œºl of PBS for 1 h at room temperature as described previously (46Kreuger J. Lindahl U. Jemth P. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 363: 327-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Protein along with any bound oligosaccharides was trapped on a nitrocellulose filter (diameter, 25 mm; Sartorius). The filter was washed with the incubation buffer, protein-bound oligosaccharides were dissociated from the membrane in 2 m NaCl, and the radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting. For competition assays selectively desulfated heparin preparations were added at the indicated concentrations together with 3H-labeled heparin (‚àº0.5 Œºg), and the assay was performed as described above. VLPs instead of pseudovirions were used because of easier availability of large quantities. Key experiments were repeated with pseudovirions as stated in the text. Surface-exposed Basic Amino Acid Residues of HPV16 L1-The attachment of viruses to cell surface proteoglycans is mainly governed by electrostatic interactions of basic amino acids with the negatively charged sulfate and carboxyl groups of the GAG side chains. A preliminary analysis of the electrostatic potential of the HPV16 capsomere surface using the Insight2000 software package revealed the presence of 15 highly positive charged amino acid residues present on the tip of the capsomere. These are lysine residues at HPV16 L1 positions 278, 356, and 361 and are contributed by the five L1 molecules found in a capsomere (see Fig. 4A). Additional surface-exposed basic amino acid residues are found in the BC loop (Lys-54, Lys-55, and Lys-59) located at the upper outer rim of the capsomere and deep in the cleft between capsomeres (Arg-74, Lys-82, Arg-97, and Lys-443). Virion Assembly of L1 Mutants-To investigate the role of positively charged amino acid residues in papillomavirus cell interaction, a point mutational analysis was performed. Using codon-optimized HPV16 L1, we substituted the residues for alanine or arginine as single, double, and triple mutants. These mutants were co-transfected with wt HPV16 L2 and a green fluorescent protein-based reporter plasmid into 293TT cells. Under these conditions, L1 and L2 self-assemble into pseudovirions and encapsidate the reporter plasmid, allowing easy scoring of infection by counting green fluorescent protein-expressing cells (29Buck C.B. Pastrana D.V. Lowy D.R. Schiller J.T. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 751-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Pseudoviruses were extracted and purified by OptiPrep gradient centrifugation, and fractions were analyzed for the presence of L1 and L2 by Western blot analysis. Mutants K54A, R74A, and K82A were assembly-deficient as evidenced by the lack of L1 and L2 in pseudovirus-harboring fractions, although all were expressed at levels comparable to wt L1 after transfection of cells. In addition, viral particles could not be detected by electron microscopy (data not shown). Therefore, these mutants had to be excluded from further analysis. Analysis of the additional lysines in the BC loop (Lys-55 and Lys-59) was not pursued because antibody binding to this loop does not block cell attachment and binding to heparin-coated ELISA plates (47Roth S.D. Sapp M. Streeck R.E. Selinka H.C. Virol. J. 2006; 3: 83Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, all other mutants yielded pseudoviruses. L2 protein was found co-migrating with L1 proteins in these gradients, indicative of particle formation with incorporated L2 protein. The level of L2 incorporation was similar for all wt and mutant capsids, although the yield of pseudoviruses differed somewhat between preparations due to differences in transfection efficiencies. The formation of intact particles was further confirmed by probing particles with conformation-dependent antibodies (not shown) and by electron microscopy (Fig. 1B). At 50,000-fold magnification no significant differences were observed between wt and mutant pseudovirions. All HPV particles, containing either single, double, or triple lysine or arginine to alanine mutations, were of the same size as wt particles and displayed the characteristic features of the icosahedral HPV capsids. Cell Binding of Mutant Pseudovirions-To analyze the attachment of wt and mutant HPV pseudovirions to cell surface GAGs, binding studies were performed. Monolayer COS-7 cells were incubated with similar amounts of pseudovirions at subsaturating levels, and bound particles were detected by L1-specific Western blot analysis performed essentially as described before (34Volpers C. Unckell F. Schirmacher P. Streeck R.E. Sapp M. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3258-3264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because it is important for these assays to utilize similar amounts of pseudovirions, pseudovirus preparations were normalized by L1-specific Western blot and ELISA using HPV16 VLP antisera that detect conformationally intact L1 protein. A representative binding assay is depicted in Fig. 2A. Strongest binding was observed with wt pseudovirions. Mutant R97A displayed binding comparable to wt pseudovirions, whereas the lysine to alanine single mutants K278A, K356A, and K361A showed a reduced binding to cells. Among these, K356A binding was most prominent in all assays, whereas K361A displayed the lowest binding. Replacement of two (K278A/K361A and K356A/K361A) and three lysine residues (K278A/K356A/K361A) resulted in an even further reduction in cell binding, suggesting that these lysine residues, which are located in close proximity on the capsomere tip, may cooperatively contribute to interaction with the cell surface. With mutant K443A only a slight reduction was observed. Heparin drastically decreased cell binding of wt and mutant pseudovirions as expected for interaction with cell surface proteoglycan. Nevertheless a low background binding was observed even in the presence of heparin (Fig. 2B). Because heparin blocks infection completely under the chosen conditions (48Giroglou T. Sapp M. Lane C. Fligge C. Christensen N.D. Streeck R."
https://openalex.org/W1990957877,"We analyzed the influence of the transcription factor DeltaFosB on learned helplessness, an animal model of affective disorder wherein a subset of mice exposed to inescapable stress (IS) develop a deficit in escape behavior. Repeated IS induces DeltaFosB in the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG), and levels of the protein are highly predictive of an individual's subsequent behavorial deficit-with the strongest DeltaFosB induction observed in the most resilient animals. Induction of DeltaFosB by IS predominates in substance P-positive neurons in the vlPAG, and the substance P gene, a direct target for DeltaFosB, is downregulated upon DeltaFosB induction. Local overexpression of DeltaFosB in the vlPAG using viral-mediated gene transfer dramatically reduces depression-like behaviors and inhibits stress-induced release of substance P. These results indicate that IS-induced accumulation of DeltaFosB in the vlPAG desensitizes substance P neurons enriched in this area and opposes behavioral despair by promoting active defense responses."
https://openalex.org/W2071472192,"Ticks are blood-feeding parasites that secrete a number of immuno-modulatory factors to evade the host immune response. Saliva isolated from different species of ticks has recently been shown to contain chemokine neutralizing activity. To characterize this activity, we constructed a cDNA library from the salivary glands of the common brown dog tick, Rhipicephalus sanguineus. Pools of cDNA clones from the library were transfected into HEK293 cells, and the conditioned media from the transfected cells were tested for chemokine binding activity by chemical cross-linking to radiolabeled CCL3 followed by SDS-PAGE. By de-convolution of a single positive pool of 270 clones, we identified a full-length cDNA encoding a protein of 114 amino acids, which after signal peptide cleavage was predicted to yield a mature protein of 94 amino acids that we called Evasin-1. Recombinant Evasin-1 was produced in HEK293 cells and in insect cells. Using surface plasmon resonance we were able to show that Evasin-1 was exquisitely selective for 3 CC chemokines, CCL3 and CCL4 and the closely related chemokine CCL18, with KD values of 0.16, 0.81, and 3.21 nm, respectively. The affinities for CCL3 and CCL4 were confirmed in competition receptor binding assays. Analysis by size exclusion chromatography demonstrated that Evasin-1 was monomeric and formed a 1:1 complex with CCL3. Thus, unlike the other chemokine-binding proteins identified to date from viruses and from the parasitic worm Schistosoma mansoni, Evasin-1 is highly specific for a subgroup of CC chemokines, which may reflect a specific role for these chemokines in host defense against parasites.

Ticks are blood-feeding external parasites that can infest a wide variety of mammals, including humans. The hard tick species, or Ixodidae, are characterized by the fact that they feed for extended periods of time on their hosts, ranging from a few days to 2‚Äì3 weeks depending on the stage in the life cycle and on the species. The normal mammalian response to parasites that penetrate the skin is to unleash an immunological response aimed at destroying or neutralizing the foreign agent. The tick has to block these responses to survive and feed successfully. To do this ticks have developed an armory of anti-inflammatory, anti-coagulant, and anti-pain molecules that they inject into their hosts, allowing them to remain essentially undetected while they feed (1Ribeiro J.M. Infect. Agents Dis. 1995; 4: 143-152PubMed Google Scholar, 2Ribeiro J.M. Makoul G.T. Levine J. Robinson D.R. Spielman A. J. Exp.

Many tick-borne pathogens such as the lyme disease-causing bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi and viruses (Rocky Mountain spotted fever, Colorado fever, tick-borne encephalitis virus) are also thought to exploit these activities to facilitate their own transmission and replication (4Nuttall P.A.

Chemokines are small chemoattractant cytokines that are key mediators of the inflammatory response against parasites. They alert the immune system to the assault and play an important role in recruiting specific leukocyte populations to the site of infection to destroy the invader. Many pathogenic microorganisms including viruses and protozoa have developed immune evasion strategies based on the interference of cytokine- and chemokine-mediated inflammatory signals. Over the last few years a number of distinct chemokine-binding proteins (CKBPs) 4The abbreviations used are:CKBPchemokine-binding proteinPBSphosphate-buffered proteinRANTESregulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secretedBS3bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberateNi-NTAnickel-nitrilotriacetic acidMALDI-TOFmatrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flightSPAscintillation proximity assayCHOChinese hamster ovaryHEKhuman embryonic kidneySPRsurface plasmon resonance have been isolated from members of the herpes and pox family of viruses, which have been shown to inhibit chemokine activity both in vitro and in vivo and play an important role in immune evasion (for reviews, see Refs. 8Alcami A.

For example, deletion of the gene encoding the broad spectrum chemokine-binding protein, M-T1, from myxoma virus resulted in an extensive leukocyte infiltration in the dermis of the infected rabbits that could be substantially inhibited when animals were infected by the wild type virus, demonstrating that the virus had evolved a mechanism that prevented the recruitment of leukocytes to the site of infection in the form of a chemokine-binding protein (10Graham K.A.

We have, therefore, used an expression cloning approach to identify chemokine-binding proteins secreted in tick saliva. A cDNA library was prepared from salivary glands, resected from the ixodid tick, Rhipicephalus sanguineus (common brown dog tick), during feeding. A chemokine cross-linking assay was used to detect chemokine binding activity in conditioned medium harvested from HEK293 cells which had been transfected with the tick salivary gland cDNA library. Using this method we identified a family of chemokine-binding proteins that we have termed Evasins. In this paper we describe the cloning and characterization of Evasin-1, a CC chemokine-binding protein highly specific for CCL3, CCL4, and CCL18 (Pulmonary and activation-regulated chemokine (PARC)). Reagents and Recombinant Chemokines‚ÄîUnless otherwise stated all reagents and chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). 125I-Radiolabeled chemokines and chromatographic materials were obtained from GE Healthcare. Chemokines were purified as described previously (14Proudfoot A.E. Borlat F. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 138: 75-87PubMed Google Scholar). The cDNA encoding the ectromelia virus chemokine-binding protein (GenBank‚Ñ¢/EBI Data Bank accession number AJ277111) was kindly provided by Dr. A. Alcami (University of Cambridge). The cowpox virus CKBP p35 protein was a gift from Dr. D. B. Wigley (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Boston, MA). Preparation of Tick Saliva‚ÄîR. sanguineus ticks were laboratory-reared as previously described (15Ferreira B.R. Machado R.Z. Bechara G.H. Vet. Parasitol. 1996; 62: 161-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). All ticks used for infestations were 1‚Äì3-month-old adults. To obtain engorged ticks for saliva collection, 20 dogs were infested with 70 pairs of adult R. sanguineus ticks contained in plastic feeding chambers fixed to their backs. The saliva-collection procedure was performed using engorged female ticks (after 3‚Äì5 days of feeding) by inoculation of 10‚Äì15 Œºl of a 0.2% (v/v) solution of dopamine in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, using a 12.7 √ó 0.33-mm gauge needle (BD Biosciences). Saliva was harvested using a micropipette and placed on ice. Pooled saliva samples were centrifuged through a 0.22-Œºm pore filter (Costar-Corning, Inc., Cambridge, MA) and stored at -20 ¬∞C until further use. Each saliva pool consisted of material harvested from more than 200 female ticks. The saliva protein concentration, determined using a bicinchoninic acid solution (Sigma), ranged from 1000 to 2000 Œºg/ml. Chemical Cross-linking Assay‚ÄîLyophilized, iodinated chemokines were resuspended at 0.23 nm in 50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin and incubated with 10 Œºl of conditioned media from transfected HEK293 cells or with 10 Œºl of tick saliva in the presence or absence of 25 mm bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (BS3) in a final volume of 50 Œºl for 2 h at room temperature with shaking. The cross-linking reaction was quenched by the addition of 5 Œºl of 10√ó SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and scanned using a Personal FX phosphorimaging system (Bio-Rad) at a resolution of 100 Œºm. Construction of a Tick Salivary Gland cDNA Library‚ÄîTick salivary glands were dissected, rinsed with ice-cold PBS, and stored in RNAlater‚Ñ¢ solution (50 mg of tissue/ml) (Ambion, Inc., Canada) at -70 ¬∞C until use. Total RNA was extracted from ‚àº50 mg of salivary glands using TRIzol‚Ñ¢ (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's directions. A tick salivary gland cDNA library was constructed using a SMART¬Æ cDNA library construction kit (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) according to the manufacturer's directions. An aliquot of the resultant ŒªTriplEx2 phage cDNA library containing 2 √ó 106 plaque-forming units was converted into a plasmid cDNA library in pTriplEx2 in BM25.8 cells according to the manufacturer's protocol. The pTriplEx2 cDNA library was stored at -80 ¬∞C in LB medium containing 50% glycerol. For subcloning of the cDNA library into the mammalian cell expression vector, pEXP-Lib (Clontech), plasmid DNA was prepared from a 5-ml overnight bacterial culture inoculated with 5 Œºl of the glycerol stock (containing 1 √ó 108 colony-forming units) using the Wizard¬Æ Plus SV Minipreps DNA purification system (Promega, Madison, WI). The resultant plasmid DNA was digested with SfiI, fractionated on a 1.1% agarose gel and cDNA inserts were excised and purified using the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Basel, Switzerland) according to manufacturer's instructions. The cDNA inserts were ligated into SfiI-digested and dephosphorylated, pEXP-Lib vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA, USA) using the Quick Ligation‚Ñ¢ Kit (New England Biolabs). Ligation reactions were transformed by heat shock into UltraMAX DH5alpha-FT competent cells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The pEXP-Lib cDNA library transformation mix was titered and plated at ‚àº100 colonies per 10 cm diameter LB-agar plate containing 50 Œºg/ml ampicillin. A total of 120 plates were prepared and grown for ‚àº18 h at 37 ¬∞C, to yield large colonies (‚àº2 mm diameter). Bacterial colonies were harvested in 5 ml LB medium by scraping the plates with a sterile, triangular plastic loop. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 3500 rpm for 10 min at 4 ¬∞C. Plasmid DNA was prepared from each pool using a BioRobot 8000 (Qiagen) and stored at‚Äì20 ¬∞C in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8. Transfection of HEK293 Cells‚ÄîHEK293 cells were maintained in a 5% CO2, humidified incubator in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-F-12 Nut medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen), and 1% 100√ó penicillin-streptomycin solution (Invitrogen). The day before transfection a confluent culture of HEK293 cells was harvested by trypsinization and seeded at ‚àº2 √ó 104 cells/well in a 96-well plate that had been precoated with 10 Œºg/ml poly-d-lysine hydrobromide. The next day cells were transfected with 100 ng of plasmid DNA using the Geneporter2 transfection kit (Gene Therapy Systems) using the manufacturer's protocol for low concentration DNA and adherent cells and incubated at 37 ¬∞C for 3‚Äì4 days. The conditioned medium was then harvested, cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatants stored frozen at -80 ¬∞C until further use. Expression Cloning‚ÄîApproximately 80‚Äì130 ng of plasmid DNA from each library pool or the positive control plasmid was transfected into HEK293 cells as described above. For the positive controls we used the pEXP-lib vector containing the p35 or vCCI cDNA-coding sequence. Cell culture supernatants (200 Œºl) were harvested 3 days after transfection and stored frozen. Before use culture supernatants were thawed and concentrated four times using a speed vacuum system. The concentrated culture supernatant (conditioned medium) was tested in a cross-linking assay using 125I-labeled CCL3 as described above. Plasmid DNA from pools that gave a positive signal in the cross-linking assay were retransformed into Escherichia coli, and the transformation mixes plated on 10-cm-diameter LB-amp plates to yield ‚àº100 colonies per plate. Plasmid DNA was then prepared from 100 individual colonies and re-transfected into HEK293 cells. The conditioned medium from each transfection was harvested after 3 days and retested in the cross-linking assay using 125I-labeled CCL3 as described above. Plasmid DNA derived from individual colonies which gave a positive signal in the cross-linking assay was sequenced on an Applied Biosystems 3700 DNA sequencer using a T7 and pEXP-Lib-3‚Ä≤ reverse primer (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). The plasmid, which contained the cDNA sequence encoding the CCL3-binding protein (pEXP-Lib-Evasin-1), was subsequently used as a PCR template to generate a six-histidine (His)-tagged version of the cDNA, which was subcloned into the baculovirus vector, pDEST8 (Invitrogen), and into the mammalian cell expression vector pEAK12d (Edge Biosystems) using the Gateway‚Ñ¢ cloning system (Invitrogen). Purification of Evasin-1 from Insect and Mammalian Cells‚ÄîEvasin-1 with a C-terminal His tag was expressed in Trichoplusia ni (TN)5 insect cells using the baculovirus transduction system or was transiently expressed in HEK293 cells. Conditioned medium from transfected TN5 cells was harvested 72 h post-infection. Conditioned medium from HEK293 cells was harvested 6 days after transfection. The conditioned medium was diluted 8-fold for TN5 expression or 2-fold for expression in HEK293 cells in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.3 m NaCl and 10% (v/v) glycerol, respectively, before purification by nickel-affinity chromatography (Ni-NTA-agarose, Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and gels were stained with Coomassie Blue. The pooled peak fractions containing Evasin-1 were dialyzed against PBS and further purified by Sephadex 200 (GE Healthcare) size exclusion chromatography. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Two additional gels were run with the same samples and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-His antibodies (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions and by cross-linking to 125I-labeled CCL3. Evasin-1-containing fractions were pooled, and aliquots were stored at -80 ¬∞C until further use or dialyzed against NH4HCO3 and lyophilized. Physicochemical Characterization‚ÄîN-terminal sequence analysis of Evasin-1 was performed using an Applied Biosystems 475A protein sequenator with on-line phenylthiohydantoin derivative detection. MALDI-TOF spectra were obtained on a Voyager DE-PRO Biospectrometry Work station (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The instrument was calibrated over the mass range of interest using a standard set of reference proteins provided by the manufacturer. Sinapinic acid was used as the matrix. Size exclusion chromatography was performed by injecting 200 Œºl of a 1 mg/ml solution onto an analytical Sephadex 75 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) previously equilibrated in PBS and eluted at 0.5 ml/min. Elution profiles were monitored by UV absorption at 280 nm. The void volume (V0) was determined with blue dextran, and the column was calibrated with the following standards purchased from GE Healthcare: albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), chymotrypsinogen (20.4 kDa), and ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa). Deglycosylation‚ÄîEvasin-1 produced in TN5 insect cells was subjected to enzymatic deglycosylation with endoglycosidase Hf and peptide-N-glycosidase F (New England Biolabs). A solution of 1 mg/ml Evasin-1 in 50 mm sodium citrate buffer, pH 5.5, was incubated with 25,000 units of endoglycosidase Hf at room temperature for 10 h. A second digestion with peptide-N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) was carried out by incubating 1 mg/ml Evasin-1 in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 10% Nonidet P-40 with 12,500 units of PNGase F at room temperature. The extent of digestion was followed by SDS-PAGE. Surface Plasmon Resonance‚ÄîReal-time biomolecular interaction analyses were performed using a Biacore 3000 surface plasmon resonance (SPR) system. Recombinant Evasin-1-His was resuspended at 50 Œºg/ml in 10 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.5, and directly immobilized on the flow cell of a CM4 chip (Biacore) by a standard amine coupling chemistry according to the manufacturer's instructions using the Biacore 3000 Wizard software. Approximately 750 response units of Evasin-1-His were coupled to the cell using this method. A blank cell was prepared using the chemical coupling as a control in the absence of protein. Experiments were performed at 25 ¬∞C with a flow rate of 30 Œºl/min using HBS-P running buffer (0.01 m HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, and 0.005% surfactant P20) (Biacore). For all binding experiments chemokines were resuspended at 0.1 Œºg/ml in running buffer and filtered through a 0.22-Œºm filter. The injection time was 2 min followed by a dissociation time of 2.5 min after injection. The chip was regenerated using 50 mm glycine buffer, pH 2.0, for 30 s. For each experiment chemokines were injected in triplicate in random order. For the kinetic experiments, serial 2-fold dilutions of CCL3 (ranging from 25 to 1.5 ng/ml), CCL4 (ranging from 50 to 3 ng/ml), CCL18 (ranging from 0.5 Œºg/ml to 50 ng/ml) were prepared in running buffer, filtered through a 0.22-Œºm filter, and injected over the experimental blank flow cells. The injection time was 3 min followed by a dissociation time of 15 min. The chip was regenerated using 50 mm glycine buffer, pH 2 for 30 s. Each chemokine dilution was injected in triplicate in random order. For the analysis the sensograms from the blank cell in addition to the sensograms obtained with the running buffer alone were subtracted from the binding to remove the nonspecific background. For the kinetic analyses the association (ka) and the dissociation (kd) values were determined simultaneously by globally fitting sensograms for an entire range of chemokine concentrations according to the 1:1 Langmuir fitting model. The apparent equilibrium dissociation constants (KD) were determined from the mean kinetics values with the equation KD = kd/ka. Saturation Binding‚ÄîA saturation binding experiment was used to determine the affinity constant of 125I-labeled CCL3 binding to Evasin-1 using an scintillation proximity assay (SPA). His-tagged Evasin-1 (40 pm) was incubated with increasing concentrations of 125I-labeled CCL3 with or without a 500-fold excess of unlabeled CCL3 in 75 Œºl of PBS, pH 7.2 containing 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.2% bovine serum albumin. Copper chelate-coated polyvinyl toluene-SPA beads containing scintillant (Amersham Biosciences RPNQ0095) (350 Œºg) were added in 25 Œºl of PBS and incubated for 72 h at room temperature with shaking. Competition of heparin for the binding of Evasin-1 to CCL3 was determined by the inclusion of heparin ranging from 1 √ó 10-3 to 1 √ó 103 Œºg/ml in the assay. The amount of bound 125I-labeled CCL3 was determined by measurement of the radioactivity using a Œ≤ counter. Nonspecific binding, determined in the presence of a 500-fold excess of unlabeled CCL3, was subtracted and represented between 2 and 4.1% of the total counts bound per minute. The ability of Evasin-1 to bind to a chemokine receptor was investigated using iodinated Evasin-1 (custom product from GE Healthcare, specific activity 222 Ci/mmol) and CCR1 expressed in CHO membranes. Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism software. Measurements were performed in duplicate. Equilibrium Competition Receptor Binding‚ÄîThe ability of Evasin-1 to inhibit binding of radiolabeled CCL3 and CCL4 (GE Healthcare) to their cognate receptors was determined using a SPA. Membranes expressing recombinant CCR1 and CCR5 were prepared as described (16Alouani S. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 138: 135-141PubMed Google Scholar). Serial dilutions of Evasin-1 were prepared in binding buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2 containing 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.15 m NaCl, and 0.5% bovine serum albumin) to cover the concentration ranges shown in Fig. 5. Wheat germ agglutinin SPA beads (Amersham Biosciences) were suspended in binding buffer at 10 mg/ml, and the final concentration in the assay was 0.25 mg/well. CHO cell membranes expressing CCR1 or CCR5 were diluted in binding buffer to 80 Œºg/ml. Equal volumes of membrane and bead stocks were mixed before performing the assay to reduce background. The final membrane concentration in the assay was 2 Œºg/ml, and that of 125I-labeled CCL3 and CCL4 was 0.1 nm. The plates were incubated at room temperature with shaking for 4 h. Measurements were performed in triplicate. Stoichiometry of the Evasin-1-CCL3 Complex‚ÄîThe apparent molecular mass of Evasin-1 in the presence of CCL3 or CXCL8 was analyzed by size exclusion chromatography as described above with a 1 mg/ml solution of Evasin-1 in PBS or a mixture of Evasin-1 and CCL3 or CXCL8, both at 0.5 mg/ml, in PBS. The fractions were analyzed on SDS-PAGE gels stained with Coomassie Blue. Identification of a CCL3-binding Protein in Tick Saliva‚ÄîThe existence of a chemokine-binding protein in tick saliva was demonstrated by the detection of a radiolabeled band migrating between 25 and 35 kDa after autoradiography of an SDS-PAGE gel following incubation of tick saliva with 125I-labeled CCL3 in the presence of the chemical cross-linker, BS3 (Fig. 1A). This cross-linking assay was subsequently used to screen conditioned media from HEK293 cells transiently transfected with a tick salivary gland cDNA library for the presence of the CCL3-binding protein. Construction and Screening of a Tick Salivary Gland cDNA Expression Library‚ÄîTotal RNA was extracted from salivary glands derived from ‚àº50 female R. sanguineus adult ticks that had engorged on dogs for 5 days. Total RNA was used to prepare a directionally cloned cDNA library in the phage vector, ŒªTriplEx2. The resultant library contained ‚àº0.575 √ó 106 independent clones with an average insert size of between 0.3 and 1.5 kilobases. An aliquot of the phage library was then converted into a pTriplEx2 plasmid library. cDNA inserts were excised together from the pTriplEx2 cDNA library using SfiI and ligated into the mammalian cell expression vector, pEXP-lib. Plasmid DNA was prepared from 93 pools of clones, each containing ‚àº85‚Äì100 independent cDNAs. Pools were screened by transfecting HEK293/EBNA cells followed by testing of the conditioned media for cross-linking activity to 125I-labeled CCL3. Plasmid DNA from one of the pools which gave a positive signal in the cross-linking assay was retransformed into E. coli, and plasmid DNA isolated from 96 individual colonies was tested by transfection and cross-linking as described above. This process was repeated until a single cDNA (clone 59) giving rise to a positive signal in the cross-linking assay was identified (Fig. 1b, lane 3). The cDNA insert sequence in clone 59 appeared to be a full-length DNA with an open reading frame of 339 bp encoding a protein of 114 amino acids with a predicted signal peptide of 20 amino acids, which when cleaved gives rise to a mature protein of 94 amino acids, which we called Evasin-1 (Fig. 2). The cDNA contains a single AATTAA polyadenylation site which spans the stop codon. Data base searches indicated that the Evasin-1 cDNA sequence showed no significant homology to any other protein, nucleic acid sequence, or conserved domain by NCBI blast of public databases including available tick genome databases. The predicted mass of Evasin-1 is 10,466 Da, and the predicted isoelectric point is 4.29. The mature protein contains eight cysteine residues, suggesting the presence of four disulfide bonds. There are also three predicted N-linked glycosylation sites in the mature protein sequence. Given that the 125I-labeled chemokine migrates at 8 kDa, it appears that the binding protein produced by the tick is heavily glycosylated, as it migrates with a mass ranging from ‚àº17‚Äì27 kDa, which is considerably larger than the predicted mass. Protein Purification and Characterization of Evasin-1‚ÄîThe cDNA sequence encoding the predicted open reading frame of Evasin-1 was subcloned with a C-terminal His tag for expression of the recombinant protein in insect (TN5) and mammalian (HEK293/EBNA) cells. Evasin-1 was well secreted in both expression systems. Elution from the Ni-NTA column was accompanied by high Mr-contaminating proteins which were easily removed by size exclusion chromatography as shown for the HEK protein in Fig. 1c. This chromatographic step clearly demonstrated the extent of glycosylation resulting in a mass distribution during size exclusion chromatography, but the identity of the different forms was confirmed by Western blot with an anti-His antibody (Fig. 1d), and activity of all the glycosylated forms was demonstrated by the cross-linking assay (Fig. 1e). The recombinant protein expressed in mammalian and insect cell systems showed considerable differences in migration behavior on SDS-PAGE. Recombinant Evasin-1 from HEK293 cells migrated as a broad band between 20 and 30 kDa, whereas Evasin-1 produced in insect cells migrated as a broad band between 15 and 25 kDa (Fig. 3a). Because the His tag at the C terminus was present in both proteins, allowing capture on the Ni-NTA resin, and the N-terminal sequencing showed that the signal sequence was removed in both expression systems according to the in silico prediction (results not shown), the differences in mass were attributed to post-translational modifications, most likely, glycosylation. Treatment of Evasin-1 with a glycosidase (peptide-N-glycosidase F) or Evasin-1 produced by transfected cells cultured in the presence of tunicamycin resulted in a band migrating at 12 kDa, confirming that the mass differences could be solely due to differential glycosylation (Fig. 3a). The apparent molecular mass determined by size exclusion chromatography of insect cell expressed Evasin-1 was 22 kDa, and that of the mammalian expressed Evasin-1 was 31 kDa (data not shown), in accordance with their differential migration pattern on SDS-PAGE. Analysis by isoelectric focusing showed that the major difference in glycosylation appears to be in sialyation. The protein expressed in mammalian cells showed a typical ladder pattern on isoelectric focusing characteristic of sialylated proteins, whereas the insect-der"

Autonomous gestures, also known as emblems, are highly social in nature, and convey conventionalized meaning without accompanying speech. To study the neural bases of cross-cultural social communication, we used single pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to measure corticospinal excitability (CSE) during observation of culture-specific emblems. Foreign Nicaraguan and familiar American emblems as well as meaningless control gestures were performed by both a Euro-American and a Nicaraguan actor. Euro-American participants demonstrated higher CSE during observation of the American compared to the Nicaraguan actor. This motor resonance phenomenon may reflect ethnic and cultural ingroup familiarity effects. However, participants also demonstrated a nearly significant (p = 0.053) actor by emblem interaction whereby both Nicaraguan and American emblems performed by the American actor elicited similar CSE, whereas Nicaraguan emblems performed by the Nicaraguan actor yielded higher CSE than American emblems. The latter result cannot be interpreted simply as an effect of ethnic ingroup familiarity. Thus, a likely explanation of these findings is that motor resonance is modulated by interacting biological and cultural factors."

We used enzymes and pharmacological agents to distinguish the relative roles of gangliosides and NgRs in MAG-mediated inhibition of neurite outgrowth from three nerve cell types, dorsal root ganglion neurons (DRGNs), cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs), and hippocampal neurons. Primary rat neurons were cultured on control substrata and substrata adsorbed with full-length native MAG extracted from purified myelin.

Knowledge of myelin-derived ARIs, their receptors on axons, and the downstream signaling pathways that limit axon outgrowth may provide new opportunities to reverse inhibition and enhance recovery after traumatic central nervous system injury (3David S.

One well established inhibitor of axon regeneration is myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), a transmembrane protein of the immunoglobulin superfamily that is expressed on the innermost wrap of myelin directly apposed to the axon surface. MAG is essential to the long term stability of myelinated axons and positively regulates axon cytoarchitecture (5Quarles R.H. J. Neurochem. 2007; 100: 1431-1448PubMed Google Scholar). However, in the injured nervous system, MAG on residual myelin membranes at sites of injury, as well as a proteolytic fragment of MAG released into the surrounding milieu, binds to receptors on axons resulting in activation of RhoA and halting axon outgrowth (6McKerracher L.

The identity of the axonal receptors for MAG has been a matter of controversy. As a member of the Siglec family of sialic acid-binding lectins, MAG binds with selectivity to two closely related major sialoglycans expressed on axons and neurons throughout the brain, gangliosides GD1a and GT1b (10Varki A.

Functional studies using cultured neurons revealed that gangliosides are required for MAG-mediated inhibition of axon outgrowth and that interfering with ganglioside expression or blocking MAG-ganglioside binding reversed inhibition (12Vyas A.A.

In an effort to reconcile these discrepancies, we considered whether gangliosides and NgRs function independently or cooperatively on different nerve cell types or in response to different physical forms of MAG (membrane-bound and soluble). Our results indicate that gangliosides and NgRs can act independently as receptors for both membrane-bound and soluble forms of MAG and that different nerve cell types use different MAG receptors.

Briefly tissue was treated with 20 units/ml papain and 0.05 mg/ml DNase at 37 ¬∞C for 30 min and triturated with a fire-polished Pasteur pipette. Cells were collected by centrifugation (300 √ó g for 7 min), and the pellet was resuspended in buffer containing ovomucoid. Cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in growth medium (minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) containing 25 mm Hepes, 25 mm KCl, 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated horse serum, 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 Œºg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm l-glutamine), plated (55,000 cells in 100 Œºl/well) on 96-well plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) precoated with 125 Œºg/ml poly-d-lysine (molecular weight, >300,000), and cultured at 37 ¬∞C in a 5% CO2 incubator for 48 h. Hippocampal Neurons (HNs)-Rat hippocampal neurons were prepared essentially as described previously (23Brewer G.J. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1997; 71: 143-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Hippocampi of postnatal day 4‚Äì5 rats were dissected into ice-cold medium (98% HibernateA (BrainBits, Springfield, IL) and 2% B-27 supplement). After removal of meninges, the tissue was cut into small pieces, and then papain (Worthington, 2 mg/ml in medium) was added. After 30 min at 37 ¬∞C with gentle agitation, the tissue was allowed to settle, the papain solution was decanted, and medium was added. After 5 min at ambient temperature, tissue was disaggregated using a fire-polished Pasteur pipette, and the cell suspension was layered above a solution of 15% Nycodenz (Axis-Shield, Oslo, Norway) in medium and centrifuged (800 √ó g for 15 min) at ambient temperature. Cells were resuspended in HibernateA, collected by centrifugation, and resuspended in growth medium (NeurobasalA (Invitrogen):B-27 (400:1) supplemented with 0.5 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 Œºg/ml streptomycin, and 5 ng/ml fibroblast growth factor 2 (Chemicon, Temecula, CA)). Cells were passed through a 40-Œºm cell strainer, plated (20,000 cells in 100 Œºl/well) on 96-well plates (Nunc) previously coated for 1 h with 125 Œºg/ml poly-d-lysine (molecular weight, >300,000), and cultured at 37 ¬∞C in a 5% CO2 incubator for 48 h. Inhibitory Substrata-MAG was extracted from purified myelin membranes using mild detergent and adsorbed to culture surfaces as described previously (12Vyas A.A. Patel H.V. Fromholt S.E.

Poduslo S.E. J. Neurochem. 1973; 21: 749-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar) from brains freshly dissected from adult Sprague-Dawley rats or adult wild type or MAG-null mice (25Pan B.

Myelin membranes were suspended at 1 mg of protein/ml in extraction buffer (0.2 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.8), 0.1 m Na2SO4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), and 1% octylglucoside), incubated at 4 ¬∞C for 16 h with gentle agitation, and then centrifuged at 100,000 √ó g for 1 h at 4¬∞C. The supernatant was collected and diluted with an equal volume of detergent-free buffer, and an aliquot (50 Œºl) was added to each well of a poly-d-lysine-coated 96-well plate (see above). After 4 h at ambient temperature, the plate was washed with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline and then with the culture medium appropriate to the cell type (see above) prior to plating freshly prepared cells. Soluble Proteolytic Fragment of Myelin-associated Glycoprotein (dMAG)-Spontaneously generated dMAG was prepared essentially as described previously (8Tang S. Woodhall R.W. Shen Y.J. DeBellard M.E. Saffell J.L. Doherty P. Walsh F.S. Filbin M.T. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 333-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Rat brain myelin was purified as described above except that protease inhibitors were omitted. Freshly purified myelin membrane was resuspended in Neurobasal medium. Aliquots containing 4‚Äì5 mg of myelin protein in 0.3 ml of Neurobasal medium were incubated at ambient temperature or 37 ¬∞C for 18‚Äì24 h. Membranes were removed by centrifugation (100,000 √ó g for 1 h at 4 ¬∞C). The supernatant, containing spontaneously released proteolytic MAG fragment, was diluted 8-fold into the medium of cultured neurons 1 h after plating. Treatment with Antibody, Enzymes, and Pharmacological Agents-Anti-MAG antibody, enzymes, and pharmacological agents were added to cultures 1 h after cell plating. None of the treatments resulted in any reduction in cell number or any change in average neurite outgrowth on control substrata (data not shown).

The inhibitory efficacy of TAT-Pep5 was confirmed by blocking pro-nerve growth factor-mediated apoptosis in hippocampal neurons, a p75-induced event (31Lee R. Kermani P. Teng K.K. Hempstead B.L. Science. 2001; 294: 1945-1948Crossref PubMed Scopus (1384) Google Scholar). Neurite Outgrowth Inhibition Assay-After 24‚Äì48 h (depending on the cell type, see above) cultures were washed with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, fixed overnight with 2% paraformaldehyde in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, and then permeabilized using 0.1% Triton X-100 in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline. DRGNs and HNs were immunostained with anti-neuronal class III Œ≤-tubulin monoclonal antibody (TUJ1, 1:2000, Covance, Berkeley, CA) followed by Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:200, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). CGNs were immunostained with GAP43 polyclonal antibody (1:1000, AbCam, Cambridge, MA) followed by Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:300, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) mixed with 300 nm 4‚Ä≤,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Invitrogen). After washing, multiple random fields were captured for image analysis using a Nikon TE300 epifluorescence microscope fitted with a Photometrics CoolSNAP HQ2 camera (Roper Scientific, Duluth, GA). Neurite outgrowth from DRGNs and HNs was quantified using Metamorph image analysis (Universal Imaging Systems, Downington, PA). Relative pixel staining intensity was assigned, and cell bodies were automatically subtracted from the image based on their high staining intensity (e.g. Fig. 1). Neurites were then quantified as the number of pixels having the intensity of neurites. That value was divided by the number of cell bodies in the field. Neurite area per cell body for each condition was normalized to the control and expressed as relative neurite outgrowth. CGNs on control substrata extend very fine axons 6The general term ‚Äúneurite‚Äù is used to describe the thin extensions from DRGNs and HNs in cell culture. Extensions from cerebellar granule neurons are termed ‚Äúaxons‚Äù because morphological and immunohistochemical criteria identify early extending neurites from rodent CGNs as axons (32Powell S.K. Rivas R.J. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Hatten M.E. J. Neurobiol. 1997; 32: 223-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). (32Powell S.K. Rivas R.J. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Hatten M.E. J. Neurobiol. 1997; 32: 223-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) that form a lacy network on the culture surface. In contrast, CGN axons on inhibitory substrata fasciculate (see Fig. 5) avoid the substratum and grow over each other. To differentiate individual axons from fasciculated axons we developed an image analysis protocol using NIS-Elements software (Nikon, Melville, NY). CGN cell bodies were identified by co-localization of anti-GAP43 and 4‚Ä≤,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining and subtracted from the image. Relative anti-GAP43 pixel staining intensity was assigned. Axons were quantified as the sum of the pixels having intensities representative of individual, unfasciculated axons. There was no significant difference in the average number of cells per field in the experimental and control conditions (data not shown). For each experimental condition four to five random images from each of 4‚Äì10 independent wells from an average of three independent experiments were analyzed. Data are presented as the means ¬± S.E. Statistical p values were obtained using Student's t test. MAG Inhibition of DRGN Neurite Outgrowth Is Primarily via NgR and Secondarily via Gangliosides-Postnatal DRGNs extended long neurites within 24 h when plated on control surfaces (Fig. 1). When the same cells were plated on wells adsorbed with extracted myelin proteins, neurite outgrowth was sharply diminished. A function-blocking anti-MAG antibody reversed 70% of the inhibition in this in vitro model. PI-PLC, which releases GPI-anchored proteins (such as NgRs) from cell surfaces (26Fournier A.E. GrandPre T. Strittmatter S.M. Nature. 2001; 409: 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar), reversed inhibition >50%, whereas sialidase, which releases MAG-binding sialic acid residues, reversed inhibition ‚àº20%. When used together, PI-PLC and sialidase reversed inhibition 71% to the same level as anti-MAG antibody. These data are consistent with an additive role of GPI-anchored proteins and sialoglycans in mediating MAG inhibition in DRGN. Specific pharmacological agents were used to further distinguish the receptors associated with MAG-mediated inhibition of DRGN neurite outgrowth (Fig. 2). Consistent with the enzyme data, addition of NEP1‚Äì40, a competitive antagonist peptide that blocks the Nogo-66/MAG binding site on NgR (14Domeniconi M. Cao Z. Spencer T. Sivasankaran R. Wang K.

Nature. 2002; 417: 547-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar), resulted in ‚àº50% reversal of myelin-mediated inhibition, whereas P4, which blocks glycosphingolipid biosynthesis including gangliosides (29Abe A. Radin N.S. Shayman J.A. Wotring L.L. Zipkin R.E. Sivakumar R. Ruggieri J.M. Carson K.G. Ganem B. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 611-621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Li R. Kong Y. Ladisch S. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), resulted in ‚àº35% reversal. A scrambled peptide control for NEP1‚Äì40 (17GrandPre T. Li S. Strittmatter S.M. Nature. 2002; 417: 547-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar) neither altered control axon outgrowth nor reversed myelin-mediated inhibition (72 ¬± 10% inhibition without peptide, 73 ¬± 4% inhibition with control peptide). The inactive (S,S) enantiomer of P4 also was without effect. Added together, NEP1‚Äì40 and P4 reversed inhibition to the same level as anti-MAG antibody. The quantitatively similar reversal of MAG inhibition of neurite outgrowth from DRGNs by PI-PLC and NEP1‚Äì40 implicates NgR as the primary receptor. Significant but quantitatively less reversal by sialidase and P4 implicates gangliosides as secondary receptors. The ability of the combined hydrolytic enzymes (or the combined inhibitors) to reverse inhibition to the same level as anti-MAG antibody suggests independent NgR and ganglioside pathways for MAG inhibition. NgR has been reported to associate laterally in the plane of the axon membrane with the neurotrophin receptor p75NTR, a transmembrane protein proposed to transduce the NgR binding response from MAG, Nogo, and OMgp to the small GTPase RhoA (34Wang K.C. Kim J.A. Sivasankaran R. Segal R. He Z. Nature. 2002; 420: 74-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar, 35Yamashita T. Higuchi H. Tohyama M. J.

Neurosci. 2002; 5: 1302-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). A cell-permeable peptide, TAT-Pep5, blocks the intracellular association of p75NTR with Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor, blocking its ability to activate RhoA (16Yamashita T. Tohyama M. Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 461-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). When added to DRGNs on myelin-adsorbed substratum, TAT-Pep5 reversed MAG-mediated inhibition ‚àº40% (Fig. 2), whereas Y-27632 (37Uehata M. Ishizaki T. Satoh H. Ono T. Kawahara T. Morishita T. Tamakawa H. Yamagami K. Inui J. Maekawa M. Narumiya S. Nature. 1997; 389: 990-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (2546) Google Scholar), which blocks Rho kinase (a downstream RhoA effector), reversed inhibition >80%. These data are consistent with p75NTR acting as a transducer for a portion of the inhibitory effect of MAG on DRGNs, whereas nearly all inhibition is via RhoA activation. Inhibition of Neurite Outgrowth from DRGNs by the Soluble Extracellular Domain of Native MAG Is via NgR-MAG exists primarily as a transmembrane protein and is found on myelin membranes at sites of central nervous system injury (5Quarles R.H. J. Neurochem. 2007; 100: 1431-1448PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, an endogenous protease cleaves a portion of MAG at the injury site, spontaneously releasing the entire extracellular domain, dMAG, which may diffuse to nearby axons and inhibit regeneration (38Tang S. Qiu J. Nikulina E. Filbin M.T. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2001; 18: 259-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). dMAG is also spontaneously released from isolated purified myelin (39Sato S. Quarles R.H. Brady R.O. Tourtellotte W.W. Ann. Neurol. 1984; 15: 264-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Because different physical forms of MAG may act via different receptors, we repeated the above experiments instead using dMAG to inhibit neurite outgrowth. dMAG was prepared by incubating purified myelin for 18‚Äì24 h in culture medium (8Tang S.

https://openalex.org/W1968040260,"Upon arriving at their targets, developing axons cease pathfinding and begin instead to arborize and form synapses. To test whether CNS arborization and synaptogenesis are controlled by Slit-Robo signaling, we followed single retinal ganglion cell (RGC) arbors over time. ast (robo2) mutant and slit1a morphant arbors had more branch tips and greater arbor area and complexity compared to wild-type and concomitantly more presumptive presynaptic sites labeled with YFP-Rab3. Increased arborization in ast was phenocopied by dominant-negative Robo2 expressed in single RGCs and rescued by full-length Robo2, indicating that Robo2 acts cell-autonomously. Time-lapse imaging revealed that ast and slit1a morphant arbors stabilized earlier than wild-type, suggesting a role for Slit-Robo signaling in preventing arbor maturation. Genetic analysis showed that Slit1a acts both through Robo2 and Robo2-independent mechanisms. Unlike previous PNS studies showing that Slits promote branching, our results show that Slits inhibit arborization and synaptogenesis in the CNS."
https://openalex.org/W2083746078,"Moderate consumption of red wine is associated with a decreased incidence of cardiovascular diseases in populations with relatively high amount of fat in the diet. However, the mechanisms involved in this protective effect are not completely understood. Here we show that moderate consumption of red wine (equivalent to 2 glasses/day in humans) but not ethanol only, improves blood flow recovery by 32% after hindlimb ischemia in hypercholesterolemic ApoE-deficient mice. In ischemic tissues, red wine consumption reduces oxidative stress and increases capillary density by 46%. Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) have been shown to have an important role in postnatal neovascularization. We found that the number of EPCs is increased by 60% in ApoE mice exposed to red wine. Moreover, the migratory capacity of EPCs is significantly improved in red wine-drinking mice. The wine used in our study is a cabernet sauvignon from Languedoc-Roussillon, France, which contains a relatively high concentration (4-6 mg/L) of the polyphenolic antioxidant resveratrol. We demonstrate that resveratrol can rescue oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL)-induced impairment of in vitro angiogenic activities in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Resveratrol exposure is also associated with increased activation of Akt/eNOS together with a restoration of nitric oxide production in HUVECs exposed to oxLDL. Our study suggests that moderate consumption of red wine improves ischemia-induced neovascularization in high-cholesterol conditions by increasing the number and the functional activities of EPCs and by restoring the Akt-eNOS-NO pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2002994930,"Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress signaling can be mediated by the ER kinase PERK, which phosphorylates its substrate eIF2alpha. This in turn, results in translational repression and the activation of downstream programs that can limit cell growth through cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis. These responses can also be initiated by perturbations in cell adhesion. Thus, we hypothesized that adhesion-dependent regulation of PERK signaling might determine cell fate. We tested this hypothesis in a model of mammary acini development, a morphogenetic process regulated in part by adhesion signaling. Here we report a novel role for PERK in limiting MCF10A mammary epithelial cell proliferation during acinar morphogenesis in 3D Matrigel culture as well as in preventing mammary tumor formation in vivo. We show that loss of adhesion to a suitable substratum induces PERK-dependent phosphorylation of eIF2alpha and selective upregulation of ATF4 and GADD153. Further, inhibition of endogenous PERK signaling during acinar morphogenesis, using two dominant-negative PERK mutants (PERK-DeltaC or PERK-K618A), does not affect apoptosis but results instead in hyper-proliferative and enlarged lumen-filled acini, devoid of proper architecture. This phenotype correlated with an adhesion-dependent increase in translation initiation, Ki67 staining and upregulation of Laminin-5, ErbB1 and ErbB2 expression. More importantly, the MCF10A cells expressing PERKDeltaC, but not a vector control, were tumorigenic in vivo upon orthotopic implantation in denuded mouse mammary fat pads. Our results reveal that the PERK pathway is responsive to adhesion-regulated signals and that it is essential for proper acinar morphogenesis and in preventing mammary tumor formation. The possibility that deficiencies in PERK signaling could lead to hyperproliferation of the mammary epithelium and increase the likelihood of tumor formation, is of significance to the understanding of breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2028455351,"Translation elongation factor eEF1A, formerly known as EF-1Œ±, exists as two variant forms; eEF1A1, which is almost ubiquitously expressed, and eEF1A2, whose expression is restricted to muscle and brain at the level of whole tissues. Expression analysis of these genes has been complicated by a general lack of availability of antibodies that specifically recognize each variant form. Wasted mice (wst/wst) have a 15.8-kilobase deletion that abolishes activity of eEF1A2, but before this study it was unknown whether the deletion also affected neighboring genes. We have generated a panel of anti-peptide antibodies and used them to show that eEF1A2 is expressed at high levels in specific cell types in tissues previously thought not to express this variant, such as pancreatic islet cells and enteroendocrine cells in colon crypts. Expression of eEF1A1 and eEF1A2 is shown to be generally mutually exclusive, and we relate the expression pattern of eEF1A2 to the phenotype seen in wasted mice. We then carried out a series of transgenic experiments to establish whether the expression of other genes is affected by the deletion in wasted mice. We show that aspects of the phenotype such as motor neuron degeneration relate precisely to the relative expression of eEF1A1 and eEF1A2, whereas the immune system abnormalities are likely to result from a stress response. We conclude that loss of eEF1A2 function is solely responsible for the abnormalities seen in these mice.

We conclude that loss of eEF1A2 function is solely responsible for the abnormalities seen in these mice. Translation elongation factor eEF1A, formerly known as EF-1Œ±, is the second most abundant protein in the cell; it is responsible for delivering aminoacylated tRNAs to the A site of the ribosome in a GTP-dependent reaction. Unusually for a translation factor, eEF1A exists as two variant forms; eEF1A1, which is almost ubiquitously expressed, and eEF1A2, whose expression is much more restricted (1Lee S. Francoeur A.M.

Biochem. 1993; 215: 549-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The two variant forms are encoded by distinct genes on different chromosomes; EEF1A1 is on 6q13 in humans and chromosome 9 in mice, and EEF1A2 is on 20q13.3 in humans and distal chromosome 2 in mice (3Lund A. Knudsen S.M. Vissing H. Clark B. Tommerup N. Genomics. 1996; 36: 359-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The encoded proteins are 92% identical and 98% similar, and eEF1A2 has been found in all mammals so far investigated in chickens and in Xenopus 3H. J. Newbery, I. Stancheva, L. B. Zimmerman, and C. M. Abbott, submitted for publication. 3H. J. Newbery, I. Stancheva, L. B. Zimmerman, and C. M. Abbott, submitted for publication. but not in Drosophila or other lower organisms, suggesting that eEF1A2 is specific to vertebrates. eEF1A1 and eEF1A2 appear to function with equivalent properties in terms of their activity in an in vitro translation assay; the only measurable difference is seen in the GDP dissociation rate, which is 7-fold higher for eEF1A1 than for eEF1A2 (4Kahns S. Lund A. Kristensen P. Knudsen C.R. Clark B.F. Cavallius J. Merrick W.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1884-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). It has been found by yeast two-hybrid analysis that eEF1A2, unlike eEF1A1, shows little or no affinity for the eEF1B guanine nucleotide exchange factors (5Mansilla F. Friis I. Jadidi M. Nielsen K.M. Clark B.F. Knudsen C.R. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 669-676Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is well established that eEF1A1, at least, has multiple non-canonical (or ‚Äúmoonlighting‚Äù) roles in addition to its role in translation. These non-canonical functions range from cytoskeletal modification (6Condeelis J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 169-170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) through targeting proteins for degradation (7Chuang S.M. Chen L. Lambertson D. Anand M. Kinzy T.G. Madura K. Mol.

Nature. 2006; 440: 556-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). It is as yet unclear to what extent eEF1A2 shares these non-canonical functions; indeed, it has been shown in cultured myotubes that whereas eEF1A1 is pro-apoptotic, eEF1A2 has anti-apoptotic activity (9Ruest L.B. Marcotte R. Wang E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5418-5425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), suggesting that the two forms may have complementary non-canonical roles. The two mammalian eEF1A variants have distinct and largely non-overlapping expression patterns. eEF1A1 is almost ubiquitously expressed. It is present throughout embryonic development but is down-regulated in neonatal muscle and ultimately shut down in mouse muscle by 21 days after birth (10Chambers D.M. Peters J. Abbott C.M. Proc.

It is not clear whether such a developmental switch exists in neurons, as extracts of whole brain show the presence of both isoforms (11Khalyfa A. Bourbeau D. Chen E. Petroulakis E. Pan J. Xu S. Wang E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22915-22922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In NIH3T3 cells, in which eEF1A2 is not normally expressed, serum deprivation induces the expression of the gene (14Ann D.K. Moutsatsos I.K. Nakamura T. Lin H.H. Mao P.L. Lee M.J. Chin S. Liem R.K. Wang E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10429-10437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of eEF1A2, thus, seems to be associated with terminal differentiation and quiescence, but its precise role is unclear nor is the reason for such tightly controlled switching between variants in muscle. In recent years two lines of evidence have implicated eEF1A2 in disease, suggesting that there may indeed be subtly different functions for the two forms of eEF1A. First, EEF1A2 has been shown to be a potential oncogene (15Anand N. Murthy S. Amann G. Wernick M. Porter L.A. Cukier I.H. Collins C. Gray J.W. Diebold J. Demetrick D.J. Lee J.M. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 301-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar); it is overexpressed in a proportion of ovarian tumors but is not expressed in normal ovary (15Anand N. Murthy S. Amann G. Wernick M. Porter L.A. Cukier I.H. Collins C. Gray J.W. Diebold J. Demetrick D.J. Lee J.M. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 301-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) and is similarly overexpressed in two-thirds of breast tumors but not normal breast tissue (16Tomlinson V.A. Newbery H.J. Wray N.R. Jackson J. Larionov A. Miller W.R. Dixon J.M. Abbott C.M. BMC Cancer. 2005; 5: 113Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In all these cases, eEF1A1 was also expressed in the tumors studied (and the tissue in which they arose) and in cell lines (16Tomlinson V.A. Newbery H.J. Wray N.R. Jackson J. Larionov A. Miller W.R. Dixon J.M. Abbott C.M. BMC Cancer. 2005; 5: 113Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). We have shown that loss of activity of eEF1A2 is implicated in the phenotype of wasted mice (10Chambers D.M. Peters J. Abbott C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4463-4468Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Wasted (wst) is a spontaneous autosomal recessive mutation of the mouse that arose in 1972 (17Shultz L.D. Sweet H.O. Davisson M.T. Coman D.R. Nature. 1982; 297: 402-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Homozygous wasted mice are characterized by weight loss, tremors, gait abnormalities, and spleen and thymus atrophy. All of these abnormalities arise after weaning, usually at 21 days. The mice then deteriorate rapidly and die by about 28 days (17Shultz L.D. Sweet H.O. Davisson M.T. Coman D.R. Nature. 1982; 297: 402-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar); this timing is unaffected by genetic background or environmental influences (18Abbott C. Malas S. Pilz A. Pate L. Ali R. Peters J. Genomics. 1994; 20: 94-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The spinal cords of wasted mice show vacuolar degeneration of motor neurons (19Lutsep H.L. Rodriguez M. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1989; 48: 519-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 20Newbery H.J. Gillingwater T.H. Dharmasaroja P. Peters J. Wharton S.B. Thomson D. Ribchester R.R. Abbott C.M. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2005; 64: 295-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and the loss of body weight is primarily accounted for by loss of muscle bulk (20Newbery H.J. Gillingwater T.H. Dharmasaroja P. Peters J. Wharton S.B. Thomson D. Ribchester R.R. Abbott C.M. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2005; 64: 295-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 21Tezuka H. Inoue T. Noguti T. Kada T. Shultz L.D. Mutat. Res. 1986; 161: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Thymuses and spleens from wasted mice show extensive, profound apoptosis (22Potter M. Bernstein A. Lee J.M. Cell Immunol. 1998; 188: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar); the spleen:body weight ratio of a wasted mouse is less than half that of a normal littermate by day 28 (17Shultz L.D. Sweet H.O. Davisson M.T. Coman D.R. Nature. 1982; 297: 402-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We found through a positional candidate cloning approach that the genetic lesion in wasted mice is a 15.8-kilobase deletion (10Chambers D.M. Peters J. Abbott C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4463-4468Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). This deletion starts in the first intron of the gene encoding eEF1A2 (locus symbol Eef1a2) and then continues 5‚Ä≤, removing the first (non-coding) exon and all promoter elements. The other end of the deletion falls within a repetitive element. Sequencing of the 15.8-kilobase region deleted in the mice did not reveal the presence of any other gene. The loss of eEF1A2 activity fits with the muscular abnormalities; the onset of the abnormal phenotype coincides with the point at which eEF1A1 is no longer detectable in muscle (10Chambers D.M. Peters J. Abbott C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4463-4468Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), but no expression analysis of eEF1A1 and eEF1A2 has yet been carried out in spinal cord, the site of the major lesion in wasted mice. Because the primary genetic defect in wasted mice is a deletion, and because the only aspect of the phenotype that could readily be explained by known expression patterns is the muscle loss, we set out to establish the precise involvement of eEF1A2 in the wasted phenotype. We also wanted to evaluate the expression patterns of eEF1A1 and eEF1A2 at the level of immunohistochemistry to see how well the expression patterns correlated with the wasted phenotype and to assess the implications for eEF1A function. In this study we address three questions. Are there cells in normal tissues that co-express eEF1A1 and eEF1A2, or is their expression mutually exclusive? If certain cells do co-express, what is the effect of deleting eEF1A2? Is loss of eEF1A2 solely responsible for the wasted phenotype? To answer these questions we developed a panel of antibodies that, unlike commercially available antibodies, specifically recognize the eEF1A1 and eEF1A2 variants. We describe the construction and characterization of these antibodies, demonstrating their specificity. We use the antibodies to show that there are sites of expression of eEF1A2 in both human and mouse that have not previously been identified. We have constructed a series of transgenic mice designed to establish which aspects of the wasted phenotype were attributable to loss of eEF1A2 and which could be caused by aberrant activity of a neighboring gene(s). We used three different constructs: a human PAC, a mouse BAC, and the same mouse BAC that had been engineered to create a deletion within the eEF1A2 gene. Although both the human PAC and mouse intact BAC rescued all aspects of the wasted phenotype, the deleted BAC failed to rescue any aspect, including the spleen and thymus atrophy. Finally, we show that expression of eEF1A variants correlates precisely with the phenotype of wasted mice. We conclude that loss of eEF1A2 expression underlies all aspects of the wasted phenotype and that eEF1A2 is essential for post-weaning survival of mice. Antibody Generation and Purification‚ÄîPeptides were generated and conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin by Zinsser Analytic (Maidenhead, Berkshire, UK). Antiserum was generated by the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service (Penicuik, Midlothian, UK). Sheep were injected monthly with 0.5 mg of KLH-conjugated peptide, and serum was withdrawn 1 week after the second, third, and fourth injections. Rabbits were injected with 0.25 mg of conjugated peptide. The immunoglobulin component of the serum was purified using ammonium sulfate precipitation as follows. Serum was mixed with 0.5 volumes saturated ammonium sulfate for 6 h or overnight at 4 ¬∞C. After centrifugation at 6000 √ó g for 30 min, the supernatant was stirred as above with an additional 0.5 volumes ammonium sulfate. After further centrifugation the pellet was dissolved in 0.3 volumes of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and dialyzed versus PBS overnight. The specific antibodies were purified from the ammonium sulfate-precipitated immunoglobulin component by immunoaffinity purification using the peptides against which the sera were raised. This was carried out using a Sulfolink kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunofluorescence‚ÄîSlides were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and subjected to antigen retrieval as described for immunohistochemistry, below. Slides were blocked with donkey serum and then incubated with anti-eEF1A antibodies diluted 1 in 10 in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min and with fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies (Alexafluor 488 anti-rabbit for eEF1A2; Alexafluor 594 anti-sheep for eEF1A1; Molecular Probes) diluted 1 in 1000 for 30 min, mounted in Vectashield (Vector, Peterborough, UK) and visualized on a Zeiss Axioskop 2 using Smartcapture software. Western Blots‚ÄîProtein lysates from cell lines were prepared using previously published protocols (23Gilmour L.M. Macleod K.G. McCaig A. Sewell J.M. Gullick W.J. Smyth J.F. Langdon S.P. Clin. Cancer Res. 2002; 8: 3933-3942PubMed Google Scholar). Western blot analyses were carried out using standard protocols. The blots were incubated with primary anti-eEF1A2 rabbit antibody and primary anti-eEF1A1 sheep antibody diluted 1:200 in blocking solution as well as primary anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase polyclonal mouse antibody (Chemicon International, Hampshire, UK) diluted 1:10,000. Blots were then incubated in the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Dako Cytomation, Cambridgeshire, UK) at 1:500. Detection was performed using enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Immunohistochemistry‚ÄîFormalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections of human and mouse tissue were deparaffinized with xylene, rehydrated, treated with picric acid, and micro-waved in citric acid pH 6. They were then treated in 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 min. Slides were blocked in a 1:5 dilution of sheep serum for 30 min at room temperature. Primary anti-eEF1A2 rabbit or sheep antibodies were used at a concentration of 1:10 diluted in phosphate-buffered saline for 40 min at room temperature and secondary anti-rabbit or anti-sheep IgG biotin-conjugated antibody (Dako Cytomation) was used at 1:200 at room temperature for 30 min. Slides were incubated with StreptABC complex/horseradish peroxidase (Dako Cytomation) at room temperature for 30 min and in diaminobenzidene (Sigma Fast DAB, Sigma) for 2 min at room temperature. Finally slides were counterstained in hematoxylin, dehydrated, and mounted in pertex. Bioinformatics‚ÄîPIP analysis was carried out using Pipmaker. Generation of Transgenic Mice‚ÄîThe human PAC (h697K14) was isolated from a chromosome 20 PAC library by Dr. Panos Deloukas at the Sanger Centre. The mouse BAC, m219F24, was described previously (10Chambers D.M. Peters J. Abbott C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4463-4468Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The modification of the BAC was achieved using the pGETrec system described by Orford et al. (24Orford M. Nefedov M. Vadolas J. Zaibak F. Williamson R. Ioannou P.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: E84Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar); the plasmid was a kind gift from Dr. Pannos Ioannou. Modified clones were detected on the basis of having the right combination of antibiotic resistance in the first instance and then by PCR and sequencing across the site of modification and restriction mapping of the whole construct. Transgenic mice were made using standard pronuclear injection methods into oocytes derived from (C57BL/6√óCBA)F1 mice. Founder mice that carried an intact transgene (checked by PCR and expression analysis) were then crossed to +/wst mice and then intercrossed to derive transgene-positive wst/wst mice. Real-time-PCR‚ÄîReal-time PCR was performed using MyCycler‚Ñ¢ Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad) in a final volume of 20 Œºl containing 10 Œºl of 2√ó iQ‚Ñ¢ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad), 0.8 Œºl of 5 Œºm concentrations of each primer, 5.5 Œºl of the template, and 2.9 Œºl of distilled H2O under the following conditions: 95 ¬∞C for 3 min followed by 50 cycles each of 95 ¬∞C 30 s, 63 ¬∞C 30 s, and 72 ¬∞C 30 s. The melting curve analysis was performed from 55 to 95 ¬∞C, and 18 S rRNA was used as an internal standard. A standard curve was generated by plotting the log10 of control template on the x axis against the Ct value from serial dilutions of target DNA on the y axis. The standard curve was linear over 5 logs (101-105 dilutions) with a correlation coefficient R2 greater than 0.99. Primer sequences were as follows: 18 S rRNA forward, 5‚Ä≤-GTAACCCGTTGAACCCCAT-3‚Ä≤, and reverse, 5‚Ä≤-CCATCCAATCGGTAGTAGCG-3‚Ä≤; Clwd forward, 5‚Ä≤-GACTACTATCGGCGACGCCTG-3‚Ä≤, and reverse, 5‚Ä≤-GATTCTGCCGAGCGCTCAGGA-3‚Ä≤. An Antibody Panel Specific for Each eEF1A Variant‚ÄîWe developed a series of antibodies that would specifically recognize eEF1A1 and, separately, eEF1A2. Peptide sequences were designed to maximize differences between the two variants while still falling in regions of high predicted antigenicity; these sequences are shown in Table 1. Keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated peptides were used to generate polyclonal antibodies in either sheep or rabbits. After affinity purification the antibodies all recognized a single band on Western blots of ‚àº50 kDa for both eEF1A1 and eEF1A2 (representative blots are shown in Fig. 1). In every case the antibodies are specific for the correct eEF1A isoform; anti-eEF1A2 antibodies recognize a band in extracts from brain and muscle but not from liver (which has been shown not to express eEF1A2 at the RNA level) or brain from wasted (wst/wst) mice, which contains eEF1A1 but not eEF1A2 because of the deletion in the mice. No null animals exist for eEF1A1, but muscle acts as a negative control as it has been shown to express only eEF1A2 by real-time-PCR; the eEF1A1 antibodies recognize a band in all tissues except adult muscle, consistent with this. The antibodies work equally well for human and mouse tissue, as expected given the almost complete conservation of sequence at the amino acid level.TABLE 1Peptide sequences used to generate antibodieseEF1A1-1KAVDKKAAGAGKVTCeEF1A2-1KNVEKKSGGAGKVTCeEF1A1-2CPYSQKRYEEIVKEVSTeEF1A2-2CAYSEKRYDEIVKEVSAeEF1A1-3TRKDGHASGTTLLEALDCeEF1A2-3CERKEGNASGVSLLEALDT Open table in a new tab Expression Analysis of eEF1A1 and eEF1A2 by Immunohistochemistry in Wild-type Mice‚ÄîWe used the antibodies for immunohistochemical analysis of tissue sections to establish the precise cell types within tissues that express each variant. No evidence for expression of eEF1A2 in spleen and thymus has been found using a variety of whole-tissue techniques, including sensitive assays such as real-time-PCR and RNase protection. Immunohistochemistry for eEF1A2 on spleen and thymus sections revealed a small number of cells that stained positive with this antibody but only in a few sections. These cells seem likely to be macrophages. There was no convincing evidence for expression of eEF1A2 in either spleen or thymus by any technique. We then went on to examine expression of eEF1A1 and eEF1A2 in spinal cord, the site of major pathological changes in wasted mice. The eEF1A2 antibodies showed very strong cytoplasmic expression in motor neurons of +/wst mice, but not in wst/wst mice, again demonstrating that the antibodies are completely specific (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, the expression pattern in spinal cord fits perfectly with the known phenotype of wasted mice; motor neurons do not express eEF1A1 in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2A), so that in wasted mice there will be no translation elongation factor activity. This goes a long way toward explaining the particular vulnerability of these cells in wasted mice. Unexpectedly, we do see some nuclear staining of eEF1A1 in motor neurons; it is unclear what role this would play or how eEF1A1, which is usually almost entirely cytoplasmic and which is normally actively exported from the nucleus by exportin 5 (25Bohnsack M.T. Regener K. Schwappach B. Saffrich R. Paraskeva E. Hartmann E. Gorlich D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6205-6215Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 26Calado A. Treichel N. Muller E.C. Otto A. Kutay U. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6216-6224Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), would become entrapped in this way. Importantly, the expression patterns of the two variants in the spinal cord is clearly mutually exclusive, with eEF1A1 antibodies staining white matter and glial cells and eEF1A2 being confined to motor neurons. We next examined expression patterns within the brain. In sections of cerebellum, the mutually exclusive staining pattern of eEF1A1 and eEF1A2 can again clearly be seen (Fig. 2B); as before, eEF1A1 is present in the white matter, whereas eEF1A2 is absent. Strong staining of eEF1A2, but not of eEF1A1, is observed in Purkinje cells; again this ties in with the phenotype of wasted mice, which have been reported to show signs of ataxia and Purkinje cell loss (17Shultz L.D. Sweet H.O. Davisson M.T. Coman D.R. Nature. 1982; 297: 402-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We went on to use two-color immunofluorescence to show that eEF1A1 and eEF1A2 are genuinely mutually exclusively expressed in brain (Fig. 2C), with eEF1A1 only seen in glial cells (and some small neuronal cells) and sole expression of eEF1A2 in most neurons. This is consistent with, but extends the observations of Pan et al. (27Pan J. Ruest L.B. Xu S. Wang E. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 2004; 149: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), who showed expression of eEF1A1 in glial cells and eEF1A2 in neuronal cells but did not directly demonstrate reciprocity of expression. Immunohistochemistry Reveals eEF1A2 Expression in Previously Unsuspected Locations‚ÄîWe then carried out immunohistochemistry of eEF1A2 in panels of normal tissues from human and mouse and found specific cell types expressing eEF1A2 in tissues that do not have detectable expression of eEF1A2 by Western blotting. Notably, eEF1A2 was expressed in specific cells in the pancreas (Fig. 3, B-D), colon (E-H), lung (I-J), and stomach (K). The eEF1A2-expressing cells in pancreas are predominantly glucagon-producing islet cells, and those in the stomach are neuroendocrine cells (we have only been able to analyze these cells in mouse). Staining of pancreas sections with the anti-eEF1A1 antibody (Fig. 3A) reveals a near reciprocal but not entirely mutually exclusive pattern of expression. Whereas eEF1A2 staining is confined to islets, eEF1A1 expression is widespread; although staining is stronger in the exocrine areas of the pancreas, there does appear to be weak staining in islet cells. Fig. 3 also shows a pancreatic islet from wild-type mouse (C) from a wst/wst mouse showing specificity of staining (D) and a human islet showing identical staining pattern in both species (B). In gut tissue, the cells expressing eEF1A2 are found toward the base of the crypts; no more than two (and usually zero or one) are ever seen in any single crypt in a given section. The eEF1A2-positive cells have a displaced nucleus, suggesting that they are enteroendocrine cells. In all cases with the possible exception of lung where staining was variable, the same cell types were seen to express eEF1A2 in both human and mouse (Fig. 3, E-H), showing that this expression pattern is conserved and suggesting a functional role for eEF1A2 in these cells. No staining with the anti-eEF1A2 antibodies was seen in other cell types within these tissues, and no obvious expression of eEF1A2 was detected in tissue sections of liver or kidney (data not shown). Wasted mice of 24 days were subjected to a detailed pathological analysis, but no changes were seen in the pancreas or gut of these mice compared with their normal littermates, potentially because even a low level of expression of eEF1A1 seen in these tissues is sufficient to protect the mice from overt damage, at least in the short term. Bioinformatic Analysis Reveals the Presence of a Novel Gene 15 Kilobases from the Wasted Deletion‚ÄîWe then went on to establish whether the phenotype of wasted mice is completely due to loss of eEF1A2 function or whether other genes could be affected by the presence of the deletion in wasted mice. We first carried out percentage identity plot analysis of the human and mouse regions surrounding the gene encoding eEF1A2; the results are shown in supplemental Fig. 1. This analysis was based on the region contained in human PAC clone h697K14 as this was to be the starting point for our transgenic experiments. No significant region of human/mouse homology was detected other than within known genes, with the exception of a 100-bp region upstream of the gene encoding eEF1A2 that showed 70% homology between human and mouse. There is no feature of this sequence which suggests that it might be coding DNA; it seems most likely to be an enhancer. Within the region deleted in wasted mice (shown in green on Fig. 4), no mouse/human homology could be detected beyond the putative eEF1A2 promoter region. The mouse BAC (m219F24) we had isolated previously (10Chambers D.M. Peters J. Abbott C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4463-4468Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) contains only two complete genes, Eef1a2 and the mouse ortholog of C20ORF149, a small gene encoding a novel protein. This BAC also"
https://openalex.org/W2002216796,"Recent studies have shown that neurodegeneration is closely related to misfolding and aggregation of neuronal tau. Our previous results show that neuronal tau aggregates in formaldehyde solution and that aggregated tau induces apoptosis of SH-SY5Y and hippocampal cells. In the present study, based on atomic force microscopy (AFM) observation, we have found that formaldehyde at low concentrations induces tau polymerization whilst acetaldehyde does not. Neuronal tau misfolds and aggregates into globular-like polymers in 0.01-0.1% formaldehyde solutions. Apart from globular-like aggregation, no fibril-like polymerization was observed when the protein was incubated with formaldehyde for 15 days. SDS-PAGE results also exhibit tau polymerizing in the presence of formaldehyde. Under the same experimental conditions, polymerization of bovine serum albumin (BSA) or alpha-synuclein was not markedly detected. Kinetic study shows that tau significantly misfolds and polymerizes in 60 minutes in 0.1% formaldehyde solution. However, presence of 10% methanol prevents protein tau from polymerization. This suggests that formaldehyde polymerization is involved in tau aggregation. Such aggregation process is probably linked to the tau's special ""worm-like"" structure, which leaves the epsilon-amino groups of Lys and thiol groups of Cys exposed to the exterior. Such a structure can easily bond to formaldehyde molecules in vitro and in vivo. Polymerizing of formaldehyde itself results in aggregation of protein tau. Immunocytochemistry and thioflavin S staining of both endogenous and exogenous tau in the presence of formaldehyde at low concentrations in the cell culture have shown that formaldehyde can induce tau into amyloid-like aggregates in vivo during apoptosis. The significant protein tau aggregation induced by formaldehyde and the severe toxicity of the aggregated tau to neural cells may suggest that toxicity of methanol and formaldehyde ingestion is related to tau misfolding and aggregation."
https://openalex.org/W2059577639,"During planning and execution of reaching movements, the activity of cortical motor neurons is modulated by a diversity of motor, sensory, and cognitive signals. Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) extract part of these modulations to directly control artificial actuators. However, cortical modulations that emerge in the novel context of operating the BMI are poorly understood.Here we analyzed the changes in neuronal modulations that occurred in different cortical motor areas as monkeys learned to use a BMI to control reaching movements. Using spike-train analysis methods we demonstrate that the modulations of the firing-rates of cortical neurons increased abruptly after the monkeys started operating the BMI. Regression analysis revealed that these enhanced modulations were not correlated with the kinematics of the movement. The initial enhancement in firing rate modulations declined gradually with subsequent training in parallel with the improvement in behavioral performance.We conclude that the enhanced modulations are related to computational tasks that are significant especially in novel motor contexts. Although the function and neuronal mechanism of the enhanced cortical modulations are open for further inquiries, we discuss their potential role in processing execution errors and representing corrective or explorative activity. These representations are expected to contribute to the formation of internal models of the external actuator and their decoding may facilitate BMI improvement."

This study compares the knowledge and attitudes towards health research between undergraduate medical students undertaking Problem Based Learning (PBL) versus conventional Lecture Based Learning (LBL). Methods Two groups comprising 66 (LBL) and 84 (PBL) 4th and 5th year students from the medical college of Aga Khan University were administered a structured and validated questionnaire. Knowledge and attitudes of the two groups were recorded on a scale (graduated in percentages) and compared for statistical difference. Results PBL students scored 54.0% while LBL students scored 55.5% on the knowledge scale [p-value; 0.63]. On the attitudes scale, PBL students scored 75.5% against a 66.7% score of LBL students [p-value; 0.021]. A higher proportion of PBL students (89%) had participated in research activities compared to LBL students (74%) and thus felt more confident in conducting research and writing a scientific paper. Conclusion The PBL students showed slightly healthier attitudes towards health research compared to LBL students. Both groups demonstrated a similar level of knowledge about health research. The positive impact of the PBL curriculum on attitudes of medical students towards health research may help in improving research output from developing countries in future."

In an ATP-dependent manner, the SMN complex assembles the seven Sm proteins into a ring onto the Sm site of snRNAs. The SMN complex is large, ‚àº60 S, quite stable for many hours, and resistant to high concentrations of salt and detergent (6Pellizzoni L. Baccon J. Rappsilber J. Mann M. Dreyfuss G. J. Biol.

In addition to these core proteins, the SMN complex is found associated with other transient or substrate proteins. Unrip, a protein found to bind the cap-independent translation factor UNR, associates with the SMN complex only in the cytoplasm via binding to Gemin6 and Gemin7 and may play a role in sequestering the SMN complex in the cytoplasm for snRNP assembly (7Carissimi C.

Additionally, each of the Sm proteins and snRNAs are associated with the SMN complex (5Liu Q. Fischer U. Wang F. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1997; 90: 1013-1021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Here we identify several stable SMN-independent subunits of the SMN complex. Gemin5, the RNA-binding protein of the complex, is found abundantly outside of the SMN complex, and some of it is associated with the DEAD-box helicase Gemin3 and Gemin4. These SMN-free complexes bind to snRNA both in vitro and in cell extract. Additionally, Gemin6 and Gemin7 form a complex with unrip. These findings demonstrate the modular nature of both the SMN complex and the snRNP assembly process and suggest that an increase in the relative amount of the SMN-independent subunits may have modifying activities in SMA.

The 10G11 immunoprecipitations were washed extensively in RSB-150 (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 2.5 mm MgCl2) with 0.01% Nonidet P-40. Sucrose Gradient Sedimentation-500 Œºl of HeLa whole cell or cytoplasmic extract at 4 mg/ml were loaded onto a 10-ml 5‚Äì20% sucrose gradient and centrifuged at 41,000 rpm for 3 h in an SW 41 Ti rotor in a Beckman Coulter Optima‚Ñ¢ XL-100K ultracentrifuge such that 100 S is at the bottom of the gradient. Twenty 0.5-ml fractions were collected, and 20 Œºl of each fraction was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. For immunoprecipitation experiments, the indicated fractions were pooled and immunoprecipitated as described above. For the longer run experiments, the sucrose gradient was centrifuged at 29,000 rpm for 15 h such that 40 S is at the bottom of the gradient. The fractions were then pooled by twos and immunoprecipitated with the stated antibodies as described above. Arsenite and Heat Shock Treatment and Indirect Immunofluorescence-HeLa PV cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). For immunofluorescence, cells were seeded onto glass coverslips the day before treatment. A solution of sodium arsenite was added directly into the culture medium to a final concentration of 1 mm, and the cells were then maintained at 37 ¬∞C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere for an additional 30 min prior to fixing. For heat shock, cells were maintained at 42 ¬∞C for 30 min prior to fixing. Indirect immunofluorescence on HeLa PV cells was performed as previously described (6Pellizzoni L. Baccon J. Rappsilber J.

The 20‚Äì35 S fractions 3‚Äì6 or the 60‚Äì80 S fractions 10‚Äì13 were pooled together and immunoprecipitated as described above with anti-Gemin5 antibody 10G11.

Following the assembly reaction, the mixture was loaded onto a 5‚Äì20% sucrose gradient and fractionated as described above. Each fraction was immunoprecipitated in a 96-well format using either anti-Sm (Y12) or anti-Gemin5 (10G11) mouse monoclonal antibodies immobilized on Dyna-beads M-280 sheep anti-mouse IgG magnetic beads (Dynal Biotech ASA, Oslo, Norway). Anti-Sm immunoprecipitations were performed as described previously, whereas anti-Gemin5 immunoprecipitations were performed similarly but in RSB-150 (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2) with 0.01% Nonidet P-40. Following extensive washing, co-precipitated biotin-labeled snRNA was detected by chemiluminescence resulting from incubation with horseradish peroxidase-coupled avidin as described previously (15Wan L.

Reduction of SMN by RNAi Results in SMN-independent Gemin Subunits-The SMN protein interacts directly with Gemin2, -3, -5, and -7 (1Baccon J. Pellizzoni L. Rappsilber J. Mann M. Dreyfuss G. J. Biol.

Only Gemin4 and Gemin6 do not directly bind SMN, interacting instead indirectly through Gemin3 and Gemin7, respectively (3Charroux B. Pellizzoni L. Perkinson R.A. Yong J. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Dreyfuss G. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1177-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 6Pellizzoni L. Baccon J. Rappsilber J. Mann M. Dreyfuss G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7540-7545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). This network of interactions places SMN at a lynchpin position at the heart of the complex. Since SMA results from a long term reduction of the SMN protein, we assessed the effect a stable, long term reduction of SMN would have on the state of the other proteins of the SMN complex. To address this, a cell line was constructed in which SMN is reduced by stable expression of shRNAs as well as a control cell line expressing nontargeting shRNA. In the SMN RNAi cell line, SMN was effectively reduced by ‚àº80% relative to that of the control cells, similar to what was previously observed when SMN was reduced by transient RNAi (data not shown) (30Feng W. Gubitz A.K. Wan L. Battle D.J. Dostie J. Golembe T.J. Dreyfuss G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 1605-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of the SMN complex via either SMN or Gemin2 from this cell line resulted in the purification of fewer SMN complexes relative to that of the control cells, but the relative composition of the proteins associated with SMN was unchanged (Fig. 1A). On the other hand, immunoprecipitation of Gemin5 from cells with reduced SMN showed that Gemin5 co-precipitated less SMN and Gemin2 but still co-precipitated nearly unaltered amounts of Gemin3 and Gemin4 when compared with precipitations from the control cells (Fig. 1A). These data demonstrate that Gemin5 can form a stable complex with Gemin3 and Gemin4 in the absence of SMN. This is particularly interesting, since Gemin5 was recently shown to interact in vitro not only with SMN but also weakly with Gemin3 and Gemin4 (31Otter S. Grimmler M. Neuenkirchen N. Chari A. Sickmann A. Fischer U. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5825-5833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Similarly, Gemin6 was immunoprecipitated from the SMN RNAi cell line. In this case, Gemin6 still effectively co-precipitated Gemin7 and unrip but co-precipitated much less SMN, Gemin2, Gemin3, Gemin4, and Gemin5 (Fig. 1B). Previous data have shown that Gemin6 and Gemin7 can directly interact in vitro and also that unrip can directly interact with a Gemin6-Gemin7 heterodimer in vitro (1Baccon J. Pellizzoni L.

These data demonstrate that Gemin6, Gemin7, and unrip form a stable complex outside of the SMN complex in cells with reduced SMN. Gemin Subunits Form in Wild-type Cells-The data above demonstrate that at least two distinct subunits of the SMN complex exist when SMN is reduced. It was unclear whether these complexes exist in wild-type cells or if they only exist as a consequence of SMN reduction. To address this, we attempted to purify the subunits from wild-type HeLa cells. HeLa cell lysates were first fractionated by 5‚Äì20% sucrose-gradient sedimentation. As has been previously published (7Carissimi C. Saieva L. Baccon J. Chiarella P. Maiolica A. Sawyer A. Rappsilber J. Pellizzoni L. J. Biol.

Gemin6, however, sediments predominantly in an ‚àº10 S peak in fractions 2 and 3 of the gradient, with only a small amount found in the SMN complex fractions (Fig. 2A). To test if these lighter fractions represent the Gemin6-Gemin7-unrip complex, Gemin6 was immunoprecipitated from fraction 2. Indeed, Gemin6 effectively co-precipitated both Gemin7 and unrip but not SMN or Gemin2 to -5 from the 10 S fraction (Fig. 2B). These data showed that much of the Gemin6, Gemin7, and unrip in HeLa cells forms a 10 S, SMN-free complex. Gemin5 sediments with the SMN complex in the 40‚Äì80 S peak (fractions 9‚Äì14) of a 5‚Äì20% sucrose gradient (7Carissimi C. Saieva L. Baccon J. Chiarella P. Maiolica A. Sawyer A. Rappsilber J.

However, significant amounts of Gemin5 are also found in a 20‚Äì35 S peak (fractions 4‚Äì6) (Fig. 2A). Gemin3 and Gemin4 predominantly sediment in the 40‚Äì80 S fractions but are also found throughout the gradient in all fractions larger than 20 S (Fig. 2A). Gemin5 and SMN were immunoprecipitated from both the 20‚Äì35 S fractions and the 60‚Äì80 S fractions of a 5‚Äì20% sucrose gradient. Both Gemin5 and SMN effectively co-precipitate all components of the SMN complex from the 60‚Äì80 S fractions, demonstrating that both Gemin5 and SMN are part of the same complex, the canonical SMN complex (Fig. 2B). However, Gemin5 in the 20‚Äì35 S fractions co-precipitated Gemin3 and Gemin4 but not SMN or Gemin2, -6, or -7, despite the fact that some SMN and Gemin2 were detectable in those fractions (Fig. 2B). Conversely, SMN only co-precipitated Gemin2 from the 20‚Äì35 S fractions, despite the fact that much Gemin5, -3, and -4 was found in these fractions (Fig. 2B). These data clearly demonstrate that the Gemin3-Gemin4-Gemin5 and SMN-Gemin2 complexes are separate complexes, although both sediment in roughly the same fractions. Also, although the 20 S methylosome also sedimented in these fractions, the JBP1/PRMT5 methyl-transferase did not co-precipitate with either Gemin5 or SMN (Fig. 2B), showing that Gemin3-Gemin4-Gemin5 and SMN-Gemin2 complexes are not components of the 20 S methylosome. The ratio of Gemin5 to Gemin3 and -4 in the 20‚Äì35 S complex was significantly different from the ratio of these proteins within the SMN complex (Fig. 2B). This suggested that there was more Gemin5 in these fractions than Gemin3 and Gemin4. If the relative stoichiometry of Gemin5, -3, and -4 remains the same within the SMN complex and in the Gemin3-Gemin4-Gemin5 complex, then the 20‚Äì35 S fractions probably represented both a Gemin3-Gemin4-Gemin5 complex and excess free Gemin5. To resolve these better, a 5‚Äì20% sucrose gradient was centrifuged for a longer time, such that 40 S was at the bottom of the gradient (Fig. 3A). The fractions were then pooled in pairs, and Gemin5 was immunoprecipitated from each fraction. Indeed, two peaks for Gemin5 were immunoprecipitated, one at 20 S and another at 30 S (Fig. 3, B and C). Gemin3 and Gemin4 both co-precipitated with Gemin5 in the 30 S peak (Fig. 3, B and C). SMN only began to co-precipitate with Gemin5 in the bottom fractions (approximately 40 S). These data demonstrate that, in addition to the SMN complex, Gemin5 forms both a 30 S complex with Gemin3 and -4 and a 20 S complex without any other SMN complex components. Cell Stress Reveals a Separation of Gemin5 from SMN and Gemin2-Further evidence for Gemin5 existing separate from the SMN complex comes from analyzing changes in the subcellular distribution of Gemins in vivo upon exposure to stressful conditions. By immunofluorescence microscopy, under normal metabolic conditions, SMN and all of the Gemins are found dispersed in the cytoplasm and in prominent nuclear bodies called Gems, precluding the use of co-localized immunofluorescence to detect separate complexes (1Baccon J.

These studies led to a biosynthetic model in which MMP is elongated by a linear alternating process of mannosylation followed by O-methylation, in which GDP-Man serves as the sugar donor for the mannosyltransferase and S-adenosylmethionine serves as the source of methyl groups. Termination of the elongation reaction occurs when the length of the chain is sufficient to confer on the polysaccharide fatty acid-binding properties (11-13 3-O-methylmannoses). At this stage, the chain is terminated with an unmethylated mannose because the acyl-CoA-bound oligosaccharides are no longer available as acceptors for the 3-O-methyltransferase. Knowledge of the initiation, elongation, and termination reactions involved in the biosynthesis of MGLP is more limited. A membrane-associated acyltransferase activity responsible for the transfer of acetyl, propionyl, isobutyryl, octanoyl, and succinyl groups from their respective acyl-CoA derivatives onto purified MGLP and partially acetylated Œ±-(1‚Üí4)-linked d-gluco-oligosaccharides has been described (22Tung K.-K. Ballou C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 7126-7133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A soluble protein fraction from M. phlei capable of catalyzing the transfer of methyl groups from S-adenosylmethionine to positions 6 and 3 of MGLP and partially acetylated Œ±-(1‚Üí4)-d-gluco-oligosaccharides has also been reported (23Ferguson J.A. Ballou C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 4213-4223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Grellert E. Ballou C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 3236-3241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since the position of the O-methylation on the oligosaccharide acceptor was dependent on its degree of acetylation, it was suggested that acylation and O-methylation occurred together during the biosynthesis of the lipopolysaccharide, the former process exerting a control on the latter. The characterization of weakly acidic and partially O-methylated methylglucosyl-containing polysaccharide precursors from M. smegmatis led Kamisango et al. (25Kamisango K. Dell A. Ballou C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4580-4586Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to propose a model for the biosynthesis of MGLP in which the elongation of the chain proceeds stepwise, from the reducing end toward the nonreducing end, through a sequential glucosylation-methylation reaction. Although at least one Œ±-(1‚Üí4)-glucosyltransferase is expected to be required for the elongation of the glucan backbone of MGLP, no such enzymatic activity had been reported. Since these early studies, and despite the important roles PMPS might play in the regulation of fatty acid metabolism in mycobacteria, the biosynthesis of PMPS had not been reinvestigated in the postgenomic era. Construction of the M. tuberculosis and M. smegmatis Glucosyltransferase and Methyltransferase Mutants‚ÄîThe ts-sacB method (26Jackson M. Camacho L.R. Gicquel B. Guilhot C. Parish T. Stocker N.G. Mycobacterium tuberculosis Protocols. 54. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2001: 59-75Google Scholar) was used to achieve allelic replacement at the Rv3032 locus of M. tuberculosis (ATCC number 25618) and at the MSMEG2349 locus of M. smegmatis mc2155. The M. tuberculosis Rv3032 gene and flanking regions was PCR-amplified from M. tuberculosis H37Rv genomic DNA using primers Rv3032.1 (5‚Ä≤-gggctgcagatcgccggcgcgctggcc-3‚Ä≤)/Rv3032.2 (5‚Ä≤-tgagccatgtcgcctccctgg-3‚Ä≤), and a disrupted allele, Rv3032::kan, was obtained by inserting the kanamycin resistance cassette from pUC4K (Amersham Biosciences) into the SmaI restriction site of Rv3032. Rv3032::kan was then cloned into the NotI-cut and blunt-ended pPR27-xylE (26Jackson M. Camacho L.R. Gicquel B. Guilhot C. Parish T. Stocker N.G. Mycobacterium tuberculosis Protocols. 54. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2001: 59-75Google Scholar) to obtain pPR27Rv3032KX, the construct used for allelic replacement in M. tuberculosis. The M. smegmatis MSMEG2349 gene and flanking regions was PCR-amplified using the primers Ms3030f (5‚Ä≤-cacgttctgagcaacctacacc-3‚Ä≤) and Ms3030r (5‚Ä≤-tgatcagatgggaacggccctcgg-3‚Ä≤). A disrupted copy of MSMEG2349 was obtained by substituting 152 bp of the coding region of this gene bracketed between two SalI sites by the Kan cassette from pUC4K. MSMEG2349::kan was then cloned into the XbaI-cut pJQ200-xylE, yielding pJQMSMEG2349KX. Overexpression of Rv3032 in M. smegmatis and Complementation Studies‚ÄîThe entire coding sequence of Rv3032 was PCR-amplified from M. tuberculosis H37Rv genomic DNA using the primers Rv3032.3 (5‚Ä≤-gcgcgcgcatatgaggatcctcatggtgtcgtg-3‚Ä≤) and Rv3032.4 (5‚Ä≤-gggaagcttccgatcgggaagagcgtgctc-3‚Ä≤) and cloned into the NdeI and HindIII restriction sites of the expression vector pVV16 (27KordulaÃÅkovaÃÅ J.

Whole Cell Radiolabeling Experiments‚ÄîRadiolabeling of whole M. smegmatis and M. tuberculosis cells with [1,2-14C]acetic acid (0.5 ŒºCi ml-1; specific activity, 113 Ci mol-1, MP Biomedicals Inc.) was performed at 37 ¬∞C in 7H9-ADC-Tween 80 broth for 14 h with shaking. Radiolabeling with [methyl-14C]l-methionine (0.5 ŒºCi ml-1; specific activity, 68 Ci mol-1; MP Biomedicals Inc.) was performed at 37 ¬∞C in Sauton medium for 48 h (M. tuberculosis) or 24 h (M. smegmatis). Preparation, Purification, and Analysis of MGLP‚ÄîFor the preparation of PMPS from cold or radiolabeled cultures, M. smegmatis and M. tuberculosis were grown in Sauton's medium as surface pellicles. Total lipids and PMPS were extracted with chloroform/methanol (1:2) followed by two other extractions with chloroform/methanol (2:1). The pooled and dried organic extracts were then partitioned between chloroform and water (1:1), and the MGLP and MMP contained in the aqueous phase were further purified by reverse phase chromatography on SepPak¬Æ Plus tC18 columns (Waters). Fractions were eluted with increasing concentrations of methanol in water, and the MMP and MGLP content of each fraction was determined by TLC and gas chromatography analysis of alditol acetates derived from these fractions (28McNeil M. Chatterjee D. Hunter S.W. Brennan P.J. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 179: 215-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). TLC analyses were performed on aluminum-backed silica gel 60-precoated plates F254 (Merck) using chloroform/methanol/water (56:38:10) as the eluent. PMPS were recovered in the fractions eluted with 40 and 70% methanol in water in which they were estimated to be 75-90% pure (supplemental Fig. 1). Dry MGLP were deacylated in 1 m NaOH at 37 ¬∞C for 3 h, yielding MGP. The mixture was neutralized with 0.2 m HCl and desalted using reverse phase SepPak¬Æ Plus tC18 (Waters) chromatography as described above. Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) Mass Spectrometry (MS) analysis of purified MGLP, MGP, and MMP samples was performed on a 4700 Proteomics Analyzer MALDI TOF/TOF system (Applied Biosystems, Framingham, MA) equipped with a pulsed Nd:YAG laser emitting at 355 nm and operating at 200 Hz. Typically, 0.3 Œºl of the sample in water was mixed with 0.3 Œºl of matrix solution (2-(4-hydroxyphenylazo)benzoic acid at a concentration of ‚àº10 mg ml-1 in ethanol/water (1:1)) directly onto the target plate. All samples were analyzed in reflector mode using both positive and negative ion detection. Final spectra were obtained by accumulating 2,500 subspectra generated by 250 laser pulses on 10 distinct areas of the dried droplet and calibrated using the instrument's external calibration procedure. Analysis of Glycogen and Glucan‚ÄîFor the analysis of glycogen and Œ±-d-glucan, M. tuberculosis strains were grown in Sauton's medium as surface pellicles. High molecular weight carbohydrates and proteins were precipitated from 10-fold concentrated culture filtrates with six volumes of cold ethanol overnight at 4 ¬∞C, as described (29Lemassu A. DaffeÃÅ M. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Precipitates were recovered by centrifugation at 14,000 √ó g for 1 h, dissolved in distilled water, dialyzed for 1 day against water to eliminate traces of salts and glycerol, lyophilized, and weighted. The extracellular Œ±-d-glucan content was determined by gas chromatography of sugar derivatives resulting from the acid hydrolysis of the lyophilized macromolecules. Further purification of Œ±-d-glucan was carried out by anion-exchange chromatography on a DEAE-trisacryl gel, and the neutral fractions were rechromatographed on a Bio-Gel P-60 column, as previously described (30Dinadayala P. Lemassu A. Granovski P. CeÃÅrantola S. Winter N. DaffeÃÅ M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12369-12378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). For the purification of glycogen, heat-killed cells were weighted, suspended in water, and centrifuged twice at 1,100 √ó g for 15 min to remove loosely attached compounds, among them the extracellular Œ±-d-glucan. Washed cells were broken in a French press at 140 bars to liberate the intracellular glycogen. The material was centrifuged at 1,100 √ó g for 30 min to eliminate nonbroken cells, and the supernatant was recentrifuged at 27,000 √ó g for 15 min to remove cell walls. Glycogen was extracted as described (31Bueding E. Orrell S. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 4018-4020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with only minor modifications. Identification of a Cluster of Genes Potentially Involved in the Synthesis of MGLP‚ÄîGlucosyltransferase(s) likely to be involved in the elongation of MGLP were searched within the CAZy classification of glycosyltransferases (GTs) (Carbohydrate-Active enZymes; available on the World Wide Web). The cytosolic localization of MGLP suggested that the glucosyltransferase(s) probably used ADP-d-Glc or UDP-d-Glc as d-Glc donor. The fact that these lipopolysaccharides essentially consist of Œ±-(1‚Üí4)-linked d-Glcp residues further suggested that the glucosyltransferase(s) used a retaining type of catalytic mechanism for sugar transfer, leading to a glycosidic bond in Œ±-configuration. The CAZy GT-4 family is the largest family of NDP-sugar-dependent retaining GTs. Enzymes from this family carry a conserved motif (D/E)X7E proposed to be involved in the binding of the sugar-nucleotide donor. M. tuberculosis H37Rv contains seven representatives of this family, among which three (PimA, PimB, and MshA) have been functionally characterized in mycobacteria or related species and shown to participate in the biosynthesis of phosphatidylinositol mannosides, glycosylated diacylglycerols, and mycothiol (27KordulaÃÅkovaÃÅ J.

Among the four remaining GTs, Rv1212c and Rv3032 showed the greatest level of sequence similarity with the glycogen synthase from E. coli (GlgA) (46.7 and 46% similarity at the amino acid level, respectively). Rv1212c is orthologous to the Coryne-bacterium glutamicum glycogen synthase gene, glgA, with which it shares 71.8% similarity (60.3% identity) at the amino acid level (35Tzvetkov M. Klopprogge C. Zelder O. Liebl W. Microbiology. 2003; 149: 1659-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In contrast, no functional information was available for Rv3032. Interestingly, this gene displayed a limited distribution within prokaryotes, having orthologs only in mycobacterial spp. (M. tuberculosis H37Rv and CDC1551, M. bovis, M. leprae, M. smegmatis, Mycobacterium avium, M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis, Mycobacterium ulcerans, M. flavescens) and Nocardia farcinica. A closer examination of the genomic region encompassing Rv3032 in M. tuberculosis H37Rv revealed that, adjacent or in close vicinity to this putative glucosyltransferase gene, lay a putative acetyltransferase gene (Rv3034c), two putative S-adenosyl-methionine-dependent-methyltransferase genes (Rv3030 and Rv3037c), and a putative Œ±-amylase/glucoside hydrolase/GH-57 family branching enzyme gene (Rv3031) (Fig. 2). Given the likely involvement of some if not all of these genes in MGLP biosynthesis, efforts were focused on this cluster of genes and, more particularly, on Rv3032 and Rv3030. Construction of M. smegmatis and M. tuberculosis Glucosyltransferase and Methyltransferase Knock-out Mutants and Phenotypic Analyses‚ÄîThe putative glucosyltransferase gene, Rv3032, and methyltransferase gene, MSMEG2349 (orthologous to Rv3030 of M. tuberculosis), were disrupted by homologous recombination in M. tuberculosis H37Rv and M. smegmatis, respectively, using the ts-sacB method (26Jackson M. Camacho L.R. Gicquel B. Guilhot C. Parish T. Stocker N.G. Mycobacterium tuberculosis Protocols. 54. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2001: 59-75Google Scholar). Allelic replacements at the Rv3032 and MSMEG2349 loci were confirmed by Southern hybridization (data not shown). Interestingly, the growth of H37RvŒîRv3032 was slightly slower than that of wild-type H37Rv in 7H9 broth at 37 ¬∞C and completely abolished at a higher temperature (39 ¬∞C) (supplemental Fig. 2). Likewise, the mc2ŒîMSMEG2349 mutant did not grow at high temperature (42 ¬∞C) in Sauton's medium, although its growth was comparable with that of mc2155 at 30 and 37 ¬∞C in this medium (data not shown). An analysis of the MGLP content of the wild-type and mutant strains upon metabolic labeling with [methyl-14C]l-methionine revealed that the amount of radioactivity incorporated into the MGLP of the H37RvŒîRv3032 and mc2ŒîMSMEG2349 mutants was only 17 and 38%, respectively, of that incorporated by their wild-type parent (Figs. 3A and 4A). Comparison of the yields of MGLP from the different strains also supported these conclusions in that, depending on the growth phase, the amounts of lipopolysaccharides recovered from H37RvŒîRv3032 were 20-60% less than that recovered from wild-type M. tuberculosis H37Rv. Recovery from mc2ŒîMSMEG2349 was significantly less than that from wild-type M. smegmatis. However, quantification was not possible due to the important amounts of MMP co-eluting with MGLP in this Mycobacterium species (see supplemental Fig. 1). It is noteworthy that MMP could not be detected in the extracts or in the purified PMPS fractions of M. tuberculosis, neither by MALDI-MS nor by TLC (supplemental Fig. 1). Consistent with this observation, gas chromatography analyses of the alditol acetates derived from purified PMPS revealed the presence of 3-O-methylmannose in the O-methylated polysaccharide fractions from M. smegmatis but not in those from M. tuberculosis (strains H37Rv and Mt103) (data not shown).FIGURE 4MGLP composition of the wild-type and MSMEG2349 mutant strains of M. smegmatis.

Attempts to complement the mc2ŒîMSMEG2349 mutant with Rv3030 from M. tuberculosis carried by the multicopy expression plasmid pVV16 were not successful due to the apparent toxic effect of overexpressing this gene in M. smegmatis. However, the fact that MSMEG2348 transcripts were detected by reverse transcription-PCR in mc2ŒîMSMEG2349 (data not shown) suggests that inactivation of the methyltransferase gene, rather than a polar effect on the expression of the downstream putative branching enzyme gene, is responsible for the phenotype. To further compare the nature of the MGLP produced by the wild-type and mutant strains, PMPS were purified by reverse phase chromatography, and the MGLP-containing fractions, either native or deacylated, were analyzed by MALDI-MS. The partial negative ion MALDI mass spectra of the MGLP-containing fractions of H37Rv, H37RvŒîRv3032, and H37RvŒîRv3032/pVVRv3032 are presented in supplemental Fig. 3. The mass spectrum of the MGLP from wild-type H37Rv showed a group of intense ions between 3500 and 4000 atomic mass units, potentially attributable to MGLP [M + Na]- or [M - H + 2Na]- pseudomolecular ions. A similar pattern was seen in the spectrum of the complemented mutant but not in that of H37RvŒîRv3032, in good agreement with the quantification results presented above. Interpretation of these clustered ions indicates that they may result from the overlap of ions differing by 162, 100, and 14 mass units reflecting, respectively, the variability of MGLP structures in terms of their degree of glycosylation, succinylation, acylation, and/or O-methylation. Therefore, to best perceive and analyze potential qualitative differences in the oligosaccharide backbones of the MGLP from the wild-type and mutant strains, the purified MGLP-containing fractions were deacylated by alkali treatment and reanalyzed by MALDI-MS. The MGP fraction of wild-type H37Rv mainly showed two series of ions, separated by 162 mass units and differing by 22 mass units attributable to sodium adducts of pseudomolecular ions of MGP (Fig. 3B). The two most intense ions at m/z 3351 and m/z 3513 were respectively assigned to the [M - H]- pseudomolecular ions of MGP19,12 and MGP20,12 (MGP containing 19 and 20 glucose units, among which 12 are O-methylated). This attribution was further confirmed by the fact that these ions were found, respectively, at m/z 3397 and m/z 3559 ([M - H + 2Na]+) in the MALDI mass spectrum run in the positive ion detection mode (data not shown). This result thus confirmed that the complex MGLP pattern described above resulted from variable combinations of acylation of mainly two oligosaccharide backbones, MGP19,12 and MGP20,12, and, to a much lesser extent, MGP20,11 and MGP20,13. As shown in Figs. 3B and 4B, the disruptions of Rv3032 and MSMEG2349 had significant impacts on the MGLP patterns of M. tuberculosis and M. smegmatis. H37RvŒîRv3032 accumulated polysaccharidic compounds with lower masses, consisting essentially of 17 Glc residues (MGP17,9, MGP17,10, MGP17,11), with lesser quantities of MGP16,10, MGP18,10, MGP18,11, MGP18,12, and MGP19,12. More glucosylated forms of MGLP could not be detected in this strain. Complementation of the mutant partially restored MGP synthesis, resulting in a clear shift of its MGP profile toward the mature forms of these polysaccharides (MGP19,12 and MGP20,12) (Fig. 3B). MS analysis of the MGP from the MSMEG2349 mutant also revealed a shift in the types of MGP produced from the mature to the less glycosylated forms of these molecules, with a clear accumulation of MGP16,11 and MGP16,12 (m/z 2851 and m/z 2865, respectively) (Fig. 4B). In conclusion, the analyses performed on the two mutant strains indicate that Rv3032 in M. tuberculosis and MSMEG2349 in M. smegmatis participate in the biosynthesis of MGLP, although compensatory glucosyltransferase and O-methyltransferase activities exist in these species, allowing the knock-out mutants to produce residual quantities of glucosylated PMPS. Disruption of Rv3032 Also Affects the Glycogen Content of M. tuberculosis‚ÄîThe likely involvement of Rv3032 in the formation of Œ±-(1‚Üí4)-glucosidic bonds prompted us to further analyze the glycogen (36Elbein A.D. Mitchell M. J. Bacteriol. 1973; 113: 863-873Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and capsular Œ±-d-glucan (29Lemassu A. DaffeÃÅ M. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) content of H37RvŒîRv3032. Analyses performed on two independent cultures of M. tuberculosis wild-type and Rv3032 mutant strains revealed an important decrease (44.5 ¬± 9.0%) in the glycogen content of the mutant relative to the wild-type strain. This tendency was partially reversed upon complementation of the mutant with pVVRv3032 (the glycogen content of the complemented mutant was 74 ¬± 0.6% of that of the wild-type strain). To analyze the impact of the inactivation of Rv3032 on the production of glucan, which represents the major extracellular polysaccharide of M. tuberculosis (29Lemassu A. DaffeÃÅ M. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), the ratios of Glc to the monosaccharide constituents of the other extracellular polysaccharides (i.e. arabinomannan and mannan) (29Lemassu A. DaffeÃÅ M. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) (Glc versus Ara + Man + Glc) were determined in the culture filtrates of three or four independent batches of the wild-type and mutant strains. Very similar ratios were obtained (0.56 ¬± 0.07 and 0.58 ¬± 0.09, respectively) for the different batches and strains, indicating that the synthesis of the capsular glucan was unaffected in the mutant. This suggests either that Rv3032 is not involved in the synthesis of the capsular polysaccharide or that residual Œ±-(1‚Üí4)-glucosyltransferase activity (or activities) in the mutant cells is preferentially utilized to synthesize glucan. The glycogen and glucan produced by the mutant were otherwise structurally identical to those of M. tuberculosis H37Rv as determined by 1H NMR analyses (data not shown). Altogether, our results implicated Rv3032 in the synthesis of two different Œ±-(1‚Üí4)-linked glucans in M. tuberculosis: MGLP and glycogen. Effect of Overexpressing Rv3032 in M. smegmatis‚ÄîTo further study the role of Rv3032 in MGLP synthesis, we analyzed the effects of overexpressing Rv3032 on the production of these glycoconjugates in M. smegmatis. Transformation of mc2155 with pVVRv3032, the multicopy plasmid used in the complementation studies described above, resulted in the production of a carboxyl-terminal hexahistidine-tagged recombinant protein of the expected size (‚àº45 kDa) (data not shown). TLC analyses of the MGLP contents from [methyl-14C]l-methionine-labeled mc2155 and mc2155/pVVRv3032 cells (Fig. 5A) revealed a clear increase in the synthesis of the lipopolysaccharides in the overexpressor. Moreover, MALDI-MS analyses of the purified MGP fractions from the same strains indicated a stimulatory effect of the overexpression of Rv3032 on the synthesis of the most glucosylated (mature) forms of MGLP (Fig. 5B). These results, together with the fact that the inactivation of Rv3032 in M. tuberculosis resulted in a general decrease in the production of glycogen and all forms of MGLP, suggested that Rv3032 is the main Œ±-(1‚Üí4)-glucosyltransferase responsible for the elongation of the lipopolysaccharides. Supporting this assumption, preliminary cell-free assays, which will be presented elsewhere, indicated that a purified recombinant form of Rv3032 catalyzes in vitro the transfer of Œ±-(1‚Üí4)-linked Glc residues from UDP-d-Glc onto short-chain gluco-oligosaccharides, capsular Œ±-d-glucan and glycogen (data not shown). The availability of a growing number of mycobacterial genome sequences and the rapidly growing knowledge of the processes underlying sugar transfer in these bacteria (37Berg S. Kaur D. Jackson M. Brennan P.J. Glycobiology. 2007; 17: 35R-56RCrossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) have opened the way to the elucidation of the biosynthetic pathways of complex glycoconjugates in M. tuberculosis. This work was undertaken with the aims of investigating the biosynthetic pathway of MGLP. A cluster of genes relatively conserved within the Mycobacterium genus was identified, among which the glucosyltransferase gene Rv3032 and the ortholog of the O-methyltransferase gene Rv3030 in M. smegmatis were studied. Also present within the gene cluster is Rv3031, annotated as a putative Œ±-amylase in the genome of M. tuberculosis H37Rv, Rv3034c, annotated as a putative acetyltransferase, and Rv3037c, encoding a putative S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferase of unknown function. Sequence similarities between Rv3031 and a GH-57 family branching enzyme from Thermococcus kodakaraensis (38Murakami T. Kanai T. Takata H. Kuriki T. Imanaka T. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 5915-5924Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) suggest that this enzyme is involved in generating the Œ±(1‚Üí6) glycosidic bond linking the first and second d-Glcp residues at the reducing end of the molecule. In M. tuberculosis, Rv3032 participates in the production of glycogen and MGLP. It also stimulates the synthesis of MGLP when overexpressed in M. smegmatis. The general decrease in all forms of MGLP that followed the disruption of Rv3032 in M. tuberculosis and the stimulatory effect the overexpression of Rv3032 had on the production of mature MGLP in M. smegmatis strongly suggest that Rv3032 is the main Œ±-(1‚Üí4)-glucosyltransferase committed in the elongation of those lipopolysaccharides. Likewise, the similar phenotype that arose from the genetic disruption of MSMEG2349 in M. smegmatis suggests that this gene encodes the main O-methyltransferase of the pathway (i.e. the one required for the 6-O-methylation of the polysaccharide backbone of MGLP). Important information derived from the analysis of the M. smegmatis mutant is that a defect in O-methylation abolishes MGLP synthesis. Thus, despite both the Œ±-(1‚Üí4)-glucosyltransferase and the 6-O-methyltransferase being active on unmethylated Œ±-(1‚Üí4)-d-gluco-oligosaccharides in vitro (23Ferguson J.A. Ballou C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 4213-4223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Grellert E. Ballou C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 3236-3241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the elongation of MGLP in whole bacterial cells appears to proceed with glucosylation and O-methylation occurring hand in hand. This observation is consistent with the biosynthetic model proposed by Kamisango et al. (25Kamisango K. Dell A. Ballou C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4580-4586Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) based on the structural analysis of MGLP precursors. The residual quantities and types of MGLP found in H37RvŒîRv3032 and mc2ŒîMSMEG2349 imply that compensatory glucosyltransferase and O-methyltransferase activities exist allowing M. tuberculosis and M. smegmatis to synthesize basal amounts of wild-type MGLP. According to our bioinformatics analyses, an obvious Œ±-(1‚Üí4)-glucosyltransferase gene candidate in M. tuberculosis H37Rv is Rv1212c, the ortholog of the glycogen synthase gene from Corynebacterium glutamicum (35Tzvetkov M. Klopprogge C. Zelder O. Liebl W. Microbiology. 2003; 149: 1659-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Work is in progress in our laboratories to study the involvement of this gene in glycogen and MGLP synthesis and to generate a double Rv3032/Rv1212c knock-out mutant of M. tuberculosis. An intriguing preliminary observation that arose from our study is the fact that, contrary to M. smegmatis, M. tuberculosis (strains H37Rv and Mt103) does not produce detectable amounts of MMP. Although more isolates will have to be tested before a definitive conclusion can be drawn, these results and the fact that MMP have so far only been reported in fast growing nonpathogenic species of mycobacteria (16Weisman L.S. Ballou C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3457-3463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) raise the interesting possibility that mannosylated PMPS may not be produced by slow growing mycobacterial species. Due to the existence of compensatory enzymatic activities and to the dual involvement of Rv3032 in MGLP and glycogen synthesis, it is at present not possible to draw any conclusions as to the potential essentiality and physiological role(s) of MGLP in mycobacteria. Answers to these questions will require the construction of an M. tuberculosis mutant totally deficient in their synthesis, a goal that is likely to be achievable through the individual or combined inactivation of the branching enzyme, O-methyltransferase and acetyltransferase genes, Rv3031, Rv3030, Rv3037c, and Rv3034c.

https://openalex.org/W1976539942,"Several lines of evidence have established strong links between transcriptional activity and specific post-translation modifications of histones. Here we show using RNA FISH that in erythroid cells, intergenic transcription in the human Œ≤-globin locus occurs over a region of greater than 250 kb including several genes in the nearby olfactory receptor gene cluster. This entire region is transcribed during S phase of the cell cycle. However, within this region there are ‚àº20 kb sub-domains of high intergenic transcription that occurs outside of S phase. These sub-domains are developmentally regulated and enriched with high levels of active modifications primarily to histone H3. The sub-domains correspond to the Œ≤-globin locus control region, which is active at all developmental stages in erythroid cells, and the region flanking the developmentally regulated, active globin genes. These results correlate high levels of non-S phase intergenic transcription with domain-wide active histone modifications to histone H3."

Only two of the seven subfamilies of ArfGEFs (GBF and BIG) are found in all eukaryotes. In addition to the Sec7 domain, which catalyzes GDP/GTP exchange on Arf, the GBF and BIG ArfGEFs have five common homology domains. Very little is known about the functions of these noncatalytic domains, but it is likely that they serve to integrate upstream signals that define the conditions of Arf activation. Here we describe interactions between two conserved domains upstream of the Sec7 domain (DCB and HUS) that determine the architecture of the N-terminal regions of the GBF and BIG ArfGEFs using a combination of biochemical, yeast two-hybrid, and cellular assays. Our data demonstrate a strong interaction between DCB domains within GBF1, BIG1, and BIG2 to maintain homodimers and an interaction between DCB and HUS domains within each homodimer. The DCB/HUS interaction is mediated by the HUS box, the most conserved motif in large ArfGEFs after the Sec7 domain. In support of the in vitro data, we show that both the DCB and the HUS domains are necessary for GBF1 dimerization in mammalian cells and that the DCB domain is essential for yeast viability.

Second, binding partners involved in cell signaling, such as protein kinase A, FK506-binding protein 13, and the AKAP-interacting protein AMY-1, have been identified for the large Golgi-localized ArfGEFs (10Li H.

Finally, ArfGEFs may play a role in membrane recruitment of Arf effectors, such as coats, thus assembling downstream components of Arf signaling pathways prior to Arf activation (5Shinotsuka C.

Traffic. 2002; 3: 483-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar).An essential issue is to decipher how ArfGEFs implement these functions and coordinate them with their biochemical GDP/GTP exchange activity. To address this question, we chose to focus on the large ArfGEFs, since (i) they are the only ArfGEFs found in all eukaryotes, and (ii) their multidomain architecture may allow them to recapitulate the largest number of ArfGEF functions within a single polypeptide (14Cox R. Mason-Gamer R.J. Jackson C.L. Segev N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1487-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 15Mouratou B. Biou V. Joubert A. Cohen J. Shields D.J. Geldner N. Jurgens G. Melancon P. Cherfils J. BMC Genomics. 2005; 6: 20Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Large ArfGEFs comprise two groups, which we refer to as the GBF and BIG groups after their names in mammals. Both function in maintaining organelle integrity and membrane traffic at the Golgi or at endosomes (reviewed in Ref. 1D'Souza-Schorey C. Chavrier P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar). The best studied representatives are yeast Gea1p/Gea2p, Arabidopsis thaliana GNOM and mammalian GBF1 for the GBF group, and yeast Sec7p and mammalian BIG1/BIG2 for the BIG group (reviewed in Refs. 1D'Souza-Schorey C.

The predicted organization comprises two noncatalytic domains (dimerization and cyclophilin-binding (DCB) and homology upstream of Sec7 (HUS)) in the N terminus of the Sec7 domain and three in its C terminus (HDS1, HDS2, and HDS3). The N-terminal DCB domain (Fig. 1A) is the only domain to which a molecular function has been assigned. It was originally identified in plant GNOM, where it was shown to be capable of dimerization in yeast two-hybrid and in vitro pull-down assays (16Grebe M. Gadea J. Steinmann T. Kientz M. Rahfeld J.U. Salchert K. Koncz C. Jurgens G. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 343-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Little is known about the other domains, except for an almost invariant 5-residue motif in the HUS domain, the HUS box (15Mouratou B. Biou V. Joubert A. Cohen J. Shields D.J. Geldner N. Jurgens G.

Cell. 2005; 16: 3786-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar).Here we combine biochemical, yeast two-hybrid, and cellular assays to analyze the domain architecture and interdomain interactions of the GBF and BIG groups of large ArfGEFs. Our data demonstrate the existence of two distinct interactions involving the DCB domain of the mammalian large ArfGEFs: homodimerization via a DCB/DCB interaction (generalizing previous results from plants) and a novel DCB/HUS interaction depending on the HUS box. We propose that the DCB/DCB and DCB/HUS interactions define a common structure in all members of the BIG and GBF groups of ArfGEFs, which probably also exists in the related eukaryotic Mon2p family.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESExpression of Recombinant DCBBIG1, DCBBIG2, and DCB-HUS-Sec7BIG1‚ÄîThe DCB domain of human BIG1 (DCBBIG1, residues 2-224) was introduced into pET28a (Novagen) modified to remove the thrombin cleavage site and to include alternative restriction sites (KpnI and AgeI). The E221K mutation was introduced into DCBBIG1 by PCR using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Both wild type and mutant DCBBIG1 were expressed in the Rosetta(DE3)pLysS Escherichia coli strain (Merck KGaA). DCBBIG1 was purified on aNi2+-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity column (GE Healthcare) followed by precipitation in ammonium sulfate to 70% saturation and gel filtration on a Superdex 75 column (GE Healthcare). The DCB domain of human BIG2 (DCBBIG2, residues 2-224) was cloned, expressed, and purified as described for DCBBIG1.A construct spanning the DCB, HUS, and Sec7 domains of human BIG1 (DCB-HUS-Sec7BIG1, residues 2-888) was introduced into pFastBac HTA vector (Invitrogen) using EcoRI and KpnI restriction sites. Sf21 cells infected by baculoviruses harboring this construct were used to express DCB-HUS-Sec7BIG1. The recombinant protein was purified on a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity column followed by a desalting column and a gel filtration Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare). Limited proteolysis was performed with 10 units of thrombin (Amersham Biosciences) per mg of protein at room temperature overnight. DCB-HUS-Sec7BIG1 and its proteolysis products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot.Biophysical Assays‚ÄîSedimentation velocity was measured at 40,000 √ó g for 24 h and analyzed with the SVEDBERG software (available on the World Wide Web). Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were carried out at 10,000, 15,000, and 20,000 √ó g for 46 h and analyzed with the Origin software (Beckman Coulter). CD scans were recorded between 185 and 260 nm. Thermal denaturations were carried out in the temperature range of 5-95 ¬∞C at a rate of 2 ¬∞C/min. Secondary structure composition was estimated with the CDDSTR software (19Whitmore L. Wallace B.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W668-W673Crossref PubMed Scopus (1967) Google Scholar). The effect of protein concentration on its thermal denaturation was measured with 0.3, 0.75, and 3 Œºm DCBBIG1 and analyzed at 222 nm, a wavelength minimum that is characteristic of Œ±-helices.Yeast Two-hybrid Assays‚ÄîPlasmids expressing human BIG1 and BIG2 and Cricetulus griseus GBF1 are gifts from P. MelancÃßon (University of Alberta, Canada), the plasmid expressing coxsackievirus 3A is a gift from F. van Kuppeveld (Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, The Netherlands). All yeast two-hybrid constructs were cloned in the pASŒî and pACT2 vectors to create fusions with the Gal4-DNA binding domain (BD) and Gal4 transcription activation domain (AD), respectively. The Y190 (MATa, gal4-542, gal80-538, his3, trp1-901, ade2-101, ura3-52, leu2-3, 112, URA3::GAL1-LacZ, Lys2::GAL1-HIS3cyhr) and AH109 (MATa, trp1-901, leu2-3, 112, ura3-52, his3-200 gal4Œî, gal80Œî, LYS2::GAL1UAS-GAL1TATA-HIS3, GAL2UAS-GAL2TATA-ADE2, URA3::MEL1UAS-MEL1TATA-lacZ) yeast strains were transformed with the different recombinant plasmids using the lithium acetate method (20Gietz D. St Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2877) Google Scholar). Y190 transformants autotrophic for tryptophan and leucine were assayed for Œ≤-galactosidase activity using the filter technique (21Schneider S. Buchert M. Hovens C.M. BioTechniques. 1996; 20: 960-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). AH109 transformants were tested for expression of HIS3 and ADE2 reporter genes. Stable expression of each clone in pACT2 and pASŒî was confirmed by Western blot using the Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) Gal4-AD and Gal4-BD monoclonal antibodies, respectively. All experiments were performed at least three times.Biochemical Assays‚ÄîLiposome binding experiments were performed with liposomes prepared as described in Ref. 22Bigay J. Gounon P. Robineau S.

DCBBIG1 (1 Œºm) was incubated at room temperature in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, and 120 mm potassium acetate with sucrose-loaded vesicles (final lipid concentration, 1 mm) in small polycarbonate tubes. The samples were centrifuged at 360,000 √ó g for 20 min, and the supernatants and the pellets were analyzed by SDS-PAGE with Sypro-orange staining. The Sec7 domain of BIG1 was used as a negative control. Exchange reaction assays were performed by tryptophan fluorescence kinetics using Œî17Arf1 as described in Ref. 23Zeeh J.C. Zeghouf M.

After 20 h of expression, cells were washed two times with 5 ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 19 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4) and then disrupted in 0.5 ml of cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40). After centrifugation at 4 ¬∞C, soluble cellular extracts were pre-cleared with 20 Œºl of protein G-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (GE Healthcare) at 4 ¬∞C for 30 min. Supernatants were incubated with 3 Œºg of anti-GFP antibodies (Roche Applied Science) for 1.5 h at 4 ¬∞C. Then 30 Œºl of protein G-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow was added, and the mixtures were incubated at 4 ¬∞C for 1.5 h. The resin was washed two times with 1 ml of W100 buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA), followed by two washes with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. Proteins were then eluted by incubation with 60 Œºl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer for 5 min at 95 ¬∞C. Eluted proteins were separated on a 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by Western immunoblotting using anti-HA antibodies as primary antibody (Sigma).Plasmid Shuffle Assays in Yeast‚ÄîThe gea1-ŒîDCB construct (coding for residues 233-1408 of Gea1p) was obtained by introducing a gap in the pAP22 (CEN, TRP1, GEA1) (gift of A. Peyroche, Commissariat aÃÄ l'Energie Atomique, Saclay, France). The PCR product extended to 1825 and 154 base pairs past the 5‚Ä≤ and 3‚Ä≤ ends of the gap, respectively. The mutated fragment and gapped plasmid were used to transform CJY52-10-2 yeast cells that contained the pAP23 plasmid (CEN, URA3, GEA1) (24Peyroche A. Courbeyrette R. Rambourg A. Jackson C.L. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2241-2253PubMed Google Scholar). Transformants were plated onto synthetic medium plates lacking tryptophan. Trp+ clones were grown at 30 ¬∞C in minimal medium (YNB) containing 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (BD), supplemented with appropriate nutrients and with 2% glucose. 5-Fluoroorotic acid monohydrate (Toronto Research Chemicals) was added to a final concentration of 0.1% to counterselect the URA3-containing cells. The presence of protein product of the gea1-ŒîDCB allele was controlled by Western immunoblotting as follows. Total yeast cell protein extracts were prepared using the NaOH/trichloroacetic acid lysis technique (25Volland C. Urban-Grimal D. Geraud G. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9833-9841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE in 10% Tricine gels and were analyzed by immunoblotting. The primary antibody was either a polyclonal anti-Gea1p antibody or a monoclonal anti-Vat2p antibody directed against a subunit of the vacuolar ATPase (Invitrogen).RESULTSMammalian BIG and GBF ArfGEFs Have an N-terminal Dimerization DCB Domain‚ÄîUsing a bioinformatics approach, we predicted previously that the DCB domain, originally identified as a dimerization domain in the GBF group member GNOM (16Grebe M. Gadea J. Steinmann T. Kientz M. Rahfeld J.U. Salchert K. Koncz C. Jurgens G. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 343-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), is also present at the N terminus of large ArfGEFs from the BIG group, where it should form an all-helical domain (15Mouratou B. Biou V. Joubert A. Cohen J. Shields D.J. Geldner N. Jurgens G. Melancon P. Cherfils J. BMC Genomics. 2005; 6: 20Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In order to address this question experimentally, we expressed in E. coli the N terminus of human BIG1, encompassing the helical subdomain of highest sequence homology and the more variable N-terminal subdomain (Fig. 1A), and purified it to homogeneity. The recombinant protein behaved as a 2 √ó 26-kDa dimer (Fig. 2A), a molecular mass that was confirmed by analytical ultracentrifugation equilibrium sedimentation (54.3 kDa). A similar construct from human BIG2 was also expressed and purified to homogeneity and, as for BIG1, eluted as a dimer on a gel filtration column (Fig. 2A). Deconvolution of CD spectra for both proteins was consistent with a mostly helical secondary structure. We thus conclude that the N-terminal domain of human BIGs qualifies as the bona fide homolog of the DCB domain of the GBF group member GNOM and refer to it as DCBBIG hereafter.FIGURE 2Biochemical characterization of recombinant proteins. A, elution profiles of purified DCBBIG1, DCBBIG2, and DCB-HUS-Sec7BIG1 on a gel filtration column. The elution volumes of calibration proteins are indicated. B, circular dichroism spectra of DCBBIG1 (6 Œºm) as a function of temperature. CD spectra are taken every 5 ¬∞C. The isodichroic point lies at 200.5 nm (thin arrow), showing that unfolding occurs as a two-state helix-coil transition.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In order to assess a possible dimer/monomer equilibrium, we analyzed the CD thermal denaturation spectra of DCBBIG1 (Fig. 2B). The model providing the best fit for the data was a two-state transition between an all-helical structure and a random coil denaturated state, without formation of a monomeric intermediate. This and a denaturation temperature (69 ¬∞C) independent of the protein concentration and higher than the average for proteins (around 55 ¬∞C) suggest that the dimer is stable with a dissociation constant below the concentration used in the experiment (100 nm). Analytical ultracentrifugation confirmed the predominance of a dimeric species and the absence of monomer.To determine whether dimerization is a general feature of DCB-like domains of the large ArfGEFs, we tested mammalian GBF1 and BIG2 DCB/DCB interactions using the yeast two-hybrid system. We observed a strong interaction between DCB domains of hamster GBF1 (98% identity with human GBF1) and between human BIG2 DCB domains, indicating that the DCB domain mediates dimerization in all mammalian large ArfGEFs (Fig. 3, sectors 1 and 12). We next looked for residues that contribute to the DCB/DCB interaction. Two highly conserved residues, Lys91 and Glu130 in DCBGBF1, are found in both large ArfGEF groups (Fig. 1A). Mutation of either residue to alanine in DCBGBF1 abolished the interaction between mutant and wild-type DCBGBF1 in the two-hybrid system (Fig. 3, sectors 2 and 11). Thus, these residues are either part of the dimer interface or induce an abnormal structure in this interface. We then analyzed a mutation found in the C terminus of the DCB domain of human BIG2 (Fig. 1A), which has been associated with a congenital disease, autosomal recessive periventricular heterotopia with microencephaly (26Sheen V.L. Ganesh V.S. Topcu M. Sebire G. Bodell A. Hill R.S. Grant P.E. Shugart Y.Y. Imitola J. Khoury S.J. Guerrini R. Walsh C.A. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). DCBBIG1 carrying the equivalent mutation, E221K, was expressed in E. coli with a solubility similar to that of wild-type DCBBIG1. Analytical ultracentrifugation experiments showed that DCBE221KBIG1 forms a dimer (data not shown). Thus, functions of DCBBIG2 other than dimerization are affected by this mutation in the autosomal recessive periventricular heterotopia with microencephaly disorder.FIGURE 3Yeast two-hybrid analysis of DCB and HUS interactions in mammalian ArfGEFs.

All five noncatalytic domains in addition to the catalytic Sec7 domain were considered. For GBF1 (Table 2A) and BIG1 (Table 2B), only one interaction was detected in addition to the DCB/DCB interaction described above. In both cases, a strong interaction between the DCB and HUS domains of each ArfGEF was observed (Fig. 3, sectors 3 and 4). This interaction was independent of the variable DCB-HUS linker added on either the DCB or HUS side (Table 2A). A strong interaction was also found between the DCB and HUS domains of human BIG2 (Fig. 3, sector 5).TABLE 2Summary of domain/domain interactions in mammalian ArfGEFs analyzed with the yeast two-hybrid assay Open table in a new tab The HUS box is an almost invariant N(Y/F)DC(D/N) motif, which is predicted to lie between two Œ±-helices (Fig. 1B). Mutation of the central aspartate to alanine in this motif abolished the DCB/HUS interaction in both GBF1 and BIG1 (Fig. 3, sectors 18 and 19). Thus, the HUS box supports the DCB/HUS interaction, which is the first molecular function to be associated with this motif. We then analyzed whether mutations that impair the DCB/DCB interaction (see above) also affect the DCB/HUS interaction. The E130A mutation in GBF1, but not the K91A mutation, abolished the DCB/HUS interaction (Fig. 3, sectors 16 and 17). These results indicate that residue Lys91 is involved only in the DCB/DCB interaction, whereas the Glu130 residue is involved in both interactions.Next, we used the yeast two-hybrid system to analyze DCB/DCB and DCB/HUS interactions within GBF1 constructs spanning more than one domain. We first analyzed the ability of the DCB domain alone to interact with larger ArfGEF fragments. DCBGBF1 interacted with DCB-HUSGBF1, DCB-HUS-Sec7GBF1, and full-length GBF1 (Fig. 3, sectors 7, 8, and 10). Although these yeast two-hybrid interactions appeared to be weaker than the interaction between two DCB domains alone, they strongly suggest that the DCB/DCB interaction occurs also in the context of the full-length GBF1 protein. We then analyzed the DCB/HUS interaction in the context of multiple domains. A strong interaction was found between the DCB domain and a HUS-Sec7 construct (Fig. 3, sector 6). HUSGBF1 also interacted with DCB-HUS-Sec7GBF1 and full-length GBF1 although more weakly than with DCBGBF1 alone (Fig. 3, sectors 14 and 15). In support for the dimerization of the N-terminal region taking place in larger constructs, recombinant DCB-HUS-Sec7BIG1 eluted on a gel filtration column with a molecular weight consistent with a dimer (Fig. 2A).No interactions between the noncatalytic domains other than the DCB/DCB and DCB/HUS interactions were identified with the yeast two-hybrid assay. We also failed to detect an interaction of the noncatalytic domains with the Arf1 substrate (data not shown). In addition, we did not observe any DCB/DCB or DCB/HUS cross-interactions between BIG1, BIG2, and GBF1 in the yeast two-hybrid system (data not shown).Functions of DCB/DCB and DCB/HUS Interactions in Arf-GEF Dimers‚ÄîThe DCB domain has features of a dimeric helical bundle, which is a frequent arrangement in cytosolic proteins involved in membrane recruitment, such as the membrane curvature-sensing BAR domain found in amphiphysins and Arfaptin/POR, an Arf effector (27Peter B.J. Kent H.M. Mills I.G. Vallis Y. Butler P.J. Evans P.R. McMahon H.T. Science. 2004; 303: 495-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (1334) Google Scholar). We thus investigated the binding of DCBBIG1 to liposomes of various compositions using a sedimentation assay (Table 1 and Fig. 4A). However, no such interaction could be observed regardless of the liposome composition, suggesting that the DCB homodimer does not have membrane-binding properties on its own.FIGURE 4Function of the DCB/DCB and DCB/HUS interactions.

https://openalex.org/W2080197177,"The population genetics and structure of P. falciparum determine the rate at which malaria evolves in response to interventions such as drugs and vaccines. This has been the source of considerable recent controversy, but here we demonstrate the organism to be essentially sexual, in an area of moderately high transmission in the Lower Shire Valley, Malawi. Seven thousand mosquitoes were collected and dissected, and genetic data were obtained on 190 oocysts from 56 infected midguts. The oocysts were genotyped at three microsatellite loci and the MSP1 locus. Selfing rate was estimated as 50% and there was significant genotypic linkage disequilibrium (LD) in the pooled oocysts. A more appropriate analysis searching for genotypic LD in outcrossed oocysts and/or haplotypic LD in the selfed oocysts found no evidence for LD, indicating that the population was effectively sexual. Inbreeding estimates at MSP1 were higher than at the microsatellites, possibly indicative of immune action against MSP1, but the effect was confounded by the probable presence of null mutations. Mating appeared to occur at random in mosquitoes and evidence regarding whether malaria clones in the same host were related (presumably through simultaneous inoculation in the same mosquito bite) was ambiguous. This is the most detailed genetic analysis yet of P. falciparum sexual stages, and shows P. falciparum to be a sexual organism whose genomes are in linkage equilibrium, which acts to slow the emergence of drug resistance and vaccine insensitivity, extending the likely useful therapeutic lifespan of drugs and vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W1977177530,"The storage tissues of many plants contain protease inhibitors that are believed to play an important role in defending the plant from invasion by pests and pathogens. These proteinaceous inhibitor molecules belong to a number of structurally distinct families. We describe here the isolation, purification, initial inhibitory properties, and three-dimensional structure of a novel trypsin inhibitor from seeds of Veronica hederifolia (VhTI). The VhTI peptide inhibits trypsin with a submicromolar apparent K(i) and is expected to be specific for trypsin-like serine proteases. VhTI differs dramatically in structure from all previously described families of trypsin inhibitors, consisting of a helix-turn-helix motif, with the two alpha helices tightly associated by two disulfide bonds. Unusually, the crystallized complex is in the form of a stabilized acyl-enzyme intermediate with the scissile bond of the VhTI inhibitor cleaved and the resulting N-terminal portion of the inhibitor remaining attached to the trypsin catalytic serine 195 by an ester bond. A synthetic, truncated version of the VhTI peptide has also been produced and co-crystallized with trypsin but, surprisingly, is seen to be uncleaved and consequently forms a noncovalent complex with trypsin. The VhTI peptide shows that effective enzyme inhibitors can be constructed from simple helical motifs and provides a new scaffold on which to base the design of novel serine protease inhibitors."

The parasite makes several essential glycoproteins, which has led to the investigation of the sugar nucleotides and glycosyltransferases required to synthesize these structures. Fucose is a common sugar in glycoconjugates from many organisms; however, the sugar nucleotide donor GDP-fucose was only recently detected in T. brucei, and the importance of fucose metabolism in this organism is not known. In this paper, we identified the genes encoding functional GDP-fucose biosynthesis enzymes in T. brucei and created conditional null mutants of TbGMD, the gene encoding the first enzyme in the pathway from GDP-mannose to GDP-fucose, in both bloodstream form and procyclic form parasites. Under nonpermissive conditions, both life cycle forms of the parasite became depleted in GDP-fucose and suffered growth arrest, demonstrating that fucose metabolism is essential to both life cycle stages. In procyclic form parasites, flagellar detachment from the cell body was also observed under nonpermissive conditions, suggesting that fucose plays a significant role in flagellar adhesion.

Typanosomatid parasites are protozoan parasites that impose a major health burden on many countries in the developing world, causing a wide range of diseases over three continents. Trypanosoma brucei is the causative agent of African sleeping sickness in humans and nagana in cattle and is spread between mammalian hosts by the bite of the tsetse fly (Glossina sp.). T. brucei transmission occurs when the bloodstream form of the parasite is ingested by a tsetse fly during feeding; the parasite then differentiates into the procyclic form in order to colonize the tsetse fly mid gut. The parasite undergoes further differentiation and migration to the salivary gland of the fly in order to infect a new mammalian host upon a subsequent blood meal.

Sugar nucleotides are activated forms of sugars that are used as the ultimate source of sugar for the majority of glycosylation reactions. Sugar nucleotides are formed in two main ways: by a salvage pathway involving ‚Äúactivation‚Äù of the sugar using a kinase and a pryophosphorylase or by a ‚Äúde novo‚Äù pathway involving the bioconversion of an existing sugar/sugar nucleotide. In most cases, sugar nucleotides are synthesized in the cytoplasm and then transported through specific transporters into the lumen of the Golgi apparatus and/or endoplasmic reticulum, where they are used by glycosyltransferases as donor substrates in glycosylation reactions (18Gerardy-Schahn R. Oelmann S. Bakker H. Biochimie (Paris). 2001; 83: 775-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 19Berninsone P.M. Hirschberg C.B. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 542-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The sugar nucleotide GDP-fucose has been found in a wide variety of different organisms, ranging from bacteria to humans (20Becker D.J. Lowe J.B. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 41R-53RCrossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar, 21Ma B. Simala-Grant J.L. Taylor D.E. Glycobiology. 2006; 16: 158R-184RCrossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Two pathways for the biosynthesis of GDP-fucose have been identified. The first is a three-step conversion of GDP-mannose to GDP-fucose catalyzed by two enzymes, a GDP-mannose dehydratase (GMD 2The abbreviations used are: GMDGDP-mannose 4,6-dehydrataseGMERGDP-4-keto-6-deoxymannose epimerase reductasePBSphosphate-buffered salineHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyLC-MS/MShigh performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometryMOPS3-(n-morpholino)propanesulfonic acidGSTglutathione S-transferaseORFopen reading frameHAhemagglutininUTRuntranslated regionRTreverse transcriptionGAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenaseTRITCtetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate. ; EC 4.2.1.47) and a GDP-fucose synthetase, also known as GDP-4-dehydro-6-deoxy-d-mannose epimerase/reductase (GMER; EC 1.1.1.271) (20Becker D.J. Lowe J.B. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 41R-53RCrossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). The second is a salvage pathway involving the phosphorylation of fucose by a fucose kinase, followed by condensation with GTP catalyzed by a fucose-1-phosphate pyrophosphorylase (20Becker D.J. Lowe J.B. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 41R-53RCrossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar).

Relatively little is known about the role of fucose in the trypanosomatid parasites. In T. cruzi, fucose has been found as a minor component in the N-glycans of the cruzipain cysteine protease (31Barboza M. Duschak V.G. Fukuyama Y. Nonami H. Erra-Balsells R. Cazzulo J.J. Couto A.S. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 3803-3815Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and in a glycoprotein called gp72, where it is found together with rhamnose, xylose, galactopyranose, galactofuranose, and N-acetylglucosamine in unique complex glycans attached to Thr and Ser via phosphodiester linkages (32Snary D. Ferguson M.A. Scott M.T. Allen A.K. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1981; 3: 343-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 33Ferguson M.A. Allen A.K. Snary D. Biochem.

Ferguson M.A. Cross G.A. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 869-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). gp72 is nonessential in culture but has a role in flagellar adhesion in the epimastigote form of the parasite. Thus, the epimastigote form of T. cruzi has a detached flagellum when the gp72 gene is deleted (36Cooper R. de Jesus A.R. Cross G.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), although the rest of the flagellar adhesion zone structure appears to be normal, as judged by electron and light microscopy (37Rocha G.M. Brandao B.A. Mortara R.A. Attias M. de Souza W. Carvalho T.M. J. Struct. Biol. 2006; 154: 89-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Other experiments have shown that gp72 is required for infection of both the insect vector and mammalian host (38de Jesus A.R. Cooper R. Espinosa M. Gomes J.E. Garcia E.S. Paul S. Cross G.A. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 1023-1033PubMed Google Scholar, 39Basombrio M.A. Gomez L. Padilla A.M. Ciaccio M. Nozaki T. Cross G.A. J. Parasitol. 2002; 88: 489-493Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the exact role of the fucose-containing glycan in the function of the protein is not known. No fucosylated structures have been identified in T. brucei to date. However, T. brucei has two homologues of gp72, called Fla-1 (40Nozaki T. Haynes P.A. Cross G.A. Mol Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 82: 245-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and Fla-2 (41LaCount D.J. Barrett B. Donelson J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17580-17588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Inducible RNA interference studies have shown that knockdown of Fla-1 mRNA in T. brucei, like the gp72 null mutant in T. cruzi, caused a defect in flagellar adhesion (41LaCount D.J. Barrett B. Donelson J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17580-17588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). This suggests, indirectly, that Fla-1 and possibly Fla-2 are candidates for being fucosylated glycoproteins in T. brucei. In this work, we demonstrate that the putative T. brucei GDP-fucose biosynthesis enzymes are functional in vitro by expressing them as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins in Escherichia coli and then detecting GDP-fucose production using a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-based assay. We analyzed the function of fucose in T. brucei by making a conditional null mutant in the first enzyme of the GDP-fucose biosynthesis pathway in both the bloodstream and procyclic form life cycle stages. We show that mutation of the T. brucei GDP-mannose 4,6-dehydratase gene (TbGMD) results in loss of GDP-fucose from intracellular pools, a reduction in growth rate, and flagellar detachment in the procyclic form. We also show that epitope-tagged TbGMD protein localizes to the glycosome in procyclic form T. brucei. Parasite Culture‚ÄîT. brucei bloodstream form parasites (strain 427, variant MITaT1.2) that express T7 polymerase and tetracycline repressor protein under G418 selection (42Wirtz E. Leal S. Ochatt C. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar) were cultured in HMI-9 medium (43Hirumi H. Hirumi K. J. Parasitol. 1989; 75: 985-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar) up to a maximum density of 3 √ó 106 cells/ml at 37 ¬∞C with 5% CO2. For extraction of genomic DNA, RNA, and sugar nucleotides, cells were harvested at ‚àº1 √ó 106/ml. T. brucei procyclic form parasites that express T7 polymerase and tetracycline repressor protein under G418 and hygromycin selection (cell line 29:13) were cultured in SDM-79 medium (44Brun R. Schonenberger M. Acta Trop. 1979; 36: 289-292PubMed Google Scholar) up to a maximum cell density of 5 √ó 107 cells/ml at 28 ¬∞C. For extraction of genomic DNA, RNA, and sugar nucleotides, cells were harvested at ‚àº1 √ó 107/ml. Cloning, Expression, and Assay of GDP-fucose Biosynthesis Genes in E. coli‚ÄîFor overexpression in E. coli, the TbGMD and TbGMER genes were amplified by PCR with the following forward and reverse primers to add either BamHI, EcoRI, or XhoI restriction sites (underlined): 5‚Ä≤-cccggatccATGTCAGCACGTCGACTGGC-3‚Ä≤ and 5‚Ä≤-gcgaattcCTATTGCCCCGCTGCTCAACAC-3‚Ä≤ for TbGMD, and 5‚Ä≤-cccggatccATGTTAGGGTCCCTACCGAGT-3‚Ä≤ and 5‚Ä≤-cgcctcgagCTTCCGTGCGACATCGTAGTT-3‚Ä≤ for TbGMER. The PCR products were digested with appropriate restriction enzymes and cloned into the pGEX 4T expression vector (Amersham Biosciences) and expressed in BL21 (DE3) E. coli cells. Cultures of 1-liter culture were grown to an A600 of 0.5, and expression was induced overnight at room temperature with 100 Œºm isopropyl-Œ≤-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Cells were harvested and lysed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 1 mg/ml lysozyme for 30 min on ice. Complete lysis was ensured by sonication (Soniprep-150; Sanyo) or cell disruption (one-shot cell disruptor, constant cell disruption systems) in the presence of Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 30,000 √ó g for 20 min before adding the supernatant to ‚àº300 Œºl of PBS-washed GST beads (Amersham Biosciences) and incubating for 1 h at 4 ¬∞C. The beads were then washed with >10 bead volumes of PBS before three elutions of 300 Œºl with 10 mm glutathione in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Assay conditions were adapted from Ref. 23Sullivan F.X. Kumar R. Kriz R. Stahl M. Xu G.Y. Rouse J. Chang X.J. Boodhoo A. Potvin B. Cumming D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8193-8202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar. Reactions were performed in 100 Œºl of 100 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm EDTA, 25 Œºm GDP-mannose (Sigma), 10 Œºm NADPH, and 100 Œºm NADP. The reaction was started by adding ‚àº25 Œºg of the recombinant TbGMD enzyme (preincubated at ‚àº1 mg/ml with 100 Œºm NADP for 30 min at 4 ¬∞C), and the reaction was left to proceed for 1 h at 37 ¬∞C. Recombinant TbGMER (‚àº25 Œºg) was then added, and the concentration of NADPH was adjusted to 150 Œºm. For experiments without the TbGMER enzyme, only NADPH was added at this point. Reactions were stopped after 1 h at 37 ¬∞C by heating to 100 ¬∞C for 2 min, and then the samples were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm to remove insoluble material. Sugar nucleotides were purified using EnviCarb columns (45Rabina J. Maki M. Savilahti E.M. Jarvinen N. Penttila L. Renkonen R. Glycoconj. J. 2001; 18: 799-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and analyzed by LC-MS/MS (46Turnock D.C. Ferguson M.A. Eukaryot. Cell. 2007; 6: 1450-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Cloning and Overexpression of TbGMD in T. brucei‚ÄîThe TbGMD ORF was amplified from genomic DNA by PCR using the forward and reverse primers to add either a HindIII or PacI restriction site (underlined): 5‚Ä≤-cccaagcttATGTCAGCACGTCGACTGGC-3‚Ä≤ and 5‚Ä≤-ccttaattaaGCTGGTTTCGGCGGTAATGC-3‚Ä≤, respectively. The resulting PCR product was digested with HindIII and PacI and cloned into a modified pLew82 vector (42Wirtz E. Leal S. Ochatt C. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar) for expression with a C-terminal HA tag. The resulting construct was linearized with NotI and electroporated into the procyclic cell line 29:13 (42Wirtz E. Leal S. Ochatt C. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar). Transformants were selected with phleomycin, and expression of the ectopic copy was induced by the addition of tetracycline at 0.5 Œºg/ml. The TbGMD ORF was also amplified from genomic DNA by PCR using primers 5‚Ä≤-cccaagcttATGTCAGCACGTCGACTGGC-3‚Ä≤ and 5‚Ä≤-cccggatccTCAGCTGGTTTCGGCGGTAATG-3‚Ä≤. The primers added either HindIII or BamHI restriction sites (underlined) to the PCR products to allow cloning into the pLew100 expression vector (42Wirtz E. Leal S. Ochatt C. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar) for use in constructing conditional null mutants. Immunofluorescence Microscopy‚ÄîT. brucei procyclic form cells expressing HA-tagged TbGMD were grown in SDM-79 to a cell density of ‚àº1 √ó 107/ml, and ‚àº2 √ó 107 cells were washed and resuspended in PBS to a density of 4 √ó 107/ml. A small volume of cells (10-15 Œºl) were placed upon circular 13-mm coverslips (VWR) in a 12-well plate (Helena) and left at room temperature for 15 min to adhere. The cells were then fixed in 2 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min and then washed three times in PBS. The coverslips were either stored at 4 ¬∞C in PBS plus 0.01% sodium azide or immediately prepared for immunofluorescence. Cells were permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 20 min and then blocked for 1 h in 0.5% bovine serum albumin in PBS before staining with either rat anti-HA (1:20 dilution; Roche Applied Science) or rabbit anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) anti-serum (1:2000; a kind gift of Dr. Opperdoes, Catholic University of Louvain) in 0.5% bovine serum albumin, PBS. The coverslips were washed three times in PBS before staining with secondary antibody, either anti-rat fluorescein isothiocyanate (1:30 dilution; Dako Cytomation) or anti-rabbit rhodamine (1:200 dilution; Dako Cytomation) as above. Excess secondary antibody was removed by washing three times in PBS. The coverslips were then mounted on polylysine slides using Hydromount (VWR) and left to dry in the dark for 30 min. Slides were examined on a Zeiss Axiovert 200 m fluorescence microscope, and images were analyzed and processed using Axiovision software. TbGMD Gene Replacements‚ÄîApproximately 500 bp of each of the TbGMD 5‚Ä≤- and 3‚Ä≤-UTR sequences were amplified from genomic DNA by PCR using primers: 5‚Ä≤-ataagaatgcggccgcGTTGAACACGAGGGGAATGT-3‚Ä≤ and 5‚Ä≤-gtttaaacttacggaccgtcaagcttACTGAACGGCTCCTAATGAG-3‚Ä≤ for the 5‚Ä≤-UTR and primers 5‚Ä≤-gacggtccgtaagtttaaacggatccGTGTTGAGCAGCGGG-3‚Ä≤ and 5‚Ä≤-ataagtaagcggccgcGAGCGGAGCATAGTTTGTAG-3‚Ä≤ for the 3‚Ä≤-UTR. The two PCR products were used together in a further PCR to yield a product containing the 5‚Ä≤-UTR linked to the 3‚Ä≤-UTR by a short HindIII and BamHI cloning site (underlined and in italics) and NotI restriction sites at each end (in boldface type). The PCR product was cloned into the pGEM-5Zf(+) vector (Promega) using the two NotI sites. To make the constructs for gene replacement in the procyclic form, the PAC and BSD drug resistance genes were simply introduced using the HindIII and BamHI restriction sites. To make the constructs for bloodstream form electroporation, HYG and PAC genes flanked by a T7 promoter and two T7 terminator sequences were amplified by PCR using a modified pLew82 vector (42Wirtz E. Leal S. Ochatt C. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar) containing either the HYG or PAC genes as a template. The primers used were 5‚Ä≤-ccggaaccttaagATAATACGACTCACTAAGGG-3‚Ä≤ and 5‚Ä≤-ccgagatctCTGCAGGGGCCCTATC-3‚Ä≤, which added Bst98I and BglII restriction sites (underlined), respectively, to the PCR products. The PCR products were digested with Bst98I and BglII restriction enzymes and cloned into a Bst98I- and BamHI-digested pGEM-5zF vector containing the 5‚Ä≤- and 3‚Ä≤-UTR flanking regions. Transformation of T. brucei‚ÄîConstructs for gene replacement and ectopic expression were purified using the Qiagen Maxiprep kit, digested with NotI to linearize, precipitated, washed twice with 70% ethanol, and redissolved in sterile water. The linearized DNA was electroporated into either T. brucei bloodstream cells (strain 427, variant 221) or T. brucei procyclic form cells (strain 29:13) that were stably transformed to express T7 RNA polymerase and the tetracycline repressor protein under G418 selection (42Wirtz E. Leal S. Ochatt C. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar). Cell culture and transformation was carried out as previously described (15Roper J.R. Guther M.L. Milne K.G. Ferguson M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Southern Blotting‚ÄîGenomic DNA was isolated from T. brucei cultures, digested with various restriction enzymes, and separated by agarose gel electrophoresis. A fluorescein-labeled TbGMD ORF probe was prepared by PCR using the primers 5‚Ä≤-TCTGCATTACGGAGATATGACG-3‚Ä≤ and 5‚Ä≤-ACACCCAATCATCTGGCTTATC-3‚Ä≤. The probe was labeled using the Gene Images random prime labeling kit (GE Healthcare); 250 ng of template was used in a reaction volume of 50 Œºl and incubated for 90 min, and aliquots of 5 Œºl were used per Southern blot. The labeled probe was then detected using the Gene Images CDP-Star detection kit (GE Healthcare). RT-PCR‚ÄîT. brucei RNA (1 Œºg) was extracted from 2 √ó 107 T. brucei cells using Qiagen midi RNeasy extraction kits with on-column DNase digestion (RNase-free DNase; Qiagen). RNA samples were then treated with Ominiscript reverse transcriptase (Qiagen) to generate cDNA.

Alternatively, RT-PCR was carried out on ‚àº50 ng of T. brucei RNA extracted from 5 √ó 106 cells using Qiagen mini RNeasy extraction kits with on-column DNase digestion.

Sugar Nucleotide Analysis‚ÄîSugar nucleotide analysis was performed as described elsewhere (46Turnock D.C. Ferguson M.A. Eukaryot.

Briefly, cells were pelleted by centrifugation, washed in ice-cold PBS, and lysed in 70% ethanol in the presence of 10 pmol of GDP-glucose internal standard, and sugar nucleotides were extracted using EnviCarb columns (45Rabina J.

Reducing the net positive charge of loop 2 significantly decreased both the affinity of myosin V for actin and the processive run length.

We hypothesize that a high affinity for actin allows the detached head of a stepping myosin V to find its next actin binding site more quickly, thus decreasing the probability of run termination. Myosin Va is a processive actin-based motor protein involved in intracellular cargo transport and membrane trafficking (1Reck-Peterson S.L. Provance Jr., D.W. Mooseker M.S. Mercer J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1496: 36-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). It takes 36-nm steps along an actin filament in a hand-over-hand fashion, with the trailing and leading heads swapping position during each step (2Yildiz A. Forkey J.N. McKinney S.A. Ha T.

Myosin V has both structural and kinetic adaptations that allow it to be an efficient processive motor (4Vale R.D. J.

In contrast, the rate-limiting step for low duty cycle, non-processive class II myosins is phosphate release, and thus these motors spend the majority of their ATPase cycle detached from actin in a weak binding state. The long (‚àº24 nm) lever arm allows myosin V to take 36-nm steps, equal to the semi-repeat of actin (8Walker M.L. Burgess S.A. Sellers J.R. Wang F. Hammer J.A. II I Trinick J. Knight P.J.

Loop 2, a surface loop implicated in the initial weak electrostatic interaction with actin, is longer and more positively charged in myosin V than in class II myosins, resulting in a higher affinity for actin in the presence of MgATP (13Yengo C.M. De la Cruz E.M. Safer D. Ostap E.M. Sweeney H.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8508-8517Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 14Yengo C.M. Sweeney H.L. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2605-2612Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Loop 2 is disordered in the myosin V crystal structure (Protein Data Bank code 1oeq) (15Coureux P.D. Wells A.L.

Trybus K.M. Hanein D. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 595-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The position of loop 2 in various nucleotide states was identified from discrepancy mapping, a technique that identifies regions of the three-dimensional electron microscopy reconstruction that have more density than can be accounted for by the docked atomic models. By these methods, loop 2 was shown to undergo significant rearrangements in different nucleotide states (16Volkmann N. Liu H. Hazelwood L. Krementsova E.B. Lowey S. Trybus K.M. Hanein D. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 595-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In the weakly bound transition state, when a leading head is searching for a new binding site on actin to continue forward motion, loop 2 maintains contact with actin and appears to act as a tether (16Volkmann N.

Increasing the net positive charge of loop 2 increases the affinity of myosin for actin (14Yengo C.M. Sweeney H.L. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2605-2612Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 17Furch M. Geeves M.A. Manstein D.J.

Life Sci. 2005; 62: 1462-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). We previously showed that replacing loop 2 of mouse myosin V (net loop charge of +5) with the corresponding loop from a yeast class V myosin (Myo4p, net loop charge of 0) caused a dramatic reduction in processive run lengths, especially at high ionic strength (20Krementsova E.B. Hodges A.R. Lu H. Trybus K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6079-6086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We concluded that a highly charged loop 2 and a high affinity for actin were necessary for optimal processivity. The yeast loop 2, however, is substantially shorter than the mouse loop 2 (31 versus 44 residues) and has little sequence homology. Here we take a more systematic approach by engineering mutations in loop 2 of murine myosin V that increase or decrease the net positive charge by three. The processive run lengths correlate with the net positive charge in loop 2, which also determines the affinity for actin in the presence of MgATP. During processive motion, myosin V goes through an intermediate state in which the rear head is strongly attached to actin, and the lead head undergoes a diffusive search for the next actin binding site (4Vale R.D. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 445-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 5Sellers J.R. Veigel C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2006; 18: 68-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 21Dunn A.R. Spudich J.A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 246-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). We propose that a high affinity for actin ensures that the lead head finds the next binding site faster, thus reducing the lifetime of the vulnerable singly bound intermediate and increasing processive run lengths. Myosin V Constructs‚ÄîThe myosin V constructs used in this study were engineered to contain a biotin tag at the C terminus for attachment to streptavidin-coated quantum dots (Qdots) (Invitrogen).

Chem. 1992; 267: 855-863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and a FLAG tag to facilitate purification.

For the AAA mutant, 3 lysines (Lys-629, Lys-632, and Lys-633) in the C-terminal region of loop 2 were changed to alanines (Fig. 2). For Plus8, 2 threonines (Thr-605 and Thr-627) were changed to lysines, and a glutamic acid (Glu-630) was changed to glutamine. Monomeric versions of the wild type and of each mutant, truncated at amino acid 820 and followed by a FLAG tag, were also generated. These constructs contained only two IQ motifs, each of which binds a calmodulin. wild-type mouse myosin V a myosin V mutant with reduced charge in loop 2 a myosin V mutant with increased charge in loop 2 total internal reflection fluorescence heavy meromyosin calmodulin Protein Expression and Purification‚ÄîMyosin constructs were expressed in Sf9 cells using the baculovirus system and purified on a FLAG affinity column as described previously (20Krementsova E.B.

The myosin constructs were co-expressed with CaMŒîall, a calmodulin mutant lacking all calcium binding sites (24Krementsov D.N. Krementsova E.B. Trybus K.M. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 877-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). CaMŒîall was also expressed in bacteria and purified as described previously (24Krementsov D.N. Krementsova E.B. Trybus K.M. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 877-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Chicken skeletal actin was prepared from acetone powder (25Pardee J.D. Spudich J.A. Methods Cell Biol. 1982; 24: 271-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Steady-state Actin-activated ATPases and Pelleting Assays‚ÄîNADH-linked actin-activated ATPase assays were performed at 30 ¬∞C, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm MgATP, and 0.12 Œºm myosin, as described previously (20Krementsova E.B. Hodges A.R. Lu H. Trybus K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6079-6086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Pelleting assays as a function of actin concentration were performed in 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgATP, and 12 Œºm exogenous CaMŒîall. The buffers for the pelleting assays also contained an ATP-regenerating system (0.1 mg/ml creatine phosphokinase and 1 mg/ml creatine phosphate). Myosin (0.39 Œºm) and varying concentrations of actin were spun for 20 min at 400,000 √ó g to pellet the actomyosin complex. The amount of myosin left in the supernatant was quantified by SDS-PAGE and gel densitometry. Controls showed that all the myosin was in the pellet in the absence of nucleotide and that no myosin pelleted in the absence of actin. The pelleting assays were performed at 4 ¬∞C to slow the ATPase rate. At higher temperatures, the MgATP was hydrolyzed too quickly, such that all the myosin bound to actin in the pellet. The Kd was calculated by fitting the equation f = x/(Kd + x) to a plot of f versus x, where f is the fraction of myosin in the pellet, and x is the actin concentration. TIRF Microscopy‚ÄîSingle molecule motility assays using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy were performed using the system described previously (20Krementsova E.B. Hodges A.R. Lu H. Trybus K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6079-6086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 26Baker J.E. Krementsova E.B. Kennedy G.G. Armstrong A. Trybus K.M. Warshaw D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 5542-5546Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The myosin V HMM constructs (0.2 Œºm) were mixed with a 2-fold molar excess of actin and 1 mm MgATP and centrifuged for 20 min at 400,000 √ó g to remove any myosin that was unable to dissociate from actin in the presence of ATP. The supernatant was then mixed with 655 or 705 nm streptavidin-coated quantum dots (Invitrogen) and incubated on ice for at least 15 min. The mixing ratio was one myosin per 20 Qdots to ensure that ‚àº98% of moving Qdots were transported by only a single myosin V. At a mixing ratio of one myosin per Qdot, ‚àº38% of all moving Qdots are transported by two myosins, and the run lengths are about 70% higher. These percentages were calculated using the binomial distribution to calculate the percentage of Qdots with one myosin bound versus the percentage with multiple myosins bound. In these calculations, we assume six biotin binding sites per Qdot, based on experimental results from a direct binding assay. Flow cells were prepared by first incubating with 0.3 mg/ml N-ethylmaleimide-modified myosin for 5 min, rinsed with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and incubated for 2 min to block the surface, then incubated with 0.5 Œºm rhodamine-phalloidin labeled actin filaments for 2‚Äì5 min, and then rinsed with motility buffer (25 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, 1 mm MgATP, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 50 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 6.0 Œºm CaMŒîall, an oxygen-scavenging system (3 mg/ml glucose, 0.1 mg/ml glucose oxidase, 0.18 mg/ml catalase), an ATP-regenerating system (0.5 mm phosphoenolpyruvate and 100 units/ml pyruvate kinase), and either 50 mm or 150 mm KCl. Finally, Qdot-labeled myosin was diluted to between 0.05 and 0.5 nm in motility buffer and added to the flow cell, which was sealed with grease to prevent evaporation. Through-the-objective TIRF microscopy was performed at 30 ¬∞C. The final pixel resolution was 55 nm, and data were collected at six frames/second. Myosin movement along fluorescently labeled actin filaments was tracked by hand, using the program ImageJ. For each event, we required the quantum dot-labeled construct to move continuously for at least three frames (AAA) or four frames (WT and Plus8) to qualify as a run. This was necessary to distinguish between directed movement and Brownian motion. We used the lower number for AAA because there were very few runs, and the runs were very short. The characteristic run length Œª was determined by nonlinear least squares fitting of the function P(x) = Ae-x/Œª to the run length distribution, where P(x) is the probability of the myosin traveling a distance x along an actin filament, and A is a constant. Expressed Constructs‚ÄîWT mouse myosin V HMM and two mutants with point mutations in loop 2 were expressed using the baculovirus/Sf9 cell system. For the first mutant, called AAA, 3 lysines in the C-terminal region of loop 2 were replaced with alanines, reducing the net charge of the loop from +5 to +2 (Fig. 2). The second mutant, called Plus8, had three point mutations, which increased the net charge of the loop to +8. Monomeric versions of each construct, truncated after the second IQ motif, were used for actin-activated ATPase and actin-pelleting experiments. HMM versions were used for single molecule experiments and included a biotin tag at the C terminus to label the molecules with streptavidin-coated quantum dots. Net Charge of Loop 2 Determines Affinity for Actin‚ÄîActin-activated ATPase assays were performed on the WT and two mutant monomeric constructs in 50 mm KCl at 30 ¬∞C (Fig. 3). The data for each construct were fit with the Michaelis-Menten equation to determine the maximal ATPase rate (Vmax) and the actin concentration at half-maximal activation (Km). The mutations in loop 2 had no effect on the maximal ATPase rate. Vmax was equal within experimental uncertainty for each of the three constructs, ‚àº20 s-1 (Table 1). In contrast, the Km values were strongly affected by the changes in loop 2. The Km for WT was 2.3 Œºm. For AAA, the Km increased to 19.6 Œºm, whereas for Plus8, it decreased to 1.5 Œºm. Km primarily represents the affinity for actin in the weak binding state (20Krementsova E.B. Hodges A.R. Lu H. Trybus K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6079-6086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Relative to WT, AAA has a much reduced affinity for actin in the presence of ATP, whereas Plus8 has a slightly increased affinity for actin.TABLE 1Comparison of WT and the loop 2 mutants Speed and run length (Œª) are from single molecule experiments performed with HMM. Monomeric constructs were used to obtain Km and Vmax from ATPase assays, and Kd from actin pelleting assays. All values are reported with the standard error of the fit, except for the speed, which is shown with its standard deviation. The characteristic run length of both mutants was statistically different from WT at the 99% confidence level (**), except for WT and Plus8 in 50 mm KCl, where the confidence level was 90% (*). Characteristic run lengths calculated using cumulative frequency analysis differed slightly, but the trends and conclusions remained the same. These results and a discussion of the relative strengths and weaknesses of each analysis method are presented in the supplemental data.ConstructLoop 2 ChargeKClSpeedŒªKmVmaxKdmmŒºm/sŒºmŒºms‚Äì1ŒºmPlus8+8500.99 ¬± 0.242.4 ¬± 0.1*1.5 ¬± 0.221.0 ¬± 0.710 ¬± 3WT+5500.94 ¬± 0.321.8 ¬± 0.22.3 ¬± 0.320.4 ¬± 0.516 ¬± 2AAA+2500.96 ¬± 0.280.50 ¬± 0.02**19.6 ¬± 7.017.7 ¬± 3.5167 ¬± 34Plus8+81501.02 ¬± 0.312.4 ¬± 0.2**WT+51501.22 ¬± 0.291.3 ¬± 0.1AAA+21501.12 ¬± 0.320.39 ¬± 0.03** Open table in a new tab The Kd of each construct was also measured with an actin-pelleting assay. Each construct was centrifuged with actin and MgATP, and the distribution of myosin in the supernatant and pellet was quantified as a function of actin concentration. The Kd values follow the same trend as the Km values (Table 1). The Kd is lowest for Plus8 (10 Œºm), slightly higher for WT (16 Œºm), and much higher for AAA (167 Œºm). Consistent with the ATPase data, the affinity of AAA for actin is much lower than that of WT, whereas it is higher for Plus8. Note that the ATPase assay was performed at 30 ¬∞C, whereas the pelleting assay was performed at 4 ¬∞C. The pelleting assay takes a longer time and requires higher protein concentration than the ATPase assay. The lower temperature was necessary to slow the ATP hydrolysis rate and allow the ATP-regenerating system to prevent ADP buildup. Monomeric constructs were used for ATPase and pelleting assays to probe the kinetics of the weakly bound head. Dimers are not suitable for these experiments because they move processively along actin after the initial encounter with the filament, with at least one of the two heads in the strongly bound state. For results of ATPase assays on the HMM constructs and a comparison with the monomeric constructs, see the supplemental data. Higher Affinity for Actin Results in Longer Processive Runs‚ÄîTIRF microscopy was used to determine the processive run length of each construct. Single myosin V HMM molecules labeled with quantum dots were tracked as they walked along fluorescently labeled actin filaments attached to a coverslip. For each construct, the characteristic run length Œª, the average speed, and the total number of processive runs in both 50 mm and 150 mm KCl were determined. In 50 mm KCl, the run lengths were 0.50 Œºm for AAA, 1.8 Œºm for WT, and 2.4 Œºm for Plus8. The same trend was observed in 150 mm KCl but with slightly shorter run lengths (Fig. 4). The characteristic run length correlates with the apparent affinity for actin, with a higher affinity resulting in longer runs (Table 1). The number of processive runs observed for each construct also correlates with the apparent affinity for actin, with a higher affinity resulting in more runs. In 50 mm KCl and 0.5 nm myosin, we saw an average of 214 runs for Plus8, 65 runs for WT, and 9 runs for AAA over the same time period and same area. The trend persisted in 150 mm KCl. In contrast, the average speed of each construct was very similar, from 0.94 to 0.99 Œºm/s in 50 mm KCl and from 1.02 to 1.22 Œºm/s in 150 mm KCl (Table 1). This is in agreement with the ATPase data, which showed that changes in loop 2 do not affect the maximal ATPase rate. The processivity of myosin V is greatly affected by the net charge of loop 2. Decreasing the net charge below that of the wild type results in much shorter run lengths, whereas increasing the net charge results in longer run lengths. The charge changes in loop 2 affect the affinity for actin in the weak binding state but not the ATPase rate, in agreement with earlier results (14Yengo C.M. Sweeney H.L. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2605-2612Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 20Krementsova E.B. Hodges A.R. Lu H. Trybus K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6079-6086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). A high affinity for actin in the weak binding state therefore appears to be necessary for optimal processive movement of myosin V. Loop 2 has been shown to be involved in the initial weak binding of myosin to actin via an electrostatic interaction between positively charged lysine residues in loop 2 and negatively charged residues in subdomain 1 of actin (Fig. 1) (reviewed in Ref. 19Geeves M.A. Fedorov R. Manstein D.J. CMLS Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 1462-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). A detailed kinetic characterization of the AAA mutant and a loop 2 mutant with increased positive charge in monomeric chicken myosin V (14Yengo C.M. Sweeney H.L. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2605-2612Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) further showed that the rate of binding of myosin V-ADP to actin, but not its detachment from actin, depended on the charge of loop 2. Binding to actin in the absence of nucleotide is already diffusion-limited for WT and cannot increase further, but a decrease in the rate of binding was shown for the AAA mutant. The primary effect of loop 2 thus appears to be on attachment rates to actin. In most models of the myosin V mechanochemical cycle, the attachment rate that is relevant for processive motion is that of the ADP-Pi state (Fig. 5). Protein design studies have shown that association rates can be enhanced by engineering complementary charged residues at the binding interface (27Selzer T. Albeck S. Schreiber G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 537-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). In the case of Œ≤-lactamase and one of its protein inhibitors, altering the electrostatic interaction between the proteins specifically increased the association rate as much as 250-fold, with no effect on the dissociation rate. The specific distribution of charged residues on the binding partners was more important than the net charge in the vicinity of the binding site, implying that an even more processive myosin V could be engineered if the exact charge interactions between loop 2 of myosin V and actin were known in the weak binding state. Processive runs most likely terminate from a singly bound intermediate state, when the attached head detaches before the free head finds its next actin binding site (11Rosenfeld S.S. Sweeney H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40100-40111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 26Baker J.E. Krementsova E.B. Kennedy G.G. Armstrong A. Trybus K.M. Warshaw D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 5542-5546Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). This has recently been shown directly using dark field imaging to track myosin V in which one head was labeled with a gold nanoparticle (21Dunn A.R. Spudich J.A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 246-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Approximately half of all runs terminate when the labeled head is unattached and freely diffusing. Because only half of the heads are labeled, and the intermediate state can only be detected when the free head is labeled, this implies that most, if not all, runs terminate from the single-head bound intermediate state. A general model of myosin V movement, similar to the model introduced by Rosenfeld and Sweeney (11Rosenfeld S.S. Sweeney H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40100-40111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and used in our previous work (20Krementsova E.B. Hodges A.R. Lu H. Trybus K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6079-6086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), is shown in Fig. 5. Starting in state 1, both heads are in the strongly bound ADP state. The rear head releases ADP at rate kADP, which is the rate-limiting step at saturating ATP concentrations (7De La Cruz E.M. Wells A.L. Rosenfeld S.S. Ostap E.M. Sweeney H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13726-13731Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). ATP binds to the rear head, which dissociates from actin, allowing the attached head to complete its power stroke. At the same time, the detached head is thrust forward, rapidly hydrolyzes ATP, and becomes the new leading head in a pre-power stroke conformation (state 3). The rate k0 is a combination of ATP binding, dissociation from actin, the power stroke, and ATP hydrolysis and is very fast relative to ADP release under our experimental conditions (7De La Cruz E.M. Wells A.L. Rosenfeld S.S. Ostap E.M. Sweeney H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13726-13731Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). The detached lead head undergoes a diffusive search for the next actin binding site and initially binds to actin in a weak binding state. Finally, the front head releases Pi and undergoes a transition to the strong binding state (state 1). The reattachment rate, kreattach, is the rate at which the detached head reattaches to actin in a strong binding state, a process that includes the diffusive search, the weak electrostatic interaction of loop 2 with the next actin binding site, and phosphate release. A processive run can terminate from state 3 if the attached head dissociates from the filament before the front head reattaches in a strong binding state. The characteristic run length (Œª) is thus determined by a competition between kreattach and the rate at which the rear head dissociates from actin (kterm). Œª=36 nm√ó1+kreattachkterm (Eq. 1) The run length is maximized if the time in the vulnerable state 3 is minimized by increasing kreattach. We propose that a high affinity for actin maximizes the reattachment rate. The rate kterm is approximately equal to the unstrained ADP release rate, which is approximately equal to the maximal actin-activated ATPase rate from solution experiments and the same for each of the three constructs (Table 1). Using the measured ATPase rates and run lengths, kreattach was calculated for each of the three constructs: 1379 s-1 for Plus8, 1000 s-1 for WT, and 228 s-1 for AAA. These rates are substantially higher than published phosphate release rates: 110 s-1 (25 ¬∞C, monomeric chicken myosin V (14Yengo C.M. Sweeney H.L. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2605-2612Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), >250 s-1 (25 ¬∞C, monomeric chicken myosin V) (7De La Cruz E.M. Wells A.L. Rosenfeld S.S. Ostap E.M. Sweeney H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13726-13731Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), and 228 s-1 (20 ¬∞C, chicken HMM) (11Rosenfeld S.S. Sweeney H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40100-40111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The composite rate constant kreattach is expected to be slower than the phosphate release rate because it includes other processes. However, our experiments were performed at higher temperatures (30 ¬∞C), and the phosphate release rate, which is not affected by loop 2 (14Yengo C.M. Sweeney H.L. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2605-2612Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), is expected to increase strongly with temperature (11Rosenfeld S.S. Sweeney H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40100-40111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Several current models postulate that the front head of myosin V passes through an ADP isomerization state (Fig. 5, noted as D*) before passing into the standard strongly bound ADP state (12Purcell T.J. Sweeney H.L. Spudich J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13873-13878Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 28Uemura S. Higuchi H. Olivares A.O. De La Cruz E.M. Ishiwata S. Nat.

Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 8826-8840Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Our model does not distinguish between the two possibilities, assuming that if the front head is in either the D or the D* state, it is effectively strongly bound and not vulnerable to termination. A more realistic model might include a D* state with actin affinity intermediate between weak and strong binding that has a non-zero rate of dissociation from actin. An alternative interpretation of our data is that loop 2 mutations affect processive run lengths by changing the rate at which myosin dissociates from actin, as opposed to the reattachment rate (20Krementsova E.B. Hodges A.R. Lu H. Trybus K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6079-6086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Transient kinetic experiments have previously shown that loop 2 charge changes primarily affect attachment rates as opposed to detachment rates (14Yengo C.M. Sweeney H.L. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2605-2612Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and thus a model in which the primary effect is on the reattachment rate is more consistent with existing solution data. In our model, the reattachment step includes the diffusive search of the free head for its next actin binding site followed by the weak electrostatic interaction of loop 2 with actin, and finally, phosphate release. It is likely that only the weak binding component is affected by the loop 2 modifications. This is supported by measurements of the actin-activated phosphate release rate for AAA and WT in monomeric chicken myosin V (14Yengo C.M. Sweeney H.L. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2605-2612Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The maximum phosphate release rate was similar for AAA and WT. However, the actin concentration at which half-maximum was achieved was increased 5-fold for AAA, due to its reduced affinity for actin in the weak binding state. Here we show that a high affinity of myosin V for actin in the presence of ATP is a factor that contributes to long run lengths. A similar result has been observed in kinesin (31Thorn K.S. Ubersax J.A. Vale R.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1093-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Increasing the positive charge of the neck coiled-coil results in longer processive run lengths, whereas adding negative charge leads to a reduction in processivity. The positive charges in the neck coiled-coil are thought to interact with the negatively charged E-hook on tubulin and act as a tether, keeping the free head closer to the microtubule and increasing the rate at which it rebinds. Dynactin bound to dynein has also been shown to interact electrostatically with microtubules to increase the run length of dynein (32King S.J. Schroer T.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 20-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar, 33Culver-Hanlon T.L. Lex S.A. Stephens A.D. Quintyne N.J. King S.J. Nat.

https://openalex.org/W1989442271,"Rab3a is a small GTPase that binds selectively to secretory vesicles and switches between active, GTP-bound and inactive, GDP-bound conformations. In yeast, Rab and SM-genes interact genetically to promote vesicle targeting/fusion. We tested different Rab3a conformations and genetic interactions with the SM-gene munc18-1 on the docking function of Rab3a in mammalian chromaffin cells. We expressed Rab3a mutants locked in the GTP- or GDP-bound form in wild-type and munc18-1 null mutant cells and analyzed secretory vesicle distribution. We confirmed that wild-type Rab3a promotes vesicle docking in wild-type cells. Unexpectedly, both GTP- and GDP-locked Rab3a mutants did not promote docking. Furthermore, wild-type Rab3a did not promote docking in munc18-1 null cells and GTP- and GDP-Rab3a both decreased the amount of docked vesicles. The results show that GTP- and GDP-locked conformations do not support a Munc18-1 dependent role of Rab3a in docking. This suggests that nucleotide cycling is required to support docking and that this action of Rab3a is upstream of Munc18-1."
https://openalex.org/W2161414034,"Human biliverdin reductase (hBVR) is a dual function enzyme: a catalyst for bilirubin formation and a S/T/Y kinase that shares activators with protein kinase C (PKC) -zeta, including cytokines, insulin, and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Presently, we show that hBVR increases PKC-zeta autophosphorylation, stimulation by TNF-alpha, as well as cytokine stimulation of NF-kappaB DNA binding and promoter activity. S149 in hBVR S/T kinase domain and S230 in YLS230F in hBVR's docking site for the SH2 domain of signaling proteins are phosphorylation targets of PKC-zeta. Two hBVR-based peptides, KRNRYLS230F (#1) and KKRILHC281 (#2), but not their S-->A or C-->A derivatives, respectively, blocked PKC-zeta stimulation by TNF-alpha and its membrane translocation. The C-terminal-based peptide KYCCSRK296 (#3), enhanced PKC-zeta stimulation by TNF-alpha; for this, Lys296 was essential. In metabolically 32P-labeled HEK293 cells transfected with hBVR or PKC-zeta, TNF-alpha increased hBVR phosphorylation. TNF-alpha did not stimulate PKC-zeta in cells infected with small interfering RNA for hBVR or transfected with hBVR with a point mutation in the nucleotide-binding loop (G17), S149, or S230; this was similar to the response of ""kinase-dead"" PKC-zeta(K281R). We suggest peptide #1 blocks PKC-zeta-docking site interaction, peptide #2 disrupts function of the PKC-zeta C1 domain, and peptide #3 alters ATP presentation to the kinase. The findings are of potential significance for development of modulators of PKC-zeta activity and cellular response to cytokines."
https://openalex.org/W1996645123,"Glutamate produces both fast excitation through activation of ionotropic receptors and slower actions through metabotropic receptors (mGluRs). To date, ionotropic but not metabotropic neurotransmission has been shown to undergo long-term synaptic potentiation and depression. Burst stimulation of parallel fibers releases glutamate, which activates perisynaptic mGluR1 in the dendritic spines of cerebellar Purkinje cells. Here, we show that the mGluR1-dependent slow EPSC and its coincident Ca transient were selectively and persistently depressed by repeated climbing fiber-evoked depolarization of Purkinje cells in brain slices. LTD(mGluR1) was also observed when slow synaptic current was evoked by exogenous application of a group I mGluR agonist, implying a postsynaptic expression mechanism. Ca imaging further revealed that LTD(mGluR1) was expressed as coincident attenuation of both limbs of mGluR1 signaling: the slow EPSC and PLC/IP3-mediated dendritic Ca mobilization. Thus, different patterns of neural activity can evoke LTD of either fast ionotropic or slow mGluR1-mediated synaptic signaling."

Thermococcus and Pyrococcus species are hyperthermophilic Archaea that preferentially utilize peptides/amino acids for cell growth (1Itoh T. J. Biosci. Bioeng. 2003; 96: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). It is presumed that amino acids are first deaminated to 2-oxo acids by aminotransferases, with 2-oxoglutarate as a key amino acceptor (2Adams M.W.W. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 15: 261-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The generated glutamate is converted back to 2-oxoglutarate by oxidative deamination catalyzed by glutamate dehydrogenase (3Robb F.T. Park J-B. Adams M.W.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1120: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The 2-oxo acids are then converted to CoA thioester compounds by oxidative decarboxylation. Ferredoxin-dependent oxidoreductases catalyze these reactions, and a number of enzymes with distinct substrate specificities have been identified in Pyrococcus furiosus (4Ma K. Hutchins A. Sung S-J.

The enzymes display a common structure and are composed of two Œ±- and two Œ≤-subunits (Œ±2Œ≤2) or are homodimers of Œ±-Œ≤ fusion proteins.

ADP/GDP-forming succinyl-CoA synthetase (SCS) also belongs to this superfamily and catalyzes the reversible conversion of succinyl-CoA to succinate and CoA concomitant with substrate level phosphorylation of ADP/GDP (23Fraser M.E.

Generally, SCS functions in the tricarboxylic acid cycle of aerobic organisms, and it has been suggested that the mammalian ATP-dependent enzyme serves a catabolic role, whereas the GTP-dependent enzyme is involved in succinyl-CoA synthesis (24Fraser M.E.

Many Archaea also possess closely related homologs of SCS on their genomes. Although the SCSs in aerobic Archaea are presumed to function in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, their roles in anaerobic Archaea have not been clarified. Interestingly, despite the presence of 2-oxoglutarate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase homologs, which produce succinyl-CoA from 2-oxoglutarate, genes encoding SCS are missing on the genomes of Thermococcus, Pyrococcus, and Methanosarcina. In this study, we aimed to identify the missing SCS in T. kodakaraensis, which would contribute to the efficient breakdown of glutamate or glutamine. The presence of the enzyme was anticipated from the accumulation of succinate observed in the medium when T. kodakaraensis was grown on amino acids along with pyruvate.

The cell-free extract was subjected to sequential chromatography with a Resource Q anion exchange column (6 ml), a Mono Q HR 5/5 anion exchange column, a HiLoad 26/60 Superdex 200 pg gel filtration column, a Resource ISO hydrophobic column (6 ml), and a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK). The fractions displaying SCS activity were collected and combined. In the cases of anion exchange and hydrophobic chromatography, the proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 0‚Äì1.0 m NaCl and 1.5 to 0 m ammonium sulfate in buffer A, respectively. The protein samples were dialyzed against the initial buffers prior to application. For gel filtration, protein samples concentrated by ultrafiltration with Centricon YM-30 (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) were applied to the columns equilibrated with buffer A containing 150 mm NaCl. The molecular mass was calibrated with standard proteins of thyroglobulin (669 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa), and RNase A (13.7 kDa). Protein concentration was determined with a Bio-Rad protein assay kit using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The N-terminal amino acid sequences of protein bands separated by SDS-PAGE were determined by using a Model 491 cLC protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) after electroblotting the proteins onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp.). Overexpression of SCSTk and ACS IITk Genes in E. coli‚ÄîThe expression plasmids for the SCSTk and ACS IITk genes were constructed as follows. First, the TK1880 and TK0139 genes encoding Œ±-subunits and the TK0943 gene encoding the common Œ≤-subunit were independently amplified from T. kodakaraensis genomic DNA with the following primer sets: TK1880, 5‚Ä≤-CCCTCTAGAAATAATTTTGTTTAACTTTAAGAAGGAGATATACATATGGAGACCCCGAACCTGGACTTCCTG-3‚Ä≤ (sense) and 5‚Ä≤-TTAGGATCCTCAAAGCCTCCCGTTCTCCCTC-3‚Ä≤ (antisense); TK0139, 5‚Ä≤-ATACATATGACGTTCGACTACTTCTTCAAGCC-3‚Ä≤ (sense) and 5‚Ä≤-TTAGGATCCTCACTCCTCCCTCAGCAAGCCAACG-3‚Ä≤ (antisense); and TK0943, 5‚Ä≤-CCCTCTAGAATTCAATAATTTTGTTTAACTTTAAGAAGGAGATATACATATGAGCGCCAAAGAAGAGGCCC-3‚Ä≤ (sense) and 5‚Ä≤-CTTGTCGACTCACTCTTTCTTTTCTGGAGCTTTC-3‚Ä≤ (antisense). The underlined sequences indicate restriction sites for XbaI, BamHI, NdeI, BamHI, EcoRI, and SalI, respectively, and the italic sequences indicate ribosome-binding sequences aimed to promote efficient translation in E. coli. The amplified fragments were subcloned into pUC118 and then digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes. The fragments for the TK1880 and TK0139 genes were individually inserted into pET21a(+) at the corresponding sites, and the fragment for TK0943 was further inserted into each of the resulting plasmids so that the TK0943 gene was properly oriented downstream of the Œ±-subunit gene. The plasmids obtained (pET-scs and pET-acs2) were sequenced to confirm the absence of unintended mutations and used to transform E. coli BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL cells. Gene expression was induced at the mid-exponential growth phase by the addition of 0.1 mm isopropyl Œ≤-d-thiogalactopyranoside, followed by additional incubation for 4 h at 37 ¬∞C. After expression, cells were harvested, suspended in buffer A, and disrupted by sonication. The soluble protein fraction after centrifugation (15,000 √ó g, 15 min) was heat-treated at 80 ¬∞C for 10 min and centrifuged to remove heat-labile proteins from the host. The supernatant was subjected to sequential chromatography using Resource Q, Resource ISO, and Superdex 200 HR 10/30 columns according to the methods described above with a slight modification in the linear gradient for the hydrophobic column (1.8 to 0 m ammonium sulfate in buffer A). The final protein sample was dialyzed against buffer A and subjected to enzyme assay. Enzyme Assays‚ÄîSuccinyl-CoA-forming activity in T. kodakaraensis extracts and in fractions during the purification procedure was measured by the hydroxamate method (26Takeda Y. Suzuki F. Inoue H. Methods Enzymol. 1969; 13: 153-160Crossref Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The reaction was performed in a mixture (500 Œºl) composed of 1 mm CoASH, 5 mm ATP or GTP, 50 mm hydroxylamine, and 2.5 mm MgCl2 in 25 mm Tris succinate buffer at 70 ¬∞C for the appropriate periods of time. After the reaction, 350 Œºl of 20% trichloroacetic acid and 150 Œºl of 1 m FeCl3 were added to the mixture, and formation of the iron¬∑succinohydroxymate complex derived from succinyl-CoA was determined spectrophotometrically at 520 nm. Authentic succinyl-CoA (Sigma) was used as a standard for calibration. A continuous spectrophotometric assay monitoring CoA thioester formation from acids was applied for examination of the substrate specificities and kinetic properties of recombinant SCSTk and ACS IITk (21Br√§sen C. Sch√∂nheit P. Arch. Microbiol. 2004; 182: 277-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture (1000 Œºl) was composed of 10 mm carboxylic acid, 1 mm ATP, 1.5 mm CoA, 5 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, and 1.5 mm NADH in 50 mm MES-NaOH buffer (pH 6.5) together with a mixture of pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase from rabbit muscle (Sigma) as coupling enzymes. The ADP formation accompanied by CoA thioester formation at 55 ¬∞C was continuously monitored as a decrease in the absorbance of NADH at 340 nm. We confirmed that the stability and activity levels of the coupled enzymes were sufficient during the assay at 55 ¬∞C. When measuring activity in the direction of CoA thioester cleavage, the formation of free CoASH was determined using 5,5‚Ä≤-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (13Mai X. Adams M.W.W. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5897-5903Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The reaction was carried out in a mixture (1000 Œºl) containing 0.5 mm CoA thioester (isovaleryl-CoA or succinyl-CoA), 0.1 mm 5,5‚Ä≤-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), 0.4 mm ADP, and 10 mm MgCl2 in 50 mm MES-NaOH buffer (pH 6.5) at 55 ¬∞C, and the increase in absorbance at 412 nm was continuously recorded. Immunoprecipitation‚ÄîProtein A-Sepharose Fast Flow (GE Healthcare) was used as the affinity resin for immunoprecipitation experiments. Five-hundred microliters of rabbit anti-serum (anti-TK0943 or anti-TK0465 serum) containing 1% bovine serum albumin was mixed with 100 Œºl of the resin suspension at 4 ¬∞C for 12 h. Antibody-bound resin was centrifuged, and the supernatant was removed. The pellet was washed five times with 1.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (136.9 mm NaCl, 8.1 mm Na2HPO4¬∑12H2O, 2.68 mm KCl, and 1.47 mm KH2PO4), followed by the addition of 100 Œºl of cell extracts (2 mg/ml protein) of T. kodakaraensis grown in MA-YT-Pyr medium. After incubation at 4 ¬∞C for 1.5 h, the resin was washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and then resuspended in 30 Œºl of the buffer. The suspension was heat-treated at 90 ¬∞C for 30 min and centrifuged to remove heavy and light chains of the antibodies, followed by SDS-PAGE analysis. The protein bands with a molecular mass of ‚àº50 kDa (corresponding to the Œ±-subunits) were sliced out and subjected to MALDI-TOF tandem mass spectrometry analysis at Hitachi High-Technologies Corp. (Hitachinaka, Japan). Identification of an SCS in Cell-free Extracts of T. kodakaraensis‚ÄîWe first examined the presence of SCS activity in T. kodakaraensis. The extract was prepared from cells grown in MA-YT-Pyr medium containing amino acids/peptides and pyruvate without elemental sulfur, and ATP-dependent succinyl-CoA formation from succinate and CoA was measured by the hydroxamate procedure. As a result, we observed 0.18 Œºmol of succinyl-CoA-forming activity/min/mg of total protein in the extract at 70 ¬∞C. The protein responsible for the SCS activity was purified from the cell extracts. The crude extract was subjected to sequential column chromatography, and the enzyme was purified 221-fold based on the ATP-dependent activity (39.4 units/mg) (Table 1). SDS-PAGE analysis of the active fractions after the final purification step showed two major bands with molecular masses of 50 and 27 kDa, respectively (Fig. 1). The elution of a single peak with a molecular mass of ‚àº160 kDa was observed by gel filtration chromatography, which supported a heterotetrameric conformation (Œ±2Œ≤2) of the enzyme composed of 50-kDa (Œ±) and 27-kDa (Œ≤) subunits. It should be noted that a lower GTP-dependent activity was always associated with the ATP-dependent activity through all purification steps, and neither ATP- nor GTP-dependent SCS activity could be detected in other fractions. These facts strongly suggested that a single SCS with broad nucleotide specificity was present in T. kodakaraensis cells. The final preparation displayed a specific activity of 14.3 units/mg in terms of GTP-dependent activity.TABLE 1Purification profile of SCSTkStepProteinTotal activitySpecific activityPurificationmgunitsunits/mg-foldExtract6591170.181.0Resource Q30.81092.8215.7Mono Q5.3535.32.7515.5HiLoad 26/60 Superdex 200 pg3.4333.111.663.1Resource ISO0.58116.430.0168Superdex 200 HR 10/300.29812.039.4221 Open table in a new tab The N-terminal amino acid sequences of the two proteins were determined to be XETPNL (X is an undefined residue) for the 50-kDa protein and SAXEEAL for the 27-kDa protein. A homology search against the T. kodakaraensis genome data base led to the identification of the corresponding genes, TK1880 and TK0943, for the 50- and 27-kDa subunits, respectively. TK1880 encodes a 469-amino acid protein (50.9 kDa) with METPNL as the N-terminal sequence, whereas the TK0943 product is a 243-amino acid protein (27.1 kDa) initiating with the sequence MSAKEEAL. The deduced molecular masses were in good agreement with those of the two proteins purified from T. kodakaraensis cells. SCSTk Belongs to the Acyl-CoA Synthetase (NDP-forming) Superfamily‚ÄîThe deduced amino acid sequence of TK1880 displays high similarity (47% identical) to the Œ±-subunits of the ADP-forming ACSs I and II from the closely related Archaea P. furiosus (PF1540 and PF0532, respectively). In addition, TK0943 displays 55% identity to the Œ≤-subunit of ACS IPf (PF1787) and much higher identity (89%) to that of ACS IIPf (PF1837). The TK1880 and TK0943 proteins also displayed similarity to other members of the NDP-forming acyl-CoA synthetase superfamily, although to a lesser extent. Bacterial and eukaryotic SCSs are the most studied enzymes in this superfamily. The detailed three-dimensional structure of SCS from E. coli (SCSEc), which consists of two small Œ±-subunits (SucD) and two large Œ≤-subunits (SucC), indicates the presence of five (sub)domains in the protein, domains 1-2 provided by the Œ±-subunit and domains 3-4-5 composing the Œ≤-subunit, as shown in Fig. 2 (23Fraser M.E. James M.N.G. Bridger W.A. Wolodko W.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1633-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 27Wolodko W.T. Fraser M.E. James M.N.G. Bridger W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10883-10890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the detailed structure of SCSEc and information provided in the Molecular Modeling Database structure summary (Protein Data Bank code 2SCU), the five domains of SCSEc are designated here as domain 1 (Œ±-subunit residues 1‚Äì122), domain 2 (Œ±-subunit residues 123‚Äì288), domain 3 (Œ≤-subunit residues 19‚Äì102), domain 4 (Œ≤-subunit residues 1‚Äì18 and 103‚Äì229), and domain 5(Œ≤-subunit residues 230‚Äì388). The Œ±-subunit is responsible for binding with the CoA substrate, and the active-site histidine (His246) resides in domain 2. Domains 3-4 of the Œ≤-subunit harbor the ATP-grasp fold, and domain 5 harbors one of the three nucleotide-binding motifs found in the Œ±Œ≤-dimer. It has been pointed out that other members in this superfamily also commonly harbor these five domains, although the order and distribution of the domains between the two subunits display variation (18SaÃÅnchez L.B. Galperin M.Y. MuÃàller M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5794-5803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Although all previously characterized classical SCSs share the same subunit and domain structure (domain order: Œ±-subunit, 1-2; and Œ≤-subunit, 3-4-5) (23Fraser M.E. James M.N.G. Bridger W.A.

Biol. 2000; 299: 1325-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), the SCS identified here from T. kodakaraensis exhibits a distinct structure: domain 5 is fused to the Œ±-subunit (Œ±-subunit, domains 1-2-5; and Œ≤-subunit, domains 3-4) (Fig. 2). The structure is therefore closer to those of the ACSs of Thermococcales (11Sch√§fer T. Sch√∂nheit P. Arch. Microbiol. 1991; 155: 366-377Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 12Sch√§fer T. Selig M.

Chem. 2000; 275: 5794-5803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). It should also be noted that the individual domains of SCSTk exhibit higher similarity to the domains of the Thermococcales and G. lamblia ACSs (>38% identical) than to those of the classical SCSs (<28% identical). These facts explain why functional prediction of TK1880 and TK0943 as SCSs was not possible based on the primary structure in T. kodakaraensis. Overexpression and Purification of Recombinant SCSTk and ACS IITk‚ÄîThe T. kodakaraensis genome harbors four genes (TK0139, TK0665, TK0944, and TK2127) paralogous to the Œ±-subunit of SCSTk (TK1880) and one gene (TK0465) paralogous to the Œ≤-subunit (TK0943). Members of the five- and two-paralog groups are similar in length (440‚Äì474 and 212‚Äì243 amino acids) and display overall similarity (41‚Äì50 and 55% identical) to the other members of the respective groups, indicating that their domain arrangements are common. Equivalent paralogous gene sets are also present on the genomes of P. abyssi (9Cohen G.N. Barbe V. Flament D. Galperin M. Heilig R. Lecompte O. Poch O. Prieur D. QueÃÅrellou J. Ripp R. Thierry J-C. Van der Oost J. Weissenbach J. Zivanovic Y. Forterre P. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 1495-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), P. furiosus (29Robb F.T. Maeder D.L. Brown J.R. DiRuggiero J.

Kikuchi H. DNA Res. 1998; 5: 55-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar), and each member exhibits particularly high identity (>80% at the amino acid levels) to only one member in the other strains (Fig. 3). The larger number of Œ±-subunit genes implies that each Œ≤-subunit may accommodate more than one type of Œ±-subunit. Interestingly, the Œ≤-subunit of SCSTk identified here (TK0943) corresponds to the Œ≤-subunit of ACS IIPf (PF1837), suggesting that SCS and ACS II share the same Œ≤-subunit in these hyperthermophiles. To examine whether TK0943 can act as the Œ≤-subunit for both SCS and an ACS, we expressed the gene together with the TK1880 gene (encoding the SCS Œ±-subunit) or the TK0139 gene (the T. kodakaraensis counterpart of the Œ±-subunit gene of ACS IIPf) in E. coli. Recombinant proteins of TK1880/TK0943 (SCSTk) and TK0139/TK0943 (ACS IITk) were recovered as soluble proteins after heat treatment at 80 ¬∞C for 10 min and subsequently purified. SCSTk and ACS IITk were determined to be Œ±2Œ≤2-heterotetramers by gel filtration chromatography, the same quaternary structures as those reported for native SCSTk and ACS IIPf. The formation of Œ±2Œ≤2-heterotetramers and their high thermostability (see below) strongly suggest that TK0943 can assemble with either TK1880 or TK0139 as the Œ±-subunit. Biochemical Characterization of Recombinant SCSTk and ACS IITk‚ÄîPurified recombinant SCSTk and ACS IITk exhibited ATP-dependent succinyl-CoA- and acetyl-CoA-forming activities at high temperature, respectively. Both enzymes showed the highest activity at pH 6.5, and the optimum temperatures were 75‚Äì80 ¬∞C for SCSTk and 75 ¬∞C for ACS IITk. The enzymes were highly thermostable, with half-lives of 90 min (SCSTk) and 120 min (ACS IITk) at 95 ¬∞C. At 98 ¬∞C, both enzymes showed half-lives of 50 min."
https://openalex.org/W2081642748,"Vibrio vulnificus is a pathogenic bacterium causing primary septicemia, which follows a classical septic shock pathway, including an overwhelming inflammatory cytokine response. In this study, we identified a putative lipoprotein of V. vulnificus, encoded by the ilpA gene, as one of the surface proteins that specifically reacted with the antibodies raised against outer membrane proteins of V. vulnificus. Using a mutant V. vulnificus in which its ilpA gene was knocked out, we found that IlpA is important in the production of interferon-Œ≥ in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Production of tumor necrosis factor-Œ± and interleukin-6 is also induced by the recombinant IlpA (rIlpA) in human monocytes. Lipidation of the rIlpA was observed by in vivo labeling in Escherichia coli. Experiments using the mutant IlpA, which is unable to be modified by lipidation, indicate that the lipid moiety of this protein has an essential property for cytokine production in human cells. Pretreatment of monocytes with antibodies against Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) inhibited production of both tumor necrosis factor-Œ± and interleukin-6. The role of TLR2 in IlpA-induced cytokine production was confirmed by an in vitro assay, in which only the TLR2-expressing cells showed a dramatic induction of nuclear factor-Œ∫B activity by rIlpA. In addition, rIlpA treatment resulted in induction of TLR2 transcription in human cells. In comparison with the wild type V. vulnificus, the ilpA mutant showed a reduced mortality in mice. These results demonstrate that IlpA of V. vulnificus functions as an immunostimulant to human cells via TLR2.

Vibrio vulnificus, a Gram-negative bacterium found commonly in the estuarine environment, has been frequently associated with primary septicemia following the consumption of contaminated shellfish. Over 50% of the primary septicemia patients caused by V. vulnificus died of multiorgan failure as a result of a rapidly progressive shock syndrome (1Blake P.A. Merson M.H. Weaver R.E. Hollis D.G.

Septic shock usually results from the overproduction and dysregulation of host cytokines in response to invading microorganisms. Inflammation-associated cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-Œ± (TNF-Œ±), interferon-Œ≥ (IFN-Œ≥), interleukin-1 (IL-1), and IL-6, play pivotal roles in the host immune response to infection (17Salgado A.

Poole S. Wilson M. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 316-341Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, initial interaction of Neisseria gonorrhoeae with mucosal epithelial cells triggers the release of inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6 and IL-8, which subsequently recruit and activate other immune cells at the site of infection (20Fichorova R.N. Desai P.J. Gibson F.C.R. Genco C.A. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 5840-5848Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 21Harvey H. Post D. Apicella M. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 5808-5815Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Therefore, the involvement of V. vulnificus surface molecules(s) in its interaction with host cells can be postulated, which may be recognized by immune cells and thus trigger cytokine production. The interaction between the surface molecules of V. vulnificus and the immune cells may occur by specific recognition via the receptors on the immune cells. A variety of host cell receptors has been implicated in the recognition of bacteria or their components. One of them is the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family, which plays a central role in innate immune defenses (22Medzhitov R. Preston-Hurlburt P. Janeway C. Nature. 1997; 388: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (4416) Google Scholar, 23Takeuchi O. Akira S. Int. Immunopharmacol. 2001; 1: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). The human TLR family is categorized into at least 10 distinct receptors, which convey information in response to different microbial components resulting in activation of nuclear factor-Œ∫B (NF-Œ∫B), the transcription factor involved in the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules (24Medzhitov R. Nat. Rev. 2001; 1: 135-145Google Scholar). The ligands recognized by each TLR have the conserved molecular patterns shared by a broad range of pathogens. For instance, TLR4 is a principal signal transducer in the recognition of LPS (25Hoshino K. Takeuchi O. Kawai T. Sanjo H. Ogawa T. Takeda Y. Akira S. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3749-3752Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Chow J.C. Young D.W. Golenbock D.T. Christ W.J. Gusovsky F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10689-10692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1612) Google Scholar). TLR2 confers responsiveness to various bacterial compounds, such as bacterial lipoprotein (27Aliprantis A.O. Yang R.B. Mark M.R. Suggett S. Devaux B. Radolf J.D. Klimpel G.R. Godowski P. Zychlinsky A. Science. 1999; 285: 736-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar), lipoarabinomannan (28Means T.K. Wang S. Lien E. Yoshimura A. Golenbock D.T. Fenton M.J. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 3920-3927Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), lipoteichoic acid (29Schwandner R. Dziarski R. Wesche H. Rothe M. Kirschning C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17406-17409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1426) Google Scholar), and peptidoglycan (30Yoshimura A. Lien E. Ingalls R.R. Tuomanen E. Dziarski R. Golenbock D.T. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 1-5Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we isolated an outer membrane protein of V. vulnificus, which is highly immunoreactive, and identified it as a lipoprotein. The lipidated form of this protein stimulates the production of proinflammatory cytokines in human monocytes. In vitro assays further indicate that TLR2 is required for recognition of this V. vulnificus lipoprotein. Cultivation of Bacteria-The strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1. Escherichia coli DH5Œ± and BL21 (DE3) were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) (1% (w/v) tryptone, 0.5% (w/v) yeast extract, 1% (w/v) NaCl, pH 7.5) supplemented with the appropriate antibiotics at 37 ¬∞C. Various strains of V. vulnificus, ATCC29307 (wild type), ilpA knock-out mutant, and ilpA mutant carrying pLAFRilpA were cultured in LBS broth (1% (w/v) tryptone, 0.5% (w/v) yeast extract, 2% (w/v) NaCl, pH 7.5) at 30 ¬∞C with tetracycline (2 Œºg/ml) when needed.TABLE 1Cell lines, bacterial strains, and plasmids used in this studyStrain/plasmidGenotype/sourceRef.Human cell lines HEK-293Hypotriploid human cell line, organ; kidneyATCC 293-hTLR2/CD14HEK 293 cells transfected with the plasmids expressing human TLR2 and human CD14InvivoGen 293-hTLR4/MD2-CD14HEK 293 cells transfected with the plasmids expressing human TLR4 and human MD2/CD14InvivoGenBacterial strains E. coli DH5Œ±supE44 ŒîlacU169 (Œ¶80 lacZ ŒîM15) hsdR17 recA1 endA1 gyrA96 thi-1 relA1Invitrogen BL21 (DE3)E. coli strain B F- dcm ompT hsdS (rB- mB-) galŒª (DE3)Invitrogen SM10Œªpirthi thr leu tonA lacy supE recA::RP4-2-Tc::MuŒªpir, oriT of RP4, conjugational donor; Kmr61Aisen P.

Immun. 2004; 72: 4905-4910Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The resultant polyclonal antibodies specific to OMPs were used for the immunoscreening experiment. The V. vulnificus expression library was constructed by cloning genomic DNA partially digested with Sau3AI into a ŒªZAP¬ÆII vector (Stratagene). Recombinant phage DNA was packaged in vitro using Gigapack Gold as described by the manufacturer (Stratagene). The amplified library (with a titer of 9 √ó 106 plaque-forming units/ml) was screened primarily using a 1:2,000 dilution of rabbit antibodies raised against V. vulnificus OMPs. Plaques distinct from the background level of antibody binding to the filter were further purified by the second and third screenings. Homogeneous plaques expressing the surface antigens were selected and excised to a pBK-CMV phagemid, as instructed by the manufacturer (Stratagene). The identities of the phagemid inserts were verified by automatic sequencing of the double-stranded plasmids. Construction of the ilpA Knock-out Mutant V. vulnificus-An 840-bp region upstream of the ilpA open reading frame (ORF) was amplified from the genomic DNA of V. vulnificus ATCC 29307 using the following two primers: ilpA-upF (5‚Ä≤-GTCCGAGCTCGGCGGAGTGAAGTTTGGC-3‚Ä≤; the underlined sequence denotes a SacI restriction site) and ilpA-upR (5‚Ä≤-GCGAGGATCCAGTAAATCTCCTTATTATTTTGAC-3‚Ä≤; the underlined sequence indicates a BamHI restriction site). The PCR product was then cloned into pBluescript SKII (+) to produce pYS1. A DNA fragment containing 1,010 bp downstream of the ilpA ORF was generated using the primers, ilpA-downF (5‚Ä≤-GGACGGATCCCAAAGGCGGCGTAGTAAAAG-3‚Ä≤; the underlined sequence denotes a BamHI restriction site) and ilpA-downR (5‚Ä≤-CTGGGGTACCGATTGGGCACTTCTCAGCG-3‚Ä≤; the underlined sequence represents a KpnI restriction site). The DNA fragment was cloned into the corresponding sites of pSY1 resulting in pYS2. An approximate 1.85-kb DNA fragment from pYS2, digested with SacI and KpnI, was ligated with a suicide vector pDM4 (31Milton D.L. Norqvist A. Wolf-Watz H. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7235-7244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to generate pYS3. An E. coli SM10 Œªpir strain carrying pYS3 was conjugated with V. vulnificus ATCC29307, and the exconjugants were then selected on a thiosulfate citrate bile sucrose medium supplemented with chloramphenicol. Colonies with characteristics indicating a double homologous recombination event (resistance to 5% sucrose, and sensitivity to chloramphenicol) were further confirmed by PCR using primers ilpA-upF and ilpA-downR, and finally given the name YS101. Complementation of ŒîilpA Mutant with the Intact ilpA Gene-An intact ilpA gene was amplified from the genomic DNA of wild type V. vulnificus ATCC29307 by PCR using the following primer set: ilpA-comF (5‚Ä≤-GGTTGGATCCATTGGTGAGCT-3‚Ä≤; the underlined sequence denotes a BamHI restriction site) and ilpA-comR (5‚Ä≤-TATCAAGCTTCTCTTGGGATCATTTGAAA-3‚Ä≤; the underlined sequence indicates a HindIII restriction site). The amplified ilpA DNA fragment of 1,159 bp was digested with BamHI and HindIII, and then cloned into a broad range host plasmid, pLAFR5 (32Keen N.T. Tamaki S. Kobayashi D. Trollinger D. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 70: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar), resulting in the positioning of ilpA ORF downstream of the lac promoter in pLAFR5. The resultant plasmid, pLAFRilpA, in E. coli SM10 Œªpir was transferred into the ilpA mutant (YS101) by conjugation, and the exconjugants were selected on thiosulfate citrate bile sucrose agar containing tetracycline (2 Œºg/ml). Expression and Purification of Recombinant IlpA Proteins- Two oligonucleotides, lipo-F (5‚Ä≤-CATGCCATGGCTATGAAATTTAGCCTTAAAGG-3‚Ä≤; the underlined sequence denotes an NcoI restriction site) and lipo-R (5‚Ä≤-CCCAAGCTTCCAGCCTTTTACTACGCC-3‚Ä≤; the underlined sequence represents a HindIII restriction site), were used to amplify an 810-bp DNA fragment containing the complete ORF of the ilpA gene from the genomic DNA of V. vulnificus. NcoI and HindIII sites located at both ends of the resultant ilpA DNA were used to clone this DNA into the pET28b expression plasmid (Novagen) to generate the plasmid pETilpA. The recombinant IlpA (rIlpA) protein was overexpressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) carrying pETilpA by adding isopropyl thio-Œ≤-d-galactoside (IPTG; Sigma) at a concentration of 1 mm, and purified using a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity column as directed by the manufacturer (Qiagen). Using primers, mlipo-F (5‚Ä≤-CATGCCATGGATGGGCGAAAAAGCGACTGAC-3‚Ä≤; the underlined sequence denotes an NcoI restriction site) and lipoR, we prepared the truncated ilpA gene, which lacked the 5‚Ä≤-end of DNA fragment (69 bp) containing the consensus sequence for lipidation. The resultant ilpA‚Ä≤ DNA fragment of 741 bp was then used to clone into pET28b as described above. The truncated rIlpA protein was overexpressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) carrying the resultant plasmid, pETmilpA, and purified in the same manner as the intact rIlpA protein. Determination of the Recombinant IlpA Protein Lipidation- In vivo labeling of rIlpA protein with [3H]palmitic acid was performed as described (33Theisen M. Rioux C.R. Potter A.A. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 826-831Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, various E. coli strains, DH5Œ± carrying pET28b, DH5Œ± carrying pETilpA, BL21 (DE3) carrying pET28b, and BL21 (DE3) carrying pETilpA, were grown to the mid-log phase (A600 = 0.6‚Äì0.8), and the incubation was continued for 12 h in the presence of 50 ŒºCi of [3H]palmitic acid (Amersham Biosciences) without or with IPTG. After the labeling was stopped by adding 10% trichloro-acetic acid (w/v), the labeled bacterial cells were resuspended in boiling buffer (2% (w/v) SDS, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0), boiled for 10 min, and then broken by sonication. The bacterial extracts were then phase-partitioned into aqueous and detergent phases with the addition of 5% Triton X-114 at 37 ¬∞C. The pellet fraction was washed three times with radio-immunoprecipitation buffer (1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5% (w/v) deoxycholic acid, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0) before being resuspended in sample buffer for SDS-PAGE. An equal microgram of each fraction was subjected to 10% (w/v) SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was treated with Amplify solution (Amersham Biosciences) and exposed to preflashed Hyperfilm-MP (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 weeks at ‚Äì70 ¬∞C. Western Blot Analysis-Purified rIlpA (100 Œºg) was mixed with 0.5 ml of complete Freund's adjuvant (Sigma), and injected intraperitoneally into a specific pathogen-free rat (CrjBgi: CD[S.D.]IGS, 7-week-old, female). Two additional immunizations were performed with the same amount of rIlpA protein mixed with incomplete Freund's adjuvant (Sigma) at 2 and 4 weeks after the primary immunization. A week after the third immunization, serum was obtained from the immunized rat and used for Western blot analysis. Lysates of various V. vulnificus, wild type ATCC29307, YS101, and YS101 harboring pLAFRilpA, were prepared in a lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 2% (w/v) SDS, 0.1% (w/v) bromphenol blue, and 20% (v/v) glycerol), separated in a 10% (w/v) SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore). The membranes were incubated with IlpA antisera (1:20,000) in a blocking solution (PBS with 5% (w/v) skim milk and 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20), washed three times with PBS containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, and incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rat immunoglobulin G. The immunoreactive bands were visualized by using nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate system (Promega). Preparation of Human Peripheral Mononuclear Cells and Monocytes-Human peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were prepared by density gradient centrifugation using Ficoll (Amersham Biosciences) and resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 Œºg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm l-glutamine. Prepared PBMCs (1 √ó 105 cells) were cultured in 96-well plates. Monocytes (>95%) were isolated by counter-current elutriation from peripheral blood as described previously (34Erik S.C. Harald G. Ronald L.H. Peter J.M. Roland M. Adriana R.M. J. Infect. Dis. 2006; 193: 849-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Certain numbers of monocytes, 1 √ó 105 or 5 √ó 105, were cultivated in 96-well or 24-well flat-bottom microtiter plates, respectively. Cells were cultured with or without V. vulnificus lysates, the rIlpA protein, concanavalin A, or LPS. Measurement of Cytokines-PBMCs and monocytes in 96-well plates (1 √ó 105 cells per well) were coincubated with culture medium, bacterial lysates, or rIlpA protein at the indicated concentration for 18 h. For comparison, cells were also treated with commercially available E. coli LPS (Sigma). Cell-free supernatants were then collected by centrifugation, transferred to new tubes, and stored at ‚Äì70 ¬∞C until analysis. The levels of each cytokine in the supernatants were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (BD Biosciences). Concentration of each cytokine was determined based on the standard curve of the corresponding cytokine, which had been purified and was available commercially (IFN-Œ≥ from BD Biosciences; TNF-Œ± and IL-6 from BIOSOURCE). Blocking Experiments with Polymyxin B or with Anti-TLR2 Antibodies-Monocytes were preincubated for 1 h with medium containing 10 Œºg/ml human TLR2 monoclonal antibodies (BioLegend) or its isotype control IgG (BioLegend). To examine the role of residual LPS in the prepared rIlpA protein fraction on cytokine production by monocytes, polymyxin B (Sigma) was added to the rIlpA at a concentration of 20 Œºg/ml prior to being incubated with the prepared monocytes. Transfection and Luciferase Assay-Using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen), human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK 293) cells (5 √ó 105) were transfected with 1.0 Œºg of pFLAG-TLR2 (35Takashi S. Yutaka K. Koichi K. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 4641-4646Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), 1.0 Œºgof p(IL6Œ∫B)350hu.IL6P-luc+ (36Vanden Berghe W. Plaisance S. Boone E. Bosscher De J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3285-3290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar), and 0.5 Œºg of pCH110 (GE Healthcare) in 24-well plates. As a control, the plasmid pFLAG-CMV (Invitrogen) was transfected instead of pFLAG-TLR2. pFLAG-TLR4 (35Takashi S. Yutaka K. Koichi K. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 4641-4646Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) was used to transfect HEK 293 cells along with p(IL6Œ∫B)350hu.IL6P-luc+ and pCH110. After 24 h, the transfected cells were stimulated with either rIlpA or LPS. After an additional 20-h incubation, the cells were lysed and assayed for luciferase activity using a luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Normalized reporter activity is expressed as the luciferase activities derived from p(IL6Œ∫B)350hu.IL6P-luc+ divided by the activities of Œ≤-galactosidase derived from pCH110 of the same transfected cells. RT-PCR of TLR mRNAs-Using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), total RNAs were isolated from human PBMCs (2 √ó 106) stimulated with either rIlpA or E. coli LPS (Sigma) at the concentration of 1.0 Œºg/ml. As a control, total RNA was also prepared from the same number of PBMCs. In addition, HEK293-hTLR2/CD14 (indicated as 293-hTLR2) and HEK293-hTLR4/MD2-CD14 (indicated as 293-hTLR4) cell lines (Table 1) were treated with either rIlpA or LPS and subjected to RNA preparation. Two micrograms of each RNA were converted into cDNA using the oligo(dT) primer via the action of reverse transcriptase, which was then amplified for 22 cycles using specific sets of primers. Two primers for TLR2, TLR2-F (5‚Ä≤-GCCAAAGCTTTGATTGATTGG-3‚Ä≤) and TLR2-R (5‚Ä≤-TTGAAGTTCTCCAGCTCCTG-3‚Ä≤), were designed on the nucleotide sequences of human TLR2 (GenBank‚Ñ¢ accession number NM003264), whereas TLR4-specific primers, TLR4-F (5‚Ä≤-TGCGGGTTCTACATCAAA-3‚Ä≤) and TLR4-R (5‚Ä≤-CCATCCGAAATTATAAGAAAAGTC-3‚Ä≤), were made based on the nucleotide sequence of human TLR4 (GenBank‚Ñ¢ accession number U88880). Two oligonucleotides derived from the GAPDH sequence (5‚Ä≤-GGTCATCCCTGAGCTGAACG-3‚Ä≤ and 5‚Ä≤-TCCGTTGTCATACCAGGAAAT-3‚Ä≤) were used to amplify the control RNA. Each cycle of the PCR consisted of a denaturation step (94 ¬∞C, 30 s), an annealing step (52 ¬∞C, 30 s), and an elongation step (72 ¬∞C, 30 s). The PCR products were subjected to electrophoresis in a 1.8% agarose gel. LD50 Determination-For determination of LD50, specific pathogen-free, 7-week-old, female ICR mice were used without pretreatment with iron dextran. Cultures of bacterial strains grown overnight in LBS medium were freshly cultivated in the same medium up to an A600 of 0.7, harvested, washed once in PBS, and then resuspended in PBS. One hundred microliters of serial dilutions of the bacterial suspension were then injected intraperitoneally into six mice per dilution group. The numbers of dead mice were determined 24 h after the injection, and the LD50 value was calculated using the equation described previously by Reed and Muench (37Reed L.J. Muench H. Am. J. Hyg. 1938; 27: 493-497Google Scholar). Nucleotide Sequence Accession Number-The nucleotide sequences of the ilpA gene isolated from V. vulnificus ATCC29307 were deposited in the GenBank‚Ñ¢ data base under the accession number of DQ177330. Statistical Analysis-Data are presented as means ¬± S.D. derived from at least three independent experiments. Student's t test (SYSTAT program, SigmaPlot version 9; Systat Software Inc.) was used to evaluate the statistical significance of the results. Isolation of the Immunoreactive Clone from Immunoscreening V. vulnificus OMPs-Approximately 30,000 plaques from the ŒªZAPII-based expression library of V. vulnificus were screened to isolate the clones expressing the proteins reacting with the antibodies against V. vulnificus OMPs. Twelve candidate plaques showing reproducible immune response with anti-OMP serum were isolated, and the insert DNAs in the isolated phages were excised to pBK-CMV phagemids. Among the 12 isolated clones, 3 of them, pEX3, pEX19, and pEX21, had an identical 3.6"

McHugh et al. have brought that goal one step closer by showing that NMDA receptor-dependent synaptic plasticity in the dentate gyrus is necessary for immediate differentiation between environments with similar features. We are rapidly approaching a better understanding of the mechanisms that allow our brains to form distinct representations for similar events or episodes. McHugh et al. have brought that goal one step closer by showing that NMDA receptor-dependent synaptic plasticity in the dentate gyrus is necessary for immediate differentiation between environments with similar features. How does the brain distinguish between memories that are similar, such as this year's birthday compared to last year's? How do you remember that Kristin helped your daughter open presents during her garden party when she became 4, whereas it was Erika who had that job when she turned 5 (Figure 1)? The hippocampus, a key structure involved in the storage of episodic and declarative memories (Tulving and Markowitsch, 1998Tulving E. Markowitsch H.J. Hippocampus. 1998; 8: 198-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar, Squire et al., 2004Squire L.R. Stark C.E. Clark R.E. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 27: 279-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar), may have just the properties required to deal with these challenges. A critical step in the encoding of a new episodic memory is the amplification of the differences between the new representation and representations that already exist in the network, a process termed ‚Äúpattern separation.‚Äù Lesion studies in behaving rodents have suggested that a neuronal pattern-separation mechanism may be located within a subregion of the hippocampal formation, more specifically in the granule cell population of the dentate gyrus (Rolls and Kesner, 2006Rolls E.T. Kesner R.P. Prog. Neurobiol. 2006; 79: 1-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). This interpretation has been supported by studies of place cells in the hippocampus. Place cells signal the animal's location by firing specifically when the animal is in a specific part of the environment (O'Keefe and Dostrovsky, 1971O'Keefe J. Dostrovsky J. Brain Res. 1971; 34: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (3398) Google Scholar). One well-characterized feature of these cells is their tendency to substantially change their firing patterns after only minor changes in the sensory input or the motivational context, a phenomenon referred to as ‚Äúremapping‚Äù (Muller et al., 1991Muller R.U. Kubie J.L. Bostock E.M. Taube J.S. Quirk G.J. Brain and Space. Oxford University Press, Oxford1991: 296-333Google Scholar). Studies of remapping have provided important clues to the neuronal network mechanisms for pattern separation. Two forms of remapping have been identified in the CA3-dentate network of the hippocampus (Leutgeb et al., 2005Leutgeb S. Leutgeb J.K. Barnes C.A. Moser E.I. McNaughton B.L. Moser M.-B. Science. 2005; 309: 619-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, Leutgeb et al., 2007Leutgeb J.K. Leutgeb S. Moser M.-B. Moser E.I. Science. 2007; 315: 961-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). During ‚Äúglobal remapping,‚Äù there is a complete redistribution of both firing locations and firing rates in the cell population. This form of remapping is invariably associated with a shift in the spatial inputs from the entorhinal cortex (Fyhn et al., 2007Fyhn M. Hafting T. Treves A. Moser E.I. Moser M.-B. Nature. 2007; 446: 190-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). During ‚Äúrate remapping,‚Äù only the rates of the active hippocampal cells change while the location of firing is maintained, a process that is thought to result from neurons in the assembly changing their input weights rather then by a change in the recruitment of cells to the currently active ensemble. Recent work has shown that the coactivity patterns of only a small subset of active granule cells in the dentate gyrus are sufficient to immediately distinguish small changes in sensory input during rate remapping in CA3 (Leutgeb et al., 2007Leutgeb J.K.

The fact that there is no detectable change in simultaneous recordings from the medial entorhinal cortex under these circumstances (Fyhn et al., 2007Fyhn M. Hafting T. Treves A. Moser E.I. Moser M.-B. Nature. 2007; 446: 190-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, Leutgeb et al., 2007Leutgeb J.K. Leutgeb S. Moser M.-B. Moser E.I. Science. 2007; 315: 961-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar) raises the possibility that rate-based pattern-separation mechanisms originate in the dentate gyrus. In a recent article in Science, McHugh and colleagues (McHugh et al., 2007McHugh T.J. Jones M.W. Quinn J.J. Balthasar N. Coppari R. Elmquist J.K. Lowell B.B. Fanselow M.S. Wilson M.A. Tonegawa S.

Published online June 7, 2007)https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1140263Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar) have provided the latest insights into understanding the mechanisms of hippocampal pattern separation. Previously, the same group was able to use targeted genetic manipulations to determine the role of synaptic plasticity in the CA3 pyramidal cell population during pattern completion, a process complementary to pattern separation and thought to take place in neural networks when memories are retrieved from a subset of the cues that defined the original event (Nakazawa et al., 2002Nakazawa K. Quirk M.C. Chitwood R.A. Watanabe M. Yeckel M.F. Sun L.D. Kato A. Carr C.A. Johnston D. Wilson M.A. Tonegawa S.

Neuron. 2003; 38: 305-315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). They now use similar techniques one synapse upstream to investigate the mechanisms of pattern separation. Using mice with floxed NRI subunits of the NMDA receptor and crossing them with mice that expressed Cre recombinase selectively in granule cells of the dentate gyrus, the authors were able to generate a mouse line with NMDA receptors abolished specifically in the dentate granule cells. These mutant animals lacked long-term potentiation (LTP) in the perforant-path-to-granule-cell synapses but had intact LTP in other synapses of the hippocampus. McHugh et al. used this mouse line to determine the possible role of the dentate gyrus in neuronal and behavioral pattern separation. The absence of NMDA receptors in the dentate gyrus did not affect the performance of DG-NR1 knockout mice in the Morris water maze or in standard contextual fear conditioning. Both knockout and control mice were also able to distinguish changes in context when freezing was assessed in a second chamber with different sensory cues. However, when the two chambers were made less distinct and the conditioning took place over time, the knockout mice showed a deficit in discriminating the nonconditioned chamber from the chamber that was repeatedly associated with the foot shock. Control animals learned to discriminate between the two contexts after several days of repeated exposure, while the DG-NR1 knockout mice took 10 days longer to acquire the task. The absence of NMDA receptors in the dentate gyrus also disrupted the redistribution of firing rates in downstream CA3 place cells in a rate-remapping paradigm. The activity of hippocampal neurons in both CA1 and CA3 were recorded while mice were allowed to explore two environments that differed in contextual cues, but not location. In control mice, CA3 neurons showed the expected change between the two environments, indicated by a dramatic change in firing rates in the first context compared to the second. There was no change in the place code of the CA3 cells. The rate change was retained the second day. In the DG-NR1 knockout mice, the change in the rate distribution did not emerge on day 1, but was seen with continued training on the second day when it was no longer different from controls. In combination, these results suggest that NMDA receptor-dependent synaptic plasticity in the dentate gyrus is necessary for fast rate coding in CA3 during first-time exposure to environments with similar features. This study represents a significant advance in our understanding of how the dentate gyrus contributes to pattern separation during the encoding of memory in the hippocampus. Theoretical studies have long pointed to a possible role for the dentate gyrus in pattern separation, based, in particular, on the sparse firing of granule cells in this area and the formation of one-to-one detonator synapses between granule cells and CA3 pyramidal cells (Rolls and Treves, 1998Rolls E.T. Treves A. Neural Networks and Brain Function. Oxford University Press, Oxford1998Google Scholar). This prediction has been verified by recent work showing that rate orthogonalization in CA3 is accompanied by pronounced changes in the coactivity pattern of granule cells in the dentate gyrus (Leutgeb et al., 2007Leutgeb J.K. Leutgeb S. Moser M.-B. Moser E.I. Science. 2007; 315: 961-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). Whether these differences are instrumental in decorrelating memory representations further downstream in the hippocampus has not been determined, however. The present work shows that the dentate gyrus is necessary for pattern separation to occur in the CA3 area. Blockade of pattern separation is associated with poor discrimination between memories. The results also reveal that NMDA receptor-dependent plasticity is part of the cellular mechanism for pattern separation. This is interesting because pattern separation can, in principle, emerge merely from the unique connectivity patterns and firing thresholds of dentate granule cells. The results suggest that the formation of distinct memories may involve rewiring already at the level of the perforant-path synapses. The findings reported by McHugh and colleagues raise a number of questions that will guide research in the years to come. We will highlight three of them. First, it is important to determine to what extent the absence of rate change in the knockout mice reflects only a deficit in pattern separation or also an impairment in the encoding of novel information more broadly. Previous work has provided evidence for two independent changes in firing rates in CA3 cells during exploration of distinct novel environments. In addition to the expression of a new rate pattern in the cell population, which is immediate and tied to the reconfiguration of the sensory cues (Leutgeb et al., 2006Leutgeb S. Leutgeb J.K. Moser E.I. Moser M.-B. Hippocampus. 2006; 16: 765-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), the ensemble of active CA3 cells is also changed at a slower time scale, with some cells fading out and others coming in as the animal is exploring the environment (Leutgeb et al., 2004Leutgeb S. Leutgeb J.K. Treves A. Moser M.-B. Moser E.I. Science. 2004; 305: 1295-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). It may take 20‚Äì30 min until a stable CA3 representation is formed in a constant environment. If a rat is placed into the same recording box on separate sequential trials, each lasting only 10 min, the change in firing rates continues on the second trial and sometimes even longer (Leutgeb et al., 2004Leutgeb S. Leutgeb J.K. Treves A. Moser M.-B. Moser E.I. Science. 2004; 305: 1295-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Both the fast and the slow process seem to be impaired in the DG-NR1 knockout mice of McHugh et al. Not only were CA3 representations for different boxes more correlated than in control animals, but the knockout also reduced the rate difference between early and late parts of the first trial, in the same box (their Figure S5). It will be important to determine whether separate network mechanisms are responsible for the impairments in disambiguation and development of CA3 representations in a novel environment. One way to find out would be to test the animals on multiple or extended trials in the same environment. Second, it will be interesting to determine whether the impairments in fast rate remapping and contextual discrimination can be attributed to possible effects of a continued NMDA receptor loss on neurogenesis and maturation of granule cells. Cre-loxP recombination was detected in newly born dentate granule neurons. Coupled with the observation that NR1 RNA was nearly absent by postnatal week 16 in the DG-NR1 knockout mice, we can assume that neurogenesis occurs but that dentate granule neurons born in adult animals lack functional NMDA receptors. This is of particular interest because it has been shown that NMDA receptor function is needed for the survival and integration of newborn granule neurons into the dentate circuit (Tashiro et al., 2006Tashiro A. Sandler V.M. Toni N. Zhao C. Gage F.H. Nature. 2006; 442: 929-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Without the continued integration of new granule neurons, the dentate network in the DG-NR1 knockout mice could be different than the control network. How the potential lack of fully integrated cells would influence the formation of new distinct representations is not known, although the absence of neurogenesis has been shown to influence the behavior of rodents in some, but not all, hippocampal-dependent learning tasks (Leuner et al., 2006Leuner B. Gould E. Shors T.J. Hippocampus. 2006; 16: 216-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). The final and ultimate challenge will be to understand how the dentate-dependent disambiguation processes translate into behavior. What mechanisms exist to rate-orthogonalize CA3 representations over longer periods, and how are such changes accelerated by plastic response patterns in the granule cell population? It is striking that while rate differentiation in place cells was impaired only on the first recording day in the McHugh study, the behavioral impairment was not expressed until after multiple days of continued training. This slow development is quite different from the fast learning normally associated with hippocampal function (Nakazawa et al., 2003Nakazawa K. Sun L.D. Quirk M.C. Rondi-Reig L. Wilson M.A. Tonegawa S. Neuron. 2003; 38: 305-315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, Squire et al., 2004Squire L.R. Stark C.E. Clark R.E. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 27: 279-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar). Yet the impairment of hippocampal circuitry in the McHugh study was very selective, suggesting that NMDA receptor-dependent plasticity in the dentate gyrus is the first step of a longer chain of events that, in the end, leads to impaired discrimination of spatial environments. Discerning the elements of this cascade will be crucial for an ultimate understanding of the relation between neuronal and behavioral pattern separation."
https://openalex.org/W2106564460,"Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a critical cytokine in the immune response whose transcriptional activation is controlled by a proximal promoter region that is highly conserved in mammals and, in particular, primates. Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) upstream of the proximal human TNF promoter have been identified, which are markers of human ancestry.Using a comparative genomics approach we show that certain fixed genetic differences in the TNF promoter serve as markers of primate speciation. We also demonstrate that distinct alleles of most human TNF promoter SNPs are identical to fixed nucleotides in primate TNF promoters. Furthermore, we identify fixed genetic differences within the proximal TNF promoters of Asian apes that do not occur in African ape or human TNF promoters. Strikingly, protein-DNA binding assays and gene reporter assays comparing these Asian ape TNF promoters to African ape and human TNF promoters demonstrate that, unlike the fixed differences that we define that are associated with primate phylogeny, these Asian ape-specific fixed differences impair transcription factor binding at an Sp1 site and decrease TNF transcription induced by bacterial stimulation of macrophages.Here, we have presented the broadest interspecies comparison of a regulatory region of an innate immune response gene to date. We have characterized nucleotide positions in Asian ape TNF promoters that underlie functional changes in cell type- and stimulus-specific activation of the TNF gene. We have also identified ancestral TNF promoter nucleotide states in the primate lineage that correspond to human SNP alleles. These findings may reflect evolution of Asian and African apes under a distinct set of infectious disease pressures involving the innate immune response and TNF."
https://openalex.org/W2119508893,"The role of the paxillin superfamily of adaptor proteins in B cell antigen receptor (BCR) signaling has not been studied previously. We show here that leupaxin (LPXN), a member of this family, was tyrosine-phosphorylated and recruited to the plasma membrane of human BJAB lymphoma cells upon BCR stimulation and that it interacted with Lyn (a critical Src family tyrosine kinase in BCR signaling) in a BCR-induced manner. LPXN contains four leucine-rich sequences termed LD motifs, and serial truncation and specific domain deletion of LPXN indicated that its LD3 domain is involved in the binding of Lyn. Of a total of 11 tyrosine sites in LPXN, we mutated Tyr22, Tyr72, Tyr198, and Tyr257 to phenylalanine and demonstrated that LPXN was phosphorylated by Lyn only at Tyr72 and that this tyrosine site is proximal to the LD3 domain. The overexpression of LPXN in mouse A20 B lymphoma cells led to the suppression of BCR-induced activation of JNK, p38 MAPK, and, to a lesser extent, Akt, but not ERK and NFŒ∫B, suggesting that LPXN can selectively repress BCR signaling. We further show that LPXN suppressed the secretion of interleukin-2 by BCR-activated A20 B cells and that this inhibition was abrogated in the Y72F LPXN mutant, indicating that the phosphorylation of Tyr72 is critical for the biological function of LPXN.

The phosphorylation of the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif then leads to the activation of the tyrosine kinase Syk (6Hutchcroft J.E. Harrison M.L. Geahlen R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8613-8619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Burg D.L. Furlong M.T. Harrison M.L. Geahlen R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28136-28142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which leads in turn to the phosphorylation of various downstream proteins such as BLNK, phospholipase CŒ≥2, and Btk (8Dal Porto J.M.

As a consequence of the activation of these signaling proteins, numerous second messengers and intermediate signal-transducing proteins are activated, and together, they lead to the activation of several key transcription factors that regulate new gene expression in B lymphocytes and that drive unique B cell physiological responses such as proliferation, cytokine secretion, and differentiation either to memory B or antibody-producing plasma cells (9Tsubata T.

Several phosphatases such as the membrane-bound CD45 and intracellular SHP-1 and SHIP-1 are known to dephosphorylate and hence deactivate key signal transduction molecules in the BCR signaling pathway (10Plas D.R. Thomas M.L. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76: 589-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Recent studies also revealed that, in addition to its well established role in BCR signal initiation, Lyn can play a negative role in down-modulating BCR signaling (11Lowell C.A. Mol. Immunol. 2004; 41: 631-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 12Nishizumi H. Horikawa K. Mlinaric-Rascan I. Yamamoto T. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1343-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Indeed, despite showing defects in B cell development, Lyn-deficient mice are also susceptible to autoimmune diseases, and Lyn-deficient B cells are hyper-responsive to BCR ligation (13Chan V.W. Lowell C.A. DeFranco A.L. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 545-553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 14Chan V.W. Meng F. Soriano P. DeFranco A.L. Lowell C.A.

Immunity. 1995; 3: 549-560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Another class of signal transduction molecules known as the adaptor proteins has also been shown to play critical roles in lymphocyte signal transduction. These proteins do not have enzymatic activities but mediate protein-protein and proteinlipid interactions to provide spatiotemporal modulation of BCR signaling (16Kurosaki T. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 354-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Some of these adaptors are positive regulators of signal transduction, and they facilitate the assembly of activating signaling complexes. For example, BLNK has been widely established as an adaptor protein that couples Syk and Btk to activate phospholipase CŒ≥2 upon BCR ligation, and this subsequently triggers downstream calcium fluxes and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate production (17Kabak S. Skaggs B.J. Gold M.R. Affolter M. West K.L. Foster M.S. Siemasko K. Chan A.C. Aebersold R. Clark M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2524-2535Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). On the other hand, other adaptors such as the Csk-binding protein and the Dok family members Dok-1, 2, and 3 are known to play a negative role in immunoreceptor signaling (18Yamasaki S. Saito T. Semin. Immunol. 2004; 16: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Most of these inhibitory adaptors recruit additional inhibitory effectors to the vicinity of positive regulator of signaling to shut down the signal transduction processes, e.g. Csk-binding protein is known to recruit Csk, which inhibits the activation of the Src family tyrosine kinases (19Xu S. Huo J. Tan J.E.-L. Lam K.-P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 8486-8495Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), whereas Dok-3 is known to recruit SHIP, which dephosphorylates activated signaling molecules (20Robson J.D. Davidson D. Veillette A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2332-2343Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 21Ng C.-H. Xu S. Lam K.-P. Blood. 2007; 110: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Given that certain adaptor proteins such as BLNK (22Kurosaki T. Tsukada S. Immunity. 2000; 12: 1-5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Dok-1 (23Yoshida K. Yamashita Y. Miyazato A. Ohya K. Kitanaka A. Ikeda U. Shimada K. Yamanaka T. Ozawa K. Mano H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24945-24952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and Dok-3 (24Lemay S. Davidson D. Latour S. Veillette A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2743-2754Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) have been demonstrated to play key roles in the regulation of BCR signaling, it is conceivable that other adaptor proteins that have not been studied in the context of immunoreceptor signaling may also play a critical role in BCR signal transduction. The paxillin family of adaptor proteins could be one such example. Paxillin and its related family members Hic-5, leupaxin, and PaxB have not been demonstrated to play a role in BCR signaling so far. Paxillin is a focal adhesion adaptor protein that plays an important role in growth factor- and integrin-mediated signaling pathways (25Schaller M.D. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6459-6472Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 26Tumbarello D.A. Brown M.C. Turner C.E. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 114-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Despite its ability to bind Pyk2 and PTP-PEST, which are molecules known to play a role in BCR signaling, a previous report had indicated that paxillin is not tyrosine-phosphorylated in activated B cells (27Davidson D. Veillette A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3414-3426Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Thus, the role of paxillin in BCR signaling remains to be confirmed. Another family member (Hic-5) was reported to be largely absent in lymphocytes (28Zhang J. Zhang L.X. Meltzer P.S. Barrett J.C. Trent J.M. Mol. Carcinog. 2000; 27: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), hence minimizing the possibility of its participation in BCR signaling. On the other hand, leupaxin, which is most homologous to paxillin and detectable as a 45-kDa protein, is preferentially expressed in hematopoietic cells, including B cells (29Lipsky B.P. Beals C.R. Staunton D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11709-11713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Similar to the other paxillin superfamily members, leupaxin contains multiple N-terminal Leu- and Asp-rich sequences (LD domains) and LIM domains (26Tumbarello D.A. Brown M.C. Turner C.E. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 114-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 30Brown M.C. Curtis M.S. Turner C.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 677-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Both LD and LIM domains had been shown to be important for protein-protein interactions, and in addition, LIM domains have also been shown to play a role in the focal adhesion targeting of paxillin superfamily members (31Brown M.C. Turner C.E. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 1315-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Recent works also established a role for leupaxin in the function of osteoclasts (32Gupta A. Lee B.S. Khadeer M.A. Tang Z. Chellaiah M. Abu-Amer Y. Goldknopf J. Hruska K.A. J. Bone Miner.

Res. 2003; 18: 669-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar); and some of these proteins are known to be expressed in B cells. In this study, we examined the possible role of leupaxin in BCR signaling. We found that leupaxin was phosphorylated upon BCR engagement in human BJAB cells. We show that leupaxin bound Lyn via its LD3 domain and that Lyn phosphorylated Tyr72 of leupaxin. In addition, we demonstrate that leupaxin inhibited the JNK and p38 MAPK signaling pathways downstream of BCR signaling and suppressed the production of interleukin-2 (IL-2) by activated mouse A20 B cells and that the inhibition of cytokine secretion by leupaxin required the phosphorylation of Tyr72. Thus, leupaxin plays an inhibitory role in BCR signaling and B cell function. Plasmid Construction‚ÄîThe cDNAs encoding Lyn, paxillin, and Hic-5 were cloned from a murine spleen cDNA library by PCR. FLAG-tagged wild-type leupaxin was generated from the cDNA encoding wild-type leupaxin (provided by Dr. A. Gupta, University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD) (34Sahu S.N. Khadeer M.A. Robertson B.W. NuÃÅnÃÉez S.M. Bai G. Gupta A. Am. J. Physiol. 2007; 292: C581-C590Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). FLAG-tagged leupaxin deletion mutants (ŒîLD1, ŒîLD1‚Äì2, ŒîLD1‚Äì3, ŒîLD1‚Äì4, and ŒîLD3) and tyrosine-to-phenylalanine mutants (Y22F, Y72F, Y198F, and Y257F) were generated by PCR. All wild-type and mutated cDNAs were verified by DNA sequencing (data not shown).

Transfection efficiency was assessed with the pEGFP-N2 vector at 36 h post-transfection by flow cytometry and was determined to be between 30 and 40%.

Cell lysates were homogenized through a 26-gauge needle and centrifuged at 500 √ó g. The supernatant was transferred to polycarbonate tubes and ultracentrifuged at 20,800 √ó g for 1 h at 4 ¬∞C. The supernatant containing the cytosol fraction was recovered, and the pellet containing the plasma membrane fraction was solubilized in 150 mm NaCl, 15 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.2 mm Na3VO4, and protease inhibitors. Antibodies‚ÄîF(ab‚Ä≤)2 fragments of goat anti-mouse IgG and goat anti-human IgM were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Monoclonal antibodies against human leupaxin (283C and 315G) were obtained from Dr. A. Gupta (32Gupta A. Lee B.S. Khadeer M.A. Tang Z. Chellaiah M. Abu-Amer Y. Goldknopf J. Hruska K.A. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2003; 18: 669-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and ICOS Corp. (Bothell, WA). The following commercial antibodies were also used: anti-phospho Akt (Ser473/Thr308), anti-Akt-1, anti-ERK2, anti-IŒ∫BŒ±, anti-JNK1, anti-Lyn, anti-phospho-ERK, anti-p38, and anti-Œ≤-tubulin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.); anti-phospho-stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK)/JNK (Thr183/Tyr185) and anti-phospho-p38 (Thr180/Tyr182) (Cell Signaling Technology); anti-FLAG polyclonal and anti-hemagglutinin (HA) monoclonal (Sigma); horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10; Upstate Biotechnology); and Alexa 546-conjugated goat anti-mouse and Alexa 488-conjugated chicken anti-rabbit (Molecular Probes). Cell Stimulation, Western Blotting, and Immunoprecipitations‚ÄîCells were resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium at 2 √ó 106 cells/200 Œºl and serum-starved at 37 ¬∞C for 1 h prior to stimulation with anti-Ig antibodies. BJAB cells were stimulated with 10 Œºg/ml anti-human IgM F(ab‚Ä≤)2 fragment, and A20 cells with 15 Œºg/ml anti-mouse IgG F(ab‚Ä≤)2 fragment. After stimulation, cells were lysed on ice for 10 min in lysis buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm Na3VO4, and protease inhibitor mixture and sonicated. Cell homogenates were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 ¬∞C, and supernatants were recovered for protein quantification using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Proteins were electrophoresed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride immunoblot membranes (Bio-Rad). The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature and incubated separately with various antibodies recognizing the different molecules studied. Protein bands were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies and the enhanced chemiluminescence ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). For immunoprecipitations, cell lysates were precleared with protein A/G Plus-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) for 1 h at 4 ¬∞C. For immunoprecipitation of endogenous proteins, anti-leupaxin (LPXN) monoclonal antibody 315G or anti-Lyn antibody was coupled overnight to protein A/G Plus-agarose at 4 ¬∞C and washed twice with lysis buffer before overnight incubation with precleared cell lysates at 4 ¬∞C. For other immunoprecipitations, agarose beads were covalently coupled with anti-phosphotyrosine or anti-FLAG antibody and washed twice with lysis buffer before incubation with precleared cell lysates. Beads were then pelleted and washed three times with lysis buffer before boiling in loading buffer (1% SDS, 1% Œ≤-mercaptaethanol, 15% glycerol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue) for 5 min. The released proteins were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Confocal Microscopy‚ÄîBCR-stimulated BJAB cells were washed twice with cold 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed for 20 min on ice with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. After permeabilization at room temperature for 10 min with 0.2% saponin and 0.03 m sucrose in 1% BSA-containing PBS, cells were washed twice before being deposited onto slides. Cells were blocked with 5% normal goat serum in 1% BSA-containing PBS at room temperature for 1 h before overnight incubation with primary antibodies at 4 ¬∞C. The slides were washed three times with 1% BSA in PBS and incubated at room temperature for 1 h with Alexa 546-conjugated goat anti-mouse or Alexa 488-conjugated chicken anti-rabbit antibody to reveal the respective primary antibodies. Slides were washed three times with 1% BSA in PBS, mounted, and viewed under a Radiance 2000 confocal laser scanning microscope (Bio-Rad). Measurement of BCR-triggered IL-2 Production‚Äî105 transfected A20 cells in 200 Œºl of culture medium were stimulated for 24 h at 37 ¬∞C in 96-well plates in the presence or absence of 10 Œºg/ml anti-mouse IgG F(ab‚Ä≤)2 fragment. The resulting production of IL-2 was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using a mouse IL-2 ELISA kit (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. All cytokine secretion assays were performed in triplicate and repeated three times. To measure BCR-induced activation of the IL-2 promoter, A20 cells (10 √ó 106) were transfected with an IL-2 promoter-luciferase plasmid as described previously (36Northrop J.P. Ullman K.S. Crabtree G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2917-2923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were electroporated with 15 Œºg of IL-2 promoter-luciferase plasmid together with 10 Œºg of the indicated plasmids and 1.5 Œºg of pRL-TK (Renilla) plasmid (to standardize for transfection efficiency). After 40 h, 2 √ó 106 cells were stimulated for 6 h with 10 Œºg of IgG F(ab‚Ä≤)2 fragment. Cells were harvested, and cell pellets were solubilized in passive lysis buffer (Promega Corp.) and incubated on a Spiramix roller mixer for 15 min at room temperature. Cell lysate (90 Œºl) was assayed for both firefly and Renilla luciferase activities using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega Corp.), and the relative light units were measured in a TD-20/20 single tube luminometer (Turner BioSystems, Sunnyvale, CA). Luciferase activity was calculated as increments (n-fold) in IgG F(ab‚Ä≤)2 fragment-induced activity over basal activity obtained with unstimulated cells. Leupaxin Is Activated upon BCR Engagement in Human BJAB B Cells‚ÄîIt was shown previously that LPXN is preferentially expressed in hematopoietic cells (29Lipsky B.P. Beals C.R. Staunton D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11709-11713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, the role of LPXN in BCR signaling is not known. We first observed that LPXN is highly expressed in human BJAB B lymphoma cells (Fig. 1A), suggesting that it might have a role in some aspects of B cell physiology. It is known from various studies that the engagement of BCR on B cells with anti-IgM antibodies or antigens leads to the tyrosine phosphorylation and hence activation of several downstream signaling proteins such as the tyrosine kinase Btk and the adaptor protein BLNK (37Mohamed A.J. Nore B.F. Christensson B. Smith C.I. Scand. J. Immunol. 1999; 49: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 38Fu C. Turck C.W. Kurosaki T. Chan A.C. Immunity. 1998; 9: 93-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 39Kurosaki T. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 309-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). LPXN is known to contain 11 tyrosine residues. Therefore, to determine whether LPXN is involved in BCR signaling, we examined whether LPXN is tyrosine-phosphorylated upon the engagement of BCR on BJAB cells. As shown in Fig. 1A, treatment of BJAB cells with 10 Œºg/ml anti-human IgM F(ab‚Ä≤)2 fragment led to the tyrosine phosphorylation of LPXN as shown by immunoprecipitating LPXN and immunoblotting it with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10. The phosphorylation of LPXN occurred as early as 1 min after BCR stimulation of BJAB cells and appeared to peak at the 5- and 15-min time points before returning to the basal level at the 30-min time point. Conversely, immunoprecipitating total cellular phosphotyrosine proteins from BCR-stimulated BJAB cells with antibody 4G10 followed by immunoblotting with anti-LPXN antibody also revealed a similar pattern in which LPXN was highly activated between 5 and 15 min, as LPXN was maximally immunoprecipitated at these time points (Fig. 1B). As a comparison, the tyrosine kinase Lyn (a known component of the BCR signal transduction system) was also shown to be tyrosine-phosphorylated in BCR-activated BJAB cells. However, in contrast to LPXN, the phosphorylation of Lyn seemed to be more prolonged and was extended to 30 min after BCR ligation (Fig. 1B). This might indicate that the activation of LPXN and hence its involvement in BCR signaling could be more transient compared with Lyn. The tyrosine phosphorylation of LPXN also indicated that it could be a target of a protein-tyrosine kinase that was activated downstream of the BCR signaling pathway. Besides the tyrosine phosphorylation of LPXN, we also observed the recruitment of LPXN to the plasma membrane of B cells upon BCR ligation. Several proteins in the BCR signaling pathway, e.g. the adaptor protein BLNK and the tyrosine kinase Btk, are known to locate to the plasma membrane and especially to the lipid raft fraction of B cells following BCR activation (17Kabak S. Skaggs B.J. Gold M.R. Affolter M. West K.L. Foster M.S. Siemasko K. Chan A.C. Aebersold R. Clark M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2524-2535Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Our results also indicated that LPXN was enriched in the membrane faction beginning at 5 min after anti-human IgM F(ab‚Ä≤)2 fragment treatment of BJAB cells (Fig. 1C). LPXN could still be found in the membrane fractions 15 min after BCR ligation and was subsequently sequestered back to the cytoplasm beginning 30 min after activation. This is consistent with the tyrosine phosphorylation profile of LPXN as shown in Fig. 1 (A and B). Lyn, which is known to be constitutively present in the membrane fraction of B cells (40Rajendran L. Simons K. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 1099-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 41Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5131) Google Scholar), was used as a loading control for the membrane fractions, whereas Œ≤-tubulin was used as a control for the cytoplasmic fractions (Fig. 1C). Thus, taken together, the data indicate that LPXN is tyrosine-phosphorylated and recruited to the plasma membrane following BCR cross-linking in B cells, suggesting that LPXN could play a role in BCR signaling. Leupaxin Interacts with Lyn during BCR Signaling‚ÄîPrevious studies indicated that members of the paxillin superfamily of adaptors can interact with members of the Src family of tyrosine kinases, e.g. paxillin was shown to bind Src either directly or via Pyk2 (31Brown M.C. Turner C.E. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 1315-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar), Hic-5 can bind Fyn (42Ishino M. Aoto H. Sasaski H. Suzuki R. Sasaki T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 474: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and LPXN can interact with Src in osteoclasts (34Sahu S.N. Khadeer M.A. Robertson B.W. NuÃÅnÃÉez S.M. Bai G. Gupta A. Am. J. Physiol. 2007; 292: C581-C590Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Because we demonstrated that LPXN was tyrosine-phosphorylated upon BCR cross-linking and it is known that Lyn is the predominant Src family tyrosine kinase found in B cells (43DeFranco A.L. Chan V.W. Lowell C.A. Semin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 299-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), we investigated whether LPXN can physically interact with Lyn. To accomplish this, FLAG-tagged paxillin superfamily members (LPXN, Hic-5, and paxillin) were coexpressed with HA-tagged Lyn in HEK293T cells, and whole cell lysates from the transfectants were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody-agarose beads. The immunoprecipitates were subsequently immunoblotted with anti-Lyn antibody. As shown in Fig. 2A, all three members of the paxillin superfamily interacted with Lyn, with Hic-5 co-immunoprecipitating a larger amount of Lyn, followed by LPXN and finally paxillin. Used as a negative control, the FLAG tag alone did not show any nonspecific interaction with Lyn. As LPXN bound Lyn in overexpression studies in HEK293T cells, we next examined whether endogenous interaction of LPXN and Lyn can occur in B cells upon BCR activation. BJAB cells were treated with 10 Œºg/ml anti-human IgM F(ab‚Ä≤)2 fragment for various time points, and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-LPXN antibody and immunoblotted with anti-Lyn antibody. As shown in Fig. 2B, the interaction between LPXN and Lyn was detected as early as 1 min and seemed to peak between 5 and 15 min after BCR ligation in BJAB cells. The binding of LPXN to Lyn appeared to occur in response to BCR cross-linking, as LPXN and Lyn could no longer be co-immunoprecipitated at the 30-min time point. We were able to show that an equivalent amount of LPXN (used as a control) was immunoprecipitated at all time points examined. Thus, Lyn binding to LPXN appears to be induced by BCR signaling. To visualize the endogenous interaction of LPXN and Lyn, we performed immunofluorescence studies in BJAB cells. LPXN (which stained red) was found to be evenly distributed in the cytoplasm of unstimulated BJAB cells (Fig. 2C, upper panels). Upon ligation of BCR on BJAB cells, LPXN was recruited to the plasma membrane at the 5-min time point and remained there until after 15 min. However, by 30 min, LPXN was sequestered back to the cytoplasm (Fig. 2C, upper panels). This observation was consistent with our membrane fractionation data shown in Fig. 1C. On the other hand, Lyn (which stained green) (Fig. 2C, middle panels) was constitutively present in the membrane fra"

Cell elimination by localized radiation therapy that is timed within 2-3 weeks postinjury can facilitate repair of structure and function in transected rat spinal cord. In pilot studies in contusion spinal cord injury, a model similar to crush/fracture injury in human, we did not observe the expected beneficial effects of radiation therapy. Long forgotten data show that in contusion/crush injury, fluid accumulation from hemorrhage is critical. Alfred Reginald Allen observed that the most devastating sequelae in contusive injury are secondary to fluid accumulation which could be alleviated by surgical intervention, midline slits (myelotomy) at the lesion site.Here, we tested whether release of fluid buildup by microsurgery (partial myelotomy) would affect the structural outcome of radiation therapy in the severely contused rat spinal cord. Surgical intervention alone significantly enhanced tissue and functional preservation in the contused cord, thus confirming Allen's observations. Combining partial myelotomy with radiation therapy that is specifically timed postinjury elicited substantial beneficial therapeutic outcome; it led to significant increase in tissue repair/preservation compared with the group that received surgical intervention only, as determined by histology and in vivo MRI. Altogether, the combined treatments led to a 1.8 fold increase in tissue repair/preservation as compared with the contused group.The data suggest that a clinical protocol could be developed to treat acute human spinal cord injury through conventional clinical procedures, a combination of microsurgical manipulation and radiation therapy. These also suggest it is imperative to first prevent the secondary damage caused by fluid accumulation for a cure to be possible."
https://openalex.org/W1998426027,"Although there is growing evidence that males tend to suffer higher levels of parasitism than females, the implications of this for the population dynamics of the host population are not yet understood. Here we build on an established 'two-sex' model and investigate how increased susceptibility to infection in males affects the dynamics, under different mating systems. We investigate the effect of pathogenic disease at different case mortalities, under both monogamous and polygynous mating systems. If the case mortality is low, then male-biased parasitism appears similar to unbiased parasitism in terms of its effect on the population dynamics. At higher case mortalities, we identified significant differences between male-biased and unbiased parasitism. A host population may therefore be differentially affected by male-biased and unbiased parasitism. The dynamical outcome is likely to depend on a complex interaction between the host's mating system and demography, and the parasite virulence."
https://openalex.org/W2084441543,"Background Action potentials are the classic mechanism by which neurons convey a state of excitation throughout their length, leading, after synaptic transmission, to the activation of other neurons and consequently to network functioning. Using an in vitro integrated model, we found previously that peripheral networks in the autonomic nervous system can organise an unconventional regulatory reflex of the digestive tract motility without action potentials. Methodology/Principal Findings In this report, we used combined neuropharmacological and biochemical approaches to elucidate some steps of the mechanism that conveys excitation along the nerves fibres without action potentials. This mechanism requires the production of ceramide in membrane lipid rafts, which triggers in the cytoplasm an increase in intracellular calcium concentration, followed by activation of a neuronal nitric oxide synthase leading to local production of nitric oxide, and then to guanosine cyclic monophosphate. This sequence of second messengers is activated in cascade from rafts to rafts to ensure conduction of the excitation along the nerve fibres. Conclusions/Significance Our results indicate that second messengers are involved in neuronal conduction of excitation without action potentials. This mechanism represents the first evidence‚Äîto our knowledge‚Äîthat excitation is carried along nerves independently of electrical signals. This unexpected ceramide-based conduction of excitation without action potentials along the autonomic nerve fibres opens up new prospects in our understanding of neuronal functioning."

https://openalex.org/W2062874498,"Loss of function of dimeric glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) represents the most common inborn error of metabolism throughout the world affecting an estimated 400 million people. In Germany, this enzymopathy is very rare.On the basis of G6PD crystal structures, we have analyzed six G6PD variants of German ancestry by three-dimensional modeling. All mutations present in the German population are either close to one of the three G6P or NADP(+) units or to the interface of the two monomers. Two of the three mutated amino acids of G6PD Vancouver are closer to the binding site of NADP(+). The G6PD Aachen mutation is also closer to the second NADP(+) unit. The G6PD Wayne mutation is closer to the G6P binding region. These mutations may affect the binding of G6P and NADP(+) units. Three mutations, i.e. G6PD Munich, G6PD Riverside and G6PD Gastonia, lie closer to the interface of the two monomers. These may also affect the interface of two monomers.None of these G6PD variants share mutations with the common G6PD variants known from the Mediterranean, Near East, or Africa indicating that they have developed independently. The G6PD variants have been compared with mutants from other populations and the implications for survival of G6PD variants from natural selection have been discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2030146704,"High-throughput mutagenesis of the mammalian genome is a powerful means to facilitate analysis of gene function. Gene trapping in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) is the most widely used form of insertional mutagenesis in mammals. However, the rules governing its efficiency are not fully understood, and the effects of vector design on the likelihood of gene-trapping events have not been tested on a genome-wide scale.In this study, we used public gene-trap data to model gene-trap likelihood. Using the association of gene length and gene expression with gene-trap likelihood, we constructed spline-based regression models that characterize which genes are susceptible and which genes are resistant to gene-trapping techniques. We report results for three classes of gene-trap vectors, showing that both length and expression are significant determinants of trap likelihood for all vectors. Using our models, we also quantitatively identified hotspots of gene-trap activity, which represent loci where the high likelihood of vector insertion is controlled by factors other than length and expression. These formalized statistical models describe a high proportion of the variance in the likelihood of a gene being trapped by expression-dependent vectors and a lower, but still significant, proportion of the variance for vectors that are predicted to be independent of endogenous gene expression.The findings of significant expression and length effects reported here further the understanding of the determinants of vector insertion. Results from this analysis can be applied to help identify other important determinants of this important biological phenomenon and could assist planning of large-scale mutagenesis efforts."
https://openalex.org/W2127885442,"Recent studies have reported that T cells can integrate signals between interrupted encounters with Antigen Presenting Cells (APCs) in such a way that the process of signal integration exhibits a form of memory. Here, we carry out a computational study using a simple mathematical model of T cell activation to investigate the ramifications of interrupted T cell-APC contacts on signal integration. We consider several mechanisms of how signal integration at these time scales may be achieved and conclude that feedback control of immediate early gene products (IEGs) appears to be a highly plausible mechanism that allows for effective signal integration and cytokine production from multiple exposures to APCs. Analysis of these computer simulations provides an experimental roadmap involving several testable predictions."

The ability to generate cells lacking nuclei and centrosomes (SPBs) is key to the elucidation of the role of these structures in various cellular processes.Here we describe a genetic method, using the Schizosaccharomyces pombe cdc16-116 mutant, to reliably and efficiently generate fission yeast cells lacking nuclei and SPBs. We use this approach to show that the assembly of microtubules does not require nuclear associated microtubule organizing centers and SPBs. We also show that actomyosin rings can assemble albeit inefficiently in the absence of nuclei and SPBs.We conclude that key cytoskeletal elements can be assembled in the absence of nuclei and SPBs. In addition, the approach we describe, taken together with physical approaches such as centrifugation, should facilitate the investigation of the role of the nucleus and SPBs in the assembly and inheritance of various cellular structures and organelles."
