https://openalex.org/W2000638372,"Cholesterol and sphingolipid-enriched “rafts” have long been proposed as platforms for the sorting of specific membrane components including glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins (GPI-APs), however, their existence and physical properties have been controversial. Here, we investigate the size of lipid-dependent organization of GPI-APs in live cells, using homo and hetero-FRET-based experiments, combined with theoretical modeling. These studies reveal an unexpected organization wherein cell surface GPI-APs are present as monomers and a smaller fraction (20%–40%) as nanoscale (<5 nm) cholesterol-sensitive clusters. These clusters are composed of at most four molecules and accommodate diverse GPI-AP species; crosslinking GPI-APs segregates them from preexisting GPI-AP clusters and prevents endocytosis of the crosslinked species via a GPI-AP-selective pinocytic pathway. In conjunction with an analysis of the statistical distribution of the clusters, these observations suggest a mechanism for functional lipid-dependent clustering of GPI-APs."
https://openalex.org/W2161597083,"With the availability of complete genome sequence for Drosophila melanogaster, one of the next strategic goals for fly researchers is a complete gene knockout collection. The P-element transposon, the workhorse of D. melanogaster molecular genetics, has a pronounced nonrandom insertion spectrum. It has been estimated that 87% saturation of the approximately 13,500-gene complement of D. melanogaster might require generating and analyzing up to 150,000 insertions. We describe specific improvements to the lepidopteran transposon piggyBac and the P element that enabled us to tag and disrupt genes in D. melanogaster more efficiently. We generated over 29,000 inserts resulting in 53% gene saturation and a more diverse collection of phenotypically stronger insertional alleles. We found that piggyBac has distinct global and local gene-tagging behavior from that of P elements. Notably, piggyBac excisions from the germ line are nearly always precise, piggyBac does not share chromosomal hotspots associated with P and piggyBac is more effective at gene disruption because it lacks the P bias for insertion in 5' regulatory sequences."
https://openalex.org/W1980333298,"In fruit fly research, chromosomal deletions are indispensable tools for mapping mutations, characterizing alleles and identifying interacting loci. Most widely used deletions were generated by irradiation or chemical mutagenesis. These methods are labor-intensive, generate random breakpoints and result in unwanted secondary mutations that can confound phenotypic analyses. Most of the existing deletions are large, have molecularly undefined endpoints and are maintained in genetically complex stocks. Furthermore, the existence of haplolethal or haplosterile loci makes the recovery of deletions of certain regions exceedingly difficult by traditional methods, resulting in gaps in coverage. Here we describe two methods that address these problems by providing for the systematic isolation of targeted deletions in the D. melanogaster genome. The first strategy used a P element-based technique to generate deletions that closely flank haploinsufficient genes and minimize undeleted regions. This deletion set has increased overall genomic coverage by 5-7%. The second strategy used FLP recombinase and the large array of FRT-bearing insertions described in the accompanying paper to generate 519 isogenic deletions with molecularly defined endpoints. This second deletion collection provides 56% genome coverage so far. The latter methodology enables the generation of small custom deletions with predictable endpoints throughout the genome and should make their isolation a simple and routine task."
https://openalex.org/W2123550664,"The current perspective of NO biology is formulated predominantly from studies of NO synthesis. The role of S-nitrosothiol (SNO) formation and turnover in governing NO-related bioactivity remains uncertain. We generated mice with a targeted gene deletion of S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR), and show that they exhibit substantial increases in whole-cell S-nitrosylation, tissue damage, and mortality following endotoxic or bacterial challenge. Further, GSNOR(-/-) mice have increased basal levels of SNOs in red blood cells and are hypotensive under anesthesia. Thus, SNOs regulate innate immune and vascular function, and are cleared actively to ameliorate nitrosative stress. Nitrosylation of cysteine thiols is a critical mechanism of NO function in both health and disease."
https://openalex.org/W2113952988,"Iron, insoluble as free Fe(3+) and toxic as free Fe(2+), is distributed through the body as Fe(3+) bound to transferrin (Tf) for delivery to cells by endocytosis of its complex with transferrin receptor (TfR). Although much is understood of the transferrin endocytotic cycle, little has been uncovered of the molecular details underlying the formation of the receptor-transferrin complex. Using cryo-electron microscopy, we have produced a density map of the TfR-Tf complex at subnanometer resolution. An atomic model, obtained by fitting crystal structures of diferric Tf and the receptor ectodomain into the map, shows that the Tf N-lobe is sandwiched between the membrane and the TfR ectodomain and that the C-lobe abuts the receptor helical domain. When Tf binds receptor, its N-lobe moves by about 9 A with respect to its C-lobe. The structure of TfR-Tf complex helps account for known differences in the iron-release properties of free and receptor bound Tf."
https://openalex.org/W2100516702,"The primary cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a newly discovered coronavirus. Replication of this SARS coronavirus (SCV) occurs mainly in the lower respiratory tract, and causes diffuse alveolar damage. Lack of understanding of the pathogenesis of SARS has prevented the rational development of a therapy against this disease. Here we show extensive SCV antigen expression in type 1 pneumocytes of experimentally infected cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) at 4 d postinfection (d.p.i.), indicating that this cell type is the primary target for SCV infection early in the disease, and explaining the subsequent pulmonary damage. We also show that prophylactic treatment of SCV-infected macaques with the antiviral agent pegylated interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) significantly reduces viral replication and excretion, viral antigen expression by type 1 pneumocytes and pulmonary damage, compared with untreated macaques. Postexposure treatment with pegylated IFN-alpha yielded intermediate results. We therefore suggest that pegylated IFN-alpha protects type 1 pneumocytes from SCV infection, and should be considered a candidate drug for SARS therapy."

https://openalex.org/W2031248158,"Distal hereditary motor neuropathy (dHMN) or distal spinal muscular atrophy (OMIM #182960) is a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by an almost exclusive degeneration of motor nerve fibers, predominantly in the distal part of the limbs. Silver syndrome (OMIM #270685) is a rare form of hereditary spastic paraparesis mapped to chromosome 11q12-q14 (SPG17) in which spasticity of the legs is accompanied by amyotrophy of the hands and occasionally also the lower limbs. Silver syndrome and most forms of dHMN are autosomal dominantly inherited with incomplete penetrance and a broad variability in clinical expression. A genome-wide scan in an Austrian family with dHMN-V (ref. 4) showed linkage to the locus SPG17, which was confirmed in 16 additional families with a phenotype characteristic of dHMN or Silver syndrome. After refining the critical region to 1 Mb, we sequenced the gene Berardinelli-Seip congenital lipodystrophy (BSCL2) and identified two heterozygous missense mutations resulting in the amino acid substitutions N88S and S90L. Null mutations in BSCL2, which encodes the protein seipin, were previously shown to be associated with autosomal recessive Berardinelli-Seip congenital lipodystrophy (OMIM #269700). We show that seipin is an integral membrane protein of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The amino acid substitutions N88S and S90L affect glycosylation of seipin and result in aggregate formation leading to neurodegeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2070697563,"The pituitary develops from the interaction of the infundibulum, a region of the ventral diencephalon, and Rathke's pouch, a derivative of oral ectoderm. Postnatally, its secretory functions are controlled by hypothalamic neurons, which also derive from the ventral diencephalon. In humans, mutations affecting the X-linked transcription factor SOX3 are associated with hypopituitarism and mental retardation, but nothing is known of their etiology. We find that deletion of Sox3 in mice leads to defects of pituitary function and of specific central nervous system (CNS) midline structures. Cells in the ventral diencephalon, where Sox3 is usually highly expressed, have altered properties in mutant embryos, leading to abnormal development of Rathke's pouch, which does not express the gene. Pituitary and hypothalamic defects persist postnatally, and SOX3 may also function in a subset of hypothalamic neurons. This study shows how sensitive the pituitary is to subtle developmental defects and how one gene can act at several levels in the hypothalamic-pituitary axis."
https://openalex.org/W2067155896,"Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a polyglutamine (polyQ) tract expansion near the N terminus of huntingtin (Htt). Proteolytic processing of mutant Htt and abnormal calcium signaling may play a critical role in disease progression and pathogenesis. Recent work indicates that calpains may participate in the increased and/or altered patterns of Htt proteolysis leading to the selective toxicity observed in HD striatum. Here, we identify two calpain cleavage sites in Htt and show that mutation of these sites renders the polyQ expanded Htt less susceptible to proteolysis and aggregation, resulting in decreased toxicity in an in vitro cell culture model. In addition, we found that calpain- and caspase-derived Htt fragments preferentially accumulate in the nucleus without the requirement of further cleavage into smaller fragments. Calpain family members, calpain-1, -5, -7, and -10, have increased levels or are activated in HD tissue culture and transgenic mouse models, suggesting they may play a key role in Htt proteolysis and disease pathology. Interestingly, calpain-1, -5, -7, and -10 localize to the cytoplasm and the nucleus, whereas the activated forms of calpain-7 and -10 are found only in the nucleus. These results support the role of calpain-derived Htt fragmentation in HD and suggest that aberrant activation of calpains may play a role in HD pathogenesis.

The selective neurodegeneration found in HD may be linked to the expression of particular receptors and proteases in the affected striatal and cortical cells, but the molecular details of these events are not well characterized. One hypothesis that has received a great deal of attention is that production of N-terminal Htt fragments plays a key role in disease pathogenesis (7Mangiarini L. Sathasivam K. Seller M. Cozens B.

Our recent studies have shown that calpain cleaves Htt at multiple sites to produce small N-terminal fragments (11Gafni J. Ellerby L.M. J.

In addition, we have demonstrated that the active form of calpain is substantially increased in the caudate of HD patients suggesting that calpain-derived Htt fragments may contribute to the etiology of HD (11Gafni J.

Recently, new insights have been gained as to how polyQ-expanded Htt may alter Ca2+ homeostasis at early stages of the disease, and these findings may be directly linked to excitotoxicity and the activation of the Ca2+-dependent proteases, the calpains (12Zeron M.M.

N-Methyl-d-aspartate receptor, subtype 2B, and metabotropic glutamate receptors class 1/5 are enriched in the striatum and play a role in the dysregulation of Ca2+ in HD.

This is not surprising, because Htt was the first caspase substrate identified in a neurodegenerative disease, and the mechanism of action of the caspase family members has been studied extensively in the apoptotic cell death process (9Goldberg Y.P.

Calpains were discovered over 40 years ago, and at least 15 distinct human family calpain members have been identified (24Glading A. Lauffenburger D.A. Wells A.

The first calpains discovered, μ- and m-calpain (calpain-1, calpain-2, and calpain-4 (small regulatory subunit)), have been extensively studied and are distinguished by their differences in Ca2+ dependence, with μ-calpain requiring micromolar Ca2+ for activation whereas m-calpain requires millimolar levels (27Yoshimura N.

Autoproteolysis following Ca2+ addition converts the catalytic subunit of μ-calpain from a 80-kDa protein to a 76-kDa protein, whereas activation of the m-calpain catalytic subunit results in 20 amino acids being removed from the 80-kDa protein N terminus. The regulatory subunit is common to both calpains and requires sequential cleavage events to convert it from the inactive 28-kDa precursor into the active 21-kDa form upon Ca2+ addition. Calpains are activated by many apoptotic and necrotic stimuli, particularly those that alter Ca2+ levels in the cell and their activation often lies upstream of caspase activation (31Shields D.C.

Calpain-10 was found to be partially localized to the nucleus, and nuclear localization was enhanced upon ionomycin treatment (41Ma H. Fukiage C. Kim Y.H. Duncan M.K. Reed N.A. Shih M. Azuma M.

As part of our ongoing efforts to understand the proteolytic cleavage events in HD, we investigated the role calpain cleavage plays in polyQ-expanded Htt cellular toxicity and evaluated whether any of the calpain family members are expressed or activated during altered Ca2+ homeostasis in HD cell culture and transgenic mouse models. We found that calpains cleave Htt at amino acids 469 and 536. The sites of cleavage are clustered between amino acids 437–537, an area that overlaps with caspase cleavage sites in Htt (amino acids 513–586). Reduced cellular toxicity and Htt aggregation were observed when the calpain-resistant form of Htt was expressed in a cell culture model with altered Ca2+ homeostasis. The calpain/caspase-derived Htt fragments were found to preferentially accumulate in the nuclear compartment without the requirement of further proteolysis. Finally, we found calpain family members calpain-1, -5, -7, and -10 levels are increased and/or activated in HD tissue culture and transgenic mouse models. Plasmids and Mutagenesis—Htt expression constructs used in these studies included the wild-type and caspase-resistant (D513A, D530A, D552A, D586A, and D589A) forms of the normal and polyQ-expanded N-terminal Htt fragment ((Htt15Q-(1–1212) and Htt138Q-(1–1212)), which have been described previously (9Goldberg Y.P.

Site-directed deletion mutagenesis was used to identify and evaluate calpain cleavage of Htt. Amino acids 468–470 and 535–537 were deleted individually, as well as sequentially in the wild-type and caspase-resistant (D513A, D530A, D552A, D586A, and D589A) forms of the normal and polyQ-expanded N-terminal Htt fragments ((Htt15Q-(1–1212) and Htt138Q-(1–1212)) to produce calpain-resistant and calpain/caspase-resistant constructs. In addition, amino acid sequences 464–466 or 539–541 were each deleted in the normal Htt15Q-(1–1212) fragment as negative controls. Potential calpain cleavage sites were deleted by polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis using the following primers: Δ468–470, F 5′-GGATGTCAGCAGCTCTGCCTCAGTGAAGGATGAGATCAG-3′, R 5′-CTGATCTCATCCTTCACTGAGGCAGAGCTGCTGACATCC-3′; Δ535–537, F 5′-GGAGGATATCTTGAGCCACCAGGTCAGCGCCGTCCC-3′, R 5′-GGGACGGCGCTGACCTGGTGGCTCAAGATATCCTCC-3′; Δ464–466, F 5′-CTGAATCGAGATCGGATGTCGCCTTAACAGCCTCAGTG-3′, R 5′-CACTGAGGCTGTTAAGGCGACATCCGATCTCGATTCAG-3′; Δ539–541, F 5′-GCCACAGCTCCAGCCAGGTCCCATCTGACCCTGCC-3′, R 5′-GCCAGGGTCAGATGGGACCTGGCTGGAGCTGTGGC-3′.

Plasmids were DpnI (Stratagene)-treated, transformed into XL1-Blue Supercompetent Cells (Stratagene), and purified using the Qiagen Plasmid Mini kit. Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Successful identification of calpain cleavage sites was verified using calpain cleavage of in vitro translated proteins as previously described as well as analysis of Htt cleavage products in transfected 293T cells (11Gafni J.

Monoclonal β-tubulin T-4026 (1: 500, Sigma) and polyclonal poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP, 1:3000, BIOMOL) antibodies were used to verify quality of fractionation. Immunoblots were developed with a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and enhanced chemiluminescence. Toxicity Measurements—Caspase activity was measured using the ApoAlert Caspase-3 Fluorescent Assay Kit (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Briefly, cells were lysed in Clontech cell lysis buffer for 10 min on ice. Following centrifugation to remove cell debris, lysate was added to reaction mixture containing 20 mm Pipes, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Chaps, 10% sucrose, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 μm DEVD-7-amino-4-trifluoromethyl coumarin. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C and read at an excitation of 400 nm and an emission of 505 nm for a 1-h period. The rate of change in fluorescence within the linear range was normalized to protein levels to determine relative DEVD-ase activity. Protein levels were determined using the BCA assay (Pierce) for all experiments. Immunofluorescence—Transfected 293T cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 20 min. Following blocking with 10% normal donkey serum, cells were incubated with monoclonal Htt 2166 (7 μg/ml, Chemicon) or polyclonal neoHtt 552 (0.1 μg/ml, Research Genetics) overnight at 4 °C followed by donkey anti-mouse IgG Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody (6 μg/ml, Vector) or donkey anti-rabbit IgG Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody (6 μg/ml, Vector). 4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole was used as a nuclear counter-stain (Vector). Semi-quantitative RT-PCR for Calpain cDNAs—RNA from transfected 293Tcells were extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Oligo(dT)-primed cDNA was generated using a Superscript cDNA kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cDNA mixture was then diluted in water to a volume of 100 μl. cDNAs were amplified in a semi-quantitative PCR (45Allen R.D. Staley T.A. Sidman C.L. Eur. J.

Amplification parameters were 30 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 60 °C for 30 s, and extension at 68 °C for 1 min. PCR products were analyzed on 1% agarose gels. Immunoprecipitation—Cortical tissue from HD 150 knock-in mice were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% deoxycholic acid sodium salt, 1% Nonidet P-40, protease inhibitor (Complete Mini, Roche Applied Science)), sheered with a 26-gauge needle and clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 20 min (4 °C). Protein determination was carried out with the BCA method (Bio-Rad). Each lysate (500 μg) was diluted into 1 ml of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, protease inhibitor (Complete Mini, Roche Applied Science)). Htt was pulled down with monoclonal BKP1 antibody (5 μg) for 18 h at 4 °C. Protein G beads (Amersham Biosciences) were incubated for 1 h with lysates, and then the beads were washed five times with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. Protein was eluted with LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen) and resolved using 4–12% Bis-Tris precast gels (Invitrogen). Western blotting was performed, and blots were probed with 1C2 antibody. Blots were also probed with monoclonal β-tubulin antibody to ensure equal loading of samples. Identification of Two Calpain Cleavage Sites in Htt—We have previously shown that calpains cleave Htt to produce three N-terminal cleavage products (11Gafni J. Ellerby L.M. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4842-4849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In those studies, we found that incubation of in vitro translated pRcCMV-Htt15Q-(1–1212) with calpain-1 (μ-calpain) or -2 (m-calpain) produced 62-, 67-, and 72-kDa N-terminal products, two of which (67- and 72-kDa fragments) are in close proximity to the caspase-sensitive region of Htt (70–80 kDa, Fig. 1A). Both in cell culture and in vitro translation experiments, the major Htt calpain cleavage product appears at 72/82 kDa (15Q versus 138Q) and lies between the caspase-3 sites at amino acids 513 and 552 (Fig. 1, A and B). The exact site of cleavage in Htt and whether calpain cleavage modulates cellular toxicity of the polyQ-expanded form of Htt were not evaluated in our previous work (11Gafni J. Ellerby L.M. J.

https://openalex.org/W2014082672,"The posttranscriptional mechanisms that control the cycling of circadian clock protein levels are not known. Here we demonstrate a role for protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) in the cyclic expression of the PER protein. PP2A regulatory subunits TWS and WDB target PER and stabilize it in S2 cells. In adult fly heads, expression of tws cycles robustly under control of the circadian clock. Hypomorphic tws mutants show delayed accumulation of PER, while overexpression of tws in clock neurons produces shorter, weaker rhythms. Reduction of PP2A activity reduces PER expression in central clock neurons and results in long periods and arrhythmia. In addition, overexpression of the PP2A catalytic subunit results in loss of behavioral rhythms and constitutive nuclear expression of PER. PP2A also affects PER phosphorylation in vitro and in vivo. We propose that the posttranslational mechanisms that drive cycling of PER require the rhythmic expression of PP2A."

https://openalex.org/W2053428839,"We sought to elucidate the role of AKT in follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)-mediated granulosa cell (GC) differentiation. Our results define a signaling pathway in GCs whereby the inactivating phosphorylation of tuberin downstream of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase/AKT activity leads to Rheb (Ras homolog enriched in brain) and subsequent mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) activation. mTOR then stimulates translation by phosphorylating p70 S6 kinase and, consequently, the 40 S ribosomal protein S6. Activation of this pathway is required for FSH-mediated induction of several follicular differentiation markers, including luteinizing-hormone receptor (LHR), inhibin-α, microtubule-associated protein 2D, and the PKA type IIβ regulatory subunit. FSH also promotes activation of the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1). FSH-stimulated HIF-1 activity is inhibited by the PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002, the Rheb inhibitor FTI-277 (farnesyltransferase inhibitor-277), and the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. Finally, we find that the FSH-mediated up-regulation of reporter activities for LHR, inhibin-α, and vascular endothelial growth factor is dependent upon HIF-1 activity, because a dominant negative form of HIF-1α interferes with the up-regulation of these genes. These results show that FSH enhances HIF-1 activity downstream of the PI 3-kinase/AKT/Rheb/mTOR pathway in GCs and that HIF-1 activity is necessary for FSH to induce multiple follicular differentiation markers.

The importance of AKT activation by PI 3-kinase is further demonstrated in recent studies showing that constitutively active AKT synergizes with FSH to up-regulate follicular differentiation markers such as 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/isomerase, LHR, inhibin-α, and aromatase cytochrome P-450, whereas the addition of a dominant negative AKT inhibits their up-regulation (22Zeleznik A.J.

These data indicate that signaling downstream of AKT is crucial for the up-regulation of GC differentiation markers. In light of the evidence that the PI 3-kinase/AKT signaling pathway is necessary for the process of follicular maturation, we explored signaling events downstream of AKT to ascertain their contribution to the transcriptional up-regulation of follicular differentiation markers. Our results show that FSH-stimulation of PI 3-kinase/AKT activity culminates in the activation of signaling proteins that control mRNA translation, including mTOR, p70 S6 kinase (p70S6k), and the S6 ribosomal protein (Fig. 1). We also show that this mTOR-mediated pathway is required for FSH to induce MAP2D, RIIβ, LHR, and inhibin-α. Finally, we identify one target protein, hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), whose translation can be enhanced by growth factors or hormones (23Fukuda R. Hirota K. Fan F. Jung Y.D. Ellis L.M.

Although hypoxia stabilizes the HIF-1α protein by preventing its degradation, certain growth factors have been shown to enhance HIF-1 activity under normoxic conditions by increasing HIF-1α translation (23Fukuda R.

Pregnant Mare Serum Gonadotropin (PMSG) Treatment and Tissue Extract Preparation—Immature female rats (26–27 days old) were injected subcutaneously with 25 IU of PMSG. Ovaries were harvested at the indicated times post PMSG injection and subjected to tissue extract preparations. Ovarian extracts were prepared as described previously (34Maizels E.T. Mukherjee A.

The samples were prepared for SDS-PAGE by suspension in SDS-containing sample buffer followed by heat denaturation (100 °C, 5 min). Western blotting was performed as described below. Granulosa Cell Culture and Western Blotting—GCs were isolated from ovaries of 26-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats primed with subcutaneous injections of 1.5 mg of estradiol-17β on days 23–25 to promote the growth of pre-antral follicles. Cells were plated on fibronectin-coated (BD Biosciences) 33-mm plastic dishes at a density of ∼3 × 106 cells/dish in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/F12 serum-free medium supplemented with 1 nm estradiol-17β, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and treated with the indicated additions ∼20 h after plating (5Salvador L.M.

Protein concentrations were controlled by plating identical cell numbers per plate in each experiment and then loading equal volumes of total cell extract per gel lane. Equal protein loading was confirmed by AKT, mTOR, or CREB Western blots, as indicated. Granulosa cell proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to Hybond C-extra nitrocellulose (Amersham Biosciences) (5Salvador L.M. Park Y. Cottom J. Maizels E.T. Jones J.C. Schillace R.V.

Blots were incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C, and antigen-antibody complexes were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Western signals were quantitated with Molecular Analyst™/PC Image Analysis software program, divided by the densitometric signal for control protein load, and expressed relative to the maximal signal. Transfection and Luciferase Assays—GCs were plated in 12-well plates at 3 × 105 cells/well in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/F12 medium, 1 nm estradiol-17β, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were washed with PBS and transfected with various promoter-luciferase constructs (0.5 μg DNA/well) and the indicated expression constructs (0.05 μg of DNA per well) using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) as described previously (37Duan W.R. Ito M. Park Y. Maizels E.T. Hunzicker-Dunn M. Jameson J.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated with the transfection mixture at 37 °C for 4–5 h, after which Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/F12 serum-free medium supplemented with 1 nm estradiol-17β, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin was added to the cells. Approximately 20 h after transfection, cells were treated as indicated. Cells were lysed and analyzed for luciferase activity using a luminometer as described previously (37Duan W.R. Ito M. Park Y. Maizels E.T. Hunzicker-Dunn M. Jameson J.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Luciferase activity for each measurement was normalized to protein content using 280-nm absorbance measurements (38Stoscheck C.M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 50-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar). Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. of triplicate samples. All transfection experiments were repeated three times with similar results unless otherwise indicated. Results were analyzed using Student's t test (p < 0.05 denoted by **) (39Kramer A.

The percentage of inhibition in the presence of various inhibitors was calculated as (1–(fold induction FSH + inhibitor/fold induction FSH)) × 100. FSH Stimulates Activation of AKT, Inactivation of Tuberin, and Activation of p70S6k and S6 Ribosomal Protein—AKT kinase activation requires the sequential phosphorylation of Thr-308 by phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 and Ser-473 by an unidentified kinase (40Scheid M.P. Woodgett J.R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 760-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). It has been previously established that FSH stimulation of rat ovarian GCs leads to the activation of AKT phosphorylation (6Cottom J. Salvador L.M. Maizels E.T. Reierstad S. Park Y. Carr D.W. Davare M.A. Hell J.W. Palmer S.S. Dent P. Kawakatsu H. Ogata M. Hunzicker-Dunn M. J. Biol.

Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1283-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). We confirmed that AKT is activated in GCs under our culture conditions in response to FSH using an antibody specific for AKT phosphorylated at Ser-473. As shown in Fig. 2A, AKT phosphorylation was readily detected at 10 min post FSH treatment of GCs, had further increased by 1 h, and had subsided to undetectable levels by 4 h post FSH treatment. Total AKT is shown as a protein loading control. Tuberin, a component of the tuberous sclerosis complex, has been identified in various cellular models as a target of AKT kinase (41Manning B.D.

Chem. 2003; 278: 37288-37296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In its active, unphosphorylated state, tuberin prevents signaling of the downstream kinase mammalian target of rapamycin, mTOR (43Tee A.R. Fingar D.C. Manning B.D. Kwiatkowski D.J. Cantley L.C. Blenis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13571-13576Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). AKT phosphorylation of tuberin at Thr-1462 inhibits its activity, thus preventing it from impeding mTOR signaling (44Inoki K. Li Y. Zhu T. Wu J. Guan K.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 648-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (2421) Google Scholar). We therefore determined whether FSH stimulated the phosphorylation of tuberin in GCs. Using a Thr(P)-1462-specific anti-tuberin antibody, our results demonstrate that FSH treatment of GCs promoted phosphorylation of tuberin by 10 min, which was further increased at 1 h post FSH treatment and waned moderately by 4 and 8 h, but not, however, to the extent observed with AKT phosphorylation (Fig. 2A). Because FSH promotes the phosphorylation of tuberin and thus the expected activation of mTOR, we explored whether previously identified targets of mTOR kinase activity, namely p70S6k (45Brown E.J. Beal P.E. Keith C.T. Chen J. Shin T.B. Schreiber S.L. Nature. 1995; 377: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar) and 4E-binding protein-1 (4EBP-1) (46Hara K. Yonezawa K. Weng Q.P. Kozlowski M.T. Belham C. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14484-14494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar, 47Schalm S.S. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 632-639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar) were phosphorylated in GCs in response to FSH. Phosphorylation of p70S6k at Thr-389 downstream of mTOR activity is indicative of p70S6k activation (48Weng Q.P. Kozlowski M. Belham C. Zhang A. Comb M.J. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16621-16629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 49Burnett P.E. Barrow R.K. Cohen N.A. Snyder S.H. Sabatini D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1432-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). When active, p70S6k phosphorylates the S6 ribosomal protein. S6 is a component of the 40 S ribosome that promotes the translation of a subset of mRNAs containing a 5′-oligopyrimidine tract (50Dufner A. Thomas G. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 100-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). Furthermore, inhibitory phosphorylation of 4EBP-1 at multiple sites downstream of mTOR, including Ser-65 (51Schalm S.S. Fingar D.C. Sabatini D.M. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 797-806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar), prevents 4EBP-1 from sequestering the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E, which promotes cap-dependent translation (52Scheper G.C. Proud C.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 5350-5359Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Thus, phosphorylation of both p70S6k and 4EBP-1 leads to the activation of the translational machinery. Western blotting with an antibody recognizing phosphorylated p70S6k (Thr(P)-389) demonstrated that FSH treatment of GCs resulted in p70S6k phosphorylation that was maximal at 1 h and remained elevated 4 h post FSH treatment (Fig. 2A). The phosphorylation of S6 by p70S6k in GCs treated with FSH was monitored with a Ser(P)-235/Ser(P)-236-specific anti-S6 antibody. S6 phosphorylation was observed at 10 min, elevated by 1 h, and remained detectable at 4 h after FSH treatment (Fig 2A). Additionally, the inhibitory phosphorylation of 4EBP-1 at Ser-65 was detected by 1 h and increased by 2 h post FSH treatment (Fig. 2B). Taken together, these data demonstrate that FSH stimulation of GCs leads to the inactivating phosphorylation of tuberin, an inhibitor of mTOR, as well as to the phosphorylation of p70S6k, S6, and 4EBP-1, previously characterized targets downstream of mTOR kinase activity. These results suggest that FSH stimulates the translational machinery in GCs by activating S6 ribosomal protein and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E. FSHR-dependent Phosphorylation of AKT, Tuberin, p70S6k, and S6 Occurs via cAMP-mediated Stimulation of PI 3-Kinase Activity—FSH signals to activate Gs and, consequently, adenylyl cyclase, promoting the synthesis of cAMP (3Hillier S.G. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2001; 179: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). In the following experiments, we investigated whether FSH-dependent signaling to AKT, tuberin, p70S6k, and S6 could be mimicked by the direct pharmacological adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin or the cell permeable cAMP analogue, 8-chlorophenylthio (8-CPT)-cAMP. The results demonstrated that the treatment of GCs for 1 h with forskolin or 8-CPT-cAMP stimulated the phosphorylation of AKT, tuberin, p70S6k, and S6 (Fig. 3A, lanes 1–4). Therefore, cAMP is sufficient to bring about the phosphorylation of AKT, tuberin, p70S6k, and S6. FSH-stimulated AKT activation in GCs has previously been demonstrated to require PI 3-kinase activity (7Gonzalez-Robayna I.J. Falender A.E. Ochsner S. Firestone G.L. Richards J.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1283-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). We therefore used the PI 3-kinase inhibitor, wortmannin, to determine whether the phosphorylation of tuberin, p70S6k, and S6, also required activation of PI 3-kinase. Wortmannin treatment of GCs prevented FSH from eliciting maximal phosphorylation of AKT, tuberin, p70S6k, and S6 (Fig. 3A, compare lane 2 versus lane 6). Additionally, the phosphorylation of these proteins in response to forskolin (Fig. 3A, compare lane 3 versus lane 7) and 8-CPT-cAMP (Fig. 3A, compare lane 4 versus lane 8) was abrogated by wortmannin. These results thus show that in GCs, PI 3-kinase activity downstream of cAMP is required for the phosphorylation of AKT, tuberin, p70S6k, and S6. Rheb Activation of mTOR Downstream of AKT Leads to p70S6k and S6 Activation—In the following experiments, we used the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin, a macrolide that inhibits mTOR in a selective manner (53Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3957) Google Scholar), to verify that phosphorylation of p70S6k at Thr-389 and the subsequent activation of S6 occur downstream of mTOR activation in FSH-stimulated GCs. Treatment of GCs with rapamycin did not affect FSH-mediated phosphorylation of either AKT or tuberin but abrogated the phosphorylation of p70S6k and its target S6 (Fig 3B, compare lanes 1 and 2 versus lanes 3 and 4). These data place mTOR activation downstream of AKT phosphorylation/activation and tuberin phosphorylation/inactivation, but upstream of p70S6k and S6 phosphorylation/activation. Recent studies have identified the mechanism by which the AKT substrate tuberin regulates mTOR activity. The small G-protein Rheb has been identified as an activator of mTOR, while tuberin has been identified as a negative regulator of Rheb by acting as its GTP-ase activating protein (54Castro A.F.

https://openalex.org/W2024337788,"Eukaryotic cells respond to DNA damage within the S phase by activating an intra-S checkpoint: a response that includes reducing the rate of DNA synthesis. In yeast cells this can occur via checkpoint-dependent inhibition of origin firing and stabilization of ongoing forks, together with a checkpoint-independent slowing of fork movement. In higher eukaryotes, however, the mechanism by which DNA synthesis is reduced is less clear. We have developed strategies based on DNA fiber labeling that allow the quantitative assessment of rates of replication fork movement, origin firing, and fork stalling throughout the genome by examining large numbers of individually labeled replication forks. We show that exposing S phase cells to ionizing radiation induces a transient block to origin firing but does not affect fork rate or fork stalling. Alkylation damage by methyl methane sulfonate causes a slowing of fork movement and a high rate of fork stalling, in addition to inducing a block to new origin firing. Nucleotide depletion by hydroxyurea also reduces replication fork rate and increases stalling; moreover, in contrast to a recent report, we show that hydroxyurea induces a strong block to new origin firing. The DNA fiber labeling strategy provides a powerful new approach to analyze the dynamics of DNA replication in a perturbed S phase.

The DNA fiber labeling strategy provides a powerful new approach to analyze the dynamics of DNA replication in a perturbed S phase. Many types of DNA damage can cause mutations in the genome of a cell, not only by direct mutagenesis but also by generating lesions that are processed into mutations when DNA is replicated during S phase. Mechanisms that guard against this include multiple DNA repair systems and also cell cycle checkpoints that coordinate cell cycle progression with the DNA damage response (1Zhou B.B. Elledge S.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (2628) Google Scholar). One such checkpoint acts within the S phase to reduce the rate of DNA synthesis, presumably minimizing the risk of damage being fixed into potentially dangerous mutations before it can be repaired. The reduction in rates of DNA synthesis in the intra-S checkpoint may be due to any of a combination of parameters: the overall number of active origins, the temporal program of origin firing, the rates of movement of all active forks, and the occurrence of “fork stalling” events. Any or all of these parameters may be affected by DNA damage, either as a direct physical result of DNA lesions or via the action of checkpoint proteins. This issue has been addressed in some detail in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, in which replication from specific origins has been examined after treatment with methyl methane sulfonate (MMS) 1The abbreviations used are: MMS, methyl methane sulfonate; HU, hydroxyurea; IR, ionizing radiation; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Gy, gray(s). 1The abbreviations used are: MMS, methyl methane sulfonate; HU, hydroxyurea; IR, ionizing radiation; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Gy, gray(s). and hydroxyurea (HU) using a combination of Southern blot, two-dimensional gel, and density transfer analyses of replication intermediates. These techniques can separate effects on origin firing from effects on fork rate, at least on a population level, and they have shown that origin firing is blocked in response to MMS or HU (2Tercero J.A. Diffley J.F.X. Nature. 2001; 412: 553-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 3Shirahige K. Hori Y. Shiraishi K. Yamashita M. Takahashi K. Obuse C. Tsurimoto T. Yoshikawa H. Nature. 1998; 395: 618-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar) and that rates of fork movement are also reduced after MMS damage (2Tercero J.A. Diffley J.F.X. Nature. 2001; 412: 553-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). The block to origin firing in yeast depends on the checkpoint kinases Mec1 and Rad53, whereas the reduction in fork rate appears to be independent of these kinases. Mec1 and Rad53 (homologues of human ATM/ATR and Chk2, respectively) are also central to several other aspects of the S phase checkpoint: the induction of a transcriptional program of damage response genes (4Allen J.B.

Cell. 2003; 112: 391-401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). It is not clear, however, whether these additional checkpoint responses actually affect the rate of DNA synthesis. S phase responses to DNA damage have also been examined extensively in human cells. However, by contrast to the techniques described above, the standard assay for an S phase checkpoint response in mammalian cells, the radioresistant DNA synthesis assay, simply measures rates of overall DNA synthesis by pulse labeling a population of cells with tritiated thymidine after DNA damage. Because it only measures bulk synthesis, this assay cannot distinguish effects on origin firing from those on either fork movement or fork stalling. Moreover, it is affected not only by intra-S phase changes to DNA synthesis but also by inhibition of the G1-to-S transition. In addition, to correlate the incorporation of tritiated thymidine with DNA synthesis, it is necessary to assume that the specific activity of the endogenous dNTP pools remains constant. These pools may, however, be affected by changes in the rates of de novo nucleotide synthesis and/or nucleotide salvage after damage. Therefore, in the absence of a good range of efficient, sequence-defined early and late origins in mammalian genomes (which might facilitate the use of the same techniques employed to study S. cerevisiae), various alternative assays have been used to further investigate specific aspects of the mammalian S phase checkpoint. Size separation of 3H-labeled DNA on an alkaline sucrose gradient after treating cells with ionizing radiation (IR) led to the inference that origin firing is blocked because the proportion of small DNA fragments, assumed to represent recently fired origins, is reduced after IR damage (9Painter R.B. Young B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 7315-7317Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar, 10Painter R.B. Kroc. Found. Ser. 1985; 19: 89-100PubMed Google Scholar). Longer fragments of labeled DNA, assumed to represent ongoing forks, were also found to be reduced but only after much higher doses of IR. A similar block to origin firing was observed after MMS and UV damage, with fork movement again being affected to a lesser extent and only after longer time periods (11Painter R.B. Mutat. Res. 1977; 42: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 12Painter R.B. Mutat. Res. 1985; 145: 63-69PubMed Google Scholar). The response to both IR and UV was found to be deficient in ATM cells. It is important to note, however, that alternative interpretations of much of these data could be made because it is not possible to tell how the large and small DNA fragments actually originated, and like the radioresistant DNA synthesis method, this assay could be skewed by changes to dNTP levels as well as cell cycle effects outside the S phase. Indeed, a subsequent investigation of 3H labeling of DNA in asynchronous versus synchronized cell populations showed that at least 50% of the reduction in 3H labeling that follows exposure to IR in an asynchronous population was due to the complete prevention of S phase entry via a G1/S checkpoint, as opposed to any intra-S phase change in replication dynamics (13Lee H. Larner J.M. Hamlin J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 526-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the existence of a block to origin firing that is genuinely intra-S phase and ATM-dependent has been corroborated by a second method: two-dimensional gel analysis of replication in rDNA (one of the few areas in the mammalian genome showing sequence-defined “early” and “late” replication). This showed, at least qualitatively, that unfired origins could be blocked following IR damage within S phase, whereas fork movement appeared to be minimally affected, at least after moderate IR doses (14Larner J.M. Lee H. Little R.D. Dijkwel P.A. Schildkraut C.L. Hamlin J.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Replication dynamics and their dependence on checkpoint proteins were not tested by the two-dimensional gel method after other forms of DNA damage such as alkylation by MMS. However, an alternative approach has been used to examine origin firing after aphidicolin or HU treatment, drugs that stall replication. This technique, involving the fluorescent labeling of characteristic patterns of “early S” and “late S” foci in Chinese hamster ovary cells, revealed an ATR/Chk1-dependent block to the appearance of late replication patterns when the cells are treated with aphidicolin (15Zachos G. Rainey M.D. Gillespie D.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 713-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 16Dimitrova D.S. Gilbert D.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 686-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). This was interpreted as a checkpoint-dependent block to origin firing; however, the method does not yield quantitative data on the numbers or proportions of affected origins in the labeled foci, nor can it address other parameters such as fork rate or fork collapse. Finally, all of the techniques described above, including those used to examine replication in yeast, rely on examining replication intermediates in populations of cells. Thus, all such approaches may miss important information that can be obtained by examining individual replication forks. To integrate all these different pieces of information using a single experimental system, a DNA fiber-labeling strategy has been developed in which all the various parameters determining DNA synthesis during the S phase can be assessed individually, on the level of single replication forks as opposed to whole cell populations. This method measures DNA synthesis across the entire genome, independently of sequence or structure; it is quantitative, and the results can be subjected to statistical analysis. The technique has been used in a systematic investigation of both the immediate and longer term changes to replication dynamics, which occur after a variety of DNA-damaging and replication-stalling stimuli. Cell Culture and Synchronization—HeLa cells were grown as monolayers in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium +10% fetal calf serum. Synchronization was carried out by adding 0.17 μm nocodazole (from stock solution 3.4 mm in Me2SO). After 4–5 h, rounded mitotic cells were shaken off into prewarmed PHEM buffer (60 mm PIPES, 25 mm HEPES, 10 mm EDTA, 2 mm MgCl2, pH 6.9), collected with minimal centrifugation (∼130 × g for 5 min) and replated in fresh medium. DNA damaging treatments were applied 15–16 h after replating, when the majority of cells were in the early S phase. The experiment in Fig. 4e was carried out in unsynchronized IMR90 cells, also grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 10% fetal calf serum. Flow Cytometry—Cell samples were prepared by trypsinizing, washing in cold PBS, and fixing for at least 2 h in 70% ethanol at 4 °C. The cells were then washed in complete PBS and incubated for 30 min in 0.5 ml of complete PBS containing 40 μg/ml propidium iodide and 0.5 mg/ml RNase A. Flow cytometry was carried out using a BD Biosciences FACScan. DNA Damaging Treatments—MMS (100% solution; Sigma) was added directly to the culture medium at final concentrations of 0.005–0.03% (0.59–3.54 mm). After 20-min treatments the MMS was removed, and cells were washed twice with MMS-free medium before incubating in further fresh medium. IR exposures were carried out at between 1 and 10 Gy (∼25–250 s; control cells were removed from the incubator for the same time period). HU (Sigma) was dissolved in water and added to the culture medium at final concentrations of 20 μm to 2 mm. Replication Labeling and DNA Fiber Spreads—The cells were single-labeled with 50 μm IdU for 10–60 min, or, for double-labeling, 10 μm or 20 μm IdU for 10 min and then 100 μm CldU for 20 min. In the experiments in Fig. 5, the cells were pulsed with 20 μm IdU for 10 min directly before DNA damage, then incubated with 50 μm thymidine for 15 min to wash out the IdU, and then kept in fresh medium before double-labeling 1.5–4.5 h later. DNA spreads were made as described by Jackson and Pombo (18Jackson D.A. Pombo A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1285-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar), with certain modifications. Briefly, the cells were trypsinized and resuspended in ice-cold PBS at 2.5 × 105 cells/ml. The labeled cells were diluted 1:8 in unlabeled cells, and 2.5 μl of cells were mixed with 7.5 μl of spreading buffer (0.5% SDS in 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm EDTA) on a glass slide. After ∼8 min the slides were tilted at ∼15°, and the resulting DNA spreads were air-dried, fixed in 3:1 methanol/acetic acid, and refrigerated overnight. Immunolabeling—The slides were treated with 2.5 m HCl for 1 h, washed several times in PBS, and blocked in 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Tween 20. The slides were then incubated at room temperature with the following antibodies, rinsed three times in PBS, and then washed three times for 20 min in blocking buffer between each incubation: 1) overnight in 1:2000 rat anti-bromodeoxyuridine (detects CldU) (OBT0030F Immunologicals Direct); 2) 2 h in 1:1000 Alexafluor 633-conjugated anti-rat (A-21094 Molecular Probes); 3) 2 h in 1:500 mouse anti-bromodeoxyuridine (detects IdU) (MD5100 Caltag); and 4) 2 h in 1:1000 Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse (C-2181 Sigma). The slides were then counterstained for 20 min with 1:20 000 YOYO-1 in PBS (Molecular Probes) before rinsing three times in PBS and mounting in PBS/glycerol. Microscopy was carried out using a Zeiss LSM Meta 510 confocal microscope. S Phase Progression is Slowed by IR, MMS, and HU—Many techniques used to synchronize cells in S phase, such as aphidicolin, mimosine, or double thymidine blocks, interfere with replication forks and are likely to activate DNA damage responses. Therefore, in this study, HeLa cells were synchronized by nocodazole arrest, mitotic shake-off, and release for 16 h, at which point most cells are in the early S phase. Initially, we used such synchronized cells to examine the effects of various treatments on overall S phase progression. First, the cells were treated with 20-min pulses of 0.001–0.03% MMS, the MMS was removed, and S phase progression was followed by flow cytometry over the next 12 h. Fig. 1a shows that S phase was slowed in a dose-dependent manner, ranging from a mild effect after 0.005% MMS to nearly complete arrest over 12 h after the 0.03% treatment. Second, S phase progression was followed after exposure to 1 or 5 Gy of IR (exposures that should cause ∼36 and 180 double-stranded breaks/cell, respectively (17Rothkamm K. Lobrich M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5057-5062Crossref PubMed Scopus (1315) Google Scholar)). 1 Gy did not cause a detectable slowing of S phase, but 5 Gy resulted in a moderate slowing of S phase progression (Fig. 1b). Third, 5–100 μM HU was added to the cells in the early S phase. Again, a dose-dependent slowing of the S phase was observed (Fig. 1c); 5 μm HU had little effect, 20 μm caused a significant slowing of S phase, and 100 μm lead to arrest with a nearly 2C DNA content. Fork Movement Is Reduced by MMS and HU but Not by IR Damage—The DNA fiber labeling (DIRVISH) technique (18Jackson D.A. Pombo A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1285-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar) has been adapted in this study such that two distinguishable modified nucleotides, IdU and CldU (19Aten J.A. Bakker P.J. Stap J. Boschman G.A. Veenhof C.H. Histochem. J. 1992; 24: 251-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), could be used to label replication within a single S phase. In this technique (itself adapted from the classical DNA fiber autoradiography technique (20Huberman J.A. Riggs A.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 32: 327-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar) in which newly replicated DNA is labeled with tritiated thymidine), the cells are pulse-labeled with halogenated nucleotides, then collected, and lysed on a glass slide. By tipping the slide, DNA from the cells is spread out in the form of single fibers. This DNA is subsequently fixed, denatured, and immunolabeled to detect the halogenated nucleotides. In these experiments, all of the DNA was then counterstained in a third color with YOYO-1 DNA dye, allowing the exclusion of any broken or tangled fibers. Consecutive pulse labeling of the S phase cells with IdU and then CldU yields double-fluorescently labeled tracks on the DNA that can be interpreted unambiguously as either ongoing forks, newly fired origins, terminations, or fork stalling events (Fig. 2). The length of any track after a given labeling period is proportional to its fork rate, whereas counting the relative numbers of different track forms can determine changes in the rates of origin firing or fork stalling after DNA damage. DNA fiber assays were carried out after each of the three treatments examined in Fig. 1 to establish which parameter(s) of DNA synthesis contributed to the overall slowing of S phase seen by flow cytometry. To quantify any change in fork rates after DNA damage, the cells were exposed to 20-min pulses of MMS (0.005–0.03%) and then, after removal of the MMS, immediately labeled with IdU for 10–60 min before preparing DNA fiber spreads. The mean length of at least 50 IdU-labeled tracks was calculated for each time period. Fig. 3a shows that fork rates were reduced for at least 60 min after more severe MMS treatments. The severity of slowing was correlated with the MMS dose, but slowing was only observed above ∼0.01% MMS. Fig. 3b shows that reduction of cellular dNTP pools by treatment with hydroxyurea also slows replication forks in a dose-dependent manner. When cells were treated with sufficiently high levels of HU (above ∼100 μm), the forks were essentially stalled, and very little progression occurred over several hours (data not shown). By contrast to MMS and HU, IR did not cause detectable fork-slowing, even at doses that do reduce overall S phase progression. Fig. 3c shows no significant change in the mean lengths of tracks labeled after IR exposures of up to 5 Gy. Origin Firing Is Rapidly Inhibited after IR, MMS, or HU— DNA fiber labeling can be used to distinguish newly fired origins from ongoing forks using the experimental protocol outlined in Fig. 4a. Active replication forks prior to damage were labeled with IdU, and the cells were then treated with damage and the IdU was replaced by CldU. During the subsequent 20 min, any newly fired origins will generate tracks labeled along their entire length with CldU, and they can be counted against the number of double-labeled (ongoing) forks that were tagged with IdU prior to damage. Fig. 4b shows that origin firing was inhibited in response to MMS and that the severity of inhibition was dose-dependent over the range tested (20-min pulses of MMS at 0.005–0.02%). Exposure to IR also inhibited origin firing, but unlike the response to MMS, this may show a threshold between 1 and 2.5 Gy (Fig. 4c). No further decrease in origin firing was then seen after IR exposures up to 10 Gy (data not shown). This damage-insensitive subset of initiation events, seen after the maximum doses of both IR and MMS damage, may represent the proportion of the total origins, which are already committed to fire within this 20-min labeling period at the time of damage. The response of cells to HU was also tested in this origin blocking assay, because nucleotide depletion has been shown to inhibit origin firing via the S phase checkpoint in S. cerevisiae (2Tercero J.A. Diffley J.F.X. Nature. 2001; 412: 553-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 3Shirahige K. Hori Y. Shiraishi K. Yamashita M. Takahashi K. Obuse C. Tsurimoto T. Yoshikawa H. Nature. 1998; 395: 618-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 21Santocanale C. Diffley J.F.X. Nature. 1998; 395: 615-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). In higher eukaryotes the S phase checkpoint response to HU has not been tested, but aphidicolin, which stalls replication by inhibiting DNA polymerases, does inhibit the appearance of late S phase foci in Chinese hamster ovary cells (16Dimitrova D.S. Gilbert D.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 686-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Replication forks were prelabeled for 10 min with IdU as before, and then the IdU was replaced with CldU together with 250 μm HU. The accumulation of new (CldU-labeled) origins was then counted against the IdU-tagged ongoing tracks over the subsequent 2–6 h. Fig. 4d shows that origin firing is greatly reduced, such that it takes 6 h to accumulate the same number of origin firing events that occur in control cells in less than 1 h. It is unlikely that many new origins did fire but were simply not labeled because of nucleotide depletion, because most existing forks were able to progress, incorporating CldU, for a further 1–2 μm over the 6 h of HU arrest. To confirm this, the experiment was repeated using only 50 μm HU, a concentration that allows existing forks to elongate more extensively, growing by 3–4 μm over 3 h. As before, new origin firing was severely inhibited (Fig. 4d). Because of a recent report indicating an increase in origin firing after treatment of a modified hamster fibroblast cell line with HU (22Anglana M. Apiou F. Bensimon A. Debatisse M. Cell. 2003; 114: 385-394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), this experiment was repeated using primary human fibroblasts instead of HeLa cells, and a similar inhibition of new origin firing was observed (Fig. 4e). Origin Firing Recovers at Different Rates after IR, MMS, and HU—A modified version of the origin-firing assay described above was used to assess recovery in the rate of firing over longer periods after DNA damage (Fig. 5a). As in Fig. 4, active replication forks were tagged with a pulse of IdU prior to DNA damage (Fig. 5a, tracks a), and then the IdU was washed out before MMS or IR were applied. This generates exclusively IdU-labeled (red) tracks representing the number of active replication forks before DNA damage. At time points from 1.5 to 4.5 h later, the cells were then double-labeled with consecutive pulses of IdU (red) and CldU (green). This protocol distinguishes any new origins actually firing at each time point (exclusively green or green at both ends: labeled c in Fig. 5a) from ongoing replication forks (red then green: b in Fig. 5a). These new origins were counted against the exclusively red tracks that form an internal control because they had been tagged identically in all the cells before any DNA damage. Fig. 5b shows that a 20-min pulse of 0.01% MMS (gray bars) elicited a sustained block to origin firing when compared with the levels occurring in undamaged cells (white bars); origin firing recovered to only a very limited extent during at least 4.5 h after the MMS treatment. In comparison, 5 Gy IR (Fig. 5c) caused a much more transient block to origin firing with significant recovery after only 1.5 h. By 3 h post-IR exposure, origin firing had returned to normal levels. The efficiency of origin firing recovery was also assessed after release from an HU arrest. As before, replication forks were prelabeled with IdU and then completely arrested by adding a high level of HU for 1–4 h. Upon release from HU, the IdU was replaced with CldU, and new origins fired within 1 h were counted against the prelabeled tracks. By comparison with either IR or MMS damage, origin firing recovered relatively well after a brief (1 h) HU arrest, but recovery became progressively less efficient after longer periods (2–4 h) (Fig. 5e). This is unlikely to be an artifact because of under-detection of CldU-labeled tracks after HU release, because the nucleotide balance within the cells recovered sufficiently fast to allow the origins that did fire to elongate by ∼3 μm within 30 min and 6 μm within 60 min (data not shown). Replication Forks Stall at an Elevated Rate after MMS and HU but Not after IR—The slowing of replication forks after MMS damage, which was documented in Fig. 3, could result from at least two distinct modes of altered fork progression. DNA damage may provoke a pan-nuclear change to a slower mode of replication, for example, by modification of all replication forks or a change to a different polymerase. Alternatively, there could simply be a series of transient stalling events at each fork in isolation as it encounters successive DNA lesions. If such fork stalling does occur within the time frame of a double-labeling experiment (Fig. 4a), it should be detectable in the form of IdU-labeled tracks, which fail to incorporate the subsequent 20-min pulse of CldU because they are currently stalled. These events will therefore appear as an elevated number of red-only tracks (Fig. 2). When the percentage of these red-only tracks was counted, a significant level of fork stalling was indeed found after higher MMS treatments (Fig. 6a), supporting the hypothesis that fork slowing occurs via stochastic stalling events. By contrast, IR did not cause significant fork stalling, consistent with the lack of overall fork slowing after IR damage (Fig. 6b). In the case of HU treatment, all forks are essentially stalled by sufficiently high levels of HU. In lower levels of HU, however, replication does proceed at reduced speed (Fig. 3b), and in this situation there is elevated fork stalling, detectable in as little as 5 μm HU and increasing in a dose-dependent fashion to very high levels when S phase cells are subjected to 20 or 50 μm HU (Fig. 6c). This work comprises the first systematic investigation of all the various parameters that determine the rate of DNA synthesis in mammalian cells during S phase and the ways in which these parameters are affected by DNA damage. The fiber labeling technique developed here is an improvement on other methods that have been used to investigate S phase checkpoint responses because it unambiguously separates changes in the rate of origin firing from changes in the rates of fork movement and fork stalling. Using this technique, each of these parameters can be examined quantitatively and under comparable conditions, using the same experimental method throughout. (Labeling cells with short pulses of modified nucleotides does not in itself perturb the S phase (23Hamlin J.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1978; 112: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) or activate the S phase checkpoint in yeast (24Vernis L. Piskur J. Diffley J.F.X. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: e120Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), so the technique should measure only changes in DNA synthesis that are induced by IR, MMS, or HU.) Fiber labeling also offers the advantage of revealing replication dynamics on the level of individual forks rather than as an average of an entire cell population. It does not allow any analysis of replicon clustering in relation to higher order chromatin or nuclear structure, but it does allow subtle yet potentially important effects on a minority of individual forks to be detected and quantified. Effects of IR, MMS, and HU on Replication Dynamics: Mammalian Cells Compared with S. cerevisiae—This study shows that different forms of DNA damage affect replication in different ways. Moderate levels of ionizing radiation, alkylation by MMS, or nucleotide depletion by HU can all slow down the overall progression of S phase. In the case of IR, this slowing appears to be entirely due to a rapid but fairly transient block to origin"
https://openalex.org/W2092782214,"Unlike other kinesins, middle motor domain-type kinesins depolymerize the microtubule from its ends. To elucidate its mechanism, we solved the X-ray crystallographic structure of KIF2C, a murine member of this family. Three major class-specific features were identified. The class-specific N-terminal neck adopts a long and rigid helical structure extending out vertically into the interprotofilament groove. This structure explains its dual roles in targeting to the end of the microtubule and in destabilization of the lateral interaction of the protofilament. The loop L2 forms a unique finger-like structure, long and rigid enough to reach the next tubulin subunit to stabilize the peeling of the protofilament. The open conformation of the switch I loop could be reversed by the shift of the microtubule binding L8 loop, suggesting its role as the sensor to trigger ATP hydrolysis. Mutational analysis supports these structural implications."

To obtain structure-based insight into the mechanism by which the redox state regulates Ec DOS catalytic activity, we have determined the crystal structures of Ec DOSH in both the inactive Fe3+ and active Fe2+ forms at 1.32 and 1.9 Å resolution, respectively. In this report, we present the structure of the redox-sensing PAS domain for the first time. These results lead us to propose a possible link between local conformational changes caused by a single electron and a global “scissor-type” motion of dimer subunits that may be important for downstream signaling control. Purification and Crystallography—Ec DOSH was purified from a recombinant E. coli system, as described previously (3Sasakura Y. Hirata S. Sugiyama S. Suzuki S. Taguchi S. Watanabe M. Matsui T. Sagami I. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23821-23827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Most of the sample was obtained in the oxy form after lysis of E. coli. and finally purified as the Fe3+ form. Crystals of Fe3+ Ec DOS were grown using the hanging drop vapor-diffusion method at 22 °C. The reservoir solution consisted of 100 mm MES, pH 6.0, and 1.6 m ammonium sulfate as a precipitant. Initial droplets contained 1.5 μl of 24 mg/ml protein solution and 1.5 μl of a reservoir solution and were equilibrated against 500-μl reservoir solutions. Crystals were transferred into reservoir buffer containing 20% (v/v) glycerol. A crystal was picked up with a nylon loop and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Crystals of the Fe2+ form were prepared by soaking the Fe3+ crystal in the above 20% glycerol reservoir buffer saturated with sodium dithionite for 5 min and then frozen in liquid nitrogen. Data Collection and Structure Determination—Single wavelength anomalous diffraction data were collected to 1.9 Å resolution on an R-AXIS VII imaging plate using a Rigaku rotating anode x-ray generator equipped with confocal mirror optics. Intensities were integrated and scaled using CrystalClear (Rigaku/MSC). The space group and unit cell parameter are similar to those reported previously (14Park H. Suquet C. Savenkova M.I.

The heme iron position was determined by means of a Bijvoet difference Patterson map using Crystallography and NMR System program (15Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P.

Further calculation and density modification by crystallography NMR software revealed an electron density map of interpretable quality. Model building was performed using the O program (16Jones T.A.

High resolution native data were collected at beamlines BL41XU, equipped with a MarCCD detector for the Fe3+ form, and BL44XU, equipped with a DIP2040 detector for the Fe2+ form of SPring-8, respectively.

MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). A least square fit analysis of the Ec DOSH structure against four known structures of the PAS superfamily was performed with the residues shown boxed in Fig. 1c. The secondary structure-based alignment led to r.m.s.d. values of 1.19 Å for RmFixL (an oxygen sensor, FixL, from Rhizobium meliloti) (22Miyatake H. Mukai M. Park S.Y. Adachi S. Tamura K.

Cell. 1998; 95: 649-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Overall Structure—Ec DOSH exhibits a PAS fold characterized by several α-helices flanking a five-stranded antiparallel β-sheet scaffold (see supplementary Fig. 1). Two characteristic differences are evident in the secondary structure compared with other PAS domains. Specifically, an additional short helix (F′α) is present, and the Fα helix is shorter than that of Rm-FixL (see supplementary Fig. 1) (22Miyatake H. Mukai M. Park S.Y. Adachi S. Tamura K. Nakamura H. Nakamura K. Tsuchiya T. Iizuka T. Shiro Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 415-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). This may be due to the existence of two proline residues (Pro-74 and Pro-78), which act as a helix breaker (Fig. 1c). As expected from the size exclusion chromatography (3Sasakura Y. Hirata S. Sugiyama S. Suzuki S. Taguchi S. Watanabe M. Matsui T. Sagami I. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23821-23827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), the structure shows a homodimer (Fig. 1b). Two subunits in an asymmetric unit show similar structure (r.m.s.d. of Cα atoms is 0.42 Å) and are related by a pseudo 2-fold axis (Fig. 2a). The heme planes are approximately parallel to each other (Fig. 2a), with an iron–iron distance of 30.4 Å. Heme distal sites face each other and are located near the dimer interface, which includes a short N-terminal helix (IIα) and two β-strands (H and I). The IIα helices in the subunits interact with each other, leading to stabilization of the dimer via hydrophobic interactions between Phe-22, Phe-23, Leu-26, and Phe-44 and a large total buried surface area of 2440 Å2. Heme Binding Site—An initial single wavelength anomalous diffraction map clearly shows that Fe3+ Ec DOSH contains a hexa-coordinate heme iron. Fig. 2b shows a close-up view of the heme distal site. The heme ligand in the distal site is a water molecule, W1. This is critical for Ec DOS function, because the distal axial heme ligand must be displaced in the allosteric switch from the “off” to the “on” state (12Sato A. Sasakura Y. Sugiyama S. Sagami I. Shimizu T. Mizutani Y. Kitagawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32650-32658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The water molecule W1 is in a hydrophobic environment defined by Leu-99, Phe-113, and Leu-115 and is stabilized by another water molecule, W2, which is hydrogen-bonded to the heme propionate oxygen (Fig. 3a). Previous resonance Raman studies showed that Fe3+ Ec DOSH contains a low spin heme. The spectra do not change in the range of pH 4.0–10.0 (12Sato A. Sasakura Y. Sugiyama S. Sagami I. Shimizu T. Mizutani Y. Kitagawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32650-32658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Earlier data and the current structure collectively suggest that the distal water molecule W1 is in the OH- form with an unusual pKa value below pH 4.0. In the heme proximal site, His-77 axially coordinates with the heme iron. The Fe–N bond distance is 1.97 Å (Fig. 3a). The imidazole ND1 atom of His-77 is hydrogen-bonded to the water molecule, W3, with a distance of 2.78 Å. W3 is additionally hydrogen-bonded to W4 and W5. W3 and W4 form hydrogen bonds with Asp-40 and Asn-64, respectively, consequently fixing the orientation of the imidazole ring of His-77 to the plane of the heme group. One of the structural factors responsible for the Fe–N bond character is the basicity of the imidazole ring of proximal His, which is modulated by the strength of the hydrogen bond between imidazole NH and its surroundings. His-77 does not form a strong hydrogen bond to the surrounding residues. This appears to be consistent with the relatively low Fe–NHis stretching frequency for Ec DOSH (214 cm-1) in resonance Raman spectra (12Sato A. Sasakura Y. Sugiyama S. Sagami I. Shimizu T. Mizutani Y. Kitagawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32650-32658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Heme-Ligand Switching and Refolding of the FG Loop—We analyzed the physiologically active Fe2+ form of Ec DOSH. Upon heme iron reduction, the distal water molecule W1 was displaced by Met-95 of the FG loop (encompassing residues 86–97 between the Fα-helix and Gβ-strand) (see supplementary Fig. 2). Heme-ligand switching is one of the most important findings in this study. The redox-dependent allosteric switch observed here is consistent with our previous conclusion that the PDE activity of Ec DOSH is controlled by the heme redox state (3Sasakura Y. Hirata S. Sugiyama S. Suzuki S. Taguchi S. Watanabe M. Matsui T. Sagami I. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23821-23827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The heme-ligand switching found here is also consistent with our previous finding that the distal heme ligand in Fe3+ form, which is now identified as a water molecule, is displaced by Met-95 in Fe2+ form (12Sato A. Sasakura Y. Sugiyama S. Sagami I. Shimizu T. Mizutani Y. Kitagawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32650-32658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In the Fe2+ state the side chain of His-77, the heme ligand at the proximal site, did not display significant movement (Figs. 2b, right, and 3b). Additionally, no significant effect was observed on the hydrogen bonding network around the His-77 side chain. Thus, heme reduction appears to affect only the distal site near the dimer interface (Fig. 2b). Heme-ligand switching does not induce porphyrin movement (Fig. 3b) but is accompanied by refolding of the FG loop region (Fig. 2b). FG loops are located near the heme distal site. This region is highly flexible in the Fe3+ form, in view of its noninterpretable electron density. However, the reduced (Fe2+) form of Ec DOSH exhibits unambiguous electron density (Fig. 3b). We conclude that upon heme reduction, the FG loop is significantly rigidified. Gly-94 and Met-95 main chains form hydrogen bonds with heme propionate oxygen, which appear to fix the FG loop regions. Gly-94 may be important for accommodating large conformational changes, because the small side chain is preferred to avoid steric hindrance. These observations indicate a direct link between coordination of Met-95 with the heme iron and refolding of the FG loop region. The CO-sensing transcriptional activator, CooA, displayed similar heme-ligand switching from the Cys-75/Pro-2 to His-77/Pro-2 ligand pair upon heme reduction (8Lanzilotta W.N. Schuller D.J. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 876-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 26Nakajima H. Honma Y. Tawara T. Kato T. Park S.Y. Miyatake H. Shiro Y. Aono S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7055-7061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Additionally, heme-ligand switching was observed from His-17/His-69 to Met-106/His-69 in the cytochrome c domain of cytochrome cd1 nitrite reductase (27Williams P.A. Fulop V. Garman E.F. Saunders N.F. Ferguson S.J. Hajdu J. Nature. 1997; 389: 406-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Both cases involved anomalous redox chemistry, i.e. hysteresis (26Nakajima H. Honma Y.

Chapman S.K. Ferguson S.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4243-4249Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, Ec DOS has similar oxidation and redox potentials (3Sasakura Y. Hirata S. Sugiyama S. Suzuki S. Taguchi S. Watanabe M. Matsui T. Sagami I. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23821-23827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that the activation energy upon heme-ligand switching of Ec DOS is much smaller than that in CooA or cytochrome cd1 nitrite reductase. Redox-induced protein folding is observed in cytochrome c, which also contains a His/Met heme-ligand pair (29Pascher T. Chesick J.P. Winkler J.R. Gray H.B. Science. 1996; 271: 1558-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). This is possibly because of stabilized Met-iron coordination in the reduced form. Selective formation of the His/Met ligand pair in the reduced form is additionally observed in the cytochrome c domain of cytochrome cd1 nitrite reductase, as described above (27Williams P.A. Fulop V. Garman E.F. Saunders N.F. Ferguson S.J. Hajdu J. Nature. 1997; 389: 406-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The data indicate a general mechanism by which redox energy is converted into conformational energy using a His/Met heme-ligand pair. Rearrangement of the Hydrogen Bond Network—Heme-ligand switching from His-77/water to a His-77/Met-95 ligand pair induces conformational adaptations, including rearrangement of the hydrogen bond pattern and fine-tuning of side chains in the heme vicinity. Fig. 4a depicts the hydrogen bond network around the heme in the Fe3+ and Fe2+ forms of Ec DOSH. Two water molecules, W1 and W2, are lost upon coordination of Met-95 with the heme iron (Fig. 4a). The hydrogen bond between W2 and heme propionate is replaced by a bond between main chain nitrogen of Met-95 and heme propionate oxygen. Main chain oxygen of Gly-94 of the rigidified FG loop forms hydrogen bonds with the main chain oxygen of Phe-113 and nitrogen of Leu-115 via a water molecule. In addition to hydrogen bond rearrangement, fine-tuning of the side chains of Phe-113 and Leu-115 occurs in response to heme coordination with Met-95 (Fig. 4a). Ile-238 of the oxygen sensor, BjFixL (FixL from Bradyrhizobium japonicum), corresponding to Leu-115 of Ec DOSH, displays similar side chain adaptations upon binding of the exogenous heme ligand of O2 (30Hao B. Isaza C. Arndt J. Soltis M. Chan M.K. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12952-12958Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). These changes in the heme distal site appear to stabilize the formation of an intersubunit hydrogen bond between the main chain oxygen of Phe-113 and Arg-131 via a water molecule (Fig. 4a). Fig. 4, b and c, depicts the buried surface area of subunit I in the Fe3+ and Fe2+ forms. As shown in Fig. 4a, Ser-116 forms intersubunit hydrogen bonds with the main chain of Met-30. This region is in close contact in both the Fe2+ and Fe3+ forms and is therefore not significantly affected (Fig. 4b). The contact area of Phe-113 and Arg-131 is located in the peripheral region of the dimer interface. This region shifts closer in the Fe2+ form (Fig. 4, b and c). Upon heme reduction, Met-95 coordination at the heme distal site locks the dimer into a tighter complex by bringing Phe-113 of one subunit and Arg-131 of the other subunit closer together (Fig. 4a). Therefore, redox-induced adaptation at the heme distal site triggers changes at the dimer interface. Scissor-type Subunit Movement—To characterize changes at the dimer interface, the relative orientation of the two subunits was compared between the Fe3+ and Fe2+ forms. Fig. 5a depicts the superimposition of Fe3+ and Fe2+ forms of Ec DOSH. Superimposition of the two forms (PAS core regions, residues 31–88 and 97–132 of the two subunits) revealed r.m.s.d. values of 0.49 Å for 188 Cα atoms. When each subunit was superimposed independently, the r.m.s.d. values of Cα atoms were smaller (0.40 Å for subunit I and 0.37 Å for subunit II). The data suggest that each subunit moves as a rigid body following heme reduction. This unexpected redox-induced subunit movement appears critical for catalytic control. To define subunit movement more precisely, the rotation axis was calculated (Fig. 5a, circle with dot in it, b, red stick) (31Kurokawa H. Osawa M. Kurihara H. Katayama N. Tokumitsu H. Swindells M.B. Kainosho M. Ikura M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 59-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The rotation axis runs close to and is approximately perpendicular to the pseudo 2-fold axis (Fig. 5, a and b, blue stick). For superimposition of subunit I (depicted in blue for the Fe3+ form and orange for the Fe2+ form) following that of subunit II (depicted in cyan for the Fe3+ form and yellow for the Fe2+ form), a 3° rotation around the axis was required. Although no significant changes were observed in most residues near the rotation axis (hinge region) upon reduction, this scissor-type motion led to maximum displacement of Ser-107 of subunit I (1.3 Å), which is 30 Å away from the hinge. Redox-controlled Signal Transduction—The crystal structures of the Fe3+ and Fe2+ forms of Ec DOSH reported here propose a novel heme-redox switch, which may provide important insight into redox-dependent signal transduction. Although the structure discussed in this report only represents part of Ec DOS (Fig. 1a), the data reveal a possible connection between heme-ligand switching and the scissor-type subunit movement, which may be important for the catalytic control of Ec DOSH. The overall transition upon heme reduction is likely to be initiated by heme-ligand switching from a water molecule to a Met-95 side chain at the heme distal site. This step appears to be strictly regulated by the heme redox state and is one of the most important findings in this report. Significant changes were observed in the FG loop of Ec DOSH only, indicating that conformational alterations upon reduction are limited to this region. Similar conformational changes in this loop region are observed in PAS kinase, a mammalian serine/threonine kinase with the PAS sensor domain. Refolding of the FG loop in PAS kinase is induced by binding to a small organic molecule, which results in activation of the kinase domain (32Amezcua C.A. Harper S.M. Rutter J. Gardner K.H. Structure (Camb.). 2002; 10: 1349-1361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). This is of interest because two PAS sensors from bacteria (Ec DOSH) and mammals (PAS kinase) may share a similar sensory mechanism in which refolding of the FG loop plays a key role in converting environmental stimuli into biological signals by modifying protein-protein interactions. Met-95 ligation and refolding of the FG loop in Ec DOSH tightens the hydrogen bond network at the heme distal site. Reorganization of the hydrogen bond network, in turn, may induce alterations at the dimer interface. These changes appear to be mediated by residues in the Iβ-strand, specifically Phe-113, Leu-115, and Ser-116. Recent NMR studies (33Harper S.M. Neil L.C. Gardner K.H. Science. 2003; 301: 1541-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar) on the photoreceptor PAS domain, AsLOV2, revealed that an additional C-terminal Jα helix associates with the PAS core region of Gβ, Hβ, and Iβ strands in the dark state. Photoinduced changes disrupt interactions of these strands with the Jα helix, which in turn enhances the autophosphorylation activity of the C-terminal kinase domain. The Iβ-strand appears important for regulating the signaling of both Ec DOS and AsLOV2, because this region mediates the conversion of local conformational changes sensed by small organic molecules (heme for Ec DOSH and FMN for AsLOV2) into global subunit-subunit interaction modifications (scissor-type motion for Ec DOSH and the release of the Jα helix from the PAS core for AsLOV2) in both proteins. The subunit movement of Ec DOSH is characteristic of a scissor-type hinge motion, as shown in Fig. 5. Similar subunit movements were observed in the aspartate receptor of chemotaxis, which also involves a small subunit rotation (4°) upon ligand binding (34Milburn M.V. Prive G.G. Milligan D.L. Scott W.G. Yeh J. Jancarik J. Koshland Jr., D.E. Kim S.H. Science. 1991; 254: 1342-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). This inhibits the activity of histidine kinase CheA, a downstream signaling molecule. Milburn et al. (34Milburn M.V. Prive G.G. Milligan D.L. Scott W.G. Yeh J. Jancarik J. Koshland Jr., D.E. Kim S.H. Science. 1991; 254: 1342-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) suggested that a minor rotation at the periplasmic sensor domain of the aspartate receptor is amplified at the cytoplasmic domain more than 100 Å away. Because dimer or tetramer formation of Ec DOS is a prerequisite for PDE activity (4Yoshimura T. Sagami I. Sasakura Y. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 53105-53111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), subunit-subunit interactions at the PDE domain appear to be critical for catalytic regulation. Possibly, the scissor-type motion of Ec DOS may affect PDE activity (Fig. 5c), because hinge rotation at the PAS domain is likely to be amplified at the distant PDE domain. Note that the catalytic control by the scissor-type subunit movement shown in Fig. 5c is only a proposal. To verify the current proposed model, further experiments are needed to examine the interactions between the Ec DOSH domain and the PDE domain in both the Fe3+ and Fe2+ forms. Mutational and crystallographic studies of the entire Ec DOS enzyme are currently underway. We thank M. Kawamoto and E. Yamashita for help on data collection at beamlines BL41XU and BL44XU and C.

Using permanganate footprinting as well as highly purified factors, we show that NER is a dynamic process that takes place in a number of successive steps during which the DNA is remodeled around the lesion in response to the various NER factors. XPC/HR23B first recognizes the damaged structure and initiates the opening of the helix from position -3 to +6. TFIIH is then recruited and, in the presence of ATP, extends the opening from position -6 to +6; it also displaces XPC downstream from the lesion, thereby providing the topological structure for recruiting XPA and RPA, which will enlarge the opening. Once targeted by XPG, the damaged DNA is further melted from position -19 to +8.

Once targeted by XPG, the damaged DNA is further melted from position -19 to +8. XPG and XPF/ERCC1 endonucleases then cut the damaged DNA at the limit of the opened structure that was previously “labeled” by the positioning of XPC/HR23B and TFIIH. To counteract the detrimental effect of genotoxic attacks, cells activate sophisticated and specific DNA repair pathways. Damage induced by UV radiation, environmental agents, and anticancer drugs are removed by two distinct nucleotide excision repair (NER) 1The abbreviations used are: NER, nucleotide excision repair; ROS, reconstituted opening system; RPA, replication protein A; XPA/C/F/G, xeroderma pigmentosum group A, C, F, or G. 1The abbreviations used are: NER, nucleotide excision repair; ROS, reconstituted opening system; RPA, replication protein A; XPA/C/F/G, xeroderma pigmentosum group A, C, F, or G. subpathways, namely global genome repair (GGR), which eliminates lesions from the entire genome, and transcription-coupled repair (TCR), a specialized pathway that repairs damages on a transcribed strand of active genes (1Bohr V.A. Smith C.A. Okumoto D.S. Hanawalt P.C. Cell. 1985; 40: 359-369Google Scholar, 2Hoeijmakers J.H. Nature. 2001; 411: 366-374Google Scholar, 3Mellon I. Spivak G. Hanawalt P.C. Cell. 1987; 51: 241-249Google Scholar). Human NER involves the ordered action of factors in dual incision and DNA repair resynthesis steps (4De Laat W.L. Jaspers N.G. Hoeijmakers J.H. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 768-785Google Scholar). Any mutation that affects either the enzymatic activity or the ordered assembly of the dual incision complex leads to genetic disorders such as xeroderma pigmentosum, trichothiodystrophy, or Cockayne syndrome (5Bootsma D. Kraemer K.H. Cleaver J.E. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. The Genetic Basis of Human Cancer. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1998: 245-274Google Scholar, 6Lehmann A.R. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 15-23Google Scholar).In global genome repair, the dual incision is a multistep process that results from the coordinated action of XPC/HR23B, TFIIH, XPA, RPA, XPG, and XPF/ERCC1, resulting in the removal of the damaged oligonucleotide (4De Laat W.L. Jaspers N.G. Hoeijmakers J.H. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 768-785Google Scholar, 7Araujo S.J. Tirode F. Coin F. Pospiech H. Syvaoja J.E. Stucki M. Hubscher U. Egly J.M. Wood R.D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 349-359Google Scholar, 8Sancar A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 43-81Google Scholar). After being recognized by the XPC/HR23B complex, the damaged DNA structure is targeted by TFIIH, which recruits the other factors upon the addition of ATP (9Sugasawa K. Ng J. Masutani C.

The unwound DNA is then incised by the two endonucleases XPG and XPF/ERCC1 on the 3′ and 5′ side of the lesion, respectively (12O'Donnovan A. Davies A.A. Moggs J.G. West S.C. Wood R.D.

Hoeijmakers J.H. Wood R.D. Cell. 1996; 86: 811-822Google Scholar), leaving a gap structure that is filled up by the DNA polymerase ϵ or δ and the accompanying factors PCNA, RF-C, RPA, and DNA ligase I (16Shivji M.K.K. Podust V.N. Hubsher U. Wood R.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5011-5017Google Scholar). Whether or not the NER reaction occurs by sequential arrival of the various factors or by a pre-assembled complex referred to as the repairosome or the holoenzyme is still under debate (17Svejstrup J.Q.

Nature. 1996; 381: 86-89Google Scholar). Although the hypothesis of the sequential assembly, which has gained a lot of support from recent biological studies, seems to be more accepted, the order of assembly of the NER factors on the damaged DNA and their contribution to the DNA remodeling to allow the repair are not fully understood (10Volker M. Mone M.J. Karmakar P. van Hoffen A. Schul W. Vermeulen W. Hoeijmakers J.H. van Driel R. van Zeeland A.A. Mullenders L.H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 213-224Google Scholar, 20Araujo S.J. Nigg E.A. Wood R.D.

As an example, to further learn about the role of TFIIH and its XPB and XPD helicases in NER, it is necessary to determine how it associates with the damaged DNA and recruits the additional factors such as XPA and RPA to promote the formation of an open intermediate essential for the dual incision by XPG and XPF endonucleases. In the present study, we have focused our attention on the damaged DNA itself, trying to understand how the various NER factors target it and remodel it to finally allow its opening and dual incision. Thus, we have set up a permanganate footprinting assay for analyzing the formation of single-stranded DNA regions induced by the NER factors and, furthermore, a site-specific protein-DNA photo cross-linking assay for defining the location of some NER factors around the lesion.Using purified factors, we were able to precisely determine the role of each factor in changing the DNA conformation at the various stages of the NER reaction, including damaged DNA recognition, ATP-dependent DNA unwinding, stabilization of the open structure, and oligonucleotide incision.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCloning and Vector Constructions—The XPA, ERCC1, XPF, HR23B, and XPC cDNAs were amplified from a human cDNA library and inserted in the pVL1392 vector (Pharmingen). A His6 tag was added N-terminally to XPA and XPF. The resulting vectors were recombined with baculovirus DNA (BaculoGold DNA, Pharmingen) in Sf9 cells, and viral stocks were prepared by a three-step growth amplification procedure. The human RPA and XPG cDNAs were cloned into expressing vectors (22Henricksen L.A. Umbricht C.B. Wold M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11121-11132Google Scholar, 23O'Donovan A. Scherly D. Clarkson S.G. Wood R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15965-15968Google Scholar).Purification of the Repair Factors—XPF/ERCC1 complex purification was performed as described previously (14de Laat W.L. Appeldoorn E. Jaspers N.G.J. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7835-7842Google Scholar). Briefly, Sf9 cells were infected with ERCC1 and XPF-His-tagged baculoviruses. Cells extracts were prepared in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.15 m NaCl, 20% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1× protease mixture inhibitor) and centrifuged (15,000 rpm for 40 min at 4 °C). The supernatant was dialyzed for 4 h against buffer B (same as buffer A except for 5% glycerol, 0.02% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) and applied to a phosphocellulose column (P11; Whatman), and the flow-through was then applied to a heparin Ultrogel column (Sepracor, Villeneuve la Garenne, France). Following extensive washes, the protein complexes were eluted at 0.6 m NaCl and further incubated for 4 h with 500 μl of the metal affinity resin (Talon; Clontech) in the presence of imidazole (1 mm). After sequential washing with buffer B containing 0.6 m NaCl and 1 mm imidazole, 5 mm imidazole, and, finally, 0.1 m NaCl and 20 mm imidazole, the complex was eluted in buffer B containing 0.1 m NaCl and 0.2 m imidazole. Mutants XPF-D676A and XPF-D720A were purified according to published procedures (15Sijbers A.M. de Laat W.L. Ariza R.R. Biggerstaff M. Wei Y.F. Moggs J.G. Carter K.C. Shell B.K. Evans E. de Jong M.C. Rademakers S. de Rooij J. Jaspers N.G. Hoeijmakers J.H. Wood R.D. Cell. 1996; 86: 811-822Google Scholar). The XPC/HR23B complex or its individual components (XPC and HR23B) were expressed and purified from insect cells (24Sugasawa K. Masutani C. Uchida A. Maekawa T. van der Spek P.J. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H. Hanaoka F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4852-4861Google Scholar). The recombinant heterotrimeric RPA complex was produced in Escherichia coli and purified (22Henricksen L.A. Umbricht C.B. Wold M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11121-11132Google Scholar). Recombinant XPG was produced in insect cells and purified as described (23O'Donovan A. Scherly D. Clarkson S.G. Wood R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15965-15968Google Scholar). All of the NER factors were dialyzed against buffer C (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 mm KCl).XPA insect cell extract was applied on a heparin Ultrogel resin (Sepracor) pre-equilibrated in buffer A and washed with buffer A containing 0.3 m NaCl. XPA was then eluted in buffer A containing 0.5 m NaCl, dialyzed for 3 h against buffer D (50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.8, 10% glycerol, and 0.3 m KCl) and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 200 μl of metal affinity resin (Talon; Clontech). After packing the column, the resin was subsequently washed with buffer D containing 20 mm imidazole and 50 mm imidazole. XPA was eluted in buffer D containing 0.1 m imidazole and next with buffer D containing 0.1 m EDTA. The fractions were pooled and dialyzed against buffer C. TFIIH was purified from HeLa cells (25Gerard M. Fischer L. Moncollin V. Chipoulet J.M. Chambon P. Egly J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20940-20945Google Scholar).Dual Incision Assay—The single cisplatin lesion (Pt-GTG) plasmid, called 105.TS (26Frit P. Kwon K. Coin F. Auriol J. Dubaele S. Salles B. Egly J.M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1391-1401Google Scholar), was used for dual incision (7Araujo S.J. Tirode F. Coin F. Pospiech H. Syvaoja J.E. Stucki M. Hubscher U. Egly J.M. Wood R.D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 349-359Google Scholar) in a 15-μl reaction mixture containing XPC/HR23B (10 ng), XPA (25 ng), RPA (50 ng), XPG (7.5 ng), XPF/ERCC1 (6.25 ng), and TFIIH (20 ng) in the presence of 2 mm ATP. Following 10 min of pre-incubation at 30 °C, 30 ng of the Pt-GTG plasmid was added, and the reactions were further incubated for 90 min. The excised fragment was detected on 14% urea-PAGE after annealing with the complementary oligonucleotide and the addition of four radiolabeled [α-32 P]dCMP residues by Sequenase V2.1 (USB) (26Frit P. Kwon K. Coin F. Auriol J. Dubaele S. Salles B. Egly J.M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1391-1401Google Scholar).KMnO4 Footprinting Assays—The damaged strand probe was obtained upon AgeI digestion of the 105.TS plasmid (26Frit P. Kwon K. Coin F. Auriol J. Dubaele S. Salles B. Egly J.M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1391-1401Google Scholar) and radiolabeling at the 3′end in a Klenow reaction, the Pt adduct being located at 156 bp from the labeled end. For the non-damaged strand, 105.TS was digested by BssHII, labeled, and then digested by HindIII. The resulting 165-bp fragment in which the lesion is located 92 bp from the labeled 3′ end was purified by the “crush and soak ”method after migration in a 5% nondenaturating PAGE (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 6.46-6.49Google Scholar).Reactions (75 μl) were carried out in 20 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.6, 60 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.3 mm EGTA, 0.4% polyvinyl alcohol, and 0.4% polyethylene glycol 10000 buffer containing the labeled cisplatinated probe (40 fmol) and, when indicated, 5 mm ATP, XPC/HR23B (40 ng), XPA (80 ng), RPA (60 ng), XPG (10 ng), XPF/ERCC1 (6.25 ng), and TFIIH (40 ng). After incubation at 30 °C for 15 min, 3 μl of 120 mm KMnO4 was added, and oxidation was allowed to proceed for 3 min at room temperature before reduction by adding 6 μl of 14.6 m β-mercaptoethanol for 5 min in ice. After organic extraction and ethanol precipitation, dried pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of a solution containing 1 m piperidine, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm EGTA and incubated at 90 °C for 25 min. Samples were next ethanol precipitated, and final pellets were recovered in 10 μl of loading buffer and analyzed in 8% urea PAGE (damaged strand probe) or in 12% urea PAGE (undamaged strand probe). In parallel, dideoxy sequencing reactions were performed.Protein-DNA Photo Cross-linking—The synthesis of the photoreactive nucleotide AB-dUTP, complex assembly, and analysis of the photo cross-linked polypeptides were done as described previously (28Douziech M. Coin F. Chipoulet J.M. Arai Y. Ohkuma Y. Egly J.M. Coulombe B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8168-8177Google Scholar, 29Robert F. Coulombe B. Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 148: 383-393Google Scholar). For the synthesis of the photoprobes that place two AB-dUMPs on the 3′ side of the cisplatin (photoprobes +12/+15 and +21/+22), we used cisplatinated oligonucleotides of various lengths designed to allow incorporation at the appropriate positions (details are provided the legend to Fig. 6A). For the synthesis of the photoprobes that place two AB-dUMPs on the 5′ side of the cisplatin (photoprobes -23/-20 and -8/-7), we used both a cisplatinated oligonucleotide and an additional 5′ oligonucleotide for directing the incorporation of AB-dUMP. Fill-in with DNA polymerase and ligation were done as described previously (28Douziech M. Coin F. Chipoulet J.M. Arai Y. Ohkuma Y. Egly J.M. Coulombe B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8168-8177Google Scholar, 29Robert F. Coulombe B. Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 148: 383-393Google Scholar). After gel purification of the photoprobes, complexes were assembled with either XPC/HR23B alone or XPC/HR23B and TFIIH in the presence of ATP (1 mm).RESULTSIn Vitro Reconstitution of DNA Opening in the NER Reaction—To investigate the DNA opening step of the NER reaction, we set up a permanganate sensitivity assay that allows the detection of single-stranded DNA around the cisplatinated DNA by generating breaks in phosphate backbone upon piperidine treatment. In such an assay, KMnO4 oxidized the pyrimidine residues in single-stranded DNA preferentially over those in double-stranded DNA, and the oxidized products could be converted to strand breaks by piperidine treatment (30Jiang Y. Gralla J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1277-1281Google Scholar). In this type of assay, only changes in DNA structure upon protein binding are detected. We thus applied this assay to damaged DNA carrying a single GTG 1,3-intrastrand cisplatin adduct and tested the changes in footprinting patterns upon incubation together with the highly purified factors XPC/HR23B, XPA, RPA, TFIIH, XPG, and XPF/ERCC1 (Fig. 1A) (7Araujo S.J. Tirode F. Coin F. Pospiech H. Syvaoja J.E. Stucki M. Hubscher U. Egly J.M. Wood R.D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 349-359Google Scholar, 26Frit P. Kwon K. Coin F. Auriol J. Dubaele S. Salles B. Egly J.M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1391-1401Google Scholar). This set of factors is both necessary and sufficient to remove the damaged region, and the omission of any one of the factors prevents the dual incision reaction around the cisplatinated adduct (Fig. 1B). Together, they can open the DNA in the absence of XPF/ERCC1 and form the reconstituted opening system (ROS) (Fig. 1C). We thus observed a modification of the pattern of the single-stranded damaged DNA with an increase of the sensitivity around the cisplatin lesion at positions C-3, G-1, and T0 and the appearance of distinctively TFIIH-promoted bands at positions T-5, C-6, T-8, and T-10, (Fig. 1C, left panel, and as summarized in Fig 7A). In the absence of any NER factors, permanganate-sensitive sites were found at positions C-11, C-3, G-1, T0, G+1, C+2, and A+3, arising from the distortion induced by the damage itself (lane 1). We also noticed the appearance of breaks induced by the permanganate treatment in the undamaged strand upon the addition of the ROS factors at positions A0, C-1, C-16, T-17, C-18, and G-19 (lane 5). In the absence of TFIIH and XPC/HR23B, KMnO4 sensitive sites were not detected (lanes 6 and 7).Fig. 1NER factors used in dual incision and damaged DNA opening.

The nucleotides marked with asterisks match up sequentially with the arrows that point to bands of interest. The damaged strand (left panel, lanes 1-3) and undamaged strand probes (right panel, lanes 4-7) were incubated with ROS containing XPC/HR23B, TFIIH, XPA, RPA, and XPG. When indicated, ROS lacks either TFIIH (lanes 2 and 6) or XPC/HR23B (lane 7). Lane 1, bovine serum albumin (100 μg).

A, opening around the Pt-GTG during NER, as evidenced by reactivity to KMnO4, is depicted by placement of these residues above or below the axis of the duplex sequence. The position of the incision sites by XPG and XPF/ERCC1 endonucleases are indicated by arrows. The bottom part of the figure summarizes the photo cross-linking data with XPC/HR23B, either alone (open box) or in the presence of TFIIH and ATP (grey box for XPC, black box for XPB). B, a model representing the relocalization of XPC in the presence of TFIIH and the various steps leading to the removal of the damaged oligonucleotide. Each step is characterized by an increase in the remodeling of damaged DNA that is progressively opened by the repair machinery. In the absence of TFIIH, XPC approaches the damaged DNA from nucleotides -20 to +20, the contact at positions -8/-7 being the strongest. In the presence of TFIIH, XPC cross-links strongly to positions -23/-20 and weakly to positions -8/-7, but does not cross-link to positions on the 3′ end of the cisplatin adduct. The fully open complex (-19 to +8) is used as a template for incision by XPF/ERCC1 and XPG as indicated by arrows.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)XPC Facilitates DNA Opening and Recruits the NER Factors—We next investigated the ability of each factor to separately target the damaged DNA. XPC/HR23B induces local changes in the footprinting pattern at positions G-1 and T-0 (Fig. 2A, lane 7 and C, lane 2). Upon longer exposure, minor changes are also detected over an extensive DNA region from about -20 to +20 (data not shown), further suggesting some “breathing” of the double helix in the region where other factors associate with the DNA (see below). The addition of XPF/ERCC1 to the damaged DNA generates a strong band at position C-3, as well as at positions G-14/G-16 and T+18/G+20 on each side of the lesion, respectively (lane 6), the specificity of which will be discussed below. We noticed, however, that the intensity of the G-1 band is slightly lower, whereas the C-11 band is slightly higher in the absence of NER factors (compare lanes 1-5); when considering weaker bands from A+3 to T+15 for example, they have the same intensity in both conditions.Fig. 2Contribution of the NER factors to the DNA opening. A, XPC/HR23B and XPF/ERCC1 target the damaged DNA. Each NER factor was added separately to the damaged strand probe and tested for KMnO4 modification as indicated by arrows at the right of the panel. Bands corresponding to the 3′ incision are indicated by an arrowhead. B, combinations of the NER factors (except XPC/HR23B) as indicated at the top of the panel. C, XPC (40 ng) and HR23B (40 ng), either alone or in combination (lanes 5 and 9), or the purified XPC/HR23B complex from the co-infected extract (lanes 2 and 6) were tested for KMnO4 modifications (left panel) in the absence (lanes 2-5) or presence of XPA, RPA, TFIIH, and XPG (lanes 6-9). Dual incision in the presence of HR23B (10-40 ng) and XPC (10, 40 and 160 ng) either alone or in combination (XPC, 10 ng; XPC together with 50, 100, and 150 ng of HR23B). Pt, position 0; nt, nucleotide.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We addressed the question of whether any combination of the TFIIH, XPA, RPA, and XPG factors was able to contribute to helix opening in the absence of XPC/XR23B. No significant change in the footprinting pattern was observed using the combination of these factors under standard conditions (Fig. 2B). Only upon longer exposure did we observe a minor change at positions T-5 and C-6 in the presence of XPA and TFIIH (data not shown); the XPA-TFIIH complex was found to exhibit some affinity for damaged DNA (31Nocentini S. Coin F. Saijo M. Tanaka K. Egly J.-M. J. Biol. Sci. 1997; 272: 22991-22994Google Scholar). Altogether, the above results are fully consistent with an early role for the XPC/HR23B complex in recognition of the damage and recruitment of the other NER factors suggested by other studies (9Sugasawa K. Ng J. Masutani C. Iwai S. van der Spek P. Eker A. Hanaoka F. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 223-232Google Scholar, 10Volker M. Mone M.J. Karmakar P. van Hoffen A. Schul W. Vermeulen W. Hoeijmakers J.H. van Driel R. van Zeeland A.A. Mullenders L.H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 213-224Google Scholar).We also analyzed the contribution of each component of the XPC/HR23B complex (24Sugasawa K. Masutani C. Uchida A. Maekawa T. van der Spek P.J. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H. Hanaoka F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4852-4861Google Scholar, 32Masutani C. Sugasawa K. Yanagisawa J. Sonoyama T. Ui M. Enomoto T. Takio K. Tanaka K. van der Spek P.J. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Hanaoka F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1831-1843Google Scholar). The addition of either XPC or HR23B to the damaged DNA provides similar permanganate footprinting patterns, as indicated by the opening at positions G-1 and T+6 (Fig. 2C, lanes 2-5) when the preformed XPC/HR23B complex is used. Upon the addition of XPC/HR23B, the G-1 band is increased 5.5-fold, whereas with either XPC or HR23B G-1 is increased only 2-fold (Fig. 2C; compare lane 2 with lanes 3 and 4). Although either XPC or HR23B similarly target the damaged DNA (Fig. 2C, left panel, lanes 3 and 4), the addition of XPA, RPA, XPG, and TFIIH to HR23B alone does not promote the opening (lane 8), suggesting that HR23B did not allow the recruitment of the unwinding factors and/or their proper positioning. However when XPA, RPA, XPG, and TFIIH are added together with XPC, either alone or in combination with HR23B, permanganate-induced bands are detected at positions T-10, T-8, C-6, T-5, C-3, G-1, T0, and T+6 (Fig. 2C, lanes 7 and 9, and also Fig. 7A), emphasizing the essential role of XPC in recruiting other NER factors. In agreement with the footprint data, the addition of HR23B alone to XPA, RPA, XPG, TFIIH, or XPF/ERCC1 does not allow the removal of the damaged oligonucleotide unless XPC is added (Fig. 2C, right panel).TFIIH Is Recruited to the XPC/HR23B-DNA Complex and Further Advances DNA Opening—Having shown that XPC has an early role in open complex formation, we next addressed the contribution of RPA, XPA, XPG, and TFIIH to DNA opening by incubating the damaged DNA with the ROS system in which one NER factor was systematically omitted. The absence of TFIIH resulted in the loss of the extension of the footprinting pattern induced by XPC/HR23B (Fig. 3A, compare lane 7 with lanes 2 and 3), whereas the omission of RPA or XPG did not significantly affect the overall footprinting pattern (Fig. 3A, lanes 4, 6, and 3, respectively). We especially noticed that, in the absence of XPA, the footprinting intensity at positions T-10, T-8, C-6, and T-5 as well as at positions near the damage site is 2-fold weaker (Fig. 3A, lane 5). Once XPC/HR23B and TFIIH are bound to the damaged DNA, additional NER factors are no longer required to extend the footprinting pattern on the 5′ side. Only on the 3′ side are all NER factors imperative (Fig. 3A, lanes 2-6).Fig. 3Ordered remodeling of the damaged DNA upon NER factor recruitment. A, KMnO4 modification in which NER factors were individually omitted. B, ATP induces DNA unwinding by TFIIH (lanes 1-13). Recruitment of XPA, RPA, and XPG to the XPC/HR23B-TFIIH-damaged DNA complex is depicted (lanes 14-19); the addition of XPF/ERCC1 to ROS is shown (lanes 20-21). C, RPA does not modify the KMnO4 footprinting of the undamaged strand already targeted by XPC/HR23B and TFIIH.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6559-6573Google Scholar). We first observed that ATP does not modify the XPC/HR23B footprinting pattern of the damaged DNA (Fig. 3B, lanes 2 and 3). The addition of TFIIH in the absence of ATP did not allow modification of the XPC/HR23B-induced DNA footprint (Fig. 3B, lanes 3 and 7). In the presence of ATP, TFIIH opens the DNA according to the typical footprinting pattern in which permanganate breaks are found at both positions T-5 and C-6 and near the damage (Fig. 3B, lanes 4-6). The footprinting pattern induced by XPC/HR23B and TFIIH is even increased in the presence of XPA at positions T0, G-1, C-3, T-5, and C-6, and additional bands appeared at positions T-8 and T-10 (Fig. 3B, lanes 8-11). The addition of either RPA or XPG in the absence of XPA only slightly modified the opening profile around the damage and at positions T-5 and C-6 (lanes 15-16). Even if all of the factors are present, the addition of ATP is indispensable for dual incision (e.g. complete ROS) (Fig. 3B, lanes 12 and 13). The addition of RPA to a reaction containing XPC, TFIIH, and XPA did not modify the footprinting pattern of the damaged strand (lanes 14 and 17), whereas the addition of XPG increased the KMnO4 sensitivity pattern detected in the presence of XPA. Indeed, scanned T-5 and C-6 bands are increased 2.5-3-fold (Fig. 3B, lanes 14 and 18). When the double combination RPA+XPG is tested, we observed a slight increase at positions T-5 and C-6 (Fig. 3B, lanes 15, 16, and 19). Although RPA was shown to crosslink damaged DNA (37Schweizer U.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the underlying mechanism of the action of bacterial cupredoxin azurin in the regression of breast cancer and its potential chemotherapeutic efficacy. Azurin enters into the cytosol of MCF-7 cells and travels to the nucleus, enhancing the intracellular levels of p53 and Bax, thereby triggering the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c into the cytosol. This process activates the caspase cascade (including caspase-9 and caspase-7), thereby initiating the apoptotic process. Our results indicate that azurin-induced cell death stimuli are amplified in the presence of p53. In vivo injection of azurin in immunodeficient mice harboring xenografted human breast cancer cells in the mammary fat pad leads to statistically significant regression (85%, P = 0.0179, Kruskal-Wallis Test) of the tumor. In conclusion, azurin blocks breast cancer cell proliferation and induces apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway both in vitro and in vivo, thereby suggesting a potential chemotherapeutic application of this bacterial cupredoxin for the treatment of breast cancer."

In the present study, we report that cytoplasmic calcium elevation can regulate the membrane potential by a novel mechanism. TRESK, a recently described member of the two-pore domain potassium (2PK+) channel family, was activated 5–15-fold after stimulation of various Ca2+-mobilizing receptors in Xenopus oocytes. Extracellular application of ionomycin, as well as the microinjection of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate or calcium, also evoked TRESK activation, whereas microinjection of EGTA or pretreatment of the oocytes with thapsigargin prevented the receptor-mediated effect. These data indicate that TRESK is activated by increased cytoplasmic calcium concentration. However, application of Ca2+ to inside-out membrane patches failed to influence TRESK single channel activity, suggesting that cytoplasmic factors are also required for the regulation. Cyclosporin A and FK506, specific inhibitors of the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase (calcineurin), completely eliminated TRESK activation. Coexpression of a constitutively active form of calcineurin with TRESK increased the basal background K+ current and attenuated the response of the channel to the calcium signal, indicating that TRESK was activated by the permanent calcineurin activity. Serine 276 was identified as the major functional target of calcineurin in TRESK by alanine-scanning mutagenesis. This is the first example of calcineurin being involved in the regulation of a two-pore domain K+ channel, and thus, TRESK channels may regulate the excitability of neurons and other cell types in response to Ca2+-mobilizing hormones and neurotransmitters in a manner that is sensitive to immunosuppressive drugs.

Background (leak) K+ channels drive the membrane potential incessantly toward the K+ equilibrium potential, stabilize the negative resting membrane potential of nonexcitable cells, and counterbalance the excitability and adjust the firing rate of neurons.

Two-pore domain K+ channels are classified as a family based on their similar molecular architecture in addition to amino acid sequence similarity. Each subunit contains four transmembrane segments and two poreforming domains, one located between the first and second and another between the third and fourth transmembrane segments. (This topology assumes that both the N and C termini of the subunits are intracellular.)

Cell Physiol. 2001; 281: C700-C708Google Scholar)) were reported to regulate different 2PK+ channels. Considering the robust expression of 2PK+ channels in many cell types, the above regulatory mechanisms have major impact on the control of membrane potential and cellular function. Recently, cloning of a novel member of the 2PK+ channel family, human TRESK (TWIK-related spinal cord K+ channel) was reported (17Sano Y. Inamura K. Miyake A. Mochizuki S. Kitada C. Yokoi H. Nozawa K. Okada H. Matsushime H. Furuichi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27406-27412Google Scholar). TRESK shows limited (<34%) amino acid sequence similarity to other 2PK+ channels; accordingly, it belongs to a novel 2PK+ channel subfamily. Expression of TRESK in L929 cells resulted in a slightly outwardly rectifying background potassium current, which was inhibited by unsaturated free fatty acids (arachidonic, docosahexaenoic, and linoleic acid), some nonspecific K+ channel blockers (quinine, quinidine, triethanolamine, and glyburide), and extreme acidification (40% inhibition by pH 5.6) (17Sano Y. Inamura K. Miyake A. Mochizuki S. Kitada C. Yokoi H. Nozawa K. Okada H. Matsushime H. Furuichi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27406-27412Google Scholar). In the present study, we report that TRESK is a target of receptor-mediated regulation. We have cloned the TRESK channel from another species and tissue (mouse cerebellum) and demonstrate its mRNA expression also in the testis. Therefore, the expression pattern of TRESK seems to be more extensive than originally suggested (also by the denomination of the channel). Here, we show that the stimulation of various Ca2+-mobilizing receptors substantially activates the K+ current when mouse (or human) TRESK is expressed in Xenopus oocytes. We also demonstrate that this receptor-mediated activation is dependent on the cytoplasmic Ca2+ signal, and the rise of [Ca2+] is sufficient for TRESK activation regardless of the source of the ion. Thus, TRESK is the first 2PK+ channel reported to be regulated by cytoplasmic Ca2+. Unlike the classical Ca2+-activated K+ channels (having six transmembrane segments), TRESK activation by Ca2+ does not involve the binding of the ion directly to the channel protein, but it is prevented by the inhibition of the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase, calcineurin. Consequently, TRESK may hyperpolarize the membrane potential in response to different stimuli increasing the cytoplasmic calcium concentration, depending on the signal transduction system of the given cell in the spinal cord and also in other tissues. Also, this regulatory mechanism may be considered as a means by which neuronal excitability is affected by immunosuppressive drugs of the calcineurin inhibitor class. Materials—Enzymes and kits of molecular biology applications were purchased from Ambion (Austin, TX), Amersham Biosciences, Fermentas (Vilnius, Lithuania), New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA), Promega (Madison, WI), and Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). All other chemicals of analytical grade were obtained from Calbiochem, Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland), Promega, and Sigma. Lysophosphatidic acid and cyclosporin A were dissolved in ethanol (0.5 mg/ml and 0.5 mm, respectively), and FK506 was dissolved in Me2SO (2 mm). Cloning of Human and Mouse TRESK—A novel K+ channel pore domain was found in the human genome data base with a computer program developed in our laboratory (source code available upon request). The conceptual coding region of the new channel was calculated from the neighboring genomic sequences by the FGENESH program at the Softberry site on the World Wide Web. Since no expressed sequence tag information was available, the three human exons were PCR-amplified one by one from genomic DNA and assembled (primer sequences and PCR conditions not shown). This resulted in a functional 2PK+ channel having essentially the same properties as its mouse counterpart described extensively in this paper (data not shown). The sequence of our exon-concatenated human 2PK+ channel is identical to the recently reported sequence of human TRESK (17Sano Y. Inamura K. Miyake A. Mochizuki S. Kitada C. Yokoi H. Nozawa K. Okada H. Matsushime H. Furuichi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27406-27412Google Scholar). Since the exon boundaries of our artificially constructed human 2PK+ channel were only probable at the time of its cloning, we cloned TRESK also from a natural source, mouse cerebellar RNA, by RT-PCR. Total RNA was extracted from different mouse tissues as previously described (18Horváth A. Szabadkai G. Várnai P. Arányi T. Wollheim C.B. Spät A. Enyedi P. Cell Calcium. 1998; 23: 33-42Google Scholar). The complete coding region of mouse TRESK was PCR-amplified with -8s (5′-ATCgaattcCAAGAGGATGGAGGCTGAGG-3′) and 1185a (5′-GCGctcgagTTACCAAGGTAGCGAAACTTCCCTTTG-3′) primers (designed on the basis of mouse genomic sequences) from cerebellar RNA after reverse transcription with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase enzyme (Promega, Madison, WI). Taking advantage of the EcoRI and XhoI sites (marked with lowercase letters) of the -8s and 1185a primers, respectively, the TRESK coding region was ligated into pEXO vector. The sequence of TRESK was determined by automatic sequencing. The PCR-derived original clone contained two mutations: a silent one, which was not corrected, and another, which was corrected with QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and the final clone was resequenced. Since the correcting primers (not shown) were designed to contain two further silent mutations (thus creating an easily detectable Bsp119I site), there were three silent mutations (C42T, T720C, and G723A) in our final construct, not affecting the amino acid sequence of mouse TRESK. Localizing TRESK with RT-PCR—Tissue localization of TRESK was determined by RT-PCR from different mouse RNAs, with -172s (5′-AGCCAAACATGATGGGTTCC-3′, annealing to the 5′-untranslated region of TRESK) and 453a (5′-TCCAAAGAGCGCATACAGC-3′) primers. (The PCR protocol was as follows: 15-min initial denaturation and Hot Star Taq (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) activation at 94 °C; 40 cycles of 60-s denaturation at 94 °C, 60-s annealing, 90-s extension at 72 °C); and a final 6-min extension at 72 °C. The annealing temperature was 64, 62, and 60 °C in the first five, second five, and final 30 cycles, respectively.) The control 532-bp glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase PCR product was amplified for 30 cycles with sense (5′-TGGGTGGAGCCAAACGGGTC-3′) and antisense (5′-GGAGTTGCTGTTGAAGTCGCA-3′) primers. Subcloning of the Calcineurin Subunits—The wild type and constitutively active calcineurin A coding regions were amplified by Pfu polymerase from pBJ5-CnA-FL, applying the sense primer (5′-CAGgaattCTGGAGATGTCCGAGCCCAAGGCGATTG-3′), and antisense primers (5′-GCGctcgagCAATCCCATCATGCCCTGCAGCTCAA-3′) and (5′-GCGctcgagCTATTTCCCGCCAGAGAGCAC-3′), respectively. The two PCR products were ligated between the EcoRI and XhoI sites of pEXO, taking advantage of the restriction enzyme sites incorporated into the primers (indicated by lowercase letters). The calcineurin B coding region was amplified from pBJ5-CnB with the primers (5′-CAGGAATTCGAGCAAAATGGGAAATGAGGCAAG-3′) and (5′-GCGctcgagTCACACATCTACCACCATC-3′). The product was digested with XhoI and cloned into pEXO digested with EcoRI, treated with Klenow polymerase, and digested with XhoI. In Vitro Site-directed Mutagenesis—In vitro site-directed mutagenesis was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Complementary primer pairs were designed, coding for the desired mutation together with discriminating silent mutations (introducing or eliminating restriction enzyme sites). The primer sequences of the sense oligonucleotides in the 5′ to 3′ direction were the following: S192A, CTTCAAATGGCGAGCTCTCCCGCTCTGC; S264A, GAGAGGAGCAACGCGTGTCCCGAGCTG; S175A, AGGGCTTACGCTCGATTCCAGGCTCTCCTTTG; S227A/S232A/S234A, AACCCGCAGCCGGCCAAGGACCCCCCCGCTCCGGCATGCAATGTGGAGCTG; T256A/S262A, CTACAACCACCCGCGCGTCCCGTGGAGAGGGCCAACTCCTGTCCCGAG; S274A/S276A/S279A, CTGGGGCGACTGGCATGCGCTATTCTCGCGAATCTGGATGAAGTGG; S274A, GCTGGGGCGACTGGCATGCTCTATTCTCAGCAATC; S276A, GGCGACTGTCCTGTGCGATTCTCAGCAATCTGG; S279A, CCTGTTCTATTCTCGCGAATCTGGATGAAGTGG; S264E, GAGAGGAGCAACGAATGCCCCGAGCTGGTGCTGG; S274E, GTGCTGGGGCGACTCGAGTGTTCTATTCTCAGCAATC; S276E, GGCGACTGTCCTGTGAGATTCTCAGCAATCTGG. The S391A mutant of TRESK was amplified by PCR with the -8s (see above) sense and (5′-GAGCTCGAGTTACCATGGTAGTGCAACTTCCCTTTG-3′) antisense primers. The mutant clones were identified by restriction enzyme mapping and automatic sequencing. Synthesis of Ion Channel, Receptor, and Calcineurin cRNA—The cRNAs coding for TRESK, the different receptors and calcineurin subunits were synthesized using the Ambion mMESSAGE mMACHINE™ T7 in vitro transcription kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). The template for the wild type or mutant TRESK ion channel cRNAs was the XbaI-linearized pEXO-TRESK or its mutant counterparts, respectively. AT1a angiotensin (19Murphy T.J. Alexander R.W.

Cell. 1993; 75: 1145-1156Google Scholar), and M2 muscarinic (21Bonner T.I. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. (suppl.). 1989; : 11-15Google Scholar) receptor cRNAs were synthesized as previously described (16Czirják G. Petheő G.L. Spät A. Enyedi P. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2001; 281: C700-C708Google Scholar). Animals, Tissue Preparation, and Xenopus laevis Oocyte Injection— Oocytes were prepared as previously described (22Czirják G. Enyedi P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5426-5432Google Scholar). Oocytes were injected with 50 nl of the appropriate cRNA solution 1 day after defolliculation. Electrophysiological experiments were performed 3 or 4 days after the injection. The tissues for RNA preparation derived from NMRI strain of Mus musculus (Toxicop). All treatments of the animals were conducted in accordance with state laws and institutional regulations. The experiments were approved by the Animal Care and Ethics Committee of Semmelweis University. Two-electrode Voltage Clamp Measurements—Whole oocyte currents were recorded by two-electrode voltage clamp (OC-725-C; Warner Instrument Corp., Hamden, CT) using microelectrodes made of borosilicate glass (Clark Electromedical Instruments, Pangbourne, UK) with a resistance of 0.3–1 megaohms when filled with 3 m KCl. Currents were filtered at 1 kHz and digitally sampled at 1–2.5 kHz with a Digidata Interface (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Recording and data analysis were performed using pCLAMP software version 6.0.4 (Axon Instruments). Experiments were carried out at room temperature. Different solutions were applied by a gravity-driven perfusion system. Low [K+] solution contained 95.4 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.5 with NaOH). High [K+] solution contained 80 mm K+ (78 mm Na+ of the low [K+] solution was replaced with K+). The volume of microinjections was 50 nl, and the pH of Ca2+ + EGTA + HEPES, EGTA + HEPES, and HEPES solutions was adjusted to 7.3 with KOH. The injected 50-nl volume was diluted to ∼10-fold in the cytoplasm of the oocyte. The steady state free [Ca2+] was calculated to fall from the original 30 μm (in 5 mm total [Ca2+] plus 5 mm [EGTA]) to about 100 nm during the reduction of the total [Ca2+] from 5 to 2 mm. (At 4.9 and 4.1 mm total [Ca2+], the free [Ca2+] was <10 μm and <1 μm in this calculation, respectively.) Background K+ currents were measured in high EC [K+] at the end of 300-ms-long voltage steps to -100 mV applied every 3 s. The holding potential was 0 mV. For estimating the amplitude of the background K+ current, the inward current in high [K+] was corrected for the small nonspecific leak measured in 2 mm EC [K+] at -100 mV. Single Channel Recordings—Single channel recordings were performed with an Axopatch 1D amplifier (Axon Instruments) using microelectrodes made of borosilicate glass (Clark Electromedical Instruments) with resistance of 30–80 megaohms when coated with R-6101 elastomer (Dow Corning, Midland, MI), fire-polished and filled with pipette solution, containing 140 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 4 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4 with NaOH). Bath solutions contained 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.3 with NaOH) plus 140 mm KCl in high or 4 mm KCl, 136 mm NaCl in low [K+] solution. Experiments were performed at room temperature after oocytes were devitellinized manually in a hyperosmotic solution, containing 200 mm dl-aspartic acid, 20 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4 with KOH). For low noise recordings, seal resistance was above 40 gigaohms. The cut-off frequency of the eight-pole Bessel filter was adjusted to 2 kHz, and data were acquired at 10 kHz with Digidata 1200. Recordings shown in Fig. 5 were not filtered further. Statistics and Calculations—Data are expressed as means ± S.E. Statistical significance was estimated by t test for independent samples, and the difference was considered to be significant at p < 0.05. Multiple comparisons (in Figs. 7 and 8) were performed by the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance. The subsequent planned pairwise comparisons of the groups were performed with the nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test, and the difference was considered to be significant at p < 0.05/k (according to the Bonferroni adjustment), where k was the number of the pairwise comparisons. The Statistica 6.0 program package (StatSoft, Tulsa, OK) was used for the analysis. Single channel current histograms were fitted to the sum of n + 1 normal (Gauss) distributions, y=Σ(ai/(wi×π/2)×exp(-2×((x-qi)/wi)2)), where i runs from 1 to n + 1 (n is the maximum number of simultaneously open channels), ai is the amplitude, wi is width, and qi is the position of the peak along the abscissa.Fig. 8Basal currents of TRESK mutants and their responses to the Ca2+ signal. A, the oocytes, coexpressing wild type TRESK (wt) or one of the mutant versions of the channel (as indicated below the columns) with M1 muscarinic receptor, were stimulated with carbachol (1 μm). The current emerging after the stimulation was normalized to the value measured before the application of carbachol in each oocyte. B, basal background K+ currents were measured in oocytes expressing TRESK (wild type) or one of the different mutant versions of the channel. The currents of mutant TRESK channels were normalized to the average of the control (wild type) group of the same oocyte preparation. C, the response of the same mutants as in B to ionomycin was measured and represented in the same way as in Fig. 7B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) TRESK Is Expressed in the Central Nervous System and Also at the Periphery—The coding regions of mouse and human TRESK were cloned from human genomic DNA and mouse cerebellar mRNA, respectively (see “Experimental Procedures”). Mouse TRESK is composed of 394 amino acid residues (10 residues longer than the human channel), and its amino acid sequence is 67% identical to its human counterpart. The mouse TRESK gene is located on chromosome 19 in the 19D3 region. The BAC clone, RP-292H20 (AC139040), includes the whole coding sequence between 168,324 and 152,449 bp in the negative strand (three exons of 256, 129, and 800 bp interspersed by two introns of 5421 and 9270 bp, respectively). The sequence of mouse TRESK cDNA was deposited to GenBank™ (accession number AY325301). The expression of TRESK mRNA was examined in different mouse tissues by RT-PCR. The specificity of the PCR product was verified by restriction enzyme mapping (not shown). The specific 626-bp product was amplified from cerebrum, cerebellum, brainstem, spinal cord, and testis (Fig. 1). TRESK Is Activated by the Stimulation of Calcium-mobilizing Receptors—TRESK current was measured in 80 mm extracellular K+ concentration at -100 mV with a two-electrode voltage clamp. (The [K+] was occasionally reduced to 2 mm to verify that the charge carrier was K+.) Microinjection of the in vitro synthesized mouse TRESK cRNA induced the expression of a noninactivating, background K+ current in X. laevis oocytes, not present in noninjected or water-injected cells. In oocytes coexpressing M1 muscarinic receptor with TRESK, stimulation with carbachol (1 μm) evoked substantial K+ current activation (10.4 ± 1.4-fold, n = 5). The effect was slowly reversible (>20 min) after the withdrawal of the stimulus and was reproducible (see Fig. 2 for a representative curve). Stimulation with angiotensin II (10 nm) also activated TRESK in oocytes coexpressing another Ca2+-mobilizing receptor, AT1a angiotensin receptor, with the channel (13.3 ± 1.9-fold activation, n = 5). Since the stimulation of overexpressed receptors may generate nonphysiologically robust signals, we also examined an endogenous Ca2+-mobilizing receptor of the oocyte. Stimulation of the lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) receptor with 0.5 μm LPA in oocytes expressing only TRESK also activated the K+ current strongly (7.6 ± 2.5-fold, n = 6). In contrast to these three different Ca2+-mobilizing receptor types, stimulation of the heterologously expressed M2 muscarinic receptor (activating Gi protein instead of Gq) failed to activate TRESK (data not shown). Since the stimulation of the different receptors evoked the same effects on human TRESK (not shown), activation of TRESK turned out to be specific for Ca2+-mobilizing receptors. The Cytoplasmic Ca2+ Signal Is Necessary and Sufficient for TRESK Activation—Stimulation of Ca2+-mobilizing receptors releases Ca2+ from intracellular stores through the formation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3). Therefore, we have examined the effect of InsP3 microinjection (10 ng) on TRESK current. InsP3 (but not water) microinjection activated TRESK 12.2 ± 1.3-fold (n = 5; Fig. 3A), suggesting that InsP3 was involved in the receptor-mediated TRESK activation. The calcium ionophore, ionomycin, evokes a receptor-independent increase of the cytoplasmic [Ca2+]. Ionomycin (0.5 μm) activated TRESK current 6.2 ± 0.4-fold (n = 57; Fig. 3B). Inhibition of the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase by Tg pretreatment (1 μm, 5–6 h) and the following depletion of the intracellular Ca2+ store prevented the LPA-mediated TRESK activation. (In the Tg- and Me2SO-treated (control) groups, TRESK was activated 1.2 ± 0.1- and 2.8 ± 0.4-fold by 0.5 μm LPA in 75 s, respectively (n = 5, p < 0.003). The currents after the Tg and Me2SO pretreatment (before the stimulation with LPA) were not significantly different (11.5 ± 5.8 and 15.5 ± 4.4 μA, respectively). The efficiency of thapsigargin and ionomycin suggested that the elevation of cytoplasmic [Ca2+] is required and sufficient for the regulation of TRESK irrespective of the other branches of the divergent signaling pathways activated by Ca2+-mobilizing receptors. Next we designed an experiment to verify that the exogenously added Ca2+ can also activate TRESK. Since TRESK activation could not be reliably evoked by the microinjection of solutions containing millimolar free [Ca2+] (probably as a consequence of the high Ca2+-buffering capacity and the low diffusion length of Ca2+ in the cytoplasm), a highly Ca2+-saturated Ca2+ buffer was injected (Ca2+, EGTA, HEPES, 50 mm each). The microinjection of this solution activated TRESK to a similarly high extent as receptor stimulation (8.4 ± 1.3-fold in 5 min) (Fig. 4). If the injected solution contained only EGTA and HEPES (both 50 mm) and thus the cytoplasmic [Ca2+] was buffered to low levels, TRESK current was not affected by the injection (1.2 ± 0.1-fold increase in 5 min), and the subsequent stimulation of the coexpressed M1 receptor also failed to activate TRESK (1.2 ± 0.1-fold further increase). This lack of activation by receptor stimulation was not the consequence of the nonspecific effects of microinjection, since the control oocytes injected only with HEPES (50 mm) responded to carbachol stimulation (7.3 ± 0.9-fold activation compared with the 0 min value) (Fig. 4). Thus, TRESK was activated by cytoplasmic calcium irrespective of the source of the ion, and buffering cytoplasmic calcium concentration to low levels prevented the receptor-mediated TRESK activation. These experiments indicate unequivocally that calcium is the key to TRESK activation. The Ca2+-dependent Activation Is Not Mediated by the Binding of Ca2+ to TRESK Channel—The slow reversibility of the whole oocyte TRESK current after the withdrawal of the receptor stimulation suggested that TRESK is not regulated by direct Ca2+ binding. To confirm this conclusion, the straight-forward experiment was to apply Ca2+ to the intracellular side of inside-out membrane patches. Therefore, we investigated the single channel properties of TRESK in excised membrane patches of Xenopus oocytes in the inside-out configuration. In oocytes expressing TRESK, a characteristic single channel activity appeared, which was not observed in control cells (Fig. 5, A and B). In symmetrical 140 mm K+, this activity consisted of both outward and inward currents of single channel openings at depolarized and hyperpolarized membrane potentials, respectively (Fig. 5A, left panel). When [K+] was reduced to 4 mm on the accessible intracellular side, outward currents were diminished, whereas the inward currents of openings were not drastically influenced as is expected for a K+ channel (Fig. 5A, right panel). TRESK exhibited an interesting asymmetrical single channel activity also in symmetrical 140 mm K+. TRESK demonstrated well defined, square wave-like openings at depolarized potentials, but in the case of hyperpolarization it produced bursts of very short openings (<1–2 ms), which could not be resolved as square waves of constant size by our recording apparatus (Fig. 5B). Thus, the single channel conductance of TRESK was determined from the outward current of openings in symmetrical 140 mm K+ (13 ± 1 picosiemens, n = 4) (Fig. 5C). High concentration of calcium (10 μm), which activated TRESK severalfold in the whole oocyte microinjection experiments, failed to alter TRESK single channel activity significantly in three examined inside-out patches (for representation, see Fig. 5, D and E). This result indicates that TRESK is not regulated by direct Ca2+ binding; rather, a more complex cytoplasmic signaling mechanism is involved in the regulation. Pharmacological Inhibition of Calcineurin Eliminates TRESK Activation—In order to gain further insight into the mechanism of TRESK activation, the effect of cyclosporin A (CsA), the specific inhibitor of calcineurin (Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase, protein phosphatase 2B) was examined. CsA pretreatment (100 nm, 2–3.5 h) did not change base-line TRESK current (3.3 ± 1.3 μA in the CsA-pretreated (n = 5) and 2.6 ± 0.7 μA in the control group (n = 7)). However, this low concentration of CsA"

Merlin is highly homologous to the ERM (ezrin-radixin-moesin) family of membrane/cytoskeleton linker proteins. However, the mechanism for the tumor suppressing activity of merlin is not well understood. Previously, we characterized a novel role for merlin as a protein kinase A (PKA)-anchoring protein, which links merlin to the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway. In this study we show that merlin is also a target for PKA-induced phosphorylation. In vitro [γ-33P]ATP labeling revealed that both the merlin N and C termini are phosphorylated by PKA. Furthermore, both in vitro and in vivo phosphorylation studies of the wild-type and mutated C termini demonstrated that PKA can phosphorylate merlin at serine 518, a site that is phosphorylated also by p21-activated kinases (PAKs). Merlin was phosphorylated by PKA in cells in which PAK activity was suppressed, indicating that the two kinases function independently. Both in vitro and in vivo interaction studies indicated that phosphorylation of serine 518 promotes heterodimerization between merlin and ezrin, an event suggested to convert merlin from a growth-suppressive to a growth-permissive state. This study provides further evidence on the connection between merlin and cAMP/PKA signaling and suggests a role for merlin in the cAMP/PKA transduction pathway.

Inactivation of the neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) tumor suppressor gene leads to development of multiple benign tumors of the nervous system, in particular schwannomas and meningiomas. The NF2 gene encodes for merlin (schwannomin), which exists as two major isoforms. The 595-residue isoform 1 and the 590-residue isoform 2 result from alternative splicing of the last two exons and differ in their C-terminal sequences and, apparently, in their tumor suppressor activity. It has been suggested that isoform 1 is the tumor-suppressive form of merlin (1Sherman L. Xu H.-M. Geist R.T. Saporito-Irwin S. Howells N. Ponta H. Herrlich P. Gutmann D.H. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2505-2509Google Scholar).

They are members of the band 4.1 superfamily based on the presence of a shared FERM domain in the N terminus. In cells, ERM proteins provide a regulated link between plasma membrane proteins and the cortical cytoskeleton, and they also participate in signal transduction pathways. Like the ERM proteins, merlin can be divided into three apparent structural domains: the globular N-terminal FERM domain, an extended α-helical region, and a short C-terminal domain. Both inter- and intramolecular associations can regulate the functions of merlin and its interactions with other proteins (4Gonzalez-Agosti C. Wiederhold T. Herndon M.E. Gusella J. Ramesh V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34438-34442Google Scholar, 5Grönholm M. Sainio M. Zhao F. Heiska L. Vaheri A. Carpén O. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 895-904Google Scholar, 6Nguyen R. Reczek D. Bretcher A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7621-7629Google Scholar). ERM proteins are negatively regulated by an intramolecular association between the N- and C-terminal domains, and changes in the conformation are needed to “open” or “activate” the molecules for interaction with other proteins. Recent data provide evidence that both phosphorylation of a conserved threonine residue (Thr-567 in ezrin, Thr-564 in radixin, Thr-558 in moesin) in the C terminus and binding of phospholipids regulate the activity of the ERM proteins (7Bretcher A. Edwards K. Fehon R.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 586-599Google Scholar). Rho kinase (8Matsui T. Maeda M. Doi Y. Yonemura S. Amano M. Kaibuchi K. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2723-2741Google Scholar) can phosphorylate this conserved threonine residue. Merlin has been shown to be phosphorylated on both serine and threonine residues, and the phosphorylation status of merlin varies in response to growth conditions (11Shaw R.J. McClatchey A.I. Jacks T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7757-7764Google Scholar). At low cell density merlin is phosphorylated, whereas high cell density, serum starvation, or loss of adhesion results in dephosphorylation of merlin. Furthermore, phosphorylation of merlin is induced by activated forms of Rac and Cdc42 but not by activated Rho. These findings link merlin to Rac/Cdc42-dependent signaling (12Shaw R.J. Paez J.G. Curto M. Yaktine A. Pruitt W.M. Saotome I. O′Bryan J.P. Gupta V. Ratner N. Der C.J. Jacks T. McClatchey A.I. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 63-72Google Scholar). The site for the Rac-induced phosphorylation was determined to be the serine 518 residue in the C terminus of merlin (12Shaw R.J. Paez J.G. Curto M. Yaktine A. Pruitt W.M. Saotome I. O′Bryan J.P. Gupta V. Ratner N. Der C.J. Jacks T. McClatchey A.I. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 63-72Google Scholar). Serine 518 is phosphorylated by p21-activated kinases (PAKs) (13Kissil J.L. Johnson K.C. Eckman M.S. Jacks T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10394-10399Google Scholar, 14Xiao G.-H. Beeser A. Chernoff J. Testa J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 883-886Google Scholar), which are common downstream targets of both Rac and Cdc42. Moreover, a recent study shows that merlin interacts directly with the Cdc42/Rac binding domain of PAK1 and inhibits PAK1 activity (15Kissil J.L. Wilker E.W. Johnson K.C. Eckman M.S. Yaffe M.B. Jacks T. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 841-849Google Scholar). The data suggest that merlin both is regulated by Rac/Cdc42 signaling pathway and can serve as a negative regulator of this pathway. Cyclic AMP (cAMP) regulates a number of key cellular processes such as cell growth and differentiation, gene transcription, and ion channel conductivity. This second messenger mediates most of its cellular effects by activating the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA). In neural systems cAMP/PKA signaling represents an important pathway for gene expression, synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory (16Brandon E.P. Idzerda R.L. McKnight G.S. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 397-403Google Scholar, 17Albright T.D. Kandel E.R. Posner M.I. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 612-624Google Scholar). In Schwann cells activation of the cAMP/PKA pathway promotes cell growth and cell cycle progression (18Kim H.A. DeClue J.E. Ratner N. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 49: 236-247Google Scholar), and cAMP/PKA is also required for myelin formation (19Howe D.G. McCarthy K.D. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 3513-3521Google Scholar). PKA has a number of physiological substrates, and, recently, ezrin also has been reported to be phosphorylated by PKA (20Zhou R. Cao X. Watson C. Miao Y. Guo Z. Forte J.G. Yao X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35651-35659Google Scholar). Because PKA is involved in a number of parallel signaling cascades, proper localization and timing are prerequisites for an efficient substrate selection and catalytic activation. The intracellular targeting and compartmentalization of PKA is achieved through association with protein kinase A-anchoring proteins (AKAPs) (21Colledge M. Scott J.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 216-221Google Scholar, 22Edwards A.S. Scott J.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 217-221Google Scholar, 23Feliciello A. Gottesman M.E. Avvedimento E.V. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 99-114Google Scholar). We have recently shown that merlin binds to a regulatory subunit (RIβ) of PKA and may function as an AKAP for RIβ-containing PKA both in the central nervous system and in cultured neuronal cells (24Grönholm M. Vossebein L. Carlson C.R. Kuja-Panula J. Teesalu T. Alfthan K. Vaheri A. Rauvala H. Herberg F.W. Taskén K. Carpén O. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41167-41172Google Scholar). Here, we provide evidence that merlin is also a substrate for PKA in vitro and in vivo. The site of PKA-induced phosphorylation was determined to be serine at position 518. Furthermore, our results show that phosphorylation of the serine 518 of merlin promotes interaction between merlin and ezrin both in vitro and in vivo. Plasmids—The human merlin isoform 1 cDNA in pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) has been described earlier (25Sainio M. Zhao F. Heiska L. Turunen O. den Bakker M. Zwarthoff E. Lutchman M. Rouleau G.A. Jääskeläinen J. Vaheri A. Carpén O. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2249-2260Google Scholar). The plasmid encoding the catalytic subunit (C) of human PKA (PKAc) (26Taskén K. Andersson K.B. Erikstein B.K. Hansson V. Jahnsen T. Blomhoff H.K. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 2109-2119Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. Kjetil Taskén (University of Oslo, Norway). The constitutively active PAK2 construct containing the T402E mutation was cloned into the pEBB-ME vector, which is the pEF-BOS vector (27Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 185322Google Scholar) containing an extended polylinker and a C-terminal Myc-His6-HA tag. A PAK2 N-terminal domain (aa 1–248) construct with a CRIB-motif mutation (H82L,H85L) was cloned in the same pEBB vector with a C-terminal Myc-His6 tag. The recombinant GST-merlin N terminus (aa 1–314), α-helical domain (aa 314–477), and C terminus (aa 492–595) were obtained by PCR amplification and subcloned into the EcoRI site of the pGEX4TI vector (Amersham Biosciences). T576A and S518A mutations of merlin in pcDNA3 and the GST fusion proteins in pGEX4TI were made by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The recombinant GST-ezrin C terminus (aa 477–585) has been described (28Turunen O. Wahlström T. Vaheri A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1445-1453Google Scholar), and the plasmid encoding the vesicular stomatitis glycoprotein (VSVG)-tagged N-domain of ezrin (aa 1–309) (29Algrain M. Turunen O. Vaheri A. Louvard D. Arpin M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 129-139Google Scholar) was a kind gift of Dr. Monique Arpin (Institut Curie, Paris, France). Antibodies—KF10 mAb, kindly provided by Dr. E. Zwarthoff (Erasmus University, Rotterdam, the Netherlands) (30den Bakker M.A. Tascilar M. Riegman P.H. Hekman A.C. Boersma W. Janssen P.J. de Jong T.A. Hendriks W. van der Kwast T.H. Zwarthoff E.C.

Eckman M.S. Jacks T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10394-10399Google Scholar), kindly provided by Dr. J. Kissil (Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA), was used to detect merlin phosphorylated at serine 518. PKAc mAb (BD Biosciences) was used to detect the catalytic subunit of PKA, and Myc mAb (clone 9E10, Covance Research Products, Inc., Princeton, NJ) was used to recognize both the constitutively active PAK2 (T402E) and the N-terminal domain of PAK2 (aa 1–248/H82L,H85L). 3C12 mAb (31Böhling T.

The Ez9 antibody was raised in rabbits immunized with full-length ezrin, produced as a GST fusion in Escherichia coli, followed by cleavage of the GST part by thrombin (Amersham Biosciences). VSVG mAb (clone P5D4, Roche Diagnostics) was used to recognize the N-terminal domain of ezrin, and X63 mAb (ATCC, Manassas, VA) was used as a control. Transfections and Immunoblotting—HEK293 cells grown in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal calf serum were transfected using Fu-GENE transfection reagent (Hoffmann-La Roche). After 48 h the cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 400 μl of lysis buffer 1 (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm NaPPi, 1.5 μm okadaic acid, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and protease inhibitors). For H89 treatment, cells were incubated with 20 μm H89 (Sigma) for 5 h before lysis. Lysed cells were scraped from the plates and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Total protein concentration of the supernatants was determined by Bio-Rad Protein Assay (Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of proteins were run in 8% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose filters, and analyzed by immunoblotting. Bound proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL). Immunoprecipitation and Phosphatase Treatment—For immunoprecipitation of merlin, HEK293 cells cotransfected with merlin and PKAc were lysed, the lysate was centrifuged as described above, and the supernatant was incubated with merlin sc-331 antiserum overnight at 4 °C. Antibody-bound merlin was precipitated with protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 4 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed three times with 400 μl of phosphate-buffered saline and two times with 400 μl of calf intestinal phosphatase (CIP) buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and resuspended in 80 μl of the CIP buffer. The immunoprecipitate was divided into two equal aliquots (40 μl), one of which was incubated with buffer alone and the other with 5 units of CIP (Finnzymes Oy, Espoo, Finland) for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 10 μl of 5× Laemmli reducing buffer, and 15 μl of each sample was analyzed by immunoblotting. In Vitro Phosphorylation of Merlin by PKA—GST-fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli and purified according the protocol provided by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). 15 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads carrying ∼4 μg of fusion protein, as judged by Coomassie staining of serially diluted beads, were washed twice in PKA buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4). The phosphorylation reaction was carried out in a 30-μl buffer volume including 10 μCi of [γ-33P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and purified bovine catalytic subunit of PKA (Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by washing the beads quickly in ice-cold PKA buffer and subsequently adding 30 μl of Laemmli reducing buffer. 15 μl of the boiled sample was resolved by 10% or 12% SDS-PAGE. The gel was fixed and stained by Coomassie Blue followed by drying and autoradiography. Stimulation of Endogenous PKA in Attached and Nonattached HEK293 Cells—HEK293 cells were transfected with wild-type merlin in pcDNA3 vector alone or with the PAK2 construct (aa 1–248/H82L,H85L) in pEBB vector. After 24–29 h the cells were first rinsed with serum-free RPM1–1640 and then grown on culture plates overnight in serum-free medium. After serum starvation, forskolin (Sigma) and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX; Sigma) were added to the cells (at 25 and 50 μm, respectively) without or with 20 μm H89 (Sigma), and cells were incubated on the plates for different time periods. Whole cell lysates, prepared by adding 500 μl of 1× Laemmli reducing sample buffer on the plates, were used for immunoblotting. To stimulate endogenous PKA in nonattached cells, merlin-transfected HEK293 cells were serum-starved and grown on culture plates as described above. After overnight serum starvation, cells were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline, detached with trypsin, resuspended into serum-free medium, and collected in a sterile tube. After centrifugation for 5 min at 500 × g, cells were washed twice with serum-free RPMI 1640, resuspended into the same medium, and incubated in tubes with 25 μm forskolin alone or together with 20 μm H89 with gentle rotation for the indicated periods of time. Whole cell lysates of 300 μl were prepared for immunoblotting. In Vitro Interaction between Merlin and Ezrin—Three aliquots of GST-merlin C (aa 492–595) coupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads (5 μg/aliquot) were washed twice in PKA buffer containing phosphatase inhibitors (50 mm NaF and 10 mm NaPPi). Two samples were phosphorylated in vitro in the presence of 200 μm ATP and purified bovine catalytic subunit of PKA for 60 min at 30 °C, and the third sample was incubated only with ATP. The beads were washed once in ice-cold PKA buffer and three times in CIP buffer. One of the phosphorylated samples was treated further with 10 units of CIP for 30 min at 37 °C, whereas the other two samples were incubated in CIP buffer only. Beads were washed once in ice-cold CIP buffer and twice in binding buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl). 50 mm NaF and 10 mm NaPPi were included in all steps (except CIP treatment) preceding the washes of the sample to be dephosphorylated. Beads carrying 5 μg of GST protein or GST-ezrin C (aa 477–585) fusion protein were used as a negative and a positive control for the binding (not shown). HEK293 cells transfected with VSVG-tagged N-terminal ezrin construct were lysed in 750 μl of lysis buffer 2 (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors) and centrifuged at 15 000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. 400 μl of the supernatant diluted 1:1 to the binding buffer was added to each bead aliquot, and the mixture was incubated for 2 h at 25 °C. Beads were washed twice in binding buffer and boiled in 30 μl of Laemmli reducing buffer. 10 μl of each sample was run on 12% SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with anti-VSVG mAb. Another identical immunoblot of the samples was probed with antiserum HM2175 that has been raised against phosphoserine 518 of merlin (13Kissil J.L. Johnson K.C. Eckman M.S. Jacks T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10394-10399Google Scholar). The blot was further stripped and reprobed with KF10 mAb to verify equal amounts of GST-merlin on the beads. Coimmunoprecipitation of Merlin and Ezrin—HEK293 cells expressing endogenous ezrin were transfected with wild-type merlin in pcDNA3 vector. Subconfluent cells were lysed in 500 μl of lysis buffer 1, whereas confluent cells were lysed in the same buffer without phosphatase inhibitors. Lysates were centrifuged at 15.000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was incubated with KF10 mAb, 3C12 mAb, or X63 mAb, together with protein G-Sepharose beads for 4 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed with lysis buffer 1-0.1% Nonidet P-40, and bound proteins were eluted from the beads by boiling in Laemmli nonreducing sample buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting. To study the role of phosphorylation of serine 518 in heterodimerization, subconfluent cells were transfected with wild-type or S518A mutant merlin. Cells were lysed as described above, ezrin was immunoprecipitated, and coprecipitating merlin was analyzed by immunoblotting. In Vivo Phosphorylation of Merlin by PKA—We previously characterized merlin as an AKAP for the RIβ subunit containing PKA (24Grönholm M. Vossebein L. Carlson C.R. Kuja-Panula J. Teesalu T. Alfthan K. Vaheri A. Rauvala H. Herberg F.W. Taskén K. Carpén O. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41167-41172Google Scholar). In this work we studied whether merlin would also serve as a substrate for PKA. To make this assessment, HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with merlin alone or together with human PKAc, and after 48 h, cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting. Merlin migrates mainly as a doublet in HEK293 cells, but cotransfection of PKAc increased the amount of the slower migrating merlin species and induced the appearance of a third, even more slowly migrating band (Fig. 1A). To confirm that these shifts in migration were mediated by PKA, cells cotransfected with merlin and PKAc were treated with H89 before lysis of the cells. H89 is a competitive inhibitor of PKA that binds to the catalytic subunit of PKA (32Chijiwa T. Mishima A. Hagiwara M. Sano M. Hayashi K. Inoue T. Naito K. Toshioka T. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5267-5272Google Scholar) and is a selective although not a specific PKA inhibitor (33Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, treatment of HEK293 cells with H89 resulted in a shift toward faster migrating merlin forms, suggesting that the change in the electrophoretic mobility is PKA-dependent. Interestingly, the band pattern observed here resembled that obtained earlier by Rac/PAK-induced phosphorylation of merlin, where the three bands represent differentially phosphorylated forms of merlin (12Shaw R.J. Paez J.G. Curto M. Yaktine A. Pruitt W.M. Saotome I. O′Bryan J.P. Gupta V. Ratner N. Der C.J. Jacks T. McClatchey A.I. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 63-72Google Scholar, 13Kissil J.L. Johnson K.C. Eckman M.S.

To investigate further the nature of the slower migrating merlin species observed in cotransfections by PKA, HEK293 cells were cotransfected with merlin and PKAc, and the lysate was immunoprecipitated with anti-merlin antibody. Treatment of the immunoprecipitate with CIP eliminated both slower migrating forms of merlin, which demonstrates that they represent phosphorylated forms of merlin (Fig. 1B). We designated the three different merlin species observed here as hypophosphorylated, phosphorylated, and hyperphosphorylated merlin, analogous with the merlin forms observed in Rac/PAK-induced phosphorylation. Serine 518 of Merlin Is a Substrate for PKA—To investigate whether merlin is a direct substrate for PKA, we performed an in vitro phosphorylation reaction on recombinant GST-merlin fusion proteins, which contained the N-terminal FERM domain (aa 1–314), the α-helical domain (aa 314–477), and the C terminus (aa 492–595). Incubation of these fusion proteins with [γ-33P]ATP and bovine catalytic subunit of PKA resulted in incorporation of 33P into both the N and the C termini but not into the α-helical domain or GST (Fig. 2A). Use of human recombinant catalytic subunit instead of that purified from bovine heart gave identical results (data not shown). To identify the substrate residues for PKA in merlin, we analyzed the potential consensus kinase recognition motifs. A recent report demonstrates that gastric ezrin is a substrate for PKA and that serine 66 is phosphorylated by PKA (20Zhou R. Cao X. Watson C. Miao Y. Guo Z. Forte J.G. Yao X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35651-35659Google Scholar). However, this serine is not conserved in merlin. Analysis of the amino acid sequence of merlin suggested five potential PKA phosphorylation sites of which the sequence KRLS518 has the highest prediction to be a consensus phosphorylation site (scansite.mit.edu) (34Shabb J.B. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2381-2411Google Scholar). To test whether the serine 518 is a substrate of PKA we performed in vitro phosphorylation on GST-merlin C-terminal fragments including wild-type and mutant S518A. Threonine 576 in merlin is analogous to the conserved threonine in the ERM proteins, which has been shown to be a target for both Rho kinase- and protein kinase C-induced phosphorylation (8Matsui T. Maeda M. Doi Y. Yonemura S. Amano M. Kaibuchi K. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 647-657Google Scholar, 9Pietromonaco S.F. Simons P.C. Altman A. Elias L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7594-7603Google Scholar, 10Ng T. Parsons M. Hughes W.E. Monypenny J. Zicha D. Gautreau A. Arpin M. Gschmeissner S. Verveer P.J. Bastiaens P.I.H. Parker P.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2723-2741Google Scholar). The sequence KHNT576 was among the predicted sites, although with lower probability than serine 518. Thus, mutant T576A also was included in the phosphorylation assay. Incorporation of 33P was detected in both wild-type merlin and T576A mutant but not in S518A substitution, indicating that serine 518 is a substrate to PKA (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, it has been shown that this residue is also phosphorylated by PAK1 and -2 (13Kissil J.L. Johnson K.C. Eckman M.S. Jacks T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10394-10399Google Scholar, 14Xiao G.-H. Beeser A. Chernoff J. Testa J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 883-886Google Scholar). To verify that serine 518 also is phosphorylated by PKA in vivo, HEK293 cells were transfected with wild-type merlin or the S518A and T576A mutants with or without PKAc. Both wild-type merlin and T576A mutant migrated as doublets when transfected alone, and cotransfection with PKAc resulted in a mobility shift of the merlin bands toward the slower migrating phosphorylated form (Fig. 3). In contrast, conversion of serine 518 to alanine eliminated the slower migrating forms of merlin in control and PKAc expressing cells, and only the hypophosphorylated merlin was detected. These data are consistent with those obtained in the in vitro phosphorylation studies and indicate that serine 518 is the target for PKA-induced phosphorylation in vivo. PAK Activity Is Not Required for PKA-induced Phosphorylation of Merlin—As serine 518 is phosphorylated by both PAK and PKA, we next examined the possibility of a direct functional link between PKA and PAK as reported in other experimental models (35Howe A.K. Juliano R.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 593-600Google Scholar). More specifically, we wanted to test whether PKA-induced phosphorylation of merlin in vivo is mediated by PAK or vice versa. To address this question, we transfected subconfluent HEK293 cells with merlin alone or together with the N-terminal domain of PAK2 (aa 1–248/H82L,H85L). This regulatory domain associates with the C-terminal kinase domain and inhibits the kinase activity of endogenous PAK2 in vivo (data not shown) analogous to the results reported earlier for PAK1 (36Zenke F.T. King C.C. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32565-32573Google Scholar). Because of the sequence homology between the different PAKs, in addition to PAK2 PAK1 activity also is blocked with the PAK2 construct (data not shown). Furthermore, the PAK2 construct contains a mutation in the Rac/Cdc42-binding site (H82L,H85L), which disrupts the interaction of this fragment with the GTPases and thus leaves the GTPase pool in the cell unaffected. Coexpression of merlin and the PAK2 N terminus in HEK293 cells markedly decreased the amount of the slower migrating merlin species, suggesting that endogenous PAK activity was mainly responsible for phosphorylation of merlin in unstimulated sub-confluent HEK293 cells (Fig. 4A). As expected, coexpression of merlin and PKAc in cells resulted in an increase in the amount of both hyperphosphorylated and phosphorylated merlin. Inhibition of endogenous PAK activity did not change the electrophoretic pattern of merlin, indicating that PAK activity is not required for PKA-induced phosphorylation of merlin in vivo (Fig. 4A). To rule out the possibility that PAK-induced phosphorylation of merlin is mediated via activation of PKA, we transfected HEK293 cells with merlin alone or with a constitutively active PAK2 (T402E) mutant. Endogenous PKA activity was then inhibited with H89. As shown in Fig. 4B, inhibition of PKA activity did not alter PAK2-induced phosphorylation of merlin as indicated by the unchanged pattern of merlin species obtained from untreated versus H89-treated cells. This result suggests that PAK phosphorylates merlin in a PKA-independent manner in vivo. Based on these observations we propose that PKA and PAK phosphorylate merlin independently in HEK293 cells.

https://openalex.org/W2115420863,"The mechanism of collagen-induced human platelet activation was examined using Ca2+, Na+, and the pH-sensitive fluorescent dyes calcium green/fura red, sodium-binding benzofuran isophthalate, and 2′,7′-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein. Administration of a moderate dose of collagen (10 μg/ml) to human platelets resulted in an increase in [Ca2+]i and platelet aggregation. The majority of this increase in [Ca2+]i resulted from the influx of calcium from the extracellular milieu via the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) functioning in the reverse mode and was reduced in a dose-dependent manner by the NCX inhibitors 5-(4-chlorobenzyl)-2′,4′-dimethylbenzamil (KD50 = 4.7 ± 1.1 μm) and KB-R7943 (KD50 = 35.1 ± 4.8 μm). Collagen-induced platelet aggregation was dependent on an increase in [Ca2+]i and could be inhibited by chelation of intra- and extracellular calcium through the administration of 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid tetrakis(acetoxymethyl ester) (BAPTA-AM) and EGTA, respectively, or via the administration of BAPTA-AM to platelets suspended in no-Na+/HEPES buffer. Collagen induced an increase in [Na+]i (23.2 ± 7.6 mm) via the actions of thromboxane A2 and, to a lesser extent, of the Na+/H+ exchanger. This study demonstrates that the collagen-induced increase in [Ca2+]i is dependent on the concentration of Na+ in the extracellular milieu, indicating that the collagen-induced increase in [Na+]i causes the reversal of the NCX, ultimately resulting in an increase in [Ca2+]i and platelet aggregation.

Collagen is the most thrombogenic component of the subendothelium (1Baumgartner H.R. Haudenschild C. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1972; 201: 22-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Following vascular damage, collagen is exposed to circulating platelets and both acts as a substrate for the adhesion of platelets (2Cowan D.H. Robertson A.L. Shook P. Giroski P. Br. J.

Pharmacol. 1995; 115: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The prevailing evidence proposes that two receptors are involved in the platelet response to collagen; integrin α2β1 acts to adhere platelets to collagen, allowing platelets to interact with the lower affinity receptor glycoprotein VI, which is mainly responsible for platelet activation (3Morton L.F. Peachey A.R. Barnes M.J. Biochem. J. 1989; 258: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 5Santoro S.A. Walsh J.J. Staatz W.D. Baranski K.J. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 905-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Many of the platelet responses to collagen progress simultaneously when platelets adhere to collagen. At high concentrations, collagen activation of platelets has been shown to proceed through activation of phospholipase Cγ2 and subsequent cleavage of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate into inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and 1,2-diacylglycerol (6Rittenhouse S.E.

Nature. 1984; 308: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (5766) Google Scholar). The collagen-induced inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-mediated increase in [Ca2+]i is accompanied by an influx of calcium from the extracellular milieu (11Ardlie N.G. Garrett J.J. Bell L.K. Thromb.

The collagen-induced increase in [Ca2+]i can be decreased by inhibiting the production of TXA via the pretreatment of platelets with cyclooxygenase inhibitors such as aspirin (11Ardlie N.G.

Cell Calcium. 2000; 27: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Calcium is an important second messenger in the platelet activation cascade. At rest, a [Ca2+]i of ∼100 nm is maintained by a balance between the leak of Ca2+ into the platelet and the concurrent efflux of free Ca2+ across the plasma membrane of the platelet and accumulation in intracellular stores (18Rink T.J. Smith S.W. Tsien R.Y. FEBS Lett. 1982; 148: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 19Purdon A.D. Daniel J.L. Stewart G.J. Holmsen H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 800: 178-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Ca2+ is moved out across the plasma membrane through the actions of the plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase and the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX). Plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPases are membrane-inserted enzymes that use the energy of ATP hydrolysis to move Ca2+ against its gradient and across the membrane. The NCX is capable of moving Ca2+ into or out of the platelet cytosol in exchange for Na+ (20Rengasamy A. Soura S. Feinberg H. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1987; 57: 337-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 21Schaeffer J. Blaustein M.P. Cell Calcium. 1989; 10: 101-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In the resting state, the NCX removes Ca2+ from the platelet cytosol. Internally, Ca2+ is transported into the dense tubular system by the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPases 2b and 3 (22Papp B. Enyedi A. Kovacs T. Sarkadi B. Wuytack F. Thastrup O. Gardos G. Bredoux R. Levy-Toledano S. Enouf J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14593-14596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Wuytack F.

In response to a moderate dose of collagen (10 μg/ml), ∼70% of the increase in [Ca2+]i is due to the influx of Ca2+ from the extracellular milieu, with the remainder as a function of Ca2+ release from the dense tubular system (12Roberts D.E. Bose R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2002; 976: 345-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Because voltage-gated calcium channels are not present in platelets (24Pipili E. Thromb.

Res. 1983; 52: 226-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), either a receptor-operated calcium channel or a reverse mode NCX could contribute to the influx of Ca2+ (20Rengasamy A. Soura S.

The initial influx of Na+ would be essential for the reversal of NCX. Influx of Na+ has been shown upon activation of platelets by thrombin, ADP, and polylysine (29Greenberg-Sepersky S.M. Simons E.R.

Matsuoka and Hilgemann (33Matsuoka S. Hilgemann D.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 100: 963-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) reported that at a [Ca2+]i of 100 nm and a membrane potential of –60 mV (platelet membrane potential at rest and in response to collagen (32MacIntyre D.E. Rink T.J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1982; 47: 22-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar)), a small change in [Na+]i can result in the reversal of the NCX. Na+/H+ exchangers (NHEs) could also contribute to the increase in [Na+]i and subsequent NCX reversal. The objective of this study was to determine the mechanism responsible for the collagen-induced increase in human platelet [Ca2+]i. Our findings demonstrate that the majority of the collagen-induced increase in [Ca2+]i results from the influx of Ca2+ from the extracellular milieu via the NCX functioning in the reverse mode. The reverse mode NCX appears to be a result of the influx of Na+ into the platelet cytosol via the actions of TXA and, to a lesser extent, of the NHE. Platelet Isolation—Venous blood (40 ml) was drawn from healthy volunteers, who denied taking aspirin for at least 14 days prior to participation, into tubes containing the anticoagulant EDTA. The platelet-rich plasma was isolated from blood samples by centrifugation at 600 rpm for 15 min. Platelets were isolated from platelet-rich plasma by centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 15 min. Platelet samples were resuspended in 500 μl of platelet-poor plasma and loaded with the appropriate fluorescent dye. Fura-2 could not be used for the determination of [Ca2+]i due to interactions with a number of the pharmacological compounds required for evaluating the role of the NCX (34Kraut R.P. Greenberg A.H. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Bose R. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 214: 413-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In this study, two dyes, calcium green-AM dye (10 μm) and fura red-AM dye (20 μm), which are excited at long wavelengths, but have opposite responses in emission upon binding calcium, were used in combination. Calcium green and fura red have single peaks of excitation or emission and are difficult to work with alone, as artifacts introduced from platelet shape change, adhesion, dye loading, and platelet number affect fluorescence readings. With the ratiometric approach of combining two dyes, these artifacts were avoided, and the calculated values became very reproducible in different batches of platelets. This combination of dyes has been used in many tissues, including platelets (35Kuwahara M. Sugimoto M. Tsuji S. Miyata S. Yoshioka A. Blood. 1999; 94: 1149-1155Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This approach was validated in a series of experiments shown in Fig. 1. The emission spectrum of the free dye combination within in platelets (Fig. 1b) was similar to that in buffer solution (Fig. 1a). There was only one component in the dose-response relationship of the fluorescence ratio with free [Ca2+]i in digitonin-permeabilized platelets. The free calcium concentration was calculated as described (36Imai S. Takeda K. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1967; 190: 155-169Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and takes into account the presence of 1 mm MgCl2 in the assay buffer and the pH of the solution. The apparent binding constant (Kd(app)) of the dye combination for calcium calculated from a batch of platelets as shown in Fig. 1d. The mean Kd(app) from eight different platelet samples was 188 ± 7. The time course of the collagen-induced release of calcium from platelets with the calcium green/fura red combination was very similar to that observed with Fura-2, a ratiometric dye widely used for calcium measurements in platelets (Fig. 1e). pHi was determined with 2′,7′-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein-AM dye (10 μm), and [Na+]i was measured with sodium-binding benzofuran isophthalate-AM dye (20 μm). Each sample was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C to load the dye. Preparation of Platelet Samples—Following incubation, the platelets were separated from the plasma and extracellular dye by gel filtration using a Sepharose CL-2B column. The platelets were eluted in Ca2+-free HEPES buffer containing 140 mm NaCl, 4.9 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 1.4 mm KH2PO4, 5.5 mm glucose, 0.25% albumin, and 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4); counted in a Coulter counter; and adjusted to 2 × 108 platelets/ml. Where required, N-methylglucamine or choline chloride was substituted for NaCl to maintain equal osmolarity. Prior to each experiment, 1 mm Ca2+ was added to the platelet suspension. Where appropriate, a sample of the platelet suspension was incubated in 0.5 mm aspirin for 1 h at 37 °C. The sample was then centrifuged to isolate the platelets, which were resuspended in the appropriate volume of calcium-free HEPES buffer to maintain a platelet concentration of 2 × 108 platelets/ml. Previous studies have shown that isolated plasma-free platelets stored at 4 °C retain their functions for several hour (37Johnson P.C. Ware J.A. Cliveden P.B. Smith M. Dvorak A.M. Salzman E.W. J.

Fig. 2 shows that, under these conditions, platelets retained a similar basal [Ca2+]i and function (aggregation) compared with those of freshly isolated platelets for up to 2 h. In contrast, platelets incubated at room temperature (21 °C) in calcium-free buffer deteriorated rapidly; and after 2 h, there was a significant increase in basal [Ca2+]i and a reduction in platelet function (aggregation) (Fig. 2). Storage of platelets in calcium-free buffer on ice or at room temperature had no significant effect on the collagen-induced change in [Ca2+]i (299.8 ± 11.1 nm (n = 5; not significant) and 363.3 ± 53.1 (n = 5; not significant), respectively) compared with the control (311.1 ± 33.7, n = 5) measured 2 min following the addition of collagen (10 μg/ml). Therefore, platelets in calcium-free buffer were stored on ice throughout the course of this study. Fluorescence and Aggregation Measurement—Aliquots of the platelets were incubated with 1 mm Ca2+ at 37 °C for at least 5 min prior to conducting the test response. Changes in fluorescence and aggregation were simultaneously measured at 37 °C in a Jasco Model CAF-110 ion analyzer. The excitation wavelength for [Ca2+]i measurement was 500 nm, and the emission wavelengths were 540 and 660 nm. The excitation wavelengths for [pH]i measurement were 440 and 500 nm, and the emission wavelength was 540 nm. For [Na+]i measurements, the excitation wavelengths were 340 and 380 nm, and the emission wavelength was 500 nm. [Ca2+]i, [pH]i, and [Na+]i were calculated according to previously published formulas (39Patel P. Sharma S. Bose R. J. Vasc. Med. Biol. 1991; 3: 314-319Google Scholar, 41Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M.

Calcium Requirement for Collagen-induced Platelet Activation—Administration of collagen to human platelets suspended in 1 mm Ca2+ resulted in a dose-dependent increase in [Ca2+]i (Fig. 3a) (11Ardlie N.G. Garrett J.J. Bell L.K. Thromb. Res. 1986; 42: 115-124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The KD50 for the collagen-induced increase in [Ca2+]i measured 1 min following the administration was 10.1 ± 2.2 μg/ml (n = 6). To determine the absolute requirement of [Ca2+]i, platelets were suspended in Ca2+-free medium with 5 mm EGTA 1 min prior to their activation with collagen (10 μg/ml) or loaded with 20 μm BAPTA-AM at 37 °C for 30 min and administered 5 mm EGTA 1 min prior to their activation with collagen (10 μg/ml). The chelation of extracellular calcium with EGTA decreased the collagen-induced change in [Ca2+]i (22.99 ± 6.99 nm, n = 4; p < 0.05) and aggregation (51.77 ± 9.14%, n = 4; p < 0.05). In the case of BAPTA and EGTA, collagen induced neither a change in [Ca2+]i (1.82 ± 0.53 nm, n = 4; p < 0.005) (Fig. 4a) nor aggregation (1.00 ± 1.88%, n = 4; p < 0.005) (Fig. 4b) compared with platelets that were untreated with BAPTA-AM and EGTA.Fig. 4Role of sodium and calcium in collagen activation of human platelets. a, collagen-induced change in [Ca2+]i measured 2 min following the administration of collagen (10 μg/ml) for platelet samples suspended in 1 mm Ca2+ (Control), 0 mm extracellular calcium achieved by administering 5 mm EGTA 1 min prior to the addition of collagen (10 μg/ml), or total 0 mm calcium achieved through the preincubation of platelet samples with BAPTA-AM (20 μm) and the administration of 5 mm EGTA 1 min prior to the addition of collagen (10 μg/ml). b, relative percent change in the collagen-induced platelet aggregation of platelet samples administered 5 mm EGTA 1 min prior to the administration of collagen or pretreated with BAPTA-AM (20 μm) and administered 5 mm EGTA 1 min prior to the administration of collagen compared with platelet samples suspended in 1 mm Ca2+/HEPES buffer (Control). Platelet aggregation was measured 2 min following the addition of collagen (10 μg/ml). c, collagen-induced change in [Ca2+]i measured 2 min following the administration of 10 μg/ml collagen to platelets suspended in 1 mm Ca2+/HEPES buffer containing 140 mm Na+ (Control) and to platelets pretreated with 20 μm BAPTA-AM and suspended in 1 mm Ca2+/HEPES buffer containing either 140 mm Na+ (BAPTA) or 0 mm Na+ (BAPTA Zero Na+). d, relative change in collagen-induced platelet aggregation measured 2 min following the administration of collagen for platelet samples pretreated with 20 μm BAPTA-AM and suspended in 1 mm Ca2+/HEPES buffer containing either 140 mm Na+ (BAPTA) or 0 mm Na+ (BAPTA Zero Na+) compared with the control. *, p < 0.05 (n = 4); **, p < 0.005 (n = 4).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Effect of Extracellular Sodium on the Collagen-induced Increase in [Ca2+]i—To determine the effects of external Na+ on the collagen-induced increase in [Ca2+]i, platelets were suspended in buffer containing 140, 28 (low Na+), or 0 (no Na+) mm Na+. Low-Na+/HEPES and no-Na+/HEPES buffers contained either N-methylglucamine or choline chloride to maintain equal osmolarity. Removal of extracellular Na+ resulted in a significant reduction in both [Ca2+]i and aggregation regardless of the substituent used to maintain iso-osmolality (Table I). To ensure that these results were due to the absence of Na+ and not to the effects of N-methylglucamine or choline chloride, in a separate series of experiments, the no-extracellular Na+ experiment was repeated using iso-osmolar sucrose (280 mm). The collagen-induced change in [Ca2+]i measured 2 min following the addition of 10 μg/ml collagen was reduced by 61.2 ± 5.3% (n = 5; p < 0.0005) for platelets suspended in no-Na+/sucrose-substituted buffer. Platelets suspended in no-Na+/choline chloride- or no-Na+/N-methylglucamine-substituted buffer had a collagen-induced change in [Ca2+]i that was reduced by 35.4 ± 11.8% (n = 4; p < 0.05) and 33.4 ± 5.1% (n = 4; p < 0.05), respectively. From these results, we concluded that the reduction in collagen-induced activation of human platelets in the absence of extracellular Na+ is due to the effect of Na+ and not to the substituent used to replace it.Table IEffect of extracellular sodium on the collagen-induced increase in cytosolic Ca2+ and aggregationTreatmentΔ[Ca2+]iSample sizeAggregationSample sizenm%140 mm Na+ (control)329.1 ± 28.34100428 mm Na+, 112 mm choline chloride300.1 ± 28.5aNot significant.470.1 ± 7.1b*, p < 0.05 (n = 4).428 mm Na+, 112 mm N-methylglucamine270.7 ± 26.1aNot significant.468.7 ± 3.5b*, p < 0.05 (n = 4).40 mm Na+, 140 mm choline chloride209.4 ± 32.6b*, p < 0.05 (n = 4).463.9 ± 4.4c**, p < 0.005 (n = 4).40 mm Na+, 140 mm N-methylglucamine215.3 ± 12.6b*, p < 0.05 (n = 4).466.5 ± 4.1c**, p < 0.005 (n = 4).4a Not significant.b *, p < 0.05 (n = 4).c **, p < 0.005 (n = 4). Open table in a new tab Chelation of intracellular calcium by BAPTA alone in medium containing 1 mm Ca2+ had no effect on the collagen-induced change in [Ca2+]i (65.9 ± 20.4 nm, n = 4; not significant) (Fig. 4c), but reduced collagen-induced aggregation (55.7 ± 12.0%, n = 4; p < 0.005) (Fig. 4d). In contrast, chelation of intracellular calcium in platelets suspended in no-Na+ medium containing N-methylglucamine reduced the collagen-induced increase in [Ca2+]i by 64.4 ± 3.6 nm (n = 4; p < 0.005) (Fig. 4c) and the collagen-induced aggregation by 90.6 ± 7.3% (n = 4; p < 0.005) (Fig. 4d). Inhibition of the NCX by CBDMB caused a significant decrease in the collagen-induced increase in [Ca2+]i of 87.8 ± 24.8 nm (n = 5; p < 0.005), whereas inhibition of the NHE by EIPA had no significant effect (Fig. 5a). Inhibition of the NCX also produced a decrease of 88.3 ± 7.7% (n = 5; p < 0.005) in collagen-induced platelet aggregation, whereas inhibition of the NHE by EIPA had no significant effect (Fig. 5b). The NCX inhibitors CBDMB and KB-R7943 decreased the collagen-induced changes in [Ca2+]i in a dose-dependent manner (12Roberts D.E. Bose R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2002; 976: 345-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The KD50 values measured 30 s following collagen activation were 4.7 ± 1.1 μm for CBDMB (n = 4) (Fig. 5c) and 35.1 ± 4.8 μm for KB-R7943 (n = 5) (Fig. 5d). Collagen-induced platelet activation was associated with an increase in pHi of 0.26 ± 0.7 (n = 5; p < 0.05) (Fig. 6b) from a base line of 7.47 ± 0.2 (n = 15). Pretreatment with the NCX blocker CBDMB (4 μm) did not significantly alter the collagen-induced change in pHi (Fig. 6b). However, inhibition of the NHE by EIPA (50 μm) abolished the collagen-induced increase in pHi and indeed decreased the pHi by 0.38 ± 0.11 (n = 5; p < 0.05) (Fig. 6b) compared with the control. Collagen-induced activation of aspirin-pretreated platelets increased the pHi by 0.10 ± 0.04 (n = 5), which is not significantly different from non-aspirin-treated platelets. Pretreatment with either CBDMB (4 μm) or EIPA (50 μm) did not significantly alter the collagen-induced change in pHi (0.23 ± 0.19 (n = 5; not significant) and 0.06 ± 0.07 (n = 5; not significant), respectively) compared with the control. Time Course for the Collagen-induced Changes in [Ca2+]i, [Na+]i, and [pH]i —Collagen induced a rapid increase in platelet [Ca2+]i, which gradually decreased over a 5-min period (Fig. 7a). Deducting the collagen-induced Ca2+ release (Fig. 7b) from the total change in [Ca2+]i (Fig. 7a) established which portion of the collagen-induced increase in [Ca2+]i is due to collagen-induced Ca2+ influx (Fig. 7c). The collagen-induced release of intracellular Ca2+ was significant only in the first phase of platelet activation, whereas the collagen-induced Ca2+ influx predominated throughout. Both [Na+]i (Fig. 7d) and [pH]i (Fig. 7e) were found to increase during the 5 min following the administration of collagen; however, the changes in [pH]i became significant only at latter time points. In addition, the changes in [pH]i were often transient. Role of Thromboxane in the Collagen-induced Entry of Sodium and Calcium—Collagen-induced activation of human platelets resulted in an increase in [Na+]i of 26.9 ± 8.6 mm from a base line of 33.1 ± 6.4 mm. Pretreatment of platelets with aspirin to inhibit the production of TXA reduced the collagen-induced increase in [Na+]i to 7.6 ± 5.7 mm (n = 4; p < 0.05) (Fig. 8b). Aspirin pretreatment of platelets reduced the collagen-induced change in [Ca2+]i from 147.3 ± 13.3 to 55.4 ± 3.7 nm (n = 5; p < 0.0005) (Fig. 8c) (11Ardlie N.G. Garrett J.J. Bell L.K. Thromb.

Res. 1986; 42: 115-124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The collagen-induced change in [Ca2+]i in aspirin-pretreated platelets was reduced further by the administration of either the NCX blocker CBDMB at 4 μm (36.3 ± 5.1 nm, n = 5; p < 0.005) or the NHE blocker EIPA at 50 μm (40.3 ± 3.7 nm, n = 5; p < 0.005) (Fig. 9a). The collagen-induced aggregation of aspirin-pretreated platelets was reduced by 33.1 ± 8.6% (n = 5; p < 0.05) by CBDMB, whereas EIPA did not result in a significant further reduction in collagen-induced aggregation (7.4 ± 11.9%, n = 5; not significant) (Fig. 9b). Chelation of extracellular calcium with EGTA prior to collagen activation of aspirin-pretreated platelets reduced the collagen-induced change in [Ca2+]i to 9.3 ± 2.2 nm (n = 5; p < 0.0005) (see Fig. 11a).Fig. 11Role of extracellular Ca2+ in platelet activation. a, collagen-induced change in [Ca2+]i measured 3 min following the administration of 10 μg/ml collagen to aspirin (0.5 mm)-pretreated platelets suspended in 1 mm Ca2+/HEPES buffer (Control) or in no-Ca2+ medium achieved by the administration of 5 mm EGTA 1 min prior to collagen administration. b, U-46619-induced change in [Ca2+]i measured 3 min following the administration of 10 μm U-46619 to platelets suspended in 1 mm Ca2+/HEPES buffer or in no-Ca2+ medium achieved by the administration of 5 mm EGTA 1 min prior to the admi"
https://openalex.org/W2080172252,"In about 30% of the patients with acute myeloid leukemia, activating FLT3 receptor mutations have been identified, often as in-frame internal tandem duplications (ITD) at the juxtamembrane domain of the receptor. FLT3-ITD receptors exhibit constitutive tyrosine kinase activity in the absence of FLT3 ligand (FL) binding, and when expressed in cytokine-dependent cell lines and primary hematopoietic cells suppress programmed cell death and increase cell division. However, the signaling pathways important for transformation, in particular the nuclear targets, are unknown. Here we demonstrate that FLT3-ITD expression in Ba/F3 cells results in activation of Akt and concomitant phosphorylation of the Forkhead family member Foxo3a. Phosphorylation of Foxo proteins through FLT3-ITD signaling promotes their translocation from the nucleus into the cytoplasm, which requires the presence of conserved Akt phosphorylation sites in Forkhead transcription factors and PI3K activity. Induction of Foxo3a phosphorylation by FLT3-ITD receptors in Ba/F3 cells correlates with the suppression of Foxo-target genes p27Kip1 and the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bim. Specifically, FLT3-ITD expression prevents Foxo3a-mediated apoptosis and upregulation of p27Kip1 and Bim gene expression. These data indicate that the oncogenic tyrosine kinase FLT3 can negatively regulate Foxo transcription factors, thereby promoting cell survival and proliferation."

Using a retroviral gene-trap vector optimized for efficient mutagenesis and cloning, we randomly disrupted genes in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells and amplified them to construct a cDNA microarray. With this gene-trap array, we show that transcriptional target genes of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) can be efficiently and reliably identified in physiologically relevant cells and are immediately accessible to genetic studies to determine their in vivo roles and relative contributions to PDGF-regulated developmental processes. The same platform can be used to search for genes of specific biological relevance in a broad array of experimental settings, providing a fast track from gene identification to functional validation."
https://openalex.org/W1964576474,"Mammals express nine membranous adenylyl cyclase isoforms (ACs 1-9), a structurally related soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) and a soluble AC (sAC). Moreover, Bacillus anthracis and Bacillus pertussis produce the AC toxins, edema factor (EF), and adenylyl cyclase toxin (ACT), respectively. 2'(3')-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl)-guanosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate is a potent competitive inhibitor of AC in S49 lymphoma cell membranes. These data prompted us to study systematically the effects of 24 nucleotides on AC in S49 and Sf9 insect cell membranes, ACs 1, 2, 5, and 6, expressed in Sf9 membranes and purified catalytic subunits of membranous ACs (C1 of AC5 and C2 of AC2), sAC, sGC, EF, and ACT in the presence of MnCl(2). N-Methylanthraniloyl (MANT)-GTP inhibited C1.C2 with a K(i) of 4.2 nm. Phe-889 and Ile-940 of C2 mediate hydrophobic interactions with the MANT group. MANT-inosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate potently inhibited C1.C2 and ACs 1, 5, and 6 but exhibited only low affinity for sGC, EF, ACT, and G-proteins. Inosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate and uridine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate were mixed G-protein activators and AC inhibitors. AC5 was up to 15-fold more sensitive to inhibitors than AC2. EF and ACT exhibited unique inhibitor profiles. At sAC, 2',5'-dideoxyadenosine 3'-triphosphate was the most potent compound (IC(50), 690 nm). Several MANT-adenine and MANT-guanine nucleotides inhibited sGC with K(i) values in the 200-400 nm range. UTP and ATP exhibited similar affinities for sGC as GTP and were mixed sGC substrates and inhibitors. The exchange of MnCl(2) against MgCl(2) reduced inhibitor potencies at ACs and sGC 1.5-250-fold, depending on the nucleotide and cyclase studied. The omission of the NTP-regenerating system from cyclase reactions strongly reduced the potencies of MANT-ADP, indicative for phosphorylation to MANT-ATP by pyruvate kinase. Collectively, AC isoforms and sGC are differentially inhibited by purine and pyrimidine nucleotides."
https://openalex.org/W2024805148,"PIASy, a member of the protein inhibitor of activated STAT (PIAS) family, represses the transcriptional activity of the androgen receptor (AR). In this report, we investigate the mechanism of PIASy-mediated repression of AR. We show that AR binds to the RING-finger like domain of PIASy. PIASy contains two transcriptional repression domains, RD1 and RD2. RD1, but not RD2, is required for PIASy-mediated repression of AR. We show that the RD1 domain binds HDAC1 and HDAC2 and that HDAC activity is required for PIASy-mediated AR repression. PIAS proteins possess small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) E3 ligase activity. Conjugation of SUMO-1 to AR has been implicated in the regulation of AR activity. We examine if the SUMO ligase activity of PIASy is required for PIASy to repress AR. We show that a mutant PIASy, defective in promoting sumoylation, retains the ability to repress AR transcription. In addition, mutation of all the known sumoylation acceptor sites of AR does not affect the transrepression activity of PIASy on AR. Our results suggest that PIASy may repress AR by recruiting histone deacetylases, independent of its SUMO ligase activity."
https://openalex.org/W2077247436,"To study the mechanisms by which mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinases regulate cell cycle re-entry, we have used a panel of conditional kinases that stimulate defined MAPK or SAPK cascades. Activation of ΔMEKK3:ER* during serum restimulation of quiescent cells causes a strong activation of JNK1 and p38α but only a modest potentiation of serum-stimulated ERK1/2 activity. In CCl39 cells this promoted a sustained G1 arrest that correlated with decreased expression of cyclin D1 and Cdc25A, increased expression of p21CIP1 and inhibition of CDK2 activity. In Rat-1 cells, in which p21CIP1 expression is silenced by methylation, ΔMEKK3:ER* activation caused only a transient delay in the S phase entry rather than a sustained G1 arrest. Furthermore, p21CIP1−/− 3T3 cells were defective for the ΔMEKK3:ER*-induced G1 cell cycle arrest compared to their wild-type counterparts. These results suggest that activated ΔMEKK3:ER* inhibits the G1 → S progression by two kinetically distinct mechanisms, with expression of p21CIP1 being required to ensure a sustained G1 cell cycle arrest. The ERK1/2 and p38αβ pathways cooperated to induce p21CIP1 expression and inhibition of p38αβ caused a partial reversal of the cell cycle arrest. In contrast, selective activation of ERK1/2 by ΔRaf-1:ER* did not inhibit serum stimulated cell cycle re-entry. Finally, selective activation of JNK by ΔMEKK1:ER* failed to inhibit cell cycle re-entry, even in cells that retained wild-type p53, arguing against a major role for JNK alone in antagonizing the G1 → S transition."
https://openalex.org/W1980587393,"Different sensory organs, such the eye and ear, are widely thought to have separate origins, guided by distinct organ-specific factors that direct all aspects of their development. Previous studies of the D. melanogaster gene eyeless (ey) and its vertebrate homolog Pax6 suggested that this gene acts in such a manner and specifically drives eye development. But diverse sensory organs might instead arise by segment-specific modification of a developmental program that is involved more generally in sensory organ formation. In D. melanogaster, a common proneural gene called atonal (ato) functions in the initial process of development of a number of segment-specific organs, including the compound eye, the auditory organ and the stretch receptor, suggesting that these organs share an evolutionary origin. Here we show that D. melanogaster segment-specific sensory organs form through the integration of decapentaplegic (dpp), wingless (wg) and ecdysone signals into a single cis-regulatory element of ato. The induction of ectopic eyes by ey also depends on these signals for ato expression, and the ey mutant eye imaginal disc allows ato expression if cell death is blocked. These results imply that ey does not induce the entire eye morphogenetic program but rather modifies ato-dependent neuronal development. Our findings strongly suggest that various sensory organs evolved from an ato-dependent protosensory organ through segment specification by ey and Hox genes."
https://openalex.org/W2000630388,"In T lymphocytes, engagement of the antigen receptor leads to a biphasic Ca2+ flux consisting of a mobilization of Ca2+ from intracellular stores followed by a lower but sustained elevation that is dependent on extracellular Ca2+. The prolonged Ca2+ flux is required for activation of transcription factors and for subsequent activation of the T cell. Ca2+ influx requires as yet unidentified Ca2+ channels, which potentially play a role in T cell activation. Here we present evidence that human T cells express a non-voltage-gated Ca2+ channel related to L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels.

An increase in cytosolic Ca2+ is a critical second messenger controlling T cell activation and proliferation through gene transcription. Engagement of the TCR induces the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores followed by Ca2+ entry across the plasma membrane. The initial phase of calcium release is mediated through inositol (1,4,5)-P3 and in non-excitable cells, store depletion activates Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane. Prolonged Ca2+ elevation is required for a sustained translocation of the transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) into the nucleus.

Ca2+ influx depends on the expression of a store-operated Ca2+ channel (SOC), the nature of which is the subject of much research. While SOCs have been defined electrophysiologically, their molecular identity remains unclear. The best characterized SOC current is the Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ current, ICRAC. Zweifach and Lewis (6Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6295-6299Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar) showed that TCR cross-linking activates a channel with properties identical to ICRAC. In patients with a primary immunodeficiency there is an absence of ICRAC and no TCR-activated Ca2+ influx (1Partiseti M. Le Deist F. Hivroz C. Fischer A. Korn H. Choquet D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32327-32335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These studies demonstrate that the ICRAC channel is activated following TCR cross-linking. The molecular identity of the ICRAC channel is unknown, but a small number of candidates have emerged. Mammalian homologues of the Drosophila Trp proteins have been reported to be expressed in Jurkat T lymphocytes (7Garcia R.L. Schilling W.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 279-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 8Li S.W. Westwick J. Poll C.T. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2002; 23: 63-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The TrpV family member TrpV6 (CaT1) is the strongest contender for the ICRAC channel (9Yue L. Peng J.B. Hediger M.A. Clapham D.E. Nature. 2001; 410: 705-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 10Cui J. Bian J.S. Kagan A. McDonald T.V. J. Biol.

Hoenderop J.G.J. Bindels R.J.M. Droogmans G. Penner R. Nilius B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47767-47770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). It is possible that no single Trp family protein alone forms the ICRAC channel, rather that there is a heteromultimeric channel formed from an assemblage of various Trp proteins. In support of this Cui et al. (10Cui J. Bian J.S. Kagan A. McDonald T.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47175-47183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) found that Jurkat T lymphocytes express both TrpV1 and TrpV5 (ECaC1) in addition to TrpV6 and suggested that TrpV5 contributed to the ICRAC current. Furthermore, Philipp et al. (12Philipp S. Strauss B. Hirnet D. Wissenbach U. Mery L. Flockerzi V. Hoth M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26629-26638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) isolated a series of random mutants of Jurkat T cells with defects in TCR-dependent Ca2+ entry. These all had mutations in TrpC3, and normal TCR-mediated Ca2+ entry could be restored by overexpression of normal TrpC3. While there is growing evidence for the identity of the store-operated Ca2+ channel in T lymphocytes, it is also clear that SOCs are not the sole Ca2+ channel present in lymphocytes. There is some support for inositol trisphosphate receptors being expressed at the surface of T cells where they may function as Ca2+ channels (13Khan A.A. Steiner J.P. Klein M.G. Schneider M.F. Snyder S.H. Science. 1992; 257: 815-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 14Tanimura A. Tojyo Y. Turner R.J. J. Biol.

A non-selective channel defined by the current it passes, the Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ current (ICRANC), has been described in human lymphocytes (15Nofer J.-R. Junker R. Seedorf U. Assmann G. Zidek W. Tepel M. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 16Su Z. Csutora P. Hunton D. Shoemaker R.L. Marchase R.B. Blalock J.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C1113-C1284Crossref Google Scholar), and there are data to indicate the expression of channels related to voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (reviewed in Ref. 17Grafton G. Thwaite L. Immunology. 2001; 104: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Voltage-gated Ca2+ channels are a family composed of 10 known types. They are classified according to the nature of the current they conduct following depolarization. The channels are composed of a pore-forming α1-subunit and accessory β-, α2δ-, and γ-subunits. The nature of the α1-subunit defines the type of Ca2+ channel (18Catterall W.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 521-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1954) Google Scholar, 19Catterall W.A. Striessnig J. Snutch T.P. Perez-Reyes E. Pharmacol. Rev. 2003; 55: 579-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). A growing body of evidence indicates that lymphocytes express a non-voltage-gated Ca2+ channel related to the L-type of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. The L-type channels are defined by their expression of 1 of 4 types of α1-subunit: α11.1–α11.4 (20Ertel E.A. Campbell K.P. Harpold M.M. F.H. Mori Y. Perez-Reyes E. Schwartz A. Snutch T.P. Tanabe T. Birnbaumer L. Tsien R.W. Catterall W.A. Neuron. 2000; 25: 533-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). Initial evidence for the presence of L-type Ca2+ channels in lymphocytes relied on pharmacological studies using antagonists of these channels. A number of studies showed effects of these antagonists on B and T cell activation (21Birx D.L. Berger M. Fleisher T.A. J. Immunol. 1984; 133: 2904-2909PubMed Google Scholar, 22Dugas B. Vazquez A.

More substantial evidence for the expression of voltage-gated Ca2+ channel-related channels has been provided by the detection of Ca2+ channel transcripts and protein in various cell types. Akha et al. (25Akha A.A.S. Willmott N.J. Brickley K. Dolphin A.C. Galione A. Hunt S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7297-7300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) showed that rat B lymphocytes expressed a channel related to the CaV1.3 (α1D) L-type channel (25Akha A.A.S.

We have demonstrated that human B lymphocytes express a truncated α11.2 (α1C) -subunit together with a regulatory β1-subunit (26Grafton G. Stokes L. Toellner K.-M. Gordon J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 66: 2001-2009Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Similar channels have been detected in T lymphocytes. Savignac et al. (27Savignac M. Badou A. Moreau M. Leclerc C. Guery J.C. Paulet P. Druet P. Ragab_Thomas J. Pelletier L. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1577-1579Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) showed surface staining of mouse T cells with an anti-α11.3 antibody and demonstrated a transcript for α11.3 in those cells. Brereton et al. (28Brereton H.M. Harland M.L. Froscio M. Petronijevic T. Barritt G.J. Cell Calcium. 1997; 22: 39-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) used RT-PCR to demonstrate the presence of transcripts for α11.1 and α11.2 in Jurkat T cells. Most recently, Kotturi et al. (29Kotturi M.F. Carlow D.A. Lee J.C. Ziltener H.J. Jefferies W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46949-46960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) showed the presence of an α11.4 transcript in Jurkat and provided some pharmacological data to indicate that a voltage-gated Ca2+ channel-related channel may have a role in T lymphocyte activation (29Kotturi M.F.

These studies have not directly addressed the expression of a voltage-gated Ca2+ channel-related protein in human T lymphocytes. The body of studies showing the pharmacological effects of antagonists coupled with detection of multiple transcripts is confused by the absence of studies detecting protein expression in human T cells. Here we provide the first direct evidence for the expression of non-voltage-gated Ca2+ channel proteins in human T lymphocytes, together with accessory regulatory subunits. Cells and Cell Culture—The T cell lines Jurkat, Molt-4, H9, Hut78, and CCRF-CEM were cultured as described in Ref. 30Grafton G. Goodall M. Gregory C.D. Gordon J. Cell. Immunol. 1997; 182: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar. The Kelly (human neuroblastoma) cell line was cultured as described in Ref. 26Grafton G. Stokes L. Toellner K.-M. Gordon J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 66: 2001-2009Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar. Peripheral blood T cells were obtained from buffy coat preparations supplied by the National Blood Transfusion Service and were isolated as described in Ref. 31Manzotti C.N. Tipping H. Perry L.C.A. Mead K.I. Blair P.J. Zheng Y. Sansom D.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 2888-2896Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar. Isolated peripheral blood T cells were used directly after isolation (quiescent cells) or were activated with 2 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and 1 μg/ml ionomycin for 72 h. Intracellular Ca2+ Measurements—Intracellular Ca2+ concentration was measured using fura2-AM. Jurkat T cells (5 × 107) were loaded with 1 μm fura-2AM (Calbiochem) in culture medium plus 1 mm probenecid (Sigma) for 45 min at 25 °C. The loaded cells were washed twice in HBSS containing 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), and 1 mm probenecid, resuspended at 4 × 106 cells/ml in this buffer, and stored on ice until use. Following a 5-min preincubation at 37 °C, intracellular Ca2+ measurements were performed using a Hitachi F2500 spectrophotometer, described in Ref. 26Grafton G. Stokes L. Toellner K.-M. Gordon J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 66: 2001-2009Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar. For experiments where the effects of drugs on the sustained phase of a Ca2+ response were determined, the Ca2+ concentration was averaged over 100 s from 150 to 250 s after the initiation of the experiment. RNA Isolation and RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was extracted using RNAwiz (Ambion) and was treated with DNase I before use. Primers 27U24 (5′-CTC GGA CTC TGG GGC ACA CTT CTT-3′) and 351L26 (5′-ACT CCC GCA TCT CCA TCA CCT TCT TC-3′) were used to amplify α11.2 transcripts. Primers α1D4080 (5′-TCA GAG TTC CCA GGT GTA GCA G-3′) and α1D3858 (5′-ACG AGC AGT CCA AGA TGT TCA AT-3′) were used to amplify α11.3 transcripts. The primers produce transcripts of 350 bp (α11.2) and 243 bp (α11.3). The PCR conditions for α11.2 were 95 °C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min, and final extension at 72 °C for 10 min using AmpliTaqGold polymerase (ABI) and 1 mm Mg2+. PCR conditions for α11.3 were 94 °C for 2 min followed by 40 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 1 min, and final extension at 68 °C for 15 min, using Expand DNA polymerase plus buffer 3 (Roche Applied Science). Primers for human β-subunits were designed using GenBank™ accession NM_000723 (CACNB1), NM_000724 (CACNB2), XM_028766 (CACNB3), and NM_000726 (CACNB4). The β1-subunit primers were sense (5′-GGT GAA GGA GGG CTG TGA GG-3′) and antisense (5′-GAT GAT GTG TTT GCT GGG GTT GT-3′); β2-subunit primers were sense (5′-CCC AGT AAG CAC GCA ATA ATA GA-3′) and antisense (5′-GCT AAT GTA CGG CTA AGG AGA GG-3′); β3-subunit primers were sense (5′-GGG TTC AGC CGA CTC CTA CAC CA-3′) and antisense (5′-CGC CTG CTT TTG CTT CTG CTT G-3′); and β4-subunit primers were sense (5′-GGG CTC CAC GGC ACT CTC A-3′) and antisense (5′-ATC CTC GGT TCC TAT GGG GTT TG-3′). Cycling conditions were 95 °C for 10 min followed by 35 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, 55 °C (β3) or 60 °C (β1, β2, β4) for 1 min and 72 °C for 2 min with final extension at 72 °C for 10 min using AmpliTaqGold polymerase (ABI) and 1.5 mm Mg2+. Predicted PCR product sizes for β-subunits were 421 bp (β1), 414 bp (β2), 451 bp (β3), and 269 bp (β4). All PCR products were sequenced to verify their identity. FACS—Jurkat T cells were fixed with 2% (w/v) paraformaldehyde at room temperature and permeabilized with 0.1% (w/v) saponin in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% (v/v) fetal calf serum. Permeabilized cells were incubated with anti-α11.2 or anti-α11.3 (Alomone) at 3 μg/ml for 1 h followed by anti-rabbit Alexa 488 (Molecular Probes) used at 1:50 dilution. Negative controls were performed by staining with anti-α11.2 or anti-α11.3 (3 μg/ml) that had been preincubated for 1 h with an excess (3 μg/ml) of the peptide against which it had been raised. Secondary staining was performed using 1:50 anti-rabbit Alexa 488. Stained cells were analyzed using a FACS Calibur machine and CellQuest software. Western Blotting—Whole cell lysates were prepared in radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm sodium chloride, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate) containing 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 200 μg/ml benzamide, 8 μg/ml each of calpain inhibitors I and II, 200 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 μg/ml pepstatin A. Positive controls were prepared from fresh rat tissue. Whole rat heart and brain were homogenized in 320 mm sucrose/4 mm HEPES (pH 7.0) buffer (rat heart) or 320 mm sucrose (rat brain) containing the protease and phosphatase inhibitors listed above. Homogenates were centrifuged at 2000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The pellet was resuspended in 320 mm sucrose/4 mm HEPES (pH 7.0) buffer (rat heart) or 320 mm sucrose buffer (rat brain). Protein (25 μg) was subjected to 7.5 or 10% SDS-PAGE. The separated proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Sigma). Nonspecific protein interactions were eliminated using the multiple antigen detection method described by Krajewski et al. (32Krajewski S. Zapata J.M. Reed J.C. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 236: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Briefly, the membrane was blocked with rabbit IgG (3 μg/ml) in 10% nonfat milk, probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, and nonspecific binding was eliminated using an SG peroxidase substrate kit (Vector Laboratories) as per the manufacturer's instructions. The membrane was then blocked with 10% nonfat milk and probed with rabbit anti-α11.2 (3 μg/ml), our in-house anti-α11.2 antibody (3 μg/ml), anti-α11.3 (3 μg/ml), or anti-β3 (3 μg/ml). For mouse anti-β1 (BD Transduction Laboratories) the SG substrate step was not performed. Anti-β1 was used at 2 μg/ml. Specific antibody binding was detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG. Blots were developed with a chemiluminescence detection system (Pierce). Peptide blocking was performed by preincubating the antibody with an equal concentration of specific peptide for 1 h at room temperature before probing the membrane. Statistical Analysis—Statistical analyses in all cases were performed by one-way analysis of variance. Significance was taken to be p < 0.05. L-type Channel Antagonists Reduce TCR-induced Ca2+ Responses and Increase Intracellular Ca2+ in the Absence of TCR Stimulation—A number of recent reports show that drugs active against L-type channels can inhibit Ca2+ influx in nonexcitable cells (26Grafton G. Stokes L. Toellner K.-M. Gordon J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 66: 2001-2009Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 29Kotturi M.F. Carlow D.A. Lee J.C. Ziltener H.J. Jefferies W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46949-46960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To eliminate the possibility of authentic voltage-gated Ca2+ channels being expressed in Jurkat T lymphocytes, cells were treated with 50 mm KCl to induce depolarization. Such treatment did not lead to an influx of extracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 1a). Treatment of the cells with 200 nm gramicidin (a K+ ionophore) also failed to induce a Ca2+ influx (Fig. 1a). These data confirm that Jurkat cells do not possess a functional voltage-gated Ca2+ channel. The major signal that activates a plasma membrane Ca2+ channel in T cells is cross-linking of the TCR. In our experiments, TCR cross-linking was initiated by the addition of OKT3, an anti-CD3ϵ antibody, which mimics the binding of foreign antigen to the TCR. Kotturi et al. (29Kotturi M.F. Carlow D.A. Lee J.C. Ziltener H.J. Jefferies W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46949-46960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) found that the dihydropyridine L-type Ca2+ channel antagonist nifedipine inhibited the anti-CD3-induced Ca2+ flux in Jurkat T lymphocytes in a dose-dependent manner. We extended these observations using representative drugs from two other classes of L-type Ca2+ channel antagonist. Verapamil (a phenylalkylamine) and diltiazem (a benzothiazepine) both inhibited the anti-CD3-induced Ca2+ flux in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1, b and c). The IC50 for the effect of verapamil was 182 ± 42 μm (n = 4) and the IC50 for the effect of diltiazem was 133 ± 60 μm (n = 4). These data are consistent with the expression of a non-voltage-gated L-type Ca2+ channel in T lymphocytes. In B lymphocytes L-type Ca2+ channel antagonists are active on both the initial phase of the antigen-receptor-induced Ca2+ release from intracellular stores and on the sustained phase of the signal, which involves the influx of extracellular Ca2+ (26Grafton G. Stokes L. Toellner K.-M. Gordon J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 66: 2001-2009Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In Jurkat T cells verapamil inhibited the TCR-induced initial Ca2+ flux (Fig. 1d) when added simultaneously with the anti-CD3 antibody. It also partially inhibited the sustained phase of the TCR-induced Ca2+ signal when added after the initial phase of the response (Fig. 1d). Neither verapamil nor diltiazem completely inhibited the TCR-induced Ca2+ flux. To further explore the effects of these drugs on Ca2+ flux in T lymphocytes we treated Jurkat cells with either verapamil or diltiazem in the absence of any other stimulus. Both verapamil and diltiazem induced a dose-dependent rise in intracellular Ca2+ in the absence of TCR cross-linking (Fig. 1e). Consistent with our findings in B lymphocytes (26Grafton G. Stokes L. Toellner K.-M. Gordon J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 66: 2001-2009Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), these data suggest at least two different actions for the L-type antagonists, namely an inhibition of the TCR-mediated Ca2+ flux, plus a separate TCR-independent mobilization of Ca2+. L-type Ca2+ Channel Antagonists Partially Inhibit Thapsigargin-induced Ca2+ Influx—The second phase of the TCR-activated Ca2+ flux is dependent on the influx of extracellular Ca2+ through the ICRAC channel. This Ca2+ channel is also activated following depletion of intracellular stores with thapsigargin (1Partiseti M. Le Deist F. Hivroz C. Fischer A. Korn H. Choquet D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32327-32335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been suggested that dihydropyridines can inhibit SOCs in HL60 promyelomonocytic cells (33Harper J.L. Camerini-Otero C.S. Li A.H. Kim S.A. Jacobson K.A. Daly J.W. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 65: 329-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Therefore we determined the effect of L-type Ca2+ channel antagonists on the thapsigargin-activated Ca2+ flux. Verapamil did not affect the initial release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores (p = N.S. compared with thapsigargin alone). However it did reduce the thapsigargin-induced plateau by 81 ± 13.9% compared with treatment with thapsigargin alone (p = 0.0009, n = 6, Fig. 2, a and b). Similarly, diltiazem did not inhibit the thapsigargin-induced release of Ca2+ from stores (p = N.S compared with thapsigargin alone). It did however inhibit the sustained plateau phase of the Ca2+ signal by 44 ± 4.9% compared with treatment with thapsigargin alone (p = 0.0329, n = 5, Fig. 2, c and d). These data suggest a possible role for L-type Ca2+ channels in the store-operated influx of Ca2+ in Jurkat T cells. Human T Cells Express Full-length and Truncated α11.2 Protein—The data presented suggest the possibility that Jurkat T lymphocytes express L-type Ca2+ channels. However the high drug concentrations used could lead to the possibility of nonspecific effects of these drugs. Therefore we sought to identify whether authentic L-type channels, or L-type-related channels were expressed in T lymphocytes. Previous studies have identified transcripts for the L-type α11.1-, α11.2-, and α11.4-subunits in Jurkat T cells (28Brereton H.M. Harland M.L. Froscio M. Petronijevic T. Barritt G.J. Cell Calcium. 1997; 22: 39-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 29Kotturi M.F. Carlow D.A. Lee J.C. Ziltener H.J. Jefferies W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46949-46960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that human B lymphocytes express α11.2 transcripts and protein (26Grafton G. Stokes L. Toellner K.-M. Gordon J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 66: 2001-2009Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Despite the pharmacological and molecular evidence indicating the possibility of L-type channels in human T cells, the expression of proteins from L-type α1-subunit transcripts has not been demonstrated. We designed PCR primers to a highly conserved region on the α11.2- (α1C) subunit of L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. The amplified region spans exons 34–37 encoding domains IVS4 to IVS6. RT-PCR of cDNA from Jurkat T cells demonstrated that these cells express a transcript for the α11.2-subunit (Fig. 3a). Sequencing confirmed 100% identity of the transcript with the L-type α11.2-subunit. Transcripts for α11.2 were also detected in another human T cell line, Molt-4, and in quiescent and activated peripheral blood T cells (Fig. 3a). To assess whether the mRNA produced functional protein we first investigated α11.2 protein expression by flow cytometric analysis. FACS analysis of permeabilized Jurkat cells stained with a commercial anti-α11.2 antibody revealed that these cells do indeed express α11.2-subunit protein. Preincubation of the antibody with the peptide against which it was raised completely blocked the staining, confirming the specificity of the interaction (Fig. 3b). These data reveal that Jurkat T cells express readily detectable protein related to the L-type α11.2-subunit. We recently reported that human B lymphocytes contain a truncated α11.2-subunit protein (26Grafton G. Stokes L. Toellner K.-M. Gordon J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 66: 2001-2009Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To investigate whether this was also the case in T cells, Western blots of Jurkat lysates and rat heart lysates were probed with a commercial anti-α11.2 antibody (Fig. 3c, lanes 1 and 2). The positive control (rat heart lysates) showed the expected band for α11.2 at 210 kDa. A small amount of the full-length protein was detected in the Jurkat lysates (Fig. 3c, lane 2, faint band), but the dominant band was a truncated protein of 119 kDa. A lower molecular mass protein of ∼86 kDa was detected in both the rat heart and Jurkat lysates. When blots of rat heart and Jurkat lysates were probed with anti-α11.2 that had been preincubated with its control peptide (Fig. 3c, lanes 3 and 4), no bands were detected. We also probed blots of control and Jurkat lysates with our own in-house anti-α11.2 antibody raised against a different sequence to that used as the immunogen for the commercial antibody (26Grafton G.

https://openalex.org/W2030957951,"To infect target cells, HIV-1 employs a virally encoded transmembrane protein (gp41) to fuse its viral envelope with the target cell plasma membrane. We describe the gp41 ectodomain as comprised of N- and C-terminal subdomains, each containing a heptad repeat as well as a fusogenic region, whose organization is mirrored by the intervening loop region. Recent evidence indicates that the gp41 directed fusion reaction proceeds to initial pore formation prior to gp41 folding into its low energy hairpin conformation. This implies that exposed regions of the gp41 ectodomain are responsible for the bulk of the fusion work, probably through direct protein-membrane interactions. Prevalent fusion models contend that the gp41 ectodomain initially interacts with the target cell surface through its highly hydrophobic N terminus, which is believed to insert into the target membrane, thereby linking the virus to the target cell. This arrangement allows the N-terminal subdomain to interact with the target cell surface, whereas the C-terminal subdomain remains proximal to the virion, allowing interaction with the viral envelope. The composition of the viral envelope and the target cell surface differ due to the virus budding from raft microdomains. We show here that constructs corresponding to the C-terminal subdomain specifically destabilize ordered and cholesterol rich membranes (33 molar %), whereas the N-terminal subdomain is more effective in fusing both unordered cholesterol-free membranes and those containing lower amounts of cholesterol (10 molar %). Moreover we show that, in the context of the C-terminal subdomain, the heptad repeat contributes helical structure, which may describe the enhanced inhibitory effect of the C-terminal subdomain relative to the C-terminal heptad repeat (C34) alone. Our results are discussed in light of recent findings that showcase the role of exposed gp41 regions in effecting membrane fusion.

Virally encoded envelope glycoproteins play a major role in driving the membrane fusion reaction by helping to overcome the free energy barriers associated with this process (1Stegmann T. Doms R.W. Helenius A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1989; 18: 187-211Google Scholar). The envelope glycoprotein complex of HIV-1 is initially synthesized as a gp160 precursor molecule that is subsequently processed by a cellular protease into a mature surface, gp120 subunit noncovalently attached to a transmembrane gp41 subunit (2Stein B.S. Engleman E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2640-2649Google Scholar, 3Hallenberger S. Bosch V. Angliker H. Shaw E. Klenk H.D. Garten W. Nature. 1992; 360: 358-361Google Scholar, 4Earl P.L. Moss B. Doms R.W. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2047-2055Google Scholar). The subunits are assembled as trimers (5Center R.J. Leapman R.D. Lebowitz J. Arthur L.O. Earl P.L. Moss B. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 7863-7867Google Scholar), which are directed to the plasma membrane and then incorporated into budding virions. Recent studies (6Nguyen D.H. Hildreth J.E. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 3264-3272Google Scholar, 7Ono A. Freed E.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13925-13930Google Scholar) show preferential budding of the virions through the so-called raft microdomains of the plasma membrane, which provides an explanation for the unusually high content of cholesterol and sphingomyelin in the viral envelope (8Aloia R.C. Tian H. Jensen F.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5181-5185Google Scholar). Binding of gp120 with CD4 and a co-receptor (reviewed in Ref. 9Clapham P.R. McKnight A. J. Gen. Virol. 2002; 83: 1809-1829Google Scholar) cooperatively initiates a series of conformational changes in the gp120·gp41 complex (10Salzwedel K. Berger E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12794-12799Google Scholar), which eventually promotes the actual merging of the viral and target cell membranes via structural rearrangements of the gp41 subunits. Two main functional regions separated by a loop are identified within the extraviral 175-residue ectodomain of the gp41 subunit: N-terminal and C-terminal subdomains (see Fig. 1). The N-terminal subdomain is made of the N-terminal hydrophobic fusion peptide (FP) region and an adjacent α-helical leucine/isoleucine zipper termed the N-terminal heptad repeat (NHR). The FP is believed to play a pivotal role in the fusion event by inserting into the target membrane and directly effecting the fusion of apposing bilayers (reviewed in Refs. 11White J.M. Science. 1992; 258: 917-924Google Scholar and 12Durell S.R. Martin I. Ruysschaert J.M. Shai Y. Blumenthal R. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1997; 14: 97-112Google Scholar), although the mode of action remains illusory. The adjacent NHR is believed to be involved in structural re-arrangements that draw together opposing viral and target cell membranes (13Chan D.C. Kim P.S. Cell. 1998; 93: 681-684Google Scholar). Recent studies show that the NHR acts synergistically with the FP to fuse vesicles, implying that these regions interact directly with membranes (14Sackett K. Shai Y. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4678-4685Google Scholar). We describe the C-terminal subdomain as reflecting its N-terminal counterpart. Specifically, it contains a heptad repeat termed the C-terminal heptad repeat (CHR) followed by a hydrophobic region called the tryptophan rich pre-transmembrane region, which was proposed to serve as an internal fusion peptide (IFP) (15Suarez T. Nir S. Goni F.M. Saez-Cirion A. Nieva J.L. FEBS Lett. 2000; 477: 145-149Google Scholar). Peptides corresponding to the IFP are effective in inducing lipid mixing of model vesicles (15Suarez T. Nir S. Goni F.M. Saez-Cirion A. Nieva J.L. FEBS Lett. 2000; 477: 145-149Google Scholar, 16Suarez T. Gallaher W.R. Agirre A. Goni F.M. Nieva J.L. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 8038-8047Google Scholar, 17Saez-Cirion A. Nir S. Lorizate M. Agirre A. Cruz A. Perez-Gil J. Nieva J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21776-21785Google Scholar). The CHR, similar to the NHR, is believed to be involved in structural re-arrangements of gp41 that results in viral-target membrane apposition (13Chan D.C. Kim P.S. Cell. 1998; 93: 681-684Google Scholar). Current models describe the fusion process through a progression of conformational changes in the gp41 ectodomain. In the native state, gp41 is held in a metastable state by interaction with gp120 (13Chan D.C. Kim P.S. Cell. 1998; 93: 681-684Google Scholar, 18Weissenhorn W. Dessen A. Calder L.J. Harrison S.C. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1999; 16: 3-9Google Scholar). Binding of gp120 to receptors releases gp41 from metastable constraints, allowing it to transform (19Jones P.L. Korte T. Blumenthal R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 404-409Google Scholar) to an extended conformation termed the pre-hairpin intermediate (PHI). Although not observed, the PHI is characterized by exposed NHR and CHR regions (20Furuta R.A. Wild C.T. Weng Y. Weiss C.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 276-279Google Scholar, 21Koshiba T. Chan D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7573-7579Google Scholar, 22Munoz-Barroso I. Durell S. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Blumenthal R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 315-323Google Scholar), and exists transiently (20Furuta R.A. Wild C.T. Weng Y. Weiss C.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 276-279Google Scholar, 22Munoz-Barroso I. Durell S. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Blumenthal R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 315-323Google Scholar), and the N-terminal fusion peptide region is believed to be inserted into the target membrane (11White J.M. Science. 1992; 258: 917-924Google Scholar) thereby bridging the gap between the two membranes. Furthermore, the PHI is believed to be the target of peptide inhibitors derived from the gp41 ectodomain that presumably act by binding to regions in the PHI and competitively inhibit further conformational changes (21Koshiba T. Chan D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7573-7579Google Scholar, 23Wild C.T. Shugars D.C. Greenwell T.K. McDanal C.B. Matthews T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9770-9774Google Scholar, 24Wild C. Oas T. McDanal C. Bolognesi D. Matthews T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10537-10541Google Scholar, 25Jiang S. Lin K. Strick N. Neurath A.R. Nature. 1993; 365: 113Google Scholar, 26Chen C.H. Matthews T.J. McDanal C.B. Bolognesi D.P. Greenberg M.L. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3771-3777Google Scholar). One example is C34, which is derived from the CHR of gp41 and inhibits cell-cell fusion at nanomolar concentrations by binding the NHR coiled-coil (25Jiang S. Lin K. Strick N. Neurath A.R. Nature. 1993; 365: 113Google Scholar). Folding of the PHI into a stable hairpin conformation is believed to coincide with fusion. Contrary to the widely accepted belief that hairpin folding drives the fusion reaction by initiating pore formation, it was recently proposed that fusion pore formation occurs prior to hairpin formation and that hairpins are required for pore stabilization (27Markosyan R.M. Cohen F.S. Melikyan G.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 926-938Google Scholar). The hairpin conformation was contrived based on studies of soluble fragments of the ectodomain, which revealed a thermostable core made of a parallel trimeric coiled-coil of NHR peptides with α-helical CHR peptides packed in an antiparallel manner into the hydrophobic grooves of the coiled-coil (28Chan D.C. Fass D. Berger J.M. Kim P.S. Cell. 1997; 89: 263-273Google Scholar, 29Tan K. Liu J. Wang J. Shen S. Lu M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12303-12308Google Scholar, 30Weissenhorn W. Dessen A. Harrison S.C. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 426-430Google Scholar). It is believed that folding to a hairpin helps draw the apposing membranes together and aligns the target membrane inserted FPs with the transmembrane domains in the viral envelope (13Chan D.C. Kim P.S. Cell. 1998; 93: 681-684Google Scholar, 18Weissenhorn W. Dessen A. Calder L.J. Harrison S.C. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1999; 16: 3-9Google Scholar). This model implies direct interaction of the two membrane proximal regions with their respective membrane targets. Specifically, the FP region interacts with the target membrane, whereas the pre-transmembrane region interacts with the viral membrane. The high cholesterol content of the viral membrane was recently shown to be indispensable for HIV-1 entry at a post receptors-binding stage, implying that the highly ordered viral membrane is required for fusion (31Campbell S.M. Crowe S.M. Mak J. AIDS. 2002; 16: 2253-2261Google Scholar, 32Guyader M. Kiyokawa E. Abrami L. Turelli P. Trono D. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 10356-10364Google Scholar). On the other hand, Blumenthal and co-workers (33Viard M. Parolini I. Sargiacomo M. Fecchi K. Ramoni C. Ablan S. Ruscetti F.W. Wang J.M. Blumenthal R. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 11584-11595Google Scholar) have shown that depletion of cholesterol from receptors-bearing target cell membranes affects the lateral association of fusion protein-receptors complexes believed to be important for activating fusion but does not inhibit the fusion event itself given adequate expression of receptors. Together, these findings delineate the basic membrane demands that the HIV-1 fusion reaction must meet: a highly ordered, cholesterol-rich viral envelope, and a less ordered target membrane that does not require cholesterol. Recent findings, identifying exposed regions of the gp41 ectodomain as being responsible for the process of membrane merger up to and including initial pore formation (27Markosyan R.M. Cohen F.S. Melikyan G.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 926-938Google Scholar) prompt specific evaluation of how the ectodomain interacts with and perturbs membranes. This study addresses the specificity to which the C- and N-terminal subdomains destabilize membranes either enriched in or devoid of cholesterol. We mimic the structural organization of the PHI through two separate fragments: the C-terminal subdomain (C56) is composed of both the CHR and the IFP, whereas the N-terminal subdomain (N70) includes both the NHR and FP. Our results suggest that C- and N-terminal subdomains are specific in their mode of action with the N-subdomain as a potent fusogen toward cholesterol-free membranes and the C-subdomain as superior in perturbing cholesterol-rich membranes. For the membrane bound C56, the CHR contributes α-helical structure, which may explain both the enhancement in lipid mixing of C56 relative to C20 (IFP) as well as the enhanced inhibitory effect of C56 compared with C34. Materials—Rink-amide methylbenzhydrylamine resin and 9-Fmoc amino acids were purchased from Calbiochem-Nova-Biochem AG (Laufelfingen, Switzerland). Other reagents used for peptide synthesis included trifluoroacetic acid (Sigma), piperidine (Merck), N,N-diisopropylethylamine (Sigma), N-hydroxybenzotriazole hydrate (Aldrich), 2-(1H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate, and dimethylformamide (peptide synthesis grade, BioLab) were purchased from Sigma. Egg phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylserine, egg sphingomyelin (Spm), cholesterol (extra pure), and lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) were purchased from Sigma as well. 5- and 6-([(4-chloromethyl)benzoyl]-amino)tetramethylrhodamine (CMTMR) and calcein-AM were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). All of the additional reagents were of analytical grade. Buffers were prepared using double glass-distilled water. Peptide Synthesis—The peptides were synthesized by the Fmoc solid phase method on Rink-amide methylbenzhydrylamine resin using an ABI 433A automatic peptide synthesizer and then cleaved from the resin using trifluoroacetic acid:double-distilled water:TES at 18.5:1:0.5 (v/v). N70 was prepared as described previously (14Sackett K. Shai Y. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4678-4685Google Scholar). The peptides were purified by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography on C4 reverse-phase Vydac semi-preparative and analytic columns to >98% homogeneity. The purified peptides were homogenous (>98%) by analytical high pressure liquid chromatography. The peptides were further subjected to amino acid analysis and to Platform LCZ electrospray mass spectroscopy to confirm their composition and molecular weight. Preparation of Large Unilamellar Vesicles (LUV)—The lipids were dissolved in a 2:1 (v/v) mixture of chloroform:methanol and then dried under a stream of nitrogen while rotating, thereby depositing a thin film of lipids on the wall of a glass vial. Excess solvent was removed by overnight lyophilization, and the lipid films were stored under argon to prevent oxidation. Dry lipid films were suspended in PBS buffer by vortexing to produce large multilamellar vesicles. The lipids suspension was further processed with five cycles of freezing and thawing followed by extrusion through polycarbonate membranes initially with 1-μm diameter pores and then with 0.2-μm diameter pores to generate LUV. LUV were used within 24 h following preparation. Peptide-induced Lipid Mixing—Lipid mixing of LUV was measured using a fluorescence-probe dilution assay (34Struck D.K. Hoekstra D. Pagano R.E. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 4093-4099Google Scholar). LUV containing 0.6 molar % each of NBD-PE as the energy donor and Rho-PE as the energy acceptor were prepared in PBS as described above. A 1:4 mixture of labeled and unlabeled vesicles (110 μm total phospholipid concentration) was suspended in 400 μl of PBS, and a small volume of peptide from a stock solution was added. The increase in NBD fluorescence at 530 nm (8-nm slit) was monitored with the excitation set at 467 nm (8-nm slit). The fluorescence intensity before the addition of the peptide was referred to as 0% lipid mixing, and the fluorescence intensity upon addition of reduced Triton X-100 (0.05% (v/v)) was referred to as 100% lipid mixing. All of the fluorescence measurements were done on an SLM-AMINCO Bowman series 2 luminescence spectrometer. ATR-FTIR Measurements—Spectra were obtained with a Bruker Equinox 55 FTIR spectrometer equipped with a deuterated triglyceride sulfate detector that was coupled to an ATR device. For each spectrum, 150 scans were collected with a resolution of 4 cm-1. Samples were prepared as described previously (35Gazit E. Miller I.R. Biggin P.C. Sansom M.S. Shai Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 860-870Google Scholar). A mixture of lipids (0.5 mg) alone or with peptide was deposited on a ZnSe horizontal ATR prism (80 × 7 mm). Prior to preparing the samples, the trifluoroacetate (CF3COO-) counterions, which strongly associate with the peptide, were replaced with chloride ions by washing in 0.1 m HCl and lyophilization. This eliminated the strong C = O stretching absorption band near 1673 cm-1 (36Surewicz W.K. Mantsch H.H. Chapman D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 389-394Google Scholar). Peptides were dissolved in MeOH, and lipids were dissolved in a 1:2 MeOH/CH2Cl2 mixture. Lipid-peptide mixtures or lipids alone were spread with a Teflon bar on the ZnSe prism and then dried under vacuum for 15 min. Polarized and non-polarized spectra were recorded. For analysis of the peptide amide I contribution alone, the non-polarized spectra of the pure phospholipids were subtracted from that of the peptide + phospholipid sample. For analysis of phospholipid acyl chain order, symmetric (∼2853 cm-1) and antisymmetric (∼2922 cm-1) stretching vibrations were analyzed of spectra following polarization (both parallel and perpendicular). The ratio between parallel and perpendicular polarized absorbance maxima for these two stretching vibrations was compared for samples of phospholipid alone and phospholipid + peptide. The background for each spectrum was a clean ZnSe prism. The multilayers formed, composed of PC:Spm:chol at 1:1:1 molar ratio, produce significant background signal in the amide I region due to absorbance from the amide bond in sphingomyelin. Procuring an accurate peptide amide I signal necessitated the use of relatively high peptide:lipid molar ratios (1:50). For measurements conducted of peptides in PC multilayers, a peptide:lipid molar ratio of 1:100 was used. Deuteration of the sample was achieved by introducing an excess of deuterium oxide (2H2O) into a chamber placed on top the ZnSe prism in the ATR casting and incubating for 5 min before acquisition of spectra. The H/D exchange was considered complete due to a complete shift of the amide II band. Any contribution of 2H2O vapor to the absorbance spectra near the amide I peak region was eliminated by subtraction of the spectra of pure lipids equilibrated with 2H2O under the same conditions. ATR-FTIR Data Analysis—Prior to curve fitting, a straight base line passing through the ordinates at 1700 and 1600 cm-1 was subtracted. To resolve overlapping bands, the spectra were processed using PEAK-FIT™ (Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA) software. Second- and fourth-derivative spectra were calculated to identify the positions of the component bands in the spectra. These wave numbers were used as initial parameters for curve fitting with Gaussian component peaks. Positions, bandwidths, and amplitudes of the peaks were varied until: (i) the resulting bands shifted by no more than 2 cm-1 from the initial parameters; (ii) all of the peaks had reasonable half-widths (<20–25 cm-1); and (iii) good agreement between the calculated sum of all of the components and the experimental spectra was achieved (r2 > 0.999). The relative contents of different secondary structure elements were estimated by dividing the areas of individual peaks, which were assigned to a particular secondary structure, by the whole area of the resulting amide I band. The results of two independent experiments were averaged. Analysis of the Polarized ATR-FTIR Spectra—The ATR electric fields of incident light were calculated as shown in Equation 1 (37Ishiguro R. Matsumoto M. Takahashi S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4976-4983Google Scholar), Ex=2cosθsin2θ-n212(1-n212)[(1+n212)sin2θ-n212]Ey=2cosθ1-n212Ez=2sinθcosθ(1-n212)[(1+n212)sin2θ-n212](Eq. 1) where θ is the angle of a light beam to the prism normal at the point of reflection (45°) and n21 = n2/n1 (n1 and n2 are the refractive indices of ZnSe taken as 2.4 and of the membrane sample taken as 1.5, respectively). Under these conditions, Ex, Ey, and Ez are 1.09, 1.81, and 2.32, respectively. The electric field components together with the dichroic ratio (RATR, defined as the ratio between absorption of parallel to a membrane plane, Ap, and perpendicularly polarized incident light, As) are used to calculate the orientation order parameter, f, by the following formula shown in Equation 2 (38Tatulian S.A. Tamm L.K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 496-507Google Scholar), f=2(Ex2-RATREy2+Ez2)h(3cos2α-1)(Ex2-RATREy2-2Ez2)(Eq. 2) where h is the fraction of transition dipoles in the molecule that belong to the ordered structure of the absorption band whose order parameter has been calculated. Lipid order parameters were obtained from the symmetric (∼2853 cm-1) and antisymmetric (∼2922 cm-1) lipid-stretching modes using the same equations, setting α = 90° (37Ishiguro R. Matsumoto M. Takahashi S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4976-4983Google Scholar). The average angle of orientation of the helical axis with respect to the bilayer normal, γ, is calculated based on the order parameter with the formula shown in Equation 3 (38Tatulian S.A. Tamm L.K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 496-507Google Scholar), f=1/2(3(cos2γ)-1)(Eq. 3) Dye Transfer Fusion Assay—Peptide inhibition of cell-cell fusion was assayed by monitoring the redistribution of a water-soluble fluorescent probe from the effector cell to the target cell upon their co-incubation with each other. SupT target cells were labeled with calcein-AM at 10 μm for 60 min at 37 °C and then washed and resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium. The plated HeLa cells infected with the recombinant vaccinia construct VPE16, which expresses HIV-1 IIIB gp120–41 (4Earl P.L. Moss B. Doms R.W. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2047-2055Google Scholar), were labeled with CMTMR at 20 μm for 1 h at 37 °C, washed several times, and combined with the target cells (1:3 effector-target cell ratio). Different concentrations of peptides, dissolved in PBS buffer, were then added. The cells were co-cultured for 2 h at 37 °C in 24-well plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA). C34 and C56 inhibition were tested in parallel on the same day. These experiments were repeated several times, and the general trend was found to be the same. Both phase and fluorescent images were collected using an Olympus IX70 with a ×20 objective lens and a CCD camera (Princeton Instruments, Trenton, NJ). A 82,000 optical filter cube (Chroma Technology Corporation., Brattleboro, VT) was used for the excitation of calcein (494/517) and CMTMR (541/565). Three images per well were collected, and dye transfer from the donor to the acceptor cell was counted via Metamorph software (Universal Imaging, West Chester, PA). The scoring of fusion events was conducted as described previously (22Munoz-Barroso I. Durell S. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Blumenthal R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 315-323Google Scholar). CD Spectroscopy—The CD spectra of the different peptides (10 μm)in 1% LPC were determined in an Aviv 202 spectropolarimeter in a quartz optical cell with a 1-mm path length at 20 °C in the range of 193–260 nm (1-nm steps, 10-s averaging). The spectrum of 1% LPC was subtracted from the spectra of the peptides in LPC. The C- and N-terminal Subdomains Potently Induce Lipid Mixing of LUV either Enriched in or Devoid of Cholesterol, Respectively—To compare the specificity with which peptides from the C- and N-terminal subdomains perturb membranes, we tested the ability of C20, C56, FP33, and N70 (refer to Fig. 1) to induce lipid mixing of LUV designed to reproduce the disparate membrane order conditions on the virion and target cell surface (following cholesterol depletion) (Figs. 2 and 3). PC LUV were chosen to mimic the cholesterol-depleted target cell surface because of their zwitterionic nature and the fact that the outer leaflet of blood cell membranes is enriched in PC and sphingomyelin (reviewed in Ref. 39Zachowski A. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 1-14Google Scholar), both of which share the same head group. PC alone does not self-organize into ordered versus unordered regions and therefore represents a homogenous membrane surface (40Silvius J.R. Biophys. J. 2003; 85: 1034-1045Google Scholar). To reproduce the well ordered viral membrane surface, we chose a lipid composition based on the work of Aloia et al. (8Aloia R.C. Tian H. Jensen F.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5181-5185Google Scholar) who quantified the lipid composition of virions and target cells. For the viral envelope, they identify the dominant outer leaflet choline lipids PC and Spm to be in approximate equal abundance and show an approximate 1:1 ratio of cholesterol to phospholipid. Accordingly, we model the virion surface with a PC:Spm:chol (1:1:1) lipid composition. It has been shown that cholesterol promotes lateral organization in membranes at physiologic temperatures when combined with Spm (40Silvius J.R. Biophys. J. 2003; 85: 1034-1045Google Scholar). Organization of raft structures follows the association of Spm and cholesterol. In in vitro vesicle preparations of Spm and cholesterol, optimal inhomogeneity in lipid dispersions occurs with 25–40 molar % cholesterol (40Silvius J.R. Biophys. J. 2003; 85: 1034-1045Google Scholar). Therefore, in addition to modeling the virion lipid surface, PC:Spm: chol (1:1:1) vesicles have a strong propensity to spontaneously form ordered regions.Fig. 3Dose dependence of lipid mixing of PC:Spm:Chol (1:1:1) LUV induced by the different peptides.

Fig. 2 confirms our previous finding that N70 is a potent fusogen toward PC LUV, reiterating the important role that the NHR plays in membrane destabilization (14Sackett K. Shai Y. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4678-4685Google Scholar). In addition, we checked the ability of the N-terminal subdomain to disrupt vesicles whose lipid composition models that found in the outer leaflet of blood cells (Spm:PC:PE:chol:phosphatidylserine at a 11:10:4:3:1 ratio (reviewed in Refs. 39Zachowski A.

https://openalex.org/W2100686094,"In addition to suggesting that fatty acids are endogenous ligands, our recent crystal structure of HNF-4α showed an unusual degree of structural flexibility in the AF-2 domain (helix α12). Although every molecule contained a fatty acid within its ligand binding domain, one molecule in each homodimer was in an open inactive conformation with α12 fully extended and colinear with α10. By contrast, the second molecule in each homodimer was in a closed conformation with α12 folded against the body of the domain in what is widely considered to be the active state. This indicates that although ligand binding is necessary, it is not sufficient to induce an activating structural transition in HNF-4α as is commonly suggested to occur for nuclear receptors. To further assess potential mechanisms of activation, we have solved a structure of human HNF-4α bound to both fatty acid ligand and a coactivator sequence derived from SRC-1. The mode of coactivator binding is similar to that observed for other nuclear receptors, and in this case, all of the molecules adopt the closed active conformation. We conclude that for HNF-4α, coactivator rather than ligand binding locks the active conformation.

As a member of the nuclear receptor family of transcription factors, HNF-4α can be separated into DNA and ligand binding domains (LBD). 1The abbreviations used are: LBD, ligand binding domain; PDB, Protein Data Bank; PEPCK, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase; NR, nuclear receptor; FFA, free fatty acid; RXR, retinoid X receptor. The HNF-4α LBD (residues 140–368) contains distinctive features such as a hydrophobic ligand binding pocket, a dimerization interface, and an AF-2 transactivation domain (residues 360–368) (1Dhe-Paganon S. Duda K. Iwamoto M. Chi Y.I. Shoelson S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37973-37976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). HNF-4α expression is highest in the liver, kidney, and the small and large intestines and lower but detectable in pancreatic β cells and the stomach (2Sladek F.M. Zhong W.M. Lai E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 2353-2365Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar). HNF-4α plays critical roles in nutrient transport and metabolism. Its target genes include PEPCK, a major enzyme in the gluconeogenic pathway (3Hall R.K. Scott D.K. Noisin E.L. Lucas P.C. Granner D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5527-5535Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), as well as Apo-AI, Apo-II, Apo-IV, Apo-B, Apo-CII, Apo-III, and Apo-E, which are involved in lipid transport and metabolism (4Ladias J.A.

Development. 1997; 124: 279-287Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Full activity is achieved through the interaction of HNF-4α homodimers with DNA and coactivators, including SRC-1, PGC-1, and GRIP-1. These coactivators contain nuclear receptor (NR) boxes comprised of LXXLL motifs. The sequence on either side of the NR boxes imparts specificity to binding that allows the same coactivator to have different affinities for different nuclear receptors. The ability of NRs to form various coactivator complexes provides a mechanism for activating discrete transcriptional processes (9Torchia J. Rose D.W. Inostroza J. Kamei Y. Westin S. Glass C.K.

HNF-4α has also been linked to nutrient metabolism through interactions with the coactivator PGC-1, potentially providing a driving force for gluconeogenesis (12Rhee J. Inoue Y. Yoon J.C. Puigserver P. Fan M. Gonzalez F.J. Spiegelman B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4012-4017Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Mutations in hnf-4α are associated with a rare monogenic form of diabetes referred to as MODY1 (maturity-onset diabetes of the young). MODY1 patients are characterized by an insulin secretion defect in the face of normal insulin sensitivity (13Malecki M.T. Yang Y. Antonellis A. Curtis S. Warram J.H. Krolewski A.S. Diabetes Med. 1999; 16: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Recent genetic studies have linked polymorphisms in or near the islet-specific P2 promoter of hnf-4α to type 2 diabetes (14Love-Gregory L.D. Wasson J. Ma J. Jin C.H. Glaser B. Suarez B.K. Permutt M.A. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 1134-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 15Silander K. Mohlke K.L. Scott L.J. Peck E.C. Hollstein P. Skol A.D. Jackson A.U. Deloukas P. Hunt S.

Diabetes. 2004; 53: 1141-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), suggesting that reduced HNF-4α activity in pancreatic β cells might also be associated with and possibly predispose to the development of this prevalent disorder. Nuclear receptor LBDs are found in two distinct conformations. The difference between forms is in the position of helix α12, often referred to as the AF-2 domain. In the first conformation, α12 is extended colinearly with helices α10 and α11, leaving the ligand binding pocket accessible and the LBD in what is referred to as the “open” conformation. Because this structure does not allow the binding of coactivator molecules, it is also considered to be the inactive form. In the second conformation, helix α12 folds back onto the LBD to seal off the ligand binding pocket. Because this “closed” form interacts with coactivators, it is considered to be the active state of the NR. Structural comparisons between unliganded (apodomain) and ligand-bound and coactivator-bound forms of various NRs have led to the supposition that it is ligand binding that activates NRs by converting molecules in the open inactive conformation to an all closed active state (16Egea P.F. Mitschler A. Rochel N. Ruff M. Chambon P. Moras D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2592-2601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Renaud J.P. Moras D. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1748-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Our previously reported crystal structure of HNF-4α challenges this hypothesis (1Dhe-Paganon S. Duda K. Iwamoto M. Chi Y.I. Shoelson S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37973-37976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). One major finding from both the HNF-4α and HNF-4γ structures was the serendipitous presence of fatty acids in their LBDs, suggesting that these might be endogenous ligands (1Dhe-Paganon S. Duda K. Iwamoto M. Chi Y.I. Shoelson S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37973-37976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 18Wisely G. Miller A. Davis R. Thornquest A. Johnson R. Spitzer T. Sefler A. Shearer B. Moore J. Miller A. Willson T. Williams S. Structure. 2002; 10: 1225-1234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). However, only half of the fatty acid-bound molecules in the HNF-4α structure adopted the closed conformation expected for the activated state. The second molecule in each homodimer was in a conformation expected for the inactive state with helix α12 fully extended and colinear with helix α10. This finding suggested that fatty acid binding might be necessary but not sufficient for activating HNF-4α. To better understand the structural mechanism for ligand- and coactivator-mediated activation of HNF-4α, we have crystallized its LBD bound to both fatty acid ligand and a coactivator peptide sequence derived from SRC-1. Protein Production and Crystallization—The protein boundaries for expression of the human HNF-4α LBD were defined by our previous structure of the rat apodomain (1Dhe-Paganon S. Duda K. Iwamoto M. Chi Y.I. Shoelson S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37973-37976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) (the LBDs of rat and human HNF-4α are 97% identical). DNA encoding the LBD of human HNF-4α (residues 140–382) was subcloned into the pET 28a vector (Novagen) by PCR. Protein was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) (Invitrogen) cells and isolated from lysates using Talon cobalt affinity resin (Clontech). The His6 affinity tag was cleaved using bovine thrombin (10 units/ml), and the protein was further purified by ion-exchange chromatography (Mono Q fast protein liquid chromatography). A 3-fold molar excess of SRC-1 peptide (SSLTERHKILHRLLQEGSPS, residues 681–700) was incubated with the protein for 1 h at 4 °C prior to concentration (15 mg/ml). Crystals were obtained at room temperature by the vapor diffusion method in 20-μl drops containing equal volumes of protein/peptide complex and crystallization buffer (0.1 m Hepes, pH 7.0, 0.7 m sodium/potassium tartrate and 0.01 m dithiothreitol). Crystals belonging to the space group P41212 reached maximum dimensions of 0.3 × 0.2 × 0.2 mm within 5 days. Data Collection and Structure Determination—Diffraction data were collected at beamline X12C of the National Synchrotron Light Source (Brookhaven, NY). Oscillation images (every 1°) were collected at 100 K, and the data were processed using the DENZO HKL software package (19Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). The structure was determined by molecular replacement using the program MOLREP (20Hu J. Liu J. Ghirlando R. Saltiel A.R. Hubbard S.R. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1379-1389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and our previous structure of HNF-4α in complex with fatty acid as a search model (1Dhe-Paganon S.

Each asymmetric unit contains one ternary complex comprising the LBD of human HNF-4α, one fatty acid, and one SRC-1 peptide. The initial R value was 0.48 with a correlation coefficient of 0.57. The subsequent σ -weighted 2Fo-Fc map after rigid body refinement clearly revealed density corresponding to the bound SRC-1 peptide that was not present in the search model. The model was refined using an amplitude-based maximum-likelihood target in the program CNS (21Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. Delano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J.

It adopts the canonical nuclear receptor LBD fold containing nine α helices and two β strands (Fig. 1A). The helices were numbered according to conventional NR nomenclature as we had previously numbered the helices in the rodent protein (1Dhe-Paganon S. Duda K. Iwamoto M. Chi Y.I. Shoelson S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37973-37976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Helix α2, which is variably present in NR LBDs, is not present in HNF-4α. α6 consists of only one helical turn, and because α10 and α11 are contiguous, this helix is referred to simply as α10. The nine α helices are organized into three layers within the helical sandwich. Helices α4, α5, α8, and α9 form the central layer. Helices α1 and α3 comprise the outer layer at one side of the central layer, and helix α10 forms the opposite outer layer. Helix α12 is separate from α10, consistent with the HNF-4α LBD being in the active state and bound to coactivator. The dimerization interface, comprising residues from α9 and α10, lies along a plane of 2-fold crystallographic symmetry. At 2.1-Å resolution, the amino acid side chains are well defined in the electron density map with the exception of side chains from residues of the α1-α3 loop. There are two obvious differences between the structures of the binary complex of the FFA-bound rat domain (Fig. 1B) reported earlier (1Dhe-Paganon S. Duda K. Iwamoto M. Chi Y.I. Shoelson S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37973-37976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) and the ternary complex of the human domain reported here (Fig. 1A). The first is the presence of the SRC-1 peptide in one structure and not the other, which provides the opportunity to determine the effects of coactivator binding both on global structure and more specifically on the orientation of α12 (the AF-2 domain). The second difference, linked to the first, addresses the issue of open and closed configurations and what they mean. The LBD adopts two distinct conformations in the binary complex, despite both molecules being bound to fatty acid ligand (Fig. 1, B and C) (1Dhe-Paganon S. Duda K. Iwamoto M. Chi Y.I. Shoelson S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37973-37976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The first molecule is in an open conformation in which α10 and α12 are contiguous and colinear. This long helix is fully extended. The second molecule of each homodimer adopts a closed conformation with α12 situated against the body of the LBD. In the closed state, a hydrophobic patch on α12 (Leu-360, Leu-361, Met-364, and Leu-365) affixes it via hydrophobic interactions to the body of the domain. Residues from α3 (Met-182, Ala-183, Leu-186, Leu-187, Leu-189, and Val-190) and α4 (Leu-211, Ala-215, Gly-216, and Leu-219) form a complementary patch on the body of the domain. Both molecules in the ternary LBD complex (HNF-4α·FFA·SRC-1) adopt identical closed conformations (Fig. 1A). This structure is indistinguishable from that of the molecule in the closed conformation of the binary complex (Fig. 1C), yielding an root mean square deviation value of 0.57 Å when all of the Cα atoms of the two structures are superimposed. We have concluded from these comparisons that ligand (FFA) binding is conformationally permissive, because it facilitates the formation of the activated closed state but does not lock it. Coactivator binding, on the other hand, is restrictive because it apparently locks FFA-bound HNF-4α into the activated closed state. HNF-4α/Fatty Acid Interactions—X-ray crystal structures of rat HNF-4α and human HNF-4γ indicated that both of these proteins bind fatty acids as natural ligands (1Dhe-Paganon S. Duda K. Iwamoto M. Chi Y.I. Shoelson S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37973-37976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 18Wisely G. Miller A. Davis R. Thornquest A. Johnson R. Spitzer T. Sefler A. Shearer B. Moore J. Miller A. Willson T. Williams S. Structure. 2002; 10: 1225-1234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Because fatty acids incorporated spontaneously into the ligand binding pockets of the proteins during bacterial expression and because it was not possible to remove the fatty acids without at least partially denaturing the proteins, we had hypothesized that ligands, presumably fatty acids, might be critical to the stably folded domains (1Dhe-Paganon S. Duda K. Iwamoto M. Chi Y.I. Shoelson S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37973-37976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 18Wisely G. Miller A. Davis R. Thornquest A.

Our new structure shows that human HNF-4α similarly sequesters bacterial fatty acids during protein production. Fatty acids are once again present in all of the molecules of the structure, despite not having been added intentionally. The ligand binding pocket forms a narrow channel that is lined almost exclusively with side chains of hydrophobic residues (Fig. 2). The side chain of Arg-226 at the base of the binding pocket is the exception. Considerably smaller than the ligand binding pockets of other reported NR LBDs, HNF-4α has a cavity area of 370 Å3 as calculated by the program Voidoo (23Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 178-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar). This is the approximate molecular volume of a long chain fatty acid. The fatty acids bound to our structure are anchored in the ligand binding pocket via an interaction between the fatty acid headgroup and the side chain of Arg-226. Both of the oxygen molecules in the fatty acid headgroup interact with the arginine guanidinium group, and one oxygen interacts as well with the backbone NH group of Gly-237. The ligand interaction is further stabilized by hydrophobic and Van der Waals interactions between the fatty acid carbon chain and residues lining the pocket. Residues that participate in these interactions include Ile-175, Val-178, Cys-179, Met-182, Leu-219, Leu-220, Arg-223, Leu-236, Met-252, Val-255, Ile-259, Met-342, Ile-346, Ile-349, and Ile-357 (Fig. 2). Because our previous structure was of the binary FFA-bound LBD complex and our new structure is of the ternary HNF-4α·FFA·SRC-1 complex, we are in a position to compare ligand binding pockets in the absence and presence of bound coactivator. Improved electron density for the ternary complex allowed visualization of 14 carbons of the fatty acid, as opposed to the 12 carbons seen in the binary complex (1Dhe-Paganon S. Duda K. Iwamoto M. Chi Y.I. Shoelson S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37973-37976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Improved electron density similarly facilitated the identification of additional water molecules in the ligand binding pocket of the ternary complex. Otherwise, there appear to be no significant differences (Fig. 2). As noted previously, backbone Cα atoms are superimposable. Amino acid side chains that line the pockets are in similar positions in the two structures and maintain the same interactions, including the salt bridge between the side chain of Arg-226 and the fatty acid head. The trivial differences in fatty acid binding between the two structures can thus be accounted for by the enhanced resolution of the ternary structure, solved at a 2.1-Å resolution as opposed to a 2.8-Å resolution. HNF-4α/SRC-1 Interactions—As a recurring structural theme for nuclear receptors, bound coactivators form α-helices with hydrophobic side chains of the LXXLL motif directed inward to interact with the LBDs (24Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar). The HNF-4α·FFA·SRC-1 complex recapitulates this mode of interaction (Fig. 3). Of 20 residues in the crystallized SRC-1 peptide, 14 at the carboxyl terminus are well defined. The amino-terminal six residues are not visualized in the electron density map. Eight residues (ILHRLLQEG) encompassing the LXXLL motif form >2 full turns of an α-helix. The HNF-4α/SRC-1 interaction is dominated by hydrophobic interactions involving the leucine residues of the LXXLL motif and the canonical “charge clamp” created by hydrogen bonds between backbone atoms and the side chains of invariant residues Glu-363 of α12 and Lys-194 of α3. The interaction with Gly-363 requires that α12 be folded into place in the ligand binding pocket and thus mandates that coactivator binding occur only with the closed LBD conformation. The hydrophobic face of the LXXLL helix is packed into a hydrophobic pocket created by residues in α3 (Leu-187, Val-190, and Lys-194), α3-α4 loop (Phe-199), α4 (Leu-211), and α12 (Glu-363). The charge clamp orients the LXXLL motif into place, which explains why modes of interactions are well conserved between NRs and coactivators. Subtler interactions are thought to govern specificity and relative affinity of a given NR for different coactivator LXXLL motifs. These may be mediated by flanking residues at the carboxyl-terminal end of the LXXLL helix (25McInerney E.M. Rose D.W. Flynn S.E. Westin S. Mullen T.M. Krones A. Inostroza J. Torchia J. Nolte R.T.

In our structure, the amino-terminal flanking region of the SRC-1 peptide is disordered, whereas the carboxyl-terminal flanking region is well defined but lacks specific interactions with the LBD.

Chem. 2002; 277: 37973-37976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), whereas the SRC-1-bound LBD adopts only the closed conformation, α12 does not appear to be a ligand-dependent switch that upon ligand binding triggers a structural rearrangement, providing a surface for coactivator binding (27Renaud J.P. Rochel N. Ruff M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 378: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar, 28Nolte R.T. Wisely G.B. Westin S. Cobb J.E. Lambert M.H. Kurokawa R. Rosenfeld M.G. Willson T.M. Glass C.K. Milburn M.V. Nature. 1998; 395: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (1700) Google Scholar). Moreover, α12 does not participate in direct interactions with the ligand as is seen in the interactions of other NRs with many synthetic ligands. Therefore, it appears that both ligand and co-activator binding are required to lock HNF-4α in the closed and active state. Comparisons between Unliganded NRs and Binary and Ternary Complexes—The first apodomain structure to be determined was that of RXR (29Bourguet W. Ruff M. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 375: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar). Comparisons between the apodomain and structures of the binary ligand/RXR and ternary ligand/coactivator/RXR complexes formed the basis for developing a global theory regarding structural determinants in NR activation. The theory predicted that apodomains are open and that ligand binding induces a conformational transition that stabilizes a closed active state with α12 (AF-2) folded against the body of the domain to form a coactivator binding surface (16Egea P.F. Mitschler A. Rochel N. Ruff M. Chambon P. Moras D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2592-2601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Renaud J.P. Moras D. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1748-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The theory further predicted that although coactivator binding might further stabilize the closed conformation, it would not produce additional conformational changes. Because HNF-4α does not fit this scheme, we have re-examined the many structures that have now been solved. Of the four published apodomain structures (29Bourguet W. Ruff M. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H.

This indicates that, in the absence of ligand, α12 is conformationally flexible and can adopt both open and closed configurations. The predominance of the closed form seen in structural studies, in addition to data from thermal melt studies, suggests that the closed form of the apodomain may be energetically favored (33Watkins R.E.

LBDs in previously reported structures of binary ligand-bound complexes adopt the active closed conformation, supporting the theory that ligand binding serves as the activating switch. However, the finding that binary HNF-4α·FFA complexes adopt both open and closed conformations in our recently solved structure runs counter to the theory. In reexamining the structural basis for activation, found that many endogenous ligands in published structures do not interact with α12 directly (16Egea P.F. Mitschler A. Rochel N. Ruff M. Chambon P.

We conclude that although natural ligands undoubtedly stabilize the closed configuration, they may not lock the LBD into the active form. By contrast, ligands with larger appendages that do interact with α12 (36Kauppi B. Jakob C. Farnegardh M. Yang J. Ahola H. Alarcon M. Calles K. Engstrom O. Harlan J. Muchmore S. Ramqvist A.K.

Structures of ternary ligand/coactivator/LBD complexes are profiled in Fig. 4C. The LBDs in each of these structures and in the ternary HNF-4α structure presented in this paper all adopt the active closed conformation. The coactivator charge clamp located on either side of the LXXLL motif interacts directly with α12 in each of these structures. Thus, coactivator binding requires that the LBD be closed and, because the LBD must remain closed as long as the coactivator is bound, this essentially “locks” the LBD in an active conformation. We conclude for HNF-4α that although ligand binding and coactivator binding both stabilize the LBD, it is coactivator binding that locks it in the active state. As far as we can tell from available structures of other LBDs bound to endogenous ligands and coactivators, the same holds, i.e. the binding of natural ligands and coactivators stabilize the LBD but coactivator binding locks the active state. Synthetic ligands with bulky appendages that interact with α12 may have the added ability to lock LBDs in the active conformation.

Globally, Dengue virus is an important human pathogen, with perhaps half of the world's population geographically at risk of infection, and with an estimated 50–100 million new infections, 500,000 hospitalizations, and 25,000 deaths annually (1Halstead S.B. Science. 1988; 239: 476-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar, 2Jacobs M.G. Young P.R. Curr. Opin. Infect. Dis. 1998; 11: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 3Gubler D.J.

Dengue virus belongs to the flavivirus genus, one of three genera within the Flaviviridae family of viruses, which include pestiviruses and hepaciviruses (6Ruggli N. Rice C.M. Adv. Virus Res. 1999; 53: 183-207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Flavivirus virions consist of a single positive stranded RNA genome of ∼11 kb (7Rice C.M. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. 3rd Ed. Lippencott-Raven, Philadelphia, PA1996: 931-959Google Scholar). Flavivirus RNA encodes a single large polypeptide NH2-C-prM-E-NS1-NS2A-NS2B-NS3-NS4A-NS5-COOH (7Rice C.M. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. 3rd Ed.

Brandt W.E. Dalrymple J.M. Schlesinger R.W. The Togaviruses: Biology, Structure and Replication. Academic Press, New York1980: 503-529Crossref Google Scholar). The remaining proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) are non-structural and are involved in various aspects of viral replication (7Rice C.M. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. 3rd Ed. Lippencott-Raven, Philadelphia, PA1996: 931-959Google Scholar). Flavivirus NS1 proteins exhibit a high degree of sequence homology (11Mackow E. Makino Y. Zhao B. Zhang Y.-M. Markoff I. Buckler-White A. Guiler M. Chanock R. Lai C.-J. Virology. 1987; 159: 217-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), and contain no amino- or carboxyl-terminal membrane anchoring sequences (12Speight G. Coia A. Parker M.D. Westaway E.G. J.

However, the precise roles of NS1 in the flavivirus life cycle remain unclear. Immature NS1 exists as a hydrophilic monomer in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen, and is rapidly processed into a stable hydrophobic non-covalent homodimer, with the subunits interacting via their carboxyl termini (14Winkler G. Randolph V.B. Cleaves G.R. Ryan T.E. Stollar V. Virology. 1988; 162: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 15Parrish C.R. Woo W.S. Wright P.J. Arch. Virol. 1991; 117: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). NS1 exists predominantly in the dimeric form, which is associated with intracellular and cell surface membranes (16Winkler G. Maxwell S.E. Ruemmler C. Stoller V. Virology. 1989; 171: 302-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). A component of this cell surface association has been shown to be covalently linked via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor (17Jacobs M.G. Robinson P.J. Bletchly C. Mackenzie J.M. Young P.R. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1603-1610Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NS1 is also secreted from infected cells as a soluble, detergent-labile hexamer (18Flamand M. Megret F. Mathieu M. Lepault J. Rey F.A. Deubel V. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 6104-6110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Crooks A.J. Lee J.M. Easterbrook L.M. Tinofeev A.V. Stephenson J.R. J. Gen. Virol. 1994; 75: 3453-3460Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Maturation of NS1 involves N-linked glycosylation with Dengue virus NS1 from all four serotypes containing two conserved N-linked glycosylation sites. When expressed in mammalian cells the cell-associated form has both of these sites occupied by high mannose moieties, whereas the secreted form comprises complex glycans on one site (implying post-translational glycan processing in the Golgi) with the other remaining in a high mannose form. Other flavivirus NS1 proteins may contain an additional occupied site (14Winkler G. Randolph V.B. Cleaves G.R. Ryan T.E. Stollar V. Virology. 1988; 162: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 16Winkler G. Maxwell S.E. Ruemmler C. Stoller V. Virology. 1989; 171: 302-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Glycosylation of NS1 contributes to dimer stability and resultant membrane association because of increased hydrophobicity of the dimer (14Winkler G. Randolph V.B. Cleaves G.R. Ryan T.E. Stollar V. Virology. 1988; 162: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 20Pryor M.J. Wright P.J. J. Gen. Virol. 1994; 75: 1183-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Mutation of glycosylation sites has been shown to reduce viral RNA production and attenuate neurovirulence, suggesting a role for glycosylated NS1 dimers in viral RNA replication (20Pryor M.J.

Young P.R. J. Virol. Methods. 1996; 220: 232-240Google Scholar). NS1 dimers have been shown to interact with a number of other non-structural viral proteins and, via this association, with the viral RNA, and may be involved in assembly of the viral replicase complex and its localization to cytoplasmic membranes (23Muylaert I.A. Chambers T.J. Galler R. Rice C.M. Virology. 1996; 222: 159-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 26Muylaert I.R. Galler R. Rice C.M. J.

Virol. 1999; 73: 4611-4621Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NS1 also induces a protective host immune response, however, anti-NS1 antibodies do not function in a neutralizing capacity as NS1 is not present in flavivirus virions. It is likely that antibodies targeted to cell surface-associated NS1 potentiate complement mediated lysis of infected cells (29Schlesinger J.J. Brandriss M.W. Putnak J.R. Walsh E.E. J. Gen. Virol. 1990; 71: 593-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The importance of NS1 to the flavivirus life cycle and immune response makes it an attractive target for development of immune-based and structure/function-based antiviral therapeutics. Mature Dengue virus NS1 contains 352 amino acid residues in a base polypeptide of ∼40 kDa, with glycosylation increasing the apparent mass of the protein on SDS-PAGE (30Deubel V. Kinney R.M. Trent D.W. Virology. 1988; 165: 234-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Dengue virus NS1 contains 12 cysteine residues that are absolutely conserved among all flavivirus NS1 proteins (7Rice C.M. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. 3rd Ed. Lippencott-Raven, Philadelphia, PA1996: 931-959Google Scholar, 31Gibson C.A. Schlesinger J.J. Barrett A.D.T. Vaccine. 1988; 6: 7-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 32Wang P. Geng L. Qin E. Tu M. Zhao W. J. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2001; 17: 148-154Google Scholar), indicating their importance to the structure and function of the protein. The ability to form intramolecular disulfide linkages, particularly in the carboxyl terminus of the protein, appears to be crucial for NS1 dimer formation and subsequent trafficking within and secretion from the cell (21Pryor M.J. Wright P.J. Virology. 1993; 194: 769-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Disulfide-bonded NS1 monomers form non-covalent dimers that are stable to reduction but can be dissociated by heating, indicating that disulfide bonds are required to stabilize the structure of NS1 monomers for them to initially associate as dimers, but are not required for subsequent dimer stability (21Pryor M.J. Wright P.J. Virology. 1993; 194: 769-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In the absence of crystallographic data, the disulfide bond configuration and glycosylation pattern may provide valuable information on protein folding and hence facilitate refinement of molecular models (33Wedemeyer W.J. Welker E. Narayan M. Scheraga H.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4207-4216Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar, 34Pitt J.J. Da Silva E. Gorman J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6469-6478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The disulfide linkage arrangement of the NS1 protein of the related Murray Valley encephalitis (MVE) flavivirus has been partially described (35Blitvich B.J. Scanlon D. Shiell B.J. Mackenzie J.S. Pham K. Hall R.A. J. Gen. Virol. 2001; 82: 2251-2256Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) by a combination of tryptic cleavage, reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (rpHPLC) to isolate tryptic disulfide-linked peptides, and peptide analysis by Edman protein sequencing and/or electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). Using this technique, the disulfide linkage pattern of the 6 half-cystines from the amino terminus of MVE NS1 was determined to be C1/C2, C3/C4, and C5/C6. The disulfide linkage pattern of the 6 halfcystines from the carboxyl terminus was not determined, because of the lack of amenable tryptic cleavage sites in this region of the protein, and a consequent inability to obtain disulfide-linked tryptic peptides. Similar approaches were used in this study to confirm that the 3 amino-terminal disulfide linkages of Dengue virus NS1 were the same as for MVE NS1. In addition, pepsin and thermolysin were used to overcome the resistance of the carboxylterminal half of NS1 to tryptic digestion. Recombinant Dengue-2 virus NS1 was digested with these enzymes in buffers containing 50% H 182O to identify disulfide-linked peptide ions during mass spectrometry (MS), by virtue of their characteristic isotope profiles (36Wallis T.P. Pitt J.J. Gorman J.J. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 2251-2271Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 37Gorman J.J. Wallis T.P. Pitt J.J. Mass Spectrom. Rev. 2002; 21: 183-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Disulfide-linked peptides were isolated by size exclusion HPLC (secHPLC), further purified where necessary by capillary HPLC (capHPLC), and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS), matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization post-source decay (MALDI-PSD), and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization tandem mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS/MS). Together these data confirmed the previously determined disulfide linkages of the NS1 amino terminus and allowed determination of the remaining carboxyl-terminal disulfide linkages. These techniques enabled the definition of the complete disulfide linkage arrangement of Dengue virus NS1 and will contribute to the refinement of molecular models of this important protein. All reagents used in this study were of analytical or HPLC grade. Generation of Baculovirus Shuttle Vector Encoding NS1—C6/36 insect cells were infected with Dengue-2 virus strain PR159 at a multiplicity of infection of 1.0 and incubated at 32 °C for 3 days. Infected cell RNA was then extracted with RNazol B (Tel-Test Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was generated from this infected cell RNA extract using the NS1RBglII reverse primer 5′-ATTAGATCTCAGGCTGTGACCAAGGAGTTGAC-3′ (restriction sites are underlined), which was then used as template in a PCR employing this primer and NS1FBglII, 5′-ATTAGATCTCGGATAGTGGTTGCGTTGTGAGC-3′. The resulting PCR product comprised the full-length NS1 sequence flanked by BglII sites for cloning into the baculovirus shuttle vector pVTBac.His (generated and kindly provided by Dr. A. Khromykh). Cloning into the BglII site of this vector results in the expression by the final recombinant baculovirus of a fusion protein comprising a melittin signal sequence followed immediately by a 6-histidine tag and then the cloned insert. Such fusion proteins are targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum of infected insect cells for secretion as NH2-terminal His-tagged species. The PCR product was digested with BglII and ligated into BglII cut pVTBac.His. Selected recombinants were analyzed by automated sequence analysis to confirm correct orientation and sequence. Generation of Recombinant Baculovirus, and Expression and Purification of NS1—The pVTBac.His.NS1 shuttle vector was co-transfected with linearized (digested with Bsu36I) BacPak6 DNA (Clontech) into Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells according to the manufacturer's instructions. Recombinant baculoviruses liberated into the culture media were isolated by plaque analysis and blue-white selection using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal). Several plaque picks were amplified in culture and expression of NS1 assessed by immunoblot analysis using NS1-specific monoclonal antibodies with the final selected recombinant designated AcHis.D2.NS1. For high level recombinant protein expression, multiple 800-ml suspension cultures of HIGH FIVE (Invitrogen, Australia) cells in 2-liter flasks and at an initial concentration of 2 × 106 cells/ml were infected with AcHis.D2.NS1 virus at a multiplicity of infection of 1.0. Cells were grown in Hyclone HyQ SFX (Hyclone) serum-free insect cell media at 28 °C and shaken at 120 rpm on an orbital shaker. The cells were harvested and collected by centrifugation at 4,000 × g at 4 °C. Supernatant containing the secreted recombinant NS1 protein was filtered through a 0.2-μm Millipore filter unit (Millipore, Australia) at room temperature. The flow-through was then subjected to ultrafiltration and buffer exchange through two Vivaflow200 (Sartorius, Australia) units at room temperature. Final concentration and buffer exchange reduced the original harvest volumes that were in excess of 2 liters to 50 ml in a buffer comprising 1 mm imidazole, 0.15 m NaCl, and 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0. This concentrate was applied to a 2-ml nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Qiagen) column at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The column was washed with 20 mm imidazole, 0.15 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and then eluted with 100 mm imidazole, 0.15 m NaCl, and 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, at room temperature. Elution fractions were analyzed for purity by 15% SDS-PAGE, pooled, and concentrated through a Centricon spin column. The yield of purified AcHis.D2.NS1 was routinely ∼1 mg/liter. Pooled fractions of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-purified NS1 were concentrated by Vivaspin with 50-kDa molecular mass cut-off (Sartorius, Germany) at room temperature and passed through a 0.2-μm filter before loading onto a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) linked to an ÄKTA™ FPLC™ system (Amersham Biosciences). FPLC was performed in 20 mm Tris, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 8, with a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min at 4 °C. The column was calibrated in a separate run using High and Low FPLC™ standard molecular masses of 440, 232, 67, 43, 25, and 13.7 kDa (ferritin, catalase, bovine serum albumin, chymotrypsinogen A, and ribonuclease A, respectively, from Amersham Biosciences). The elution profile data were collected and analyzed by UNICORN™ version 2.31 (Amersham Biosciences). A standard plot was obtained by plotting the diffusion constant Kav, which was calculated from the equation Kav = (elution volume–void volume)/(column bed volume–void volume), versus log Mr (relative weight). The standard curve was computed using EXCEL™ (Microsoft) and a standard formula was generated as log Mr = –3.2991 × (Kav) + 3.2041. The elution volume for NS1 in this column was 11.53 ml, which was used to obtain a Kav = 0.2404 and an Mr of 257,600. The secreted recombinant NS1 was assayed against an extended panel of both linear sequence and conformational specific monoclonal antibodies (38Falconar A.K. Young P.R. J. Gen. Virol. 1991; 72: 961-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Each binding experiment was done in triplicate and the volume used per well was 50 μl. Immulon 4 microtiter plates were coated with 0.01 mg/ml Protein A (Pharmacia) in coating buffer overnight at 4 °C. After washing the plates with 0.05% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBST), 150 μl of blocking solution of 1% gelatin in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was added to each well and left at room temperature for 1 h. The plates were washed with PBST and then 0.018 mg/ml rabbit anti-mouse IgG (H&L) in PBST, 0.25% gelatin was allowed to bind to the Protein A for 1 h at 37 °C. Following four washes with PBST, relevant monoclonal antibodies (diluted 1/100 in PBST, 0.25% gelatin) were added and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. After removing monoclonal antibodies and washing, immunoaffinity purified 35S-labeled NS1 (2,000 cpm/well) in PBST, 0.25% gelatin was added to the plate and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The plate was then washed four times with PBST, and disruption solution (2% SDS, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol in SDS-PAGE sample buffer) was added to each well. After 10 min incubation at room temperature the disruption solution was removed individually from each well, added to 1.0 ml of scintillation fluid (Optiphase HiSafe II, Wallac), and counted in a scintillation counter (Amersham Biosciences). Trypsin Digestion—100 μg of NS1 was co-precipitated with 2 μg of trypsin (Roche modified sequencing grade) by addition of 10 volumes of methanol at –20 °C, and incubation at –20 °C overnight. The precipitate was pelleted by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C in a microcentrifuge, air dried, resuspended in 20 μl of freshly prepared 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0, in H 162O, and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. An additional 3 μg of trypsin was then added, to give a final trypsin:NS1 ratio of 1:20 (w/w), and the reaction incubated for a further 3 h at 37 °C. Digestion was terminated by storage at –20 °C. Tryptic subdigestions of isolated peptides were performed by resuspending dried peptides in 20 μl of 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate in H 162O containing trypsin at 5 ng/μl, and incubating at 37 °C for 3 h. Pepsin Digestion—100 μg of NS1 was precipitated by addition of 10 volumes of methanol at –20 °C, and incubation was at –20 °C overnight. The precipitate was pelleted and air dried as described above, and resuspended in 20 μl of buffer containing 100 mm formic acid, 100 mm acetic acid, 1 μg of pepsin (Sigma number P6887) and H 182O (97%, Enritech, diluted to give a final concentration of 50% (v/v)). Digestion was conducted at 37 °C for 3 h and terminated by storage at –20 °C or immediate secHPLC as described below. Thermolysin Digestion—100 μg of NS1 was precipitated, pelleted, and air dried as described above, and resuspended in 20 μl of buffer containing 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8, 10 mm CaCl2, 5 μg of thermolysin (Roche number 161586) and H 182O at a final concentration of 50% (v/v). Digestion was conducted at 65 °C for 2 h, and terminated by storage at –20 °C. All peptide chromatography was performed on Agilent 1100 liquid chromatography systems running Chemstation software, with peptide absorbance monitored at 214 nm. SecHPLC was performed using a 3.2 mm × 30-cm Superdex Peptide column (Amersham Biosciences). Peptides were separated over 90 min in 0.05% (v/v) aqueous trifluoroacetic acid in 6% (v/v) aqueous acetonitrile at 30 μl/min. Peptides were separated by rpHPLC using a 90-min gradient from 0.05% (v/v) aqueous trifluoroacetic acid to 0.045% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in 80% (v/v) aqueous acetonitrile. Flow rates of 40 and 5 μl/min were used where rpHPLC was performed using a 1 mm × 25-cm C18 column (Vydac) and 0.5 mm × 15-cm C18 capHPLC column (Zorbax), respectively. A constant temperature of 25 °C was used for capHPLC. To prevent unwanted exchange of 18O from labeled peptides with aqueous buffers, collected peptides were immediately freeze dried following chromatography using a centrifugal evaporator (Heto) and stored dried at –20 °C. MALDI-TOF-MS—Reduced and non-reduced samples were analyzed using a Bruker Reflex MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer in positive ion reflector mode. Data were acquired and analyzed using the Bruker XMass suite of software as described previously (39Gorman J.J. Ferguson B.L. Nguyen T.B. Rapid Commun. Mass. Spectrom. 1996; 10: 529-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). 2,6-Dihydroxyacetophenone (DHAP, Fluka)/diammonium hydrogen citrate (Fluka) matrix was prepared as described previously (39Gorman J.J. Ferguson B.L. Nguyen T.B. Rapid Commun. Mass. Spectrom. 1996; 10: 529-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Samples were diluted 1:5 in 33% (v/v) acetonitrile, 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid prior to analysis. 1–2 μl of diluted sample was mixed with an equivalent volume of matrix, 1 μl deposited on a Bruker Scout 26 MALDI target, and allowed to air dry for 10 min before analysis. Peptides were reduced with Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP, Pierce) and analyzed using a previously described modification of the DHAP/diammonium hydrogen citrate protocol (34Pitt J.J. Da Silva E. Gorman J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6469-6478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 39Gorman J.J. Ferguson B.L. Nguyen T.B. Rapid Commun. Mass. Spectrom. 1996; 10: 529-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). MALDI-PSD—Analysis was performed using the Bruker Reflex mass spectrometer and samples were prepared in α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CHCA) matrix essentially as described previously (40Gorman J.J. Ferguson B.L. Speelman D. Mills J. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1308-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 41Lopaticki S. Morrow C.J. Gorman J.J. J. Mass. Spectrom. 1998; 33: 950-960Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Variation to the previously described procedures involved use of a 100-ns delay before extraction of ions from the source, and data acquisition using a 2 GHz digitizer. MALDI-MS/MS—Analysis was performed using a Q-STAR XL hybrid Quadrupole quadrupole (Qq)-TOF-MS equipped with an O-MALDI 2 source (Applied Biosystems MDS Sciex). All samples were dissolved in 50% (v/v) acetonitrile, 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid and crystallized with CHCA matrix (Agilent) by spotting 0.5 μl of matrix + 0.5 μl of sample and allowing air drying at ambient temperature. TOF-MS data were acquired in the mass range of 1000–4000 atomic mass units. The mass spectrometer was calibrated using Glu-fibrinopeptide B in MS/MS mode. Subsequent MS and MS/MS data on the samples were acquired using external calibration. In this external calibration mode ∼30 ppm or better mass accuracy was obtained with mass spectrometer resolution of ∼10,000. The O-MALDI 2 source is equipped with a N2 laser that was operated at 7–8 μJ. The same laser power (energy) was used for MS and MS/MS experiments. MS/MS data were acquired with slightly open resolution (about 4-atomic mass unit wide open window for precursor selection in Quadrupole 1) to allow transmission of all the isotopes of the high mass peptide (2858 atomic mass units) for fragmentation. The collision energy (Q0–RO2) used varied depending on peptide mass and was 90 eV for the peptide at 2858 atomic mass units, 75 eV at 1700 atomic mass units, and around 70 eV at 1500 atomic mass units. Acquisition time (specified as accumulation time in the software) for one spectrum was 1 s for MS and MS/MS, and all the data were acquired in MCA mode (multiple channel addition or summed spectra) over a period of 30 s to 2 min. Analyst QS software was used for all the data acquisition software. Under the normal operating conditions of the O-MALDI 2 source, very little in-source fragmentation of tryptic peptides is observed. In this case of disulfide-linked peptides some insource fragmentation did occur and can be seen in MS spectra. Most of the disulfide-linked peptide remained intact for MS/MS analysis. For MS/MS/MS experiments slightly higher laser power (8–9 μJ) was used. Because of the orthogonal nature of this TOF instrument use of higher laser power has no effect on instrument resolution or mass accuracy. Peptide and fragment ion masses were localized to the NS1 sequence using PAWS freeware version 8.4 (Proteometrics), and Bioanalyst (Applied Biosystems) software. The 12 half-cystines of NS1 are indicated as C1 to C12 (starting from the amino proximal half-cystine), with interchain disulfide linkages indicated with a forward slash, C3/C4, C5/C6, and so on (34Pitt J.J. Da Silva E. Gorman J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6469-6478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Brackets are used to indicate that alternative disulfide linkages were possible. C8/[C9,C10]/C11 thus indicates a three-chain peptide where separate peptides containing C8 and C11 are linked to a peptide containing C9 and C10, although the exact disulfide linkage p"

In the shear force of flowing blood, however, only the very large VWF multimers are effective in capturing platelets. The multimeric size of VWF can be controlled by proteolysis at the Tyr842-Met843 peptide bond by ADAMTS13 or cleavage of the disulfide bonds that hold VWF multimers together by thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1). The average multimer size of plasma VWF in TSP-1 null mice was significantly smaller than in wild type mice. In addition, the multimer size of VWF released from endothelium in vivo was reduced more rapidly in TSP-1 null mice than in wild type mice. TSP-1, like ADAMTS13, bound to the VWF A3 domain. TSP-1 in the wild type mice, therefore, may compete with ADAMTS13 for interaction with the A3 domain and slow the rate of VWF proteolysis. TSP-1 is stored in platelet α-granules and is released upon platelet activation. Significantly, platelet VWF multimer size was reduced upon lysis or activation of wild type murine platelets but not TSP-1 null platelets. This difference had functional consequences in that there was an increase in collagen- and VWF-mediated aggregation of the TSP-1 null platelets under both static and shear conditions. These findings indicate that TSP-1 influences plasma and platelet VWF multimeric size differently and may be more relevant for control of the VWF released from platelets.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 395-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar). VWF is synthesized by megakaryocytes and endothelial cells and circulates in blood as a series of multimers made up of a variable number of disulfide-linked 500-kDa homodimers (2Counts R.B. Paskell S.L. Elgee S.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1978; 62: 702-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Only the larger multimers of VWF are effective in hemostasis, since a selective deficiency of these forms is associated with a bleeding diathesis, type IIA von Willebrand disease (3Furlan M. Ann. Hematol. 1996; 72: 341-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The intracellular assembly of VWF multimers is a stepwise process. First, individual pro-VWF subunits are linked in a tail-to-tail orientation by C-terminal disulfide bonds to form pro-VWF dimers, which are then linked in a head-to-head orientation by N-terminal disulfide bonds to form VWF multimers. The largest VWF multimers have a molecular mass in excess of 20,000 kDa (reviewed in Ref. 4Wagner D.D. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 217-246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The VWF secreted constitutively from endothelial cells is composed of dimers and small multimers in contrast to the ultralarge multimers that are released from the storage compartment (5Sporn L.A. Marder V.J. Wagner D.D. Cell. 1986; 46: 185-190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). The Weibel-Palade bodies in endothelial cells and the α-granules of platelets release ultralarge VWF in response to vascular injury and platelet activation. The largest VWF multimers in plasma are smaller than those stored within endothelial cells and platelets (6Moake J.L. Rudy C.K. Troll J.H. Weinstein M.J. Colannino N.M. Azocar J. Seder R.H. Hong S.L.

Two mechanisms operate in regulating VWF multimer size: shear-dependent hydrolysis of VWF multimers by the VWF-cleaving metalloproteinase, ADAMTS13 (7Furlan M. Robles R. Lamie B.

The persistence of unprocessed ultralarge VWF multimers in the circulation is thought to precipitate platelet clumping in arterioles and capillaries, resulting in tissue ischemia (6Moake J.L. Rudy C.K. Troll J.H. Weinstein M.J. Colannino N.M. Azocar J. Seder R.H. Hong S.L. Deykin D. N. Engl. J. Med. 1982; 307: 1432-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar).

The thrombospondins are a family of extracellular glycoproteins that function in cell-cell and cell-matrix communication and modulate cellular phenotype (16Lawler J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 634-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). We reported that the supernatant of cultured endothelial cells possessed VWF reductase activity and identified TSP-1 as a VWF reductase (10Xie L. Chesterman C.N. Hogg P.J. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 1341-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 17Xie L. Chesterman C.N. Hogg P.J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2000; 84: 506-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). More recently, we showed that the VWF-reducing activity of TSP-1 centers on a free thiol at Cys974 in the Ca2+-binding C-terminal sequence of the protein (18Pimanda J.E. Annis D.S. Raftery M. Mosher D.F. Chesterman C.N. Hogg P.J. Blood. 2002; 100: 2832-2838Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The role of TSP-1 in regulating VWF multimer size in vivo and its relationship to ADAMTS13 activity was unknown. To clarify these issues, we have characterized the plasma and platelet VWF multimer pattern in TSP-1-/- and TSP-1+/+ C57BL/6 mice. Incubation of VWF with TSP-1 in vitro results in smaller VWF multimers. Surprisingly, TSP-1 contributes to the persistence of larger VWF multimers in the circulation possibly by negatively regulating ADAMTS13 activity. On the other hand, platelet VWF multimer size was reduced upon lysis or activation of wild type platelets but not TSP-1 null platelets. This difference has functional relevance as the TSP-1 null platelets exhibited an increase in collagen- and VWF-mediated aggregation under static and shear conditions. We discuss the implications of these findings with regard to the initiation and development of an arterial thrombus. Proteins and Reagents—Leupeptin, d-Phe-Pro-Arg-chloromethyl ketone, and 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride (AEBSF) were from Calbiochem, and bovine thrombin, N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), EDTA, 1,10-phenanthroline, phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, Triton X-100, and Tween 20 were from Sigma. Aprotinin was from Bayer AG (Leverkusen, Germany), and 1-desamino-8-d-arginine vasopressin (desmopressin) was from Ferring AB (Limhamn, Sweden). TSP-1 was purified from human platelet concentrates (19Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Mosher D.F. Blood. 1985; 66: 1098-1104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); the recombinant TSP-1 fragments, CP123-1 (residues 294-529) and E3CaG-1 (residues 630-1152), were expressed in insect cells and were a gift from Dr. Deane Mosher (20Mosher D.F. Huwiler K.G. Misenheimer T.M. Annis D.S. Methods Cell Biol. 2002; 69: 69-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The residue numbers are for the mature protein. The recombinant VWF A3 domain was expressed in E. coli and purified from bacterial inclusion bodies and was a gift from Dr. Miguel Cruz (21Cruz M.A. Yuan H. Lee J.R. Wise R.J. Handin R.I. J. Biol.

The anti-TSP-1 monoclonal antibody, mAb 133, was a gift from Dr. Joanne Murphy-Ullrich, and HB8432 was produced from a murine hybridoma cell line obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). All other reagents were of analytical grade. Animals—Wild type (TSP-1+/+) and TSP-1 null (TSP-1-/-) C57BL/6 mice were used in this study. TSP-1-/- mice (22Lawler J. Sunday M. Thibert V. Duquette M.

Invest. 1998; 101: 982-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar) were generated in Dr. Jack Lawler's laboratory (Boston, MA) by homologous recombination in 129/Sv-derived ES cells implanted in C57BL/6 blastocysts. Chimeras were bred to C57BL/6 mice, the offspring were genotyped, and heterozygotes were back-crossed (N9) to a C57Bl/6 genetic background (99.6%). A breeding program was established at the biological resource center at the University of New South Wales (Sydney, Australia), and animals aged between 6 weeks and 6 months and of both sexes were used. The experimental procedures were approved by the Animal Care and Ethics Committee of the University of New South Wales. Preparation of Plasma—The mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (Abbott), and blood was collected by cardiac puncture using a 1-ml syringe and a 26-gauge needle and mixed with 3.8% trisodium citrate anticoagulant in a 6:1 (v/v) ratio. For the desmopressin time course study, free flowing blood from the saphenous vein was collected via heparin-coated capillary tubes and mixed with citrate anticoagulant as above. To evaluate human plasma and platelet VWF, blood was collected by venepuncture using an 18-gauge needle and a 20-ml syringe and mixed with citrate anticoagulant. Platelet-rich plasma was obtained by centrifuging blood at 150 × g for 20 min. The platelet-rich plasma was then spun at 500 × g for a further 20 min to obtain a platelet pellet. The supernatant was recentrifuged at 2000 × g for a further 15 min to prepare platelet poor plasma. A platelet count was performed to confirm the absence of platelets, and aliquots of platelet-poor plasma were frozen at -80 °C till further use. For the experiments using pooled mouse plasma, equal volumes of blood were pooled prior to centrifugation. Preparation of Washed Platelets—The platelets obtained from platelet rich plasma were washed three times with 5 mm Pipes, pH 6.8, buffer containing 0.145 m NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 0.5 mm Na2HPO4, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm dextrose. The platelet pellet after the final wash was resuspended in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, buffer containing 0.137 m NaCl, 4mm KCl, 0.5 mm Na2HPO4, 0.1 mm CaCl2,and 5 mm dextrose (platelet Hepes), and the platelet count was adjusted to 2 × 109/ml. Preparation of a Platelet Lysate—Suspensions of washed platelets were centrifuged at 7000 × g for 2 min, and the platelet pellet was resuspended in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, buffer containing 0.14 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.05% Tween 20, 10 μm leupeptin, 2 mm 1,10-phenanthroline, phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm AEBSF, 1 mm phenanthroline, and 10 μm aprotinin (lysis buffer) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. 5 mm EDTA and 10 mm NEM were added to the lysis buffer either before or 5 min into the incubation period. The suspensions of lysed platelets were then centrifuged at 7000 × g for 2 min, and aliquots of the supernatant were stored at -80 °C until further use. Thrombin Activation of Platelets and Preparation of Platelet Releasate—A suspension of washed platelets was preincubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Aggregation was performed at 37 °C by adding 1 unit·ml-1 thrombin to a continuously stirred suspension of platelets. The platelets were stirred for a total of 10 min with the addition of 5 μm d-Phe-Pro-Argchloromethyl ketone, 10 μm leupeptin, 1 mm AEBSF, 1 mm phenanthroline, 2 mm 1,10-phenanthroline, phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μm aprotinin at 2 min and 5 mm EDTA and 10 mm NEM at 5 min. The suspension was centrifuged at 7000 × g for 2 min, and aliquots of the supernatant were stored at -80 °C until further use. The aggregated platelet pellet was then lysed with lysis buffer containing 5 mm EDTA and 10 mm NEM and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The lysed platelets were then centrifuged at 7000 × g for 2 min, and aliquots of the supernatant were stored at -80 °C. The Measurement of VWF Multimer Size—Two measurements of multimer size were performed: agarose gel electrophoresis and collagen binding. The samples were assayed using an in-house method at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital (Sydney, Australia) modified from Ruggeri et al. (23Ruggeri Z.M. Zimmerman T.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1980; 65: 1318-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Briefly, aliquots of murine and human plasma, platelet lysate, and releasate were diluted 10-fold in a 200 mm Tris, pH 6.8, buffer containing 10% glycerol, 1% SDS, 2 mm EDTA, and 0.01% bromphenol blue and warmed to 56 °C for 20 min. 20 μl of the mix was loaded onto a 1% agarose gel (Seakem™ HGT(P)-agarose; Cambrex, Santa Rosa, CA) in Tris-glycine-SDS electrophoresis buffer, pH 8.3, mounted on a Protean™ II xi cell system (Bio-Rad), and electrophoresed at 4 °C at 125 V for 5 h. The gels were fixed, and the nonspecific binding sites were blocked with skim milk, followed by an overnight incubation with 125I-labeled anti-human VWF polyclonal antibodies (Dako, Carpinteria, CA). The gels were then washed in distilled water, dried on GelBond film (BMA, Rockland, ME), and exposed to Eastman Kodak Co. BIOMAX MS film. The autoradiographs were developed at 48 h. Densitometry was performed using a Fluor-S MultiImager and Quantity One software from Bio-Rad. Aliquots of murine plasma, platelet lysate, and platelet releasate were diluted 10-fold in 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.3, buffer containing 0.12 m NaCl, 5 mm citric acid (ELISA buffer) and 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA), and the VWF collagen binding affinity and VWF antigen level were each assayed in triplicate as described by Favaloro et al. (24Favaloro E.J. Grispo L. Exner T. Koutts J. Blood Coagul. Fibrinolysis. 1991; 2: 285-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Murine VWF was detected using a 1000-fold dilution of peroxidase-conjugated anti-human VWF polyclonal antibodies (Dako, Carpinteria, CA) in ELISA buffer containing 0.1% BSA. The human samples were diluted 100-fold in ELISA buffer containing 5% BSA. The OD values of the ELISA plate were monitored in the plate reader, and the reactions were stopped at 0.2-0.3 OD rather than at a fixed time point for improved accuracy of the individual measurements. Although this results in a variation of the collagen binding affinity (CBA)/VWFAg ratio of plasma and platelet VWF between experiments, this was considered less important than the accuracy of each measurement for a given experiment. Binding of TSP-1 to VWF A3 Domain—VWF A3 domain (1 μm solution in 0.1 m NaHCO3, pH 7.3) was adsorbed to Nunc PolySorp 96-well plates overnight at 4 °C in a humid environment. Wells were washed three times with ELISA buffer plus 0.1% BSA, and nonspecific binding sites were blocked by incubating wells with 200 μl of ELISA buffer plus 5% BSA for 90 min at 37 °C and then washed twice with ELISA buffer plus 0.1% BSA. Dilutions of TSP-1 or the E3CaG-1 fragment were prepared in 50 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.14 m NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2,1 mg·ml-1 polyethylene glycol 6000 and 1% BSA. Reactions were in 100 μl for 60 min at room temperature with orbital shaking. Wells were washed four times with ELISA buffer plus 0.1% BSA and incubated with 100 μl of 5 μg·ml-1 mAb 133 for 60 min at room temperature with orbital shaking. Wells were washed three times with ELISA buffer plus 0.1% BSA and incubated with 100 μl of a 1:1000 dilution of rabbit anti-mouse peroxidase-conjugated antibodies for 30 min at room temperature with orbital shaking. Wells were washed three times with ELISA buffer plus 0.1% BSA, and the peroxidase was detected as previously described (24Favaloro E.J. Grispo L. Exner T. Koutts J. Blood Coagul. Fibrinolysis. 1991; 2: 285-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). mAb 133 recognizes an epitope within E3CaG-1. To detect binding of TSP-1 to VWF A3 in the presence of CP123-1 or E3CaG-1, HB8432 was substituted for mAb 133. HB8432 recognizes an epitope within the epidermal growth factor-like domains of TSP-1 (25Prater C.A. Plotkin J. Jaye D. Frazier W.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 1031-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) and does not react with either CP123-1 or E3CaG-1 (data not shown). Static Platelet Aggregometry—Pooled platelet-rich plasma was prepared as described, and the platelet count was adjusted to 300 × 109/liter using platelet-poor plasma. TSP-1+/+ and TSP-1-/- mouse platelet-rich plasmas were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min, and the platelet aggregation response to SKF Horm™ collagen (Nycomed, Ismaning, Munchen) and ADP (Chrono-Log Corp., Havertown, PA) was measured over 10 min in a platelet aggregometer (Chrono-Log Corp.). The role of VWF in the formation of a platelet aggregate was investigated by preincubating TSP-1-/- mouse platelet-rich plasma with rabbit anti-human VWF polyclonal antibodies (DAKO, Carpinteria, CA) or control normal rabbit immunoglobulin at 37 °C for 30 min prior to the addition of collagen. Shear-induced Platelet Aggregometry—1 ml of whole blood was collected by cardiac puncture from six 12-week-old female TSP-1+/+ and TSP-1-/- mice and added to 140 μl of citrate-phosphate-dextrose anticoagulant. Shear-induced platelet aggregation was performed using a PFA-100™ test system (26Kundu S.K. Heilmann E.J. Sio R. Garcia C. Davidson R.M. Ostgaard R.A. Semin. Thromb. Hemost. 1995; 21: 106-112PubMed Google Scholar) (Dade Behring) and a cartridge coated with collagen (fibrillar type 1 equine tendon) and ADP. Administration of Desmopressin—Desmopressin was diluted in sterile saline and infused over 30 min via the tail vein using a 10-ml syringe, “Flowline” Springfusor™ syringe driver, and Springfusor flow control tubing (Pacific Medical Supplies, Victoria, Australia) and a 30-guage 0.5-inch needle. For the time course experiment, the concentration of desmopressin was adjusted to deliver 3 μg/kg at a fixed volume of 250 μl over 30 min to six TSP-1+/+ or TSP-1-/- mice. Blood was sampled 1 h before desmopressin infusion and at 1 and 6 h postinfusion. The first two collections were by saphenous vein bleeds, and the third was by cardiac puncture. In separate experiments, desmopressin was infused over 30 min to three TSP-1+/+ or TSP-1-/- mice, and blood was collected by cardiac puncture at 1 h in one study and 6 h in another. Statistics—Comparative data are presented as means ± S.D. Statistical significance was calculated with Student's t test for all analyses. The average multimer size of VWF in plasma and platelet samples was estimated using two different measures. Samples were resolved on 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and the VWF was detected using 125I-labeled anti-human VWF polyclonal antibodies. The densities of the resulting multimer patterns were quantified and expressed as band intensity as a function of size. To compensate for small variations in protein loading and to better compare average VWF multimer size in a given experiment, the optical densities of the individual lanes were normalized so that the total density for each lane was the same. The CBA was also measured and expressed relative to the total VWF concentration (VWFAg) in the sample. The CBA/VWFAg ratio correlates with the average molecular weight of the intermediate and high VWF multimer forms for a given concentration of VWF (27Favaloro E.J. Facey D. Grispo L. Am. J. Clin. Pathol. 1995; 104: 264-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The overall error for the CBA/VWFAg ratio was calculated by adding the relative errors (one S.D.) for the individual CBA and VWFAg measures. TSP-1 influences the average multimer size of only the very large VWF multimers (10Xie L. Chesterman C.N. Hogg P.J. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 1341-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 17Xie L. Chesterman C.N. Hogg P.J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2000; 84: 506-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), which are difficult to resolve by gel electrophoresis or other means. Proteolysis of VWF by ADAMTS13, on the other hand, is readily apparent using this technique. The difficulty in resolving the very large VWF multimers can lead to uncertainty in the interpretation of the electrophoresis experiments. Importantly, however, the relative average VWF multimer size measured by gel electrophoresis in our study always correlated with the CBA/VWFAg ratio in a given experiment. Plasma VWF Multimer Size Was Smaller in TSP-1 Null than in Wild Type Mice—To evaluate the contribution of TSP-1 to the control of plasma VWF multimer size, we measured VWF multimer size in the plasmas of TSP-1+/+ and TSP-1-/- mice. Based on the in vitro evidence that TSP-1 reduces VWF multimer size (10Xie L. Chesterman C.N. Hogg P.J. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 1341-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), we anticipated that in its absence the multimers might be larger in the TSP-1-/- mice. To the contrary, in both individual and pooled murine plasma, VWF multimer size was significantly smaller in TSP-1-/- mouse plasma. The ultralarge VWF multimers in the plasmas of individual mice were larger in TSP-1+/+ mice than in TSP-1-/- mice (Fig. 1A). This difference was confirmed by densitometry (Fig. 1B). The CBA to VWFAg ratios of the TSP-1+/+ cohort plasmas was also significantly higher than for the TSP-1-/- cohort (Fig. 1C). To allow for individual variations in multimer size between mice within a cohort, VWF multimer size was also measured in pooled plasma. Blood was collected by cardiac puncture from 12 (six male and six female) TSP-1+/+ or TSP-1-/- mice and an equal volume of blood from each mouse was mixed to prepare pooled plasma. This was repeated using three other groups of mice. The VWF multimer size in the pooled plasmas of the TSP-1-/- mice was significantly smaller than in the TSP-1+/+ mice in each group (Fig. 1, D and E). The Multimer Size of Endothelium-derived VWF Was Reduced More Rapidly in TSP-1 Null than in Wild Type Mice—Desmopressin is a synthetic analog of arginine vasopressin. The infusion of desmopressin to mice (28Sweeney J.D. Novak E.K. Reddington M. Takeuchi K.H. Swank R.T. Blood. 1990; 76: 2258-2265Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and humans (29Richardson D.W. Robinson A.G. Ann. Intern. Med. 1985; 103: 228-239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) results in a rapid increase in plasma VWF, which persists for 6 h or more. Desmopressin is thought to act via vasopressin receptors on endothelial cells to stimulate the release of VWF from endogenous stores. The increase in plasma VWF is accompanied by an increase in the concentration of ultralarge VWF multimers in the circulation (30Batlle J. Lopez-Fernandez M.F. Lopez-Borrasca A. Lopez-Berges C. Dent J.A. Berkowitz S.D. Ruggeri Z.M. Zimmerman T.S. Blood. 1987; 70: 173-176Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The intravenous infusion of desmopressin to TSP-1+/+ and TSP-1-/- mice resulted in an increase in plasma VWF levels, which persisted at 6 h. The increase in plasma VWF concentration in TSP-1+/+ mice (Fig. 2A), however, was accompanied by a greater relative increase in the ultralarge VWF multimers than was observed in TSP-1-/- mice (Fig. 2B). The average multimer size of plasma VWF was larger in TSP-1+/+ than TSP-1-/- mice at both 1 h (Fig. 2C) and 6 h (Fig. 2D) after desmopressin treatment. This result indicated that ultralarge VWF multimers released from stimulated endothelial cells in vivo are more efficiently processed in the absence of plasma TSP-1. TSP-1 Bound to the A3 Domain of VWF—The interaction of TSP-1 and TSP-1 fragments with the A3 domain of VWF was measured using a competitive binding technique. In this technique, A3 immobilized on polystyrene was used as a probe to monitor the solution phase binding of TSP-1 or E3CaG-1 (which contains the Ca2+-binding repeats and C-terminal sequence and harbors the VWF reductase activity) to A3. Interaction of ligands with protein acceptors immobilized on plastic often introduces artifacts due to varying degrees of denaturation of the plastic-bound protein. This was probably the cause of the lack of saturable binding of TSP-1 (Fig. 3B) and E3CaG-1 (Fig. 3D) to immobilized VWF A3. Soluble A3 competed for the binding of TSP-1 (Fig. 3C) and E3CaG-1 (Fig. 3E) to immobilized A3, however, which implied that the interaction was specific. Apparent dissociation constants for binding of TSP-1 or E3CaG-1 to soluble A3 of ∼3 and ∼6 μm, respectively, were estimated from the competition experiments. As expected, soluble E3CaG-1, but not the CP123-1 fragment (which contains the procollagen-like module and three properdin-like or type 1 modules), competed with TSP-1 for binding to immobilized A3 (Fig. 3, E and F). These results indicate that TSP-1, like ADAMTS13 (31Dong J.F. Moake J.L. Bernardo A. Fujikawa K. Ball C. Nolasco L. Lopez J.A. Cruz M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29633-29639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), interacts with the A3 domain of VWF. The Average Multimer Size of the VWF in Human Platelets Is Smaller than in Murine Platelets—Variation in the pattern and processing of VWF multimer size in human and murine platelets was evaluated by lysing platelets in the absence or presence of the TSP-1 inhibitors, EDTA and NEM. There was a partial reduction in multimer size of both human and murine platelet VWF upon lysis in the absence of the TSP-1 inhibitors (Fig. 4). Notably, the VWF multimers in human platelets are significantly smaller than in C57BL/6 murine platelets. Platelet VWF Multimer Size Was Reduced upon Lysis of Wild Type but Not TSP-1 Null Platelets—To study the role of TSP-1 in regulating platelet VWF multimer size, we prepared platelet lysates from TSP-1+/+ and TSP-1-/- mice. The platelet lysates were prepared in the presence of a range of protease inhibitors, including phenanthroline that inactivates ADAMTS13 (8Tsai H.M. Blood. 1996; 87: 4235-4244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and either with or without the TSP-1 inhibitors, EDTA and NEM. The VWF reductase activity of TSP-1 is inactivated by EDTA, which depletes the C-terminal Ca2+-binding repeats of this ion, and by NEM, which alkylates the critical thiol at Cys974. The average VWF multimer size was partially reduced in TSP-1+/+ but not in TSP-1-/- platelets when lysed without the TSP-1 inhibitors (Fig. 5). The reduction in multimer size was more obvious when measured by collagen avidity, which preferentially"

The BMP target genes mediating these effects and the mechanism of their selective regulation are poorly characterized. In this study, we used a chromatin immunoprecipitation-based gene cloning method to identify BMP target genes in a mouse embryonic carcinoma cell line. We identified the Indian hedgehog (Ihh) gene as a target of BMP signaling. Both reporter and reverses transcription-PCR assays revealed that Ihh is up-regulated in embryonic cells upon BMP treatment. The BMP response element of the Ihh promoter contains multiple GC-rich motifs known as the “Mad/Medea binding box” found in the Drosophila tinman gene and in the mouse Id1 gene. DNA binding studies revealed that Smad4 binds to these GC-rich motifs. These findings indicate that BMP stimulates Ihh expression. We also suggest expression of the Ihh gene, which contains multiple Smad binding sites, might be finely regulated by a gradient of BMP concentrations.

The bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) 1The abbreviations used are: BMP, bone morphogenetic protein; Dpp, decapentaplegic; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; HPRT, hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase; SBE, Smad binding elements; TGF-β, transforming growth factor-β; RT, reverse transcription; G3PHD, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. were originally identified as peptides that induce ectopic bone and cartilage production (1Reddi A.H. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 737-744Google Scholar). BMPs constitute the largest subfamily of the TGF-β superfamily of growth factors and exert pleiotropic biological effects ranging from regulation of early developmental processes to organogenesis (2Hogan B.L.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1580-1594Google Scholar, 3von Bubnoff A. Cho K.W. Dev. Biol. 2001; 239: 1-14Google Scholar). Like other members of the TGF-β family of growth factors, BMP signals are initiated by the binding of the ligand to the specific serine/threonine kinase receptors, known as type I and type II. Upon ligand binding, type II receptor kinase phosphorylates type I receptor and activates its kinase domain. Then, activated type I receptor kinase phosphorylates the Smad proteins, downstream signal transducers. Upon BMP stimulation, Smad1, -5, and -8 are phosphorylated by the receptor, form a complex with Smad4, and translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, where they act as transcriptional regulators (4Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Science. 2002; 296: 1646-1647Google Scholar, 5Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Heldin C.H. Adv. Immunol. 2000; 75: 115-157Google Scholar, 6Chen Y.G. Hata A. Lo R.S. Wotton D. Shi Y. Pavletich N. Massague J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2144-2152Google Scholar). To understand the mechanism of how BMPs exert various biological effects in a cell type-specific manner, it is important to elucidate genes that are regulated by Smads and the mechanism of their regulation. The Smad complex by itself has low specificity and affinity for its DNA recognition site, and it is known to associate with various DNA-binding cofactors to achieve high affinity and selective interactions with cognate DNAs (7Massague J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1759Google Scholar). Among these cofactors, OAZ is the first identified as a DNA-binding cofactor that associates with an activated Smad1-Smad4 complex to activate the Xenopus Vent-2 gene. However, in the same tissue and at the same stage, BMP gradients can select different target genes. Therefore, the other mechanism of target gene selection dependent on the intensity of the BMP signal was investigated. In Drosophila, the homeobox protein Tinman cooperates with Mad and Medea (the orthologs of Smad1 and Smad4, respectively) in the induction of tinman itself by decapentaplegic (Dpp) (the ortholog of BMP2/4) during formation of the visceral mesoderm (8Xu X. Yin Z. Hudson J.B. Ferguson E.L. Frasch M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2354-2370Google Scholar). A recent study on the promoter of the Zen gene, the expression of which is regulated by Dpp during dorsoventral axis formation, also suggests that multimerized Mad/Medea binding sites (Mad box) sensor the intensity of the BMP signal and set a threshold for gene expression (9Rushlow C. Colosimo P.F. Lin M.C. Xu M. Kirov N. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 340-351Google Scholar). In this study, BMP-responsive genomic regions were cloned by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) by targeting Smad4. Mapping of the sequence from one clone revealed that mouse Ihh (Indian hedgehog) is a target of BMP signaling, confirmed by RT-PCR in P19 cells. Ihh is one of the key regulators in endochondral bone formation. The BMP-responsive region of the Ihh promoter contains 6 Mad boxes (GCCGNCGC motif) and one GGCGCC motif, which is similar to the promoter structure found in Drosophila Dpp target genes. Our findings of the mouse Ihh promoter structure suggest the evolutional conservation of BMP regulation of gene transcription and also clarify one aspect of how the two morphogens, BMP and hedgehog, interact. Cell Culture—COS-1 and P19 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone). Recombinant BMP7 was prepared and provided by Curis Inc. Briefly, human BMP7 was overexpressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells and purified from the culture medium by column chromatography. The purity of BMP7 was monitored by SDS-PAGE. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Cloning—P19 cells were treated with 100 μg/ml BMP7 for 1 h and fixed with 1% formaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min. Reaction was stopped with 0.125 m glycine and rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline. After being washed with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were resuspended in swelling buffer (10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 10 mm potassium chloride, 1.5 mm magnesium chloride, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium vanadate, proteinase inhibitors) and were incubated on ice for 10 min. Cell suspension was passed through a 22-μm gauge needle, and the nuclei were collected by centrifugation. The nuclei were resuspended in chip buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 m sodium chloride, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1% bovine serum albumin, proteinase inhibitors) and incubated on ice for 10 min. Genomic DNAs were sonicated on ice to an average length of 1000 bp and then centrifuged, and the supernatant was collected. The sample was incubated at 4 °C with 5 μg of rabbit IgG for 4 h and additionally with 20 μl of protein A-agarose beads for 1 h and then centrifuged. Precleared chromatin was incubated with 5 μg of anti-Smad4 rabbit polyclonal antibodies (H-552, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or nonspecific rabbit IgG overnight. Immune complex was recovered using 20 μl of protein A-agarose beads after washing three times with 1 ml of chip buffer. Chromatin was eluted in 95 μl of elution buffer (0.1 m glycine, pH 1.7, 150 mm sodium chloride). The eluate was neutralized with 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and then diluted with chip buffer to proceed to the second cycle of immunoprecipitation. The neutralized second eluate was incubated at 65 °C overnight for reverse cross-link. RNA was removed by incubation with 10 μg of RNase A at 37 °C for 30 min, and protein was digested with Proteinase K treatment. DNA was extracted with phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol followed by extraction with chloroform and then was ethanol-precipitated with 20 μg of glycogen. Both ends of the purified DNA were once blunt-ended with T4 DNA polymerase and then underwent forced adenylation at the 5′ end for cloning (pCR2-TOPO, Invitrogen). The sequences were mapped in the whole mouse genomic sequence data base (genome.ucsc.edu). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—The ChIP assay was performed under the same conditions as the ChIP cloning method described above except that DNA fragments were sonicated to an average length of 200–300 bp. Immunoprecipitated DNA fragments were amplified with PCR primers specific for the promoter region of the mouse Ihh gene: Ihh(GC), 5′-CCCCCGCCGTCGCCGCGTTGCCAAAACAAAC-3′ and 5′-GTGCTGTCCCCCTCGGCGCCTCGACTCTGAGC-3′; Ihh(5′), 5′-GGTAGTGGCCGGACCGCACAA-3′ and 5′-TGGAAACACTGTTAAAAACAA-3′; Smad6, 5′-ACCCCGCCGCGCCGGCTCCAG-3′ and 5′-GGGCTCTCCCGCCTGGCGTCC-3′; and hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) promoter, 5′-AGCGCAAGTTGAATCTGC-3′ and 5′-AGCGACAATCTACCAGAG-3′. PCR products were separated on an agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. RT-PCR—P19 cells were treated with 10 μg/ml cyclohexamide for 0.5 h prior to BMP7 stimulation for 2 h. Total RNA was extracted by TRIzol (Invitrogen), and 5 μg of total RNA was subjected to reverse transcription using a first strand cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. One-tenth of the reaction mixture was used as template for each PCR reaction. The -fold change of expression level was calculated by a real-time PCR following the manufacturer's protocol. Primers used are 5′-CCCCAACTACAATCCCGACATC-3′ and 5′-CGCCAGCAGTCCATACTTATTTCG-3′ for murine Ihh. Primers for murine Smad6 and murine G3PDH were described previously (10Hata A. Seoane J. Lagna G. Montalvo E. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massague J. Cell. 2000; 100: 229-240Google Scholar). Plasmids—To transfer from pCR2-TOPO to a luciferase vector, genomic fragments were digested with XhoI and HindIII and was ligated to XhoI and HindIII sites of the pE1bTATA-luc vector. Deletion mutants of the ZHC8 genomic fragment were generated by PCR and products and were ligated to XhoI and HindIII sites of pE1bTATA-luc vector. The primers used were as follows: -427/-123-Luc, 5′-CCGCTCGAGTCCATTTCCCCTCTCACTCGACCCCGGGCTG-3′ and 5′-CCCAAGCTTTGCGGGGCGGGGGCCCGGGGCCCTGGCTGGTGGCGGCGTG-3′ (IHH10); -385/-123-Luc, 5′-CCGCTCGAGGGCAGCAGCTCCCGCTCTGCCCGAGCCGCC-3′ and IHH10; -305/-123-Luc, 5′-CCGCTCGAGGGCCAGCCCAGCCCAGCCCGCCGGCCC-3′ and IHH10; -285/-123-Luc, 5′-CCGCTCGAGCGGCCCTCAGCCCCGCCGCCCGCCGCCCCCC-3′ (IHH35) and IHH10; -248/-123-Luc, 5′-CCGCTCGAGCGCCGCGTTGCCAAACAACGGGCCGGCCT-3′ and IHH10; -285/-146-Luc, IHH35 and 5′-TTCCCAAGCTTGGCTGGTGGCGGCGTGCTGTCCCCCTCGGCGCCTC-3′; -285/-160-Luc, IHH35 and 5′-TTCCCAAGCTTGTGCTGTCCCCCTCGGCGCCTCGACTCTGAGC-3′. All the reporters with point mutations within -285/-123 regions were generated by PCR and later verified by sequencing. To generate 2GC(WT)-luc, which has two copies of the -285/-123 sequence, the sequence was amplified by PCR using the primers IHH35 and 5′-AAACGCGTCGACTGCGGGGCGGGGGCCCGGGGCCCTGGCTGGTGGCGGCGTG-3′ (IHH52), and the product was digested with XhoI and SalI and then ligated into the XhoI site in E1bTATA-luc. 2GC(MUT)-luc was generated by using the plasmid that has the 2HC8 sequence with mutation in the GGCGCC sequence as a template DNA; the mutant sequence was amplified with primers 5′-CCGCTCGAGCGGCCCTCAGCCCCGACGCACGACGCACCCCGACGTAGCCGCGTT-3′ and IHH52 and then ligated into pE1bTATA-luc. All the constructs were verified by sequencing. Smad1, -2, and -4 expression vectors and constitutive active BMP receptor type IB expression vector and constitutively active TGF-β type I receptor expression vector were described (10Hata A. Seoane J. Lagna G. Montalvo E. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massague J. Cell. 2000; 100: 229-240Google Scholar). Luciferase Assays—P19 cells were transfected in six-well plates using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase assays were carried out as described previously (10Hata A. Seoane J. Lagna G. Montalvo E. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massague J. Cell. 2000; 100: 229-240Google Scholar). After transfection, the cells were re-seeded onto 12-well plates and treated with 100 μg/ml BMP7 for 18 h in a medium containing 0.2% fetal bovine serum. A luciferase assay was carried out using a luciferase assay kit (Promega) and a Berthold luminometer. Biotinylated Oligonucleotide Precipitation Assays—48 h after transfection with Smad1, Smad4, and constitutive active BMPRIB vectors, COS-1 cells were lysed by sonication in T-NET buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.05% of Nonidet P-40) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Cell extracts were precleared with ImmunoPure streptavidin-agarose beads (Pierce) for 1 h and then were incubated with 1 μg of biotinylated DNA probe and 5 μg of poly(dI-dC)-poly(dI-dC) for 2 h. DNA-bound proteins were collected with streptavidin-agarose beads for 1 h, washed with T-NET buffer, separated on a SDS-PAGE gel, and identified by Western blot. A relative intensity of bands on the Western blot was quantitated by densitometry. Western Blot—Smad4, Smad6, and p21/Waf1/Cip1 proteins were detected with anti-Smad4 rabbit polyclonal antibodies (H-552, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-Smad6 rabbit polyclonal antibodies (SD-6, Zymed Laboratories Inc.) and rabbit anti-p21/Waf1/Cip1 polyclonal antibodies (ab7960, abCAM Inc.). Isolation of Genomic DNA Fragments Bound to Smad4 —To identify novel target genes of the BMP signaling pathway, we isolated genomic DNA fragments to which Smad4 binds using a ChIP-based cloning method (11Weinmann A.S. Bartley S.M. Zhang T. Zhang M.Q. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6820-6832Google Scholar, 12Weinmann A.S. Yan P.S. Oberley M.J. Huang T.H. Farnham P.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 235-244Google Scholar). The mouse teratocarcinoma cell line P19 is well characterized as a cell line that responds to BMPs (10Hata A. Seoane J. Lagna G. Montalvo E. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massague J. Cell. 2000; 100: 229-240Google Scholar) and expresses some of the BMP target genes, such as Smad6 (13Ishida W. Hamamoto T. Kusanagi K. Yagi K. Kawabata M. Takehara K. Sampath T.K. Kato M. Miyazono K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6075-6079Google Scholar). 2S. Stewart, G. Lagna and A. Hata, unpublished observation. P19 cells were treated with BMP7 and were subjected to ChIP cloning using anti-Smad4 polyclonal antibodies to precipitate genomic DNA fragments bound to Smad4. Of 60 individual clones, 4 clones contained putative Smad binding elements (SBE or CAGA(C/G) box). Of 40 randomly selected clones that were isolated by nonspecific rabbit IgG, none contained an SBE sequence, suggesting that SBE containing genomic DNA fragments were selectively precipitated by anti-Smad4 antibodies. All four fragments (2HC7, 2HC8, HE5, and H5) were cloned upstream of the luciferase gene and transfected into P19 cells to test the BMP7 responsiveness of each DNA fragment. One construct, 2HC8-Luc, was activated by BMP7 about 3-fold (Fig. 1A). Cotransfection of a BMP-specific Smad combination set, Smad1 and Smad4, augmented the 2HC8-Luc reporter response in a dose-dependent manner (1.5-fold induction without overexpression of Smads compared with 3-fold induction with maximal overexpression of Smads). A dose-dependent expression of the Smad4 protein was detected by Western blot with anti-Smad4 polyclonal antibodies (Fig. 1B). No further induction was observed upon overexpression of TGF-β-specific Smads, Smad2 and Smad4 (Fig. 1B). In addition, the 2HC8-Luc reporter was not influenced by TGF-β (Fig. 1B, hatched bar), suggesting that the 2HC8 clone is a specific target of BMP signaling. By searching the mouse genome data base, the 430-bp 2HC8 sequence was mapped to the 5′ upstream region of the Indian hedgehog (Ihh) gene (Fig. 1C). This region of the Ihh gene is 91% identical between human and mouse and coincides with a CpG island, suggesting that this region has an important role in the regulation of Ihh expression. 163-Base Pair Region of Ihh Gene Confers BMP Responsiveness—To define the minimum region that is required for BMP responsiveness, we constructed a series of deletion mutants of the Ihh promoter and characterized the series by a luciferase assay. The minimum region that retains a BMP response equivalent to the full-length fragment (2HC8-Luc) was -285/-123-Luc (Fig. 2A). Within this region, we found six copies of a GCCGNCGC-like motif (GC-1–6) (Fig. 2, B and C), which is the binding consensus sequence for the Drosophila Smad1 ortholog Mad (14Kim J. Johnson K. Chen H.J. Carroll S. Laughon A. Nature. 1997; 388: 304-308Google Scholar), and one GC-palindromic (GC-pal) sequence (GGCGCC), which was identified in the mouse Id1 gene promoter (15Korchynskyi O. ten Dijke P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4883-4891Google Scholar, 16Lopez-Rovira T. Chalaux E. Massague J. Rosa J.L. Ventura F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3176-3185Google Scholar). All the motifs were conserved between mouse and human genes (Fig. 2B). Another SBE (CAGA(C/G)), which is bound by Smads with relatively low specificity, was identified between the GC-5 and GC-pal motifs (Fig. 2B) (17Zawel L. Dai J.L. Buckhaults P. Zhou S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Kern S.E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 611-617Google Scholar, 18Shi Y. Wang Y.-F. Jayaraman L. Yang H. Massague J. Pavletich N. Cell. 1998; 94: 585-594Google Scholar). Multiple GC-rich Motifs Confer BMP Responsiveness—To determine which sequence motif is essential to respond to BMP and bind to the Smad complex, we disrupted each of the GC-rich motifs (GC-1–6) or the GC palindromic sequence (GC-pal) and measured the response of the resulting constructs to BMP using the luciferase assay. Disruption of GC-1, GC-2, GC-3, and GC-6 showed a significant reduction of the BMP7 response, whereas mutation of GC-4 or GC-5 did not (Fig. 3A). This is presumably because of a GC-rich sequence remaining in the complementary strand of GC-4 and GC-5 (Figs. 2C and 3A). When we mutated the GC-rich sequence in both strands of GC-5 (GC-5dbl), a marked reduction of the BMP response was observed (37% of the activity of the wild type). Disruption of the GC-pal motif alone reduced the BMP response to 12% of the wild type sequence. These results suggest that both the GC-rich and the GC-pal motifs are essential for BMP responsiveness. Mutations of multiple motifs, such as (GC-1, GC-2, GC-5dbl), (GC-3, GC-5dbl), and (GC-1, GC-2, GC-pal), showed a marked reduction of the BMP7 responsiveness compared with single mutations of each motif (Fig. 3A). These results suggest that each GC-rich and GC-pal motif contributes quantitatively to BMP responsiveness and that all the elements are necessary for the maximum level of responsiveness. A mutation of the SBE had no effect on BMP responsiveness, suggesting that the SBE is dispensable in this promoter (Fig. 3A, SBE). GC-rich Motifs Are Essential for BMP Responsiveness—Two tandem repeats of a fragment spanning the six GC-rich motifs and GC-pal motif have been generated (2GC(WT)-luc). This construct showed strong activation by BMP7 (24-fold). Overexpression of Smad1 and Smad4 further augmented the response upon BMP stimulation or cotransfection of constitutively active BMP type IB receptor (BMPR1BCA) but not in cotransfection of the constitutively active TGF-β type I receptor (TβRICA) (Fig. 3B). Mutation of the motifs GC-1, GC-2, GC-3, and GC-pal (2GC(MUT)-luc) completely abolished the response to BMP7, suggesting that the six GC-rich motifs and the GC-pal motif are necessary and sufficient for BMP-specific up-regulation of the Ihh gene (Fig. 3B). GC-rich Motifs Mediate BMP-dependent Smad4 Binding—A ChIP assay was carried out to confirm that Smad4 binds to GC-rich motifs within the -285/-123 region of the Ihh gene upon BMP7 stimulation in vivo. Genomic DNA fragments from BMP7-untreated or -treated P19 cells were isolated and sonicated to an average size of 200–300 bp (Fig. 3C, left panel). DNA fragments were then immunoprecipitated with anti-Smad4 antibodies. Rabbit nonspecific IgG was used as a negative control for the chromatin immunoprecipitation. The presence of the GC-rich motif region of the Ihh gene promoter bound to Smad4 was analyzed by semi-quantitative PCR and real-time PCR using specific pairs of primers spanning the GC-rich motif region (-258/-160) of the Ihh promoter (Ihh(GC)) and the 5′ upstream region of the GC-rich motif region (-1030/-1230), which is not responsible for BMP-dependent regulation of Ihh (Ihh(5′)) (Fig. 3C). Primer sets designed to amplify the BMP response element of the Smad6 gene promoter, which is known to bind to Smads (13Ishida W. Hamamoto T. Kusanagi K. Yagi K. Kawabata M. Takehara K. Sampath T.K. Kato M. Miyazono K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6075-6079Google Scholar), and the 5′ upstream region of the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) promoter were used as positive and negative controls, respectively (Fig. 3C). As shown in Fig. 3, C and D, stimulation with BMP7 induced an increase in the binding of Smad4 to the GC-rich motif region of the Ihh and BMP response element of the Smad6 gene promoters. However, no increase was observed in Smad4 association with the 5′ upstream region of the Ihh (Ihh(5′)) or the HPRT gene promoters upon BMP7 stimulation (Fig. 3, C and D). These results confirm that BMP7 stimulation triggers endogenous Smad4 to bind specifically to a short region of the endogenous Ihh gene promoter that contains multiple GC-rich motifs. A DNA pulldown assay was carried out to examine whether lack of activation of 2GC(MUT)-luc by BMP7 is caused by lack of Smad4 binding to GC-1, GC-2, GC-3, and GC-pal motifs (Fig. 3B). The DNA fragment corresponding to -285/-123 was biotinylated and then was incubated with COS-1 cell extract overexpressing both Smad1 and Smad4. Binding of Smad4 to the wild type -285/-123 fragment was observed in extracts from cells transfected with constitutively active type IB BMP receptor (BMPR1BCA) (Fig. 3E, upper panel, WT lanes). The -285/-123 fragment with mutations in GC-1, GC-2, GC-3, and GC-pal precipitated ∼3-fold less Smad4 (Fig. 3E, upper panel, MUT lanes). This result suggests that Smad4 binds to the GC-rich motifs within the 163-bp fragment of the promoter. Ihh mRNA Is Up-regulated by BMP7 Stimulation of P19 Cells—To examine whether Ihh mRNA is increased by BMP in vivo, we performed a semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis using total RNA extracted from P19 cells that were treated or untreated with BMP7 for 2 h. The Ihh mRNA level was increased 3.9-fold (calculated by real-time PCR) by BMP7 stimulation, similar to the induction of Smad6 mRNA (Fig. 4), which was shown to be induced by BMP7 (13Ishida W. Hamamoto T. Kusanagi K. Yagi K. Kawabata M. Takehara K. Sampath T.K. Kato M. Miyazono K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6075-6079Google Scholar).2 Blocking protein synthesis with cyclohexamide abolished both the accumulation of Smad6 protein upon BMP7 stimulation and the expression of p21Waf1/Cip1, which is known to have a half-life of ∼60 min (Fig. 4, WB) (19Coleman M.L. Marshall C.J. Olson M.F. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2036-2046Google Scholar). Cyclohexamide had no effect on the up-regulation of mRNA for both Ihh and Smad6 by BMP7 (Fig. 4, RT-PCR). These results confirm that Ihh is regulated by Smad4 at the transcriptional level. Using a ChIP-based cloning method, we found that the Ihh gene is a direct target of the BMP-Smad signaling pathway in the mouse embryonic carcinoma P19 cell line. The promoter region of the mouse Ihh gene contains multiple GC-rich motifs, which bind to Smad4 and are responsible for BMP-dependent transcriptional activation of the gene. Ihh Gene as BMP Target—BMP is first identified as an activity that induces ectopic cartilage and endochondral bone when implanted in experimental animals (1Reddi A.H. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 737-744Google Scholar). Several members of the BMP family, including BMP 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7 and their receptors, are expressed in developing cartilage and were predicted to serve as key regulators of endochondral bone formation. The exact role of BMPs in endochondral bone formation, however, is poorly understood. Several lines of evidence suggested that BMP signaling pathways have at least two distinct roles during endochondral bone formation: (i) cell fate determination and (ii) regulation of the overall speed of cartilage development. Ihh, a member of the conserved hedgehog family of signaling molecules, is known to regulate several aspects of bone development. During mouse embryonic development, Ihh expression is first detected at embryonic stage 11.5 among chondrocytes at a stage of early cartilaginous condensation. Ihh knock-out mice revealed severe skeletal defects that include short limb bones at birth (20St-Jacques B. Hammerschmidt M. McMahon A.P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2072-2086Google Scholar). Further analysis revealed that this is caused by a decreased rate of chondrocyte proliferation, suggesting two possible roles of Ihh in the regulation of chondrocyte differentiation: (i) up-regulating parathyroid hormone-related protein, a secreted peptide that regulates chondrocyte differentiation, and (ii) controlling chondrocyte proliferation. An important question in the mechanism of bone development is the relationship between BMPs and Ihh/parathyroid hormone-related protein-signaling pathways. It has been proposed that BMPs might serve as secondary signals of Ihh because the expression pattern of BMPs flanks the Ihh expression domain. Recently, Vortkamp and co-workers (21Minina E. Kreschel C. Naski M.C. Ornitz D.M. Vortkamp A. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 439-449Google Scholar, 22Minina E. Wenzel H.M. Kreschel C. Karp S. Gaffield W. McMahon A.P. Vortkamp A. Development. 2001; 128: 4523-4534Google Scholar) reported that BMP signaling modulates the expression level of Ihh, thereby integrating the regulation of chondrocyte proliferation and the onset of hypertrophic differentiation during bone formation. Our finding that Ihh is a target of BMP signaling adds a molecular explanation of how BMP modulates chondrocyte growth and differentiation through modifying Ihh expression. GC-rich Motif as a Conserved Smad Binding Sequence between the Drosophila Dpp Signal and Mammalian BMP Signal—The observation that Smads can bind directly to DNA and modulate its transcription was first reported after studying the BMP ortholog Drosophila Dpp-responsive genes, such as vestigial, labial, and ultrabithorax (14Kim J. Johnson K. Chen H.J. Carroll S. Laughon A. Nature. 1997; 388: 304-308Google Scholar). The Drosophila Smad homologues, Mad and Medea, were shown to bind to a GC-rich consensus binding sequence, GCCGNCGC (Mad box). We identified multiple Mad box-like, GC-rich sequences in the promoter region of Ihh, which are essential and sufficient for the BMP response and Smad binding. Previously, Mad box-like sequences were found in the promoter region of mammalian BMP target genes, Id1 and Smad6 (13Ishida W. Hamamoto T. Kusanagi K. Yagi K. Kawabata M. Takehara K. Sampath T.K. Kato M. Miyazono K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6075-6079Google Scholar, 15Korchynskyi O. ten Dijke P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4883-4891Google Scholar, 16Lopez-Rovira T. Chalaux E. Massague J. Rosa J.L. Ventura F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3176-3185Google Scholar). GGCGCC (GC-pal) is another GC-rich motif important for BMP responsiveness first reported in the mammalian Id1 gene promoter (15Korchynskyi O. ten Dijke P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4883-4891Google Scholar, 16Lopez-Rovira T. Chalaux E. Massague J. Rosa J.L. Ventura F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3176-3185Google Scholar). The Ihh promoter region also contains a GC-pal motif, which is critical for the BMP responsiveness of Ihh. Thus, the GC-pal motif is a common motif among BMP target genes. Interestingly, the more common Smad binding element does not play a significant role in the regulation of Ihh by BMP, illustrated by the fact that deletion of the SBE had no effect on BMP response (Fig. 3A, SBE). Mechanism to Sensor the Gradient of BMPs—BMP signaling regulates gene expression to exert a wide range of biological activities. Two mechanisms have been proposed to regulate the temporal and spatial specific cell responses to BMP signaling. One is the competency for BMP signaling, conferred by cell type-specific transcriptional partners of Smad proteins (10Hata A. Seoane J. Lagna G. Montalvo E. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massague J. Cell. 2000; 100: 229-240Google Scholar), and the other is the intensity of the signal, which is the gradient of BMP as a morphogen. Each cell senses gradients of morphogens and integrates the information into its responses, such as the regulation of gene expression. Multiple GC-rich motifs have been reported in the promoters of the Drosophila tinman and zen genes, and it has been proposed that the multiple Mad boxes in the promoters of target genes translate the BMP gradient into a gene expression pattern (8Xu X. Yin Z. Hudson J.B. Ferguson E.L. Frasch M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2354-2370Google Scholar, 9Rushlow C. Colosimo P.F. Lin M.C. Xu M. Kirov N. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 340-351Google Scholar). Eight and six Mad-binding motifs are present in a 448-bp promoter region of zen and a 230-bp enhancer region of the tinman gene, respectively. All of the Mad-binding motifs in the zen promoter are indispensable for zen expression in full and the correct pattern at the mid-late cellularization stage (9Rushlow C. Colosimo P.F. Lin M.C. Xu M. Kirov N. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 340-351Google Scholar). The Ihh promoter contains multiple Mad box-like sequences, which has a cumulative effect on the BMP response. The structural resemblance between the mouse BMP target gene Ihh and Drosophila Dpp target genes zen and tinman suggest that the promoter structure of these genes is conserved during evolution in order for genes to respond to different concentrations of BMPs in vivo.

https://openalex.org/W2069892639,"We have previously identified several novel genes, which are differentially expressed among human normal liver and hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs). The full-length liver fibrinogen-related gene-1 (LFIRE-1) cDNA was cloned from the human normal liver cDNA library. LFIRE-1 is highly homologous to HFREP-1 with discrepancy at 5′ untranslated region (UTR) and encodes the same fibrinogen-related protein, which suggest that these two sequences might be alternative splicing forms of the same gene, LFIRE-1/HFREP-1, located at human chromosome 8p22. The LFIRE-1 and HFREP-1 are specifically expressed in normal human liver tissue, but reduced or undetectable in most of HCC specimens at both RNA and protein level. Furthermore, the reduction or nonexpression of LFIRE-1/HFREP-1 is significantly associated with the degree of tumor differentiation. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis revealed allelic loss of LFIRE-1/HFREP-1 on chromosome 8p22 in 57.1% (24/42) of HCC specimens. We detected three inactivation mutations among 45 cases of HCC specimens examined, two of which lost the remaining allele and the third had a replacement of conserved cysteine residue with glycine residue. Notably, the downregulation of LFIRE-1/HFREP-1 expression is frequently associated with allelic loss. The reduction of LFIRE-1/HFREP-1 expression by antisense approach enhances cancer cell proliferation and colony formation in soft agar. Moreover, restoration of exogenous wild-type LFIRE-1/HFREP-1 expression but not LFIRE-1/HFREP-1 missense mutations in human HCC cells inhibited their anchorage-dependent or -independent growth in vitro, and suppressed their tumorigenicity in nude mice. In conclusion, our data demonstrated that liver-specific gene LFIRE-1/HFREP-1 was frequently downregulated and might possess growth suppressor activity in HCC."
https://openalex.org/W2004994163,"Papillary thyroid carcinomas are characterized by rearrangements of the RET receptor tyrosine kinase generating RET/PTC oncogenes. Here we show that osteopontin (OPN), a secreted glycoprotein, is a major RET/PTC-induced transcriptional target in PC Cl 3 thyroid follicular cells. OPN upregulation depended on the integrity of the RET/PTC kinase and tyrosines Y1015 and Y1062, two major RET/PTC autophosphorylation sites. RET/PTC also induced a strong overexpression of CD44, a cell surface signalling receptor for OPN. Upregulation of CD44 was dependent on RET/PTC Y1062, as well. Constitutive OPN overexpression or treatment with exogenous recombinant OPN sharply increased proliferation, Matrigel invasion and spreading in collagen gels of RET/PTC-transformed PC Cl 3 cells. These effects were impaired by the treatment of PC Cl 3-RET/PTC cells with OPN- and CD44-locking antibodies. Thus, RET/PTC signalling triggers an autocrine loop involving OPN and CD44 that sustains proliferation and invasion of transfomed PC Cl 3 thyrocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2056391918,"Nucleotide incorporation by the herpes simplex virus type 1 DNA polymerase catalytic subunit (pol) is less faithful than for most replicative DNA polymerases, despite the presence of an associated 3′- to 5′-exonuclease (exo) activity. To determine the aspects of fidelity affected by the exo activity, nucleotide incorporation and mismatch extension frequency for purified wild-type and an exo-deficient mutant (D368A) pol were compared using primer/templates that varied at only a single position. For both enzymes, nucleotide discrimination during incorporation occurred predominantly at the level of Km for nucleotide and was the major contributor to fidelity. The contribution of the exo activity to reducing the efficiency of formation of half of all possible mispairs was 6-fold or less, and 30-fold when averaged for the formation of all possible mispairs. In steady-state reactions, mismatches imposed a significant kinetic barrier to extension independent of exo activity. However, during processive DNA synthesis in the presence of only three nucleotides, misincorporation and mismatch extension were efficient for both exo-deficient and wild-type pol catalytic subunits, although slower kinetics of mismatch extension by the exo-deficient pol were observed. The UL42 processivity factor decreased the extent of misincorporation by both the wild-type and the exo-deficient pol to similar levels, but mismatch extension by the wild-type pol·UL42 complex was much less efficient than by the mutant pol·UL42. Thus, despite relatively frequent (1 in 300) misincorporation events catalyzed by wild-type herpes simplex virus pol·UL42 holoenzyme, mismatch extension occurs only rarely, prevented in part by the kinetic barrier to extending a mismatch. The kinetic barrier also increases the probability that a mismatched primer terminus will be transferred to the exo site where it can be excised by the associated exo activity and subsequently extended with correct nucleotide.

HSV-1 pol possesses 5′- to 3′-polymerizing and 3′-to5′-exonuclease (exo) activities (7Knopf K.-W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 98: 231-244Google Scholar, 8Marcy A.I. Olivo P.D. Challberg M.D. Coen D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1207-1215Google Scholar), the latter of which is involved in the removal of incorrectly incorporated deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (9Kühn F.J.P. Knopf C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29245-29254Google Scholar, 10Hwang Y.T. Liu B.-Y. Coen D.M. Hwang C.B.C. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 7791-7798Google Scholar, 11Baker R.O. Hall J.D. J. Biol.

The importance of this proofreading activity for maintaining fidelity of DNA replication was suggested by studies from our laboratory that demonstrated the relatively poor ability of HSV-1 pol to discriminate between the correct and incorrect nucleotide for incorporation in single turnover experiments (13Chaudhuri M. Song L. Parris D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8996-9004Google Scholar). That study (13Chaudhuri M. Song L. Parris D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8996-9004Google Scholar) reported that selectivity of correct over incorrect dNTP was ∼300, whereas bacteriophage T4 and T7 DNA polymerases discriminate among dNTPs by a factor of >1000 and >100,000, respectively (14Donlin M.J. Patel S.S. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 538-546Google Scholar, 15Wong I. Patel S.S. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 526-537Google Scholar, 16Capson T.L. Peliska J.A. Kaboord B.F. Frey M.W. Lively C. Dahlberg M. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10984-10994Google Scholar). Previous studies suggested that the exo activity of HSV-1 pol contributes substantially to the fidelity of HSV replication in vivo, because mutation of the conserved exo site III of the HSV-1 pol catalytic subunit was associated with a strong mutator phenotype (10Hwang Y.T. Liu B.-Y. Coen D.M. Hwang C.B.C. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 7791-7798Google Scholar, 17Lu Q. Hwang Y.T. Hwang C.B.C. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 5822-5828Google Scholar, 18Hwang Y.T. Hwang C.B.C. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 2946-2955Google Scholar). Moreover, such pol mutants are genetically unstable and revert or recombine with high frequency (10Hwang Y.T. Liu B.-Y. Coen D.M. Hwang C.B.C. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 7791-7798Google Scholar), suggesting strong in vivo selection against an HSV-1 pol lacking exo activity. To gain a better understanding of the contribution of the associated exo activity of HSV-1 pol in maintaining fidelity of DNA replication, we compared misincorporation and mismatch extension by the wild-type pol with that of a mutant enzyme, which lacks exo function. We selected for study the D368A mutant pol, which converts an aspartate to alanine in the conserved exo site I domain. This site is thought to be involved in the coordination of two divalent metal ions responsible for the exo catalytic activity (19Blanco L. Bernad A. Salas M. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 112: 139-144Google Scholar), and previous studies demonstrated that the D368A mutant pol lacked any detectable exo activity (9Kühn F.J.P. Knopf C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29245-29254Google Scholar, 20Hall J.D. Orth K.L. Sander K.L. Swihart B.M. Senese R.A. J. Gen. Virol. 1995; 76: 2999-3008Google Scholar). A previous study with this mutant pol used a limited set of primer/templates (P/Ts) and concluded that the enzyme possessed a defect in mismatch extension (11Baker R.O. Hall J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24075-24082Google Scholar). Because polymerization, misincorporation, and mismatch extension frequency are dependent upon sequence context (21Goodman M.F. Fygenson D.K. Genetics. 1998; 148: 1475-1482Google Scholar, 22Kunkel T.A. Bebenek K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 497-529Google Scholar), the contribution of the exo activity for maintaining fidelity of DNA synthesis was assessed by varying the P/T at only one position at a time to reduce or eliminate contextual differences. Our results demonstrate that nucleotide selectivity is the major contributor to fidelity and is controlled predominantly at the level of increased affinity for correct versus incorrect nucleotide. Exo activity enhanced nucleotide selectivity by roughly an order of magnitude in multiple turnover reactions. However, the primary effect of exo activity on fidelity was manifest during processive DNA synthesis because mismatches impeded the extension ability of pol, particularly in the presence of UL42 processivity factor, and increased the probability for excision and repair of misincorporated nucleotides. Cells and Viruses—Recombinant baculoviruses were used to express the HSV-1 wild-type (gift of Dr. Robert Lehman, Stanford University) or exo-deficient (D368A) pol genes with or without the UL42 processivity factor gene and have been described elsewhere (9Kühn F.J.P. Knopf C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29245-29254Google Scholar, 23Hernandez T.R. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11227-11232Google Scholar). Recombinant viruses were propagated in Sf9 insect cells at 27 °C as described previously (24Chaudhuri M. Parris D.S. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 10270-10281Google Scholar). Protein Purification—Cells infected with recombinant baculovirus (10 plaque-forming units/cell) were harvested at 40-h postinfection and lysed, and soluble extracts were prepared as described previously (24Chaudhuri M. Parris D.S. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 10270-10281Google Scholar). Protein fractionation was conducted with the aid of a fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences) at room temperature as described below, and fractions were collected on ice. The presence of HSV-1 wild-type or exo-deficient pol in fractions was monitored by enzyme assay using activated calf thymus DNA as template (25Gallo M.L. Dorsky D.I. Crumpacker C.S. Parris D.S. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 5023-5029Google Scholar) with the exception that salt concentration in reactions was reduced to 50 mm KCl. The identity of the pol activity was confirmed by the presence of a polypeptide of 136 kDa following denaturing gel electrophoresis. Cellular extracts were dialyzed against B-2 buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol), clarified by centrifugation at 70,000 × g, and loaded onto a 15-ml DEAE-Sepharose column. Following extensive washing of the column in B-2 buffer, bound proteins were eluted with a 60-ml linear salt gradient of 0–0.5 m KCl in B-2 buffer. The peak fractions containing the relevant HSV-1 pol eluted between 0.12 and 0.33 m KCl. Pol-containing fractions were pooled and applied to a 5-ml hydroxyapatite, type II column equilibrated with buffer D (10 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol). The pol proteins were found in the unbound fractions, which were pooled, dialyzed against buffer C (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol), and loaded onto a 10-ml heparin-Sepharose column equilibrated with buffer C. Bound proteins were eluted with a 60-ml linear gradient from 0–1 m KCl in buffer C. The wild-type and mutant pol eluted between 0.42 and 0.54 m KCl. Peak fractions were collected, diluted with buffer C to achieve a salt concentration of <0.1 m KCl, and loaded onto a 10-ml cellulose phosphate column equilibrated with buffer C. Bound proteins were eluted with a 60-ml linear salt gradient from 0 to 1 m KCl. The pol proteins eluted between 0.25 and 0.34 m KCl and were pooled, concentrated by ultrafiltration using Centricon-100 units (Amicon, Bedford, MA), diluted with an equal volume of buffer E (200 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, and 60% glycerol), flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C. The wild-type and mutant pol proteins were also purified as a complex with UL42 as described previously (24Chaudhuri M. Parris D.S. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 10270-10281Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. DNA Substrates—Gel-purified synthetic oligonucleotides were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (Coralville, IA). The DNA sequences of the oligonucleotides used in the studies described herein are shown in Table I. The primer strands used in each experiment were 45-mers of identical sequence except at the 3′-nucleotide, whereas the template strands with the exception of template 4 were 67-mers, which varied only at positions complementary to the 45th or 46th (extended) nucleotide on the primer strand. The primer strands were radioactively labeled at the 5′ end with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase by standard procedures. Duplex P/T was obtained by mixing primer with a 20% molar excess of template in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 100 mm KCl, heating the mixture to 55 °C and slowly cooling it to room temperature over several hours. Annealed P/T was stored at 4 °C.Table IPrimer/templates used for pre-steady-state and steady-state extension assaysPrimer/templateSequenceaThe sequence shown represents the annealed primer-template, and N demarcates a position on the primer and/or template in which the nucleotide is varied as indicated for each experimentNucleotide added44A/TA5′-GCCACTACGACACCTTGATCGCCTCGCAGCCGTCCAACCAACTCA-3′dTTP3′-CGGTGATGCTGTGGAACTAGCGGAGCGTCGGCAGGTTGGTTGAGTAGGTCTTGTTTCCAGTCGTTTA-5′44A/TN5′-GCCACTACGACACCTTGATCGCCTCGCAGCCGTCCAACCAACTCA-3′dATP, dCTP, dGTP, or dTTP3′-CGGTGATGCTGTGGAACTAGCGGAGCGTCGGCAGGTTGGTTGAGTNGGTCTTGTTTCCAGTCGTTTA-5′44N/NA5′-GCCACTACGACACCTTGATCGCCTCGCAGCCGTCCAACCAACTCN-3′dTTP3′-CGGTGATGCTGTGGAACTAGCGGAGCGTCGGCAGGTTGGTTGAG′NAGGTCTTGTTTCCAGTCGTTTA-5′44A/template 45′-GCCACTACGACACCTTGATCGCCTCGCAGCCGTCCAACCAACTCA-3′dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP3′-CGGTGATGCTGTGGAACTAGCGGAGCGTCGGCAGGTTGGTTGAGTAGGTAATATTTCCAGTCGTTTA-5′a The sequence shown represents the annealed primer-template, and N demarcates a position on the primer and/or template in which the nucleotide is varied as indicated for each experiment Open table in a new tab Exonuclease Assays—Exo activity of each enzyme was evaluated by monitoring the removal of nucleotides from the 3′ end of the 5′ end-labeled 45-mer single-stranded (ss) DNA corresponding to the primer strand used in standard nucleotide incorporation experiments (44A in Table I). The concentration of each enzyme was determined by active-site (for polymerization) titration as described previously (13Chaudhuri M. Song L. Parris D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8996-9004Google Scholar). For the pre-steady-state reactions, enzyme and ssDNA (5:1 molar ratio) were preincubated in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 800 μg of bovine serum albumin/ml, and 2 mm EDTA. Reactions were initiated with MgCl2 to a final concentration of 6 mm and were terminated at intervals (from 10 ms to 50 s) with a large volume of 0.3 m EDTA with the aid of an RQ-3 rapid quench apparatus (Kintek, Clarence, PA). Reaction products were analyzed by electrophoresis through 7 m urea, 12% polyacrylamide gels, and the amount of 45-mer remaining was quantified by phosphorimaging analysis using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) and ImageQuant software (Sunnyvale, CA) and normalized for variations in loading as described previously (13Chaudhuri M. Song L. Parris D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8996-9004Google Scholar). Autoradiograms were obtained from gels exposed to x-ray film at -80 °C using intensifying screens. The pre-steady-state rate constant for excision (kexo) was determined by plotting the concentration of 45-mer remaining ([45-mer]) as a function of time (t). The data were fit to a double exponential function as shown in Equation 1, [45-mer]=ae-bt+ce-dt(Eq. 1) where a is the amplitude of the first exponential, b is the rate constant of the rapid phase, c is the amplitude of the second exponential, and d is the rate constant of the slower phase. Steady-state reactions were conducted manually using a ratio of enzyme:P/T of 1:100 in buffer as indicated above but lacking EDTA. Reactions were initiated by the addition of enzyme, portions were terminated at intervals from 10 s to 2 h with 0.3 m EDTA, and products were analyzed as indicated above. The apparent steady-state rate constant for excision (k) was determined by fitting the data to a single exponential function as shown in Equation 2, [45-mer]=Ae-kt(Eq. 2) where A is the initial concentration of 45-mer. Steady-state Incorporation Assays—Steady-state kinetics of correct or incorrect incorporation of dNTP to produce all 16 possible base pairs were determined by incubating exo-deficient or wild-type HSV-1 pol with the 44A/TN P/Ts, which differed only in the templating position for extension of the primer by one (Table I). Increasing concentrations of a single dNTP were incubated with enzyme and P/T (1:100) at 37 °C under multiple turnover conditions (no DNA trap) as described previously (26Goodman M.F. Creighton S. Bloom L.B. Petruska J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 28: 83-126Google Scholar, 27Creighton S. Bloom L.B. Goodman M.F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 232-256Google Scholar, 28Washington M.T. Johnson R.E. Prakash S. Prakash L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36835-36838Google Scholar). A time course for extension of P/T with maximum concentrations of correct dNTP indicated that reactions with wild-type or mutant pol were steady-state for at least 2 min. Therefore, reactions were quenched with an equal volume of 0.3 m EDTA 2 min after initiation with enzyme and the observed rate (Vobs) was calculated by dividing the concentration of product formed by the reaction time. Vobs was plotted as a function of each dNTP concentration, and the apparent Km and Vmax values for incorporation of each dNTP into each P/T were estimated for those which approached saturation by fitting the data to the Michaelis-Menten function as shown in Equation 3. Vobs=(Vmax)[dNTP]/([dNTP]+Km)(Eq. 3) Steady-state Extension Assays—Steady-state kinetics of extension of all 16 base pairs were measured by incorporation of increasing concentrations of the next correct nucleotide (dTTP) into alternative P/Ts (44N/NA in Table I) at 37 °C for 2 min under multiple turnover conditions as described previously (26Goodman M.F. Creighton S. Bloom L.B. Petruska J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 28: 83-126Google Scholar, 27Creighton S. Bloom L.B. Goodman M.F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 232-256Google Scholar, 29Washington M.T. Johnson R.E. Prakash S. Prakash L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2263-2266Google Scholar). The P/Ts differed only in the base pairs (matched and mismatched) at the 45th position with respect to primer and were extended by incubation with increasing concentrations of dTTP. In some cases, the high dTTP concentrations used for extension of mismatches by the exo-deficient pol promoted utilization of >50% of the substrate during a 2-min incubation. In those cases, reactions were performed for shorter periods (30 s) to ensure steady-state kinetics. The observed rates of extension (Vobs) were obtained by dividing the concentration of 46-mer by the reaction time and plotting these rates as a function of dTTP concentration to estimate the apparent Km and Vmax as described above. The Vmax/Km ratio indicated the efficiency of extension of each base pair. Processive Elongation in the Presence of Three dNTPs—The 45-mer primer strand (44A) was labeled at the 5′ end with [32P] as indicated above and annealed to template 4 (Table I). The P/T (100 nm) was incubated with 50 nm wild-type or exo-deficient pol in the presence of 2 mm EDTA for 10 min, and reactions were initiated by the addition of (final concentrations) MgCl2 (6 mm), dTTP, dCTP, and dGTP (250 μm each) and activated calf thymus DNA trap (500 μg/ml). Reactions were terminated with excess 0.3 m EDTA at various intervals from 0 to 2 s with the aid of a rapid quench instrument, and reaction products were analyzed by electrophoresis through denaturing gels. The efficacy of the DNA trap was demonstrated by the lack of primer extension in control reactions in which the enzyme and DNA trap were added together prior to initiation of reactions and product formation was monitored over the 2-s time course (results not shown). The concentration of products of various sizes that were formed was calculated from the proportion of all of the primers extended to greater than or equal to that size and normalized to total radioactivity in the lanes. The plots of the concentration of each product ([product]) versus time (t) were fit to the exponential burst equation as shown in Equation 4, [Product]=A(1-e-kt)(Eq. 4) to estimate the amplitude (A) and observed burst rate constant (k) except as indicated under “Results.” For each experiment, the concentration of enzyme productively engaged with the P/T was the amplitude of the curve for the plot of products extended by at least one nucleotide (to ≥46 nt in length) as a function of time. The concentration of primer extended to an indicated length at 2 s was calculated from the curve fits and divided by the concentration of productively engaged enzyme to estimate the proportion of enzyme capable of correct extension (≥48 nt), misincorporation (≥49 nt), or mismatch extension with correct nucleotide (≥50 nt). Nucleotide Excision Activity—A mutation in the conserved exo site I domain of the HSV-1 pol (D368A) had been reported previously to lack significant exo activity (9Kühn F.J.P. Knopf C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29245-29254Google Scholar, 20Hall J.D. Orth K.L. Sander K.L. Swihart B.M. Senese R.A. J. Gen. Virol. 1995; 76: 2999-3008Google Scholar). To confirm the complete absence of exo activity in D368A pol and to ensure that the mutation did not compromise the polymerizing activity of the enzyme, we purified the mutant and wild-type enzymes from Sf9 insect cells infected with recombinant baculoviruses, which expressed these genes as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Comparable purities were achieved for the D368A and wild-type enzymes, which were estimated to be >95% by comparison of Coomassie Blue-stained bands to bovine serum albumin controls (13Chaudhuri M. Song L. Parris D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8996-9004Google Scholar) and by the absence of other polypeptides on silver-stained gels (data not shown). Active site titration of D368A and wild-type pol preparations indicated that each contained a comparable proportion of active enzyme (∼40 and 50% active, respectively). The exo activities of the purified pols were analyzed under sensitive pre-steady-state conditions using 5′ end-labeled 45-mer ssDNA (10 nm) and 50 nm enzyme. Reactions were initiated by the addition of MgCl2, and the products were separated by denaturing gel electrophoresis. Concentration of 45-mer remaining as a function of time was fit to a double exponential function (Equation 1), and the results demonstrated rapid removal of nucleotide from the 3′ end of 20% ssDNA (rate constant of 21.5 ± 6.6 s-1) by the wild-type pol (Fig. 1A). This was followed by slower excision (rate constant of 0.065 ± 0.006 s-1) of the remainder of the DNA, most probably reflecting multiple turnovers of enzyme with DNA substrate. Under the same conditions, no excision of the 45-mer by D368A mutant pol was observed over a period of 50 s (Fig. 1A). To better assess whether the D368A mutant was capable of digesting the ssDNA after extensive periods of incubation, wild-type or mutant enzymes were incubated with the ssDNA at a 1:100 ratio to allow for sustained multiple turnovers. The steady-state rate constant for the removal of the 3′-nucleotide from the ssDNA by the wild-type enzyme was estimated at 0.047 ± 0.003 s-1 by fitting the data to Equation 2 (Fig. 1B) in close agreement with that observed for slow excision with high enzyme:DNA ratios (Fig. 1A). However, no loss of 45-mer was detected even when incubated with D368A pol for up to 2 h (Fig. 1B). The D368A pol also failed to excise nucleotide from mismatched P/T under pre-steady-state or steady-state conditions (results not shown but see Fig. 4A, below). Thus, D368A pol is completely deficient in 3′- to 5′-exo activity.Fig. 4Mismatch extension assays. The D368A exo-deficient mutant (A, C, and D) or wild-type pol (B, E, and F) (1.25 nm) was incubated with primer/templates (125 nm) as shown (44N/TA in Table I) where N is the 3′-nucleotide on the primer strand. Reactions contained increasing concentrations (long open triangle) of next correct nucleotide (dTTP), and the amount of primer extended following a 30-s or 2-min incubation period (for D368A or wild-type pol, respectively) was quantified. A and B, representative autoradiograms of the products of extension are shown. The positions the primer (P) and other products are as indicated in the legend to Fig. 2. For the 44G/TA P/T, extension by D368A approached saturation with the lower concentration range (0–250 μm) of dTTP shown on the autoradiogram compared with that shown (0–1000 μm) with the other mismatched P/Ts. The rate of extension at each concentration was plotted as a function of time, and if saturation was approached, the data were fit to Equation 3 to estimate the apparent Vmax and Km. For those plots in which dTTP concentrations did not approach saturation, the slope of a linear fit of the data was used to estimate extension efficiency (Vmax/Km). The plots for extension of matched (C and E) and mismatched (D and F) primer termini are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We next determined the pre-steady-state kinetic constants for correct nucleotide (dTTP) incorporation by D368A pol as described previously (13Chaudhuri M. Song L. Parris D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8996-9004Google Scholar) and found that D368A pol bound P/T and dTTP in productive complex with virtually the same affinity as did the wild-type pol (Kd (DNA) = 44 and 31 nm and Kd (dTTP) = 1.6 and 1.7 μm for the wild-type and D368A pols, respectively). However, the rate constant (kpol) for polymerization by the D368A mutant pol was 199 ± 26 s-1, ∼20% faster than the 157 ± 31 s-1 reported for dTTP incorporation by the wild-type pol (13Chaudhuri M. Song L. Parris D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8996-9004Google Scholar). The slower rate constant for the wild-type enzyme most probably reflects competition of the forward polymerization reaction with the competing excision reaction (9Kühn F.J.P. Knopf C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29245-29254Google Scholar). Taken together, these results demonstrate that the D368A mutation destroys exo activity without significantly altering the polymerization domain or its inherent function. Steady-state Correct and Incorrect dNTP Incorporation—Because the D368A mutation did not alter the polymerization function of HSV-1 pol, we reasoned that the impact of the pol-associated exo activity on nucleotide selectivity could be determined by comparing the efficiency of incorporation of correct and incorrect dNTPs by the wild-type and D368A pols. The D368A or wild-type pol was incubated at 37 °C with a 100-fold excess of 5′ end-labeled P/T (44A/TA) and increasing concentrations of the next correct nucleotide (dTTP). The products formed during a 2-min incubation time, previously determined to reflect steady-state rates of accumulation, were assessed qualitatively by autoradiography (Fig. 2, A and B), and extension was quantified by phosphorimaging analysis (Fig. 2, C–F). As found for pre-steady-state rates of extension, the steady-state rate for correct extension by the wild-type pol was slower than that of D368A pol (see Table II). Incubation of the wild-type pol under these conditions resulted not only in extension but also in degradation of the primer strand (Fig. 2B), confirming that the slower steady-state rate of extension was due to competition between the polymerization and exo activities. This competition also resulted in a 6-fold higher apparent Km for dTTP and an 8-fold reduced efficiency (Vmax/Km) for extension by the wild-type compared with the exo-deficient pol (Table II and Fig. 2).Table IISteady-state incorporation of dNTPs by mutant and wild-type polPrimer/templateBase pair formedD368AaThe indicated primer-templates (125 nm) were incubated for 2 min with 1.25 nm wild-type or D368A mutant pol in the presence of increasing concentrations of correct or incorrect nucleotide.

In cells of a pex19 disruption strain (Hppex19), induced on methanol, peroxisome structures were not detectable; peroxisomal matrix proteins accumulated in the cytosol, whereas peroxisomal membrane proteins (PMPs) were mislocalized to the cytosol (Pex3p) and mitochondria (Pex14p) or strongly reduced to undetectable levels (Pex10p). The defect in peroxisome formation in Hppex19 cells was largely suppressed upon overproduction of HpPex3p or a fusion protein that consisted of the first 50 N-terminal amino acids of Pex3p and GFP. In these cells PMPs were again correctly sorted to peroxisomal structures, which also harbored peroxisomal matrix proteins. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae pex19 cells overproduction of ScPex3p led to the formation of numerous vesicles that contained PMPs but lacked the major matrix protein thiolase. Taken together, our data are consistent with a function of Pex19p in membrane protein assembly and function. We have cloned and characterized the Hansenula polymorpha PEX19 gene.

Peroxisomes are single membrane-bound organelles that are present in virtually all eukaryotic cells. The biogenesis and maintenance of these organelles requires a fine-tuned orchestration of various processes, including among others protein sorting, membrane formation, and organelle fission. During the last 20 years the knowledge of the principles of peroxisome formation has rapidly expanded, and over 30 genes (designated PEX genes) have now been characterized that are involved in this process (for a recent review see Ref. 1Purdue P.E. Lazarow P.B. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 701-752Google Scholar). Most PEX genes identified so far are required for sorting and translocation of peroxisomal matrix proteins across the peroxisomal membrane. Matrix proteins are synthesized in the cytosol and post-translationally imported into peroxisomes. Two peroxisomal targeting signals (PTS1 and PTS2) 1The abbreviations used are: PTS1, -2, peroxisomal targeting signals 1 and 2; PMP, peroxisomal membrane protein; GFP, green fluorescent protein; eGFP, enhanced GFP; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; FCS, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy; AMO, amine oxidase; AO, alcohol oxidase; CAT, catalase; WT, wild type; DHAS, dihydroxyacetone synthase; mPTS, regions that contain peroxisomal targeting information. 1The abbreviations used are: PTS1, -2, peroxisomal targeting signals 1 and 2; PMP, peroxisomal membrane protein; GFP, green fluorescent protein; eGFP, enhanced GFP; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; FCS, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy; AMO, amine oxidase; AO, alcohol oxidase; CAT, catalase; WT, wild type; DHAS, dihydroxyacetone synthase; mPTS, regions that contain peroxisomal targeting information. are known that are recognized by soluble receptor proteins (Pex5p or Pex7p, respectively) that sort these proteins to the target organelle. In the case of peroxisomal membrane proteins (PMPs) several internal regions have been defined that contain peroxisomal targeting information (designated mPTS). However, consensus sequences, like those for matrix proteins, have not been defined yet. Pex19p has been proposed to play a role as a general mPTS receptor, but whether this is indeed the case is still a matter of debate (for a recent review see Ref. 1Purdue P.E. Lazarow P.B. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 701-752Google Scholar). Observations that favor a function of Pex19p as mPTS-receptor include that, analogous to the PTS receptors for matrix proteins, in most organisms Pex19p has a dual location and is found in the cytosol and, to a minor extent, associated with peroxisomes (2Snyder W.B. Faber K.N. Wenzel T.J. Koller A. Luers G.H. Rangell L. Keller G.A. Subramani S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1745-1761Google Scholar, 3Sacksteder K.A. Jones J.M. South S.T. Li X. Liu Y. Gould S.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 931-944Google Scholar). Also in line with the putative mPTS receptor function is the observation that Pex19p physically interacts with multiple peroxisomal membrane proteins (3Sacksteder K.A. Jones J.M. South S.T. Li X. Liu Y. Gould S.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 931-944Google Scholar, 4Snyder W.B. Koller A. Choy A.J. Subramani S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1171-1178Google Scholar, 5Fransen M. Wylin T. Brees C. Mannaerts G.P. van Veldhoven P.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4413-4424Google Scholar). Contrary to what may be expected for an mPTS receptor, Pex19p does not exclusively interact with the regions of PMPs that contain sorting information for the peroxisomal membrane. Moreover, mutations are known that affect targeting of PMPs to the peroxisomal membrane but not the interaction with Pex19p (2Snyder W.B. Faber K.N. Wenzel T.J. Koller A. Luers G.H. Rangell L. Keller G.A. Subramani S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1745-1761Google Scholar, 5Fransen M. Wylin T. Brees C. Mannaerts G.P. van Veldhoven P.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4413-4424Google Scholar). The absence of peroxisomal membrane structures is the expected phenotype of cells lacking a general mPTS receptor. However, this phenotype may also be explained by a defect in the formation/assembly of the peroxisomal membrane, resulting in the absence of the target membrane for newly synthesized PMPs. Saccharomyces cerevisiae pex19 mutants (6Götte K. Girzalsky W. Linkert M. Baumgart E. Kammerer S. Kunau W.H. Erdmann R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 616-628Google Scholar, 7Hettema E.H. Girzalsky W. van den Berg M. Erdmann R. Distel B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 223-233Google Scholar) and human fibroblasts from patients with defects in PEX19 lack peroxisomal membrane structures and display significantly reduced levels of PMPs that are mislocalized to the cytosol or other cell organelles (3Sacksteder K.A. Jones J.M. South S.T. Li X. Liu Y. Gould S.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 931-944Google Scholar). However, in Pichia pastoris pex19 cells, small vesicular structures are observed that have been proposed to represent precursors of peroxisomes (2Snyder W.B. Faber K.N. Wenzel T.J. Koller A. Luers G.H. Rangell L. Keller G.A. Subramani S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1745-1761Google Scholar) and in Yarrowia lipolytica pex19 cells structures are found that strongly resemble WT peroxisomes in size, shape, and protein composition (8Lambkin G.R. Rachubinski R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3353-3364Google Scholar). However, these organelles display a major defect in matrix protein import and reduced levels of PMPs. To shed further light on a putative generalized function of Pex19p, we cloned the Hansenula polymorpha PEX19 gene and analyzed its role in peroxisome biogenesis. In a constructed H. polymorpha PEX19 disruption strain, peroxisomal structures were undetectable and PMPs were mislocalized. However, we observed that peroxisomes could be formed in the absence of HpPex19p upon overproduction of HpPex3p or the first 50 N-terminal amino acids of this protein, fused to GFP. These data suggest that H. polymorpha Pex19p is not essential for sorting of PMPs. Also in S. cerevisiae pex19 cells peroxisomal membranes could be reintroduced by overproduction of ScPex3p. The details of this work are included in this report. Organisms and Growth—The H. polymorpha, P. pastoris, and S. cerevisiae strains used in this study are listed in Table I. H. polymorpha cells were cultivated at 37 °C, P. pastoris and S. cerevisiae at 30 °C. Yeast cells were grown on 1% yeast extract, 1% peptone, and 1% glucose, selective minimal media containing 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (Difco) or mineral media (9Van Dijken J.P. Otto R. Harder W. Arch. Microbiol. 1976; 111: 137-144Google Scholar) supplemented with glucose (0.5%), methanol (0.5%), or glycerol (0.5%) as carbon source and methylamine (0.25%) or ammonium sulfate (0.25%) as nitrogen source. S. cerevisiae cells were grown on yeast nitrogen base containing 0.1% oleic acid, 0.05% Tween 40, 0.1% yeast extract, and 0.1% glucose. When required, amino acids or uracil were added to a final concentration of 30 μg/ml. For growth on agar plates, the media were supplemented with 1.5% agar. Escherichia coli was grown on LB medium (10Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml), or kanamycin (50 μg/ml) when required.Table IStrains used in This studyStrainsRelevant propertiesReferenceH. polymorphaNCYC495Wild type, ura3 leu1.1(45)pex19::URA3PEX19 disruption strain, leu 1.1This studypex19::PPEX19PEX19C286Spex19 with one-copy integration of plasmid pHOR40This studypex19::PPEX3PEX19-GFPpex19 containing the plasmid pHIPX6-PEX19-GFPThis studypex19::PPEX3PEX19-GFP::PAODsRED-SKLpex19::PPEX3PEX19-GFP with one-copy integration of plasmid pHIPX4-DsRED-SKLThis studypex3::LEU1.1 (ura3)PEX3 disruption strain, ura3(11)NCYC495::PAOPEX3N50-GFP (HF74)NCYC495 with one-copy integration of plasmid pFEM75(19)pex19::PAOPEX3N50-GFPpex19 with one-copy integration of plasmid pFEM75This studypex14::PPEX14PEX14-GFPNCYC495 with one-copy integration of plasmid pHIPX10-PEX14eGFPΔPstIThis studypex19::pex14::PPEX14PEX14-GFPpex19 with one-copy integration of plasmid pHIPX10-PEX14eGFPΔPstIThis studypex19::pex3::PPEX3PEX3-GFPpex19 with one-copy integration of plasmid pHOR46This studypex19::PAOPEX3pex19 with multicopy integration of plasmid pHIPX4-PEX3This studypex3::PAOPEX19pex3 with multicopy integration of plasmid pHIPX4-PEX19This studypex19::PPEX3MYC-PEX19pex19 containing the plasmid pHIPX6-MYC-PEX19This studypex3::pex19::PAMOPEX31-50-GFPpex3, pex19 with one-copy integration of plasmid pFEM167This studyS. cerevisiaeUTL-7AWT(46)pex19PEX19 disruption strain(6)pex19 [Pex13p-tev-ProtA]pex19 producing Protein A tagged Pex 13pThis studypex19 [Pex13p-tev-ProA] + pTF14pex19 [Pex13p-tev-ProA] overproducing PEX3 (FOX3 promoter in YEp352)This studypex19 [Pex13p-tev-ProA] + pTF15pex19 [Pex13p-tev-ProA] overproducing PEX3 (CTA1 promoter in YEp352)This studyP. pastorisP. pastoris SKF13PEX19 disruption strain(2) Open table in a new tab Molecular Techniques—Standard recombinant DNA techniques were carried out essentially according to Sambrook et al.

Primers used for polymerase chain reactions in this study are listed in Table II. Transformation of H. polymorpha cells and site-specific integration of single or multiple copies of plasmid DNA in genomic AOX-, PEX3-, or AMO-locus was performed as described previously (11Baerends R.J.S.

For the replacement of the wild type PEX14 gene with the PEX14-GFP fusion gene, the plasmid pHIPX10-PEX14eGFPΔPstI was linearized with SalI. The plasmid pHOR50 was linearized using BsgI for the integration into the PEX19-locus.Table IIPrimers used in This studyPrimersSequenceRB12CCC AGA TCT TGA AAA GTT TCT AAA CCCRB13GGG GTC GAC TTT TGC AAG TGA TTCRB11GGG CTG CAG TTA TGG TTA ATA TGA GCG−40 uni (Stratagene)GTT TTC CCA GTC ACG ACRB16TAA GGA TCC ATG AGC GAG AAA AAG TCC GRB17CTT TGT CGA CCT ATG TTT GTT TGC AAG TGRB18CCC TGT CGA CCT ATG TTT GTT TAC TAG TGT CTT CCA GTT CRB26GGG GGA TCC ATG GAG CAG AAG TTG ATT TCT GAG GAA GAC TTG AGC GAG AAA AAG TCC GRB36GAG GCG GCC GCG GTT CTT GTG GAT TCG ACRB37GGG GGA TCC TTA TGG TTA ATA TGA GCG19GFP-startCCC AAG CTT ATG AGC GAG AAA AAG TCC G19GFP-stopGTG TTT GTT TGC AAG TGT CTT CCDsRED-1AGA GGA TCC ATG GCC TCC TCC GAG GAC GDsRED-2AGA GTC GAC TTA CAG CTT CGA CTT GTA CAA TTC GTC CAT ACC Open table in a new tab Isolation and Characterization of the H. polymorpha PEX19 Gene—P. pastoris pex19 (SKF13) was transformed with an H. polymorpha genomic library in the P. pastoris vector pYM8 (16Shen S. Sulter G. Jeffries T.W. Cregg J.M. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 216: 93-102Google Scholar). Histidine prototrophic transformants were screened for the ability to grow on methanol. From a selected positive strain the plasmid, designated pHP19-5, was rescued and transformed to E. coli dH5α. To facilitate sequencing, restriction analysis and construction of subclones, a 2.9-kb DNA fragment obtained from pHP19-5 was subcloned as an NheI-HindIII fragment into HindIII-XbaI-digested phagemid pBluescript II KS+ (pBSII KS+, Stratagene Inc., San Diego, CA), resulting in pHOR28. Double strand sequencing was carried out on an ABI 373A automatic sequencer (Applied Biosystems Inc.) using the Taq Dye Deoxy Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit. For DNA and amino acid sequence analysis the PC-GENE™ program release 6.70 (IntelliGenetics, Mountain View, CA) was used. The BLASTN algorithm (17Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Google Scholar) was used to search the GenBank™ data base (Release 91.0, October 15, 1995) for DNA, and protein sequences showing similarity to the HpPEX19 gene and its translation product. The nucleotide sequence of HpPEX19 was deposited at GenBank™ and was assigned accession number AF176708. PEX19 Disruption in H. polymorpha—For disruption of the complete H. polymorpha PEX19 gene the H. polymorpha URA3 gene was used (18Merckelbach A. Godecke S. Janowicz Z.A. Hollenberg C.P. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1993; 40: 361-364Google Scholar). The URA3 was isolated as a BglII, PstI fragment and ligated between the two flanking regions of the H. polymorpha PEX19 gene. These regions were obtained by PCR on pHOR28 using primers RB12 and RB13 containing the sequence upstream the start codon, digested with BglII and the primers -40 uni × RB11, containing the sequence downstream the stop codon, digested with PstI. This fragment was used to transform H. polymorpha NCYC495 leu1.1 ura3. Methanol utilization-deficient (Mut-) colonies were selected. Correct integration was analyzed by Southern blotting using the ECL direct nucleic acid labeling and detection system (Amersham Biosciences, Arlington Heights, IL). Plasmid Constructions—Expression plasmids pHIPX4-PEX3 (14Kiel J.A.K.W. Keizer-Gunnink I. Krause T. Komori M. Veenhuis M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 434-438Google Scholar), pHIPX4-PEX3N50GFP (pFEM75) (19Baerends R.J.S. Faber K.N. Kram A.M. Kiel J.A.K.W. van der Klei I.J. Veenhuis M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9986-9995Google Scholar), pHOR46 (15Haan G.J. Faber K.N. Baerends R.J. Koek A. Krikken A. Kiel J.A.K.W. van der Klei I.J. Veenhuis M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26609-26617Google Scholar), and pHIPZ5-PEX3N50GFP (pFEM167) (20Faber K.N. Haan G.J. Baerends R.J.S. Kram A.M. Veenhuis M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11026-11033Google Scholar) have been described before. pHIPX4-PEX19 (pHOR32) was constructed as follows. Using PCR and primers RB16 and RB17 a BamHI site was introduced upstream the start codon, and a SalI site downstream the stop codon of the H. polymorpha PEX19 gene. These sites were used to clone the PEX19 gene into a BamHI-SalI-digested pHIPX4 (21Gietl C. Faber K.N. van der Klei I.J. Veenhuis M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3151-3155Google Scholar). For localization of HpPex19p, MYC-PEX19 was expressed under control of the PEX3 promoter. For this plasmid pHIPX6-MYC-PEX19, MYC-PEX19 was amplified using the primers RB17 × RB26, resulting in a product containing an in-frame fusion between the MYC tag and the PEX19 gene. This PCR product was then digested with BamHI and SalI and ligated into the BamHI-SalI digested pHIPX6 (14Kiel J.A.K.W. Keizer-Gunnink I. Krause T. Komori M. Veenhuis M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 434-438Google Scholar). A second construct, used for the localization of HpPex19p, included a hybrid gene under control of the PEX3 promoter encoding a HpPex19p.GFP fusion protein (pHIPX6-PEX19-GFP). The green fluorescent protein (GFP, Clontech) was fused to the C terminus of Pex19p. The PEX19 gene was amplified using primers 19GFP-start and 19GFP-stop, resulting in a product lacking the stop codon of the PEX19 gene. This PCR product was then digested with HindIII and ligated into pANL31 (22Leao-Helder A.N. Krikken A.M. Van der Klei I.J. Kiel J.A.K.W. Veenhuis M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40749-40756Google Scholar), resulting in plasmid pHIPZ-PEX19-GFP, containing an in-frame fusion of the whole PEX19 gene fused to the eGFP gene. This product was subsequently restricted with BamHI and SmaI, and ligated into a BamHI, SmaI-digested pHIPX6. To identify peroxisomes, the gene encoding DsRed-T1-SKL was expressed under control of the alcohol oxidase promoter (PAOX). A DNA fragment encoding an in-frame fusion of DsRED-T1 and SKL was obtained by PCR using primers DsRed-1 and DsRed-2, and a plasmid containing DsRed-T1 (23Bevis B.J. Glick B.S. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 83-87Google Scholar) in-frame fused to HDEL containing a spacer peptide THGMDELYK, kindly donated by B. Glick. The PCR product was digested with BamHI and SalI and subsequently ligated in pHIPX4 digested with BamHI and SalI, resulting in plasmid pHIPX4-DsRed-T1-SKL. For the construction of a gene encoding Myc-Pex19p containing an amino acid substitution in the farnesylation site, plasmid pHOR50 was constructed. For this purpose plasmid pHIPX13, containing the PEX19 promoter, was constructed by amplification of the PEX19 promoter using primers RB36 and RB37. The PCR product was then ligated as a NotI-BamHI fragment in pHIPX4, digested with NotI and BamHI. For the plasmid pHOR40 the PEX19 gene was amplified using primers RB26 and RB18, resulting in a product containing an N-terminal myc-tagged HpPex19p with an amino acid substitution (C286S) at the C terminus. The PCR product was then digested with BamHI and SalI and inserted into BamHI-SalI-digested pHIPX13. For the localization of HpPex14p, a plasmid encoding a fusion protein consisting of HpPex14p containing GFP at the C terminus was constructed. This was performed by digestion of pHIPX10-PEX14eGFP, kindly donated by M. Komori (Osaka Prefecture University, Osaka, Japan), with PstI. This resulted in plasmid pHIPX10-PEX14eGFPΔPstI. S. cerevisiae strains, containing genomic copies of a hybrid ScPEX13 gene encoding ScPex13p fused to the tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site followed by a Protein A tag (-TEV-ProtA) were obtained by transforming haploid yeast cells with the corresponding PCR product according to Knop et al. (24Knop M. Siegers K. Pereira G. Zachariae W. Winsor B. Nasmyth K. Schiebel E. Yeast. 1999; 15: 963-972Google Scholar). Scpex19 strains overproducing ScPEX3 were obtained by transforming Scpex19 with plasmid pTF14 (expression plasmid containing ScPEX3 under control of the FOX3 promoter) or pTF15 (expression plasmid containing PEX3 under control of the CTA1 promoter). Cloning strategies and sequences of primers used to make pTF14 and pTF15 are available upon request. Biochemical Methods—Crude extracts of H. polymorpha cells were prepared as described by Baerends et al. (19Baerends R.J.S. Faber K.N. Kram A.M. Kiel J.A.K.W. van der Klei I.J. Veenhuis M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9986-9995Google Scholar). Subcellular fractionation of H. polymorpha cells was performed as detailed before (25van der Klei I.J. van der Heide M. Baerends R.J.S. Rechinger K.B. Nicolay K. Kiel J.A.K.W. Veenhuis M. Curr. Genet. 1998; 34: 1-11Google Scholar) except that a modified sucrose gradient was used consisting of 4 ml of 65%, 9 ml of 50%, 9 ml of 40%, and 4 ml of 35% (w/v)-sucrose in buffer B (5 mm MES, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm KCl, pH 5.5). Flotation centrifugation of H. polymorpha fractions was carried out according to Goodman et al. (26Goodman J.M. Maher J. Silver P.A. Pacifico A. Sanders D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3464-3468Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae cells were fractionated by differential centrifugation. Cells were converted to spheroplasts using zymolyase (20 units/g cells). Spheroplasts were washed three times in a solution containing 1.2 m sorbitol and homogenized in 0.6 m sorbitol in 5 mm MES, pH 6.0, supplemented with 0.5 mm EDTA and 1 mm KCl (fractionation buffer). Intact cells and nuclei were removed from the homogenate by two centrifugation steps at 600 × g for 10 min. The resulting post nuclear supernatant (T) was further fractionated by differential centrifugation resulting in a 25,000 × g pellet, 25,000 × g supernatant, 100,000 × g pellet, and a 100,000 × g supernatant. Pellet fractions were resuspended in fractionation buffer. Equivalent volumes of these fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Enzyme activities of alcohol oxidase (27Verduyn C. Van Dijken J.P. Scheffers W.A. J. Microbiol. Methods. 1984; 2: 15-25Google Scholar) and cytochrome c oxidase (28Douma A.C. Veenhuis M. de Koning W. Evers M.E. Harder W. Arch. Microbiol. 1985; 143: 237-243Google Scholar) were assayed as described. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay system (Bio-Rad GmbH, Munich, Germany) using bovine serum albumin as standard. SDS-PAGE (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar) and native gel electrophoresis (30Musgrove J.E. Johnson R.A. Ellis R.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 163: 529-534Google Scholar) was carried out as described. Western blotting was performed as detailed by Kyhse-Andersen (31Kyhse-Andersen J. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1984; 10: 203-209Google Scholar). Blots were decorated using specific antibodies against various proteins using either the Protoblot immunoblotting system (Promega Biotec) or a BM Chemiluminescence Western blotting kit (Roche Applied Science, Almere, The Netherlands). Polyclonal antibodies against HpPex19p were raised in rabbit, using synthetically synthesized HpPex19p peptides (amino acids 1-15 and 194-208). Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy—HpPex19.GFP present in soluble and membrane fractions of methanol-grown H. polymorpha pex19::PPEX3PEX19-GFP cells was analyzed by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS). H. polymorpha cells that did not produce HpPex19.GFP were used as controls. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, containing 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture), and broken using a French pressure cell. The cell lysate was centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g (4 °C) and resulted in a soluble fraction (designated S), which was used for FCS measurements. The pellet (P) was washed once in buffer A and subsequently resuspended in buffer A containing 1% digitonine to solubilize membrane proteins, followed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h (4 °C). The supernatant, representing the solubilized membrane protein fraction (designated P), was also used for FCS measurements. The ConfoCor2 (Zeiss the Netherlands BV, Weesp, The Netherlands), a dual channel system based on a Zeiss Axiovert 100M inverted microscope, was used to acquire fluorescence fluctuation data. The system is equipped with an argon ion laser line of 488 nm and a 40 × 1.2 water immersion apochromatic objective and is controlled by AIM3.1 software (EMBL Heidelberg, Germany). The system was calibrated by optimizing the position of the pinhole and the correction ring of the objective lens using a solution of 5 nm Alexa Fluor 488 (Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands). Samples were measured in 96-well plates. Autocorrelation traces were acquired during 10 or 20 s at room temperature and repeated 20 times. Autocorrelation curves were globally analyzed to multicomponent three-dimensional Brownian motion models, which included triplet kinetics using the FCS data processor 1.3 software (the Scientific Software Technologies Center of Belarusian State University, Belarus) as detailed before (32Wang D. Visser N.V. Veenhuis M. van der Klei I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43340-43345Google Scholar, 33Widengren J. Mets U. Rigler R. J. Phys. Chem. 1995; 99: 13368-13379Google Scholar, 34Beechem J.M. Gratton E. Ameloot M. Knutson J.R. Brand L. Lakowicz J.R. Topics in Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1991: 241Google Scholar). Microscopy—Fluorescence microscopy was performed as described before (19Baerends R.J.S. Faber K.N. Kram A.M. Kiel J.A.K.W. van der Klei I.J. Veenhuis M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9986-9995Google Scholar). Confocal laser scanning microscopy on living cells was carried out using a Zeiss LSM 510 META-NLO confocal laser scanning microscope (Zeiss, the Netherlands BV) equipped with a Zeiss plan-apochromatic 63× numerical aperture 1.4 objective. GFP fluorescence was analyzed by excitation of the cells with a 488-nm argon/krypton laser, and fluorescence was detected by a BP 500-550 Photo Multiplier Tube (PMT). Whole cells were treated for 10 min at 37 °C with 50 μg/ml Hoechst 33258 (Sigma, Nieuwegein, The Netherlands) to stain nuclei. Mitochondria were stained by incubation of intact cells for 30 min at 37 °C with 0.5 μg/ml MitoTracker Red Cm-H2XROS (Molecular Probes) followed by extensive washing with medium. Cells incubated with Hoechst 33258 were analyzed using excitation at 760 nm (Ti-Sapphire laser) and detection by a BP 435- to 485-nm PMT. Cells treated with MitoTracker were excited at 543 nm (He laser), and fluorescence was detected using a BP 565- to 615-nm PMT. Whole cells were fixed and prepared for electron microscopy and immunocytochemistry as described previously (35Waterham H.R. Titorenko V.I. Haima P. Cregg J.M. Harder W. Veenhuis M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 737-749Google Scholar). Immunolabeling was performed on ultrathin sections of Unicryl-embedded cells, using specific antibodies against various proteins and gold-conjugated goat-anti-rabbit antibodies, or goat-anti-mouse antibodies (35Waterham H.R. Titorenko V.I. Haima P. Cregg J.M. Harder W. Veenhuis M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 737-749Google Scholar). Cloning of the H. polymorpha PEX19 Gene—A P. pastoris PEX19 disruption strain was functionally complemented by transformation with an H. polymorpha genomic library. The plasmid, recovered from complemented P. pastoris cells, contained an open reading frame encoding a protein with high homology to Pex19 proteins (e.g. 41% identity to P. pastoris Pex19p). Also, it contained the typical Pex19p farnesylation site (-CKQT) at the extreme C terminus. To further substantiate that the cloned gene represented H. polymorpha PEX19, a disruption strain (Hppex19) was constructed. Cells of this strain were unable to grow on methanol, which is characteristic for H. polymorpha PEX mutants (36Cregg J.M. van der Klei I.J. Sulter G.J. Veenhuis M. Harder W. Yeast. 1990; 6: 87-97Google Scholar). Based on these findings we concluded that the cloned gene represented HpPEX19. The sequence of the complementing DNA fragment was deposited at GenBank™ (accession number AF176708). To characterize the peroxisome phenotype of Hppex19 cells in detail, the cells were grown in a glucose-limited chemostat using choline as sole nitrogen source. These conditions result in massive peroxisome proliferation and strong induction of peroxisome matrix and membrane proteins in WT cells (37Zwart K.B. Veenhuis M. Harder W. Antonie Van Leeuwenhoek. 1983; 49: 369-385Google Scholar). Western blot analysis of crude cell extracts revealed that the levels of the matrix proteins alcohol oxidase (AO), catalase (CAT), and amine oxidase (AMO) were similar in WT and Hppex19 cells (Fig. 1). Also the peroxisomal membrane proteins (PMPs) HpPex3p and HpPex14p as well as the PTS1 receptor Pex5p were detected at similar levels in both strains. However, the level of the integral PMP HpPex10p was strongly reduced in Hppex19 cells and below the limit of detection. Electron microscopy studies revealed that peroxisomes or peroxisomal remnant structures (ghosts) were not detectable in Hppex19 cells (Fig. 2A). Immunocytochemistry demonstrated that the matrix proteins AO, CAT, AMO, and dihydroxyacetone synthase (DHAS) were mislocalized to the cytosol (see Fig. 2B for AO). Using specific antisera against PMPs, α-HpPex3p-specific labeling was observed on the cytosol, whereas α-HpPex14p-dependent labeling was confined to discrete spots on mitochondrial profiles (data not shown). The presence of cytosolic HpPex3p and the localization of HpPex14p at mitochondria was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 2, C-E). To this"
https://openalex.org/W1981188294,"The HR6A and HR6B genes, homologs of the yeast RAD6 gene, encode ubiquitin conjugating enzymes that are required for postreplication repair (PRR) of DNA and damage-induced mutagenesis. We show here that consistent with its role as a PRR protein, HR6 protein (referred as RAD6) expression is cell cycle regulated, with maximal levels expressed in late S/G2 phases of the cell cycle. Exposure of MCF10A cells to adriamycin (ADR) causes enhancement in the levels of RAD6B mRNA and protein. Inclusion of actinomycin D abolishes both basal and ADR-induced RAD6B transcription indicating that ADR-induced effects on RAD6B transcription result from an increase in transcriptional activity rather than from regulation of RAD6B mRNA stability. The increase in RAD6 protein expression observed in ADR-treated cells is dependent upon transcription and de novo protein synthesis, as addition of actinomycin D and cycloheximide eliminated the induction effects. Using in vivo crosslinking experiments, we demonstrate that only a small proportion of RAD6 is associated with chromatin in untreated MCF10A cells. However, treatment with ADR or cisplatin is accompanied by a significant increase and redistribution of RAD6 to DNA, and RAD6, RAD18, PCNA, phosphohistone H3, as well as p53 proteins are all found in the DNA fractions. These findings suggest that although RAD6 protein is present in the nucleus, its recruitment to the chromatin appears to be modulated by DNA damage. Whereas MCF10A cells engineered to overexpress ectopic RAD6B are significantly more resistant to ADR and cisplatin as compared to empty vector-transfected cells, MCF10A cells stably transfected with antisense RAD6B display hypersensitivity to these damage-inducing drugs. Analysis of PRR capacities in cisplatin-treated MCF10A cells stably transfected with empty vector, RAD6B or antisense RAD6B showed that whereas RAD6B-overexpressing and vector control MCF10A cells possessed the ability to convert newly synthesized DNA to higher molecular weight species, MCF10A cells depleted of RAD6B are PRR-compromised. Although no human diseases have been linked to mutations in the PRR pathway genes, these data suggest that RAD6 may play an essential role in DNA damage tolerance and recovery via modulation of PRR, and that imbalances in the levels of RAD6 could lead to changes in drug sensitivity and damage-induced mutagenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2097263763,"Retinoid X receptor α (RXRα) is a member of the steroid hormone receptor superfamily. Using yeast two-hybrid screening, β-galactosidase assays, and pull-down assays, we show that RNF8, a RING finger protein recently isolated as a protein binding to a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, binds to RXRα through the N-terminal regions of both proteins. In COS7 cells, overexpressed RNF8 colocalized and interacted with RXRα in the nucleus, as shown by fluorescence resonance energy transfer. A point mutation of RNF8, Cys-403 to Ser (C403S), which disrupts the RING finger structure, or deletion of the N-terminal region (ΔN) of RNF8 prevented localization of RNF8 to the nucleus without affecting nuclear localization of RXRα. Although transient overexpression of RNF8 had little effect on RXRα ubiquitination, RNF8 dose-dependently enhanced RXRα-mediated transactivation of the RXR-responsive element (RXRE)-bearing gene promoter without the addition of its ligand, 9-cis-retinoic acid (RA), and up-regulated the expression of the genes downstream of RXRE as well as an RA-response element. This transactivation-enhancing activity was not seen with either the C403S point mutant or the ΔN deletion mutant of RNF8. These results suggest a novel function of RNF8 as a regulator of RXRα-mediated transcriptional activity through interaction between their respective N-terminal regions.

Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids: Biology, Chemistry, and Medicine. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 443-520Google Scholar), mainly through two members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and retinoid X receptor (RXR) (2Chambon P. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 940-954Google Scholar, 3Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. Cell. 1995; 83: 859-869Google Scholar), which are ligand-dependent transcriptional regulators. Although all-trans-RA and 9-cis-RA (9cRA) both bind to the RAR, only 9cRA binds to and activates RXR (2Chambon P. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 940-954Google Scholar). Like other members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, RXR has a conserved structure made up of five domains, designated N terminus to C terminus as A to E. These domains have distinct functions and can act independently. The N-terminal region (domains A and B) contains an autonomously functioning region called activation function 1 (AF-1), which is involved in ligand-independent transcriptional transactivation and is not highly conserved between receptors. Domain C, which contains two zinc binding motifs (zinc finger-like), corresponds to the core of the DNA binding domain responsible for recognition of cognate response elements. Domain D (hinge region) is involved in ligand-induced functional changes and in the binding of receptors to co-repressors. Domain E, which is moderately conserved, is thought to be involved in ligand binding, contains ligand-dependent activation function 2 (AF-2), and provides a surface for dimerization (4Parrado A. Despouy G. Kraiba R. Le Pogam C. Dupas S. Choquette M. Robledo M. Larghero J. Bui H. Le Gall I. Rochette-Egly C. Chomienne C. Padua R.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4901-4908Google Scholar). Both the RAR and RXR have three subtypes, α, β, and γ, characterized by differences in the AF-1 domain (5Chiba H. Clifford J. Metzger D. Chambon P. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 735-747Google Scholar). They usually form an RAR/RXR heterodimer and exert transcription-regulating activity by binding to a specific DNA sequence known as the RAR-responsive element in the promoter regions of target genes (6Altucci L. Gronemeyer H. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2001; 1: 181-193Google Scholar). RXR also forms heterodimers with several other members of the nuclear receptor superfamily and transactivates or inhibits target gene promoters by binding to a specific DNA sequence known as the hormone-responsive element (7Aranda A. Pascual A. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1269-1304Google Scholar). RXR can also form homodimers, which transduce signals by binding to a specific DNA sequence, known as the RXR-responsive element (RXRE), in the promoter regions of target genes (7Aranda A. Pascual A. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1269-1304Google Scholar, 8Lehmann J.M. Jong L. Fanjul A. Cameron J.F. Lu X.P. Haefner P. Dawson M.I. Pfahl M. Science. 1992; 258: 1944-1946Google Scholar, 9De Luca L.M. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2924-2933Google Scholar). The transcriptional regulatory activity of these hetero- or homodimers is modulated by a variety of transcriptional co-activators and co-repressors, depending on the cell and tissue type involved (7Aranda A. Pascual A. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1269-1304Google Scholar). The ligand-dependent transcriptional activity is switched on by the binding of ligand to these retinoid receptors, which induces a conformational change, leading to either the dissociation of co-repressors from or the binding of co-activators to RAR/RXR or RXR/RXR dimers. The co-activators are components of multiprotein complexes with histone acetyltransferase activity that acetylate the N-terminal region of histones, leading to nucleosomal repulsion and chromatin decondensation, which is thought to be indispensable for transcriptional activation by the retinoid receptors (6Altucci L. Gronemeyer H. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2001; 1: 181-193Google Scholar). In contrast, little is known about ligand-independent transcriptional activation. The retinoid receptors play a pivotal role in preventing carcinogenic processes in various types of cancers (10Lotan R. Xu X.C. Lippman S.M. Ro J.Y. Lee J.S. Lee J.J. Hong W.K. N. Engl. J.

Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 11-19Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of RXRα reduces RXRα-dependent transactivation and is closely related to hepatocarcinogenesis (20Matsushima-Nishiwaki R. Okuno M. Adachi S. Sano T. Akita K. Moriwaki H. Friedman S.L. Kojima S. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 7675-7682Google Scholar), and restoration of RXRα activity, therefore, provides a key target for the prevention of liver cancer (21Matsushima-Nishiwaki R. Okuno M. Takano Y. Kojima S. Friedman S.L. Moriwaki H. Carcinogenesis. 2003; 24: 1353-1359Google Scholar). We screened for proteins that bind to RXRα and found a really interesting new gene (RING) finger protein, RING finger protein 8 (RNF8), recently isolated as a protein of unknown physiological function, which binds to the ubiquitin (Ub)-conjugating enzyme, E2 (UBE2E2) (22Ito K. Adachi S. Iwakami R. Yasuda H. Muto Y. Seki N. Okano Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2725-2732Google Scholar). RNF8 contains the fork-head-associated domain, a phosphopeptide binding motif, in its N-terminal region and a RING finger domain in the C-terminal region (we searched the Conserved Domain Data base for conserved domain RNF8 at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:80/Structure/cdd/cdd.shtml). RING finger proteins are involved in the ubiquitination of short-lived proteins (23Lorick K.L. Jensen J.P. Fang S. Ong A.M. Hatakeyama S. Weissman A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5880-5887Google Scholar). Although RNF8 binds to UBE2E2, which promotes Ub/proteasome-mediated degradation of RXRα (29Adachi S. Okuno M. Matsushima-Nishiwaki R. Takano Y. Kojima S. Friedman S.L. Moriwaki H. Okano Y. Hepatology. 2002; 35: 332-340Google Scholar), here we have found that RNF8 did not participate in Ub/proteasome-mediated degradation of RXRα but, rather, as an enhancer of transactivation activity via RXRα. Plasmid Construction—The wild-type (WT) human RXRα-expressing vector, pRS-RXRα, was kindly provided by Dr. R. M. Evans (Salk Institute, La Jolla, CA); the RXRα cDNA was amplified by PCR and inserted into the pAS2–1 vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) to generate pAS2-RXRα. The RXRα deletion mutants, indicated in Fig. 1A, were prepared by PCR using pAS2-RXRα as template and cloned into pAS2–1. The primer pairs used for ΔA/B (lacking the A and B domains) were 5′-AAAGAATTCGACATGACCAAGCACATCTGCGCCATC-3′ and 5′-AAACTCGAGAGTCATTTGGTGCGGCGCCTC-3′, and those for ΔE terminus (lacking the terminal region of E domain) were 5′-AAAGAATTCGCAGACATGGACACCAAACAT-3′ and 5′-AAACTCGAGCTCCCTCAGCGCCTCCACCTC-3′. The sense primer used for the A/B/C, A/B, and 1–28 mutants was 5′-AAAGAATTCGCCGGGCATGAGTTAGTCGCA-3′, whereas the antisense primers were, respectively, 5′-AAAGGATCCCTTCATGCCCATGGCCAGGCA-3′, 5′-AAAGGATCCGAAGGAAGCCATGTTTCCTGA-3′, and 5′-AAAGGATCCCATGGAGCCTCGCCCCGTCGG-3′. The ΔA/B/C mutant (lacking the A, B, and C domains) was prepared by deleting the fragment between the first and third NcoI sites (nucleotides 29–197) followed by self-ligation. N-terminal polyhistidine His6 Xpress-tagged WT RNF8 and its deletion mutants and C403S point mutant (Cys-403 mutated to Ser), presented in Fig. 1B, were constructed as described previously (22Ito K. Adachi S. Iwakami R. Yasuda H. Muto Y. Seki N. Okano Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2725-2732Google Scholar). The deletion and point mutations were confirmed by sequencing. Expression vectors encoding fusion proteins consisting of the maltose-binding protein (MBP) and WT RXRα or its ΔA/B mutant were constructed by subcloning cDNA encoding WT RXRα or the ΔA/B mutant, amplified by PCR using, respectively, pAS2-WT or ΔA/B RXRα as template, into the pMAL-p2X vector (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-RXRα was constructed by subcloning PCR-amplified RXRα cDNA with BglII sites attached at both ends into the BglII/BamH1 sites of the pEGFP-C1 vector (Clontech). Blue fluorescent protein (BFP)-RNF8 was generated by cloning the BglII-BglII fragment from pACT2-RNF8 into the BamHI-BamHI site of the pQBI50-fC1 vector (Qbiogene, Carlsbad, CA). The BFP-40-AA-EGFP plasmid encoding EGFP coupled to BFP by a 40-amino acid linker was prepared by ligation of EGFP cDNA into the BFP vector, placing the EGFP-coding sequence in the BFP-reading frame. Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—A yeast two-hybrid library was screened to isolate cDNAs encoding RXRα-binding proteins. A bait plasmid, constructed by subcloning the open reading frame of RXRα into the pAS2–1 vector as a GAL4 DNA binding domain fusion (pAS2-RXRα), as described above, was used to identify binding proteins from a human liver cDNA activation domain fusion library in the pACT2 vector. The yeast strain PJ69-2A was transformed with both plasmids. Positive clones were first selected on synthetic dropout (SD) medium in the absence of two nutrients (Leu and Trp). The colonies obtained were resuspended in water at equal densities, spotted onto SD medium in the absence of four nutrients (adenine, His, Leu, and Trp), and scored for differential growth after 3–5 days. The results were confirmed by a quantitative assay testing for β-galactosidase activity in the yeast strain Y-187. The two-hybrid system was also used to assess the binding of WT RNF8 to various RXRα deletion mutants (ΔA/B, ΔE terminus, A/B/C, A/B, 1–28, and ΔA/B/C) and of WT RXRα to various RNF8 deletion (1–440, 1–403, ΔN, and 403–485) or point (C403S) mutants. Quantitative β-Galactosidase Assay—β-Galactosidase activity in the yeast strain, Y-187, was determined by liquid culture as a quantitative assay. This assay was carried out using o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (Sigma) as the substrate. Briefly, 2 ml of overnight culture grown in liquid SD selection medium was used to inoculate 8 ml of yeast complete medium. After 3–5 h of growth (A600 = 0.5–0.8) in the absence or presence of 1 μm 9cRA, 1.5-ml aliquots of culture were placed in microcentrifuge tubes, and cells were collected by brief centrifugation. Each cell pellet was washed with 1.5 ml of Z buffer (60 mm Na2HPO4,40 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, pH 7) and resuspended in 150 μl of Z buffer. 100 μl of resuspended pellets was transferred in a new 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube. Cells were then frozen in liquid nitrogen and thawed at 37 °C in a water bath 3 times to break open the yeast cells. Then 0.7 ml of Z buffer containing 0.27% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol was added to the tube and mixed well followed by 160 μl of o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside in Z buffer (4 mg/ml, pH 7). The tube was incubated at 30 °C until a yellow color developed; 0.4 ml of Na2CO3 was then added to stop the reaction, and the reaction time was recorded. The tubes were centrifuged for 10 min, and the absorbance of the supernatant at 420 nm was measured. The β-galactosidase activity was calculated by the equation, β-galactosidase units (u) = 1000 × A420/(t × V × A600), where t is elapsed time (in min) of incubation, V is 0.1 ml × concentration factor (10 in this experiment), and A600 is absorbance at 600 nm of 1 ml of culture. In Vitro Binding Assay—The MBP-WT RXRα and MBP-ΔA/B RXRα fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified on amylose resin (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA). COS7 cells overexpressing His- and Xpress sequence-tagged WT RNF8 or its N-terminal deletion mutant (ΔN) were harvested and lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm ZnCl2). Purified MBP-RXRαs (500 ng) were added to the lysates, and the mixture was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C in the absence or presence of 1 μm 9cRA (Sigma), then amylose resin was added, and incubation was continued for 30 min at 4 °C. The resin was then washed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and boiled in SDS sample buffer, and the eluted proteins were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-Xpress antibody (Invitrogen), which recognizes the DLYDDDDK Xpress sequence adjacent to His6. Cell Culture and Transfection—COS7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium (DMEM) containing penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). The human colorectal carcinoma-derived cells, Caco-2 (Japanese Cancer Research Resources Bank, Tokyo, Japan), were maintained in DMEM/F-12 (Invitrogen) containing penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and 10% FCS. Transfections were performed using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, before transfection Caco-2 cells were cultured for 24 h in phenol red- and FCS-free medium supplemented with ITS Supplement (Invitrogen) to give final concentrations of 10 mg/liter insulin, 5.5 mg/l transferrin, and 6.7 μg/liter sodium selenite. The medium was changed to phenol red-free DMEM containing 10% charcoal-stripped FCS for 6 h, then the cells were transfected and harvested 48 h later. In some experiments, 9cRA (1 μm) or vehicle (ethanol, final concentration <0.05%) was added to the medium 24 h after transfection. Immunostaining—COS7 cells, plated on coverslips in 35-mm dishes, were transfected with plasmids encoding WT Myc-His-RXRα (1 μg/dish) and WT or mutant (C403S or ΔN) His-Xpress-RNF8 (2 μg/dish, respectively) as described above, then the cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, fixed for 10 min in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, washed twice in PBS, and permeabilized for 3 min with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS. After blocking with 0.1% BSA in PBS, the cover-slips were incubated for 2 h with mouse monoclonal anti-Xpress anti-body (Invitrogen) and rabbit polyclonal anti-myc antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), washed with PBS, and then incubated for 2 h with Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody and Alexa 546-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), respectively. All procedures were at room temperature. Images were acquired using an Olympus IX70 inverted microscope equipped with differential interference contrast (DIC) optics. Both the fluorescence and DIC images were captured as described previously (22Ito K. Adachi S. Iwakami R. Yasuda H. Muto Y. Seki N. Okano Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2725-2732Google Scholar) using a C5985 CCD camera with on-chip integration (Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan) and a Macintosh 8500 computer running C5985 imaging software. The fluorescence light source was a 75-W xenon arc lamp shuttered using a custom-made shutter unit so that cells were only illuminated during image acquisition. Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)—COS7 cells, grown on 35-mm glass-bottom culture dishes (Matsunami, Osaka, Japan), were transfected with plasmids encoding BFP, BFP-RNF8, EGFP-RXRα, BFP-EGFP tandem, or a combination of EGFP-RXRα and either BFP-RNF8 or BFP. To obtain images of living cells, the culture dishes were observed using an IX70 inverted microscope; the imaging system used was the same as that used for immunostaining experiments. The filter sets for discriminating between BFP and EGFP fluorescence were obtained from Omega Optical Inc. (Brattleboro, VT). For BFP detection, cells were viewed using a filter set with a 365/50 nm excitation filter, a 400-nm dichroic beam splitter, and a 450/65-nm emission filter (BFP channel). EGFP was detected using a filter set with a 475/40-nm excitation filter, a 505-nm dichroic beam splitter, and a 535/45-nm emission filter (EGFP channel). The filters used for FRET were a 365/50-nm excitation filter, a 400-nm dichroic beam splitter, and a 535/45-nm emission filter (FRET channel). The emission filters for the BFP channel and the FRET channel were switched using a filter changer (Lambda 10–2; Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA) coupled between the output port of the microscope and the C5985 CCD camera. To measure FRET, three images were acquired sequentially through the BFP, FRET, and EGFP channels. FRET quantification between the two fluorophores was performed using the normalized FRET value (NFRET), as described previously by Xia and Liu (30Xia Z. Liu Y. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 2395-2402Google Scholar). Because the amounts of BFP donor and EGFP acceptor vary from cell to cell in transient transfections and the intensity of energy transfer is related to the number of EGFP acceptor/BFP donor pairs, it was necessary to normalize the FRET to the expression levels of BFP and EGFP. The NFRET value was calculated on a pixel-by-pixel basis for the entire image using the equation, NFRET=IFRET-IEGFP×a-IBFP×bIEGFP×IBFP(Eq. 1) where IFRET, IEGFP, and IBFP correspond to background-subtracted images of cells co-expressing EGFP and BFP acquired through the FRET, EGFP, and BFP channels, respectively. Constants a and b represent the fraction of bleed-through of BFP and EGFP fluorescence, respectively, through the FRET channel and were determined using cells expressing either BFP-RNF8 or EGFP-RXRα. In our system ∼24% of the BFP signal and 2% of the EGFP signal was detected in the FRET channel. NFRET images are presented in pseudocolor mode, according to a temperature-based lookup table, with blue (cold) indicating low values and red (hot) indicating high values. For quantitative comparison, the NFRET for each pixel in nuclear areas was calculated, and the number of pixels with a given NFRET value was counted and plotted as a distribution histogram. All calculations were performed using the public domain program, Image J Version 1.29 (developed at NIH), with plug-ins for Calculator Plus and SixteenBit Histogram. In Vivo Ubiquitination Assays—Ubiquitination of proteins requires the covalent attachment of 8.6-kDa Ub to multiple lysine residues, forming poly-Ub chains bound to target proteins, and can be seen as a ladder of high molecular mass species on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (29Adachi S. Okuno M. Matsushima-Nishiwaki R. Takano Y. Kojima S. Friedman S.L. Moriwaki H. Okano Y. Hepatology. 2002; 35: 332-340Google Scholar). COS7 cells were transfected with various combinations of plasmids encoding RXRα (1 μg), HA-tagged Ub (kindly provided by Dr. D. Bohmann, European Molecular Biology Laboratory) (3 μg), or His-RNF8 (WT or C403S) (3 μg). MG132 (5 μm; Calbiochem), a potent proteasomal inhibitor, was added 24 h after transfection, and the cells were harvested 27–30 h after transfection. Cells were sonicated for 30 s in lysis buffer (100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, containing 6 m guanidine-HCl and 10 mm imidazole), then RXRα was immunoprecipitated using anti-RXRα antibodies (DN197; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and subjected to SDS-PAGE, and ubiquitinated RXRα was detected by Western blotting using anti-HA antibodies (12CA5; Roche Applied Science) as described previously (29Adachi S. Okuno M. Matsushima-Nishiwaki R. Takano Y. Kojima S. Friedman S.L. Moriwaki H. Okano Y. Hepatology. 2002; 35: 332-340Google Scholar). Luciferase Reporter Assays—A reporter plasmid, tk-CRBPII-Luc, which contains multiple copies of the DR1 type RXRE sequences within the rat cellular retinol-binding protein type II (CRBPII) promoter upstream of luciferase cDNA, was kindly provided by the late Dr. K. Umesono (Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan). COS7 cells, seeded in 12-well plates, were transfected with WT RXRα-expressing plasmid (100 ng/well), WT, or mutant (C403S or ΔN) RNF8-expressing plasmid (10 or 100 ng/well), and tk-CRBPII-Luc reporter (350 ng/well) was transfected with pRL-CMV-Luc (Renilla luciferase, 50 ng/well, Promega, Madison, WI) as an internal standard to normalize transfection efficiency. After exposure of the cells for 24 h to the transfection mixture, the medium was replaced with DMEM containing 10% charcoal-stripped FCS in the presence or absence of 1 μm 9cRA. Forty-eight hours after transfection cell lysates were prepared, and the luciferase activity of each cell lysate was measured using a LumiCount microplate luminometer (Packard Instrument Co.). Changes in firefly luciferase activity were calculated and plotted after normalization to changes in Renilla luciferase activity in the same sample. Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from Caco-2 cells using ISOGEN (WAKO Pure Chemical, Osaka, Japan) and isopropanol precipitation, then 1 μg was reverse-transcribed using a High Fidelity RNA PCR Kit (TAKARA Biomedicals, Tokyo, Japan) and an oligo(dT) primer according to the manufacturer's protocol. mRNAs for RNF8, RXRα, CRBPII, RARβ, and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH) were detected using the primer pairs derived from the human sequences shown in Table I. For RNF8, RXRα, RARβ, and G3PDH, the PCR conditions were 1 cycle of 94 °C for 5 min, 25 (for RARβ and G3PDH) or 30 (for RNF8 and RXRα) cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 56–60 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min, and 1 cycle of 72 °C for 10 min; for CRBPII, conditions were 1 cycle of 94 °C for 5 min, 22 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 56 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 30 s, and 1 cycle of 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR products were run on 2% agarose gels and visualized by ethidium bromide staining.Table ISequences of PCR primer pairs derived from human sequences U, upper primer; L, lower primer.NameSequenceNucleotide numbersProduct lengthbase pairsRNF8 (U)5′-AGCCTCAAACTCTTCAGCATCTCAG-3′705-729610RNF8 (L)5′-GGGGCATTCTATCTTCCGCTCATC-3′1290-1314RXRα (U)5′-CCTCAGGCAAGCACTATGGA-3′425-444528RXRα (L)5′-TGGAGCGGTGGGAGAAGGAG-3′933-952CRBPII (U)5′-GGAACCTGGGAGATGGAGAGT-3′19-39378CRBPII (L)5′-TTTGAACACTTGACGGCACAC-3′376-396RARβ (U)5′-CTGGATTTCTACACTGCGAG-3′46-65389RARβ (L)5′-CCCACTTCAAAGCACTTCTG-3′415-434G3PDH (U)5′-TGAAGGTCGGAGTCAACGGATTTGGT-3′11-36983G3PDH (L)5′-CATGTGGGCCATGAGGTCCACCAC-3′970-993 Open table in a new tab Discovery of RNF8 as an RXRα-binding Protein by Screening a Human Liver cDNA Library—Using the yeast two-hybrid screening system and a human liver library, we picked out a cDNA encoding an RXRα-binding protein and identified it as the RING finger protein, RNF8, by comparing the sequence with the data base in the DNA Data Bank of Japan. RNF8 was originally isolated as a partner of the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, UBE2E2 (22Ito K. Adachi S. Iwakami R. Yasuda H. Muto Y. Seki N. Okano Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2725-2732Google Scholar). By testing the binding of various mutants of both RNF8 and RXRα (shown in Fig. 1), we determined the interacting sites in these molecules in the presence or absence of 9cRA. Both β-galactosidase and growth assays demonstrated that all RXRα constructs containing residues 1–131, except for the ΔE terminus, bound well to RNF8, showing that this region, which includes the AF-1 region, was important for binding (Fig. 1A). A/B/C was more effective than ΔE terminus (compare columns 3 and 4). It was to be noted that of the constructs containing the AF-1 region, the ΔE terminus was the only one having the D domain, also called hinge region, and this domain was responsible for the folded structure of RXR. Accordingly, it was reasonable to consider that lack of the D domain led to exposure of RNF8 binding site (AF-1). Construct 1–28, containing only the N-terminal 28 amino acids, still showed some binding, but the greater binding seen with construct A/B (residues 1–131) (compare column 5 and 6) showed that important binding residues are also present in region 29–131. The greater binding seen with construct ΔA/B/C (compare columns 6 and 7), which in addition to residues"

In the present study, we characterized the effects of P2R stimulation on Na+-K+-2Cl- cotransporter (NKCC) activity in normal human nasal epithelial (NHNE) cells. [Ca2+]i and pHi were measured in primary cultures of NHNE cells using a double perfusion chamber, which enabled us to analyze membrane-specific transporter activities. NKCC activities were estimated by the pHi reduction due to Na+-dependent and bumetanide-sensitive intracellular uptake of NH+4. NKCC activities were observed in the basolateral membrane, but not in the luminal membrane, of NHNE cells. Interestingly, P2Rs were expressed in both membranes, and the stimulation of either luminal or basolateral P2R increased NKCC activity. Blockades of luminal Cl- channels, basolateral K+ channels, or protein kinase C did not affect the activation of NKCC by basolateral P2R stimulation. The effects of luminal P2R stimulation were partially reduced by Cl- channel blockers. However, chelation of intracellular Ca2+ by 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA) treatment completely blocked the stimulatory effects of luminal and basolateral P2Rs on NKCC.

The mucosal surfaces of the airway tract are covered with airway surface fluid (ASF), 1The abbreviations used are: ASF, airway surface fluid; CF, cystic fibrosis; CFTR, CF transmembrane conductance regulator; BAPTA, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N,N′-tetraacetic acid; BCECF, 2′,7′-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein; CACC, Ca2+-activated Cl- channel; KCC, K+-Cl- cotransporter; NKCC, Na+-K+-2Cl- cotransporter; NHNE, normal human nasal epithelial; P2R, purinergic receptor; ENaC, epithelial Na+ channel; NPPB, 5-nitro-2-(3′phenylpropyl-amino)benzoic acid; PKC, protein kinase C; PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; DIDS, 4,4′-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid disodium salt. 1The abbreviations used are: ASF, airway surface fluid; CF, cystic fibrosis; CFTR, CF transmembrane conductance regulator; BAPTA, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N,N′-tetraacetic acid; BCECF, 2′,7′-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein; CACC, Ca2+-activated Cl- channel; KCC, K+-Cl- cotransporter; NKCC, Na+-K+-2Cl- cotransporter; NHNE, normal human nasal epithelial; P2R, purinergic receptor; ENaC, epithelial Na+ channel; NPPB, 5-nitro-2-(3′phenylpropyl-amino)benzoic acid; PKC, protein kinase C; PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; DIDS, 4,4′-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid disodium salt. which performs critical roles in the proper functioning of airway tracts and in protecting the lining epithelia (1Quinton P.M.

The hypersecretion or the contraction of ASF is associated with a wide spectrum of respiratory tract diseases from allergic rhinitis to cystic fibrosis (CF). Chronic volume contraction, either by defects in secretion or by dysregulated hyper-absorption, induces the formation of hyper-viscous mucus, which is thought to be the underlying pathogenic mechanism of CF (1Quinton P.M. Cystic Fibrosis: Old Questions, New Answers, Paris, May 1994, The Second Joseph Levy Lecture. Cystic Fibrosis Trust, Bromley, Kent, UK1994: 26-32Google Scholar, 2Donaldson S.H. Boucher R.C. Curr. Opin. Pulm. Med. 2003; 9: 486-491Google Scholar). On the other hand, in stimulated conditions such as in allergic inflammation, airway epithelia actively secrete ion and fluids by locally induced neurotransmitters and inflammatory mediators (4Eccles R. Am. J. Rhinol. 2000; 14: 335-338Google Scholar). It is generally accepted that transepithelial Cl- transport is the major driving force for fluid secretions in airway epithelia (5Russell J.M. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 211-276Google Scholar, 6Matthews J.B. World J. Surg. 2002; 26: 826-830Google Scholar). During the past decades, extensive investigations have been performed on the molecular nature and the regulatory mechanisms accounting for this important biologic process. However, most of the studies have focused on the luminal Cl- exit pathways, especially on the transporter named cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), in which gene mutations cause CF and other related disorders (7Quinton P.M. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S3-S22Google Scholar, 8Lee J.H. Choi J.H. Namkung W. Hanrahan J.W. Chang J. Song S.Y. Park S.W. Kim D.S. Yoon J.H. Suh Y. Jang I.J. Nam J.H. Kim S.J. Cho M.O. Lee J.E. Kim K.H. Lee M.G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 2321-2332Google Scholar). Equally important are the basolateral Cl- uptake pathways. In fact, recent evidence suggests that the activities of basolateral Na+-K+-2Cl- cotransporter (NKCC) are the rate-limiting step of ion and fluid secretions in Cl--secreting epithelia (6Matthews J.B. World J. Surg. 2002; 26: 826-830Google Scholar, 9Flagella M. Clarke L.L. Miller M.L. Erway L.C. Giannella R.A. Andringa A. Gawenis L.R. Kramer J. Duffy J.J. Doetschman T. Lorenz J.N. Yamoah E.N. Cardell E.L. Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26946-26955Google Scholar). In addition to NKCC, several other mechanisms can mediate intracellular Cl- uptake: 1) the parallel activation of Na+/H+ and Cl−/HCO−3 exchangers; 2) other members of cation-chloride cotransporters such as K+-Cl- cotransporter (KCC) and Na+-Cl- cotransporter (NCC); and 3) a Cl--ATPase pump. However, these transporters are expressed in specific tissues or are active in specific conditions, whereas NKCC is known to be ubiquitously expressed and responsible for most of the intracellular Cl- uptake in secretory epithelia (5Russell J.M. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 211-276Google Scholar). To date, two isoforms of NKCC have been identified, NKCC1 and NKCC2. Both belong to the cation-chloride cotransporter family, which has 12 membrane-spanning domains (5Russell J.M. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 211-276Google Scholar, 10Gerelsaikhan T. Turner R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40471-40477Google Scholar). Among them, NKCC1 is in general expressed in the basolateral membrane of Cl--secreting epithelia (5Russell J.M. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 211-276Google Scholar, 6Matthews J.B. World J. Surg. 2002; 26: 826-830Google Scholar). As in other CFTR- and NKCC1-expressing epithelial tissues, cells in the airway tract are under control of several agonists, which include agonists in the cholinergic and adrenergic systems. Recently, the purinergic system, a different type of regulating system, has attracted increasing attention in the regulation of transepithelial transport due to its unique properties (3Schwiebert E.M. Zsembery A. Biochim. Biophys Acta. 2003; 1615: 7-32Google Scholar). For example, purinergic receptors (P2Rs) are expressed in the luminal membrane as well as in the basolateral membrane of many epithelial cells (11Paradiso A.M. Mason S.J. Lazarowski E.R. Boucher R.C. Nature. 1995; 377: 643-646Google Scholar, 12Lee M.G. Zeng W. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32951-32955Google Scholar). In addition, accumulating evidence suggests that activation of P2Rs is not only involved in the regulation of physiologic function but also associated with pathologic conditions (3Schwiebert E.M. Zsembery A. Biochim. Biophys Acta. 2003; 1615: 7-32Google Scholar). Therefore, a dissection of the effects of P2R on the basolateral Cl- uptake pathways would improve our understanding of physiological and pathological regulation of airway secretions. We employed primary cultures of normal human nasal epithelial (NHNE) cells as a model of human airway epithelia. Alterations in nasal secretion are frequently associated with common medical problems such as allergic rhinitis or the common cold (4Eccles R. Am. J. Rhinol. 2000; 14: 335-338Google Scholar). In addition, cells in the nasal mucosa share some common features with cells in other airway epithelia in both the morphological and molecular aspects. For example, nasal epithelia have cilia on the luminal surface and co-express CFTR and epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) on the luminal membrane, similar to cells in the middle or lower airway tract (13Jun E.S. Kim Y.S. Yoo M.A. Roh H.J. Jung J.S. Life Sci. 2001; 68: 827-840Google Scholar). Therefore, an investigation of the nasal secretory mechanism itself has significant clinical meanings, and further, the results may be extrapolated to the secretory mechanisms of cells in the middle and lower airway tracts. In the present study, we analyzed the effects of P2R activation on NKCC in human nasal epithelia. NKCC activities were observed only in the basolateral membrane of NHNE cells, and immunoblotting using specific antibodies revealed the expression of NKCC1. Interestingly, P2Rs were expressed in both luminal and basolateral membranes, and the stimulation of either luminal or basolateral P2R increased the basolateral NKCC activity. Finally, the stimulatory effects of P2R on NKCC were completely dependent on intracellular Ca2+ signals. These findings will provide the basis for understanding the purinergic control of secretions in human nasal and airway epithelia under physiologic and pathologic conditions. Chemicals and Solutions—The fluorescent probes, Fura-2-AM and 2′,7′-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5 (6)-carboxyfluorescein acetoxymethyl ester (BCECF-AM), and the intracellular Ca2+ chelator 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid acetoxymethyl ester (BAPTAAM) were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). The Cl- channel blocker 5-nitro-2-(3′phenylpropyl-amino)benzoic acid (NPPB) was obtained from Alexis (Carlsbad, CA), and 4,4′-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid disodium salt (DIDS) was from Calbiochem. Ammonium gluconate was purchased from Pfaltz & Bauer (Waterbury, CT). All other chemicals including ATP, ouabain, bumetanide, BaCl2, Go6976, and rottlerin were purchased from Sigma. The standard HEPES-buffered perfusate was termed solution A and contained (in mm) 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 10 d-glucose, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.4 with NaOH). The Na+-free solution B was prepared by replacing Na+ with N-methyl-d-glucamine+ in solution A (pH 7.4 with Tris). The Cl--free solution C contained (in mm) 140 Na+-gluconate, 5 K+-gluconate, 1 MgSO4, 9.3 hemicalcium cyclamate, 10 d-glucose, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.4 with NaOH). In the measurements of NH+4 uptake, 20 mm Na+ or N-methyl-d-glucamine+ was replaced with equimolar NH+4 using NH4Cl or NH+4-gluconate in each solution. The osmolarity of all solutions was adjusted to 310 mosm with the major salt prior to use. Culture of NHNE Cells—Primary cultures of NHNE cells were prepared as described previously (14Yoon J.H. Kim K.S. Kim S.S. Lee J.G. Park I.Y. Ann. Otol. Rhinol. Laryngol. 2000; 109: 594-601Google Scholar, 15Song K.S. Seong J.K. Chung K.C. Lee W.J. Kim C.H. Cho K.N. Kang C.D. Koo J.S. Yoon J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34890-34896Google Scholar). All procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Board of Yonsei Medical Center. Passage-2 NHNE cells were plated on a collagen-coated semipermeable membrane with a 0.45-μm pore size (Transwell-clear; Costar Co., Cambridge, MA) at a density of 1.0 × 104 cells/cm2 for intracellular pH (pHi) and [Ca2+]i measurements. The cells were maintained in 1:1 mixture of bronchial epithelial growth medium and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and all supplements (14Yoon J.H. Kim K.S. Kim S.S. Lee J.G. Park I.Y. Ann. Otol. Rhinol. Laryngol. 2000; 109: 594-601Google Scholar). Membranes bearing cultured cells (culture area, 0.3 cm2) were floated on the culture medium in Petri dishes and incubated for 4–5 days until the cells formed a functionally polarized monolayer. Measurement of [Ca2+]i—[Ca2+]i levels in the monolayers were determined using protocols reported previously with slight modification (16Namkung W. Lee J.A. Ahn W. Han W. Kwon S.W. Ahn D.S. Kim K.H. Lee M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 200-207Google Scholar). Briefly, after achieving confluency, the cells were loaded with Fura-2 by incubating in a medium containing 3 μm Fura-2-AM and 1.6 μm pluronic F127 (for 30 min at 37 °C). A membrane bearing Fura-2-loaded cells was mounted in a miniature Ussing chamber (AKI Institute, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark) attached to the stage of an inverted microscope. The membrane was located between the two half-chambers, which separated the chamber into a luminal (upper) and a basolateral (lower) compartment. A transparent coverslip was placed at the bottom of the perfusion chamber, which allowed fluorescence measurements from the dye-loaded monolayers using objective lenses having a long working distance (more than 2 mm). Separate luminal and basolateral perfusates were delivered to the chamber after warming (37 °C). Fura-2 fluorescence was recorded (Delta Ram; PTI Inc., South Brunswick, NJ) at excitation wavelengths of 350 and 380 nm, and the 350/380 fluorescence ratio was calibrated by exposing the cells to solutions containing high and low concentrations of Ca2+ and 10 μm ionomycin. Measurements of Intracellular pH (pHi) and NKCC Activity—pHi was measured in the monolayers using the pH-sensitive fluorescent probe BCECF. Cells were loaded with BCECF for 10 min at room temperature in solution A containing 2.5 μm BCECF-AM and mounted in the miniature Ussing chamber described for [Ca2+]i measurements. BCECF fluorescence was recorded and calibrated using a previously described protocol (16Namkung W. Lee J.A. Ahn W. Han W. Kwon S.W. Ahn D.S. Kim K.H. Lee M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 200-207Google Scholar). Briefly, the fluorescence at excitation wave-lengths of 490 and 440 nm was recorded using a recording setup (Delta Ram; PTI Inc.), and the 490/440 ratios were calibrated intracellularly by perfusing the cells with solutions containing 145 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, and 5 μm nigericin with the pH adjusted to 6.2–7.6. Na+-K+-2Cl- cotransporter activity was estimated from the pHi decrease caused by the intracellular uptake of NH+4 using the methods of Evans and Turner (17Evans R.L Turner R.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 499: 351-359Google Scholar) with modification. As shown in Fig. 1, when challenged with 20 mm NH4Cl solutions, cells were rapidly alkalinized (0–2 s) due to the intracellular diffusion of NH3. Then, if the cells have NH+4-transporting machineries, the pHi of the cells would be decreased due to the intracellular uptake of NH+4. As detailed under “Results,” most of the intracellular NH+4 uptake measured in ouabain (100 μm)- and Na+ (140 mm)-containing perfusates was a function of NKCC in NHNE cells. Typically, the first 10–40 s of the initial linear portion of the pHi decreases due to Na+-dependent and ouabain-insensitive intracellular NH+4 uptake (shorter times were used for more rapid decreases) was fitted to a linear equation using the Felix software (version 1.4; PTI Inc.). Buffer capacity of NHNE cells was calculated by measuring ΔpHi in response to 5–40 mm NH4Cl pulses in Na+-free solutions (18Muallem S. Loessberg P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12813-12819Google Scholar), which applied to both luminal and basolateral sides simultaneously. In each experiment, the intrinsic buffer capacity (βi) showed a negative linear relationship with pHi between 6.4 and 7.6. The βi of NHNE cells at resting state (23.1 ± 1.8 mm/pH unit at pHi 7.2) was not significantly different from that of ATP-stimulated cells (25.8 ± 2.7 mm/pH unit). Therefore, the results of NKCC activity were expressed as ΔpH unit/min, and this value was directly analyzed without compensating for βi. Immunobolotting—NHNE cells were grown to confluence in 6-well plates. The cells were lysed with 2× sample buffer (250 mm Tris-Cl (pH 6.5), 2% SDS, 0.1 mol/liter dithiothreitol, 0.02% bromphenol blue, 10% glycerol). Equal amounts of whole cell lysates were resolved by 6% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) for 2 h at room temperature. This membrane was then incubated overnight with T4 monoclonal antibody (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, Iowa City, IA) in TTBS (0.5% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline). After washing with TTBS, the blot was further incubated for 45 min at room temperature with appropriate secondary antibody (Cell Signaling) in TTBS and then visualized using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). Statistical Analysis—The results of multiple experiments are presented as means ± S.E. Statistical analysis was carried out by analysis of variance or Student's t test as appropriate. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. NH+4 Transport in NHNE Cells—Na+-K+-2Cl- cotransporter activities were measured using NH+4 as a K+ surrogate. As an initial step, NH+4 transport in the luminal and basolateral membrane of polarized NHNE cells was measured. The basal pHi of NHNE cells was 7.15 ± 0.04 in Hepes-buffered solution A, and the application of 20 mm NH4Cl to the luminal side evoked an abrupt increase in pHi followed by a sustained pHi increase (Fig. 1A). These results indicate that only NH3 can pass through the luminal membrane of NHNE cells (Fig. 1C). At pH 7.4 and 37 °C, 20 mm NH4Cl solution contains about 0.6 mm NH3 (pKa = 8.9). The charged NH+4 ion cannot pass through the lipid bilayer of plasma membrane, whereas nonpolar NH3 can freely diffuse into the cells. When it enters the cells, NH rapidly converts into NH+4 by picking up H+ until equilibrium is reached. Therefore, pHi increases due to a reduced H+ concentration. However, if the cell membrane expresses an NH+4-transporting protein, NH+4 enters the cells and pHi decreases since NH+4 donates H+ to achieve equilibrium with NH3 (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, applications of 20 mm NH4Cl to the basolateral side induced a small pHi increase followed by rapid pHi decrease, which suggests that the basolateral membranes of NHNE cells have strong NH+4-transporting activities (Fig. 1B). The average value of the initial pHi reduction caused by basolateral challenge with 20 mm NH4Cl was 0.331 ± 0.021 ΔpH unit/min. Characterization of the Basolateral NH+4-transporting Mechanisms—To date, several transporters are known to transport NH+4, in particular via K+ binding sites (19Bergeron M.J. Gagnon E. Wallendorff B. Lapointe J.Y. Isenring P. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: F68-F78Google Scholar). Therefore, we characterized the basolateral NH+4-transporting activities of NHNE cells. As shown in Fig. 2, we first analyzed the Na+ and Cl- dependence of the NH+4-transporting mechanisms. Incubation of NHNE cells in Na+-free solutions for 5 min reduced the basal pHi to 6.78 ± 0.07. Of interest, the basolateral application of NH4Cl in Na+-free solutions induced a rapid and sustained pHi increase similar to that observed in the luminal application of NH4Cl in Na+-containing solutions (Figs. 1A and 2A). Therefore, it was concluded that most of the basolateral NH+4-transporting activities are dependent on Na+, which suggests that Na+-independent transporters, such as KCC, do not contribute to the NH+4-transporting activity. In addition, 83% of the basolateral NH+4 transport was also found to be dependent on Cl- (Fig. 2, B and C). Basolateral NH+4 transport was further analyzed using inhibitors of Na+- and K+-coupled transporters. As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, the Na+,K+ ATPase inhibitor ouabain (100 μm) inhibited NH+4 transport by 28%, and the addition of the NKCC inhibitor bumetanide (100 μm) inhibited it by 94%. These results and the data concerning Na+ and Cl- dependence indicate that NKCC mediates most of the basolateral NH+4 transport in NHNE cells, particularly when treated with ouabain. Subsequently, the expression of NKCC1 in NHNE cells was verified by immunoblotting. Protein extracts of NHNE cells originating from two different individuals showed a band at around 170 kDa when blotted with T4 anti-NKCC1 monoclonal antibody, which corresponds to the size of typical glycosylated human NKCC1 (Fig. 3C). In addition, reverse transcriptase-PCR experiments using specific primers of human NKCC1 and NKCC2 revealed that NHNE cells contain only NKCC1 mRNA (not shown). Activation of NKCC1 by Purinergic Stimulation—Accumulating evidence suggests that P2 receptors participate in the regulation of transepithelial ion transport in various epithelia (3Schwiebert E.M. Zsembery A. Biochim. Biophys Acta. 2003; 1615: 7-32Google Scholar). To investigate the effects of P2R on NKCC, we first measured [Ca2+]i in response to the membrane-specific applications of P2R agonists. As shown in Fig. 4A, both luminal and basolateral applications of ATP evoked [Ca2+]i signals in NHNE cells. Interestingly, P2Rs in the luminal membrane (ED50 for ATP, 4.3 μm) showed ∼5 times higher agonist sensitivity than those of the basolateral membrane (ED50 for ATP, 23.7 μm). We next evaluated the effects of P2R stimulation on basolateral NKCC activity using the protocols described above. A summary of the results is presented in Fig. 4B, and representative traces of basolateral ATP and luminal ATP stimulations are shown in Fig. 4, C and D, respectively. Importantly, the stimulation of P2Rs either in the basolateral membrane or in the luminal membrane increased the NKCC activity in NHNE cells. Control basolateral NH+4-transporting activity under ouabain treatment was 0.223 ± 0.017 ΔpH unit/min, and this value was increased to 0.496 ± 0.075 and 0.569 ± 0.102 by basolateral and luminal ATP applications, respectively. Effects of Ion Channel Blockers and PKC Inhibitors—Although we observed that stimulation of either luminal or basolateral P2R activated NKCC, we first analyzed the stimulatory mechanisms of basolateral P2R, which resides in the same membrane as NKCC. Previous studies have reported that various agonists can secondarily regulate NKCC activity by primarily modulating intracellular ionic compositions (5Russell J.M. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 211-276Google Scholar). In particular, lowering [Cl-]i by the activation of luminal Cl- channels and the counter activation of basolateral K+ channels has been suggested to be an important regulatory mechanism of NKCC (5Russell J.M. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 211-276Google Scholar, 20Haas M. McBrayer D.G. Yankaskas J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C189-C200Google Scholar, 21O'Neill W.C. Steinberg D.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C267-C274Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether the stimulatory effects of basolateral P2R can be inhibited by blockers of Cl- or K+ channels. To block luminal Cl- channels, a mixture of the Ca2+-activated Cl- channel (CACC) inhibitor DIDS (100 μm) and of the CFTR inhibitor NPPB (30 μm) was applied to the luminal perfusates (Fig. 5C). As for the basolateral K+ channels, a non-specific K+ channel inhibitor Ba2+ (5 mm) was included in the basolateral perfusates (Fig. 5D). As shown in Fig. 5B, neither blockade of the Cl- channel nor of the K+ channel affected the stimulatory effects of ATP on NKCC. In addition, the blockade of ENaC, which may affect NKCC activity by modulating the membrane potential or [Na+]i by adding 100 μm amiloride to the luminal perfusates, did not alter NKCC activity (not shown). Therefore, it was concluded that the increased NKCC activity in response to stimulation of basolateral P2R was due to the intrinsic activation of NKCC. Recently, it was suggested that the α-adrenergic agonist methoxamine stimulates NKCC by activating protein kinase C (PKC), in particular, by activating a novel type PKC-δ isoform in Calu-3 cells originating from human lung adenocarcinoma (22Liedtke C.M. Papay R. Cole T.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: L1151-L1159Google Scholar). The stimulation of P2R, especially the stimulation of G-protein-coupled P2Y receptors, can activate PKC. Therefore, we tested whether the stimulatory effects of P2R on NKCC are dependent on PKC activity in NHNE cells using two types of PKC inhibitors. Cells were pretreated for 30 min with either Go6976 (500 nm), an inhibitor of classic PKC isoforms, or rottlerin (10 μm), an inhibitor of novel PKC isoforms. NKCC activity was then measured using the luminal and basolateral perfusates containing the same inhibitor concentrations. Unlike the findings observed in Calu-3 cells after methoxamine stimulation (22Liedtke C.M. Papay R. Cole T.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: L1151-L1159Google Scholar), the effects of P2R stimulation in NHNE cells were not inhibited either by Go6976 or by rottlerin. Basolateral ATP-stimulated NKCC activity after Go6976 treatment was 0.462 ± 0.059 ΔpH unit/min (n = 5), and after rottlerin treatment, it was 0.443 ± 0.055 (n = 5). These values were not significantly different from the value of basolateral ATP stimulation presented in Fig. 4B (0.496 ± 0.075, see above). The Effects of Basolateral P2R Are Dependent on [Ca2+]i—As shown in Fig. 4A, either luminal or basolateral ATP evoked a rapid increase in [Ca2+]i. Therefore, we investigated the role of calcium signals in NKCC activation. First, we measured the effects of [Ca2+]i increase on NKCC activity using the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin. As shown in Fig. 6, A and C, ionomycin treatment (5 μm) acutely increased the basolateral NKCC activity by 98%. Next, we investigated whether the calcium signals are required for the P2R-induced activation of NKCC. Surprisingly, the chelation of intracellular Ca2+ by BAPTA-AM treatment (50 μm for 30 min) almost completely blocked the activation of NKCC by basolateral P2R stimulation (Fig. 6, B and C). As depicted in Fig. 7A, stimulation of P2R caused a shortlived [Ca2+]i peak followed by a small sustained [Ca2+]i increase in NHNE cells. Of interest, treatment with basolateral ATP 3 min before the application of NH4Cl did not increase NKCC activity (Fig. 7, B and C). These results suggest that the P2R-induced stimulation of NKCC activity is highly correlated with [Ca2+]i. Characterization of the Effects of Luminal P2R on NKCC— The stimulatory effects of luminal P2R on NKCC were analyzed using protocols similar to those used for the investigation of basolateral P2R. As was observed with basolateral ATP, inhibition of ENaC and PKC did not significantly alter the effects of luminal ATP on NKCC (not shown). However, unlike that observed with basolateral ATP, the blockade of luminal Cl- channels partially reduced the stimulatory effects of luminal ATP on NKCC (Fig. 8, A and B). The luminal ATP-stimulated NKCC activity was 0.532 ± 0.040 ΔpH unit/min, and this value was decreased to 0.401 ± 0.029 by luminal DIDS and NPPB. Finally, the effects of luminal ATP were measured in the BAPTA-pretreated cells. As illustrated in Fig. 8, C and D, the stimulatory effects of luminal ATP on NKCC were completely blocked by the chelation of intracellular calcium, as was observed in experiments with basolateral ATP. Secretion of appropriate fluids is critical in the mucociliary clearance system, which protects the respiratory system from noxious substances. An interesting feature is that airway surface epithelium is capable of releasing ATP and UTP to the luminal space in response to a myriad of physiologic and pathologic stimuli. Moreover, neuroendocrine cells and mast cells along the airway also release ATP to the interstitial space, hence to the basolateral side of surface epithelium, with other agonists from their granules (3Schwiebert E.M. Zsembery A. Biochim. Biophys Acta. 2003; 1615: 7-32Google Scholar, 23Lazarowski E.R. Boucher R.C. Harden T.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 785-795Google Scholar). Therefore, purinergic signaling is thought to serve as an important regulatory mechanism of epithelial homeostasis and to be involved in a number of pathologic conditions. The present study provides sufficient and necessary evidence that purinergic agonists directly activate basolateral NKCC via calcium signaling in human nasal epithelia. Increased [Ca2+]i by ionomycin treatment sufficiently activated the basolateral NKCC in NHNE cells (Fig. 6A). In addition, the finding that [Ca2+]i chelation by BAPTA treatment completely inhibited the P2R-induced effects (Figs. 6B and 8C) demonstrated that calcium signals are required for the P2R-induced activation of NKCC. Previously, it has been shown that an increase in [Ca2+]i can modulate NKCC activity in several tissues including airway epithelia (5Russell J.M. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 211-276Google Scholar). However, most of the studies have suggested that calcium signals do not directly modulate NKCC but rather affect NKCC activity by secondarily modulating K+ or Cl- conductances (5Russell J.M. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 211-276Google Scholar, 20Haas M. McBrayer D.G. Yankaskas J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C189-C200Google Scholar, 21O'Neill W.C. Steinberg D.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C267-C274Google Scholar). On the other hand, the present findings that inhibitors of Cl- or K+ channels did not affect the stimulatory effects of basolateral ATP on NKCC (Fig. 5) and only partially inhibited those of luminal ATP (Fig. 8) strongly suggest that purinergic stimulation induced an intrinsic increase in NKCC activity. One of the basic differences between the present study and previous studies is the method used for determining NKCC activity. We employed a technique that has a high temporal resolution by measuring the real-time changes in pHi due to NKCC-mediated intracellular NH+4 uptake. Previous studies that have reported only the secondary effects of [Ca2+]i used either [3H]bumetanide binding or 86Rb fluxes to determine NKCC activity and measured averaged NKCC activities after long term incubations with agonists (20Haas M. McBrayer D.G. Yankaskas J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C189-C200Google Scholar, 21O'Neill W.C. Steinberg D.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C267-C274Google Scholar). For example, Haas et al. (20Haas M. McBrayer D.G. Yankaskas J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C189-C200Google Scholar) reported that treatment with luminal ATP for 40 min increased [3H]bumetanide binding by about 80% in canine tracheal epithelia and this increase was almost completely blocked by the Cl- channel blocker IAA-94. As shown in the present study, P2R stimulation evoked a short-lasting Ca2+ peak even in the continuous presence of ATP (Fig. 7). In native tissues, released ATP and UTP are rapidly washed away by the bulk of luminal or interstitial fluids and are instantaneously degraded by ecto-enzymes (3Schwiebert E.M. Zsembery A. Biochim. Biophys Acta. 2003; 1615: 7-32Google Scholar, 23Lazarowski E.R. Boucher R.C. Harden T.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 785-795Google Scholar). Therefore, repetitive short-lasting P2R stimuli rather than a continuous stimulation would be closer to actual physiological situations. In this regard, our present finding that a short-lasting Ca2+ peak induced by P2R acutely increases the intrinsic activity of NKCC may have important physiological implications. A previous study on cholinergic regulation of NKCC in parotid acinar cells reported results that concur with ours (Evans and Turner (17Evans R.L Turner R.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 499: 351-359Google Scholar)). These authors also determined NKCC activity by measuring pHi decreases due to NKCC-mediated NH+4 uptake and found the acute up-regulation of intrinsic NKCC activity by the cholinergic agonist carbachol, which was completely inhibited by BAPTA but not by intracellular KCl loss or cell shrinkage. Recently, Brindikova et al. (24Brindikova T.A. Bourcier N. Torres B. Pchejetski D. Gekle M. Maximov G.V. Montminy V. Insel P.A. Orlov S.N. Isenring P. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: C1445-C1453Google Scholar) reported that long term (30 min) purinergic stimulation inhibits NKCC-mediated 86Rb fluxes in C11-MDCK cells but not in C7-MDCK cells. However, short term (2 min) purinergic stimulation acutely increased the NKCC activities in both MDCK cell lines, and this was completely inhibited by BAPTA treatment (24Brindikova T.A. Bourcier N. Torres B. Pchejetski D. Gekle M. Maximov G.V. Montminy V. Insel P.A. Orlov S.N. Isenring P. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: C1445-C1453Google Scholar). Together with the present findings, the above results suggest that the acute activation of NKCC by transient increases in [Ca2+]i does not seem to be a phenomenon specific to NHNE cells and that it may be a ubiquitous feature in epithelial tissues. It is widely accepted that phosphorylation of NKCC1 is related to the increased activity of NKCC1 (25Tanimura A. Kurihara K. Reshkin S.J. Turner R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25252-25258Google Scholar, 26Haas M. Forbush 3rd, B. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 515-534Google Scholar). Activities of various kinases such as PKA, PKC, and of an unidentified kinase responding to [Cl-]i were suggested to be associated with NKCC1 phosphorylation and activation (5Russell J.M. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 211-276Google Scholar, 26Haas M. Forbush 3rd, B. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 515-534Google Scholar). In fact, it was once reported that the activity of a novel PKC-δ isoform was required for the methoxamine-induced activation of NKCC1 in Calu-3 cells (22Liedtke C.M. Papay R. Cole T.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: L1151-L1159Google Scholar). However, the present results obtained using PKC inhibitors suggested that the classical and novel isoforms of PKC are not involved in the P2R-induced acute activation of NKCC in NHNE cells. The molecular mechanisms underlying P2R- and Ca2+-induced activation of NKCC1 require further study. Previously, we showed that P2R signals evoke the membrane-specific activation of ion transporters in polarized epithelial tissues (27Zeng W. Lee M.G. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32956-32965Google Scholar, 28Lee M.G. Schultheis P.J. Yan M. Shull G.E. Bookstein C. Chang E. Tse M. Donowitz M. Park K. Muallem S. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 513: 341-357Google Scholar). In the present study, the stimulatory effects of luminal ATP on NKCC were partially inhibited by the blockade of luminal Cl- channels (Fig. 8), whereas the stimulatory effects of basolateral ATP were not (Fig. 5). Since the effects of luminal ATP were completely inhibited by chelation of intracellular Ca2+, Cl- channels responding to [Ca2+]i such as CACC are responsible, at least in part, for the luminal ATP-induced activation of NKCC. The finding that luminal Cl- channels are activated only by luminal ATP but not by basolateral ATP supports the idea of compartmentalized calcium signals in epithelial cells, as suggested by ourselves and by other researchers (11Paradiso A.M. Mason S.J. Lazarowski E.R. Boucher R.C. Nature. 1995; 377: 643-646Google Scholar, 27Zeng W. Lee M.G. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32956-32965Google Scholar, 28Lee M.G. Schultheis P.J. Yan M. Shull G.E. Bookstein C. Chang E. Tse M. Donowitz M. Park K. Muallem S. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 513: 341-357Google Scholar, 29Huang P. Lazarowski E.R. Tarran R. Milgram S.L. Boucher R.C. Stutts M.J. Proc..Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14120-14125Google Scholar). In conclusion, we observed that P2R stimulation acutely activated NKCC in NHNE cells. The apical surfaces of the airway tract are moistened by ASF that derives from the transcellular transport of anions, especially Cl- ions. Since the activity of basolateral NKCC, which maintains [Cl-]i at the levels above the predicted equilibrium potential, is actually the ratelimiting step in epithelial fluid secretion, the results described here add significantly to our understanding of airway secretions in physiologic and pathologic conditions. For example, NKCC activation due to ATP release by activated mast cells may contribute to increased nasal secretions in allergic rhinitis. We thank WonSun Han for editorial assistance."

Hansson M. Al-Karadaghi S. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 221-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) indicate that porphyrin binds to a deep cleft between the two domains. This cleft is enriched with many conserved residues important for catalysis (10Al-Karadaghi S. Hansson M. Nikonov S. Jonsson B. Hederstedt L.

One side of the active site cleft is formed by the first two N-terminal α-helices, α1 and α2, and a loop between them, and the other side consists of a short loop sequence, which connects a β-strand and an α-helix in the second domain (10Al-Karadaghi S.

Biol. 2001; 8: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Although the overall sequence identity is ∼20%, this loop motif is conserved among all ferrochelatases (Fig. 1). The importance of the loop motif in porphyrin interaction was first observed in the molecular mechanics calculations of nickel-protoporphyrin docking into the B. subtilis ferrochelatase active site (14Franco R. Ma J.G. Lu Y. Ferreira G.C. Shelnutt J.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2517-2529Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In the crystal structures of human and B. subtilis ferrochelatases, the conserved loop residues appear to contact the pyrrole rings to stabilize porphyrin binding and orientation through ionic, aromatic stacking, and/or steric interactions, and they may also play a role in restricting the size of the binding cleft (10Al-Karadaghi S.

Biol. 2001; 8: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Structural analysis of human ferrochelatase led to the proposal that the loop region is positioned in close proximity to the membrane-associating side of the enzyme, and the conserved hydrophobic residues defining the active site cavity may form a pathway to allow access for the porphyrin substrate and the release of heme (12Wu C.K. Dailey H.A. Rose J.P. Burden A. Sellers V.M. Wang B.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the loop was implicated to act as a mobile element to allow conformational changes in the active site pocket in response to substrate binding (10Al-Karadaghi S. Hansson M. Nikonov S. Jonsson B. Hederstedt L. Structure. 1997; 5: 1501-1510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In order to examine the role of the conserved loop motif in ferrochelatase function, we used random mutagenesis and genetic complementation to identify functional substitutions and to evaluate the information content of each of the 10 consecutive loop residues in murine ferrochelatase. We found that the ferrochelatase loop motif possesses a considerable degree of plasticity, tolerating multiple substitutions within the motif, albeit the overall spatial arrangement of the loop was maintained in functional variants. Kinetic characterization of selected, active variants further substantiated the importance of the loop in ferrochelatase function. Materials—Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Cybersyn.

Plasmids and Bacteria—Plasmid pGF47 contains the N-terminal His-tagged, mature form of wild-type murine ferrochelatase (14Franco R. Ma J.G. Lu Y. Ferreira G.C. Shelnutt J.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2517-2529Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Overexpression of ferrochelatase was performed as previously described (15Ferreira G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4396-4400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid pGF23 contains the murine, erythroid 5-aminolevulinate synthase cDNA cloned into the pCASS3 vector (16Ferreira G.C. Dailey H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 584-590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Escherichia coli strain Δvis was a kind gift of Dr. H. Inokuchi at Kyoto University (17Nakahigashi K. Nishimura K. Miyamoto K. Inokuchi H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1991; 88: 10520-10524Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Construction of a Dummy Vector—Plasmid pZS1 was generated by replacing the segment in the murine ferrochelatase expression plasmid (pGF47) spanning the 10 codons for the loop motif with a stuffer sequence derived from pGF23 via two unique restriction sites, BstEII and PspOMI. Construction of the Ferrochelatase Random Library—The ferrochelatase random library was constructed based on previously described protocols (18Munir K.M. French D.C. Dube D.K. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6584-6589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Gong J. Ferreira G.C. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1678-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 20Landis D.M. Loeb L.A. J.

Two single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides with 15 complementary base pairs at their 3′-ends were annealed. Oligonucleotide 1 (5′-ATG GAA AAG CTG GGT TAC CCC AAC CCC TAC CGA CTG GTT TGG-3′) is a 42-mer corresponding to the sense strand nucleotides and contains a BstEII site (italic type) for cloning.

Oligonucleotide 2 contains degenerate nucleotides (underlined) corresponding to codons 248–257 2The numbering of amino acids in murine, mature ferrochelatase is according to the recent sequencing results in this laboratory and the mouse genome sequence submitted by the Genome Exploration Research Group in RIKEN, Japan (GenBank™ nucleotide accession number AK004718.2). In the previously deposited sequence (GenBank™ protein accession number AAA80530), two codons (i.e. for Gln68 and Tyr69) were omitted. of the mature murine ferrochelatase loop residues. Each of the 10 loop codons was randomized using 85% wild-type nucleotides and a 15% mixture of the other three nucleotides. A 60-μl annealing reaction, containing 0.5 nmol of each oligonucleotide, 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm MgCl2, and 250 mm NaCl was incubated at 80 °C for 5 min, followed by 55 °C for 15 min, 37 °C for 15 min, and finally room temperature for 30 min. The hybrid was extended using the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I (5 units) in a 40-μl mixture containing 50 pmol of annealed oligonucleotides, a 62.5 μm concentration of each of the four dNTPs, and EcoPol buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, and 7.5 mm dithiothreitol). The extension reaction was carried out at 37 °C for 2 h. The generated double-stranded mutagenic DNA was then amplified by PCR using two primers corresponding to the 5′ termini of oligonucleotides 1 and 2. The two primers used were as follows: FC-66, 5′-ATG GAA AAG CTG GGT TAC CCC AA-3′, which covers the first 23 nucleotides of the 5′ terminus of oligonucleotide 1 and FC-R67, and 5′-AGC GTC ATC TGT CTG AGG-3′, which corresponds to the 18 nucleotides of the 5′ terminus of oligonucleotide 2. The PCRs were performed in 100-μl reaction volumes consisting of 20 pmol of primers FC-66 and FC-R67, 3–50 pmol of the extended double-stranded DNA as template, 50 μm each of the four dNTPs, 1 unit of VentR DNA polymerase, and ThermoPol reaction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm (NH4)2SO4, 2 mm MgSO4, and 0.1% Triton X-100). The reaction mixture was subjected to temperature cycling in a programmable thermal controller (MJ Research) by running 1 cycle of 95 °C for 2 min, followed by 30 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, 45 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 1 min and a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR product of 93 bp was purified using Microspin S200-HR columns (Amersham Biosciences), and subsequently digested with BstEII and PspOMI. The digested, ∼60-bp fragment was isolated from an agarose gel using GLASSFOG matrix and buffers in the MERmaid kit (Q-BIOgene) and subcloned into the dummy vector pZS1 previously digested with the same enzymes. The 20-μl ligation reaction contained the randomly mutagenized insert and vector at a 5:1 molar ratio, 1 mm ATP, 7 units of T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs), ligase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm ATP, and 25 μg/ml bovine serum albumin), 100 mm NaCl, and 10% polyethylene glycol 6000. After 16–20 h at 16 °C, the ligation reaction was purified by passing through Microspin S200-HR columns (Amersham Biosciences) and used to transform electrocompetent Δvis cells with an Electroporator II (Invitrogen). Aliquots of 1–2 μl of ligated products were electroporated into 40 μlof Δvis cells, using 0.1-cm cuvettes (Invitrogen) at 1.5 kV, 50 microfarads, and 150 ohms. After the pulse, transformants were resuspended in 1 ml of SOC medium (2% Bacto tryptone, 0.5% Bacto yeast extract, 10 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MgSO4, and 20 mm glucose) supplemented with 10 μg/ml hemin and incubated at 37 °C for 4 h with continuous shaking. To assess transformation efficiency, a small portion of the transformed cells was spread onto LB plates containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin, 0.4% (w/v) glucose and 10 μg/ml hemin. The remaining transformed cells were plated onto LB/ampicillin plates to allow selection of the active ferrochelatase variants. Genetic Selection in E. coli and DNA Sequence Analysis of the Functional Variants—Only Δvis cells expressing functional ferrochelatase can form colonies on hemin-free media. Aliquots of Δvis cells transformed with the random library ligation products were plated on LB-agar medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 0.4% (w/v) glucose and incubated at 37 °C for 24–30 h. Plasmids were isolated from all of the surviving colonies, and the randomized regions were sequenced to determine the permissible amino acid substitutions. To prepare double-stranded DNA templates, ∼20 ml of Δvis culture for each clone was grown overnight in Terrific Broth (21Tartof K.D. Hobbs C.A. Focus. 1987; 9: 12Google Scholar) containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 0.4% (w/v) glucose, and plasmids were purified using Qiagen Tip-20 (Qiagen). Sequences from 166 clones were determined by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method (22Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52653) Google Scholar) using a T7 sequenase 2.0 DNA sequencing kit (Amersham Biosciences) and [35S]dATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The remaining 48 clones were sequenced by the ABI automated DNA sequencers at the University of Florida. Zinc Chelatase Activity Assay of the Functional Variants—Δvis cells containing the active random variants were grown overnight at 37 °Cin Terrific Broth (21Tartof K.D. Hobbs C.A. Focus. 1987; 9: 12Google Scholar) containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 0.4% (w/v) glucose. These cultures were used to inoculate fresh medium at a 1:20 dilution; cells were grown at 37 °C to an A600 value of 0.8–1.0. 3 ml of Δvis cell cultures were pelleted, and crude cell extracts were prepared to a final volume of 1.2 ml, using the CelLytic B II bacterial cell lysis extraction reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Sigma). Zinc chelatase activity was determined by a fluorescence assay, using a RF-5301PC fluorimeter equipped with a red-sensitive photomultiplier tube (Shimadzu). Briefly, 300 μl of the cell extract was mixed with 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 3 μm ZnCl2, 2 μm protoporphyrin IX solution in a final volume of 2 ml. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h and the zinc-protoporphyrin formed was measured fluorimetrically by determining its emission at 592 nm using an λex = 421 nm (23Abbas A. Labbe-Bois R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8541-8546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Zinc chelatase activity was calculated as nmol of zinc-protoporphyrin produced per min by converting the rate of change in fluorescence intensity (arbitrary units min-1), using a standard curve of fluorescence intensity versus zinc-protoporphyrin concentration. Purification of Wild-type and Mutant Ferrochelatase—The wild-type murine ferrochelatase and selected, functional loop variants were expressed under the E. coli alkaline phosphatase promoter phoA as described previously (15Ferreira G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4396-4400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and purified as N-terminal His-tagged proteins. The corresponding plasmids were transformed into DH5α or BL21(DE3) cells, and the bacteria were grown overnight at 30 °C in MOPS medium containing 50 mg/liter ampicillin to promote protein overexpression (15Ferreira G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4396-4400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Wild-type ferrochelatase and single mutant V251L were purified using blue Sepharose affinity column chromatography according to an established protocol (15Ferreira G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4396-4400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The remaining four functional loop variants, including single mutant P255R, triple mutants S249A/K250Q/V251C and K250M/V251L/W256Y, and quadruple mutant Q248P/S249G/K250P/G252W, were purified using Talon metal-chelating affinity column chromatography followed by gel filtration chromatography. 8-Liter cultures of bacterial cells harboring the ferrochelatase variants were pelleted and then resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, containing 10% glycerol. After cell rupture by a French press (3–4 passages at 14,000 p.s.i.), the homogenate obtained was further solubilized in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, containing 0.5 m NaCl and 0.5% cholate under constant stirring at 4 °C for 30 min and subsequently ultracentrifuged at 44,000 rpm for 1 h. The supernatant was loaded onto a gravity column packed with ∼10 ml of Talon resin (BD Biosciences) and previously equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, containing 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.5% cholate (equilibration buffer). The resin was first washed with equilibration buffer, followed by sequential washes of equilibration buffer supplemented with increasing concentrations of imidazole stepping from 10 to 20 to 30 mm. Ferrochelatase was eluted from the Talon column with the equilibration buffer containing 100 mm imidazole. The eluted ferrochelatase was concentrated in an Amicon stirred cell and stored in liquid N2. For use in kinetic analyses, aliquots of concentrated ferrochelatase were loaded onto a PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, containing 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.5% cholate. Protein purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207165) Google Scholar), and protein concentration was determined using the bicinchonic acid assay with bovine serum albumin as a standard. UV-visible absorption spectra of purified ferrochelatase and variants were recorded using an UVPC-2100U dual beam spectrophotometer (Shimadzu) equipped with a 1-cm path length quartz cuvette at a controlled temperature of 23 °C. Determination of the metal ion content of S249A/K250Q/V251C and wild-type ferrochelatase using plasma emission spectroscopy was performed by the Chemical Analysis Laboratory at the University of Georgia. Steady-state Kinetic Analyses—Ferrochelatase activity was determined by monitoring the consumption of the protoporphyrin substrate using ferrous iron as the metal substrate in a continuous spectrofluorimetric assay conducted under strictly anaerobic conditions as previously described (25Shi Z. Ferreira G.C. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 318: 18-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Typically, a mixture containing 100 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.1, 0.5% (v/v) Tween 80, protoporphyrin IX was incubated with ferrochelatase for ∼5 min at 30 °C, and the enzymatic reaction was initiated by ferrous ammonium citrate injection (25Shi Z. Ferreira G.C. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 318: 18-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Activities are expressed as nmol of protoporphyrin consumed per min per mg of ferrochelatase. Steady-state kinetic parameters were determined from matrices of five protoporphyrin and five Fe2+ concentrations. The reported values and the S.D. values were obtained from the nonlinear least squares fit of the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation for bireactant systems using the software DataFit (Oakdale Engineering) (25Shi Z. Ferreira G.C. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 318: 18-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Liposome Binding Assay: Ferrochelatase (or Loop Variant)-Lipid Interactions—All of the functional variants in the library were purified using a TALON HT 96-well plate (BD Biosciences). The equilibration, wash, and elution buffers were the same as for purification by Talon affinity column. Eluate from each well was concentrated, and imidazole was removed by buffer exchange using an Amicon Ultra-4 centrifugal filter unit (Millipore). Liposomes were formulated with a lipid composition similar to that found in the inner mitochondrial membranes of mouse liver cells (26Ardail D. Privat J.P. Egret-Charlier M. Levrat C. Lerme F. Louisot P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18797-18802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Biotinylated liposomes were prepared following a standard procedure (27Zhu H. Bilgin M. Bangham R. Hall D. Casamayor A. Bertone P. Lan N. Jansen R. Bidlingmaier S. Houfek T. Mitchell T. Miller P. Dean R.A. Gerstein M. Snyder M. Science. 2001; 293: 2101-2105Crossref PubMed Scopus (1937) Google Scholar). Each lipid was weighed and suspended in chloroform to make a 1 mg/ml stock solution. The stocks were mixed at ratios (w/w) of 1% biotin-DHPE, 35% phosphatidylcholine, 26.5% phosphatidylethanolamine, 18% cardiolipin, 5% phosphatidylinositol, 2.3% cholesterol, 2.8% diacylglycerol, 0.7% sphingomyelin, 0.5% phosphatidylserine, 0.5% lysophosphatidylcholine, 0.3% lysophosphatidylethanolamine, 2.2% palmitic acid, 1.2% stearic acid, 1.3% oleic acid, 1.8% linoleic acid, and 0.9% arachidonic acid. The mixture was dried under N2; resuspended in 25 mm Tris, pH 7.6, and 150 mm NaCl (TBS); and sonicated to obtain a liposome solution at 100 μg/ml. Liposome size distribution was determined at 26 °C by dynamic light scattering using a submicron particle size analyzer (Beckman Coulter). For the protein-lipid interaction assay, a dilution series of each purified variant was spotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher and Schuell), blocked in 50 ml of Superblock buffer (Pierce) for 2 h at room temperature (23 °C), and probed with 50 μl of liposome stock solution diluted in 50 ml of TBS at 30 °C for 1 h. After washing three times in TBS with 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 (TBST), the blot was incubated with peroxidase-conjugated extravidin (Sigma) at a 1:50,000 dilution for 30 min at room temperature. Following extensive washing, the"

The main biopterin transporter (BT1) and pterin reductase (PTR1) have already been characterized in Leishmania. In this study, we have succeeded in generating a BT1 and PTR1 null mutant in the same Leishmania tarentolae strain. These cells are viable with growth properties indistinguishable from wildtype cells. However, in response to the inactivation of BT1 and PTR1, at least one of the folate transporter genes was deleted, and the level of the folylpolyglutamate synthetase activity was increased, leading to increased polyglutamylation of both folate and methotrexate (MTX). Secondary events following gene inactivation should be considered when analyzing a phenotype in Leishmania. The BT1/PTR1 null mutant is hypersensitive to MTX, but in a step-by-step fashion, we could induce resistance to MTX in these cells. Several resistance mechanisms were found to co-exist including a reduced folate and MTX accumulation, demonstrating that cells with no measurable biopterin uptake but also greatly reduced folate uptake are viable, despite their auxotrophy for each of these substrates. The resistant cells have also amplified the gene coding for the MTX target dihydrofolate reductase. Finally, we found a marked reduction in MTX polyglutamylation in resistant cells. These studies further highlight the formidable ability of Leishmania cells to bypass the blockage of key metabolic pathways. The protozoan parasite Leishmania is a folate and pterin auxotroph.

These studies further highlight the formidable ability of Leishmania cells to bypass the blockage of key metabolic pathways. The protozoan parasite Leishmania is responsible for a number of diseases with a wide range of clinical symptoms (1Herwaldt B.L. Lancet. 1999; 354: 1191-1199Google Scholar). Chemotherapy is currently the only effective way to control the infection, but the emergence of drug-resistant organisms, particularly against the first line antimony-containing drugs, is complicating the treatment (2Guerin P.J. Olliaro P. Sundar S. Boelaert M. Croft S.L. Desjeux P. Wasunna M.K. Bryceson A.D. Lancet Infect. Dis. 2002; 2: 494-501Google Scholar). The discovery of new putative cellular targets is urgently required. Leishmania differs from its mammalian host in that it cannot synthesize pterins from GTP and differs from several microorganisms in that it cannot synthesize folates de novo. Indeed, it lacks enzymes necessary for the conjugation of the three building blocks (pterin, para aminobenzoic acid, and glutamate), leading to folates (reviewed in Ref. 3Ouellette M. Drummelsmith J.

Chem. 2002; 277: 29460-29467Google Scholar) that allow the transport of folate and pterin derivatives. These derivatives can be reduced into active molecules by the parasite dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthetase (DHFR-TS) and by a novel pterin reductase PTR1 (3Ouellette M. Drummelsmith J.

Leishmania does have an active folylpolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS) (9El Fadili A. Kundig C. Ouellette M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 124: 63-71Google Scholar), permitting Leishmania to synthesize folylpolyglutamates that are essential for cellular retention (10Shane B. Vitam. Horm. 1989; 45: 263-335Google Scholar). Reduced folates are one-carbon donors in various metabolic reactions including the synthesis of thymidine. Pterins are essential growth factors of Leishmania (11Trager W. J. Protozool. 1969; 16: 372-375Google Scholar, 12Peixoto M.P. Beverley S.M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1987; 31: 1575-1578Google Scholar, 13Roy G. Kundig C. Olivier M. Papadopoulou B. Ouellette M. Exp. Parasitol. 2001; 97: 161-168Google Scholar, 14Beck J.T. Ullman B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1990; 43: 221-230Google Scholar) and may play a number of other roles. Indeed, the almost completed Leishmania major genome project has revealed homologues to aromatic amino acid hydroxylases and to products involved in the biosynthesis of the molybdopterin cofactor (3Ouellette M. Drummelsmith J. El Fadili A. Kundig C. Richard D. Roy G. Int. J. Parasitol. 2002; 32: 385-398Google Scholar). Finally, experimental evidence has been provided to link pterin levels with parasite metacyclogenesis (15Cunningham M.L. Titus R.G. Turco S.J. Beverley S.M. Science. 2001; 292: 285-287Google Scholar).Leishmania cells often resist the antifolate drug methotrexate (MTX) by reducing the accumulation of the drug (16Ellenberger T.E. Beverley S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13501-13506Google Scholar, 17Kaur K. Coons T. Emmett K. Ullman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7020-7028Google Scholar, 18Papadopoulou B. Roy G. Ouellette M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4305-4312Google Scholar). This can be achieved by gene deletion of some of the folate transporter FT genes (7Richard D. Kundig C. Ouellette M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29460-29467Google Scholar). Since Leishmania is a folate auxotroph, this gene deletion event needs to be compensated for, and we have found that in Leishmania tarentolae strains, in which the main folate transporter is deleted, the biopterin transporter BT1, which can also transport some folates, is overexpressed (4Kündig C. Haimeur A. Légaré D. Papadopoulou B. Ouellette M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2342-2351Google Scholar). The BT1 gene has been inactivated in a number of species (4Kündig C. Haimeur A. Légaré D. Papadopoulou B. Ouellette M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2342-2351Google Scholar, 5Lemley C. Yan S. Dole V.S. Madhubala R. Cunningham M.L. Beverley S.M. Myler P.J. Stuart K.D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 104: 93-105Google Scholar, 15Cunningham M.L. Titus R.G. Turco S.J. Beverley S.M. Science. 2001; 292: 285-287Google Scholar), and although cells can grow in culture flasks, they are less virulent in animal models (19Papadopoulou B. Roy G. Breton M. Kundig C. Dumas C. Fillion I. Singh A.K. Olivier M. Ouellette M. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 62-68Google Scholar), demonstrating an important role for pterin transport in parasite biology. The PTR1 gene has also been inactivated in a number of species, and these PTR1 null mutants were more sensitive to MTX (20Papadopoulou B. Roy G. Mourad W. Leblanc E. Ouellette M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7310-7315Google Scholar, 21Bello A.R. Nare B. Freedman D. Hardy L. Beverley S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11442-11446Google Scholar), had a decreased ability to reduce pterins, and recently were shown in animal models to be more virulent as low levels of reduced pterins induced metacyclogenesis (15Cunningham M.L. Titus R.G. Turco S.J. Beverley S.M. Science. 2001; 292: 285-287Google Scholar).Although pterins cannot serve for the de novo biosynthesis of folates, there are several interconnections between folate and pterin metabolism, and several Leishmania species can grow in folate-deficient medium provided that pterins are present (12Peixoto M.P. Beverley S.M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1987; 31: 1575-1578Google Scholar, 14Beck J.T. Ullman B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1990; 43: 221-230Google Scholar, 20Papadopoulou B. Roy G. Mourad W. Leblanc E. Ouellette M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7310-7315Google Scholar). It has been suggested that pterins could have a folate-sparing effect, a phenomenon described 46 years ago in the related parasite Crithidia fasciculata (22Kidder G. Dutta B. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1958; 18: 621-638Google Scholar), although the mechanism by which this is achieved is not understood. In an attempt to further increase our understanding of pterin metabolism in Leishmania, we succeeded, somewhat surprisingly, in generating mutants in which both the main pterin transporter (BT1) and the pterin reductase (PTR1) were disrupted by homologous recombination. Cells were viable, but some of their folate metabolism was changed. Since BT1 overexpression appears to compensate for mutations in the folate/MTX transporter in L. tarentolae MTX-resistant mutants (4Kündig C. Haimeur A. Légaré D. Papadopoulou B. Ouellette M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2342-2351Google Scholar), we assumed that selection of MTX resistance in a BT1/PTR1 null mutant would leave folate transport intact. Selection of the BT1/PTR1 cells for MTX resistance led to unexpected results that will be presented here.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Growth—The L. tarentolae cell line TarII WT and the TarII BT1/PTR1 null mutants were grown in SDM-79 (23Brun R. Schonenberger Acta Trop. 1979; 36: 289-292Google Scholar) or M199 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 5 μg/ml hemin. The BT1/PTR1 null mutant was selected for MTX resistance in a step-by-step fashion as reported previously (18Papadopoulou B. Roy G. Ouellette M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4305-4312Google Scholar) to lead to two mutants, MTX50.2 and MTX500.3, that were highly resistant to MTX. For HPLC analysis, cells were grown in M199 medium supplemented with 25 nm [3H]folic acid (25.7 Ci/mmol) or 25 nm [3H]MTX (26.62 Ci/mmol) (Moravek Biochemicals).DNA Manipulations—Total DNA for Southern blot analysis was isolated using DNAzol reagent (Invitrogen). Southern blots, hybridization, and washing conditions were done following standard protocols (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The PTR1, BT1, DHFR-TS, FPGS, neomycin phosphotransferase (NEO), hygromycin phosphotransferase (HYG), and FT probes were obtained by PCR. Wild-type L. tarentolae promastigotes were transfected by electroporation as reported previously (25Papadopoulou B. Roy G. Ouellette M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3601-3608Google Scholar). Selections were done with hygromycin B (≥100 μg/ml) and G 418 (≥40 μg/ml).DNA Constructs—PTR1 inactivation was carried out using a construct described previously (20Papadopoulou B. Roy G. Mourad W. Leblanc E. Ouellette M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7310-7315Google Scholar). The linearized 3.3-kb XhoI/XhoI fragment containing PTR1 interrupted by NEO was electroporated (25Papadopoulou B. Roy G. Ouellette M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3601-3608Google Scholar) in the TARII BT1 null mutant described previously in which the two BT1 alleles were inactivated by the HYG gene (4Kündig C. Haimeur A. Légaré D. Papadopoulou B. Ouellette M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2342-2351Google Scholar). Selection was initially with 40 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen) for disrupting one PTR1 allele by homologous recombination. Disruption of the second PTR1 allele was obtained by selection for loss of heterozygosity by increasing the G418 selection pressure to 200 μg/ml and cloning of the cell pool. TARII BT1/PTR1 null mutants (TARII BT1/PTR1 KO) were characterized by Southern blot analysis using PCR probes for the BT1, PTR1, NEO, and HYG genes.Enzymatic Assays in Crude Extracts—FPGS activity of Leishmania cells was assayed using extracts prepared essentially as described previously (9El Fadili A. Kundig C. Ouellette M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 124: 63-71Google Scholar). l-[3H]glutamate (5 mCi/mmol) and 500 μm of either folic acid or MTX were added to the crude extracts of different strains. Separation of non-incorporated l-[3H]glutamate from the folylpolyglutamates or the MTX polyglutamates was done using a DEAE-cellulose column (Sigma).Accumulation Studies—Transport experiments of folic acid, biopterin, and MTX were done as described previously (18Papadopoulou B. Roy G. Ouellette M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4305-4312Google Scholar). [3H]Folic acid (25.7 Ci/mmol), [3H]biopterin (6 Ci/mmol), and [3H]MTX (26.62 Ci/mmol) were purchased from Moravek Biochemicals, and transport studies were done using 200 nm substrate. Briefly, 1 × 106 cells were layered over 100 μl of dibutylphthalate (Sigma) and put in the presence of radioactive pteridine. Accumulation of radioactive substrates was stopped at various time points (0, 0.5, 2, 5, and 20 min) by centrifugation through the inert dibutylphthalate layer. Unincorporated substrates were removed by aspiration, cells were washed once in HEPES-NaCl buffer, and pellets were resuspended in scintillation liquid and counted. The amount of incorporated radioactivity was normalized with Leishmania cell number, and values of uptake in cells incubated on ice were subtracted.HPLC Analysis—All HPLC reagents were obtained from U. S. Bioscience and were of HPLC grade. HPLC standards were purchased from Dr. Schirck's laboratory, Jona, Switzerland. The intracellular folylpolyglutamates in Leishmania wild-type cells and mutants were determined as described previously (9El Fadili A. Kundig C. Ouellette M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 124: 63-71Google Scholar), and the extent of MTX polyglutamylation was assayed by HPLC using essentially the same procedure as described previously (26El Fadili A. Richard D. Kundig C. Ouellette M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 66: 999-1008Google Scholar). Cells were incubated with 25 nm [3H]pteridines for 72 h.RESULTSGeneration of a BT1 and PTR1 Null Mutant of L. tarentolae—L. tarentolae cells becoming resistant to MTX by reducing folate/MTX uptake compensate by overexpressing the biopterin transporter BT1 gene (4Kündig C. Haimeur A. Légaré D. Papadopoulou B. Ouellette M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2342-2351Google Scholar). BT1 is a biopterin transporter that can also transport some folate. We reasoned that without BT1, we might select for mutations other than those affecting folate/MTX uptake. We first tried to select MTX-resistant mutants starting from a BT1 null mutant, but in all mutants studied, we found amplification of PTR1 (results not shown). We thus attempted to generate a BT1/PTR1 null mutant in the hope that after MTX selection, a novel resistant mutation could be found that would provide new insights into folate metabolism.Leishmania cells disrupted either in PTR1 (15Cunningham M.L. Titus R.G. Turco S.J. Beverley S.M. Science. 2001; 292: 285-287Google Scholar, 20Papadopoulou B. Roy G. Mourad W. Leblanc E. Ouellette M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7310-7315Google Scholar, 21Bello A.R. Nare B. Freedman D. Hardy L. Beverley S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11442-11446Google Scholar) or in BT1 (4Kündig C. Haimeur A. Légaré D. Papadopoulou B. Ouellette M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2342-2351Google Scholar, 5Lemley C. Yan S. Dole V.S. Madhubala R. Cunningham M.L. Beverley S.M. Myler P.J. Stuart K.D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 104: 93-105Google Scholar) have been described but not BT1/PTR1 null mutants. The L. tarentolae BT1 null mutant (4Kündig C. Haimeur A. Légaré D. Papadopoulou B. Ouellette M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2342-2351Google Scholar) is presented briefly in Fig. 1A. The single copy BT1 gene was interrupted by the HYG marker, and a BT1 HYG/HYG null mutant was obtained by loss of heterozygocity. Indeed, although the intact copy of BT1 is part of a 3.5-kb PstI-PstI fragment (Fig. 1B, lane 1), this fragment disappears in the BT1 null mutant and is replaced by two fragments of 2.7 and 1.8 kb, consistent with the integration of the HYG marker in the BT1 gene (Fig. 1, A and B, lane 2). In this BT1 null mutant, we introduced a NEO construct that would enable us to target the PTR1 gene (Fig. 1C). Transfection of the BT1 null mutant with this construct led to G418-resistant parasites that indeed had integrated the NEO construct at the level of one PTR1 allele (not shown). By increasing the concentration of the selective drug G418 and subsequent cloning of the cell pool, we were able to obtain by loss of heterozygocity a PTR1 null mutant in a BT1 null mutant background (Fig. 1). Indeed, although the intact PTR1 copy is part of an 2.3-kb XhoI-XhoI fragment (Fig. 1D, lane 1), this fragment increases to 3.2 kb in the null mutant and also hybridizes with a NEO probe (Fig. 1D, lane 2). Due to the central role of pterins in Leishmania growth, we were surprised that we could obtain a L. tarentolae BT1/PTR1 null mutant. Even more surprisingly, the genetic mutant had no measurable growth defect in the folate-rich (15 μm) medium SDM-79 (Fig. 2A) and had only a small growth defect in the low folate (20 nm) medium M199 (Fig. 2B). L. tarentolae cells disrupted in either PTR1 or BT1 were previously reported to be more sensitive to MTX, whereas cells transfected with PTR1 and BT1 were found to be resistant to MTX (4Kündig C. Haimeur A. Légaré D. Papadopoulou B. Ouellette M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2342-2351Google Scholar, 20Papadopoulou B. Roy G. Mourad W. Leblanc E. Ouellette M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7310-7315Google Scholar). Indeed, the BT1 null mutant was four times more sensitive to MTX, whereas the PTR1 null mutant was 50 times more sensitive than a wild-type cell (Fig. 3A). The BT1/PTR1 null mutant was found to be 200 times more sensitive to MTX as compared with wild-type cells in SDM-79 medium (Fig. 3A). The roles of PTR1 and BT1 in MTX resistance were also confirmed by gene transfection. Transfectants overexpressing PTR1 become insensitive to MTX, whereas BT1 transfectants were ∼10 times more resistant when grown in SDM-79 medium (Fig. 3B). The susceptibility of Leishmania cells is highly dependent on the folate concentration of the medium, and indeed, the EC50 of wild-type cells to MTX is 100 nm in M199 medium (as compared with ∼25 μm in SDM-79), and the BT1/PTR1 null mutant was more sensitive to MTX with an EC50 of 15 nm (Fig. 3C). Cells in M199 medium overexpressing PTR1 were also highly resistant to MTX (result not shown), but surprisingly, BT1 overexpressing cells were not much more resistant to MTX as compared with wild-type cells in the M199 medium (Fig. 3C). We hypothesized that this discrepancy in BT1-mediated resistance between SDM-79 and M199 could be due to a difference in folate concentration. Indeed, when BT1 overexpressors were grown in M199 medium, but with the addition of folic acid to concentrations found in SDM-79, the parasites were MTX-resistant (Fig. 3C).Fig. 2Growth properties of Leishmania cells. The growth of L. tarentolae TarII WT (•); of the BT1/PTR1 null mutant, TarII BT1/PTR1 KO (○); or of the two BT1/PTR1 null mutant clones selected for high level methotrexate resistance TarII MTX 50.2 (▪); and TarII MTX 500.3 (□) were measured in SDM-79 medium (A) or in M199 medium (B). Equal amounts of cells (5 × 106) were inoculated in 5 ml of medium and grown at 29 °C. Optical density at 600 nm was measured according to time. The average of triplicate independent measurements is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 3Methotrexate hypersensitivity of the L. tarentolae BT1/PTR1 null mutant. Leishmania cells were grown in SDM-79 medium (A and B) or M199 medium (± folic acid) (C), and their growth was measured at 68–72 h while varying the concentration of methotrexate. Cells that were studied include the wild-type cell TarII WT and several cells with genes inactivated or overexpressed. Cells in which PTR1 was the inactivated TarII PTR1 KO, in which BT1 was the inactivated TarII BT1 KO, cells in which both BT1 and PTR1 were the inactivated TarII BT1/PTR1 KO, or MTX-resistant cells derived from the latter, TarII MTX 50.2 and TarII MTX 500.3, were studied. Finally, the susceptibility of cells in which PTR1 TarII(PTR1NEO) or BT1 TarII(BT1NEO) were overexpressed as part of episomal plasmids was also studied. The average of a minimum of triplicate measurements is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Biological Compensation Following Inactivation of the BT1 and PTR1 Genes of Leishmania—Based on the central role of pterins in Leishmania, it could be suggested that Leishmania cells would not thrive well in the absence of PTR1 and BT1, two proteins key in providing active pterins to the cell. The BT1/PTR1 mutant had minimal growth defects (Fig. 2), and cells have been propagated for over a year without problems. It is likely that several metabolic features are changed in this genetic mutant to compensate for the lack of BT1 and PTR1. As expected from a BT1 null mutant, there is no measurable biopterin uptake in the BT1/PTR1 null mutant (Fig. 4A). In L. tarentolae cells in which folate uptake is greatly impaired, we have observed an increased uptake of biopterin (4Kündig C. Haimeur A. Légaré D. Papadopoulou B. Ouellette M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2342-2351Google Scholar), and because there are several interconnections between folate and pterin metabolism, we tested here whether folate uptake was modulated in the BT1/PTR1 null mutant. Surprisingly, we found that both folate and MTX uptake were slightly but repeatedly decreased in the BT1/PTR1 null mutant (Fig. 4, B and C). Another aspect of folate metabolism that was recently studied in Leishmania cells concerned folate polyglutamylation, in which folates are found mostly as pentaglutamates (9El Fadili A. Kundig C. Ouellette M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 124: 63-71Google Scholar, 27Santi D.V. Nolan P. Shane B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 146: 1089-1092Google Scholar), whereas MTX is found predominantly in the form of triglutamates in L. tarentolae (26El Fadili A. Richard D. Kundig C. Ouellette M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 66: 999-1008Google Scholar). We found that the glutamate chain lengths both of folate and most notably of MTX were increased significantly in the BT1/PTR1 null mutant as compared with wild-type cells (Tables I and II). The HPLC analysis of folates for the BT1/PTR1 null mutant led to the observation of other radioactive peaks consistent with polyglutamates longer than Glu6 (results not shown).Fig. 4Accumulation of radiolabeled pteridines in Leishmania cells. The transport studies in the L. tarentolae wild-type cell (•), TarII BT1/PTR1 null mutant (○), and BT1/PTR1 null mutant cells selected for methotrexate resistance TarII MTX 50.2 (▪) and TarII MTX 500.3 (□) were carried out as described under “Materials and Methods.” Leishmania cells were grown in SDM-79, and pteridine uptake was measured using 200 nm substrate. The accumulated radioactivity was normalized with Leishmania cell numbers, and background uptake in cells incubated on ice was subtracted.

Chem. 2002; 277: 29460-29467Google Scholar), and we used a probe recognizing several members of this gene family. A rearrangement of some folate transporter genes was observed in the BT1/PTR1 null mutant since a 2.5-kb PstI-PstI hybridizing fragment present in wild-type cells was absent in the genetic mutant (Fig. 5E, lanes 1 and 2). The copy number of FPGS was similar in the wild-type and null mutant (Fig. 5F, lanes 1 and 2), but FPGS activity was significantly higher in the null mutant as compared with wild-type cells (Fig. 6).Fig. 5Gene copy number determination of pterin/folate metabolic genes in Leishmania cells.

The average of three independent experiments are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Selection of MTX-resistant Mutants in the BT1/PTR1 Null Mutants—Despite the fact that BT1/PTR1 null mutant cells were hypersensitive to MTX, we were interested in generating MTX-resistant mutants in the hope of finding novel resistance genes. We succeeded in generating two highly MTX-resistant mutants TarII MTX 50.2 and TarII MTX 500.3 (Fig. 3). These highly resistant mutants had only a small growth defect as compared with their parent genetic mutant (Fig. 2). We first tested whether folate/MTX uptake was impaired in these mutants that had no active BT1. Against our expectations, these mutants exhibited a marked decrease in folate and MTX uptake (Fig. 4, B and C) with folate accumulating slightly more efficiently than MTX. Thus, Leishmania cells can survive without a biopterin transporter and with a much reduced folate transport activity. Both the BT1- and PTR1-disrupted loci remained intact upon MTX selection (Fig. 5, A and B). Leishmania cells often resist drugs by gene amplification (28Beverley S.M. Annu. Rev.

https://openalex.org/W2011172556,"The threonine and serine protein kinase AKT plays a major role in inhibiting apoptosis in a number of malignant cell types including prostate and breast carcinoma. Activation of AKT is a complex process involving translocation to the plasma membrane and phosphorylation of serine and threonine amino-acid residues. We now report that the novel compound 4-[3-(1-adamantyl)-4-hydroxyphenyl]-3-chlorocinnamic acid (3-Cl-AHPC), induces apoptosis in breast and prostate carcinoma cells and inhibits AKT activity in these cells. Overexpression of a constitutively activated AKT inhibits 3-Cl-AHPC-mediated apoptosis. Decrease in AKT activity occurs through 3-Cl-AHPC inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3-K) activity. 3-Cl-AHPC inhibits PI3-K activity by enhancing epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) proteolysis and thus inhibiting EGFR association with the p85 subunit of PI3-K. 3-Cl-AHPC-mediated decrease in PI3-K activity results in the reduced synthesis of phosphatidylinositol 3,4 bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5 triphosphate with the subsequent inhibition of integrin-linked kinase activity and serine-473 phosphorylation of AKT. Overexpression of EGFR results in increased AKT activity and inhibition of 3-Cl-AHPC-mediated decrease in AKT activation, AKT activity and 3-Cl-AHPC-mediated apoptosis. Inhibition of AKT activity by this compound results in the inability of AKT to phosphorylate and inactivate the proapoptotic forkhead transcription factor."

However, in the pentameric ligand-gated ion channel receptor family, the structural basis of partial agonism is not understood. This study investigated whether full and partial agonists induce different conformation changes in the glycine receptor chloride channel (GlyR). A substituted cysteine accessibility analysis demonstrated previously that glycine binding induced an increase in surface accessibility of all residues from Arg271 to Lys276 in the M2-M3 domain of the homomeric α1 GlyR. Here we compare the surface accessibility changes induced by the full agonist, glycine, and the partial agonist, taurine. In GlyRs incorporating the A272C, S273C, L274C, or P275C mutation, the reaction rate of the cysteine-specific compound, methanethiosulfonate ethyltrimethylammonium, depended on how strongly the receptors were activated but was agonist-independent. Reaction rates could not be compared in the R271C and K276C mutant GlyRs because methanethiosulfonate ethyltrimethylammonium did not modify the extremely small currents induced by saturating taurine or equivalent low glycine concentrations. The results indicate that bound taurine and glycine molecules impose identical conformational changes to the M2-M3 domain. We therefore conclude that the higher efficacy of glycine is due to an increased ability to stabilize a common activated configuration.

Sci. 2002; 23: 519-527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). It belongs to the family of pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (LGICs) that includes the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) as its prototypical member (3Karlin A. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 102-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). Each subunit incorporates a large N-terminal extracellular domain and four α-helical membrane-spanning domains. The second membrane-spanning (M2) domains curve radially so as to form a tapering, water-filled pore with a hydrophobic barrier (or channel gate) at either its mid-point (4Miyazawa A. Fujiyoshi Y. Unwin N. Nature. 2003; 424: 949-955Crossref Scopus (1070) Google Scholar) or intracellular boundary (5Wilson G.G. Karlin A. Neuron. 1998; 20: 1269-1281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domains contain the agonist-binding sites and a disulfide loop that is an invariant feature of LGIC receptors (6Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. Schuurmans M. van Der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1564) Google Scholar). Agonists binding in the N-terminal domain initiate conformational changes that propagate as a wave toward the channel gate (7Grosman C. Zhou M. Auerbach A. Nature. 2000; 403: 773-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Different agonists induce these conformational changes with different efficacies (where efficacy is the ability of an agonist to open the channel once bound to the receptor). If the efficacy of an agonist is sufficiently low, it will behave as a partial agonist (8Colquhoun D. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 924-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). The structural basis of differential agonist efficacy is not yet understood for any member of the LGIC family. Partial agonism could be caused by one, or a combination, of the following two sharply contrasting mechanisms. First, it is possible that different agonists induce different structural changes throughout the protein. A clear example of this has been characterized recently (9Armstrong N. Gouaux E. Neuron. 2000; 28: 165-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar, 10Armstrong N. Mayer M. Gouaux E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5736-5741Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 11Jin R. Banke T.G. Mayer M.L. Traynelis S.F. Gouaux E. Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 803-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) in the ionotropic glutamate receptor cation channel. These studies show that low efficacy agonists induce a smaller degree of binding site core closure than do high efficacy agonists, and show that this smaller degree of closure is translated to the activation gate as a smaller degree of channel opening (11Jin R. Banke T.G. Mayer M.L. Traynelis S.F. Gouaux E. Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 803-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). An alternative possibility is that high and low efficacy agonists induce identical global conformational changes but that the activated state is more stable for the more efficacious agonist. Glycine and taurine activate the GlyR with different efficacies; taurine has a low efficacy and generally behaves as a partial agonist at this receptor, whereas glycine is a full agonist (12Lewis T.M. Schofield P.R. McClellan A.M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 549: 361-374Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The present study seeks to establish whether or not taurine and glycine induce identical conformational changes in a domain that links the ligand-binding site to the activation gate. This may provide insights into the structural basis of partial agonist action at the GlyR. The substituted cysteine accessibility method can quantitate changes in protein conformation. The method entails introducing cysteine residues one at a time into a protein domain of interest. The reactivity of these cysteines is then assayed by exposure to highly soluble, sulfhydryl-specific reagents, generally methanethiosulfonate derivatives (13Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 123-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). If a functional property of the channel is irreversibly modified upon exposure to such a reagent, the cysteine is assumed to be exposed at the water-accessible protein surface. Differences in the cysteine modification rate between the closed and open states may provide information about the associated structural changes. Our laboratory previously used this approach to demonstrate a glycine-induced increase in the surface exposure of six continuous residues (Arg271–Lys276) in the GlyR M2-M3 linker domain (14Lynch J.W. Han N.L. Haddrill J. Pierce K.D. Schofield P.R. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 2589-2599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These residues lie mid-way between the binding site and the activation gate (7Grosman C. Zhou M. Auerbach A. Nature. 2000; 403: 773-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), and it is now well established that they experience a conformational change that is crucial for the activation of GlyRs (14Lynch J.W.

Nature. 2003; 424: 949-955Crossref Scopus (1070) Google Scholar) that these residues form an extramembranous extension to the M2 α-helix. This domain is likely to interact closely with loops 2 and 5 of the ligand-binding domain (4Miyazawa A. Fujiyoshi Y. Unwin N. Nature. 2003; 424: 949-955Crossref Scopus (1070) Google Scholar, 17Absalom N.L. Lewis T.M. Kaplan W. Pierce K.D. Schofield P.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 279: 4887-4893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). A particular advantage of investigating this domain is that it lies outside the ligand-binding pocket (6Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. Schuurmans M. van Der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1564) Google Scholar), so changes in methanethiosulfonate reaction rates are unlikely to be influenced by steric effects of ligand binding. The aim of the present study is to employ substituted cysteine accessibility method to determine whether or not glycine and taurine induce identical changes in the surface accessibility of residues Arg271–Lys276. Mutagenesis and Expression of Human GlyR α1 Subunit cDNAs—Site-directed mutations were incorporated into the human GlyR α1 subunit cDNA in the pCIS2 vector using the QuickChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The successful incorporation of the mutations was verified by cDNA sequencing. The WT and all cysteine mutant GlyRs investigated in this study incorporated the C41A mutation, which eliminated the only free external sulfhydryl group. This mutation had no significant effect on GlyR EC50 values or peak current magnitudes (14Lynch J.W. Han N.L. Haddrill J. Pierce K.D. Schofield P.R. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 2589-2599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The WT and mutant plasmid constructs were transiently transfected into HEK293 cells using a modified calcium phosphate precipitation method. After transfection for 24 h, the cells were washed twice with cell culture medium, and electrophysiological studies were conducted over the following 24–72 h. Patch Clamp Electrophysiology—Glycine- and taurine-gated currents were measured using whole-cell recording at a holding potential of –50 mV using an Axopatch 1D amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA), and data were directly recorded to disk using pCLAMP6 software (Axon Instruments). Cells were continually perfused at ∼2 ml/min with the standard bathing solution containing (in mm): 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 10 glucose, pH 7.4. Patch pipettes were heat-polished and had tip resistances of 2–4 megohms when filled with the standard intracellular solution containing (in mm): 145 CsCl, 2 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 10 EGTA, pH 7.4. At least 50% of full series resistance compensation was applied in all recordings. MTSET, obtained from Toronto Research Chemicals (Toronto, Canada), was prepared as a stock solution of 10 mm in distilled water and maintained on ice for up to 3 h until used. It was applied to cells within 30 s of being dissolved into room temperature bathing solution. The disulfide-reducing agent, dithiothreitol (DTT), was prepared daily as a 1 mm solution in the standard bathing solution. This DTT-containing solution had no irreversible effect on the magnitude of currents in the WT GlyR. Solutions were applied to cells via a parallel system of gravity-fed tubes, and solution exchange was effected with a time constant of about 100 ms. Experiments were performed at room temperature (19–22 °C). The effects of MTSET on glycine- and taurine-gated currents were tested using the following procedure. Prior to MTSET application, cells were bathed in 1 mm DTT for 1 min to ensure that exposed sulfhydryl groups were fully reduced. Then the agonist dose response was measured by applying increasing agonist concentrations at 1-min intervals. The relative magnitude of currents activated by saturating concentrations of taurine and glycine was also measured. Following this, three consecutive brief applications of a constant glycine concentration were applied at 1-min intervals to establish that the current magnitude was invariant (±5%) prior to the application of MTSET. Following application of the MTSET-containing solution, cells were washed in control solution for at least 2 min before the maximum current magnitudes and taurine EC50 values were measured again. If an irreversible effect was observed, the MTSET concentration was adjusted so that the time constant of the current response was between 0.3 and 20 s. The receptor desensitization rate was low (<0.005 s–1) for all mutant GlyRs used in this study and as such did not impact significantly on the measurement of MTSET reactivity rates. It is estimated that a 10% irreversible change in current over 1 min would have been reliably detected. Data Analysis—Results are expressed as means ± S.E. of four or more independent experiments. The empirical Hill equation, fitted by a non-linear least squares algorithm (Origin, Microcal, Northampton, MA), was used to calculate the 50% effective concentrations for activation (EC50) and inhibition (IC50) and the Hill coefficient (nH) values. Exponential fits were performed using the same non-linear least squares algorithm. Statistical significance was determined by one-way ANOVA using the Student-Newman-Keuls post hoc test for unpaired or paired data as appropriate (Sigmastat, Jandel, San Rafael, CA), with p < 0.05 representing significance. Characterization of Cysteine-substituted Mutant GlyRs—It was shown previously that MTSET modification of cysteines introduced into the N-terminal half of the M2-M3 domain (i.e. from R271C to K276C) resulted in irreversible changes in the glycine EC50 values without affecting the saturating current magnitudes (14Lynch J.W. Han N.L. Haddrill J. Pierce K.D. Schofield P.R. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 2589-2599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Absalom N.L. Lewis T.M. Kaplan W. Pierce K.D. Schofield P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50151-50157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The same study also showed that the MTSET reaction rate of all these cysteines was relatively slow in the resting closed state but was increased dramatically in the glycine-bound state. The aim of the present study is to compare the effects of MTSET on the taurine-activated receptor with its effects on the glycine-activated receptor. The taurine agonist EC50 and nH values for the WT and all cysteine-substituted mutant GlyRs examined in this study are summarized in Table I. The taurine EC50 values for the A272C, S273C, L274C, and P275C mutant GlyRs are significantly increased relative to the WT value. Averaged glycine and taurine dose responses for the WT and L274C mutant GlyRs are shown in Fig. 1A. The peak magnitudes of taurine-gated currents were too small to permit reliable EC50 measurement in the R271C and K276C mutant GlyRs. The corresponding glycine EC50 values for the WT and all mutant GlyRs, reproduced from Lynch et al. (14Lynch J.W. Han N.L. Haddrill J. Pierce K.D. Schofield P.R. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 2589-2599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), are included for comparison. The ratio of the maximum current activated by taurine relative to that activated by glycine (Imax, tau/Imax, gly) for each mutant GlyR is also shown (Table I). In calculating these ratios, the glycine- and taurine-gated currents were both recorded from the same cell. The cysteine substitution mutations invariably caused a significant reduction in this ratio. Thus, taurine behaves as a full agonist in the WT GlyR but as a partial agonist relative to glycine in all mutant receptors examined.Table ITaurine activation and inhibition of cysteine-substituted mutant GlyRsGlyRGlycine EC50aFrom Lynch et al.

Open table in a new tab The ability of taurine to inhibit currents activated by an EC50 glycine concentration was also measured. An example of taurine inhibition of EC50 (400 μm) glycine currents in the L274C GlyR is shown in Fig. 1B, and the inhibitory dose response for this experiment, averaged from four cells, is shown in Fig. 1C. The taurine IC50 and nH values for all tested mutant GlyRs are summarized in Table I. The maximum extent to which a saturating (50 mm) taurine concentration could inhibit currents activated by an EC50 glycine concentration is presented in Table I as Min Itau/Igly. The taurine IC50 was invariably around an order of magnitude lower than its EC50 in the same mutant GlyR. Steady-state Effects of MTSET—It has been demonstrated previously that MTSET covalently modifies all introduced cysteines from R271C to K276C (14Lynch J.W. Han N.L. Haddrill J. Pierce K.D. Schofield P.R. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 2589-2599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This modification increased the glycine EC50 of the P275C GlyR but decreased the glycine EC50 of the remaining mutant GlyRs, all without affecting the saturating glycine-gated current magnitude (14Lynch J.W. Han N.L. Haddrill J. Pierce K.D. Schofield P.R. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 2589-2599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 2A shows examples of currents activated by saturating concentrations of taurine and glycine in the R271C and L274C GlyRs both before and after a 1-min MTSET application. In these and all subsequent experiments, MTSET was applied at a concentration of 100 μm at the A272C, S273C, and L274C GlyRs and at 200 μm at the R271C, P275C, and K276C GlyRs. These concentrations were chosen to yield reaction time constants in an appropriate range (1–10 s) that was neither so rapid as to be influenced by the solution exchange rate nor so slow as to be influenced by receptor desensitization. In the experiments summarized in Fig. 2, MTSET was applied in the presence of a saturating (50 mm) concentration of taurine. MTSET had no significant effect on the magnitude of currents activated by a saturating glycine concentration in any of these mutant GlyRs, consistent with previous findings (14Lynch J.W. Han N.L. Haddrill J. Pierce K.D. Schofield P.R. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 2589-2599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, MTSET modification increased the peak magnitude of taurine-gated currents in the L274C mutant GlyR but not in the R271C GlyR (Fig. 2A). The effects of MTSET on the ratio of saturating taurine- to glycine-gated currents (Imaxtau/Imaxgly) were investigated in a similar manner for all mutant GlyRs, and averaged results are summarized in Fig. 2B. MTSET significantly increased this ratio in the A272C, S273C, and L274C GlyRs, significantly decreased it in the P275C GlyR, and had no effect on Imaxtau/Imaxgly in the R271C and K276C GlyRs. Because MTSET functionally modified glycine-gated currents in the R271C and K276C GlyRs, its lack of effect on taurine-gated currents appears to reveal a structural distinction between taurine- and glycine-gated currents. However, a direct comparison requires that MTSET be applied in the presence of a glycine concentration that activates a current similar in magnitude to that activated by a saturating taurine concentration in the same cell. Examples of this experiment carried out in the A272C, S273C, and P275C GlyRs are shown in Fig. 3A, and averaged results from all tested mutant GlyRs are summarized in Fig. 3B. Together, these results indicate that taurine- and glycine-gated currents were modified in a similar manner by MTSET in all mutant GlyRs. Therefore, the steady-state effect of MTSET does not depend on the agonist. In those mutants where MTSET increased Imaxtau/Imaxgly (i.e. A272C, S273C, and L274C), MTSET also significantly reduced the taurine EC50. Examples of taurine dose responses before and after a 1-min application of 100 μm MTSET for the L274C mutant GlyR are shown in Fig. 4A, and averaged results are shown in Fig. 4B. MTSET caused a similar increase in taurine sensitivity in the A272C and S273C GlyRs (Fig. 4C). Because the peak magnitude of taurine-gated currents in the P275C, K276C, and R271C GlyRs remained extremely low after MTSET modification, it was not possible to directly determine whether MTSET affected the taurine EC50 values. However, it was possible to measure the effects of MTSET modification on the potency of taurine inhibition of glycine-gated currents. Progressively increasing concentrations of taurine were applied to the P275C GlyR in the presence of an EC50 glycine concentration (Fig. 5A, upper panel). When this procedure was repeated following a 1-min application of 100 μm MTSET + 50 mm glycine, there was no apparent change in the taurine inhibitory potency (Fig. 5A, lower panel). Because MTSET causes a 4-fold increase in the glycine EC50 (14Lynch J.W. Han N.L. Haddrill J. Pierce K.D. Schofield P.R. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 2589-2599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it was necessary to increase the glycine concentration from 2 to 8 mm to maintain half-maximum current activation. The results indicate that MTSET modification had no effect on the taurine IC50 for the P275C GlyR (Fig. 5B). The mean taurine IC50 and nH values before and after MTSET modification are summarized in Table II. Similar experiments were carried out on the K276C and R271C GlyRs, and the results are also summarized in Table II. Together, they suggest that MTSET modification does not alter the affinity of these receptors for taurine.Table IIThe effect of MTSET on taurine IC50 values for the R271C, P275C, and K276C mutant GlyRsGlyRControlAfter MTSETnIC50nHIC50nHmmmmR271C0.59 ± 0.180.9 ± 0.10.47 ± 0.100.7 ± 0.34P275C1.46 ± 0.381.0 ± 0.21.04 ± 0.011.2 ± 0.34K276C0.59 ± 0.100.8 ± 0.20.62 ± 0.120.8 ± 0.34 Open table in a new tab The remainder of this study relies on the comparison of MTSET reaction rates in the glycine- and taurine-activated states. Such a comparison was not possible in the R271C and K276C GlyRs as MTSET did not modify currents induced by either saturating taurine or equivalent (EC5 to EC10) glycine concentrations. MTSET Reactivity Rates with A272C, S273C, L274C, and P275C—Because differences in MTSET reaction rate can be indicative of differences in receptor conformation, we compared the MTSET reaction rates in the taurine- and glycine-bound states in the A272C, S273C, L274C, and P275C mutant GlyRs. It is important to note that the MTSET reaction rate in the closed state is approximately an order of magnitude slower than it is in the presence of EC30 glycine in all mutant GlyRs tested here (10Armstrong N. Mayer M. Gouaux E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5736-5741Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). An example of an experiment on the L274C mutant GlyR is shown in Fig. 6A. Both panels in this figure were recorded from the same cell. In Fig. 6A, taurine was applied at a saturating concentration (50 mm), and MTSET was applied at 100 μm. The MTSET-induced current increase was adequately described by a single exponential with a time constant of 2.78 s. Currents recorded 2 min later confirm that covalent modification has taken place (Fig. 6A, upper panel). Following a 1-min exposure to 1 mm DTT, the experiment was repeated using a glycine concentration (100 μm) that activated a current of similar magnitude to that activated by saturating taurine (Fig. 6A, lower panel). MTSET modification of the glycine-gated current proceeded with a time constant of 2.66 s. The averaged time constants in the taurine- and glycine-activated states were 2.26 ± 0.34 s (n = 9 cells) and 2.06 ± 0.43 s (n = 7 cells), respectively. There was no significant difference between these values, indicating that the conformational change experienced by Cys-274 depends on the fraction of peak current activated, rather than the identity of the agonist. In the S273C GlyR, the MTSET reactivity rate was examined at the EC20 (200 μm) taurine concentration. This sub-saturating taurine concentration was necessary as higher taurine EC values would have resulted in current saturation prior to completion of the MTSET reaction, which in turn would have distorted the apparent reaction rate. A glycine concentration of 20 μm (EC10) was used to activate currents of similar magnitude in the same cell. Again, there was no significant difference in MTSET reactivity between the taurine- and glycine-activated states (Fig. 6B). The reaction rates of 100 μm MTSET with A272C and P275C were measured at saturating (50 mm) taurine concentrations and glycine concentrations of 200 (EC10) and 100 μm (EC10), respectively. The averaged MTSET reaction rates in the taurine- and glycine-bound states for all mutant GlyRs examined in this study are also shown in Fig. 6B. Together, the results indicate that the rate of the MTSET reaction with A272C, S273C, L274C, and P275C does not depend on the identity of the agonist. Two Models for Partial Agonism—Two sharply contrasting models have been developed to describe the activation of oligomeric proteins, the coupled Monod-Wyman-Changeux (MWC) model (34Changeux J.P. Edelstein S.J. Neuron. 1998; 21: 959-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) and the uncoupled or sequential Koshland-Nemethy-Filmer (KNF) model (35Koshland Jr., D.E. Nemethy G. Filmer D. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 365-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (2163) Google Scholar). In the simplest version of the MWC model, all the subunits change conformation simultaneously, and in consequence the receptor can exist in only the closed or entirely activated states. In contrast, the KNF model proposes that each subunit can independently adopt a specific conformation change depending on the number and species of bound agonist molecules, leading to a series of intermediate protein conformational states. The structural basis of partial agonism in the ionotropic glutamate receptor has been investigated using a combination of crystallographic and electrophysiological techniques (11Jin R. Banke T.G. Mayer M.L. Traynelis S.F. Gouaux E. Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 803-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). This study revealed that a series of partial agonists promoted a range of conformational changes at the ligand-binding site, with the magnitude of this structural change being directly correlated with the probability of entering higher subconductance states. Thus, increasing agonist efficacy was manifested by an increased ability to open the channel to its maximal extent. This is a classic KNF-type mechanism. Alternatively, partial agonism could also result from an MWC-type model whereby high and low efficacy agonists induce identical structural changes throughout the receptor. In such a mechanism, higher efficacy would be manifested by an increased ability to stabilize the open state. Because extended MWC models can explain many characteristics of LGIC behavior (34Changeux J.P. Edelstein S.J. Neuron. 1998; 21: 959-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), this model is the favored hypothesis for the present study. Taurine as a Low Efficacy Agonist—By using classical receptor theory (8Colquhoun D. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 924-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar), it can be shown that Fmax = E/(1 + E), where Fmax is the maximum fraction of receptors that can be activated by a saturating agonist concentration, and E is the equilibrium constant for gating (or efficacy). A combination of rapid agonist application techniques and equilibrium single channel kinetic analysis was used by Lewis et al. (12Lewis T.M. Schofield P.R. McClellan A.M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 549: 361-374Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar) to estimate E values of 16 and 3.4 for glycine and taurine, respectively, at the WT α GlyR. According to these figures, taurine should activate around 77% of the peak glycine current in the WT GlyR, although we find taurine to be a full agonist of the WT GlyR. As summarized in Table I, all mutant GlyRs examined in this study significantly reduced this percentage. The above equation indicates that variations in E have no measurable effect on peak current magnitude unless they occur within a limited range of around 0.1 to 10. This means that a moderate reduction may not significantly reduce the glycine Fmax, whereas any reduction in the E would yield a reduction in the Fmax for taurine. Thus, although the mutations examined in the present study reduced the Fmax of taurine relative to glycine, they did not necessarily exert a selective effect on taurine efficacy. The fact that mutations converted taurine into a partial agonist was convenient as it facilitated the comparison between the taurine- and glycine-activated states. For the purposes of analyzing the structural basis of partial agonism, it does not matter whether partial agonism was achieved by appropriate choice of agonist, receptor mutagenesis, or a combination of the two. Prior to the present study little, if any, experimental evidence was available concerning the structural basis of partial agonism in pentameric LGICs. A variety of biochemical and electrophysiological approaches have shown that the agonist-binding pocket of LGIC receptors is formed by six discontinuous domains, labeled A–F by Corringer et al. (28Corringer P.J. Le Novere N. Changeux J.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 431-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). The involvement of these domains in forming the pocket has been confirmed by the crystal structure of acetyl/choline binding protein (6Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. Schuurmans M. van Der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1564) Google Scholar). In the GlyR, taurine and glycine both bind in this cavity but appear to interact differently with at least one of the molecular groups lining its wall (29Schmieden V. Kuhse J. Betz H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2025-2032Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 30Schmieden V. Kuhse J. Betz H. Science. 1993; 262: 256-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 31Schmieden V. Betz H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 919-927PubMed Google Scholar, 32Rajendra S. Vandenberg R.J. Pierce K.D. Cunningham A.M. French P.W. Barry P.H. Schofield P.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2987-2998Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). However, even if the respective agonists induce different local structural changes at the binding site, this does not necessarily imply that they induce different global conformational changes (8Colquhoun D. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 924-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). Similarly, single channel kinetic analysis has not yet permitted an unequivocal resolution of this issue. In the WT α GlyR, the difference in E values between glycine and taurine was explained by a difference in the channel opening rates, with the closing rates being similar for both agonists (12Lewis T.M. Schofield P.R. McClellan A.M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 549: 361-374Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Although these results suggest that glycine and taurine differ in their abilities to stabilize the open state, they provide no information about the underlying structural changes. In addition, taurine and glycine have been shown to activate similar unitary conductance levels (12Lewis T.M. Schofield P.R. McClellan A.M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 549: 361-374Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Again, this does not necessarily imply that both agonists induce identical structural changes at the gate, because the conductance of the open pore may be limited by regions other than the gate (e.g. the M3-M4 domain (33Kelley S.P. Dunlop J.I. Kirkness E.F. Lambert J.J. Peters J.A. Nature. 2003; 424: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar)). Comparison of MTSET Reaction Rates—MTSET has no effect on the magnitude of current activated by a saturating glycine concentration (14Lynch J.W. Han N.L. Haddrill J. Pierce K.D. Schofield P.R. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 2589-2599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that it does not alter the GlyR single channel conductance or maximum open probability. In the A272C, S273C, and L274C GlyRs, MTSET increased Imaxtau/Imaxgly (Fig. 2B). It also reduced the EC50 values of glycine and taurine to a similar extent (Fig. 4B; see also Fig. 5 in Ref. 14Lynch J.W. Han N.L. Haddrill J. Pierce K.D. Schofield P.R. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 2589-2599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MTSET had exactly the opposite effects on the P275C GlyR. The reaction rates of MTSET with A272C, S273C, L274C, and P275C were not significantly different for saturating taurine-gated currents and partially activating glycine-gated currents, provided that the same current magnitude was activated in the same cell (Fig. 6B). To interpret this result, it is useful to consider the equation: I = n × i × Po, where I is the macroscopic current, n is the total number of channels per cell; i is the single channel conductance, and Po is the open probability. Because MTSET reaction rates were compared in the same cell, n was a controlled variable in our experiments. Furthermore, because the taurine and glycine single channel conductances are identical (e.g. Ref. 12Lewis T.M. Schofield P.R. McClellan A.M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 549: 361-374Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar), i is also constant. Indeed, it should be noted that full and partial agonists at all pentameric LGIC members examined to date activate identical unitary conductances. Thus, because the MTSET reaction rate is proportional to the initial value of I, it must in turn be proportional to Po. Therefore, the MTSET reaction rate simply reflects the fraction of channels that are open and not the number of occupied binding sites. This agrees with our recent observation that the MTSET reaction rate with S273C did not change significantly when the number of agonist-binding sites per GlyR was reduced from 5 to 3 (36Shan Q. Nevin S.T. Haddrill J.L. Lynch J.W. J. Neurochem. 2003; 86: 498-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Because the M2-M3 domains are positioned mid-way along the conformational “wave” that proceeds from the ligand-binding site to the channel gate (7Grosman C. Zhou M. Auerbach A. Nature. 2000; 403: 773-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), it must therefore be concluded that binding site information is integrated prior to reaching the M2-M3 domain. Hence, the ligand-induced inter-subunit cooperative interactions take place in the ligand-binding domain, in accordance with the MWC model of receptor activation (34Changeux J.P. Edelstein S.J. Neuron. 1998; 21: 959-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Mechanism of Taurine Inhibition—The taurine IC50 values were not affected by MTSET in the R271C, P275C, or K276C mutant GlyRs (Table II). Table I shows that taurine IC50 values are about 10 times lower than their corresponding EC50 values in those mutants where both can be measured. The latter observation is consistent with a model where first taurine binds with a high affinity (equal to the IC50 value) but is unable to activate the channel. At least one additional taurine must bind to a separate low affinity site (equal to the EC50 value) in order to open the channel. Because the homomeric GlyR is likely to contain five identical taurine-binding sites (6Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. Schuurmans M. van Der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1564) Google Scholar), this situation is most likely caused by negative cooperativity among agonist-binding sites. It is likely that the cysteine substitutions create or enhance this negative cooperativity. A high affinity for taurine inhibition would result if a single taurine molecule can prevent the channel opening efficaciously when the other binding sites are occupied by glycine. We propose that MTSET does not affect the affinity of the first taurine-binding reaction but increases the either the affinity of subsequent agonist binding steps or the receptor gating efficacy. This study compared the effects of MTSET on taurine- and glycine-gated currents. In the A272C, S273C, L274C, and P275C GlyRs, the MTSET reaction rate was a function of the degree of receptor activation. The conformation and accessibility of this domain thus reflect the channel open probability and convey no information about the identity or number of bound agonist molecules. Therefore, partial agonism in the GlyR is conferred by an MWC-like mechanism whereby partial and full agonists induce similar conformational changes, with the higher efficacy being due to an increased ability to stabilize the open state. This is at variance with the mechanism of partial agonism recently proposed for the glutamate receptor ion channel."
https://openalex.org/W2081079264,"BRCA2 is a breast cancer susceptibility gene. Germline mutations of BRCA2 account for about 10-30% of familial breast cancer cases. Consistent with its tumor-suppressor activity, BRCA2 plays an important role in DNA repair. To assess the susceptibility of carriers of mutant BRCA2 to tumorigenesis induced by DNA-damaging carcinogens, we generated a Brca2 knockout mouse strain and studied its susceptibility to chemically induced tumorigenesis. Similar to previously reported Brca2 knockout mice, our Brca2-/- embryos die at E8.5-9.5, while the Brca2+/- mice are tumor-free and fertile. Unexpectedly, Brca2+/- mice developed tumors slower than did their wild-type littermates when treated with a potent carcinogen 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA). In vitro experiments showed that Brca2+/- mouse cells and Capan-1 cells, a human pancreatic cancer cell line deficient of BRCA2, were more sensitive to DMBA-induced apoptosis, than were Brca2+/+ mouse cells and a derivative of Capan-1 cells that expressed exogenous wild-type BRCA2, respectively. Our results suggest that enhanced sensitivity of Brca2 mutant cells to DMBA-induced apoptosis at the dose of DMBA we used contributes to the delayed tumorigenesis of Brca2+/- animals. This suggestion may also provide a rational explanation for a previous unexpected finding that cigarette smoking appears to reduce the breast cancer risk of BRCA2 mutation carriers."

Patch-clamp analysis under cell-attached conditions indicated the presence of spontaneously active Na<sup>+</sup>-permeable cation channels. The channels displayed nonrectifying single channel conductance of 11 pS, substates, and an ∼3:1 Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> permeability-selectivity ratio. The Na<sup>+</sup>-permeable cation channels were inhibited by pertussis toxin and reactivated by G protein agonists. Cation channel activity was observed in quiescent cell-attached patches after vasopressin stimulation. The addition of protein kinase A and ATP to excised patches also induced Na<sup>+</sup> channel activity. Spontaneous and vasopressin-induced Na<sup>+</sup> channel activity were inhibited by extracellular amiloride. To begin assessing potential molecular candidates for this cation channel, both reverse transcription-PCR and immunocytochemical analyses were conducted in LLC-PK1 cells. Expression of porcine orthologs of the αENaC and ApxL genes were found in LLC-PK1 cells. The expression of both gene products was confirmed by immunocytochemical analysis. Although αENaC labeling was mostly intracellular, ApxL labeled to both the apical membrane and cytoplasmic compartments of subconfluent LLC-PK1 cells. Vasopressin stimulation had no effect on αENaC immunolabeling but modified the cellular distribution of ApxL, consistent with an increased membrane-associated ApxL. The data indicate that proximal tubular LLC-PK1 renal epithelial cells express amiloride-sensitive, Na<sup>+</sup>-permeable cation channels, which are regulated by the cAMP pathway, and G proteins. This channel activity may implicate previously reported epithelial channel proteins, although this will require further experimentation. The evidence provides new clues as to potentially relevant Na<sup>+</sup> transport mechanisms in the mammalian proximal nephron."
https://openalex.org/W2022251609,"The AB and GH regions of the α-chain are located in spatial proximity and contain a cluster of intermolecular contact residues of the sickle hemoglobin (HbS) fiber. We have examined the role of dynamics of AB/GH region on HbS polymerization through simultaneous replacement of non-contact Ala19 and Ala21 of the AB corner with more flexible Gly or rigid α-aminoisobutyric acid (Aib) residues. The polymerization behavior of HbS with Aib substitutions was similar to the native HbS. In contrast, Gly substitutions inhibited HbS polymerization. Molecular dynamics simulation studies of α-chains indicated that coordinated motion of AB and GH region residues present in native (Ala) as well as in Aib mutant was disrupted in the Gly mutant. The inhibitory effect due to Gly substitutions was further explored in triple mutants that included mutation of an inter-doublestrand contact (αAsn78 → His or Gln) at the EF corner. Although the inhibitory effect of Gly substitutions in the triple mutant was unaffected in the presence of αGln78, His at this site almost abrogated its inhibitory potential. The polymerization studies of point mutants (αGln78 → His) indicated that the inhibitory effect due to Gly substitutions in the triple mutant was synergistically compensated for by the polymerization-enhancing activity of His78. Similar synergistic coupling, between αHis78 and an intra-double-strand contact point (α16) mutation located in the AB region, was also observed. Thus, two conclusions are made: (i) Gly mutations at the AB corner inhibit HbS polymerization by perturbing the dynamics of the AB/GH region, and (ii) perturbations of AB region (through changes in dynamics of the AB/GH region or abolition of a specific fiber contact site) that influence HbS polymerization do so in concert with α78 site at the EF corner.

Biol. 1979; 130: 451-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) have led to a 14-stranded model of the fiber (26Cretegny I. Edelstein S.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 733-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 27Watowich S.J. Gross L.J. Josephs R. J. Struct. Biol. 1997; 111: 161-179Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These strands appear as seven double strands of the type found in HbS crystals, albeit with a slight twist caused by fiber packing. The models specify several amino acid residues from both α- and β-chains that participate in inter- or intra-double-strand contacts stabilizing the fiber structure. By and large, the fiber models agree with the solution polymerization experiments of mutant hemoglobins in that polymerization-sensitive mutations are usually located in fiber contact regions (27Watowich S.J. Gross L.J. Josephs R. J. Struct. Biol. 1997; 111: 161-179Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, the models present an approximate description of the HbS fiber that are limited to the identity of the contact residues and totally lack information on the hierarchy of interactions or additive or synergistic effect of two or more contact residues (4Harrington D.J. Adachi K. Royer Jr., W.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 398-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 26Cretegny I. Edelstein S.J. J. Mol.

Furthermore, the models project a static view of the contact sites and do not provide any clues about the influence of flexibility or dynamics of a given contact region on fiber assembly. Here we have examined the consequence of flexibility changes at the boundary of the A- and B-helix (AB region) of the α-chain on the polymerization of HbS. The linkage of interaction in the polymerization process, between the AB region and a remote site located at the EF corner of the α-chain, has also been explored. The AB region of the α-chain contains several contact sites of the fiber (α16, α20, and α23) and lies in spatial proximity to a cluster of GH corner residues that are implicated in fiber interactions (residues α113-α116). Besides, AB-GH corners of the α-chain engage in extensive inter-tetrameric interactions with AB-GH corners of the β-chain, yielding physiologically important intra-double-strand axial contacts of the fiber. Therefore, it is conceivable that even subtle alterations of the conformational dynamics generated through rational amino acid changes at non-contact sites at the AB or GH corners of α/β chains might influence the HbS polymerization by perturbing the inter-tetrameric interaction interface of the fiber. We have tested this surmise by replacing two Ala residues of the AB corner of the α-chain, Ala19 (AB1) and Ala21 (B2), with the relatively more flexible Gly residues or less flexible α-aminoisobutyric acid (Aib) residues (Fig. 1A). Aib (also called α-methylalanine), an analog of alanine, is a non-protein amino acid found in microbial peptides that form membrane channels. Aib exhibits higher helix-forming ability compared with Ala residues, which has the highest helical propensity among the 20 coded amino acids. Model studies on short peptides have shown that incorporation of one or more Aib residues significantly enhance the helical backbone structure (28Karle I.L. Acc. Chem. Res. 1999; 32: 693-701Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 29Balaram P. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1992; 2: 845-851Crossref Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The stabilizing effect of Aib emanates from the presence of an extra methyl group (relative to Ala) that restricts the peptide backbone torsional angles (ϕ, Ψ) to helical conformation. In fact, Gly → Ala substitutions also introduce a methyl group on Cα atom, and similar effects, albeit to a lesser extent than Aib, are realized due to Ala. Therefore, a hierarchy of conformational constraint is expected to be generated at the AB corner while traversing from Gly to Ala to Aib; the ensuing sequence of residues 18–22 at the AB corner (Fig. 1B) with Gly substitution (GGHGG) is likely to be potentially more flexible than the native sequence (GAHAG), which in turn, would be more flexible than the sequence generated by Aib replacements (GAibHAibG). We have earlier successfully employed a semi-synthetic reaction, namely, V8 protease-mediated coupling of α1–30 and α31–141 fragments to produce α141 (α-globin), for the construction of mutant α-subunits (23Roy R.P. Acharya A.S. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 231: 194-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 24Sivaram M.V. Sudha R. Roy R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18209-18215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). This strategy, although restrictive in nature, is especially suited for the incorporation of non-coded Aib residues and, in appropriate situations, could be effectively utilized for the introduction of 20 standard amino acids. Accordingly, we have constructed the aforementioned α-globin mutants containing Gly or Aib residues at 19 and 21 positions through the α-globin semisynthetic reaction. We have also taken advantage of the fortuitous co-presence of Gly residues at the 19/21 positions and a contact point mutation at position 78 (EF7, Asn → His or Gln) in the α-chain of the Hanuman langur (Presbytus entellus) hemoglobin (30Matsuda G. Maita T. Nakashima Y. Barnabas J. Ranjekar P.K. Gandhi N.S. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1973; 5: 423-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) to authenticate the role of conformational flexibility of the AB region as well as to explore linkage of interactions, if any, between these two remote regions of the tetramer. The ion-exchange resins (CM52 and DE52) were obtained from Whatman. The chemicals used in peptide synthesis were obtained from Nova Biochem. The hemoglobins from homozygous (SS) sickle cell patients and Hanuman langur (HL) were purified from their red cell lysates by DE52 and CM52 chromatography according to standard procedures. Heme-bound individual subunits of hemoglobins were obtained as hydroxymercuribenzoate derivatives following the procedure described by Bucci (31Bucci E. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 76: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The heme-free chains were obtained by acidacetone precipitation. Isolation and Characterization of HL α-Chain—Hemoglobin from the HL erythrocyte lysate was subjected to CM52 cation-exchange chromatography, and the elution profile was monitored at 540 nm. The chromatographic profile revealed the presence of two hemoglobin components that were present in the ratio of 45:55. This finding was unexpected in view of the fact that HL is known to contain a single hemoglobin. To locate the “variant” chain(s), the two hemoglobins (referred to as HL1 and HL2 in the order of elution) from CM52 chromatography were subjected to RP-HPLC for separation of their α and β globins. The RP-HPLC profile of the above HL hemoglobin samples (HL1 and HL2) displayed two globin peaks with 1:1 stoichiometry. The globin peaks from respective hemoglobins were collected and subjected to positive ion electro-spray mass spectrometry (ESMS). The experimental mass of the first peak in each case (15,896.44 Da and 15,896.39 Da, respectively) was similar and in agreement with the reported sequence (calculated mass, 15,895.24 Da) of langur β-globin. In contrast, the mass of the second peak of RP-HPLC, corresponding to the α-chain from the two samples, was different. Interestingly, the mass of this chain from HL2, 15,123.03 Da, fitted well to the calculated mass (15,121.36 Da) of the documented sequence of the HL α-chain (30Matsuda G. Maita T. Nakashima Y. Barnabas J. Ranjekar P.K. Gandhi N.S. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1973; 5: 423-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) that differs from human at only three sites (Gly19, Gly21, His78). The experimental mass of the α-chain from the HL1 sample was, however, less by about 10 Da (15,113.81). Thus the heterogeneity in the HL hemoglobin was localized in the α-chain. To define the region of sequence change(s), the two α-chains of HL were subjected to tryptic peptide mapping (Fig. 2). A comparison of the peptide maps of the two HL chains revealed altered retention times for two peptides namely, T8+9 (residues 61–90) and T9 (residues 62–90), suggesting that the origin of sequence variation in the two chains was the region encompassing residues 61–90. Further, the positions of the three peptides, T4 (17Himanen J.P. Mirza U.A. Chait B.T. Bookchin R.M. Manning J.M. J. Biol.

Methods Enzymol. 1981; 76: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), T8+9, and T9 were distinct between the human and the two HL chains. This result is consistent with the fact that the HL α-chain sequence is known to differ from human at positions 19, 21, and 78. For locating exactly the site of sequence changes in the variant chain, T8+9 and T9 peptide fragments were isolated by RP-HPLC and subjected to 25 cycles of Edman degradation. The sequence assignment of 22 and 25 residues in T9 and T8+9, respectively, were made unambiguously and were found to be identical to the human sequence, except at the 78th position. Although the 17th and 18th cycles of amino acid sequencing of T9 and T8+9 (corresponding to the 78th position of the α-chain) peptides derived from HL1 α-chain yielded a Gln residue, the same peptides of HL2 α-chain yielded His. The sequencing results were further confirmed by mass measurements. T8+9 fragment obtained from human sequence had a mass of 3124.89 Da, which was expected for the presence of Asn at 78th position (calculated mass, 3125.51). In the case of HL1α and HL2α, the masses of the T8+9 fragments were found to be 3139.22 and 3148.94 Da, respectively. These values fit the Asn → Gln or His substitutions in T8+9 fragment and are also in agreement with the mass of the corresponding intact α-chains. Thus, the presence of two kinds of α-chain in HL hemoglobin was unequivocally established. Although these chains show three sequence changes relative to the human α-chain (Gly19, Gly21, and His78/Gln78), they differ from each other only at a single residue at position 78 (His or Gln). Semi-synthesis of Mutant α-Chains—The complementary fragments of α-globin, α1–30 and α31–141, were obtained by subjecting the V8 protease digest of α-globin to Sephadex G50 chromatography (24Sivaram M.V. Sudha R. Roy R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18209-18215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The sequence comprising α1–30 with Gly or Aib residues at positions 19 and 21 was assembled by solid-phase peptide synthesis. The respective purified peptides were ligated with the complementary fragment (α31–141) derived from human or langur chains by V8 protease-mediated ligation reaction (23Roy R.P. Acharya A.S. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 231: 194-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 24Sivaram M.V. Sudha R. Roy R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18209-18215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Semi-synthetic mutant globins were purified by CM52 chromatography in the presence of 8 m urea as described previously (24Sivaram M.V. Sudha R. Roy R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18209-18215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). ESMS, tryptic peptide mapping, and amino acid sequencing were employed to establish the chemical identity of the mutant chains. Generation of Mutant HbS Tetramers—The heme-free mutant globins were reconstituted with βs-chain and heme to tetrameric mutant HbS through the “alloplex” route (32Yip Y.K. Waks M. Beychok S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 64-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and according to the protocol described by Sivaram et al. (24Sivaram M.V. Sudha R. Roy R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18209-18215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). HbS tetramers composed of heme-bound HL α-chain were prepared by incubating the α-chain (0.5 mm) with 1.2-fold molar excess of βs-chain (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 1mm dithiothreitol and 1 mm EDTA) at 4 °C for 24 h. The tetramers were obtained in pure form by CM52 chromatography. The purity was further established by analytical anion-exchange chromatography on a Mono Q HR 5/5 column using FPLC (AKTA, Amersham Biosciences). Circular Dichroism (CD) Spectroscopy—CD spectra of HbS constructs were recorded on a J710 spectropolarimeter using a 1-mm path-length cell. The respective buffer baselines were subtracted from the sample data, and the final spectrum was represented as mean residue ellipticity in degree/cm2/dmol units. Oxygen-affinity Measurements—Oxygen-affinity measurements were done on a Hemox analyzer (TCS Medical Products, New Hope, PA) in Bis-Tris buffer, pH 7.4. The value of partial oxygen pressure at 50% saturation (P50) and Hill coefficient (nH) was calculated from each dissociation curve. Measurements of Gelation Concentration (Csat)—The Csat was measured in the presence of 12 g/dl concentration of dextran (70 kDa) as described by Bookchin et al. (33Bookchin R.M. Balaz T. Wang Z. Joseph R. Lew V.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6689-6697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This quasi-physiological method has been amply demonstrated to produce the same information as that of standard Csat measurements but at a much-reduced hemoglobin concentration. HbS samples were taken in 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) and were allowed to polymerize in the presence of sodium dithionite at 37 °C. The concentration of HbS in soluble phase (Csat) was determined after centrifugation of the gelation mixture at room temperature. Molecular Dynamics (MD) Simulation—MD simulations on the α-chain of HbS and the mutants were carried out using the GROMACS suite of programs (34Lindahl E. Hess B. van der Spoel D. J. Mol. Model. 2001; 7: 306-317Crossref Google Scholar). The initial structure of the native protein was taken from the high-resolution x-ray crystal structure (4Harrington D.J. Adachi K. Royer Jr., W.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 398-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) of HbS (Protein Data Bank code 2HBS). The structures of the mutants were generated interactively using Insight II (Accelrys). The initial model structures were placed in a simulation box of size 42.8 × 31.5 × 42.7 Å3. The closest distance from any protein atom to the walls of the box was not less than 9 Å. The system was then solvated by adding a bath of simple point charge (35Berendsen H.J.C. Postma J.P.M. van Gunsteren W.F. Hermans J. Pullman B. Intermolecular Forces. Reidel, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1981: 331-342Google Scholar) waters in such a way that the density of the system was as close to 1 as possible. The α-chain of HbS including the heme has an equal number of negative and positive charges; hence, there was no need of adding counterions for ensuring charge neutrality. The system was first relaxed by energy minimization using the steepest descent algorithm (1000 steps). Subsequently, the added solvent around the protein was allowed to equilibrate by means of position-restrained MD for 25 ps and energy was minimized again with steepest descents (1000 steps). Constant-volume MD simulations were carried out for 2 ns at 300 K with periodic boundary conditions imposed. The bond lengths and bond angles of the protein were restrained around their equilibrium values. Rationale and Design of Study—The hemoglobin molecules in the crystal pack as two strands of HbS molecules. Hemoglobin tetramers in each strand are connected through a network of axial contacts (4Harrington D.J. Adachi K. Royer Jr., W.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 398-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). These contacts involve AB and GH regions of both the α- and β-chains that include αLys16, αHis20, αPro114, αAla115, αGlu116, βGly16, βLys17, βGlu22, βHis117, βPhe118, βGly119, and βGlu121. The presence of a large number of contacts at the interface between the two HbS molecules in each strand of the fiber raises the intriguing possibility that even subtle changes in the conformational dynamics generated because of the perturbation of non-contact residues around AB or GH regions of the chains might influence the polymerization process by interfering with inter-tetrameric interaction interface of the fiber. We chose sites Ala19 and Ala21 at the AB region of the α-chain to address the above issue based on the fact that these are not contact points themselves, but their replacements with Gly residues generate a sequence (18GGHGG22) that has the propensity to enhance the conformational flexibility of the AB region. Secondly, the readily available V8 protease-mediated α-globin semisynthetic procedure permits us to incorporate non-coded Aib residues that are expected to contrast the effects because of Gly residues and confer conformational rigidity to the AB region. Molecular Dynamics Simulations of the Mutant α-Chains—We carried out MD simulations studies on native (Ala) and mutant (Gly or Aib) α-chains to investigate the extent of dynamic perturbations in the mutant chains. The MD simulations for each mutant α-chain were checked for stability by monitoring several global properties like the radius of gyration, root mean squared deviation from the initial structure as well as the kinetic and potential energies. These parameters were found to stabilize after about 0.1 ns and, hence, data from 0.1–2 ns were used for all subsequent analyses. The root-mean-squared fluctuations (RMSF) of the Cα carbon atoms were calculated for the native (αA19-A21) and mutant chains (αA19G/A21G and αA19Aib/A21Aib) and is shown in Fig. 3A. The crystallographic temperature factors for the starting structure are also shown for comparison (Fig. 3B). Structural fluctuations in the mutant α-chains are, overall, similar to those of the native chain and follow the same trend as that seen in the experimental structure, suggesting that the introduction of mutations did not cause any large-scale deviation of the dynamical properties of the α-chain. The regions around residues 42 and 93 within the CD and FG corner, respectively, show the most fluctuations and a large difference between the native α-chain and its mutants. Both of these regions are particularly close to the highly mobile propionate side chains of the heme moiety. The RMSF difference in these regions also varies when different time windows of the simulation were used for calculation. This result indicates that, perhaps because of strong interaction with the highly mobile propionate side chains, the dynamics in these regions becomes much more complicated, and it was not possible to sample fully the total conformational space even during 2 ns of MD simulation, resulting in the observed difference in conformational fluctuation between the native α-chain and its mutants. The RMSF values in the AB corner regions rise to a local maximum in all three trajectories (Ala, Gly, Aib), indicating that this region is relatively mobile. Introduction of Ala → Gly and Ala → Aib mutations do cause small differences in RMSF values in this region. The GH corner region also lies in a local maximum of the RMSF plot. Although the average fluctuation in the GH region is comparable between the three trajectories, a significant difference between the fluctuation profile of the AB and the GH region is observed. This is clearly apparent in Fig. 4, where the frequency distribution of Cα-Cα distance between pairs of AB and GH corner residues is shown. The distribution of Cα-Cα distance between Ala13 and Glu116 is more variable in the Gly mutant and tends toward larger values. A similar trend is also apparent in the Cα-Cα distance distribution calculated for the Ala13-Leu113 pair. In the case of the Lys16-Glu116 and Lys16-Leu113 pairs, the effect is less pronounced for the Cα-Cα distances, but is clearly visible when one considers the side chain atoms NZ of Lys16 and CD of Glu116 (data not shown). We used dynamical cross-correlation maps to identify correlated movements of residues from MD simulati"
