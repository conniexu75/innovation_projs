https://openalex.org/W1572914688,"Human neutrophil cathepsin G and human skin mast cell chymase rapidly convert angiotensin I to angiotensin II with only minor cleavage elsewhere in the molecule. The rate of cleavage is consistent with a potential role for either or both of these enzymes in an alternate pathway for angiotensin II synthesis. Since neither enzyme in inhibited by captopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inactivator, it is possible that leukocyte and mast cell enzymes may play a significant role in the development of abnormally high local concentrations of angiotensin II, associated with various inflammatory processes."

This cardiac effect was neither inhibited by prior treatment of the sheep with a cyclooxygenase inhibitor nor associated with thromboxane B2 release into the coronary sinus. Intravenous FPL 55712 completely abolished the coronary vasoconstriction of leukotriene D4, but a significant reduction of regional wall shortening persisted."

https://openalex.org/W1552750745,"The major phenobarbital (PB)-induced cytochrome P-450 species present in livers of male Sprague-Dawley rats was resolved into two catalytically active heme-protein fractions on diethylaminoethyl cellulose. The two species, P-450 PB-4 (Mr = 49,000) and P-450 PB-5 (Mr = 51,000), were purified to homogeneity, and their chromatographic, spectral, catalytic, and structural properties were compared. P-450 BP-5 eluted earlier on hydroxylapatite and exhibited a more significant cholate-induced Type I spectral shift than P-450 BP-4. Very similar substrate specificity profiles were evident when the two isozymes were reconstituted with lipid, cytochrome P-450 reductase, and cytochrome b5 for oxidative metabolism of several xenobiotics, although P-450 PB-4 exhibited a higher specific catalytic activity (greater than or equal to 5-fold) with all substrates tested. Marked differences were also observed in the sensitivities of both isozymes to several P-450 inhibitors. In addition, P-450 PB-4 was greater than or equal to 10-fold more susceptible than P-450 PB-5 to suicide inactivation by two allyl-containing compounds, allylisopropylacetamide and secobarbital, providing a possible explanation of the previously observed partial inactivation by such compounds of phenobarbital-induced P-450 activity in liver microsomes. One-dimensional peptide maps of the two isoenzymes were highly similar. Antibody raised against purified Long Evans rat liver P-450b (Thomas, P. E., Korzeniowski, D., Ryan, D., and Levin, W. (1979) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 192, 524-532) cross-reacted with P-450 PB-4 and P-450 PB-5. NH2-terminal sequence analysis demonstrated that the first 31 residues of both PB-4 and PB-5 were identical. These sequences indicated that a highly hydrophobic terminal segment, observed previously for other P-450s as well, is followed by a cluster of basic residues, suggesting that the NH2-terminal portion of these P-450s might be involved in membrane anchoring. Although it is unclear whether P-450 PB-4 and P-450 PB-5 are separate gene products or are related by post-translational modifications, this present demonstration of closely related isozymic forms suggests the possible added complexity of microheterogeneity for this family of microsomal monooxygenases."
https://openalex.org/W1595306598,"Treatment of isolated rat skeletal muscles with the Ca2+ ionophores, A23187 or ionomycin, increased overall protein degradation 45-140%. Removal of extracellular Ca2+ reduced overall proteolysis and most of the stimulation by A23187. Treatment of the muscles with the sulfhydryl inhibitor, mersalyl, completely inactivated the Ca2+-activated protease without altering overall protein breakdown or the stimulation by A23187. This agent did not inhibit the lysosomal protease, cathepsin B, in the muscle; however, leupeptin and Ep-475, which inhibit this enzyme in intact cells, decreased the stimulation of proteolysis by Ca2+. Thus, this effect does not require the Ca2+-activated enzyme, but seems to involve lysosomal proteases. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and its precursor arachidonic acid, were previously shown to stimulate protein degradation in rat muscle through an effect on lysosomal function. We tested whether the enhancement of muscle proteolysis by Ca2+ ionophores may result from increased synthesis of PGE2. A23187 increased release of PGE2 and PGF2 alpha by the muscles 3-4-fold. High extracellular potassium also markedly promotes muscle proteolysis, apparently by increasing intracellular Ca2+, and this treatment also stimulates prostaglandin production. Indomethacin and aspirin, which inhibit the cyclooxygenase, and mepacrine, which inhibits the Ca2+-activated phospholipase A2, markedly reduced the increase in prostaglandin production. These agents also reduced the enhancement of protein degradation by Ca2+ or high K+. Thus, Ca2+ appears to promote protein breakdown by stimulating synthesis of PGE2, which in turn activates the lysosomal apparatus."

The calcium-sensitive photoprotein aequorin can be incorporated into isolated cells by hypo-osmotic treatment without altering the cell viability, permeability, or metabolism. Intracellular calcium activity (Ca12+) was monitored in a perfusion system. In monkey kidney cells (LLC-MK2), Ca12+ is approximately 57 nanomoles per liter. Changes in Ca12+ with time can also be followed: exposure of the cells to anaerobiosis or the calcium ionophore A23187 reversibly increases Ca12+. The method has also been successfully tested in rat hepatocytes."

https://openalex.org/W1488421511,"NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase, a component of the multisubstrate monooxygenase system of liver microsomes, is an unusual flavoprotein in that it contains both FMN and FAD. In recent studies in this laboratory, a procedure was devised for selective removal of FMN from the purified enzyme, thus leading to the identification of FMN and FAD as the prosthetic groups of high and low reduction potential, respectively, and to the assignment of known reduction potentials to the individual flavin half-reactions. In the present study, the reaction of NADPH with the reductase was examined under anaerobic conditions by stopped flow spectrophotometry. The results were shown to correspond to those predicted on the basis of a model for the rapid exchange of reducing equivalents between the two flavins, the distribution being governed at any time by the reduction potentials for the individual flavin half-reactions. The reaction is divided into three steps, as follows (a) In a rapid first phase with a first order rate constant of 28 s-1, a mixture of about 70% (FMNH2, FAD) and 30% disemiquinone (FMNH ., FADH .) is generated; (FMN, FADH2), the presumed transient intermediate in the reduction of the oxidized flavoprotein by NADPH, does not accumulate under these conditions. (b) In a second phase characterized by a first order rate constant of 5.4 s-1, a mixture of 65% (FMNH2, FADH2), 24% (FMNH2, FAD), and 11% (FMNH ., FADH .) is produced. (c) Regardless of the NADPH concentration employed, a third phase occurs with very slow changes leading to an equilibrium mixture of the nine oxidation-reduction states of the reductase. The absorption spectra for all possible oxidation-reduction states of the FMN moiety of the reductase as well as of the native reductase are presented."

https://openalex.org/W1608875611,"Having oxidized 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (dopa) with sodium periodate or mushroom tyrosinase in a pH range from 3.5 to 6.0, it has been possible to detect spectrophotometrically 4-(2-carboxy-2-aminoethyl)-1,2-benzoquinone with the amino group protonated (o-dopaquinone-H+), a postulated intermediate in the melanogenesis pathway. When the pH value was greater than 4, the final product obtained was 2-carboxy-2,3-dihydroindole-5,6-quinone (dopachrome); however, for pH values lower than 4, two different products were identified by means of cyclic voltammetry: 5-(2-carboxy-2-aminoethyl)-2-hydroxy-1,4-benzoquinone and dopachrome. These products appeared when oxidation was achieved with the enzyme as well as with periodate. This suggests that two chemical pathways can arise from alpha-dopaquinone-H+, whose relative importance is determined by the pH. The steps of these pathways would be dopa leads to o-dopaquinone-H+ leads to o-dopaquinone leads to leukodopachrome leads to dopachrome, for the first one, and dopa leads to o-dopaquinone-H+ leads to 2,4,5-trihydroxyphenylalanine leads to 5-(2-carboxy-2-aminoethyl)-2-hydroxy-1,4-benzoquinone very slowly leads to intermediate compound leads to dopachrome, for the second one. The stoichiometry for the conversion of dopaquinone-H+ into dopachrome for pH values greater than 4 followed equation of 2 o-dopaquinone-H+ leads to dopa + dopachrome. No participation of oxygen was detected in the conversion of leukodopachrome (2,3-dihydro-5,6-dihydroxyindole-2-carboxylate) into dopachrome."
https://openalex.org/W1552145880,"The possible role of the LC2 light chain of myosin in the contraction of vertebrate striated muscle has long been a subject of interest. This problem has been addressed in the present study in which the mechanical effects of partial removal of LC2 from skinned fibers of rabbit psoas muscle have been investigated. Each fiber was divided into three segments, thus allowing determinations of the LC2 content of the fiber 1) prior to extraction of the LC2 subunit, i.e. control, 2) following extraction of LC2, and 3) following readdition of LC2 to the fiber. Measurements of isometric tension and the maximum velocity of shortening were made in these fiber segments at each of the above stages of the extraction protocol. LC2 was partially removed from the fiber segments by treatment with a solution containing 20 mM EDTA, 50 mM KCl, 5 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, for 120 min at 30 degrees C, a procedure modified from Chantler and Szent-Gyorgyi (Chantler, P. D., and Szent-Gyorgyi, A. G. (1980) J. Mol. Biol. 138, 473-492). LC2 content was determined using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic techniques. The results indicate that removal of about one-third of the total LC2 within a fiber segment reduced Vmax by nearly 50%, with very little effect upon isometric tension. Readdition of LC2 to these fiber segments resulted in recovery of Vmax to near control values. These findings suggest that LC2 may modulate the kinetics of interaction of myosin with actin in mammalian skeletal muscle."

https://openalex.org/W2059911212,"The level of cytoplasmic calcium ions appears to be important in the control of murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cell differentiation. Our interest in this study focuses on the relationship between the regulation of calcium concentration and differentiation. We used the fluorescent membrane probe DiOC6 to examine the relationship between MEL cell mitochondria and changes in cytoplasmic calcium levels occurring at the initiation of commitment. Fluorescence microscopy reveals the selective association of DiOC6 with MEL cell mitochondria, where an enhanced fluorescence is observed. Treatment of cells with dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) or other inducers causes a decrease in mitochondria-associated fluorescence levels that occurs with the initiation of commitment. A decrease in DiOC6 fluorescence is caused by agents that reduce mitochondrial membrane potential, but is only slightly affected by agents that alter plasma membrane potential. Amiloride and EGTA, agents that prevent commitment and inhibit calcium uptake, also prevent the decrease in DiOC6 uptake caused by DMSO. The effect of DMSO on MEL cell mitochondria is mimicked by FCCP, a proton ionophore that dissipates mitochondrial membrane potential. FCCP also caused MEL cell mitochondria to release calcium into the cytoplasm. When MEL cells are treated with DMSO plus FCCP, commitment is initiated without the lag period observed when cells are treated with DMSO alone. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that mitochondrial transmembrane potential is important in the regulation of cytoplasmic calcium levels at the time of commitment of MEL cells to terminal differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1481936182,"Clusters of mouse PF-HR9 endoderm cells derived from teratocarcinoma PCC4-F cells were incubated with [3H]proline and [35S]methionine. The synthesis of pro alpha 1 IV and pro alpha 2 IV chains and their association into triple helically folded disulfide-linked molecules were followed. Short incubations and incubations with pactamycin showed that approximately 30,000 molecular weight collagenase-resistant peptides, which are destroyed by pepsin, form the carboxyl end of the pro alpha IV chains. While disulfide links bridge parts of individual peptides, the carboxyl peptides of the three chains of a molecule are not disulfide linked to each other. We propose that these peptides form the knob protrusion seen in electron micrographs of rotary shadowed procollagen IV molecules. The implications of these findings, especially for the relatively slow assembly of procollagen IV, are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1526170620,"The effect of intravesicular and extravesicular calcium concentration on the passive efflux from sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) vesicles isolated from cardiac and skeletal muscle was determined by measuring net efflux of calcium after stopping pump-mediated fluxes. The apparent permeability, calculated as the passive efflux divided by the total intravesicular calcium, depended on calcium load. This dependence of the apparent permeability on calcium load could be explained by the presence of intravesicular calcium-binding sites with a dissociation constant less than 10(-3) M. When the intravesicular bound calcium was taken into account, passive calcium efflux was found to be linearly related to the difference in calcium concentration across the SR membrane. Thus the permeability of the SR membrane is independent of intravesicular and extravesicular calcium concentration in the ranges investigated. The average first order rate constant for passive calcium efflux for six preparations was 0.8 +/- 0.2 min-1 for skeletal and 0.7 +/- 0.1 min-1 for cardiac SR. The amount of intravesicular bound calcium for the same preparations was 33 +/- 6 nmol mg-1 for skeletal and 13 +/- 2 nmol mg-1 for cardiac SR. The first order rate constants were unaffected by Mg concentration between 0.1 +/- 15.1 mM and by the presence of an ATP-regenerating system. The results suggest that some minimal calcium load may be required in order to observe a substantial passive calcium efflux, the passive calcium efflux is not carrier mediated, and passive calcium efflux is not a likely route of calcium release during excitation-contraction coupling."
https://openalex.org/W156089345,"Oxidative degradation of protoheme to biliverdin IXa catalyzed by the microsomal heme oxygenase system proceeds in the following sequence: protoheme, a-hydroxyheme, the 688-nm substance, a biliverdin-iron complex, and biliverdin. In the heme oxygenase reaction, the a-methene carbon of heme is liberated as carbon monoxide. The 688-nm substance, a newly found intermediate (Yoshida, T., Noguchi, M., and Kikuchi G. (1980) J. Biochem (Tokyo) 88, 557-563), has an extremely high affinity for carbon monoxide and, therefore, when the heme-heme oxygenase complex was incubated with the NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase system under a gas mixture of air and CO at a volumetric ratio of 5:1, about 80% of the heme was found to stay at the level of the CO-reduced form of the 688-nm substance. Taking advantage of these properties of the 688-nm substance, an attempt was made to determine whether carbon monoxide is liberated before or after the step of the 688-nm substance, by using 14C-labeled heme synthesued from [5-‘4C]G-aminolevulinic acid. The complex of 14C-heme and heme oxygenase was incubated with the NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase system in either air or a gas mixture of air and CO, and the content of 14C0 in the gas phase was analyzed by means of converting 14C0 into 14C02 by oxidation. In either reaction system, practically equal amounts of 14C02 were obtained; the radioactivities recovered in COz were 11 to 12% of the original radioactivity of 14C-heme used. The values of 11 to 12% are very close to the theoretical value of 12.5% (or one-eighth) which is expected to be recovered in C 0 2 when all the I4C-heme was completely degraded to biliverdin. These findings clearly indicate that carbon monoxide is liberated at the step of the formation of 688-nm substance from a-hydroxyheme and, hence, the 688-nm substance evidently lacks the a-methene carbon."

The purified preparation behaved homogeneously on gel filtration on Sephadex G-150 in aqueous Triton X-100 and on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, with an apparent molecular weight of about 55,000. The enzyme requires Mn2+, and only UDP-GalNAc served as a sugar donor. Apomucin, A1 protein, kappa-casein, apofetuin, and apoantifreeze glycoproteins served as acceptors, but the rate and amount of the transfer varied considerably from one acceptor to another. The transfer reaction terminated at the level of glycosylation of from only a few to at most about 40% of the serine plus threonine residues from which mucin-type oligosaccharides had been removed. This indicates that the transferase requires a certain conformation surrounding the acceptor site, but suggests also that a special mechanism may be functioning in vivo for frequent glycosylation of the abundant serine plus threonine residues of mucins. Lacto-N-fucopentaose I, ceramide di- and trihexosides, and globoside were not acceptors."
https://openalex.org/W2053834670,"alpha-Difluoromethylornithine is an enzyme-activated irreversible inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase that forms a covalent bond with the enzyme. When alpha-[5-14C]difluoromethylornithine was administered to androgen-treated mice, only ornithine decarboxylase became labeled. Autoradiographic examination of kidney, liver, and brain indicated much more extensive incorporation of labeled difluoromethylornithine into kidney protein than into the protein of the other tissues. Such incorporation was greatly reduced by prior treatment of the mice with cycloheximide. These results correlate with the presence of ornithine decarboxylase activity which is much higher in the kidney than in the other tissues and is lost rapidly when protein synthesis is inhibited. The binding of this drug in vivo, therefore, is useful for determining the distribution of ornithine decarboxylase. The enzyme was predominantly located in the proximal tubule cells of the kidney in androgen-treated mice."
https://openalex.org/W1562733945,"The retinal chromophore of bacteriorhodopsin is attached as a Schiff's base with the epsilon-amino group of a lysine residue. The site of attachment has now been investigated by the use of resonance Raman spectroscopy which has previously been shown to be sensitive to 15N isotope substitution at the Schiff's base. Bacteriorhodopsin samples obtained from bacteria grown in a medium containing either [epsilon-14N]- or [epsilon-15N]lysine were cleaved with chymotrypsin to give, in each case, the two fragments C-1 (amino acids 72-248) and C-2 (amino acids 1-71). The fragments were recombined in different combinations into lipid/detergent mixtures and retinal was added to regenerate the chromophore. Resonance Raman spectroscopy showed that, in both the light-adapted (BR 570) and the M 412 intermediate forms, the chromophore is attached to the large C-1 fragment. This result eliminates Lys-41 as the attachment site in these forms of bacteriorhodopsin. Together with the accompanying report, which demonstrates that the epsilon-amino group in Lys-41 is not required for regeneration of the native chromophore or for proton translocation, these results provide strong evidence that the chromophore remains attached as a Schiff's base to Lys-216 during the entire photocycle."
https://openalex.org/W1519378106,"Our previous work showed that treatment of chick embryo cartilage proteoglycan (PG-H) with chondroitinase-AC II and keratanase yielded a protein-rich core fraction having enzymatically modified linkage oligosaccharides. The core sample has now been analyzed by tryptic peptide mapping, in which the isolated core sample contained in a single Coomassie blue-staining band from a dried slab gel is radioiodinated and treated with trypsin, and the resultant tryptic peptides are displayed two-dimensionally on a silica gel thin layer plate. The map thus obtained exhibited 22 major peptide spots, the resolution and location of which were reproducible. In order to identify regions of the core polypeptide from which the tryptic peptides are derived, PG-H was cleaved with clostripain under conditions that yield a hyaluronic acid-binding fragment with an apparent Mr = 150,000 and chondroitin sulfate-peptide clusters of smaller molecular sizes. Although the peptide maps of the two size classes of clostripain fragments differed significantly from each other, the patterns of spots, as a whole, were extensively similar to those observed with the intact core molecule. These results have provided additional evidence that PG-H has a single, nonvariable core protein structure. In addition, the technique used here will provide a versatile method for the identification of genetic types in this increasingly complex family of matrix macromolecules."

In some cases, small amounts of 12-hydroxy-5,8,10,14-icosatetraenoic acid (12h-20:4) were also detected. The products were all identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry after purification by normal phase and argentation high pressure liquid chromatography. Both 11h-20:4 and 15h-20:4 appeared to be formed by prostaglandin endoperoxide synthetase rather than by lipoxygenases, since their formation was inhibited by indomethacin but not by nordihydroguaiaretic acid. The formation of 12h-20:4, on the other hand, was stimulated by indomethacin, probably due to increased substrate availability. The formation of hydroxyicosatetraenoic acids was markedly stimulated by adrenaline. Substantial amounts of 6,15-dioxoPGF1 alpha were formed from arachidonic acid by particulate fractions from fetal calf blood vessels, especially in the presence of relatively high substrate concentrations. The formation of this product was stimulated by methemoglobin and inhibited by adrenaline, glutathione, and tryptophan. It would appear that particulate fractions from fetal calf aorta convert arachidonic acid to 15-hydroperoxyPGI2, which can either be reduced in the presence of various cofactors to form PGI2 or dehydrated to give 15-oxoPGI2. The formation of hydroperoxides from arachidonic acid could be an important factor in regulating PGI2 synthesis in aorta, since PGI2 synthetase is strongly inhibited by such intermediates."

https://openalex.org/W1565212751,"RNA sequencing methods have been used to determine sequences at the 3' ends of the small subunit RNAs from Euglena gracilis cytoplasmic and chloroplast ribosomes. The cytoplasmic rRNA sequence, AUCAU psi GOH, has features typical of eukaryotic 18 S rRNAs. The sequence at the 3' terminus of the chloroplast 17 S rRNA, AACAACUCCCOH, differs in several positions from nucleotides conserved in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic small subunit rRNAs, but it does terminate with a pyrimidine tract. Like prokaryotic ribosomes, the chloroplast ribosome displays highly specific binding to purine-rich oligonucleotides. The 30 S subunits select from a random mixture of oligonucleotides only those that contain the sequence GGGAG, which is complementary to the 3' end of 17 S rRNA. The 68S chloroplast ribosome has been shown to be a substrate in vitro for colicin E3. Colicin E3 introduces a cleavage at a position in the chloroplast 17 S rRNA that corresponds exactly to that hydrolyzed in Escherichia coli S rRNA. These results suggest that the 3'-terminal region of 17 S rRNA has an arrangement in the 68 S chloroplast ribosome that may be equivalent to that of the prokaryotic ribosome, with the 3' end exposed in the 30 S subunit for interactions with complementary RNA sequences."
https://openalex.org/W1569992685,"Previous studies have established that glucose deprivation of murine cells suppresses the synthesis of an Mr = 85,000 polypeptide. A protein of approximately the same molecular weight has been found to be associated with the transforming protein of Rous sarcoma virus, pp60src. The present study compares the Mr = 85,000 glucose-regulated protein with the pp60src-associated protein. By the criteria of mobility in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels and one-dimensional partial proteolytic peptide mapping the two proteins appear to be identical. It has previously been shown that the pp60src-associated protein is also identical with one of several proteins whose synthesis is induced after growth of cells at elevated temperatures or in the presence of arsenite and canavanine. Considering that it is involved in a number of complex response patterns, the name syndromin is proposed for this protein. These findings open the possibility of a fundamental interrelationship among the heat shock effect, regulation of protein synthesis by glucose deprivation, and oncogenic transformation by Rous sarcoma virus."
https://openalex.org/W1680420724,"The transport of L-alanine, L-serine, and L-cysteine has been studied in skin-derived diploid human fibroblasts in culture. Competition analysis, mathematical discrimination by nonlinear regression, and conditions varying the relative contribution of the various mediations have been used to characterize the systems engaged in the inward transport of these amino acids. All the adopted criteria yielded results showing that L-alanine, L-serine, and L-cysteine enter the cell by two Na+-dependent systems, System A and System ASC, and by a Na+-independent route, whose major component has been identified as System L. The apparent affinity of L-alanine, L-serine, and L-cysteine for the putative carrier was higher for System ASC than for System A. The transport Vmax for System A increased in response to cell starvation; after 12 h, its values were similar or higher than those exhibited by System ASC. At amino acid concentrations approaching those present in human plasma, System ASC appeared to be the primary mediation for the inward transport of L-alanine, L-serine, and L-cysteine in human fibroblasts. The contribution of System A was negligible in nonstarved cells and became appreciable under conditions of cell starvation. The Na+-independent System L made no substantial contribution to the uptake of L-alanine and L-serine and accounted for approximately one-fourth of the total uptake of L-cysteine."

However, females exhibited the higher activity more frequently than males.

Immunological and catalytic criteria indicate that the change in activity is associated with an increase in the amount of enzyme in the diabetic. Apparent rates of degradation were determined for isolated glycogen synthase and phosphorylase from the livers of 2-, 5-, and 8-day diabetic, insulin-treated diabetic and normal rats using the double isotope ([3H]leucine and [14C]leucine) labeling method (Arias, I. M., Doyle, D., and Schimke, R. T. (1969) J. Biol. Chem. 244, 3303-3315). Relative rates of enzyme synthesis and degradation were determined by comparing the 3H incorporation and 3H/14C ratios of the isolated enzymes to the isotope labeling of a liver fraction representing the average of liver proteins. Glycogen synthase showed a gradual increase in the rate of degradation through the course of diabetes with an average relative rate of degradation in the 8-day diabetic 1.8 times greater than the normal. The relative rate of synthesis for glycogen synthase in the diabetic was 2.2- to 2.5-fold greater than the normal. Phosphorylase from 5- and 8-day diabetic rats had relative rates of degradation 4.0-5.3 times greater than enzyme from the normal. In the diabetic, the rate of degradation of phosphorylase was greater than for synthase while the opposite was observed in the normal rat. The relative rate of synthesis for phosphorylase from diabetic rats was approximately 4.5-fold greater than normal. The increased concentration of glycogen synthase in the diabetic liver is because of an increased rate of synthesis and not a decreased rate of enzyme degradation."

Glycoproteins coisolated with ligatin from embryonic chicken neural retina and radiolabeled with 32P are retained by an affinity column containing covalently bound retinal ligatin. Elution is achieved preferentially by α-glucose 1-phosphate and, to a limited extent, by mannose 6-phosphate. Treatment with endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H prevents the proteins from binding to the column and results in the release of high-mannose-type oligosaccharides containing 32P. The simplest of these oligosaccharides is unaffected by alkaline phosphatase unless the treatment is preceded by mild acid hydrolysis. Enzymatic and chemical analyses suggest that the phosphate is present in phosphodiester bonds linking penultimate mannose residues to terminal glucose residues."
https://openalex.org/W1573691051,"Commercial laboratory rat chow was found to contain 8.3 micrograms/g of dolichol and 2.1 micrograms/g of polyprenol; each was 14-18 isoprenes in length. The chain length and relative concentration of rat fecal dolichol and polyprenol were approximately the same as in chow, indicating that there was no preferential absorption of a particular chain length or a particular class of prenols. To quantitate the absorption of these compounds, rats were intubated with either [3H]dolichol or [3H]polyprenol or, as a control, [3H]cholesterol. After 30 h, the amount of radioactivity accumulated in the liver of the [3H]cholesterol-fed rat averaged 6% of the total administered. In contrast, the amount of radioactivity present in the livers of the [3H]dolichol- or [3H]polyprenol-fed rats was 0.05% of the total. From these data the maximum hepatic accumulation of the dietary prenols was calculated to be 0.06 micrograms/30 h. When compared with the values obtained for hepatic de novo synthesis (Adair, W. L., Jr., and Keller, R. K. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 8990-8996), we conclude that the contributions of the diet to the liver dolichol pool is negligible."
https://openalex.org/W1546148906,"The role of histidine (HC3) 146 beta in the previously established pH-dependent properties of the R state of human hemoglobin has been investigated. The rate constants for the dissociation and combination of the fourth carbon monoxide molecule, l4 and l'4, have been determined as a function of pH for hemoglobin A and des-(His 146 beta) hemoglobin A. From these kinetic parameters, the value of L4, the affinity constant for the 4th carbon monoxide molecules, has been calculated according to the equation L4 = l'4/l4. In addition, the effect of removal of histidine 146 beta or its replacement by arginine (hemoglobin Cochin-Port Royal) on k4, the rate of oxygen dissociation from fully liganded hemoglobin, has been determined as a function of pH. Removal of histidine 146 beta reduces the pH dependence of L4 by 47%. At the same time, it produces a similar, 45%, reduction in the pH dependence of kr. Replacement of histidine 146 beta by arginine reduces the pH dependence of k4 by 23% and that of l'4 by about 30%. These chemical modifications cause reductions in the R state Bohr effect which are remarkably similar in magnitude to the reduction which they produce in the overall Bohr effect. These results indicate that histidine 146 beta controls a major fraction of the R state Bohr effect as well as being a major participant in the overall and T state Bohr effects."

https://openalex.org/W1598898722,"The addition of micromolar Ca2+ in the presence of ATP (10 microM) to rat liver microsomes stimulates phospholipid methylation and the formation of fatty acid methyl esters. Our data indicate that calmodulin mediates the effect of Ca2+ on both phospholipid and fatty acid methylation. This evidence includes: 1) chlorpromazine, an inhibitor of Ca2+ effects mediated through calmodulin, prevented the activation by Ca2+ plus ATP of the methylation reactions; 2) isolation of the microsomes in the presence of ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (5 mM), to remove endogenous calmodulin also prevented Ca2+ plus ATP stimulation of both phospholipid and fatty acid methylation; 3) the addition of exogenous calmodulin to microsomes isolated in the presence of 5 mM ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid restored Ca3+ plus ATP stimulation of both classes of lipids: and 4) pre-incubation of liver microsomes with an antiserum against calmodulin prevented the activation of lipid methylation by Ca2+ plus ATP."
https://openalex.org/W1490231360,"Specifically 14C-labeled palmitic acids were perfused through livers and incubated with slices of kidneys from rats in diabetic ketosis. The distribution of 14C in the hydroxybutyric acid formed was determined. In liver, the ratio of incorporation of 14C from [13-14C]palmitic acid into carbon 1 to carbon 3 of the hydroxybutyric acid was the same as the ratio in carbon 2 to carbon 4 from [6-14C]palmitic acid. In kidney, the carbon 1-to-carbon 3 ratio was more than twice the carbon 2-to-carbon 4 ratio. In both tissues, 14C from [16-14C] palmitic acid was preferentially incorporated into carbon 4 compared to carbon 2 of the hydroxybutyric acid, but more so in liver than kidney. These results mean that in liver, the sole pathway of acetoacetate formation is via hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA, while in kidney it is not. Rather in kidney, acetoacetyl-CoA is converted to acetoacetate to a large extent by direct deacylation, presumably via a transferase- and/or deacylase-catalyzed reaction. In liver, most of the palmitic acid utilized is converted to acetoacetate while in kidney it is not. We previously estimated that, as a minimum, 11% of the hydroxybutyric acid excreted by the rat in diabetic ketosis is formed without hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA as an intermediate. The kidney appears to be the source of this hydroxybutyric acid if the pathways operative in these tissues in vitro are those that also operate in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1507400693,"The mixed disulfide derivative of fully reduced neochymotrypsinogen was refolded at pH 9.2 and 4 degrees C with 4 mM cysteine as the disulfide interchange catalyst. The yield of regenerated neochymotrypsinogen was 25%; the corresponding yield of refolded chymotrypsinogen was 50%. The refolded neochymotrypsinogen exhibited the characteristics of the native molecule as determined from polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and the enzymatic properties of the activated zymogen. The rate of refolding of neochymotrypsinogen was approximately the same as that found for chymotrypsinogen. These studies show that two separate fully reduced polypeptide chains were capable of refolding, associating with one another, and regenerating a native structure with full biological activity."

https://openalex.org/W1526154795,"A method has been developed for estimating in the intact cell the contribution of deacylation of acetoacetyl-CoA to the formation of acetoacetate relative to acetoacetate's formation via hydroxymethylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA. Estimates depend upon the fraction of the terminal four carbons of an even carbon-containing fatty acid that are converted to acetoacetate without prior conversion to acetyl-CoA, since in the formation of acetoacetate via HMG-CoA the omega-2 and omega-3 carbons of the fatty acid are converted to acetyl-CoA. Incorporation of 14C from [16-14C]palmitic acid into carbon 2 relative to carbon 4 of acetoacetate is used as the measure of the formation of the acetoacetate from the omega and omega-1 carbons of the fatty acid without acetyl-CoA as an intermediate. Incorporation of 14C from [13-14C]palmitic acid into carbon 1 relative to carbon 3 of acetoacetate is the measure of the formation of acetoacetate from the omega-2 and omega-3 carbons without acetyl-CoA as an intermediate. Comparison of these incorporations is made with incorporation into the carbons of acetoacetate of 14C from palmitic acid labeled with 14C in any of its first 12 carbons since such incorporation must proceed via acetyl-CoA as an intermediate. In an application of this approach, the specifically 14C-labeled palmitic acids were injected into rats in diabetic ketosis. Hydroxybutyric acid that each rat excreted was isolated and degraded. From the ratios of incorporation into the carbons of the hydroxybutyrates, as a minimum, 11% of the total quantity of hydroxybutyrate excreted by the rats was formed from acetoacetyl-CoA without HMG-CoA as an intermediate."
https://openalex.org/W1572672774,"We have defined the predominant site of p-nitrophenyl acetate reaction with hemoglobin. The site is involved with, at least, two modes of action: the imidazole catalysis of His beta 2 and the irreversible covalent acetylation of Lys beta 82. The effect of competitive inhibition of the reaction by 2,3-diphosphoglyceric acid, the dependence of the reaction rate on the protein conformation, hemoglobin mutants, and the diethylpyrocarbonate are consistent with the assignment of the active site. In addition, the results point to small conformational differences in the NH-terminal regions of the beta chains between Hb S and Hb A."
https://openalex.org/W1549844819,"Three genes (mglA, mglB, and mglC) required for active transport of substrate by the methylgalactoside permease were identified in a hybrid ColE1-DNA plasmid isolated from a clone (pLC3-14) of the Clarke-Carbon bank of Escherichia coli genes. A 4.6-kilobase DNA fragment obtained from pLC3-14 was cloned into the plasmid vector pBR322. The presence of the three mgl genes in the resultant plasmid, pMG3, was verified by genetic complementation and biochemical analysis of mgl mutants transformed with pMG3 DNA. Derivatives of pMG3 containing deletions in each mgl gene were constructed; restriction endonuclease mapping and functional analysis of these plasmids allowed us to physically locate the mgl genes within the inserted plasmid DNA and also to identify a heretofore unknown protein component of the transport system. Expression of these plasmids in vivo resulted in the specific synthesis of three major proteins of apparent molecular weight of 19,000, 36,000, and 52,000. The 36,000-dalton protein is the galactose-binding protein previously identified as the mglB product. The 19,000-dalton protein maybe the product of mglD, a regulatory gene mapping outside of the mgl gene cluster. The 52,000-dalton protein is a new permease component which we have identified here as the mglA product based on the observation that pMG6, a plasmid with a 0.6-kilobase mglA deletion, failed to encode for this protein but produced a truncated polypeptide showing a reduction in molecular weight comparable to the extent of the deletion. In bacteria bearing an mglA+, B-, C+ plasmid (Pmg4), the 52,000-dalton protein is located to a large extent (73%) in the membrane fraction."
https://openalex.org/W1565582000,"During the hydrolysis of MgATP by myosin, there is an extensive exchange of oxygen between water and the terminal phosphate group of bound nucleotide, which results from a repeated cycle of hydrolytic cleavage and its reversal. An analysis of the distribution of [18O]Pi species from the hydrolysis of [gamma-18O]ATP gives an estimate for the apparent rate constant [k-3(app)] of reverse cleavage, which is the rate-limiting step of the exchange cycle. We have performed this kind of analysis with two different forms of modified myosin, containing either N-ethylmaleimide at the sulfhydryl 1 group or trinitrophenyl at the reactive lysine residue. Although these modifications of the protein are chemically different, and the sulfhydryl 1 group and the reactive lysine residue are far apart in the primary chain of the myosin head, the two modifications caused a similar marked inhibition of oxygen exchange. This effect resulted from: 1) a decrease in the time available for the exchange cycle due to a 3-10-fold increase in the turnover rate of hydrolysis and 2) a reduction in k-3 (app) from 2-5 s-1 to 0.2-0.5 s-1. It is proposed that modifications of this type influence enzymatic activity by altering the course of reaction-linked conformational changes, i.e. those changes in protein structure that are coupled to the catalytic mechanism but are not part of the substrate-binding site proper. It is also suggested that certain naturally occurring protein modifications, e.g. methylation of histidine or lysine residues, could regulate function by operation of this mechanism."
