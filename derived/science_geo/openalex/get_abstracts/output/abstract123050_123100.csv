https://openalex.org/W2066888615,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which acts via members of a family of endothelial-specific receptor tyrosine kinases, is the only factor that has been shown definitively to play a role in the formation of the embryonic vasculature. Only one other family of receptor tyrosine kinases, comprising TIE1 and TIE2, is largely endothelial cell specific. We have recently cloned a ligand for TIE2, termed Angiopoietin-1. Here we show that mice engineered to lack Angiopoietin-1 display angiogenic deficits reminiscent of those previously seen in mice lacking TIE2, demonstrating that Angiopoietin-1 is a primary physiologic ligand for TIE2 and that it has critical in vivo angiogenic actions that are distinct from VEGF and that are not reflected in the classic in vitro assays used to characterize VEGF. Angiopoietin-1 seems to play a crucial role in mediating reciprocal interactions between the endothelium and surrounding matrix and mesenchyme."
https://openalex.org/W2034580062,"Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascades are activated in response to various extracellular stimuli, including growth factors and environmental stresses. A MAP kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK), termed ASK1, was identified that activated two different subgroups of MAP kinase kinases (MAPKK), SEK1 (or MKK4) and MKK3/MAPKK6 (or MKK6), which in turn activated stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK, also known as JNK; c-Jun amino-terminal kinase) and p38 subgroups of MAP kinases, respectively. Overexpression of ASK1 induced apoptotic cell death, and ASK1 was activated in cells treated with tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Moreover, TNF-α-induced apoptosis was inhibited by a catalytically inactive form of ASK1. ASK1 may be a key element in the mechanism of stress- and cytokine-induced apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W1970614272,"TIE2 is a receptor-like tyrosine kinase expressed almost exclusively in endothelial cells and early hemopoietic cells and required for the normal development of vascular structures during embryogenesis. We report the identification of a secreted ligand for TIE2, termed Angiopoietin-1, using a novel expression cloning technique that involves intracellular trapping and detection of the ligand in COS cells. The structure of Angiopoietin-1 differs from that of known angiogenic factors or other ligands for receptor tyrosine kinases. Although Angiopoietin-1 binds and induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of TIE2, it does not directly promote the growth of cultured endothelial cells. However, its expression in close proximity with developing blood vessels implicates Angiopoietin-1 in endothelial developmental processes."
https://openalex.org/W1988594478,"The oriented peptide library technique was used to investigate the peptide-binding specificities of nine PDZ domains. Each PDZ domain selected peptides with hydrophobic residues at the carboxyl terminus. Individual PDZ domains selected unique optimal motifs defined primarily by the carboxyl terminal three to seven residues of the peptides. One family of PDZ domains, including those of the Discs Large protein, selected peptides with the consensus motif Glu-(Ser/Thr)-Xxx-(Val/Ile) (where Xxx represents any amino acid) at the carboxyl terminus. In contrast, another family of PDZ domains, including those of LIN-2, p55, and Tiam-1, selected peptides with hydrophobic or aromatic side chains at the carboxyl terminal three residues. On the basis of crystal structures of the PSD-95-3 PDZ domain, the specificities observed with the peptide library can be rationalized."
https://openalex.org/W2144281476,"Human immune responses are heterogeneous and may involve antagonism between T helper (T H ) lymphocyte subsets and their cytokines. Atopy is characterized by immediate immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated hypersensitivity to agents such as dust mites and pollen, and it underlies the increasingly prevalent disorder asthma. Among Japanese schoolchildren, there was a strong inverse association between delayed hypersensitivity to Mycobacterium tuberculosis and atopy. Positive tuberculin responses predicted a lower incidence of asthma, lower serum IgE levels, and cytokine profiles biased toward T H 1 type. Exposure and response to M. tuberculosis may, by modification of immune profiles, inhibit atopic disorder."
https://openalex.org/W2154616416,"During nervous system development, spinal commissural axons project toward floor plate cells and trochlear motor axons extend away from these cells. Netrin-1, a diffusible protein made by floor plate cells, can attract spinal commissural axons and repel trochlear axons in vitro, but its role in vivo is unknown. Netrin-1 deficient mice exhibit defects in spinal commissural axon projections that are consistent with netrin-1 guiding these axons. Defects in several forebrain commissures are also observed, suggesting additional guidance roles for netrin-1. Trochlear axon projections are largely normal, predicting the existence of additional cues for these axons, and evidence is provided for a distinct trochlear axon chemorepellent produced by floor plate cells. These results establish netrin-1 as a guidance cue that likely collaborates with other diffusible cues to guide axons in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1966657425,"We describe the phenotype of gene-targeted mice lacking the putative chemokine receptor BLR1. In normal mice, this receptor is expressed on mature B cells and a subpopulation of T helper cells. Blr1 mutant mice lack inguinal lymph nodes and possess no or only a few phenotypically abnormal Peyer's patches. The migration of lymphocytes into splenic follicles is severely impaired, resulting in morphologically altered primary lymphoid follicles. Furthermore, activated B cells fail to migrate from the T cell–rich zone into B cell follicles of the spleen, and despite high numbers of germinal center founder cells, no functional germinal centers develop in this organ. Our results identify the putative chemokine receptor BLR1 as the first G protein–coupled receptor involved in B cell migration and localization of these cells within specific anatomic compartments."
https://openalex.org/W2049134173,"While changes in gene expression are critical for many brain functions, including long-term memory, little is known about the cellular processes that mediate stimulus-transcription coupling at central synapses. In studying the signaling pathways by which synaptic inputs control the phosphorylation state of cyclic AMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB) and determine expression of CRE-regulated genes, we found two important Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM)-regulated mechanisms in hippocampal neurons: a CaM kinase cascade involving nuclear CaMKIV and a calcineurin-dependent regulation of nuclear protein phosphatase 1 activity. Prolongation of the synaptic input on the time scale of minutes, in part by an activity-induced inactivation of calcineurin, greatly extends the period over which phospho-CREB levels are elevated, thus affecting induction of downstream genes."
https://openalex.org/W2073828263,"Numerous studies have revealed an association between nutritional status, adiposity, and reproductive maturity. The role of leptin, a hormone secreted from adipose tissue, in the onset of reproductive function was investigated. Normal prepubertal female mice injected with leptin grew at a slower rate than controls as a result of the hormone's thinning effects, but they reproduced up to 9 days earlier than controls and showed earlier maturation of the reproductive tract. These results suggest that leptin acts as a signal triggering puberty, thus supporting the hypothesis that fat accumulation enhances maturation of the reproductive tract."
https://openalex.org/W2132366506,"Venous malformations (VMs), the most common errors of vascular morphogenesis in humans, are composed of dilated, serpiginous channels. The walls of the channels have a variable thickness of smooth muscle; some mural regions lack smooth muscle altogether. A missense mutation resulting in an arginine-to-tryptophan substitution at position 849 in the kinase domain of the receptor tyrosine kinase TIE2 segregates with dominantly inherited VM in two unrelated families. Using proteins expressed in insect cells, we demonstrate that the mutation results in increased activity of TIE2. We conclude that an activating mutation in TIE2 causes inherited VMs in the two families and that the TIE2 signaling pathway is critical for endothelial cell-smooth muscle cell communication in venous morphogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2057161685,"MAD-related (MADR) proteins are essential intracellular components of TGFbeta signaling pathways and are regulated by phosphorylation. Here, we demonstrate that MADR2 and not the related protein DPC4 transiently interacts with the TGFbeta receptor and is directly phosphorylated by the complex on C-terminal serines. Interaction of MADR2 with receptors and phosphorylation requires activation of receptor I by receptor II and is mediated by the receptor I kinase. Mutation of the phosphorylation sites generates a dominant negative MADR2 that blocks TGFbeta-dependent transcriptional responses, stably associates with receptors, and fails to accumulate in the nucleus in response to TGFbeta signaling. Thus, transient association and phosphorylation of MADR2 by the TGFbeta receptor is necessary for nuclear accumulation and initiation of signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2151954645,"Time-resolved absorption spectroscopy on the femtosecond time scale has been used to monitor the earliest events associated with excited-state relaxation in tris-(2,2′-bipyridine)ruthenium(II). The data reveal dynamics associated with the temporal evolution of the Franck-Condon state to the lowest energy excited state of this molecule. The process is essentially complete in ∼300 femtoseconds after the initial excitation. This result is discussed with regard to reformulating long-held notions about excited-state relaxation, as well as its implication for the importance of non-equilibrium excited-state processes in understanding and designing molecular-based electron transfer, artificial photosynthetic, and photovoltaic assemblies in which compounds of this class are currently playing a key role."
https://openalex.org/W2125216271,"The molecular basis for patterning of complex organ structures like the lung and insect tracheal system is unknown. Here, we describe the Drosophila gene branchless (bnl) and demonstrate that it is a key determinant of the tracheal branching pattern. bnl is required for tracheal branching and is expressed dynamically in clusters of cells surrounding the developing tracheal system at each position where a new branch will form and grow out. Localized misexpression of bnl can direct branch formation and outgrowth to new positions. Generalized misexpression activates later programs of tracheal gene expression and branching, resulting in massive networks of branches. bnl encodes a homolog of mammalian fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) and appears to function as a ligand for the breathless receptor tyrosine kinase, an FGF receptor homolog expressed on developing tracheal cells. The results suggest that this FGF pathway specifies the tracheal branching pattern by guiding tracheal cell migration during primary branch formation and then activating later programs of finer branching at the ends of growing primary branches."
https://openalex.org/W2088811685,"Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a common disease and an important cause of renal failure. It is characterized by considerable intrafamilial phenotypic variation and focal cyst formation. To elucidate the molecular basis for these observations, we have developed a novel method for isolating renal cystic epithelia from single cysts and have used it to show that individual renal cysts in ADPKD are monoclonal. Loss of heterozygosity was discovered within a subset of cysts for two closely linked polymorphic markers located within the PKD1gene. Genetic analysis revealed that it was the normal haplotype that was lost. This study provides a molecular explanation for the focal nature of cyst formation and a probable mechanism whereby mutations cause disease. The high rate at which “second hits” must occur to account for the large number of cysts observed suggests that unique structural features of the PKD1gene may be responsible for its mutability."
https://openalex.org/W2058488557,"Arterial smooth muscle cells (SMCs) are arrested in the G1 phase of the cell cycle on polymerized type I collagen fibrils, while monomer collagen supports SMC proliferation. Cyclin E-associated kinase and cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (cdk2) phosphorylation are inhibited on polymerized collagen, and levels of the cdk2 inhibitors p27Kip1 and p21Cip1/Waf1 are increased compared with SMCs on monomer collagen. p27Kip1 associates with the cyclin E-cdk2-p21Cip1/Waf1 complex in SMCs on polymerized collagen. Monovalent blocking antibodies to alpha2 integrins, integrins that mediate adhesion to both forms of collagen, mimic these effects on monomer collagen. Furthermore, polymerized collagen rapidly suppresses p70 S6 kinase, a possible regulator of p27Kip1. Thus, fibrillar collagen specifically regulates early integrin signaling that may lead to up-regulation of cdk2 inhibitors and inhibition of SMC proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2159571381,"Sexual orientation and courtship behavior in Drosophila are regulated by fruitless (fru), the first gene in a branch of the sex-determination hierarchy functioning specifically in the central nervous system (CNS). The phenotypes of new fru mutants encompass nearly all aspects of male sexual behavior. Alternative splicing of fru transcripts produces sex-specific proteins belonging to the BTB-ZF family of transcriptional regulators. The sex-specific fru products are produced in only about 500 of the 10(5) neurons that comprise the CNS. The properties of neurons expressing these fru products suggest that fru specifies the fates or activities of neurons that carry out higher order control functions to elicit and coordinate the activities comprising male courtship behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2050255961,"Nitric oxide (NO) has been implicated in hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP), but LTP is normal in mice with a targeted mutation in the neuronal form of NO synthase (nNOS-). LTP was also normal in mice with a targeted mutation in endothelial NOS (eNOS-), but LTP in stratum radiatum of CA1 was significantly reduced in doubly mutant mice (nNOS-/eNOS-). By contrast, LTP in stratum oriens was normal in the doubly mutant mice. These results provide the first genetic evidence that NOS is involved in LTP in stratum radiatum and suggest that the neuronal and endothelial forms can compensate for each other in mice with a single mutation. They further suggest that there is also a NOS-independent component of LTP in stratum radiatum and that LTP in stratum oriens is largely NOS independent."
https://openalex.org/W2128367954,"Septate and tight junctions are thought to seal neighboring cells together and to function as barriers between epithelial cells. We have characterized a novel member of the neurexin family, Neurexin IV (NRX), which is localized to septate junctions (SJs) of epithelial and glial cells. NRX is a transmembrane protein with a cytoplasmic domain homologous to glycophorin C, a protein required for anchoring protein 4.1 in the red blood cell. Absence of NRX results in mislocalization of Coracle, a Drosophila protein 4.1 homolog, at SJs and causes dorsal closure defects similar to those observed in coracle mutants. nrx mutant embryos are paralyzed, and electrophysiological studies indicate that the lack of NRX in glial-glial SJs causes a breakdown of the blood-brain barrier. Electron microscopy demonstrates that nrx mutants lack the ladder-like intercellular septa characteristic of pleated SJs (pSJs). These studies identify NRX as the first transmembrane protein of SJ and demonstrate a requirement for NRX in the formation of septate-junction septa and intercellular barriers."
https://openalex.org/W2085140951,"A basic issue in ecology is the relation between extinction and population size. One of the clearest manifestations of a population threshold for extinction is the critical community size below which infections like measles do not persist. The current generation of stochastic models overestimates the observed critical community size for measles, generating much less persistence of infection than is observed. The inclusion of a more biologically realistic model for the duration of infection produced a much closer fit to the actual critical community size and explains previously undescribed high-frequency oscillations in measles incidence."
https://openalex.org/W2052504607,"Calnexin and calreticulin interact specifically with newly synthesized glycoproteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and function as molecular chaperones. The carbohydrate-specific interactions between ER components and glycoproteins synthesized in isolated canine pancreatic microsomes were analyzed using a cross-linking approach. A carbohydrate-dependent interaction between newly synthesized glycoproteins, the thiol-dependent reductase ERp57, and either calnexin or calreticulin was identified. The interaction between ERp57 and the newly synthesized glycoproteins required trimming of the N-linked oligosaccharide side chain. Thus, it is likely that ERp57 functions as part of the glycoprotein-specific quality control machinery operating in the lumen of the ER."
https://openalex.org/W2064902266,"A general method for combining existing algorithms into new programs that are unequivocally preferable to any of the component algorithms is presented. This method, based on notions of risk in economics, offers a computational portfolio design procedure that can be used for a wide range of problems. Tested by solving a canonical NP-complete problem, the method can be used for problems ranging from the combinatorics of DNA sequencing to the completion of tasks in environments with resource contention, such as the World Wide Web."
https://openalex.org/W2102133195,"Nitric oxide (NO) has been proposed to act as a retrograde messenger during long-term potentiation (LTP) in the CA1 region of hippocampus, but the inaccessibility of the presynaptic terminal has prevented a definitive test of this hypothesis. Because both sides of the synapse are accessible in cultured hippocampal neurons, we have used this preparation to investigate the role of NO. We examined LTP following intra- or extracellular application of an NO scavenger, an inhibitor of NO synthase, and a membrane-impermeant NO donor that releases NO only upon photolysis with UV light. Our results indicate that NO is produced in the postsynaptic neuron, travels through the extracellular space, and acts directly in the presynaptic neuron to produce long-term potentiation, supporting the hypothesis that NO acts as a retrograde messenger during LTP."
https://openalex.org/W2102354645,"Regional brain activation was assessed by mapping of Fos-related protein expression in rats trained to self-administration of intravenous nicotine and cocaine. Both drugs produced specific overlapping patterns of activation in the shell and the core of the nucleus accumbens, medial prefrontal cortex, and medial caudate areas, but not in the amygdala. Thus, the reinforcing properties of cocaine and nicotine map on selected structures of the terminal fields of the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system, supporting the idea that common substrates for these addictive drugs exist."
https://openalex.org/W1997140414,"In situ neutron diffraction experiments show that at pressures above 2 kilobars, cubic zirconium tungstate (ZrW 2 O 8 ) undergoes a quenchable phase transition to an orthorhombic phase, the structure of which has been solved from powder diffraction data. This phase transition can be reversed by heating at 393 kelvin and 1 atmosphere and involves the migration of oxygen atoms in the lattice. The high-pressure phase shows negative thermal expansion from 20 to 300 kelvin. The relative thermal expansion and compressibilities of the cubic and orthorhombic forms can be explained in terms of the “cross-bracing” between polyhedra that occurs as a result of the phase transition."
https://openalex.org/W2111612750,"At Class II catabolite activator protein (CAP)-dependent promoters, CAP activates transcription from a DNA site overlapping the DNA site for RNA polymerase. We show that transcription activation at Class II CAP-dependent promoters requires not only the previously characterized interaction between an activating region of CAP and the RNA polymerase α subunit C-terminal domain, but also an interaction between a second, promoter-class-specific activating region of CAP and the RNA polymerase α subunit N-terminal domain. We further show that the two interactions affect different steps in transcription initiation. Transcription activation at Class II CAP-dependent promoters provides a paradigm for understanding how an activator can make multiple interactions with the transcription machinery, each interaction being responsible for a specific mechanistic consequence."
https://openalex.org/W2018779619,"The controversial question of how thiamine diphosphate, the biologically active form of vitamin B 1 , is activated in different enzymes has been addressed. Activation of the coenzyme was studied by measuring thermodynamics and kinetics of deprotonation at the carbon in the 2-position (C2) of thiamine diphosphate in the enzymes pyruvate decarboxylase and transketolase by use of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, proton/deuterium exchange, coenzyme analogs, and site-specific mutant enzymes. Interaction of a glutamate with the nitrogen in the 1′-position in the pyrimidine ring activated the 4′-amino group to act as an efficient proton acceptor for the C2 proton. The protein component accelerated the deprotonation of the C2 atom by several orders of magnitude, beyond the rate of the overall enzyme reaction. Therefore, the earlier proposed concerted mechanism or stabilization of a C2 carbanion can be excluded."
https://openalex.org/W1980176640,"We have isolated a Drosophila gene, barren (barr), required for sister-chromatid segregation in mitosis. barr encodes a novel protein that is present in proliferating cells and has homologs in yeast and human. Mitotic defects in barr embryos become apparent during cycle 16, resulting in a loss of PNS and CNS neurons. Centromeres move apart at the metaphase-anaphase transition and Cyclin B is degraded, but sister chromatids remain connected, resulting in chromatin bridging. This phenotype is similar to that described in TOP2 mutants in yeast. Barren protein localizes to chromatin throughout mitosis. Colocalization and biochemical experiments indicate that Barren associates with Topoisomerase II throughout mitosis and alters the activity of Topoisomerase II. We propose that this association is required for proper chromosomal segregation by facilitating the decatenation of chromatids at anaphase."
https://openalex.org/W2057581247,"Eomesodermin (Eomes) is a novel Xenopus T-domain gene. In normal development, it is expressed in mesodermal cells in a ventral-to-dorsal gradient of increasing concentration. It reaches its peak expression 1–2 hr before any other known panmesodermal gene. It is strongly inducible by normal vegetal cells and by mesoderm-inducing factors. Ectopic expression of Eomes in animal caps induces the transcription of nearly all mesodermal genes in a concentration-dependent way. Overexpression of Eomes dorsalizes ventral mesoderm, inducing gsc and changing cell fate to muscle and notochord. Blocking the function of Eomes causes gastrulation arrest and defective mesoderm-dependent gene activation. We propose that Eomes fulfills an essential function in initiating mesoderm differentiation and in determining mesodermal cell fate."
https://openalex.org/W1982161960,"X-MyT1 is a C2HC-type zinc finger protein that we find to be involved in the primary selection of neuronal precursor cells in Xenopus. Expression of this gene is positively regulated by the bHLH protein X-NGNR-1 and negatively regulated by the Notch/Delta signal transduction pathway. X-MyT1 is able to promote ectopic neuronal differentiation and to confer insensitivity to lateral inhibition, but only in cooperation with bHLH transcription factors. Inhibition of X-MyT1 function inhibits normal neurogenesis as well as ectopic neurogenesis caused by overexpression of X-NGNR-1. On the basis of these findings, we suggest that X-MyT1 is a novel, essential element in the cascade of events that allows cells to escape lateral inhibition and to enter the pathway that leads to terminal neuronal differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2099780173,"Nucleocapsid protein 7 (NCp7), the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) nucleocapsid protein, was shown to strongly potentiate the dimerization of the retroviral genomic RNA. This process involves the interaction of two retroviral RNA monomer subunits near their 5ʹ-ends. A region located upstream from the splice donor site was recently identified as being responsible for the formation of dimeric HIV-1 RNA. This region appeared to be confined within a stem-loop structure, with an autocomplementary sequence in the loop. In an in vitro study of spontaneous dimer formation, we reported that the 77-402 RNA transcript forms two distinct dimers differing in their thermostability: D37 and D55. We identified D37 as a “kissing” complex structure, formed via a loop-loop interaction between the two monomers, and D55 as a double stranded structure involving all nucleotides of the stem-loop via canonical base pairing. In this report, we have characterized the role of NCp7 in the HIV-1Lai RNA dimerization process by using in vitro dimerization assays with RNA transcripts of different lengths and dimer thermal dissociation. Our results show that the nucleocapsid protein NCp7 activates RNA dimerization very likely through interaction with the kissing complex and converts it into a stable dimer. Furthermore, this NCp7-promoted conversion only occurs if the 240-280 stem-loop structure is present in HIV-1Lai RNA molecules and contains the autocomplementary G257CGCGC262 sequence.

NCp binds preferentially to single-stranded nucleic acids with a high affinity for viral RNA (1Coffin, J. M., (1984) RNA Tumor Viruses, (Weiss, R., Teich, N., Varmus, H., Coffin, J., eds), Vol. 1, pp. 261–368, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY.Google Scholar). Thus, NCp seems to play a key role in several steps of the viral life cycle. During reverse transcription, NCp stimulates tRNA primer annealing to the PBS at the 5ʹ end of the viral RNA (19Prats A.-C. Sarih L. Gabus C. Litvak S. Keith G. Darlix J.-L.

NC protein has also been shown to activate retroviral HIV-1 RNA dimerization in vitro (2Darlix J.-L. Gabus C. Nugeyre M.-T. Clavel F. Barré-Sinoussi F. J. Mol.

The dimer linkage structure, defined by electron microscopy, is an RNA-RNA interaction site located in the ψ sequence close to the 5ʹ-ends of viral RNA molecules (28Bender W. Chien Y.H. Chattopadkyay S. Vogt P.K. Gardner M.R. Davidson N. J. Virol. 1978; 25: 888-896Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Murti K.G. Bondurant M. Tereba A. J. Virol. 1981; 37: 411-419Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The nature of the base-pairing interactions of the dimer linkage structure has been studied by analyzing spontaneous RNA transcript dimerization in vitro (2Darlix J.-L. Gabus C. Nugeyre M.-T.

Primary results were in favor of the hypothesis that HIV-1 RNA dimerization involves purine-rich sequences, which should form noncanonical base pairs (30Marquet R. Baudin F. Gabus C. Darlix J.L.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9785-9794Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and avian leukosis virus 2P. Fossé, unpublished observations. RNA transcripts, which contain an autocomplementary sequence in a stem-loop structure, located downstream from the PBS and upstream from the splice donor site, are able to dimerize spontaneously in vitro. It has been proposed that HIV-1 RNA dimer formation is initiated by the annealing of these autocomplementary sequences via a loop-loop interaction between the two RNA molecules, resulting in the formation of a “kissing” complex at 37°C (39Muriaux D. Fossé P. Paoletti J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5075-5082Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). This intermediary complex should spontaneously evolve at 55°C toward a more stable dimer involving all the nucleotides of the stem-loop structure in canonical base pairs (39Muriaux D. Fossé P. Paoletti J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5075-5082Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). However, the role of the NC protein in this process has not yet been investigated. The ability of the NC protein to destabilize nucleic acid structures (41Khan R. Giedroc D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6689-6695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and to promote nucleic acid annealing and renaturation (42Dib-Hajj F. Khan R. Giedroc D.P. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 231-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) should be taken into account when explaining RNA dimerization in the presence of the protein. In this report, we analyze the role of a synthetic NCp7 in the in vitro dimerization process of HIV-1Lai RNA transcripts. Details of the pDM2, pDM3, pDM6, and pDM7 plasmid constructions are given elsewhere (35Muriaux D. Girard P.-M. Bonnet-Mathoniѐre B. Paoletti J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8209-8216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). HaeIII and RsaI restriction enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs. The pDM3 plasmid was digested by HaeIII and transcribed by T7 RNA polymerase and gave rise to a transcript starting from position 77 of the genomic HIV-1Lai RNA sequence and ending at position 402. This transcript will be referred to as RNA 77-402 (Fig. 5). The pDM2 plasmid was digested by either HaeIII or RsaI and transcribed by T7 RNA polymerase and gave rise to transcripts starting from position 224 of the genomic HIV-1Lai RNA sequence and ending at positions 402 and 296, respectively. These transcripts will be referred to as RNA 224-402 and RNA 224-296 transcripts (Fig. 5). The pDM6 plasmid was digested by HaeIII and transcribed by T7 RNA polymerase and gave rise to transcripts starting from position 296 of the genomic HIV-1Lai RNA sequence and ending at positions 402. This transcript will be referred to as RNA 296-402 (Fig. 5). The pDM7 plasmid, first digested by HaeIII, was transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase and gave rise to RNA transcript 224-402DEL, devoid of nucleotides 257-266 (Fig. 5). Experimental procedures for the HIV-1Lai RNA transcript production and purification are given elsewhere (35Muriaux D. Girard P.-M. Bonnet-Mathoniѐre B. Paoletti J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8209-8216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 39Muriaux D. Fossé P. Paoletti J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5075-5082Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Solid phase synthesis of HIV-1 NCp7 protein, consisting of 72 amino acids, was performed as described previously (43De Rocquigny H. Ficheux D. Gabus C. Fournié-Zaluski M.-C. Darlix J.-L. Roques B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 180: 1010-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Stock solutions of NCp7 were conserved at 10-3M and 4°C in Milli-Q water (Millipore) containing three equivalent molar concentrations of ZnSO4. In a standard dimerization assay, RNA in 14 μl of Milli-Q water was heated for 2 min at 90°C, chilled on ice for 2 min, and adjusted to 20 μl with 4 μl of 5 x NC buffer containing 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mM NaCl, 25 mM dithiothreitol, and 1 mM MgCl2 and 2 μl of 10 x NCp7 solution, i.e. 17.5 protein molecules/RNA strand, (or poly-L-lysine) or polyethylene glycol 8000 or 2 μl of Milli-Q water). Poly-L-lysine and polyethylene glycol 8000 were purchased from Sigma. The samples were incubated for 15 min at 37°C or at temperatures ranging from 10 to 60°C. At the end of incubation, all the samples were cooled on ice for 2 min, placed for 2 min at room temperature, and then mixed with 10 μl of water and 3 μl of 5% SDS for 5 more min at room temperature. The RNA transcripts were phenol extracted for deproteinization with 30 μl of phenol saturated by 40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.5, 0.1% SDS, and 2.5 mM EDTA. Three μl of loading buffer (50% (w/v) glycerol and 0.025% (w/v) tracking dyes) were then added, and the samples were loaded on a 1.5% Sea Kem agarose gel and electrophoresed at 5 V/cm and 4°C in buffer containing 50 mM Tris-borate, pH 8.3, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.2 μg/ml ethidium bromide. Monomeric RNA transcripts were obtained at 20°C in a buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. After denaturation at 90°C for 2 min in nuclease-free water, the RNA was incubated in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 100 mM NaCl (dimer buffer) at a strand concentration of 0.8 μM at either 37°C or 55°C for 90 min for optimal dimerization (35Muriaux D. Girard P.-M. Bonnet-Mathoniѐre B. Paoletti J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8209-8216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The resulting dimers, D37 (unstable dimer) and D55 (stable dimer), were then dialyzed (Millipore V6 filters, 0.025 μm) for 2 h at 4°C against 1 x NC buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mM MgCl2. Unstable dimer was then incubated in the presence of NCp7 (i.e. 1 molecule of the protein per 20 nt of RNA 77-402) for 15 min at 37°C. Both dimers were then treated with SDS-phenol, as described above, for deproteinization, and 20-μl aliquots of each sample were then incubated for 5 min at varying temperatures ranging from 10 to 65°C and electrophoresed as described above. After fluorescent scanning of the gels using a Bioprofil apparatus (Vildber Lourmat, Marne La Vallee, France), the percentage of dimer and monomer was estimated. The percentage of the dimer was defined as the area of the dimer peak divided by the sum of the areas of monomer and dimer peaks. The Tm was estimated from the plot of the amount of the dimer as a function of temperature. Purified synthetic DNA oligonucleotides complementary to positions 251-267 of the HIV-1Lai sequence (oligonucleotide 257B, 5ʹ-GCCGTGCGCGCTTCAGC3-ʹ) and to positions 268-284 of the HIV-1Mal sequence (35Muriaux D. Girard P.-M. Bonnet-Mathoniѐre B. Paoletti J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8209-8216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 39Muriaux D. Fossé P. Paoletti J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5075-5082Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) (oligonucleotide 257 M, used as a control oligonucleotide, differs from 257B by 4 nt, 5ʹGCTGTGTGCACCTCAGC3ʹ) were obtained from Genosys, Inc. Numbering is relative to the genomic RNA cap site (+1). DNA oligonucleotides were 5ʹ-32P-labeled with [—γ-32P]ATP (Amersham, Corp.) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Boehringer Mannheim). The specific radioactivity was about 105 cpm/μg DNA oligonucleotide. RNA 77-402 was heat-denatured in the presence of the 32P-DNA oligonucleotide before starting the in vitro dimerization process. NCp7 was then added with the NC buffer as described above. After a SDS-phenol treatment, 32P-DNA oligonucleotide-RNA complexes were analyzed by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis. After staining with ethidium bromide and photography, the gel was fixed for 10 min in 10% trichloroacetic and dried for 40 min under vacuum at room temperature. Hybridization of the 32P-DNA oligonucleotide to monomeric and dimeric RNA 77-402 was detected by autoradiography of the corresponding gel. RNA secondary structures were predicted with the MFOLD program, which uses the energy minimization method of Zucker (44Zucker M. Science. 1989; 244: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar) and energy rules developed by Turner et al. (45Turner D.H. Sugimoto N. Freier S.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1988; 17: 167-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). The secondary structure of the HIV-1Lai 240-280 region within the RNA 77-402 transcript was confirmed by enzymatic probing (39Muriaux D. Fossé P. Paoletti J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5075-5082Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In vitro dimerization of the HIV-1Lai RNA 77-402 transcript was performed in the presence of varying amounts of NCp7. After dimerization, the dimer was deproteinized and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Fig. 1A shows that although the RNA 77-402 transcript incubated alone migrates mainly as a monomer (lane D, around 15-20% of dimer), in the presence of NCp7, the monomer disappears to give rise to a RNA dimer together with a small amount of higher order multimers (lanes 1/20, 1/10, 1/5, and 1/2). It should be noted, for purposes of comparison, that the dimer samples obtained in the presence or absence of the protein were submitted to the same deproteinization step. Under these conditions, NCp7 activates RNA 77-402 dimerization, and this activation is almost complete for an NCp7 to RNA ratio of at least 1 NCp7 molecule/20 nt (Fig. 1A, lane 1/20). This result is in accordance with several previous works in which retroviral NC was found to activate retroviral RNA dimerization in vitro (2Darlix J.-L. Gabus C. Nugeyre M.-T. Clavel F. Barré-Sinoussi F. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 689-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 21De Rocquigny H. Gabus C. Vincent A. Fournié-Zaluski M.-C. Roques B. Darlix J.-L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6472-6476Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 27Sakagushi K. Zambrano N. Baldwin E.T. Shapiro B.A. Erickson J.E. Omichinski J.G. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Appela E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5219-5223Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The specificity of this activation process was tested by using poly-L-lysine instead of NCp7 in the same dimerization assay. This peptide, a highly basic polypeptide, was unable to activate RNA 77-402 dimerization efficiently (Fig. 1B, lanes 1/20, 1/10, and 1/5); the percentage of dimer remained the same as in the RNA control (Fig. 1B, lane D). However, multimers were induced by poly-L-lysine (Fig. 1B, lanes 1/20, 1/10, and 1/5). This could result from electrostatic binding of the basic polypeptides to the RNA molecules. In the case of NCp7, at ratios higher than 1/50 protein/nt, such a multimerization occurs (Fig. 1A, lanes 1/20, 1/10, 1/5, and 1/2), but we observed a difference between the migration of the multimers formed in the presence of NCp7 and the migration of those formed in the presence of poly-L-lysine. This difference could be due to the fact that in the presence of poly-L-lysine, we observed an aggregation process leading to trimers, tetramers, pentamers, etc., whereas in the presence of NCp7, the multimers seem to correspond to multimerization of dimers leading to tetramers and even higher order structures, i.e. hexamers and octamers. Also, we observed a decrease of multimer content (at least from ratio 1/20 to 1/5; Fig. 1A), which may be due to the fact that as the concentration of NCp7 increases, the protein coats the RNA, and the interaction between RNA molecules may not be as efficient. We also tested the influence of polyethylene glycol on the dimerization process, since polyethylene glycol is known to enhance the rate of hybridization of nucleic acids (46Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). Increasing amounts of polyethylene glycol did not have a detectable effect on RNA 77-402 dimerization (Fig. 1B, lanes 1, 5, and 10%). To characterize further the dimerization process, the kinetics of RNA 77-402 dimerization were investigated (data not shown). In the presence of NCp7, dimerization was complete after 5 min at 37°C, and no kinetic profile was observed whatever the protein concentration. These results are in accordance with those presented by Darlix and co-workers (2Darlix J.-L. Gabus C. Nugeyre M.-T. Clavel F. Barré-Sinoussi F. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 689-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) with the NCp15 protein and indicate that NCp7 probably does not function in a catalytic manner. We analyzed the effect of the temperature on spontaneous in vitro dimerization of HIV-1Lai RNA 77-402 (Fig. 2A). On incubation in the NC buffer, spontaneous dimerization of RNA 77-402 occurred. Up to 37°C, about 60% of the RNA was dimeric (Fig. 2A, lanes 20, 30, and 37), whereas between 45 and 50°C, this dimer dissociated (Fig. 2A, lanes 45 and 50). This dissociation led to the formation of two monomeric conformers (m and mʹ), the nature of which remains unknown. For temperatures higher than 50°C, some dimer reappeared when mʹ disappeared (Fig. 2A, lanes 55 and 60). The same results were observed in dimer buffer while characterizing the spontaneous in vitro RNA 77-402 dimerization process (39Muriaux D. Fossé P. Paoletti J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5075-5082Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), and, as previously shown, one of these dimers, formed at 37°C, was termed D37 and identified as an unstable kissing complex, resulting from the loop-loop interaction of the autocomplementary G257CGCGC262 sequence. The other dimer, formed at 55°C, was termed D55 and corresponded to a more stable double-stranded structure. Samples required SDS-phenol treatment, before gel analysis, in the presence of the NCp7 protein. Thus, RNA 77-402 dimerization was investigated as a function of the temperature in the absence of NCp7 but in NC buffer followed by SDS-phenol treatment (Fig. 2B). Under these conditions, dimerization, observed without SDS-phenol treatment between 20 and 37°C (Fig. 2A), no longer occurred (Fig. 2B, lanes 20 and 37). This suggests that the kissing complex was not stable enough to resist such treatment and that only the dimer formed at 55°C was stable enough to remain intact (Fig. 2B, lanes 55 and 60). Then, the experiment was performed in the presence of the NCp7 nucleocapsid protein to observe the effect of this protein on dimer formation (Fig. 2C). NCp7 promoted complete RNA 77-402 dimerization at temperatures ranging from 30 to 60°C (Fig. 2C). Dimer instability, triggered with SDS-phenol treatment (Fig. 2B) and occurring in the 45-50°C range (Fig. 2A), had disappeared in the presence of the protein (Fig. 2C). This could signify that NCp7 promotes the formation of a unique dimer able to support deproteinization (Fig. 2C, lanes 20-60) and strongly suggests that the dimer formed in the presence of NCp7 is the same as the one observed at 55°C in its absence. We were eager to check whether NCp7 was capable of converting the unstable kissing complex into the stable dimer. The thermal stability of the dimer formed at 55°C, in the absence of the protein, was compared with that of the kissing complex submitted to NCp7 activity (Fig. 3). The unstable dimer, D37, and the stable dimer, D55, we"

In animals, chloride channels are important for transepithelial transport and regulation of excitability of muscle and nerve, as demonstrated by several diseases which result from their genetic alteration.In plants, chloride channels contribute to a number of plant-specific functions, such as regulation of turgor, stomatal movement, nutrient transport, and metal tolerance (for reviews, see Refs. 1Tyerman S.D.

In recent years, various plant chloride channels have been characterized biophysically, both in plasma membranes and in membranes of different organelles. The best documented examples are chloride channels of guard cells (5Keller B.U. Hedrich R. Raschke K. Nature. 1989; 341: 450-453Crossref Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 6Linder B. Raschke K.

Activity of these channels is subject to extensive regulation by extracellular factors such as hormones and photosynthetic metabolites, as well as by intracellular Ca2+ and nucleotides (8Hedrich R.

Plant chloride channels are also believed to play a prominent role in signal perception and transduction since a variety of signals such as light, hormones, and pathogen-derived elicitors cause membrane depolarization by stimulating anion efflux (11Dangl J.L.

The vacuole as the major storage site for ions and nutrients plays a crucial role in turgor formation and in intracellular degradation of proteins. Experimental evidence has accumulated that tonoplast anion channels participate in these functions (13Plant P.J. Gelli A. Blumwald E. J. Membr.

Very recently, and in parallel with our work, a putative chloride channel has been identified from tobacco (14Lurin C. Geelen D. Barbier-Brygoo H. Guern J. Maurel C.

This gene family, originally established by expression cloning of CLC-0 (15Jentsch T.J. Steinmeyer K. Schwarz G.

Nine CLC genes have been discovered so far in a single mammalian species, which based on homology can be divided into three subfamilies (reviewed in Ref. 18). The first branch includes the CLC-1, CLC-2, and the CLC-K chloride channels. CLC-1 as the major skeletal muscle chloride channel (19Steinmeyer K. Ortland C. Jentsch T.J.

Nature. 1992; 360: 759-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) and possibly plays a role in the regulation of cell volume. Rabbit CLC-2 was suggested to be stimulated by protein kinase A, but the ion selectivity of the reported single channel currents (24Malinowska D.H. Kupert E.Y. Bahinski A. Sherry A.M. Cuppoletti J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C191-C200Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) differed from those of macroscopic rat CLC-2 currents (22Thiemann A. Gründer S. Pusch M. Jentsch T.J.

A. 1996; 93: 13362-13367Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The CLC-K1 and CLC-K2 channels are exclusively expressed in the kidney (26Uchida S. Sasaki S. Furukawa T. Hiraoka M. Imai T.

Whereas the function of CLC-3 (29Kawasaki M. Uchida S. Monkawa T. Miyawaki A. Mikoshiba K. Marumo F. Sasaki S. Neuron. 1994; 12: 597-604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) and -4 (30Van Slegtenhorst M.A. Bassi M.T. Borsani G. Wapenaar M.C. Ferrero G.B. De Conciliis L. Rugarli E.I.

Schwappach B. Hatchwell E. Wrong O. Thakker R.V. Craig I.W. Nature. 1996; 379: 445-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). The single CLC homologue in yeast, ScCLC (originally termed GEF1), is most closely related to these genes. Since disruption of this yeast gene results in sensitivity to low iron levels in the growth medium (17Greene J.R. Brown N.H. DiDomenico B.J. Kaplan J. Eide D.J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 241: 542-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), ScCLC is somehow involved in iron metabolism. The most recent addition to the CLC family, namely the ubiquitously expressed CLC-6 and CLC-7 (35Brandt S. Jentsch T.J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 15-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), represents a further branch. As is the case with several other members of the CLC family their physiological role is not known at present.To further increase our knowledge of this important gene family of chloride channels, we have now cloned and analyzed novel plant CLC cDNAs. Starting from expressed sequence tags (ESTs) we have cloned four putative chloride channels from Arabidopsis thaliana. Whereas transcripts of AtCLC-a, -b, -c, and -d show a nearly ubiquitous tissue distribution, the AtCLC-d protein is highly expressed in the silique. None of the newly cloned proteins could be expressed functionally as a chloride channel in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Among the four cDNA clones only AtCLC-d rescued the iron-sensitive phenotype of a mutant yeast strain lacking the gene for ScCLC. The ability to functionally complement the yeast ScCLC protein suggests an intracellular function for AtCLC-d.DISCUSSIONIn this study we describe the molecular cloning of putative chloride channels from Arabidopsis and functional expression of one of them, AtCLC-d, in S. cerevisiae. They belong to the CLC family of voltage-gated chloride channels, and, together with the most recently identified CLC-Nt1 (14Lurin C. Geelen D. Barbier-Brygoo H. Guern J. Maurel C. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 701-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) from tobacco, represent the first putative chloride channels identified in plants at the molecular level.The four Arabidopsis genes are more closely related to mammalian CLC-6 and CLC-7 (35Brandt S. Jentsch T.J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 15-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) than to the yeast homologue ScCLC (17Greene J.R. Brown N.H. DiDomenico B.J. Kaplan J. Eide D.J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 241: 542-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). CLC-Nt1 is most closely related to AtCLC-c (75% identity), suggesting that both proteins may represent species homologues (we therefore suggest to call it NtCLC-c, instead of CLC-Nt1, as originally dubbed by these authors (14Lurin C. Geelen D. Barbier-Brygoo H. Guern J. Maurel C. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 701-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar)). Similar to CLC-Nt1 (14Lurin C. Geelen D. Barbier-Brygoo H. Guern J. Maurel C. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 701-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and to several mammalian CLC genes, such as CLC-2 (22Thiemann A. Gründer S. Pusch M. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 1992; 356: 57-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar), CLC-6, and -7 (35Brandt S. Jentsch T.J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 15-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), Arabidopsis AtCLC genes display a broad tissue expression. All four transcripts are ubiquitously expressed, but show some tissue preferences. Thus, strongest expression of AtCLC-a, -c, and -d transcripts seems to occur in source leaf, whereas AtCLC-b is most strongly expressed in root. We have developed an antiserum against the AtCLC-d protein, and could demonstrate its specificity for this protein. Interestingly, we found that in the plant the AtCLC-d protein is mainly expressed in the fruit and not in leaf and root, as suggested from its mRNA distribution. This intriguing result might be due to a greater metabolic stability of the protein in the silique as compared to the other tissues.We were not able to functionally express any of the AtCLC proteins as a chloride channel in Xenopus oocytes. This is in contrast to Lurin et al. (14Lurin C. Geelen D. Barbier-Brygoo H. Guern J. Maurel C. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 701-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), who recently reported functional expression of CLC-Nt1, which may represent the tobacco homologue of AtCLC-c. Currents induced by CLC-Nt1 have properties similar to that reported for chloride currents endogenous to oocytes (50Kowdley G.C. Ackerman S.J. John III, E. Jones L.R. Moorman J.R. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 103: 217-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 51Shimbo K. Brassard D.L. Lamb R.A. Pinto L.H. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 1819-1829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Similar currents can also be induced in oocytes by overexpressing different integral membrane proteins (51Shimbo K. Brassard D.L. Lamb R.A. Pinto L.H. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 1819-1829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 52Tzounopoulos T. Maylie J. Adelman J.P. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 904-908Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), and in our hands by CLC-6, and -7 (35Brandt S. Jentsch T.J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 15-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), and even by a nonfunctional mutant of CLC-1 (49Steinmeyer K. Lorenz C. Pusch M. Koch M.C. Jentsch T.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 737-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Thus it cannot be excluded that the currents elicited by CLC-Nt1 are due to endogenous oocyte chloride channels. Several possible reasons may explain a lack of functional expression of AtCLC proteins. We cannot exclude that we have not yet identified the proper physiological stimulus for channel activation, e.g. a second messenger pathway. It is possible that oocytes lack additional subunits necessary for functional expression, either belonging to the same or to a different gene family. CLC chloride channels are oligomers (49Steinmeyer K. Lorenz C. Pusch M. Koch M.C. Jentsch T.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 737-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 53Middleton R.E. Pheasant D.J. Miller C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13189-13198Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and functional heterooligomeric channels can be formed by CLC-1 and CLC-2 subunits (25Lorenz C. Pusch M. Jentsch T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13362-13367Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Since AtCLC proteins seem to have overlapping expression patterns, we tested the possibility that different AtCLC proteins combine to heterooligomeric channels. However, coexpression of AtCLC proteins in various combinations again failed to produce functional chloride channels. Heterologous expression of ion channel proteins and their detection by electrophysiological recording is mainly limited to proteins localized to the plasma membrane. Proteins of intracellular membranes usually are not targeted to the oocyte plasma membrane. Thus AtCLC proteins may play an intracellular role. The ability of the AtCLC-d to functionally complement the growth defect of the gef1- yeast mutant points in this direction.Transport-deficient yeast strains have served as valuable tools for cloning of heterologous plant transport proteins by functional complementation (reviewed in Ref. 54). Thus, strains deficient in potassium uptake have permitted the identification of plant K+ channels (55Anderson J.A. Huprikar S.S. Kochian L.V. Lucas W.J. Gaber R.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3736-3740Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar, 56Sentenac H. Bonneaud N. Minet M. Lacroute F. Salmon J.-M. Gaymard F. Grignon C. Science. 1992; 256: 663-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). As an alternative expression system, we constructed a yeast mutant lacking the CLC homologue ScCLC. As is the case with the ScCLC-knockout on a different genetic background (17Greene J.R. Brown N.H. DiDomenico B.J. Kaplan J. Eide D.J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 241: 542-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), our mutant strain needs high iron levels for normal growth. Since uptake of extracellular iron into the original mutant cells appeared to be unaffected (17Greene J.R. Brown N.H. DiDomenico B.J. Kaplan J. Eide D.J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 241: 542-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), the ScCLC protein probably indirectly plays a role in intracellular iron metabolism. Intracellular steps in iron metabolism are presently not well understood, but presumably involve transport of iron in vesicles to the vacuole, storage in the vacuole, and release from the vacuole prior to utilization, e.g. as a component of mitochondrial electron transport chain proteins. In principal, defects at any given step in the intracellular route of iron transport could result in an increased iron requirement for normal growth. This is exemplified by the finding that a mutated subunit of the vacuolar H+-ATPase produces a very similar iron-sensitive phenotype as described for the ScCLC knockout strain (57Eide D.J. Bridgham J.T. Zhao Z. Mattoon J.R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 241: 447-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The vacuolar H+-ATPase is responsible for acidifying the vacuole, and the resulting proton gradient provides the driving force for accumulation of some metal ions in the vacuole (58Klionsky D.J. Herman P.K. Emr S.D. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 266-292Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Acidification can be more efficient if chloride channels in the vacuolar membrane allow for chloride influx into the vacuole, thereby compensating for the accumulation of positive charges (59Wada Y. Ohsumi Y. Anraku Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1101: 296-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the importance of an acidic vacuole for iron storage seems controversial (60Raguzzi F. Lesuisse E. Crichton R.R. FEBS Lett. 1988; 231: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 61Bode H.P. Dumschat M. Garotti S. Fuhrmann G.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar).The ability of AtCLC-d to functionally substitute for the yeast ScCLC protein implies similar physiological functions. Balancing the charge of transported protons may well be an intracellular function of both proteins. Chloride channels thought to be involved in the development and regulation of H+ gradients have been described in the vacuolar membrane (13Plant P.J. Gelli A. Blumwald E. J. Membr. Biol. 1994; 140: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 62Hedrich R. Kurkdjian A. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3661-3666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), in photosynthetic (thylakoid) membranes of chloroplasts (63Sch÷nknecht G. Hedrich R. Junge W. Raschke K. Nature. 1988; 336: 589-592Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 64Pottosin I.I. Sch÷nknecht G. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 148: 143-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and in the inner mitochondrial membrane (65Beavis A.D. Vercesi A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3079-3087Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The similar function of both proteins is also reflected by their subcellular localization. Both proteins appear in the same intracellular location in the yeast, whereas the other three proteins are clearly differently localized, and therefore most likely cannot fulfill the function of the endogenous yeast ScCLC protein. Greene et al. (17Greene J.R. Brown N.H. DiDomenico B.J. Kaplan J. Eide D.J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 241: 542-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) discussed the possibility of a vacuolar localization for the yeast CLC protein. Our studies with the GFP-tagged ScCLC protein did not support this and rather suggest that the yeast ScCLC protein plays its role in a different intracellular compartment.Elucidation of the precise cellular localization of AtCLC-d, as well as that of the other three AtCLC proteins, is an important goal for future studies. In addition, the successful expression of AtCLC-d in yeast offers the opportunity to use this genetic system for structure-function analysis. The isolation of four novel CLC genes should facilitate the identification of other members of this chloride channel family in plants and provides an important step to further increase our understanding of the roles chloride channels play in plant physiology.

The single CLC homologue in yeast, ScCLC (originally termed GEF1), is most closely related to these genes. Since disruption of this yeast gene results in sensitivity to low iron levels in the growth medium (17Greene J.R. Brown N.H. DiDomenico B.J. Kaplan J. Eide D.J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 241: 542-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), ScCLC is somehow involved in iron metabolism. The most recent addition to the CLC family, namely the ubiquitously expressed CLC-6 and CLC-7 (35Brandt S. Jentsch T.J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 15-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), represents a further branch. As is the case with several other members of the CLC family their physiological role is not known at present.To further increase our knowledge of this important gene family of chloride channels, we have now cloned and analyzed novel plant CLC cDNAs. Starting from expressed sequence tags (ESTs) we have cloned four putative chloride channels from Arabidopsis thaliana. Whereas transcripts of AtCLC-a, -b, -c, and -d show a nearly ubiquitous tissue distribution, the AtCLC-d protein is highly expressed in the silique. None of the newly cloned proteins could be expressed functionally as a chloride channel in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Among the four cDNA clones only AtCLC-d rescued the iron-sensitive phenotype of a mutant yeast strain lacking the gene for ScCLC. The ability to functionally complement the yeast ScCLC protein suggests an intracellular function for AtCLC-d."

Here we describe the analysis of beaten path (beat), a gene required for the selective defasciculation of motor axons at these choice points. In beat mutant embryos, motor axons fail to defasciculate and bypass their targets. This phenotype is suppressed by mutations in FasII and conn, two genes encoding cell adhesion molecules expressed on motor axons, suggesting that beat provides an antiadhesive function. beat encodes a novel secreted protein that is expressed by motoneurons during outgrowth.

https://openalex.org/W2010533729,"Retroviral virion assembly and uncoating are orchestrated by gag-encoded proteins, including the Capsid protein (CA) which forms the mature virion core. New genetic and structural data demonstrate that cyclophilin A (CyPA), a cytoplasmic protein best known as the receptor for the immunosuppressant cyclosporine A, forms a stable and essential complex with CA in HIV-1 virions. The most recent contribution to this evolving story, the solution of the three-dimensional structure of the HIV-1 CA–CyPA complex, is described in a highly informative paper in this issue of Cell (8Gamble T.R Vajdos F Yoo S Worthylake D.K Houseweart M Sundquist W.I Hill C.P >.Cell. 1996; 87 (this issue)Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). These data illuminate aspects of the retroviral life cycle that had been relatively inaccessible to study and evoke questions about the function of the ubiquitous cyclophilin family of proteins. The myristylated Gag polyprotein of HIV-1 and other retroviruses is sufficient for the formation and release of enveloped virions. Gag recruits other viral components required for infectivity, including genomic RNA and Env glycoprotein, via direct interactions during assembly. The protease product of the pol gene cleaves the Gag polyprotein into several mature proteins: the matrix protein, which lines the virion envelope; the capsid protein (CA), which forms the virion core; and the nucleocapsid zinc-finger protein, which coats the genomic RNA. To initiate infection of a susceptible cell, extracellular virus binds to a cell surface receptor, fuses with the plasma membrane, and delivers the ribonucleoprotein core into the cytoplasm. In a poorly defined manner, gag-encoded proteins then dissociate from the complex (uncoating), or change conformation, allowing reverse transcription to begin. Finally, gag protein may participate in transport of the DNA copy of the viral genome to the nucleus, or in covalent linkage of viral DNA to host chromosomal DNA. To identify cellular factors that might be coopted to help Gag fulfill its many roles, the HIV-1 Gag polyprotein was subjected to a yeast two-hybrid screen and found to interact with members of the CyP family (11Luban J Bossolt K.A Franke E.K Kalpana G.V Goff S.P >.Cell. 1993; 73: 1067-1078Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). CyPs were originally discovered because of their affinity for the potent immunosuppressive drug cyclosporine A (10Handschumacher R Harding M Rice J Drugge R >.Science. 1984; 226: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (1406) Google Scholar); the CyP–cyclosporine A complex binds and inactivates the calcium-dependent phosphatase calcineurin, thus blocking signal transduction in activated T-cells (14Schreiber S.L Crabtree G.R >.Immunology Today. 1992; 13: 136-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1880) Google Scholar). CyP proteins also catalyze the isomerization of peptidyl-prolyl bonds between the cis and trans states, though the biological significance of this activity has never been clearly demonstrated. Does CyP play a role in HIV-1 replication? CyPA, the member of the CyP family that colocalizes with Gag in the cytoplasm, is specifically incorporated into HIV-1 virions via interaction with the Gag polyprotein (4Braaten D Franke E.K Luban J >.J. Virol. 1996; 70: 3551-3560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Franke E.K Yuan H.E.H Luban J >.Nature. 1994; 372: 359-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar, 15Thali M Bukovsky A.A Kondo E Rosenwirth B Walsh C.T Sodroski J Göttlinger H.G >.Nature. 1994; 372: 363-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Gag binding to CyPA requires a proline-rich region located in the center of the CA domain, and mutation of a single proline, P90, or of the residue immediately preceding it, G89, disrupts CyPA incorporation into virions and precludes viral replication. Furthermore, cyclosporine A inhibits the production of replication-competent HIV-1 virions by disrupting the Gag–CyPA interaction (4Braaten D Franke E.K Luban J >.J. Virol. 1996; 70: 3551-3560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Thali M Bukovsky A.A Kondo E Rosenwirth B Walsh C.T Sodroski J Göttlinger H.G >.Nature. 1994; 372: 363-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Though CyPA is incorporated into HIV-1 virions it is not required for virion assembly per se: virions rendered CyPA-deficient by gag mutation, or by production in the presence of cyclosporine A, are produced at normal levels and are otherwise indistinguishable from wild-type virions by standard biochemical criteria (4Braaten D Franke E.K Luban J >.J. Virol. 1996; 70: 3551-3560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Franke E.K Yuan H.E.H Luban J >.Nature. 1994; 372: 359-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar, 15Thali M Bukovsky A.A Kondo E Rosenwirth B Walsh C.T Sodroski J Göttlinger H.G >.Nature. 1994; 372: 363-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, disruption of CyPA incorporation causes a quantitative reduction in virion infectivity, with the block occuring early in the virus life cycle, after membrane fusion, but prior to the initiation of reverse transcription (Figure 1). Target cell CyPA is not required for these early events and cannot rescue CyPA-deficient virions. Two genetic approaches were used to demonstrate that Gag not only packages CyPA into virions but that a gag-encoded function requires CyPA. Cyclosporine A-resistant HIV-1 isolates were selected in tissue culture by passage of virus in the presence of the drug, and the drug-resistant phenotype was shown to be conferred by either of two gag missense mutations, A92E or G94D (1Aberham C Weber S Phares W >.J. Virol. 1996; 70: 3536-3544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the amino acids altered by the drug resistance mutations are located in the immediate vicinity of residues G89 and P90, they have no effect on Gag's CyPA-binding properties (3Braaten D Aberham C Franke E.K Yin L Phares W Luban J >.J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5170-5176Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that CyPA-binding and CsA-resistance are genetically separable properties in gag. CsA-resistance results because the mutations confer CyPA-independence upon HIV-1 gag; this was confirmed by the following experiment: the single mutant P90A is unable to replicate due to its inability to bind CyPA, but the double mutant P90A A92E is replication competent, despite its inability to package CyPA into virions. The second approach that demonstrated that CyPA is required for a gag-encoded function involved the construction of a chimeric virus in which CA coding sequences of the SIVMAC239 DNA provirus were replaced with those from HIV-1 (5Dorfman T Göttlinger H.G >.J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5751-5757Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike HIV-1, SIVMAC239 does not incorporate CyPA into virions and replication of the latter is not inhibited by cyclosporine A (6Franke E.K Yuan H.E.H Luban J >.Nature. 1994; 372: 359-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar, 15Thali M Bukovsky A.A Kondo E Rosenwirth B Walsh C.T Sodroski J Göttlinger H.G >.Nature. 1994; 372: 363-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Chimeric virions were capable of incorporating CyPA and their replication was inhibited by cyclosporine A. The first high-resolution structural information for a retroviral CA has recently been published (8Gamble T.R Vajdos F Yoo S Worthylake D.K Houseweart M Sundquist W.I Hill C.P >.Cell. 1996; 87 (this issue)Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar, 9Gitti R.K Lee B.M Walker J Summers M.F Yoo S Sundquist W.I >.Science. 1996; 273: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 12Momany C Kovari L.C Prongay A.J Keller W Gitti R.K Lee B.M Gorbalenya A.E Tong L McClure J Ehrlich L.S Summers M.F Carter C Rossmann M.G >.Nature Structural Biology. 1996; 3: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Isolation of a soluble core domain by limited proteolysis of HIV-1 CA provided the technical breakthrough that led to the production of a protein preparation sufficiently well- behaved for structural analysis. The structure of the amino-terminal two-thirds of CA was solved by NMR (9Gitti R.K Lee B.M Walker J Summers M.F Yoo S Sundquist W.I >.Science. 1996; 273: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar); the X-ray structure of a complex between this same CA domain and CyPA has been determined (8Gamble T.R Vajdos F Yoo S Worthylake D.K Houseweart M Sundquist W.I Hill C.P >.Cell. 1996; 87 (this issue)Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar), and information missing from a crystal structure of a CA–Fab antibody complex has been provided (12Momany C Kovari L.C Prongay A.J Keller W Gitti R.K Lee B.M Gorbalenya A.E Tong L McClure J Ehrlich L.S Summers M.F Carter C Rossmann M.G >.Nature Structural Biology. 1996; 3: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). It had been widely suspected that retroviral CA would be an eight-stranded, antiparallel β-barrel, the structure common to the capsids of many viruses. CyPA is an eight-stranded, antiparallel β-barrel, and it was appealing to imagine the β-sheets of CA and CyPA packed in a regular array in virions. The actual results were not at all like the predictions: HIV-1 CA is a triangular pyramid composed almost entirely of α-helices (Figure 2A). One of the few nonhelical elements in CA is an exposed loop between helices IV and V that is thought to be located on the surface of the virion core (Figure 2A). The exposed loop corresponds to the proline-rich domain required for CyPA-binding (Franke, Yuan et al., 1994), and is the only part of CA contacting CyPA in the cocrystal (8Gamble T.R Vajdos F Yoo S Worthylake D.K Houseweart M Sundquist W.I Hill C.P >.Cell. 1996; 87 (this issue)Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). The critical G89 and P90 residues are prominently situated at the apex of the loop and are embedded deep in the hydrophobic pocket of CyPA. Though it is tempting to propose that CyPA catalyzes cis-trans isomerization of the bond connecting G89 and P90, this appears not to be the case: the bond is primarily trans in the free protein (9Gitti R.K Lee B.M Walker J Summers M.F Yoo S Sundquist W.I >.Science. 1996; 273: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar) and all trans as a complex with CyPA (8Gamble T.R Vajdos F Yoo S Worthylake D.K Houseweart M Sundquist W.I Hill C.P >.Cell. 1996; 87 (this issue)Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). The latter result is at odds with previous structural studies that had shown that model peptides will only fit within the CyPA hydrophobic pocket in the cis conformation. 8Gamble T.R Vajdos F Yoo S Worthylake D.K Houseweart M Sundquist W.I Hill C.P >.Cell. 1996; 87 (this issue)Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar suggest that the absence of a side chain at the residue preceding P90 allows CA to fit snugly within the pocket without distortion of the peptide backbone. Thus, CyPA must promote HIV-1 virion infectivity by forming a stable complex with CA, and not by catalyzing the peptidyl-prolyl isomerization of G89-P90. Cytoplasmic fractionation studies indicate that soon after entry HIV-1 CA dissociates from the viral nucleoprotein complex (7Gallay P Swingler S Aiken C Trono D >.Cell. 1995; 80: 379-388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Biochemical analyses such as this are difficult to interpret since the percentage of infectious particles within any population of retroviral virions is extremely small, and the biologically relevant fraction might not be detectable by biochemical methods; currently there are no methods for confirming that a given preparation of nucleoprotein complexes is capable of successfully completing an infection in vivo. Assuming that separation of CA from the viral nucleoprotein complex is required for productive infection, and given that CyPA is required for the initiation of reverse transcription (4Braaten D Franke E.K Luban J >.J. Virol. 1996; 70: 3551-3560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it would be reasonable to propose a model in which CyPA promotes HIV-1 CA uncoating (Figure 1) in a manner vaguely analogous to that of the chaperone Hsp70 in the uncoating of clathrin from coated vesicles (13Rothman J.E Schmid S.L >.Cell. 1986; 46: 5-9Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Elucidation of the biochemical role of CyPA in virion uncoating would be aided by a detailed map of the CA–CA interactions required for formation of the virion core. CA–CA contacts involving two CA faces were observed in the cocrystal with CyPA (8Gamble T.R Vajdos F Yoo S Worthylake D.K Houseweart M Sundquist W.I Hill C.P >.Cell. 1996; 87 (this issue)Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar), and the authors propose that contacts made by the third face would involve a type II tight turn located on the proline-rich loop, adjacent to the CyPA-binding site (Figure 2B). Binding of CyPA to the proline-rich loop would directly interfere with CA–CA interactions that involve the tight turn, weaken assembly of CA complexes, and allow the core to more readily dissociate during uncoating. This model predicts that core assembly would not only tolerate disruption of some CA–CA interactions by CyPA, but that significant reduction of the CyPA:CA ratio in virions from the observed 1:10 (6Franke E.K Yuan H.E.H Luban J >.Nature. 1994; 372: 359-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar, 15Thali M Bukovsky A.A Kondo E Rosenwirth B Walsh C.T Sodroski J Göttlinger H.G >.Nature. 1994; 372: 363-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar) would shift the balance towards a core that was too inflexible to uncoat. Indeed, a graded decrease in virion infectivity is observed in response to decreases in the CyPA:CA ratio (4Braaten D Franke E.K Luban J >.J. Virol. 1996; 70: 3551-3560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cyclosporine A-resistance of the A92E and G94D mutants is also explained by this model (3Braaten D Aberham C Franke E.K Yin L Phares W Luban J >.J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5170-5176Crossref PubMed Google Scholar): by disrupting the type II tight turn, the mutants would destabilize CA–CA interactions and allow uncoating to proceed in the absence of CyPA. The development of HIV-1 virion core purification methods, as well as assays for the infectivity of the purified cores, would provide a means by which one could directly test if CyPA promotes HIV-1 uncoating by destabilizing CA–CA interactions. Perhaps the greatest significance of these studies with HIV-1 CA is the contribution they make to our understanding of the role of CyPs. A growing collection of data indicates that a primary role of CyPs is to mediate protein–protein interactions. As a high-affinity complex with cyclosporine A, CyP creates a composite surface that inhibits calcineurin (14Schreiber S.L Crabtree G.R >.Immunology Today. 1992; 13: 136-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1880) Google Scholar). The Drosophila CyP NinaA forms a stable complex with the major isoform of rhodopsin that is required for this photoreceptor protein to exit the endoplasmic reticulum (2Baker E.K Colley N.J Zuker C.S >.EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4886-4895Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Now it has been demonstrated that HIV-1 replication requires the formation of a stable complex between CA and CyPA (4Braaten D Franke E.K Luban J >.J. Virol. 1996; 70: 3551-3560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Franke E.K Yuan H.E.H Luban J >.Nature. 1994; 372: 359-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar, 15Thali M Bukovsky A.A Kondo E Rosenwirth B Walsh C.T Sodroski J Göttlinger H.G >.Nature. 1994; 372: 363-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). The first CyPs to be cloned were simple molecules consisting of a core CyP domain and, at most, terminal extensions that direct subcellular localization. Recently, CyP family members have been identified which are components of large macromolecular complexes and possess several well-characterized motifs. Nup358/RanBP2, the largest nuclear pore component, constitutes the most dramatic example; in addition to a cyclophilin-homologous domain, this protein possesses a leucine-rich region, Ran-binding sites, nucleoporin-characteristic repeats, and zinc-fingers (16Wu J Matunis M.J Kraemer D Blobel G Coutavas E >.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14209-14213Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 17Yokohama N Hayashi N Seki T Pante N Ohba T Nishii K Kuma K Hayashida T Miyata T Aebi U Fukui M Nishimoto T >.Nature. 1995; 376: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). The identification of proteins such as this supports the contention that CyP functions as a modular protein–protein interaction cassette reminiscent of other protein subunits such as the Src homology domains."

Here, we compared the CYT-18 binding sites in the N. crassa mt LSU and ND1 introns with that in N. crassa mt tRNATyr by constructing three-dimensional models based on chemical modification and RNA footprinting data. Remarkably, superimposition of the CYT-18 binding sites in the model structures revealed an extended three-dimensional overlap between the tRNA and the group I intron catalytic core. Our results provide insight into how an RNA-splicing factor can evolve from a cellular RNA–binding protein. Further, the structural similarities between group I introns and tRNAs are consistent with an evolutionary relationship and suggest a general mechanism for the evolution of complex catalytic RNAs."
https://openalex.org/W2126972266,"Photopolymerizable diacrylate monomers dissolved in fluid-layer smectic A and smectic C liquid crystal (LC) hosts exhibited significant spatial segregation and orientation that depend strongly on monomer structure. Small, flexible monomers such as 1,6-hexanediol diacrylate (HDDA) oriented parallel to the smectic layers and intercalated, whereas rod-shaped mesogen-like monomers such as 1,4-di-(4-(6-acryloyloxyhexyloxy)benzoyloxy)-2-methylbenzene (C6M) oriented normal to the smectic layers and collected within them. Such spatial segregation caused by the smectic layering dramatically enhanced photopolymerization rates; for HDDA, termination rates were reduced, whereas for C6M, both the termination and propagation rates were increased. These polymerization precursor structures suggest novel materials-design paradigms for gel LCs and nanophase-separated polymer systems."
https://openalex.org/W2038125665,"Protein disulfide-isomerase (PDI) catalyzes the formation and isomerization of disulfides during oxidative protein folding in the eukaryotic endoplasmic reticulum. At high concentrations, it also serves as a chaperone and inhibits aggregation. However, at lower concentrations, PDI can display the unusual ability to facilitate aggregation, termed anti-chaperone activity (Puig, A., and Gilbert, H. F. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 7764-7771). Under reducing conditions (10 mM dithiothreitol) and at a low concentration (0.1-0.3 μM) relative to the unfolded protein substrate, PDI facilitates aggregation of alcohol dehydrogenase (11 μM) that has been denatured thermally or chemically. But at higher concentrations (>0.8 μM), PDI inhibits aggregation under the same conditions. With denatured citrate synthase, PDI does not facilitate aggregation, but higher concentrations do inhibit aggregation. Anti-chaperone behavior is associated with the appearance of both PDI and substrate proteins in insoluble complexes, while chaperone behavior results in the formation of large (>500 kDa) but soluble complexes that contain both proteins. Physiological concentrations of calcium and magnesium specifically increase the apparent rate of PDI-dependent aggregation and shift the chaperone activity to higher PDI concentrations. However, calcium has no effect on the Km or Vmax for PDI-catalyzed oxidative folding, suggesting that the interactions that lead to chaperone/anti-chaperone behavior are distinct from those required for catalytic activity. To account for this unusual behavior of a folding catalyst, a model with analogy to classic immunoprecipitation is proposed; multivalent interactions between PDI and a partially aggregated protein stimulate further aggregate formation by noncovalently cross-linking smaller aggregates. However, at high ratios of PDI to substrate, cross-linking may be inhibited by saturation of the sites with PDI. The effects of PDI concentration on substrate aggregation and the modulation of the behavior by physiological levels of calcium may have implications for the involvement of PDI in protein folding, aggregation, and retention in the endoplasmic reticulum.

INTRODUCTIONIn the cell, the coupling of protein folding with the formation and isomerization of protein disulfide bonds (oxidative folding) occurs in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). 1The abbreviations used are: ERendoplasmic reticulumPDIprotein disulfide-isomeraseBiPimmunoglobulin heavy chain-binding protein (grp78)DTTdithiothreitolADHalcohol dehydrogenaseHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisBSAbovine serum albumin. This specialized compartment provides high concentrations of a number of folding catalysts and chaperones along with a glutathione redox buffer (GSH and GSSG) that is significantly more oxidizing than that in the cytosol (1Hwang C. Sinskey A.J. Lodish H.F. Science. 1992; 257: 1496-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar). Compared with uncatalyzed, spontaneous oxidative folding, protein folding in the ER is rapid and efficient. Folding catalysts accelerate disulfide formation and rearrangement, while chaperones inhibit aggregation by binding exposed hydrophobic surfaces and preventing their interaction. In addition, an ER quality control system retains proteins in the ER until they are correctly folded (2Gething M.J. Sambrook J. Nature.. 1992; 355: 33-45Google Scholar).Protein disulfide-isomerase (PDI) is the most active catalyst of oxidative protein folding isolated to date (3Freedman R.B. Hirst T.R. Tuite M.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 331-336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 4Noiva R. Protein Expression Purif. 1994; 5: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 5Gilbert H.F. Pain R. Protein Folding. IRL Press Ltd., Oxford1994: 104-136Google Scholar). Although this 58-kDa enzyme functions catalytically, it is very abundant in the ER lumen. PDI concentrations of 0.2-0.5 mM have been estimated (6Hillson D.A. Lambert N. Freedman R.B. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 107: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 7Lyles M.M. Gilbert H.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 613-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar), levels that are comparable to or in excess of the levels of newly synthesized proteins (8Hartl F.U. Martin J. Neupert W. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1992; 21: 293-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). In addition to its catalytic activity, PDI functions as a chaperone when it is present at high concentrations relative to unfolded protein substrates (9Puig A. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7764-7771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Cai H. Wang C. Tsou C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24550-24552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Song J.L. Wang C.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 2: 312-316Crossref Google Scholar).The ER is also a major site for the storage of calcium and chaperones such as calreticulin, endoplasmin, and BiP (grp78). PDI binds calcium with low affinity (Kd = 2-5 mM) and high capacity (~19 mol/mol of PDI) (12Macer D. Koch G. J. Cell Sci. 1988; 91: 61-70Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Lebeche D. Lucero H.A. Kaminer B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 556-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Calcium depletion from the ER impairs folding (14Lodish H.F. Kong N. Wikstrom L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12753-12760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and interferes with the KDEL-mediated retention of ER proteins, including PDI (15Booth C. Koch G.L.E. Cell. 1989; 59: 729-737Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). However, calcium does not affect PDI activity when measured by its effect on the folding of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (16Zapun A. Creighton T.E. Rowling P.J.E. Freedman R.B. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1995; 14: 10-15Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar).Because PDI is expected to make folding more productive by increasing the folding rate and by inhibiting aggregation, it was surprising to find that under certain conditions, PDI facilitated aggregation, a behavior that we have called anti-chaperone activity (9Puig A. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7764-7771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-chaperone activity, which is observed only at low concentrations of PDI relative to unfolded protein, results in the formation of large, insoluble aggregates that contain PDI along with the unfolded protein. The activity is not due to disulfide cross-linking since anti-chaperone behavior is observed in the presence of the reducing agent dithiothreitol (DTT) (17Puig A. Lyles M.M. Noiva R. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19128-19135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ER chaperone BiP displays similar behavior. In addition, PDI and BiP incorporation into aggregates is specific and competitive, implying the involvement of a limited number of binding sites in co-aggregate formation (18Puig A. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25889-25896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Chaperone-associated protein aggregates are also found in cells when conditions favor substrate misfolding. A mutant human lysozyme expressed in mouse fibroblasts is retained in the ER and can be cross-linked to PDI (19Otsu M. Omura F. Yoshimori T. Kikuchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6874-6877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In Chinese hamster ovary cells, inhibition of disulfide formation by including DTT in the medium leads to the accumulation of very large chaperone-associated aggregates that are retained in the ER. When permissive folding conditions are restored, these ER-retained aggregates are rapidly cross-linked by disulfides and then reclaimed and folded into native structures (20Tatu U. Braakman I. Helenius A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2151-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 21Braakman I. Helenius J. Helenius A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1717-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). A similar observation has been made in HepG2 cells upon induction of thyroglobulin synthesis by thyroid hormones; the protein initially aggregates in the ER in association with specific chaperones before productive folding and secretion occur (22Kim P.S. Arvan P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4873-4879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Some of the effects of chaperone overexpression on protein secretion are quite puzzling. Overexpression of BiP or PDI in either mammalian cells (23Dorner A.J. Krane M. Kaufmann R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 123: 1355-1363Google Scholar) or yeast (24Robinson A.S. Wittrup K.D. Biotechnol. Prog. 1995; 11: 171-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) can result in increased or decreased secretion levels of coexpressed proteins. Intermediate levels of the yeast chaperone hsp104 are essential for transmission of the Ψ factor in yeast through a complex mechanism that may involve aggregation similar to that found with β-amyloid formation. Disruption of the hsp104 gene or its overexpression inhibits the process (25Chernoff Y.O. Lindquist S.L. Ono B. Inge-Vechtomov S.G. Liebman S.W. Science. 1995; 268: 880-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar).A better understanding of the protein aggregation problem is of obvious importance in the development of predictable high level expression systems for recombinant proteins (26King J. Haase-Pettingell C. Robinson A.S. Speed M. Mitraki A. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In addition, protein aggregation has been associated with the development of specific pathologies such as Alzheimer's disease, prion-mediated disease, and a host of others (27Thomas P.J. Qu B.H. Pederson P.L. Trends Biochem Sci. 1995; 20: 456-459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). The unusual behavior of PDI and BiP in facilitating in vitro aggregation and the observation of very large, chaperone-associated aggregates in cells raise the intriguing possibility that aggregation might actually be facilitated by chaperones under certain conditions.To begin to define the mechanisms by which PDI can behave as a chaperone under some conditions and as an anti-chaperone under others, we have examined the effects of PDI and other proteins on the aggregation of thermally and chemically denatured liver alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and citrate synthase, two proteins that do not require disulfides for folding. As in the oxidative refolding of lysozyme, PDI displays chaperone and anti-chaperone activity with ADH, but behaves only as a chaperone with citrate synthase. We also find that physiological levels of calcium increase the rate and extent of PDI-dependent aggregation and decrease the chaperone activity. A model, based on analogy to classical immunoprecipitation, is proposed that provides a basis for understanding the complex interactions of PDI with unfolded proteins and its behavior in both inhibiting and stimulating aggregation.

https://openalex.org/W2032731918,"Many amplified genes, including some oncogenes, are organized as large inverted repeats. How such giant palindromes are generated remains largely unknown. Recent studies of a palindrome in the ciliate Tetrahymena suggest a novel mechanism that requires chromosome breakage next to short inverted repeats. The prevalence of short inverted repeats in eukaryotic genomes raises the interesting possibility that this process may occur widely as a response to chromosome damage. Here we demonstrate that in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, large DNA palindromes are formed efficiently, probably by intramolecular recombination, when a double-strand break is introduced next to short inverted repeats. These results suggest a general mechanism for large palindromic DNA formation and reveal an important new source of genome instability resulting from chromosome breakage at selective sites."
https://openalex.org/W2084776925,"Genetic analyses of vacuolar protein sorting in Saccharomyces cerevisiae have uncovered a large number of mutants (vps) that missort and secrete soluble vacuolar hydrolases. Here we report the characterization of the gene product affected in one of these mutants, Vps8p. Polyclonal antiserum raised against a trpE-Vps8 fusion protein specifically detects a 134-kDa protein in labeled yeast cell extracts. Subcellular fractionation studies demonstrate that Vps8p is distributed between a low speed membrane pellet fraction and a high speed membrane pellet fraction. The lack of a hydrophobic domain in Vps8p suggests that Vps8p peripherally associates with a membrane(s). This association was found to depend on the function of Vps21p, a member of the Rab/Ypt/Sec4 family of small GTPases. In vps21 null mutant cells, Vps8p is found in the cytosol. In addition, overexpression of Vps21p partially suppresses a vps8 null mutant, indicating that Vps8p and Vps21p functionally interact. Vps8p contains a C-terminal cysteine-rich region that conforms to the H2 variant of the RING finger Zn2+ binding motif. Truncation of this C-terminal region partially compromises Vps8p function. While vps8 null mutant strains missort and secrete soluble vacuolar hydrolases, the integral vacuolar membrane protein, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), is sorted to the vacuole and matured normally. In addition, when vps8 mutants are combined with endocytic or late secretory pathway mutants (end3 or sec1, respectively), ALP is still delivered to the vacuole.

In mammalian cells, soluble lysosomal hydrolases enter the secretory pathway via translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 1The abbreviations used are: ERendoplasmic reticulumTGNtrans Golgi networkMPRmannose 6-phosphate receptorCPYcarboxypeptidase YYPDyeast extract-peptone-dextroseYPFyeast extract-peptone-fructoseSDsynthetic dextrosePrAproteinase AALPalkaline phosphatasePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresiskbkilobase pair(s). membrane. In the lumen of the ER, these proteins are modified with core oligosaccharides and are then transported to the Golgi complex. In the Golgi, the core oligosaccharides are further processed, including the specific addition of the mannose 6-phosphate recognition marker. When lysosomal proteins reach the trans Golgi network (TGN), they are selectively sorted away from the secretory protein pool; this sorting event is largely mediated by two receptors that recognize the mannose 6-phosphate carbohydrate modification (2Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 307-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). The mannose 6-phosphate receptors, or MPRs, and their coupled ligands are then packaged into clathrin-coated vesicles and delivered to a prelysosomal endosome. Receptor-ligand complexes dissociate in the endosome (probably due to the acidic environment of this compartment), and lysosomal proteins proceed to the lysosome, whereas the receptors recycle to the TGN for another round of sorting or are diverted to the plasma membrane to scavenge extracellular lysosomal proteins.Localization of soluble proteins to the lysosome-like vacuole of yeast follows a similar itinerary. This is exemplified by the delivery of the soluble vacuolar hydrolase carboxypeptidase Y (CPY) (3Klionsky D.J. Herman P.K. Emr S.D. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 266-292Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Stack J. Horazdovsky B. Emr S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 1-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). When CPY is translocated into the lumen of the yeast ER, it receives four core oligosaccharides, generating the p1 precursor form of the enzyme (5Stevens T. Esmon B. Schekman R. Cell. 1982; 30: 439-448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). p1CPY then transits the Golgi complex, where the core oligosaccharides are extended with additional mannose residues, generating the p2 precursor form of CPY. In a late Golgi compartment, probably analogous to the TGN, p2CPY binds the vacuolar protein sorting receptor Vps10p and is actively sorted away from secretory proteins and delivered to the vacuole via a prevacuolar endosome compartment (6Graham T.R. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 207-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 7Vida T.A. Huyer G. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1245-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Vps10p then recycles from the endosome to the Golgi for another round of sorting (8Cereghino J.L. Marcusson E.G. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1089-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 9Cooper A.A. Stevens T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 529-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), and p2CPY moves on to the vacuole. Upon arrival in the vacuole, the prosegment of p2CPY is removed, generating the mature active form of the enzyme (mCPY). However, unlike the MPRs, Vps10p does not recognize a carbohydrate modification but rather recognizes a peptide-sorting signal present at the N terminus of the CPY prosegment (10Johnson L.M. Bankaitis V.A. Emr S.D. Cell. 1987; 48: 875-885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 11Valls L.A. Hunter C.P. Rothman J.H. Stevens T.H.

Genetics. 1977; 85: 23-33Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Complementation analysis of the vps and pep mutants revealed an extensive genetic overlap. Together, the vps and pep mutants define more than 40 complementation groups, revealing the complex nature of the vacuolar protein sorting system (12Robinson J.S. Klionsky D.J. Banta L.M. Emr S.D.

Morphological analysis of the vps mutant collection has shown that these mutants fall into six classes, A-F (17Banta L.M. Robinson J.S. Klionsky D.J. Emr S.D. J.

Mutants in one of these classes, class D, contain a single, enlarged vacuole structure, are defective in the assembly of the vacuolar ATPase and are deficient in mother to daughter cell vacuole segregation (18Raymond C.K. Howald-Stevendon I. Vater C.A. Stevens T.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1389-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar).

Included in this group are several gene products (Vps21p, Vps45p, Pep12p) that have been implicated in vesicle targeting and/or fusion events in the Golgi to endosome step of this transport pathway. Vps21p is a small GTPase of the Rab family (21Horazdovsky B.F. Busch G.R. Emr S.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1297-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 25Singer-Kruger B. Stenmark H. Dusterhoft A. Philippsen P. Yoo J.S. Gallwitz D. Zerial M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), Vps45p is a Sec1 homologue (23Cowles C.R. Emr S.D. Horazdovsky B.F. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3449-3459PubMed Google Scholar, 26Piper R.C. Whitters E.C. Stevens T.H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 65: 305-318PubMed Google Scholar), and Pep12p (Vps6p) is a syntaxin homologue (27Becherer K.A. Rieder S.E. Emr S.D. Jones E.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 579-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Similar proteins have been found to be involved in vesicle targeting and/or fusion events in mammalian cells. A novel gene product affected in a class D mutant, Vps9p, has also been implicated in this Golgi-to-endosome vesicle targeting/fusion reaction as a potential modulator of Vps21p function (28Burd C.G. Mustol P.A. Shu P.V. Emr S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2369-2377Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar).Here we describe the VPS8 gene product that also appears to function in the vesicle targeting/fusion event. Although originally assigned to the class A vps mutant group (normal appearing vacuolar structure), cells that completely lack Vps8p function exhibit several of the class D mutant phenotypes, including a temperature-sensitive growth defect and a single, enlarged vacuole structure that is not properly acidified. Vps8p is a hydrophilic protein that is associated with a particulate cell fraction containing cellular membranes, and this association is dependent on the presence of the small GTPase, Vps21p. Furthermore, overexpression of Vps21p can partially bypass Vps8p function, suggesting that Vps8p may be a positive modulator of Vps21p function.DISCUSSIONThe work presented in this study describes the initial characterization of Vps8p. Vps8p is a hydrophilic 134-kDa protein required for the sorting of soluble vacuolar proteins. Cells that lack this protein missort and secrete the vast majority of the soluble vacuolar hydrolase CPY, while sorting of the vacuolar membrane protein, ALP, is unaffected. vps8Δ1 cells also exhibit a slow growth phenotype at 38°C and contain a slightly enlarged, single vacuolar structure. Interestingly, most of Vps8p is associated with a particulate cell fraction that contains cellular membranes, even though the protein lacks any obvious hydrophobic domains that could serve as a transmembrane domain. This association is dependent on the presence of the small GTPase, Vps21p. Furthermore, overexpression of this GTPase partially suppresses the need for Vps8p function. Together these data indicate: 1) Vps8p participates in the transport of soluble vacuolar proteins from the Golgi to the prevacuolar endosome, 2) Vps8p may modulate Vps21p function, and 3) Vps8p may directly interact with Vps21p.Morphological analysis has allowed the classification of the vps mutants into distinct groups. Though vps8 mutant alleles were originally classified as class A (containing a normal appearing vacuolar compartment), vps8 null mutant cells exhibit several class D mutant phenotypes, distinguishing them from other class A vps mutants (18Raymond C.K. Howald-Stevendon I. Vater C.A. Stevens T.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1389-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). These phenotypes include the missorting of multiple soluble vacuolar proteins, a slight accumulation of aberrantly processed soluble vacuolar hydrolases, temperature sensitive growth at 38°C, as well as a single, enlarged vacuolar structure that shows a decreased number of mother-to-daughter vacuole segregation structures and an acidification defect. Many of the wild-type VPS gene products affected in the class D mutants have been implicated in the vesicle-mediated transport of vacuolar proteins from the Golgi to the prevacuolar endosome. The Vps15p-Vps34p protein kinase-lipid kinase complex appears to play a role in the packaging and/or formation of intermediate transport vesicles at the surface of the Golgi (4Stack J. Horazdovsky B. Emr S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 1-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 57Stack J.H. Herman P.K. Schu P.V. Emr S.D. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2195-2204Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The small GTPase of the Rab family, Vps21p (21Horazdovsky B.F. Busch G.R. Emr S.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1297-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 25Singer-Kruger B. Stenmark H. Dusterhoft A. Philippsen P. Yoo J.S. Gallwitz D. Zerial M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), and the Sec1p homologue, Vps45p (23Cowles C.R. Emr S.D. Horazdovsky B.F. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3449-3459PubMed Google Scholar, 26Piper R.C. Whitters E.C. Stevens T.H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 65: 305-318PubMed Google Scholar), appear to participate in the targeting and/or fusion of these transport vesicles with the endosome. The newly characterized gene product of VPS9 also appears to function in this vesicle transport event and may be involved in modulating Vps21p activity (28Burd C.G. Mustol P.A. Shu P.V. Emr S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2369-2377Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In addition, Pep12p (Vps6p), a syntaxin homologue, is part of the class D group and likely mediates the docking of Golgi-derived transport vesicles with the prevacuolar endosome (27Becherer K.A. Rieder S.E. Emr S.D. Jones E.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 579-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The genetic interaction between VPS21 and VPS8 described here clearly implicates Vps8p function at the Golgi-to-endosome step in the vacuolar protein delivery pathway.Clues as to the specific function of Vps8p in vacuolar protein sorting come from the observation that overexpression of Vps21p can partially bypass Vps8p function. One interpretation of this result is that Vps8p is a positive modulator of Vps21p function. Simply by increasing the overall levels of Vps21p in the cell, the function of Vps8p would be abrogated. Since Vps21p is a member of the Rab family of small GTPases, a number of activities that regulate its function may be envisioned. Vps8p could serve as a nucleotide exchange factor, enhancing Vps21p intrinsic nucleotide exchange rate and facilitating the conversion of Vps21p in its GDP-bound form to its GTP-bound form. Since Vps21p possesses a relatively high intrinsic nucleotide exchange activity, 2B. Horazdovsky, unpublished results. overexpression of this GTPase may provide the cell with enough Vps21p in its GTP-bound form to facilitate vacuolar protein sorting. A number of nucleotide exchange factors for members of the Rab, Ras, Rho, and Arf families of small GTPases have been described. However, Vps8p shares no significant sequence homology with these GEFs, and Vps8p-dependent nucleotide exchange activity has yet to be demonstrated. Alternatively, Vps8p may modulate Vps21p function by facilitating the interaction of Vps21p with other cellular component(s). For example, Vps8p may not be an exchange factor but may mediate the interaction between Vps21p and an exchange factor.The similar subcellular fractionation pattern between Vps21p and Vps8p, as well as the dependence of Vps8p's membrane association on the presence of Vps21p, indicates that these two proteins physically interact with one another (directly or indirectly) and associate with similar membrane pools. In this regard, Vps21p may recruit Vps8p to the membrane in a manner analogous to the recruitment of Rabaptin-5 by Rab5 (58Stenmark H. Vitale G. Ullrich O. Zerial M. Cell. 1995; 83: 423-432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar) or Rabphilin-3A by Rab3A (59Shirataki H. Kaibuchi K. Sakoda T. Kishida S. Yamaguchi T. Wada K. Miyazaki M. Takai Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2061-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 60Stahl B. Chou J.H. Li C. Südhof T.C. Jahn R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 809-1799Crossref Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Though sequence comparisons fail to reveal any extensive homology between Vps8p and Rabaptin-5 or Rabphilin-3A, Rabphilin-3A does contain a Cys-rich amino-terminal domain (four pairs of Cys-X2-Cys) (59Shirataki H. Kaibuchi K. Sakoda T. Kishida S. Yamaguchi T. Wada K. Miyazaki M. Takai Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2061-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 61Li C. Takei K. Geppert M. Daniell L. Stenius K. Chapman E.R. Jahn R. Deammilli P. Südhor T.C.

Wada K. Numata S. Kaibuchi K. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27164-27170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, Vps8p's Cys-rich RING finger domain may facilitate its interaction with Vps21p and/or other proteins. Consistent with this hypothesis, a truncated Vps8p lacking the Cys-rich motif exhibited reduced function. Closer examination of the interaction between Vps8p and Vps21p, as well as the membrane fraction with which Vps8p is associated, will be required to determine the potential role Vps8p plays in modulating Vps21p function.Interestingly, Vps8p function is required for only the sorting of soluble vacuolar proteins; the localization of the vacuolar membrane protein, ALP, is unaffected in vps8Δ1 cells. A similar differential protein sorting phenotype has also been seen in vps1 mutant cells (52Nothwehr S.F. Conibear E. Stevens T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). VPS1 codes for a high molecular weight GTPase that shows extensive homology with dynamin (63Vater C.A. Raymond C.K. Ekena K. Howaldstevenson I. Stevens T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 773-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Members of the dynamin family have been implicated in the formation of transport vesicles in mammalian cells and in yeast (64Takei K. McPherson P.S. Schmid S.L. DeCamilli P. Nature. 1995; 374: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar, 65Hinshaw J.E. Schmid S.L. Nature. 1995; 374: 190-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). Like vps8 mutants, cells that lack Vps1p missort and secrete a large portion of the soluble vacuolar protein CPY but deliver ALP to the vacuole (52Nothwehr S.F. Conibear E. Stevens T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In the case of vps1 mutants, ALP is delivered to the vacuole via the plasma membrane. One explanation of this result is that the loss of Vps1p function results in the mislocalization of vacuolar membrane proteins to the cell surface where they are subsequently delivered to the vacuole through the endocytic pathway (52Nothwehr S.F. Conibear E. Stevens T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). However, the localization of ALP in vps8 mutants that also contained the sec1 or end3 temperature sensitive mutation demonstrated that delivery of ALP in these mutants does not involve transit via the plasma membrane. ALP is delivered to the vacuole despite the fact that movement to (sec1) and from (end3) the plasma membrane is blocked in the vps1/sec1 and vps8/end3 double mutants. One possibility is that vacuolar membrane proteins like ALP may utilize a different transport intermediate whose delivery is not dependent on Vps8p function. Our current studies are directed toward dissecting the transport system utilized for the delivery of vacuolar membrane proteins.Work with the Vps proteins affected in the class D vps mutants already has provided many new insights into the formation of Golgi-derived transport vesicles as well as the targeting and fusion of these vesicles with the prevacuolar endosome. Many of these proteins have been found to share significant sequence homologies with other proteins known to participate at other vesicle-mediated transport events throughout the secretory and endocytic pathways. This conservation suggests that many of the basic functions involved in vesicle targeting events are carried out by distinct sets of related proteins (66Bennett M.K. Scheller R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2559-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar, 67Rothman J.E. Orci L. Nature. 1992; 355: 409-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). Some of these components are shared (e.g. NSF), while others, though related, are specific to discrete vesicle targeting events (e.g. Rabs, Sec1 homologues, and SNAREs). Among these groups of proteins, Vps8p appears to be unique (no homologues yet identified). Determining Vps8p's precise function in the vacuolar protein sorting pathway therefore should provide additional insights into the mechanisms and regulation of vesicular trafficking events. INTRODUCTIONIntracellular protein localization is carried out by specific and often highly regulated delivery systems. One of the best characterized is the lysosomal hydrolase sorting pathway (1Kornfeld S. Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol... 1989; 5: 483-525Google Scholar, 2Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 307-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, soluble lysosomal hydrolases enter the secretory pathway via translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 1The abbreviations used are: ERendoplasmic reticulumTGNtrans Golgi networkMPRmannose 6-phosphate receptorCPYcarboxypeptidase YYPDyeast extract-peptone-dextroseYPFyeast extract-peptone-fructoseSDsynthetic dextrosePrAproteinase AALPalkaline phosphatasePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresiskbkilobase pair(s). membrane. In the lumen of the ER, these proteins are modified with core oligosaccharides and are then transported to the Golgi complex. In the Golgi, the core oligosaccharides are further processed, including the specific addition of the mannose 6-phosphate recognition marker. When lysosomal proteins reach the trans Golgi network (TGN), they are selectively sorted away from the secretory protein pool; this sorting event is largely mediated by two receptors that recognize the mannose 6-phosphate carbohydrate modification (2Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 307-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). The mannose 6-phosphate receptors, or MPRs, and their coupled ligands are then packaged into clathrin-coated vesicles and delivered to a prelysosomal endosome. Receptor-ligand complexes dissociate in the endosome (probably due to the acidic environment of this compartment), and lysosomal proteins proceed to the lysosome, whereas the receptors recycle to the TGN for another round of sorting or are diverted to the plasma membrane to scavenge extracellular lysosomal proteins.Localization of soluble proteins to the lysosome-like vacuole of yeast follows a similar itinerary. This is exemplified by the delivery of the soluble vacuolar hydrolase carboxypeptidase Y (CPY) (3Klionsky D.J. Herman P.K. Emr S.D. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 266-292Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Stack J. Horazdovsky B. Emr S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 1-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). When CPY is translocated into the lumen of the yeast ER, it receives four core oligosaccharides, generating the p1 precursor form of the enzyme (5Stevens T. Esmon B. Schekman R. Cell. 1982; 30: 439-448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). p1CPY then transits the Golgi complex, where the core oligosaccharides are extended with additional mannose residues, generating the p2 precursor form of CPY. In a late Golgi compartment, probably analogous to the TGN, p2CPY binds the vacuolar protein sorting receptor Vps10p and is actively sorted away from secretory proteins and delivered to the vacuole via a prevacuolar endosome compartment (6Graham T.R. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 207-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 7Vida T.A. Huyer G. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1245-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Vps10p then recycles from the endosome to the Golgi for another round of sorting (8Cereghino J.L. Marcusson E.G. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1089-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 9Cooper A.A. Stevens T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 529-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), and p2CPY moves on to the vacuole. Upon arrival in the vacuole, the prosegment of p2CPY is removed, generating the mature active form of the enzyme (mCPY). However, unlike the MPRs, Vps10p does not recognize a carbohydrate modification but rather recognizes a peptide-sorting signal present at the N terminus of the CPY prosegment (10Johnson L.M. Bankaitis V.A. Emr S.D. Cell. 1987; 48: 875-885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 11Valls L.A. Hunter C.P. Rothman J.H. Stevens T.H.

Included in this group are several gene products (Vps21p, Vps45p, Pep12p) that have been implicated in vesicle targeting and/or fusion events in the Golgi to endosome step of this transport pathway. Vps21p is a small GTPase of the Rab family (21Horazdovsky B.F. Busch G.R. Emr S.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1297-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 25Singer-Kruger B. Stenmark H. Dusterhoft A.

Cell. 1996; 7: 579-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Similar proteins have been found to be involved in vesicle targeting and/or fusion events in mammalian cells. A novel gene product affected in a class D mutant, Vps9p, has also been implicated in this Golgi-to-endosome vesicle targeting/fusion reaction as a potential modulator of Vps21p function (28Burd C.G. Mustol P.A. Shu P.V. Emr S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2369-2377Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar).Here we describe the VPS8 gene product that also appears to function in the vesicle targeting/fusion event. Although originally assigned to the class A vps mutant group (normal appearing vacuolar structure), cells that completely lack Vps8p function exhibit several of the class D mutant phenotypes, including a temperature-sensitive growth defect and a single, enlarged vacuole structure that is not properly acidified. Vps8p is a hydrophilic protein that is associated with a particulate cell fraction containing cellular membranes, and this association is dependent on the presence of the small GTPase, Vps21p. Furthermore, overexpression of Vps21p can partially bypass Vps8p function, suggesting that Vps8p may be a positive modulator of Vps21p function."

These electrons may be responsible for the x-rays from comet C/Hyakutake 1996 B2 seen by the Röntgen X-ray Satellite. The inferred x-ray photon power depends on the electron energy, with keV electrons providing values of photon power two orders of magnitude greater than 100 eV electrons.

https://openalex.org/W2079563507,"Oral administration of rabbit secretory IgA (sIgA) to adult BALB/c mice induced IgA+, IgM+, and IgG+ lymphoblasts in the Peyer's patches, whose fusion with myeloma cells resulted in hybridomas producing IgA, IgM, and IgG1 antibodies to the secretory component (SC). This suggests that SC could serve as a vector to target protective epitopes into mucosal lymphoid tissue and elicit an immune response. We tested this concept by inserting a Shigella flexneri invasin B epitope into SC, which, following reassociation with IgA, was delivered orally to mice. To identify potential insertion sites at the surface of SC, we constructed a molecular model of the first and second Ig-like domains of rabbit SC. A surface epitope recognized by an SC-specific antibody was mapped to the loop connecting the E and F β strands of domain I. This 8-amino acid sequence was replaced by a 9-amino acid linear epitope from S. flexneri invasin B. We found that cellular trafficking of recombinant SC produced in mammalian CV-1 cells was drastically altered and resulted in a 50-fold lower rate of secretion. However, purification of chimeric SC could be achieved by Ni2+-chelate affinity chromatoraphy. Both wild-type and chimeric SC bound to dimeric IgA, but not to monomeric IgA.

Thus, neo-antigenized sIgA can serve as a mucosal vaccine delivery system inducing systemic and mucosal immune responses. The protection of the mucosal surfaces of the digestive, respiratory, and urogenital tracts is in part mediated by secretory IgA (sIgA). 1The abbreviations used are: sIgAsecretory IgAIgAddimeric IgAIgAmmonomeric IgApIgRpolymeric immunoglobulin receptorSCsecretory componentVVvaccinia virusrVVrecombinant VV; MDCK cells, Madin-Darby canine kidney cellsIpaBinvasin plasmid antigen BPBSphosphate-buffered salinePCRpolymerase chain reactionPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisCDRcomplementary determining regionELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assaymAbmonoclonal antibodypAbpolyclonal antiserabpbase pairTKthymidine kinaseCTcholera toxin. This antibody consists of IgA dimers associated with the J chain, which is acquired during the process of polymerization in plasma cells just before secretion, and with the secretory component (SC). SC is derived from the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR), which binds and transports polymeric immunoglobulins across mucosal and glandular epithelia. Proteolytic cleavage of the extracellular portion of the receptor releases SC together with the bound IgA into mucosal secretions (1Neutra M.R. Michetti P. Kraehenbuhl J.-P. Johnson L.R. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract.in: Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 685Google Scholar). SC belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily of proteins and consists of a series of five Ig-like domains corresponding to the ectoplasmic portion of the poly-Ig receptor (2Mostov K.E. Friedlander M.

In addition to the protection of mucosal surfaces by cross-linking pathogens and promoting their clearance by peristalsis or mucociliary movement, sIgA in the intestinal lumen also selectively adheres to M cells. This was first observed in suckling rabbits as a local accumulation of milk sIgA on M cells of Peyer's patches (6Roy M.J. Varvayanis M. Cell Tissue Res. 1987; 248: 645-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Subsequently, monoclonal mouse IgA, polyclonal rat IgA, and polyclonal IgG antibodies, radiolabeled or coupled to colloidal gold, were found to bind specifically to rabbit or mouse M cells and to compete with each other for binding sites (7Weltzin R. Lucia-Jandris P. Fields B.N. Kraehenbuhl J.-P. Neutra M.R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 108: 1673-1685Crossref Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Selective sIgA binding and transport by M cells may play a role in the regulation of the mucosal immune response, but that role has not yet been defined. Thus, while sIgA would generally prevent the contact of antigens with mucosal surfaces, it could also promote re-uptake of small amounts of antigen by M cells. The fact that orally administered sIgAs are efficiently transported by M cells in Peyer's patches raises the possibility that sIgA itself could serve as a vaccine delivery vector to target foreign epitopes into mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue. However, this would require that the foreign epitope be inserted without affecting the molecular folding of SC or the assembly and the function of sIgA. Also, the site of insertion must be surface-exposed, and the inserted epitope must be immunogenic. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of such an approach. We selected rabbit SC for epitope insertion because 1) the cDNA for the SC portion of pIgR was available (4Schaerer E. Verrey F. Racine L. Talichet C. Rheinhardt M. Kraehenbuhl J.-P. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 987-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), 2) SC was shown not to perturb the binding of sIgA to the antigen (8Lüllau E. Heyse S. Vogel H. Marison I. von Stockar U. Kraehenbuhl J.-P. Corthésy B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16300-16309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), 3) SC and IgAd can combine to form sIgA in vitro (9Rindisbacher L. Cottet S. Wittek R. Kraehenbuhl J.-P. Corthésy B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14220-14228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and 4) a battery of monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies to SC is available to map the possible effects of epitope substitution on protein structure (see Table I). Our results first show a so far not identified function of domain I in the process of SC secretion, which nonetheless did not preclude either overexpression or IgA binding of chimeric SC. Second, oral immunization with “antigenized” sIgA elicits both a systemic and mucosal response against the inserted epitope, thereby suggesting that recombinant SC·IgA complexes could serve as a mucosal vaccine delivery system.Table IAntisera and monoclonal antibodies used in this studyAntiserum/antibodyTargetDetectionReferencesGoat pAb 982SC, plgR, slgAELISA, IP, WesternSolari et al., 1985 (42Solari R.

Primary antibody binding was detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:3,000) and the chemioluminescence detection reagent (Amersham Life Sciences). The concentrations of purified SC and IgAd/IgAm concentrations were measured as described in Rindisbacher et al. (9Rindisbacher L. Cottet S. Wittek R. Kraehenbuhl J.-P. Corthésy B. J. Biol.

Standard curves for IgA were obtained using purified IgAd from ascitic fluid, and SC standards were generated using rabbit pIgR purified from liver. MDCK cells grown to confluence on Transwell filters were washed twice with PBS and fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. After two PBS washes, free aldehyde groups were quenched with 50 mM NH4Cl in PBS for 10 min. The cells were permeabilized with 0.05% saponin in PBS, 0.2% bovine serum albumin for 10 min; this solution was used to dilute the antibodies in all subsequent steps. The preparations were incubated with IgG (20 μg/ml) purified from anti-SC pAb 982 for 30 min. After extensive washes with PBS, filters were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham; 1:100), and finally mounted on glass slides in PBS, 90% glycerol, 3% n-propyl gallate. Preparations were examined under a Zeiss photomicroscope and/or by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Four 6-week-old BALB/c mice were immunized three times at days 1, 14, and 21 by injection into the lumen of a jejunal loop containing a Peyer's patch. The injectate consisted of rabbit whey (50 μl diluted 1:1 with PBS) containing about 50 μg of both IgA-bound and free SC. Before the first injection, the mice were treated for 3 days with Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (10 ng/ml) in the drinking water to stimulate mucosal inductive sites. At day 23, mice were sacrificed, and lymphocytes from Peyer's patches were recovered and fused to P3UI myeloma cells using the procedure of Weltzin et al. (7Weltzin R. Lucia-Jandris P. Fields B.N. Kraehenbuhl J.-P. Neutra M.R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 108: 1673-1685Crossref Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The supernatants of hybridomas were screened by ELISA and Western blotting. A model for the first and second domain of the rabbit pIgR was constructed using the approach described by Coyne et al. (12Coyne R.S. Siebrecht M. Peitsch M.C. Casanova J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31620-31625Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The quality of the model was assessed by the three-dimensional/one-dimensional profile matching procedure of Lüthy (13Lüthi R. Bowie J.U. Eisenberg D. Nature. 1992; 356: 83-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (2485) Google Scholar). A rabbit pIgR cDNA fragment (allele t61) was recovered from plasmid pSC-11 (4Schaerer E. Verrey F. Racine L. Talichet C. Rheinhardt M. Kraehenbuhl J.-P. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 987-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) by HindIII/SauI digestion. The 1082-bp fragment served as a template for two PCRs aiming at the insertion of two unique restriction sites for subsequent sequence replacement within domain I of the rabbit SC clone. In the first reaction, an AccI site (bold characters) was created at position 418 using oligonucleotides 5ʹ-GGGAAGATCTTCTAAGTATACCACAAACTCCCCTTTTTCAGGGAAGTC-3ʹ (hybridizing sequence, 429-394) and 5ʹ-AAGAGGAGAGCGGCCGCTGCGTGA-3ʹ (hybridizing sequence, 314-337). In order to facilitate subsequent ligation of PCR products, the 5ʹ-primer comprised the unique NotI site at position 324, and the 3ʹ-primer carried a 5ʹ-end BglII site. In the second reaction, an MroI site (bold characters) was inserted at position 453 using oligonucleotides 5ʹ-GGGAAGATCTTCGACTCCGGAAGCTACAAGTGTGGCGTGGGAGTC-3ʹ (hybridizing sequence, 448-480) and 5ʹ-GCACATTCAAAGGTCACCGAGCCCC-3ʹ (hybridizing sequence, 905-881). To allow subsequent cloning steps, a BglII site was added at the 5ʹ-end of the 5ʹ-primer, and the 3ʹ-primer was selected because it contained the unique BstEII site at position 888. The 128- and 469-bp PCR products digested with BglII were ligated together, then digested with NotI and BstEII, and finally inserted into pSC-11 treated with the same two enzymes, resulting in the obtention of pSC-11(A/M). PCR-derived inserts were sequenced by the method of Sanger et al. (14Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52243) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides coding for the Shigella invasin B (IpaB) epitope (KDRTLIEQK) were synthesized with a 5ʹ AccI half site (coding strand, 5ʹ-ATACAAAGACAGGACATTGATTGAGCAGAAAT-3ʹ) and a 3ʹ MroI half site (non-coding strand, 5ʹ-CCGGATTTCTGCTCAATAACTGTCCTGTCTTTGT-3ʹ). Following annealing, the hybrid was introduced into the newly created AccI and MroI sites of plasmid pSC-11(A/M). The resulting construct is referred to as pSC(IpaB). Epitope insertion was performed by inserting the fragment NotI-(324)/SalI-(1834) recovered from pSC(IpaB) into pLKneo-PIR (15Hirt R. Hughes Poulain-Godefroy O. Billotte J. Kraehenbuhl J.-P. Fasel N. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 111: 199-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) digested with the same two enzymes. The resulting construct was called pLKneo-PIR(IpaB). The insertion plasmids for generating rVVs were constructed as follows. Plasmid pSC-11 was digested with NcoI at position 122 and SalI at position 1834 (putative C terminus (2Mostov K.E. Friedlander M. Blobel G. Nature.. 1984; 308: 37-43Google Scholar)). The NcoI and SalI sites were blunted using Mungbean exonuclease, and the fragment was ligated into the blunted EcoRI site of pHGS1 (16Bertholet C. Drillien R. Wittek R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This resulted in the in-frame fusion of the 11K ATG to the second codon of the SC coding region. Addition of a C-terminal 6-histidine tag was carried out by annealing of oligonucleotides 5ʹ-CTCATCACCATCACCATCACTAAAGATCTCGAGTGTAC-3ʹ (coding strand) and 5ʹ-ACTCGAGATCTTTAGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGAGGTAC-3ʹ, followed by insertion into the KpnI site located 3 bp upstream of the SalI site of pHGS1-SC. The sequence encoded 6 histidine residues, a translational termination codon, as well as XhoI and BglII sites to determine the orientation. The resulting plasmid was designated pHGS1-SC6xHis. Plasmid pHGS1-SC(IpaB)6xHis encoding antigenized SC was obtained by cleaving plasmid pHGS1-SC6xHis with NotI and BstEII and replacing the fragment by the corresponding mutated fragment coming from plasmid pSC(IpaB). Recombinant viruses vvHGS1-SC6xHis and vvHGS1-SC(IpaB)6xHis were generated by homologous recombination into the TK gene of constructs pHGS1-SC6xHis and pHGS1-SC(IpaB)6xHis as described (9Rindisbacher L.

Integration of the SC gene construct in the viral genome was checked by PCR after each round of plaque purification using the upstream primer 5ʹ-GCTACGCTAGTCACAATCACCAC-3ʹ and the downstream primer 5ʹ-GTCCCATCGAGTGCGGCTAC-3ʹ. The amplification of a 1907-bp band confirmed the presence of the recombinant gene. Stationary phase CV-1 cells at a density of 2 x 107 cells/175 cm2 T-flask were washed with PBS and infected with rVVs expressing SC or SC(IpaB) at a multiplicity of infection of 2. Infected cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in the absence of serum and antibiotics for 24 h. The culture supernatant was recovered by centrifugation at 120 x g for 15 min, and purification of secreted recombinant SC proteins was performed by Ni2+-chelate affinity chromatography according to the procedure given in Rindisbacher et al. (9Rindisbacher L. Cottet S. Wittek R. Kraehenbuhl J.-P. Corthésy B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14220-14228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The interaction between recombinant SC and IgA was determined by dot blot reassociation assay as described in Rindisbacher et al. (9Rindisbacher L. Cottet S. Wittek R. Kraehenbuhl J.-P. Corthésy B.

The procedure is based on the technique developed by Hirt et al. (10Hirt R. Hughes G.J. Frutiger S. Michetti P. Perregaux C. Poulain-Godefroy O. Jeanguenat N. Neutra M.R. Kraehenbuhl J.-P.

MDCK cells stably transfected with a pLKneo vector containing the wild-type or antigenized rabbit pIgR cDNAs were induced to express the receptor with 1 x 10-6M dexamethasone or left unstimulated. Accumulation of IgA and SC in both the apical and basolateral compartments was measured 24 h post-induction by ELISA. Transcytosis was expressed in ng, respectively, μg of protein/24 h/filter. 350 μg of SC(IpaB) and SC(wt) were associated in vitro with 1.75 mg of IgAd purified from ZAC3 hybridoma (8Lüllau E.

Reconstituted IgAd·SC complexes were purified by FPLC onto a 140 x 1.6 cm Superdex 200 column (8Lüllau E. Heyse S. Vogel H. Marison I. von Stockar U. Kraehenbuhl J.-P. Corthésy B. J. Biol.

Fractions containing the reconstituted sIgA were pooled and concentrated by filtration using Centriprep-50 units (Amicon, Inc.) equilibrated in PBS. IgAd·SC antibodies were sterilized by passage through a 0.2-μm pore size Acrodisc filter (Gelman Sciences) and stored at 4°C until use. 100 μg of wild-type and chimerized IgAd-SC antibodies were mixed with 10 μg of cholera toxin (Calbiochem) and administered in 200 μl of PBS into germ-free BALB/c mice by intragastric intubation via PE10 polyethylene tubing connected to a 1-ml syringe. Two groups of three mice were challenged 4 times at day 1, 10, 44, and 51, and blood and saliva were collected 10 days after the last immunization. Biological fluids were kept frozen until use. Secretory IgA is known to bind to M cells and to be transported into the underlying organized mucosal lymphoid tissue (7Weltzin R. Lucia-Jandris P. Fields B.N. Kraehenbuhl J.-P. Neutra M.R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 108: 1673-1685Crossref Scopus (175) Google Scholar). To determine whether orally administered sIgA from rabbit whey was taken up and processed in mouse Peyer's patches, we recovered Peyer's patch lymphoblasts from immunized animals, fused them with myeloma partners (7Weltzin R. Lucia-Jandris P. Fields B.N. Kraehenbuhl J.-P. Neutra M.R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 108: 1673-1685Crossref Scopus (175) Google Scholar), and screened the hybridoma cells for production of immunoglobulins specific for rabbit SC and sIgA. Out of 60 hybridoma clones, 10 reacted with SC by ELISA, out of which 4 recognized free and bound SC in rabbit whey on Western blots. One clone produced polymeric IgM, two clones secreted IgG1, and one clone secreted IgA. IgA from clone 36.4 recognized both free and IgA-bound SC blotted on nitrocellulose membrane (Fig. 1, lane 3), but only recognized immunoprecipitated free SC when immobilized on Sepharose beads (Fig. 1, lane 4). This indicates that mucosally administered sIgA is able to elicit both a mucosal and systemic immune response against SC. In order to identify sites in the SC polypeptide that would be suitable for epitope insertion, we constructed a molecular model for the first and second immunoglobulin-like domain of rabbit SC (Fig. 2). The three-dimensional structure of two IgG κ light chains and the first domain of CD4 T cell accessory molecule were used to build the molecular model, which was subsequently used to select a site at the surface of rabbit SC to insert a foreign epitope. In rabbit, three distinct SC alleles, t61, t62, and t63, have been identified (17Knight K.L. Rosenzweig M. Lichter E.A. Hanly W.C. J. Immunol. 1974; 112: 877-882PubMed Google Scholar, 18Hanly C.W. Cook L. Kingzette M. Cox W. Frutiger S. Hughes G.J. Jaton J.-C. J. Immunol. 1987; 139: 1597-1601PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular model indicates that an 8-amino acid long sequence extending from leucine 79 to aspartic acid 86 (Fig. 3A) with the strongest allelic variation (>60% divergence when compared with other regions (2Mostov K.E. Friedlander M. Blobel G. Nature.. 1984; 308: 37-43Google Scholar, 4Schaerer E. Verrey F. Racine L. Talichet C. Rheinhardt M. Kraehenbuhl J.-P. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 987-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar)) is located within the loop connecting the E and F β strands. The loop is opposite to the stretches corresponding to the immunoglobulin-like complementary determining regions (CDR) involved in IgA binding (12Coyne R.S. Siebrecht M. Peitsch M.C. Casanova J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31620-31625Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We reasoned that since the loop tolerates important sequence variations, it might represent an ideal site for foreign epitope insertion. In order to confirm that the loop indeed corresponded to the allele-specific epitope, we tested the ability of a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 76-87 to compete with binding of a t61 allele-specific antiserum raised in t62 rabbits (17Knight K.L. Rosenzweig M. Lichter E.A. Hanly W.C. J. Immunol. 1974; 112: 877-882PubMed Google Scholar) against purified rabbit SC. The antiserum was incubated with 0, 140, or 280 ng of peptide, and the degree of competition was assessed by Western blotting and quantitated by scanning (Fig. 3B). Under non-reducing conditions, binding of the t61 allele-specific antibody to rabbit t61 SC was only partially competed by the peptide. Competition was complete under reducing conditions, yet the affinity of the antibody for reduced SC is known to be lower (17Knight K.L. Rosenzweig M. Lichter E.A. Hanly W.C. J. Immunol. 1974; 112: 877-882PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that the anti-t61 antiserum recognizes a discontinuous surface epitope that includes all or part of the loop. Several of the genes involved in invasion of cultured cells by Shigella flexneri have been identified and designated as ipa for “invasion plasmid antigen” (19Maurelli A.T. Baudry B. d'Hauteville H. Hale T.L. Sansonetti P.J. Infect. Immun. 1985; 49: 164-171Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Baudry B. Maurelli A.T. Clerc P. Sadoff J.C. Sansonetti P.J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1987; 133: 3403-3413PubMed Google Scholar). The IpaB protein is exposed on the bacterial surface and results in antibody production in infected animals (21Phalipon A. Arondel J. Nato F. Rouyre S. Mazie J.C. Sansonetti P.J. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 1919-1926Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For insertion into SC, we selected the immunodominant linear B cell epitope consisting of residues Lys-Asp-Arg-Thr-Leu-Ile-Glu-Gln-Lys of IpaB (22Barzu S. Nato F. Rouyre S. Mazie J.C. Sansonetti P.J. Phalipon A. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 3825-3831Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This sequence changed the length of the original loop by only a single amino acid, is specifically recognized by mAb H10 (22Barzu S. Nato F. Rouyre S. Mazie J.C. Sansonetti P.J. Phalipon A. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 3825-3831Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and remains accessible in the context of a β-galactosidase-IpaB fusion protein containing the entire IpaB polypeptide (Fig. 3C, lane 3). Rabbit SC cDNA was engineered to contain the coding sequences for amino acids 1-571 fused to a C-terminal histidine hexamer tag (Fig. 4A). Following cloning into VV insertion plasmid pHGS1 (16Bertholet C. Drillien R. Wittek R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 2096-2100Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), the fragment was introduced by homologous recombination into the TK locus of the viral genome. The presence of the rabbit SC cDNA insert in the viral genome was ascertained by PCR utilizing transfer vector-specific primers that generated unique amplification products of the expected sizes (Fig. 4B). Insertion of the IpaB epitope into the E-F loop of SC domain I was performed using PCR as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Heterologous production of SC was performed by infecting CV-1 cells with rVVs vvHGS1-SC6xHis and vvHGS1-SC(IpaB)6xHis at a multiplicity of infection of 2 for 24 h. These conditions have been shown to be optimal for the expression of human SC using an identical approach (9Rindisbacher L. Cottet S. Wittek R. Kraehenbuhl J.-P. Corthésy B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14220-14228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Secretion of wild-type or chimeric SC was assessed by immunoblotting. After 24 h of culture, wild-type SC could be detected in as little as 5 μl of cell culture supernatant (Fig. 5A, lane 3), whereas no chimeric SC was detected under the same conditions (Fig. 5A, lane 1). 100-fold concentration of the medium was required to generate a chimeric SC signal of similar intensity to that obtained with cells infected with SC(wt) (Fig. 5A, lane 2), suggesting that processing and/or secretion was blocked within the cells. To test this hypothesis, cell extracts were prepared in a final volume corresponding to that of the culture medium and analyzed for the presence of SC(IpaB)6xHis. 5 μl of extract generated a signal intensity on Western blot comparable with that of supernatant of vvHGS1-SC6xHis-infected cells. The chimeric intracellular SC migrated significantly faster than secreted wild-type SC on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 5A, lane 4), reflecting incomplete glycosylation and subsequent block in transport as a consequence of the alteration of the E-F loop in domain I. However, affinity purification of recombinant SC(IpaB) could be achieved on a Ni2+-NTA-agarose column (Fig. 5B) using the conditions given in Rindisbacher et al. (9Rindisbacher L. Cottet S. Wittek R. Kraehenbuhl J.-P. Corthésy B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14220-14228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We next examined whether the dramatic effect on secretion of replacing the E-F loop by an IpaB epitope observed in recombinant SC would hold true for the full pIgR. Receptor biosynthesis and its routing along the secretory pathway were analyzed in MDCK cells stably transfected with wild-type and chimeric receptors under the control of a glucocorticoid-inducible promoter (15Hirt R.

https://openalex.org/W1998998767,"In this paper, we present both in vivo and in vitro evidence for the presence of a novel cis-acting regulatory element that is required for maximal induction of the human low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor gene following depletion of cellular sterols in HepG2 cells. First, in vivo dimethyl sulfate footprinting of the human LDL receptor promoter before and after transcriptional induction in HepG2 cells revealed protection from -145 to -126, 5'-GAGCTTCACGGGTTAAAAAG-3' (referred to as FP1 site). Second, transient transfections of HepG2 cells with promoter luciferase reporter constructs containing the FP1 site resulted in significant enhancement (approximately 375%) of reporter gene expression in response to low levels of sterols compared with parallel plasmid without the FP1 site. In addition, this response was markedly attenuated on nucleotide substitutions within the FP1 site. Third, by electrophoretic mobility shift assays, the FP1 sequence was found to bind protein(s) from HepG2 nuclear extracts in a sequence-specific manner. In vitro binding of the FP1 mutants paralleled the results obtained for their in vivo transcription. On the basis of competition profiles, the FP1-binding factor is different from the known transcription factors binding to the AT-rich CArG and GArC motifs. Furthermore, the FP1-binding protein is not specific to HepG2 cells because nuclear factor(s) with the same specificity was observed in nuclear extracts of non-hepatic HeLa cells. We conclude that transcriptional induction of the LDL receptor gene in response to sterol depletion is mediated, in part, by an highly conserved novel cis-acting element through the binding of specific nuclear protein(s)."
https://openalex.org/W1982564673,"The soft x-ray spectra of the Virgo and Coma clusters cannot be modeled by emission from the well-known hot intracluster medium attenuated by photoelectric absorption along the line of sight in our galaxy. If the excess soft emission is due to thermal emission in the clusters from gas at about 1 million kelvin, then the gas should be rapidly cooling. The high rate of cooling poses problems for the origin of the gas and its sink. A model in which the component is due to turbulent mixing layers around clouds scattered throughout the intracluster medium may explain the excess emission. The gas in the mixing layer is reheated after cooling, so that the total mass remains relatively small."

A linker substitution mutation (Δuse) within the HIV-1 3ʹ-processing enhancer has been shown to reduce 3ʹ-processing in vivo and in vitro (15Valsamakis A. Zeichner S. Carswell S. Alwine J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2108-2112Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 16Valsamakis A. Schek N. Alwine J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3699-3705Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 17Gilmartin G.M. Fleming E.S. Oetjen J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4419-4428Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This mutation dramatically reduced the binding of CPSF and the efficiency of poly(A) addition to a pre-cleaved RNA in vitro (18Gilmartin G.M. Fleming E.S. Oetjen J. Graveley B.R. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 72-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). We have recently described an in vitro selection technique that facilitates the isolation of RNA molecules that are efficiently polyadenylated from a large pool of variants (20Graveley B.R. Fleming E.S. Gilmartin G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4942-4951Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). By applying this method to study the sequence requirements of the HIV-1 3ʹ-processing enhancer, we demonstrated that the structural context within which the AAUAAA hexamer resides is vital to its recognition by CPSF. In addition, we observed that the Δuse mutation altered the conformation of the pre-mRNA such that the sequences encompassing the AAUAAA hexamer were sequestered. Here, we have used in vitro selection to further examine the contributions of RNA sequence and structure to poly(A) site recognition by CPSF. Our previous work suggested that the HIV-1 AAUAAA hexamer resides within a suboptimal sequence context, necessitating its juxtaposition to an upstream 3ʹ-processing enhancer for efficient processing (17Gilmartin G.M. Fleming E.S. Oetjen J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4419-4428Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 18Gilmartin G.M. Fleming E.S. Oetjen J. Graveley B.R. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 72-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Replacement of the 14-nt region of the HIV-1 poly(A) site between the TAR element and the AAUAAA hexamer (a sequence element we refer to here as the B segment) by the corresponding sequence of the adenovirus L3 poly(A) site was sufficient to restore CPSF binding and efficient poly(A) addition to a pre-cleaved RNA in the absence of a functional 3ʹ-processing enhancer (18Gilmartin G.M. Fleming E.S. Oetjen J. Graveley B.R. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 72-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). These results suggested a potential contribution of sequence context to poly(A) site recognition by CPSF. We have therefore selected for B segment sequences capable of restoring efficient poly(A) addition to a pre-cleaved RNA containing the Δuse mutation. In stark contrast to the wide array of sequences identified in our previous selection for efficient upstream 3ʹ-processing enhancers (20Graveley B.R. Fleming E.S. Gilmartin G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4942-4951Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), selection of efficient polyadenylation substrates, from a pool of 268,435,456 potential B segment variants, yielded two predominant classes of RNAs. RNase probing data revealed that the selected sequences restored an RNA conformation comparable with that of the wild-type HIV-1 RNA. These results strongly suggest that both the RNA sequence and structural context of the region encompassing the AAUAAA hexamer contribute to poly(A) site recognition by CPSF. HeLa cell nuclear extract was prepared as described by Rüegsegger et al. (11Rüegsegger U. Beyer K. Keller W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6107-6113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Purified human CPSF and recombinant bovine PAP were prepared as described previously (18Gilmartin G.M. Fleming E.S. Oetjen J. Graveley B.R. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 72-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The transcription templates encoding the RNAs in which the TAR element and B segments were exchanged were generated using combinations of unique restriction sites and oligonucleotide cassettes. The templates encoding pre-cleaved RNAs containing the Δuse mutation were PCR amplified with an SP6 primer and a primer ending at the cleavage site, and the PCR products were transcribed with SP6 RNA polymerase. Templates containing the wild-type HIV-1 enhancer, use, were digested with XhoI prior to transcription with SP6 RNA polymerase. The templates encoding RNAs lacking sequences upstream of TAR were generated by either digestion with XhoI or PCR amplification, and the templates were transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase. The templates encoding the selected RNAs containing the HIV-1 downstream element were generated by digesting the respective plasmids with EcoRI prior to transcription with SP6 RNA polymerase. In vitro selection was performed essentially as described previously (20Graveley B.R. Fleming E.S. Gilmartin G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4942-4951Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The initial pool in which the 14-nt region between TAR and the AAUAAA hexamer was randomized in the context of the Δuse mutation was created as follows. Two partially overlapping oligonucleotides were annealed and extended with Klenow. The double-stranded DNA was PCR amplified with the SP6-Δuse primer (5ʹ-ATTTAGGTGACACTATAGAAGATGCATATAAGAAGCTCATATGCTCGAGGTCGACACT-3ʹ) and 3ʹ-primer 2 (5ʹ-TGAAGCACTCAAGGCAAGCTTTATT-3ʹ). The PCR product was transcribed with SP6 RNA polymerase and the RNA gel purified prior to use. 75 femtomoles of the initial pool (each variant should be represented 168 times) was incubated with 10 femtomoles of purified CPSF and 300 femtomoles of PAP for 10 min at 30°C. ATP and MgCl2 were added to 0.7 and 1 mM, respectively, to initiate polyadenylation, and the reaction continued for 2 min at 30°C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 175 μl of ETS (10 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris (pH 7.8), and 0.5% SDS), sequentially extracted with phenol and phenol:chloroform, and ethanol precipitated. The RNA was selected on Dynabeads Oligo-(dT)25 (Dynal) as described previously (20Graveley B.R. Fleming E.S. Gilmartin G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4942-4951Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The selected RNA was annealed to 20 pmol of 3ʹ-primer 1 (5ʹ-TGAAGCACTCAAGGCAAGCT-3ʹ) and reverse transcribed with avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase at 37°C for 30 min. The reaction was extracted with phenol:chloroform, ethanol precipitated, and resuspended in H2O. The cDNA was PCR amplified with the SP6-Δuse primer and 3ʹ-primer 2 for 40 cycles at 94°C for 15 s, 55°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 1 min. The PCR product was transcribed with SP6 RNA polymerase, and the RNA was gel purified. The new RNA pool was used for the next round of selection. The stringency of selection was increased by raising the KCl concentration and decreasing the CPSF concentration in the reaction as described (20Graveley B.R. Fleming E.S. Gilmartin G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4942-4951Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). During the final round of selection, the selected RNAs were separated on a denaturing 5% gel, and the polyadenylated RNAs were excised and eluted. The eluted RNAs were then reverse transcribed and PCR amplified as described above. The PCR products encoding the initial and final pools were digested with NsiI and HindIII and ligated into pIVS-1 (20Graveley B.R. Fleming E.S. Gilmartin G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4942-4951Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). All clones were sequenced with the T7 primer using Sequenase v2.0. Polyadenylation and CPSF-RNA complex formation assays were performed as described previously (20Graveley B.R. Fleming E.S. Gilmartin G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4942-4951Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Data quantitation was performed on a Bio-Rad phosphorimager. RNAs were 32P 3ʹ-end-labeled and probed with 10 picograms of RNase A or 0.1 units of RNase T1 as described previously (20Graveley B.R. Fleming E.S. Gilmartin G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4942-4951Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Cleavage assays were performed in HeLa cell nuclear extract for 10 min at 30°C as described previously (19Graveley B.R. Gilmartin G.M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1612-1617Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The first step in the assembly of an mRNA 3ʹ-processing complex appears to be the recognition and binding of the AAUAAA hexamer by CPSF. Although the precise features of the CPSF-RNA interaction in the context of large RNA substrates will certainly be quite complex in vivo, the general themes revealed by in vitro analysis of smaller RNA substrates may provide an insight into the nature of poly(A) site recognition. Furthermore, we believe that the reconstituted poly(A) addition reaction, consisting of a pre-cleaved RNA, purified human CPSF, and recombinant bovine PAP, represents a valid functional assay with which to explore the parameters governing poly(A) site recognition by CPSF. We have previously shown that the stable binding of CPSF at the HIV-1 poly(A) site is dependent upon the presence of an upstream 3ʹ-processing enhancer (18Gilmartin G.M. Fleming E.S. Oetjen J. Graveley B.R. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 72-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In the absence of a functional 3ʹ-processing enhancer, however, efficient poly(A) addition and CPSF binding could be restored by replacing the 14-nt region immediately 5ʹ of the AAUAAA hexamer of the HIV-1 poly(A) site (the B segment) with the corresponding sequences from the efficient adenovirus L3 poly(A) site (18Gilmartin G.M. Fleming E.S. Oetjen J. Graveley B.R. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 72-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). To examine the impact of RNA sequence and structure upon recognition of the AAUAAA hexamer by CPSF, we have used in vitro selection to identify B segment sequences capable of restoring efficient poly(A) addition to a pre-cleaved RNA containing the Δuse mutation. To this end, we created an RNA pool based on the HIV-1 poly(A) site in which the 14-nt B segment was randomized in the context of the 3ʹ-processing enhancer mutation Δuse (Fig. 1A). The 3ʹ-end of each of the randomized RNA pools extends to the site of cleavage and therefore represents a pre-cleaved RNA, the biologically relevant substrate for poly(A) addition. This RNA pool was subjected to eight rounds of selection as diagramed in Fig. 1B. The initial RNA pool was incubated with purified human CPSF and recombinant bovine PAP for 10 min at 30°C. Excess PAP was used to ensure that all productive CPSF-RNA interactions resulted in a poly(A) addition event. Poly(A) addition was initiated upon the addition of MgCl2 and ATP to 1 and 0.7 mM, respectively, and carried out for 2 min. The RNA was then selected on oligo-(dT)25, and the selected RNA was reverse transcribed, PCR amplified, and transcribed with SP6 RNA polymerase to generate a new RNA pool enriched in efficient poly(A) addition substrates. The stringency of selection was increased over the course of the experiment by reducing the CPSF concentration and increasing the KCl concentration (see “Experimental Procedures”). Addition of poly(A) to the wild-type HIV-1 RNA was barely detectable under the most stringent conditions used for selection (data not shown). During the final round of selection, the selected RNAs were separated on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel, and the polyadenylated RNAs were excised. This step assured that the selected RNAs were poly(A) addition substrates, rather than RNAs possessing an affinity for the oligo-(dT)25 beads. The PCR products encoding the initial and final pools were cloned, and individual members from each were sequenced in their entirety. To determine the extent of selection, 32P-labeled RNAs were synthesized from the initial and final pool and assayed for their ability to serve as poly(A) addition and CPSF binding substrates. To assay poly(A) addition, each RNA pool was incubated with purified human CPSF and recombinant bovine PAP in the presence of ATP and MgCl2, and aliquots were removed at 0, 2.5, 5, and 10 min. The reaction products were separated on a denaturing 5% polyacrylamide gel and visualized by autoradiography. As expected, the final RNA pool was polyadenylated to a much greater extent than the initial RNA pool (Fig. 1C). To determine if the poly(A) addition efficiency of these pools was a reflection of CPSF binding, each RNA pool was incubated with purified human CPSF for 10 min at 30°C, treated with heparin at 0°C, and subjected to electrophoresis on a nondenaturing 3% polyacrylamide gel at 4°C. The CPSF-RNA complexes were visualized by autoradiography. CPSF bound to the final RNA pool to a much greater extent than the initial pool (Fig. 1D, lanes 1 and 2). The extent of CPSF binding to the final pool was approximately five times greater than to the wild-type HIV-1 poly(A) site, use (Fig. 1D, lanes 2 and 3). This difference was also reflected in the efficiency of poly(A) addition (see below and Fig. 2B). The comparable amount of CPSF-RNA complexes formed with the initial RNA pool and the wild-type HIV-1 poly(A) site suggested that there were a relatively large number of molecules in the initial pool capable of binding CPSF. The sequences of 22 individual clones from the final pool revealed that 50% of the population could be grouped into a single, highly related class in which all members contained an identical B segment (Fig. 2A, class I). Furthermore, an additional 18% of the clones could be grouped into a second class containing identical B segments distinct from class I (Fig. 2A, class II). The remaining seven clones were apparently unrelated to the class I or II RNAs or to one another (Fig. 2A, class III). All of the clones from the final pool contained mutations within the TAR element, whereas none of the 18 clones sequenced from the initial pool contained mutations within TAR (data not shown). These mutations were most likely acquired during repeated reverse transcription and PCR amplification, possibly conferring a selective advantage on the RNA molecules containing them (see below). To determine if the selected RNAs were efficient poly(A) addition substrates, each individual clone from the final pool was transcribed and tested for poly(A) addition and CPSF binding. All of the RNAs from class I behaved identically in these assays, with the exception of 8.23, which differs from the other class I RNAs at a single position within TAR (data not shown). Therefore, only RNAs 8.1, which was selected as the representative from this class, and 8.23 are shown here. All members of class II performed identically (data not shown), and only RNA 8.18 is shown here. Each of the unique clones from class III is shown here as well. Polyadenylation of the HIV-1 RNA containing the Δuse mutation was barely detectable (Fig. 2B, lanes 5-8). As expected, each of the selected RNAs was efficiently polyadenylated (Fig. 2B, lanes 9-48). In fact, the efficiency of poly(A) addition of all of the selected RNAs was greater than that of the wild-type HIV-1 RNA, use (Fig. 2B, lanes 1-4). The single nucleotide difference between RNAs 8.1 and 8.23 from class I resulted in a significantly lower polyadenylation efficiency of the 8.23 RNA (Fig. 2B, lanes 9-16). Most likely, the single nucleotide difference between RNA 8.23 and the remainder of the class I RNAs occurred during the final rounds of reverse transcription and PCR amplification. The efficiency of poly(A) addition was directly reflected in the binding of CPSF to each substrate (Fig. 2C). No detectable complex was formed between CPSF and the HIV-1 RNA containing the Δuse mutation, whereas CPSF bound to the RNA containing the wild-type HIV-1 sequence, use (Fig. 2C, lanes 1 and 2). For each of the selected RNAs, with the exception of RNA 8.23 (lane 4), CPSF bound a greater fraction of the RNA than the wild-type use RNA. The single base difference between RNAs 8.1 and 8.23 resulted in a reduction in the amount of 8.23 RNA bound by CPSF (lanes 3 and 4). All of the selected RNAs contained mutations within the TAR RNA stem loop structure. To determine if these mutations contributed to poly(A) addition efficiency, we focused our attention on the class I RNAs. The TAR mutations were separated from the class I B segment, and the resulting RNAs containing each element alone were assayed for poly(A) addition and CPSF binding (Fig. 3). The polyadenylation data shown in Fig. 3B demonstrates that the class I TAR element and B segment were each capable of enhancing poly(A) addition efficiency in the context of the Δuse mutation (cf. Δuse, lanes 5-8; 8.1a, lanes 13-16; and 8.1b, lanes 17-20). However, the poly(A) addition efficiency of the class I RNA containing both selected elements was greater than the efficiency of either RNA containing a single selected element alone (Fig. 3B, 8.1, lanes 9-12). Quantitation of the data in Fig. 3B by phosphorimagery revealed that, when combined, the effects of the selected TAR and B segment sequences on poly(A) addition were additive (Fig. 3A). An analysis of the ability of each RNA in Fig. 3A to form a complex with CPSF revealed that, again, each selected RNA element alone could overcome the effect of the Δuse mutation to promote the binding of CPSF (Fig. 3C, cf. Δuse, lane 2; 8.1a, lane 4; and 8.1b, lane 5). Consistent with the poly(A) addition data, the binding of CPSF to the class I RNA containing both RNA elements was greater than to the RNAs containing either element alone (Fig. 3C, 8.1, lane 3). Phosphorimager quantitation of the data in Fig. 3C revealed that the two RNA elements combine synergistically to promote CPSF binding (Fig. 3A). 26% of the RNA containing both elements was bound by CPSF in contrast to 5 and 6% of the RNA containing only the selected B segment or selected TAR element, respectively. These results demonstrate that the mutations within the TAR element of the class I RNAs enhance the efficiency of poly(A) addition and CPSF binding above the level of the selected B segment alone. The mutations within the class I TAR element therefore contributed to the selective advantage of the class I RNAs. We previously found that RNAs selected for efficient poly(A) addition share a common structural conformation that appears to place the sequences encompassing the AAUAAA hexamer in an open structure accessible to CPSF (20Graveley B.R. Fleming E.S. Gilmartin G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4942-4951Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To determine if the selected RNAs adopted a similar structural conformation, we probed the structures of the class I and class II RNAs with the RNases A and T1. Equal moles of 32P 3ʹ-end-labeled RNA were incubated in the absence of protein at 30°C for 5 min under poly(A) addition conditions (except that ATP was omitted; see “Experimental Procedures”) followed by the addition of RNase A or T1 to the reaction mixture, and the incubation was continued for 10 min. The RNase sensitivity profiles were analyzed by electrophoresis of the samples on denaturing 10% polyacrylamide gels and autoradiography. We have previously demonstrated that the accessibility of G121 (which resides immediately 3ʹ to the AAUAAA hexamer; see Fig. 1A) to RNase T1 directly correlated with the ability of that RNA to be utilized as a poly(A) addition substrate (20Graveley B.R. Fleming E.S. Gilmartin G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4942-4951Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The class I and class II RNAs contained this nucleotide in a conformation that was accessible to RNase T1 (Fig. 4A). G121 in RNAs 8.1, 8.23, and 8.18, as well as the wild-type HIV-1 RNA, use, was accessible to RNase T1 (Fig. 4, lanes 2, 4, 5, 6). In contrast, G121 was inaccessible to RNase T1 in the RNA containing the Δuse mutation and the wild-type HIV-1 B segment (Fig. 4A, lane 3). The doublets observed were due to 3ʹ-end heterogeneity generated by SP6 RNA polymerase. We have previously demonstrated that the accessibility of nucleotide C40 (see Fig. 1A) to RNase A also correlated with poly(A) addition efficiency and CPSF binding (20Graveley B.R. Fleming E.S. Gilmartin G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4942-4951Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The class I RNAs isolated in this selection, as well as the wild-type HIV-1 RNA, use, contained C40 in a conformation that was accessible to RNase A (Fig. 4A, lanes 8, 10, 11). This nucleotide was not accessible to RNase A in the Δuse RNA or, surprisingly, in the class II RNAs (Fig. 4A, lane 9, 12). However, the TAR element in the class II RNAs clearly adopted a very different structure from that of the wild-type RNA. Both RNase T1 and RNase A cleaved within the class II TAR element in regions that are normally inaccessible to these single strand-specific nucleases (Fig. 4A, lanes 6, 12). Therefore, the inaccessibility of C40 to RNase A in the class II RNAs is likely due to large changes that disrupt the integrity of the TAR RNA stem loop and therefore the overall RNA structure. To determine if the enhancement of poly(A) addition observed with the class I TAR and B segments alone was also due to a restoration of RNA structure, we subjected the RNAs 8.1a and 8.1b to RNase probing. G121 and C40 were accessible to RNase T1 and RNase A, respectively, in each of these RNAs (Fig. 4B, lanes 13-18). These results demonstrate that the selected RNAs adopt a structural conformation surrounding the AAUAAA hexamer, as measured by G121 accessibility to RNase T1, that correlates with their ability to serve as poly(A) addition substrates. In addition, the distinct structure of the class II RNAs suggests that the overall structure of poly(A) sites need not be conserved but only the local conformation encompassing the AAUAAA hexamer. The B segments selected for efficient poly(A) addition place the AAUAAA hexamer in a favorable context that allows for the negative impact of the Δuse mutation to be overcome. We have therefore examined the impact of the selected B segment upon poly(A) addition in the complete absence of upstream sequences. To this end, we constructed a set of RNAs containing the class I TAR element and B segment, either alone or together in the absence of sequences upstream of TAR (Fig. 5A). These RNAs were assayed for poly(A) addition and CPSF binding. The RNAs containing the class I B segment were polyadenylated more efficiently than the RNAs containing the wild-type HIV-1 B segment (Fig. 5B; cf. CPS, lanes 1-4 and CPS 8.1b, lanes 13-16 with CPS 8.1, lanes 5-8 and CPS 8.1a, lanes 9-12). In the absence of upstream sequences, however, the class I TAR element does not contribute to the efficiency of poly(A) addition (Fig. 5B; cf. CPS, lanes 1-4 and CPS 8.1b, lanes 13-16). The polyadenylation efficiency of each of these RNAs was reflected in CPSF binding (Fig. 5C). CPSF bound a greater fraction of the RNAs containing the class I B segment than those containing the wild-type HIV-1 B segment (Fig. 5C; cf. CPS, lane 1 and CPS 8.1b, lane 4 with CPS 8.1, lane 2 and CPS 8.1a, lane 3). Consistent with the poly(A) addition data, the class I TAR element had little effect on CPSF binding (Fig. 5C; cf. CPS, lane 1 and CPS 8.1b, lane 4). Quantitation of the poly(A) addition and CPSF binding data revealed that the substitution of the HIV-1 B segment with that of the selected class I RNAs resulted in an approximately 2-fold enhancement of poly(A) addition and a 3-4-fold enhancement of CPSF binding. To further examine the context dependence of the selected B segment sequences, we also constructed a set of RNAs containing the class I TAR element and B segment, either alone or together, in the context of the wild-type HIV-1 3ʹ-processing enhancer, use (Fig. 6A). These RNAs were then analyzed for poly(A) addition and CPSF binding. The poly(A) addition results show that, when substituted for the respective HIV-1 sequences, the class I TAR element and B segment alone each enhanced the poly(A) addition efficiency of RNAs containing the wild-type HIV-1 3ʹ-processing enhancer (Fig. 6B; cf. use, lanes 5-8, use 8.1b, lanes 13-16, and use 8.1a, lanes 17-20). However, combining the class I TAR element and B segment in this context did not result in a further increase in the enhancement of poly(A) addition (Fig. 6B; use 8.1, lanes 9-12). The poly(A) addition efficiency of these RNAs was reflected in CPSF binding (Fig. 6C). Both the class I TAR element and B segment alone enhanced CPSF binding over the wild-type HIV-1 elements (Fig. 6C; cf. use, lane 2, use 8.1b, lane 4, and use 8.1a, lane 5). Consistent with the poly(A) addition data, the two elements did not result in a further enhancement of CPSF binding (Fig. 6C; use 8.1, lane 3). These results demonstrate that the impact of the class I B segment upon CPSF binding and poly(A) addition does not require the presence of specific sequences upstream of TAR, whereas the impact of the class I TAR element is more sensitive to sequence context. Although endonucleolytic cleavage requires a considerably more complex set of RNA-protein and protein-protein interactions, we were interested in determining whether the B segment sequences selected for efficient poly(A) addition in the context of the Δuse mutation would also serve to enhance the endonucleolytic cleavage reaction. Each of the selected RNAs illustrated in Fig. 2, panels B and C, was joined with the HIV-1 downstream element, and the resulting pre-mRNAs were examined for endonucleolytic cleavage in HeLa cell nuclear extract. The cleavage efficiency of each RNA was assessed by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Although in at least one case (Fig. 7A, 8.1/dse, lane 3) a selected B segment enhanced the efficiency of cleavage above the level of Δuse/dse, most of the selected B segments had little impact on the efficiency of endonucleolytic cleavage (Fig. 7A). Selection for efficient poly(A) addition substrates therefore did not yield RNAs that, when placed in the context of the downstream element, necessarily exhibited an equivalent enhancement in cleavage efficiency. We also examined the impact of the addition of the downstream element on the ability of the selected RNAs to form a complex with CPSF. As illustrated in Fig. 7B, nearly all of the selected RNAs tested formed a CPSF-RNA complex more efficiently than the Δuse/dse RNA. In fact, several of the CPSF-RNA complexes approached wild-type (use/dse) levels. A comparison of the efficiencies of cleavage and CPSF-RNA complex formation in Fig. 7B indicates that, in contrast to poly(A) addition on pre-cleaved RNAs, CPSF-RNA complex formation did not directly correlate with the efficiency of the endonucleolytic cleavage reaction. As discussed below, the complexity of the RNA-protein and protein-protein interactions required for endonucleolytic cleavage may account for the differential impact of changes within the B segment. The only conserved element shared by mammalian poly(A) sites is an AAUAAA hexamer, which adjoins a highly variable U- or GU-rich downstream element. The 3ʹ-processing machinery must be capable of discriminating between authentic poly(A) sites and other sequences within the message sharing similarity to the conserved sequence. Recently, it has become clear that sequences outside of the core elements influence poly(A) site efficiency. We have previously shown that the HIV-1 3ʹ-processing enhancer functions to place the AAUAAA hexamer in an RNA conformation that facilitates CPSF binding (20Graveley B.R. Fleming E.S. Gilmartin G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4942-4951Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Replacement of the HIV-1 3ʹ-processing enhancer with the Δuse linker substitution mutation significantly decreased the efficiency of endonucleolytic cleavage, poly(A) addition, and CPSF binding (18Gilmartin G.M. Fleming E.S. Oetjen J. Graveley B.R. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 72-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), apparently by sequestering the sequences encompassing the AAUAAA hexamer (20Graveley B.R. Fleming E.S. Gilmartin G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4942-4951Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In this report, we have used in vitro selection to identify compensatory sequences adjacent to the AAUAAA hexamer that restore efficient poly(A) addition in the absence of a functional 3ʹ-processing enhancer. RNase probing data indicate that the selected sequences reestablish an RNA conformation that facilitates CPSF binding. Thus, our results clearly demonstrate that RNA structure is an important player in poly(A) site recognition by CPSF. The RNA conformation revealed by in vitro selection for functional poly(A) addition substrates was characterized by sensitivity of nucleotides G121 to RNase T1 and, with the exception of the class II RNAs, C40 to RNase A. The accessibility of G121 is likely to be indicative of an “open” structure in which the AAUAAA hexamer is properly presented for CPSF binding. The apparent lack of conserved RNA structures shared by mammalian poly(A) sites suggests that multiple structures, or higher order non-Watson-Crick structures, may serve to present the AAUAAA hexamer for CPSF binding. Multiple RNA structures are clearly compatible with efficient poly(A) addition, as illustrated by the large overall structural differences between the class I and class II RNAs. In each case, however, G121 was found to be accessible to RNase T1. A variety of RNA structures has been shown to influence 3ʹ-processing in vivo as well as in vitro. The extensive RNA structure of the HTLV-I RexRE has been shown to be required for the spatial juxtaposition of the AAUAAA hexamer to the cleavage site located 274 nt downstream (21Ahmed Y.F. Gilmartin G.M. Hanly S.M. Nevins J.R. Greene W.C. Cell. 1991; 64: 727-737Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Conversely, an RNA structure that placed the hexamer in a double-stranded region has been shown to have a detrimental impact on 3ʹ-processing in vivo (22Gimmi E.R. Reff M.E. Deckman E.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6983-6998Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data suggest that while the overall structure of a poly(A) site can vary greatly, the local structural conformation of the RNA encompassing the AAUAAA hexamer is of primary importance for the recognition of a poly(A) site by CPSF. It should be noted that the accessibility of G121 to RNase T1 alone can not be interpreted as a quantitative indication of the efficiency of poly(A) addition and CPSF binding. For instance, while G121 is equally accessible to RNase T1 in the RNAs use and 8.1, RNA 8.1 is a much better substrate for CPSF binding and poly(A) addition than use. Therefore, while in all cases examined, the accessibility of G121 correlated with poly(A) addition, additional parameters must influence efficiency. The appearance of predominant classes of RNAs in the final pool of the B segment selection was in stark contrast to the wide array of sequences identified by our previous selection for upstream 3ʹ-processing enhancers (20Graveley B.R. Fleming E.S. Gilmartin G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4942-4951Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The two selection experiments were conducted identically, with the sole exception of the sequences chosen for randomization. In both selection experiments, however, all the RNAs examined from the final round of selection appeared to be related by RNA structure (Ref. 20 and this work). Another striking difference between the results of the two experiments was the different poly(A) addition and CPSF binding efficiencies of the selected RNAs. None of the RNAs from the enhancer selection experiment exhibited a level of poly(A) addition or CPSF binding activity that exceeded that of the wild-type RNA (20Graveley B.R. Fleming E.S. Gilmartin G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4942-4951Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In contrast, the B segment selection reported here yielded RNAs that exhibited levels of CPSF binding and poly(A) addition activity that exceeded that of the wild-type RNA, regardless of the nature of the sequences upstream of TAR. In addition to their impact upon RNA structure, the B segment sequences therefore appear to contribute to CPSF binding and poly(A) addition efficiency in a manner that is distinct from that of the upstream 3ʹ-processing enhancer. The poly(A) addition efficiency of the class I RNAs reported here was dependent upon the selected B segment as well as base changes within the TAR element that were acquired during selection. Importantly, however, both the class I B segment and the class I TAR element alone enhanced CPSF binding and poly(A) addition and promoted an “open” RNA conformation. It therefore appears unlikely that RNA structure alone can account for the high efficiency of the selected RNAs. Taken together, our results suggest that sequence preferences within the B segment may facilitate optimal CPSF binding and poly(A) addition. Considerable work will be necessary to fully understand how flanking sequences influence poly(A) site recognition. The scope of this problem is best illustrated by comparing the RNAs Δuse and 8.1b (Fig. 3), which differ at only three positions within TAR (a single nucleotide deletion and two point mutations). These three changes restored the efficiency of poly(A) addition and CPSF binding to near wild-type levels in the context of Δuse. Furthermore, these changes restored the nuclease accessibility of G121 and C40. These data illuminate the complex interplay among the sequences flanking the AAUAAA hexamer. Moreover, subtle changes in flanking sequences may have profound effects on the ability of CPSF to recognize the AAUAAA hexamer. The impact of the selected B segment sequences upon cleavage at the HIV-1 poly(A) site suggests that a complex set of RNA-protein interactions, in addition to the binding of CPSF at the AAUAAA hexamer, influences the recognition of authentic 3ʹ-processing sites. We observed that in the context of the downstream element, the majority of sequences selected for their ability to enhance poly(A) addition to a pre-cleaved RNA had little impact upon the endonucleolytic cleavage reaction. In each case, however, the binding of CPSF to the RNAs containing the selected B segments in the presence of the HIV-1 downstream element exceeded that of the Δuse RNA. These results are consistent with our earlier observation that replacement of the HIV-1 B segment with the analogous sequences from the adenovirus L3 poly(A) site enhanced in vitro poly(A) addition and CPSF binding but had no significant impact upon the endonucleolytic cleavage reaction (18Gilmartin G.M. Fleming E.S. Oetjen J. Graveley B.R. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 72-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) (it is interesting to note that the L3 sequence and the class I B segment are identical in 7 of 14 positions). The cleavage results should hardly be surprising, however, given the relative complexity of the two reactions. In contrast to poly(A) addition, which was accomplished here by two purified factors (CPSF and PAP), the cleavage reaction was carried out in a crude HeLa cell nuclear extract. Endonucleolytic cleavage requires the assembly of an RNA-protein complex composed of at least 12 polypeptides (constituents of the processing factors CPSF, CstF, CFIm, CFIIm, and PAP). Seven UV cross-links between the pre-mRNA and six of the protein components (CPSF 160- and 30-kDa subunits, CstF 64-kDa subunit, and CFIm 68-, 59-, and 25-kDa subunits) have been reported (6Keller W. Bienroth S. Lang K.M. Christofori G. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4241-4249Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 8MacDonald C.C. Wilusz J. Shenk T. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1994; 14: 8183-8190Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), although only three of these cross-links have been localized on the pre-mRNA (6Keller W. Bienroth S. Lang K.M. Christofori G. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4241-4249Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 8MacDonald C.C. Wilusz J. Shenk T. Mol. Cell.

Changes within the B segment may therefore be expected to have multiple ramifications for the assembly of a 3ʹ-processing complex in addition to an impact on CPSF binding. The addition of RNA structure to the repertoire of information utilized by the 3ʹ-processing machinery in poly(A) site recognition may help to explain how poly(A) sites are defined. The sequence AAUAAA occurs within the coding region of many mammalian genes, often in association with U-rich downstream sequences (20Graveley B.R. Fleming E.S. Gilmartin G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4942-4951Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 24Day I.N.M. Gene. 1992; 110: 245-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Our work suggests that these potential poly(A) sites may reside within an RNA conformation that sequesters them from the 3ʹ-processing machinery. This model is currently under investigation.
