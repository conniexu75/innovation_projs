https://openalex.org/W2163313531,"For decades it has been recognized that neutrophilic Fe-oxidizing bacteria (FeOB) are associated with hydrothermal venting of Fe(II)-rich fluids associated with seamounts in the world's oceans. The evidence was based almost entirely on the mineralogical remains of the microbes, which themselves had neither been brought into culture or been assigned to a specific phylogenetic clade. We have used both cultivation and cultivation-independent techniques to study Fe-rich microbial mats associated with hydrothermal venting at Loihi Seamount, a submarine volcano.Using gradient enrichment techniques, two iron-oxidizing bacteria, strains PV-1 and JV-1, were isolated. Chemolithotrophic growth was observed under microaerobic conditions; Fe(II) and Fe(0) were the only energy sources that supported growth. Both strains produced filamentous stalk-like structures composed of multiple nanometer sized fibrils of Fe-oxyhydroxide. These were consistent with mineralogical structures found in the iron mats. Phylogenetic analysis of the small subunit (SSU) rRNA gene demonstrated that strains PV-1 and JV-1 were identical and formed a monophyletic group deeply rooted within the Proteobacteria. The most similar sequence (85.3% similarity) from a cultivated isolate came from Methylophaga marina. Phylogenetic analysis of the RecA and GyrB protein sequences confirmed that these strains are distantly related to other members of the Proteobacteria. A cultivation-independent analysis of the SSU rRNA gene by terminal-restriction fragment (T-RF) profiling showed that this phylotype was most common in a variety of microbial mats collected at different times and locations at Loihi.On the basis of phylogenetic and physiological data, it is proposed that isolate PV-1(T) ( = ATCC BAA-1019: JCM 14766) represents the type strain of a novel species in a new genus, Mariprofundus ferrooxydans gen. nov., sp. nov. Furthermore, the strain is the first cultured representative of a new candidatus class of the Proteobacteria that is widely distributed in deep-sea environments, Candidatus zeta (zeta)-Proteobacteria cl. nov."
https://openalex.org/W2150994376,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal, progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by rapid loss of muscle control and eventual paralysis due to the death of large motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord. Growth factors such as glial cell line derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) are known to protect motor neurons from damage in a range of models. However, penetrance through the blood brain barrier and delivery to the spinal cord remains a serious challenge. Although there may be a primary dysfunction in the motor neuron itself, there is also increasing evidence that excitotoxicity due to glial dysfunction plays a crucial role in disease progression. Clearly it would be of great interest if wild type glial cells could ameliorate motor neuron loss in these models, perhaps in combination with the release of growth factors such as GDNF.Human neural progenitor cells can be expanded in culture for long periods and survive transplantation into the adult rodent central nervous system, in some cases making large numbers of GFAP positive astrocytes. They can also be genetically modified to release GDNF (hNPC(GDNF)) and thus act as long-term 'mini pumps' in specific regions of the rodent and primate brain. In the current study we genetically modified human neural stem cells to release GDNF and transplanted them into the spinal cord of rats over-expressing mutant SOD1 (SOD1(G93A)). Following unilateral transplantation into the spinal cord of SOD1(G93A) rats there was robust cellular migration into degenerating areas, efficient delivery of GDNF and remarkable preservation of motor neurons at early and end stages of the disease within chimeric regions. The progenitors retained immature markers, and those not secreting GDNF had no effect on motor neuron survival. Interestingly, this robust motor neuron survival was not accompanied by continued innervation of muscle end plates and thus resulted in no improvement in ipsilateral limb use.The potential to maintain dying motor neurons by delivering GDNF using neural progenitor cells represents a novel and powerful treatment strategy for ALS. While this approach represents a unique way to prevent motor neuron loss, our data also suggest that additional strategies may also be required for maintenance of neuromuscular connections and full functional recovery. However, simply maintaining motor neurons in patients would be the first step of a therapeutic advance for this devastating and incurable disease, while future strategies focus on the maintenance of the neuromuscular junction."
https://openalex.org/W2131718574,"The tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle is an essential metabolic network in all oxidative organisms and provides precursors for anabolic processes and reducing factors (NADH and FADH2) that drive the generation of energy. Here, we show that this metabolic network is also an integral part of the oxidative defence machinery in living organisms and α-ketoglutarate (KG) is a key participant in the detoxification of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Its utilization as an anti-oxidant can effectively diminish ROS and curtail the formation of NADH, a situation that further impedes the release of ROS via oxidative phosphorylation. Thus, the increased production of KG mediated by NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (NADP-ICDH) and its decreased utilization via the TCA cycle confer a unique strategy to modulate the cellular redox environment. Activities of α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (KGDH), NAD-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (NAD-ICDH), and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) were sharply diminished in the cellular systems exposed to conditions conducive to oxidative stress. These findings uncover an intricate link between TCA cycle and ROS homeostasis and may help explain the ineffective TCA cycle that characterizes various pathological conditions and ageing."
https://openalex.org/W1966091165,"Background A major obstacle for successful cancer treatment often is the development of drug resistance in cancer cells during chemotherapy. Therefore, there is an urgent need for novel drugs with improved efficacy against tumor cells and with less toxicity on normal cells. Artesunate (ART), a powerful anti-malarial herbal compound, has been shown to inhibit growth of various tumor cell lines in vitro and of xenografted Kaposi's sarcoma in mice in vivo. However, the molecular mechanisms by which ART exerts its cytotoxicity have not been elucidated. The ART-class of anti-malarial compounds is attractive due to their activity against multidrug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax strains. Another salient feature of these compounds is the lack of severe side effects in malaria patients. Methodology and Principal Findings In this study, we used T-cell leukemias as a model system to study the molecular mechanisms of ART-induced apoptosis. The most typical anticancer drugs are DNA intercalators such as Doxorubicin. To investigate drug sensitivity and resistance, we chose a Doxorubicin-resistant leukemia cell line and investigated the killing effect of ART on these cells. We show that ART induces apoptosis in leukemic T cells mainly through the mitochondrial pathway via generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), a mechanism different from Doxorubicin. This is confirmed by the fact that the antioxidant N-Acetyle-Cysteine (NAC) could completely block ROS generation and, consequently, inhibited ART-induced apoptosis. Therefore, ART can overcome the Doxorubicin-resistance and induce the Doxorubicin-resistant leukemia cells to undergo apoptosis. We also show that ART can synergize with Doxorubicin to enhance apoptotic cell death in leukemic T cells. This synergistic effect can be largely explained by the fact that ART and Doxorubicin use different killing mechanisms. Conclusions Our studies raise the possibility to develop ART in combination with other established anticancer drugs which induce apoptosis through the pathways or mechanisms different from ART."
https://openalex.org/W2001115224,"Hyperforin, a bicyclic polyprenylated acylphloroglucinol derivative, is the main active principle of St. John's wort extract responsible for its antidepressive profile. Hyperforin inhibits the neuronal serotonin and norepinephrine uptake comparable to synthetic antidepressants. In contrast to synthetic antidepressants directly blocking neuronal amine uptake, hyperforin increases synaptic serotonin and norepinephrine concentrations by an indirect and yet unknown mechanism. Our attempts to identify the molecular target of hyperforin resulted in the identification of TRPC6. Hyperforin induced sodium and calcium entry as well as currents in TRPC6-expressing cells. Sodium currents and the subsequent breakdown of the membrane sodium gradients may be the rationale for the inhibition of neuronal amine uptake. The hyperforin-induced cation entry was highly specific and related to TRPC6 and was suppressed in cells expressing a dominant negative mutant of TRPC6, whereas phylogenetically related channels, i.e., TRPC3 remained unaffected. Furthermore, hyperforin induces neuronal axonal sprouting like nerve growth factor in a TRPC6-dependent manner. These findings support the role of TRPC channels in neurite extension and identify hyperforin as the first selective pharmacological tool to study TRPC6 function. Hyperforin integrates inhibition of neurotransmitter uptake and neurotrophic property by specific activation of TRPC6 and represents an interesting lead-structure for a new class of antidepressants."
https://openalex.org/W2065740422,"DDX3 is a human RNA helicase with plethoric functions. Our previous studies have indicated that DDX3 is a transcriptional regulator and functions as a tumor suppressor. In this study, we use a bicistronic reporter to demonstrate that DDX3 specifically represses cap-dependent translation but enhances hepatitis C virus internal ribosome entry site-mediated translation in vivo in a helicase activity-independent manner. To elucidate how DDX3 modulates translation, we identified translation initiation factor eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) as a DDX3-binding partner. Interestingly, DDX3 utilizes a consensus eIF4E-binding sequence YIPPHLR to interact with the functionally important dorsal surface of eIF4E in a similar manner to other eIF4E-binding proteins. Furthermore, cap affinity chromatography analysis suggests that DDX3 traps eIF4E in a translationally inactive complex by blocking interaction with eIF4G. Point mutations within the consensus eIF4E-binding motif in DDX3 impair its ability to bind eIF4E and result in a loss of DDX3's regulatory effects on translation. All these features together indicate that DDX3 is a new member of the eIF4E inhibitory proteins involved in translation initiation regulation. Most importantly, this DDX3-mediated translation regulation also confers the tumor suppressor function on DDX3. Altogether, this study demonstrates regulatory roles and action mechanisms for DDX3 in translation, cell growth and likely viral replication."
https://openalex.org/W1988075499,"Clostridial botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) exert their neuroparalytic action by arresting synaptic exocytosis. Intoxication requires the disulfide-linked, di-chain protein to undergo conformational changes in response to pH and redox gradients across the endosomal membrane with consequent formation of a protein-conducting channel by the heavy chain (HC) that translocates the light chain (LC) protease into the cytosol. Here, we investigate the role of the disulfide bridge in the dynamics of protein translocation. We utilize a single channel/single molecule assay to characterize in real time the BoNT channel and chaperone activities in Neuro 2A cells under conditions that emulate those prevalent across endosomes. We show that the disulfide bridge must remain intact throughout LC translocation; premature reduction of the disulfide bridge after channel formation arrests translocation. The disulfide bridge must be on the trans compartment to achieve productive translocation of LC; disulfide disruption on the cis compartment or within the bilayer during translocation aborts it. We demonstrate that a peptide linkage between LC and HC in place of a disulfide bridge is insufficient for productive LC translocation. The disulfide linkage, therefore, dictates the outcome of translocation: productive passage of cargo or abortive channel occlusion by cargo. Based on these and previous findings we suggest a sequence of events for BoNT LC translocation to be HC insertion, coupled LC unfolding, and protein conduction through the HC channel in an N to C terminus orientation and ultimate release of the LC from the HC by reduction of the disulfide bridge concomitant with LC refolding in the cytosol.

The BoNT polypeptide is then proteolytically cleaved by bacterial or host proteases into the activated di-chain form: an ∼50-kDa light chain (LC) and an ∼100-kDa heavy chain (HC). The LC and HC are cross-linked by a disulfide bond between the two chains. Structurally, BoNTs consist of three modules (1Schiavo G. Matteoli M. Montecucco C. Physiol.

The crystal structure of BoNT/B in complex with a peptide from the luminal domain of synaptotagmin II has defined the surface determinants that account for the high specificity of binding of the toxin to neurons (23Chai Q.

Nature. 2006; 444: 1092-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). A key step in the intoxication process is the translocation of endocytosed toxin across intracellular membranes to reach its cytosolic targets (1Schiavo G. Matteoli M. Montecucco C. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 717-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar, 15Simpson L.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2004; 44: 167-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). It was postulated that the acid pH of endocytic vesicles induces a conformational change that promotes insertion of the HC into acidic endosomal membranes, where the HC assembles into a protein-conducting channel with the LC as cargo translocated into the cytosol (1Schiavo G. Matteoli M. Montecucco C. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 717-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar, 25Finkelstein A. J. Physiol. 1990; 84: 188-190Google Scholar, 26Gambale F. Montal M. Biophys. J. 1988; 53: 771-783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Previously, we demonstrated that the HC of BoNT/A acts as both a channel and a transmembrane chaperone for the LC to ensure a translocation-competent conformation during its transit from the acidic endosome into the cytosol, thereby recovering the endopeptidase activity of BoNT LC (27Koriazova L.K. Montal M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Here, we probed the role of the disulfide bridge in LC translocation, focusing on the interactions between the HC channel/chaperone and its LC cargo under conditions that closely emulate those prevalent at the endosome. We utilized a previously developed assay in Neuro 2A cells to monitor interactions between the HC and the LC during translocation with single molecule sensitivity (28Fischer A. Montal M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 10447-10452Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). This assay led to the identification of intermediate channel conductances that reflect permissive stages during LC translocation for both BoNT/A and BoNT/E (28Fischer A. Montal M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 10447-10452Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Further, we showed that productive translocation requires proteolytic cleavage of LC cargo from the HC channel (28Fischer A. Montal M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 10447-10452Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In this work we use the assay to examine the consequences of disulfide linkage disruption by chemical reductants accessible to different sides of the membrane. The disulfide linkage emerges as a crucial determinant required for chaperone function and LC translocation and release. These and previous findings indicate that BoNT translocation involves an acid pH-induced membrane insertion step coupled to LC unfolding and entry into the HC chaperone/channel, LC protein conduction through the HC channel in an N- to C-terminal orientation, and subsequent release of the LC cargo from chaperone by reduction of the disulfide bridge concomitant with LC refolding at the cytosol. Unless otherwise specified, all chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Purified native BoNT/A holotoxin and HC and BoNT/E holotoxin were from Metabiologics. The ING2 BoNT/A LC-specific monoclonal antibody was kindly provided by Dr. James Marks (University of California, San Francisco). Cell Culture—Neuro 2A neuroblastoma cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Cells were passaged in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (BioWhittaker) supplemented with penicillin 10 mm/streptomycin 10 μg/ml/glutamine 2 mm (Invitrogen), and 5% newborn bovine serum (Invitrogen). Cells were plated onto Matrigel (BD Biosciences)-coated glass coverslips at a density of ∼500 cells/coverslip and cultured at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 1-3 days prior to patch clamp recordings. Patch Clamp Recordings—Patch pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass (Hilgenberg, Lambrecht, Germany), fire-polished, and used at 3.5-7.0 MΩ resistance when immersed in recording solution. Excised patches in the inside-out configuration were used (29Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15174) Google Scholar). After gigaohm (GΩ) seal formation, the patch was excised from the cell, removed, and reimmersed through the air-water interface to achieve an inside-out configuration. Current recordings were obtained under voltage clamp conditions by the application of consecutive voltage steps 800 ms in duration from +50 mV to -150 mV at a sampling frequency 20 kHz. Records were acquired and analyzed using the patch clamp amplifier system (List EPC-9; HEKA Electronik) fitted with an ITC-16 interface (Instrutech, Port Washington, NY) and the Pulse/PulseFit acquisition and analysis software (HEKA). Data were further analyzed using Clampfit v.9.2 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA), Microsoft Excel, and IGOR Pro (Wavemetrics, Portland, OR). All experiments were conducted at 22 ± 2 °C. Solutions—To emulate endosomal conditions the trans compartment (bath) solution contained (in mm) NaCl 200, NaMOPS [3-(N-morpholino) propanesulfonic acid] 5, (pH 7.0 with HCl), tris-(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine (TCEP) 0.25, ZnCl2 1, and the cis compartment (pipette) solution contained (in mm) NaCl 200, NaMES [2-(N-morpholino) ethanesulfonic acid] 5, (pH 5.3 with HCl). The osmolarity of both solutions was determined to be 390 mosm. ZnCl2 was used to block endogenous channel activity specific to Neuro 2A cells (30Carpaneto A. Accardi A. Pisciotta M. Gambale F. Exp. Brain Res. 1999; 124: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 31Lascola C.D. Nelson D.J. Kraig R.P. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1679-1692Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). BoNT reconstitution and channel insertion was achieved by supplementing 5 μg/ml BoNT holotoxin or HC to the pipette solution, which was set to an endosomal pH of 5.3. BoNT/E experiments were performed with 40 μm trypsin in the trans compartment. GΩ seal formation was optimized as follows: The pipette tip was first dipped in the pipette solution in the absence of BoNT and then back-filled with solution containing BoNT. Data Analysis—Analysis was performed on single bursts of each experimental record; a single burst is defined as a set of openings and closings lasting ≥50 ms bounded by quiescent periods of ≥50 ms before and after. BoNT channel activity occurs in bursts, and only single bursts were analyzed due to the random duration of quiescent periods between these bursts (32Fischer A. Montal M. Neurotox. Res. 2006; 9: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The single channel conductance (γ) was calculated from Gaussian fits to current amplitude histograms. The total number of opening events analyzed was 184,923; the intermediate γ states were defined by a minimum of 500 events. For each experiment, the time course of channel γ change was calculated from γ of each record, where t = 0s corresponds to onset of channel activity and average time course was constructed from the set of individual experiments for a single condition. Average occupancy time of occluded intermediate and unoccluded channel γ states was calculated from the total time the channel resides at a given γ value averaged over the set of individual experiments. The voltage dependence of channel opening was calculated from measurements of the fraction of time that the channel is open (Po) as a function of voltage by integration of γ histograms where γ is 64 pS ≤ γ ≤ 68 pS. Statistical values represent means ± S.E. unless otherwise indicated. n and N denote number of experiments and number of opening events. Fab Generation—The Pierce ImmunoPure Fab Preparation kit (44885) was used to generate Fabs from BoNT/A LC antibody ING2. In short, 3 mg/ml ING2 was incubated in the equivalent volume of immobilized papain at 37 °C for 5 h. The digested ING2 was transferred to a Protein A column to separate the Fabs from the Fc and undigested ING2: the Fabs flow through the column whereas the Fc and undigested IgG are retained and elute later. BoNT/A LC Fabs were quality-checked using SDS-PAGE prior to the single molecule assays. Purified Fabs were concentrated to 1 mg/ml in patching bath solutions prior to incubation with BoNT/A holotoxin. Single Molecule Translocation Assay—Translocation of BoNT/A LC by the BoNT/A HC channel can be monitored in real time and at the single molecule level in excised membrane patches from Neuro 2A cells (28Fischer A. Montal M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 10447-10452Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Translocation requires pH 5.3 on the cis compartment, defined as the compartment containing BoNT/A, and pH 7.0 on the trans compartment, which is supplemented with the membrane-nonpermeable reductant TCEP, conditions that emulate those prevalent across endosomes. Translocation is then observed as a time-dependent increase in Na+ conductance through the HC channel, as illustrated by the control experiment shown in Fig. 1A. The time course of change of the single channel conductance γ after insertion of BoNT/A holotoxin into the membrane displays multiple discrete transient intermediate conductances before achieving a γ of 67.1 ± 2.0 pS (Fig. 1C, red trace). The top panel of Fig. 1A shows that at the onset of translocation small, discrete events with a γ ∼ 12 pS are clearly discerned, as indicated by the segment of the record designated with a black bar that is displayed at higher time resolution under the trace. Progressively, γ increases and, as shown in the middle panel of Fig. 1A, reaches a value of ∼40 pS; note the insertion of two channels into the membrane, designated O1 and O2, which even during the short segment displayed undergo a continuous increase in conductance, ultimately reaching a stable value of 67 pS (bottom panel), a conductance at which they remain for the duration of the experiment (Fig. 1C, red trace). A γ of 67.1 ± 2.0 pS is also the characteristic conductance of isolated HC recorded under identical conditions; therefore it represents the conductance of the unoccluded HC in holotoxin experiments after translocation is complete. We interpret these different conductance events as reporters of discrete intermediate stages during the translocation of the LC across the membrane. During protease translocation, the protein-conducting channel progressively conducts more Na+ around the polypeptide chain before entering an exclusively ion-conductive state. This typical pattern of channel activity for holotoxin proceeds under conditions that mimic those across endosomes and lead to LC translocation and retrieval of protease activity after completion of translocation (27Koriazova L.K.

Thus, we have used this assay to examine the role of the interchain disulfide linkage on the translocation process. Premature Reduction of the Disulfide Bridge after Channel Formation Arrests LC Translocation—Previous work has demonstrated the important role of the disulfide bridge in the translocation process (27Koriazova L.K. Montal M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). We used the differential accessibility of the disulfide linkage between the HC and the LC to TCEP to identify requirements for translocation and showed that LC translocation requires both a pH gradient and a redox gradient, acidic and oxidizing on the cis compartment and neutral and reducing on the trans compartment. Significantly, addition of TCEP only to the cis compartment after acidification fails to evoke channel activity. This is indicative of disulfide shielding arising from the onset of the LC translocation through the HC channel. Here, we pursue this strategy to determine how the disulfide bridge affects the progress of LC translocation. β-mercaptoethanol (βME) is a powerful tool for this task. First, βME does not modify HC channel activity, and preincubation of BoNT/A with reductants results in HC channel activity (data not shown). Additions to the cis compartment cannot be directly made after seal formation; therefore membrane-permeable reagents that equilibrate across both compartments are required. In contrast to TCEP (33Getz E.B. Xiao M. Chakrabarty T. Cooke R. Selvin P.R. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 273: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), βME can traverse the lipid bilayer and reduce the disulfide bridge from either side of the membrane. If the disulfide bridge were translocated first across the membrane and were confined to the TCEP-containing trans compartment during the early steps of translocation, then addition of βME should have no effect on channel activity and growing conductance would end invariably in an unoccluded channel with γ ∼ 67 pS. The conductance growth of holotoxin channels is interrupted by addition of βME immediately after its onset, as shown in Fig. 1B. The top panel shows a single BoNT/A channel undergoing a progressive increase in conductance, comparable with the entry events characteristically displayed by holotoxin (Fig. 1A). Addition of βME, however, precludes entry into the higher γ intermediates, as evidenced in the middle and bottom panels of Fig. 1B in which two channels that inserted into the membrane prior to βME addition remain in one of the low conductance states for the remainder of the experiment (Fig. 1C, black trace). The current transitions are faster and shorter-lived than those typical of unmodified, unoccluded holotoxin, giving the appearance of flickering between low and high conductance states, a characteristic feature of channel block (27Koriazova L.K. Montal M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 34Hille B. Ion Channels of Excitable Cells.3rd Ed. Sinauer, Sunderland, MA2001Google Scholar). Analysis of the results of five experiments of this type (Fig. 2) shows that LC translocation is arrested by reduction of the disulfide linkage after the initiation of translocation. Under these conditions, the holotoxin channel preferentially resides in one of the following conductance states (Fig. 2A): 10, 17, or 31 pS. The lowest two states detected correspond to the entry event identified for holotoxin if translocation is unperturbed (28Fischer A. Montal M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 10447-10452Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar); however, the 31-pS intermediate may correspond to a non-productive, dead-end state for the LC and HC. The increased Po of the low conductance states (γ ∼ 10 and 30 pS, Fig. 2B) and the preponderant occupancy of these occluded intermediate states (Fig. 2C) further demonstrate that intermediate steps in the growing conductance of the holotoxin channel are stabilized, thereby precluding completion of LC translocation: the HC channel is occluded by the LC and translocation is arrested. Premature Reduction of the Disulfide Bridge of Single-chain BoNT/E before Channel Formation Arrests LC Translocation—The finding that interruption of BoNT/A LC translocation results from premature reduction of the disulfide bridge leads to the hypothesis that the LC must be anchored to the HC during translocation. Is any linkage between the LC and HC sufficient to promote LC translocation or is the intact disulfide bridge specifically required? Whereas BoNT/A is cleaved to the mature di-chain within the Clostridium bacteria, BoNT/E is not cleaved before secretion. We previously demonstrated that, for the single-chain BoNT/E, completion of LC translocation proceeds only after proteolytic cleavage by trypsin and disulfide reduction in the trans compartment (28Fischer A. Montal M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 10447-10452Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Single-chain BoNT/E holotoxin is, therefore, an appropriate system to explore the linkage requirements for LC translocation. Accordingly, BoNT/E was incubated with 10 mm TCEP for 30 min at room temperature before the translocation assay. Prereduced BoNT/E displays channel activity as illustrated in Fig. 3A. Channel openings exhibit a γ similar to that of the early intermediates detected for unmodified BoNT/E (28Fischer A. Montal M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 10447-10452Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar); however, these low γ events do not undergo a transition to the higher γ intermediates or to unoccluded states (Fig. 3A). Despite the fact that trypsin is present in the trans compartment, the channel remains in low γ states for the lifetime of the experiment. Analysis of four separate experiments under these conditions demonstrates that the channel activity of prereduced single-chain BoNT/E is different from that of the intact, disulfide cross-linked BoNT/E, never reaching the unoccluded channel state γ ∼ 65 pS. BoNT/E with an intact disulfide bridge transitions from occluded to unoccluded channel activity within 300 s (Fig. 3B, cyan); reduction of the disulfide prior to channel insertion results in a permanently occluded channel with intermediate conductance states at γ ∼ 12 and 26 pS (Fig. 3B, black, and 3C). The conductance intermediate at 26 pS is similar to the prematurely reduced BoNT/A intermediate at 31 pS and may correspond to a dead-end intermediate state. The persistent occupancy of these low γ states and decreased Po with respect to unmodified BoNT/E further demonstrate the requirement for an intact disulfide bridge before channel insertion and throughout LC translocation (Fig. 3, D and E). The peptidic linkage between the LC and HC is insufficient to promote productive LC translocation. The disulfide bond may serve to maintain a translocation-competent conformation of the LC and its close proximity to the HC channel; reduction of the disulfide cross-link may dissociate such dynamic interaction. These results indicate that the disulfide bridge must be on the trans (cytosolic) compartment to achieve productive translocation of the LC; disulfide disruption on the cis compartment or within the bilayer during translocation aborts it. Disulfide disruption at different intermediate γ states resulted in arrested LC translocation; therefore, we infer that completion of LC translocation occurs as the disulfide bridge, C terminus of the LC, enters the cytosolic compartment. This analysis supports a model of N- to C-terminal orientation of cargo during translocation with the C terminus as the last portion to be translocated and exit the channel. We propose that an intact disulfide bridge is a necessary condition for translocation but not for channel insertion, as demonstrated by the facts that the isolated HC channel is unperturbed by chemical reductants (27Koriazova L.K. Montal M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) and that prematurely reduced single-chain BoNT/E exhibits low conductance channel activity. The tight coupling of translocation completion with disulfide reduction strongly argues in favor of the view that LC refolding precludes retrotranslocation. From this viewpoint, refolding in cytosol may be interpreted as a trap that prevents retrotranslocation and dictates the unidirectional nature of the translocation process. The disulfide linkage is, therefore, a crucial aspect of the BoNT toxicity and is required for chaperone function, acting as a principal determinant for cargo translocation and release. An LC-specific Antibody Arrests LC Translocation—To selectively restrict the location of the disulfide linkage to the entry site into the HC and to probe its accessibility to βME, we exploited an LC-specific monoclonal antibody previously documented to block LC translocation (28Fischer A. Montal M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 10447-10452Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). For this type of experiment Fab fragments are preincubated with BoNT/A for 1 h at pH 7 before the translocation assay. Under these conditions, low conductance channels are detected within a few minutes after patch excision (Fig. 4A, top panel). The initial conductances are comparable with those characteristic of the early events in unmodified LC translocation; however, the channels remain in the low conductance states throughout the experiment (Fig. 4A, bottom panel). We interpret these intermediates as early steps in translocation in which the HC has formed a channel that is partially occluded by the LC. Fab binding to the LC allows channel formation and early translocation, presumably stabilizing intermediate protein-protein interactions. However, it locks the channel and the LC in a translocating conformation that is irreversibly incomplete. Reduction of the Disulfide Bridge Releases the Fab-induced HC Channel Block by LC—Reduction of the disulfide bridge between the LC and the HC may facilitate release of the Fab-LC complex, thereby unoccluding the HC channel. The disulfide on the Fab will be concurrently reduced; accordingly, only if the complex remains intact under reducing conditions will release of HC channel block ensue. This model was tested by preincubating the Fab with the BoNT/A, followed by supplementing βME to the trans compartment after the onset of the channel activity. Within minutes of βME addition the low conductance channel does enter the unoccluded channel state (Fig. 4B, bottom panel, and 4C, black) in sharp contrast to the Fab-induced block of channel activity (Fig. 4C, pink). The latency period for release of the HC channel from block by the LC estimated from these measurements is ∼730 s (Fig. 4C, black) as compared with ∼150 s for unabated LC translocation in unmodified holotoxin (Fig. 4C, red). Holotoxin channels under these conditions exhibit discrete transient intermediate conductances at γ ≅ 13, 19, 50, and 57 pS before entering the unoccluded state at γ ≅ 65 pS, as evidenced from analysis of four separate experiments (Fig. 5, A and B). These γ and Po (Fig. 5C, pink) values approximate the low conductance intermediate states of holotoxin during productive LC translocation (Fig. 5C, black). However, the occupancy time in each conductance intermediate is longer as compared with unperturbed holotoxin (Fig. 5C) (28Fischer A. Montal M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 10447-10452Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The low γ intermediate states are stabilized by the Fab (Fig. 5A); however, the prolonged residency in the larger γ intermediates (Fig. 5B) is a unique aspect of this experimental condition. These findings indicate that although the LC is released from the HC channel, the kinetics are different from that of unabated translocation. The release of channel block is consistent with the strong binding affinity of the Fab for the LC: even though the disulfide bridge holding the two Fab subunits has been reduced the binding affinity is sufficient to facilitate dissociation of the LC from the HC channel. In the presence of Fab, therefore, translocation is aborted and disulfide reduction releases the LC to the cis compartment, thereby unblocking the HC channel. Importantly, the unoccluded HC channels that result from this experimental strategy (Fig. 6A, black) are indistinguishable from channels produced by isolated HC/A (Fig. 6A, blue) and by holotoxin/A after productive translocation of LC (Fig. 6A, red). These three experimental conditions lead to a channel entity that exhibits comparable voltage dependence: the V½ is ∼-60 mV (Fig. 6A). In the presence of Fab translocation is aborted (Fig. 6B, pathway ) and disulfide reduction releases the LC on the cis compartment, thereby unblocking the HC channel (Fig. 6B, pathway ). Concluding Remarks—The new findings here described and our interpretation are summarized in the scheme shown in Fig. 6B. The initial condition , illustrated with a surface representation of the crystal structure of BoNT/A (2Lacy D.B. Tepp W. Cohen A.C. DasGupta B.R. Stevens R.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 898-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar), depicts the holotoxin as an aqueous soluble protein at neutral pH. Exposure to a pH gradient and a redox gradient comparable with those across endosomal membranes leads to a conformational change of the holotoxin with the consequent insertion of the HC into the membrane and the onset of LC translocation, manifested as occluded channels with a characteristic small γ (Fig. 6B, pathway ). Productive translocation leads to the release of the LC in the trans compartment, with the ultimate refolding of the LC and retrieval of its protease activity, and the consequent unblocking of the HC (Fig. 6B, pathway ). Two experimental conditions arrest LC translocation and yield occluded HC channels. Preincubation of holotoxin with an LC-specific Fab allows HC channel formation yet it aborts LC translocation (Fig. 6B, pathway ). Premature reduction of the disulfide linkage of BoNT/A holotoxin after channel formation terminates LC translocation (Fig. 6B, pathway ); in accordance, premature reduction of single-chain BoNT/E holotoxin before channel formation allows channel insertion yet aborts LC translocation. Pathway highlights the result that reduction of the disulfide bridge on the cis compartment releases the Fab-induced HC channel block by LC with the ensued dissociation of the LC-Fab complex into the cis compartment, thereby unblocking the HC channel. The unoccluded HC channel entity that results from the productive translocation of the LC (pathway → → ) (32Fischer A. Montal M. Neurotox. Res. 2006; 9: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) or from the disulfide reduction-mediated relief of the Fab-induced HC channel block (pathway → → ) is indistinguishable from that produced by the isolated HC (27Koriazova L.K. Montal M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) in terms of single channel conductance, selectivity, and voltage-dependence features. We thank M.

Because mutations in SOD1 linked to familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) were first identified (3Rosen D.R. Nature. 1993; 364: 362Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), more than 100 mutations at over 70 residues in the 153-amino acid SOD1 protein have been reported (4Valentine J.S. Doucette P.A. Potter S.Z. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 563-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). Most mutations are missense mutations, with a few causing early termination or frame shifts near the carboxyl terminus of the protein. SOD1 mutations account for ∼20% of familial ALS, which is characterized by selective degeneration of motor neurons. SOD1 is primarily a cytosolic protein (5Crapo J.D. Oury T. Rabouille C. Slot J.W. Chang L.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10405-10409Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar), and the active enzyme is a homodimer of two subunits (6Fridovich I. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas. Mol. Biol. 1986; 58: 61-97PubMed Google Scholar). Each subunit contains four cysteine (Cys) residues at positions 6, 57, 111, and 146. An intramolecular disulfide bond between Cys57 and Cys146 of each subunit facilitates its correct folding and stabilizes the active homodimeric structure (7Fisher C.L. Cabelli D.E. Tainer J.A.

ALS-linked mutant SOD1 proteins are turned over more rapidly than wild-type SOD1, and proteasome inhibitors increase the amount of mutant SOD1 (18Hoffman E.K. Wilcox H.M. Scott R.W. Siman R. J.

Dorfin is a RING-finger/IBR (in-between ring-finger) domain-containing ubiquityl ligase, which we previously identified from human spinal cord (22Niwa J. Ishigaki S. Doyu M. Suzuki T. Tanaka K. Sobue G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 281: 706-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and belongs to the RBR (RING-Between rings-RING) family of proteins (23Marin I. Ferrus A. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2002; 19: 2039-2050Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Dorfin physically binds and ubiquitylates various familial ALS-linked SOD1 mutants and subsequently targets them for proteasomal degradation, but it has no effect on the stability of wild-type SOD1 (20Niwa J.

Overexpression of Dorfin protects neuronal cells against the toxic effects of mutant SOD1 and reduces the number of aggregates composed of mutant SOD1 (20Niwa J. Ishigaki S. Hishikawa N. Yamamoto M.

However, the mechanism by which Dorfin discriminates between the normal and pathogenic status of SOD1 proteins remains unknown. There are numerous variants causing familial ALS, thus it seems reasonable that Dorfin recognizes a common protein modification among mutant SOD1s that is not present in wild-type SOD1. In this study, we generated SOD1 proteins with various combinations of the four Cys residues replaced by serines and assessed their disulfide bond status, the changes in the formations of their high molecular weight species, and their neurotoxicity. Moreover, by studying the interaction between Dorfin and these engineered SOD1s, we investigated whether disulfide bonds are critical for Dorfin recognition and ubiquitylation of mutant SOD1s. Construction of Expression Vectors—Construction of pcDNA3.1/MycHis-SOD1, pEGFP-N1-SOD1, and pcDNA4/HisMax-Dorfin vectors were described previously (20Niwa J. Ishigaki S. Hishikawa N. Yamamoto M.

Cys to Ser missense mutations were introduced into pcDNA3.1/MycHis-SOD1 and pEGFP-N1-SOD1 with a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Primer pairs for each Cys to Ser mutant were as follows: 5′-CGAAGGCCGTGTCCGTGCTGAAGGGC-3′ and 5′-GCCCTTCAGCACGGACACGGCCTTCG-3′ for C6S; 5′-GATAATACAGCAGGCTCTACCAGTGCAGGTCC-3′ and 5′-GGACCTGCACTGGTAGAGCCTGCTGTATTATC-3′ for C57S; 5′-CTCAGGAGACCATTCCATCATTGGCCGCAC-3′ and 5′-GTGCGGCCAATGATGGAATGGTCTCCTGAG-3′ for C111S; and 5′-GGAAGTCGTTTGGCTTCTGGTGTAATTGGGATCG-3′ and 5′-CGATCCCAATTACACCAGAAGCCAAACGACTTCC-3 for C146S. Multiple Cys to Ser replaced vectors were obtained by repeatedly applying a mutagenesis. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Antibodies—Neuro-2a cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA), a line derived from mouse neuroblastoma, were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 5 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in the WST-1 assay or Effectene Transfection Reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) in other experiments according to the manufacturers' instructions. To inhibit cellular proteasome activity, cells were treated with 1 μm (except as otherwise indicated) MG132 (Z-Leu-Leu-Leu-al, Sigma) or epoxomicin (Sigma) as indicated concentration for 24 h after overnight transfection. To differentiate Neuro-2a cells, they were changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium culture medium containing 2% fetal calf serum and 20 μm retinoic acid and cultured for 48 h. Primary antibodies used were as follows: anti-Myc mouse monoclonal antibody (9E10, Sigma), anti-Myc rabbit polyclonal antibody (A-14, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-SOD1 rabbit polyclonal antibody (SOD100, Stressgen Bioreagents, Victoria, Canada), anti-α-tubulin mouse monoclonal antibody (B-5-1-1, Sigma), anti-ubiquitin mouse monoclonal antibody (4PD1, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-Xpress mouse monoclonal antibody (Invitrogen). Transgenic Mice—17-week-old symptomatic B6SJL-TgN(SOD1-G93A)1Gur ALS mice overexpressing the human mutant SOD1G93A (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) were used. The experimental design of this study was fully approved by the Experimental Animal Ethical Committee of the Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine. Tissues were homogenized in 10 volumes of lysis buffer (TNE) consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm EDTA with a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete Mini, Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were used for Western blotting analysis. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting Analysis—5 × 105 cells from a 6-cm dish were lysed on ice with 1 ml of TNE lysis buffer. The lysate was centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to remove nuclei and cell debris. Denucleated cell lysates (crude fraction) were separated into supernatant (soluble fraction) and pellet fractions by centrifuging at 20,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The pellets were lysed (insoluble fraction) with 1 ml of TNES lysis buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2% SDS, and 1 mm EDTA with a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete Mini, Roche Diagnostics). Protein concentrations were determined with a DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Immunoprecipitation from the soluble fraction was performed with 2 μg of anti-Myc or anti-Xpress antibodies and Protein A/G Plus-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and the precipitates were washed four times in TNE buffer. Cell lysates or immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE (5-20% gradient gel) and analyzed by Western blotting with ECL plus detection reagents (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences, Piscataway, NJ). Non-reducing SDS-PAGE was conducted without 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME) in the sample buffer. Because omitting reducing agents from the protein samples can lead to adventitious air oxidation or disulfide scrambling, 100 mm iodoacetamide was added to the lysates to prevent these changes during sample preparation. Filter Trap Assay—Each of the various fractions from the cell lysates (crude, soluble, and insoluble fractions) was filtered under vacuum through 0.2-μm cellulose acetate membranes (Sartorius, Gottingen, Germany) followed by two washes in Tris-buffered saline. The membranes were then incubated with 5% milk powder in Tris-buffered saline at room temperature for 1 h, followed by an overnight incubation at 4 °C with anti-Myc antibody in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20. Primary antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences), which were then detected with ECL plus chemiluminescence reagent (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences). To confirm equal loading of proteins, the same samples were blotted onto 0.45-μm nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad) and probed with anti-Myc or anti-α-tubulin antibodies. Neurotoxicity Analysis and Quantification of SOD1 Aggregates—2 × 104 Neuro-2a cells were grown overnight on four-chamber, collagen-coated slides (Nalge Nunc, Rochester, NY) and then transfected with 0.2 μg of pEGFP-N1-SOD1. After overnight incubation, the cells were differentiated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2% fetal calf serum and 20 μm retinoic acid for 48 h. Inclusion bodies were counted in more than 100 randomly selected cells, and the percentages of cells with such inclusions were calculated. Data from three independent experiments were averaged. For the cell viability assay, 5 × 103 Neuro-2a cells were grown in 96-well collagen-coated plates overnight, and then transfected with 0.1 μg of pEGFP-N1-SOD1 or pcDNA3.1/MycHis-SOD1, with or without 0.1 μg of pcDNA4/HisMax-Dorfin. pcDNA4/HisMax mock vector was used as a control. A 4-[3-(4-iodophenyl)-2-(4-nitrophenyl)-2H-5-tetrazolio]-1,3-benzene disulfonate (WST-1)-based cell proliferation assay (Roche Diagnostics) was performed 48 h after differentiation. Absorbance was measured in a multiple plate reader (PowerscanHT, Dainippon Pharmaceutical, Japan). The assay was carried out in triplicate and statistically analyzed by one-way analysis of variance or unpaired t test. Quantitative Analysis of Gene Expression Levels—Total RNA was extracted from Neuro-2a cells expressing SOD1-GFP and their Cys to Ser derivatives by using an RNA Easy Kit (Qiagen), followed by cDNA synthesis primed with oligo(dT) using Superscript II (Invitrogen). The gene expression level was examined by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR using primer sets specific to target genes and QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen). PCR was performed on an iCycler system (Bio-Rad) under the manufacturer's recommended conditions. Isolation of SOD1 Aggregates—Isolation of SOD1 inclusion bodies was carried out according to Lee et al. (24Lee H.J. Lee S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48976-48983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) with a slight modification. 5 × 105 Neuro-2a cells in a 60-mm dish expressing SOD1-GFP were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline before addition of TNE buffer. After a 5-min incubation at room temperature, the supernatant containing Nonidet P-40-soluble proteins was carefully removed from dishes. After gentle washing of dishes with phosphate-buffered saline, the Nonidet P-40-insoluble materials were scraped and incubated on ice for 5 min. The extract was then centrifuged at 80 × g for 15 min. The pellet containing big inclusions was put onto a slide glass, sealed with a coverslip, and observed under a BX51 epifluorescence microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Cycloheximide Chase Analysis—Neuro-2a cells grown on 6-cm dishes were transfected with 1 μg of pcDNA3.1/MycHis-SOD1 with or without 1 μg of pcDNA4/HisMax-Dorfin. 24 h after transfection, cycloheximide (50 μg/ml) was added to the culture medium, and the cells were harvested at the indicated time points. The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-Myc antibody. The intensities of the bands were quantified by Image-Gauge software (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan). The assay was carried out in triplicate and statistically analyzed by one-way analysis of variance or unpaired t test. Proteasome Inhibition Increases SDS-resistant Disulfide-linked Species as Well as Insoluble Ones of ALS-linked Mutant SOD1—Mutant SOD1 is a fairly unstable protein, and the increased turnover of mutant SOD1 is mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (18Hoffman E.K. Wilcox H.M. Scott R.W. Siman R. J. Neurol. Sci. 1996; 139: 15-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 19Johnston J.A. Dalton M.J. Gurney M.E. Kopito R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12571-12576Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Thus, we first examined the effect of proteasome inhibition on mutant SOD1 proteins. When cellular proteasome activity was blocked by the proteasome inhibitor MG132, the level of soluble mutant SOD1G85R and SOD1G93A increased in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1B, arrowhead), and an SDS-resistant mutant SOD1 dimer appeared (Fig. 1B, arrow). The increase in the amount of wild-type SOD1 was much smaller than that of mutant SOD1 (Fig. 1B, arrowhead). Detergent-insoluble, sedimentable mutant SOD1 also increased as proteasome activity was inhibited (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, as the proteasome activity was inhibited, aberrant high molecular weight SDS-resistant disulfide-linked mutant SOD1G85R and SOD1G93A became more abundant (Fig. 1A, asterisk). There were almost no SDS-resistant disulfide-linked species of the wild-type SOD1. The same findings were obtained when blots were probed with anti-SOD1 antibody (supplemental Fig. S1A). These results were also confirmed with epoxomicin, a selective and irreversible proteasome inhibitor (supplemental Fig. S1B). Thus, intermolecular disulfide bond-linked mutant SOD1 is unstable and prone to degradation by the proteasome. Free Cys6 and Cys111 Are Important for Generating Disulfide Bond-linked Species and Insoluble, Sedimentable Forms of Mutant Human SOD1—We examined the role of Cys residues in the formation of aberrant disulfide-bond linked high molecular weight species. Various combinations of the four Cys residues at positions 6, 57, 111, and 146 replaced with serines were introduced into SOD1 protein-expression vectors using site-directed mutagenesis. The effects of amino acid replacement at one of the four Cys residues, at two of the four Cys residues, and at all four Cys residues on wild-type and two familial ALS-linked SOD1 mutants, SOD1G85R and SOD1G93A, were investigated. We used Myc-His-tagged SOD1 expression vectors and an antibody against the tag peptide to detect SOD1 protein so as to avoid possible reduced detection of SOD1 with multiple amino acids changes by the anti-SOD1 antibody. Interestingly, none of the Cys residue replacements generated disulfide-linked species in wild-type SOD1 proteins (Fig. 2, left panel). Under reducing conditions, replacement of Cys6 had a stronger effect on the formation of disulfide-linked species of mutant SOD1 than did the other three Cys residue replacements (Fig. 2, middle and right panels, asterisk). Combinations of replacing Cys6 and one of the other Cys residues further attenuated the aberrant disulfide-linking of mutant SOD1 seen with the single substitution of Cys6 (Fig. 2, filled circle). Under usual reducing conditions, the same reduced oligomerization of mutant SOD1 was observed when combinations of Cys6 and other Cys residues were replaced (Fig. 2, arrow). The detergent-insoluble, sedimentable form of mutant SOD1 was also reduced especially if both Cys6 and Cys111 were replaced (Fig. 2, filled square). Replacement of all four Cys residues completely abolished the disulfide-linked species in the non-reducing condition and the oligomeric, detergent-insoluble form of mutant SOD1 in the reducing condition (Fig. 2, lane 4×CS). Because simultaneous substitutions of Cys6 and Cys111 had the strongest effects on the formation of aberrant species of mutant SOD1 in both non-reducing and reducing conditions, we compared C6S and C111S mutants with C57S and C146S mutants in the following experiments. Substituting Both Cys6 and Cys111 Greatly Reduces High Molecular Weight Aggregate Formation and Ubiquitylation of Mutant SOD1—In studies of polyglutamine disorders, it has been demonstrated that high molecular weight aggregates of mutant proteins are retained by filtration through cellulose acetate (25Scherzinger E. Lurz R. Turmaine M. Mangiarini L. Hollenbach B. Hasenbank R. Bates G.P. Davies S.W. Lehrach H. Wanker E.E. Cell. 1997; 90: 549-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar, 26Bailey C.K. Andriola I.F. Kampinga H.H. Merry D.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 515-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Cellulose acetate membranes usually bind protein very poorly and are used to trap high molecular weight structures from complex mixtures through filtration. This assay was also successfully applied to detect mutant SOD1 aggregation (27Wang J. Xu G. Borchelt D.R. Neurobiol. Dis. 2002; 9: 139-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Thus we used a cellulose acetate filter trap assay to investigate whether SOD1 proteins with Cys substitutions are retained in high molecular weight aggregates from lysates of SOD1-MycHis expressing Neuro-2a cells. Cells were lysed in TNE buffer, fractionated into crude denucleated, soluble, and insoluble fractions, and each fraction was then filtered through a 0.22-μm cellulose acetate membrane. Subsequent staining with anti-Myc antibody revealed trapped SOD1 proteins (Fig. 3A, upper panel). Interestingly, high molecular weight aggregates were abundantly detected in mutant SOD1G85R, SOD1G93A, and their C57S and C146S derivatives. Replacements of Cys6 and Cys111 greatly reduced high molecular weight structures of mutant SOD1. No high molecular weight aggregates were present in either wild-type SOD1 or their Cys-substituted mutants. Mutant, but not wild-type, SOD1 is conjugated to a multiubiquitin chain and degraded at the proteasome (20Niwa J. Ishigaki S. Hishikawa N. Yamamoto M. Doyu M. Murata S. Tanaka K. Taniguchi N. Sobue G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36793-36798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 28Urushitani M. Kurisu J. Tsukita K. Takahashi R. J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 1030-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). To assess whether SOD1 proteins are ubiquitylated, we carried out an in vivo ubiquitylation analysis by expressing SOD1WT, SOD1G85R, SOD1G93A, and their Cys to Ser mutants in Neuro-2a cells in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132. When SOD1 was then immunoprecipitated, mutant SOD1s, but not wild-type SOD1, were polyubiquitylated (Fig. 3B, lane 1). Replacement of both Cys6 and Cys111 abolished ubiquitylation of mutant SOD1, whereas replacement of Cys57 and Cys146 did not affect the ubiquitylation status of mutant SOD1 (Fig. 3B, lane 2 versus lane 3). Wild-type SOD1 and its Cys-replacement mutants were not ubiquitylated at all. Replacing only one of the four Cys residues attenuated neither the formation of high molecular weight species nor the ubiquitylation of mutant SOD1 (data not shown). Thus, the presence of both Cys6 and Cys111 is important for high molecular weight aggregate formation and ubiquitylation of mutant SOD1. Disulfide bond formation at Cys6 or Cys111 is critical step for ubiquitylation of mutant SOD1. Formation of Disulfide-linked Species of Mutant SOD1 Strongly Correlates with Visible Aggregate Formation and Neurotoxicity—Expression of mutant, but not wild-type, SOD1 induces large perinuclear intracytoplasmic aggregates in differentiated Neuro-2a cells and reduces cellular viability (20Niwa J. Ishigaki S. Hishikawa N. Yamamoto M. Doyu M. Murata S. Tanaka K. Taniguchi N. Sobue G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36793-36798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). We analyzed the role of mutant SOD1 Cys residues in aggregate formation and neurotoxicity in Neuro-2a cells. Replacements of Cys6 and Cys111 significantly reduced the percentage of mutant SOD1G85R and SOD1G93A cells with visible aggregates (Fig. 4A). To further demonstrate the extent of aggregate formation, we isolated SOD1 aggregates with a procedure according to Lee et al. (24Lee H.J. Lee S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48976-48983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Differentiated Neuro-2a cells bearing SOD1-GFP aggregates were extracted with 1% Nonidet P-40 in the culture dish, and the Nonidet P-40-soluble proteins were gently removed. Under this condition, the soluble monomeric SOD1 was completely removed, and the aggregates remained in the culture dish due to their association with unknown structures (24Lee H.J. Lee S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48976-48983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The remaining Nonidet P-40-insoluble portion was then scraped and centrifuged at 80 × g. After the centrifugation at 80 × g for 15 min, the pellet fraction was found to contain exclusively the large inclusion bodies. Replacements of Cys6 and Cys111 markedly reduced the number of inclusion bodies in G93A mutant SOD1-GFP (Fig. 4B). Mutant SOD1G85R and SOD1G93A, but not wild-type SOD1, are toxic in differentiated Neuro-2a cells as previously described (20Niwa J. Ishigaki S. Hishikawa N. Yamamoto M. Doyu M. Murata S. Tanaka K. Taniguchi N. Sobue G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36793-36798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). However, replacement of the Cys6 and Cys111 residues markedly reduced this neurotoxicity (Fig. 4C), which was not affected by replacing the Cys57 and Cys146 residues. There were no significant differences among the expression levels of all the constructs (Fig. 4D). Thus, changes in inclusion formation and toxicity are not due to differences in altered expression. These results provide evidence of direct links among intermolecular disulfide bonding, ubiquitylated complex formation, visible aggregate formation, and neurotoxicity. Preferential Occurrence of Disulfide-cross-linked Mutant SOD1 in the Affected Lesions of ALS Model Mice—Although mutant SOD1 is expressed at similar levels in both neuronal and non-neuronal tissues, the aggregated and ubiquitylated forms are selectively found in the pathological lesions of patients and mutant SOD1-transgenic mice (29Gurney M.E.

https://openalex.org/W2002167899,"The integrity and function of the epithelial barrier is dependent on the apical junctional complex (AJC) composed of tight and adherens junctions and regulated by the underlying actin filaments. A major F-actin motor, myosin II, was previously implicated in regulation of the AJC, however direct evidence of the involvement of myosin II in AJC dynamics are lacking and the molecular identity of the myosin II motor that regulates formation and disassembly of apical junctions in mammalian epithelia is unknown. We investigated the role of nonmuscle myosin II (NMMII) heavy chain isoforms, A, B, and C in regulation of epithelial AJC dynamics and function. Expression of the three NMMII isoforms was observed in model intestinal epithelial cell lines, where all isoforms accumulated within the perijunctional F-actin belt. siRNA-mediated downregulation of NMMIIA, but not NMMIIB or NMMIIC expression in SK-CO15 colonic epithelial cells resulted in profound changes of cell morphology and cell-cell adhesions. These changes included acquisition of a fibroblast-like cell shape, defective paracellular barrier, and substantial attenuation of the assembly and disassembly of both adherens and tight junctions. Impaired assembly of the AJC observed after NMMIIA knock-down involved dramatic disorganization of perijunctional actin filaments. These findings provide the first direct non-pharmacological evidence of myosin II-dependent regulation of AJC dynamics in mammalian epithelia and highlight a unique role of NMMIIA in junctional biogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1977795397,"The increase of induced gamma-band responses (iGBRs; oscillations >30 Hz) elicited by familiar (meaningful) objects is well established in electroencephalogram (EEG) research. This frequency-specific change at distinct locations is thought to indicate the dynamic formation of local neuronal assemblies during the activation of cortical object representations. As analytically power increase is just a property of a single location, phase-synchrony was introduced to investigate the formation of large-scale networks between spatially distant brain sites. However, classical phase-synchrony reveals symmetric, pair-wise correlations and is not suited to uncover the directionality of interactions. Here, we investigated the neural mechanism of visual object processing by means of directional coupling analysis going beyond recording sites, but rather assessing the directionality of oscillatory interactions between brain areas directly. This study is the first to identify the directionality of oscillatory brain interactions in source space during human object recognition and suggests that familiar, but not unfamiliar, objects engage widespread reciprocal information flow. Directionality of cortical information-flow was calculated based upon an established Granger-Causality coupling-measure (partial-directed coherence; PDC) using autoregressive modeling. To enable comparison with previous coupling studies lacking directional information, phase-locking analysis was applied, using wavelet-based signal decompositions. Both, autoregressive modeling and wavelet analysis, revealed an augmentation of iGBRs during the presentation of familiar objects relative to unfamiliar controls, which was localized to inferior-temporal, superior-parietal and frontal brain areas by means of distributed source reconstruction. The multivariate analysis of PDC evaluated each possible direction of brain interaction and revealed widespread reciprocal information-transfer during familiar object processing. In contrast, unfamiliar objects entailed a sparse number of only unidirectional connections converging to parietal areas. Considering the directionality of brain interactions, the current results might indicate that successful activation of object representations is realized through reciprocal (feed-forward and feed-backward) information-transfer of oscillatory connections between distant, functionally specific brain areas."
https://openalex.org/W2016972426,"Background Non-polio human enteroviruses are the leading cause of aseptic meningitis in children. The role of enterovirus PCR for diagnosis and management of aseptic meningitis has not been fully explored. Methodology/Principal Findings A retrospective study was conducted to determine the epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory characteristics of aseptic meningitis and to evaluate the role of enterovirus PCR for the diagnosis and management of this clinical entity. The medical records of children who had as discharge diagnosis aseptic or viral meningitis were reviewed. A total of 506 children, median age 5 years, were identified. The annual incidence rate was estimated to be 17/100,000 children less than 14 years of age. Most of the cases occurred during summer (38%) and autumn (24%). The dominant clinical symptoms were fever (98%), headache (94%) and vomiting (67%). Neck stiffness was noted in 60%, and irritation in 46% of the patients. The median number of CSF cell count was 201/mm3 with polymorphonuclear predominance (>50%) in 58.3% of the cases. Enterovirus RNA was detected in CSF in 47 of 96 (48.9%) children tested. Children with positive enterovirus PCR had shorter hospitalization stay as compared to children who had negative PCR or to children who were not tested (P = 0.01). There were no serious complications or deaths. Conclusions Enteroviruses accounted for approximately one half of cases of aseptic meningitis. PCR may reduce the length of hospitalization and plays important role in the diagnosis and management of children with aseptic meningitis."
https://openalex.org/W2042831722,"Bone marrow macrophages of patients with active and nonactive multiple myeloma (MM), monoclonal gammopathies of undetermined significance (MGUS) and benign anemia (controls) were stimulated for 7 days with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and analysed for the expression of endothelial cell (EC) markers by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR, real-time RT-PCR, western blot and immunofluorescence. Their vasculogenic ability was investigated in vitro in a Matrigel assay and in vivo on bone marrow biopsies through dual immunofluorescence and confocal laser microscopy. Active MM macrophages exposed to VEGF and bFGF acquired EC markers and formed capillary-like structures mimicking paired bone marrow ECs (multiple myeloma patient-derived endothelial cells, MMECs), with major responsiveness compared to macrophages from nonactive MM, MGUS or controls. Bone marrow biopsies of active MM harbored 'mosaic' vessels, being formed by MMECs, EC-like macrophages and macrophages themselves. These figures were rare in nonactive MM and absent in MGUS or controls. Our data indicate that macrophages contribute to build neovessels in active MM through vasculogenic mimicry, and this ability proceeds parallel to progression of the plasma cell tumors. Macrophages may be a target for the MM antivascular treatment."
https://openalex.org/W1977548660,"β-Arrestin2 and its ubiquitination play crucial roles in both internalization and signaling of seven-transmembrane receptors (7TMRs). To understand the connection between ubiquitination and the endocytic and signaling functions of β-arrestin, we generated a β-arrestin2 mutant that is defective in ubiquitination (β-arrestin20K), by mutating all of the ubiquitin acceptor lysines to arginines and compared its properties with the wild type and a stably ubiquitinated β-arrestin2-ubiquitin (Ub) chimera. In vitro translated β-arrestin2 and β-arrestin20K displayed equivalent binding to recombinant β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) reconstituted in vesicles, whereas β-arrestin2-Ub bound ∼4-fold more. In cellular coimmunoprecipitation assays, β-arrestin20K bound nonreceptor partners, such as AP-2 and c-Raf and scaffolded phosphorylated ERK robustly but displayed weak binding to clathrin. Moreover, β-arrestin20K was recruited only transiently to activated receptors at the membrane, did not enhance receptor internalization, and decreased the amount of phosphorylated ERK assimilated into isolated β2AR complexes. Although the wild type β-arrestin2 formed ERK signaling complexes with the β2AR at the membrane, a stably ubiquitinated β-arrestin2-Ub chimera not only stabilized the ERK signalosomes but also led to their endosomal targeting. Interestingly, in cellular fractionation assays, the ubiquitination state of β-arrestin2 favors its distribution in membrane fractions, suggesting that ubiquitination increases the propensity of β-arrestin for membrane association. Our findings suggest that although β-arrestin ubiquitination is dispensable for β-arrestin cytosol to membrane translocation and its “constitutive” interactions with some cytosolic proteins, it nevertheless is a prerequisite both for the formation of tight complexes with 7TMRs in vivo and for membrane compartment interactions that are crucial for downstream endocytic and signaling processes. β-Arrestin2 and its ubiquitination play crucial roles in both internalization and signaling of seven-transmembrane receptors (7TMRs).

More recently, however, it was found that β-arrestin binding to receptors not only stops G protein-mediated second messenger signaling but also engages several novel signaling pathways, including mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades (4Lefkowitz R.J.

The differing affinity and trafficking patterns of GFP-β-arrestins induced by several 7TMRs have led to the classification of receptors into two groups, Class A and Class B (10Oakley R.H.

Class A receptors (e.g. β2-adrenergic, α1b-adrenergic, μ-opioid, endothelin 1A, and dopamine D1A receptors) show higher affinity for β-arrestin2 than β-arrestin1 and recruit GFP-β-arrestins only to the plasma membrane. Class B receptors (e.g. vasopressin V2, angiotensin AT1a, neurotensin1, thyrotropin-releasing hormone, and neurokinin NK-1 receptors) bind to both β-arrestin1 and -2 with equal affinity and cotraffic and colocalize with GFP-β-arrestin in endocytic vesicles. Thus, complexes formed between β-arrestin and Class A receptors are transient and exist only at the membrane, whereas those formed between β-arrestin and Class B receptors are stable and persist after receptor endocytosis (10Oakley R.H.

These differential patterns of β-arrestin2 recruitment correlate with the amplitude of β-arrestin-bound phosphorylated ERK1/2 (pERK). Class B receptors, such as the angiotensin 1a and the V2 vasopressin receptors activate a β-arrestin-bound pool of ERK more persistently than Class A receptors, such as the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) and the α1b-adrenergic receptor (11Tohgo A. Choy E.W. Gesty-Palmer D. Pierce K.L. Laporte S. Oakley R.H. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Luttrell L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6258-6267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar).β-Arrestins also become ubiquitinated (attachment of ubiquitin (Ub) on lysine residues) upon agonist stimulation of various 7TMRs. Upon β2AR stimulation, Mdm2 (mouse double minute2), a RING (really interesting new gene) type E3 ligase, ubiquitinates β-arrestin2, and this modification is required for rapid internalization of the receptor (12Shenoy S.K. McDonald P.H. Kohout T.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1307-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). The pattern of β-arrestin ubiquitination correlates with the stability of receptor-β-arrestin interaction (i.e. transient interaction (Class A) is associated with transient ubiquitination, and persistent interaction (Class B) is associated with sustained ubiquitination) (13Shenoy S.K. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14498-14506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 14Perroy J. Pontier S. Charest P.G. Aubry M. Bouvier M. Nat. Methods. 2004; 1: 203-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Exchanging the carboxyl-terminal amino acid residues of these two types of receptors reverses the patterns of β-arrestin trafficking as well as the time course of ubiquitination and the extent of β-arrestin-bound ERK activation (11Tohgo A. Choy E.W. Gesty-Palmer D. Pierce K.L. Laporte S. Oakley R.H. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Luttrell L.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 32248-32257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Additionally, translational fusion of ubiquitin to the C terminus of β-arrestin (β-arrestin2-Ub) leads to its cotrafficking and colocalization with the β2AR (Class A) in endocytic vesicles, thus mimicking a Class B trafficking pattern (13Shenoy S.K. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14498-14506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar).Interestingly, specific lysine residues are targeted for modification in response to agonist stimulation of a particular 7TMR. For example, angiotensin 1a receptor (AT1aR)-dependent sustained β-arrestin ubiquitination occurs primarily at lysines 11 and 12 in β-arrestin2 (16Shenoy S.K. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15315-15324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Mutation of these lysines to arginine residues leads to the reversal of angiotensin II-stimulated β-arrestin ubiquitination from a sustained to a transient pattern, with a corresponding reversal of AT1aR-β-arrestin binding from stable endosome-localized complexes to transiently associated complexes seen only at the plasma membrane.In an attempt to understand the role of ubiquitination in the regulation of the endocytic and signaling functions of β-arrestin, we generated a β-arrestin2 mutant (β-arrestin20K) that is defective in ubiquitination by mutating all of the ubiquitin acceptor lysines in β-arrestin2 to arginines and compared it with the wild type and a stably ubiquitinated form in its ability to interact with 7TMRs and nonreceptor partners as well as its capability to facilitate receptor internalization and signaling.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Lines, Reagents, and Plasmids—COS-7 and HEK-293 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin and transiently transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). HEK-293 cells were maintained in minimal essential medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum and transiently transfected with FuGene 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science). M2 anti-FLAG affinity-agarose beads, isoproterenol, arginine-vasopressin peptide, anti-FLAG M1 and M2 antibodies, fluorescein isothiocyanate-anti-mouse secondary IgG, and N-ethylmaleimide were from Sigma. Ubiquitin antibody FK2 was from Biomol. Monoclonal antibody 12CA5 to HA epitope was from Roche Applied Science. Alexa 594 and Alexa 633, conjugated secondary antibodies, were from Invitrogen. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were from GE/Amersham Biosciences. Detection of active ERK was with a rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK (1:2000 for Western blot and 1:200 for immunostaining; Cell Signaling Technology). Total ERK was detected with anti-MAPK1/2 (1:10,000 dilution for Western blots; Millipore). A1CT, a rabbit polyclonal antibody to the β-arrestin1 C terminus generated in the Lefkowitz laboratory was used to detect β-arrestin isoforms.Rat β-arrestin2/pEGFPN1 plasmid has been previously described (17Wei H. Ahn S. Shenoy S.K. Karnik S.S. Hunyady L. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10782-10787Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). A 1500-bp DNA fragment encoding β-arrestin2-Ub was subcloned into the KpnI and ApaI sites of pEGFPC1 vector to obtain the expression plasmid for GFP-β-arrestin2-Ub. The lysine residue at position 48 in Ub was replaced with arginine using a QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). GFP-β-arrestin2-Ub used in this work actually represents GFP-β-arrestin2-UbK48R.Five rounds of mutations accomplished the construction of β-arrestin20K, each mutagenesis step targeting 5-7 lysine residues. We used the QuikChange® multisite-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and followed the manufacturer's instructions for the design of oligonucleotides and PCR protocols. The DNA fragment encoding β-arrestin20K was later cloned into pEGFP-N1 to yield β-arrestin20K-GFP. All DNA constructs were verified by sequencing. HA-β2AR plasmid was a gift from Dr. Neil Freedman (Duke University); HA-V2R plasmid was provided by Dr. Marc Caron (Duke University). Myc-c-Raf and RFP-ERK2 have been previously reported (18Luttrell L.M. Roudabush F.L. Choy E.W. Miller W.E. Field M.E. Pierce K.L. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2449-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar).To achieve equivalent expression of β-arrestin2 WT and lysine mutants (Fig. 1), we transfected cells on a 100-mm dish with 1 μg of DNA for the WT and -7K, 3 μg of DNA for -14K, -19K, and -26K, and 2.5 μg for -31K. For the GFP-tagged plasmids (Fig. 5), 1 μg was used for the WT and -7K, and 2 μg was used for the rest.FIGURE 5Translocation of GFP-tagged β-arrestin2 lysine mutants to activated β2ARs. HEK-293 cells were transfected with HA-β2AR and the indicated β-arrestin2 plasmid. Cells were stimulated with isoproterenol for 1 min, fixed, and immunostained for the β2AR. Confocal images shown represent one of three similar experiments. β2AR detection is shown in red, β-arrestin fluorescence is shown in green, and overlay panels depict colocalization (yellow).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Immunoprecipitation and Immunodetection—β-Arrestin2-FLAG/pCDNA3, β-arrestin20K-FLAG/pCDNA3.1 or FLAG-β-arrestin2-Ub/pCDNA3.1 were used to immunoprecipitate β-arrestins. To detect active ERK in receptor immunoprecipitates, FLAG-β2AR was co-expressed with GFP-tagged β-arrestin constructs and RFP-ERK2. Cells were serum-starved for 2 h (COS-7) or 4 h (HEK-293) and then stimulated or not for the indicated times with the appropriate agonists. Cells were solubilized in a lysis buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 250 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin (5 μg/ml), aprotinin (5 μg/ml), pepstatin A (1 μg/ml), benzaminidine (100 μm), and 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide. The use of N-ethylmaleimide in lysis buffers in coimmunoprecipitation procedures is an important technical feature, since it stabilizes ubiquitinated species by preventing their deubiquitination. Soluble extracts were mixed with FLAG M2 affinity beads and rotated at 4 °C overnight. Nonspecific binding was eliminated by repeated washes with lysis buffer, and bound protein was eluted with sample buffer containing SDS. The proteins were separated on a gradient gel (4-20%; Invitrogen) and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane for Western blotting. Chemiluminescence detection was performed using SuperSignal® West Pico reagent (Pierce). pERK and β-arrestin signals were quantified by densitometry using GeneTools software.In Vitro Translation of β-Arrestins and β-Arrestin-Recombinant β2 AR Binding—[35S]β-arrestins were in vitro translated using a TNT® T7 quick coupled transcription/translation system (catalog number L1170; Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommended procedure. Briefly, reactions were assembled by mixing appropriate amounts of TNT® Quick Master Mix, [35S]methionine (catalog number AG1094; Amersham Biosciences), and pCDNA3.1-β-arrestin 2 wild type, β-arrestin20K, or β-arrestin2-Ub plasmids in 0.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes. The reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 90 min, and the in vitro translated [35S]β-arrestins were stored at -80 °C before performing binding experiments.To study receptor binding, the in vitro translated [35S]β-arrestins were incubated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA with 14.6 pmol (0.7 μg) of β2AR reconstituted in phospholipid vesicles at room temperature for 1 h. Purified GRK2 (0.5 μg), 80 μm ATP, 50 μm isoproterenol, or 50 μm propranolol were added to the reaction mixture where indicated. After the incubation period, an aliquot of the reaction was set aside to determine input levels of [35S]β-arrestins, and the remaining samples were diluted with ice-cold buffer and centrifuged at 85,000 rpm for 30 min with a bench top Optima TLX ultracentrifuge. After ultracentrifugation, the supernatants were removed, and the pellets were washed with 0.5 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 2 mm EDTA. The samples were centrifuged again, and the wash was repeated five times. Finally, 30 μl of SDS-PAGE buffer were added to each sample, and proteins were separated by 4-20% gel. The gels were dried, and the amounts of β-arrestins bound to the β2AR were determined by autoradiography. Control experiments were performed by the same experimental procedure, except that empty vesicles were used in the place of receptor-containing vesicles. Bands were quantified by densitometry, and the amount of each β-arrestin was normalized to its input levels.Cross-linking—COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with FLAG-β2AR along with pEGFP or β-arrestin20K-GFP. 30 h post-transfection, cells in 100-mm dishes were stimulated at 37 °C in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), with vehicle or agonist. Stimulations were terminated by the addition of dithiobis-maleimidoethane (DTME; Pierce) to a final concentration of 2 mm, and plates were rocked for 40 min at room temperature. Cells were washed three times with PBS/HEPES to remove unreacted DTME and lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate), and receptors were immunoprecipitated.Phospho-ERK Time Course—HEK-293 cells stably expressing the β2AR, transfected with vector, β-arrestin2-FLAG, FLAG-β-arrestin2-Ub, or β-arrestin20K-FLAG on 12-well plates were starved for at least 4 h in serum-free medium prior to stimulation. After stimulation, cells were solubilized by directly adding 2× SDS-sample buffer, followed by boiling at 100 °C for 5 min. For each transfection, an equal portion of the cells was set aside for protein determination (modified Bradford protocol). Equal amounts (μg) of cellular extracts were separated on 4-20% Tris-glycine polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for immunoblotting. Phosphorylated ERK1/2, total ERK1/2, and β-arrestins were detected by immunoblotting with rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK (1:2000; Cell Signaling), anti-MAPK1/2 (1:10,000; Millipore), and anti-β-arrestin (1:3000; A1CT) antibodies, respectively. Chemiluminiscence detection was performed using the SuperSignal West Pico reagent (Pierce), and phosphorylated ERK1/2 immunoblots were quantified using Gene-Tools software.Confocal Microscopy—HEK-293 cells have a favorable morphology, such that sections of cytoplasm and nucleus can be simultaneously imaged; hence, they were used in these experiments. HEK-293 cells on 10-cm dishes were transiently transfected with HA-β2AR along with β-arrestin2-GFP, GFP-β-arrestin2-Ub, or βarrestin20K-GFP. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, cells were plated on collagen-coated 35-mm glass bottom plates. On the following day, cells were starved for at least 2 h in serum-free medium prior to stimulation. After stimulation, cells were fixed with 5% formaldehyde diluted in PBS containing calcium and magnesium. Fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.01% Triton in PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin for 60 min and incubated at room temperature with appropriate primary antibody. The secondary antibody incubations were done for 1 h, followed by repeated washes using PBS. Confocal images were obtained on a Zeiss LSM510 laser-scanning microscope using multitrack sequential excitation (488, 568, and 633 nm) and emission (515-540 nm, GFP; 585-615 nm, Texas Red) filter sets. Live cell GFP images were acquired using a heated (37 °C) microscope stage and collected sequentially using single line excitation (488 nm).Receptor Internalization—FLAG or HA epitope-tagged receptors expressed in HEK-293 cells in 12-well dishes were incubated with or without agonist for 30 min in serum-free medium at 37 °C. Cell surface receptors were labeled with M1 FLAG or 12CA5 monoclonal antibody and with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat antibody to mouse IgG as a secondary antibody. Receptor internalization was quantified as loss of cell surface receptors as measured by fluorescence-assisted cell sorting (Duke University flow cytometry facility).Subcellular Fractionation—Monolayers of COS-7 cells transfected with β-arrestin2 or β-arrestin2-Ub plasmids were gently scraped and collected in PBS containing protease inhibitors and 40 mm NaCl, subjected to two freeze-thaw cycles for lysis. Samples were centrifuged at 800 × g for 5 min to precipitate unlysed cells. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g to separate soluble and membrane components. 40 μg of each fraction was separated on SDS gels and analyzed by Western blotting.RESULTSA Ubiquitin Minus β-Arrestin2 Mutant—To obtain a β-arrestin2 mutant that is not ubiquitinated upon 7TMR stimulation, we made conservative changes of groups of lysines to arginines, overexpressed FLAG-tagged mutants in COS-7 cells, and tested the β-arrestin precipitates for the ubiquitination signal induced by 1-min isoproterenol stimulation (Fig. 1, A and B). Surprisingly, elimination of such a signal required replacement of all 31 lysine residues of β-arrestin2 (mutant β-arrestin20K Fig. 1B). When a FLAG epitope-tagged β-arrestin20K is overexpressed in HEK-293 cells, no ubiquitination smear is detected upon isoproterenol stimulation (Fig. 1C). Although these experiments indicate that β-arrestin20K can be expressed as a properly folded protein that is isolated and detected by the epitope tag, a concern still remains whether β-arrestin20K, despite its 31 lysine to arginine changes, is a bona fide form of β-arrestin.To test whether the basic folding and binding properties of β-arrestin20K are retained, we compared the binding of in vitro translated β-arrestin2 and β-arrestin20K to purified recombinant β2AR reconstituted in vesicles. We also tested β-arrestin2-Ub for receptor binding under the same conditions. In these in vitro assays, both WT and β-arrestin20K represent nonubiquitinated forms, and only the β-arrestin2-Ub chimera constitutes the ubiquitinated form. As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, β-arrestin20K bound to the β2AR to the same extent as β-arrestin2. However, the presence of a single ubiquitin moiety increased the binding by 4-fold (Fig. 2, A and B). These experiments suggest that although both nonubiquitinated forms of β-arrestin2 (i.e. WT and 0K) are equipotent for β2AR binding, there is more binding between the β2AR and the ubiquitinated form (i.e. β-arrestin2-Ub). When binding was performed in the presence of isoproterenol, a small increase was observed for all three β-arrestin forms (data not shown). We hypothesized that reconstituted β2AR was already in an activated conformation due to the presence of zinterol in purification buffers. If so, inclusion of an antagonist could alter the observed binding. When β-arrestin-receptor complex formation was tested in the presence of propranolol, we found a dramatic decrease in binding for all three β-arrestin forms (Fig. 2, A and B), suggesting that propranolol destabilizes but does not eliminate receptor-β-arrestin binding in these experiments. Moreover, when reconstituted receptor samples were probed with a β2AR-specific phosphoserine antibody (serines 355 and 356), a small amount of phosphorylation was detected (Fig. 2C, top). The addition of GRK2 leads to an increase in the phosphorylation signal, and isoproterenol augments it further (Fig. 2C). We observed a comparable increase in binding above basal conditions for all three β-arrestin forms upon GRK2 phosphorylation and isoproterenol treatment of the reconstituted β2AR (Fig. 2D). Collectively, these in vitro binding assays confirm that, although ubiquitinated β-arrestin2 forms a tight complex with the β2AR, nonubiquitinated β-arrestin2 can bind reconstituted β2AR and that the protein-protein interaction domain(s) between the receptor and β-arrestin20K is mostly unperturbed.FIGURE 2Binding of in vitro translated β-arrestins to recombinant β2ARs reconstituted in phospholipid vesicles. A, as described under “Experimental Procedures,” in vitro translated, 35S-labeled β-arrestin2, β-arrestin20K, or β-arrestin2-Ub was incubated with either empty phospholipid vesicles or vesicles containing β2AR. The vesicles were then precipitated by repeated centrifugation and wash cycles. The final pellet was solubilized and separated on SDS gels, and the bound β-arrestins were detected by autoradiography. In the indicated lanes, propranolol (50 μm) was included in the reaction mixture. B, results from three separate binding experiments were quantified and shown as bar graphs. **, p < 0.001, β-arrestin2 or β-arrestin20K versus β-arrestin2-Ub, one-way analysis of variance, and Tukey's multiple comparison test; β-arrestin2 versus β-arrestin20K, no significant difference. C, reconstituted β2AR samples were probed with a phosphoserine antibody (serines 355 and 356 within the β2AR carboxyl tail) in the upper panel and with a β2AR antibody (H-20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) in the lower panel. D, receptor-β-arrestin binding was tested as in A. GRK2 alone or GRK2 and isoproterenol (ISO;50 μm) were added to the reaction as indicated. The bar graph is a summarization of two independent experiments performed in duplicate. For each β-arrestin form, basal binding in the absence of GRK2 and isoproterenol was assigned as 1. IB, immunoblot; EV, empty vesicles.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine the isoproterenol-stimulated binding of β-arrestin20K to the β2AR in a cellular context, we employed immunoprecipitation assays utilizing chemical cross-linking with a sufhydryl-reactive compound, DTME (Fig. 3). We used COS-7 cells transiently transfected with FLAG-β2AR and β-arrestin20K-GFP, immunoprecipitated the receptors under nonstimulated or stimulated conditions (5 min, 1 μm isoproterenol), and detected β-arrestin20K-GFP by Western blotting (Fig. 3A). β-Arrestin20K-GFP binds to activated receptors with a 2-3-fold agonist-induced recruitment (Fig. 3B). In similar assays, the WT and β-arrestin2-Ub were recruited 10-12- and 12-15-fold, respectively (data not shown). These experiments further suggest that β-arrestin20K-GFP, albeit much weaker than the WT, nevertheless binds the β2AR upon agonist stimulation. Probably, the robust association of β-arrestin20K and the β2AR does not occur in cells due to a lack of β-arrestin2 ubiquitination, which helps to stabilize the complex.FIGURE 3β-arrestin20K binding to receptors demonstrated by chemical cross-linking. A, COS-7 cells transiently transfected with FLAG-β2AR with pEGFP vector or β-arrestin20K-GFP were stimulated with 10 μm isoproterenol (iso) for 5 min, and FLAG receptors were immunoprecipitated after chemical cross-linking with DTME.

https://openalex.org/W2125478478,"Gaucher disease is caused by mutations in the gene encoding acid β-glucosidase (GlcCerase), resulting in glucosylceramide (GlcCer) accumulation. The only currently available orally administered treatment for Gaucher disease is N-butyl-deoxynojirimycin (Zavesca™, NB-DNJ), which partially inhibits GlcCer synthesis, thus reducing levels of GlcCer accumulation. NB-DNJ also acts as a chemical chaperone for GlcCerase, although at a different concentration than that required to completely inhibit GlcCer synthesis. We now report the crystal structures, at 2A resolution, of complexes of NB-DNJ and N-nonyl-deoxynojirimycin (NN-DNJ) with recombinant human GlcCerase, expressed in cultured plant cells. Both inhibitors bind at the active site of GlcCerase, with the imino sugar moiety making hydrogen bonds to side chains of active site residues. The alkyl chains of NB-DNJ and NN-DNJ are oriented toward the entrance of the active site where they undergo hydrophobic interactions. Based on these structures, we make a number of predictions concerning (i) involvement of loops adjacent to the active site in the catalytic process, (ii) the nature of nucleophilic attack by Glu-340, and (iii) the role of a conserved water molecule located in a solvent cavity adjacent to the active site. Together, these results have significance for understanding the mechanism of action of GlcCerase and the mode of GlcCerase chaperoning by imino sugars."

Although previous studies of the genetics of SCCD have localized the defective gene to a 1.58 Mbp interval on chromosome 1p, exhaustive sequencing of positional candidate genes has thus far failed to reveal causal mutations. We have ascertained a large multigenerational family in Nova Scotia affected with SCCD in which we have confirmed linkage to the same general area of chromosome 1. Intensive fine mapping in our family revealed a 1.3 Mbp candidate interval overlapping that previously reported. Sequencing of genes in our interval led to the identification of five putative causal mutations in gene UBIAD1, in our family as well as in four other small families of various geographic origins. UBIAD1 encodes a potential prenyltransferase, and is reported to interact physically with apolipoprotein E. UBIAD1 may play a direct role in intracellular cholesterol biochemistry, or may prenylate other proteins regulating cholesterol transport and storage."

Because the free iron concentration in the human body is too low to support growth, S. aureus must acquire iron from host sources. Heme iron is the most prevalent iron reservoir in the human body and a predominant source of iron for S. aureus. The iron-regulated surface determinant (Isd) system removes heme from host heme proteins and transfers it to IsdE, the cognate substrate-binding lipoprotein of an ATP-binding cassette transporter, for import and subsequent degradation. Herein, we report the crystal structure of the soluble portion of the IsdE lipoprotein in complex with heme. The structure reveals a bi-lobed topology formed by an N- and C-terminal domain bridged by a single α-helix. The structure places IsdE as a member of the helical backbone metal receptor superfamily. A six-coordinate heme molecule is bound in the groove established at the domain interface, and the heme iron is coordinated in a novel fashion for heme transporters by Met78 and His229. Both heme propionate groups are secured by H-bonds to IsdE main chain and side chain groups. Of these residues, His229 is essential for IsdE-mediated heme uptake by S. aureus when growth on heme as a sole iron source is measured.

Staphylococcus aureus is a leading cause of hospital acquired bacterial infections (1Weems J.J. Postgrad. Med. J. 2001; 110: 24-26Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). It is rapidly being recognized as an emerging pathogen because of relentless increases in drug resistance (2Tenover F.C. Pearson M.L. Emerg. Infect. Dis. 2004; 10: 2052-2053Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The establishment of two strains is problematic in the clinic, methicillin-resistant S. aureus and vancomycin-resistant S. aureus. Methicillin resistant S. aureus strains are increasing in prevalence both in hospitals and, more recently, within the community (3Deurenberg R.H. Vink C. Kalenic S. Friedrich A.W. Bruggeman C.A.

Microbiol. 2004; 58: 611-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). In aerobic environments, free iron concentrations are generally low. For human pathogens, iron concentrations are further limited by host storage, transport, and innate immune mechanisms (6Radtke A.L. O'Riordan M.X. Cell.

In contrast, uptake systems in Gram-positive bacteria are not as well understood.

More recently, a transposon mutant that preferentially acquired iron from transferrin versus heme implicated the heme transport system (Hts) in heme uptake as well (12Skaar E.P. Humayun M. Bae T.

The Isd system in S. aureus consists of nine members. IsdA, IsdB, IsdC, and IsdH/HarA are cell wall anchored surface proteins (13Mazmanian S.K. Skaar E.P. Gaspar A.H. Humayun M. Gornicki P.

Recently, for IsdA and IsdC, the heme binding properties and crystal structures of the NEAT domains in complex with heme were determined, demonstrating similar mechanisms of heme coordination (18Grigg J.C.

Schneewind O. Microbes. Infect. 2004; 6: 390-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) proposed a model for Isd heme transport. In this model, heme is removed from host heme proteins bound by IsdB and IsdH at the cell surface, transferred to IsdA and subsequently to IsdC. From there, heme moves to the ABC transporter-binding protein, IsdE (a lipoprotein), and subsequently through the transporter (13Mazmanian S.K. Skaar E.P. Gaspar A.H. Humayun M. Gornicki P.

In this study, we show that inactivation of S. aureus isdE impairs growth on heme as a sole source of iron. To gain insight into the function of IsdE in heme binding and transport, the crystal structure of the IsdE-heme complex was determined. The structure reveals His-Met heme iron coordination that is unique to heme transport proteins. Corroborating the structure, alanine substitutions in binding pocket residues showed that mutation of Met78 and His229 resulted in significant loss of heme binding and that IsdE H229A was incapable of supporting IsdE-mediated growth on heme as a sole source of iron in growth promotion assays. This work adds substantial mechanistic detail to the complex model of heme uptake by S. aureus and provides a framework for future studies into the mechanism of bacterial binding protein-dependent heme acquisition. Cloning and Protein Expression for Structure Determination—The IsdE coding region (Gly32-Lys289), excluding the signal sequence and 11 N-terminal amino acids following the Cys lipidation site, and three C-terminal amino acids were amplified from S. aureus N315 chromosomal DNA and cloned into the expression vector, pET-28a(+) (Novagen). This construct was designed to optimize crystallization based on an analysis using the DISOPRED2 disorder prediction server (25Ward J.J. Sodhi J.S. McGuffin L.J. Buxton B.F. Jones D.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 337: 635-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (1613) Google Scholar). Recombinant protein was expressed with an N-terminal His6 tag in Escherichia coli BL21. Cultures containing the expression vector were grown at 30 °C to an optical density at 600 nm of ∼0.8 followed by induction with 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and growth overnight at 25 °C. Cells were resuspended in 20 mm Tris (pH 8), 200 mm NaCl and lysed at 4 °C using an Emulsi Flex-C5 homogenizer (Avestin). His6-IsdE was purified using a Ni-Sepharose high performance column (GE Healthcare) and dialyzed against 50 mm Tris (pH 8), 100 mm NaCl prior to thrombin digestion to remove the His6 purification tag. Cleaved protein was dialyzed into 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) for Source S column (GE Healthcare) purification followed by dialysis into 20 mm Tris (pH 8) and reconstitution with hemin as described previously (26Chan A.C.

Selenomethionine-labeled IsdE was produced as described previously (27Van Duyne G.D. Standaert R.F. Karplus P.A. Schreiber S.L. Clardy J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 105-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar) and purified similarly to native IsdE. Cloning and Protein Expression for Spectroscopy—The majority of the isdE gene, corresponding to amino acids 21-292 (excluding the signal sequence), was cloned into the GST fusion vector pGEX-2T-TEV (28Sebulsky M.T. Shilton B.H. Speziali C.D. Heinrichs D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49890-49900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) to generate pGST-IsdE. Overexpression of GST-tagged IsdE in E. coli ER2566 (protease-deficient) was achieved by growing plasmid-containing cultures in Luria-Bertani broth (Difco), containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin, at 37 °C to an A600 of ∼0.8. Isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (0.4 mm) was added, and cultures were grown for a further 20 h at room temperature. Bacterial cells were pelleted, resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in a French pressure cell. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 20 min. GST-IsdE fusions were purified by passage of cell lysates across a 20-ml GSTPrep column (GE Healthcare). GST-IsdE was eluted from the column with 10 mm reduced glutathione, 100 mm NaCl, and 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 9.0. UV/Visible Absorption Spectroscopy—All proteins (wild type and mutant) were purified as expressed from E. coli, and relative heme binding was assessed based on the ability of the proteins, all expressed in identical fashion, to scavenge and retain association with heme derived from the cytoplasm. Proteins were adjusted to an equivalent concentration, and electronic spectra were recorded using a Cary 500 spectrophotometer (Varian) with a 1-cm path length and 1-ml quartz cuvettes. All recordings were taken at room temperature. IsdE Structure Determination—Heme-bound IsdE crystals were grown by hanging drop vapor diffusion at room temperature. The well solution contained 50 mm MES (pH 5.5), 0.2 m ammonium acetate, and 28% polyethylene glycol 4000. Drops were made from 1 μl of 30 mg/ml protein solution and 1-μl well solution. Crystals were briefly immersed in well solution supplemented to 16% glycerol prior to immersion in liquid nitrogen. X-ray diffraction data were collected at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory at 100 K on beam lines 11-1 and 9-2 for the selenomethionine and native crystals, respectively. Single wavelength anomalous diffraction data were collected at a wavelength of 0.978894 Å. Native crystal data were collected at a wavelength of 1.0 Å. Data were processed using HKL2000 (29Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38570) Google Scholar). Crystals grew in the space group P43212 with one IsdE molecule in the asymmetric unit. The programs Solve (30Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

The phase solution had an initial figure of merit of 0.37 that was improved to 0.62 by density modification. The structure was manually constructed using Coot (33Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr.

The refined structure contains residues Gly32-Lys289 and 246 water molecules. The Ramachandran plot reveals 92% of residues are in the most favored conformation, and none are in the disallowed regions. Data collection and refinement statistics are shown in Table 1.

Open table in a new tab Construction of S. aureus isdE::Km—Allelic replacement, using methodologies described previously (38Speziali C.D. Dale S.E. Henderson J.A. Vines E.D. Heinrichs D.E. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 2048-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), was used to generate a non-polar insertion mutation in the chromosomal copy of isdE; the kanamycin cassette, from plasmid pDG782 (39Guerout-Fleury A.M. Shazand K. Frandsen N. Stragier P. Gene. 1995; 167: 335-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar), was inserted into a unique EcoRI site present within the isdE coding region. The Newman isdE mutant was named strain H834. To complement the chromosomal isdE mutation, a DNA fragment containing isdE was PCR-amplified from the S. aureus Newman chromosome and cloned into pAW8 to generate pCLVEc. Plasmid pCLVEc was introduced into H834, via RN4220, by standard methodologies. Site-directed Mutagenesis of isdE—Site-directed mutagenesis was used to alter residues in the IsdE-heme binding pocket. Specifically, site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange ® PCR kit (Invitrogen), with Pfu Turbo ® polymerase and pGST-IsdE or pCLVEc as a template. The PCR products were incubated with DpnI (Roche) for 45 min to degrade template DNA and transformed into E. coli ER2566. Mutations were confirmed by sequencing. Constructs generated using pCLVEc as the template were introduced, via electroporation, into S. aureus RN4220 (40Kreiswirth B.N. Lofdahl S. Betley M.J. O'Reilly M. Schlievert P.M. Bergdoll M.S. Novick R.P. Nature. 1983; 305: 709-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar) and subsequently transduced to H834 (isdE-) using phage 80α. The constructs were isolated from H834 and sequenced to ensure that mutations had not been introduced during the transformation and transduction procedures. Heme-dependent Bacterial Growth Promotion Studies—S. aureus strains were pre-grown, from single colony, overnight in tris-minimal succinate growth media (41Sebulsky M.T. Speziali C.D. Shilton B.H. Edgell D.R. Heinrichs D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53152-53159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The cells were washed with saline, and 107 CFU of each strain were inoculated into tris-minimal succinate containing 5 μm ethylenediamine-di-(o-hydroxyphenyl)acetic acid with or without, either 50 μm FeCl3 or 5 μm hemin. Cultures (300 μl) were incubated at 37 °C with continuous shaking, and bacterial growth was monitored every 30 min over 20 h using a Bioscreen C (MTX Lab Systems, Inc.). Growth curves were plotted using Sigma Plot 2000. Overall Protein Structure—The selenomethionine and native IsdE structures were solved to 1.95 and 2.15 Å resolution, respectively. The structures reveal a protein with bi-lobed conformation with two domains, each composed of a central-most parallel β-sheet surrounded by α-helices (Fig. 1A). The N-terminal domain (Gly32-Arg138) β-sheet contains only two β-strands, whereas the C-terminal domain (Asn163-Lys289) contains a 5-stranded β-sheet. The two domains are connected by a single long α-helix (Lys139-Lys162) that spans the length of the molecule. A large interface is formed between the two domains and is contributed to by a mix of small hydrophobic and several hydrophilic residues. Although a Dali search (42Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3563) Google Scholar) did not reveal any structurally similar heme-binding proteins, it did identify that the IsdE structure was distantly related to BtuF, a cobalamin transporter, and to the siderophore transporters CeuE and FhuD. For each structure, similarity is characterized by a Z-value >20, a root mean square deviation of 2.8-3.3 Å for 234-244 Cα atoms and a sequence alignment identity <18%. These proteins are all members of the helical backbone metal receptor superfamily. Heme Binding—Previous studies demonstrated that IsdE is a heme-binding protein (13Mazmanian S.K. Skaar E.P. Gaspar A.H. Humayun M. Gornicki P. Jelenska J. Joachmiak A. Missiakas D.M. Schneewind O. Science. 2003; 299: 906-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar, 19Mack J. Vermeiren C. Heinrichs D.E. Stillman M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 320: 781-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We demonstrate that a single heme molecule is bound to IsdE along the groove formed between the two lobes (Fig. 1, A and B). Heme is oriented within the pocket at approximately a 45° angle in relation to the longest axis of the protein such that the propionates interact primarily with the N-terminal domain. Approximately 160 Å2 (19%) of the total heme surface area is solvent exposed (as determined with AREAIMOL (37CCP4Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19765) Google Scholar)). Several hydrophobic residues line the interior of the pocket and interact with the largely hydrophobic porphyrin ring. The N-terminal domain contributes Pro77, Val96, and Ile99 to this hydrophobic environment, and the C-terminal domain contributes Val175, Pro176, Leu180, Tyr208, and Ile270 (Fig. 2C). IsdE-bound heme iron is six-coordinate with axial coordination by the thioether of Met78 (2.28 Å) from the N-terminal domain and the imidazolate of His229 (2.00 Å) from the C-terminal domain (Figs. 1A and 2A). The angles formed between the tetrapyrrole nitrogen plane and the axial ligands are both ∼90°. The tetrapyrrole ring is close to planar, and the iron is displaced from the plane formed by the tetrapyrrole nitrogens by less than 0.04 Å (Fig. 2A). His229 participates in a complex H-bond network that includes Glu265 from the C-terminal domain and residues Tyr61 and Lys62 from the N-terminal domain (Fig. 2B). His229 Nδ1 forms an H-bond with HOH15 (2.9 Å), which, in turn, forms an H-bond to Glu265 Oϵ2 (2.9 Å). Glu265 also forms H-bonds directly to Lys62 Nζ (3.4 Å) and Tyr61 O H (2.7 Å) through carboxylate atoms Oϵ2 and Oϵ1, respectively. The heme propionates are oriented approximately parallel to the binding groove and are essentially buried (Fig. 2D). They are well ordered in the electron density map and form extensive interactions with IsdE (Fig. 2B). Lys62 Nζ forms a H-bond to HOH13 (2.9 Å) that, in turn, forms H-bonds with both heme propionates (2.6 and 2.9 Å). One of the heme propionates forms additional direct H-bonds with the main chain amides of Val41 (2.7 Å) and Ala42 (3.0 Å). Val41 and Ala42 are located at the N terminus of α-helix 1 that is oriented such that the positive helix dipole is directed toward the propionate carboxylate group (Fig. 1A). An additional HOH16 bridged (2.9 Å) interaction is formed with Thr40 OH (2.8 Å) and Thr271 OH (3.1 Å). The other propionate forms direct H-bonds to Ser60 Oγ (2.7 Å) and the main chain amide of Tyr61 (3.2 Å) (Fig. 2B). Multiple Sequence Alignments—A sequence search using BLAST (43Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70693) Google Scholar) revealed several homologous proteins (E-value < 4 × 10-37) in other Gram-positive organisms, namely species of Bacillus, Listeria, Clostridia, Streptococcus, and Lactobacillus. Previously, the IsdE homologues from Listeria monocytogenes, Clostridium tetani, and Bacillus anthracis are shown to be associated with related Isd uptake systems (22Skaar E.P. Schneewind O. Microbes. Infect. 2004; 6: 390-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The sequences were aligned with ClustalX (44Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35485) Google Scholar), and the alignments were manually edited in BioEdit (45Hall T. Nucleic Acids Symp. Ser. 1999; 41: 95-98Google Scholar). Each sequence shares greater than 28% identity over the 292 residues of S. aureus IsdE (Fig. 3 and supplemental Fig. S2). In the identified sequences, the predicted secretion signal and ∼15 N-terminal residues after the Cys lipidation site are poorly conserved. The alignments reveal several conserved residues within the heme pocket of the IsdE structure. Both of the iron axial ligands (i.e. Met78 and His229) are completely conserved in the homologous sequences (Fig. 3). Residues forming the H-bonding network with His229 are also generally conserved. Lys62 is conserved in the bacilli and listerial proteins, but it is replaced by Tyr in the streptococcal and clostridial species. Glu265 is generally conserved or replaced by Asn. Residues interacting with the propionates are also conserved as are the hydrophobic heme pocket residues; where different, they are substituted for residues with similar hydrophobic properties (Fig. 3). The alignments reveal a conserved patch of residues located at the surface of the N- and C-terminal lobes traversing the heme pocket (Fig. 2D). Several conserved, charged residues are evident within this conserved patch. Notably, Glu83 and Glu214 are completely conserved, whereas Glu242 differs only in the Clostridium perfringens sequence (Fig. 3). Lys237 and Lys241 are also conserved as large charged residues at the lobe surface in all aligned sequences (Fig. 3). Another striking feature revealed by mapping of amino acid conservation onto the structure is the maintenance of nine Pro residues between residues 32-105 in the N-terminal lobe of the homologues (supplemental Fig. S3). Pro77 occurs in the heme iron coordinating Met78 loop, where it forces a tight turn necessary for orienting Met78 correctly in the heme binding pocket. However, Pro38, Pro58, Pro65, and Pro80 are present within loops traversing the N-terminal domain and are generally conserved. Contribution of Residues to Heme Binding and IsdE-mediated Heme Transport in Vivo—As shown in Fig. 4A, spectroscopic analysis of GST-IsdE shows strong absorption in the Soret region as well as signals in the visible region around 650 nm; these signals are characteristic of heme binding. As expected, GST alone showed none of these signals. To validate the crystal structure of the IsdE-heme complex, Ala point mutations were constructed in several of the conserved heme binding pocket residues of IsdE. Mutation of the conserved heme iron-coordinating His229 and Met78, individually, resulted in a significant reduction in heme binding by IsdE. Moreover, mutation of both His229 and Met78 to Ala in the same protein completely abolished IsdE heme binding activity (Fig. 4A). Notably, we also observed altered IsdE heme binding properties upon mutation of other residues whose side chains coordinated directly or indirectly (via waters) to the heme structure (supplemental Fig. S4). We and others have shown previously that S. aureus is capable of growing on hemin as a sole source of iron (12Skaar E.P. Humayun M. Bae T. DeBord K.L. Schneewind O.

https://openalex.org/W2053327244,"Despite decades of research into the aetiology and pathophysiology of schizophrenia, our understanding of this devastating disorder remains incomplete, with adverse consequences for both diagnosis and treatment. Here we investigate whether differences between patients and controls can be observed in peripheral patient tissue, with a view of establishing a means for dynamic investigations into cell function. In vitro stimulation of peripheral blood CD3+ pan T cells with anti-CD3 (clone OKT3) was used to investigate disease-associated cell responses. T cells from both medicated (n = 39), unmedicated (n = 6) and minimally medicated (n = 5) schizophrenia patients were found to have significantly lower proliferative responses to stimulation, compared to well-matched controls (n = 32). Expression of CD3 and TCR (T cell receptor) alphabeta chains was equivalent between patients and controls, ensuring equal stimulation with anti-CD3, and there was no significant difference in the proportions of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells between samples (n = 12). Lower T cell proliferation in schizophrenia patients was not found to result from deficient early tyrosine phosphorylation signalling or lower IL-2 (interleukin-2) production, as these parameters were similar between patients and controls, as was the expression of CD25, the IL-2 receptor alpha chain. Analysis of CD45 isoforms, however, revealed that patients had a significantly greater percentage of CD8+ and CD4+ CD45RA+ cells before stimulation and significantly higher fluorescence intensity of CD45RA on CD4+ and CD8+ cells before and after stimulation. There was significantly higher expression of CD45 RB on both CD4+ and CD8+ unstimulated cells, with a trend towards lower numbers of CD45RO+ T cells in patient blood. Gene expression analysis in freshly isolated T cells from six minimally treated or first onset patients and six controls was carried out using human whole-genome CodeLink microarrays to identify functional pathways that may affect the ability of patient cells to respond to stimulation. Functional profiling showed prominent transcript changes in categories pertaining to cell cycle machinery, intracellular signalling, oxidative stress and metabolism. Intriguingly, chromosomal location analysis of genes significantly altered between schizophrenia and controls revealed clusters at 1p36, 1q42 and 6p22, which have previously been identified as strong susceptibility loci for schizophrenia."

https://openalex.org/W2023850736,"Nerve growth factor (NGF) is a well characterized neurotrophic agonist in the nervous system that triggers angiogenesis. In this study, we investigated the signaling mechanisms involved in NGF-induced angiogenesis. NGF stimulated endothelial cell invasion and cord formation on Matrigel in vitro but had marginal effect on proliferation and migration of these cells. NGF stimulated matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 mRNA expression and protein secretion in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Using synthetic and endogenous inhibitors of MMP-2 and MMP-2 small interfering RNA suppressed NGF-induced invasion and cord formation. We demonstrated that NGF-induced MMP-2 secretion, invasion, and cord formation are regulated via activation of the NGF receptor, TrkA, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), and Akt using various pharmacological inhibitors. Specifically, NGF enhanced TrkA phosphorylation, PI3K activity, and Akt phosphorylation. Introduction of NGF-neutralizing antibodies, dominant-negative Akt, or wild-type PTEN effectively inhibited NGF-induced MMP-2 secretion and cord formation. Deletion and site-directed mutagenesis analysis of the MMP-2 promoter demonstrated that the AP-2-binding site is critical for NGF-induced MMP-2 promoter activity. NGF increased the DNA binding activity of AP-2, which was suppressed by inhibitors of TrkA and PI3K. Furthermore, transfection of AP-2 small interfering RNA effectively blocked NGF-induced MMP-2 secretion and cord formation. Finally, NGF promoted neovessel formation in Matrigel plugs in vivo, which was significantly inhibited by K252a and LY294002, but it failed to promote angiogenesis using MMP-2 knock-out mice. Our data collectively suggest that NGF stimulates endothelial cell invasion and cord formation by augmenting MMP-2 via the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and AP-2 transcription factor, which may be responsible for triggering angiogenesis.

Angiogenesis, the process by which new vascular networks are formed from pre-existing capillaries, is essential in a variety of physiological and pathological conditions, including wound healing, embryonic development, chronic inflammation, cancer, and metastasis (1Folkman J. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (7235) Google Scholar). The process includes complex sequential steps that include endothelial cell proliferation and migration, extracellular matrix remodeling by proteases, and maturation of newly formed vessels (2Risau W. Nature. 1997; 386: 671-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (4867) Google Scholar). Angiogenesis is triggered by interactions of angiogenic soluble factors and their cognate receptors involved in the different phases of the process (3Yancopoulos G.D. Klagsbrun M. Folkman J. Cell. 1998; 93: 661-664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar).

Diabetologia. 2004; 47: 1047-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). NGF is the prototypic member of the family of neurotrophic factors that includes brain-derived neurotrophic factor, NT3 and NT4/5 (7Hohn A. Leibrock J. Bailey K. Barde Y.A. Nature. 1990; 344: 339-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar). NGF exerts a variety of actions on the central nervous system, including regulation of proliferation, differentiation, neurite outgrowth, neurotransmission, plasticity, repair, and survival (8Huang E.J. Reichardt L.F. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 677-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (3398) Google Scholar). Two types of membrane receptors mediate NGF signaling: the Trk family tyrosine kinase receptor, TrkA, which shows a high affinity for NGF, and p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NR), which exhibits low affinity for NGF (9Huang E.J. Reichardt L.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 609-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (1982) Google Scholar). These receptors are additionally expressed on the surface of endothelial cells (10Cantarella G.

Sci. 2001; 2: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In addition to its direct angiogenic activity, NGF functions as an indirect activator of angiogenesis by inducing specific molecules, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (4Calza L. Giardino L. Giuliani A. Aloe L. Levi-Montalcini R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4160-4165Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The cellular effects of NGF are mediated mainly by the high affinity receptor, TrkA (9Huang E.J. Reichardt L.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 609-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (1982) Google Scholar, 15Jing S. Tapley P. Barbacid M. Neuron. 1992; 9: 1067-1079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Upon NGF binding, TrkA dimerizes and autophosphorylates multiple tyrosines within its cytoplasmic domain (15Jing S. Tapley P. Barbacid M. Neuron. 1992; 9: 1067-1079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Signaling molecules containing Src homology 2 or phosphotyrosine-binding domains, such as phospholipase Cγ and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), are essential for NGF signals (15Jing S. Tapley P. Barbacid M. Neuron. 1992; 9: 1067-1079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Ras-dependent PI3K is essential for NGF-specific protection of neuronal cells from apoptosis (16Vaillant A.R. Mazzoni I. Tudan C. Boudreau M. Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 955-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) and neuronal differentiation (17Nusser N. Gosmanova E. Zheng Y. Tigyi G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35840-35846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Moreover, the Rasmediated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 pathway appears critical for NGF-induced neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells (18Schonhoff C.M. Bulseco D.A. Brancho D.M. Parada L.F. Ross A.H. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 631-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). NGF also transmits its signal to endothelial cells through the TrkA receptor. Stimulation of TrkA activity by NGF leads to activation of ERK1/2, PI3K, and Akt in endothelial cells, which is possibly responsible for their proliferation and migration in vitro (10Cantarella G. Lempereur L. Presta M. Ribatti D. Lombardo G. Lazarovici P. Zappala G. Pafumi C. Bernardini R. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1307-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 11Rahbek U.L. Dissing S. Thomassen C. Hansen A.J. Tritsaris K. Pfluegers Arch. 2005; 450: 355-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, the precise regulatory mechanisms responsible for NGF-induced angiogenesis remain to be clarified. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms of NGF action on angiogenesis, both in vitro and in vivo. Our data show that NGF significantly stimulates endothelial cell invasion and cord formation by inducing matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, and that TrkA-mediated activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway and AP-2 transcription factor are critically involved in these events. Reagents—Human recombinant NGF was purchased from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN), and human recombinant tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-2 was from Angio-Lab (Deajeon, Korea). Growth factor-reduced Matrigel was from BD Biosciences, and gelatin and collagen were from Sigma. Antibodies against MMP-2, MMP-9, membrane type 1-MMP (MT1-MMP), TIMP-1, and TIMP-2 were from Calbiochem, and the antibody against the p85 subunit of PI3K was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Antibodies Akt and phospho-Akt were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA), and those against TrkA, AP-2α, AP-2β, AP-2γ, and phosphotyrosine were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Specific inhibitors of TrkA (K252a), PI3K (LY294002), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family (PD98059, SB202190, and SP600125, ERK1/2, p38, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), respectively), Akt (Akt inhibitor IV), and MMP-2 (OA-Hy; cis-9-octadecenoyl-N-hydroxylamide) were purchased from Calbiochem. Cell Culture—Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs, obtained from American Type Culture Collection) were cultured in gelatin-coated plates with M199 medium containing 20% FBS, sodium heparin (100 units/ml, Sigma), endothelial cell growth supplement (50 μg/ml, Sigma), and antibiotics and incubated at 37 °C in 10% CO2 in air. Human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMECs, purchased from Clonetics, Walkersville, MD) were cultured in gelatin-coated plates with EBM-2 medium (Clonetics) containing 5% FBS and antibiotics and incubated at 37 °C in 10% CO2 in air. Endothelial Cell Proliferation Assay—HUVECs and HDMECs growing in gelatin-coated plates were dispersed in 0.05% trypsin solution and resuspended with M199 containing 20% FBS and EBM-2 containing 5% FBS medium without growth factors, respectively. Approximately 3,000 cells were added to each well of gelatinized 96-well plates and incubated at 37 °C under 10% CO2 for 24 h. The medium was replaced with 100 μg of fresh M199 or EBM-2 medium containing 2% FBS with or without NGF at the indicated concentrations and VEGF (10 ng/ml). After 2 days of incubation, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and the DNA amount was measured with CyQUANT GR reagent, according to the manufacturer's protocol (CyQUANT® cell proliferation assay kit, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), using a fluorescence spectrometer equipped with a microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Endothelial Cell Invasion and Migration Assays—Matrigel invasion assays were performed using modified Boyden chambers with polycarbonate nucleopore membrane (Costar, Corning, NY). Precoated filters (6.5 mm in diameter, 8 μm pore size, Matrigel (100 μg/cm2)) were rehydrated with 100 μl of medium. Next, 2 × 105 cells in 100 μl of serum-free M199 (for HUVECs) or EBM-2 (for HDMECs) supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin were seeded into the upper part of each chamber, whereas the lower compartments were filled with 1 ml of the above medium in the presence or absence of NGF at the indicated concentrations with or without molecular specific inhibitors or TIMP-2. Following incubation for 18 h at 37 °C, noninvading cells on the upper surface of the filter were wiped out with a cotton swab, and the invading cells on the lower surface of the filter were fixed and stained with the Diff-Quick kit (Fisher). Invasiveness was determined by counting cells in five microscopic fields per well, and the extent of invasion was expressed as an average number of cells per microscopic field. Transwell migration assays were performed using a similar procedure as that for the invasion assay, except that the underside of filters was coated with type I collagen (100 μg/cm2) without coating the upper side. Endothelial Cell Cord Formation Assay—For the endothelial cell cord formation assay, 250 μl of growth factor-reduced Matrigel was pipetted into a well of a 48-well plate and polymerized for 30 min at 37 °C. HUVECs and HDMECs incubated in 1% FBS-containing M199 and EGM-2 for 12 h, respectively, were trypsinized, resuspended in the same medium, and dispersed onto the Matrigel (1 × 105 cells/well). Cells were treated with NGF at the indicated concentration and VEGF (10 ng/ml) with or without specific kinase inhibitors and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). After 18 h, cord formation in each well was monitored and photographed using an inverted microscope. The tubular lengths of the cells were measured using Image-Pro Plus (Media Cybermetics, Silver Spring, MD). Gelatin Zymography—Production of MMPs by HUVECs was analyzed by gelatin zymography. HUVECs in subconfluent culture conditions (about 70–80% confluence) were washed, replenished with serum-free M199 medium, and incubated with the indicated concentrations of NGF in the presence or absence of various kinase inhibitors for 18 h. Serum-free conditioned media (20 μl) were mixed with SDS sample buffer without heating or reduction and applied to 10% polyacrylamide gels co-polymerized with 1 mg/ml gelatin. After electrophoresis, gels were washed in 2.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 2 h at room temperature to remove SDS, rinsed twice with water, and incubated in developing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm CaCl2, 1 μm ZnCl2, and 0.1 μm NaN3) for 18 h at 37 °C. Subsequently, gels were fixed and stained with 10% 2-propanol and 10% acetic acid containing 0.5% Coomassie Blue R-250. Protease activity was visualized as clear bands within the stained gel. Transfection and Transduction—Dominant-negative (DN) Akt and wild-type (WT) Akt plasmids (a generous gift from Dr. Su-Jae Lee, Korea Institute of Radiological and Medical Sciences, Seoul, Korea) were transiently transfected into HUVECs using Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following the supplier's instructions. The AP-2α, AP-2β, AP-2γ, and MMP-2 siRNAs were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Cells were transfected with siRNA molecules using RNAiFect transfection reagent (Qiagen), as described by the manufacturer. For adenoviral transduction, cells were infected with 50 plaque-forming units per cell of control adenoviral (Ad)-LacZ, Ad-WT-PTEN, and Ad-mutant-PTEN (Ad-C124S-PTEN) (19Park M.J. Kim M.S. Park I.C. Kang H.S. Yoo H. Park S.H. Rhee C.H. Hong S.I. Lee S.H. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 6318-6322PubMed Google Scholar) for 90 min at 37 °C. After 48 h, transfected and transduced cells were employed for further experiments. Expression of target genes was confirmed by Western blot analysis using antibodies against target proteins or phosphorylation of downstream effector molecules. Western Blot Analysis—HUVECs were lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After brief sonication, lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and protein content in the supernatant was measured using the Bradford method. An aliquot (30–50 μg of protein per lane) of total protein was separated by 10 or 12% SDS-PAGE and blotted to nitrocellulose transfer membranes (0.2 μm; Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat skimmed milk in TBST (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl, and 0.01% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature, followed by incubation with primary antibodies. After extensive washing with TBST, the membrane was reprobed with horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit or anti-mouse immunoglobulin (1:3,000 diluted) in 5% nonfat skimmed milk in TBST for 40 min at room temperature. Immunoblots were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences), according to the manufacturer's protocol. To measure the MMP-2, MMP-9, TIMP-1, and TIMP-2 proteins secreted, conditioned medium from each sample was subjected to protein analysis. For this purpose, the culture medium in each dish was collected and concentrated 10-fold using a Centricon 10 microconcentrator (Amicon, Beverly, MA). Concentrates (5 μg/sample) were subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis. Immunoprecipitation—HUVECs were serum-starved for 6 h in M199 containing 1% FBS. Cells were stimulated by the addition of NGF (10 ng/ml) in the presence or absence of indicated concentrations of K252a (at concentrations of 50 or 200 nm). Next, cells were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, 137 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10% glycerol, and 1% Triton X-100). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min, and the resulting supernatant fractions (500 μg) were immunoprecipitated with 1 μg of anti-TrkA antibody or anti-p85 subunit of PI3K at 4 °C for 2 h. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer, solubilized in SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol, and analyzed by Western blotting. PI3K Assay—Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an antibody against the p85 subunit of PI3K and conjugated to protein A/G plus-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). In the PI3K assay, immune complexes were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and 1 mm Na3VO4, twice with 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 500 mm LiCl and 1 mm Na3VO4, and twice with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, containing 150 mm NaCl. Kinase reactions were initiated by adding 5 mg/ml l-α-phosphatidylinositol (Sigma) in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm MnCl2, 10 μm ATP, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 2.5 mm EGTA. After 20 min of incubation at room temperature, reactions were quenched by adding 1 m HCl. Phospholipids were extracted with a 1:1 mixture of chloroform and methanol and separated by thin layer chromatography in separating solution ((n-propyl alcohol, 2 m acetic acid, water (42.3:1.2:22.7)). Spots were visualized by autoradiography. Real Time PCR—Real time PCR assays were performed using the QuantiTect SYBER Green PCR kit (Qiagen) with SYBR Green I as the fluorescent dye, enabling real time detection of PCR products, according to the manufacturer's protocol. Genespecific primers were used, and the specificities were tested under normal PCR conditions. The following oligonucleotide sequences were employed: human MMP-2 sense (5′-GAGAACCAAAGTCTGAAGAG-3′) and antisense (5′-GGAGTGAGAATGCTGATTAG-3′), and human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) sense (5′-TGAACGGGAAGCTCACTGG-3′) and antisense (5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3′). Cycling conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 15 min followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. For quantification, the target gene was normalized to the internal standard GAPDH gene. Results of real time PCR data are represented as Ct values, whereby Ct is the threshold cycle at which the amplified product is initially detected. We used the comparative Ct method (20Johnson M.R. Wang K. Smith J.B. Heslin M.J. Diasio R.B. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 278: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) and analyzed RNA expression in samples relative to that of the control in each experiment. Primers were constructed so that the dynamic range of both targets and GAPDH references were similar over a wide range of dilutions (1:1–10,000). PCR was performed in triplicate for each sample. Results are expressed as mean values ± S.D. for the relative levels compared with the control, and minimum values from three independent experiments were obtained. Luciferase Reporter Assays—pGL2 luciferase reporter vectors, containing various MMP-2 promoter regions, were generously provided by Dr. Etty N. Benveniste (21Qin H. Sun Y. Benveniste E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29130-29137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). pRL-CMV vector (Promega, Madison, WI) was used to evaluate transfection efficiency. Cells were seeded in 12-well plates and cultured at 37 °C until they reach 50–60% confluency. Plasmids were then transiently co-transfected into HUVECs by using Effectene. After 24 h, cells were stimulated with or without NGF (10 ng/ml), and cell lysates were prepared at 4 h of incubation using dual luciferase assay kit (Promega). The luminescence was measured by using MicroLumatPlus LB96V microplate luminometer (EG&G Berthold, Wellesley, MA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Electrophoretic Mobility Gel Shift Assay (EMSA)—EMSA was performed as described elsewhere with some modifications. Nuclear extracts were prepared from HUVECs treated with NGF (10 ng/ml) and specific kinase inhibitors or left untreated. Synthetic oligonucleotides consisting of consensus sequences of Sp1 (5′-ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAGC-3′), AP-1 (5′-CGCTTGATGACTCAGCCGGAA-3′), and AP-2 (5′-GATCGAACTGACCGCCCGCGGCCCCT-3′; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were employed as probes after annealing sense and antisense fragments. Double strand oligonucleotides were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP. Nuclear extracts (10 μg) were incubated with 5 × 104 counts/min labeled probes for 30 min at 22 °C and analyzed by 6% PAGE, followed by autoradiography. For competition assays, unlabeled oligonucleotides were added 10 min before including the labeled probes. In Vivo Matrigel Plug Assay—Specific pathogen-free 6-week-old male C57BL/6 mice (Charles River Laboratories, Tokyo, Japan) and MMP-2 knock-out mice (generously provided from Dr. Itohara, see Ref. 22Inoue K. Mikuni-Takagaki Y. Oikawa K. Itoh T. Inada M. Noguchi T. Park J.S. Onodera T. Krane S.M. Noda M. Itohara S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 33814-33824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) were employed for these experiments. For the Matrigel plug assay, mice were injected subcutaneously with 0.5 ml of Matrigel containing heparin (10 units/pellet), NGF (10, 50, or 100 ng/pellet), NGF plus LY294002 (5 or 20 μm), or NGF plus K252a (0.2 or 1 μm). The injected Matrigel rapidly formed a single solid gel plug. After 15 days, mouse skin was easily pulled back to expose the Matrigel plug, which remained intact. To quantify the formation of functional neovessels in Matrigel, the amount of hemoglobin in each plug was assayed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Drabkin reagent kit 525, Sigma). Statistical Analysis—The data are presented as means ± S.E. Statistical comparisons between groups were performed using one-way analysis of variance, followed by the Student's t test. NGF Induces Invasion and Cord Formation in Human Endothelial Cells—To determine the possible mechanisms of direct angiogenic activities of NGF on endothelial cells, we initially examined the effects of the growth factor on the major steps of angiogenesis in vitro, specifically endothelial cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and cord formation. As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, NGF induced proliferation and migration of HUVECs, but not strongly, compared with VEGF. In contrast, NGF significantly stimulated HUVECs invasion through Matrigel (Fig. 1C) and cord formation on Matrigel, an in vitro function that reflects morphogenesis (Fig. 1D). NGF also displayed similar in vitro angiogenic activity in HDMECs (supplemental Fig. 1). The data suggest that NGF-induced in vitro angiogenesis is mainly because of the stimulation of invasion and cord formation of endothelial cells. Because the angiogenic activity of NGF was similar in both endothelial cell types, we used HUVECs to analyze the mechanisms of NGF-induced angiogenesis throughout the study. Augmentation of MMP-2 Is Responsible for NGF-induced Invasion and Cord Formation in HUVECs—A crucial step in the invasion and cord formation of endothelial cells involves the degradation of extracellular matrix (ECM) components, which allows cells to efficiently traverse the basement membranes (23Schnaper H.W. Grant D.S. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Fridman R. D'Orazi G. Murphy A.N. Bird R.E. Hoythya M. Fuerst T.R. Quigley J. French D. Kleinman H.K. J. Cell Physiol. 1993; 156: 235-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we examined the effects of NGF on ECM-degrading protease secretion of HUVECs. Gelatin zymography of serum-free conditioned medium revealed that HUVECs constitutively secrete MMP-2, whereas NGF increased the level of pro- and activated MMP-2 (Fig. 2A). However, MMP-9 secretion was barely detectable and not influenced by NGF (data not shown). Immunoblot analyses confirmed an increase in MMP-2 secretion by NGF (Fig. 2B). In contrast, expression of MT1-MMP, an activator of MMP-2, and secretion of TIMP-1 and TIMP-2, endogenous inhibitors of MMP-9 and MMP-2, respectively, were not significantly affected (Fig. 2B). To determine whether NGF-induced MMP-2 secretion is regulated at the transcription level, we performed real time PCR analysis and found that NGF enhanced MMP-2 mRNA levels in HUVECs in a dose-dependent manner, which peaked at 12 h (Fig. 2C). Next, we examined the involvement of NGF-augmented MMP-2 on invasion and cord formation of HUVECs. Treatment with pharmacological inhibitors of MMP-2 and recombinant TIMP-2 almost completely abrogated NGF-induced invasion (Fig. 2D) and cord formation (Fig. 2E) of HUVECs. To further confirm the involvement of MMP-2 in these events, we transfected MMP-2 siRNA into HUVECs and found that MMP-2 knockdown significantly reduced NGF-induced MMP-2 secretion (Fig. 2F) and cord formation (Fig. 2G). Therefore, our results strongly suggest that NGF up-regulates MMP-2 expression at the transcriptional level, which is critical for invasion and cord formation in HUVECs. TrkA Mediates NGF-induced MMP-2 Secretion, Invasion, and Cord Formation in HUVECs—To explore the possible signaling mechanisms involved in NGF-induced HUVECs invasion and cord formation, we initially examined the role of TrkA, a major receptor for NGF-induced angiogenesis (10Cantarella G. Lempereur L. Presta M. Ribatti D. Lombardo G. Lazarovici P. Zappala G. Pafumi C. Bernardini R. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1307-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3A, NGF rapidly phosphorylated TrkA within 5 min in HUVECs. Preincubation of these cells with the specific TrkA inhibitor, K252a, led to suppression of NGF-induced TrkA phosphorylation (Fig. 3A). In addition, pretreatment with K252a and NGF-neutralizing antibodies resulted in significant abrogation of NGF-induced MMP-2 secretion (Fig. 3B), invasion (Fig. 3C), and cord formation (Fig. 3D) of HUVECs. Therefore, phosphorylation of the TrkA receptor by NGF is critical for angiogenesis"
https://openalex.org/W2076900973,"The non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac is a major cause of the rapid declines in the Indian subcontinent of three species of vultures endemic to South Asia. The drug causes kidney failure and death in vultures. Exposure probably arises through vultures feeding on carcasses of domesticated ungulates treated with the drug. However, before the study reported here, it had not been established from field surveys of ungulate carcasses that a sufficient proportion was contaminated to cause the observed declines. We surveyed diclofenac concentrations in samples of liver from carcasses of domesticated ungulates in India in 2004–2005. We estimated the concentration of diclofenac in tissues available to vultures, relative to that in liver, and the proportion of vultures killed after feeding on a carcass with a known level of contamination. We assessed the impact of this mortality on vulture population trend with a population model. We expected levels of diclofenac found in ungulate carcasses in 2004–2005 to cause oriental white-backed vulture population declines of 80–99% per year, depending upon the assumptions used in the model. This compares with an observed rate of decline, from road transect counts, of 48% per year in 2000–2003. The precision of the estimate based upon carcass surveys is low and the two types of estimate were not significantly different. Our analyses indicate that the level of diclofenac contamination found in carcasses of domesticated ungulates in 2004–2005 was sufficient to account for the observed rapid decline of the oriental white-backed vulture in India. The methods we describe could be used again to assess changes in the effect on vulture population trend of diclofenac and similar drugs. In this way, the effectiveness of the recent ban in India on the manufacture and importation of diclofenac for veterinary use could be monitored."
https://openalex.org/W1977514126,"TRAIL (tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand) is a cytokine that preferentially induces apoptosis in tumor cells compared with normal cells through two receptors (DR4 and DR5). Somatic mutations in these receptors have been found in different kinds of cancer; however, it is poorly understood how the mutations affect signaling. We found that point mutations (L334F, E326K, E338K, and K386N) that were identified in human tumors result in the DR5 receptor losing its ability to form a functional death-inducing signaling complex and induce apoptosis. The mutant receptors also have a “dominant negative” effect whereby they inhibit the ability of TRAIL to induce apoptosis through functional DR4 receptors. This dominant negative mechanism is achieved through competition for TRAIL binding as shown by experiments where the ability of the mutant DR5 receptor to bind with the ligand was abolished, thus restoring TRAIL signaling through DR4. The inhibitory effect on signaling through the wild-type DR4 protein can be overcome if the inhibitory mechanism is bypassed by using a DR4-agonistic antibody that is not subject to this competition. This study provides a molecular basis for the use of specific therapeutic agonists of TRAIL receptors in people whose tumors harbor somatic DR5 mutations.

In addition, other signaling pathways leading to NFκB activation and activation of the ERK, JNK, and p38 MAP kinase pathways are generated by a second complex that forms after the receptor-containing DISC (14Varfolomeev E.

TRAIL also binds to three other receptors, TRAIL-R3 (DcR1), TRAIL-R4 (DcR2), and osteoprotegerin. DcR1 is a glycophosphatidylinositol-anchored membrane protein without a death domain, and DcR2 contains a truncated death domain; DcR1 and DcR2 are unable to recruit FADD or signal apoptosis and inhibit apoptosis by sequestering TRAIL or by forming complexes with DR4 and DR5 to create heteromeric receptor complexes that are unable to activate signaling (15Merino D.

DR4 and DR5 map to human chromosome 8p21-22, a site of frequent allelic loss in tumors. This led to the suggestion that as potential tumor suppressors TRAIL receptors may also harbor somatic mutations in human tumors. Mutations in DR4 and DR5 have been identified in various human tumors (17Lee S.H. Shin M.S. Kim H.S. Lee H.K. Park W.S. Kim S.Y. Lee J.H. Han S.Y. Park J.Y. Oh R.R. Jang J.J. Han J.Y. Lee J.Y.

Most mutations identified so far are in DR5 and affect the intracellular domain of the receptor, i.e. the region that binds FADD. For example, in a study of non small cell lung cancer, ∼10% of tumors had mutations in the death domain of DR5 (17Lee S.H. Shin M.S. Kim H.S. Lee H.K. Park W.S. Kim S.Y. Lee J.H. Han S.Y. Park J.Y. Oh R.R. Jang J.J. Han J.Y. Lee J.Y. Yoo N.J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5683-5686PubMed Google Scholar) and similar mutations were found in 20% of breast cancers from patients with lymph node involvement (20Shin M.S. Kim H.S. Lee S.H. Park W.S. Kim S.Y. Park J.Y. Lee J.H. Lee S.K. Lee S.N. Jung S.S. Han J.Y. Kim H. Lee J.Y. Yoo N.J. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4942-4946PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the small number of patients studied so far and uncertainties about how common these mutations are in different populations of cancer patients, some mutations have been found repeatedly in different tumor types and in different patients with the same disease, suggesting that TRAIL receptor mutations are selected during tumorigenesis and, therefore, may have important functional effects in tumor cells. A mutagenesis study from El-Deiry and co-workers (22McDonald E.R. Chui III, P.C. Martelli P.F. Dicker D.T. El-Deiry W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14939-14945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) showed that some of the tumor mutations in DR5 produced a receptor that was compromised in its ability to induce apoptosis when exogenously expressed. This study also suggested that the mutant receptors were unable to properly bind FADD; however, these experiments were performed in cells with non-physiological levels of the mutant receptor alongside the endogenous wild-type DR5 protein. It was also unclear whether the mutant DR5 receptor had any effect on signaling by DR4. Here, we studied tumor-derived somatic mutations in DR5 by expressing them at physiological levels in DR5-deficient cells and found that these receptors lost their ability to recruit FADD and caspase-8 or to induce apoptosis. Surprisingly, we found that TRAIL-induced apoptosis was blocked in the DR5 mutant cells even in the presence of wild-type DR4. The mechanism of this “dominant negative” effect is that mutant DR5 receptors prevent TRAIL from binding to DR4. Importantly, this effect can be overcome by directly activating the wild-type DR4 receptors with an agonistic antibody instead of the ligand. This provides a rationale for choosing among TRAIL receptor therapeutic agonists to maximize tumor cell killing even in cells where somatic mutations in one of the receptors create a situation where cells are unable to respond to the physiological ligand. Reagents—Antibodies and reagents were purchased from the following sources: Caspase-8 and FADD antibodies, Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA; anti-green fluorescent protein, Chemicon, Temecula, CA; mapatumumab (previously known as HGS-ETR1) and lexatumumab (previously known as HGS-ETR2), Human Genome Sciences. Untagged and His-tagged recombinant TRAIL, mouse IgG, anti-mouse IgG Fc polyclonal antibodies were from R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN. The full-length DR5 cDNA was cloned into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of pcDNA3.1-Puro(+) as described (12Thomas L.R. Johnson R.L. Reed J.C. Thorburn A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52479-52486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and point mutations were made by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange® XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). DR5 mutants were also inserted in-frame with mCherry into pEmCherry-N1 plasmid. Cells and Culture Conditions—BJAB cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 plus 10% fetal bovine serum. DR5 wild-type and mutant cell lines were generated by electroporating mammalian constructs into the cells and selecting for stable transformants as previously described (12Thomas L.R. Johnson R.L. Reed J.C. Thorburn A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52479-52486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To assess expression levels of the receptors, cells were prepared using the manufacturer's protocol, stained with antibodies against DR5 and DR4 (R&D Systems), and analyzed using a FASCalibur flow cytometer. DISC IP—1 × 107 cells were suspended in 10 ml of culture medium, incubated with lexatumumab at 1 μg/ml in 4 °C for 30 min, transferred to 37 °C for another 1 h, washed in phosphate-buffered saline three times, and then lysed in IP buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris·Cl, pH 7.5/1% Triton X-100) supplemented with complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). After the lysates were centrifuged (15 min at 13,000 rpm), antibodies were precipitated at 4 °C overnight. The beads were washed three times with IP buffer supplemented with 0.5 m NaCl, and samples were subjected to Western blotting analysis. Cytotoxicity Assay—Cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 1.0 × 106 cells/ml in growth medium. Agonistic DR5 or DR4 antibody was cross-linked with an equal amount of anti-human IgG Fc for 30 min before serial dilution. TRAIL was prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions before addition to the cells. After 24 h, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt (MTS) reagent (Promega, Madison, WI) was added to each well and incubated for an additional 2 h. Percent survival was calculated compared with control wells containing no agonists. Subcellular Fractionation—1.0 × 107 cells were pelleted at 1,200 × g for 10 min at room temperature and washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline three times before resuspension in 500 μl of ice-cold hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 42 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubation on ice for 20 min. Cells were homogenized by passing through a 30-gauge needle and centrifuged at 200 × g for 10 min to remove nuclei and cell debris. The supernatant was spun at 13,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C, and this supernatant was collected as the cytosolic fraction. The pellet was washed in ice-cold hypotonic buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, incubated on ice for 30 min, and then centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C; the supernatant represented the membrane fraction. To investigate the tumor-derived somatic mutations under normal signaling conditions without overexpression, mammalian expression constructs of wild-type DR5 and the point mutations E326K, L334F, E338K, and K386N were transfected into the previously described (12Thomas L.R. Johnson R.L. Reed J.C. Thorburn A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52479-52486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) DR5-deficient BJAB cells (BJABDR5 DEF). After selection with puromycin, we used an anti-DR5 antibody to measure cell surface expression of wild-type and mutant DR5 by flow cytometry. Cells stably expressing wild-type or mutant DR5 at approximately physiological expression levels on the cell surface (Fig. 1A) were sorted and used for further experiments. All the cell lines expressed equivalent amounts of the wild-type endogenous DR4 molecule; these lines therefore represent an isogenic set of cells that all express TRAIL receptors at physiologically relevant levels but differ in the particular tumor-derived point mutation in DR5 that is expressed. To test whether the DR5 mutants were functional we used a DR5-specific agonistic antibody that is in clinical development (lexatumumab). Cells were treated with increasing amounts of lexatumumab, and cytotoxicity was measured after 24 h. As expected based on our previous work (12Thomas L.R. Johnson R.L. Reed J.C. Thorburn A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52479-52486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), BJABDR5 DEF cells were completely resistant to lexatumumab whereas cells expressing wild-type DR5 died in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). Cells expressing DR5 molecules with each of the mutations were also resistant to lexatumumab-induced death, indicating that these point mutations abolish the ability of DR5 to induce apoptosis. We hypothesized that DR5 mutants could not induce apoptosis because they fail to assemble the DISC. To test this hypothesis, we performed a DISC IP experiment using lexatumumab. FADD and caspase-8 were detected in wild-type DR5 receptor complex, while the four mutants that were resistant to lexatumumab-induced cell death were unable to recruit FADD and caspase-8 to the receptor complex (Fig. 1C). To test whether the other proteins required for death receptor-induced apoptosis were intact and functional, we tested whether DR5 mutant cells responded to Fas ligand and TRAIL. The DR5-deficient cells, all the DR5 mutant cells, and the cells expressing wild-type DR5 were equally sensitive to Fas ligand-induced cell death (Fig. 2, left), indicating that FADD, caspase-8, and other downstream signaling proteins involved in death receptor-induced apoptosis were functional in all the cell lines. Surprisingly, although the wild-type DR5-expressing cells showed the expected leftward shift in the dose-response curve, we found that the four DR5 mutant cells were resistant to soluble TRAIL-induced apoptosis as shown by a marked rightward shift in the dose-response curve compared with the BJABDR5 DEF cells (Fig. 2, right). As we showed in Fig. 1A, all the DR5 mutant cells, the BJABDR5 DEF, and the wild-type DR5 cells have the same amount of DR4 receptors on the cell surface. Thus, all the cells have wild-type DR4, and in the cells that lack any DR5 this protein can efficiently induce apoptosis in response to TRAIL. However, expression of the DR5 mutant proteins blocks the ability of the DR4 protein to signal. The tumor-derived mutations therefore have a dominant negative phenotype whereby they not only are unable to induce apoptosis on their own, they also block the ability of functional DR4 to signal. DcR2 inhibits TRAIL signaling by binding with DR5 to form heterocomplexes that cannot signal in response to TRAIL (15Merino D. Lalaoui N. Morizot A. Schneider P. Solary E. Micheau O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 7046-7055Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 16Clancy L. Mruk K. Archer K. Woelfel M. Mongkolsapaya J. Screaton G. Lenardo M.J. Chan F.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 18099-18104Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The other “decoy” receptor, DcR1, has been reported to work by a competition mechanism by binding TRAIL (15Merino D. Lalaoui N. Morizot A. Schneider P. Solary E. Micheau O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 7046-7055Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Similar mechanisms might also apply to the mutant DR5; the mutant DR5 might form a complex with wild-type DR4 and thus prevent DR4 from signaling or the mutant DR5 might compete for TRAIL binding. To test the underlying mechanism by which the somatic DR5 mutations from tumor cells block signaling through wild-type DR4, we focused on the E338K mutant because it showed the strongest inhibitory effect on TRAIL signaling through DR4 (Fig. 2B) and has been identified in different kinds of cancer and in different patients with the same kind of cancer (19Lee S.H. Shin M.S. Kim H.S. Lee H.K. Park W.S. Kim S.Y. Lee J.H. Han S.Y. Park J.Y. Oh R.R. Kang C.S. Kim K.M. Jang J.J. Nam S.W. Lee J.Y. Yoo N.J.

Yoo N.J. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4942-4946PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that it has a functional effect on tumor cell behavior that is selected for during tumor development and progression. To test whether ligand competition is important for the dominant negative effect, we made mutant receptors that cannot bind TRAIL. If the dominant negative mechanism is due to ligand competition, then a DR5 molecule that contains the E338K tumor mutation in the intracellular domain along with a second mutation in the extracellular domain that prevents TRAIL binding should prevent the dominant negative effect and the DR4 signaling should occur as in the cells that lack any DR5. Methionine 152 of DR5 is critical for TRAIL binding (23Hymowitz S.G. Christinger H.W. Fuh G. Ultsch M. O'Connell M. Kelley R.F. Ashkenazi A. de Vos A.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 563-571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Another important structure in the DR5 extracellular domain is the pre-ligand assembly domain (PLAD) from amino acids 81 to 97, and deletion of these amino acids has been reported to prevent ligand binding (16Clancy L. Mruk K. Archer K. Woelfel M. Mongkolsapaya J. Screaton G. Lenardo M.J. Chan F.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 18099-18104Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). We made three constructs (all fused with an mCherry fluorescence protein tag to facilitate detection) that contain the E338K mutation in the intracellular death domain along with wild-type extracellular domain (DR5E338K), the M152A mutation (DR5E338K/M152A), or the deletion of the PLAD (DR5E338K/ΔPLAD). All the mutant DR5 receptors were expressed at similar levels in the cell membrane fraction (Fig. 3A) although the ΔPLAD mutant was also found in the cytoplasm. This was confirmed by immunofluorescence microscopy (data not shown), suggesting that this mutation also affected trafficking. To test whether the DR5 mutants could bind TRAIL on the surface of these cells, we performed a DISC IP experiment with His-tagged TRAIL and probed the resulting Western blots with anti-Cherry. Only the DR5 E338K protein with wild-type extracellular domain could interact with TRAIL (Fig. 3B). When we tested the sensitivity of these cells to His-TRAIL, we found that cells expressing DR5E338K-mCherry were resistant while cells expressing proteins that contain the E338K intracellular mutation along with extracellular mutations that abolish ligand binding were equally sensitive as the parental DR5-deficient cells and that the cells with wild-type DR5-Cherry were more sensitive (Fig. 3C). It should be noted that the His-TRAIL is less potent that the untagged recombinant TRAIL used in Fig. 2B and efficient killing required higher concentrations of His-TRAIL. However, the extent of resistance caused by the E338K mutation alone compared with DR5-deficient cells (i.e. the rightward shift in the dose-response curve) was equivalent to that observed with untagged TRAIL (Fig. 2B). Therefore, the dominant negative effect whereby a DR5 molecule with an intracellular point mutation blocks TRAIL signaling through wild-type DR4 is abolished by secondary mutations that cause the mutant DR5 protein to be unable to bind the ligand. We asked whether mutant DR5 was physically interacting with wild-type DR4 by precipitating DR5 from cells treated with or without TRAIL and asking whether DR4 was present in the complex. Consistent with a previous report showing that although DR4 and DR5 can form complexes together, the relative amount of the heterocomplex is small (10Kischkel F.C. Lawrence D.A. Chuntharapai A. Schow P. Kim K.J. Ashkenazi A. Immunity. 2000; 12: 611-620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar), we found little DR4 interacting with either mutant of wild-type DR5 in our cells (data not shown). These data further support the idea that the mutant DR5 molecules work by competing for TRAIL binding. If this hypothesis is correct, it should be possible to avoid the dominant negative mechanism by activating DR4 with an agonist that cannot bind to DR5. Such an agonist (the mapatumumab antibody) has been developed and is in clinical trials (24Tolcher A.W. Mita M. Patnaik A. Rowinsky E.K. Corey A. Fleming M.D. Fox N.L. Weiner L.M. Meropol N.J.

Cancer. 2005; 92: 1430-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Therefore, if this mechanism is applicable, it should be feasible to activate TRAIL receptor-induced apoptosis in tumor cells that have been selected during tumor development and progression to block TRAIL signaling by DR5 mutation. To test this idea, we treated the isogenic BJAB cell lines expressing no DR5, wild-type DR5, or the E338K mutant with increasing doses of mapatumumab. All the cells were equally sensitive to mapatumumab-induced apoptosis irrespective of whether they had wild-type, mutant, or no DR5 (Fig. 4). TRAIL-deficient animals have more hematological malignancies (26Zerafa N. Westwood J.A. Cretney E. Mitchell S. Waring P. Iezzi M. Smyth M.J. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 5586-5590Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), suggesting a tumor suppression role for this pathway for at least some kinds of cancer. TRAIL signaling is also an important mechanism of T cell- and Natural Killer cell-mediated tumor surveillance, and defective TRAIL signaling can increase metastasis (27Schmaltz C. Alpdogan O. Kappel B.J. Muriglan S.J. Rotolo J.A. Ongchin J. Willis L.M. Greenberg A.S. Eng J.M. Crawford J.M. Murphy G.F. Yagita H. Walczak H. Peschon J.J. van den Brink M.R. Nat.

TRAIL receptor stimulation by chemotherapy may also be an important determinant of the therapeutic response as shown by inducible silencing of DR5, which leads to acquired resistance to 5-fluorouricil (30Wang S. El-Deiry W.S. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 6666-6672Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Therefore, in addition to the possibility of directly activating TRAIL receptor signaling with recombinant TRAIL or the agonistic antibodies to treat cancer, defective TRAIL signaling can affect many aspects of tumor development, progression, and treatment. All these effects produce selective pressure on tumor cells to evolve ways to avoid TRAIL signaling. Various mechanisms that can inhibit TRAIL signaling in tumors have been identified, including increased expression of inhibitors such as FLIP and DcR1 and DcR2 or decreased expression of DR4 and DR5 (31Shivapurkar N.

In tumors most mutations have been identified in DR5, and the tumor cells retain wild-type DR4 genes. Because TRAIL can signal through either DR4 or DR5, a simple loss of function mutation in one of the receptors without affecting the other might therefore not be expected to prevent signaling in response to TRAIL. Thus it is puzzling that such mutations would be selected during tumor development and progression. Using cells that express physiological levels of mutant or wild-type DR5 along with the endogenous wild-type DR4, we show here that at least some of the tumor mutations in DR5 have a more severe phenotype. The DR5 mutations not only block signaling by the mutant receptor itself (confirming previous results from Dr. El-Deiry's group) (22McDonald E.R. Chui III, P.C. Martelli P.F. Dicker D.T. El-Deiry W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14939-14945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) but also have a dominant negative phenotype whereby expression of the mutant DR5 at the normal physiological levels can also prevent signaling by TRAIL through DR4. This leads to a situation where the presence of the mutant DR5 actually leads to a more severe inhibition of TRAIL signaling than loss of the protein. Therefore, in tumor cells that have such mutations all TRAIL signaling would be inhibited even though the wild-type DR4 receptor is present, and this would be expected to confer a stronger selective advantage to the tumor cell. We conclude that the mechanism by which signaling through DR4 is inhibited involves competition for ligand binding but not the formation of significant amounts of heterocomplexes that contain DR4 and DR5. TRAIL receptors can also activate NFκB and MAPK pathways (14Varfolomeev E. Maecker H. Sharp D. Lawrence D. Renz M. Vucic D. Ashkenazi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 40599-40608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), which can inhibit apoptosis. Therefore, we also considered the possibility that the mutated DR5 receptors might still be able to activate these cell survival signal pathways and thus overcome apoptosis signaling through DR4. However, lexatumumab could not activate the NFκB and p38 pathways in the DR5 (E338K) mutant cell line, and upon TRAIL stimulation these cells showed less activation of NFκB, p38, JNK, and ERK compared with wild-type DR5 cells (data not shown). Therefore, the mutant receptors do not send survival signals that block DR4-induced apoptosis, providing further support for our idea that the inhibitory effect is mediated by the ligand competition mechanism. Understanding this mechanism led us to predict that we should be able to avoid the dominant negative mechanism by activating DR4 with an antibody that does not recognize DR5. Our data (Fig. 4) with mapatumumab show that this is indeed feasible. Moreover, because this antibody is in clinical development (24Tolcher A.W. Mita M. Patnaik A. Rowinsky E.K. Corey A.

Cancer. 2005; 92: 1430-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), this result shows that such an approach might be used to provide a rational basis for choosing particular TRAIL receptor therapeutic agonists for treatment of particular patients. For example, we predict that a person whose tumor has the E338K mutation would not benefit from treatment with either recombinant TRAIL or an anti-DR5 antibody but would be more likely to benefit from treatment with mapatumumab. It may also be feasible to avoid the inhibitory effect of mutant TRAIL receptors using modified versions of TRAIL that target only one of the receptors (35MacFarlane M. Kohlhaas S.L. Sutcliffe M.J.

https://openalex.org/W2038348721,"Ingestion of the lectins present in certain improperly cooked vegetables can result in acute GI tract distress, but the mechanism of toxicity is unknown. In vivo, gut epithelial cells are constantly exposed to mechanical and other stresses and consequently individual cells frequently experience plasma membrane disruptions. Repair of these cell surface disruptions allows the wounded cell to survive: failure results in necrotic cell death. Plasma membrane repair is mediated, in part, by an exocytotic event that adds a patch of internal membrane to the defect site. Lectins are known to inhibit exocytosis. We therefore tested the novel hypothesis that lectin toxicity is due to an inhibitory effect on plasma membrane repair.Repair of plasma membrane disruptions and exocytosis of mucus was assessed after treatment of cultured cell models and excised segments of the GI tract with lectins. Plasma membrane disruptions were produced by focal irradiation of individual cells, using a microscope-based laser, or by mechanical abrasion of multiple cells, using a syringe needle. Repair was then assessed by monitoring the cytosolic penetration of dyes incapable of crossing the intact plasma membrane. We found that cell surface-bound lectins potently inhibited plasma membrane repair, and the exocytosis of mucus that normally accompanies the repair response.Lectins potently inhibit plasma membrane repair, and hence are toxic to wounded cells. This represents a novel form of protein-based toxicity, one that, we propose, is the basis of plant lectin food poisoning."
https://openalex.org/W1968469862,"The recently identified subfamily of WNK protein kinases is characterized by a unique sequence variation in the catalytic domain and four related human WNK genes were identified. Here, we describe the cloning and functional analysis of the human family member WNK2. We show that the depletion of endogenous WNK2 expression by RNA interference in human cervical HeLa cancer cells led to the activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinases but, in contrast to the depletion of WNK1, had no effect on ERK5. Furthermore, expression of a kinase-dead WNK2-K207M mutant also activated ERK1/2 suggesting that WNK2 catalytic activity is required. Depletion of WNK2 expression increased G1/S progression and potentiated the cellular response to low epidermal growth factor concentrations. The molecular mechanism of ERK1/2 activation in WNK2-depleted cells lies downstream of the Raf kinases and involves MEK1 phosphorylation at serine 298 in both HeLa and HT29 colon cancer cells. This modification is linked to the upregulation of MEK1 activity toward ERK1/2. Together, these results provide evidence that WNK2 is involved in the modulation of growth factor-induced cancer cell proliferation through the MEK1/ERK1/2 pathway. The data identify WNK2 as a candidate tumor suppressor gene and suggest a coordinated activity of WNK kinases in the regulation of cell proliferation."

Metabolic flux through the OPPC increases stoichiometrically in response to a broad range of chemical oxidants, including those that generate reactive oxygen species (ROS). Here we show that OPPC sensitivity is sufficient to detect low levels of ROS produced metabolically as a function of the percentage of O2. We observe a significant decrease in OPPC activity in cells incubated under severe and moderate hypoxia (ranging from <0.01 to 4% O2), whereas hyperoxia (95% O2) results in a significant increase in OPPC activity. These data indicate that metabolic ROS production is directly dependent on oxygen concentration. Moreover, we have found no evidence to suggest that ROS, produced by mitochondria, are needed to stabilize hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) under moderate hypoxia. Myxothiazol, an inhibitor of mitochondrial electron transfer, did not prevent HIF-1α stabilization under moderate hypoxia. Moreover, the levels of HIF-1α that we observed after exposure to moderate hypoxia were comparable between ρ0 cells, which lack functional mitochondria, and the wild-type cells. Finally, we find no evidence for stabilization of HIF-1α in response to the non-toxic levels of H2O2 generated by the enzyme glucose oxidase.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5209-5215Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), the initial and rate-limiting enzyme of the OPPC, exists in a dimer-tetramer equilibrium with the tetramer being the catalytically active conformation. Each of four identical G6PD monomers contains a structural NADP+ binding site (4Cosgrove M.S. Naylor C. Paludan S. Adams M.J. Levy H.R.

In non-stressed cells, the [NADPH]/[NADP+] ratio is very high (approaching 1000) and flux through the OPPC is minimal. However, even a slight increase in [NADP+] can increase the number of active G6PD tetramers. Therefore, G6PD activity, by regulating flux through the OPPC, is uniquely sensitive to reactive oxygen species (ROS) as well as other chemical oxidants. oxidative pentose phosphate cycle reactive oxygen species hypoxia-inducible factor glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase ionizing radiation modified Eagle's medium 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propane-sulfonate [2-(2-nitro-1H-imidazol-1-yl)-N-(2,2,3,3,3-pentafluoropropyl)acetamide] glucose oxidase. oxidative pentose phosphate cycle reactive oxygen species hypoxia-inducible factor glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase ionizing radiation modified Eagle's medium 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propane-sulfonate [2-(2-nitro-1H-imidazol-1-yl)-N-(2,2,3,3,3-pentafluoropropyl)acetamide] glucose oxidase. The importance of the OPPC for the cellular response to ROS is evident from the elevated incidence of apoptosis that we observed in G6PD– Chinese hamster ovary cells following exposure to ionizing radiation (2Tuttle S.

Notably, a 10-fold reduction in cloning efficiency was seen in G6PD– mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) incubated in an atmosphere of 24% O2 when compared with paired wild-type control MEFs.

The incidence of replicative senescence was much higher in MEFs grown at 20% O2 than in parallel cultures grown at 3% O2 (8Parrinello S. Samper E. Krtolica A. Goldstein J. Melov S. Campisi J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 741-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar). These data were attributed to the enhanced production of oxidative DNA damage due to the increased production of ROS at the higher oxygen tension. Notably, G6PD– primary human fibroblasts grown at 21% O2 senesced more readily than wild-type cells due to their limited capacity to remove metabolically produced ROS (9Cheng M. Ho H. Wu Y. Chiu D.T. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2004; 36: 580-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar).

J. 1973; 134: 707-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (2085) Google Scholar). In addition to using G6PD-deficient cells to examine toxic effects of ROS, we have used metabolic flux through the OPPC to measure ROS produced during the metabolism of xenobiotic compounds or during exposure to ionizing radiation (IR) (1Tuttle S.W.

Oncol. Biol. Phys. 1992; 22: 665-669Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). IR produces these ROS under both aerobic and hypoxic conditions (13von Sonntag C. The Chemical Basis of Radiation Biology. Taylor & Francis, Philadelphia1987Google Scholar). However, H • or eaq– can react with O2, when present, to produce superoxide and hydroxyl radicals (O2·¯ and HO•), which undergo dismutation to form additional H2O2. Upon investigating the effect of oxygen on IR-induced OPPC activity, we noticed a significant decrease in flux through the OPPC in the unirradiated control samples incubated under severe hypoxia compared with parallel cultures of cells irradiated in air. This suggested that OPPC activity could be used to measure metabolically produced ROS, providing us with means to directly test a recent hypothesis (14Mansfield K.D. Guzy R.D. Pan Y. Young R.M.

This hypoxia-induced ROS model has led to the suggestion that ROS (specifically H2O2) arising at complex III of mitochondria are needed to stabilize HIF-1α. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) is a master transcription factor consisting of two subunits, the hypoxia-inducible α subunit and the constitutively expressed β subunit (17Semenza G.L. Nat. Rev.

HIF-1 binds to consensus sequences found in various hypoxia-inducible genes including vascular endothelial growth factor, glucose transporter 1, and several key glycolytic enzymes.

Discovery of HIF-1α-specific proline hydroxylases explained the enhanced stability of HIF-1α under hypoxia, because these enzymes exhibit an absolute dependence on oxygen (23Epstein A.C. Gleadle J.M. McNeill L.A. Hewitson K.S. O'Rourke J. Mole D.R. Mukherji M. Metzen E. Wilson M.I. Dhanda A. Tian Y.M. Masson N. Hamilton D.L. Jaakkola P. Barstead R. Hodgkin J. Maxwell P.H. Pugh C.W. Schofield C.J.

Science. 2001; 294: 1337-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (2092) Google Scholar). Although this is still accepted as the mechanism of HIF-1α stabilization under anoxia, it has been recently challenged by the theory that ROS are necessary for HIF-1α stabilization at more moderate levels of hypoxia. Our data using flux through the OPPC as a measure of ROS indicate that metabolic production of ROS is directly dependent on percentage of O2 across a broad range, from near anoxia (<0.015%) to hyperoxia (95%). We find no evidence for elevated ROS production under moderate hypoxia. Moreover, our data suggest that stabilization of HIF-1α does not depend on O2 consumption and is not effected by respiratory inhibition. Finally, low level generation of H2O2, by glucose oxidase, did not increase HIF-1α protein levels. Culture Conditions—HT1080 human fibrosarcoma and A549 human lung carcinoma cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and were routinely checked and found free of mycoplasma. They were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air + 5% carbon dioxide in modified Eagle's medium (MEM) (standard buffer sodium bicarbonate) supplemented with penicillin and streptomycin, 15% fetal calf serum, non-essential amino acids, and 1 mm pyruvate. For the experiments reported here, MEM was made from its individual components, with 2 mm glucose, 20 mm HEPES (i.e. no bicarbonate, to allow CO2 release), without pyruvate (i.e. to prevent scavenging of H2O2). Thin Film Culture Method—Percentage of O2 is defined with respect to 1 atmosphere of dry gas at 37 °C (a partial pressure of 760 mm Hg). Because many of the experimental conditions cause changes in oxygen utilization or availability, oxygen control is a critical component of the experimental design. Thus, cells were plated onto the central area of 60-mm preconditioned glass Petri dishes and allowed to attach overnight (25Koch C. Sen C. Packer L. Methods in Enzymology: Antioxidants and Redox Cycling. 352. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2002: 3-31Google Scholar, 26Koch C.J. Radiat. Res. 1984; 97: 434-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). For experiments, the medium was replaced by 1 ml of fresh medium, without pyruvate. Each dish was sealed in an aluminum chamber and the percentage of O2 in the gas phases was decreased to the desired level by a series of precision evacuations of the chamber followed by replacement with nitrogen (gas exchanges). After warming, the chambers were shaken continuously at 37 °C to ensure that the O2 in the gas phase was in equilibrium with the O2 in the culture medium (25Koch C. Sen C. Packer L. Methods in Enzymology: Antioxidants and Redox Cycling. 352. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2002: 3-31Google Scholar, 26Koch C.J. Radiat. Res. 1984; 97: 434-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To measure macromolecular synthesis, a small amount of radioactive thymidine or leucine was added to standard medium and the amount incorporated into cellular macromolecules determined by rinsing followed by acid precipitation and liquid scintillation counting. 14CO2 Release Assay—Cells were plated into preconditioned 25-mm glass scintillation vials. Although the surface of the vials was smaller than that of the 60-mm dishes, measurement of EF5 binding (see below) confirmed that the percentage of O2 in situ was similar under these slightly divergent experimental conditions. OPPC and Krebs cycle activity was determined by incubating the cells in 1 ml of bicarbonate-free medium containing 2 mm [1-14C]- or [6-14C]glucose, respectively (supplemental Fig. 1) at a final specific activity of 100 μCi/mmol glucose. 14CO2 released was trapped on a 1 × 0.5-cm Whatman GF/B glass fiber filter saturated with 0.1 ml of 5% KOH. Krebs cycle measurements, obtained in parallel samples incubated with [6-14C]glucose, were used to correct the OPPC measurements obtained from samples incubated with [1-14C]glucose (1Tuttle S.W. Varnes M.E. Mitchell J.B. Biaglow J.E. Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys. 1992; 22: 671-675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Each vial was completely sealed with a silicone serum stopper. To ensure the gas phase within each vial was in equilibrium with the gas phase in the aluminum chamber, a 25-gauge needle was inserted through the serum stopper. This effectively allowed slow evacuation and refilling to take place during the gas exchanges while maintaining an effective barrier against leakage of CO2 from the vials during the incubation periods. This method does not allow instantaneous changes in the oxygen levels, but the metabolic impact of the gradual change in the percentage of O2 in the gas and liquid phases was minimized by performing the gas exchanges at room temperature. Protein Collection and Western Blots—To prevent postincubation changes in HIF-1α, the chambers, and all reagents, were cooled on ice for 20 min. When the chambers were opened, 100 μm deferoximine was added to the ice-cold medium and included in all subsequent steps. The cells were rinsed and scraped into versene, centrifuged, resuspended in 20 μl of phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in hypotonic buffer with CHAPS, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and Sigma protease inhibitor (27Horan A.D. Giandomenico A.R. Koch C.J. Radiat Res. 1999; 152: 144-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). For whole cell extracts, urea was added followed by a high speed spin, and the supernatant was frozen. To separate nuclear from cytoplasmic proteins, the nuclei were centrifuged after lysis and the nuclear pellet and cytoplasmic supernatants treated individually as with whole lysed cells. These methods do not affect HIF-1α levels as determined by direct lysis of cells from suspension cultures (either aerobic or hypoxic) in sample buffer. HIF-1α antibody was from Transduction Laboratories; antibodies for β-tubulin and Ku86 were from Sigma. Respiration—Cellular oxygen consumption was measured using a high sensitivity Clark-style polarographic sensor and spinner vial apparatus designed by one of the authors (25Koch C. Sen C. Packer L. Methods in Enzymology: Antioxidants and Redox Cycling. 352. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2002: 3-31Google Scholar). Myxothiazol was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide and added in a volume of <0.5% of the total. Production of ρ0 Cells—ρ0 HT1080 cells were made by methods adapted from Desjardins et al. (28Desjardins P. Frost E. Morais R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 1163-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded at low density (5000 cells/T75 flask) in supplemented MEM with 25 ng/ml ethidium bromide, 50 μg/ml uridine, and an additional 5 mm glucose. Over 2–3 weeks they grew slowly while losing their ability to consume oxygen. Furthermore, the residual oxygen consumption was insensitive to myxothiazol. EF5 Binding—EF5 is a 2-nitroimidazole that forms covalent protein adducts in viable cells in a manner that is inversely proportional to the intracellular oxygen concentration, thus allowing for quantitative measurement (see Fig. 2 and supplemental Fig. S2). EF5 binding and analysis of its hypoxia-dependent adducts has been published extensively (25Koch C. Sen C. Packer L. Methods in Enzymology: Antioxidants and Redox Cycling. 352. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2002: 3-31Google Scholar, 30Lee J. Siemann D.W. Koch C.J. Lord E.M. Int. J. Cancer. 1996; 67: 372-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 31Koch C.J. Evans S.M.

Cancer. 1995; 72: 875-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In brief, the optical aspects of the flow cytometric evaluation are calibrated with a reference concentration of EF5 adducts determined by radioactive drug uptake. Reaction of α-Keto Acids with Hydrogen Peroxide—H2O2 and α-keto acids were added at equimolar concentration and the loss of H2O2 measured using a peroxide sensor (Yellow Springs). The reaction rate (K) was measured based upon the assumption that the reaction was stoichiometric (i.e. equal loss of peroxide and α-keto acid). The data were fit to the equation: rate = K × [H2O2] × [Acid]n. The logarithms of the rate divided by peroxide concentration were plotted against logarithm acid concentration to determine n. Respiration accounts for a small portion of the 14CO2 produced metabolically by cells incubated with [1-14C]glucose. However, an equivalent amount of 14CO2 is produced via respiration in cells incubated with [6-14C]glucose. In contrast, 14CO2 is not produced via the OPPC when cells are incubated with [6-14C]glucose. Therefore, by measuring 14CO2 released from replicate samples incubated with [1-14C]glucose or [6-14C]glucose, in situ OPPC activity can be accurately measured (see supplemental Fig. S1). OPPC activity in cultured A549 cells is stimulated by a variety of chemical oxidants (Fig. 1A). OPPC activity was exquisitely sensitive to H2O2 added directly to the cell culture as a bolus. Moreover, it was also extremely sensitive to continuous production of superoxide and H2O2 via drugs that undergo futile redox cycling, including misonidazole or tirapazamine (SR4233) (29Tuttle S.W. Hazard L. Koch C.J. Mitchell J.B. Coleman C.N. Biaglow J.B. Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys. 1994; 29: 357-362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Thiol-specific oxidants, such as hydroxyethyldisulfide or chemicals such as diamide, which can oxidize thiols but can also oxidize NADPH directly, (1Tuttle S.W. Varnes M.E. Mitchell J.B. Biaglow J.E. Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys. 1992; 22: 671-675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 33Biaglow J.B. Ayene I.S. Koch C.J. Donahue J. Stamato T.D. Tuttle S.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 2000; 273: 846-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), also induce elevated OPPC activity. We observed increased OPPC activity in cells exposed to IR (Fig. 1B). The slope of the dose-response curve obtained with cells irradiated in 21% O2 was 2.3-fold higher than the slope obtained when cells were irradiated under 0.02% O2, a direct reflection of the increased yield of H2O2 in irradiated aqueous solutions under aerobic conditions. There was a significant decrease (1.8-fold) in OPPC activity in the unirradiated samples under hypoxic (0.02% O2), compared with normoxic (20% O2), conditions (Fig. 1B). Based on this observation, we performed a systematic measure of OPPC activity as a function of varying the percentage of O2. Fig. 1C demonstrates that OPPC activity increases in both A549 and HT1080 tumor cells as a logarithmic function of percentage of O2, ranging from near anoxia (<0.01%) to hyperoxia (95%) (see Fig. 1C). Although OPPC activity, measured at <0.01% O2, was significantly higher (1.9-fold) in HT1080 versus A549 cells, the overall increase in OPPC activity that was observed in response to increasing the O2 content was remarkably similar in both cell lines. These results suggest that the in situ production of ROS is directly dependent on the presence of O2, as originally proposed in the classical work describing enhanced metabolic production of ROS in response to hyperoxia by Boveris and Chance (10Boveris A. Chance B. Biochem. J. 1973; 134: 707-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (2085) Google Scholar). Production of 14CO2 by cells incubated with [6-14C]glucose is used to correct for glucose oxidation via respiration (Krebs cycle) in our measurements of OPPC activity (Fig. 1C). By normalizing these data to the effect observed at 20% O2 we were also able to determine the oxygen dependence of cellular respiration (Fig. 1D). In these experiments the percentage of O2 that the cells experience is precisely controlled using a “thin film” culture method (25Koch C. Sen C. Packer L. Methods in Enzymology: Antioxidants and Redox Cycling. 352. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2002: 3-31Google Scholar), with a slight modification in order to measure OPPC activity (see “Experimental Procedures”). The in situ O2 percentage was confirmed using EF5, a 2-nitroimidazole that forms covalent protein adducts in viable hypoxic cells (31Koch C.J. Evans S.M. Lord E.M. Br. J. Cancer. 1995; 72: 869-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 32Evans S.M. Joiner B. Jenkins W.T. Laughlin K.M. Lord E.M. Koch C.J. Br. J. Cancer. 1995; 72: 875-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 33Biaglow J.B. Ayene I.S. Koch C.J. Donahue J. Stamato T.D. Tuttle S.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 2000; 273: 846-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The EF5 protein adducts are detected quantitatively via flow cytometry (supplemental Fig. S2). We used the thin film culture method to determine the O2 dependence of EF5 binding in control, myxothiazol-treated, and ρ0 HT1080 cells (Fig. 2). We then examined EF5 binding in the cells grown in the glass vials used to measure OPPC activity to verify that the percentage of O2 in situ was as expected. We then measured cellular oxygen consumption, using a Clark-style oxygen electrode (25Koch C. Sen C. Packer L. Methods in Enzymology: Antioxidants and Redox Cycling. 352. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2002: 3-31Google Scholar). The data clearly demonstrate that 0.5 μm myxothiazol, a mitochondrial complex III inhibitor, was extremely effective at blocking cellular oxygen consumption (Fig. 3A). These data were confirmed by the ability of myxothiazol to inhibit the release of 14CO2 from cells incubated in [6-14C]glucose. We also observed a pronounced increase in glucose consumption and lactate production in response to myxothiazol (data not shown). Myxothiazol had no effect on OPPC activity (14CO2 release from cells incubated in [1-14C]glucose), irrespective of the percentage of O2 (Fig. 3B). Although myxothiazol has been reported to be cytotoxic, we observed little toxicity following a 4-h exposure to 0.5 μm, although protein and DNA synthesis were both inhibited by 0.5 mm myxothiazol (supplemental Fig. S3). ρ0 HT1080 cells, which lack functional mitochondria, utilized O2 at a much slower rate than wild-type HT1080 cells. Myxothiazol had no effect on the rate of O2 consumption in two independently generated ρ0 cell lines (Fig. 3A). We next determined the effect of myxothiazol on HIF-1α stabilization under severe or moderate hypoxia (Fig. 3C). HIF-1α protein was not evident in the cytosolic or nuclear fractions from cells incubated in 21% O2. As expected, HIF-1α protein levels increased in both the cytosolic and nuclear fraction, isolated from cells incubated under moderate (0.4% O2) or severe (<0.01% O2) hypoxia. No difference was observed in stabilization of HIF-1α at <0.01 or 0.4% O2 in the presence or absence of 0.5 μm myxothiazol (Fig. 3C). Normal stabilization of HIF-1α protein was observed in HT1080 ρ0 cells incubated at <0.01 or 0.4% O2 (Fig. 4A). To determine whether the generation of H2O2 affects the stability of HIF-1α, we used exogenous glucose oxidase (GO) to increase the steady state levels of H2O2 to which the cells were exposed. The addition of GO, at 0.02 and 0.1 units/ml, stimulated OPPC activity in both wild-type and ρ0 HT1080 cells (Fig. 4B). OPPC stimulation in the presence of GO appeared to be entirely due to production of H2O2, because it was completely inhibited by the addition of excess catalase (data not shown). The low steady state levels of H2O2 produced at these GO concentrations had no effect on clonogenic survival (data not shown). Moreover, GO did not affect HIF-1α protein levels at any of the O2 levels tested (0.01–20%) (Fig. 4C). We have used the classical method of measuring 14CO2 released by cells incubated with [1-14C]glucose or [6-14C]glucose to determine OPPC and Krebs cycle activity as a function of percentage of O2. OPPC activity increases in response to a broad range of chemicals that oxidize NADPH, directly or indirectly, as shown in Fig. 1A. For example, hydroxyethyldisulfide is a thiol-specific oxidant; subsequently, NADPH acts as the electron donor to reduce the disulfides that are formed by hydroxyethyldisulfide. The exquisite sensitivity of OPPC to ROS has been confirmed by measuring OPPC stimulation in cells exposed to low levels of ROS produced by IR (H•, HO•, eaq–, H2O2) and by drugs that undergo futile redox cycling, such as SR4223 and misonidazole (O2·¯). We recognize that these species react to form hydroperoxides within the cell; however, theoretically we cannot"
https://openalex.org/W2008869612,"Despite the significance of mitochondrial ATP synthase for mammalian metabolism, the regulation of the amount of ATP synthase in mammalian systems is not understood. As brown adipose tissue mitochondria contain very low amounts of ATP synthase, relative to respiratory chain components, they constitute a physiological system that allows for examination of the control of ATP synthase assembly. To examine the role of the expression of the P1-isoform of the c-Fo subunit in the biogenesis of ATP synthase, we made transgenic mice that express the P1-c subunit isoform under the promoter of the brown adipose tissue-specific protein UCP1. In the resulting UCP1p1 transgenic mice, total P1-c subunit mRNA levels were increased; mRNA levels of other F1Fo-ATPase subunits were unchanged. In isolated brown-fat mitochondria, protein levels of the total c-Fo subunit were increased. Remarkably, protein levels of ATP synthase subunits that are part of the F1-ATPase complex were also increased, as was the entire Complex V. Increased ATPase and ATP synthase activities demonstrated an increased functional activity of the F1Fo-ATPase. Thus, the levels of the c-Fo subunit P1-isoform are crucial for defining the final content of the ATP synthase in brown adipose tissue. The level of c-Fo subunit may be a determining factor for F1Fo-ATPase assembly in all higher eukaryotes."
https://openalex.org/W2015872419,"Tumor suppressor SMAR1 interacts and stabilizes p53 through phosphorylation at its serine-15 residue. We show that SMAR1 transcription is regulated by p53 through its response element present in the SMAR1 promoter. Upon Doxorubicin induced DNA damage, acetylated p53 is recruited on SMAR1 promoter that allows activation of its transcription. Once SMAR1 is induced, cell cycle arrest is observed that is correlated to increased phospho-ser-15-p53 and decreased p53 acetylation. Further we demonstrate that SMAR1 expression is drastically reduced during advancement of human breast cancer. This was correlated with defective p53 expression in breast cancer where acetylated p53 is sequestered into the heterochromatin region and become inaccessible to activate SMAR1 promoter. In a recent report we have shown that SMAR1 represses Cyclin D1 transcription through recruitment of HDAC1 dependent repressor complex at the MAR site of Cyclin D1 promoter. Here we show that downmodulation of SMAR1 in high grade breast carcinoma is correlated with upregulated Cyclin D1 expression. We also established that SMAR1 inhibits tumor cell migration and metastases through inhibition of TGFbeta signaling and its downstream target genes including cutl1 and various focal adhesion molecules. Thus, we report that SMAR1 plays a central role in coordinating p53 and TGFbeta pathways in human breast cancer."

In contrast, a typical eukaryotic Dicer consists of a DExH helicase domain, a domain of unknown function (DUF)283, and a PAZ domain at the N terminus as well as two RIII domains and a dsRNA-binding domain (dsRBD) at the C terminus. Recent biochemical studies have shown that human Dicer operates as a monomer and that its tandem RIII domains form one processing center and cleave the opposite strand of dsRNA (22Zhang H. Kolb F.A. Jaskiewicz L. Westhof E. Filipowicz W. Cell. 2004; 118: 57-68Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). This model is supported by the x-ray crystal structure of Dicer (Protein Data Base number 2FFL) from the human parasite Giardia intestinalis. The primitive Giardia Dicer only carries a PAZ domain followed by tandem RIII domains. As Dicer resembles the shape of a hatchet, the two RIII domains form the blade as an intramolecular dimer that is similar to the homodimeric structure of prokaryotic RNase III (23Macrae I.J. Zhou K. Li F. Repic A. Brooks A.N. Cande W.Z. Adams P.D. Doudna J.A. Science. 2006; 311: 195-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). In Drosophila melanogaster, two Dicer enzymes, Dcr-1 and Dcr-2, are responsible for miRNA and siRNA production, respectively (8Jiang F. Ye X. Liu X. Fincher L. McKearin D. Liu Q. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1674-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 21Lee Y.S. Nakahara K. Pham J.W. Kim K. He Z. Sontheimer E.J. Carthew R.W.

Science. 2003; 301: 1921-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). Despite extensive sequence homology, Dcr-1 and Dcr-2 display distinct substrate specificities and ATP requirements (8Jiang F. Ye X. Liu X. Fincher L. McKearin D. Liu Q. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1674-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Dcr-1 prefers to process pre-miRNA to miRNA in an ATP-independent manner. Dcr-2 is much better at processing dsRNA and requires ATP hydrolysis for efficient siRNA production (8Jiang F. Ye X. Liu X. Fincher L. McKearin D. Liu Q. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1674-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). By contrast, human and most other organisms contain a single Dicer that generates both miRNAs and siRNAs. Typically, Dicer functions in tandem with a specific dsRNA-binding protein (5Paroo Z. Liu Q. Wang X. Cell Res. 2007; 17: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). For example, Dcr-2 and R2D2 constitute the Drosophila, siRNA-generating enzyme (24Liu Q. Rand T.A. Kalidas S. Du F. Kim H.E. Smith D.P. Wang X. Science. 2003; 301: 1921-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). R2D2 contains two dsRBD domains and forms a heterodimeric complex with Dcr-2 (24Liu Q. Rand T.A. Kalidas S. Du F. Kim H.E. Smith D.P. Wang X. Science. 2003; 301: 1921-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). Although R2D2 does not regulate siRNA production, it cooperates with Dcr-2 to promote assembly of the effector siRISC complexes (24Liu Q. Rand T.A. Kalidas S. Du F. Kim H.E. Smith D.P. Wang X. Science. 2003; 301: 1921-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar, 25Liu X. Jiang F. Kalidas S. Smith D. Liu Q. RNA (Cold Spring Harbor). 2006; 12: 1514-1520Google Scholar, 26Tomari Y. Matranga C. Haley B. Martinez N. Zamore P.D. Science. 2004; 306: 1377-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Only the Dcr-2-R2D2 complex, neither Dcr-2 nor R2D2 alone, could efficiently interact with duplex siRNA (25Liu X. Jiang F. Kalidas S. Smith D. Liu Q. RNA (Cold Spring Harbor). 2006; 12: 1514-1520Google Scholar). Both Dcr-2 and R2D2 are critical components of the RISC loading complex, the formation of which precedes and is required for RISC activation (27Tomari Y. Du T. Haley B. Schwarz D.S. Bennett R.

Liu X. Fincher L. McKearin D. Liu Q. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1674-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 30Forstemann K. Tomari Y. Du T. Vagin V.V. Denli A.M. Bratu D.P. Klattenhoff C. Theurkauf W.E. Zamore P.D. PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: e236Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 31Saito K. Ishizuka A. Siomi H. Siomi M.C. PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: e235Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The loqs gene produces alternative spliced transcripts encoding three protein isoforms (PA-PC). All three isoforms are expressed in S2 cells, whereas only PA and PB are expressed in fly tissues (30Forstemann K. Tomari Y. Du T. Vagin V.V. Denli A.M. Bratu D.P. Klattenhoff C. Theurkauf W.E. Zamore P.D. PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: e236Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Both Loqs-PA and Loqs-PB carry three dsRBD domains (8Jiang F. Ye X. Liu X. Fincher L. McKearin D. Liu Q. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1674-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 30Forstemann K. Tomari Y. Du T. Vagin V.V. Denli A.M. Bratu D.P. Klattenhoff C. Theurkauf W.E. Zamore P.D. PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: e236Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Loqs-PB is slightly larger than Loqs-PA by 46 amino acids. As shown by biochemical fractionation of S2 extracts, Dcr-1 and Loqs-PB, but not Loqs-PA or Loqs-PC, correlate perfectly with the miRNA-generating activity (8Jiang F. Ye X. Liu X. Fincher L. McKearin D. Liu Q. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1674-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Although recombinant Dcr-1 is able to process pre-miRNA to miRNA, Loqs-PB greatly enhances miRNA production by increasing the affinity of Dcr-1 for pre-miRNA (8Jiang F. Ye X. Liu X. Fincher L. McKearin D. Liu Q. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1674-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Similar to Loqs, TRBP and PACT contain three dsRBD domains and have recently been identified as two dsRNA-binding proteins for human Dicer. In the current study, we performed detailed domain structure and functional analyses to dissect the molecular mechanism of pre-miRNA processing by the Drosophila miRNA-generating (Dcr-1-Loqs) enzyme. Cloning and Expression of Recombinant Protein—All truncated constructs were generated by PCR and subcloning using full-length Dcr-1, Loqs-PA, and Loqs-PB cDNA as templates (8Jiang F. Ye X. Liu X. Fincher L. McKearin D. Liu Q. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1674-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The catalytic mutants of Dcr-1 were constructed by using “QuikChange” (Stratagene). Recombinant His- or FLAG-tagged full-length or truncated Dcr-1-Loqs proteins were produced in insect cells using the BAC-to-BAC baculovirus expression system (Invitrogen). Large scale productions of recombinant Dcr-1 proteins were conducted as described previously (8Jiang F. Ye X. Liu X. Fincher L. McKearin D. Liu Q. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1674-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 24Liu Q. Rand T.A. Kalidas S. Du F. Kim H.E. Smith D.P. Wang X. Science. 2003; 301: 1921-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). For interaction studies in insect cells, 200 μl of each virus was added to 10 ml of 106 cells/ml Sf21 cells in a T25 flask. Cell extracts were prepared in the lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100) 40 h after viral infection. For interaction studies in S2 cells, expression constructs for full-length or truncated Myc-Dcr-1 and GFP-Loqs were generated by the “Gateway” system (Invitrogen). Transient transfections of S2 cells were conducted using Cellfectin (Invitrogen). Cell lysates were prepared 40 h after transfection. Antibodies and Immunoprecipitation (IP)—Mouse monoclonal anti-Dcr-1 and anti-Loqs antibodies were generated against purified recombinant Dcr-1-Loqs-PB complex. The polyclonal anti-GFP antibodies were purchased from Invitrogen, whereas monoclonal anti-FLAG (M2), anti-Myc (9E10), and anti-His (HIS-1) antibodies were from Sigma. For co-IPs, ∼2 mg of cell extract was incubated with 5 μl of antibodies at 4 °C for 2 h followed by the addition of 10 μl pre-washed protein A beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After rotating at 4 °C overnight, the beads were washed six times with the IP wash buffer (110 mm potassium acetate, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm Mg(OAc)2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 1% Nonidet P-40) and boiled in 2× SDS sample buffer for 5 min. Sedimentation Analysis—In parallel, 300 μl (10 μg/μl) of S100 extract of S2 cells and 50 nm purified recombinant Dcr-1 or Dcr-1-Loqs-PB complex were applied onto a 3-ml 10–30% glycerol gradient. The contents were centrifuged at 55,000 rpm at 4 °C for 3.5 h using an SW60Ti rotor (Beckman). Fourteen fractions (250 μl/fraction) were taken from the top of the tube and subsequently used for Western blotting to detect the presence of Dcr-1. The Pre-miRNA Processing Assay—Synthetic pre-let-7 and pre-bantam RNA (Dharmacon) were radiolabeled at the 5′ end by T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biochemicals) and [γ-32P] ATP (Valeant Pharmaceuticals) or at the 3′ end by T4 RNA ligase (Ambion) and [α-32P] pCp (Amersham Biosciences) followed by PAGE purification. Typically, 5 × 104 cpm pre-miRNA was incubated with recombinant Dcr-1 enzymes at 30 °C for 30 min in 10-μl reactions (25Liu X. Jiang F. Kalidas S. Smith D. Liu Q. RNA (Cold Spring Harbor). 2006; 12: 1514-1520Google Scholar). For the kinetic studies (see Fig. 3g), 2.5 × 105 cpm (∼0.2 pmol) pre-miRNA was incubated with 0.2 pmol of recombinant Dcr-1 enzymes. The Pre-miRNA Gel-shift Assay—Recombinant Dcr-1-Loqs-PB proteins were incubated with 5 × 105 cpm of 5′-radiolabeled pre-miRNA at 30 °C for 30 min in the same buffer as the processing assay. The reaction mixtures were resolved on a 6% native PAGE as described previously (8Jiang F. Ye X. Liu X. Fincher L. McKearin D. Liu Q. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1674-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The UV Cross-linking Assay—The 20-μl pre-miRNA gelshift reactions were performed as described above followed by exposure to UV light for 20 min in a 96-well dish. After adding 5 μl of 4× SDS sample buffer, the mixture was boiled for 5 min, resolved on a 4–20% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to cellulose membrane followed by autoradiography. Two RNase III Domains of Dcr-1 Form an Intramolecular Dimer—Previous studies have revealed that the two RIII domains of human Dicer form an intramolecular dimer and cleave the opposite strands of dsRNA (22Zhang H. Kolb F.A. Jaskiewicz L. Westhof E. Filipowicz W. Cell. 2004; 118: 57-68Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). To determine whether Drosophila Dcr-1 had a similar action mechanism, we generated a series of catalytic mutant Dcr-1 enzymes. Based on the sequence alignment, Asp-1749 and Glu-1908 of RIIIa and Asp-2036 and Glu-2139 of RIIIb were predicted to be the corresponding catalytic residues of Dcr-1 (Fig. 1a). We inactivated either or both of the RIII domains of Dcr-1 by changing these residues to alanine by site-directed mutagenesis. Wild type and mutant His-tagged Dcr-1 recombinant proteins were produced using an insect cell expression system and highly purified by Ni2+ affinity column followed by Q-Sepharose and SP-Sepharose chromatography (8Jiang F. Ye X. Liu X. Fincher L. McKearin D. Liu Q. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1674-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). We compared the cleavage patterns of wild type and various catalytic mutant Dcr-1 enzymes by in vitro pre-miRNA-processing assays using either a 5′-radiolabeled or a 3′-radiolabeled substrate. Mutations of both RIII domains (E1908A/E2139) completely abolished the ability of Dcr-1 to process pre-miRNA (Fig. 1b, compare lane 1 and lane 6). Interestingly, the RIIIa (D1749A or E1908A) mutants could only cleave the 5′ (top) strand, but not the 3′ (bottom) strand, of pre-miRNA (Fig. 1b, compare lane 1 and lanes 2 and 3). Conversely, the RIIIb (D2036A or E2139A) mutants were able to cut the 3′ strand, but not the 5′ strand, of pre-miRNA (Fig. 1b, compare lane 1 and lanes 4 and 5). The mirroring cleavage patterns indicate that 5′-RIIIa cleaves the 3′ strand, whereas 3′-RIIIb cuts the 5′ strand of pre-miRNA. Thus, like human Dicer, the tandem RIII domains of Dcr-1 form one processing center. The staggered pair of cuts made by RIIIa and RIIIb excises miRNA from pre-miRNA and creates a characteristic two-nucleotide 3′ overhang terminus (Fig. 1c). Dcr-1 Exists as a Monomer—We characterized the sizes of the endogenous and recombinant Dcr-1 proteins by sedimentation analysis. On a 10–30% glycerol gradient, the Dcr-1 protein in S2 extracts fractionated with a peak of ∼400 kDa (Fig. 2). The data suggested that the bulk of endogenous Dcr-1 existed as a monomeric form and in complex with other cellular components, such as Loqs and Ago1 (8Jiang F. Ye X. Liu X. Fincher L. McKearin D. Liu Q. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1674-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 30Forstemann K. Tomari Y. Du T. Vagin V.V. Denli A.M. Bratu D.P. Klattenhoff C. Theurkauf W.E. Zamore P.D. PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: e236Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). At an equivalent concentration, recombinant Dcr-1 and Dcr-1-Loqs-PB complex migrated at positions that were consistent with a Dcr-1 monomer and a Dcr-1-Loqs-PB heterodimer (Fig. 2). Together, these results indicate that Dcr-1 functions as a monomer at physiological condition. Pre-miRNA Processing by Truncated Dcr-1—Dcr-1 is a multidomain RNase III enzyme that contains a helicase domain, a DUF283 domain, a PAZ domain, two RIII domains, and a dsRBD domain. To determine which of these domains were critical for Dcr-1 function, we generated a series of truncated (T1–T6) Dcr-1 and compared their activities to that of wild type enzyme by pre-miRNA-processing assays (Fig. 3, a and b). As shown in Fig. 3, c and d, removal of the DUF283 domain (T2) and/or the PAZ domain (T3) completely abolished the ability of Dcr-1 to generate miRNAs. Similar results were obtained whether using a pre-let-7 (miRNA located at the 5′ strand) (Fig. 3c) or pre-bantam (miRNA at the 3′ strand) substrate (Fig. 3d). In contrast, Dcr-1 could efficiently process pre-miRNA to miRNA without the N-terminal helicase domain (T1) or the C-terminal dsRBD domain (T5). Intriguingly, deletion of both domains (T6) still resulted in a functional Dcr-1 enzyme (Fig. 3, e and f). Further kinetic studies revealed that T1, T5, and T6 retained ∼38, 61, or 15% of the miRNA-generating activity of a wild type Dcr-1 enzyme (Fig. 3g). Dcr-1 Preferentially Associates with Loqs-PB—As shown by coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments, FLAG-tagged Dcr-1 could form a complex with either His-tagged Loqs-PA or His-tagged Loqs-PB in insect cells following co-infection of baculoviruses (Fig. 4a). Intriguingly, when insect cells were co-infected with all three viruses, Dcr-1 associated Loqs-PB almost exclusively, although Loqs-PA and Loqs-PB were expressed at equivalent levels (Fig. 4a). This result suggests that the two Loqs isoforms compete for Dcr-1 binding and that Dcr-1 may have higher affinity for Loqs-PB than Loqs-PA. We further examined the association between the endogenous Dcr-1 and Loqs proteins by co-IPs using anti-Dcr-1 and anti-Loqs monoclonal antibodies. Although anti-Loqs antibodies brought down all three Loqs (PA, PB, PC) proteins from S2 extracts, Loqs-PB was the predominant isoform detected in the IPs of anti-Dcr-1 antibodies (Fig. 4b). This was consistent with our previous observation that Dcr-1 and Loqs-PB, but not Loqs-PA or Loqs-PC, correlated perfectly with the miRNA-generating activity (8Jiang F. Ye X. Liu X. Fincher L. McKearin D. Liu Q. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1674-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Together, these biochemical results indicate that Dcr-1 and Loqs-PB constitute the miRNA-generating enzyme. Interaction Domains between Dcr-1 and Loqs—To determine how Dcr-1 interacted with Loqs, we examined the interaction between FLAG-Loqs-PB and various His-tagged truncated Dcr-1 proteins in insect cells (Fig. 3a). Following co-infection of the Dcr-1-Loqs baculoviruses, IPs were performed with anti-FLAG antibodies followed by Western blotting with anti-His antibodies. As shown in Fig. 5a, Loqs-PB was unable to interact with T1, T2, or T3 of Dcr-1, all of which lacked the N-terminal helicase domain. Conversely, Loqs-PB interacted strongly with the full-length, T4, or T5 of Dcr-1 that shared the helicase domain in common. These results indicate that Loqs interacts with the helicase domain of Dcr-1. Next, we generated four truncated Loqs-PB constructs to map the region of Loqs that interacted with Dcr-1 (Fig. 5b). We performed co-IP experiments to examine the interaction between Myc-tagged helicase domain (Myc-helciase) of Dcr-1 and GFP-tagged truncated Loqs (L1–L4) in S2 cells after co-transfection of the Dcr-1-Loqs expression constructs. The anti-GFP antibodies specifically brought down Myc-helicase only in the presence of L3 (dsRBD2-dsRBD3) or L4 (dsRBD3), but not L1 (dsRBD1-dsRBD2) or L2 (dsRBD2) (Fig. 5c). Therefore, the Dcr-1-Loqs-PB association involves the N-terminal helicase domain of Dcr-1 and the C-terminal dsRBD (dsRBD3) of Loqs. Loqs-PB is larger than Loqs-PA by 46 amino acids that immediately precede the C-terminal dsRBD domain. To determine whether these 46 residues were responsible for high affinity binding between Loqs-PB and Dcr-1, we generated the L5 construct by specifically removing the 46 residues from L4. As shown in Fig. 5d, full-length Myc-Dcr-1 could interact individually with either GFP-L4 or GFP-L5, which represented the minimal Dcr-1 interaction domains of Loqs-PB and Loqs-PA, respectively. However, Myc-Dcr-1 preferentially associated with GFP-L4 rather than GFP-L5 when all three constructs were co-transfected into S2 cells. Thus, the miniature L4 and L5 constructs recapitulate the difference in Dcr-1 affinity between Loqs-PB and Loqs-PA. Loqs-PB Requires Its Second and Third dsRBDs for Dcr-1 Regulation—Although Dcr-1 alone is able to process pre-miRNA to miRNA, Loqs-PB greatly enhances miRNA production by increasing the affinity of Dcr-1 for pre-miRNA (8Jiang F. Ye X. Liu X. Fincher L. McKearin D. Liu Q. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1674-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). To determine which portions of Loqs-PB were critical for Dcr-1 regulation, we made recombinant full-length and various truncated Loqs-PB proteins (Fig. 6a) and compared their abilities to enhance Dcr-1 activity in the pre-miRNA-processing assay (Fig. 6b). As expected, L1 and L2 did not affect miRNA production because they lacked the third dsRBD domain that interacted with Dcr-1. Although L4 (dsRBD3) interacted with Dcr-1, it was unable to increase miRNA production. Only L3 (dsRBD2-dsRBD3) retained the ability to enhance the miRNA-generating activity of Dcr-1. These results indicate that the second and third dsRBDs of Loqs-PB are necessary and sufficient for Dcr-1 regulation. In parallel, native gel-shift assays were conducted to compare the pre-miRNA affinity of recombinant Dcr-1 in the absence or presence of full-length and truncated Loqs-PB (8Jiang F. Ye X. Liu X. Fincher L. McKearin D. Liu Q. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1674-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). In these assays, we employed the catalytic mutant (E1908A/E2139) Dcr-1 to prevent the cleavage of radiolabeled pre-miRNA. As shown in Fig. 6c, neither L1 nor L2 could increase the binding of Dcr-1 to pre-miRNA. On the other hand, L4 modestly increased, whereas L3 greatly enhanced the binding of Dcr-1 to pre-miRNA. We performed photocross-linking experiments to examine the physical interaction between pre-miRNA and recombinant Dcr-1-Loqs-PB proteins. As shown in Fig. 6, d and e, both Dcr-1 and Loqs-PB were efficiently cross-linked to radiolabeled pre-miRNA after exposure to ultraviolet light. In presence of Dcr-1, only L3 (dsRBD2-dsRBD3), but not L4 (dsRBD3), could be cross-linked to pre-miRNA. Furthermore, we specifically inactivated the dsRBD2 of Loqs in L3 by mutating two conserved alanines (Ala-308, Ala-309) to lysine residues as described previously for R2D2 (24Liu Q. Rand T.A. Kalidas S. Du F. Kim H.E. Smith D.P. Wang X. Science. 2003; 301: 1921-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). These point mutations abolished the ability of L3 to either interact with pre-miRNA or enhance miRNA production (Fig. 6, d–f). Together, these results indicate that Loqs-PB uses its dsRBD2 to bind pre-miRNA and dsRBD3 to interact with Dcr-1. Both domains of Loqs-PB are required for its ability to regulate Dcr-1 activity. The primitive Giardia Dicer carries only the PAZ domain and two RIII domains but displays robust dsRNA-processing activity (23Macrae I.J. Zhou K. Li F. Repic A. Brooks A.N. Cande W.Z. Adams P.D. Doudna J.A. Science. 2006; 311: 195-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). Here we show that Drosophila Dcr-1 can efficiently process pre-miRNA to miRNA without the N-terminal helicase and the C-terminal dsRBD domains. By contrast, removal of the PAZ and/or the DUF283 domains completely abolished the ability of Dcr-1 to generate miRNA. A similar phenomenon has been observed for human Dicer (32Lee Y. Hur I. Park S.Y. Kim Y.K. Suh M.R. Kim V.N. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 522-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Thus, we propose that the functional core of eukaryotic Dicer consists of a DUF283 domain, a PAZ domain, and two RIII domains. Both Loqs-PA and Loqs-PB use the third dsRBD domain to interact with the helicase domain of Dcr-1. However, Dcr-1 preferentially associates with Loqs-PB rather than Loqs-PA when both isoforms are co-expressed. As shown by biochemical fractionation, Dcr-1 and Loqs-PB, but not Loqs-PA, correlate perfectly with the miRNA-generating activity. Furthermore, transgenic expression of Loqs-PB, but not Loqs-PA, can rescue both developmental and miRNA-processing defects of homozygous loqs knock-out flies (33Park J.K. Liu X. Strauss T.J. McKearin D.M. Liu Q. Curr. Biol. 2007; 17: 533-538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Thus, the Loqs-PB, but not Loqs-PA, isoform is necessary and sufficient for Drosophila development and the miRNA pathway (33Park J.K. Liu X. Strauss T.J. McKearin D.M. Liu Q. Curr. Biol. 2007; 17: 533-538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Taken together, our previous and current studies demonstrate that the Dcr-1-Loqs-PB and Dcr-2-R2D2 complexes catalyze Drosophila miRNA and siRNA biogenesis, respectively (8Jiang F. Ye X. Liu X. Fincher L. McKearin D. Liu Q. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1674-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 24Liu Q. Rand T.A. Kalidas S. Du F. Kim H.E. Smith D.P. Wang X. Science. 2003; 301: 1921-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). Although R2D2 does not regulate the siRNA production of Dcr-2, Loqs-PB greatly enhances miRNA production by increasing the affinity of Dcr-1 for pre-miRNA (8Jiang F. Ye X. Liu X. Fincher L. McKearin D. Liu Q. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1674-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The current study suggests a simple model of pre-miRNA processing by the Dcr-1-Loqs complex. On its own, Dcr-1 is able to generate miRNA. The minimal requirements for Dcr-1 to process pre-miRNA include a DUF283 domain and a central PAZ domain followed by two RIII domains. The PAZ domain is believed to interact with the terminus of pre-miRNA stem. The DUF283 domain is a dsRNA-binding domain (34Dlakic M. Bioinformatics (Oxf.). 2006; 22: 2711-2714Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and may be critical for the binding or processing of pre-miRNA. The tandem RIII domains form an intramolecular dimer such that RIIIa cleaves the 3′ strand, whereas RIIIb cleaves the 5′ strand of pre-miRNA. The pair of cuts creates a two-nucleotide 3′ overhang and excises miRNA from pre-miRNA. On the other hand, Loqs-PB uses the C-terminal dsRBD3 to interact with the N-terminal helicase domain of Dcr-1. The middle dsRBD2 of Loqs-PB is responsible for direct binding to pre-miRNA. Interestingly, although L4 (dsRBD3) of Loqs-PB does not physically contact pre-miRNA, it modestly enhances the binding of Dcr-1 to pre-miRNA. One possible explanation is that the binding of dsRBD3 to Dcr-1 triggers a conformational change in Dcr-1, thereby increasing its affinity for pre-miRNA. These specific interactions greatly enhance the miRNA-generating activity of Dcr-1, possibly by strengthening the interaction between Dcr-1 and pre-miRNA. Additionally, they may organize the enzyme/substrate in a proper conformation for efficient processing. Our biochemical studies provide further insights into the functional anatomy of the Drosophila miRNA-generating enzyme. The results may help understand the process of miRNA biogenesis in other model organisms. We thank Dr. Wayne Lai at the antibody core facility for generating monoclonal antibodies and Drs.

https://openalex.org/W2056413661,"Background The SCID-hu Thy/Liv mouse model of HIV-1 infection is a useful platform for the preclinical evaluation of antiviral efficacy in vivo. We performed this study to validate the model with representatives of all four classes of licensed antiretrovirals. Methodology/Principal Findings Endpoint analyses for quantification of Thy/Liv implant viral load included ELISA for cell-associated p24, branched DNA assay for HIV-1 RNA, and detection of infected thymocytes by intracellular staining for Gag-p24. Antiviral protection from HIV-1-mediated thymocyte depletion was assessed by multicolor flow cytometric analysis of thymocyte subpopulations based on surface expression of CD3, CD4, and CD8. These mice can be productively infected with molecular clones of HIV-1 (e.g., the X4 clone NL4-3) as well as with primary R5 and R5X4 isolates. To determine whether results in this model are concordant with those found in humans, we performed direct comparisons of two drugs in the same class, each of which has known potency and dosing levels in humans. Here we show that second-generation antiretrovirals were, as expected, more potent than their first-generation predecessors: emtricitabine was more potent than lamivudine, efavirenz was more potent than nevirapine, and atazanavir was more potent than indinavir. After interspecies pharmacodynamic scaling, the dose ranges found to inhibit viral replication in the SCID-hu Thy/Liv mouse were similar to those used in humans. Moreover, HIV-1 replication in these mice was genetically stable; treatment of the mice with lamivudine did not result in the M184V substitution in reverse transcriptase, and the multidrug-resistant NY index case HIV-1 retained its drug-resistance substitutions. Conclusion Given the fidelity of such comparisons, we conclude that this highly reproducible mouse model is likely to predict clinical antiviral efficacy in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2011386958,"Fusobacterium nucleatum is a prominent member of the oral microbiota and is a common cause of human infection. F. nucleatum includes five subspecies: polymorphum, nucleatum, vincentii, fusiforme, and animalis. F. nucleatum subsp. polymorphum ATCC 10953 has been well characterized phenotypically and, in contrast to previously sequenced strains, is amenable to gene transfer. We sequenced and annotated the 2,429,698 bp genome of F. nucleatum subsp. polymorphum ATCC 10953. Plasmid pFN3 from the strain was also sequenced and analyzed. When compared to the other two available fusobacterial genomes (F. nucleatum subsp. nucleatum, and F. nucleatum subsp. vincentii) 627 open reading frames unique to F. nucleatum subsp. polymorphum ATCC 10953 were identified. A large percentage of these mapped within one of 28 regions or islands containing five or more genes. Seventeen percent of the clustered proteins that demonstrated similarity were most similar to proteins from the clostridia, with others being most similar to proteins from other gram-positive organisms such as Bacillus and Streptococcus. A ten kilobase region homologous to the Salmonella typhimurium propanediol utilization locus was identified, as was a prophage and integrated conjugal plasmid. The genome contains five composite ribozyme/transposons, similar to the CdISt IStrons described in Clostridium difficile. IStrons are not present in the other fusobacterial genomes. These findings indicate that F. nucleatum subsp. polymorphum is proficient at horizontal gene transfer and that exchange with the Firmicutes, particularly the Clostridia, is common."
https://openalex.org/W2059364271,"The cerebral cortex is permanently active during both awake and sleep states. This ongoing cortical activity has an impact on synaptic transmission and short-term plasticity. An activity pattern generated by the cortical network is a slow rhythmic activity that alternates up (active) and down (silent) states, a pattern occurring during slow wave sleep, anesthesia and even in vitro. Here we have studied 1) how network activity affects short term synaptic plasticity and, 2) how synaptic transmission varies in up versus down states.Intracellular recordings obtained from cortex in vitro and in vivo were used to record synaptic potentials, while presynaptic activation was achieved either with electrical or natural stimulation. Repetitive activation of layer 4 to layer 2/3 synaptic connections from ferret visual cortex slices displayed synaptic augmentation that was larger and longer lasting in active than in silent slices. Paired-pulse facilitation was also significantly larger in an active network and it persisted for longer intervals (up to 200 ms) than in silent slices. Intracortical synaptic potentials occurring during up states in vitro increased their amplitude while paired-pulse facilitation disappeared. Both intracortical and thalamocortical synaptic potentials were also significantly larger in up than in down states in the cat visual cortex in vivo. These enhanced synaptic potentials did not further facilitate when pairs of stimuli were given, thus paired-pulse facilitation during up states in vivo was virtually absent. Visually induced synaptic responses displayed larger amplitudes when occurring during up versus down states. This was further tested in rat barrel cortex, where a sensory activated synaptic potential was also larger in up states.These results imply that synaptic transmission in an active cortical network is more secure and efficient due to larger amplitude of synaptic potentials and lesser short term plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W1982589658,"Cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta- and gamma-secretases results in generation of the amyloid-beta protein (Abeta), which is characteristically deposited in the brain of Alzheimer's disease patients. Inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase (the statins) reduce levels of cholesterol and isoprenoids such as geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP). Previous studies have demonstrated that cholesterol increases and statins reduce Abeta levels mostly by regulating beta-secretase activity. In this study, we focused on the role of geranylgeranyl isoprenoids GGPP and geranylgeraniol (GGOH) in regulating Abeta production. Our data show that the inhibition of GGPP synthesis by statins plays an important role in statin-mediated reduction of Abeta secretion. Consistent with this finding, the geranylgeranyl isoprenoids preferentially increase the yield of Abeta of 42 residues (Abeta42) in a dose-dependent manner. Our studies further demonstrated that geranylgeranyl isoprenoids increase the yield of APP-CTFgamma (a.k.a. AICD) as well as Abeta by stimulating gamma-secretase-mediated cleavage of APP-CTFalpha and APP-CTFbeta in vitro. Furthermore, GGOH increases the levels of the active gamma-secretase complex in the detergent-insoluble membrane fraction along with its substrates, APP-CTFalpha and APP-CTFbeta. Our results indicate that geranylgeranyl isoprenoids may be an important physiological facilitator of gamma-secretase activity that can foster production of the pathologically important Abeta42."
https://openalex.org/W2050659481,"Growing evidences indicate that proteases are implicated in adipogenesis and in the onset of obesity. We previously reported that the cysteine protease cathepsin K (ctsk) is overexpressed in the white adipose tissue (WAT) of obese individuals. We herein characterized the WAT and the metabolic phenotype of ctsk deficient animals (ctsk-/-). When the growth rate of ctsk-/- was compared to that of the wild type animals (WT), we could establish a time window (5-8 weeks of age) within which ctsk-/-display significantly lower body weight and WAT size as compared to WT. Such a difference was not observable in older mice. Upon treatment with high fat diet (HFD) for 12 weeks ctsk-/- gained significantly less weight than WT and showed reduced brown adipose tissue, liver mass and a lower percentage of body fat. Plasma triglycerides, cholesterol and leptin were significantly lower in HFD-fed-ctsk-/- as compared to HFD-fed WT animals. Adipocyte lipolysis rates were increased in both young and HFD-fed-ctsk-/-, as compared to WT. Carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1 activity, was higher in mitochondria isolated from the WAT of HFD treated ctsk-/- as compared to WT. Together, these data indicate that ctsk ablation in mice results in reduced body fat content under conditions requiring a rapid accumulation of fat stores. This observation could be partly explained by an increased release and/or utilization of FFA and by an augmented ratio of lipolysis/lipogenesis. These results also demonstrate that under a HFD, ctsk deficiency confers a partial resistance to the development of dyslipidemia."
https://openalex.org/W2102149903,"Rotifers are among the most common non-arthropod animals and are the most experimentally tractable members of the basal assemblage of metazoan phyla known as Gnathifera. The monogonont rotifer Brachionus plicatilis is a developing model system for ecotoxicology, aquatic ecology, cryptic speciation, and the evolution of sex, and is an important food source for finfish aquaculture. However, basic knowledge of the genome and transcriptome of any rotifer species has been lacking.We generated and partially sequenced a cDNA library from B. plicatilis and constructed a database of over 2300 expressed sequence tags corresponding to more than 450 transcripts. About 20% of the transcripts had no significant similarity to database sequences by BLAST; most of these contained open reading frames of significant length but few had recognized Pfam motifs. Sixteen transcripts accounted for 25% of the ESTs; four of these had no significant similarity to BLAST or Pfam databases. Putative up- and downstream untranslated regions are relatively short and AT rich. In contrast to bdelloid rotifers, there was no evidence of a conserved trans-spliced leader sequence among the transcripts and most genes were single-copy.Despite the small size of this EST project it revealed several important features of the rotifer transcriptome and of individual monogonont genes. Because there is little genomic data for Gnathifera, the transcripts we found with no known function may represent genes that are species-, class-, phylum- or even superphylum-specific; the fact that some are among the most highly expressed indicates their importance. The absence of trans-spliced leader exons in this monogonont species contrasts with their abundance in bdelloid rotifers and indicates that the presence of this phenomenon can vary at the subphylum level. Our EST database provides a relatively large quantity of transcript-level data for B. plicatilis, and more generally of rotifers and other gnathiferan phyla, and can be browsed and searched at gmod.mbl.edu."
https://openalex.org/W2061839453,"Understanding the evolutionary forces that influence patterns of gene expression variation will provide insights into the mechanisms of evolutionary change and the molecular basis of phenotypic diversity. To date, studies of gene expression evolution have primarily been made by analyzing how gene expression levels vary within and between species. However, the fundamental unit of heritable variation in transcript abundance is the underlying regulatory allele, and as a result it is necessary to understand gene expression evolution at the level of DNA sequence variation. Here we describe the evolutionary forces shaping patterns of genetic variation for 1206 cis-regulatory QTL identified in a cross between two divergent strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We demonstrate that purifying selection against mildly deleterious alleles is the dominant force governing cis-regulatory evolution in S. cerevisiae and estimate the strength of selection. We also find that essential genes and genes with larger codon bias are subject to slightly stronger cis-regulatory constraint and that positive selection has played a role in the evolution of major trans-acting QTL."

In this study, we have analyzed in detail the interaction of p53 with CHIP and have discovered that the co-chaperone CHIP regulates p53 conformation and activity under physiological and elevated temperatures both in vitro and in vivo independent of Hsp90 function. CHIP prevents p53 from irreversible thermal inactivation and restores the DNA binding activity of heat-denatured p53 in an ATP-independent manner. In cells under elevated temperatures, CHIP helps resurrect the p53 mutant conformation into a folded native state. CHIP was shown to co-associate with WT p53 upon DBS in chromatin. We have proposed that CHIP might be a direct chaperone of WT p53 both under physiological and elevated temperatures.

ELISA-based Assay—An ELISA-based protein-protein interaction assay was utilized for CHIP-p53 and MDM2-p53 interaction studies. 96-Well Maxisorp ELISA plates (Nunc) were coated with 50 μl of a 10 μg/ml CHIP protein in PBS at 4 °C overnight. The wells were rinsed with PBS at 4 °C three times. Blocking was done with 2% BSA (Sigma) in PBS at 4 °C for 4 h. Following the blocking step, the wells were washed three times with PBS containing 0.01% (v/v) Tween 20 (Sigma). Native or denatured p53 protein (0.5 μg) was added into 50 μl of PBS, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, 0.2% (w/v) BSA and put in the CHIP-coated wells.

Finally, 100 μl of alkaline phosphate substrate with 50 mm Na2CO3, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mg/ml PNPP was added, and the enzymatic reaction was allowed to take place for 10–30 min at room temperature. The reaction was terminated by adding 50 μl of 0.1 m EDTA pH 8.0. The optical density at 405 nm was determined using a Microplate reader.

Cell Culture, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblotting—KB cells were purchased from NCCS (Pune, India) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Biological Industries) with 10% fetal calf serum. For immunoprecipitation, 70% confluent KB cells (both untreated and treated with proteasome inhibitor MG-132 as well as with geldanamycin (1.0 μm for 4 hours)) were washed with PBS, harvested, lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1.0% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, and 1.0% sodium deoxycholate). The whole cell lysate was precleared, and 1.0 μg of anti-CHIP polyclonal antibodies was used for immunoprecipitation. After a 2-h incubation with antibodies, 10 μl of protein A-agarose was added to the lysate and further incubated at 4 °C for 4 h. Washing was done twice with Nonidet P-40 buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm EDTA) and once with radioimmune precipitation buffer. Immunocomplexes were released by the addition of SDS loading dye, boiled for 5 min, centrifuged, and loaded to 10% SDS-PAGE. Transfer of proteins to nitrocellulose membrane was done and immunoblotted with target antibodies. The whole cell lysate was excluded from Hsp70 and Hsp90 by passing it through columns containing anti-Hsp70 and anti-Hsp90 antibodies and then used for immunoprecipitation. KB cells were transfected with HA-tagged expression vector pNHA1-p53, and cells were grown further for 30–36 h, followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibodies. To assess the effect of CHIP on the conformation of p53 under heat shock conditions, KB cells were transfected with increasing amounts (1.0 and 2.0 μg) of pcDNA3-CHIP, followed by immunoprecipitation as described above. GST Pull-down Assay—2.0 μg of purified GST, GST-CHIP, and GST-MDM2 recombinant proteins were conjugated to glutathione-Sepharose beads and incubated with 2.0 μg of wild type and various truncated recombinant p53s for 3 h at 4 °C in PBST buffer (PBS with 0.1% Tween 20). After incubation, beads were washed five or six times with PTx (PBS with 0.01% Triton X-100) (1 ml each), and the complex was eluted from the beads with 10 mm reduced glutathione in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). SDS loading dye was added to the eluted proteins, boiled for 5 min, and subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis followed by immunoblotting with anti-His antibodies (Oncogene). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—The DNA binding activity of p53 was monitored by EMSA. A 42-mer oligonucleotide containing a p53 binding site (5′-GGTACCAATTCTCGAGGAACATGTCCCCAACATGTTGCTCGAGATCTTTC-3′) was derived from the p21 promoter and synthesized from Microsynth. Sense and anti-sense oligonucleotides were end labeled by T4 polynucleotide kinase using [γ-32P]ATP, annealed, and purified by G-50 column. 5× EMSA buffer, 100 ng of poly(dI-dC), 100 ng of recombinant p53 protein, and 3.0 ng of radiolabeled probe DNA were added to make the reaction mixture, and water was added to make up the volume. The reaction mixture was incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. For the supershift assay, antibodies were added to the reaction mixture 0.5 h prior to the addition of radiolabeled nucleotide, the mixture was loaded to 4% native PAGE containing 0.5× TBE buffer, electrophoresed for 3 h at 175 V. Gel was then dried and exposed for autoradiography. To see the effect of CHIP on the DBS binding of p53, recombinant CHIP (up to 1.5 μg) was added to the reaction mixture prior to the addition of radiolabeled oligonucleotide. Further, in order to see the effect of CHIP on DNA binding activity of denatured p53, 100 ng of human recombinant p53 was diluted in 10 μl of EMSA buffer, and samples were supplemented with or without 500 ng of CHIP (native or denatured at 37, 45, and 50 °C) as well as in the presence and absence of 5 mm ATP. Such samples were incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. The activation step was followed by the addition of EMSA reaction mixture containing 1× EMSA buffer, poly(dI-dC), and radiolabeled nucleotide. Heat Shock Treatment—KB cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FCS at 37 °C in a humidified chamber containing 5.0% CO2. For heat shock experiments, cells were grown at 42 °C for 70 min in a CO2 incubator and then taken back to 37 °C for the indicated period of time. siRNA Transfections—siRNA templates specific for CHIP were synthesized from Sigma (sense, 5′-AGGCCCTGGCCGACTGCCG-3′; antisense, 5′-CGGCAGTCGGCCAGGGCC-3′) (as per Ambion's instruction manual), annealed, and cloned into pSilencer linear. For endogenous CHIP knockdown studies, KB cells were plated at a density of 1 × 106 on a 35-mm dish 18 h before transfection, and 0.5 and 1.0 μg of CHIP siRNA and control siRNA (scrambled) were transfected into KB cells at 37 and 42 °C, followed by Western blotting with anti-CHIP antibodies. Whole cell lysate of CHIP siRNA-transfected KB cells was taken for immunoprecipitation with conformation-specific antibodies. Aggregation Assay—p53 (1.0 μm) was incubated at 37, 45, and 50 °C with or without CHIP (2.0 μm). Thermal aggregation kinetics were monitored by measuring light scattering in a Cary Eclipse-fluorescence spectrophotometer in a Peltier-controlled thermostatted quartz cuvette. The measurements were done at excitation and emission wavelengths of 340 nm with excitation and emission bandwidths of 2.5 nm each. The above aggregation kinetics experiment was also repeated at 37 and 45 °C with CHIPΔ1–126. Thermal denaturation of CHIP was carried out by monitoring the absorbance at 280 nm in a Cary100 Bio UV spectrophotometer from Varian. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—The chromatin immunoprecipitation assay was performed as described previously (27Shang Y. Moyers M. Brown M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 601-610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). KB cells were cross-linked with 1.0% formaldehyde at 37 °C for 10 min, and cross-linking was stopped by the addition of 125 mm glycine. Cells were then rinsed twice with ice-cold PBS and centrifuged for 5 min. The pellet was then resuspended in 0.4 ml of lysis buffer (1.0% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, and 1.0% protease inhibitor mixture and sonicated five times for 5 s each at an interval of 2 min at submaximal input, followed by centrifugation for 10 min. Supernatant was collected and diluted in dilution buffer (1.0% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1), followed by immunoclearing with 2 μg of sheared salmon sperm DNA, 20 μl of preimmune serum, and protein A-agarose (20 μl of a 50% slurry in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, and 1 mm EDTA) for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitation was performed overnight with anti-p53 and anti-CHIP antibodies. After immunoprecipitation, 20 μl of protein A-agarose and 2 μg of salmon sperm DNA were added, and then incubation was continued for another hour. Agarose beads were washed sequentially for 10 min each in TSEI (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, and 150 mm HCl), TSEII (0.1% SDS, 1.0% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, and 500 mm HCl), and buffer III (0.25 m LiCl, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 1.0% deoxycholate, 1.0 mm EDTA, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1). Beads were then washed three times with TE buffer and extracted three times with 1.0% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3. Cross-linking was reversed by incubation of eluted samples for 6 h at 65 °C. The DNA was extracted with phenol-chloroform, precipitated with ethanol. The same amounts of eluted samples were taken for PCR. An equal amount of chromatin solution was precipitated with nonspecific antibody as a negative control. Input DNA was diluted in 50 μl of water, 1 μl of sample was taken for PCRs, and the same amounts of all PCR products were loaded on 10% native PAGE followed by silver staining. Sequences of the primers used in PCRs are as follows: p21-5′ site, sense (5′-GGGGTACCAGAAAGAAGCCTGTCC-3′) and antisense (5′-GGAAGATCTAATTACTGACATCCAG-3′); p21-3′ site, sense (5′-GGGGTACCCTTGGGCAGCAGTGAT-3′) and antisense (5′-GGAAGATCTAGCCCAAGGACAAAAT-3′); DBS-I, sense (5′-GGGGTACCTGGGATTGGGGTTTTC-3′) and antisense (5′-GGAAGATCTGAAGCTCAAACTTTT-3′); DBS-II, sense (5′-GGGGTACCCGGATTACTTGCCCTT-3′) and antisense (5′-GGAAGATCTTCCTGGCACAAAGCT-3′); DBS-III, sense (5′-CTTTGAGCTGCATGTTTGTGCC-3′) and antisense (5′-GGAAGATCTGGGTGGAAAATTCTG-3′). CHIP Binds to the Amino Terminus of p53—Although the significance of molecular interactions between p53 and heat shock proteins is unclear, both an ELISA-based assay and co-immunoprecipitation were utilized in detecting their interactions (6Muller L. Schaupp A. Walerych D. Wegele H. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 274: 48846-48854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Since the TPR domain of co-chaperone CHIP mediates the interaction of CHIP with Hsp90 and Hsp70 (17Alberti S. Bohse K. Arndt V. Schmitz A. Hohfeld J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4003-4010Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) in targeting p53 as substrate for its proteosomal degradation (18Esser C. Scheffner M. Hohfeld J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27443-27448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), we opted to determine in detail if there is a direct physical interaction between CHIP and p53 and whether this interaction is independent of Hsp90. We utilized both an ELISA-based assay and GST pull-down assay in binding experiments with highly purified recombinant proteins. The various constructs containing cDNAs encoding WT p53, core domain, p53Δ126–393, and p53Δ1–285 (Fig. 1A) were expressed in pET32a vector, and the His-tagged recombinant proteins were highly purified to homogeneity (>98%) (Fig. 1B). In order to confirm that purified fractions were not contaminated with bacterial Hsp70 and Hsp90, the proteins were run on SDS-PAGE and were immunoblotted with anti-Hsp70 and anti-Hsp90 antibodies. The results showed no bands, thus suggesting that the recombinant proteins were free of bacterial Hsp70 and Hsp90 (Fig. 1C). These highly purified proteins were further sequentially passed through immobilized Hsp70 and Hsp90 antibodies columns prior to loading onto the GST-CHIP column. In the ELISA, the wells were either coated with MDM2 or CHIP, followed by the addition of WT p53 or its truncated products. The retained p53 or its truncated products were probed with anti-p53 antibody pAb 421 (Fig. 1E). The control plate that was coated with BSA failed to retain p53, whereas both MDM2 (positive control) and CHIP-coated plates showed an increased binding (Fig. 1D) after the addition of p53 in a dose-dependent manner. We then determined the location of the CHIP binding site in p53. To analyze the domain interaction in detail, we bound different p53 fragments to the MDM2 and CHIP-coated plates. The amino terminus of p53 (p53Δ126–393) showed strong binding for both MDM2 and CHIP (Fig. 1E), whereas the COOH terminus and the core domain (not shown) failed to bind to CHIP. Since CHIP was shown to bind to p53 in the same region that binds to MDM2, we asked whether CHIP could compete with MDM2 binding to p53. In the first experiment, p53 was plated on ELISA plate followed by the addition of MDM2. After washing, an excess of CHIP was added, followed by incubation with anti-MDM2 antibodies. Alternatively, p53 was plated, followed by the addition of CHIP. After washing, excess MDM2 was added, followed by the addition of anti-CHIP antibodies. The results showed that CHIP did compete with MDM2 in binding to p53 (Fig. 1F). In a parallel approach, recombinant His-tagged WT p53 and its truncated fragments were passed through GST-MDM2 and GST-CHIP columns. After washing thoroughly, half of the eluted fragments were run on SDS-PAGE and Coomassie-stained (Fig. 2A), and the other half of the eluents were further transferred onto nitrocellulose for immunoblotting with anti-His antibodies (Fig. 2B). Both the stained and the immunoblotted gels showed that WT p53 and p53Δ126–393 were bound to CHIP (Fig. 2, A and B, lanes 4 and 5), whereas the core and COOH terminus domains failed to bind CHIP, thus confirming that the amino-terminal domain interacted with CHIP. As a positive control, GST-MDM2 was shown to bind to WT p53 and p53Δ126–393 (Fig. 2, A and B, lane 3).FIGURE 1Interaction of CHIP and p53 by ELISA.

To study the potential clinical relevance of interfering with JunB expression, we generated retroviruses expressing short hairpin RNA. Reduction of JunB levels causes increased proliferation and tumorigenicity in wild-type murine fibroblasts, whereas in c-Jun knockout cells p53-independent cell cycle arrest and apoptosis are induced. Using melanoma-derived B16-F10 cancer cells the combination of JunB knockdown and c-Jun/JNK inactivation leads to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis-inducing factor-dependent apoptosis. Furthermore, the combined treatment extends survival of mice inoculated with the tumor cells. These results indicate that in the absence of c-Jun, JunB can act as a tumor promoter and inactivation of both, c-Jun and JunB, could provide a valuable strategy for antitumor intervention."
https://openalex.org/W1989272848,"The potential tumor suppressor antizyme and its endogenous inhibitor (antizyme inhibitor, AZI) have been implicated in the ubiquitin-independent proteasomal degradation of proteins involved in cell proliferation as well as in the regulation of polyamine levels. We show here that both antizyme and AZI concentrate at centrosomes and that antizyme preferentially associates with the maternal centriole. Interestingly, alterations in the levels of these proteins have opposing effects on centrosomes. Depletion of antizyme in various cell lines and primary cells leads to centrosome overduplication, whereas overexpression of antizyme reduces numerical centrosome abnormalities. Conversely, silencing of the antizyme inhibitor, AZI, results in a decrease of numerical centrosome abnormalities, whereas overexpression of AZI leads to centrosome overduplication. We further show that the numerical centrosome abnormalities are due to daughter centriole amplification. In summary, our results demonstrate that alterations in the antizyme/AZI balance cause numerical centrosomal defects and suggest a role for ubiquitin-independent proteasomal degradation in centrosome duplication."
https://openalex.org/W2056365207,"Eukaryotic initiation factor 6 (eIF6), an essential protein important in ribosome biosynthesis and assembly, was identified as an interacting partner of the β-catenin C terminus in the yeast two-hybrid assay. Independent studies identified Drosophila eIF6 (DeIF6) in a genetic screen designed to detect new genes involved in the regulation of the Wnt/Wg (wingless) pathway. Ectopic expression of DeIF6 in wing discs results in a Wg phenotype. Expression of eIF6 in adenomatous polyposis coli (APC)-mutant colon cancer cells, which express high levels of active β-catenin, showed that eIF6 selectively inhibits the Wnt pathway at the level of β-catenin protein independently of proteasomal degradation. Incorporation of radiolabeled amino acids into β-catenin was selectively decreased in cells that overexpressed eIF6. A similar inverse relationship of the two proteins was observed in the APCmin/+ mouse intestine, in which β-catenin levels are very high. Taken together these data reveal a link between eIF6 and Wnt signaling, perhaps at the level of ribosome recycling on β-catenin mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1981038093,"The relationship between neuronal acuity and behavioral performance was assessed in the barn owl (Tyto alba), a nocturnal raptor renowned for its ability to localize sounds and for the topographic representation of auditory space found in the midbrain. We measured discrimination of sound-source separation using a newly developed procedure involving the habituation and recovery of the pupillary dilation response. The smallest discriminable change of source location was found to be about two times finer in azimuth than in elevation. Recordings from neurons in its midbrain space map revealed that their spatial tuning, like the spatial discrimination behavior, was also better in azimuth than in elevation by a factor of about two. Because the PDR behavioral assay is mediated by the same circuitry whether discrimination is assessed in azimuth or in elevation, this difference in vertical and horizontal acuity is likely to reflect a true difference in sensory resolution, without additional confounding effects of differences in motor performance in the two dimensions. Our results, therefore, are consistent with the hypothesis that the acuity of the midbrain space map determines auditory spatial discrimination."
https://openalex.org/W1981419875,"Protein phosphorylation, mediated by a family of enzymes called cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks), plays a central role in the cell-division cycle of eukaryotes. Phosphorylation by Cdks directs the cell cycle by modifying the function of regulators of key processes such as DNA replication and mitotic progression. Here, we present a novel computational procedure to predict substrates of the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdc28 (Cdk1) in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Currently, most computational phosphorylation site prediction procedures focus solely on local sequence characteristics. In the present procedure, we model Cdk substrates based on both local and global characteristics of the substrates. Thus, we define the local sequence motifs that represent the Cdc28 phosphorylation sites and subsequently model clustering of these motifs within the protein sequences. This restraint reflects the observation that many known Cdk substrates contain multiple clustered phosphorylation sites. The present strategy defines a subset of the proteome that is highly enriched for Cdk substrates, as validated by comparing it to a set of bona fide, published, experimentally characterized Cdk substrates which was to our knowledge, comprehensive at the time of writing. To corroborate our model, we compared its predictions with three experimentally independent Cdk proteomic datasets and found significant overlap. Finally, we directly detected in vivo phosphorylation at Cdk motifs for selected putative substrates using mass spectrometry."
https://openalex.org/W2127066179,"Regulatory genes of the Antp class have been a major factor for the invention and radiation of animal bauplans. One of the most diverse animal phyla are the Cnidaria, which are close to the root of metazoan life and which often appear in two distinct generations and a remarkable variety of body forms. Hox-like genes have been known to be involved in axial patterning in the Cnidaria and have been suspected to play roles in the genetic control of many of the observed bauplan changes. Unfortunately RNAi mediated gene silencing studies have not been satisfactory for marine invertebrate organisms thus far. No direct evidence supporting Hox-like gene induced bauplan changes in cnidarians have been documented as of yet. Herein, we report a protocol for RNAi transfection of marine invertebrates and demonstrate that knock downs of Hox-like genes in Cnidaria create substantial bauplan alterations, including the formation of multiple oral poles (""heads"") by Cnox-2 and Cnox-3 inhibition, deformation of the main body axis by Cnox-5 inhibition and duplication of tentacles by Cnox-1 inhibition. All phenotypes observed in the course of the RNAi studies were identical to those obtained by morpholino antisense oligo experiments and are reminiscent of macroevolutionary bauplan changes. The reported protocol will allow routine RNAi studies in marine invertebrates to be established."

https://openalex.org/W2101540751,"Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variation in single hematopoietic cells, muscle fibers, oocytes, and from tiny amount of tumor tissues and degraded clinical specimens has been reported in many medical publications. External DNA contamination, notoriously difficult to avoid, threatens the integrity of such studies.Employing a phylogenetic approach, we analyzed the geographic origins of mtDNA sequence anomalies observed during multiple studies of mtDNA sequence variation in a total of 7094 single hematopoietic cells. 40 events with irregular mtDNA patterns were detected: eight instances (from seven different haplotypes) could be traced to laboratory personnel; six cases were caused by sample cross-contamination. The sources of the remaining events could not be identified, and the anomalous sequence variation referred to matrilines from East Asia, Africa, or West Eurasia, respectively. These mtDNA sequence anomalies could be best explained by contamination.Using the known world mtDNA phylogeny, we could distinguish the geographic origin of the anomalous mtDNA types, providing some useful information regarding the source of contamination. Our data suggest that routine mtDNA sequence analysis of laboratory personnel is insufficient to identify and eliminate all contaminants. A rate of 0.6% of external contamination in this study, while low, is not negligible: Unrecognized contaminants will be mistaken as evidence of remarkable somatic mutations associated with the development of cancer and other diseases. The effective contamination rate can increase by a factor of more than an order of magnitude in some studies that did not institute high standards. Our results are of particular relevance to mtDNA research in medicine, and such an approach should be adopted to maintain and improve quality control in single-cell analyses."
https://openalex.org/W2145599614,"Background Interstitial fibroblasts are a minor, but nevertheless very important, component of the kidney. They secrete and remodel extracellular matrix and they produce active compounds such as erythropoietin. However, studying human renal fibroblasts has been hampered by the lack of appropriate surface markers. Methods and Findings The expression of cadherin-9 in various human renal cell lines and tissues was studied on the mRNA level by RT-PCR and on the protein level with the help of newly generated cadherin-9 antibodies. The classical type II cadherin-9, so far only described in the neural system, was identified as a reliable surface marker for renal fibroblasts. Compared to FSP1, a widely-used cytosolic renal fibroblast marker, cadherin-9 showed a more restricted expression pattern in human kidney. Under pathological conditions, cadherin-9 was expressed in the stroma of renal cell carcinoma, but not in the tumor cells themselves, and in renal fibrosis the percentage of cadherin-9-positive cells was clearly elevated 3 to 5 times compared to healthy kidney tissue. Induction of epithelial mesenchymal transition in renal epithelial cells with cyclosporin-A, which causes renal fibrosis as a side effect, induced cadherin-9 expression. Functional studies following siRNA-mediated knockdown of cadherin-9 revealed that it acts in the kidney like a typical classical cadherin. It was found to be associated with catenins and to mediate homophilic but not heterophilic cell interactions. Conclusions Cadherin-9 represents a novel and reliable cell surface marker for fibroblasts in healthy and diseased kidneys. Together with the established marker molecules FSP1, CD45 and α smooth muscle actin, cadherin-9 can now be used to differentiate the heterogenic pool of renal fibroblasts into resident and activated fibroblasts, immigrated bone marrow derived fibroblast precursors and cells in different stages of epithelial mesenchymal transition."
https://openalex.org/W1963782107,"The systematic comparison of transcriptional responses of organisms is a powerful tool in functional genomics. For example, mutants may be characterized by comparing their transcript profiles to those obtained in other experiments querying the effects on gene expression of many experimental factors including treatments, mutations and pathogen infections. Similarly, drugs may be discovered by the relationship between the transcript profiles effectuated or impacted by a candidate drug and by the target disease. The integration of such data enables systems biology to predict the interplay between experimental factors affecting a biological system. Unfortunately, direct comparisons of gene expression profiles obtained in independent, publicly available microarray experiments are typically compromised by substantial, experiment-specific biases. Here we suggest a novel yet conceptually simple approach for deriving ‘Functional Association(s) by Response Overlap’ (FARO) between microarray gene expression studies. The transcriptional response is defined by the set of differentially expressed genes independent from the magnitude or direction of the change. This approach overcomes the limited comparability between studies that is typical for methods that rely on correlation in gene expression. We apply FARO to a compendium of 242 diverse Arabidopsis microarray experimental factors, including phyto-hormones, stresses and pathogens, growth conditions/stages, tissue types and mutants. We also use FARO to confirm and further delineate the functions of Arabidopsis MAP kinase 4 in disease and stress responses. Furthermore, we find that a large, well-defined set of genes responds in opposing directions to different stress conditions and predict the effects of different stress combinations. This demonstrates the usefulness of our approach for exploiting public microarray data to derive biologically meaningful associations between experimental factors. Finally, our results indicate that FARO is more powerful in associating mutants in common pathways than existing methods such as co-expression analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2019177947,"Background Olfactory receptors (ORs) are the largest gene family in mammalian genomes. Since nearly all OR genes are orphan receptors, inference of functional similarity or differences between odorant receptors typically relies on sequence comparisons. Based on the alignment of entire coding region sequence, OR genes are classified into families and subfamilies, a classification that is believed to be a proxy for OR gene functional variability. However, the assumption that overall protein sequence diversity is a good proxy for functional properties is untested. Methodology Here, we propose an alternative sequence-based approach to infer the similarities and differences in OR binding capacity. Our approach is based on similarities and differences in the predicted binding pockets of OR genes, rather than on the entire OR coding region. Conclusions Interestingly, our approach yields markedly different results compared to the analysis based on the entire OR coding-regions. While neither approach can be tested at this time, the discrepancy between the two calls into question the assumption that the current classification reliably reflects OR gene functional variability."
https://openalex.org/W1995991411,"The molecular and functional diversity of G protein–coupled receptors is essential to many physiological processes. However, this diversity presents a significant challenge to understanding the G protein–mediated signaling events that underlie a specific physiological response. To increase our understanding of these processes, we sought to gain control of the timing and specificity of Gs signaling in vivo. We used naturally occurring human mutations to develop two Gs-coupled engineered receptors that respond solely to a synthetic ligand (RASSLs). Our Gs-coupled RASSLs are based on the melanocortin-4 receptor, a centrally expressed receptor that plays an important role in the regulation of body weight. These RASSLs are not activated by the endogenous hormone α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone but respond potently to a selective synthetic ligand, tetrahydroisoquinoline. The RASSL variants reported here differ in their intrinsic basal activities, allowing the separation of the effects of basal signaling from ligand-mediated activation of the Gs pathway in vivo. These RASSLs can be used to activate Gs signaling in any tissue, but would be particularly useful for analyzing downstream events that mediate body weight regulation in mice. Our study also demonstrates the use of human genetic variation for protein engineering."
https://openalex.org/W2037485643,"Photosystem II (PSII) catalyzes the oxidation of water during oxygenic photosynthesis. PSII is composed both of intrinsic subunits, such as D1, D2, and CP47, and extrinsic subunits, such as the manganese-stabilizing subunit (MSP). Previous work has shown that amines covalently bind to amino acid residues in the CP47, D1, and D2 subunits of plant and cyanobacterial PSII, and that these covalent reactions are prevented by the addition of chloride in plant preparations depleted of the 18- and 24-kDa extrinsic subunits. It has been proposed that these reactive groups are carbonyl-containing, post-translationally modified amino acid side chains (Ouellette, A. J. A., Anderson, L. B., and Barry, B. A. (1998) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 95, 2204–2209 and Anderson, L. B., Ouellette, A. J. A., and Barry, B. A. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 4920–4927). To identify the amino acid binding site in the spinach D2 subunit, we have employed a biotin-amine labeling reagent, which can be used in conjunction with avidin affinity chromatography to purify biotinylated peptides from the PSII complex. Multidimensional chromato-graphic separation and multistage mass spectrometry localizes a novel post-translational modification in the D2 subunit to glutamate 303. We propose that this glutamate is activated for amine reaction by post-translational modification. Because the modified glutamate is located at a contact site between the D2 and manganese-stabilizing subunits, we suggest that the modification is important in vivo in stabilizing the interaction between these two PSII subunits. Consistent with this conclusion, mutations at the modified glutamate alter the steady-state rate of photosynthetic oxygen evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2030056917,"Background We aimed to examine the association between obstetrician assessment of maternal physical health at the time of pregnancy and offspring cardiovascular disease risk. Methods and Principal Findings We examined this association in a birth cohort of 11,106 individuals, with 245,000 person years of follow-up. We were concerned that any associations might be explained by residual confounding, particularly by family socioeconomic position. In order to explore this we used multivariable regression models in which we adjusted for a range of indicators of socioeconomic position and we explored the specificity of the association. Specificity of association was explored by examining associations with other health related outcomes. Maternal physical health was associated with cardiovascular disease: adjusted (socioeconomic position, complications of pregnancy, birthweight and childhood growth at mean age 5) hazard ratio comparing those described as having poor or very poor health at the time of pregnancy to those with good or very good health was 1.55 (95%CI: 1.05, 2.28) for coronary heart disease, 1.91 (95%CI: 0.99, 3.67) for stroke and 1.57 (95%CI: 1.13, 2.18) for either coronary heart disease or stroke. However, this association was not specific. There were strong associations for other outcomes that are known to be related to socioeconomic position (3.61 (95%CI: 1.04, 12.55) for lung cancer and 1.28 (95%CI:1.03, 1.58) for unintentional injury), but not for breast cancer (1.10 (95%CI:0.48, 2.53)). Conclusions and Significance These findings demonstrate that a simple assessment of physical health (based on the appearance of eyes, skin, hair and teeth) of mothers at the time of pregnancy is a strong indicator of the future health risk of their offspring for common conditions that are associated with poor socioeconomic position and unhealthy behaviours. They do not support a specific biological link between maternal health across her life course and future risk of cardiovascular disease in her offspring."
