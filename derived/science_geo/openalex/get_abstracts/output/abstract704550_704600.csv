https://openalex.org/W4309438501,"Congenital Zika virus (ZIKV) infection results in neurodevelopmental deficits in up to 14% of infants born to ZIKV-infected mothers. Neutralizing antibodies are a critical component of protective immunity. Here, we demonstrate that plasma IgM contributes to ZIKV immunity in pregnancy, mediating neutralization up to 3 months post-symptoms. From a ZIKV-infected pregnant woman, we isolated a pentameric ZIKV-specific IgM (DH1017.IgM) that exhibited ultrapotent ZIKV neutralization dependent on the IgM isotype. DH1017.IgM targets an envelope dimer epitope within domain II. The epitope arrangement on the virion is compatible with concurrent engagement of all ten antigen-binding sites of DH1017.IgM, a solution not available to IgG. DH1017.IgM protected mice against viremia upon lethal ZIKV challenge more efficiently than when expressed as an IgG. Our findings identify a role for antibodies of the IgM isotype in protection against ZIKV and posit DH1017.IgM as a safe and effective candidate immunotherapeutic, particularly during pregnancy."

Herein, kinetics of IgG and IgA levels against trimeric-Spike (S) and Receptor-Binding-Domain (RBD) were evaluated by in-house ELISAs in 146 two-dose vaccinated Greek healthcare workers (HCWs) in a 9-month period at six time points (up to 270 days after the first dose). The effect of a homologous booster third dose was also studied and evaluated. The peak of immune response was observed 21 days after the second dose; 100% seroconversion rate for anti-S and anti-RBD IgG, and 99.7% and 96.3% respectively for IgA. IgG antibody levels displayed higher increase compared to IgA. Declining but persistent anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels were detected 9 months after vaccination; IgG and IgA anti-S levels approached those after the first dose, while a more rapid reduction rate for anti-RBD antibodies led to significantly lower levels for both classes, supporting the need for a booster dose. Indeed, a homologous booster third dose resulted in enhanced levels of anti-S of both classes, whereas anti-RBD didn't exceed the peak levels after the second dose. Previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, flu vaccination, BMI<35 and the occurrence of an adverse event upon vaccination, were associated with higher IgG antibody levels over time, which however were negatively affected by age increase and the presence of chronic diseases. Overall, after concurrently using the S and RBD target-antigens in in-house ELISAs, we report in addition to IgG, long-term persistence of IgA antibodies. Regarding antibody levels, homologous mRNA vaccination gives rise to an effective anti-viral protection up to 9 months negatively correlated to age. Considering that COVID-19 is still a matter of public concern, booster vaccine doses remain critical to vulnerable individuals."

While we have an understanding of how antigens bind to MR1 and upregulate MR1 cell surface expression, a quantitative, cell-free, assessment of MR1 ligand-binding affinity was lacking. Here, we developed a fluorescence polarization-based assay in which fluorescent MR1 ligand was loaded into MR1 protein in vitro and competitively displaced by candidate ligands over a range of concentrations. Using this assay, ligand affinity for MR1 could be differentiated as strong (IC50 < 1 μM), moderate (1 μM < IC50 < 100 μM), and weak (IC50 > 100 μM). We demonstrated a clear correlation between ligand-binding affinity for MR1, the presence of a covalent bond between MR1 and ligand, and the number of salt bridge and hydrogen bonds formed between MR1 and ligand. Using this newly developed fluorescence polarization-based assay to screen for candidate ligands, we identified the dietary molecules vanillin and ethylvanillin as weak bona fide MR1 ligands. Both upregulated MR1 on the surface of C1R.MR1 cells and the crystal structure of a MAIT cell T cell receptor-MR1-ethylvanillin complex revealed that ethylvanillin formed a Schiff base with K43 of MR1 and was buried within the A'-pocket. Collectively, we developed and validated a method to quantitate the binding affinities of ligands for MR1 that will enable an efficient and rapid screening of candidate MR1 ligands."
https://openalex.org/W4309656707,"The human papillomavirus vaccine is one of the main preventative measures for cervical cancer. However, global vaccine uptake is low; the problem is particularly acute in low and middle-income countries. The purpose of this study is to assess female preparatory school students' knowledge, attitude, and uptake of the human papillomavirus vaccine and associated factors in Bahir Dar City, Ethiopia.Institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 633 female preparatory school students in Bahir Dar city from March 1-30, 2021. Participants were selected using the multistage sampling technique. Data were collected using a structured self-administered questionnaire and entered into Epi-data and exported to SPSS for analysis. Binary and multivariable logistic regression analyses were done using an odds ratio with a 95% confidence interval. Finally-value < 0.05 was considered significant in multivariable analysis.The proportion of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine uptake, knowledge of the vaccine, and respondents' attitudes toward the vaccine were 45.3% (95% CI = 41.6-49.4%), 58.1% (95% CI = 54.4-61.9%), and 16% (95% CI = 13.2-19.5%), respectively. Having a history of sexual contact AOR = 2.80 (95% CI = 1.64-4.76), hearing about HPV infection AOR = 1.59 (95% CI = 1.13-2.24), and having a positive attitude toward HPV vaccine AOR = 1.46 (95% CI = 1.03-2.08) were significantly associated with knowledge about the HPV vaccine. Discussion of reproductive health issues with family AOR = 2.558 (95%CI = 1.800-3.636), and having good knowledge about HPV vaccine AOR = 3.571(95%CI = 2.494-5.113) were associated with a positive attitude toward the HPV vaccine. Good knowledge AOR = 2.36(95%CI = 1.48-3.76) and a positive attitude toward HPV vaccine AOR = 2.87(95%CI = 1.70-4.85) were strongly associated with HPV vaccine utilization.In this study, there was a very low uptake of HPV vaccination among female students, and only a small proportion of them had good knowledge of the HPV vaccine and a favorable attitude toward the HPV vaccine."
https://openalex.org/W4309353194,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive, neurodegenerative disorder characterised by the abnormal accumulation of α-synuclein (α-syn) aggregates. Central to disease progression is the gradual spread of pathological α-syn. α-syn aggregation is closely linked to progressive neuron loss. As such, clearance of α-syn aggregates may slow the progression of PD and lead to less severe symptoms. Evidence is increasing that non-neuronal cells play a role in PD and other synucleinopathies such as Lewy body dementia and multiple system atrophy. Our previous work has shown that pericytes-vascular mural cells that regulate the blood-brain barrier-contain α-syn aggregates in human PD brains. Here, we demonstrate that pericytes efficiently internalise fibrillar α-syn irrespective of being in a monoculture or mixed neuronal cell culture. Pericytes cleave fibrillar α-syn aggregates (Fibrils, Ribbons, fibrils65, fibrils91 and fibrils110), with cleaved α-syn remaining present for up to 21 days. The number of α-syn aggregates/cell and average aggregate size depends on the type of strain, but differences disappear within 5 five hours of treatment. Our results highlight the role brain vasculature may play in reducing α-syn aggregate burden in PD."
https://openalex.org/W4309423669,"Despite women being disproportionally affected by cancer deaths at young ages, there are no global estimates of the resulting maternal orphans, who experience health and education disadvantages throughout their lives. We estimated the number of children who became maternal orphans in 2020 due to their mother dying from cancer in that year, for 185 countries worldwide and by cause of cancer-related death. Female cancer deaths-by country, cancer type and age (derived from GLOBOCAN estimates)-were multiplied by each woman's estimated number of children under the age of 18 years at the time of her death (fertility data were derived from United Nations World Population Prospects for birth cohort), accounting for child mortality and parity-cancer risk associations. Globally, there were 1,047,000 such orphans. Over half of these were orphans due to maternal deaths from breast (258,000, 25%), cervix (210,000, 20%) and upper-gastrointestinal cancers (136,000, 13%), and most occurred in Asia (48%: India 15%, China 10%, rest of Asia 23%) and Africa (35%). Globally, there were 40 new maternal orphans due to cancer per 100,000 children, with a declining trend with a higher Human Development Index (range: 121 in Malawi to 15 in Malta). An estimated 7 million children were prevalent maternal orphans due to cancer in mid-2020. Accelerating the implementation of the World Health Organization's cervical and breast cancer initiatives has the potential to avert not only millions of preventable female cancer deaths but also the associated, often-overlooked, intergenerational consequences of these deaths."

https://openalex.org/W4309495328,"Antimicrobial resistance against shigellosis is increasingly alarming. However, evidence-based knowledge gaps regarding the changing trends of shigellosis in Bangladesh exist due to the scarcity of longitudinal data on antimicrobial resistance. Our study evaluated the last 20 years antimicrobial resistance patterns against shigellosis among under-5 children in the urban and rural sites of Bangladesh. Data were extracted from the Diarrheal Disease Surveillance System (DDSS) of Dhaka Hospital (urban site) and Matlab Hospital (rural site) of the International Centre for Diarrheal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b) between January 2001 and December 2020. We studied culture-confirmed shigellosis cases from urban Dhaka Hospital (n = 883) and rural Matlab Hospital (n = 1263). Since 2001, a declining percentage of shigellosis in children observed in urban and rural sites. Moreover, higher isolation rates of Shigella were found in the rural site [1263/15684 (8.1%)] compared to the urban site [883/26804 (3.3%)] in the last 20 years. In both areas, S. flexneri was the predominant species. The upward trend of S. sonnei in both the study sites was statistically significant after adjusting for age and sex. WHO-recommended 1st line antibiotic ciprofloxacin resistance gradually reached more than 70% in both the urban and rural site by 2020. In multiple logistic regression after adjusting for age and sex, ciprofloxacin, azithromycin, mecillinam, ceftriaxone, and multidrug resistance (resistance to any two of these four drugs) among under-5 children were found to be increasing significantly (p<0.01) in the last 20 years in both sites. The study results underscore the importance of therapeutic interventions for shigellosis by appropriate drugs based on their current antibiogram for under-5 children. These observations may help policymakers in formulating better case management strategies for shigellosis."
https://openalex.org/W4309508585,"The NLRP3 inflammasome is a critical component of innate immunity that defends the host from microbial infections. However, its aberrant activation contributes to the pathogenesis of several inflammatory diseases. Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome induces the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18 and pyroptotic cell death. NLRP3 contains a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain at its C terminus. Although posttranslational modifications in this LRR domain have been shown to regulate NLRP3 inflammasome activation, the role of the entire LRR domain in NLRP3 inflammasome activation remains controversial. Here, we generated mouse macrophages that express an endogenous NLRP3 mutant lacking the LRR domain. Deletion of the LRR domain diminished NLRP3 inflammasome activation in macrophages. Furthermore, using NLRP3-deficient macrophages that are reconstituted with NLRP3 mutants lacking the LRR domain, we found that deletion of the LRR domain inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Mechanistically, deletion of the LRR domain inhibited NLRP3 self-association, oligomerization, and interaction with the essential regulator NEK7.

Inflammasomes are cytoplasmic multiprotein complexes that form in response to microbial infection or cell damage (1Schroder K. Tschopp J. The inflammasomes.Cell. 2010; 140: 821-832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4360) Google Scholar). In most cases, an inflammasome contains a pattern recognition receptor as the sensor, the adaptor protein apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase-activation and recruitment domain (ASC), and the inflammatory caspase-1 (2Broz P. Dixit V.M. Inflammasomes: mechanism of assembly, regulation and signalling.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2016; 16: 407-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (1907) Google Scholar, 3Rathinam V.A. Vanaja S.K. Fitzgerald K.A. Regulation of inflammasome signaling.Nat. Immunol. 2012; 13: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). Inflammasome assembly results in caspase-1 autocleavage and activation. Activated caspase-1 processes the proinflammatory cytokines pro-interleukin (IL)-1β and pro-IL-18 into their mature forms and cleaves gasdermin D (GSDMD) to release its active N terminus, which forms pores in the plasma membrane to induce cytokine release and pyroptotic cell death (4Martinon F.

To date, six inflammasomes have been well documented, including the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain–like receptor (NLR) family members NLRP1, NLRP3, NLRP6, NLRC4, pyrin, and absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) inflammasomes (2Broz P.

The cell biology of inflammasomes: mechanisms of inflammasome activation and regulation.J. Cell Biol. 2016; 213: 617-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Among these inflammasomes, the NLRP3 inflammasome has been intensively investigated due to its protective role in host defense against various infections as well as its pathogenic role in several inflammatory disorders (8Anand P.K. Malireddi R.K. Kanneganti T.D. Role of the nlrp3 inflammasome in microbial infection.Front Microbiol. 2011; 2: 12Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 9Guo H. Callaway J.B. Ting J.P. Inflammasomes: mechanism of action, role in disease, and therapeutics.Nat. Med. 2015; 21: 677-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (2117) Google Scholar). The mechanism underlying NLRP3 inflammasome activation remains not fully understood. A diverse spectrum of stimuli, including ATP, pore-forming toxin (e.g., nigericin), and particulate matter (e.g., monosodium urate crystals, amyloids, and silica), has been shown to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome (10Sutterwala F.S.

The NLRP3 inflammasome: molecular activation and regulation to therapeutics.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2019; 19: 477-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (2029) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is unlikely that NLRP3 directly recognizes these stimuli. Instead, molecular or cellular signal events downstream of these stimuli, such as altered intracellular ion homeostasis, mitochondrial dysfunction, reactive oxygen species production, and lysosomal damage, have been proposed to trigger NLRP3 inflammasome activation (10Sutterwala F.S.

Most NLRP3 stimuli trigger potassium efflux, which has been considered a critical signal for NLRP3 inflammasome activation (13Munoz-Planillo R. Kuffa P. Martinez-Colon G. Smith B.L. Rajendiran T.M.

However, how NLRP3 senses the drop in intracellular potassium concentration remains unknown. Furthermore, several NLRP3-interacting proteins, including heat-shock protein 90 (HSP90), SGT1, TXNIP, NEK7, DDX3X, and RACK1, have been shown to regulate NLRP3 inflammasome activation (15Mayor A.

However, the molecular mechanism of these regulators remains to be further defined. NLRP3 consists of three domains: an N-terminal pyrin domain (PYD), a central NAIP, CIITA, HET-E, and TP1 (NACHT) domain, and a C-terminal leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain (21Wang L. Sharif H.

NLRP3 interacts with the adaptor protein ASC through PYD-PYD interactions to induce the formation of filamentous aggregates known as ASC specks (22Fernandes-Alnemri T. Wu J. Yu J.W. Datta P.

The NACHT domain has an adenosine triphosphatase activity required for NLRP3 conformational change and oligomerization (24Duncan J.A. Bergstralht D.T. Wang Y.H. Willingham S.B. Ye Z.M. Zimmermann A.G. et al.Cryopyrin/NALP3 binds ATP/dATP, is an ATPase, and requires ATP binding to mediate inflammatory signaling.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

ATP-binding and Hydrolysis in inflammasome activation.Molecules. 2020; 25: 4572Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In contrast, the role of the LRR domain in NLRP3 inflammasome activation is more complex. Earlier studies have suggested that the LRR domain has an autoinhibitory function through intramolecular interactions (26Dowds T.A. Masumoto J. Zhu L. Inohara N. Nunez G.

Chem. 2004; 279: 21924-21928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Recently, several posttranslational modifications, including phosphorylation and ubiquitination, have been found in the LRR domain to regulate NLRP3 inflammasome activation (27Py B.F. Kim M.S.

However, there are conflicting reports on whether the entire LRR domain plays a role in NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Some studies have shown that the replacement of the LRR domain by the LacZ protein or its deletion abolished NLRP3 inflammasome activation (31Hoffman H.M. Scott P. Mueller J.L. Misaghi A. Stevens S.

Furthermore, structural studies have shown that the LRR domain mediated the NLRP3-NEK7 interaction and the formation of the NLRP3 cage structure, which disperses the trans-Golgi network at the early stage of the inflammasome pathway (33Sharif H. Wang L. Wang W.L. Magupalli V.G. Andreeva L.

However, others have shown that the LRR domain is dispensable for NLRP3 inflammasome activation (35Hafner-Bratkovic I. Susjan P. Lainscek D. Tapia-Abellan A. Cerovic K.

In this study, we have used mouse knock-in (KI) macrophages that express an endogenous NLRP3 mutant lacking the LRR domain and NLRP3-deficient macrophages that are reconstituted with NLRP3 mutants lacking the LRR domain. Our results demonstrate that the LRR domain is required for NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Furthermore, our results show that the LRR domain mediates NLRP3 self-association, oligomerization, and interaction with its essential regulator NEK7. Previous studies showed conflicting results on the role of the LRR domain in NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Notably, most of these studies overexpressed NLRP3 mutants lacking the LRR domain by transfection or viral infection or replaced the LRR domain of the endogenous NLRP3 protein with a large LacZ protein, which may interfere with NLRP3 function (31Hoffman H.M.

An NLRP3 mutant [NLRP3(1–720)] was chosen as it lacks the entire LRR domain and has been reported to fully restore NLRP3 inflammasome activation in NLRP3-deficient mouse macrophages (Fig. 1A) (35Hafner-Bratkovic I. Susjan P. Lainscek D. Tapia-Abellan A. Cerovic K. Kadunc L. et al.NLRP3 lacking the leucine-rich repeat domain can be fully activated via the canonical inflammasome pathway.Nat. Commun. 2018; 9: 5182Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We selected three KI macrophage clones (Nlrp3C721Stop/C721Stop) in which a stop codon (TGA) has successfully replaced the cysteine (C721) codon (TGC) at the coding region of mouse Nlrp3 gene (Fig. 1B). These KI macrophages are expected to express an NLRP3 mutant that consists of the first 720 amino acid residues and lacks the entire LRR domain. We assessed the protein expression of endogenous NLRP3 protein from both wildtype (parent cells) and KI macrophages by Western blot. An antibody that recognized an epitope in the N-terminal pyrin domain of NLRP3 protein (Cryo-2) was used to detect both full-length and truncation mutant NLRP3 from these macrophages. In addition, macrophages derived from Nlrp3−/− mice were included as controls in our experiments. The full-length NLRP3 (∼118 kDa) was detected in wildtype macrophages at the resting state (Fig. 1C). As expected, all three KI macrophage clones expressed the short version of NLRP3 protein (∼79 kDa), further confirming our sequencing results (Fig. 1C). Of note, no protein band appeared in the lane for Nlrp3−/− macrophages, indicating the specificity of our antibody (Fig. 1C). Importantly, the detected protein level of this NLRP3 mutant from each clone was markedly lower (less than 50%) when compared with that of full-length NLRP3 expressed in wildtype macrophages (Fig. 1C). Additionally, the mRNA levels of this NLRP3 mutant in KI macrophages were also lower than those of the full-length NLRP3 in wildtype macrophages (Fig. S1A). However, the expression levels of other NLRP3 inflammasome components, including caspase-1, NEK7, and ASC, were comparable between wildtype and KI macrophages (Fig. 1C). Next, we assessed NLRP3 inflammasome activation in these macrophages under the conditions of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) priming or LPS priming plus nigericin treatment. Previous studies have suggested that the LRR domain keeps an inactive conformation of NLRP3 through intramolecular interaction (26Dowds T.A. Masumoto J. Zhu L. Inohara N. Nunez G. Cryopyrin-induced interleukin 1beta secretion in monocytic cells: enhanced activity of disease-associated mutants and requirement for ASC.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21924-21928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Similar to wild-type macrophages, KI macrophages did not exhibit caspase-1 activation, GSDMD cleavage, or IL-1β secretion after LPS priming (Fig. 1, D and E). Nigericin, a classic NLRP3 stimulus, induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation in wildtype macrophages, as revealed by caspase-1 activation, GSDMD cleavage, and IL-1β secretion (Fig. 1, D and E). In contrast, KI macrophages, similar to NLRP3-deficient macrophages, were defective in NLRP3 inflammasome activation after LPS priming plus nigericin treatment (Fig. 1, D and E). The secretion of TNF-α, an inflammasome-independent cytokine, was comparable among these macrophages (Fig. 1F). Collectively, these results indicate that the LRR domain is required for nigericin-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation in macrophages. NLRP3 inflammasome activation is induced by potassium efflux-dependent (e.g., ATP, nigericin, Nano-SiO2) or independent stimuli (e.g., imiquimod) (11Kelley N. Jeltema D. Duan Y. He Y. The NLRP3 inflammasome: an overview of mechanisms of activation and regulation.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2019; 20: 3328Crossref PubMed Scopus (1447) Google Scholar, 12Swanson K.V. Deng M. Ting J.P. The NLRP3 inflammasome: molecular activation and regulation to therapeutics.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2019; 19: 477-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (2029) Google Scholar). Given our data showing that KI macrophages were defective in nigericin-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation, we next examined whether this defect was common to other NLRP3 stimuli. As they secreted a similar level of TNF-α after LPS priming, the KI macrophage clone KI-C2 (KI henceforth) and wildtype macrophages were used for the following experiments (Fig. 1F). Macrophages were stimulated with ATP, nigericin, Nano-SiO2, or imiquimod after LPS priming. KI macrophages showed markedly reduced caspase-1 activation, GSDMD cleavage, and IL-1β secretion when compared to wildtype macrophages (Fig. 2, A and B). In contrast, KI macrophages had comparable AIM2 inflammasome activation induced by poly(dA:dT) or NLRC4 inflammasome activation by Salmonella when compared to wildtype macrophages (Fig. 2, A and B). Inflammasome activation induces the formation of ASC aggregates called ASC specks, which are composed of ASC oligomers in the cytosol (22Fernandes-Alnemri T. Wu J. Yu J.W. Datta P. Miller B. Jankowski W. et al.The pyroptosome: A supramolecular assembly of ASC dimers mediating inflammatory cell death via caspase-1 activation.Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 1590-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). Both ATP and nigericin induced ASC speck formation in wildtype macrophages, whereas almost no ASC speck was detected in KI macrophages for both stimuli (Fig. 2, C and D). However, KI macrophages had comparable ASC speck formation in response to Salmonella as compared to wildtype macrophages (Fig. 2, C and D). Biochemical analysis revealed that KI macrophages had much less ASC oligomerization as compared to wildtype cells after treatment of ATP or nigericin, although they showed a comparable level of ASC oligomerization in response to Salmonella (Fig. 2E). To exclude whether other nonspecific factors besides this LRR domain deletion in endogenous NLRP3 attributed to the defect of NLRP3 inflammasome activation observed in KI macrophages, we expressed C-terminal HA-tagged NLRP3 full-length [NLRP3(FL)], LRR deletion mutant [NLRP3(1–720)], or the LRR domain [NLRP3(730–1033)] in KI macrophages by a lentiviral vector. Macrophage clones that expressed higher levels of the LRR deletion mutant protein than those of full-length NLRP3, indicated by anti-HA immunoblots, were selected for assessing nigericin-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation (Fig. 2F). Expression of full-length NLRP3 restored NLRP3 inflammasome activation, indicated by caspase-1 activation and IL-1β secretion, in KI macrophages, while both the LRR deletion mutant and LRR domain alone failed to rescue NLRP3 inflammasome activation (Fig. 2, F and G). Taken together, these results indicated that the LRR domain is required for NLRP3 inflammasome activation in macrophages. Several LRR domain-lacking mutants of NLRP3, including NLRP3 1–686 and 1–720, have been reported to fully restored inflammasome activation in mouse NLRP3-deficient macrophages (35Hafner-Bratkovic I. Susjan P. Lainscek D. Tapia-Abellan A. Cerovic K. Kadunc L. et al.NLRP3 lacking the leucine-rich repeat domain can be fully activated via the canonical inflammasome pathway.Nat. Commun. 2018; 9: 5182Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). As shown in our data, the protein level of endogenously expressed protein NLRP3(1–720) in KI macrophages was lower than that of the full-length NLRP3 in macrophages. As a complementary approach, we constitutively expressed SFP (S-tag, Flag, and streptavidin-binding tag)-tagged full-length NLRP3, NLRP3 mutant 1–686, or 1–720 in mouse NLRP3-deficient macrophages and selected macrophage clones that expressed comparable protein levels of NLRP3 (Fig. 3A). In contrast to the previous study in which macrophages were primed with LPS for 11 h in the presence of doxycycline, we primed reconstituted macrophages with LPS for 4 h before stimulation with ATP, nigericin, nano-SiO2, or imiquimod (35Hafner-Bratkovic I. Susjan P. Lainscek D. Tapia-Abellan A. Cerovic K. Kadunc L. et al.NLRP3 lacking the leucine-rich repeat domain can be fully activated via the canonical inflammasome pathway.Nat. Commun. 2018; 9: 5182Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Consistent with our results from KI macrophages, macrophages reconstituted with NLRP3 mutant 1–686 or 1–720 showed a significant reduction in caspase-1 activation, GSDMD cleavage, and IL-1β secretion when compared to macrophages with full-length NLRP3 (Fig. 3, A and B). The levels of TNF-α secretion were comparable between macrophages reconstituted with wildtype or mutant NLRP3 under the same conditions (Fig. 3C). Accordingly, macrophages reconstituted with NLRP3 mutant 1–686 or 1–720 had less ASC oligomerization in response to ATP or nigericin when compared to macrophages with full-length NLRP3 (Fig. 3D). Furthermore, NLRP3-deficient macrophages that expressed an untagged NLRP3 mutant 1–720 through a constitutive or doxycycline-inducible system also failed to restore caspase-1 activation after nigericin stimulation (Fig. S1, B and C). Taken together, these results further indicated that the LRR domain is also essential for NLRP3 inflammasome activation in reconstituted NLRP3-deficient macrophages. Recent structural studies with purified NLRP3 oligomers have revealed that NLRP3 self-associates through the LRR-LRR interaction (34Andreeva L. David L. Rawson S. Shen C. Pasricha T.

To investigate how the LRR domain controls NLRP3 inflammasome activation, we assessed the effects of the LRR domain deletion on NLRP3 self-association and oligomerization in cells. We co-expressed SFP or HA-tagged full-length or NLRP3 mutants in HEK 293T cells. The full-length NLRP3 showed self-association as SFP-tagged NLRP3 pulled down HA-tagged NLRP3. In contrast, self-association for both NLRP3 mutants 1–686 and 1–720 was markedly reduced (Fig. 4A). In macrophages, after stimulation of NLRP3 stimuli, NLRP3 forms high-molecular-mass complexes, as indicated by protein native gels (17He Y. Zeng M.Y. Yang D. Motro B. Nunez G. NEK7 is an essential mediator of NLRP3 activation downstream of potassium efflux.Nature. 2016; 530: 354-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). We compared these high-molecular-mass forms of NLRP3 in cells reconstituted with full-length or the LRR deletion mutant. Macrophages reconstituted with the full-length NLRP3 displayed the high-molecular-mass NLRP3 complexes (>1200 kDa) after stimulation of ATP and nigericin. In contrast, these high-molecular-mass forms of NLRP3 were markedly reduced in macrophages reconstituted with NLRP3 truncation mutant 1–686 or 1–720 (Fig. 4B). Accordingly, in 2-D native gels, these high-molecular-mass forms of NLRP3 proteins were markedly reduced in macrophages reconstituted with NLRP3 mutant 1–686 or 1–720 as compared with the full-length NLRP3 (Fig. 4C). Taken together, our results indicate that the LRR domain mediates NLRP3 self-association and oligomerization. Previous studies have shown that the LRR domain in NLRP3 is required for the NEK7-NLRP3 interaction in HEK 293T cells (17He Y. Zeng M.Y. Yang D. Motro B. Nunez G.

Fina M. et al.NLRP3 activation and mitosis are mutually exclusive events coordinated by NEK7, a new inflammasome component.Nat Immunol. 2015; 17: 250-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a structural study of the NEK7-NLRP3 complex has shown that NEK7 interacts with the LRR domain of NLRP3 (33Sharif H. Wang L. Wang W.L. Magupalli V.G. Andreeva L. Qiao Q. et al.Structural mechanism for NEK7-licensed activation of NLRP3 inflammasome.Nature. 2019; 570: 338-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, NLRP3 mutants lacking the LRR domain including 1–686 were reported to pull down NEK7 in macrophages (35Hafner-Bratkovic I. Susjan P. Lainscek D. Tapia-Abellan A. Cerovic K. Kadunc L. et al.NLRP3 lacking the leucine-rich repeat domain can be fully activated via the canonical inflammasome pathway.Nat. Commun. 2018; 9: 5182Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether the LRR domain is required for NLRP3-NEK7 interaction in our reconstituted macrophages. Both NLRP3 mutants 1–686 and 1–720 failed to pull down NEK7 from macrophages stimulated with LPS or LPS plus ATP (Fig. 5A). The NLRP3 mutant 1–720 or the LRR domain alone also failed to pull down NEK7 from HEK 293T cells (Fig. 5B). According to the Uniprot/Swiss-Prot, there a"

Phylogenetically, the red algal GH16 members are closely related to bacterial GH16 homologs from subfamilies 13 and 14, which have characterized marine bacterial β-carrageenase and β-porphyranase activities, respectively, yet the functions of these CcGH16 hydrolases have not been determined. Here, we first confirmed the gene locus of the ccgh16-3 gene in the alga to facilitate further investigation. Next, our biochemical characterization of CcGH16-3 revealed an unexpected β-porphyranase activity, since porphyran is not a known component of the C. crispus extracellular matrix. Kinetic characterization was undertaken on natural porphyran substrate with an experimentally determined molecular weight. We found CcGH16-3 has a pH optimum between 7.5 and 8.0; however, it exhibits reasonably stable activity over a large pH range (pH 7.0-9.0). CcGH16-3 has a KM of 4.0 ± 0.8 μM, a kcat of 79.9 ± 6.9 s-1, and a kcat/KM of 20.1 ± 1.7 μM-1 s-1. We structurally examined fine enzymatic specificity by performing a subsite dissection. CcGH16-3 has a strict requirement for D-galactose and L-galactose-6-sulfate in its -1 and +1 subsites, respectively, whereas the outer subsites are less restrictive. CcGH16-3 is one of a handful of algal enzymes characterized with a specificity for a polysaccharide unknown to be found in their own extracellular matrix. This β-porphyranase activity in a carrageenophyte red alga may provide defense against red algal pathogens or provide a competitive advantage in niche colonization."
https://openalex.org/W4309437587,"Fasting hyperglycemia in diabetes mellitus is caused by unregulated glucagon secretion that activates gluconeogenesis (GNG) and increases the use of pyruvate, lactate, amino acids, and glycerol. Studies of GNG in hepatocytes, however, tend to test a limited number of substrates at nonphysiologic concentrations. Therefore, we treated cultured primary hepatocytes with three identical substrate mixtures of pyruvate/lactate, glutamine, and glycerol at serum fasting concentrations, where a different U-13C- or 2-13C-labeled substrate was substituted in each mix. In the absence of glucagon stimulation, 80% of the glucose produced in primary hepatocytes incorporated either one or two 13C-labeled glycerol molecules in a 1:1 ratio, reflecting the high overall activity of this pathway. In contrast, glucose produced from 13C-labeled pyruvate/lactate or glutamine rarely incorporated two labeled molecules. While glucagon increased the glycerol and pyruvate/lactate contributions to glucose carbon by 1.6- and 1.8-fold, respectively, the glutamine contribution to glucose carbon was increased 6.4-fold in primary hepatocytes. To account for substrate 13C carbon loss during metabolism, we also performed a metabolic flux analysis, which confirmed that the majority of glucose carbon produced by primary hepatocytes was from glycerol. In vivo studies using a PKA-activation mouse model that represents elevated glucagon activity confirmed that most circulating lactate carbons originated from glycerol, but very little glycerol was derived from lactate carbons, reflecting glycerol's importance as a carbon donor to GNG. Given the diverse entry points for GNG substrates, hepatic glucagon action is unlikely to be due to a single mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W4309495367,"Sleep is required to maintain physiological functions and is widely conserved across species. To understand the sleep-regulatory mechanisms, sleep-regulating genes and neuronal circuits are studied in various animal species. In the sleep-regulatory neuronal circuits in Drosophila melanogaster, the dorsal fan-shaped body (dFB) is a major sleep-promoting region. However, other sleep-regulating neuronal circuits were not well identified. We recently found that arousal-promoting T1 dopamine neurons, interneurons of protocerebral bridge (PB) neurons, and PB neurons innervating the ventral part of the FB form a sleep-regulatory circuit, which we named ""the PB-FB pathway"". In the exploration of other sleep-regulatory circuits, we found that activation of FB interneurons, also known as pontine neurons, promoted arousal. We then found that FB interneurons had possible connections with the PB-FB pathway and dFB neurons. Ca2+ imaging revealed that FB interneurons received excitatory signals from the PB-FB pathway. We also demonstrated the possible role of FB interneurons to regulate dFB neurons. These results suggested the role of FB interneurons in sleep regulation."

Dermatol. 2021; 30: 38-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and secondary modifications of Hyl include two successive and coordinated O-glycosylation steps. Hyl is required for subsequent galactose attachment to make galactosyl Hyls, which are further modified by glucose attachment to make glucosyl galactosyl Hyls.

However, detailed quantitative PTM analysis has never been conducted for any type of collagen in the context of LH3 deficiency. Thus, in this study, we used CRISPR-mediated gene editing to knockout LH3 both in PFHR9 cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and performed a multifaceted investigation including cellular biochemistry, structural assessment, and quantitative PTM characterization for collagen α1α1α2(I), α1α1α1(III), and α1α1α2(IV) to elucidate the role of LH3 in the collagen molecular ensemble. Furthermore, since perinatal cerebral hemorrhage is a cardinal feature of Gould syndrome, we performed a genetic screen for PLOD3 variants in a fetal stroke cohort that was negative for COL4A1 and COL4A2 pathogenic variants. To explore the role of LH3 in the molecular ensemble for type IV collagen, we used CRISPR-mediated gene editing to knockout LH3 in PFHR9 cells (Figs. 1A, S1 and S2A). We selected PFHR9 cells because they are well characterized and secrete large amounts of collagen α1α1α2(IV) because of a duplication of the Col4a1/Col4a2 locus (28Basak T. Vega-Montoto L.

However, these prostheses remain quite difficult to control for grasping and manipulation of daily life objects. The aim of the present observational case study is to document the kinematics of grasping in a group of 10 below-elbow amputated patients fitted with a myoelectric prosthesis in order to describe and better understand their compensatory strategies. They performed a grasping to lift task toward 3 objects (a mug, a cylinder and a cone) placed at two distances within the reaching area in front of the patients. The kinematics of the trunk and upper-limb on the non-amputated and prosthetic sides were recorded with 3 electromagnetic Polhemus sensors placed on the hand, the forearm (or the corresponding site on the prosthesis) and the ipsilateral acromion. The 3D position of the elbow joint and the shoulder and elbow angles were calculated thanks to a preliminary calibration of the sensor position. We examined first the effect of side, distance and objects with non-parametric statistics. Prosthetic grasping was characterized by severe temporo-spatial impairments consistent with previous clinical or kinematic observations. The grasping phase was prolonged and the reaching and grasping components uncoupled. The 3D hand displacement was symmetrical in average, but with some differences according to the objects. Compensatory strategies involved the trunk and the proximal part of the upper-limb, as shown by a greater 3D displacement of the elbow for close target and a greater forward displacement of the acromion, particularly for far targets. The hand orientation at the time of grasping showed marked side differences with a more frontal azimuth, and a more ""thumb-up"" roll. The variation of hand orientation with the object on the prosthetic side, suggested that the lack of finger and wrist mobility imposed some adaptation of hand pose relative to the object. The detailed kinematic analysis allows more insight into the mechanisms of the compensatory strategies that could be due to both increased distal or proximal kinematic constraints. A better knowledge of those compensatory strategies is important for the prevention of musculoskeletal disorders and the development of innovative prosthetics."
https://openalex.org/W4309339019,"The Sonic Hedgehog (SHh) precursor protein undergoes biosynthetic autoprocessing to cleave off and covalently attach cholesterol to the SHh signaling ligand, a vital morphogen and oncogenic effector protein. Autoprocessing is self-catalyzed by SHhC, the SHh precursor's C-terminal enzymatic domain. A method to screen for small molecule regulators of this process may be of therapeutic value. Here, we describe the development and validation of the first cellular reporter to monitor human SHhC autoprocessing noninvasively in high-throughput compatible plates. The assay couples intracellular SHhC autoprocessing using endogenous cholesterol to the extracellular secretion of the bioluminescent nanoluciferase enzyme. We developed a WT SHhC reporter line for evaluating potential autoprocessing inhibitors by concentration response-dependent suppression of extracellular bioluminescence. Additionally, a conditional mutant SHhC (D46A) reporter line was developed for identifying potential autoprocessing activators by a concentration response-dependent gain of extracellular bioluminescence. The D46A mutation removes a conserved general base that is critical for the activation of the cholesterol substrate. Inducibility of the D46A reporter was established using a synthetic sterol, 2-α carboxy cholestanol, designed to bypass the defect through intramolecular general base catalysis. To facilitate direct nanoluciferase detection in the cell culture media of 1536-well plates, we designed a novel anionic phosphonylated coelenterazine, CLZ-2P, as the nanoluciferase substrate. This new reporter system offers a long-awaited resource for small molecule discovery for cancer and for developmental disorders where SHh ligand biosynthesis is dysregulated."
https://openalex.org/W4309436460,"Circulation of influenza A virus (IAV), especially within poultry and pigs, continues to threaten public health. A simple and universal detecting method is important for monitoring IAV infection in different species. Recently, nanobodies, which show advantages of easy gene editing and low cost of production, are a promising novel diagnostic tool for the monitoring and control of global IAVs. In the present study, five nanobodies against the nucleoprotein of H9N2 IAV were screened from the immunized Bactrian camel by phage display and modified with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) tags. Out of which, we determined that H9N2-NP-Nb5-HRP can crossreact with different subtypes of IAVs, and this reaction is also blocked by positive sera for antibodies against different IAV subtypes. Epitope mapping showed that the nanobody-HRP fusion recognized a conserved conformational epitope in all subtypes of IAVs. Subsequently, we developed a nanobody-based competitive ELISA (cELISA) for detecting anti-IAV antibodies in different species. The optimized amount of coating antigen and dilutions of the fusion and testing sera were 100 ng/well, 1:4000, and 1:10, respectively. The time for operating the cELISA was approximately 35 min. The cELISA showed high sensitivity, specificity, reproducibility, and stability. In addition, we found that the cELISA and hemagglutination inhibition test showed a consistency of 100% and 87.91% for clinical and challenged chicken sera, respectively. Furthermore, the agreement rates were 90.4% and 85.7% between the cELISA and commercial IEDXX ELISA kit.

Based on the identity of the internal conserved proteins including NP and M1 proteins, the IVs are divided into types A, B, C, and D (6Webster R.G. Bean W.J. Gorman O.T. Chambers T.M. Kawaoka Y.

Rev. 1992; 56: 152-179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), of which, influenza A viruses (IAVs) are further divided into 18 H subtypes (H1–H18) and 11 N subtypes (N1–N11), according to their HA and NA makeup (7Avian influenza (including infection with high pathogenicity avian influenza viruses).

The highly variable IAVs are spread across a wide range of mammalian and avian species, such as humans, pigs, horses, dogs, cats, minks, seals, whales, and domestic and wild birds (4Palese P.

All subtypes of IAVs infect aquatic birds, which provide the genetic diversity required for the spread of IAVs across species (6Webster R.G. Bean W.J. Gorman O.T. Chambers T.M. Kawaoka Y.

Birds and pigs play important roles in global influenza pandemics caused by genomic reassortment and are the key hosts for the spread of influenza across the interspecies barrier (2Wille M.

The evolution of human influenza viruses.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2001; 356: 1861-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Therefore, monitoring the history of IAV immunity and the infection of different susceptible species, especially in birds and pigs, is urgently needed for global IAV surveillance and control (12Abolnik C. Fehrsen J. Olivier A. van Wyngaardt W. Fosgate G. Ellis C.

Virol. 2021; 166: 1113-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Many serologic testing assays have been developed for detecting anti-IAV antibodies in the serum samples. These assays include hemagglutination inhibition (HI), agar gel immunodiffusion, virus neutralization test, immunofluorescence assay (IFA), and ELISA (5Saczynska V. Florys-Jankowska K. Porebska A.

Cheng W. et al.Development and evaluation of a monoclonal antibody-based competitive ELISA for the detection of antibodies against H7 avian influenza virus.BMC Vet.

Of these, ELISA has advantages with high sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and a high throughput and is thus widely used for early diagnosis and screening (12Abolnik C. Fehrsen J. Olivier A. van Wyngaardt W. Fosgate G. Ellis C.

Since surface glycoproteins (HA and NA) of IAVs have a high rate of antigenic variability, it is problematic to develop a universal method for detecting antibodies against different subtypes of IAV using them as antigens (16Yang M. Berhane Y. Salo T. Li M. Hole K. Clavijo A. Development and application of monoclonal antibodies against avian influenza virus nucleoprotein.J. Virol. Met. 2008; 147: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, as we know, the NP is conserved among different subtypes of IAV. In addition, although the percentage of anti-NP antibodies is generally lower than the one of anti-HA antibodies, the antibodies against NP can also be quickly detected after IAV infected hosts. So, the NP was also widely used and one of the most promising diagnostic targets for IAV infection (17Shu L.L. Bean W.J. Webster R.G.

Novel application of Influenza A virus-inoculated chorioallantoic membrane to characterize a NP-specific monoclonal antibody for immunohistochemistry assaying.J. Vet. Sci. 2019; 20: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). There are indirect ELISA (iELISA) and competitive ELISA (cELISA), which use the highly conserved IAV-NP as an antigen to detect antibodies against different subtypes of IAVs in different species (19Hu Y. Sneyd H. Dekant R. Wang J. Influenza A virus nucleoprotein: a highly conserved multi-functional viral protein as a hot antiviral drug target.Curr. Top Med. Chem. 2017; 17: 2271-2285Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, most commercially available ELISA kits were produced based on the enzyme-conjugated second or monoclonal antibody (mAb). As the production of enzyme-labeled antibodies is complicated and shows a considerable degree of variation between lots, these kits are high in cost and make it difficult to control the consistency from batch to batch (20Du T. Zhu G. Wu X. Fang J. Zhou E.-M. Biotinylated single-domain antibody-based blocking ELISA for detection of antibodies against swine influenza virus.Int. J.

Wang C. et al.Evaluation of screening assays for the detection of influenza A virus serum antibodies in swine.Transboundary Emerg. Dis. 2016; 63: 24-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Nanobodies, or named single-domain antibodies, are a novel type of engineered antibodies derived from the variable domain of the heavy chain of heavy-chain antibody (VHH) (22Muyldermans S. Lauwereys M. Unique single-domain antigen binding fragments derived from naturally occurring camel heavy-chain antibodies.J. Mol. Recognition. 1999; 12: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Nanobodies have certain advantages, including their small molecular weight (15 kDa) and their suitability for genetic manipulation. Thus, they are widely used in disease diagnosis, surveillance, and prevention (22Muyldermans S. Lauwereys M. Unique single-domain antigen binding fragments derived from naturally occurring camel heavy-chain antibodies.J. Mol. Recognition. 1999; 12: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 23Li D. Ji F. Huang C. Jia L. High expression achievement of active and robust anti-β2 microglobulin nanobodies via E.coli hosts selection.Molecules. 2019; 24: 2860Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Regarding the development of disease diagnosis kits, derivatives can be easily established by coupling the reporters, and this is fiscally favorable compared with conventional antibodies (24Wrapp D. De Vlieger D. Corbett K.S. Torres G.M. Wang N. Van Breedam W. et al.Structural basis for potent neutralization of betacoronaviruses by single-domain camelid antibodies.Cell. 2020; 181: 1004-1015.e1015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). For example, the reporter-nanobody fusion protein (RANbody) has been applied in the development of detection assays and for labeling cells and tissues (25Ren W. Li Z. Xu Y. Wan D. Barnych B. Li Y. et al.One-step ultrasensitive bioluminescent enzyme immunoassay based on nanobody/nanoluciferase fusion for detection of aflatoxin B(1) in cereal.J. Agric.

Duan H. et al.Nanobody-horseradish peroxidase and -EGFP fusions as reagents to detect porcine parvovirus in the immunoassays.J. Nanobiotechnol. 2020; 18: 7Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Recently, the nanobody-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) fusion was universally used to develop immunoassays to detect antibodies in the sera (20Du T. Zhu G. Wu X. Fang J. Zhou E.-M. Biotinylated single-domain antibody-based blocking ELISA for detection of antibodies against swine influenza virus.Int. J. Nanomed. 2019; 14: 9337-9349Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 27Sheng Y. Wang K. Lu Q. Ji P. Liu B. Zhu J. et al.Nanobody-horseradish peroxidase fusion protein as an ultrasensitive probe to detect antibodies against Newcastle disease virus in the immunoassay.J. Nanobiotechnol. 2019; 17: 35Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, few studies have developed an immunoassay for detecting anti-IAV antibodies in the sera from different species using nanobodies as reagents. In the present study, the NP from a subtype of the H9N2 avian IV (H9N2 AIV, H9N2-NP) was expressed using the Escherichia coli system. Then, H9N2-NP was used as an antigen to immunize the Bactrian camel and to screen the nanobodies obtained. In total, five nanobodies against H9N2-NP were obtained and modified to contain an HRP tag. Subsequently, the crossreactivity of these nanobodies with other subtypes of IAVs was assessed, and a nanobody recognizing a common epitope located in the NP of all IAV subtype strains was characterized. Then, using this nanobody-HRP fusion as a reagent, a cELISA was developed to qualitatively detect anti-IAV antibodies in the sera from different species. Our study provided a type of cELISA with rapid and easy operation for the diagnosis of IAV infection in different species. Importantly, the method produced was low in cost for following commercial production without the HRP-labeled antibodies in vitro. To immunize the camels, anti-H9N2-NP nanobodies were screened and the cELISA was established; the recombinant H9N2-NP was expressed using a bacterial system. SDS-PAGE analysis showed that the recombinant protein was successfully expressed and purified using a nickel–nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni–NTA) column with the expected size of 56 kDa (Fig. S1A). Western blotting analysis revealed that the recombinant H9N2-NP specifically reacted with positive chicken serum samples for anti-H9N2 AIV antibodies (Fig. S1B), indicating that the recombinant proteins possessed antigenicity. After the camel was immunized with the H9N2-NP, the titer of antibody against the protein in serum samples reached 1:128,000 based on iELISA (Fig. 1A). Next, a phage display library containing 9.8 × 108 individual transformants was successfully constructed using the peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) from the immunized camel. Subsequently, the results showed that the positive rate of the library was 98% by colony PCR assay (Fig. 1B), and each clone from the selected 96 clones contained a different VHH sequence (data not shown). The high capacity and positivity rate of the library confirmed the suitable heterogeneity of the library. After three rounds of panning, the results showed that the phage particles carrying H9N2-NP-specific VHH were significantly enriched (Table S2). Using the iELISA to detect the nanobodies in the periplasm from the 96 clones, the results showed that 94 clones could react with the H9N2-NP (Fig. 1C). These 94 positive clones were sequenced, and five nanobodies were obtained based on the complementarity-determining region 3 of the sequences. They were named H9N2-NP-Nb5, H9N2-NP-Nb16, H9N2-NP-Nb18, H9N2-NP-Nb42, and H9N2-NP-Nb53. Alignment results suggested that the five nanobodies possessed typical hydrophilic amino acid substitutions in the framework-2 regions (Fig. 1D). In addition, the five nanobodies were tested by iELISA using H9N2-NP and Newcastle disease virus (NDV)-NP separately as coating antigens. The results showed that they specifically reacted with the H9N2-NP (Fig. 1E) but not with NDV-VP, which was expressed with the same procedures and systems as H9N2-NP (27Sheng Y. Wang K. Lu Q. Ji P. Liu B. Zhu J. et al.Nanobody-horseradish peroxidase fusion protein as an ultrasensitive probe to detect antibodies against Newcastle disease virus in the immunoassay.J. Nanobiotechnol. 2019; 17: 35Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Based on the aforementioned descriptions, the five anti-H9N2 nanobodies fusing with HRP were successfully expressed using human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK-293T) cells as confirmed by IFA identification (Fig. 2A). Using the supernatant from the transfected HEK-293T cells as testing antibodies, the results of direct ELISA showed that all five nanobody-HRP fusion proteins were secreted and subsequently termed H9N2-NP-Nb5-HRP, H9N2-NP-Nb16-HRP, H9N2-NP-Nb18-HRP, H9N2-NP-Nb42-HRP, and H9N2-NP-Nb53-HRP (Fig. 2B). The titer of the H9N2-NP-Nb5-HRP fusion proteins in the supernatants was 1:10,000, and the titers of the other four H9N2-NP-nanobodies-HRP fusions were 1:1000 (Fig. 2C). To analyze the five nanobody-HRP fusion protein crossreaction with other subtypes of IAV and influenza B virus (IBV), the direct ELISAs using the NP of H1N1, H3N2, B/Yamagata/16/1988, and killed denatured H5N1 and H7N9 particles as the coating antigens were performed. SDS-PAGE analysis showed that the NP of H1N1, H3N2, and B/Yamagata/16/1988 was successfully expressed using the E. coli system with the expected size and was successfully purified using a Ni–NTA column (Fig. 3A). The results of direct ELISA showed that the H9N2-Nb5, H9N2-Nb16, H9N2-Nb18, H9N2-Nb42, and H9N2-Nb53-HRP could crossreact with the NPs of subtypes H1N1, H3N2, H5N1, and H7N9 IAVs but not react with the NP of B/Yamagata/16/1988 (Fig. 3B). In addition, each positive serum sample for anti-H9N2, -H1N1, -H3N2, -H5N1, and -H7N9 antibodies confirmed using the commercial IDEXX ELISA kit was detected using these nanobody-HRP fusions as reagents by blocking ELISA. The results showed that the percentage inhibition (PI) of cELISA using H9N2-NP-Nb5-HRP as a probe reached 80% (Fig. 3C). The aforementioned results indicated that the epitope recognized by the H9N2-NP-Nb5 may be conserved across different subtypes of IAVs. Based on these results, H9N2-NP-Nb5-HRP was selected for identification of its recognizing epitope to analyze the conservation in all subtypes of IAVs and for developing the cELISA. To identify the epitope recognized by H9N2-NP-Nb5-HRP, different truncated and overlapping H9N2-NP fragments were designed (Fig. 4A). After these fragments were expressed using the E. coli system, SDS-PAGE and Western blotting analysis showed that they were successfully expressed with the expected size and purified by a Ni–NTA column (Fig. 4, B and C). The results of direct ELISA using these truncated fragments as coating antigens showed that the H9N2-NP-Nb5-HRP reacted with fragments spanning 1 to 1308 bp (N436 amino acids), 1 to 1215 bp (N405 amino acids), 1 to 1182 bp (N394 amino acids) and 1 to 1167 bp (N389 amino acids) but not with 1 to 747 bp (N249 amino acids), 747 to 1494 bp (C249 amino acids), 1 to 1122 (N374 amino acids), 373 to 1494 (C374 amino acids), 187 to 1494 bp (C436 amino acids), or 1 to 1152 bp (N384 amino acids) (Fig. 4D). These results suggested that the epitope recognized by H9N2-NP-Nb5-HRP may be a native conformational epitope and the two regions of amino acids 1 to 62 and amino acids 385 to 389 may be important domains for maintaining the conformation. To precisely define the epitope, AlphaFold2 server was used to predict the structure of proteins (28Jumper J. Evans R. Pritzel A. Green T. Figurnov M. Ronneberger O. et al.Highly accurate protein structure prediction with AlphaFold.Nature. 2021; 596: 583-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (6920) Google Scholar). The docking model showed that the W95, T96, and K100 are located in the H9N2-NP-Nb5 regions. Amino acids 354 to 356, 385 to 387, and 445 to 449 in the H9N2-NP were essential for H9N2-NP-Nb5-HRP interaction with the H9N2-NP (Fig. 5A). Based on the reaction of different fragments and predicted results, the amino acids located in 388 to 389 (H9N2-NP388–389M), 385 to 389 (H9N2-NP385–389M), and the three regions (H9N2-NP3M) predicted by the docking model were mutated into alanine (A) and expressed using the E. coli system. In addition, the W95, T96, and K100 of H9N2-NP-Nb5-HRP were also all mutated to A (termed H9N2-NP-Nb53M-HRP). SDS-PAGE and Western blotting showed that the mutants of H9N2-NP were successfully expressed with the expected sizes (Fig. 5, B and C). Furthermore, the direct ELISA results showed that H9N2-NP3M did not react with H9N2-NP-Nb5-HRP, and H9N2-NP-Nb53M-HRP did not react with H9N2-NP. In addition, although H9N2-NP385–389M still reacted with H9N2-NP-Nb5-HRP, the absorbance at 450 nm value of direct ELISA using the coated antigen was significantly lower than that of H9N2-NP (Fig. 5D). So, the results of direct ELISA using the mutated proteins indicated that the predicted amino acids for interaction between H9N2-NP and H9N2-NP-Nb5-HRP were correct. Furthermore, these results also suggested that the epitope recognized by the H9N2-NP-Nb5-HRP was a native conformational epitope. To further analyze the amino acid conservation of the epitope, the amino acids 354 to 356, 385 to 387, and 445 to 449 of the NP from different IAV strains were aligned. Sequence alignments showed that the epitope was highly conserved among the different subtypes of IAV strains (Fig. 5E). The conditions of cELISA using the H9N2-NP-Nb5-HRP fusion as the probe were optimized. Using checkerboard titration experiments with the direct ELISA, the results showed that the optimized amount of coated antigen was 100 ng/well and the optimal dilution of H9N2-NP-Nb5-HRP was 1:4000 (Table S3). Using the different dilutions of positive and negative sera for detection with the cELISA, the results showed that the optimized dilution of testing sera was 1:10 (Table S4). Finally, the results for determining the optimal times showed that the optimized incubation time between the mixture of H9N2-NP-Nb5-HRP with testing sera and coated antigen was 20 min and the optimal color reaction time was 10 min (Table S5). The average PI (X) value of 180 negative sera from humans, pigs, and chickens detected by the developed cELISA was 1.0%, and the SD was 4.4%. The cutoff value of the cELISA was 14.2% (1.0% + 3 SD), indicating that the PI values of the tested sera by the cELISA were more than 14.2%, suggesting that the serum sample was positive for the anti-IAV antibody. If the PI value was less than 14.2%, this would then suggest they were negative. The results of testing different dilutions of positive sera for anti-IAV antibodies with the cELISA showed that the sera at a dilution of 1:640 was negative, and those at 1:320 were all positive (Fig. 6A). These indicated that the limits of detection of the cELISA for testing sera were 1:320. The results of testing the positive sera for antichicken, pig, and human viruses’ antibodies showed that the PI values of these sera were all below 14.2%, suggesting that the specificity of cELISA was good (Fig. 6B). To analyze the reproducibility of the cELISA, five positive and negative sera were tested to evaluate the intra-assay and interassay variabilities. The intra-assay CV of the PI was analyzed in the range of 3.14 to 7.02% with a median value of 5.08%, whereas the range for the interassay CV was 4.69 to 12.73% with a median value of 8.71% (Table S6). These data indicate that the cELISA method exhibited good reproducibility. The results of direct ELISA using the plates and H9N2-NP-Nb5-HRP stored at 4 °C for 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 days showed that the absorbance at 450 nm values were ∼1.0, indicating that the plates and the competitive agents H9N2-NP-Nb5-HRP remained active. The results of cELISA showed that the PI of cELISA stabilized at 80%, suggesting that the assay exhibited good stability over the past 180 days (Fig. 6C). To evaluate the assay for detecting anti-IAV antibodies in different species, the 2155 sera samples from human (n = 660), swine (n = 660), pet dog (n = 524), goat (n = 195), cattle (n = 28), rabbit (n = 44), cat (n = 44), pet dog (n = 524), duck (n = 98), and wild birds (n = 63) were simultaneously tested by the developed cELISA and the commercial IDEXX ELISA kit. For human sera, the positive rates of the cELISA and the commercial IDEXX ELISA kit were 97.58% (644 of 660) and 97.88% (646 of 660), respectively. For pig serum samples, the positive rates of the cELISA and the commercial IDEXX ELISA kit were 82.42% (544 of 660) and 83.33% (550 of 660), respectively. For pet dogs, the positive rates were 25.19% (132 of 524) and 25.95% (136 of 524), respectively. The positive rates of goat sera were 14.36% (28 of 195) and 14.87% (19 of 195), respectively. For cattle, the positive rates for both kits were 46.43% (13 of 28), and the positive rates of rabbit sera for both kits were 31.82% (14 of 44). For cat sera, the positive rates were 2.27% (1 of 44) and 6.82% (3 of 44), respectively. The positive rates of duck sera were 87.31% (227 of 260) and 88.08% (229 of 260), respectively, and for the wild birds, the rates were 27.73% (33 of 119) and 31.93% (38 of 119), respectively (Table 1). The aforementioned results indicated that the developed cELISA could be used to detect anti-IAV antibodies in different species.Table 1Detection of anti-IAV antibodies in the different species using the developed cELISASpeciescELISANumbers of seraCommercial IDEXX ELISA kitAgreement (%)Kappa valuePositive rate (%)+−Human+644644099.70.9397.6−16214Pig+544544099.10.9782.4−1166110Pet dog+132131198.90.9725.2−3925387Goat+2826297.40.9014.4−1673164Cattle+131301001.046.4−15015Rabbit+141401001.031.8−30030Cat+11095.50.482.3−43241Duck+227224396.90.8687.3−33528Wild bird+3330390.80.7827.7−86878 Open table in a new tab A total of 185 clinical chicken sera and 91 sequential sera from the specific pathogen-free (SPF) chickens challenged with H9N2 AIV were tested by the cELISA, HI test, and commercial IDEXX ELISA kit. For the clinical chicken sera, the positive rates of the three assays were 57.30%, 57.30%, and 51.35%, respectively (Table 2). When the performance of three methods was compared, the cELISA allowed to identify 106 positive and 79 negative serum samples, whereas in the commercial IDEXX ELISA kit, only 90 were positive and 16 showed to be negative. When the 79 cELISA-negative samples were subjected to the commercial ELISA, 5 of them were positive and 74 were negative. The agreements were 90.4% between the cELISA and the commercial IDEXX ELISA kit (Table 2). The results of both cELISA and HI test coincided in 106 of the 185 serum samples with an agreement rate of 100%. In addition, the statistical analysis showed that there were no significant differences (κ values were >0.4) between the cELISA and either the HI test (κ values = 1.0) or the commercial IEDXX ELISA kit (κ values = 0.772). For the challenged chicken sera, the results showed that the positive rates were 73.63% (67 of 91), 61.54% (56 of 91), and 59.34% (54 of 91), respectively (Table 2).

A real-time reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) assay was used to evaluate the effectiveness of CSC on the disintegration of viral RNA in a time dependent manner. The effects of CSC on viral infectivity were determined using a TCID50 assay of a surrogate virus, hCoV-229E, in MRC-5 cell culture. The results demonstrated that CSC achieved a 2 to 3- log 10 reduction of viral genomic RNA for a laboratory strain of hCoV-229E, and clinical samples of hCoV-229E and hCoV-OC43. A 3 to 4-log 10 reduction was observed for SARS-CoV-2 (RdRp and E gene) suggesting that a CSC surface could effectively disintegrate the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome. CSC was observed to have a 6 log 10 inactivation of infectious hCoV-229E using cell culture after 5 minutes of exposure compared to the control, indicating good disinfection efficacy of a CSC surface against virus."

Armillaria is a nutrient source for the growth of G . elata , and its nutrient metabolism efficiency affects the growth and development of G . elata . Auxin has been reported to stimulate Armillaria species, but the molecular mechanism remains unknown. We found that naphthalene acetic acid (NAA) can also promote the growth of A . gallica . Moreover, we identified a total of 2071 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) by analyzing the transcriptome sequencing data of A . gallica at 5 and 10 hour of NAA treatment. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses showed that these unigenes were significantly enriched in the metabolism pathways of arginine, proline, propanoate, phenylalanine and tryptophan. The expression levels of the general amino acid permease (Gap), ammonium transporter (AMT), glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH), glutamine synthetase (GS), Zn(II) 2Cys6 and C2H2 transcription factor genes were upregulated. Our transcriptome analysis showed that the amino acid and nitrogen metabolism pathways in Armillaria were rapidly induced within hours after NAA treatment. These results provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms by which NAA promotes the growth of Armillaria species."
https://openalex.org/W4309495967,"T1DM is the most frequent form of diabetes in children. It has a multifactorial pathogenesis in which genetic, environmental and immunological factors are involved. Among genetic explanations a major role is attributed to second class HLA genes, with the greatest risk associated with the simultaneous presence of the haplotypes DR3DQ2 and DR4DQ8. Based on results obtained in other countries, the aim of this research is to verify a possible association between the haplotype DRB1 * 04: 05-DQA1 * 03-DQB1 * 02 and the onset of T1DM among Italian children with possible genotype-phenotype correlations. Greater knowledge of genes which increase or decrease susceptibility is important for genome analysis.165 patients with type 1 diabetes treated at the Diabetology Unit of the Meyer Children's University Hospital, were clinically analyzed. Data relating to age at diagnosis, pancreatic anti-beta cell autoimmunity, comorbidities with date of diagnosis and family history were retrospectively collected from medical data. A case-control study was conducted to investigate the HLA types of the patients compared to a control group of 819 Tuscan donors enrolled in the National Bone Marrow Donor Register. Typing was carried out using the Eurospital ""DIABEGEN"" kit, currently in use at the immunology laboratory of the Meyer Children's University Hospital.Mean age at diagnosis was 9.3 years; most children (97%) had anti-pancreatic beta cell autoimmunity; the anti-insulin antibody (IAA) was more frequent among children with early clinical disease onset (0-5 years of age). From the case control comparison performed on HLA typing, it emerged that the greatest risk for the development of type 1 diabetes is conferred by the haplotypes DR3DQ2 and DR4DQ8, but in addition to these haplotypes, already known in other countries, we identified another haplotype, DR4DQ2 (DRB1 * 04: 05-DQA1 * 03-DQB1 * 02) which appears to predispose children to type 1 diabetes (p value 2.80E-08) and it is associated with early clinical disease onset (p-value = 0.002).We report a new haplotype which increases susceptibility to type 1 diabetes among Italian children and which is associated with early clinical disease onset. Given the central role attributed to genetic factors in the pathogenesis of T1DM and to the II class HLA genes, this new haplotype ought to be recognized as a risk factor and included in tests routinely carried out to identify patients with a genetic predisposition to type I diabetes in Italy. These findings could have practical implications in research and prevention programs."

In an in vitro pilot study, commercially available, sterile foldable intraocular lenses (IOLs) used during routine canine cataract surgery, and their packaging fluid were surveyed for the presence of bacterial DNA and/or viable (cultivable) bacteria. Swabs from IOLs and packaging fluid from three different veterinary manufacturers and three different production lots/manufacturer were collected for 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) sequencing. Packaging fluid samples were collected for aerobic/capnophilic bacterial culture. Culture yielded one isolate, identified as Staphylococcus epidermidis . 16S rRNA sequencing revealed distinct brand-specific bacterial DNA profiles, conserved between IOLs and packaging fluid of all production lots within each manufacturer. The dominant taxonomy differentiating each manufacturer was annotated as Staphylococcus sp, and was a 100% match to S . epidermidis . Distinct mixtures of bacterial DNA are present and consistent in IOLs and packaging fluid depending on the manufacturer, and Staphylococcus is the dominant contributor to the bacterial DNA detected.

Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) causes significant economic losses by affecting dairy herds globally. Development of protective vaccines is considered as one of the most effective controlling measures for MAP infections. In the current study, hydrophilic parts of MAP2191 and FAP-P proteins as two vaccine candidates were analyzed using immunoinformatics approaches.After selecting the most hydrophilic parts of MAP2191 and FAP-P, helper and cytotoxic T-cell epitopes of ht-MAP2191 and ht-FAP-P were identified. The immunogenic, toxicity and physicochemical properties were assessed. Secondary structures of these proteins were predicted, and their tertiary structures were modeled, refined, and validated. Linear and conformational epitopes of corresponding B-cells were recognized. Then ht-MAP2191 and ht-FAP-P epitopes were employed for molecular docking simulations.The results indicated that ht-MAP2191 and ht-FAP-P were immunogenic, non-allergenic, and non-toxic and possess potent T-cell and B-cell epitopes. Eventually, these protein constructs were docked favorably against TLR4.According to the findings, ht-MAP2191 and ht-FAP-P could be effective protein-based vaccine candidates for paratuberculosis.

https://openalex.org/W4309496090,"Background We evaluated associations between antibiotic prescription and healthcare resource use and costs (Part A), and between antibiotic switching and healthcare resource use, costs, and uncomplicated urinary tract infection recurrence (Part B) in female patients with uncomplicated urinary tract infection in the United States. Methods This retrospective cohort study of linked Optum and Premier Healthcare Database data included female patients ≥12 years old with an uncomplicated urinary tract infection diagnosis (index date), who were prescribed antibiotics during an outpatient/emergency department visit between January 1, 2013 and December 31, 2018. In Part A, patients were stratified by antibiotic prescription appropriateness: appropriate and optimal (compliant with Infectious Diseases Society of America 2011 guidelines for drug class/treatment duration) versus inappropriate/suboptimal (inappropriate drug class/treatment duration per Infectious Diseases Society of America 2011 guidelines, and/or treatment failure). In Part B, patients were stratified by treatment pattern (antibiotic switch vs no antibiotic switch). Healthcare resource use and costs during index episode (within 28 days of index date) and 12-month follow-up were compared. Results Of 5870 patients (mean age 44.5 years), 2762 (47.1%) had inappropriate/suboptimal prescriptions and 567 (9.7%) switched antibiotic. Inappropriate/suboptimal prescriptions were associated with higher healthcare resource use (mean number of ambulatory care and pharmacy claims [both p &lt; 0.001]), and higher total mean cost (inpatient, outpatient/emergency department, ambulatory visits, and pharmacy costs) per patient ($2616) than appropriate and optimal prescriptions ($649; p &lt; 0.001) (Part A). Antibiotic switching was associated with more pharmacy claims and higher total mean costs (p ≤ 0.01), and a higher incidence of recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infection (18.9%) than no antibiotic switching (14.2%; p &lt; 0.001) (Part B). Conclusions Inappropriate/suboptimal prescriptions and antibiotic switching were associated with high costs, ambulatory care, and pharmacy claims, suggesting a need for improved uncomplicated urinary tract infection prescribing practices in the United States."

Among a total of 870,197 35-151-mer sequencing reads, 297,711 reads (34.21%) were identified as ARV sequences. The de novo assembly of the ARV reads resulted in generation of 10 ARV-related contigs with the average sequencing coverage from 1390× to 1977× according to 10 ARV genome segments. The complete genomes of this pheasant-origin ARV (Reo/SDWF /Pheasant/17608/20) were 23,495 bp in length and consist of 10 dsRNA segments ranged from 1192 bp (S4) to 3958 bp (L1) encoding 12 viral proteins. Sequence comparison between the SDWF17608 and classic ARV reference strains revealed that 58.1–100% nucleotide (nt) identities and 51.4–100% amino acid (aa) identities were in genome segment coding genes. The 10 RNA segments had conversed termini at 5’ ( 5’-GCUUUU ) and 3’ ( UCAUC-3’ ) side, which were identical to the most published ARV strains. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that this pheasant ARV field variant was closely related with chicken ARV strains in 7 genome segment genes, but it possessed significant sequence divergence in M1, M3 and S2 segments. These findings suggested that this pheasant-origin field variant was a divergent ARV strain and was likely originated from reassortments between different chicken ARV strains."

We present a new real-time deep learning algorithm which produces adaptively a signal opposing the noise so that destructive interference occurs.

With this setup, an average of 4dB and a maximum of 10dB improvement of the signal-to-noise ratio of the EEG was achieved by removing wide band muscle noise.

As the most mineralized tissue in mammal, dental enamel provides maximum durability that allows teeth to function as weapons and/or tools as well as for food processing. The development and mineralization of enamel is a complex and elaborate process, which is tightly regulated by ameloblasts. Tooth development sequentially undergoes bud stage, cap stage, early and late bell stage. At bell stage, ameloblast differentiate from inner enamel epithelium (IEE) (1Zeichner-David M. Diekwisch T. Fincham A. Lau E. MacDougall M. Moradian-Oldak J. et al.Control of ameloblast differentiation.Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1995; 39: 69-92PubMed Google Scholar) and possess a life cycle of several stages including presecretory ameloblasts, secretory ameloblasts, and mature ameloblasts. Secretory ameloblasts are columnar, tall, polarized cells, which can secret extracellular matrix proteins such as amelogenin (AMELX) (2Shibata S. Suzuki S. Tengan T. Yamashita Y.

The fine mechanisms under the alteration from dental epithelial stem cells to differentiated ameloblasts that lead to enamel formation remains unknown. N6-methyladenosine (m6A), which was first discovered in 1970s (4Desrosiers R.C. Friderici K.H. Rottman F.M. Characterization of Novikoff hepatoma mRNA methylation and heterogeneity in the methylated 5' terminus.Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 4367-4374Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), is the most abundant internal mRNA modification. It is a key determinant of posttranscriptional mRNA regulation and function in the regulation in cell fate determination. In mammals, m6A methylation is mediated by the methyltransferase complex, which is composed of METTL3 (methyltransferase-like 3), METTL14, and subunit wilms tumor 1-associated protein (WTAP), KIAA1429, RNA-binding motif protein 15 (RBM15), and its paralog (RBM15B) (5Patil D.P.

Nevertheless, methylation is erased by the demethylases fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO) and alkB homolog5 (ALKBH5) (6Zhao B.S. Roundtree I.A. He C.

Many important biological processes are known to be regulated by m6A, including cell fate determination (11Geula S. Moshitch-Moshkovitz S. Dominissini D. Mansour A.A. Kol N.

WTAP is also a regulatory subunit of the RNA N6-methyladenosine methyltransferase, plays an important enzymatic role in METTL3-METTL14-WTAP methyltransferases complex (17Ping X.L. Sun B.F. Wang L. Xiao W. Yang X. Wang W.J. et al.Mammalian WTAP is a regulatory subunit of the RNA N6-methyladenosine methyltransferase.Cell. 2014; 24: 177-189Google Scholar). Recently, many studies proved that WTAP regulated dynamic m6A level, which can not only determine the fate of stem cells and regulate mammalian development but also be involved in carcinogenesis (18Chen Y.

In this study, Wtap conditional KO (cKO) mutant mice were generated. Loss of m6A by inactivation of Wtap led to severe amelogenesis imperfecta, which reveals the critical functions of m6A modification and its binding protein WTAP in dental enamel development. In order to study the role of WTAP in tooth development, we firstly analyzed the expression pattern of WTAP in mice and human sample. At E11.5 (dental lamina), E13.5 (bud stage), E14.5 (cap stage), E16.5 (early bell stage), E18.5 (late bell stage), and P0 (late bell stage) mice, we detected ubiquitous occupation of WTAP in IEE by immunostaining (Fig. S1, A–F), indicating that WTAP might be involved in enamel development. In human reduced dental epithelium of unerupted third molar tooth, we also detected strong expression of WTAP protein (Fig. S2), proving that expression pattern of WTAP was similar between mice and human. In order to study the biological function of the m6A writer WTAP in enamel development, Wtap floxed mice bearing loxP sites flanking exons 4 to 5 of the Wtap gene were obtained from professor Minghan Tong’s Laboratory. The precise methods were previously described by Tong’s group (20Jia G.X. Lin Z. Yan R.G. Wang G.W. Zhang X.N. Li C. et al.WTAP function in sertoli cells is essential for sustaining the spermatogonial stem cell niche.Stem Cell Rep. 2020; 15: 968-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The resulting Wtapflox/flox mice were crossed with K14-cre transgenic mice to generate Wtap cKO mice (genotype Wtapflox/flox; K14-Cre, named as cKO) (Fig. S3). Littermates of the cKO mice identified with Wtapflox/flox genotypes were used as control subjects. Immunohistochemical staining (Fig. 1A, and S1G) results showed that the cKO mice failed to produce WTAP protein in enamel organ tissue. Nevertheless, WTAP protein remained unperturbed in other dental germ tissues, such as dental mesenchyme. Compared to the controls, cKO mice had a notably decreased body weight at P0 (Fig. 1, B and C). No obvious phenotypic changes were found in the head, leg, and size by gross observation. However, at P0, we found severely enamel developmental failure in all of cKO mice. The tooth size and enamel thickness were observed largely deceased in both incisors and molars (Figs. 1D and 2C). The cusps of molars changed to small and blunt (Figs. 1, D3 and D4). The degree of enamel mineralization in mutant and control teeth was detected by MASSON trichrome staining on P0 incisor. Dentin formation was present on control and cKO mice (Fig. 1E). However, enamel was undetectable in the cKO incisor (Figs. 1, E3 and E4), indicating that disruption of the Wtap gene results in enamel malformation during the early developmental stages of amelogenesis.Figure 3WTAP promoted differentiation and proliferation of dental inner enamel epithelial cells (IEEs).

Incisors were selected to observe because it can reflect different stages of amelogenesis, including secretory, transition, and maturation phases (21Smith C.E.L. Poulter J.A. Antanaviciute A. Kirkham J. Brookes S.J. Inglehearn C.F. et al.Amelogenesis imperfecta; genes, proteins, and pathways.Front Physiol. Rev. 2017; 8: 435Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In control mice, we found morphology of the IEE cells gradually changed from cubic to long columnar in the sagittal section and the cell polarity gradually became obvious with nucleus far away from basement membrane (Fig. 2, A2–A4). However, there are no obvious changes in cell morphology of IEE cells in cKO mice (Fig. 2C). The IEE cells of cKO mice showed no increase in length and polarization of these cells (Fig. 2, C2–C4). The cervical loop was significantly thinner, with fewer cells in cKO mice (Fig. 2C1). From the coronal view, more matrix deposited in the junction between IEE cells and odontoblast in WT incisors (Fig. 2B), while less in cKO incisors (Fig. 2D). In vitro, we also found decreased calcium knots formation in Wtap knock-down ameloblast-lineage cells (ALCs) (22Nakata A. Kameda T. Nagai H. Ikegami K. Duan Y. Terada K. et al.Establishment and characterization of a spontaneously immortalized mouse ameloblast-lineage cell line.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 308: 834-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) which confirmed that WTAP is vital for the proliferation and differentiation of ameloblasts (Fig. S4). To investigate which stages of ameloblast differentiation has been affected, the genes expression levels of enamel matrix proteins and proteinases, which represent stages of ameloblast cell differentiation, were examined by immunohistochemical staining. We found that AMELX, which is secreted by secretory-stage ameloblasts, was strongly expressed at anterior end of labial side of the incisor in control (Fig. 3A). On the contrary, AMELX expression was significantly decreased in the cKO incisor (Fig. 3, E and I). Interestingly, expression of dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP) seemed to have no significant difference between WT and mutant mice (Fig. 3, B, F and J). DSPP was reported to express transiently in presecretory stage ameloblasts, while not expressed in secretory stage. Enamel epithelial cells are postmitotic cells in presecretory stage ameloblasts. The BrdU staining is present in all G2/S cells but not post-mitotic cells. In P0 control incisors, BrdU staining was not found at the anterior end of the labial side but gradually expressed at the posterior region (Fig. 3C). In P0 cKO incisor, we observed a decreased pattern of BrdU staining expression at the posterior region (Fig. 3, G and K). In molar, same expression pattern was found in cKO and control mice (Fig. 3, D, H and L). Taken together, the in vivo evidence indicates a striking phenotype of abnormal enamel development, resulting from affected differentiation and proliferation of the enamel epithelium to mature ameloblasts at the early stages of enamel development. To investigate the potential mechanism, we probed for Sonic hedgehog (SHH), which plays an important role in generation of ameloblasts from stem cells (23Seidel K. Ahn C.P. Lyons D. Nee A. Ting K. Brownell I. et al.Hedgehog signaling regulates the generation of ameloblast progenitors in the continuously growing mouse incisor.Development. 2010; 137: 3753-3761Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In cKO, expression of SHH in ameloblasts of incisior was decreased (Fig. 4, A–C). This decreased expression was confirmed by reverse transcription quantitative PCR (Fig. 4C). In 16.5dpc cKO, the tooth embryo develops in the cap stage. We also observed decreased expression of SHH in ameloblasts of molar (Fig. S5, A–C). In vitro, recombinant SHH protein also can rescue the differentiation ability of Wtap knockdown ALC cells (Fig. 4, D and E). The results indicated that WTAP plays a critical role in regulation of SHH expression in ameloblasts. Previous studies proved that WTAP is an important subunit in the m6A methyltransferase complex and plays a critical role in epitranscriptomic m6A regulation (17Ping X.L. Sun B.F. Wang L. Xiao W. Yang X. Wang W.J. et al.Mammalian WTAP is a regulatory subunit of the RNA N6-methyladenosine methyltransferase.Cell. 2014; 24: 177-189Google Scholar). We found that m6A level was notably reduced in cKO dental epithelial tissue of mandibular first molar (Fig. 4F). In vitro, results of dot blot assay also showed that m6A level is obviously reduced after WTAP deletion in ALC cells (Fig. 4, G and H). In vivo, by performing m6A-RIP-qPCR, we proved m6A enrichment in Shh mRNA (Fig. 4I). Futhermore, result of mRNA stability assay showed that shh mRNA half-life decreased after Wtap KO in ALC cells (Fig. 4J), which means shh mRNA stability became weaker. Previous studies also found that WTAP exerts a concentration-dependent inhibitory effect on the expression of WT1-sensitive genes that regulate both mitogenic and survival pathways (24Small T.W. Bolender Z. Bueno C. O'Neil C. Nong Z. Rushlow W. et al.Wilms' tumor 1-associating protein regulates the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells.Circ. Res. 2006; 99: 1338-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, we found that WT1 was hardly expressed in dental epithelial cells and Wt1 cKO mice displayed normal amelogenesis as well as WT mice (Fig. S6). It is indicated that WTAP affects enamel development not by inhibiting WT1-sensitive genes pathway. Concluded that WTAP mediated ameloblasts differentiation via affecting SHH signaling through m6A but not binding to WT1. Then, WTAP may promote enamel development by regulating the expression of SHH protein via m6A methylation. Enamel development involves various stages that are tightly controlled by several key molecules of major signaling pathways expressed in epithelial and mesenchymal cells. Subtle alterations during this complicated process could lead to severe enamel defects in structure, color, and shape. For a long time, it was believed that all the genetic information was stored in the sequence of DNA. However, the differences in tooth morphology between monozygotic twins indicated that other mechanisms exert their effect on gene translation (25Duncan H.F. Smith A.J. Fleming G.J. Cooper P.R.

Genetic and environmental influences on human dental variation: a critical evaluation of studies involving twins.Arch. Oral Biol. 2009; 54: S45-S51Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). These mechanisms are called epigenetics, which are alterations in gene expression without changes in the DNA sequence. Several studies have proved epigenetics are important in the regulation of tooth development and tooth regeneration (27Townsend G. Bockmann M. Hughes T. Brook A.

Modulations in microRNA, lncRNA, DNA methylation, and chromatin modifications are proved important regulatory mechanisms during tooth development (29Yoshioka H. Minamizaki T. Yoshiko Y.

However, RNA modification in regulation of tooth development remains unclear. Here, we used the epithelial cell special marker, keratin 14, to establish the genetic mice lineage to conditionally delete Wtap from the initiation of enamel formation. Loss of Wtap leads to a severe amelogenesis imperfecta-like phenotype with smaller tooth size and thinner enamel, suggesting the functional importance of WTAP in ameloblasts. WTAP was initially identified as a nuclear protein that specifically interacts with WT1 in the development of mouse embryo (16Fukusumi Y. Naruse C. Asano M. Wtap is required for differentiation of endoderm and mesoderm in the mouse embryo.Dev. Dyn. 2008; 237: 618-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, WT1 is not required for enamel formation in our study. Deletion of Wt1 in mice did not generate the same phenotype of Wtap cKO mice. Hence, we performed dot blot assay, which proved that m6A level is obviously reduced after Wtap deletion. The results indicate that WTAP-mediated m6A plays an important role in amelogenesis. The process of amelogenesis includes four defined stages: presecretory, secretory, transition, and maturation. Hu et al.(36Hu J.C. Chun Y.H. Al Hazzazzi T. Simmer J.P. Enamel formation and amelogenesis imperfecta.Cells Tissues Organs. 2007; 186: 78-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) illustrated the changing ameloblast morphologies throughout amelogenesis as viewed histologically. However, in cKO mice, we observed shorter and unpolarized ameloblasts. The cervical loop was significantly thinner. The changing ameloblast morphologies from the root to the cut end cannot be found. The results indicats that WTAP plays a crucial role in maturation of ameloblast. Previous studies have proved that SHH and FGF signaling are required from the initiation stage of tooth development onward. In E11.5 mouse, the molar begin forming, a group of FGF8-positive cells form a rosette-like structure and move toward a SHH-positive cell center (37Prochazka J. Prochazkova M. Du W. Spoutil F. Tureckova J. Hoch R. et al.Migration of founder epithelial cells drives proper molar tooth positioning and morphogenesis.Dev. Cell. 2015; 35: 713-724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Moreover, inhibition of SHH signaling resulted in the abnormality of the growth and invagination of dental epithelium (37Prochazka J. Prochazkova M. Du W. Spoutil F. Tureckova J. Hoch R. et al.Migration of founder epithelial cells drives proper molar tooth positioning and morphogenesis.Dev. Cell. 2015; 35: 713-724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). It is also believed that SHH is indispensable for the development of cytoskeleton in ameloblasts, which is critical to maintaining epithelial cell polarity and intercellular communication (38Gritli-Linde A. Bei M. Maas R. Zhang X.M. Linde A. McMahon A.P. Shh signaling within the dental epithelium is necessary for cell proliferation, growth and polarization.Development. 2002; 129: 5323-5337Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). In cKO mice, expression of SHH in ameloblasts was decreased, indicating that WTAP modulates ameloblast maturation by regulating the expression of SHH. Previous studies have shown that WTAP-mediated m6A could influence many biological processes. m6A-RIP-qPCR also verified m6A enrichment in shh mRNA in dental tissue. Furthermore, incubation of recombinant SHH partially rescued the capacity of mineralization ability in Wtap silenced ameloblasts. Based on these evidences, WTAP was believed to regulate Shh expression by maintaining the level of m6A modification. It will be of interest to explore the precise regulating mechanism in the future. Mice lacking WTAP die between embryonic day 6.5 to 10.5 and show dramatic defects in endoderm and mesoderm formation (15Horiuchi K. Umetani M. Minami T. Okayama H. Takada S. Yamamoto M. et al.Wilms' tumor 1-associating protein regulates G2/M transition through stabilization of cyclin A2 mRNA.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Dyn. 2008; 237: 618-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The cKO mice in our study die between postnatal day 1 to 2. It limits our observation of the tooth phenotype in the matured mice at 8 weeks old or later. Inducible gene KO mice should be used in the future study. Here, we presented some findings demonstrating the importance of m6A in amelogenesis. Firstly, conditional deletion of Wtap in ameloblasts led to defective amelogenesis, demonstrating an essential role of WTAP-mediated m6A modification in ameloblast maturation. Secondly, m6A-RIP-qPCR assays revealed that deletion of Wtap resulted in downregulation of Shh. In conclusion, WTAP plays a critical role in amelogenesis and may regulate the maturation of ameloblasts by modulating expression of SHH and downstream molecules. Wtap floxed mice, K14 Cre mice were gifts from Pro. Minghan Tong’s lab (CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology). All mice were C57BL/6 genetic background and were bred under specific pathogen-free conditions. Wtapflox/+; K14 Cre mice mated with Wtapflox/flox mice were utilized to obtain Wtapflox/flox; K14 Cre mice embryos. Primers for genotyping were listed in Table S1. This study was approved by the Ethical Review Committee of the Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine (Shanghai, China). Heads from embryonic or postnatal mice were dissected in PBSand fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde-PBS solution overnight. The tissues were then dehydrated through graded ethanol, embedded in paraffin wax, and sectioned by 4 μm. H&E staining was the first step for observation. Immunofluorescence was performed to identify the expression pattern of key signaling molecule. Firstly, slides were boiled in sodium citrate buffer (10 μM, pH 6.0) for 15 min. When it were cooled in room temperature (RT), PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100 was used to wash the slides. Next, 10% donkey serum and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS were used to block the nonspecific antigen for 60 min at RT. Then, the slides were incubated with the primary antibodies (WTAP, 1:200, Santa Cruz; Amelx, 1:100, Amelx, Santa Cruz; SHH, Bio-Techne, 1:100) in blocking buffer overnight at 4 °C. On the following day, after three times (10 min/times) wash in PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100, Alexa Fluor 488-/594-conjugated donkey secondary antibody (Jackson Immuno Research Laboratories; 1:500) were then added on the slides.

The VAM agreement endows venture capital institutions a contractual right to reevaluate invested startup contingent on preset performance targets, which is crucial for the effectiveness of the VAM agreement by deeply affecting the strategy and fate of the startup. Motivated by exploring a rational performance target setting, this paper: 1)Firstly, extracts a general structure of the VAM agreement by cases analysis;2) Secondly, adopts a real options methodology to derive the option value held by venture capital institutions and how the pre-determined performance target affect the payoff of venture capital institutions;3)Thirdly, derives the expected time to achieve the given performance target and the behavior choice of entrepreneurs of startups; 4)Finally, by maximizing the contractual value of venture capital institutions with the participation constraints of the entrepreneur, derives the optimal performance target setting. The result finds that the option value of the VAM agreement is positively related to the performance target. It may partially explain why venture capital institutions tend to dominate overly high targets from a real options perspective. We also confirm the incentive effect of the VAM agreement that entrepreneurs tend to exert their best effort. Furthermore, the derivation of the optimal performance target shows that it is an increased function of the agreement period and a subtractive function of project risk. This paper contributes to the literature on contingent payment mechanisms and provides practical implications for the VAM agreement design."
https://openalex.org/W4309293826,"Adipocyte hyperplasia and hypertrophy are the two main processes contributing to adipose tissue expansion, yet the mechanisms that regulate and balance their involvement in obesity are incompletely understood. Activin B/GDF-3 receptor ALK7 is expressed in mature adipocytes, and promotes adipocyte hypertrophy upon nutrient overload by suppressing adrenergic signaling and lipolysis. In contrast, the role of ALK4, the canonical pan-activin receptor, in adipose tissue is unknown. Here we report that, unlike ALK7, ALK4 is preferentially expressed in adipocyte precursors, where it suppresses differentiation, allowing proliferation and adipose tissue expansion. ALK4 expression in adipose tissue increases upon nutrient overload and positively correlates with fat depot mass and body weight, suggesting a role in adipose tissue hyperplasia during obesity. Mechanistically, ALK4 signaling suppresses expression of CEBPα and PPARγ, two master regulators of adipocyte differentiation. Conversely, ALK4 deletion enhances CEBPα/PPARγ expression and induces premature adipocyte differentiation, which can be rescued by CEBPα knock-down. These results clarify the function of ALK4 in adipose tissue and highlight the contrasting roles of the two activin receptors in the regulation of adipocyte hyperplasia and hypertrophy during obesity."

Despite the availability of treatment for HCV, treatment programs have generally excluded pregnant individuals. Our objective was to query patients and clinicians to identify barriers to including pregnant individuals in HCV treatment programs.This qualitative investigation included obstetricians and previously/currently pregnant individuals with HCV. Participants completed interviews regarding knowledge of and attitudes towards HCV treatment and perceived barriers to treatment during pregnancy. Data were analyzed using the constant comparative method. Obstetricians (N = 18) and patients (N = 21) described concerns about equity, access, and cost. Both expressed uncertainty about safety and confirmed a need for clinician education. Obstetricians emphasized the lack of professional guidelines. Although some clinicians expressed concern about patient adherence and engagement, patients were largely desirous of treatment; both groups identified potential benefits of antenatal treatment.Both patients and obstetricians were generally receptive to HCV treatment in pregnancy and recognized pregnancy as an important window of opportunity for treatment. Our findings suggest the need for further research on maternal-fetal safety of HCV treatment as well as on interventions to ensure fair and appropriate access to HCV treatment for pregnant individuals."

https://openalex.org/W4309436453,"Cellular inhibitor of apoptosis-1 (cIAP1) is a signaling regulator with oncogenic properties. It is involved in the regulation of signaling pathways controlling inflammation, cell survival, proliferation, differentiation and motility. It is recruited into membrane-receptor-associated signaling complexes thanks to the molecular adaptor TRAF2. However, the cIAP1/TRAF2 complex exists, independently of receptor engagement, in several subcellular compartments. The present work strengthens the importance of TRAF2 in the oncogenic properties of cIAP1. cIAPs-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were transformed using the HRas-V12 oncogene. Re-expression of cIAP1 enhanced tumor growth in a nude mice xenograft model, and promoted lung tumor nodes formation. Deletion or mutation of the TRAF2-binding site completely abolished the oncogenic properties of cIAP1. Further, cIAP1 mediated the clustering of TRAF2, which was sufficient to stimulate tumor growth. Our TRAF2 interactome analysis showed that cIAP1 was critical for TRAF2 to bind to its protein partners. Thus, cIAP1 and TRAF2 would be two essential subunits of a signaling complex promoting a pro-tumoral signal. cIAP1/TRAF2 promoted the activation of the canonical NF-κB and ERK1/2 signaling pathways. NF-κB-dependent production of IL-6 triggered the activation of the JAK/STAT3 axis in an autocrine manner. Inhibition or downregulation of STAT3 specifically compromised the growth of cIAP1-restored MEFs but not that of MEFs expressing a cIAP1-mutant and treating mice with the STAT3 inhibitor niclosamide completely abrogated cIAP1/TRAF2-mediated tumor growth. Altogether, we demonstrate that cIAP1/TRAF2 binding is essential to promote tumor growth via the activation of the JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway."

A total of 311 samples from raw cows’ milk (212), milkers’ hands (44), and milking buckets (55) swabs were collected and tested. The disc diffusion method was used to test the antimicrobial susceptibility of the isolates. A questionnaire survey was conducted to assess the factors of milk contamination with S . aureus and antimicrobial resistance. The Chi-square test, one-way analysis of variance, and logistic regression analysis were used for data analyses. The result indicated that 16.72% (52/311) (95% CI: 12.75–21.34%) of the samples were positive for S . aureus . The occurrence of S . aureus was 22.73%, 16.51%, and 12.73% in milkers’ hand swabs, cow milk, and milking bucket swabs, respectively. The mean count of S . aureus from raw cows’ milk was 4.3± 1.45 log10 CFU/ml. About 88% of S aureus isolates were resistant to ampicillin while 82.9% and 70.7% of the isolates were susceptible to ciprofloxacin and cefotaxime respectively. The majority of the S . aureus isolates (61%) showed multi-drug resistance. The odds of S . aureus isolation from the milk of cows were significantly high in older cows (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR]: 5.54; p = 0.001), in late lactation stages (AOR: 3.6; p = 0.012), and in farms where house cleaning was done twice per week (AOR: 8.7; p = 0.001). A high percentage of farmers had insufficient knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) about the factors contributing to antimicrobial resistance. In conclusion, the poor milk hygienic practices, high rate of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), and inadequate KAP of farmers about factors of AMR suggest potential public health risks thus requiring training and surveillance programs."

https://openalex.org/W4309495303,"Deep learning-based graph generation approaches have remarkable capacities for graph data modeling, allowing them to solve a wide range of real-world problems. Making these methods able to consider different conditions during the generation procedure even increases their effectiveness by empowering them to generate new graph samples that meet the desired criteria. This paper presents a conditional deep graph generation method called SCGG that considers a particular type of structural conditions. Specifically, our proposed SCGG model takes an initial subgraph and autoregressively generates new nodes and their corresponding edges on top of the given conditioning substructure. The architecture of SCGG consists of a graph representation learning network and an autoregressive generative model, which is trained end-to-end. More precisely, the graph representation learning network is designed to compute continuous representations for each node in a graph, which are not only affected by the features of adjacent nodes, but also by the ones of farther nodes. This network is primarily responsible for providing the generation procedure with the structural condition, while the autoregressive generative model mainly maintains the generation history. Using this model, we can address graph completion, a rampant and inherently difficult problem of recovering missing nodes and their associated edges of partially observed graphs. The computational complexity of the SCGG method is shown to be linear in the number of graph nodes. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method compared with state-of-the-art baselines."

Risk prediction of 30-day mortality can help clinicians identify treatment plans to reduce the risk of death, and prediction of 30-day unplanned readmission may improve outcomes by identifying patients who may benefit from readmission prevention strategies. The goal of this study is to develop machine learning models to stratify risk of 30-day procedure-related mortality and 30-day unplanned readmission in patients undergoing lower extremity infra-inguinal endovascular interventions. We used a cohort of 14,444 cases from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database. For each outcome, we developed and evaluated multiple machine learning models, including Support Vector Machines, Multilayer Perceptrons, and Gradient Boosting Machines, and selected a random forest as the best-performing model for both outcomes. Our 30-day procedure-related mortality model achieved an AUC of 0.75 (95% CI: 0.71-0.79) and our 30-day unplanned readmission model achieved an AUC of 0.68 (95% CI: 0.67-0.71). Stratification of the test set by race (white and non-white), sex (male and female), and age (≥65 years and <65 years) and subsequent evaluation of demographic parity by AUC shows that both models perform equally well across race, sex, and age groups. We interpret the model globally and locally using Gini impurity and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). Using the top five predictors for death and mortality, we demonstrate differences in survival for subgroups stratified by these predictors, which underscores the utility of our model."

Pain management strategies should consider ways to increase social satisfaction in individuals with chronic pain, perhaps by facilitating socialisation in the home using remote communication methods similar to those which became popular during the COVID-19 lockdown."
https://openalex.org/W4309495343,"Background The UK National Screening Committee currently recommends against antenatal screening for Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in England due to lack of HCV prevalence data and treatment licensed for use in pregnancy. We aimed to produce regional and national estimates of the number and proportion of livebirths to HCV seropositive women in England in 2013 and 2018. Methods A logistic regression model fitted in the Bayesian framework estimated probabilities of HCV seropositivity among 24,599 mothers delivering in the North Thames area of England in 2012 adjusted by maternal age and region of birth. These probabilities were applied to the underlying population structures of women delivering livebirths in England in 2013 and 2018 to estimate the number of livebirths to HCV seropositive women in these years nationally and by region. The Bayesian approach allowed the uncertainty associated with all estimates to be properly quantified. Results Nationally, the estimated number of livebirths to women seropositive for HCV for England was 464 (95% credible interval [CI] 300–692) in 2013 and 481 (95%CI 310–716) in 2018, or 70.0 (95%CI 45.0–104.1) per 100,000 and 76.9 (95%CI 49.5–114.4) per 100,000 in these years respectively. Regions with the highest estimated number of livebirths to HCV seropositive women in 2013 and 2018 included London with 118.5 and 124.4 and the South East with 67.0 and 74.0 per 100,000 livebirths. Conclusion Few previous studies have investigated HCV among pregnant women in England. These findings complement and supplement existing research by providing national and regional estimates for the number of livebirths to HCV seropositive women in England. Bayesian modelling allows future national and regional estimates to be produced and the associated uncertainty to be properly quantified."
https://openalex.org/W4309495369,"Purpose To measure angle-to-angle (ATA) and spur-to-spur (STS) distances along six meridians using swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT) and compare with horizontal white-to-white (WTW) distance in different refractive error. Methods Overall, 126 eyes were assessed with the Anterion SS-OCT (Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany). ATA and STS distances were obtained using SS-OCT at 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 150 degrees. WTW was measured at 0 degree with built-in infrared camera. One way ANOVA test, pearson correlation coefficient, and stepwise multivariate regression analysis were used to compare ATA and STS distances with age, anterior chamber depth (ACD), axial length (AL), and simulated keratometric values (Sim K) in different refractive error groups. Results The mean MRSE refraction was +0.05 ± 0.23 D in the emmetropic group (41 eyes), -3.42 ± 3.04 D in the myopic group (44 eyes), and +1.33 ± 0.64 D in the hyperopic group (31 eyes). There was no statistical difference in the WTW of the emmetropic (11.62 ± 0.44 mm), myopic (11.79 ± 0.46 mm), and hyperopic groups (11.80 ± 0.49 mm) using one-way ANOVA (p = 0.007). ATA and STS were vertically oval in all groups. The correlation between ATA, STS and age, ACD, AL, and K values showed different significance for each meridian according to the refractive error. ATA increased as the horizontal WTW, ACD, and AL increased and Sim K decreased. STS shows relatively smaller explanatory power than ATA in the stepwise multivariate regression analysis. Conclusions This study is the first to analyze the relationship between ATA and STS compared to WTW by different refractive error. The difference between the horizontally oval WTW and vertically oval anterior chamber can be large, especially in myopia. ATA showed a greater positive correlation than STS with AL and ACD."
https://openalex.org/W4309496077,"There is a lack of understanding concerning the differences between laypeople's and professional judges' conceptions of justifications for sentencing. We conducted an online quasi-experimental study with 50 active judges and 200 laypeople. Participants were presented with a vignette describing severe child abuse leading to fatality and were asked to indicate a term of imprisonment for the father and the justification they would consider relevant when deciding on the sentence. A two-factor analysis of variance showed that laypeople disproportionately favored retribution compared to judges. This was reflected in the judges' higher scores for the other three justifications (incapacitation, general deterrence, rehabilitation). The Likert scales failed to detect any such differences. Furthermore, imprisonment terms given by judges were shorter than those given by laypeople. These results support the hypotheses that judges balance multiple justifications and find a shorter sentence that is appropriate; their lesser bias toward retribution supports the notion that judges should be balanced and fair-minded."
https://openalex.org/W4309496337,"In human applied physiology studies, the amplitude of recorded muscle electromyographic activity (EMG) is often normalized to maximal EMG recorded during a maximal voluntary contraction. When maximal contractions cannot be reliably obtained (e.g. in people with muscle paralysis, anterior cruciate ligament injury, or arthritis), EMG is sometimes normalized to the maximal compound muscle action potiential evoked by stimulation, the Mmax. However, it is not known how these two methods of normalization affect the conclusions and comparability of studies. To address this limitation, we investigated the relationship between voluntary muscle activation and EMG normalized either to maximal EMG or to Mmax. Twenty-five able-bodied adults performed voluntary isometric ankle plantarflexion contractions to a range of percentages of maximal voluntary torque. Ankle torque, plantarflexor muscle EMG, and voluntary muscle activation measured by twitch interpolation were recorded. EMG recorded at each contraction intensity was normalized to maximal EMG or to Mmax for each plantarflexor muscle, and the relationship between the two normalization approaches quantified. A slope >1 indicated EMG amplitude normalized to maximal EMG (vertical axis) was greater than EMG normalized to Mmax (horizontal axis). Mean estimates of the slopes were large and had moderate precision: soleus 8.7 (95% CI 6.9 to 11.0), medial gastrocnemius 13.4 (10.5 to 17.0), lateral gastrocnemius 11.4 (9.4 to 14.0). This indicates EMG normalized to Mmax is approximately eleven times smaller than EMG normalized to maximal EMG. Normalization to maximal EMG gave closer approximations to the level of voluntary muscle activation assessed by twitch interpolation."
https://openalex.org/W4309656095,"This study compared the post-activation performance enhancement (PAPE) effects of a flywheel eccentric overload (FEOL) exercise and barbell half squats (BHS) on countermovement jump (CMJ) and 30 m sprint performance.Twelve male collegiate competitive basketball players were enrolled in this study and they implemented two training protocols: barbell half squat (BHS) and flywheel eccentric overload (FEOL) training. The BHS protocol included three intensities of load: low (40% 1RM), medium (60% 1RM), and high (80% 1RM), with each intensity consisting of 5 sets of 3 repetitions. The FEOL protocol included three inertia intensities: low (0. 015 kg∙m2), medium (0.035 kg∙m2), and high (0.075 kg∙m2), with each intensity consisting of 3 sets of 6 repetitions. The measurement time points were before training (baseline) and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 minutes after training. A two-stage (stage-I and stage-II) randomized crossover design was used to determine the acute effects of both protocols on CMJ and sprint performance.At each training intensity, the jump height, jump peak power output (PPO), jump impulse and 30m sprint speed at 3, 6, 9, and 12 minutes after BHS and FEOL training did not change significantly compared to the baseline. A 2-way ANOVA analysis indicated significant main effects of rest intervals on jump height, jump PPO, and jump impulse, as well as 30m sprint speed. The interaction of the Time × protocol showed a significant effect on jump height between BHS and FEOL groups at high intensity in stage-I (F = 3.809, p = 0.016, df = 4) and stage-II (F = 3.044, p = 0.037, df = 4). And in high training intensity, the jump height at 3 (7.78 ± 9.90% increase, ES = 0.561), 6 (8.96 ± 12.15% increase, ES = 0.579), and 9 min (8.78 ± 11.23% increase, ES = 0.608) were enhanced in I-FEOL group compared with I-BHS group (F = 3.044, p = 0.037, df = 4). In stage-II, the impulse and sprint speed of the FEOL group were significantly higher than those of the BHS group at 6, 9, and 12 min under low (FEOL = 0.015kg∙m2, BHS = 40%1RM), medium(FEOL = 0.035kg∙m2, BHS = 60%1RM), and high (FEOL = 0.075kg∙m2, BHS = 80%1RM) intensities. Furthermore, the sprint speed of the two training protocols did not change at different time points. The interaction of Time × training intensity showed lower sprint speeds in the II-BHS group at a high intensity (BHS = 80%1RM) compared to low (BHS = 40%1RM) and medium (BHS = 60%1RM) training intensities, especially at 9 min and 12 min rest intervals.Although barbell half squat training and flywheel eccentric overload training did not provide a significant PAPE effect on explosive power (CMJ and sprint) in male basketball players, FEOL training showed a better potential effect on enhanced CMJ jump performance at the high training intensity."

However , an analysis materials on the subject shows that work in this area is fragmented ,. In this regard , the purpose of this study is to develop a methodology for diagnosing and regulating the stability of financial development based on a systematic approach. The study used systematic, comparative, and GEO analysis, econometric methods. As a result, new indicators have been developed to diagnose the financial development of countries. The authors also propose criteria, which could be used to signal the need for countercyclical regulation tools. The novelty of the study lies in a systematic approach to the diagnosis and regulation of the stability of financial development. The systemic nature of the study is ensured by the application of the statistical framework of the System of National Accounts. Testing of the developed indicators and criteria was carried out in relation to the OECD+ (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries for the period 2007–2020. As a result of the testing, a rating of countries was built according to the level of stability of financial development. This rating highlighted leading countries as well as countries generating systemic risks. The study also assessed the legal grounds behind the introduction of a countercyclical markup by a number of countries. The new diagnostic and regulatory system has a number of advantage—it is highly representative and objective by nature, and has a wide range of applications. The use of this system will improve the complexity and quality of diagnosing and regulating the stability of financial development at the national and global levels, as well as increase the effectiveness of public decision-making."
https://openalex.org/W4309666038,"Processing and storing blood samples for future analysis of biomarkers can be challenging in resource limited environments. The preparation of dried blood spots (DBS) from finger-stick collection of whole blood is a widely used and established method as DBS are biosafe, and allow simpler field processing, storage, and transport protocols than serum or plasma. Therefore, DBS are commonly used in population surveys to assess infectious disease and/or micronutrient status. Recently, we reported that DBS can be used with the Q-plex ™ Human Micronutrient 7-plex Array (MN 7-plex), a multiplexed immunoassay. This tool can simultaneously quantify seven protein biomarkers related to micronutrient deficiencies (iodine, iron and vitamin A), inflammation, and malarial antigenemia using plasma or serum. Serum ferritin, an iron biomarker, cannot be measured from DBS due to red blood cell (RBC) ferritin content confounding the results. In this study, we assess a simple blood fractionation tool that passively separates plasma from other blood components via diffusion through a membrane into a plasma collection disc (PCD). We evaluated the concordance of MN 7-plex analyte concentrations from matched panels of eighty-eight samples of PCD, DBS, and wet plasma prepared from anticoagulated venous whole blood. The results showed good correlations of &gt;0.93 between the eluates from PCD and DBS for each analyte except ferritin; while correlations seen for plasma/PCD were weaker. However, the recovery rate of the analytes from the PCD were better than those from DBS. The serum ferritin measures from the PCD were highly correlated to wet plasma samples (0.85). This suggests that surveillance for iron status in low resource settings can be improved over the current methods restricted to only measuring sTfR in DBS. When used in combination with the MN 7-plex, all seven biomarkers can be simultaneously measured using eluates from the PCDs."
